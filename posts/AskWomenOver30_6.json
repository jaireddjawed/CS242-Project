My husband also doesn’t want to be “too old” when we have kids &amp; given our age difference, he’s looking at a baby timeline that’s much more near term (next 2-3 years).

        "text": "I had to leave my ex boyfriend around eight months ago, and I haven't found peace since then. For some context, we were long distance. The relationship had so many ups and downs. We lasted around two years together and as the relationship progressed, he started becoming more and more anxious, paranoid and controlling. I'm 26, but I'll be glad to hear advice from women older than me. \n\nDuring the first time I didn't know this these tendencies that he had. However, I think there's some instability in his head and I feel guilty that I couldn't be more patient with him. As I said before the relationship progressed and so did his fears. He started becoming extremely paranoid. I would send him proofs of where I am and he would accuse me of sending old pictures (literally saying that my nails were different today, which was a lie, but his head made him believe those things). Every slight disagreement between us he would see it as me becoming the enemy. Slowly he started making me do less things in life to appease his fears. I accepted filtering my social media, I accepted erasing old pictures even though they weren't revealing, I accepted not having any interaction with men, not even friends, because it triggered him too much. He then started criticizing my clothes and literally asking me to wear a jacket mid July (super hot weather). I remember sitting on my bed and crying because I was boiling underneath the jacket. Then, he didn't want me going to the gym. Things started becoming his way or the highway, there was no way I could compromise. Each time I tried to put my foot down he would call me uncooperative and defiant. I remember he even argued with me when I told him I wanted to study my master's degree, he started saying I was doing it to fill my ego, that it was against God and so on. Anytime I tried to better myself in any way, he would lash out and tell me not to do it. \n\nThe paranoia literally descended into complete madness, to the point he started accusing me of having sex with someone while being on the phone with him to make fun of him. If I showed him my chat long and he found nothing, he would say I erased the chats. Nothing I did was enough. I actually think he also suffered from psychosis because he would have very delusional views on things. He would tell me that the people he had a job interview with were spies and he would call the CIA to inform about it and then get mad if the CIA didn't contact him back. Or he would say that during his fever God told him that he had to go back to his country and start a church. He always thought people were following him while being in the street. \n\nAt some point, I couldn't deal with his inflexible rules over me, the double standards, his lack of trust, and the control. I left. Before I left indefinitely, I tried to leave several times, but he would hit his own face, cry hysterically and bruise his own face, leaving it blue and swollen. I was terrified of what he was doing to himself. \n\nWhat happened after I left was absolutely crushing for me because I tried to do so much but he replaced me in 2 days. He started rubbing the new girl in my face, saying that she was much better than I was, and much more loving and less resentful. He started saying he wasn't controlling anymore and she reaped the benefits that I could have had if I was more patient, but that I considered myself too good to endure his traumas. And that he loved her. Although he tried to \"restore\" our relationship while dating her. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel I did as much as I could until I realised nothing was making him trust me. On the other hand, I still feel guilty. He cut me off as if I was some sort of gangrenous limb, when I was still trying to reason with him and make him see how he had been hurting me and why I left. He started saying that God removed me from his life, that now life was much better, and so on, while at the same time he would still try to keep me there and date the new girl at the same time. \n\nI know he suffered tremendously. I also did. And I can't shake off the feeling that I made him suffer and made him hit his own face, cry and go insane. For whatever reason, no matter how many times people tell me that I dodged a bullet, I feel I could have done more, be more patient, accept his requests and submit more. I don't know what to do with these emotions. I haven't been able to create any relationship after what happened, while he has been. How should I frame this situation to avoid hurting me so much? I feel I abandoned a somehow mentally unstable person on his own. The fact he rubbed in my face how much his life improved right after I left made me think I might be guilty, again.",

        "text": "I'm just curious what women in this age category think about the cold approach from men. \n\nFrom those that are unaware of what that means, I'll give my interpretation of it, it's when a man approaches a random woman, starts conversation, and closes with trying to get her number. \n\nI used to do this when I was younger around the university, and I remember actually going to the mall to do it. \n\nBasically my takeaway was this, being able to confidently talk with strangers is a valuable skill, I feel like I've grown to be really good at it, I speak with all sorts of strangers, old, young, men, women, attractive, not attractive, etc. \n\nHowever, I found that, in a situation like when I went to a mall in my early 20s with the sole purpose of trying to get dates, it really took me out of my natural element and felt like a forced activity (because it was). I would approach women looking for some perfect line, and it never really worked at that time.\n\nOn the other hand, now that I've gotten older, I'll chat up random women (any people for the matter) when something sticks out and I'm going about my day and feel like I'd like to express something on my mind. \n\nI was in the wine section at a store one day and saw a woman about my age, I said, \"Any good recommendation?\" , It just felt so much more natural, and like an eased approach into what sometimes becomes a great conversation. This woman started talking about how her boyfriend was sick to me, my comment was, \"Oh so you're looking to get a little buzz going on so you can tolerate all that whining at home?\" \n\nIt was just fun, silly banter met with laughs. \n\nOne woman I actually dated from a similar event, I met her outside of a bar after her friend ditched her, I felt bad after hearing her story so I invited her to tag along with my friends and I, we played pool and darts for a bit until she had to leave. I had zero intention upfront about needing to try to date her, it just came naturally. \n\nOverall, what do you think about this kind of stuff? Have you had great experiences with this, or bad experiences with men trying this? What separated the bad experiences from the good experiences?",

We were finally able to purchase our first home together last year, after years and years of saving for a deposit and getting our careers/lives in order to obtain a mortgage.  \n\n\nSince the very beginning I've been very, VERY upfront about not wanting children and it being very unlikely to change. S/O agreed saying that he didn't want them either.  \n\n\nHe revealed to me tonight that the reason he's been so down and depressed lately (he's been a fairly negative person ever since I've known him, but it has been worse recently) is because he's realised that he really DOES want kids. His sister and partner are expecting, and he's been worse since their reveal.  \n\n\nI truly don't see myself budging on this issue; I've explained to him that I'd more than understand if he wanted to go separate ways to pursue a partner who shared the same life goals, but he said he'd want it to be with me or no-one. I asked theoretically if he would ever consider fostering (just to try and understand what he wanted) but he said no, biological or nothing. He said he felt he had no reason to exist and was just 'waiting to die'. I personally disagree with having children just to fulfill a 'purpose', but I didn't bring it up for fear of being tactless or blunt.   \n\n\nI'm now thinking 'shit'. Here comes a lifetime of his sulking and resentment towards me. Although I truly do feel for him, me having kids just to appease him is absolutely out of the question, so I guess I'm just going to try and enjoy the ride and life as it comes? It's no-one's fault of course, people change and so do their goals and ideals.  \n\n\nI just feel so alone about it all and wanted to get it off my chest having no-one to talk to about it.   \nHas anyone else ever dealt with this sort of thing?",

        "text": "Odd question but stay with me.\n\nI date men and they are a very interesting and fun group. I also do a predominantly male sport/hobby. I tend not to contribute to convos much as I think this is a unique (mostly) male space and men need that in the same way women need our own. Because of this hobby, I am privy to a lot of convos now about dating and life. Some of those convos have gone into male desirability or just insecurities. It’s been fascinating as hell to say the least. I’ve noticed that men have insecurities that I as a woman would never consider to be anywhere close to a problem.\n\nFor example, I’ve heard time and time again from several guys that they’re insecure about their smell. I have never found any of these men offensive lol. Another example is the guy I’m currently dating mentioned his body as a potential issue…which is odd cause if I didn’t like a bigger guy I wouldn’t have initiated???\n\nHearing these insecurities weekly has caused some convos between me and my friend group. Obviously we all feel insecure about stuff but I was overall wondering…\n\nTLDR: has your partner (any gender) ever revealed an insecurity to you that you just didn’t get/see/perceive? What was the insecurity?\n\nNote: this is a lighthearted question, please maintain that spirit when replying&lt;3",

        "text": "Y'all: I have THE story. \n\nAfter breaking it off with a toxic bf, I took about 9 months off the dating, went to therapy, invested in my self and my hobbies. Then finally I was ready to date again and downloaded OLD and started making a ton of matches. Went on several dates, even saw a guy for about 2 months. However, One guy was really cool and conversation was flowing and we had a lot of common interest and just the energy was a match. It was like we caught fire. However big deal breaker- he doesn't want kids but I do. So obviously I pointed this out when I realized and said \"probably not compatible but I am open to friendship.\" I wish I never ever did that. It's haunted me. I had genuinely believed that it would be possible to be friends at the time.\n\nAfter talking for a month with videos, pictures, text. I started to get attachment feelings. When I recognized this I cut it off. I let him know I am having more feelings than just friends and I didn't intend for that but I'd have to cut it off because for me, I know he isn't offering me what I am ultimately looking for, so I'd just end up hurt. He was totally supportive, bummed, but was open to reconnecting if I wanted. I was in the middle of looking for a new motorcycle and he said \"if you end up finding one let me know\". Anyways a couple weeks go by and I did make the purchase. Sent him a message with \"I did the thing\". I already had a motorcycle but I was looking to add one with more specific riding features. We chatted for a bit about the bike. He stated he wasn't in a position to get one. No worries. I ended up telling him I actually would like to meet at least once in person. He mentioned it as in a date to which I corrected and said no, no expectations just to meet. \n\nWell, we did. I gave him my address and had him pick me up. This way he could see my new bike. This is the only person I have ever had pick me up from a dating app but since we had been chatting for 2 months I felt comfortable. I had texted him my address hours before the meet up and he looked it up, noting \"wow cool neighborhood!\". (I know dumb, lessons have been learned, very difficult lessons.)\n\nWe went out to dinner and everything was fine. Just a normal dinner really. Then we went back to my place, I opened a package of like 10 pairs of shoes I had delivered (not exaggerating, terrible habit) and just continued convo. I showed him my place and he stated \"wow these are amazing views\" which yes, I have the best views. I innocently mentioned \"omg I know! It's so great and I have great views from all rooms. You should see the view from my bedroom.\" And I took him to see. While looking out the window, abruptly he looked at me and said \"I am so attracted to you, I want to kiss you right now on your bed.\" I literally made the 🥴 face. He said \"well if it's not a verbal yes it's not consent and that face is a no.\" Then said he should get going. I apologized for my response and let him know that I do find him attractive, however I am looking for a committed monogamous relationship, and would like kids. None of that to which he is offering, open, or even available for. He doesn't want kids and had informed me earlier in the evening he didn't even want to be in a committed or exclusive relationship. So basically romantically it's a nonstarter for me but I really do enjoy him and his company and would like to be friends. He stated \"idk if I can just be your friend, I am too attracted to you\" I left it at \"well ok I guess let me know.\"\n\nWe didn't talk for a couple weeks, then out of the blue he started messaging me again. Random Pictures of motorcycles, videos, etc. random hobby garb. No worries, I like this hobby so it was cool and it was like once or twice a week. Then about  a month after he sent me a picture and said \"I bought a motorcycle, let's go for a ride\" I was surprised because he had previously told me he wasn't in a position to make the purchase. Also he was living between states with work. But whatever, I actually had a ride planned with my friends so I invited him. Had him meet me at the petrol station on the corner of my place. Of course when I roll up, he is already there and nobody else had arrived. I got off my bike, told him a couple people had mentioned they were running late, admired his bike, then said I needed to go in to purchase a bottle of water because I broke my water bottle. He was like \"oh shit, I forgot my wallet.\" I thought that was weird but just said \"well if you need something I can buy it and you can just pay me back later.\" He was like \"nah gotta have my wallet. I'll just go grab it real quick.\" I'm like no worries, one person said they are 20 minutes out so we have time. Then he starts walking. I was so confused and was like \"wait what? Are you walking?\" And he was like \"yeah, I just moved in yesterday across the street.\" MEANING ACROSS THE STREET FROM WHERE I LIVE?! Then he says \"wait, nvm. I found my wallet\" I honestly was shocked and not sure what the play was, how to respond, what he was looking for, so I just didn't respond at all. Walked into the store purchased my water and came back out and thankfully others had arrived. We did our ride, then went our separate ways. Thankfully this isn't a conversational sport 😅. Next thing I know every fucking morning for two weeks, there he is, standing in the window, watching me. In fact, I would take a picture of him  and send it to my girl group chat as a \"good morning\" text. \n\nAll the while me and him are continuing out text chat like normal. What were up to. Sending vids. I would always respond but I never initiated conversations. Obviously this was not normal. I was shocked. Unsure what to do, so I didn't do anything for a couple weeks. Then I finally texted him and asked him \"why did you move so close to me.\" He basically responded with \"oof that is awkward. It was an accident. When I rented the place it was sight unseen since I was out of town. I didn't realize it was so close to you. I swear I'm not a stalker.\" Literally, he mentioned the stalking thing- unprompted- (like yeah I thought it but no I didn't accuse him directly). The he proceeded to say he was seeing someone else. I said okay I just think it's a bit odd. Like I thought you were cool just not offering me what I am looking for but yeah.  Thought I'd ask since it was weird. \n\nNow here is the fucked up part. I wish we wanted the same things and we were together. If this isn't a load of Stockholm's syndrome. Honestly we just get a long and have so many common interest it's and he is literally everything I am wanting in a partner. Every trait on my checklist (aside from us not actually being on the same page of partnership) like wtf is wrong with me. Every other guy I have dated/met doesn't even compare or I don't have the same interest. I'm having a difficult time forgetting about him and moving on.\n\nI did full on cut him off, as we had made plans and then he cancelled on me and it pissed me off. But none the less, still thinking about it. Like logically I know everything 1. I've created a version of him but I'm not sure if that is the real him. 2. This is crazy behavior from his end. 3. There are plenty of others out there who want what I am looking for and are also adventurous like me. \n\nHow can I fully stop ruminating on this single man? I've even dated others and end up making comparisons to him.",

He said it's not normal. I said he's right, it's not normal as most teens don't want to be with their parents and instead want to be with friends doing god knows what, but I like that we are not the norm and that my daughter just prefers to be home. When she does hang out with her friends, they prefer to come to our house. It shows that I have provided her such a comfortable environment, that she doesn't feel the need to seek love, comfort, or validation anywhere else.\n\nIs this a red flag?\n\nPS - He has an son who is a sophomore in college and dorms there. He also has a 15-year-old daughter that lives with her mom. He barely sees her even though he only lives 2 hours away from her, which bothers me, but I don't say anything about it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm honestly tired of men having problems with my parenting and co-parenting (I have a great relationship with my ex-husband and his new wife and their kids).

I dont really enjoy telling someone I dont even know the things that are on my mind. The guy is nice enough but I have an appointment in 2 hours and I'm not even sure what we will talk about. I'm kind of dreading it. I'll go because I dont want to cancel this late but I'm not sure I want to continue therapy. My friend suggested finding a female therapist about my own age or so. It just feels like these appointments are 1 more thing I have to do added to all the other shit I have on my plate at the moment (work, handling my husbands estate, dealing with everything that owning a house entails, kids, pets...)

        "text": "**TL;DR: I broke up with my boyfriend recently and although it was the shortest and most painful relationship I've ever been in, I'm feeling very, very sad that it's over. Why am I more sad about this breakup than other breakups in relationships that were much happier and healthier?**\n\nI (33F) broke up with my boyfriend (35M) about 10 days ago. We still live together, but he's moving out this week. We only dated for 10-11 months (lived together for 4). It was the shortest and most challenging relationship I've been in. There were obviously a lot of joyful moments, vacations together, similar interests, support, tons of affection, etc that kept the relationship going...\n\n...but there was also so much pain and anxiety. He is one of the most emotionally avoidant and dismissive people I've dated and rarely took any accountability for his hurtful actions. He could lose his temper and shout at me and be very defensive and hypocritical. He had an abusive childhood and hasn't done much to heal it -- I felt that he'd project a lot of his unhealed wounds onto me. The relationship definitely dimmed my light. I also used to lean more \"secure\" in attachment after years of therapy and self-work, but this relationship seemed to undo a lot of it and I reverted back to a lot more anxiety. For all of these reasons and more, I decided to end things.\n\nIf I compare this to my other recent relationships before him, which were each 2-3 years long (also lived together), those relationships were generally very healthy and had an undertone of friendship and compassion, even through hard times. I don't feel that either of those partners were very avoidant, and we were able to work through conflict healthily. In the end we just weren't romantically compatible (to me) and I felt \"healed\" from those breakups very quickly -- I was genuinely only sad for a few days and then mostly just felt relieved that they were over.\n\nBut with this current breakup, I am feeling more sad than I've ever felt post-breakup, even though I ended it because I know this relationship is wrong for me for so many reasons. Am I so sad because the relationship made me feel so diminished and invalidated, whereas my other relationships lifted my soul and never made me feel like a \"bad person\"? Or am I sad because my ex-partner seems mostly unphased about the breakup due to his emotional avoidance (even though he's told me that he's devastated deep down and has never known how to access painful emotions in the moment), which makes me feel like he doesn't care about me? Am I sad because I was more attracted to him than anyone else I've been in a long-term relationship with? \n\nI think I'm just scared because I've never actually been very sad after a breakup, and it's scary to experience the prolonged pain of one for the first time. I know that no one here can give me a definitive answer, but would love to hear if anyone has had a similar experience.",

This came mostly from his side but I liked this because I knew I needed to feel safe because of sexual trauma. When we did have sex it was honestly so bad I would cry secretly. He’d go inside of me, cum in 2 minutes because i ‘looked so good’ and that was it. \n\nThrough conversations it has gotten somewhat better, for instance he does sometimes like 69 but he has only gotten me off 3 times after which he complained it took too long etc. \nI have a satisfyer which can get me off quite easily when I’m alone (which I’ve told multiple times) but he has never suggested during sex i should use it, and when i do use it i feel kind of dirty and ashamed because he’s not enthusiastic. \n\nHe says I’m ‘just very hard to get off’ and so he doesn’t really try and so I realized I’ve been telling myself sex isn’t really that important to me, but deep down i know this isn’t true as he is also lacking in just the physical touch department like holding hands etc. \n\nThings i really like about him:\n\n-he’s funny and quite open minded \n-he is resilient and got through quite a bad childhood environment on his own (although he has never had therapy and doesn’t take any steps to do so)\n-he didn’t make me feel bad for having mental health problems\n- he believes in me and is proud of me (tells his collegues a lot of good things about me etc.).\n-He’s optimistic\n-he’s a good listener\n- he’s a hard worker\n- he’s generous in gifts\n\nThings i don’t like:\n- quite bad sex life if i’m being honest with myself\n- very little physical touch/ words of affirmation even though I’ve asked him multiple times\n-his family\n- him lying about his height (we met online). The height isn’t really a problem but i love wearing heals and he keeps making comments ‘I’m sooo tall’ even with his friends. Which makes me feel inscure even though my height is one of my favorite things about me. \n- him not taking initiative to move out even though he complains about his family and he makes enough money (he works part time and is in his last year at uni)\n-him not being supportive when i talk about misogyny \n\nCan i please get some opinions? I think i already know the answer but still would really like some other perspectives , thank you 💓",

        "text": "My bf and I are in our early and late thirties (8 years apart). We’ve been together for almost two years and have a very happy relationship, so much so that we are thinking of getting engaged next year :)\n\nHowever, our sex life has been taking a hit in the last six months. If it’s not an “I’m too tired”, then it’s a “I’m too stressed” response from either myself or him. I’m usually the one who says that I’m too tired and for very good reason - he has a tendency to initiate when we go to bed to *sleep*. If I’m going to bed to sleep, I’m too sleepy! I’ve told him this already and find it a bit lazy to initiate at this time.\n\nThe “I’m too stressed” comes from him and either happens if I initiate or ten minutes into active intimacy. I’ve always been supportive when this happens. It ends up as a personal therapy session for him where he tells me how work is stressing him out and how work becomes an invasive thought during intimacy. Then he works through those stressors and feels better while I feel worse (exhausted that I’m shouldering my own stress and his).\n\nI’ve given up on initiating as the rejection really deflates my confidence and when he loses his mood during intimacy I’m starting to resent hearing about his work stress. Maybe this sounds cold, but he’s got a regular 9-6 job and deals with annoying contractors the same way I deal with annoying clients. We haven’t got a mortgage, we haven’t got money problems or serious health issues, we have loving supportive families and lovely friends. We have no children or pets. What would our sex life be like if we did have these things on top of it all? Probably wouldn’t be having sex anymore…\n\nI have no problem with occasionally being stressed, but I definitely think that with the frequency he is experiencing it that he’s got to do something about it. Stress can cause so many health issues down the line. I’ve suggested meditation to be more present, working out more, or speaking to a therapist. But none of these have stuck with him. He also agrees and I can see where he’s coming from - work has got him so stressed that the idea of having to do something to destress is stressful. \n\nTyping this out makes me feel a mixture of sympathy, frustration, stress, and resentment. It’s not even about our sex life really, moreso about mental health and stress management. On that note (and sorry for the rant), have any stress management tools really helped you be more present and less stressed?",

        "text": "So long story short..I [M31] have been kind of \"on and off\" with this girl [F30] for a number of years (about 9 years now), never in an actual relationship or anything, but we always sort of kept in touch through the years and had always flirted with each other and kissed a few times. Though it never really grew into anything serious, I always felt like we had some sort of mutual admiration and kind of a thing for each other but it was never really the right time. We managed to keep contact on social media until about 2 years ago when she got into a new relationship and we just kind of drifted away.\n\n I started to pretty much move on with my life as usual and it was really starting to become a thing of the past and something to reminisce upon, until recently, out of the blue, she decided to hit me up on IG, being flirty as usual and even saying if I am \"still all talk\" and wanting to hang out. I was a bit surprised to hear from her in that way after all that time, but thought maybe she really wanted to finally give things a try and maybe see how it goes and this time it could be different. \n\nSo long story short, as we sort of reconnected, it brought back some of the old memories, but during the hangout it did feel that we both werent quite the same as we used to and the feeling just quite wasn't there. After the hang out, I knew that its probably over and I thought I'd just let her know how I felt about her through all this time. And as I suspected, she didn't quite feel the same. And pretty much said she had no feelings and to not text her again. Now, normally I wouldn't mind such a response, but it was more of how cold she said it, that almost made it seem like there was never anything there, like we almost never knew each other and almost took the meaning out of all the memories that we had and made me look absolutely ridikolous. I found that to be quite confusing and just not right in some way. As it really made me question if through all these years we ever even looked at each other the same way.\n\n Though we never really hung out a lot all this time, I always felt like we had a sense of respect for each other and knew each other to some extent. 10 years is quite some time, even if we werent close. But after that final message from her, it almost redefined our whole relationship. At some point even making a mockery out of it, saying how she \"wants a divorce\" and how \"I was acting hella weird\" and making it seem like she never was even into it at all, even though she was the one to reach after all these years out of nowhere. Which in turn just made me question things even more.. What was the few times that we did kiss for..and all the flirting for through the years..And if feelings change why reach out again after all this time.. \n\nSo long story short, I decided to just let it be and respond and send her one final message how I ll remember the good times and wish her well, as I felt regardless of how she felt, we ve at least still known each other for quite some time and this may be the last time we speak with each other after all. And to my surprise, all she responded with is to again not message her again and reiterating how she was clear that we aren't looking for the same things from each other and how if I message her again she will put me \"on blast\". It felt very strange and bizarre to say the least, almost comical. Like she was trying to assert herself in some way, which felt like an over top reaction. But at the same time borderline disrespectful on her part to talk that way to someone she s known for a long time and I was absolutely caught off guard. Not knowing what to say, I just let it be. \n\nHowever, after some time reflecting upon everything, I wanted to finally let some things of the chest and let her know about what I thought about it and sent her one more message about how I felt about her response in the context of us knowing each other. And thats when things really escalated for the worst. A few days later, this time I get a whole letter from mother about how I should leave her daughter alone and how I should stop \"disguising as a friend\" and stop trying to \"harass her\" or she will contact authorities. It felt absolutely ridikolous, which really caught me off guard and one more felt like another over reaction. To get that get of response, when I wasn't even the one to reach out after all these years, felt absolutely infuriariting and it just felt like she was almost victimzing herself to make herself look better in front her mom and friends and paint a different narrative by omitting the parts that didn't suit it. And that just really didn't sit right with me.\n\n It has been over a year since then, and it is something thats been constantly on my mind and it quite affected me in some profound ways and caused me some sleepless nights. Maybe it was jist the fact that in all years of my life I ve never had anyone talk to me in such a way. And to some extent it was not just the blatant disrespect of someone she \"s known\" for a long time, but also the fact of me being in a very good space mentally prior to her reaching out, living my life as I wanted, only for her to come years after we havent spoken with each other and cause such a downward spiral.\n\n We haven't been in any contact since and I do not feel like I ever want to do anything with her again, (and frankly I think she is a pathetic human being for what she did), but I do feel like I really want to speak my truth, or at least my version of it, to her self-righteous mother who pretends her daughter is an \"angel\" that can do no wrong, and I m just this obsessed bad guy that one day woke up after all these years to harass her daughter out of the blue.\nIts something thats been sitting in my spirit for quite some time and I just feel like it has to be healed for me to move on. \n\nAny thoughts. To speak the truth or just let it be?",

        "text": "I promise this is not fap fodder or a troll post. I am a 28YOM in a long term (4y) relationship with a 28YOF. We are both each others first significant other and we are \"mildly\" sexually active. By this I mean that we are waiting for PIV sexual intercourse for marriage, but we frequently mess around in other ways. \n\nLong story short, my girlfriend (for a variety of reasons and situations) has not orgasmed before. I know this may seem unusual but I fully trust her her and have known her for a very long time. She does not masturbate and she had very little sexual education growing up. She describes her self as somewhere on the scale between asexual and demisexual. \n\nWhen we fool around it usually ends in myself finishing, and her enjoying the stimulation up until she \"feels like she is going to pee.\" For lack of a better term she then gets scared and we stop before going any further. From her own description she is a mixture of embarrassed by what may happen, scared of what may happen, and generally the experience is too much. \n\nVery recently, on rare occasions she will request I use a vibrator for her, and she seems to really enjoy that. However, the same happens. \n\nWe both communicate very well, I love her very much and there is no animosity, anger, or hurt feelings in this situation. I want more than anything for her to be comfortable and not feel pressured; but I do want her to be satisfied and feel happy. \n\nThat is a long backstory for a relatively short question: In a non-fap-fodder way, what can I tell my girlfriend to try and help her be more prepared for her first orgasm? Are there specific physical feelings that come right before it? Is there a way for her to anticipate certain reactions or results? We have gone fairly far before to the point where she has asked me, \"was that one?\" \n \nI do watch porn, but she does not. As stated we are both each others firsts so while I see certain things in porn, I have no real world experience to help her. I could tell her what I assume based on porn, but obviously that seems flawed.\n\nIn her own words, she is very nervous about \"squirting, or peeing, or something similar\" happening and I think that is a big reason she hasn't gone further. Is there a way to know if this will happen?",

All of these friends don’t know each other, as I made friends with them at various stages of my life. \n\nI have always been the type of person who strives to be a good conversationist, a good friend who listens, as I care about my friends (plus also, I believe in treat people how you want to be treated). I’ve met people who are really bad at chatting to, so I remind myself to not be like those people. \n\nAnyway, I feel that I can’t ever talk about any of my issues in life to my close friends, because they’re always talking about theirs or their work, kids, partners, health issues. So I let them talk, ask them questions and reply with sympathies or whatever. I wait for my turn to talk about me. Finally after there’s a quiet moment, I take the opportunity to bring up something about me. When I do, I can see them either get their phones out, check on their kids, look at their nail polish, eat their food, interrupt me. This happens to all of my friends. I get the feeling they are using me as their therapist or something, to be able to get their issues heard &amp; validated; but have no care or time for me &amp; my issues or news of my life. \n\nSometimes when something happens in my life, I really want to discuss it with someone, so I can try to shed light on it &amp; get advice; but I just know that they’re not going to care or they’ll change the topic before giving me advice &amp; start talking about themselves. \n\nI know I should get new friends, but as I met these people throughout my life, I’m starting to feel as though everybody is self absorbed &amp; I will never find a friend in life who genuinely cares about me. \n\nAnyone else feel the same about their friends or family not giving you the same shoulder to lean on or ear to chat to? Have you developed a way to communicate to them to pay attention to you? Have you changed the way you let new friends treat you? Please share",

        "text": "It started about 3 months ago I think. Winter, cold and dark and snowy so maybe to be expected, but then things started to crumble. The women at work began going through really major life events and work became so heavy that the two of us that are independent contractors left the owner and went out on our own. Then my friends here started going through the normal issues that are coming up for folks with late stage capitalism / relationship stuff / whatever. Normal life stuff. But then my best friend started to really decline and shes always been the happiest person I know, I have never seen her actively down for an extended period in 15 years. I reached out to a friend I hadn't spoken to in a year and she said she couldn't talk right now because she was too depressed. So I reached out to my partners best friends wife because shes always good for a laugh and a week later she replied that shes been too depressed to reply to messages and to just call her next time im in town. So then I reached out to a woman I had hung out with a few times when I first got here that was so funny wed just spend an hour having a beer and gutting ourselves, shes also struggling to cope. Like the list goes on and on and on. I literally dont know a single person from any area or stage in my life that isn't dealing with serious life issues right now.\n\nMy life is pretty good over all. I stress about money a bit being self employed in a recession but over all I love my partner and my home and my pets and my family and Im healthy and active and.... Im pretty happy. And Im finding its a bit difficult right now because obviously I don't wanna go parading around delighting in my life when others are struggling, it feels selfish to even mention money concerns when Im so much better off than many. My best friend can make space for my happiness even with her current concerns but everyone else is so new in my life Id just feel like such a turd being like \"kk, enough sads, lets talk about fun thing!!\". Its starting to affect me, not having time for play and spontaneity and joy with other women. Its gotten to the point where I think im getting weird about my relationship because I literally only want to see him now... we laugh and hike and joke and play and then he goes away and everything is sad again. \n\nI know 90% of whats happening is the social divide that occurred during covid, economic concerns, environmental concerns etc etc etc. like I believe this is a social and not individual issue. Typically I am good to hold space and offer support, I made an entire career around it, but lately my cup is getting pretty empty myself and the way I usually fill it is through positive and playful communication with other women. Its reached a point where I have nowhere to turn for joy. I called my uncle today, hes my best friend in the world and we talk for about 3 hours every sunday. He picked up sobbing and told me we'd have to postpone our call. Ive never heard him cry before. This one has me truly worried tbh but like, I love him lots.\n\nBecause this is reddit I will say - I do hike 4-8k every day before work (except this past week because snow), work out 20 mins a day, do yoga 20 mins a day, meditate 20 mins a day, eat healthy, read for pleasure and learning and Im going to spend the afternoon working on a silly painting. So when I ask how to bring joy into my life it really is more about human connection than filling some void in myself. \n\nSo, goddesses of reddit, where can I go in society where there is a high probability of interacting with people that feel positively about their lives and want to laugh, maybe be creative, maybe move their bodies, something fun. Or how can I turn the current conversations Im having with new friends around to be more positive without wandering into the bullshit land of toxic positivity that literally helps no one? Or do I just throw in the towel and accept that there is, frankly, not a whole lot to feel positively about these days and continue to pour most of my emotional resources into my relationship until this stage in history balances out a bit? I mean hes feeling the same about all the people in his life so perhaps we could just skip merrily into the land of aggressive codependency because at least its fun in there. Kidding... kinda. hahaha. \n\nAs I write this out... things are just bleak right now... arent they? Ugh.",

But the fear of ending up getting hurt again and the painful realisation that I wasted some of the best years of my life on men who were not worth it, and that I better \"salvage\" what's left of my 30s are getting the best of me..\n\nHow do I calm my sh*t down a bit and have a more relaxed attitude towards dating, without compromising on what I want (a life partnership),and while making my dating intentions and needs clear from the beginning?",

        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI've been dealing with what I think is crippling loneliness that feels like it's come and gone in waves over the past year. Just to preface *I do have a history of anxiety and depression since a young age,  also very likely have ADHD.* **I have been doing therapy since college-which has been over 10 years now.** It helps to an extent, but I feel like I can only do so much to not feel upset by the way life has gone for over the course of the past few years. \n\nAfter I turned 30, I realized that I feel like it's so unbelievably easy to feel forgotten. Like as if I don't exist. I deleted my social media last year-instagram and twitter for a long period and while that helped to an extent to help me let go of my impulse to scroll/post, I went weeks (nearly months) with zero interaction with people my age. No texts. No \"hey how are you\" or \"I was thinking about you\". I'm the one who always intiates first, who starts conversations first, who texts people who I haven't heard from in years. I've used bff apps and feel like 99% of the time, if I'm not driving the convo, it will dissapate. \n\nI came back to social media to mostly to follow events in my area and have been a part of a community initiative that happens every month that's been somewhat fun. I also go to events/socialize wherever possible. I make plans with people I know, even if they feel like acquaintences at best. But whenever I meet new people, I feel like it's very passive. I know that making friends in 30s is hard, but it's hard to come to terms with this reality while not having an existing social circle that I feel a part of-most people I know have this by virtue of growing up in the same place or living in the same place where their parents/grandparents/generations have settled. I've never had that b/c I moved throughout 11 cities/towns throughout my life due to various life circumstances. I'm also a minority and my parents are immigrants, so there are very few places in US where I feel alright to live in without constant microaggressions that I've faced in my twenties that literally costed me job opportunities and set me far back in my career that I'm working so hard to overcome now in my thirties.\n\nI know so many people as a result of moving but I exist in the background or not at all b/c they have everything they need in terms of social support and actually even blatantly say \"I don't want to make new friends\". The few people I know in life who wanted a change and try something new moved to the city I currently live in-a major metropolitan area that I grew up in for a few years and kept visiting every year or so and now have lived here on my own for four years. I live in the more ethnically diverse part of the city whereas most people I know who moved live in the sort of luxury apartments and kind of are invested in doing the bougie city things that you see on the TV shows lol. No hate-to each their own, but I feel frustrated that even a good childhood friend who was my college roommate for so many years moved and in the timespan of 6 months **has hung out only twice** and is always posting everyday the things they're doing in the city that they literally can invite me too b/c I'm just a few train stops down but don't. \n\nI once confronted her how I feel left out and she felt bad so invited me out the next day but afterwards just has been doing her own thing with her other friend who moved from the same hometown. There've been a few other people I know who moved all the way from the other side of the country to this city and I got in touch with them immediately to tell them we should hang out and some of my fav things in the city that \"we should go to\" and saw on social media they went to all these places with friends they somehow managed to make in a short span of time without me. \n\nI honestly feel like such a loser. Where did I go wrong? I have felt this for years, but it feels like....if I looked differently, was more conventionally attractive, fashionable or had a \"wow\" factor, I'd be more accepted. I self-introspect a lot and do therapy and am always confronting where I can be a better person but I do feel I've always **strived hard to be a better friend to people than people have been to me.** I always listen to people when they have problems or help people when they need help. Heck, I helped a girl I just met on a friends app get a job through one of my connections. I do reach out to people and do my part to make initiatives, but nothing sticks. \n\nThe only thing that is helping abate the crippling loneliness is that I'm creative minded and have tons of hobbies. I also attend almost every random event in my area, sometimes through the local library or other initiatives in the area. I don't feel like the people I meet are \"friends\" per se but I'm a familiar face and treated with respect. I love trying new things even if it's solo. \n\nI'm single too btw and WFH in a career I don't love-the latter which I think is also has been contributing to my depression. I've tried dating apps and REALLY have done my best, but I hardly get matches or when I do-it's always guys who either instantly unmatch me after following or are always waiting for me to keep the convo going rather than express an interest in asking questions/getting to know me. I know romantic parternship works easily for some, but it's been even more challenging than friendships for me. Idk, I feel like I'm in a timeline where everybody has found a place where they feel they belong whereas I'm scrambling to find my place-like it feels like when we were in grade school and got to pick our own partners and there was always somebody at the end who couldn't find a group to pair up with. I didn't realize how abandoned I'd feel in my thirties.",

        "text": "The Q: \n\nPeople who quit because of burnout with nothing lined up - what were you emotions / personal dissonance experiences like before acting on it? \n\nWhere I’m at  … \n\nI think I have to do it. I am not me right now. I think I’ve hit some form or degree of life impacting burnout. I feel like a quitter. Like I don’t have any resilience. I feel shame around knowing I need a break. Like the way I’m feeling isn’t bad or big enough. But I’m just so off. \n\nI’m safe, I’m healthy,I have amazing support. I am in the place where I COULD. Money to last a hot minute, no kids besides dogs, no large bills and voluntary expenses I could cut without major negative impact to quality of life. but I’m off. I think the most exhausting part is the dissonance cycle in my brain — the louder voice saying “you make stupid good money, you’re likely going to get a promotion in May, and you’d just quit?” \n\nI have money in the bank. I have low expenses and could make them lower, easily. I could just walk away. I want to walk away. I want to have the energy to do things, even just one /anything I love and feel like my cup is being filled. Like taking the dogs on a good walk, not just a “shit it has to be done” walk. But I’m too exhausted. I’m too exhausted to try to continue to set and reset and reinforce boundaries at work. I’m worn down. I’m too exhausted to make decisions - big ones like this let alone pick a size of coffee(yep - that brought tears recently) \n\nI am powered by a machine I can’t turn off and need to. My job is not hard and I don’t care about letting them down.  But doing 3 peoples job coupled with the emotional energy I use putting aside my feelings of “oh that’s not illegal or unethical it just feels wrong and out of alignment with my values” or choosing to say “that’s not right” is making me a shell of a human.  Day by day I’m logging in, kicking ass, and crawling into bed immediately after. To my boss I am a top performer - to my husband, my parents, my closest friends I am dull, withdrawn, unenthused by things I used to love. I’m cynical, I’m doubtful when I usually am confident and bright.\n\nYet I can’t get myself to do it. \n\nI’m barely able to eat. The thought makes me feel sick. I’m having headaches multiple times a week. I can’t remember the last time I felt content and like I’m not a wound up toy car just motoring along. \n\nThe smallest things break me daily. Oh the dog had mud on her paws - tears. The yard needs mowing - must mean my husband who is renovating the mud room doesn’t love me. My sister texted - I should snap on her. \n\nIt’s weird. It’s like I’ve thrown in the towel in every aspect of my life except work and realizing it is breaking my heart. Yet I still can’t pick up the phone and professionally tell my boss “hey. I can’t. I need out”. Because I know in reality, even though I have no problem being direct and holding firm, it wouldn’t be as simple as calling. It would be a million ideas - take a month off, give that work to XYZ Person. I’ve set boundaries that continue to be broken and am exhausted with my inner negotiation of how to reinforce them. Through no ill intent my boss has made it clear she does not give a fuck. But again the dissonance - my job is not hard and I like what I do (well 2 of 3 jobs). But it’s like - do I quiet quit/do less/drop balls and try to manage the stress while hoping the time I give myself back by doing less is usable or do I just go. I know the answer yet here I am.\n\nIn my head every morning is the thought of “oh I am excited to do XYZ after work”. And then 5pm comes and I just want to knock out “one more thing” so it’s off my list for tomorrow. Or it’s a late meeting with the India team that exhausts me if I go and exhausts me if I don’t.  Then tomorrow at work comes and the todo list fills up again and the cycle continues. The motor keeps motoring. I could just not but the tape in my head knows that thing is still there - just floating around needing to be done. I know there are things I need to work as a person - perfectionism, etc. but the thought of trying to work on myself while working makes my heart rate rise. “Oh one more thing to do on any given day”. I know this isn’t kind to myself and I’m prioritizing the wrong things.  \n\nMy best mental idea of a plan is to quit this current job in late March/April. Maybe take the summer off and then find a part time option. Just something that would cover the cost of COBRA - Costco, target, etc, to offset critical bills though I could go much longer and be totally fine money wise. (I worked really hard to be “good”  with money and saving responsibly when I was not that way when I was younger …AT ALL. So that’s  later on top of this. Call it pride, call it worry lol but not lol)\n\nI guess my closest comparator to how I feel right now is a bad college relationship. You don’t know it at the time but looking back it’s like “well no shirk. Johnny frat boy says one thing, does another. Anyone from the outside sees the decision to break up as simple - he’s a turd and I’m worth more. But as the person in the situation — blinded by (at the time) PBR and hope (and other, deeper reasons of course!) — it’s not as cut and dry. Looking back Johnny should have gotten the boot with the first stupid situation. Same with work. Work (I think) is the Johnny frat boy here and a very good paycheck, pride - both good and bad,  goals for the future like paying off our house (which fortunately we purposely bought using 1 income only), building our new dream house, retiring relatively young are the PBR and hope (and of course, the deeper things). Idk this got a little weird but I’m going to leave it in :)\n\nFeels good to ramble and process this out a minor amount. Thanks for reading.",

We had a very hard time, between my health that required an emergency C section and stress of having a newborn in an unfinished house.\n\nMy partner Todd and I purchased the house years before our toddler was born. Todd doesn’t like to ask for help. Todd also has issues with being clean. During my first pregnancy, I was in a home that had been flooded in and the flooring torn off. It took Todd several months to finish because he insisted on doing things solo, until I forced him to get help because I was heavily pregnant. I offered to pay for the finances of the help to finish. We compromised, after much fighting, and I paid for certain services and he finished the work he wanted to finish. We made it in time by a few weeks. \n\nI returned from maternity leave early because of finances, and it was too early. Todd requires a lot of reminders. I wake up Todd when baby wakes up (on-time) for daycare, and many times I play with toddler until Todd decides to wake up or I have to keep calling his name to wake him up. Todd insists on taking toddler to school, which I appreciate, but won’t wake himself up. \n\nMuch of the cleaning and mental energy falls on me. Todd calls me bossy for asking him to do chores, or reminding him to do things. Often times, Todd does not do things properly causing me to have to re-do them. Or he does things but doesn’t complete them. I spend a great deal of time educating Todd on how or why to do something, such as wiping down the play area because both toddler and pets venture there.\n\nI found out I was pregnant this week. After waiting for Todd to wake up, to watch toddler, so I could clean, I find a mess from Todd and told him I frankly couldn’t do it and we need to terminate the pregnancy. AITA?",
