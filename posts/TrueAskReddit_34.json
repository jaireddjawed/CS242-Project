        "text": "I was wondering about this question while doing some research for my thesis but I wasn't 100% sure how to word it or where to ask it. I have noticed that the need to \"release\" pent up emotion, or \"express our feelings\" seems to be an accepted notion in a lot of psychological literature.\n\nIt is also an important plot device in so many works of fiction: think of how many dilemmas, personal conflicts, and events occur in novels, theatre, films and television. People feel guilt and have to admit things that cause problems; people who cannot \"express themselves appropriately\" will resort to things such as violence to \"release\"; some resort to substance abuse or take up other habits (overwork or other consistent activity) to attempt to block out negative, \"pent-up\" feelings from things such as childhood abuse, trauma etc. But often these people are seen to have breakdowns or suddenly \"snap\" and cause pain and suffering, because they haven't \"dealt with\" these negative feelings.\n\nSo I go back to my title: is this need to \"deal with\" these negative feelings a universal thing? Has this been shown by research? Is there evidence of this? Does it differ between cultures? If it is accepted, have their been cases of people who are not affected by these things and do not have this need? Hopefully my question is clear enough, and thank you in advance.",

Today the only well-known names in science and philosophy seem to be communicators like Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Neil Tyson and Brian Greene, who are not famous for their works and discovery. Even as a physics major I can barely name a physicist alive today that isn't known solely for their books and television series. I believe Carl Sagan may be the major dividing line between \"superstar discoverer\" and \"superstar communicator\", but I don't see how he really has anything to do with it. My only explanation is modern work in science involves dedicated teams, so there's less room for individuals to shine. \n\nAs for philosophy I find it hard to believe there's not people thinking of new questions that would encapsulate the masses. Is modern day philosophy less interesting to the general public than the questions asked in the early 20th century? Are people in general just less interested in philosophy?\n\nAs for visual arts, personally the only living artists I can name are Jeff Koons and Banksy, and I think most \"non-art people\" are in a similar situation. What is the reason for this? Has everything already been done? Are people just more interesting in television and music?",

        "text": "As I understand, to bring a new medication to market, a pharmaceutical company must spend millions of dollars in research &amp; development to provide the FDA with adequate proof that the medication is both safe &amp; effective, a process that can take several years to complete, and if approved, the medication hits the shelves.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow we all know that when new drugs come to market they are crazy expensive- why? To make back those millions the company spent in R&amp;D to get the drug on the shelf, and eventually make a profit. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow that the medication is FDA approved, and all the research has been completed, any generic pharmaceutical company can also produce &amp; sell the drug; however, these companies did not spend the time, money &amp; effort discovering/engineering and testing the drug, so they can sell it for much cheaper &amp; still make a profit. There becomes absolutely no incentive to develop new medications, because you can't sell your product at a high enough price to be able to return your investment, let alone make a profit.  \n\nLuckily the FDA has an answer to this:  patents and/or market exclusivity. This gives a drug developer several years in which they, and only they, can produce and sell their drug. Once the patent ends, generic companies hop on board and prices fall.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo my question is how are medications so cheap in socialist countries? Can generic companies overseas produce a medication that is patented in America and sell it in other countries? Is the brand medication the same price there as here, but their governments pay most of the charge with taxes? Or do the pharmaceutical companies only charge so much in America because they can (market exclusivity)? \n\n\nWhat would be a possible solution to medication cost in America? If the FDA keeps its approval requirements for safety/efficacy data, who pays for it? ",

        "text": "Hello everyone, to start this off, this post will be talking about my interests in humanity, my thoughts on it, my curiosity and asking for opinions on these. Some information you may want before this will be, I'm a male, eighteen years old.\n\nTo start with, when I was younger, I used to hate humanity, I still believe humans are naturally evil but they always seemed so selfish and stupid to me, I preferred animals over humans and I even considered I'd save a cat or dog over a human in a situation that demanded it assuming it was a stranger. This changed a few years ago after a revelation. 'Every human has a life equally as complicated at yours'. It stunned me, completely! This changed my whole perspective on humanity, war, every bad event ever taken place on another person! Imagine, every one of those many people, had a complicated life, everyone of those people's lives combined together is an insane number of years, wisdom; people who had families that also had their complicated experiences with this individual. I don't know about everyone else but this made my mind expand.\n\nAs for the main point of this though, my interests tend to involve anything with a persons experience. It can be simple like how girls live day to day and the minor differences they would experience compared to a boy, something no boy would 'truly' understand. I can comprehend the emotional states being different, the periods being annoying, interest in love rather than sex. I'm not a girl though so I wouldn't know these things. As for the morbid stuff, I'm interested in negative events as much as I'm into basic as-well as positive stuff. Like what it would be like to have 'multiple personality disorder' and the life you'd have to have to acquire said disorder. What it would be like to have schizophrenia. Hell, I've even had curiosity about what death would feel like, I've looked up that before dying by drowning, you may instinctively hold your breath till you pass out then die after and by then it may feel peaceful depending on the situation of course. These interests usually get me looking up stuff online so I can get a vision of what It'd be like then my just thinking about it in my head, even going into full daydreams into these fantasy lives as if I heard the stories from them and was just relaying it in memory. These idea's can go really far, even into sexual events although it's more out of curiosity than as erotic thoughts.\n\nBut yeah, I won't go to much into detail, at least not more then I have already. I was just curious if this is 'normal' in any way? My curiosity about things seems off the charts. I know I'm not psychotic or sociopathic since I have emotions, understand what I'm interested in and although it'd be interesting to see if my visions of these events are correct I'm not violent nor would I ever attempt these things since as I said, I'm interested in humanity on a complicated fundamental level where everyone has there own lives. It just makes me you know, want to ask them to explain every interesting aspect of their lives.\n\nSo yeah, please feel free to go in deep on my psychology and try to help explain this. I've met no one with the same views as me so far. A lot of people consider me interesting because my range of interests and these thoughts that they seem to have not thought about at all.",

        "text": "My dad was adopted and it is a VERY sore subject with him. In my 22 years of life, I only had one brief conversation with him about it. Its almost like he's somewhat in a state of denial over it. Case in point, when medical professionals ask him about family medical history, he cites medical cases from his adoptive family, where there is obviously no correlation. When my mom was pregnant with me, she begged him to look into his family history for medical purposes to no avail. In short, it's a conversation none of my family can openly have with him. I'm sorry he feels that way, I can't even imagine the emotional toll that could have on a person as I've never been there. I don't want to seem insensitive or come off as unaccepting of my grandparents who adopted him-- My grandfather is my favorite person in the world and literally nothing could ever replace the bond I have with him. But still, i would like to know more about my dad's biological roots. There's 50% of my genetic background that I know nothing about, not to mention it's very important to me to learn about my family medical history, if I can. I have no desire to establish a connection of any sort with his biological parents. I just feel as though I have a right to know. My dad's history is my history, too. His medical background is my medical background and I don't want to be in the dark on this any longer. I realize there are different tests you can take to vaguely fill in the blanks, but I'm looking for solid answers. Is there a way to discreetly look into those records without his consent??? Sidenote, I live in the US. (Also, I'm new to Reddit so i apologize if my reddiquette is a little off!)",
