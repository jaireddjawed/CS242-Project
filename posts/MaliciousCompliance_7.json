Looking back it was probably the stupid thing I ever did. Anyway, so I had this big water bottle full of whiskey that I brought to school. I was drinking it all throughout the morning and almost finished it by lunch. At that point I was literally stumbling through the halls and REEKED of whiskey. Basically all my friends knew just by glancing me what was up. I was in 9th period (we had 10) and I really had to pee so I went  up to ask my teacher. My teacher looked so done, but she signed my pass anyway. I decided to go on a little walk to the cafeteria because I was bored; I just took a little loop around and then left. As I was walking down the hall, I suddenly felt deathly nauseous so I actually walked to the bathroom. There were about 8 girls in there, including a couple of my friends. I pushed my way into a stall and puked. I walked out of the stall and everyone looked very concerned. I ended up getting sat down and taken care of by all the girls in the bathroom. I was actually about to leave when two nurses walked in and took me to the office. Long story short, I was suspended for a week. They also searched me and found my nicotine and dab pen.

        "text": "**TL:DR - Employee is certain she knows better, is wrong, and FAFO.**\n\n**Warning - pretty long.  Sorry.**\n\nAs I talked about the last time I posted in here, I work in a union shop, and I've been a shop steward for most of my 25+ year career.  In that time, I've seen some shit, both figurative and literal, and every single time I've ever been unwary enough about how fate works to utter the words, \"Now I've seen everything,\" the universe will inevitably hand me its beer and say *Watch This*.\n\nStewards, despite the general perception of us, aren't there to defend employees who are accused of misconduct - we're there to defend the collective bargaining agreement, meaning if you've well and truly fucked yourself and your future with the agency we both work for, my role is primarily helping you determine which of your options for leaving you're going to exercise.  I've been at this rodeo for a long time, and management and I generally have a pretty good understanding of how things are going to go.\n\nEnter Jackie.  Jackie was one of those unbelievably toxic peaked-in-high-school-cheerleader types, with just enough understanding of what our employer does, how it's required to behave within federal guidelines, and what its obligations are when you utter certain mystical phrases like \"I need an accomodation,\" or \"discrimination based on a protected class.\"  To be clear, those things are not just law, they're also morally right to be concerned about, and so my employer actually bends over backwards and does backflips to be certain that they're going above and beyond the minimum.  Jackie was not a minority in any sense - she was female, but in a workplace that's 80% female, that doesn't quite count.  She may well have been disabled, but that was undiagnosed, I think, and I'm inclined to think her claims of it, much like most of the rest of the things she said, were complete fabrications.\n\nThe point at which I got involved was at the tail-end of over a year's worth of actions by Jackie, in which it rapidly became apparent that her manager was, in fact, an excellent candidate for canonization.  I got referred to her when one of my other union friends contacted me and said, \"Hey, Jackie so &amp; so just got put on administrative leave, and it's total BS, can you help?\"  I get referrals like this a **lot** both because I've been around forever, and because I have a pretty good track record for ensuring that people accused of shit they haven't actually done get treated fairly, so nothing stuck out to me as odd.  I contacted her, and she had *absolutely no idea* why management would put her on admin leave, without any warning, and confiscate all of her agency-issued devices, access, and instruct her that she was not to have any contact at all with anyone she worked with during work hours.\n\nThis immediately sent up a whole host of red flags - for one thing, I know the senior HR guy that is the HR analyst's boss who's involved, having been down the road of difficult-situation-but-this-is-what-we-can-do negotiation with him many, many times over the years.  I don't always agree with him, but he's fair, and usually we can come to some sort of middle ground - at any rate, he would **never** suspend someone out of the blue without a really, really good reason.  She knows what she's done.  She has to.....so I gave her my usual spiel of Things To Do And Things You Should Not Do:\n\n*  Don't tell me, or our employer, things that aren't true.  Especially if you think it'll make you look bad if you don't.\n\n*  Don't talk to your coworkers.  Don't talk to your friends about this, **particularly because you live in a town of under 2000 people**, everyone knows everything about everyone else.\n\n*  Do not talk with management, or HR, without me present.  Period.\n\n*  When they do start asking questions, keep answers simple, to the point, short, and do not give lengthy explanations - tell them what they want to know and *otherwise shut the fuck up*.\n\n*  I have been here and done this many times.  I know this process very well.  I can't tell you what they're *going* to do, but I can tell you what I *think* they're going to do, and I'm usually either right or pretty close to being right.  I have been surprised.\n\nNearly three weeks went by of radio silence from the Agency, other than a bland sort of \"We want to talk with Jackie about utilization of work assignments, tasks and equipment,\" email that tells you almost nothing while still being literally true.  Finally, it was go-time for a meeting, and I did something I haven't done in a really long time - I physically drove to Jackie's worksite instead of attending virtually, over an hour and a half each way.  What the hell, the weather was nice.  We met ahead of going in, and I asked her if she remembered the rules I gave her at the beginning.  She said she did.  I asked her if she'd been following them, and she said she'd been very careful to.  Swell.  In we go.\n\nDuring the meeting, it was almost immediately obvious to me from the questions they started asking that Jackie was in serious, serious shit.  Not, like, written warning, or pay reduction....no, they were going to go for termination, and she was probably going to be very lucky if they decided not to refer it to the DA for criminal prosecution.  An abbreviated summary, of just the high points:\n\n*  Jackie had *hundreds* of confidential documents and electronic files in her personal posession, many of which fall squarely under HIPAA.  She had emailed these out of the government system to one of the four or five personal email addresses she maintains.  Her explanation for this was...questionable.\n\n*  Jackie had logged overtime without permission.  A lot.  And, on one memorable date, when she was vacationing in Europe with her family at the time - she said she'd called in to attend a meeting, but didn't have an answer why that meeting had apparently been 11 1/2 hours long and nobody remembered her attending by phone.\n\n*  Jackie had audio-recordings of disabled and elderly people with whom she was working, that she had taken without their consent or knowledge.  A lot of them.\n\n*  Jackie's overall work product and system activity reliably showed that she was logging in at the start of her day (from home), and she worked some in the afternoon...but there were hours and hours of time when her computer was idle.  She explained this as participating in union activity, which I knew was BS, because...\n\n*  Jackie is not a steward.  Jackie has no idea what the collective bargaining agreement actually says about much of anything beyond \"stewards can do whatever they want, and management can't say shit\" which is....uninformed, shall we say.  At any rate - steward activity must be recorded and time coded as such.  Jackie has never attended steward training and so didn't know this.  Apparently nobody ever told her that.\n\nThere's more.  There's so, so much more, but in the interests of brevity, I will summarize the next **four months** of my dealing with this woman by pointing back to the cardinal rules I gave her, and simply say...she broke every single one of them.  A lot.  When it finally got to the dismissal hearing that comes before the \"you're fired, GTFO\" letter, she told me going in that she wanted to run things, because she had some stuff she wanted to cover that she thought I probably wouldn't be a) comfortable doing (true, because it was irrelevant), b) didn't know much about (again, true, because she'd invented details, story, and witnesses as participants), and c) she felt like I wasn't really on her side in this to begin with (not quite true - she was a member, so my job is representation here).\n\nMe:  \"I really don't think that's a good idea.  I've done a lot of these, you should let me handle it.\"\n\nJackie:  \"No.  I know what I'm doing, and I talked with my attorney about this a lot.  You can't stop me.\"\n\nMe:  \"You're right.  I can't.  But this isn't going to go the way you think it will.\"\n\nJackie:  \"I know I'm right.  They can't do this to me.\"\n\nMe:  \"This isn't a good idea...but okay. It's your show.\"\n\nIn we went, and sat down.  The senior HR guy I mentioned earlier was there, and he gave me a funny look when I sat back, laptop closed, and said nothing - dismissal meetings are actually our meeting, and we get to run them from start to finish - they're there to listen.  She started talking...and I have to give them credit, they took notes, listened to the things she said, and kept straight faces the entire time.  It went exactly as I figured it would - just the things they'd asked her about in the *first* of the several meetings I attended with Jackie had covered terminable offenses on at least four or five different subjects, independent of one another.  At the end, when she finally wound down, they all turned to me (Jackie included) and asked if I had anything I wanted to cover or that I thought may have been missed.\n\n\"Nope,\" I said.  \"I think she covered everything already, I don't have anything to add.\"\n\nThat afternoon, I got the union copy of her dismissal notice.  Generally, they are open to at least discussing the option of the worker resigning, and giving them a neutral reference going forward, but that wasn't in the cards.  The last I had heard of Jackie, the Department of Justice was involved with her and her husband, and I'm reasonably confident that it didn't go well for her either.  I do know that she will never work for the government again, as the letter was pretty explicit about what information they would release to any government agency asking for a reference.  So it goes - they followed the collective bargaining agreement, terminating her with *ample* Just Cause.",

        "text": "This takes place about 5 years ago while I was still a cartwrangler at a local department store (I went out and got shopping carts, helped customers load their cars, etc.).\n\nThe cast is:\n\nI - me\nD - my best friend and coworker \nIB - Idiot boss\nLC - lead cashier\nUR - Union rep\n\n\n It was a typical Saturday and the store was absolutely packed with customers. Me and my best friend D were both assign assigned to work on the GM (general merchandise, not food) side of the parking lot. Part way through our shift a severe thunderstorm hits. High winds, heavy rain, lightning, etc. We get pulled in by LC, as one of the other workers had reported seeing lightning. Side note, our store's policy on thunderstorms is that no workers are allowed to go outside to get carts when lighting has been spotted, as the carts are metal, and we would essentially be moving lightning rods. IB comes storming out of her office and starts yelling at us for being inside, when it is clearly storming outside, with lightning. D and I told her that we were pulled inside because of the storm and that lightning had been spotted and reported to the lead cashier by a worker who had outside on their break. IB continues yelling at us saying that we are lying and just don't want to work in the rain, and that we are to go back outside to get shopping carts. D and I look at each other, giving each other a nod, knowing that we both were thinking the same thing. We tell her ok and head back out to get carts. A few loads of carts later, we each brought in a load around the same time, and we walked in on a yelling match between LC and IB. Apparently, LC had gotten ahold of our store's Union rep, and reported what IB had done. UR happened to be in the store attending a meeting with director over a certain matter, and was already on his way up to the front, and he did not look happy when he got there. He starts by asking LC what happened, and after LC finished explaining the situation, he pulled IB into her office and started to reprimand her, saying that her behavior is unacceptable, and that she had violated store and contract policy. IB came out of her office with her head hung low. UR came back out behind her and asked if D and I were alright. We both said we were. UR then told LC to be sure we are kept inside until the storm subsides, which she happily agrees to. Soon after, IB wound up getting demoted, and moved to a different department where she couldn't do anything like that ever again. \n\nIf she had just followed policy, IB would likely still be in her old position. I've since moved up from that position to Asset Protection/Loss Prevention, where I basically greet people who come in and make sure nobody gets out the door without paying for products. I still help out the cartwranglers as best I can, as I'm always stationed near where they put the carts, and it makes it a little easier on them. This may not have been the most exciting story, but it felt like we got a victory over our idiotic boss, since all we did was do as she said, and she paid for it.",

        "text": "I've told this story a few times elsewhere, but always get comments about posting here.\n\nBackground:\n\nMy ex and I were 3 months in to separation, as I kept suggesting divorce agreements, trying to find what she would accept other than \"take her back and return to bring a doormat for her.\" I have a good head for legal documents, and understood very early that as much as I would prefer to just burn everything down and disappear, legally it was very likely I was going to be paying alimony, and she was entitled to a fair share of everything. But in a no fault state with no gender preferences, it did mean a _fair_ share. It was clear that legally I would not get an approval for an agreement heavily biased in her favor. \n\nSo I kept re working and sending possible divisions. Every few days for months. She would object to anything that put any responsibility on her, anything that left something of value out of her hands. Any time I asked her what terms she would be ok with, she would just derail the conversation to something else.\n\nNot long into this I realized that I would need a paper trail, so everything went to email only. \n\nThrough all of this, I had recognized too that a court would order spousal support, so there wasn't any point in just cutting her off financially. Not a total doormat at this point though. I had moved my direct deposit to a solo account and kept up her weekly cash flow, and kept paying the bills. But my final offer in this period was the heavily unbalanced offer of splitting the cars one to each, me taking all the debt including her student loans, paying her $3-4k a month for a year so she could get her feet under her, and she gets all the \"stuff\". I walk away with my car, my dogs, some tools, and some clothes. No go. \"Not good enough for her\".\n\n---\n\nAnd so we get to the meat of the story for the MC.\n\n3 months in, I finally get her to agree to a mediator, since I'm getting nowhere. She shows up to the initial meeting, the first time we have seen each other in a while, the 2nd time since splitting. She was staying with her sister. The mediator starts out with the rules of mediation, and the agreements to sign. I sign easily, She balks, but signs it finally. One of the relevant terms is that we agree to not file any other legal paperwork. We would come to an agreement and the mediator would file the final court papers on both of our behalf to get the divorce ordered.\n\nThe mediator starts asking basic questions. And every question, to either of us, results in my ex launching into an irrelevant topic attempting emotional manipulation of me or him. I quickly resolve to grey rock her directly, and only direct my interactions to the mediator. I do my best to ignore her off topic ramblings, and reply to the mediator when she briefly crossed relevancy like someone falling from a tree and briefly being stopped by various branches on the way down.\n\nThe peak was when she literally crawled on top of the big table to stick her face in mine to \"force me\" to see her and engage in her ranting.\n\nThe mediator called it quits at that point. He reminded her of the rules she agreed to, gave us homework to fill out, and had us schedule the next meeting with his clerk, 2 weeks out.\n\n3 days later I get served with a summons to court for a hearing over spousal support. The summons shows the claim my ex made that all I had received from her in 3 months was $130. Oh boy. Not true at all. Not to mention in violation of the mediator terms.\n\nI end up on a conference call with the ex and the mediator as he tells her that she needs to withdraw the complaint or mediation can't continue. She adamantly insists that she knows her rights. So the mediator ends his involvement, cuts us refund checks minus time worked so far, and exits stage left.\n\nI prepare for the hearing. I print out 3 months of bank statements, and highlight every transfer to her. Every bill paid on her behalf. Every atm withdraw by her card. Over 100 toll bills I received from her just driving through express lane tolls so I got the elevated license plate fee mailed to me.\n\n $13,000 and change. \"You missed a couple zeros in your complaint\" I thought.\n\nMy final stack of paper was rather thick. So I made and printed an excel spreadsheet summary for the cover sheet. I also looked up the spousal support rules again. It is 40% of the difference between the income goes from the higher paid to the lower paid. Some little wiggle room, but that's it. Simple. She was currently getting up to 72% of my pay once you factored her bills in. This court hearing was a good thing. Not as good as a mediator and fast resolution, but I wasn't likely to end up screwed more here. Not to mention I had some daydreams of her finding out what lying on court documents might do.\n\nCourt date rolls around. I show up to court, waiting in the hall outside the family law section. She shows up and plops herself next to me to start going off on me again. I try to ignore her. Then to keep from engaging, I start a written transcript of her ranting using the back cover of my paperwork folder. Finally she realized what I'm doing and ends the ranting with: \"oh, I guess you are writing what I'm saying so you can make your friends hate me.\" (_They needed no encouragement_). She huffs a few seats away and is quiet the rest of the time we waited.\n\nThe court officer (_not a judge, just someone authorized to handle it since it is a simple and clear legal process_) finally comes to get us, and we head in. The officer starts the legal speeches, yada yada, then asks my ex if she has anything to add to the complaint. She launches into a rollercoaster speech proclaiming all my bad faults (_some of which were real_), how mean I was to try to divorce her, and how I obviously didn't need any of the money I made \"because he is just going to live somewhere simple and cheap anyway.\" Yeah, her words.\n\nThe court officer returns to the present like someone climbing down from the kitchen table after seeing a rat run by. And she asks me if I have anything I'd like to say. She can see the stack of paper, and eyeballs it as she is talking. I hand over the stack, tell the officer that the summary sheet on top should help clear up the financial points in question, and just verbally start going through the items. At each one, my ex interrupts to give a reason why that item shouldn't count. Every. Single. One. The officer keeps asking her to stop interrupting, but to no avail.\n\nWe finally finish the list. \n\nThe officer is shaking her head slightly and says: \"Mr Yen, this court process is to ensure that both parties are doing the right thing. So all of the\" and gestures to encompass the stack of paper, \"needs to stop _right now_. We will garnish your paychecks for the amount specified by law and send that to her instead.\"\n\nI know it's a win. I knew it was going to be. She didn't. She sat there all smug as we get into the calculations. I asked for a couple of adjustments, to keep the amount of her car payment since I cosigned and I wanted to be sure the bill was paid. I expected that she would refuse or overspend on other stuff and be unable to pay it. I didn't want to give her the power to trash my credit. The officer agreed. I then asked to keep the insurance payment amount too, for much the same reason. Also agreed by the officer. My ex continued to be smug. I know she was thrilled at the idea of getting a court check directly. It sure would show me!\n\nEverything wrapped up, we got the totals, signed papers, I handed over a check for the first payment, and the officer got up to make copies of everything. I asked the officer if I could wait in another room while she did, and got an agreement with a bit of side eye at my ex.\n\nI got my paperwork first, with the officer saying: \"it might take a few minutes for her to get her paperwork, but you are free to go.\" I got the hint and left immediately. I had parked a few streets away anyway, another barrier if she couldn't park near me.\n\nI got in my car and immediately called my cell carrier and cancelled her phone. \"Does she want to set up her own plan?\" \"I can't answer that. I am obeying a court order to remove her from my accounts.\" ,\"Okay.\" And worked down the remaining subscriptions I was paying for that she used. I even had the bills in front of me from court with account numbers and customer service numbers right there.\n\nI was done and driving home when she started blowing up my phone with incoming emails demanding to know what I was doing. Then texts from her sister's phone. Then calls. I just grinned and didn't answer any of them.\n\nShe stopped after an hour or so and gave me a few hours of silence. Then an all caps email with a screen shot of the Netflix inactive account message: \"OMG! EVEN NETFLIX!\"\n\nI admit I giggled.\n\nThe fallout wasn't over though. A month later after she realized how much less she has from me after \"winning\" her case, she files an appeal. It is denied due to lack of reason. A month later, she files a complaint that \"I wasn't paying her car payment\". Just an excuse to get into court. I had been paying it,  and I was also pretty confident that even if I hadn't she didn't know how to get into that loan's account (_she legally could, just never had cared to learn how_). I had a lawyer at this point, and we both go to court. She is going to join by phone. The officer paused before calling and tells my lawyer: \"this lady is a piece of work\". The validation of that statement will always remain with me.\n\nThe call goes predictably. My ex makes irrelevant rants. The officer keeps shutting her down. Finally asks my ex for proof that I wasn't paying the car payment ... as she is holding statements and check images proving I had. My ex nearly screams: \"I just know he isn't so he can hurt me!\" The officer replies: \"I am holding proof that he has paid it and is satisfying his legal obligation. The complaint is dismissed. Thank you.\" And hangs up on my ex.\n\n(_Divorce took another 10 months, lots more crazy, teaches her newbie lawyer a hard lesson, and I walked away with even less alimony than the spousal support, and only about 60% of the debt. I lost my dogs to her though, my only regret in the outcome. One is certainly past old age limits now, the other is in that range. I still miss them._)",

They gave me a good position and I work extra hours without expecting payment, taking into account my stock options and the fact that I love my job. I mostly work in a lab and don't have that much office work, but I occasionally need to do research at the office in front of my computer. However, last week, while we were moving to another lab, there wasn't much to do in the lab due to the transportation of tools. One of my bosses told me, \"Since you're free today, you could check this job.\" Firstly, I am almost never free and this made me feel as though they think I do nothing when I'm not in the lab. The word ‚Äúfree‚Äù makes no sense to me because i am not stupid to stay in the office in a flexible hour job where I already made 15 hours extra in this month without expecting extra.\nSecondly, it made me sad to hear something that implies I cannot determine my own priorities. I discussed this with some of my friends, who said it is a form of micromanagement, as I am not a new production worker or someone early stage of his career who requires assistance and guidance.\n\nI would like to know what others think before I talk to my boss, to make sure I am not overreacting.\n\nThanks",

        "text": "I bartend at a cash-only neighborhood dive bar in a major US City. We've been open for many decades and are about 70% regulars/semi-regulars, but the big exception to this is during the two street fests that happen outside our bar in the summer. These fests draw tens of thousands of people over a weekend from well outside the neighborhood, and are normally the only time you can walk around in public with booze in my city. These are also the only times we staff more than one bartender at a time; we'll normally staff all four of us together all weekend long to manage the volume.\n\nWe have a big sign behind the bar that says \"cash only please\" but during the fest we add a sign at the front door and, a few years ago, I got \"CASH ONLY\" printed on some t-shirts to share with my coworkers. Since then, I've been the only person to keep said shirt, because the only people who bother to read it are the regulars who already know, and it's a good laugh between us.\n\nThis past summer during the bigger of the two fests, I had a patron push his way up to the bar, literally elbowing a few other patrons waiting to order out of his way. He reaches over the bar and taps the bar maybe an inch from where my hand is holding a plastic cup that's in the middle of being filled. This was immediately two big strikes from me; don't try to cut the line, and don't get in my space/touch the bartender. I give him a look and he starts to order, and stops as he reads my shirt.\n\n\"Oh, you're cash only,\" he says, annoyed.\n\"Yes,\" I say, while finishing up with the patron whose drinks I had been making.\n\"That's okay, I'll wait for one of your coworkers then. I want to pay with a card.\"\n\nIt takes me a second to process what he's said, and I quickly turn away to avoid laughing in front of him. I quickly get and nudge my coworkers one by one. \"Hey, dude in $TShirt_Color  and khaki hat will only pay with a card, so don't serve him.\" They roll their eyes, and gently elbow me back out of their quarter(s) of the bar.\n\nI jump back into my space and resume taking orders from others around him. After about three or four patrons, he interrupts me to ask when someone will come to take his order. \"Sorry sir, I let my coworkers know you want to pay with a card,\" I say, and go back to ignoring him. He keeps getting more and more agitated until he finally bullies his way up to the bar in front of one of my other coworkers and tries this all over. When she tells him the whole bar is cash only and the business doesn't accept plastic, he gets bright red and comes back to scream at me. I just laugh and tell him I'd have happily corrected his mistake if he'd been even remotely respectful, but since he didn't show any respect for the time of our other patrons, I didn't think he wanted his time respected either.* He yelled once or twice more and finally stormed off.\n\n*I think what I actually told him was to F off, but my rose-tinted memory glasses remember saying this so let's roll with it.\n\nTold the owner what went down after we closed that night and we all had a big hearty laugh. Best part is, we may finally start selling 'CASH ONLY' shirts for the bar next summer, the first official shirt the bar's ever sold.",

After I dropped off the  chips and salsa, naming the mild and spicy, they asked if I had anything hotter.  After I took their drink order, I also got the cup of green chili salsa, the extra hot.  As   I approached the table, they asked me to find them some girls.   I told them that that was not on the menu, and set down the green chili salsa, took their order, and as they sampled the new hotter salsa,  they noted the heat.

We had a nice bottle of Tabasco ,  I got a scathing brilliant idea...   into a cup I poured half a bottle of Tabasco, several sloshes of the Green Chili salsa, and a dash regular hot salsa. Stirred, out I went to their table.  I dropped it and went to check on their meal.  When I returned to the table, the really creepy one asked in a rasping, gasping croak ,\" Got anything hotter?\"",

        "text": "  \n\nThis was a long time ago: my senior year of uni, moved into a house w/ 3 friends. Now, these friends had tuition paid for by their parents, me not so lucky. My parents didn't pay a dime. They even took me off their health insurance. So, I worked full-time as a cook.  During summers-worked about 60-70 hours a week to support myself &amp; pay tuition. \n\nI was a little bit of an outsider as these girls had already lived together the year before. Previous roommate moved in w/ boyfriend. I wanted a new place to live as my last landlord was very creepy. The girls tell me they have a chore chart. My parents were very strict &amp; made me work hard so, I‚Äôm familiar w/ chores. All goes well until we get to my week of \"the cook\". Now, I wasn't home that much because I was either working or in the library. As we didn't all have laptops to carry around to do research back in the day. Yes, I am old. I am \"The cook\" for the week. I like to cook &amp; I am good! At the restaurant, owner gives me food to take home. (He did this for me frequently as he knew my situation and I worked my butt off for him and he appreciated it.) I make a great dinner! Now I clean up as I cook. It makes things easier. So, I made a chick parm, with sauteed vegetables &amp; marinara. They loved it. Dinner‚Äôs was over, they left to relax. I go to study. My one roommate said, You can't leave the dishes. You have to clean up.\" I was like what? \"The cook\" cleans up. That's the rule. I said, You mean, I worked all day, and made a great meal and now I have to clean up the dishes too.\" They said yes that's the rule. I said you didn't tell me the rule. It's always been that way. I said \"Ok, tell me ALL the rules now, so I know them and start with the cooking rules.\" So, the rules were: leftovers are ok but you can't make the same meal every day, gotta have 1 healthy thing, gotta clean up after. Apparently, last roommate cooked tacos each meal for week &amp; was really messy. Next night, I reheat the leftovers. 3rd night, we have veggie soup &amp; sandwich. Girls were like what‚Äôs this? I said, It‚Äôs different and you have veggies. It‚Äôs within the rules. Easy clean up. They didn‚Äôt look happy but they ate it. 4th- chicken nuggets &amp; salad. 5th night oatmeal with their choice of fruit to top it. They started saying but you can make such great food! How come you aren‚Äôt cooking food like you did the first night? I said you guys work maybe 10 hours a week for fun money! I go to class, then work. I need to study. I am not busting my butt on a great dinner and then having to clean a bunch of dishes &amp; they weren‚Äôt Gordon Ramsey. The times I was home, they made frozen veggies &amp; chick. Nuggets. And I cleaned up after myself. I said, You want good food, clean up when I am done. I clean as I go &amp; there‚Äôs not much left when I finish. I said I wanted changes made to how they cleaned the bathroom, because they thought cleaning the bathroom was flushing the toilet.  So, they finally agreed to clean the dishes &amp; I showed them how clean a bathroom so it wasn‚Äôt gross. The next night we had gnocchi with grilled chick. Sundried tomatoes &amp; mushrooms. They agreed it was a good change.",

        "text": "As requested here is one of my other experiences...  I need to give a quick background to give some details about this though.  And sorry if this is a tad long, even after I removed some details that don't further the story.\n\nMy wife and I bought and existing retail business which had a previous employee that stole a customers credit card number and used that to buy drugs from some questionable over the phone pharmaceutical company.   This happened before we came along and she was gone by before we ever came into the picture.  We had 12 employees working for us that came with the purchase of the business so they we're familiar with what happened before so we had context.  \n\nEvery... and I do mean every... day, we get a call from this company asking for \"wicky\"... because they couldn't say Vicky.  So we knew right away what this call was about.  (and yes, that was the name, she was arrested and convicted, so there is no need to change it).   We had two front line people that would answer the phones so I never took the calls, but I'd hear about it from time to time.  We could not get them to stop.\n\nWe asked politely, we threatened them with recording, police, FBI, consumer affairs, etc.. Nothing.  We explained the \"wicky\" had stolen the credit card and is now in jail and stop calling.  Each time, they'd so ok, but then call back the next day or even the same day some times.  It was relentless.   This went on for over a year when I decided I'd finally heard about it enough and told my employees the next time they call, no matter what I'm doing, I am Vicky and to give me the phone.   I didn't have to wait long.\n\nThe call came and it was transferred to me and the fun began.   They confirmed I was Wicky and proceeded to ask if I wanted to buy some drugs.\n\nME: Yes! Absolutely. I need some.  What do you got?\n\nRX: Lipitor\n\nME: yes\n\nRX: Prilosec\n\nME: Yes\n\nRX: Hydrocodone\n\nME: Absolutely\n\n(repeated for basically everything they listed... went on for about 25 or so minutes back and forth with medications, having them spell it out since \"I didn't understand\" what it was, dosages, etc..)\n\nME: How about some Meth?\n\nRX: What?\n\nME: Meth!, Nose candy? 8 Balls?\n\nRX: No, we don't have those\n\nME: Speed, Crank... I really could use some Crank!\n\nRX: No!, we don't sell those\n\nME Hash, M.J.?  weed?\n\nRX: No nothing like that\n\nME: Fish tranquilizers?\n\nRX: What? No.\n\nME: Oh, damn.  Well ok, I guess thats enough then\n\nRX: Ok, well great.  We just need a credit card to complete the order.\n\nME: Ohhhhh... yeahhhh.  I don't give out my credit card over the phone.  I don't feel safe doing that with all the online crime lately.  Can I send you a check?\n\nRX: No, we need a credit card\n\nME: I don't want to give that out over the phone.  Someone could be listening.\n\nRX: Oh, no need to worry about that Sir, our phone calls are encrypted!\n\n(Background on me: one of my past jobs was selling the hardware the early stages of the internet used.  So this got me going as it's obviously  not possible unless both ends are using specialize equipment.)\n\nWe spent a while going back and forth on what solution they were using to encrypt the calls which was complete bullshit of course.  I could go on for a while on this part but it gets tedious.  Anyway I got transferred up the line two times because they wouldn't accept my offer to send them a check, they needed a credit card.   I even offered to send them a check, and then they could wait for it to clear and THEN send me the drugs.  \n\nThis actually got the guy to start yelling  \"no no No No NO!!!!!  We need a credit card\"  (I can still hear that in my head to this day and it was almost 20 years ago and I smile every time)  At this point, I'm near the 1 hour mark with these guys which was my target so I said...\n\n\"OK, listen up fuck tards... I've been fucking with you guys for the past hour.  You've been calling us every day for over a year now trying to sell us drugs.  We've tried everything to get you to stop but you keep calling.   So from now on, when you call, I'm going to drop everything and spend as much time on the phone as possible with you guys JUST to fuck with you.   I am going to eat up as  much time as possible to make your lives a living hell.  So keep calling because this is now a game to me, and as you can tell... I'm enjoying the shit out of this.\"\n\nThey hung up.  Shocking.  But... they called back the next day.  Rinse and repeat.  Again they hung up.  Then a few days went by and I thought they'd learned their lesson.  I was wrong... they did call back, but the list of drugs was a lot smaller now.  So the time spent was a lot less before they caught on, but the game was still on.  It took another 2 or 3 calls and the list kept shrinking and then finally they were done.  \n\nThe calls were finally gone... and I never did get my 8 Ball!",

In 2013 2014, i was a senior in high school, and my now ex (We will call her lisa) went to different high schools. About 20 miles apart. We met online talked and started dating. We talked away after 4 months but got back together after about 6 months. There were no hard feelings over the first break up cause we didn't have the time to see one another. We were a year apart, so we were able to go to one another graduations. It was actually nice she was sweet and caring back then.  We would talk every day and hangout atleast 3 or 4 times a week. \n\nAfter lisa graduated, she got accepted to a university one town over from me, and her 1st semester was amazing as we would spend nights in her dorm together and if we went to work while she was at class.  Lisa got a part-time job at a pizza shop, and I'd drive her and get pizza. It was simply young love or so, i thought.  As coworkers do, she began hanging out with some of hers after work. Didn't bother me i would go see my friends and let her have fun. They would smoke and drink. And the one night she tried to coke. I was uneasy and told her i wasn't thrilled, but she was honest and kept it away from me, and college stuff like that happens. \n\nAt this point, lisa and i have been together for just over 2 years. One afternoon, i dropped her off at the train station on campus for her to go meet friends in the city for the weekend and id pick her up sunday. Well, lisa met a drug dealer who ended up at the same party. I was told years later that they hit it off and started talking. Lisa's habits got worse and worse. By this time , i started working night shifts, so i wasn't sleeping over much unless it was a weekend when she wasn't busy with studying.\n\n For the next 2 and a half years, she was sleeping over his house when i wasn't around and sleeping with him while we would hang out during the day and have some fun of our own. I started to figure out she was cheating but thought i was insecure. We started fighting more and yelling at one another over every little thing. She would cuss me out if i didn't come over with alcohol when she demanded and would tell me shed give me the money but never did. After a few times, i just took the money out of her wallet or shoe box where she hid cash. I never told her i took the money. I'd just take 40 out cause she didn't have the extra 1 dollar and 15 cents, so i started rounding it up. Or I'd take it out of her bank account when she sent me to get money for her so she could buy more coke or pills. \n\nShe got me to go meet her dealer whom i became friends with quickly, and i told him of Lisa's plan to rob him for drugs and money. As he went to another room to get her bag for me to give her, i told him im not doing blow. So if he wants the money to put some extra baking soda or flower in there for me. He smoked me up and gave me fake drugs for her, which pissed her off. I would also pocket the money cause her dealer didn't want 20 dollars for just baking soda. \n\nLisa's dealer later sees her with her other boyfriend and texts me. Lisa tells him that she was dating the other guy for 2 and a half years, and she never dated me  at that point we had been together for going on 5 years. I was crushed. I sat there thinking about how low things have fallen and felt like i was to blame. I let myself be in a mentally and physically abusive relationship. She was using me, and i ignored it. My friends felt they couldn't tell me cause I wouldn't listen. My family hated her. \n\nI stayed for 6 months after that to get my revenge. I would take money as often as i could. There are upwards of over 1000 in a short while from her bank, wallet, and shoe box. \n\nHer aunt left her a car, and she didn't have a license, so i gave an anonymous tip about it. The car was impounded, and she was given a fine. I picked her up to see her crying and loved every second of it. When she got the car back, i put sugar in the gas tank so it wouldn't start and was ruined, and she blamed the lot that impounded the car but didn't have proof.\n\nFinally, the summer was over, and it was time for her to move back into college for her last year or so, she thought. I took 2 overtimshifts that day, so i couldn't help her move to which lisa threw the biggest fit she ever had. I found out her other boyfriend wasn't allowed on campus for being caught with a pund of weed, pills, and a little bit of coke. So lisas family moved her in, and that night, i went to see her cause she left stuff in my car, and she had some of my hoodies. As i bring it in, she tells me to put her shit down and leave for she's having people over, and she needs to shower. So as she hops in, i put her stuff down, grab my hoodies, and anything thats mine to include her tv xbox, all the games, and her tablet that i paid for with my own money. I also take pictures of a few bags of weed pills and coke with her student id badge, go into the bathroom, and tell her im leaving. She just says to leave. No, i love you. No drive safe or see you later. \n\nOn my way out, i stopped at the campus police station and reported it. I show them the pictures and what room. They go check it out, and her roommate let them in. They had me ID her so they knew they got the right person. Watching her cry was satisfying, and i couldn't help but smile. Well, her other man wasn't to please for having his gf kicked out of college and threatened me with violence. I spent 3 hours on the phone with him telling him how lisa and i were together for 5 years as of a month prior before that. We slowly put things together and realized how she played him for drugs and me for rides. \n\nI heard on the news they had a fight, and lisas other boyfriend was arrested for domestic violence and assult of a police officer. I felt bad for him cause he got 10 years from his anger, assult, domestic abuse, drugs, and an unregistered firearm. I dont feel bad for her getting beat by her other boyfriend or being kicked out of school her final year. Shortly after i met another woman who i vented to about all of this and i am now together with for over 3 years whos shown me i am worth more than that bitch and deserve to be happy. \n\nIts never ok to hit your significant other nor to verbally abuse them. Trust me, if you feel like your not worth loving, you are wrong. I never with anytbing ive gone through on anybody when it comes to a relationship. I wish i had left when she started doing blow but i didnt. You are worth more than those who abuse you. As for Lisa. I heared she was kicked out of her parents house and was in a drug house sleeping around for money, idk how true but one can hope.",

        "text": "First time posting here so sorry for the length. TLDR at bottom.\n\nI‚Äôve been reading these MC posts and lamenting that a have nothing to share when I remembered my own story from when I was a young Airman First Class (A1C) stationed at Davis-Montham AFB in Tucson AZ back in 1997/98 working graveyard shift (midnight to 7am) as an AGE Mechanic. At the time I was not a coffee drinker and had never even made a cup in my life (important point for story) in fact my first cup wasn‚Äôt until about 2004 when I was a SSgt stationed at Cannon AFB in NM and have been hooked ever since.\n\nOn to the story, I was assigned to a Combat AGE Team (CAT) the folks that support all flight-line equipment, and our boss was a Master Sergeant (MSgt) that was known for being a real prick for no good reason. He was a chain smoker and a caffeine addict. One day at the end of my shift he calls me into the office and wants to know why there was no coffee in the coffee pot when he came in. I informed him that I don‚Äôt drink coffee so I have no reason to make it. He tells me that when he comes in the next day there had better be a full pot waiting for him and everyday after too. I told him I had never made coffee to which he dismissed me with a barking order to have coffee made for him. \n\nNow it‚Äôs important to note that while he was my MSgt the military or the Air Force at least frowns on sergeants using airman as their personal gophers in this way.\n\n\nCue MC, that night I asked the shift sergeant how to make coffee, he asks what do I mean? It‚Äôs so simple, filter grounds, water airman, seriously!?! He also asks why I need to know as I don‚Äôt drink the stuff. I tell him and he informs me that the MSgt can‚Äôt order me to make it, but I say it‚Äôs no problem really.\n\nWell I do what I‚Äôm told, a full pot right? So 12 cups water in the maker, filter in the holder but how much grounds??? Well I figure, the pot was full of water so the filter must have to be full with coffee right?\n\nI filled that filter to the top, packed it down a bit and filled it up again. Just before 1st shift came in I turn it on and wait.\n\nFrom outside the shop I see MSgt come is, see the coffee and grin the shit-eating grin he was known for, pour himself a full cup (he took it black) and take a good hearty swig‚Ä¶. and spew it straight back out all over the table and floor. I watched him clean it up take the pot and pour it out and look at the filter with a look on his face that clearly said ‚Äúthat stupid airmen‚Äù.\n\nWhen I walked in after I stopped laughing and crying he called me over and told me I was never allowed to make coffee again, for life.\n\nNow I own a coffee maker that grinds its own beans and I‚Äôve become a bit of a coffee snob so I can only imagine how terrible the concoction I made tasted all those years ago.\n\nTLDR: Sergeant forces me to make coffee and as a non drinker I MC‚Äôd a full pot of complete coffee sludge with as much grounds as the filter would hold and still let water pass through.",

Instead of cutting the end of the bag, I cut off the side of the bag, making it virtually impossible to store them in the bag. I then took them to my dad and presented him with his request. He had no response as he knew he hadn't specified which way to open the bag, while my mom was next to him crying from laughter. I later saw the Hershey eggs in a tupperware in the candy drawer.

The boss of my boss's boss was begging people to take voluntary leave and draw unemployment to save money. When I mentioned that to my supervisor, she said they already had enough people going out and they weren't letting anyone else take the leave.  \n\n\nI went to my boss's boss, and unsurprisingly, she was floored to learn I had been discouraged from offering and immediately agreed for me to go out on voluntary leave and was so grateful!

Boss still micromanaged every chance she got but a year later I applied for a job that is much more prestigious and pays better with much more flexibility.\n\nTLDR: Boss refused to give me one week, took voluntary leave and was gone a month.",

        "text": "In college I worked at the front desk for a dorm. Most of the time it was a chill job. I worked nights and just had to help the occasional drunk student after they lost their keys. However, once a year we had to deal with the worst of the worst - move out. Anyone that‚Äôs ever experienced move out day knows the absolute shit show it is. \n\nDuring move out the supervisors scheduled double the people at the front desk, so I had to work during the day. Our front desk was in the main community space for the dorms. Out front of the space was a super small lane that led to the parking garage. Everyone that needed to get to the parking garage had to use this lane. My whole shift was going fairly well, just small complaints about moving bins and our ‚Äúlack of resources‚Äù for the summer heat. So far so good - or so I thought. \n\nUp walks this family - a mom, dad, and daughter that were clearly annoyed. My three other coworkers were busy, so it was up to me to help this family. \n\nMe: ‚ÄúHi, what can I help you with?‚Äù\n\nMom (in a snippy tone): ‚ÄúI was stung by a bee. I need some medical assistance.‚Äù \n\nNow, as a student worker, the last thing I was allowed to do was provide medical care of any kind - couldn‚Äôt even hand out a bandaid.\n\nKnowing I can‚Äôt help, I reply: ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm sorry to hear that! As a desk worker, I‚Äôm not able to provide medical assistance but‚Äî‚Äú \n\nDaughter cuts me off impatiently: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even have a first aid kit? Can‚Äôt you just give us something to help?‚Äù \n\nI would‚Äôve assumed they were worried about the mom‚Äôs health, but at this point they sounded more upset that they weren‚Äôt getting their way. \n\nMe: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have first aid kits because I‚Äôm not allowed to administer aid. If you‚Äôd like to get help, I would recommend walking over to health services.‚Äù \n\nDaughter (sounding progressively more entitled and annoyed): ‚ÄúYou want us to walk ALL the way over to health services?‚Äù \n\nAt this point all I wanted was for them to leave, but I couldn‚Äôt say that. \n\nMe: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs also an urgent care and hospital right off campus if you‚Äôre worried about a reaction.‚Äù \n\nMom: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not driving all the way over to a hospital I just need help now. Can you call someone for help or something?‚Äù \n\nCue the malicious compliance. Normally I would call our non-emergency number for assistance, but this family CLEARLY wanted quality care. \n\nMe: ‚ÄúWould you like me to call 911? I can see if they‚Äôll help.‚Äù\n\nMom: ‚ÄúYes! Do something!‚Äù\n\nSo, I call 911. The operator asks about the emergency, and I explain it‚Äôs a bee sting. \n\nOperator: ‚ÄúAre they allergic?‚Äù \n\nI ask the mom and she says ‚ÄúWell, no but it‚Äôs hurting.‚Äù\n\nOperator: ‚ÄúDo they have tweezers they could use to pull out the stinger?‚Äù\n\nI ask the family and to this the daughter snaps ‚ÄúWhy would we have tweezers? Of course we don‚Äôt have tweezers! What kind of question is that!‚Äù \n\nI relayed the message to the operator and let her know the family specifically requested medical care. She sighed, clearly annoyed by this non-emergency and let me know she sent help. At this point my line is getting incredibly long, so I ask the family to step to the side. \n\nWhen I tell them help is on the way the mom asks ‚ÄúWhat are they sending?‚Äù\n\nMe: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù \n\nMom: ‚ÄúWell I hope it‚Äôs not a fire truck. That would be so embarrassing for just a bee sting.‚Äù\n\nA few minutes go by, and I can tell the mom is starting to realize she may have overreacted. She tries to tell her family they can just leave, but the dad and daughter reminded her they are already sending someone. \n\nAs they wait, up comes a MASSIVE fire truck, sirens blaring. All the other families at the front desk (which is a lot because this family held up the line) turn to see what‚Äôs going on. The mom is absolutely MORTIFIED. She is looking around, trying to hide behind her family - it‚Äôs hilarious. She meets emergency services outside, so they don‚Äôt make a big scene in front of the other families. The best part? The fire truck had to stop in the teeny tiny lane out front our community center - completely blocking the way into the parking garage. This means a line of cars was building up while she got her bee sting treated. With each car joining the line she looked more and more embarrassed. Once she was treated they came back in to get to the daughter‚Äôs dorm. They walked quickly and avoided eye contact, clearly embarrassed by the overreaction. \n\nI hope they‚Äôve learned to stop with the impatience and entitlement. As much as I hate calling 911 for trivial things, it was worth it to see the look of sheer humiliation on the mom‚Äôs face. And I like to think the operator was looking out for me in fulfilling my malicious compliances to the highest degree.",

About a month later, my \"fun\" began.\n\nI started getting a call about every two or three weeks wanting to know if I'd like to re-subscribe to their services.  They could offer me a 6 month discount, etc... I explained to them I sold the car and the radio with it, so I no longer had a radio.  I was polite the first few times.  Rude a few times after.  Didn't even answer the phone sometimes.  Threatened them with consumer affairs.   Nothing seem to work.   But every answer was the same from me: \"I don't have a satellite radio anymore\"  and they all said they'd remove me from their call list.  This went on for about 8 months until I changed my tactic.  \n\nI was working on a project and \"the call\" came in so I answered.  The usual sales pitch started up with the guy wanting to know if I'd like to resubscribe for their services and could offer a welcome back discount.  So I stopped what I was doing and said \"OK, sure.  Sign me up\".  He got happy and started going through all the options and upsells.  And everything he tied to sell me I said \"yes, that sounds great\".  I chose the most expensive package, and the GPS traffic updates for the navigation systems, etc.  Whatever they had I took it.  He gathered all my details, address, email, all which they already had anyway.  The whole process took about 20 minutes.  Then came the part I was waiting for... \n\nXM: \"Ok, we're all set, I just need the radio ID from your radio?\"  \n\nME:  I don't have one\n\nXM: (silence.....) what?\n\nME: I don't have a satellite radio\n\nXM: So why do you want to sign up for our services?\n\nME: I don't.\n\nXM: But you said you did\n\nME: I know.  But for the past 8 months I've been telling you that I don't have a radio and to stop calling, but you keep calling.  So I thought maybe you guys knew something I didn't.\n\nXM: Unless you have a radio, you can't sign up for our servies\n\nME: Then maybe you guys should stop calling me.  \n\nNever heard from them again.",

We travel to the nearest metro station and take a cab to the audit location. In the evening the client was supposed to provide transportation till the metro (since no cabs are available there). My seniors (who did the audit last year) informed me that the client provided them transportation last time and they would do the same this year too.  \n\n\nCut to: I go to the audit location on 1st day and they figured out that this was my first audit. In the evening when it was time to leave, we asked them to arrange transportation, they said they can't provide transportation and that they are not even contractually liable to do so. When we asked they provided last year, what happened now? They told us that it was out of their good hear they provided last year and they can't now. We had walk till the nearest bus stop (not even an official one, kinda informal one - just that buses are known to stop there). I called my seniors on the way home and told them what happened, they said they might be picking on us since we are new.  \n\n\nI go the next day to audit, took a cab same as yesterday. During the audit I found out that few bills are reimbursed beyond limit say 10 or 20 bucks (not a big deal, it is just pocket change.) Generally bills are reimbursed in full even if they are few bucks above stipulated limit, kinda like rounding off. No one cares, these are generally looked over, but I thought FUCK them. Around afternoon I showed what I found and asked them for explanation. Initially they laughed it off, said it was a small thing and said it was not material enough. They said it was a common practice and they have been doing it for years. But I argued that how does doing it for a long time make it right and it was **written that** they can't reimburse beyond limits. When added together they would make a considerable sum and I would go through last 7 year records and add them to prove my point. They didn't say anything, In the evening they just informed us that the transportation is ready.  \n\n\nNote: Even when we add all the previous years, I know the observation wouldn't make it to the final report because it is not material enough when compared with the turnover of the company. I know that, they don't know that.   \n\n\nWhen I told my seniors what happened on the second day on the way home, they laughed their ass off and told me 'now you are an auditor son' and that it how you earn respect in this profession.",

My manager lectured me but I'm off the clock so he should have shoved it until I came in.\n\nMy manager didn't tell me that a shift I had picked up was covered so I spent a total of 2 hours there and back to work for nothing(public transportation; waiting an hour to go somewhere isn't unusual).\n\nReported him to the DM. They paid me for the entire shift i never worked plus an extra 25% to compensate for the public transportation fees(which was only a few bucks tbh).\n\nMy manager then started to schedule me almost no hours. And then my shift supervisor started sexually harassing me(I like sliding in/I like coming inside/you have the body for an only fans/your body must get a lot of attention).\n\nNot only did my manager do nothing, he zeroed out my hours for several weeks. So I reported him again. And this time he got fired and I'm likely getting workers compensation because of it.\n\nWhat's sad is that I tried so hard to believe he was a good person and that I was misunderstanding him. He gave me an excuse that he was trying to help me so I didn't have to work in an uncomfortable environment. I told him specifically to add me back in, and he didn't. \n\nAt some point I realized that he's a cruel horrible person for giving me no hours. I'm a college student paying for everything on my own. I literally can't eat or pay rent off of that. He never deserved the benefit of the doubt. But at least I'm getting extra money and he's getting fucked with getting fired.",

Kinda long, just fyi.\n\n About 8 years ago, i had worked for a big communications company on the sales floor. People  would come into the store and get their cell phones, tv, internet. Internet and tv were huge payouts for the sales reps so everyone wanted those. I was new on the floor maybe 2 weeks in. Still learning the ropes. We would take turns at the door. Rotate between who would help the customer. So, its my turn and this guys comes in and i say welcome to so and so how can i assist you today? He announces he would like to get tv service. That's when my coworker gets up from sitting down brushes past me and says i can help you with that and snags my customer. I was livid. My other coworkers are looking like omg she did not just do that to you. She apparently had a track record of being the bitch on the sales floor. Me being the bigger person let it slide at the moment but started planning my revenge. She didnt know me and i definitely dont look intimidating so she thought she could get away with it. For the next couple of weeks i would play dumb and ask her for help. When a customer would come in with an issue or concern, obviously not something anyone could make money on, i would state loudly that she was our senior tech and would be the best fit to help them. Even when we got busy i would sign people into the que under waiting for her. The other sales people caught on and started doing the samething. She started dropping on the sales board and was causing a Karen of a situation with the management. On our team meeting she was getting irrate and started yelling at us for sending so many concerns to her. Saying it was taking all of her time up to make any sales and to quit doing it. The managers asked what exactly is going on. In the most calm way i told them this is the best example of fuck around and find out. Explained to them all what was going on during the time they werent around. How she would steal sales from others and what had happened that first time she tried to fuck me over because i was new. She never caught on that we did it on purpose. She was so pissed and management sent her home for the day after having a long meeting with her. When she came back she didnt say a word to us but started respecting the door rotation. She never made it back in top sales for the 3 years i was there which was a clear indication that she had been stealing sales and being shady for years prior. That also killed her chances in getting a management position.",

        "text": "The \"5 minute early\" post reminded me of a story that happened to a friend of mine, let's call him \"Bobby\".  \n\nBobby was a CNC machinist, a good one, and the only one. The company he worked for made an intricate product, and his CNC part was crucial. The rest of the product bolted on to it. The finished product sold for tens of thousand of dollars.  \n\nIt took 3 hours to make this piece. Bobby would make 3 a day, he'd make one in the morning, take his coffee break, then make another, and take his lunch break. That ate up about 6.75 hours. He'd stay late to make the third part, and make 2 hours OT.  \n\nHis new foreman turned out to be more than a bit of a jerk. He'd try to get Bobby to do other tasks, and Bobby said no, as he needed to monitor the CNC machine during all stages of the cycle. Foreman bitched to the Plant Manager, who told him to back off and leave Bobby alone.  \n\nOne day there was a bad snowstorm, and Bobby was 10 minutes late. The Foreman was there to greet him at the time clock, with a shit-eating grin on his face, holding a Demerit Slip. Bobby had clocked in a minute late the previous week, and the Union rules said that if you were late twice within 14 days you got 20 demerit points.  \n\nBobby and Foreman got into a bit of an animated conversation, and the Union Steward came over and said that Bobby had no choice but to take the demerit hit.  \n\nSo Bobby went to work. His shift was 8am to 4:30pm, but he usually stayed until 6:30 to finish the last part. Not today. At 4:30 he shut the machine down and headed for the door.  \n\nThe next morning, Foreman comes over and says that the assembly team is short a part.  \n\n\"Yeah, I know. I'm working on it right now. It'll be done in 2 hours.\"  \n\n\"But they need 3 a day. Why didn't you make 3 of them yesterday?\"  \n\n\"Because my shift is over at 4:30, and I went home.\"  \n\n\"What? You stay every night until the third part is finished.\"  \n\nBobby pulled the Demerit Slip out of his shirt pocket, looked Foreman in the eye, and said, \"Not any more.\" Bobby had done the math. Every week, instead of getting 15 parts, they were getting 10 or 11.\n\nForeman tried to sweep it under the rug, but within a few days chaos ensued. The assemblers had no core part, and their team went to the Plant Manager to let him know that production was falling. They assemblers liked it....the got to hang around yakking while they waited for the next CNC part to arrive.  \n\nEventually, there was a meeting with Plant Manager, Foreman, Union Steward, and Bobby. Foreman tried to throw Bobby under the bus saying that he refused overtime. Union Steward pointed out that, as per the contract, mandatory overtime was only in case of emergencies, and this wasn't an emergency. Bobby had every right to decline the OT.  \n\nForeman lost his temper, started yelling at Bobby and Union Steward, and was asked to leave the meeting. Plant Manager knew he was screwed, and looked at Bobby and asked, \"What's it going to take to get you to work the overtime?\"  \n\nBobby smiled, and replied, \"As long as Foreman is my supervisor, I won't be working a minute of OT.\"  \n\nAnd that was the last anyone saw Foreman.  \n\nBy sticking to the contract, Bobby cost the company a handful of parts worth many of thousands of dollars, and put the company into a position where their lowered production would cost them even more...in perpetuity. Bobby worked a couple of Saturdays to catch up, and made double-time for those shifts.  \n\nThey hired a new Foreman, who was explicitly instructed, \"Do not, under any circumstances, fuck with Bobby.\"",

This last year we upgraded to a new Fifth wheel, the manufacturer has been reputable but the facility that built ours did a really bad job of installing 3 windows. I called the place I purchased the trailer from to get warranty work performed. They had a 3-month wait to get our trailer into the shop to be fixed. Their suggestion was to tarp over the windows and 3 months bring the trailer to the shop for them to keep for 2 weeks to fix. Being the resourceful person I am, I called a local guy in our area that does mobile RV repair. He said he did not do the warranty work but could write up his invoice to meet the manufactures requirements to be reimbursed for his invoice. \n\nSo I called the Manufacture to confirm that they would do this and they said they need some additional paperwork which I could provide. \n\nThe mobile guy comes out does his troubleshooting and finds the window seals are not installed correctly. So he instructs me to take pictures of everything he is doing, I follow him and take about 100 pictures. Showing the shoddy craftsmanship of the trailer. I upload these pictures to my google drive and create a shared folder with the warranty email I am supposed to send the pictures and invoice. \n\nI test the share from an incognito window to confirm anyone could access the pictures with the link. I am like okay they can access everything so I will go ahead and send the link and invoice. \n\nFast forward 2 weeks and I get an email from the manufacturer, stating that I will need to send the images as a PDF. \n\nI comply and create a PDF with all 100 photos, I go to share it, and Google uploads the file and sends it, again as a link to my google drive as the file is 200 Mb.  \n\nThis morning I get a reply, you are going to need to send the PDFs as actual attachments I cannot download the pdf you sent me. \n\nSo I created 73 individual emails with the same statement in each \"Please see attached pdf as requested 1 at a time.\"\n\nI guess I will have to wait and see if they refund my warranty work.",

When the internet company came out to do the installation, I had the option of renting a router from them or buying one.  Either way, they'd hook it up for me.  I had gotten one with my computer, so I had them use that.  They were having trouble getting it to connect (I forget now exactly why), so they hooked up one of their rental ones temporarily then switched it to mine.\n\nA few months later, I started getting calls from them that warned me to stop spamming people.  I went back and forth with them on this, insisting that I wasn't spamming nor would I ever do that.  They kept on insisting I was.  I always unplugged my computer when I was out of the apartment for the day, so one day I called them on my lunch break at work after getting a vm from them.  I asked the tech if they could see the computer right then.  They said they could, and I told them sarcastically that they must be magicians then because it wasn't on or even plugged in right then.  They kept insisting that someone else in my house was using it or someone was spoofing it.  I told them that couldn't be the case and that they were welcome to disconnect the router as they kept threatening to do.\n\nWhen I got home, I still had internet service.  I called them and read off my router number to them to verify that it was what they had thought they shut off.  At the same time I was talking with a tech, another tech sitting near them was trying to calm down a very angry man whose router hadn't been working for the better part of the day and was trying to troubleshoot it.\n\nYep, the one they were logging as spamming was the temporary one they attached and then were supposed to have cleared out when they disconnected it from my system.  My system's info was still on it when they leased it out to the angry guy, who was the one spamming people.",

The #% Net Terms on their purchase orders did match whatbwe have on contract, but didn't match what was showing up on our order-entry and confirmation screens for their customer account.  At first it was as simple as correcting the credit terms on the orders in our system to match what we have on contract with the customer, and informing Finance that we saw some wrong credit terms showing up on our orders.  We thought thid was a fine workaround until our electronic system was updated with thebcorrect credit terms.  This was met with a strong \"NO! Your department DOES NOT adjust credit terms on orders. You will ask the customer to update their Purchase Orders, and you will not enter any of their orders until their POs match what our system shows.\"\n\nMind you, this is for one of our biggest customers.  10's of Millions of $ annually.\n\nSo, my manager came to the conclusion that we need some grease, so it's time to make the wheels squeek.  *Cue Malicious Compliance...* \n\nSeeing that Finance wasn't actuallly updating our systen, and instead ordered us to reject the custoner orders until THEY changed the credit terms on their orders, my manager gave me a directive (in writing; he knew it was respectful to not throw me under the bus for this):  \"Your instructions are to reject the customer's orders, and request they change their credit terms to what the system says it should be.\"\n\nI grinned.  He grinned.  I knew what was gonna happen.  He used me like the tool I am, and it was 100% consentual :-)  \n\nI started rejecting ALL of their orders and asked their buyers to \"update\" the credit terms on their Purchase Orders to what was, frankly, wildly wrong terms and not close to what we had on contract with them.  It wasn't long before a deluge of irrate emails came pouring in from the customer, agrily demanding why we were making them change credit terms, how there were absolutely no negotioations held about changing credit terms, asking why an order entry agent was essentially dictating major financial matters, and how this was wildly unprofessional of us.  \n\nWhen word got around that some lowly Customer Service agent was telling our customer to change their credit terms,  I just showed the email saying \"my boss told me to do it\" and my boss then pulled out his emails and said \"Finance Department told me that they wanted my department to do this.\"\n\nWouldn't'cha know, less than a day later the customer's credit terms were updated in the system to what they should be.\n\nCondensed: Finance didn't do their job,  ordered Customer Service to do the wrong thing, made themselves look like fools, and, my boss is a hoot.",

We are to ask the field personnel for a root cause. \n\nThat same shift, I had to call out a particularly prickly individual, and when the issue was resolved he informed me about what repair he performed.\n\nIt made sense to me, however, I informed him that I had to ask him what he believed what the root cause was for the equipment failure.\n\nHe said ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs old and shitty and needs to to be replaced.‚Äù\n\nI asked if it was okay if I paraphrased the swearing, he said it was.\n\nSo my update read something to the effect of ‚ÄúRoot cause was deemed to be really old equipment in poor condition.

        "text": "A few years ago, I was moving my business to a new location that needed 6 months to be built out.  I informed out current alarm company a few months before the move that we'd be moving services which for whatever reason they couldn't do.  I had to open a new site on the account and then I could close the old when after the move.  Sure, that's fine.  \n\nThey got all the details and sold me the newer system that would be connected to the internet so I could monitor it from my phone.   Sounds great.  So they told me they could install it next week but I had to have the internet setup and running before they could do it.    I informed them the phones lines  and internet would not be installed until later as I didn't want to pay for services we were not using and I would let them know when that was installed so they could come out for their install.  Everything satisfied the call was complete.  \n\nA few days later, I started getting weekly phone calls from their installers telling me they were on their way to the new site to do the install.  To which I had to go through the explanation of the internet won't be installed until later and that I would call THEM and let them know when that was done.  Each time they so \"Oh, ok.  Sounds good, we'll wait to hear from you\".  But then the following week, it would repeat again.  \n\nOn the 6th week, I got the same weekly call from the alarm company installer.  \"Hi, this is Jim, just letting you know well be at your site in about 30 minutes to do the install.\"  So this time I said \"ok\".   We hung up and I went back to work, which was happening at our current location.  No workers or work was happening at the new site on this day.  \n\nAbout 30 minutes later I got a call from Jim saying the doors are locked and nobody is answering.  I said I know, nobody is there today and the internet won't be installed until next month anyway.  At this point he starts getting agitated with me and asked why I scheduled an install for today and why I told him I'd be there when he called.\n\nI explained: \"I didn't. YOU said you'd be there in 30 minutes.  I said OK\".  Amazingly, the calls stopped and I called them a couple weeks before the move and they came out and installed just fine.",

        "text": "This is long so bare with me.\n\nI work at a fast food store, and during the holidays hours had been cut for slow business. I work the closing shifts, and I‚Äôm usually by myself when dealing with rushes or when it comes to closing down the store. So I have been trying to preclose when I come in for my shift. This may include restocking and change use by dates. Or cleaning out the toppings and placing it in a tub then replacing it back into the fridge. Sometimes it gets messy since I‚Äôm the only one there but I try my best to do it when there‚Äôs no one in front of me. With the exception of a few. \n\nOne day I come in and my shift leader tells me I can‚Äôt preclose any later than 9:00 (we close at 10:15) but for one person alone to clean the entire front is insane. I‚Äôd never leave. My manager printed out an entire sheet and you had to go through the entire list before actually starting to close. And even if you finish everything on the list if it wasn‚Äôt 9:00 you still couldn‚Äôt preclose. \n\nHere‚Äôs the malicious compliance; my coworker is the one who taught me the method of pre closing so we can get out at 10:45 instead of 12. I refuse to do anything but what was in front of me. My job was to serve the customers. Not to be prepping food. Or cooking the food. So I didn‚Äôt help out at other stations like I use to. I made sure my station was prim and proper. Glass shield so clean it looked like it wasn‚Äôt even there. When there was a rush I took my time with each customer and really got to know them as some are regulars. But because I am the only one in the front I usually rush to kill my line. So no I‚Äôm not all smiles and conversation as we got lectured on. \n\nBecause I did this, I didn‚Äôt get to start closing until after closing time. Which meant I didn‚Äôt leave til 12:30. \n\nSo because you wouldn‚Äôt let me stick to my preclosing routine, which got me out faster and cost you less money. I‚Äôm milking every minute to abide to your rules. \n\nAnd since I didn‚Äôt help with other stations in my downtime. Me, who is suppose to be the last station standing( besides dishes who finishes around the same time I do), is still seeing sections that need cleaning because we also didn‚Äôt have enough people at night.\n\nMy manager the other day stayed the closing shift with us. My shift leader told me that my manager asked her why I left so late the other day. But when he worked the closing shift he understood why I left so late. Because that day we were sort of swamped. And I made sure he saw me following his rules step by step. He left later than I did that day and I left at 12:45.",

However‚Ä¶..one older woman came up to me yesterday and started to complain about her seat, saying that she had to bend her neck.  She went on about how she ‚Äúspends a lot of money at this Theater and for these seats, blah, blah, blah.‚Äù  So I smiled sweetly and said ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs check it out.‚Äù  She was obviously a woman of means who was used to spending money and getting her way, if you know what I mean.  So, I asked her where she was sitting and she said ‚ÄúIn the front row.  I ALWAYS get the front row.‚Äù  I then more clearly asked to see her ticket.  \n\n\"Turns out that the theater was configured to have seats in the orchestra pit, essentially, adding on four additional rows to the front of the theater.  These rows are labeled ‚ÄúAA‚Äù, ‚ÄúBB‚Äù, ‚ÄúCC‚Äù and ‚ÄúDD‚Äù.  When we examined her ticket, she had a seat for row ‚ÄúA‚Äù ‚Äì four rows back!  I explained this and said that Row A would solve her problem and she‚Äôd be more comfortable.  I don‚Äôt think she was too happy with me because she was now embarrassed and no longer in the front row, but rather five rows from the front.  Oh well.\"",

        "text": "Background:\n\nI am a test engineer at a small printing company. My main job role is to test materials, and then write up reports showing whether they have passed or failed the test. The tests include a before and after picture of the material sample to help show the changes that have occurred during the test.\n\nStory:\n\nMy manager recently started scheduling weekly meetings so he could track my progress on various projects. During the most recent meeting he said he has a few complaints about some test reports I have produced. Most of the complaints were fair enough. Examples include the font size being too small (it wasn‚Äôt, but whatever) and a few reports not having images of the testing equipment.\n\nThese problems were easy fixes that I could quickly make and then send the reports back to him. However, the final complaint he made about the reports blew my mind!\n\nHe said, \"The before and after images of the reports look too similar.\" What?!!?!? That‚Äôs the point! If the after image looked different, then chances are the material failed the test.\n\nWe argued over this for maybe 15 minutes before he decided to give me a ‚Äòbrilliant‚Äô example of what he‚Äôs talking about. He took a picture of a piece of paper on the table and then stood up and took the picture again. He showed his phone to me and started flicking between the two images, saying, \"You see!\" Notice how the two images are different. In my head I was screaming ‚Äòyou IDIOT!‚Äô. But I simply replied, \"Okay, I understand, and I‚Äôll be sure to make those changes to the reports.\"\n\nMalicious Compliance:\n\nAll images I take of material samples after testing, I now take standing up, making sure that my legs and feet are visible at the bottom of the picture. Previously, reports had two perfect before and after images that contained nothing but the test sample. Now the after images contain my legs, my feet, and a good portion of the bench. The new reports look awful, but I couldn‚Äôt care less. I only followed his guidance after all.\n\nHe'll probably make me start doing it the old way again after the next weekly meeting lmao.",

Perhaps not coincidentally, not long after I caught COVID and I was just so tired for next month.\n\nMy workload had been getting ever higher and higher. Every time I'd tell my manager I had too much to do and we needed to offload some of it to someone else, he'd tell me \"Well, you're doing a good job, keep it up!\" He generally didn't listen to anything you told him, and my job was simpler the more I avoided him. \n\nI'd previously been at a place I enjoyed, but I took a chance on a move to fill some experience in my career I felt I needed. Even up to this point, despite the burnout, I felt like I was in the position I wanted to be in.\n\nThen my manager starts telling me about how he's working on hiring someone who used to work there before I did, who was at the place I had come from. He has the same level of experience as me, but he's commanding a salary 20+% higher than I was making. This really upset me. I tried to let it go, but after a few days I confronted my manager saying that if the new guy was coming in at a higher salary then I should get a bump in pay too. \n\n\"Go get another offer, I can't do anything unless you get another offer.\"\n\nSomething in my head snapped. Between COVID fatigue and burnout I realized how exhausted I was and that it was time to leave. That day I called my previous employer, and three days later I had signed a job offer. I'm now making that 20% more, have an appropriate amount of work, and report to a manager who listens to what I say.",

I was working for CS on the SMS department and I was hired to send 16 messages /hr (which is VERY easy since the greeting alone counts as one SMS).\n\nMy family loves doing things right and efficiently, so my sis and I started sending about 80 to 180 messages /hr and our metrics were through the roof. Management had apparently never seen someone so efficient; and people started calling us \"The Siblings\" since both of us had such good rep, that no one could even come close to our numbers (The most anyone else did was 25 to 30 SMS /hr).\n\nI made a doc. where I wrote the most FAQs and their responses so that I could just copy-paste the responses to save typing time (This is why we had such good metrics. We actually sent good and informative replies) and I shared the doc. with my sis.\n\nThe company was happy with us... or so we thought. Some time passed and everyone was called for a meeting.\n\nWe were told that we're getting paid to send 16 messages /hr and that we weren't going to get paid more we sent more than that. Also, the collective metrics for everyone were from 13 to 25 and if we did more, the \"productivity bonus\" requirements would increase as well. So that meant that less people would get it and that wasn't nice. So we only need to send 16 to 25 SMS /hr so that everyone gets it.\n\nWhen we (my sis and I) heard that, we just looked at each other like \"This one's because of us, huh?\".\n\nAfter the meeting was over, I just got up and said out loud \"Remember kids. The secret to success is mediocrity\", and left.\n\nAfter that, my sister and I maliciously complied. We did our job as quickly as we usually do, which usually took us about 10 to 15 min if the SMS flow was low, and we spent the rest of the time either reading or doing basically anything else. And if we got called out for that, we would just say \"We finished. We don't want everyone else to lose their bonus\" and just continue doing nothing.\n\nI even offered management access to my google document with the responses so that everyone could improve their metrics, to which they said \"OK. We'll try it and if we see improvement, you'll get a raise\". So I shared the document with everyone and, as predicted, their numbers increased by double.\n\nAfter a few months (And a series of poor management decisions such as \"You aren't allowed to send more than 3 SMS back to back\" and \"You can't send more than 160 characters per SMS\" which damaged the productivity), I never got the raise I was promised and I told them that I wanted either the raise or a better possition since my numbers were good and I wanted to be QA. They told me that I needed at least a year there to be able to get a raise or a better position.\n\nThe last day I worked there I deleted the sheet (I apologized to everyone since they loved us) and told management that if they wanted to hire me to make the document, I would consider their offer.\n\nI just love the way some companies reward lazyness and punish people who to put effort in their jobs.",

We hardly ever use the short cups, partly because we don't have lids for them most of the time so I generally ignore their existence unless someone specifies. \n\nLady comes in and asks for the \"smallest size coffee\" and not even thinking, I rang her up for a tall. When I handed her the tall coffee, she got very upset and this is when I realized she'd actually meant to order the short. She immediately launches into heckling me about overcharging her, so I quickly offered her a refund on the difference between the two sizes. \n\nI'm pretty annoyed about how big of a deal she's making out of a cup of coffee until I notice the actual price difference between the short and tall. I then became very excited to give her the refund she desperately wanted. \n\nI hand her 7 cents with a smile, and her mouth just kinda drops. She starts asking about the prices, the sales tax, etc. She eventually just demands a receipt and storms off looking very embarrassed and just 7 cents richer.",

We arrive a few minutes early so Charlotte can warm up. Her class is an hour long so the warm up before it starts so they can utilize the short amount of time they have. Around ten minutes into the class, this woman, (we'll call her Karen), called over Charlotte and one other girl named Kayla, who she was practicing with. Charlotte and Kayla walked over confused, and I was a little pissed as this was wasting their and my time. I follow them over because I am curious. Karen says she needs to talk to the girls about something important, but she says she needs a witness. She calls for the owner of the facility's wife, and it takes about five minutes for her to come talk to us. I ask what is going on, and Karen says she needs to talk about dress code. I was a little bit confused, as there was never a dresscode on the facilities website, nor was it in any emails. I asked Karen if she was an employee, and she said she was. We listened to what she had to say, which was no shorts without leggings under them, no showing shoulder, etc. I was even more confused at this point, because my sister never wore anything provoking, and on this diy she was wearing a short sleeved softball jersey and lululemon leggings. Karen also stated that the shorts Charlotte wore in a previous practice where too short. They were mid thigh loose shorts. At this point I was trying to hold myself together, but the last thing she said pushed me over the edge. Karen said this was all because there were highschool boys at the facility. Charlotte gave me a nervous look that basically said \"I need to worry about that?\".  Charlotte is 12. Karen just so happens to have 3 highschool boys that practice at said facility. I asked Karen to talk to me outside. I was furious and I went off on her. I asked her if I needed to be worried about my little sister being sexualized while playing a sport in the presence of older boys. She said that boys think different than girls. I asked if there was a boys dress code, and she said there was. I asked to speak to the manager or a coach. She was hesitant at first but I finally got to speak to the owner, whose wife was the \"witness\" earlier. The manager was a kind man named Jeremy. My talk with Jeremy explained a few things.  A: There is no dress code, athletes can wear what they want to work out. B: Karen was not indeed an employee. Jeremy was very helpful and apologetic. At this point, Charlottes practice had ended. As soon as we got in the car to go home, she started bawling. She asked basically what I asked Karen; does she have to worry about being looked at by upper-class highschoolers? She also told me her coach thought the dresscode was BS. We got milkshakes on the way home and talked about what to do next. I said we should take the high road and ignore Karen, but she had a better plan, cue malicious compliance. She said that she wanted to follow the no shorts without leggings under them rule, and she did just that. The next day, when we went back for her next practice, she wore leggings with spandex shorts over them. If you don't know what those are, look them up. It looked a little funny, but her coach got a kick out of it. Karen was FUMING. She angrily confronted me, asking if I told Charlotte to do this just to make her mad. I told her Charlotte just really took what she said to heart and decided to follow  her rules. Of course Karen couldn't do anything but complain to her group of friends that also brought their kids to work out. A few of them chuckled and Karen just got angrier. Every day we have went back, we haven't seen Karen or her kids there, so it's a win in my book.    \n\n\nTLDR: My sister follows the dresscode and the person who made the dress code got mad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much for reading this, it is my first post on reddit.",

        "text": "Hi, this is my very first post on reddit, so please, don‚Äôt be too harsh on me. :) Also, I am from Germany and not quite sure I translated the position titles correctly, but if not, they‚Äôre mostly minor detail to the story. And I know most of this story is explanation about the relationship, but I think it‚Äôs necessary to get what happened.\n\n I (43 F) am a learned landscape gardener, but due to an accident many years ago, can no longer work the actual craft. In 2020, after 12 years of being a STAHM, I began working in the office of a quite large landscaping firm. My position was Assistant to Management, with ‚ÄûJack‚Äú, one of the COOs, as my direct boss. At the time, I did mostly supporting paperwork. A couple of months later, the company hired ‚ÄûBecky‚Äú as a junior manager. She had just finished her master‚Äôs degree, and this was her first ‚Äûreal‚Äú job, so she had a LOT to learn, and to gain experience. In the beginning, she relied on me for the paperwork and how our programs worked, and I thought we got along well, even though we were as different as two people can be. \n\nIn spring 2021, there were some changes made. For once, our whole department moved to new office rooms, and Becky and I were put in the same office. Also, I was taken out of day-to-day-paperwork to work exclusively on surveying, to get all the measurements needed to correctly bill our clients. About that time, our problems started. I am on the ADHD spectrum, so I have habits of unconciously fiddling, or talking to myself, and other stuff, that unnverved her. She needed absolute quiet while working, whereas I prefer to hear music over headphones. Everytime she told me something I did would disturb her, I tried to stop myself from doing that, be it mumbling, listening to music while she is in the office, even drinking coffee because ‚Äûyour slurping is disgusting‚Äú. (Coffee is hot, duh?) I was not allowed to comment on anything concerning her (I am a terribly curious person), and so on. Even though I love my job and anyone else in the company, that daily repression made me not want to go to work in the morning. \n\nIt came to afist head when one of our foremen was in the office. She gave him a task, he was annoyed, and I made a fun little comment that made the foreman chuckle (lightened his mood as intended). But after he‚Äôd left, she exploded on me how dare I undermine her authority, and how unrespecting of her position and person I was, after all SHE was a manager (junior, but who counts?), and I was merely the assistant. She went to Jack to complain about me, how she could not work with me when I was so obnoxious, yadda yadda‚Ä¶ Long story short, Jack is a super chill boss, he talked to me to hear my side, and three days later I moved all my stuff into another, smaller office, where I work ever since. \n\nAs I mentioned, I do the surveying, for all managers' projects who need it, also for Becky. And she was very particular in how the plans had to be laid out, which items had to be on them, and so on. So when I did a survey and drafted the plans, we had to have several discussions and corrections about minute details none of he other managers cared about. Everybody else, when I had a question regarding their projects, I would go to their office, see if they were free, and ask the information that I needed, if I could not draw it from the documentation. Not with Becky. She demanded I make appointments with her to schedule meetings to talk about these issues. That dragged work on her projects to absurd lengths. Also, she would give me deadlines for finishing, and then take one to four weeks before even looking at what I had made. THEN she would want to discuss that, when I was already at the next project over. It was a pain. \n\nIn December 2021, we had another falling out when she questioned me about a project that I had finished in October, and got pissed when I could not immediately recall all the details. I mumbled something like ‚ÄûMaybe assemble the bill not 2 months after finishing the project‚Äú, and she blew up. ‚ÄûHow dare you tell me how to to my work! I know what I am doing, and don‚Äôt have to put up with a lowly assistant!‚Äú I left, and luckily, that was the last day of work in 2021. In 2022, work started with Becky calling me to her, and instructing me on how we would proceed in the future. I was not to talk to her while working unless she approached me first, or if we had a scheduled meeting. Also, I was only to talk to her about the tasks she had assigned me, nothing else, as it was not my position to tell her how to do her job. Breaks were fair game, but by then, my interest in making conversation with her had faded. So, that‚Äôs how it went. \n\nAt this point, I have to mention that as part of my job, I sometimes look at the charts of work that has already been done - how much soil has been brought in, how much of which materials have been used -, to get an idea of what needs to be included in the survey. In Becky‚Äôs lists, I sometimes noticed typing mistakes, like the surveyed amount of square meters entered, when the volume (cubic meters) was demanded, which resulted in too high bills, which lead to complaints by the client and reduction of the bill. I tried to tell that to Becky, but she stopped me before I really began, pointing out again I had to focus on my job, and not speak to her unless addressed by her first. O-kay. For other managers, I would simply have corrected the mistake after quick consultation, but for her - nope. \n\nIn the following months, I noticed a couple of these mistakes in her projects, but I kept my mouth shut. Also did not go to Jack about it, because I did not want to appear like I was blackmailing  her or something. Over the summer, I noticed more and more mistakes, and how projects that had been finished in the spring had still not been billed. But somehow Becky found the time to go on summer vacation - twice. I noticed undocumented items, false entries, lacking entries, and other mistakes in the lists of her projects, and said - nothing. In early August, she had finally assembled the bill for one of her bigger projects that had been finished months ago, and forbade anyone to talk to her while she worked on the next. \n\nThen I received an email. The client who had received the aforementioned bill had rejected it, due to the amount of mistakes and lack of confirmability. I had been CCed as the surveyor - but the problem was not my surveys, but that Becky had not transferred the results correctly. The client denied payment and demanded immediate correction. The sum was around 250.000‚Ç¨, money the company had been waiting for for months by the time. This was serious, so I decided to break my silence and tell Becky. She saw me through the glass door, and before my hand touched the handle, she yelled ‚ÄûDon‚Äôt talk to me!‚Äú Well, then‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs a girl to do? Wait. For about 15 minutes, until my super chill boss, who‚Äôd been walking his dog over lunch break, returned to his computer. Of course he had been CCed as well, and his roar made the walls shake. Jack went to Becky‚Äôs office and tore her a new one, afterwards came to me and asked me to please correct the lists as far as I am able. In the following days, he went through all of Becky‚Äôs projects, and needless to say: She‚Äôs gone since September. \n\nShe wanted me to do everything her way, and I tried to comply with so much crap. In the end, I complied so much, it got her fired.",

        "text": "I saw another post that jogged an old forgotten memory. \n\nIn college 25 or so years ago I worked for a chain restaurant (let's just say the company heads were big Rolling Stones fans). After being there a year or so we had a new GM transfer in &amp; he was immediately difficult. Not terrible just a stickler for stupid things &amp; pushed rules solely to make things miserable at every turn. The fun fled that place almost immediately. \n\nAt some point prior to the events that follow, I wore another chain's unform to work for Halloween when we were allowed to dress up so GM already didn't care for me.\n\nSome time into his tenure the company sponsored a \"casual dress\" day for charity (I forget which one). If you donated a set amount, $5 or $10 if I remember, you got an \"I donated\" pin &amp; got to dress however you wanted that day instead of the usual dumb uniform. I think a percentage of our sales that day also went to the charity. Then GM Buzzkill gets involved. \n\nDespite the casual dress guidelines being issued company-wide he felt the need to place his own restrictions. No jeans. No t-shirts of any kind, no sports attire ect (all of which were allowed by the company). He basically set standards that only allowed different colors of the same uniform. The employee meeting he announced all this at immediately turned into an argument. We all argued the company's position &amp; got into a debate w/ him about what qualified as \"casual\". At some point he let slip he would only entertain dressing up, not down. Smart-ass suggestions ensue. Bridesmaid dresses? 3-piece suits? Someone said tuxedos &amp; he, trying to be sarcastic, said any formal attire would be acceptable if you though you could work in it. A light bulb went off on my head.\n\nWhat about kimonos? Or kilts? Both are used as formal attire in their cultures. He agreed that's formal attire &amp; waved me off, I'm guessing because he thought I was just being difficult. Now we had a ball game.\n\nI gathered all the guys scheduled that weekend &amp; got almost all to agree to go in on it. Called the local custom costume shop next. Kimonos could not be had in our time frame. Kilts however were no problem. We got the schedule for the day &amp; all the conspirators picked up doubles if they didn't already have them. I picked up the order of rented kilts (sporrans, kilt hose &amp; all) &amp; passed them out prior. The day of 7 of us showed up in full Scottish regalia. There were a couple who'd found bunnets for themselves. GM was FUMING but he was reminded (by the women working no less) that he had agreed to it at the meeting.\n\nBefore you ask, no, we did not go \"traditional\" underneath. We felt he probably would've found something actionable with that. And we still had to wear non-skid sneakers as a safety rule.\n\nBest part, the next week the company bulletin (pre-email days) mentioned the \"creativity\" shown by the staff of our store for the event. I don't know how corporate found out about it.\n\nHe NEVER gave me an inch again. He happily gave me my transfer request about a year later.",

Then the firm invested a huge amount of money in a new CNC machine, I was selected to be one of the programmer/ operators. \nI was sent to Germany from the UK to be taught how to run it, it was a real head scrambler to start with but eventually I figured it out and loved the job.\nOnce it was installed and running smoothly the company was able to deal with much bigger contracts so naturally took them on. \nIn order to fulfil all the work, I had to ensure the machine worked every minute of the working day possible. My hours were 8-5. I would arrive at work at 7.30 and spend the next 30 minutes firing up all the computers, turning on the machine and running it through all the set up procedures and making sure it was ready to go. Then I would walk across to the main factory at 8oclock to clock in. \nHowever one day I had a small issue with the machine which took a few minutes to fix, so by the time I got to the clock in machine it was 8.04. I really didn‚Äôt think anything of it until I got my payslip that week, it was 15 minutes short. So I went to see my manager, he looked at the pay slip and said company policy was, 3 minutes late clock in allowed only, over that time is an automatic 15 minute deduction, but he knew it was a genuine reason for the late clock in so would speak to the payroll dept and get it sorted. \nThey however said tough! Rules are rules. \nSo no prizes for guessing what I did next, from then on I arrived at 7.30, and sat and drank coffee until 7.55, walked over to clock in, and only then started my set up. That 2.5 hours a week amounted to a large amount of lost production, teams of fitters began to run out of product after about a week. At that point the big boss got involved, he realised immediately that he could not ask me to go back to doing what I did before so he offered me 30 mins a day at overtime rate. Well why not, I was there anyway.\nThat 1 minute extra on the clock cost them 2.5hrs a week at time and a half for the next 2 years, when I finally left the company",

I did this for round about two years and there was not one shift without a customer asking me where item xyz was. I have no issue with that, I myself do that all the time since I'm really bad at finding what I need in bigger stores. But from time to time (I'd say once a week) the customers could not accept if we did not have their specific item in store and would ask me to atleast look in the room where we kept everything that was not on the shelfs, even if I was 100% sure that it was not there since I just tried to fill the shelf back up. I got eyed-rolled way to many times when i reasured them that we where out of that item and that they had to come back later this week. But at one of my petty days following interaction accured: \n\nCustomer (C): \"Hey sorry, I need these specific type of instant noodles but their place in the shelf is empty. Can you go and fill it back up please?\"\n\nMe: \"Hi, no sorry we are out of these. But we should have them back in stock in two days, you will be able to get them then.\"\n\nC: \"I really need them now though, would you mind looking?\"\n\nMe: \"I just looked half a hour ago when i tried to refill the shelf.\"\n\nC: \"Can you look again?\"\n\n\\*sigh\\*\n\nMe (about to be maliciously compliant): \"Yeah sure. Just stay right here, I will be back in a sec.\"\n\nWe had atleast 20.000 different Items in this store so our warehouse was quite big and I made sure to look at every possible place. I moved pallets out of my way to look behind them, I asked a fellow employee if he saw that specific type of instant noodles some where. Guess what - we where out of it. After  **‚âà**  15 minutes I came back to the customer and told him that we where indeed out of it. \n\nHe was not amused.",

        "text": "I started working at a grocery store in my town when I was 15. I worked there for two years and some months before I finally had enough of my boss degrading everything I did. I had trained most of my department, picked up the slack in others and cross trained when he couldn‚Äôt get workers to stick due to his poor attitude and management. The final straw was when he started making me cry out of anger because no matter how much work I had done, how many days I came in when I clearly booked them off or needed them for exams/studying/family time it didn‚Äôt matter. He gave me an ultimatum, either I work 30+ hours each week, continuing to come in when I wasn‚Äôt scheduled, or he would cut my hours to less than 15 per week. Keep in mind I had full time school, attended another school for additional work, and took care of family at this time. I had a meeting with him and addressed how he treated me to which he told me to toughen up or quit. So  que malicious compliance, my petty teenage self drafted my notice that day, slid it into his mailbox a few days later and found a new job within 24 hours. I completed three weeks after my notice and they were still asking me to come in after my effective end date. He ignored me and most of the managers did until my last day, no one offered me a reference, no one even paid me attention. After I quit, it took over three people to fill my job, and with his high turnover of staff he struggled for a long time. I still laugh about it.",

        "text": "So I work at at a major University in the USA. I run a night crew that works a swing shift. Every 6 months or so, upper management likes to have some all staff meetings where everyone in our department shows up to listen to them talk about how great they are. Overall, pretty big waste of time. First one I ever went to, I was forced to go by my previous supervisor. I had to be there at 10am for a 90 minute meeting. My normal start time was 4pm so this was a HUGE inconvenience. The next year, that Supervisor had left and I was the new Supervisor. I knew another meeting was coming because I had received several emails about it. However, I had read the contract and it's required that any temporary shift change requires 48 hours **written notice.** So I decide to say nothing. Finally, less than 24 hours before the event, we finally receive our notice. I immediately reply saying that they failed to give us 48 hours notice and we would not be attending. My manager was initially upset because I didn't say anything earlier. I informed him that wasn't my job and pointed to the contract. He eventually gave in and said, \"Fine, you don't have to come. Next time we will give you more notice.\"\n\nHowever, I decided to make this a larger issue. I spoke to the Director, who was also upset we wouldn't be attending. So, I offered that we could do a smaller event for the night crew. Long story short, ever since then we now have a separate event at night. Turns out there is far more than just our shop. There are several other groups, including custodians who also don't have to adjust their shifts. I never intended it to be that far reaching, but that simple rule saved us a ton of heart ache. No one thinks about the night crew lol.",

        "text": "I use to work at one of the biggest chains of grocery stores in the US, I no longer work there for obvious reasons. \nFirst I want to start off by saying, I was a college student, going to classes Monday-Thursday from 10AM to around 6PM at night about forty five minutes from my house, then on the weekends, or what was suppose to be the weekends since I was hired as part time, I would work at this grocery store. \n\nAt the time, I‚Äôve already been hired to work at the store for around 3 months, I started off at Starbucks, then went to the store‚Äôs clothing division, and finally got transferred to cashiering. I like cashiering, talking to people, getting to know them, it makes the days go by easier and frankly listening to people was just something I gladly did. \nEver since I started working, this company had a hard time giving out breaks, and lunches. It‚Äôs not illegal in the state I‚Äôm in because it‚Äôs a right-to-work state, they can make you work hours on end without a break or lunch, so they usually tried to pull a fast one on me constantly, denying me a break in a 6-8 hour shift, doing the same thing to others. I wouldn‚Äôt of minded it, if I didn‚Äôt get scoliosis the year prior. \nWhen I worked long hours with no way to get off of my feet, I would be immensely sore, sore enough where I would have to take some hefty pain meds to just get through the next day of work. Just a fifteen minute break in that would‚Äôve solved a lot of issues, but it always came down to ‚Äúit‚Äôs not your turn yet‚Äù and ‚Äúthere was an emergency that needed to be handled‚Äù as well as a million other reasons why. \nOne day I truly had enough and I just left my register, shutting down the sign and taking a small break. It was five minutes in when the manager called me up back to the register, then demanded to know why I wasn‚Äôt at my place. I told them that my back was hurting and I needed to sit down, or have a chair for me at the register. They told me to talk to the Union. Right after my shift, as I‚Äôm limping out to the car, I call the Union. The union told me that if I asked for a seat or got a doctors note saying I needed a seat, I would be fired. It wasn‚Äôt in their company policy to allow someone to have a seat at the register, regardless of disabilities. \nI talked to the district manager about the problems, she told me that I couldn‚Äôt have a seat, but she would ‚Äòmake sure‚Äô I got my breaks. Being the district manager you have a lot on your plate, she wasn‚Äôt going to be able to keep track of one employee when there were hundreds below her. But regardless, I went in my next shift, the same thing happened, I didn‚Äôt get my breaks. Within that week, I put in my two week notice,telling my district manager that I couldn‚Äôt keep this up. \nA year later, I went back and found out the district manager, as well as my manager and a few other managers of different departments, got fired for not allowing breaks. \nAnd I‚Äôm happy that I left.",

        "text": "Three years ago i started working in a company were my manager was a piece of shit that would insult us and blame any problem on his employees trying to get them against eachother. I got burned out after about a year of 10 hours days and weekends and of doing tasks that were greatly above my paycheck and completely different from what i was promised as i got there. So i gave my resignations.\nMy manager though i was useless as he often said about anyone but himself, so instead of trying to find a new employee, he decided he would have taken over my role, to the horror of all my coworkers. \nThe only problem: I was the only person who knew perfectly the company ERP program and i would have had to teach him my 1,5 year experience in two weeks.\nAs i started to teach him he got more and more frustrated and terrified by the amount of workload that was coming his way and started to insult me even more, but i was still trying to teach him the best i could for the sake of my coworkers. All of this until the first day of my last week. \nI was pointing out a mistake he was making every time he did a certain task and he replied screaming at me \"Shut the fuck up! I don't need you to act as a fucking teacher!\"\n\nSo (malicious compliance) i didn't... \n\n... I just sat beside him for the next and last 5 days not teaching him anything and every time he couldn't remember how to do something i would jokingly cheer him up, telling him i was sure he could come up with the solution himself if he focused enough. When problems would come up that i still didn't have the time to solve i would tell him \"I don't know how this thing happened, it never happened to me, you should contact the client service, they thought me everything when i needed\".\n\nThe peak of this was when he got so frustrated that he started to repeatedly slam his mouse against the desk and then sat there staring blankly at the screen for 10 minutes. I had to actually keep myself from laughing in his face.\n\nAfter i left i spent the next two months getting called almost daily by my ex-colleagues to help them find files or solve problems that they couldn't find an answer for and that i didn't have the time to teach them as i had to stay with the manager all the time.",

I said, ‚ÄúAlright, we are going to reschedule to next week, have a good day.‚Äù He starts arguing saying, ‚ÄúNO! I need to do this today.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre coughing and sneezing, I don‚Äôt want to get sick.‚Äù Client: I threatened my ex for not letting me see my kids and I think I ate a pot brownie at a barn party!\n\nMe: What? Why are you telling me any of this?\n\nClient: Because I had a lot going on. \n\nAt this point I emailed my supervisor for permission to check his phone as well as alert we may have to take someone into custody. \n\nSo as I am waiting for my boss to give me approval to search his phone, I need to get statements about what he was doing. So apparently he was threatening to just go see his ex (despite a no contact order), and then went to a barn party and consumed weed. He was getting angry that it was taking me so long for his meeting. I said, ‚ÄúYou admitted to a bunch of violations, I now need to document each one.‚Äù He was pissed off and said, ‚ÄúMy mom drove me here and has another appointment.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI guess you should‚Äôve taken up my offer on rescheduling then.‚Äù\n\nSo I do a drug test, shows positive for THC (it‚Äôs not legal here). I go through his phone and he definitely overstated what he intended to. It was more baby mama drama than actual bodily harm, point is, I had to wait to make that call. \n\nI am not sure what happened to the guy, but please: When your probation officer asks to reschedule, don‚Äôt say a word except ‚ÄúOK.‚Äù",

        "text": "I live in Missouri. If you live in the Cabool/Willow Springs area, do not shop at Shetler‚Äôs. It‚Äôs a little cafe/discount grocery store. I have no problems saying, they sell out of date food to innocent old people who don‚Äôt know better, and their cafe uses unsafe ingredients. And if we throw away rotten or bad food, it comes out of our paycheck. The manager‚Äôs racist, and so are a few of the employees. They also don‚Äôt appreciate gay people in the store as shoppers or employees. Anyhow, I used to work there. They fired me over dumb reasons, so yeah fuck Rose, the manager. \n\nI worked in the freezer department, and due to the fact that people would hang out in our freezers to pass time when there was nothing to do, Rose put a rule in place that an employee with higher status was to accompany other employees into the freezer at all times. Now, most of the time, no one followed this rule. Cuz it was dumb and we still did our work. For context, the store closes at 8,  but all the back staff clocked out at 5. I usually was there a little after 5, just doing last minute stocking and cleaning. Anyhow, one night, as usual, everyone clocks out at 5. I‚Äôm finishing up with the freezer stuff. Rose happens to walk over and ask if I was still clocked in. Oh yeah, she would regularly ask me to clock out at five but continue to work. So much fun. Anyhow, she asks wether or not I‚Äôm still clocked in. I say yes. She asks why there‚Äôs no hot wings out in the front, where customers could get some. \n\nI said we were out and would be getting them on Monday, but she said they should be here by Saturday night. I said yes, but the shipment would be getting here after I left, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to put it out until Monday. She asks if we can take a trip to the back to double check. I say that I know we don‚Äôt have any, but she says she‚Äôs the manager and she knows we should have some, because she has no idea what goes on in the back. I decide to maliciously comply. I say I can, but I need her to come with me. She asks why I can‚Äôt just get someone from the back, but I tell her they‚Äôve all clocked out already. She says fine, but that she needs a jacket. Since it‚Äôs the summer, she didn‚Äôt bring one, and all the spare ones are too small. So we go into the freezer, me bundled up in my blizzard attire, her in a T-shirt, dress, bonnet, and sandals. So we go in. \n\nIt‚Äôs literally snowing. I start climbing up boxes, crawling under stuff, looking, searching for this mythical box of wings. After about 15 minutes of through searching, she asks if I found them. I said no, but per her request, I will keep searching. The quest continues. Now keep in mind, these freezers are about as large as a large school cafeteria. It took me about 45 minutes to check through the entire freezer, detailed, to find the wings. I tell her I‚Äôm done in this one, and she, relieved, thanks me for looking. ‚ÄúNo no,‚Äù I say, ‚Äúthis is just the first freezer. Still two more to look though!‚Äù Her face drops. She says she thinks we‚Äôre fine, but oh no, I insist. She said we should have some, I‚Äôm just following her orders! 2 hours and thirty minutes later, still no sign of the legendary chicken wings. We exit the third freezer, and I swear, her lips were blue. I shrug and say, ‚Äúhuh, I guess they aren‚Äôt in there.‚Äù She, relieved says I can check out now. \n\nBut oh wait, glorious day, the shipment of frozen stuff comes in. She wishes me luck and goes to leave, but I say, ‚Äúwait, I need to put this new shipment into their respective freezers! And I need a higher up to accompany me!‚Äù She‚Äôs clearly pissed at this point, actively shivering but eh, her rules, not mine. Another 45 minutes, give or take, and boy were my hand warmers useful, all the crates full of frozen stuff is in the freezer! But are we done? Nope! Since I‚Äôm still here, I might as well restock the shelves in the front of the store! And, well, I need a manager to accompany me for that too! Before long, those chicken wings were out on the shelf, conveniently ready for customers to buy. At 8:30, I clock out with all the front of store staff, and Ms. Rose hangs out in the hot kitchen to warm up. $121.50 richer than I was when I woke up, I went home and ate dinner. \n\nCome Monday, Rose announced that there were no longer limitations on who could be in the freezer and when, just as long as we kept our production on course. And I guess we did. Dumb rules, and I right? But it all worked out, I‚Äôm just happy she got cold fee when she did. It just sucked that she gave me the cold shoulder over her own dumb rule.",
