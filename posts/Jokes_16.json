It was a small tree carved into the shape of a man, entirely devoid of leaves, except for the pubic region. Indubitably this was a ‚Äúbush‚Äù joke manifested in poor taste.\n\nThe spy‚Äôs mission was to uproot that tree and replace it with yet another man-shaped tree, though this one would be in trousers.\n\nThe existing naughty tree was installed by the power plant manager, and the spy agency needed to get their hands on it, because hidden deep in the tree‚Äôs bush was the code to the power plant manager‚Äôs safe, which contained information vital to national security.\n\nIt was not enough for the spy agency to simply steal the tree though. They needed to replace it and give it trousers so the manager would know what they had done to him.\n\nMany days after accomplishing the mission, the spy decided to write a novel detailing the harrowing experience of being inserted into the plant as an employee, and plotting to switch out the naughty tree with a tree in trousers. The spy titled that novel:\n\n‚ÄúHow a Power Plant Plant Planned to Supplant That Plant‚Äôs Plant with a Plant in Pants.‚Äù",
