        "text": "Disabled, dark thoughts, looking for help\n\nIm currently 27yo european guy and Ive been stuck inside home since 2011 due to multiple advancing disabilities and im sure its no surprise its been making me having suicidal thoughts and self-harming during these years. Im not looking for pity but rather solutions and ideas to better my situation if theres anyone who has had similar life experiences. How do you keep a social life going when you have severe disabilities? Clearly it does make your social circles small if you can't attend anything, if i lived in a populated area or in a different culture i'm sure there would be gatherings and meetings for people with my disabilities etc, but for people in my current situation, that don't have such events available, it feels impossible to have a social life. Having friends, dating and all that jazz. I just feel like im withering away when i dont have any people to connect within my own country / culture / language in real life. Im completely dependent on disability-aids, mobility-aids and heavy medications. Its the kinda tired that sleep wont fix. Im scared that i dont have the strenght &amp; willpower to hold on much longer just being alone and inside year after year.I really dont understand how disabled people can make friends or have relationships, people always drop me as soon as they realize im disabled or when i tell them that i am, if i lay it out beforehand then im not getting any contacts. So i wonder how on earth do disabled people find people to socialize with who are fine with having a disabled person as a friend and aren't ashamed of it? So please, if anyone has had success with making life bearable with severe disabilities, i'm all ears! Thank you for reading.",

        "text": "I have been on the self-improvement journey for 5 years. I would say the proudest visible thing I have achieved is weight loss. I was an extremely unhealthy overweight teen and lost 20kg (44lbs)! It wasn't easy, but I never knew how capable I was!! There are goals that made me feel fulfilled, while others didn't even though I did achieve the targets. I didn't understand until I started understanding how my own mind works, which is extremely important to keep myself stay on track! \n\nI think everyone's journey is unique. Everyone's core values, motivation, and fears are also different. So I believe the definition of success should not entirely be based on what society gives us. Or else you will constantly feel deprived no matter how much you accomplish.\n\nThis is what the Enneagram is about: It's a model about your mind process around motivation, values, and fears. There are 9 types of enneagrams in total:\n\n1: Strict, strives for perfectionism \n\n2: Altruistic helper\n\n3: The hyper-achiever\n\n4: The individualist\n\n5: The knowledge hungry investigator\n\n6: The loyal stable person\n\n7: The enthusiastic adventurer\n\n8: The challenger rebel\n\n9: The peacemaker, mediator\n\nYou usually have one core type, and there are two others somewhere in your stack. You can have one type from each group (2,3,4) (5,6,7) (8,9,1)\n\nI personally am a 479. That means my self-development journey would fulfill me the most when I start embracing my individuality, experience more in life, and having peace. For example, if I got accepted into Harvard, it still may not make me feel happy because that does not fulfill me intrinsically. However, if I travel around the world, that will make me happy because that's my core purpose even if that's no everyone's dream. I feel so confident now because I know exactly what I want and what fulfills me personally. I stopped living someone else's dream because I'm finally true to who I am. \n\nGive this model a try, or at least start discovering what your core values are. Sometimes we may be working towards someone else's agenda without knowing, and that's why many of us feel lost in life no matter how much you succeed. Good luck everyone! If you know your enneagram and tritype please share in this post and tell me briefly about what you wanna do in self-improvement and life!",

Everyday of the week I wake up, get ready for school, go to school, and then do nothing for the rest of my day except go on tiktok or on my phone. I go to the gym 5 times a week for an hour, that's it. \n\nMy schedule consists of waking up, going to school, coming home, going on my phone, going to the gym, and then coming home. I don't have anybody I can actually consider my friend, I have a lot of friends but it seems that everytime I actually get close with any of them, they prove themselves to be unloyal. I've been friends with everybody, introverts, extroverts, smart kids, popular kids, kids that nobody likes, kids that everybody wants to be, and they all seem to have that one common factor of being short-term. My mom says that it's because they're teenagers and when I grow up I'll find real friends, but I don't think that's true. \n\nOn weekends I simply cry because I actually have nothing to do, ever. I've already signed myself up for sports and am just waiting for an email back, but I still feel like it's not enough. \n\nBefore anyone asks, I have already been diagnosed with depression, but I'm in therapy and on treatment, I have been for 4 years now. This is not depression, this is pure boredom. \n\nCan somebody please help me? I can't keep living my life like this, I'm completely alone and I don't know what to do. \n\nTLDR: I really have no life and need help finding something to do, or finding a purpose.",

To be honest it sounds goofy that I’m worried about this but these past few years I haven’t been happy with myself. I’ve been pretty depressed mentally, very exhausted, and not confident, and I feel like there’s no point to because of the lack of attention I get from women. I see so many guys, and losers attracting girls like this nothing, and I can’t. I root for them but it makes me jealous. I have it all good on paper. I’m good looking, fit, have good hygiene, have a good paying job, a nice car, a house. Idk what it is but it’s hard for me to talk to them. Not just that but attracting them. My problems start with setting up dates. I feel like my messages are bad because I always get left on read. Other times I feel like I rush too hard to sexting or trying to meet up for sex that I skip past having an actual conversation. (Which I’m bad at) I feel like I’m not romantic enough. I think I know what my problem is I just don’t know how to articulate myself into fixing it. Another thing is I think Redpill is so burned into my head that I get the wrong idea about women. I see them all as mean creatures that play games with us men so we should use them for sex. The Redpill made me anti-simp/sweet and I’ve always been pretty aggressive when I flirt and I think it just comes off to girls as too mean. I feel like that’s another reason I can’t flirt or tease well and I don’t have sweet-talking charisma girls like. I beat this topic to death constantly on Reddit and nothing is working for me. I wanna understand if this is something I need to learn more through trial and error or if I need to see a therapist. Thank you",

I got 2 F's that year. I'm in 11th grade now and I haven't started studying for 3 classes that I will have to do the grade-determining exam on in 2/3 months. On top of that, I have lots of homework and older stuff I need to turn in. \n\nWhen starting out with something I always have this positive mindset that this time I will get it done and do great but it never happens. I don't understand why it's so hard. It all feels so mentally exhausting. (It's not about distractions because I have had social media deleted for over a week now but I just started reading books instead, and while that is better, it's still not what I'm supposed to do.) \n\nI did talk to a school counsellor and specialpedagog(? was supposed to help with my studies and planing) but they were of no help. \n\nHonestly, I have thought this might be an ADHD symptom but my parents never let me do an assessment because I'm not the stereotypical image of it. I know that makes no sense I have tried to talk to them about it also because my little brother has so obviously severe ADHD and none seems to pick up on that, not even his teachers who sent complaints about his behaviour to my parents. How he disturbs everyone by making noises, being so easily distracted, and being impulsive just to name a few.  \n\nI really don't know what to do.",

        "text": "You must become self-reliant. \n\nTake responsibility for your life and well-being without being a burden on others for help and support. \n\nTo become self-reliant means being able to rely on your own resources, skills, and abilities. \n\nIt does not mean become becoming isolated or self-centered.  \n\nIt is one of the ultimate tests of adulthood. Unfortunately, many don't realize how much better their lives would be as a result of being self-reliant. \n\nHere are 5 reasons you must become self-reliant: \n\n**#1: You experience personal growth.** When you become self-reliant, you take control of your life. You are able to make decisions that line up with your values and goals. This opens you up to seeking new experiences, and taking bigger, more calculated risks.  It also hones your mind, helping you learn better from mistakes.  \n\n**#2: You become resilient.** When you become self-reliant, you're better equipped to adapt to changing circumstances. You're able to 'reset' after taking a loss. You can better overcome challenges and obstacles in your way. \n\n**#3: You become independent.** When you become self-reliant, you stop looking to others for approval or validation. You can appreciate the progress you've made all by yourself. \n\n**#4: You become self-aware.** We tend to not look inside enough to know our strengths, weaknesses, and limitations. This highlights areas for improvement and forces you to up your game to achieve your goals.\n\n**#5: You build confidence.** Nothing makes you feel better than developing a sense of competence. Being competent opens up more opportunities. When you can show real skill and ability, it leads to recognition and new possibilities. \n\nBe well, and be the change.",

        "text": "I'm not violent towards people or animals or anything but I am to drywall and other inanimate objects. I also tend to lash out verbally but quickly apologize. \n\nSince going off Wellbutrin the irritability has gotten significantly better but is still present, although more so when my symptoms are acting up because they can be fucking infuriating. Most of the irritability came on after some heartache mixed with abuse of prescription dextroamphetamine, and never really went away until I started using cannabis on a regular basis which resulted in me developing psychosis after about a month of heavy use. \n\nAntipsychotics have shot my memory even though I no longer take them so unfortunately I can't remember any examples of my irritability.\n\nI don't have a job and the thought of working a job without stimulants sounds like torture to me. My psychiatrist is hesitant to prescribe stimulants as they can worsen psychosis. So I rely on my family pretty heavily.\n\nI almost revel in self destruction and often go on about how if my doctor doesn't prescribe me stimulants again I'll just take matters into my own hands and self medicate with meth and any negative consequences(such as getting meth cut with fentanyl or RC stims/bath salts that are often more dangerous than meth itself) will be on my doctor hands for not giving me the medication I need. And Richard Nixon's decrepit corpse for making stimulants so hard to acsess for the general public.\n\nI've been to treatment for addiction and mental health, most I got out of it was a quieting of the voices which was great but it wasn't from the treatment itself and more so the constant opportunities to socialize which really seems to help reduce my psychotic symptoms.\n\nI have no real will to do anything or enjoy anything anymore due to lasting damage from antipsychotics and SSRIs. Wellbutrin (SNDRI) helped a lot and was a miracle drug for awhile but stopped working after a month or two leaving nothing other than irritability and jaw clenching after all the positive effects faded.\n\nI don't know how I'm going to manage to hold down a job or get into college like this, I spent my first year after graduating struggling with psychosis so going to college was the last of my worries.\n\nI'm just burnt out after all of it and overall lethargic and apathetic. And no medication other than a low dose of amphetamines is going to fix that. I've tried methylphenidate based stimulants in the past before I ever developed psychosis and prior to my doctor starting me on amphetamine based stimulant medication. But the methylphenidate based meds just made me feel like shit and had worse physical side effects than the amphetamine based meds. I've heard methylphenidate is better for those with psychosis but it also doesn't work on me and makes me feel like shit so that's off the table.\n\nI just don't see the point in anything other than laying in bed. Even passive activities like social media and watching movies are starting to feel exhausting and draining.\n\nSo to put it simply I'm fucked.\n\nAny advice?",

I will spend most of my time scrolling through YouTube and wasting my time, but today will be different, instead of YouTube I will read some psychology book. In my exam hall a girl has a crush on me, One day while she was cheating on the exam I saw her, she was very clever while cheating. Two boys in my class got caught trying to cheat but she cheated like it was a piece of cake. So out of curiosity I kept watching her, how she cheats. Then she saw me while I was looking at her, I didn't flinch I kept looking at her then she suddenly turned then she looked at me now and then. Then after 2 days she came and sat near me,before that she was sitting 3 bench front of me. She is not that hot or cute but It's good to have some girl having a crush on me. If my enemies heard about it they will sure get jealous. While they are drowning in jealousy I will study and eventually become class topper , actually becoming class topper is not that hard I am already on top 5, just 4 more bastards to win. Today I will study without watching YouTube. I will tell you results tonight guys. Bye!!",

At the end of the post I will provide a background\n\n* High ego\n* Inferiority complex\n* Laziness\n* Hopelessness\n* Cowardice\n* Being afraid of losing\n* Lack of focus\n* Giving up very easily (sometimes I'm not even trying)\n* Lack of confidence and communication skills\n* No money\n* No friends (although I can easily be friend with people)\n* No partner (too scared to even try)\n* Greed (especially for money)\n* Manipulative  and liar (I found out about this after most of my friends and family  suddenly told me about it, so it's probably a new thing)\n* Suicidal?  (Some people told me that I look and talk like I don't wanna live but  I'm not sure, I don't feel suicidal at most times)\n* Being obese (since childhood)\n* Daydreaming and fantasizing (a lot, at dangerous levels)\n* Jealousy and wanting to be superior (when someone I know does the same thing with me, like hobbies, I get upset)\n* Not  being clean (I shower and brush my teeth everyday and always clean the  house but still, I don't pay attention to my clothes and feel like I'm  full of bacteria)\n* Having a \"Them vs Me\" mentality\n* Being  physically weak (new people I meet say I look strong but as they start  to know me better, they start to notice I'm weak. I can't even move  couches that easily)\n* Not enough high pain tolerance (This is somehow important for me)\n\nAnd here, some positive traits I think I have:\n\n* I can learn quickly if I try. It takes at most a day for me to learn a concept related to a field I'm interested in. Normally I wouldn't say I learn quick, but after seeing my classmates and colleagues, I can definetely see that I at least have this\n* I'm a game developer and a 3D artist. A shitty one, but still I am. Also I compose music in my free time and I'm a rapper too. Again, a shitty one, but again, I still am.\n* Most people say I'm handsome but don't focus on my style and clothes enough (no I don't ask them if I'm looking good, they say it first)\n* I had good grades during school and got praised on my job, but I wasn't even trying, it was just something in my life, I wasn't dedicated to it\n\nNow some background:\n\nI'm  18, and from Middle East. Most of my childhood I've been mocked and  told that I'm dumb and can't get anything properly. Got beaten up during  the school etc.\n\nAfter the  middleschool, I felt like I was broking my shell. I was socializing,  making close friends etc. For some reason I was able to make new friends  even if I didn't want to, but I always lose them because I give 0  efforts to maintain the friendship. I currently have few people talking  to me, but I'm pretty sure I will lose them too because I can't get my  ass off of the couch and respond to them\n\nI  was raised in a very religious family, and have been told that even  looking at girls in the eyes is a sin. I've never talked to girls until  very recently (like until last year) and I'm still afraid of talking to  them, but at least it's getting better\n\nFor  me, even if I have no friends and any partner, I don't consider that a  much problem. For me, having a big ego, cowardness and laziness are the  top 3 problems I wanna fix but can't do so .\n\nWhat can I do to turn my life around?",

        "text": " 📷\n\nTurning 24 soon and feel alarm bells ringing in my head. I'm more or less still at the same point I was 10 years ago. I've missed out on so much joy in life, I honestly feel like there's an invisible glasss barrier between me and happiness. I haven't succeeded in anything in my life, really. No qualifications since leaving secondary school, was fat and never good at sports growing up, still am somewhat fat. I work a shit job (Just Over Broke). I've dropped out of uni twice. I'm still a coomer. The thought of how much of my seed has gone into a tissue or another fabric since puberty is insane. To think that there's certain cultures where young men might be married and starting families by the age of 20, and here I am wasting my seed, almost 24. I have tried and failed at suicide attempts multiple times. I moved city in the past year. Since almost after I started PMO'ing as a youth, I fell into cuckold and femdom porn, and haven't been able to get away from it. I fight a mental battle every day not to end up enacting this stuff in my real life, and I feel so ashamed that I struggle to even tell psychologists about it, let alone my friends. I did enact my fantasies with girls on Tinder a few times. I have levels of self-hate and shame in my head I don't think most could understand. I have one specific gift/talent in life which I believe could rectify everything, and if things changed, it could have meant my past experiences weren't in vain. It is this gift I have that has led me to turn down numerous girls over the past year who i could have probably developed a further relationship with, as I felt like i could do better, but the truth is, at least in this current moment in my life, in this state, I cannot. I hold out hope for myself that my life could change for the better due to 2 things I have going for myself- my gift and my good looks (although i am fully aware that I am presently out of shape). I fear if I settle for the girls i could get now, or just go back to university and settle for a normal, middle-class existence that this miserable feeling that currently exists in my head could just snowball exponenentially, and it's not gonna end well. But I feel like there's almost lightyears of distance between where I am at psychologically now, and the person I feel I could be, if I did act on this gift. I have a Nofap accountability partner, which helps a bit, but God, I wish I had friends who understand how I feel. I feel like I am sinking in quicksand. Honestly, I just look at other people enjoying their lives and feel like they are human and I am an alien. I know my perception is drastically warped, but this is deeply psychologically rooted in me and is hard to shake off. I am past the point of feeling like I can fit in any one specific place any more, or with any one group, I don't even feel like I fit in with any religion, there's a distance between me and any of my friends or family due to what I carry in my head, and it just snowballs. I grew up without a father, or any brothers or siblings, always perceived myself as lesser than those around me and this is hard to shake off. I don't feel like I fit in with either working class or middle class people, any friends I do have are not only very different to me, but also to each other, and have never been able to find myself able to have a \"friend group\" for any sustained period. I wish I felt a sense of brotherhood or belonging, but I understand that these come by proving your worth within circles. The times I was in uni, I never really understood how important being in student accommodation would be, and so found it very hard to make friends and find my place. I am so lost. I don't feel like I can just live a \"normal\" life any more, but also feel a million miles away psychologically from this eye-of-a-needle dream life i always envision. Money alone, couldn't fix how i feel, I desperately crave the attention of being famous and esteemed, to have some sense of status and actually feel valued by people. I've thought about going down certain career paths just for money, but I know that this psychological burden I carry will never feel alleviated until I start to feel valued by people. I've been stuck in this dopamine craving cycle for God-knows how long, between junk food, PMO and social media/Youtube browsing. Other people even found togetherness in gaming growing up, but I did not, as even that required dedication and practice. I hated growing up without a dad growing up, I felt it heavy when I saw all the other lads at sports growing up with their dads, and I didn't have one. I felt alien for this, and I felt alien for being an only child. I only realised as I grew up, how ashamed I felt for being raised by just a mum, and not having any brothers etc. Any attempts my mother made at instilling discipline in me growing up, I more or less rejected, albeit unconsciously, I realised later that this was because she was a mother and not my dad. I am not one of those normal cases of a child of a runaway dad. I was actually born as a result of a drunken hookup, my mother doesn't even know my dad beyond his surname and a few other details, and as a result, we have never been able to find him. My mother had her own circumstances which led her life astray when she was younger, and while I try to bear this in mind, I cannot help but feel at least some level of deep resentment towards her. Our relationship has somewhat improved in the years since I originally moved out of home, and even moreso since my suicide attempts, but I still cannot fully shake off this feeling of resentment, especially when I cannot attribute it to my father as such (technically I can, but realistically I'd be directing that towards a ghost figure as I have no idea who he is). I can't count the amount of times I have said in my own head that \"i wish my mum just aborted me\". I know that part of the reason my mother did continue to have me and raise me, was to give herself a sense of purpose, which she felt she needed at the time. And yet again i feel an involuntary sense of resentment towards her again for this, as honestly at times, I feel like she could have given herself, and any other potential children of hers a better and more psychologically balanced life if she just held out until she got her own life and a proper steady relationship. And i know that it may be perceived as feminine or childlike to be blaming things on my parents, and to be fair, blame is a stage I want to be past by now, but as I said, this feels like a psychological mountain I have been, and still am carrying alone. I have pretty much always, and still feel invisible. I hate feeling like this. I look at the average dude who i perceive to have gone through a normal middle class experience, had a friend group, had a girlfriend(s) or at least got female attention, had the fun uni experience, and will now enjoy a decent middle class life again after uni, and I cannot help but feel resentment to this type of guy, mostly because I feel like I can never be like them. I have a friend like this, and I feel some level of jealousy and resentment towards him, not really because we went to uni around the same time and he just seems to have had a way better experience of it than I have had. Look I know that most people's lives are not as sweet as they seem, I know this to be the case for that friend that I just mentioned, but this is how skewed my thinking is psychologically, I have been to numerous therapists/counsellors/psychologists over the years and no amount of cognitive behavioural therapy or nothing alone can change this, not the self help books or the motivational videos can change my mindset at this point. Only the WORK can at this point, but God, I feel so alone in this, I have always found it next to impossible to be disciplined, that's not to say i've never experienced success in the short term in areas like fitness, but my hyperactive, overthinking mind has always led me astray, dragged me down. It has dragged me to multiple different cities, countries, sports, dragged me through numerous degrees and courses, although none of them successfully, its had me in and out of numerous religious and spiritual lines of thinking. I know success requires rising above your emotions and pushing on, but I only seem capable of doing this for short periods, before the loneliness and frustration hits me, and I drag myself down. The feeling of being miserable is addictive, and it's all I know, and it guides pretty much everything I do, even when I don't realise it is. Before I ramble on all day, is there anyone else who might feel they could even remotely relate to how I feel, who might have had slightly similar circumstances? I know my life circumstances are far from the worst, but I find it hard to not let my mind guide me into this way of thinking. I just wish I had people around me who understood. I wish I had brothers. I wished I wasn't always chasing a feeling of acceptance everywhere I go, even with my own family. Does anyone want to share their burden with me, who wants to turn their life around, but struggle to do this alone. I really feel like I know what I need to do to get to where I want to be, but it's the doing it alone part that holds me back. Thank you guys.",

Nothing comes easy to me, everything always goes wrong for me... these are the things I've told myself. But when I really think about it, I see that the common denominator in all these stressful situations (bad bosses, relationship issues, friendship problems, etc) is ME. I am almost ALWAYS in a crisis mode, and it's exhausting. And I tend to blame everyone else for my problems, very woe is me, but I can see pretty clearly that I'm the cause of most of them. It's one thing after another.\n\nWith all this being said, what I'm facing is that I'm incredibly embarrassed and sad to be seen as the friend/person who is chaotic and draining to be around. I want to be a good friend, and not be a bummer. I try very hard to show my friends I'm there for them all the time, and I've definitely improved on a lot of my selfish behaviours as in the past I just don't think I realized how chaotic I was and how I made everything about me and how I was the one bringing the drama. But even with these improvements and being more self aware, I just know that my close friends are tired of me already and I can't change how I've acted previously.\n\nI want to learn to be better. I'm going to start therapy consistently this month now that I can afford it, and I'm hoping that helps, but does anyone else have any tips? I just don't want to be that person and it makes me sad to know I have been. Do I just need to make new friends and change who I am for them so I'm not like this? I'm struggling as I don't think it's healthy to bottle everything up all the time, friends do talk to each other about big life things after all, but I no longer want to be seen as a drag so it seems easier to say nothing..\n\nHas anyone here been this friend before, or been a friend to someone in constant crisis? What did you do/how did you handle it? I just want to be better, for myself and for my loved ones.",

Maybe this is only limited to girls and women. So men, let me know if you just randomly talk about other people with your friends. \n\nEven if I have a bad interaction with somebody I don’t even mention it. \n\nI just feel very “odd one out” because I’ve recently realized that all my friends talk about me and about the things I’ve said and done to other people. Why is this a thing?\n\nI’ll say something in private to my friend and the next day I’ll hear it being joked about by our other group members.\n\nI’ve also noticed that people usually stick as my friend and use me to vent because they know I don’t talk about others. \n\nI’ve grown up thinking that every interaction with my friend was only limited to us…maybe this is also why I seem to place so much meaning and value into relationships than are actually there. My friends usually do some f-ed up thing that catches me off guard. Because I thought we were on the same wavelength but they actually see me in a different way than what is portrayed in our interactions. (Since they go and have conversations about it elsewhere). \n\nI do want to mention that I was severely bullied when I was around 11-14 years old. The other kids basically attacked me whenever *anything* came out of my mouth. They especially hated when I told my opinion about another person or told them about what they did. That specifically got me into a whole lot of trouble. Also they would nitpick everything I did and gossiped and hated me to no avail. \nFrom that time forward, I promised my self that I would never talk about anyone again.",

I took up this challenge about reading 100 books within a year, (I’m nowhere near completing the goal but it’s fun) this sent me down a pretty deep rabbit hole of self-development and evolutionary biology and other boring stuff recently and there’s something that I feel is less talked about.\n\nAlright, let's talk about masculinity, folks. It's a really complex concept that's been defined and redefined over the years, but apparently, some folks still haven't figured out that giving back to the community is a pretty important attribute. I mean, sure, go ahead and focus on all that red pill and self-help nonsense, I mean obviously, the whole sphere is not nonsense but I do find that it is increasingly becoming hard to filter through all the BS.  But let’s go back to the stuff I think is missing today, I absolutely believe that you should approach your life as if you are writing a script for a badass movie but remember that every hero's story ends with them giving back to the community. You know, because it's not really heroic unless you're doing it for someone else. I mean yeah, you don’t devote your entire life to it but I really don’t see people talking much about giving back to the community, a community or any community for that matter.\n\nTake a look at some of the popular mythical masculine heroes across different cultures like European, Indian, and Chinese. They all have this one common trait of giving back to the community. Hercules is known for his incredible strength and heroism, but apparently, that wasn't enough for him. After his heroic deeds, he became a protector of the people and continued to help those in need. Because, you know, what's the point of being a hero if you're not going to help others?\n\nThen there's Arjuna from Indian mythology, who's not only a skilled archer and warrior but also has compassion and wisdom. After winning a great battle, he becomes a king and rules justly, always putting the needs of his people first. Because what good is being a king if you're not going to help out your subjects?\n\nAnd of course, we can't forget Sun Wukong from Chinese mythology, the monkey king with incredible strength and magical powers. He's known for his mischievousness and his battles against demons and other supernatural beings, but guess what? He's also a protector of the innocent and often uses his powers to help those in need. Because what good is all that adventure when you can’t help out your fellow man?\n\nIn case you are wondering, yeah I am literally turning into uncle Ben over here, and going all “With great power comes great responsibility”. Duh! Do you know why? I’ve been reading a bit of Carl Jung’s work and I believe, the most significant struggle of a man's life is about being useful. And being useful can mean a lot of things, but helping someone without expecting anything in return is one of the most basic. Without these men, society would crumble. So yeah, giving back to the community is not only a responsibility but also a way of fulfilling one's potential as a man. But hey, what do I know? I'm just a pretentious dude who is trying to become a better writer. Tbh, the whole thing is sort of like a rant, where I can just shout, WHY AREN’T MORE PEOPLE DOING THIS?\n\nNow when I say giving back, I don't necessarily mean giving money or charity. It can be any cause where a bit of your time would be helpful. For example, advising men on Reddit with grooming, (I personally try doing something similar to this by trying to help everyone who approaches me in dms asking for advice on how to start a career in my field which is data science), or even cleaning a bit of your neighborhood even for one hour a week, volunteering, tutoring, or helping others who are struggling in a field that you are skilled in. As long as it's making someone else's life better by at least a small margin. But again, what do I know? I'm just a keyboard warrior. But I swear it does make me feel a bit better.\n\nI get it, giving back isn't an easy task. It's so much easier to be addicted to our phones and complain about what's wrong with the world than to actually look at the good around us. But hey, giving back might not cure depression, but it's a good place to start. And you can start small. For example, volunteering at a local charity for an hour or two, donating clothes or other goods to a shelter, or simply helping a neighbor with their groceries. These actions may seem insignificant, but they can make a big difference in someone's life. Like, trust me… these small actions do add up. I am friends with all my neighbors, and honestly, my apartment building feels like a way different environment than it was a few months ago. It used to be a place I live and now it feels like a home where I belong. I can’t put it into words\n\nAlso, one thing that I believe is that you should focus on making this part of your identity. This means making it a part of who you are. Instead of just saying \"I should help more people,\" start saying \"I am someone who helps others.\" This same thought process made me pick up writing, stop smoking weed every day and do lots of other things. Even the job I have now was forwarded by someone who I befriended in a data science workshop, I was a budtender working minimum wage trying to break into the data science career so I attended a bunch of these meets online to make connections. He was building a portfolio and I told them that I could help them build one for free. A few weeks later he forwards me a job posting thinking that it would be the perfect fit for me. Fast forward a few months I finally make it into the field. You never know how your actions come back.\n\nSo yeah, give back and just don’t focus on yourself.",

        "text": "I have high functioning autism and OCD. For almost a year and a half (three years for some circumstances) I haven’t been able to enjoy being a part of my favorite fandoms, browsing images, fanart, watching videos, and communicating with fans because of a bad uncontrollable habit I have formed of disliking people or getting really upset and mentally challenged when someone in the fandom likes other entertainment I don’t. It all started when I became a diehard fan of Fire Emblem, a high fantasy tactical RPG series. Ever since I started forming strong distaste of 99.9% of real-world-setting entertainment with supernatural powers, magic, unrealism, etc I have identified myself as a high fantasy fan, preferring fantasy and unrealism to take place in its own “a la Middle Earth world” like LOTR. So when I saw fellow diehard Fire Emblem fans like franchises I find distaste with (Persona and Atlus games is the most common example) it became incredibly challenging to be a part of the fandom, and any other fandoms too. I know it’s completely normal to share interest in only one, maybe two or three entertainment franchises as someone else (my younger sister also enjoys high fantasy but also stuff I’m reallllllly not into like Stranger Things, Harry Potter, or recently, The Last of Us, but I still love her because she’s my sister) but I must have formed a habit of OCD or something because it’s incredibly awkward when someone in a fandom I’m a part of likes a franchise I dislike. My family and I started being massively invested into Star Wars (especially Mandalorian!) and even though I love Star Wars, I realize that the vast majority of Star Wars fans tend to also enjoy superhero movies (massive dislike) and George Lucas’ other work, Indiana Jones (also not a fan).\n\nI really don’t want to feel like this anymore! How can I stop being upset like this anymore so I could enjoy being a fan of stuff and not have massive head-quarrels with other fans?",

        "text": "First, sorry if I commit any misspellings, English is not my main language.\n\nI (M18) started talking with a really nice girl (20), and we instantly connected with each other. She was incredible in every aspect of the word, and my stereotype for an \"Ideal Girl\". She reads books, goes to the gym, has an incredible body, a beautiful face and hair, and is really ambitious. Literally my perfect girl.\n\nThe fact is, we both liked each other, we both started to talk/text till the midnight, and we were planning about being more than just friends. We were impressed by each other, and used to lust a lot for the other one. It was all like a fairy tale.\n\nOne day, I just wake up, and don't feel anything for her. We start to talk and it doesn't feels the same, she starts to flirt and it was uncomfortable for me. I really don't know why that happened.\n\nAfter a few days, I spoke to her at her birthday and told her that I did not felt the same, and it was weird. I gave her \"freedom\" (kinda autistic, ik) and told her that we shouldn't keep talking because I lost interest, and I didn't want her to feel too attached to me. I thought it would be cruel, and decided that was the best I could do.\n\nShe asked me if she did something wrong, if she could fix something about her, if I didn't like an attitude, yadayada. I said no, it just wasn't the same. She called me holding back tears, we spoke for about and hour, and then we both said goodbye.\n\nI will be honest, I don't miss her, and that's the most intriguing thing for me.\n\nI know that if I just try to speak with her on instagram, she will be happy to speak with me again. Probably really angry at first, but happy, at least. I know it, but I just don't even feel like it.\n\nShe was literally my perfect girl (I wrote my Ideal Girl Stereotype on my diary a few months ago), and even if she was a 20/10, a girl that most guys would kill just to have a chance with, I wasn't interested at all, and now I'm not even sure if I really developed any feelings for her or not at the time.\n\n¿Can somebody give me some kind of explanation? ¿Some psychological stuff or anything?\n\nI don't know why this happened to me, but I don't want this to happen again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, now, other stuff I think I should say, to add more context:\n\n\\-I'm a narcissist, a psychiatrist diagnosed me with that mental disorder, and I'm fighting with it since. I have a really strong ego, and a stronger character. (That was one of the things she liked).\n\n\\-I'm really outlandish, weird, Idk. Kinda autistic, cringe, as I said earlier. I like to feel and act with extreme confidence, like a character from a movie/book. (She described me as a character written by a woman more than once).\n\n\\-The only thing I didn't liked about her, was that she didn't gave me all that much of her attention. We are both on self-improvement (Gym, reading, meditation, all of that) and we were really busy. But it was busy to a level that sometimes, she could pass a day without even seeing my texts.\n\n\\-One time, she confessed that sometimes she just ignored me because beign attentive was not in her nature, or she just \"didn't felt\" like answering my messages. (This actually angered me for a while, but even then, when I told her calmly about this she promised to speak more with me. She was awesome communicating, and I felt really understood).\n\n\\-I really thought that she just started to feel overwhelmed from me, or my way of beign, but she tried to mantain contact with me till the last minute.\n\n\\-It always has been difficult to me to fall in love with other girls (or even being attracted to them in a more deep, intimate way). I always had at least two girls that wanted me, but I just never felt like having a relationship, this was the only girl I could think as an exception.\n\n\\-I really think I was the problem, something with me beign wrong or anything. Be as harsh as you want, I will accept it. I need to know what to do in order to know my problem and how to fix it.\n\nI don't want this to happen in the future, I want to be able to heal this.",

        "text": "Hi guys. After I finished HS I wanted to go to Uni to study Informatics Engineering. I gave up because I found programming hard to learn and also because I didn't really enjoy what I was doing there. Then I decided to pursue a course in Telecommunications &amp; Networking and I also gave up after a while. The profesors were making me and the other classmates feeling really frustrated. That demotivated me and I relised that I was wasting my time there because I wasn't learning anything. And I was also not enjoying that course. Then I decided to pursue an Administration and Accouting course. Same thing. No enjoyment, no motivation. I couldn't continue because I was also feeling like I was wasting my time there. So I gave up.\n\nOn the one hand, I don't regret that I made those decisions. Perhaps the only thing that I regret is not giving myself a chance to see if I was actually liking Informatics Engineering or not. But back then I was also dealing with BDD related to my face, and also depression. I overcame that when I turned 20. However, I was still lost and didn't know what to do with my life back then.\n\nI'm 27 years old now and I'm currently a waiter apprentice in a coffee shop/restaurant. I learn a lot here. Although physically it's quite demanding but the people here are really nice to me. They guide me and help me learn things. They don't make me feel frustrated, which I appreciate.\n\nMy goal is to become either a flight attendant, a professional gardener (for example, a bonsai gardener), a model, an actor or a parkour athlete. I would also like to work as a translator because I got a diploma in translation last year (EN &gt; ES/ES &gt; EN). This is the first thing I didn't give up on and fully finished. But it's hard to find work as a translator :(.\n\nGetting back to my original question. I don't quite understand why I was giving up so early on. But at the same time I don't really see some of those decisions like giving up but rather getting out of a situation that has me stuck. \n\nRegardless of that I learned a lot throughout the years... most people don't actually know what they want to do with their lives. Those who achieve success early on are incredily fortunate. I admire people with a strong ambition and persistence. I'm the type of person who tends to give up easily, unfortunately. I don't know if this has anything to do with it but I feel like the death of my father in 2013 really affected me. I wasn't the same anymore after that day when I heard my mom screaming in the house when she got the news that my dad had a car accident. Nothing will ever make me forget that scream. I was 17 back then.",

        "text": "So I just wanted to start of by reaching out to this subreddit just because I’m at an interesting point in my life. So I just graduated my bachelor’s degree in 2021 and I started working summer of 2022 and I enjoy the work that I’m doing (a 9 to 5) I for sure feel like I’m improving and learning a lot in my job.\n\nMoving on over to my love life, this is where it gets interesting. I was in my first relationship in 2021 which lasted only 6 months and it was a rough breakup where for me personally I felt like I was done really wrong and I felt like she didn’t really care much about me in the relationship and how she handled the breakup. Post breakup my mindset was shifted towards bettering myself. This meant doing the things that I didn’t get the chance to regularly do when I was together with her (i.e. reading, journaling, learning new things, working out). The first few months went well.\n\nEver since I started to work, I’ve always felt like after months of being single I’m finally convinced that I’m ready to start a healthy relationship this time. However I find that I don’t really have the time to put myself out there to put myself in the position to find a high value woman. With work, free time is limited and basically I only have Friday nights and the weekend to properly socialize on top of the regular chores that I have to do. I’ve resorted into dating apps but I find this quite inconsistent as I much prefer to meet people and women in person.\n\nThis turned into a domino effect where for the last few months I’ve felt extremely lonely at times and even felt like I am wasting time in my 20s. I know comparison is terrible but seeing old high school friends and college friends getting engaged or married on social media every weekend doesn’t help. I’m completely open to trying new things and meet new people but I find that maybe because I’m quite picky it’s difficult to find my type of people in the city/country I’m living in. \n\nWanted to see on this subreddit if anyone has been through something similar or have tips to get through a situation like this? Any help will be much appreciated.",

My emotional intelligence doesn’t even compare to where it was before then. I’m taking care of my physical health more, being kinder in my friendships, and overall showing up as just a better person in this world and my life. But almost daily, I find myself questioning my worth because I am single. I used to get quite a bit of attention on dating apps, and lately I’ve been struggling to get any matches. I go out on weekends and try to be approachable in bars/restaurants/etc. but it’s so hard to find people in person nowadays. I miss physical touch with a partner (or even a FWB at this point would be lovely tbh). So much. And basically all intimacy. I believe that everything happens for a reason, and so I have to believe that the universe will give me someone when the time is right. But how do I help with this struggle of believing that I’m not  good enough because I’m not in a relationship, and don’t even have a single person interested in me romantically?\n\n(Sorry for any formatting or spelling errors in advance)",

We also lived together for about 8 months. At the end of the relationship, we argued a lot and weren't happy and we knew it was coming to an end at some point. Although, I don't feel too sad about the break-up and help my head up since it happened my self-improvement journey has taken a massive hit.\n\nIt is harder for me to focus, harder for me to fall asleep, harder for me to get motivated, and harder for me to complete even basic tasks like doing a morning workout or going to the shop. I never really had problems with any of these things before. Since the break up I feel lazy and procrastinate more.\n\nMy questions to people who have had similar experiences or broke up with someone during their self-improvement journey are:\n\nHas this happened to anyone before? (is this normal)\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nHow to get back into my normal routine?",

However, I feel like I'm exerting A LOT of physical and mental energy to improve my health. Physical for the general fundamentals like exercising, remembering to take meds and maintenance, and mental for battling that kind of depression that I will take medicines and maintenance until I die.\n\nI'm exerting a lot of energy to my health to the point that I don't have any energy left to improve myself in different aspects such as intellectually, socially, or even hobbies.\n\nAlthough, this month, I'm focusing to build a habit of reading everyday for at least 30 mins. It's doing well because 30 mins is such a short time for me. After that month, I would also want to build another habit. After that month, another habit or even a personal project. And so on...\n\nAm I doing this correctly? Or is this too slow because I have to take a month to build a new habit? All advices are welcome from here on. I just feel bad and unproductive that I'm not improving enough and just focused solely on health. I want to do better and I know myself I can do better than this.\n\nAlso, do you have a habit to recommend? Or a personal project? I might use it as a guide and find something that is suitable for my situation. Thank you!",
