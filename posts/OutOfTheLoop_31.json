Also if removing her name from those pages changes who wrote them, how will young adult readers know who wrote the book? should we not support jk or buy products like Hogwarts legacy, or reach out to local towns libraries and speak out?\n\nIf we take her name off the books and give them a new slipcover, yet at the end of the day they are still the works of J.K.

Of course, I considered that probably many of the videos were taken out of their proper context.\n\nStill, one clip \\[Instagram Clip\\]([https://www.instagram.com/reel/ClR3iCXrEkn/?utm\\_source=ig\\_web\\_copy\\_link](https://www.instagram.com/reel/ClR3iCXrEkn/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)) really confused me and I couldn't think of an explanation or an appropriate context for his strange behavior. The comments seemed politically motivated and rather uninformative.\n\nIs his behavior indeed weird, or was it actually taken out of context?\n\nHope this isn't getting too political.
