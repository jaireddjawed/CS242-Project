This on the first day after we get a new edict that we cannot answer \"any general questions\" anymore to nonauthorized parties any longer.  (I love it that those who devise these CYA policies don't take calls and actively avoid handling escalations caused by such policies, but I digress)\n\nInstead of offering to help in any way that I can without a release on file, which usually had the desired effect of smoothing the waters, I had to use the \"new and improved\" talk off that I really can't answer any questions at all because there isn't a release for her.\n\nShe glosses past this, and says: \"All I need is the amount of interest my son paid last year for tax purposes.\"\n\nMe: \"Once again, this is sensitive and protected information that I cannot provide without a release.\"\n\nMom in a tone that is dangerously on the verge of a blowup: \"Jesus!\"\n\nMe: \"Tell you what, we mailed out the tax statements about two weeks ago.  Let me put in a request to have another mailed to your son and just tell him to be on the lookout from an envelope from company XYZ.  They are also available online if he needs it sooner.\"\n\nMom audibly shuffling papers in the background:  \"What, is this company XYZ?\"\n\nMe: \"Yes.\"\n\nMom: \"Oh, it's right here.\"\n\nMe: \"Great, is there anything else today?\"\n\nMom: \"No, thank you.\"  Click\n\nI just had to shake my head at that one and try and process it for a minute during my wrap up....she calls the number from a billing statement, which has our name on it, goes through the IVR, which states our name multiple times, gets through to me, and I give our full company name, and only finally realizes she had the necessary 1098E tax statement sitting in front of her the entire time.  And these people walk amongst us unattended....",

        "text": "More tales from accounting, where I get to give the callers a taste of their own medicine sometimes!\n\n\n\nThis woman was either trying to be slick, or was legitimately this stupid. Either way, I pity her employees.\n\n\n\nMe: (Company), what can I do for ya?\n\n\n\nCaller: I'm having trouble faxing you guys. Every time I send something it is either blank or illegible, and you guys keep refusing payment. It's only your company so I know it's not my fax!\n\n\n\nMe: Sorry to hear that, let me take a look at this and see what's going on.\n\n\n\nI pull up her account, and immediately notice something is... off. Hundreds of one page faxes in the last couple of years, when she should faxing once a month, if even that. Cue investigator mode.\n\n\n\nMe: Is there any particular reason you fax us everything instead of billing online? I'm just curious since billing online is so much easier, you know?\n\n\n\nC: I know! *laughs* I wish I could, but you guys won't let me! *RED FLAG*\n\n\n\nMe: Really? That's kind of strange...\n\n\n\nC: I thought so too! I try to do it online and it says I'm not authorized. *RED FLAG NUMBER 2*\n\n\n\nMe: I think I may know what's wrong. Just a moment while I check something, please.\n\n\n\nI check, and this property has not had a contract in YEARS. Many, many years. I dig some more and am shocked to find we have been paying for years without this being caught. Very likely due to the fact it was always a different person, once, a couple of times a month. I see where this is going to go, and brace myself.\n\n\n\nMe: Ma'am... Are you aware you are not contracted with us?\n\n\n\nC: Yes, they told me a while ago.\n\n\n\nMe: So you know you shouldn't be accepting the companies we work with and that you shouldn't be billing us. Like at all.\n\n\n\nC: *silence*\n\n\n\nMe: *silence*\n\n\n\n\nC: No one told me that. You've been paying so I don't see how this is a problem.\n\n\n\n\nMe: The problem is that you're getting all the benefits of working with us with none of the responsibility and without agreeing to our terms and conditions. If it was a couple of people a little while after your contract ended or if one of your workers accepted it by mistake, we work with you but this is a lot. And you're aware that you are not contracted.\n\n\n\nC: Well you guys keep sending them to me and making me take them!!\n\n\n\n\nMe: Your property would not even pull up as an option for lodging in the area, so we are not sending you anything.  These are people just walking in and you're accepting them.\n\n\n\nC: Well, I don't want to turn anyone away. \n\n\n\nMe: I can appreciate that, if you're interested in signing up again you are absolutely eligible and I can get you started on that today. However if you have no intention of signing with us I do have to ask you to stop taking our customers, effective immediately.\n\n\n\n\nC: Well then YOU need to tell YOUR employees I can't take them!\n\n\n\n\nMe: Ma'am, they are not our employees. We are a third party. We work with thousands of companies and ten times that the amount of customers that use our services. We cannot let everyone know this ONE property in this ONE state in this ONE town is not contracted. We are international. We do our best to help them find places they can stay but there's only so much we can do on our end. YOU know you cannot accept these customers, and do so anyway. YOU are the one who needs to tell them they either need to find other accommodations or pay you directly. \n\n\n\nC: Well what if they can't afford anywhere else?? Are you saying you don't care where your employees sleep, and that they can stay out in the cold??!\n\n\n\nMe: I've said no such thing. They know some places don't accept our customers and would move on. If they don't, or you are concerned for them, you or the customer are welcome to call so we can help them find somewhere or authorize direct payment with the company so they can stay. I'm warning you that if you continue to bill us like you have and do not get a contract, at some point we WILL cut you off and refuse to pay. \n\n\n\nC: WHAT?? You're saying I won't be paid even though they stayed here?? Why is it such a big deal, I don't understand why you are doing this just because I don't have a contract!!\n\n\n\n\nMe: If you will sign a contract, we are more then happy to partner with you. But you cannot keep billing us like this. At some point we will say enough is enough, you need to sign a contract or stop accepting them. In fact.... *pulls up old account* it's already happening. (Guest) on (date) has been refused payment for this exact issue. \n\n\n\nC: So you're saying just because I don't have a contract, THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY ME??\n\n\n\nMe: That's exactly what I'm saying. At least not through us. You are welcome to pursue payment directly from the customer.\n\n\n\n\nC: I DON'T HAVE ANY CONTACT INFORMATION, ALL WE HAVE IS YOUR NUMBER!!\n\n\n\nAt this point, I'm over it. She's not going to sign, so not working with us. I'm done being screamed at by this chick.\n\n\n\n\nMe: Now who's fault is that? Who's to blame when you failed to get a VALID method of payment, and any contact information? You knew you were no longer partnered with us, and billed it anyway.\n\n\n\n\nC: I'M SENDING OVER EVERYTHING AND YOU'RE GOING TO PAY ME FOR ALL OF IT! I WILL NOT PAY THIS OUT OF MY OWN POCKET-\n\n\n\n\nMe: We have already started refusing payments. Any further billing will not be accepted. \n\n\n\nC: WELL FINE FUCK YOU THEN I'M CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT WITH US!! WE WON'T TAKE ANYONE FROM YOUR SHIT COMPANY!!\n\n\n\n\nMe: That's what I've spent the last ten minutes trying to tell you to do, so thanks for your cooperation. Have a nice day.\n\n\n\n\nC: FUCK YOU! *click*\n\n\n\n\nSpent a good five minutes typing up detailed notes and laughing.",

He kept screaming at every request - saying that he didn’t need to give me the information. That I should be able to look it up for myself.\n\nWhich, yes. I could. I actually had used his phone number to pull up his account and had found the problem. Not that he was letting me speak to tell him so. \n\nFinally I cut him off and firmly but politely said;\n\n“Sir? I am being very respectful and I would appreciate the same in return. I see the problem and I can fix it. However I just need to confirm one piece of identifying info so I make sure I’m correcting your account. I would hate to be working on the wrong account because you wouldn’t fully identify yourself and force you to call back again.”\n\nAs I say these lines the VP walked by and stopped at my desk. She was known for finding problems with everything and everyone. I did my best to ignore her over my shoulder and finish, but I was sweating now!\n\nHe forcefully and loudly stated the information I needed. \n\n“Thank you. Your account is fixed and the late fee removed. Is there.....” ** click ** ......he ended the call. \n\nI took off my headset and looked at the VP, fully expecting “we need to have a conversation with your supervisor. NOW.” \n\nInstead, she looked at my department, who had all stopped working and were watching us, and told the room that “This. This is how we should be handling calls with difficult customers. Thank you, graceinthesouth. I’m going to work this into our training scripts.” \n\nShe turned and left leaving us with our jaws on the ground. I was never so relieved that asking a customer for respect gained me the respect of a VP. ",

This wasn’t my first nightmare call, but it was definitely my worst. \n\nAt the time, I worked as a retention agent for DirecTV, just keeping customers from switching to another company and all that jazz. We usually dealt with the assholes. This day was obviously no exception.\n\nI didn’t even get to finish my opening before the caller, a guy probably in his mid-50’s, started his fuss.\n\nMe: Hello-\n\nCaller: Here we go again. Don’t even start with me and don’t ask me to verify my account. Your last supervisor was a dumb c*nt and I didn’t verify my info for her either so don’t even ask.\n\nMe: /eyeroll/ Alright sir, but since you can’t verify your information I can only assist you with simple account questions. \n\nCaller: Well, princess, all I have is a simple account question that none of your other agents or supervisors can answer. But you will.\n\nMe: I will try my best, sir. (trying to stay chipper)\n\nCaller: What is the exact date you will be adding streaming services?\n\n(We hadn’t set a date for that, yet. I told him as such.)\n\nCaller: No. You know the date. You just won’t tell us. I’m calling your bluff, princess. Tell me when the exact date is that you will be adding streaming services.\n\nMe: I’m sorry sir, I do not have that information.\n\nCaller: Give me the number for your CEO.\n\nMe: We do not have that information available-\n\nCaller: Yes you do, give me the number\nMe: Sir, I’m sorry, we do not, I can give you an address-\n\nCaller: I asked for the number, princess.\n\nMe: I’m sorry sir, but my name is enkayohteebee, can you please refer to me as such?\n\nCaller: I will call you whatever I damn well please, Princess.\n\nMe: Sir I am trying my best to assist you, can we please keep the conversation civil?\n\nCaller: I will give you an ultimatum, princess (yes, these were his exact words. i was furious at this point, and actually silently angry-crying) either a) you give me the answer to my question, b) you give me the number for the CEO, or c) you tell me “F*ck off, I don’t feel like working on a Saturday because I am lazy and stupid.”\n\nMe: I will not say that, sir.\n\nCaller: Then give me the answer or the number.\n\nMe: I do not have that information, sir.\n\nCaller: Then tell me to f*ck off.\n\nMe: I’m sorry sir, but no. I would like to keep our conversation civil.\n\nHe kept telling me to tell him to f*ck off. Maybe it was some way to get me in trouble or maybe it was a weird fantasy, I don’t know. This went on for TWO HOURS. And it only did because we are not allowed to hang up or transfer without customer permission and he refused to let me transfer to a supervisor. He literally stayed on the phone for two hours verbally abusing me. \n\nFinally my team leader listened in for a while, understood what an asshole this guy was and had a supervisor on the floor take my headset and resume the conversation. I was in tears, not because he had hurt my feelings, but because he frustrated me to no end. Took my lunch and ended up taking the rest of the day off. Luckily it was my Friday, so woo! Long weekend. \n\nOh, he called my supervisor Princess too. Which is funny, because my supervisors name was Kevin, and had an unmistakably deep masculine voice. He stayed on the phone with Kevin for two more hours.\n\nProbably the best evidence of karma I’ve ever seen in my life is DirecTV’s policy on agent abuse. You verbally abuse an agent, They send you a phone bill. $0.68 per minute for every call you made and harassed an agent. This guy had 6 hours worth of abusive behavior on his log. I wish I could have seen the look on his face when he received that bill. ",

If he got a dude when calling in he would ask to be transferred to connectivity, with instructions to not be called back if the line dropped. And if he got a dude when he was transferred he would hang up and try again. (which is why he didn't want a call back) \nDefinitely my most memorable customer.",

I started work at a big cell phone call center. I went through the 6 week training in the class then it was time to do mock calls. Those went well, so we were put on the phones to take calls. We weren't worried about our Average Call Times *ACT*, but more focused on if we could answer the questions and get the sales pitch in at the end.\n\n  This was my second call I had ever taken from a live person, the first was just an old lady who doesn't understand taxes being raised. So here we go! Me = M, Caller = C\n\n  M: Thank you for calling asklfjakf, my name is aldkfja how can I help you today?\n\n  C: You have two minutes to fix my problem or I'm going to get very angry.\n\n  *This being my second live call ever, I'm scared. It also seemed to not pull up her information on the screen as well, so I know verification is going to take 30-45 seconds already IF the system didn't freeze, great.*\n\n  M: Can I get your phone number to get to your account?\n\n  C: You should already have that.\n\n  M: I'm sorry. It seems the system didn't pull it up, what was the number you put into the system?\n  C: I didn't put one in, you should know who I am.\n\n  M: Ma'am I can't get to your account unless you give me the number and verify it.\n\n  C: UGH fine xxxxxxxxxxx\n\n  **I'll skip to the fun part, about 10 minutes into the call. By this time my trainer had tapped into the phone call because I'm holding back tears from being yelled at. **\n\n  C: You're wrong that's not what's wrong with my bill.\n\n  M: Ma'am from what I see,  you ordered something from a game site for your phone, I can't see the specifics but it says it's from x company. You can see these charges on your bill.\n\n  C: THAT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THERE, I TOLD YOU YOU HAD TWO MINUTES TO FIX MY DAMNED ISSUE AND YOU'RE USELESS. I SHOULD JUST BOMB THE CALL CENTER YOU WORK IN YOU DON'T DESERVE THIS JOB OR TO LIVE. I'M GOING TO FUCKING KILL YOU.\n\n\n  So at this point I've muted my headset, I'm balling, I can't understand why this woman is screaming at me and my trainer rolls up to me and does this.\n\n  T: Put her on a hold.\n\n  M: Should I tell her I'm doing so?\n\n  T: Go back, say \"Thank you for holding\" and press hold.\n\n  M: *So I unmute* \"Thank you for holding.\" *Places on hold*\n\n  This is where my trainer told me to put myself in break and take an extra break to clean myself up. She said she'd handle the call from there. I asked how long she was going to be on hold the response I got was 4 minutes, which made me smile a little.\n\nAt the end of the day, my trainer told me that she ended up hanging up on the lady and notating in the account that when she calls again to place her on hold and let a manager deal with her since she's known for berating agents.\n\n  Long story short, second call ever I got a death threat. Cried for a good 15 minutes, and my boss got my revenge. \n\n  Stop threatening people for charges you make!",

I advised him that it was me who talked to him earlier, and I explained what he needed to do in great detail. \n\nThen he proceeded to backtrack, saying that's not what the email we sent out said. Yes, I understand that...but either way, I told him what he needed to do. Then he claimed he did a step in getting it fixed days ago. I reminded him he did it on the phone with me. Another backtrack of him doing that step twice, but nope. You can only do it once. \n\nOf course he requested a manager, and that manager went ahead and gave him a coupon. I kind of understand, as there was an error when he tried to fix it, but it was partly buyer error (and completely lied about it, to boot!).",

        "text": "In my late teens, I worked as a phone rep in the call center for a Christian television company. The Israelites had ten commandments, but we had two:\n\n1. Thou shalt not shake the snack machine.\n2. Thou shalt not grant a refund (or even imply that one might be possible) to a customer.\n\nThe first was due to to the snack machine being old and mostly broken down. It was not a matter of *if* it would steal your money, but a matter of *when*. When that fateful day came, you were to report it. Your sustenance may be delayed until reimbursement, but make no mistake: you *would* be fired if you shook the vending machine. It perpetually had a post-it note taped with many layers of scotch tape to the front of it warning of your termination upon so much as tilting the machine. In fact, that seemed to be the only sure-fire way of getting fired.\n\nThe second was a bit more nuanced. While it appears to be an utterly insane policy that refunds would never be given out, it makes a bit more sense in context. You see, this company provided programming from a satellite. Unfortunately, they did not have nearly enough money to launch their own satellite. What they *did* have was exclusive rights to a particular satellite position. They used that to leverage a deal with a very well-known satellite company with a name that is a bit too on the nose.\n\nSatellite Company got to use the position in the sky for their own programming, while the company I worked for got to use a select spectrum of the satellite for their own programming. The catch was that we had to send a request through Satellite Company whenever we needed to activate a new customer's programming. That initial signal cost roughly the same as a three month subscription to our thirty-some-odd channels.\n\nBecause the company wasn't affiliated with any particular Christian denomination, the higher ups had no issue with providing a channel that was specifically Catholic, another specifically Baptist, etc. There were only a few, but those were enough.\n\nThis scenario played out way too often:\n\nA customer would pay for a month of programming. While flipping through the channels, they would end up seeing something they disagreed with. Maybe they thought the Catholic church was the whore of Babylon and the Pope was the antichrist. Maybe they saw a woman preaching. Maybe they couldn't believe a so-called Christian music network would feature bands with drums and/or screaming. Regardless of the cause of their outrage, they would call up to cancel their subscription. Often, they would demand a refund.\n\nThe company was hemorrhaging money.\n\nThe chosen solution was to charge for three months in advance, all of which was non-refundable for any reason except if the customer was physically unable to get service due to something obstructing the signal from the satellite. On top of that, prepaying for a year was always incentivized. Pay for the year, you got a lower per-month rate and something extra thrown in. I was there when *The Passion of the Christ* was released, so we threw in a copy of that on DVD.\n\nOne night, a woman called in speaking with a pretty thick accent. Before I could get any information from her, she said that a woman named Barbara was talking to her the last time she called in, and Barbara told her to call back that night for her refund. Now, there was indeed a Barbara that worked in the call center. In fact, she was a supervisor and was more than capable of issuing a refund if she decided that the situation called for one. I knew something wasn't right about this situation immediately.\n\n\"I'll need a little information to pull up your account.\"\n\nI didn't mention that we were required to leave notes on the account for every single call from a customer. When I was able to open her account, I immediately went to the notes. Sure enough, the last note was left by Barbara earlier that day.\n\nThe entirety of the note was:\n\n&gt;UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES IS THIS WOMAN TO GET A REFUND!\n\nI cringed. I hated being the bearer of bad news, especially to someone that had made such an impression on the usually calm Barbara to cause her to leave a note in all caps.\n\n\"Well, I do see that you spoke with Barbara earlier regarding a refund. Unfortunately, the note left on your account says that we are note able to provide one.\"\n\nThere was a dread moment of silence on the line. I had no idea what was coming next, but I knew that it wouldn't be pleasant.\n\n\"You teef! You Satan!\" After those two short sentences, the rest of what she was saying was unintelligible yelling, occasionally punctuated by a very clear curse word.\n\nAs a rule, we were not supposed to hang up on customers. However, the higher-ups also didn't want their employees to suffer abuse. If a customer was yelling, cursing, or otherwise being uncivil, we were allowed to give a warning that we would disconnect the call if the behavior continued.\n\nI tried to wait for a break in the yelling, but this woman must've been a master of circular breathing because one never came.\n\nI took a deep breath and loudly, calmly said, \"Ma'am, I'm going to have to ask you to stop being abusive, or I will have to end this call.\"\n\nEither she didn't hear me or she didn't care: the screaming continued. Confident that I had tried my best, I hung up and left a note on her account.\n\nWhen I came into work the next evening, there was a post-it note on my monitor.\n\n&gt;Sorry. -Barbara\n\nI looked up the woman's account and saw that she had called in multiple times throughout the day, still trying to claim that Barbara told her she could have a refund and that the man she spoke to last night was very rude to her.\n\nI never found out what caused her to want a refund in the first place. I believe Barbara told me something like that the customer had started off their conversation by saying that we were in league with the devil and that she was looking forward to Barbara's children rotting in hell.\n\nFrom what some of my coworkers told me about their horror stories, this was relatively tame.",

        "text": "I'm a claims rep for a large insurance company. That means most of my day involves being yelled at for things outside my control. Many of my most furious callers are trying to commit insurance fraud. Spoilers: they're not very good at it.\n\n\nI received a new claim where my insured backed into another gentleman's parked vehicle. Liability is straightforward; he hit a parked car. I expected it to be a nice quick easy claim, but who am I kidding that never happens. I call up the insured and discuss the claim, and delicately explain that it was his fault.\n\n\nInsd: It's not my fault. I didn't cause any damage!\n\n\nMe: Well sir, I can't really find anything the other party did wrong, can you? We have a duty when backing our vehicle to-\n\n\nInsd: But I didn't cause any damage so there shouldn't be a claim! And I know all that damage was there before the accident because I've worked on cars for twenty years!\n\n\nAt this point, I'm looking at the muched grill of the Ford Explorer that wasn't quite big enough for my insured to see in his rearview mirror. No damage alright...\n\n\nInsd: And I have a witness to prove it!\n\n\n\nHe provides me with the witnesses names and phone number, and I promise to give her a call. As standard protocol, I ask him if he knows the witness. Nope, only met her after the accident. Great. I let him know that I'll be sending him letter stating that he is at fault for the accident, but if we do not find any damage he caused then his insurance rates will not be affected. \n\n\nI go to call the witness, and something is off about her name: it's familiar. Not a celebrity, not a note I put in the wrong claim... wait. No, he couldn't be that stupid. But he was. He actually gave me the name of another driver on his policy and said he didn't know them.  \n\n\nBut he gave me the name, so I was obligated to call. The witness picked up on the first ring, and as soon as I introduced myself, she said that there was no damage to the other car. I hadn't asked. She happily agreed to go on the record and tell me all about it. The witness provided her full name and correct spelling, date of birth, address, and driver's license without so much as asking why. I probably could have gotten her bank PIN and SSN were I as unscrupulous as my insured. Sure enough, all exact matches for the information in our file. So I ask the million dollar question: Do you know our insured?\n\n\nWitness: I've never met him before. Not even once.\n\n\nMe: How about when you gave him your phone number?\n\n\nWitness: I guess I met him once. \n\n\nReal convincing. \n\n\nMe: So, you're not on his insurance policy? \n\n\nWitness: I don't even have a car.\n\n\nI look at the registration. The witness was listed as the registered owner. My insured was driving his witness' car. I somehow managed to politely end the call without asking her if her pants had burst into flames. \n\n\nWe paid in full for the damages our insured most definitely caused to the innocent driver's vehicle with no issues whatsoever. My insured, instead, had his policy cancelled because it turns out that he has a pattern of really terrible lies. The witness was his mother. I'm sure they never met when she gave birth to him, and they must have just taken shifts living at their shared address. They are both under investigation by the National Insurance Crime Bureau, because it turns out that were running a scam through the auto repair business he claimed to work for for twenty years. And me? I'm mostly surprised that there was a grain of truth in his story. I shrugged, chugged my coffee, and got back on the phone.\n\n\nTL;DR: \"I've never met my mother before, I swear!\" -my insured",

I’ve worked in Tech Support and am generally super laid back and always respect that it’s a person on the other end on that line.  Today I heard a lot of background noise on the calls, and my support specialist ended up getting stuck with a frozen system while he tried to pull up my account.  During one of the pauses I heard through the phone a muffled customer voice just screaming at the guy sitting close to the specialist I was on the line with - no joke, that was blasting from another agents headset.  So I overhear this agent kicking up his customer support skills and doing his best to handle the situation.\n\nMeanwhile I’ve been waiting on the phone with my current agent for about 8 minutes while he triages his system before he ends up transferring me to another agent.  The fear in his voice was audible when he told me that his system was frozen and had no option but to transfer me.  I was straight up, “no worries man, systems fail.  I gotcha. Go ahead and patch me through and you have a good rest of your day.”\n\nIt’s little things like always catching an agents name, asking them too how they are doing, and just being cool on the line that I think can help lower the stress of what bullshit is so frequently tossed to the front line.\n\nI got off the phone finally and I kid you not I heard shock and gratitude on the line when I wished him a great rest of his shift and day.  Basic decency and professionalism, right? So hard to come by?\n\nI joked with my colleague about how shocked and happy both agents were that I was a decent human voice on the line.  And my colleague said, you’re probably the only nice voice they’ve heard in two weeks.\n\nThat makes me so sad to consider.  So anyway I just wanted to toss in a note here and say hurrah for all our call center agents working the frontline. Y’all da real MVPs,\n\nI really wish more people had the experience in their live of working a help desk, call center, or serving tables because it instills this sense of decency and professionalism while problem solving or *receiving a service* that so much of the rest of the world lacks.\n\n ",

The account came up as being one month old, but with 7 lines of service already disconnected. \n\nThe customer was very nice but very confused. She said that she already talked to our fraud department about the account. She fell for a scam for a guy claiming to be an FBI agent telling her to open an account with our company and to send him all the devices that she could buy from us. She ended up buying 4 iPhone X’s, an iPhone 8 Plus and two galaxy tablets on monthly payments. This totaled over $5,200 in devices alone. \n\nThe fraud department left notes along the lines of “CUSTOMER WAS BULLIED INTO BUYING THESE DEVICES FROM AN OUTSIDE SOURCE BUT SHE IS THE ONE WHO PURCHASED THEM SO THIS ISN’T A VALID (company) FRAUD CLAIM. SHE IS FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL CHARGES. TRANSFERRING HER TO CUSTOMER SERVICE.”\n\nI was *floored*, but there really was no recourse for her from our company. Since she was the one who came into the store, bought the devices, and signed the contracts, we really couldn’t waived the costs that she is going to incur. Her first statement came to be about $800 and there were clear remarks to not credit a single penny. Even though the story was believable (people fall for scams like this all the time) it was not verifiable so she was indeed responsible to pay for the services she opened up. I blacklisted the devices and talked to my supervisor who also felt bad, but stated the same thing. \n\nAll in all, I wish I could have helped her out, but I can’t bend the rules just because I feel sorry for her.

Will do the best I can.\n\nSo this idiot customer has been calling for three fucking weeks* every single day asking for me. I return her calls as soon as I can, but I'm on multiple lines and one of the busiest CSRs on floor. If she gets anyone else and I'm unable to take the call, she hangs up on them.\n\n This woman wanted a change made that the store she bought it through didn't call us to make sure they could do (we are the manufacturer). So basically we are dealing with the store's fuck up. The customer was offered for us to modify the product to make it work the way she asked, she refused. She was offered money to keep as is (a perfectly functioning order, just not with the operational option she wanted), she refused.\n\nFinally we offered to remake the product at no charge. She refused. Now mind you, this was all offered within a week, but since she wouldn't complain to anyone but me, it's dragged on for half a month.\n\nPretty much what she wants is for us to remake it at no charge AND refund her all of her money, which means we lose thousands of dollars twice.\n\nThe thing that threw me over the edge today was that I had a message from a supervisor today saying she filed a complaint because I was not \"taking her seriously\". Really?! The offers were coming from over my head and I qave her all the information I had. I sent multiple emails to our sups letting them know that she would rather talk to them than me because they were the ones making the offers.\n\nThankfully, they know the complaint is unfounded and think she's nuts... But I have no idea what this bitch is gonna do next week when I'm out of the office for surgery. I cringe at the though of checking my voicemail on my first day back.\n\nI had to vent... I literally lost sleep last night thinking about this broad calling in today and chewing me out again for my daily dose of insanity.\n\nUpdate: I was right. The customer wants a no charge remake AND a full refund. Jesus Christ.\n\nUpdate 2: came back from a week of medical leave to find out this customer is filing a complaint with BBB and also disputing charges with her credit card company. In the BBB complaint, she plans to mention my name personally... Supervisor had no choice but to take over the calls when I was out and the customer thinks I ignored her for the last week.

        "text": "I'm a claims rep for a large insurance company. This means that most of my days involves being yelled at for things outside my control, and being lied to on a daily basis. On this particular warm summer day, I was subject to an angry rant over $49.21. \n\nThis gentleman, and I use the term loosely, was the claimant, meaning we did not insure him but he was in a collision with someone we did insure. Our company is obscenely nice to insureds. We'll let them get away with almost anything. But claimants... let's just say we get to be frank with them. Our insured was very much at fault and we had offered to repair his vehicle. There wasn't much damage to his vehicle, but Mr. Claimant treated it as though our insured had run over his infant. This minor auto accident was nothing less than an affront to him. \n\nNow, one thing I'd learned as a seasoned claims rep is that saying anything on the phone was like not saying anything at all, because our calls are not recorded. I developed the habit of sending an email after every single conversation so no one could change what I'd said, and also so some of my slower insureds wouldn't call me back and as me the exact same question again. \n\nBack to Mr. Claimant. I warned him on day one that we do not cover rental insurance, and immediately after, sent him an email warning him of the same. The rental insurance was redundant and unnecessary; he carried collision coverage on his own policy. I'm sure it will come as a great shock to you that Claimant bought the very insurance I told him not to, and then expected me to pay for it.\n\n\nClmt: Your rental company charged me! What are they? Stupid?\n\n\nAs you will see, this was a bit of an ironic comment. The rental company bills the insurance company directly. If a claimant follows the rules, they shouldn't be charged anything. \n\n\nMe: I see the rental company billed us for your three days of rental. What did they charge you for?\n\n\nClmt: This accident  wasn't my fault. You don't understand! I shouldn't be paying for anything!\n\n\nMe: That is correct, provided you followed the rules we discussed. Did you return the rental car with damages?\n\n\nClmt: HOW DARE YOU-\n\n\nMe: Then you must have purchased the rental insurance.\n\n\nClmt: So reimburse me!\n\n\nMe: Sir, you were advised in our conversation on x date at x time that I could not cover that for you, and then I emailed you on x date at x time to remind you of that fact. I'm sorry, as I stated then, I am unable to cover any rental insurance and cannot reimburse you.\n\n\nClmt: But your insured did this! Why do I have to pay?\n\n\nMe: You bought something I explicitly warned you not to buy. Twice.\n\n\nClmt: How was I supposed to know? We never discussed it!\n\n\nMe: Allow me to read the email I sent you on x date at x time sir. \"The rental company will offer you additional insurance, sometimes called a damage waiver, for a daily rate. This is not something Insurance Company can cover, as it is redundant. You are already protected by your collision coverage in the rental vehicle.\"\n\n\nClmt: I can read! Why are you so condescending?\n\n\nMe: So you were informed then.\n\n\nClmt: I DON'T HAVE TIME TO READ EMAILS!\n\n\nMe: I'm sorry, sir. I am unable to reimburse me.\n\n\nThere were a few brief moments of silence while the hamster in his brain huffed and puffed on his wheel. \n\nClmt: I'm going to sue you. \n\n\nMe: Alright. Here is my fax number for your attorney's letter of representation.\n\n\nClmt: Personally. \n\n\nI had to put him on mute for a few seconds while I laughed. That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works. \n\n\nMe: And just what are your damages?\n\n\nClmt: The $49.21 you owe me! My lawyer will get it back!\n\n\nMe: Okay sir. Let's say for a moment you find a lawyer who will represent you for less than $50 - you won't by the way. Those don't exist. You would have to pay your lawyer from your $49.21.\n\n\nClmt: No! You'll be paying him.\n\n\nMe: Secondly, due to the amount of money involved, this would be a case in small claims court, where a lawyer cannot represent you. And you'll have to pay to file a suit. Do you know how much the court filing fees are in our county?\n\n\nClmt: You'll be paying for those!\n\n\n\nMe: Yeah, I'll have to pass. Sir, they're $435. That means in order to get your $49.21 back, you would have to pay nearly ten times that and then explain to a judge that you bought something I told you not to buy, twice, and now expect me to pay for it. I'll be sending you a declination letter for your damages now. \n\n\nClaimant then proceeded to yell at me in Korean for another thirty minutes. I had him on mute while I planned my vacation. Ten months, only ten months away! To this day, I have not heard from his lawyer.",

No seconds, no lines of credit, ect.\n\n\nI had given this caller a very generous quote, she accepted my offer and I sent off the paperwork. I get the appraisal back, and the house was worth hundreds of thousands of dollars more than the loan I was trying to buy.\n\n\nMy heart sunk, because I knew this just had to be a second mortgage and I've just sunk the cost of an appraisal on something worthless.\n\n\nI call her back and ask her if this is a second mortgage.\n\n\nCaller: \"Why, yes of course it is.

        "text": "I was training a new employee today. The calls were smooth all afternoon, I listened while they spoke to the customer and assisted when needed. Then we got this a caller who made me so angry I cut my trainee off mid-sentence.\n\n\n\nBefore anyone says anything, I'll remind you all again this is a small call center dealing with accounting. We are nice and will do all we can to help you but if we are not the typical call center employee punching bag that has to take abuse. I have no problems getting stern with a caller. We are also all very close and we adore our new coworker, and I will not let someone take advantage of this because they are understandably not super confident yet and afraid of saying the wrong thing.\n\n\n\nTrainee: This is _____, how can I help you?\n\n\n\nCaller: Yeah this is (business), I called earlier because I'm trying to bill this online but your website is having an error.\n\n\n\nT: Ok! Give me a moment to pull up your information. (Creating an excuse to put them on hold to check with me. I had taken this call earlier in the day without them so they had no idea of what was going on. I filled them in.) Thanks for holding! I see that our website was having a problem, and that my colleagues attempted to fix it earlier and had given you some advice on what to do after that. Were you able to do what they had said?\n\n\n\nC: That's not what happened. Where are you getting your information? They said they were going to fix it.\n\n\n\nT: (Starting to get a worried look, I let them know to just stay cool and repeat what I had told them.) I'm sorry but I just spoke to them and they said they had given you some instructions to follow. You just needed to-\n\n\n\nC: NO, I don't need to do anything! They said they were fixing it!\n\n\n\nT: They said they were putting it back online for you so you could collect some information, then for you to fax it to us and cancel the online billing. Were you able to get that information?\n\n\n\nC: No, because THEY TOLD ME ALL I HAD TO DO WAS CANCEL IT AND IT WOULD BE FIXED.\n\n\n\nT: I apologize for the misunderstanding, please let me speak to my coworkers again to confirm this. \n\n\n\nI hadn't intervened at this point because this was their first irate caller, and they were handling it as well as they could, being new. I assure them what they are saying is right, and that since he had not followed instructions his options were now to call the customer to get this information or to speak to a different department to see if we could speak to the customer for them, or both. They tell the caller this and he does not take it well.\n\n\n\nC: Why should I have to do anything when I was told it was taken care of??\n\n\n\nMe: *eyeroll*\n\n\n\nT: Sir you've misunderstood, we can still help you but we now have fewer options then we did before. I understand it's frustrating but we will do all we can for you. \n\n\n\nC: You're not helping me do anything! You're just telling me it's my problem now after they tricked me into cancelling everything!! I've never spoken to a more useless person in my life! *starts shouting in the background to someone about what's happening, this person also starts yelling and throwing insults*\n\n\n\nNope. Now you've messed up.\n\n\n\nT: *upset* Please, sir, I- \n\n\n\nI held my hand up to stop them and immediately flipped the switch that set my headset to the one that the caller could hear.\n\n\n\nMe: Sir, my name is sh605 and I was one of the people you spoke to this morning. Do you remember me?\n\n\n\nC: Oh thank god, the person before you-\n\n\n\nMe: I'm going to stop you right there, as I have been listening to the call since it started. Do you recall when I told you this morning my coworker was replacing this billing in your system, and to wait 10 minutes?\n\n\nC: Yeah but-\n\n\n\nMe: Do you remember me telling you to then write the number listed below the billing and to write it on the receipt and fax it to us? \n\n\nC: *starting to fuss*\n\n\n\nMe: Do. You. Remember.\n\n\n\nC: Well, yeah... But I called someone else later and they said they would take care of it for me.\n\n\n\nMe: That person sits directly beside me, sir, and that is not what they told you. They told you exactly what I told you this morning and what my trainee told you at the beginning of the call. It is notated twice in your account and I heard the conversation. When they said they would take care of it, they were directly referring to putting this back on the site for you to get all the info you would need, and after they said that they again asked you to fax the receipt with this information.\n\n\n\nC: But-\n\n\n\nMe: Now that you have failed to follow the instructions you were given twice, we are still going to help you but you have tied our hands a bit. As I warned you this morning, that information would not be retained after it was cancelled and it was VERY important that you write it down after we put it back for you because you would not be able to retrieve it later. Do you remember this?\n\n\n\nC: I know but I made a mistake!\n\n\n\nMe: That's alright, sir, we can still fix it. I will send you to a department who will reach out to the customer for you, and you are welcome to reach out to this person as well. As soon as you have it, you just send it and we will pay you what you are owed. There is nothing else that my department can do to help now, but if you have any other billing questions you can always call back for help.\n\n\n\nC: Ok, go ahead and transfer me.\n\n\n\nMe: Absolutely. *transfer* \n\n\nI asked my coworker if they were good, took notes, switched it back over and had them take the next call. Thankfully everything after that was simple!",

        "text": "Probably my first call today, and my supervisors/team leads keep dropping the ball with escalations the past couple weeks so this call on top of that had me *really* heated. I don't post in here very often, but I take customer service calls for an insurance company. My job encompasses a lot of tasks but most of it involves providing benefits and reviewing claims.\n\nI'll be SHN, caller will be UAM for Unhelpful, Annoying Man.\n\n&gt;**SHN:** [greeting, get caller's name and phone number]\n\n&gt;**UAM:** \"Hello, Short-Haired Nymph, I think I was overcharged at my doctor's appointment, but I want to make sure with you guys first, and I need to know if I'm gonna have to pay that again at my next appointment.\"\n\n&gt;**SHN:** \"Oh gosh, I apologize for that unfortunate experience, but I'd be more than happy to help you look at the claims and compare it to your benefit information. To get started, could you please confirm for me your date of birth and current address?\"\n\n&gt;**UAM:** [tone sounds slightly skeptical] \"What do you have on file?\"\n\n&gt;**SHN:** [blinks] \"I... I don't know what we have on file, I don't have your information up.\"\n\n&gt;**UAM:** [unimpressed] \"You have zero information on my policy?\" \n\n&gt;**SHN:** \"My apologies; what I mean is that I need this information from you in order to pull up your account.\"\n\n&gt;**UAM:** \"I give you guys this information *every. single. time* I call, and I can NEVER. Get any information from you.\"\n\n&gt;**SHN:** \"I apologize sir, I'm not sure what the issues have been previously but once I have your account up I can review previous notes and see what the problem was, but in order to do that I need your information.\"\n\n&gt;**UAM:** [sighs, but calms down] \"Okay. Fine. What do you need from me?\"\n\nSo he gives me his info, I'm able to pull up his policy, and he says he's been calling us for three days without any help. Our notes only show one call in the past week, but the insurance company shares its name with a large chain of providers, so people often get us mixed up thinking that whatever they talk about with the hospital will be documented with the insurance and vice versa. Whatever, this is pretty common.\n\n&gt;**SHN:** \"Thank you for that information sir. Okay, so I see the claim here from last week, with [provider name], you said, right? Yes, I have that here now, let me take a look at the charges here.\"\n\n&gt;**UAM:** \"Yeah, that one, I paid my copay, that one's fine, unless you see something I don't. But my follow-up was this Monday and I had to pay *again*.\"\n\n&gt;**SHN, internally:** *I mean... that's... that's how it works, pal. Ya gotta pay the office visit copay every time you have an office visit. That's. That's literally how it works.*\n\n&gt;**SHN:** \"I see, okay. So, we don't actually have a claim on file yet for Monday--\" [because it's only Wednesday, dude]\n\n&gt;**UAM, cutting me off:** \"No no no, this was not a *claim*, this was a COPAY. *Are you understanding me?*\"\n\n...Dude, are you fucking serious?\n\n&gt;**SHN:** \"...Yes, sir, I understand you paid a copay on Monday. What I mean is that the provider has not sent us the information on services that were rendered, so I have nothing that I can review. However--\"\n\n&gt;**UAM:** \"Hmph. See? Useless.\" [Disconnects]\n\nPer our policy, I have to call back in the event of a disconnect before I give my pre-close and close if I have the phone number. So I called back, and if he would have answered I would have told him that that copay still applied because it was still an office visit but that if he didn't actually see his provider and if he was never actually in the office that there were steps to take to correct this, but he never answered. \n\nWhat the hell is with these people? Help me help *you*, my guy.\n\nEdit: formatting",

Now I would take anywhere between 50-70ish calls a day and would get some odd questions like what is the difference between Shut down and restart or hey I would like to pay my bill or just an upset customer who wanted to yell at someone to make them feel better(90% of the calls....). So the day started out pretty rough, back to back angry callers yelling about random crap we had no control over and how we are worthless people for not fixing the issue etc. I was about 2 hours into my shift when I got a call that made my foul mood disappear instantly and made the rest of the day better. \n\nMe# yeah you get the idea\nFC# forgetful caller\n\nMe# Thank you for calling (helpdesk) how may I assist you?\n\nFC#: oh #$%#, I need a shot of cognac and woman to rub my back.\n\nMe# I'm sorry sir, we do not offer those services here, is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nFC# what?

I tried to help this person with a tablet that he felt he was being overcharged for, but it was too late to return it. I offered him the buy out option on his contract, but he was not having it. He wanted to get the tablet for free, and I tried to ask my coach what to do, but she told me to tell them that they had to go back to the store if they wanted help. \n\nI don't know. I just felt so uncomfortable and lost confidence after my first day, and I'm hoping this is a normal feeling and that it's not that I'm bad at my job.",

I overhead the call and was both laughing in amusement/wincing in sympathy throughout its duration.\n\nMe= hapless coworker\n\nDM= Dense man\n\nWS= well-meaning supervisor\n\nI work for a small ISP that has over the years acquired other small ISPs in the area. This call was from one of our customers that we had acquired in such a manner.\n\nIt starts off innocently enough with him asking for our 'internet password’.\n\n*Haha, silly users, obviously you mean wifi password, maybe there's another device I can get the password from.*\n\nI start trying to help him find the WIFI password on one of his devices, but he stops me.\n\n**DM**: \"No, I'm not looking for the wifi password. I need your internet, which you now call Zimbra I guess, password to log into my bank.\"\n\n*Wait, what. We do have a Zimbra program for email for our customers, but what does that have to do with his bank?*\n\n**Me**: \"Are you trying to log into your email to receive an email regarding your bank login?\"\n\n**DM**: \"No, I'm at my bank's website and need the password for your internet to log in.\"\n\n*Oh, easy, I just need to get him to his bank*\n\nBut first to make sure that it is what I think it is, I verify he's at his bank's website and bring it up myself to see what he's seeing. Sure enough he's describing it perfectly, just getting a wrong username/password error when trying to log in.\n\n**Me**: \"It looks like you're trying to use the wrong username or password for your bank, can I transfer you to them to help you with the issue?\"\n\n**DM**: \"No no no, I was able to log in when I was on the bank's internet. I just need the password for YOUR internet.\"\n\n*What.*\n\nA few more back and forths with the customer like this, with me trying to explain his bank password hasn't changed. I've been on the phone with him for about half an hour when my supervisor decides to be helpful and starts sending me messages.\n\n**WS**: \"Is he able to get online?\"\n\n**WS**: \"Maybe he's just doing a search, make sure he's clicking on the link!\"\n\n**WS**: \"Have you tried transferring him to the bank?\"\n\nWell-intentioned, but we've gone beyond reason and logic here. \n\nAt this point my will to live has started tanking and I'm just letting everyone rant at me. There is nothing I can do. Or is there?\n\nI get a last ditch idea and start attempting to explain that my company doesn't have a separate internet, just that we provide the connection to get to places on the internet itself.\n\n**Me**: \"We're like the highway, the bank is a place you've driven to and you're just locked out. You've called the highway repair people because you're locked out of the bank. You need to talk to your bank since you're locked out of their building.\"\n\n**DM**: \"Well it sounds like your highway and the banks highway aren't merging properly.\"\n\nI.... don't know what to say, or what to do. My brain has melted, my soul has died.  I just keep reiterating that we can't help, as there’s not anything else I can think to say at that point.\n\n**Me**: \"Sir, we cannot help you. The only people in the world who can help you with this is your bank. Let me transfer you to them.\"\n\n**DM**: \"No, that's okay. I'm down there all the time and it works when I'm on their internet.\"\n\nIf there was a kind God, he'd let me die. Another torturous half hour or so later, he finally gives up on getting the password for our internet.\n\nI wish him a nice evening.\n\n**DM**: \"You shouldn't wish people a nice day when you don't even help them.\"\n\nYeah, sure, guy. Whatever.\n\n\nEdit- Fixed some formatting/name confusion.\nEdit 2- Added a clarifying sentence. ",

        "text": "I've had a good run lately, but as we all know it hits the wall eventually.  I work for a student loan billing agent, and I am not a designated call representative, but due to an extreme and prolonged staffing deficiency they have tasked most of the non-technical and non-managerial staff to fielding incoming calls.  The call comes in to our US based help desk line, for which my bosses have assigned me solely because my qualification is that I live in America.  I have zero experience with dealing with escalated calls, and in fact my skin is so thin that I'm the last person in the company who should be fielding them.  I do however have an empathetic and clear sounding voice that is apparently well suited to phone work and has worked well in the past.\n\nSo, Douche Bag Dick Head lands on my line because of the chip on his shoulder about getting one of our Filipino staff first off, who bless their hearts try their best despite the wretched training that they are provided by our employer.  DBDH likes to pay his bill on the last business day of the month in which his payment is due, in the afternoon of that day.  Our file cutoff is 11am, and any payments after that are processed on the next business day.  So, he is in essence gaming our system by calling in the loan payment 30 days late each month, as statements are due on the 1st and he makes it at the end of the month before our credit bureau export file is generated, and expects this to work out.\n\nHe hits my line immediately hot and bothered that he was reported late at the end of January despite calling in the payment on the 29th.  He proceeds to rapid-fire throw profanity laced statements and questions (interchangeably) about how our company is lame, he is fed up with dealing with off shore reps, what does he really owe, why was he late when he made the payment in the month it was due, he's going to file a lawsuit because we are destroying his credit, none of this is his fault, blah, blah, blah.  And **he's in a hurry because he's at work.**\n\nDBHU: How much do I need to pay for January? \nMe: $xx.xx\nDBHU: I was just told I was past due, that is impossible because I paid last month.\nMe: True, but you made the payment after the processing cutoff, and due to it being a Friday and a holiday weekend the payment file wasn't processed and applied until the first business day in January.\nDBHU: Rants again about the topics listed above, and concludes that it isn't his fracking problem that our stupid company isn't open on the weekend to process payments. \n\nI say nothing because I'm looking more deeply into this to see what I can do.\n\nDBHU:  Since you didn't answer me the first time, and I'm in a hurry, what do I need to pay?\nMe: You need to make a payment of $xx.xx for this month and if you want to make account current through 2/1/18 as this is due tomorrow, it will be an additional $xx.xx.\nDBHU: I didn't ask for that.  What do I need to pay for JANUARY for the 3rd time.\nMe: Once again, the amount is $xx.xx, but....\nDBHU: So I need to pay $xx.xx?\nMe: Yes, but the payment cutoff-\nDBHU: I am not interested in that!  I just want to make a payment and for you to fix my credit reporting!  But since you won't answer my question for the 4th time, what do I owe for JANUARY!\n\nMy patience is wearing extremely thin, and it takes all my self control to not ream him out for sheer idiocy.  So I do the best thing and just keep my mouth shut.\n\nDBHU: Hello?  Hello!\nMe: Are you finished so that I can answer you questions?\nDBHU: I am listening but you are NOT ANSWERING MY GODDAMN QUESTIONS!  For the 5th time, WHAT DO I OWE FOR JANUARY?\nMe: For the 5th time, $xx.xx, but since you are not listening to what I'm saying, I think I need to get a supervisor for you.  Please hold.\n\nSo I go track down my lead, who unfortunately for her, was still available to take this lunatic because she hadn't punched out for lunch yet.  I give her the story, give plenty of warning, and go back to let him know that I'm forwarding him over.\n\nDBHU: How dare you put me on hold like that!\nMe: Well sir, I did not appreciate you swearing at me and you aren't listening to me, so that than continue to waste both of our time, I felt it necessary to find assistance for you.\nDBHU: Well it's your fault that you sounded incompetent with your muttering and stuttering!\nMe: OK sir....good bye.\n\nHe then proceeded to pull the exact same spiel with my lead, who is the most even keeled person around, and in fact ended up reducing her to tears after she had to disconnect him because he just would not settle down and listen to reason and just accused her of reading from a script.  (helpful hint: just because you keep hearing the same explanation, it doesn't mean a script is being read)\n\nThe idiotic thing is, if he were half way decent, I could have offered to check on correcting the credit and advised how to avoid this from happening again, and given that he did make it before it could be corrected manually.  But now?  F him.  Someone above me can deal with it.\n\nWhen will the public ever ever get that you are more apt to get a positive result if you act nicely and politely?\n",

This lady calling to report a claim was not only the most ridiculously hilarious call, but also the most confusing. I'll be $me and she will be $lady and the claims agent will be, well, $claims\n\n\n$me: Thanks for calling (company) This is Noddy.. *blah blah standard verification*\n\n$lady: Yeah, I need to report a claim, but I'm not sure if it needs to be homeowners or auto\n\n$me: Okay, I'll be more than happy to get you to the right area. What happened? (I'm only policy services, I don't handle claims) \n\n$lady: Well, I fell off my roof, onto my car and broke the windshield, sunroof, and the side mirrors off. Do I have coverage for this and what would be my deductible?\n\n$me: Uh *extended pause* Were you injured?\n\n$lady: No, just my car. \n\n$me: I'll be honest with you, I have absolutley no idea what policy this would be claimed under. Let's figure this out. *internally imagining the circumstances to decide if it would be HO or AO, I immediately start giggling and didn't mute myself in time* I'm sorry, that's just one of the most interesting scenarios possible and I couldn't stop picturing the scene from Christmas Vacation.\n\n$lady: *also laughing* I know, it was more along the lines of The Santa Clause, though.\n\n$me: *recovering from laughter* So, since you weren't injured, I'm thinking this will be an auto claim. Let me place you on hold just to make sure. (We usually cold transfer to auto claims, but I did a warm transfer just to make sure)\n\n$claims: Auto claims, how can I assist you?\n\n$me: Yeah, this is Noddy from policy services, I have a member on the line with a doozy of a claim and I want to make sure I get her to the right area.\n\n$claims: Okay, so what happened?\n\n$me: Well, she fell off her roof, onto her car and broke the windshield, sunroof, and side mirror.\n\n$claims: Wait, what?\n\n$me: Yeah, I figured it would fall under auto, but I wanted to make sure. I couldn't decide if it would be a comp or collision claim. I was thinking comp, because technically humans are animals.\n\n$claims: *laughing* That's an interesting way to put it; I'm pretty sure this is auto, but let me check with my supervisor because that's not something we encounter everyday. Was it like that christmas movie with Tim Allen?\n\n$me: According to her, it was exactly like that. I'll hold.\n\n$claims: Okay, so yeah we would take that as a comp claim, we don't actually have a designation for it in our system but we'll figure it out. Send her over.\n\n\n*introduces call and disconnects*\n\nI had an oh shit moment when I started laughing, and after my explanation I thought I super fucked up, but the fact that the lady came back with that response literally made my entire day.\n\n\n",

We pride ourselves on being empathetic and generally have good values to the company and the customers. It's a good place to work barring the occasional shithead customer. \n\nI work with this one very kind and lovely little lady. She is Chinese but speaks fluent English as her 2nd Language. We are front line tech support for when shit breaks essentially. None of our call centers are outsourced and we are very culturally diverse. My biggest pet peeve is hearing some of my co-workers being told \"I want to speak to someone who speaks english\" - I'm Australian and i've even had someone say it to me before. It's just ignorant. \n\nAnyway we are now 3-4 weeks out of training and on our own for calls. Que MEGA ASSHOLE DICKFACE (MAD) customer - calls in over something trivial (sorry it's been a while so i'm sure it was something like Wifi not working or a billing issue) and my co-worker tries her best to help but he is not having it, calling her every name under the sun and demanding to speak to a \"White- English speaking person\"  - Her accent is minimal at best and her English is probably better then mine and it's my first language. The call eventually escalates to our 2nd tier support who sometimes take on supervisor calls. MAD proceeds to be a dickhead and the call eventually gets resolved. Tier 2 support agent see's my friend is visible upset and shaken by the call so decides to listen back on the recording. \n\nThis is where it get's awesome, T2 support then informs our direct supervisor of call, who proceeds to listen and is appalled. Direct Supervisor then calls back MAD - informs him that we won't tolerate people speaking to our employee's like that and cancelled his account with the company and tells him we don't want his business. \n\n\nMoral of the story - we are all just people, don't be dicks to the people trying to fix your shit or you might end up with no shit to fix at all. \n\n",

One of my favorite things was catching fraud on documents that are required to send in (dL, ssc, bank statements and pay stubs) there are some subtle cases where it’s hard to find and some were super blatant and easy to catch. \n\nI had a customer call in about his documents and something looked fishy so I went through some of the documents on file for him. It was obviously fraud that someone didn’t catch. I called my TL and had her look at them. She confirmed with me that it was fraud. But because the “customer” had about 22 successful and paid off loans, she told me to let it slide.\n\nThere has to be something wrong with that. IMO all fraud if we catch it should be at least denied if it’s caught. I think it’s shady to let it slide. I understand though because they’re getting paid. Doesn’t make it right though ",

We paid bills for people, helped with groceries and mortgage payments etc. We gave away hundreds of thousands to help the community and other missions. \n\nOne day I got a call from someone who said her gas bill was $500 and she couldn’t pay it. (This wasn’t uncommon for an old house in winter to have a bill that high.) \n\nThe convo goes as follows and I’ll be me and she will be GBL for gas bill lady. \n\nMe: thank you for calling such and such church how may I help you?\n\nGBL: hi I’m hoping you can help. I have a gas bill of over $500 and I can’t pay it. Would you be able to help me? \n\nMe: I’m sorry to hear that I understand how that is. Unfortunately the woman who handles all of this is away at lunch but she’ll be back in about an hour or so. You can either call back then or just come into the church. We would like to do our best to help you. All you will need is the bill and your drivers license. \n\nGBL: why do I need that? \n\nMe: well, we need the bill in order to pay the gas company and also we need to verify this is you and your address. \n\nGBL: don’t you trust me? \n\nMe: it’s not about trust it’s just our protocol. We do this in order to ensure everyone who needs help gets it and to be fair. \n\nGBL: I don’t understand why you can’t just cut me a check. That doesn’t seem fair. \n\nMe: I’m sorry but we won’t do that. We will pay the bill but we don’t write personal checks or give out cash. \n\nGBL: you don’t even know me! How can you not trust me? I’ve never done anything to you! \n\nMe: you’re right, I don’t know you but this isn’t about trust it’s about being fair and being sure those who truly need help get it... \n\nGBL: you know you are all a bunch of f-ing a-holes. You don’t help people you just hoard the money for yourself! \n\nMe: I’m sorry but if you’re going to cuss at me I’m going to hang up. \n\nSlam!! She hangs up on me. \n\nOh well! 😬\n\nLater, I asked the woman who takes care of that stuff if they ever called back and she said she didn’t. She was probably just looking for drug money. It was sad how many of them were. \n\n",

        "text": "So I used to work in a contact centre for a company that allows people to rent out their homes. It's a tiny company, I'm sure you haven't heard of it. \n\nI get an email from a woman who is claiming that the house she is staying in isn't up to scratch, and that she has overpaid. I ask for photos of the issues, and there were none. However, she said she had been speaking to the owner on the phone, and he had told her that he would give her a 50% if she left him a 5* review. \n\nNow, we have very strict guidelines on reviews, and we almost never remove them, unless it violates these very specific guidelines, one if which is extortion. So I explained to the guest that we do not allow extortion, and if the owner decides not to pay her after she leaves the review, then we cant force him to. \n\nNow, bare in mind all of the communication I have with the guest is via email, as I was never able to reach her on the phone, so everything is in writing. This guest is also a host on the site, and has hundreds of good reviews and is one of our (let's call them) \"GreatHosts\", so she should know the rules and play by them, as she could be removed from the site if she doesn't. \n\nA few days later I haven't heard back, and I can see that there still haven't been any reviews left  so I send a closing email. I then get a response from the guest, in which she explains her \"genius\" plan. She was going to turn the tables on the owner, and demand the full 50% refund, or else she would leave a negative review. Up to this point, I had been really sympathetic to her, coz the owner was clearly up to tricks, but it wasnt in writing so we couldn't do anything. But this guest put IN WRITING TO THE COMPANY that she was going to deliberately viotate the TOS which I had highlighted, and she believed that she was doing the right thing. \n\nI don't have the power to remove a user from the site, and I still kind of wanted to give her a chance, so I sent her one final email to urge her not to break the TOS and I solved the case quickly hoping she wouldn't reply. But of course she did, this time explaining how I had upset her and made her cry with my threat of removing her from the site. I just reassured her I was trying to protect her business, and closed the case again. \n\nI followed up a few days later out of curiosity, and she had been suspended from the site. \n\nI've spoken about this to my colleagues, and apparently it happens all the time, which baffles me.

The call started fine, but she became increasingly belligerent and rude the more confused she became about her situation.\n\nI became impatient but remained calm in explaining to her why she was in her current situation (surprise surprise, she created it herself). She started becoming upset about an issue regarding payment to us, which is not the department I work in.  I told her I could only give her \"rudimentary\" information about payment, but would have to transfer her so she could get better information.\n\nAt this point she was being *that* caller. She would ask a question and before I could get a second sentence into my answer she would interrupt me. I believe that is the explanation for the end of the call.\n\nShe finally agrees to let me transfer her, and this interaction ensues:\n\n**Her:** Before you'd transfer me I'd like you to apologize for calling me rude\n\n**Me:** I did not call you rude ma'am.\n\n**Her:** I think you did.\n\n**Me:** Ok well I am not going to apologize for \"calling you rude\" because that is something I did not do.\n\nShe hung up.",

She insists it is the only number she would use.\n\nShe's almost in tears, so I try that number in our legal report system to see if it pulls up any recorded conversation.\n\nIt does. Good.\n\nI find that she bought a Samsung refrigerator back in 2014 (It's 2018 currently). \n\nShe is reporting that it is not cooling any longer. The day this happened she called my team's repair line.\nNow, her extended warranty sold by our store had already expired in 2016.\n\nHowever, the person she spoke to there must have had pity on her because they sent a tech out.\n\nTech reports it is the compressor and it's a pinched line. There is no fixing this.\n\nSo, now she wants my store to replace a four year old refrigerator. \n\nNot going to happen with an expired warranty plan. BUT…. A compressor on a refrigerator is under factory warranty for ten years!\n\nThe client can call Samsung, or we can give her half the value of her current refrigerator as credit to buy a new refrigerator. \n\nI inform her of this.\n\n---Time goes by. I think all is well. I…was…wrong… ---\n\nShe sends me an email saying that a Samsung tech came out and discovered that one of our techs had already opened the sealed system up.\n\nAs a result this violated the compressor warranty.\n\nThe tech packed up his stuff and left.\n\nHer email is SCREAMING AT ME. (for some unknown reason). \n\nI do what we call a kitchen sink email. Anyone that may help is put on this email and I wait to see what comes back.\n\nI get a field manager that actually called Samsung and told them what B.S. they were telling the client. \nThis field manager actually calls the client and tells her to call Samsung back and ask for an RA code. (RA = Return Authorization)\n\nShe does this. \n\nSamsung gives her an RA code.\n\nShe then emails me for what happens next.\n\nI reply: One of two things will happen. 1. Samsung will contact our company and we will replace the refrigerator. Or 2. Samsung will send you a card with a fund and your RA code on it and you can use that card at our company to buy a new refrigerator.\n\nShe replies back a couple of days later, in GIANT LETTERS, some of which she has actually colored red: They say that it is going to take 14 days to send me that card. Had I known it was take so long I would have accepted your store credit so I would already have a refrigerator. This is ridiculous! (Ridiculous is in bold red letters and font size 56).  I want that store credit, I am not waiting on that card!\n\nWell, that's a problem… LOL…\n\nI replied: Well mam, Samsung is the only company that can help you now. My company should not have ever even sent that tech out. However, we did assist you greatly be getting Samsung to give you that RA code. I can no longer offer you the store credit because Samsung has already generated that fund card. Sorry.\n\nShe replies back with some of the most vile things I've ever had to read in an email. Apparently MY company is the reason her compressor went out and as a result we are the world's worse. \n\n--No good deed goes unpunished!--",

I respond to the store with what is going on. \nI called the client again. Told him, \"Sir, the store sent me an email with the same information you've been calling about. Again, your actually slowing the process down with all this added information that is not new information.\"\nThings get quiet...\nToo quiet, if such a thing exists for call centers....\nMy email pings.\nIt's the store again.

If you've lost my number I would happy to give it you again. However, nothing has changed. No one can change this. It is 100% our fault, but you will need to be rescheduled for (date).\"\nHe replies, \"Well, you leave me no choice, so I will just sit around and wait for you.\"\nI replied, \"I understand, and please only call me in the future. Everything in regards to your case will land on my desk. Calling anyone else only causes confusion and will result in more mistakes.\"\n(I hope he listened that time). ",

        "text": "First of all I had no goddamn idea that a sub like this exists. I mean, I thought that most of the companies outsourced this line of business to India(where I live) and other countries so the Call Center/BPO Industry is not so prevalent in America. Anyway, I worked in this industry for close to 4 months before I among a lot of other people were laid off because the process I worked in was ramped down.       \n\nI worked for a major US Network Provider and it was a B2B process so we were assured that the people you'll be talking to are as professional as you are. We got calls from Direct Sales Stores of the company as well as Indirect Channels and other retail giants like BestBuy, Walmart, Target, Sam's Club etc. I found the above statement of the person being polite true everytime except for this one instance.     \nAlso I really feel guilty after going through this sub for the past 2 hours and seeing that people in this industry are really ethical as well as committed to professionalism.      \n\nM- Me.    \nSR- Sales Representative\n\nSo this SR called from a Direct Store. Since there was a Chat department specifically to cater the needs of the Direct Stores so we had a lot of restrictions. I never liked taking calls from Direct Stores because 95% of the time I had to end it by saying, \" I'm sorry but I'm not authorized to do this, you're gonna have to contact our chat team to get this done\".      \nI am a person who does not likes to say no especially if it's something that I can do.        \nAnyway, I get a call from a Direct Store and this is basically what happened.        \n\n***\n\nM - Opening+Verification Bit.   \n\nSR - Verifies herself.   \n \nM - How can I be of help ?      \n\nSR- Okay, so the customer migrated from Prepaid to Postpaid but she's not getting any service, can you look into that ?      \n \nM- Yes! Just give me a couple of minutes and I'll look into it.         \n\nIt turns out that the migration never went through and it had to be done again. It was not a big deal but again I had to say no to her because we were not authorized to make any changes on the account because it was a direct store and they had to contact chat for that.     \n\nM- Thank you for being on the line, I checked what's wrong and it turns out that the Migration never went through, you're gonna have to contact the chat team and they'll help you with that.      \n\nSR- Okay, but aren't you working for XYZ as well ? Why can't you do it ?     \n    \nM- Ma'am it's a company policy and I'm just not authorized to do that. I hope you understand that it's not in my power to make this change.      \n\nSR- From where do I get this damn chat ?      \n \nM- I believe your supervisor will help you with that. \n      \nSR- I'm the store manager, I've been with XYZ from the past 14 years. \n\nM- That's wonderful, so I believe you know where to look right ?     \n\nSR- Ugh, we'll work something out. Thanks for your help.\n\n***\nDay 2\n\nI get a call from this woman again. Apparently she could not contact the chat team so she thought calling would solve her problem. \n\nThen it's pretty much the same. I don't think she recognized me but I sure did. I also checked the interaction history of the customers account only to find out that she called multiple times the day before as well as on Day 2. Although she frequented a lot between Customer Care and National Sales Support (Our division). I again had to tell her reluctantly to contact Chat. It took a lot of might to do that because I don't like saying no. \n\n***\n\nDay 3      \n\nI get a call from her again!!!      \nAt this point I just give up and I don't know what to say to her. She remembered me as well to make matters worse. Following is what happened after I gave her the Contact chat for the third goddamn time.        \n\nSR- Oh my God! What the fuck is wrong with you ? Don't you guys know how to do your job ? I've been calling you from the past 3 days and you wouldn't just help me!! I haven't dealt with assholes like you in my whole goddamn life. The customer has to come here everyday for hours just to get this stupid fucking thing resolved. He has been with XYZ since 2003 and that's how you treat him ? I spent 3 hours today and everyone just hangs up on me and tired of calling you guys and I'm the damn store manager. I want this fixed or there will be hell to pay.     \n\nAt this point I believe her. I believe that she's been on the phone for the past 3 hours because some scumbag must have kept her on hold. People did a LOT of shit because the process was going which meant that the calls were not being audited guys just hanging up if things were escalating, people not even responding on calls, not being professional on calls etc. The Supervisors were already asked to leave so they didn't give two shits about anything. I was on the receiving end of that barrage and instead of being infuriated I kinda found it funny because it was the first time that it was happening to me. I couldn't help but chuckle a little. I also understood the frustration of this woman and decided to take matters into my own hand.    \n\nM- Excuse me ma'am but this is no way of talking to me. Do you really think I'm gonna help you if you talk to me like this ? **Chuckles**\n\nSR- Did you just laugh at me you son of a bitch ? \n\nM- Yes, I'm sorry for that. It's just that this is no way of talking to a person who is trying to help you. Just so you know I do not make the rules here, I have to follow them in order to keep my job. There's no need to be personal.       \n\nSR- I apologize for being unprofessional as well but you've to understand that this is really frustrating. I've to take care of a lot of things and I do not have time for this. Is there nothing that you can do to make this work ? Because the customer has told that he'll terminate his contract with the company if this is not solved quickly and we don't want to lose him.      \n\nI decide to do that Migration anyway because no one was gonna check, there sure was not going to be any escalation from the client's side as well. What's the worse that could happen ? I would hey fired right? I knew that it was gonna happen anyway regardless I help her or not( Many people were laid off before me so I knew that it was inevitable).\n\nM- Alright, I'll do what you've asked me to do. Please be on hold.    \n\n   \nI completed the process and tell her. She apologizes to me again and thanks me again.    \n\n***\n\nAfter this I decided to do everything for a SR whether it was allowed or not given they had all the correct information and the required details. I just felt I should've started to make more small talks because I'm kinda socially awkward and it would have been somewhat of a practice. There were instances where people tried to talk about something additional but I just kind zoned out and tried my best to keep up but it wasn't really working. Maybe I would have gotten better if I stayed there for a longer period of time, who knows ? \n\n\nAfter 2 months I was given the talk that I've to part ways with the company because there was no other process where they could move me.    \n\nI was very happy because I hated it there. Sure now I'm unemployed but I'm pursuing something much better academically that'll make sure that I don't have to be a part of this industry anymore. ",

        "text": "So I had this call around the end of my day today, and I knew immediately he was going to be a problem. It's long and weird, so bear with me....\n\n\nSo no one's confused, I work at a 3rd party billing company. It's not like most call centers, it's small and while I can't be flat out rude, I can get a little sassy! I am not your buddy, I am here to tell you what you can and cannot do re: billing our company. Of course, the day is better when everyone is nice, so I do make an effort to be pleasant. However calling in and acting like this guy will not get you far in my department.\n\n\nMe: (Company), this is sh605. How can I help you?\n\n\nGrumpy Guy (GG): I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR TEN MINUTES. \n\n\nWe both sat there in silence for a moment. I waited for him to continue, and he waited for me to acknowledge this travesty... Once I realized what he wanted I spoke again.\n\n\nMe: Yeah, we have a lot of calls coming in right now. What can I do for you today?\n\n\nGG: I am calling from account 12345, I need someone to fax me a copy of our mutual client's membership card, or I need their personal phone number to reach them.\n\n\nThis is a MAJOR no-no.\n\n\nMe: I'm sorry sir. Those cards are tied to banking information. That's like if someone asked me to fax them a copy of your credit card. I also cannot give out personal information on anyone. If you are needing this to bill for someone, if you can tell me the name of the company they work for I can get you to their rep so you can discuss other options to get paid for this. \n\n\nGG: NO. \n\n\nME: No?\n\n\nGG: That's NOT going to help me. You people make this process as difficult as possible just to try and scam an honest person! You have all the information and it's on YOU to make sure I am paid!\n\n\nMe: It is on your business to collect this information when the client uses your services, per your contract with us. It is not our fault you neglected to get this card number or even an active phone number, and it is not our responsibility to make sure you are paid. It is your responsibility to read your contract, understand our billing policies, and make sure these policies are followed so that we can pay you what you are owed.\n\n\nGG: You're not being very helpful!!!\n\n\nMe: I'm being as helpful as I can with the information you are providing me.\n\n\nGG: WHAT IS YOUR ID NUMBER?!\n\n\nMe: Our employees don't have ID numbers.\n\n\nGG: I WANT YOUR SUPERVISOR!\n\n\nMe: They're away from their desk, I can direct you to their voicemail.\n\n\nGG: NO!\n\n\nMe: Then what else can I help you with, sir?\n\n\nGG: Can you pull up the fax I sent you last night?!\n\n\nMe: What's your account number?\n\n\nGG: UGH. AGAIN???\n\n\nMe: Sorry, yeah.\n\n\nGG: ONE! TWO! THREE! FOUR! FIVE!\n\n\nMe: Ok. I have a fax here from last night.\n\n\nGG: And does it not have his name?! And my account number?!\n\n\nMe: Yes. That's not enough, though. You can give me any name and I can pull up 5-6 active clients, we need this number to identify them. You don't even have an address for them, you just put ours down. This is just a name, an amount, and your letterhead saying he owes. Do you know what company he works for?\n\n\nGG: NO! ALL THEY TELL US IS TO BILL YOU! SO WE PUT YOUR INFORMATION!\n\n\nMe: You should still be collecting their information for situations like the one we're in now.\n\n\nGG: Is this a recorded line???\n\n\nMe: Yes.\n\n\nGG: All I have is this ID number!!!\n\n\nMe: Can you give it to me?\n\n\nGG: XXXXXXX.\n\n\nSuccess! Something I can use!\n\n\nMe: Alright! That's something! This at least gives us some info we can use to bill. If you re-fax your invoice with this number, we can pay you.\n\n\nGG: Well, I just GAVE you the number, and you have the fax.\n\n\nMe: Yes sir, but I do not work in the department responsible for entering this information. I can do nothing with this information. Basically, at this point you have two options. You can wait to see if they will accept this fax, which I do not recommend, or you can re-fax your invoice with this number.\n\n\nGG: I need your supervisor, because you are COMPLETELY INCOMPETENT AND INEFFICIENT!! How do I identify you to your boss!\n\n\nMe: Again, they are not here right now, I will transfer you to their voicemail. All you have to do is give my name, I am the only sh605 here. \n\n\nGG: NO! NOT GOOD ENOUGH! I NEED YOUR SUPERVISOR'S SUPERVISOR! I NEED SOMEONE ABOVE YOU RIGHT NOW!!\n\n\nMe: That person cannot be called directly. I can give them your information and they will call you tomorrow. \n\n\nGG: NO!! I WILL NOT BE IGNORED!!\n\n\nMe: No one is ignoring you. My supervisor will be back soon please allow me to transfer you to them so your complaints can be heard as soon as possible.\n\n\nGG: IF I GET TO A VOICEMAIL BOX, YOU HAD BETTER PICK BACK UP! I WILL NOT BE DUMPED INTO VOICEMAIL!\n\n\nMe: You want me to pick up my supervisor's phone and sit at her desk and continue this conversation?\n\n\nGG: *incoherent screeching*\n\n\nMe: *Transfer to voicemail*\n\n\nWhat a twat.\n\n\nUpdate: I asked my supervisor if they called him back, and they said hell no, his voicemails was just incoherent screaming.\n\n\nThey said the only thing that they understood was: I TOLD HER NOT TO PUT ME INTO VOICEMAIL!!!!",

        "text": "I got hired recently at a call center near our place. I'm just gonna say that I'm not from America but I am bilingual. I'm not gonna go into the specifics of my job since I'm still new.\n\nAnyway, I got hired last December and passed the assessments. I'm done with nesting but it seems that I didn't pass it. A lot of my wavemates failed as well. We were told we're going to be on extended nesting. When I asked the trainer about failing the nesting stage, I was discouraged. When we fail, the company will terminate us and we're considered as non hireables. I thought to myself that seems harsh. I mean, don't you want to hire people who want to work for you again despite failing the first time? We passed the assessments and we already know the processes. So why not hire people who want to try again?\n\nThis is only my second job and communication's always been my weakness. Despite knowing that I'm probably going to fail, I still tried anyway because I wanted the job and wanted to prove to myself that I could do it. Some people say that you could always apply to other call centers but in reality, the proximity of those centers to our place is too far to be bothered. And I also want to be close to my parents since they are old.\n\nA lot of my wavemates were saddened by this. We didn't expect to fail and we've done a month's work. We were pretty confident that we're going to be endorsed since the company invested so much to hire us. I liked my wavemates and the trainers. Although, I don't really like the hours nor the irate people we have to deal with in a constant basis.\n\nSo, I say why? Is this the norm for call centers? Can anybody give me some advice. I'm not fishing for pity or anything. Just need some solid advice. Appreciate your responses!",

I work for a utility company for a major US city and we have MANY students who never applied for service in September and are just now getting shut off. Just for clarification, they've been living with FREE electric for over 6 months. TL;DR at the bottom, just wanted to get this one off my chest. \n\nI'll be me, douchey student will be DS. \n\nMe: standard greeting\n\nDS: You shut my power off and no one has been here to turn it back on. \n\nMe: (we have a restoration goal of end of the next business day, this kid had called in his turn on around 3pm, it was now 6.15pm and techs go home at 530) I'm sorry to hear that, but everyone is out of the field, it will be on by end of business tomorrow. \n\nDS: You people told me it would be on today. I need it on now. \n\nMe: I'm sorry someone gave you the wrong information, we don't guarantee same day service. It will be on tomorrow. \n\nDS: YOU SHUT ME OFF FOR NO REASON AND I NEED POWER. IM A COLLEGE STUDENT I CANT DO MY HOMEWORK, DO YOU WANT ME TO DROP OUT?!\n\nMe: It looks like you moved in September 1st and never called and haven't been paying for your service so we shut you off. We can't provide service without payment. \n\nDS: YOU PEOPLE JUST SHUT ME OFF FOR NO REASON WITH NO WARNING TURN IT ON. \n\nMe: (at this point, I'm shaking angry, because not only is he yelling at me, but his room mate is mocking me in the background and they're both laughing like cocky assholes) It looks like we sent you two letters to apply, one in September and one in December and you never called. \n\nDS: I NEVER GOT THE LETTERS. WHOS FAULT IS THAT. NOT MINE. \n\nMe: It's not our job to deliver your mail, that's up to the USPS. Sorry you didn't receive them. It'll be on tomorrow. \n\nDS: Tomorrow morning. I highly suggest you have it on by tomorrow morning. \n\nMe: (is that a threat, what) It'll be on tomorrow, I can't guarantee a time, sorry. \n\nDS: IF ITS NOT ON IN THE MORNING I AM GOING TO SUE YOU PEOPLE. YOU SHUT ME OFF FOR NO REASON. I REALLY FUCKING SUGGEST YOU HAVE IT ON IN THE MORNING. \n\nMe: I already told you, I can't guarantee a time, and we shut you off because you've been using our service for free for 7 months. If there's nothing else I can help you with I am going to disconnect this call. \n\nDS: YOU CAN TURN MY FUCKING SERVICE ON. \n\nMe: Have a great night. *click*\n\nTL;DR: asshole college student gets pissed that we shut him off for not paying for 7 months, accuses me of wanting him to drop out because one night of no power will apparently ruin his college career, then threatens to sue.

Not sure why no one is answering! But it would be great if someone there would actually help me with this. Call me at [name/number]”\n\nTo which the VM ends. And I’m sort of in shock, like, my first ticket of the day... my coworkers in the room listen to it in my insistence and they react with the same wide-eyed holy shit that I do. Take a deep breath, back to my cubicle, and call her back. What grown adult doesn’t have a pair of headphones?\n\n(Completely harried and frenetic) “Hello?!”\n\nMe: “Hi, I’m Ashley with [company], looking for [client].”\n\nClient: “Yeah, you called her number, so, who else did you think you could be talking to”\n\n*brief pause for me, because I’m rarely unsure of how to respond to a client*\n\nM: “Sorry about that. Didn’t know if this was an office where I had to be directed.”\n\nC: “Okay, and what do you want?”\n\n*Brief pause. More bewilderment*\n\nM: “Uhm, I just wanted to apologize for missing your call, our call center isn’t open until 9A PST and you called at 7.15A PST. So sorry about that. Sounds like you had questions about [product function]? Are you at a pl—“\n\nC: “Okay, I really don’t have time for this. I have to go to a meeting. I’ll just call you later.”\n\nAnd she hangs up on me, leaving me in an uncaffienated stupor, wondering, in short, how we have such awful clients sometimes.\n\nHaven’t heard back from her either, she never called or emailed back. \n\n",

The company is going out of business and really just wants us to tie up loose ends. we are 3rd party call center.\n\nAnyway, at least once a day I am asked to talk to a REAL person. We all get this, we just say we only have chat for real-time help, and then something snippy about being real people. \n\nWe also get the people who some reason write what looks like is meant to be an email even though the big bubble says chat on it. \n\nToday (second chat of the day) the person was BOTH of those things!\n\nCx: Long email/chat about wanting to buy something at a corporate discount rate. Leaves chat before I can greet them. \n\nCx chats back: Why can not call you I need help!\n\nMe: Happy to help, sorry no phone support etc\n\nCX: Let me talk to a real person about corporate sales. \n\nMe: I am a real person and we no longer sell anything directly. \n\nCx: SALES \n\nMe: Hi! We do not have a sales department. Is there anything I can help you with?\n\nCX: SALES DEPARTMENT for corporate discounts\n\nMe: Sorry we do not offer any discounts and we don't sell anything so no sales department. We are tech support only. \n\n\n3 minutes pass\n\n\nCx: Why is there no real person I can talk to??\n\nMe: I am real, now have a great rest of your day BYE!\n\nCx chatted back and Sup took the chat told the same thing and then blocked them from chatting in again.\n\nI know there are a lot of evil chatbots out there but I promise I am a real person.

We’re a small office and we’re efficient, so there is no need for more staff.\n\nLet me preface this with the fact I have a very soft, young-sounding voice. I regularly get calls at home where they asked if I can go and get my parent. I’m nearly middle-aged. So, at work, making and receiving calls can get funny. \n\nOne day (although this could be any number of days; it happens like clock-work), I was doing my script when the guy cuts me off, said I sounded too young to know what I was talking about (he used the word “teenager”), and that he’d be more comfortable with someone older.\n\nSomewhat used to this, I calmly explained that not only am I am the only person here, but that I am qualified and older than I sound. \n\nDude doesn’t believe me, hangs up and calls again, 3 more times. Each time, I reiterate that I am indeed the only one here to handle his enquiry, and that I am not a teenager. Each time he gets more angry/exasperated in his, “You again?!”. Yes, me again. Lovely to speak to you again and get hung up on.\n\nEventually says he will be making a complaint. ‘Kay. Not sure what about? Damn teenagers on the phones?",

She check all cables were secure and that she was on the correct A/V channel. All secure and looking good so far. I then asked her to try something else like a DVD player or anything in the same HDMI port. She was unwilling to do this and requested an engineer.\n\n\"We don't know yet miss if you need a tech yet, could just be the HDMI cable or even the HDMI port itself\"\n\nShe reluctantly tried that and HDMI cable and port were working fine. Now, these TV boxes need to be connected to an ariel for the freeview channels and has online apps such as Netflix etc. Turns out she has picture and sound after telling me the screen is just black, she cannot view live tv through the ariel so I asked her to plug the ariel directly into the coax port on the T. She flips out and starts screaming for an engineer again.\n\n\"To be honest miss, I have a feeling this is the ariel or cable as it's only live tv not working. Our techs don't fix these as it is your equipment\" \n\nShe tells my I'm a dick and some other stuff as I try to get it across to her that if it is the ariel she will be charged for the call out. So I read her the mandatory statement to my surprise she agreed stating that she knows it's the box anyway cos I was wrong about the other cable.\n\nChecked the account after the visit and see a pending engineer charge on account and engineer notes stating: \"unable to complete task as customers own equipment - ariel at fault.",

We weren't busy at all maybe 2-3 calls an hour lasting maybe 2 minutes each.  This lady called in wanting to setup service, sweet a sale....Oh I was naive. \n\nLady: I want to setup service @ 123 Fake st. 12345\n\nMe: I would be glad to help you out with that, give me one moment to bring up that address in our system.  *Address locked due to all accounts being non-pay disconnects* Just Great.  With this we need proof that this tenant did not live at this address at all when the non-pay accounts where active, if they lived there at all the account balances would need paid.\n\nMe: Thank you for the hold, But I regret to inform you right now this address does have a collections lock on it, our collection team would need proof of occupancy, so a lease or deed showing when you moved in, photo ID, or anything showing the date when you moved in.\n\nLady: I ain't doin dat, f*** dat, and f*** you. *hangs up*\n(Yes, she sounded like that)\n\nI was more laughing at this point, but shows me you were trying to scam us, *makes notes of what happened for collections*\n\n*Cue 2 minutes later*\n\nMe: Thank you for calli.....\n\nLady: YOU AGAIN? I don't want to talk to you, I want to talk to someone that will setup my service.\n\nMe: I am sorry but I am the only sales agent in tonight due to the storm, I would be glad to setup service if you provide us with the docume...... *click* Whatever.\n\n*30 seconds later*\n\nLady: WHY DO I KEEP GETTING YOU!!!!!\n\nMe: I told you I am the only agent working in sales, if you call at all tonight you will get me guaranteed.  \n\nLady: *seconds of awkward silence* How much does James owe?\n\nMe: *trying not to laugh, James account was 3 accounts ago.  Which means collections will want those 3 recent accounts paid, and they all owe us equipment*\n\nMe: With all equipment he had, back due, and late fees. $1897.50.\n\nLady: *Starts screaming at \"James\" and ends the call.\n\nI get in the next morning and seems she called and reported me for being rude and unwilling to work with her.  My sup laughed and said she is an idiot.\n\n ",

He hit a pot hole.  Flat tire.  Yay me I get a tow, accident report, and collision. \n \n\nSet up his tire change possible tow, send it off to my tow team to find a vendor.  Explain to him due to location (east coast), and time of day IF we can't change his tire, we're towing his car to his house.  He's cool with it.  \n\n\nSet up collision, and take the ARS.  Get an email from my collision manager having my lead add driver's requested tire shop.  Cool cool.  \n\nFinish up, give the tow spiel and AGAIN explain the tire change may not happen and if not WE WILL TOW HIM HOME.  Let him know we're using his requested tire shop and if he gets towed home, let us know and we'll tow him to shop in the morning.  \n\n\nThe goal here is to not leave the driver stranded AND not have to pay storage fees for the night. He thanks me, asks for my name because I've been helpful.  Woo hoo.  I might get a complement from a decently high up client.  (We can tell VIPS by what they drive) \n\nCut to 45 minutes later.  Vendor on scene.  Says nope to the tire change.  Driver starts flipping his shit because we're towing him home and not to the shop.  \n\nCalls, gets me and chews me out for 5 minutes and WILL NOT LET ME ANSWER HIM.  Like dude STFU and I can tell you why we're doing what we're doing.  \n\nEnd of the call, his vehicle is going to the tire shop tonight.  I noted in the file that it's per driver request and he states they have a night drop and no gated yard.  I don't know nor care how the hell his d-bag ass is getting home from the tire shop. \n\n\nHow do you go from pleasant to d-bag in 45 minutes? ",
