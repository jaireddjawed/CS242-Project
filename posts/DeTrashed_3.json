I don't want to give those assholes my free labor and let them off the hook for actively making our city worse.

It was a 2+ hour effort and a combination of it being both dinner time and getting dark early that ended my push.  I had actually done a similar exercise only the day before at this location, again 2+ hours, but it just needed more time to really make headway.  The trash at this location is overwhelmingly single-use plastic in the form of produce bags, plastic grocery bags (those are still a thing where I live) and food wrappers that (once irresponsibly thrown to the ground or left in a shopping cart in the parking lot) blow all over the place, all followed up by all manner of miscellaneous, including the abomination that is the green plastic Starbuck's stirrer.  It all compacts pretty well, and I use a found plastic shopping bag that I shuttle back to my car where I have a waiting large compostable plastic garbage bag.  At least to the extent that I noticed (I'm largely focused on the ground around me), I got what appeared to be a smile and appreciative half-nod from someone, so there's that!!",

My Christmas wish came true, and on December 30 I made my way to my local Kroger supermarket (what I call the \"new\" Kroger, because there's a second \"old\" Kroger nearby) here in Texas to have at it.  The picture is the result of around 2+ hours of work that first day.  I always look forward to seeing new detrashing pics from others (especially \"before\" and \"after\" pictures--I'm working on those), and I've built up a handful of days of potential posts that will hopefully prove more exciting than my simple shot of \"here's a bag filled with stuff I picked up!\"  I don't know if the one photo I am posting will have its own caption (I didn't see an option to add one), but please someone let me know if there is a way to do that.  When I start posting multiple pictures I'd really like to be able to give more context to each one.  Thanks!",
