        "text": "From *An Opinion on the Rights and Wrongs of our Nation's Dialects* by the Korean scholar Paek Kyonghae (lived 1765~1844) from P'yŏngan Province:\n\n&gt; In the present day, only one province, P'yŏngan, has the correct pronunciation been preserved, thereby keeping the old tradition. In the seven other provinces, \"t'yŏn\" is pronounced \"ch'yŏn\" and \"ti\" has become \"chi.\" In general, all forms that belong to the rows \"ta t'a\" [meaning /t/ and /t^h / with IPA] have become mixed up and have reverted to the rows \"cha ch'a\" [meaning /tɕ/ and /tɕ^h / with IPA]. While among all these places the regional dialects and the local customs are not the same, when it comes to the sounds \"t'yŏndi,\" the seven provinces make the same error together. This is indeed strange.\n\n&gt; [.....]\n\n&gt; So I say, as concerns the phonology of the universe, China is to be taken as correct; as concerns the phonology of our country, P'yŏngan Province is to be taken as correct. Moreover, it is P'yŏngan  Province whence originate our language and writing.\n\nExplanation: I don't fault Paek for not knowing modern linguistics, but phonological change is entirely natural, and the conservative pronunciation prevailing in P'yŏngan is not actually superior because of its conservativeness WRT affrication.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/3vfpio/7_reasons_why_english_is_a_messedup_language/",
        "text": "Let’s take [this one](https://matteroffactsblog.wordpress.com/2015/06/08/5-reasons-why-english-is-a-messed-up-language/) point by point.\n\n&gt; While the amount I write here might lead one to imagine I do nothing else, I do in fact have a day job. I teach English as foreign language.\n\nOh, goody!\n\n&gt; **IRREGULAR VERBS** – not a peculiarly English problem by any means…\n\nCorrect! Too bad he doesn’t realize the same thing applies to most other things on his list as well.\n\n&gt; **HOMOPHONES** – speaking of which why should *rote* and *wrote* have the same sound? They are different words with different words [sic], so why in English do we have to guess which one the speaker means from the context?\n\nDude, have you ever looked at [French](http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/homophones.htm)?\n\n&gt; That particular example is pretty niche but there are some more problematic ones. I recently heard my boss ask a student she was placement testing “what do you wear at school?” and he kept trying to tell her the name of his school because to him the question sounded like “where do you go to school?”.\n\nWhat? Those two sentences don’t sound the same at all!\n\n&gt; **PRONUNCIATION THAT’S ALL OVER THE PLACE** – Homophones exist in part because in English spelling and pronunciation are only weakly correlated with one another.\n\nIsn’t that the same point as above? Are you stretching this list out because you couldn’t actually find seven reasons why English is a messed–up language? Wait a minute, the URL says “5 reasons”! This means two reasons must have been added later! And you still need filler?\n\n&gt; My favourite is that in the sentence ‘I ate a pizza in Pisa’ you say the *ZZ*s as an *s* but the *s* as a *z*.\n\nReally? You pronounce “pizza” the same way as “pisser”?\n\n&gt; My least favourite is that despite both starting with ‘th’, *think* and *the* don’t actually rhyme.\n\nI know what he’s trying to say here, but he phrased it very badly. “Think” and “the” wouldn’t rhyme even if the digraph *th* **were** pronounced the same way in both words.\n\n&gt; **POOR *S* HAS FAR TOO MANY JOBS** – If you want to pluralise something in English you generally add an *s* to the end. But you also do the same to indicate possession. And, an awful lot of the contractions like *it’s* and *let’s* result in a word with an *s* as the final letter.\n\nOh, please! In Polish, an a at the end of a noun can mark the genitive singular, the accusative singular, the nominative plural, the accusative plural, and the vocative plural.\n\nThe German definite article *der* can mark the nominative singular, genitive singular, dative singular, and genitive plural.\n\n&gt; This is in addition to words like *James* and *analysis* that naturally end in *s* for no functional reason.\n\nDoes this guy think other languages assign no more than one function to a letter, and then that letter can’t be used unless it fulfills that function?\n\n&gt; This gets especially confusing when two of those functions are required simultaneously. *Its* really ought to be *it’s* but can’t be because that’s also the contraction of *it is*.\n\nNo, the reason *its* isn’t *it’s* is because possessive adjectives don’t receive an apostrophe. That’s why you don’t write “hi’s” or “he’r.”\n\n&gt; **WE MOVE THE STRESS ALL OVER THE PLACE**\n\nYawn! Take a look at [Russian](http://masterrussian.com/blog/stressed-about-word-stress-in-russian-language/).\n\n&gt; This matters more than one might initially think because wrongly stressed words can be hard to decode and in some cases (like *export*) it actually changes the meaning.\n\nDepending on whether you emphasize the first or second syllable of the German verb *umfahren*, it either means that you drove around something or that you ran it over.\n\n&gt; **OUR VOCABULARY IS PRETTY BYZANTINE** – On this point let me quote a rather good post I stumbled across on a teaching blog: *“In terms of vocabulary, English is like a patchwork. It is a mixture of (mostly) Middle French, Anglo-Saxon, Latin, and Greek. As a result, there are often different words to express the same idea. For example, one doesn’t speak of “touchy feedback” but of “tactile feedback”, and not of “smelly system” but of “olfactory system” (the system in the body that perceives smells). If you do something using your hands, you don’t do it “handily”, you do it “manually”, and the “green” electricity you may be using doesn’t come from “sunny plants” but from “solar plants”.*\n\nAll the examples cited show that those words *don’t* express the same ideas. “Touchy” means “easily offended.” “Tactile” means “relating to touch.” Those are very different concepts, and it should be obvious why you use the latter to describe feedback. Similarly, it should be obvious why you talk of a system that relates to the sense of smell rather than a system that has an unpleasant odor, etc.\n\n&gt; **IT’S NOT CLEAR WHAT CORRECT ENGLISH ACTUALLY IS**\n\nOh boy, I’m not even touching that one!",

Answers asked [this question](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20150823063345AAEEqK6):\n\n&gt; True or false: English is the most normal language?\n\n&gt; English. Where inanimate objects don't have genders and there's not 6 different words for \"the\" depending on the gender and location of the word. \n\n&gt; Also we decided we only need 1 word for \"you\" a few hundred years ago.\n\nWhether these properties are “normal” is entirely subjective. Other people might argue that they make English *less* normal.\n\nOne user by the name of Mark answers:\n\n&gt; Normal? \n\n&gt; English has over a million words. No other language has nearly that many.\n\nFirst of all, [you can’t count the words of a language](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/how-many-words-are-there-in-the-english-language). The “more than a million words” nonsense probably comes from the [Global Language Monitor](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=972). I don’t know where he got the idea that English has a particularly high number of words. (And if English has so many words, how come it has only one for “snow,” huh?)\n\nMark continues:\n\n&gt; English is one of the hardest languages for a foreigner to learn. (And I could argue that it's one of the hardest languages for a native speaker to learn.)\n\nIgnoring that it’s mostly people whose native language is English who think that English is one of the hardest languages to learn (the rest of the world tends to think it’s one of the easiest), the idea that it’s one of the hardest languages to learn *for native speakers* is complete lunacy. He probably only thinks so because native speakers split infinitives, end sentences with a preposition, and do other things that are perfectly grammatical.",

It's a fallacious etymological argument\n2. Whose etymologies are self-contradictory\n3. Which concludes by distorting the meaning and history of the word Mexican for indigenous Mexicans and non-mestizo Mexicans, specifically excluding Mayans, Arab Mexicans, Chinese Mexicans, Jewish Mexicans, and all other non-Nahua-speaking indigenous. (There are many books on the subject, even in English, for which Lund's *The Mestizo State: Reading Race in Modern Mexico* is a good beginning.) I know this last one is probably at best suitable for /r/insensitivesociolinguisticfauxpas but my hackles were raised\n\nSeems like good fodder for /r/badhistory and /r/badconstitutionalinterpretation too, but those aren't my wheelhouse.",
