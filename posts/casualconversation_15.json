I like books from Stephen King, or Chris Colfer, where the writing isn't informal (for example \"Neanderthal Opens the Door to the Universe\" is a little too informal, but it has somewhat a nice plot). Authors I like and recommend are the two I've mentioned, Marie Lu, and that's it. It's not much, so I'm open to any suggestions!",

Yet, since my pain is still present in my body like a scar, this won't do much to alleviate it. \n\nGuess it's gonna be a long time to heal. and then maybe get used to my non-gacha lifestyle",

I suppose the \"safe\" thing to do would be to rent an apartment, and get locked into a lease before I can be released from it.

Might chat with one anyway to see if they have a solution.\n\nI can afford to visit (and plan on visiting) the area once before I move.\n\nSo what's the safest and best way to do this?

        "text": "So about a year ago I found one of my oldest friends on Instagram after not seeing her for a very long time and we've been talking ever since. I really like her and I'd like to get her number to take that \"next step\" and try to show a little bit of interest, but considering we've been talking on there for a year just fine, I feel like it might come across as weird. I would ask her in person, but she kinda lives on the other side of the state, so that's not exactly possible. How would you go about asking in this situation? I'm not really sure what to say without it sounding weird",

        "text": "Normally, I get around 6-10 likes on posts I have on facebook. I normally post about my kids and funny memes or jokes and it makes me happy that my friends think it's funny too. I gotta admit, on a good day, seeing 20 likes for congratulating me on stuff really makes happy. But other than that, I move on with my life.\n\nI thought it didn't matter much until my older sister brought it up. I'm currently 27 and my sister is 41. When we were little she used to nag me to take care of my acne (which was uncontrollable to me back then). Overtime, when I meet up with her, she always ask when will I ever fix my crooked teeth. I got a little self-conscious about my image and felt maybe my own sister is embarrassed to be seen around with me. So I fixed my teeth and my teenage years of awkward acne is gone. The nagging seem to stopped.\n\nBut then recently she exploded on how I could be so weird lately. I think it also stems from the fact I went No Contact on our narcisstic mother (unrelated story). She suddenly exploded on \"Who do you think you are? You are just a pathetic person. Ugly too. You're just a nerd yet you act all high and mighty. What you post is weird and not funny at all. That's why you only get like 10 likes. Do you ever think about that???\"\n\n\nTo answer her I question, I think of myself as a broken person who seeks therapy because of my mother. I wasn't trying to start a fight. I also know I can be weird sometimes and am not the best looking person out there. But it's weird that she brought up social media likes.....is she trying to indicate that my weirdness was so obvious and it's showing?\n\nI never thought much about likes. I have 265 friends and she has over 2,000 friends online. So I just thought she has more friends to get around 20 likes on every single post. Or also because she may have more friends because she has life experience and has met all kinds of people up to her age now.\n\nShould i be reconsidering how my reputation is? Does this mean most of my friends don't really like what I post?",

        "text": "All week, I've been thinking about sitting at the park in my neighborhood with a slurpee from the gas station on my way home from work. So today, it's a nice, clear day, relatively warm, perfect outdoor weather. Get off of work, get my stuff, chillax at the park, clear my head a bit. Sometime later I'm about halfway through my large slushy when I notice a brown pickup truck slowly circling the park (it's sort of rectangular shaped, curved along the main neighborhood road and on the other side is a straight road, it makes a sort of D shape coming from my work), I'm talking like, 5 on a 30mph. I only really recognized him because in my dream last night (I had been contemplating it too because I literally never dream) I had been followed and kidnapped, escaped, and then got followed again ans that car had done the exact same thing basically the truck irl was doing-and both took place in my neighborhood too.\n\nI was super on edge and had been all day because I had never felt such pure horror as when I had seen the cars in my dream, so I immediately locked on to that truck, trying to reassure myself I'm paranoid. 2nd or 3rd lap, he gets passed by some car that looks like my mom's, and I'm like oh okay. Thank fuck. She's going normal speed, but turns down the straight edge of the D and parks and as the truck turns down the same way, I'm like okay no. Fuck this shit, I grab my bag and fucking book jt across the park. As I'm going through the park that truck parks and as I get to the top point, the lady who'd park rolls her window down and yells if he's following me, had been watching, had a sister in high school about my age and wanted to check on me. I was nervous but I didnt know what to do, I didn't think it'd be worth it to call the police because I was so close to my house (5-10 min walk) and this was such a safe neighborhood. I've walked home all the time in the dark it's only a 15 minute walk from work straight through the neighborhood and I encounter night runners (more often than not other women) quite frequently. So she offered to drive along side me to help me get home, I was super freaked out and I guess I was more trusting because I had thought initially she was my mom. I realize now this coild have made it worse, but she helped me get away from the main street and away from the truck and I went the last stretch alone. When I had looked back that truck had stopped at a corner for a bit and then I got out of sight and I dont know where he went. This happened about  45 minutes ago and I'm still shaking so badly. If it weren't for this woman I don't even know what could have happened because I was so scared, knew I technically wouldn't be able to go home but also I didn't have anywhere else to go. Thank you to my guardian angel. I don't even want to think about what would have happened if it weren't for you.",

I’ve been driving for 10+ years and have always had mild anxiety from it but the anxiety has gotten so much worse since 2 years ago and continues to get worse. It seems to get worse if I practice too because something stressful will happen. Having to making quick judgements to avoid a crash, hearing something that sounds like gunshots on the freeway, feeling agoraphobic at times, etc. i always think of the worst case scenario, so I always feel like I’m going to die in a crash before I get in the car. \n\nNo one in my life understands it. To them it’s not a big deal at all and I don’t understand how most people don’t get scared about it. I have to Uber most places now which costs a lot but there aren’t many public transportation options here. I just hate it because I love getting out but I just can’t drive anymore without having a panic attack",

I've always been able to feel that there is something beautiful in every person and that beauty is something I feel privileged to notice everyday. It's why I'm going into psychology, so people can realize their authentic selves. \n\nBut with that, I can count on one hand people I feel I've actually related with. And it's not talking about finding people with similar interests. I love art, spirituality, history, etc, and I have no problems finding people who share them. It's more of a way of thinking. Theres ways I think that just end up confusing people when I go into detail about some of my thoughts. They make sense in my head and it's usually pretty rational. But when I have to explain a thought I'm having, it feels like writing a 3 page essay just to hey my point along. It feels like I just approach things from different angles, and It's hard for people to understand where I'm coming from.\n\nOne person I've always felt I have a good relation with is my grandmother. While I've Definitely got my differences from her, her being a more catholic conservative person and me who's distanced myself from that a bit, I have always felt like I could tell her anything and she could understand where I'm coming from. There's just a click. \n\nAnother is a woman I used to date. She was into Shakespeare a lot, something I'm not too knowledgeable about. But the way she talked about it, how she felt that connect and why she connected to it, I totally understood where she was coming from and why. I never felt that connected to someone outside of my grandmother before or since.\n\nSome people I get along with very well are people with autism. While I don't have autism (I do have adhd) and I don't really relate with them the way I'm talking about, I do relate with them in The way they feel misunderstood.\n\nThe reason why it sucks it not because I have trouble connecting to people or feel lonely about it. I get along with people really well and have always felt like I was apart of something. But having people really get me has just leaves me kinda exhausted. And those that I click with don't really last long. My grandmother is in her mid 80s and won't be around for much longer, and I stopped talking with that one girl a long time ago. I just wish there was like a tribe I could find that really understand the way I think. But that's hard by itself because I have not idea how to explain even what I'm talking about. But just one person, be it a spouse, a mentor, a good friend, would be enough just to know I can relate with someone once my grandmother passes.",

Therefore, you still NEED a job to continue your life and buy good things and so on. \n\nQuestion:\nKnowing that the survival element (rent + groceries + health) is covered for sure everywhere in the world. Where would you relocate? And would you get a job? Or would you stay on the UBI and go on with life.",
