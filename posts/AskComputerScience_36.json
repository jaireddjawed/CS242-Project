If so, produce this output and halt. Otherwise, run the algorithm as usual. It is unlikely that this will be successful, but in the best-case the running time will only be as long as it takes to check a solution. For example, we could modify selection sort to ﬁrst randomly permute the elements of A, then check if they are in sorted order. If they are, output A. Otherwise run selection sort as usual. In the best case, this modiﬁed algorithm will have running time Θ(n).\n\nMy question is why bother doing this? Wouldn't input A be just as likely to have the elements in the correct order than A randomized?",

But I'm sure that employers would rather see certain languages on an applicant's resume over others, i.e. some form of demand or preference. I would also imagine that there would be a salary discrepancy (however minor) that reflects this. So are there any foreign languages worth mentioning? \n\nI've learned Spanish throughout high school, and have considered Spanish, German, and Japanese for college (I'm a soon-to-be college freshman). I don't really care much for Spanish, though I don't dislike it either. I'm at a B2 level in it though, so I would probably be fluent by the end of college. I care more for German culture and Germany than Spanish, but I have no familiarity. I'm very familiar with Japanese culture and I think the language is really nice (I'm not a weeb, though), but of these languages Japanese is the only one in which I wouldn't be able to study abroad to Japan; I would have to do a student exchange which is a bit more complicated and difficult.

A PDF, for what I know, is shown as 2d vector image, so the user actually scrolls a 2d image (like in a browser). Therefore if one is scrolling a lot to get to a certain location (say from page 1 to page 70), I would assume that the action would be intensive enough to saturate at least one arm core that runs around 1 Ghz.\n\nI'm not aware that the GPU can help to process the PDF (like handling it as a 2d texture), aside from showing it.\n\nAm I wrong to consider handling PDF taxing - for the CPU - more than interactions like writing on whatsapp or taking a picture?",

My first year average was absolutely abysmal, like 66% or something, and while I did ok in the first semester of this year ( five A's and a C, not exactly fantastic but better than first year...), I definitely failed my software engineering exam, and will more than likely fail networks and programming, and do awfully in algebra because I've put all my time into other subjects to try and get anyways decent results in them?\n\nWhat do I do? What am I missing with CS? Getting all these rubbish results and not doing well is soul destroying for me, because I've always liked school and always been really good at it. And I know the obvious answer is switch course, but here in Ireland unfortunately that's just not an option for financial reasons. \n\nI would seriously appreciate any advice or feedback, I just feel so incredibly down and lost about the whole situation.",

For example, if I study discrete math, I improve my math, I improve my software engineering skills (by learning about graphs, recursion etc.) and I improve my infosec skills (by learning about number theory). So, *I guess* that discrete mathematics could be classified as the first principle for these four fields. \n\nOn the contrary, learning about DDoS attacks, for example, would only benefit me in infosec and while that is something I'll have to learn at some point, it's not a first principle.\n\nCould someone with knowledge of these fields give me a list of topics that would provide me the first principles of these fields (the areas of study that would provide the most overlap between these four fields)? Also, if you could provide some resources (books or videos) and some sample projects where I'd drive the point home, that'd be great (something like a curriculum of sorts).\n\nThanks in advance!",

Or perhaps a textbook with a readily available solutions manual?\n\nI'm finding that many algorithms books do not have an extensive amount of worked-out solutions. Reading a book alone doesn't do much for me. I learn best by doing, so working out problems with the ability to check my solutions is ideal. \n\nIf there are no such books, then I'll stick with CLRS and find worked out homework problems.",
