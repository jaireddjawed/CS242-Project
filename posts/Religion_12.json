He was in his early 30s and had 2mo old son. \n\nHe was in the ICU for 3 days and during that time I was watching his 2mo son while his wife was at the hospital. \n\nThis guy was the purest of the pure. Loved by literally everyone. His death broke our family and our small town. He was a first responder, overly generous and always talked about being a dad. \n\nUntil last week I was thinking that we were just living in a random universe. But this is all too evil and wicked to be random. I’m now in the place where I believe God is real and that he might be evil. \n\nWhat god would do this? It’s not like his death served a purpose. It only caused pain and will continue to do so for the rest of our lives. \n\nI don’t want to think this way and I guess I’m looking for reasons to not think this way. \n\n\nTLDR: I think god is evil.",

He leads everyone astray from the truth of god and allows them to believe false hoods about said god which will lead them to hell. He will also found a religion and get the true children of God aka Jews founders of first religion to his own and that will lead them through sin with enticements that appeal to them that will do them to eternal suffering.  What does Christianity say, deliver us from evil. Only the true children of God and true Believers will see the anti Christ for what he appears to be and denounce him as their saviour. Now, think of how Jews don't recognise jesus even though this mother f walks round calling himself they king. If he's the king and there to help why not allow them to stay Jews, why do they have to denounce the first, true religion and join his and denounce their religions words, why do Catholics do sadistic things and horrible stuff but still go on telling themselves their okay and will be forgiven. Because they've been enticed away from their original religion with the belief they won't be judged but that they'll be forgiven. Nah man hell's probably full of catholics, \n  why is it a religion where they rewrote all sorts of pagan ritual stuff and dress like wizards? all sorts of evil people who work for Catholics, I went to catholic school they terrible trust me.  Now think of how Jesus died to save us right ? Wrong jesus died to trap us on earth so we could keep making babies, and keep living only to harm and live in our sin and get worse and further from god overtime, if you religious look around you since jesus came no.1 around the world with his bestselling book we all fucked up even worse than before.",

        "text": "A year ago I began an existential crisis and took a deep plunge into religion as much as I could. I asked people questions here, I visited various religious services at temples, churches, etc., and I spent hundreds of hours in prayer and meditation.\n\nWith that, there is one thing I can say with certainty.\n\nI am *completely* unqualified to speak about religion and spirituality. Like holy crap\n\nWhich is to say, in my experience, this subreddit may not be the most productive place to seek answers or experiences.\n\nOn the low end, people will dedicate 4 years of their life to learn how to teach a religion, and as much as 16+ years of single-minded study for some other traditions. There is a world of difference between speaking to a person online who participates in a religion and a scholar or monk dedicated to the pursuit of their tradition.\n\nThe other struggle on a forum like this is that you will probably mostly encounter *marketing information* about a religion, rather than what it's like to experience the tradition firsthand. That's not to say there aren't good recourses on the internet, there are, but sifting past the tip of the iceberg to the meat and potatoes can be difficult at times.\n\nHere's the part where I do that think that I am completely unqualified to do, feel free to ignore this section.\n\nIf you're willing to thrust yourself into this subject with all you have, time, effort, dedication, intensity, an open mind, go beyond your comfort zone, and take risks, then I have no doubt that your experience in this pursuit will be completely different.\n\nIn my short 22 y/o life, no other period of time has even come close to how wild my experience in this last year has been. And in those few precious times when I was really willing to put forth everything I knew how without compromise, that's when life felt like something completely new. (disclaimer, this was often accompanied by emotions like confusion, discomfort, despair, and sleepless nights. Religion is a hell of a drug)",

        "text": "Hi - my wife and I were raised Catholics but have identified a lot with Buddhist teachings for the past decade or longer. With 2 kids (3 and 8yo) we wanted them to have some religious experience like we had when we were growing up. The challenge is that we don't see Buddhism as a good option for families with small kids and we'd like to avoid Catholicism as it doesn't resonate as much with us any longer. \n\nFor that reason, we were open to considering other options. We came across the Unitarian church, which seemed like a great option as they welcome kids and teach good values, without being too attached to religious symbols or dogmas. After experiencing a couple of Unitarian Churches, though, we noticed that they seem to be very much focused on progressive (left wing) values. We went to 4 services across 2 Unitarian churches and in every service they would talk about gender fluidity, being queer, being on indigenous lands, white privilege, etc. We have NOTHING against that, but we don't want to take our kids to service that focus so much on those things. Is that the experience others have with Unitarian churches or is this because we're in the Pacific Northwest?\n\nAlong those lines, any suggestions for other non-dogmatic churches that we should consider?\n\nThank you so much.",

I'm asking for an outsider's perspective because I believe I'll relate to it better than I would an insider's perspective.\n\nI'm going to warn you right here that I am going to be harsh and frank in expressing what I view to be the shortcomings of Abrahamic religion. My intention is not to offend anyone, but rather to voice my feelings and beliefs honestly so that they can be challenged.\n\nKeep that in mind before you read on.\n\n\\----\n\nThe major tenets of these religions just seem so barbaric and vile to me... all their theology seems to elaborate on the basic point of, \"us good, them bad.\" There's nothing in the much-lauded \"moral teachings\" that isn't found in the philosophies of other religions and civilizations.\n\nThe doctrine of eternal hell is abhorrent in itself, but the use of it to back up a \"join us or else\" threat is just disgustingly cynical. These religions feel like machines designed to do nothing more than propagate themselves and eliminate all competition.\n\nWhen we talk about tolerating other religions, we run into the paradox of tolerance with these two. They are perhaps some of the greatest killers of religion in history. Who knows what valuable teachings are lost forever because of them, or what will continue to be lost as they continue to work to destroy indigenous beliefs?\n\n\\----\n\nSo yeah, I'd really like to know what good can be observed in them from an outsider's perspective.",

Unlike 4th century eucharistic rites, it doesn’t include the e*piklesis* or sign of the cross. Rather, follows Pauline order in the wine and the bread. \n\nWhat does that mean? Specifically the stuff about the Didache being \"Pauline free.\" There is also a sentence about how being a Pauline is to be Jewish, and that \"Pauline Christianity\" means including gentiles into Israel's covenant. What does that also mean? I feel like I'm missing context.",

People have mistaken my confusion for hostility, unacceptance and immaturity, (even stating that I need to grow) It's also confusing for me as a young man who believes Christ to make a decision that is \"right\". But I also respect and care for her deeply. It's also the fact that my parent (mother) tells me to be not to \"unequally yoked\". And so with the knowledge and wisdom passed down by my predecessors before me. I'm also trying to make a just and fair scenario. Because it scares me in several ways. It's not that I'm restrictive of her. I'm not being restrictive. I'm being restricted. And people's seems to confused that. I'm not being hostile. I just don't know what to do 🤷‍♂️.

So I looked it up and I happen to be quite interested in history and I ended up learning that \"pre-christianity\" means before Christianity and is rooted in Ireland which she is part Irish and has Irish grandparents. So it started to add up to me. Now she is openly telling me that she is a Pagan. And I'm telling her my stance on things while being respectful and I'm giving it raw because we both value truth to the upmost value. The relationship is healthy overall but this is the first conflict and this is an extremely big thing. Not a small argument 😣 over something petty. IT'S RELIGION! I don't know what to do I don't want to lose her but I can't compromise on this. To me, it's heresy she's speaking. And it's clearly not a denomination of Christianity. She says it's about \"nature and life\" and she's talking about several different gods of nature instead of serving one god. So as a Christian male (17yr Old). My girlfriend is stated she is turning Pagan and I don't even know what to do but stand firm in my religion. The reason I was dating her before was because she was \"undecided\" and had christian-ish parents.",

What? So are there stories in the Talmud, or is it seriously just a massive encyclopedia of laws where suddenly there's this story about time traveling Moses that essentially stealth bombs it's way into the middle of everything?",

My personal approach to morality is not rooted in divine command. I'm here to reconcile an apparent contradiction in the text, rather than trying to rebuild my own moral framework.\n\nI stumbled upon an apparent contradiction recently. It confuses me that Adam and Eve were expected to know to obey G-d command to not eat of the forbidden fruit, where it is otherwise implied or outright stated that G-d's will is synonymous with Good. If they had not yet partaken of the forbidden fruit, they could not have known that it was evil to disobey G-d. The fact that they were expected to know to obey regardless suggests a distinction between divine will and morality. (Or that they were being set up to fail, which just seems mean.)\n\n\nI've just read through the Wikipedia pages on divine command theory and the Euthyphro dilemma, which I would recommend to anyone seeking further context on the idea of G-d's will as synonymous with Good. I didn't see any writings on how that applies specifically to the forbidden fruit, and wanted to get y'all's thoughts on the conundrum.",

        "text": " \n\nThe true, \"let's face it\" nature of existence is simply this:\n\n**Existence only appears, and has only ever appeared, in the form of a person and that which the person experiences.**\n\nYou can see this just by observing yourself  You are essentially an *experience* that has a *chronologically ordered number and type of experience.* \n\nThis is the form in which Existence appears, and one surmises, *the only form in which it can appear.*\n\nLogically, therefore, given existence only appears and only appeares (and probably can only appear) in the form of a person and that which the person experiences, subjective experience *must come from somewhere* as opposed to just magically popping into existence \"bells and whistles attached\" from previous non-existence (i.e. it makes no sense why the experience that just \"comes into existence\" experiences what it experiences at all, without external pre-existing subjective experience providing context for the nature of that which one experiences at any given moment).\n\nGiven existence only appears in the form of persons, this \"warehouse\" from which persons appear and have their particular brand of experience is more logically an external *Person* as opposed to an external *space* filled with that which is not subjective experience at all.\n\n(As it makes no sense for subjective experience to gain its existence from that which is *not* subjective experience: what within the substance of that which is not subjective experience, given it is not subjective experience at all, does it use to produce something it, itself, is not?)\n\nPantheopsychic Theology proposes the External Person is none other than...THE JUDEO-CHRISTIAN GOD!\n\nThus God is the source of human experience, such that God imagines/experiences something, and it is replicated by an external person (notice the lower case \"p\"), that is a construct of Existence that is programmed, so to speak, to replicate or create copies of the fictional imaginative content constantly produced by God (the External Person)'s mind.\n\nOr in other words, God is \"Stephen King\" and we are his characters, in all the various and sundry \"novels\" that are produced, in the form of the lives and experiences from birth to death experienced by each person, as when you think about it, God has nothing else better to do than spin internal stories that are replicated by Existence outside the confines of His mind.\n\nWith every negative thing that shall ever happen, and every negative experience any being shall ever experience part of the narrative of His ongoing psychic \"novel\":\n\n**\"TALES FROM THE CRUCIFIXION\".**\n\nWhich He is currently dreaming/dreamed while crucified (depending upon whether or not time is non-linear in nature, *such that it may be the crucifixion from our perspective is still going on* while to God it completed eons ago, such that from the perspective of God and the saved \\[which if one is saved, upon one's death one \"wakes up\" eons *beyond and outside* the Crucifixion and it's Crucified or Sacrificial Dream into Abraham's Bosom\\], only Heaven exists).\n\nPantheopsychism is fun.\n\n(Never fear, just finished page #12 of **Pantheopsychic Comics #3:** ***What Must I Be To Be Saved,*** but before bed decided to present this, as it was on the mind).\n\nJay M.

        "text": "They seem to believe that the world and its natural laws are God's creation, \"divine\"... that the natural laws \"speak for themselves\" so to speak of God's Will. \n\n...\n\nYet they have to believe in a creator God? If creation itself is divine, then why do we even have a need to acknowledge the divine to begin with? God and gods themselves did not \"appear.\" Why can't they take this disappearance at face value? \n\n...\n\nBetter yet, if there really is an all-benevolent God, while all of his creations and its natural laws were so divine that they can't be broken... why didn't he simply appear and say it so? Say that it was made for man, but that he won't break the laws just for humans?\n\nHow is \"absolute disappearance of God\" any reasonable indication that God exists and that Nature exists in absolute non-conflict with him? Despite all the pain and suffering in the world, even, still unable to solve the problem of evil?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n... this is the problem with the Age of Reason. As much as people are tired of Postmodernism, understandibly, too often many of the loudest in any \"Zeitgeist of Reason\" are the most self-conflicting and unreasonable. It was true starting with Aristotle and it has been true ever since.\n\nWhy not be honest for once? Why not admit, wholeheartedly, that what you value is not \"reason\" but \"security and safety\"? And often personal/exclusive security and safety, or indoctrinated moral disgust, even at the expense of true reason, getting in the way of clear sight? Why do you think postmodernity had to appear in the first place? It appeared after modernity, not before. Why do you think that is?\n\nWe have to move forwards, not backwards. Just because we're tired of postmodernity, we're not about to let the world regress into modernity to relearn its lessons. It is precisely the recompensation of reason for \"order, security, and safety\" that created modernity, and precisely that which degenerated it into postmodernity.\n\nWe may pay for being unreasoable from time to time - but we all pay severely for being unreasonable in the name of reason. Either we stay in postmodernity until we need to find something new, or the world crumbles once again, following false voices of reason.\n\nI really hope that is the age of True Reason. Not what we previously held as examples of \"reason.\"\n\n\\-------------- \n\nIt's true that I've had spiritual experiences and hold \"unreasonable beliefs\" myself, but I keep it wholeheartedly and entirely to myself until I absolutely experienced and processed it myself, and keep in completely within minor fringe forums (which that I don't even often do, since it's often just absolute chaos). I'm not about to proselytize or write a book to the general public about something without absolute proof. That is my burdern to bear.  (And NO I will not talk further about it) \n\nI really cannot say the same about many popular figures today. But I really hope, if we're giving Reason another chance, that most people operate this way. Not just about religion, but about philosophy, arts, and most especially the sciences.",

The Bible says: Christians are NOT under the law of Moses, they are under the law of Christ. In that sense, we can say Christianity is fundamentally peaceful.\n\nWe can't say the same about Judaism and Islam (which is a copy + paste of the worst parts of Judaism).\n\nBut we have to separate what the religion teaches VS what followers do. Christians haven't always been peaceful... But we can say that developed Christian countries are the best places in the world for gays, women, apostates, atheists and people of other religions. Christians become peaceful with prosperity and education. Can we say the same about Jews? Is that why Judaism is not so harmful? Is it because Jews tend to value education and enlightenment?\n\nWhat about Islam? Muslim countries continue to be the worst places in the world for minorities, they still have death penalty and persecution, even when they are rich countries. And [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah/) indicates that most Muslims in several countries do support such things as terrorism and death penalty for apostates. What does Islam lack to become peaceful? How come it doesn't become peaceful these days even when prosperity is present?\n\n*Famous quote:*\n\n*“The God of the Old Testament \\[also Jewish and Muslim God\\] is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.” ― Richard Dawkins.*",

        "text": "I saw a video recently by an atheist YouTuber called Cosmic Skeptic that was a debate between him and a Christian, and he went into his search for God and how he still does not believe. He said the following: **I have, to put it mildly, been looking for God. At university I visited numerous churches. I attended Bible groups. I read Athanasius and Anselm. I read Augustine and Aquinas. I looked in Julian of Norwich and Catherine of Sienna. I looked at the sociological origin of religious belief in Durkheim and Marx and Freud and Jung. I looked at religious experience in William James and Rudolf Otto. I've looked in the modern works of people like Ed Feser and Bill Craig and Michael Murray and Richard Swinburne and Alvin Plantinga. I have looked in poetry. I have looked in the Psalms. I have looked in Job. I have looked in Ecclesiastes. I have looked in Dostoyevsky. I read C.S. Lewis. I listened to worship music. I prayed. I studied the Gospel. I even got an actual degree in theology from a university and...nothing. Nothing. Not once, not nearly, not ever, not even briefly have I experienced anything that speaks to the existence of a God in the universe.**\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?",
