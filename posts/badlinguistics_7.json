        "text": "This is a rant. I need to get this off my chest because I've been plagued with this nonsense for years now, but I never put it to pen.\n\nI am an American Sign Language-English interpreter and have been involved in the field for the number of years now. I'm also a linguist by training. The amount of bad linguistics that I see propagated in the ASL community is astounding, by both Deaf and hearing people alike. In the past few years, I've seen the following claims:\n\n1. American Sign Language has no grammar. (This was purported by a Deaf person himself. His claim was that ASL was not like English, which has grammar, and as a result, ASL does not have grammar.)\n2. ASL is OSV because it is a visual language. (One of ASL's marked sentence structures is OSV, but that's not because of ASL's visual-spatial modality. Tons of spoken languages use OSV sentence structure.)\n3. ASL's unmarked sentence structure is OSV. (It's actually SVO, but this gets taught to a lot of beginner ASL students, in an attempt to get them used to OSV sentence structure.)\n4. In ASL, there are no words, only concepts. (Slightly convoluted, so let me explain: Replacing the word \"word\" with \"sign\", a popular belief in ASL is that there are no words. For example, the sign TREE doesn't represent a tree, but rather the concept of a tree. This sort of thinking is heavily found in the interpreting community.)\n\nThere's also a lot of prescriptivism throughout. There's a lot of policing in the ASL community about what constitutes \"pure ASL\" versus that which has been \"contaminated\" with English. In interpreter training programs, \"pure ASL\" is the only form of ASL that is taught to students, even though the language that is being used in the community can heavily deviate from that.\n\nThere's also a prevalent practice that the way to improve a student's ASL skills is to immerse them in the Deaf community without providing them any sort of L2 instruction about the grammar. I will admit, yes, this is the best way to improve your expressive and receptive skills. Nonetheless, most ASL students do not have the training to analyze the language that they are exposed to. How is a student supposed to learn how to improve their ASL if they don't know what they're supposed to be looking for?\n\nBear in mind that most people who become interpreters do not have any sort of linguistic training. They bring out the worst of prescriptivism, and such attitudes about language often influence their work. There are interpreting pages on Facebook, for example, and many of them are rife with complaints about non-standard dialects of English (one of the common targets being AAVE, or African-American Vernacular English).\n\nThere's a lot more I can go on about, but I needed to touch on at least the tip of the iceberg.\n\nEdit: changed all of the mentions of \"OVS\" to \"OSV\"",
