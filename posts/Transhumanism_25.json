        "text": "I was just thinking about how learning works, and a big part of it that isn't touched on is *acquisition of skills*. \n\nThe common misconception is that thought and movement are directly connected, but there's a reason why watching football doesn't make you better at it. When you catch a ball, navigate through your cluttered house, or flip a bottle (kill me), that is coming straight from your \"motor neurons\". \n\nNow, this isn't a lesson on the motor cortex, especially since it's mostly theory based on what I know. The question is, how would the AI store these movement patterns? Running from text and natural language understanding is highly inefficient, and using the same programming language for everything couldn't cover every paradigm. \n\nAnother huge supporting factor for this is the way the brain stores information: in chunks. Like an infinitely compressing tree of files, and we \"unpack\" these in our working memory (not a capacity of 7 bytes or 7 digits; 7 *chunks*). Think of it like extracting a language's source code from a ZIP file and building it. \n\nPerhaps the primary obstacle for Strong AI is our rigid psychological fixation on using a single programming language for the whole thing, but no one language can do *everything*. A lot of languages are logic-based and determinstic. How are you going to create emotions with that? Speaking of which, **any ideas on how an emotion-oriented programming language would work?**\n\n**TL;DR - Our body utilizes so many different cell types, chemicals, nutrients, molecules, etc so why shouldn't we?**",

The base is kind of like Moore's Law and the hardware. The components are kind of like the huge tree of languages, libraries, and programs, infinitely branching out. \n\nIf we were looking at artificial intelligence (software plus hardware) as a species, what percentage of our DNA do you think it would \"share?\"",

Would hot temperatures effect it at all?\n\nI work with my hands often enough that I worry about bumping/smashing etc.\n\nCould I get it implanted in the fatty under part of my arm like where birth control implants go? Inner thigh? My thought with those places is they are insulated by clothes more often. I'd like to use it for data storage, and it doesn't have to be easily accessible for everyday use.",

        "text": "Note: this is a long post and it's written in mobile, typos may be present. feel free to share your views with me in the comments. Thanks \n\nIve realized something. I'm not much like you guys. We have the similarity of biotechnology as common grounds but I personally see a different world than you. \n\nA while back yes, I did believe that the best way to achieve solace was to get rid of pain and suffering. Take out emotion. Be as robotic as possible through technology. I knew in my future that superiority would come from who had better cybernetics or better augmentations, but after a scuttle with the wrong people in life, several years of having a broke heart, and then learning history and most importantly the philosophies of romance I've settled on a new view.\n\nTranshumanism in my eyes isn't so much about getting rid of suffering, or depression and the bad things in life, more than it is about enhancing the good and bad of what makes us human. I'm not saying we should die of disease or let genetic deformities cripple us, but I'm talking about our mental states. I believe having days when you feel sad, and depressed are key to letting you feel the highs of the good ones. Melancholy and Happiness go hand in hand. I\n\nMy view is that you can physically augment yourself. Enhance yourself for a better future as I'd say it, but not replace yourself. Augmented limbs would be fantastic. Neural laces to let us dream better would make my world. Being able to interact more intimately with another human being through better senses. Imagine being wildly in love with someone and then reciprocating that love through experiences your brain had never felt before because your enhanced body can now read others better than our native minds could. Or perhaps you have a broken heart or you just have a bad day, and your body records the way you feel, your brain is assisted by chemicals after to help you get well. You could go back and remember how you felt about something. Say for example, You could have augmented eyes, and visit and art museum in Paris, and perhaps your brain, assisted by computers or by other means would let you indulge in art like never before, putting you in the scene. Rather than hiding behind a screen trans humanism can be used to bring people together, and closer. There is life in death, but no life in silicone. Think about that for a second. Robots aren't human. \n\nAnd on another topic I believe that cybernetics are the safe and better way to go. I believe that genetic augmenting is too youthful as of now. In the long run it's our answer to deep space exploration and enhancement but I don't think anyone would like to live in a world where genetic hierarchy determines your role and enjoyment in society.  GE needs time to mature like a fine wine. It only gets better in time. \n\nThat's just me though. I know for a fact people feel differently, and that's okay. But, in the rare chance someone out there does agree with me, I'll find comfort in knowing I'm not the only one. ",

So I can't help but think that we are as likely to make ourselves smarter directly as we are to make a machine do it.\nGranted, the result could very well be the same.
