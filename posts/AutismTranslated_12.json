        "text": "Okay so I have never been tested for anything because of strict christian parenting but have always felt different from everyone else and been told that\nI learned a lot about autism but i still don’t know if these traits would be signs that point toward it.\n\nSo I compiled them into a list:\n\n1. Extremely picky eater as a child, still struggle with certain foods now depending on textures such as pudding, cottage cheese, or milkshakes\n2. Wouldn’t wear socks as a child because of how they felt, still don’t like it but do it anyway (some other clothing textures as well)\n3. If i am interrupted in what i am doing, i can often completely lose sight of what i was doing previously. Even making this list, i get other ideas to add to it and they interrupt me typing and then i forgot what i was originally gonna put LMAO\n4. Much more bothered by bright lights and loud sounds than other people around me, they can sometimes make me feel trapped in a box if that makes sense \n5. Often I am very fidgety, and will do little movements such as rocking side to side especially if i am stressed or over stimulated and cannot stop myself\n6. Struggled greatly to socialize as a child (Did not say a word all throughout preschool and kindergarten), then after i was homeschooled i returned to enroll in high school where i pushed out of my comfort a little more   \n7. honorable mention would be that i have several obsessions but i don’t think that is exclusive to ASD. I love art history, geography, and super smash bros melee a TON and get absolutely lost in conversation if someone even mentions one of those three\n\nAlso: i don’t think i have ADHD, since that’s based on attention span which I kind of have the opposite issue with. I feel like i get so lost into things that it becomes an issue\n\nAny honest opinions and replies are appreciated :)",

        "text": "I feel like a huge part of the neurodivergent experience for different conditions is the nightmare that is school. For autism specifically, what's mentioned the most is the overwhelming sensory environment and bullying. Even in giftedness (which I confirmedly have) there is a tendency to reject school or perform poorly because of a need for more challenge and boredom caused by repetition.\n\nI never experienced any of these issues- in fact, I used to love elementary school, and I recognized how this was different to how my peers felt. I liked easy and straightforward assignments even if I had done similar ones many times, and still do; despite having a much stronger interest in creative writing, I prefer tasks like equations that have a single precise solution, and don't get me worrying about whether I understood and followed an instruction correctly.\n\nEven in secondary school, when I started struggling more and becoming really frustrated with having to work on topics I found irrelevant to my interests, I still had that underlying feeling of appreciation for school and education- I recognized it was the current system where I lived that sucked, not the school itself- and I felt very thankful for having the chance to access a good school.\n\nI can forgive miraculously surviving bullying (I don't know how, there are honestly so many reasons that would have made me a target), but the imposter syndrome often takes this positive view on school to dismiss the possibility of autism entirely. I've thought that giftedness compensating for autism could explain how this happened, and at the same time I feel like autism could explain why I don't relate to the gifted experience too strongly either (like the comfort of repetition and unambiguity), but I can't help but think that if I really struggled significantly, it wouldn't have been possible for me to get through the experiences that come with school as easily.",

I felt way too guilty to even approach the subject again (even though it wasn't \"solved\" in my head) because I felt judged.\n\nAnyway, two months ago, after months of research and experience, I told my therapist again. We talked about it just this week and since he was as usual \"beating around the bush\" i asked him directly if I were autistic. He gave me a detailed explanation of me having schizotypical traits that are most prominent during adolescence for the hormonal imbalances (I don't have a disorder). He then told me that I can learn how to behave in a group and manage my energy levels. And that the derealisation and depersonalisation I felt and feel are related to anxiety. \n\nI just want to hear your thoughts on this. I am a guy that naturally doubts everything so this is making me feel as if I just can't accept the fact that I was and am wrong about being autistic.",

        "text": "I really struggle to have \"casual, reciprocal conversations\" (see footnote) with people unless someone can explain to me the exact words I need to say and when and in what order and so on. I worked in sales in my 20s and spent roughly 18 months doing Monte Carlo tree search-style learning to figure out scripts for conversations about common topics and filed them away as successful or unsuccessful based on whether or not I made a sale and how much money I made. I calculated that it took me a minimum of 30,000 conversations based on the maximum occupancy of the place I worked and the number of shifts I worked per week!\n\nI was surprised to discover that developing these algorithmic scripts helped me a TON in conversations in my personal life, but even now I still get tripped up and my brain can’t find similar past examples to work with. (I am not forgetful. It’s just that conversations always have different variables!)\n\nWhen I was a child, it was pretty easy for me to get by because a) children are “allowed” to babble about nonsense or just not say anything at all and b) my parents were really strict and most of what I needed to say anyway was rote stuff like “please/thank you/yes ma’am/no ma’am.” But this started to become really hard for me around the time I turned 10, because people started expecting me to communicate in a really specific way that I struggled to understand. For example, as a teenager, I physically couldn’t speak to random people like librarians or baristas because no one could tell me WHAT to say to them. Like, okay, I need to ask the librarian if the library has a specific book, but how do I formulate that question? Do I need to introduce myself, since they’re a stranger? Or do I just go up to them and say “Do you have \\[book\\]?” Is that all I say, or is there more? And what if I’m interrupting them, and how would I know if I’m interrupting them? Which librarian do I ask, and where do I stand when I ask them? And so on. 👽😑\n\nAnd until I was like 23, I struggled to understand where people were getting their dialogue from. I thought that people got dialogue from books and movies and I couldn’t understand why people reacted weirdly when I used conversational lines from the things I read. Like, in high school, I used to try to navigate my way through small talk by racking my brain to remember scenes in books where people had had similar conversations, and then my classmates would look at me weirdly because people speak differently in real life than they do in like, 18th and 19th century literature and sci-fi. I know now that people are just able to generate this stuff spontaneously like I do when I’m explaining a set of facts, but it’s REALLY hard for me to come up with unique, appropriate reciprocal casual dialogue fast enough for social realtime.\n\nSo what I’m wondering is, is autism the best explanation for this kind of behavior? Or is there another possible explanation I should look into? (For what it’s worth, I don’t think it’s a linguistic issue. I always did really well on vocabulary/reading comprehension standardized testing and I’m multilingual. I just always feel like I need a phrasebook to consult when people try to talk to me!)\n\nfootnote: I have read like 50 research papers about autism in the past few weeks and recently learned that “casual, reciprocal conversations” are a thing that exists and also that “casual open-ended questions” are specifically something I still find highly challenging to answer. I’m 35 and I have spent my entire life being puzzled and bored and annoyed that people are constantly giving me lists of uncategorizable personal information. It turns out that’s literally just A Conversation!!! Even when I was developing those algorithms for my job, I didn’t know that “casual reciprocal conversations” were *the thing* I was trying to emulate. Likewise about casual open-ended questions. If someone asks me a question like, “What is algae?” I can immediately and easily talk about that for 4 hours straight. But if someone asks me “Did you do anything fun lately?” it’ll take me like 5 minutes to figure out how to answer that organically. I can only do it instantly if I use my algorithms.",

        "text": "Hi I'm very new to reddit (as in I literally just joined minutes ago) but I'm coming to this page for some advice/ to hear what you guys think because for the past year I've had the suspicion that I have autism. I know you shouldn't self diagnose but I'm using this as more of a tool to see if I should bring it up to my therapist or doctor. One reason I'm unsure is because I'm an empath but I've heard autistic people can also be empaths so yea.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, here are some of the symptoms I've compiled after taking some of the diagnostic tests from Embrace Autism:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I'm very sensitive to noise**: I get very anxious when there is a loud, high-pitched or sudden noise and it normally causes me to tic and I tend to cover my ears when I know there's going to be a loud noise so that doesn't happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I tend to copy the behaviors of other people**: When I talk to people I find interesting/ when I talk to friends one on one, I copy the hand gestures they use, their energy, and the way they talk (to a certain extent)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I don't have a specific routine but I do have an order for things** (specifically during the weekdays when I go to school).  Having said that, when there's been delays due to bad weather, power outages, etc., I get extremely anxious. The main things that go through my mind are \"did I miss the bus\", \"did I read the email wrong and there actually isn't a delay?\", and \"do i have all of my stuff\". This may just be anxiety but I felt it would be ok to mention it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**When I have anxiety attacks or I'm extremely anxious (mostly due to overstimulation) I get nonverbal.** With this, it's either incredibly hard for me to speak because I'm afraid I'll be more anxious, or I can't speak at all because of the same reason (or because I've shut down \\[which includes feeling out of it/ feeling like my body is a puppet that's just being taken around and I don't know whats going on, stimming, not really knowing what people are saying to me, and ofc, noise sensitivity\\])\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I stim when I'm excited, anxious, thinking, or looking for something.** When I'm excited I kind of do a mix of shaking and flapping my hands, and I bounce a little. When I'm any of the other things listed I touch all of my fingers to my thumbs in a specific way, and when I'm happy I tend to sway from side to side or wiggle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I can't focus well.** Even when writing this, I'm having to go back and read to make sure I'm making sense but in situations like a lecture or hearing multiple conversations between friends, it's really hard for me to keep up so I lose interest and stop trying to follow along (which has actually impacted my grades).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Finally (for now) I'm a little childish.** It may be because I use sfw little space as a coping mechanism, but I really like dinosaurs (I have a few little figurines), stuffed animals (I'm extremely attached to them and I get extremely anxious and upset \\[almost crying\\] when I can't find one \\[this has been the case since I was little\\], and bugs \\[which I also have toys of\\]. I also act kind of childlike when I'm trying to be funny. I use voices, I stick my tongue out, etc)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, sorry that was long. Thanks for reading (its cool if you didn't read all of it cause tbh I wouldn't either). I'm open to all interpretations whether you think it's autism or not. :)",

        "text": "About eight months ago, I stumbled across a video about Autism on my YouTube homepage. I didn't know anything about Autism at the time (just the generic stereotypes portrayed in tv and movies) so I decided to give it a watch. I found myself relating to everything the woman in the video was saying about her traits and life experiences. This video led me down a rabbit hole of information about Autism (and eventually ADHD). Every new piece of information I found shocked me. I had no idea that so many other people have had such similar experiences going all the way back to childhood. It felt like I finally had an answer to the questions I've had my entire life. Everything made sense- why I think the way I do, why I feel the way I do, why I do things the way I do... it was all right in front of me. I read the research, took the online tests, watched and read stories of other people with Autism and/or ADHD, stalked the Autism and ADHD subreddits, watched conferences, put together a highly organized binder containing my history, traits, test results and other relevant information and researched doctors and professional evaluations. Ultimately, I decided to take a step back because I couldn't afford to get an evaluation and my deep dive became all too consuming. I resolved to letting go for the time being and trying my best to become more observant and less judgmental of myself and how I move through life. After months of saving and gaining more clarity, I was finally able to book my evaluation last week. After setting up the appointment, I felt exhausted and relieved. There was a sense of peace knowing I would finally get some answers. Now, as I write, I am two days away from my evaluation and my anxiety is through the roof. I'm worried about everything. What if they don't take me seriously? What if they don't believe me? What if they think I'm lying/faking it? What if my masking tendencies alter my results? What if I accidentally miss my appointment? How am I going to make it through hours of talking about such intimate aspects of my life with a complete stranger? The list goes on and on. I think my real fear stems from feeling like I finally have an understanding of my life and now there is a possibility that the clarity I have could be taken away by someone that doesn't even know me. If you've been through or are currently going through this- how did you cope? And was the process as terrifying as I'm making it out to be?",

I asked her if my reading age was good and she said yes when i remember so clearly how much i struggled with reading and always had a low reading age to the point where teachers assumed i never read. I even remember a teacher telling my mum that she should read to me. I also had a teacher who took me out of class to help me read. I’m scared her opinion will influence the psychiatrist towards a diagnosis. They also mentioned that i should have someone ready to come with me to the assessment but i don’t have anyone to bring with me. I don’t know what to do, the family friend could fill out the questionnaire but she doesn’t know me well enough or at least hasn’t interacted with me or seen me enough to know about my struggles.

        "text": "Now i know that you can't diagnosed on reddit, or the internet for that matter, but i'm still not really sure if it's worth it to try and get diagnosed or something.   \n\n\nIm gonna list some of the reasons i think i could possibly have autism and/or adhd, and also the reasons i maybe don't   \n\n\nbare with me tho because my thoughts often lead into other thoughts, i often forget what im gonna say in the moment, i often repeat my thoughts without realizing, and i cant organize my thoughts very well. Also i dont really know how to use reddit so this post is gonna be messy.  \n\n\n# Reasons I might have Autism and/or ADHD\n\n* **I am extremely introverted.** I'd say the most social interaction i ever got was in like when i was in 3rd to 5th grade when i sort of had friends.  \nFor the most part i always remember being an extremely introverted person. I don't ever remember going out of my way to talk to people, ive always been extremely quiet, preferred doing things by myself, and have usually kept to myself. I know it's been especially apparent these last 2 years as ive basically just stayed in my room all day using my computer and either watching youtube, working on my music, talking to my friends on discord, drawing, or working on my tv show project (ill get more into this stuff later).  \nThis couldve possibly affect me but i dont feel particularly sadder, or depressed or anything. Im happy working on my music, and my project, and drawing. At most what i feel is longing for a close connection with a friend who also likes the things i do, and also it would definitely be good to go outside more often LMFAO  \n\n* **Im really bad at connecting with friends and making friends**  \nI guess this kinda relates to the last point, but ive always struggled making friends, or at the very least i don't remember it coming to me very easily. I don't even really connect very well with my family and relatives.  \nFrom 1st to 2nd grade i basically had no friends and never talked to anyone. My memoruy sucks really bad so i couldve missed some stuff but thats at the most what i could remember.   \nFrom 3rd to 5th grade i'd say i was more social but i dont really know why  \nDuring those years i guess you could say i had friends but i never really seemed particularly close or connected with them i dont know how to describe it. We mostly just talked to eachother because we all happened to be boys, and we all were grouped together for the most part. We didnt really have anything in common.  \nNo one really found me weird but no one seemed like they really wanted anything to do with me, like i kinda felt invisible. I always remember sitting by myself and drawing or something, and sometimes people would ask me about it but thats it.   \nI do remember having like 2 best friends somewhere in 4th and 5th grade (though i was more close with one of them), we talked alot and we often sat near eachother. I'd say thats one time i actually felt like i had a friend.  \nI also remember when i used to go to summer camp when i was in like 2nd grade i dont really remember. At that time my \"special interest\" (IDK if its right to say this because im not diagnosed) was pokemon. i specifically was interested in making my own fake pokemon. At that time in the summer camp everyone was in on pokemon cards and stuff, but it seemed that me and that one friend at the time were the ones who were EXTREMELY fixated on that.   \nWe were very close to eachother and he was basically the only thing that made me want to go there. We very often just talked about pokemon, and i very often also showed him the ones i made  which was fun. I have this fond memory of me, them, and these 2 other kids sitting at one table, and we kinda just talked and stuff and were having fun with eachother. It still makes me kind of sad to this day because i wish i had something like that again.  \nAfter 5th grade i basically was back to square one, similar to how i was in 1st grade. Keep in mind this was around 2019 so this was before the pandemic.  \nI pretty much had no friends again LMAO. I remember having like one kinda sort of friend, though it seemed one sided. I always initated conversation with them, it seemed they just didnt want to do anything with me and probably found me annoying and overtalkative and maybe even obsessive. It seems the only reason we were kinda friends was because he was into internet culture and stuff, and were in same class and sat next to eachother. Keep in mind this was the same school from 3rd grade. All the previous friends i had either didnt care about me anymore, or moved.  \n\n* **Stimming.** I very often, almost constantly stim. Chewing my cheeks, fiddling with objects, listening to one specific song to repeat that same daydream in my head, sitting a certain way to chew on my table, squirming in my chair, flashing lights in my eyes when i get the chance, rocking back and forth, talking outloud to myself, tapping my leg on the floor repeatedly, and probably alot more i forgot to name.   \nI know autism is typically associated with more \"disruptive\" stims, things like hand flapping, spinning, and verbal stims, and i very well could maybe be hiding these, but these are those that i do alot.  \n\n* **My interests are EXTREMELY obsessive, restricted, and i often tune out everything when i work on something i enjoy (hyperfocus?).**  \nNow this is one thing i know for sure i do and i've always done. My interests have always been extremely obsessive, and specific. It's like my entire life revolves around them, i can't stop thinking and talking about it, i lose sleep and struggle to sleep over it, i know an abnormally large amount of things about it, etc. I called them \"phases\" before i knew anything about autism and adhd and how i could possibly be autistic or have adhd.  \nI guess you could call these special interests maybe, as they often last 1 to 3 years for me, and i think hyperfixations are usually shorter but idk.  \nI'll list the ones ive had.  \n\n* FNAF: i think lasted for like a year in 2016\n* Pokemon (specifically making fake pokemon): lasted from like 2017 to 2018\n* Gravity Falls: this ones funny cause i never actually watched a single episode. I really obsessed with the 3 journals and tried to make my own, though i was also interested in the other stuff too. This lasted like either 1 to 2 years in 2016 and 2017.\n* The TV show project im working on, Wondermart Inc: late december 2021 to now. im basically just obsessed with this thing i made, ive looked at other people who created similar things, but it seems theyre not on the level with how much they talk about it, how much their life revolves around it, etc.  \nFor my hyperfixations (again idrk if im mixing up the 2 terms, if theyre the same, idk) i cant really remember much other then when i was obsessed with percussion instruments for like a month, specifically guitar for like 2 months, making discord bots for like a few months, and was obsessed with owning a synth for like a week, and then when i got it i never used it so i returned it.   \nRegarding hyperfocus i honestly relate with this. Often times when im working on something related to my special interest (i still dont know if it would be offensive or right for me to use this term) or making music i often just forget to eat, drink water, and then i tune out everything else in this extreme focus state. I will often not realize how long ive been doing it (usually hours), and so this does lead to some trouble.  \n\n* **I kind of suck socially.**   \nThis is one im still kinda figuring out (though its kinda like this in general for autism and adhd and stuf). Ill just list the social issues i have that could possibly be related to autism.  \n\n* I'm really bad at explaining things in words. I'm not even really sure how to describe this, but its like it makes sense in my head but i just dont know how to put alot of things into words, and often times ill just get confused and forgot about what i was saying.  \n   \nI remember i tried to say something about the food my mom cooked and how it kinda smelled funny. At that time i didnt think it was rude, but i told her, and it seemed she took offense to it. I tried my best to explain it and how i didnt mean it in a rude way but i just made the situation worse, and then felt like shit.  \n\n* I overshare about things. This mostly has to do with my special interests, but its like i cant stop talking about it when i do start and i wont realize if the other person actually cares or if i am talking to much. Ill also often just say every detail that comes to mind and then the entire thing im saying just becomes a mess.  \n\n* I cant control my tone of voice. This mostly happens when im angry, but happens in other things too. Often times ill say something, and it'll come out different than how i intended it to sound, or i will say something mean, regret it later, and then ill have a whole talk over it, or sometimes ill say something and think to myself that it maybe sounded kinda sad, or rude idk.  \n\n* It's very hard for me to follow instructions and following stuff, like i'll need to focus on it fairly well in order for me to understand, and ill often just forget it. I remember when i was trying to make something in the microwave, and i asked my brother for what buttons i need to press, and how long to set it for, and i mostly forgot it, and so i asked him again and said something along the lines of \"I literally just told you how did you forget\".  \n\n* Im not sure if this is a social issue, but my posture is really bad. My mom has told me about it before multiple times.  \n\n* This kind of relates to following instructions but its hard for me to keep up with conservation, especially with 2 or more people.  \n\n* I kinda do, kinda dont understand some metaphors, unless ive heard them like a million times. I know commonly used ones but theres alot that just dont make any sense. I don't really know much about this though cause the people i do talk to, mainly my family, dont really use metaphors. Even when i do understand the metaphor though, it usually takes me a bit to figure out what it actually means, and i usually just use context to understand.  \n\n* Echolalia. I don't really know much about this but ill explain the best i can.   \nAt most the only things that relate to this for me is that i used to kind of used words and not really actually know what they mean, and i just kinda used them because i either thought i knew what they meant, or because everyoen else did.   \nI also often say my thoughts outloud, though this is only by myself as im kind of embarassed of doing it in front of someone.  \nI only recall doing this when i was really young, but i used to kinda do things cartoons did? This probably doesnt really fit and i just dont know to describe it so this was probably redundant.  \n\n* Im really bad at consulting and comforting people. I'll sometimes feel empathy towards them, but i just dont know how to comfort them and im afraid of saying something stupid and not realizing it, or ill overthink wether it was rude or not, and so ill just not bother with it 90 percent of the time  \n\n* Ill sometimes just not make eye contact with the person i am talking to. I would say this isnt hard with close people like my family, but im not still not really sure about this because with how my life is i dont really talk to people often.  \n\n* I dont really know when i should speak during a conservation. My memory is terrible so i dont really know if this is a huge problem but i do have some memories of me just talking over people because i didnt know when to speak, and couldnt hold it in.  \n\n* Texting is often easier for me because i can think out what im gonna say a while before hand, and probably some other reasons i forgot.  \n\n* **My cousin has autism.** I'm not sure if this has to do with anything, but ive heard there is a higher chance of ADHD, and Autism if a family member or relative has it.  \n\n* **My executive function is really bad.** Now this is something i only remember encountering lately, but i feel this couldve also possibly been happening all my life. I also until recently realized this also common in autism so yeah.  \nI dont really know how you describe executive function. Even when its things i enjoy i alot of the time just cant get myself to start it. I remember trying to work on a script for something related to my special interest and i just couldnt get myself to work on it that day even though i wanted to. it didnt help that i just couldnt focus on it either.  \nI wouldnt call it procrastination as im pretty sure thats deliberate. Its like i intend to do it at this very moment but just cant, and that often that executive function turns into procrastination where i just tell myself ill do it later and still worrying about it.  \nThis could also be possibly related but i do have memories of me always starting things and never finishing them. I have so many sketchbooks that i drew in for a few days, and then just stopped. This could also possibly be due to ADHD and its love for novelty but ill get into that later.   \nI'll also often have trouble transition between tasks, and this is especially apparent for things like schoolwork.  \n\n* **It's hard for me focus, and i'll often get sidetracked, even on the things i enjoy.** Pretty self explanatory lol.  \n\n* **My memory is really bad.** This could be due to ADHD, my kinda poor sleep schedule, my bad diet, or just unlucky genetics, but idk xd.  \n\n* **My sensory issues are kind of weird, and i dont think ive ever experiended sensory overload, or meltdowns, but IDK?** At most the only sensory issues i've had are that-  \n\n* my skin is often pretty clammy, and so its really uncomfortable when people touch me when it is.\n* my neck doesnt like being touched, and its also kinda uncomfortable when people touch my hair.\n* i remember smelling this ginger flavor tuna, and it smelled awful. It wasn't bad or anything because i ate some of it and didnt get sick, but i just couldnt get over the smell after a few bites, and the smell made my head hurt.\n* I remember when i was a kid i was given this bubblegum liquid medicine, and i just threw it up all over the place cause i couldnt handle the taste.\n* When i was sick i had to also drink this liquid drink thats supposed to be for electrolytes and stuff. The smell was fine, but the taste was weird and salty and just too much, and i had to leave it in the fridge for a while to get cold so the taste wouldnt be as powerful. I never finished the drink.\n* Food seems to be really stimulating for me.\n* I dont really know if this counts as \"sensory overload\", and this is the only time ive ever experienced something like it, but i remember when i was eating fast food, trying to wrap my head around something related to my special interest, looking at my computer, and listening to music, and for some reason i just started crying. I didnt know why all i knew is i was overwhelmed.  \nI also know it's a common experience among people who both have Autism and ADHD (at least i think) that when taking adhd meds, their ADHD symptoms go away, but their Autism starts to show up more, examples being sensory issues. I don't really know if this is actually true, but ive heard, and it could possibly relate to this.\n\n# Im now gonna list the reasons why i also probably don't have them both.\n\n* **My sensory issues aren't really that bad?** Liked i listed earlier, it doesn't really seem like my sensory issues are that bad. It could be because i'm not in an environment where that is gonna be a big issues but i dont  really know.  \n\n* **My social issues aren't that bad IDK?** I don't even know if im normal anymore or if im just weird but yeah.  \n\n* **Maybe it's just my bad choices?** I feel diet, sleep, and other stuff could affect me but i really don't know if it's that bad or if it is even affecting me.   \n\n* **I don't really have a rigid routine.** I maybe could possibly have routines and just not realize it, but, i dont think ive ever gotten very anxious about changes in my routine. I also could maybe be confusing routine and schedule, so if i am someone please explain.  \nIn all, i don't really know if this is normal, if i'm just overthinking, faking it, trying to be special, etc. I mostly just want some help to know if it is worth it get a diagnosis or research further about this. I'm still fairly new to this stuff as ive only considered if i have Autism for maybe like a month now, and been kinda fixating on it during that time. I could very well be forgetting alot of things here, and, i haven't taken my experiences into consideration for autism until very recently so im still learning xd.",

One of the crucial parts of finding out if you may have autism is your behavior in childhood, and I can't remember jack. I have crumbs of memory, but that's about it. Just around when the pandemic started school started becoming overwhelming for me, and when we had to stay home I never went back to school. My whole family was nagging and yelling at me to go and I started to become stressed and depressed because I felt pressured by everyone, and I started noticing my autistic behavior like repetitiveness, and small rituals ). I'm thinking I actually developed OCD or it's just my ADHD or dyslexia acting up, but I've had social skills and nonverbal communication problems my whole life. I remember I had repetitive behavior as a child, but I don't think I have sensory problems, besides when I would cover my ears in fear from trains. Im also sensitive to heat and itch when hot, and jump from small sounds but nothing else I don't think. Anyways, do any of you deal with bad memory?",

I notice something that could be a symptom, suspicion rises up, I start thinking about it  almost constantly subconsciously\n\n2. I realize what I'm thinking and scold myself for even thinking that, then decide to go to trustworthy sources and registers of past behaviour to prove to myself that there is no way this is possible so I will shut up about it\n\n3. I end up finding even more evidence that it fits, freak out thinking it might actually be true and I was always right, start gathering information to backup my suspicion and making plans to get a diagnosis without having people around me know about it\n\n4. I realize I'm so deep into this that the concept of autism and what it truly involves could have started to lose meaning, pull myself back to reality and insist it is in no way possible, drown in shame and mentally kick myself anytime I have suspicions again almost like they are intrusive thoughts until I forget about it, and once I do it's just for a period of time and then back to 1.\n\nMy question is; does anyone else experience or has experienced something like this before a diagnosis? Is it a common manifestation of denial and imposter syndrome, or am I actually being stubborn and overfocused on something that I already know is not possible and just don't want to let go?\n\nFor the record, most of the guilt comes from an awareness of how severely disabling autism truly is and how my symptoms would be far too mild to be relevant, even if I was right. And yet, results in nearly every test I could take from my position pass the threshold and everytime I find more things that I thought could even contradict a diagnosis they turn out to possibly be a part of it (vivid imagination, overwhelming empathy etc.)",

I'm so broke. I have so much credit card debt. I had a meltdown this morning and my son got scared because I slammed a door at the other end of the house. I feel like garbage. Literally trash that someone needs to dispose of. :(\n\nI'm not looking for sympathy y'all. I just like talking to you all because I feel like I can be honest.  If you made it this far, thanks for reading.",

        "text": "For context I am 36(F) who was diagnosed officially about a year ago (thank you to this site for all the support). Things have improved a lot with finally being able to understand myself and my struggles. One thing I am struggling to understand though, is that I am struggling doing things by myself that I could manage before.\n\nI have spoken somewhat with my husband about it, and he feels that because I am now aware of myself more, it makes it harder for me to \"suffer\" through experiences because I understand the negative impact it has on me. Is this something other late diagnosis can relate to?\n\nI feel like it is a case of i did a lot of things before simply because I had to, particularly when i was on my own, I functioned, because I had to. I would shut down a lot more often, so I recognize that these things took a toll but now because I feel safe and supported, its a struggle to push past the anxiety and functional issues.\n\nAn example would be before I was diagnosed, I used to go to the petrol station, fill up my car, and drive to work by myself. Now, I feel a lot of anxiety doing any activity on my own and I will avoid activities and tasks a lot more to the point driving anywhere on my own feels very overwhelming. The idea of filling my car makes me feel very overwhelmed. It feels so silly. I could do it before but now it will be i just wont drive until my husband can come with me and he can fill the car up. So many things now I just avoid so I can have someone else do them or be there with me. \n\nDo I push through this? do I put myself in situations that cause me stress and anxiety to prevent myself from becoming overly reliant on other people looking after me? It feels like I take advantage because I can do things but its such a powerful \"I dont want to\" feeling. I feel like my world has become more restricted because im not pushing myself out of my comfort zone but I also feel better day to day because I am getting a good routine and I meltdown a lot less. The price of that though is I am offloading onto other people. I have had some guidance from my Dr who says I should bring stress levels down as much as possible and a small world works for me and that is ok and its ok to need help but I did these things before, so I can do them, i just....dont. \n\nI suppose what I am asking is if this is something other people have gone through, particularly those who were diagnosed later in life, that you kind of just sink into a phase of avoidance, and if i should be working to expand my routine and activities? Is it part of unmaksing to get worse?",

        "text": "I just don’t get how people make friends.  Most people seem to make friends so effortlessly.  For me it’s always been a struggle.\n\nI think I do well socially in certain contexts.  I can make small talk with the cashier in the grocery store when I want to.  I interact well enough at work.  I struck up a short conversation with a guy in line in front of me at a concert recently.  But those are all shallow superficial interactions.  I just don’t get how to make deep meaningful friendships with other people, to connect as equals where both of us are there by choice, and not because business or circumstance put us there.\n\nI try to make friends.  I try to stay in touch with the few people I’m close to, but it seems like I’m the only one that makes the effort, and if I stop communicating I never hear from them again.  I guess that means we were never really friends to begin with.\n\nI hear about people re-connecting with people they knew in high school.  No one I went to school with has ever tried to re-connect with me.  I thought I had friends in high school.  But even though we got along pretty well, the only time I ever saw them was at school, so I guess maybe they weren’t really friends after all.\n\nI made the same mistake in college, thinking that my roommates were my friends when in reality they weren’t. I tried to connect with an old college roommate on LinkedIn a few months ago.  He and I were fairly close I thought, since we used to talk every night and we’d hang out almost every weekend.   I never heard back from him.\n\nI’m in an online men’s group.  I guess you could call it a self-improvement group because we focus on things like fitness, health, nutrition, finances, being better fathers and husbands, etc. Most of our interactions are over discord, but we have weekly video chats, and we’ve even had a few in-person meetups over the years.  It seems like a great group for an autistic person because our conversations are mostly about meaningful topics and not shallow superficial ones (there’s almost no talk of sports unless it’s from guys that are actually playing them).  I've had more social interaction with these guys in two years than I've had with everyone else (except my wife) in my entire adult life, but I still struggle to interact with them sometimes.\n\nLast month about 20 of us got together in person over the weekend.  I think I did pretty well.  It caused some anxiety, but I pushed myself to be social and I had some good one-on-one conversations.  But there were a few times when I was talking to someone and then I noticed that they were doing most of the talking and I didn’t have very much to add to the topic.  I enjoyed listening to them, but then they stopped talking and after an awkward silence when I couldn't continue the conversation, they excused themselves and went to talk to someone else.\n\nI consider all these men my friends.  Except I’m not sure how many of them consider me a friend.  And even if some of them do, we’re not very close friends.  Recently one of them posted that he talks on the phone with different guys from the group a few times a week.  Other people replied that they do the same thing.  A few of them said something like “me and so and so talk at least three times a week on the phone”.\n\nHow the hell do NTs do that?  I just don’t understand how some of these guys are like best friends, when I struggle so much to accomplish the same thing.  And it’s not that I haven’t tried.  I’ve talked to some of them on the phone (usually when I posted about something I was struggling with and one of them offered to help), but I’ve never developed the relationships that some of them have.  A few times I’ve reached out to different people, asking if we could talk on the phone, and the reply was something like “sure, I might have some time this week”, but then they were busy and after my second failed attempt at trying to schedule a good time to talk I just gave up and I never heard anything more about it.\n\nI’m not good at talking on the phone.  I get really nervous and I pace around the whole time.  I never know when to end the conversation either.  I just don’t get how people know when it’s time to say goodbye and hang up.  I’ll often be talking to someone and I’ll get this feeling like it’s time to hang up before I talk their ear off, so I’ll try to wrap things up, but apparently I’m wrong and they wanted to keep talking and they continue.  But then other times I’ll be talking to someone and I apparently missed the cue that the conversation was over because I'll notice all of a sudden that they're trying very hard to politely get rid of me.\n\nThe other day I was talking to someone in person, and I started to tell this story that I thought was relevant to the situation.  Halfway through the story I could tell the guy didn’t want to be there.  He wasn’t rude, but I knew from his body language that he wasn’t interested in the story I was telling.  I didn’t want to just stop my story halfway though because that would have been awkward, so I uncomfortably tried to wrap things up as fast as I could so I could leave.  I keep going back over that conversation in my mind, and I just can’t figure out what I did that was wrong.\n\nI’ve tried to understand people.  I’ve tried to reverse-engineer how they think and come up with a list of rules to understand how they behave.  Except that doesn’t always work.  People aren’t logical, they’re not rational.  It’s not like a computer where I give it an instruction and I can expect a certain result.  I think I understand, and then I encounter a situation where my rules break down and I don’t know why someone did what they did or said what they said.\n\nAnd sometimes my rules get in the way, because even when I know the rules for conversing with someone, I can't consciously follow those rules and pay attention to the conversation at the same time.  I know it's polite to ask follow up questions or to share similar experiences, but I still manage to screw that up.  I'm so busy trying to figure out how to respond and what to say when it's my turn to talk that I can't focus on what they're saying and sometimes people notice my lack of attention.\n\nI understand when ND people say they feel like they’re from another planet.  I’ve always been a loner, and I’ve often felt like an outcast.  I want to understand people, but I just don’t.  I want friends, but I’ve never really had them.  I wish talking to people wasn't so difficult.",

        "text": "There are certain things that have been core to my personhood since I was very young and now I'm wondering if those things could be related to autism. \nFor example, I've always been very very good at mimicry: mimicking sounds, words, pronunciation, posture. A weird one is that I tend to pick up people's laughs? If I'm around someone long enough, I will pick up their laugh and even facial expressions and speech patterns. Some I keep and some I don't. \n\nAnother is that I have an almost irritatingly good sense of balance. I can tell if like weight is uneven: for example, I will adjust my backpack straps like 5 or 6 times until the weight feels even. I like to eat in even numbers and will split something (like m&amp;m's) down the middle, if I have an uneven number. Eating m&amp;m's is almost annoying, because I have to find the 'm' on every single one and rotate it to be facing me...anyways I'm rambling now. Interested in what people think about these.",

        "text": "I hear constantly from men I date that I am so cold hearted and don’t care about their feelings. \nIt confuses me bc one of my autism traits is over-empathy. (This is common in autistic women specifically so don’t come at me and say I can’t have autism and be overly-empathetic.. so tired of hearing that, I’m officially diagnosed with multiple professional opinions). I don’t often know if I’m actually being mean or insensitive or if I’m just being gas-lit. \nExample: a guy I dated for a long time had really bad depression, would tell me he found a gun and was going to kill himself, then turn his phone off. I had to leave work multiple times to check on him. When I finally told him I couldn’t take it anymore, it was really stressful, he quit telling me anything about how he felt. When I asked why, he said it was bc he was scared of me and how mean I am about his depression. We broke up for that reason and then he kept texting me at 4am to tell me he always knew he loved me more than I did him, and I finally snapped. Told him that he was being ridiculous/immature. He then told all our friends I was horrible to him and used him, etc. \n\nExample 2: started a FWB with a guy I knew from school. He agreed to FWB but would ask me every week if I had made a decision about dating yet. I said multiple times that I did not want a relationship, and that if he couldn’t do a FWB that’s fine and he just needs to stop. I was the one that stopped it, and we were still friends. He wants to text me all the time tho, and if I don’t respond after 1hr then he starts freaking out thinking I died. I can’t take a nap, work, or be with my kid without checking my phone. I’ve had a couple “nice” talks about boundaries and not having “girlfriend” expectations and he just doesn’t get it. I finally told him to calm the fuck down, that none of my friends expect me to text that much, and it’s really stressing me out. He said that I was so hurtful bc I’m acting like he just wants attention when really he just cares about me so much. Said that I’m a cold hearted witch for not seeing how much he cares. \n\nI feel like I’m not being cold-hearted, just setting boundaries. The thing is… something like this happens with practically every man I try to date and it makes me wonder if I really just am really mean. I’ve been dating for 20yrs and hear the same thing over and over, that I’m a horrible person. Am I mean? Or do NT people just not have the same need for boundaries? Or are these dudes just asshats? Logically, I can’t excuse that I’m the common denominator in all these failed relationships, so it seems like it *should* be my fault.",

I didn't know I was autistic until I was 25 and even then I didn't understand what that meant exactly. So I suffered with all these things as a child and teenager and was called sensitive and treated like a freak. My mental health was not taken seriously by my parents, school guidance counselor, or teacher who I tried to talk to. I learned all the wrong social skills as a child and had to relearn things as an adult.\n\nSometimes I have meltdowns and panic attacks and react very poorly. I have lashed out at others and called them bad names. This doesn't happen in real life as much anymore, it happens more online in video games. People trigger me because they interpret my actions incorrectly and insult me. Those insults trigger a meltdown and panic attack. I'm not used to socializing with people like that. I don't want to avoid playing video games with others, I want to learn how to manage my emotions and reactions better.\n\nHow can I know if my reactions - my meltdowns and panic attacks are my fault? I think name calling is bad so I guess that's my fault, but is what triggered my reaction my fault? I don't know. I don't understand. I don't know that I can help getting overwhelmed by certain things. I try not to get overwhelmed, but my anxiety just keeps getting worse. If people would just be nice I wouldn't get upset. If people would talk to me privately about things I do that upset them, then I wouldn't get upset. There's no need to call me out in front of everyone. I'm willing to work things out with others, but privately. I know I annoy others with my anxiety. I wish they would message me privately to talk about it and not insult me openly. I suppose that's an unrealistic view. I don't know.\n\nI don't have money to go to a doctor or therapist.",

        "text": "I recently realized I'm probably autistic / aspie, and I'm looking for some help re-contextualizing some recent mental health struggles in light of this. Essentially I've been feeling like I'm \"loosing functionality\" and I'm wondering if there's an autism-related reason for this.\n\nI had a lot of (miss)-behavioral issues growing up and into my early adulthood, which landed me in 12 step groups and rehab by the age of 20. Therapy helped put me on a better path, and from maybe 22-28 I got a degree, got a good career that I'm good AT, was impressing my bosses and doing well at work, etc. etc.  I had goals, I managed my time well, and was pretty outgoing and confident. But after a few years on the job that started to slow a bit. My social life slowed down a lot b/c of moving and aging. There were some shifts in my company that caused me to move around quite a bit at work for a period of 2-3 years, which left me feeling like I'd \"lost my footing\" so to speak. (I'm a programmer so moving around = learning new systems over and over again.) \n\nI started getting overwhelmed when I would go out to parties or large work functions. I'd been diagnosed with social anxiety &amp; depression in Highschool, and went in to get re-diagnosed after more than a decade off the meds.  The anxiety/depression spiked during covid when I felt like I was basically alone at my desk in my apartment all day everyday, and with that came a \"loss of function\" I've not really felt before. With the shift to WFH I started wasting more time at work, reading more politics, paying less attention, remembering less, and my brain just started to get \"foggy.\" I may have felt this way at times way back in K-12, but I've felt very \"functional\" for most of my adult life. \n\nIt's gotten a little better post covid, but I still struggle with basic executive function to a level I didn't earlier in my career (from maybe 25-30). Is it possible to \"develop ADHD\" late in life? Am I getting bored? Did covid unmask a lot of folks? Just looking for any experiences / recommendations / tidbits that may help contextualize this.

Sorry for the length, I struggle immensely with brevity and understanding which details are unnecessary to others because I personally want every detail. \n\nSo I’m 31F, and I’ve finally admitted to myself that I may be Autistic. It was never on my radar, as ASD is far more broad than I could have ever imagined. In the end, if I’m not diagnosed I feel thankful I now understand an ignored community that much better. A community I feel connected to.\n\nEssentially, I’m working with a therapist. I am very new to this. We do talk therapy and are working our way towards an official assessment.\n\nMy therapist says it’s difficult to diagnose adults because they mask, or because other disorders/symptoms overlap in ways non-professionals struggle to understand the nuance of. And Trauma can obscure diagnosis. Essentially, it’s more than just matching up traits to a list and the struggles I experience, or the behaviors I display. She is kind, and is eager to help me get the most accurate diagnosis possible so that we can address my struggles in the best way possible. Keep in mind I paraphrase what she’s told me, so don’t be too critical. \n\nMy parents love me, but either don’t remember much about my early years or have a default need to insist I was normal. They are the type to ignore mental health realities if it’s uncomfortable. \n\nI have an amazing memory, so it’s the only thing that’s helping us since my parents can’t provide too much information. (I know memory is not a play-back tape, but mine seems to be especially reliable and it amazes my family the details I remember and the sheer quantity of memories I’ve retained.)\n\nThis is where I’d like to ask for your experiences and thoughts regarding changes *specifically* from developmental stages and into early childhood/adolescence. What was your experience as you transitioned from home to school? Or what would  your parents say about it? \n\nCan one be an outgoing, talkative, and “happy” child who seemed normal to parents until around school age? Is it possible that everyone can miss signs of Autism early and then just label you as shy once you begin school? Did you withdraw? When did you notice you weren’t like the other kids? What difficulties did you face? Did you hit all the normal milestones because you were intelligent?Did you struggle to communicate those difficulties or simply assume everyone struggled in the same way, only handled it better? What experiences can you share that demonstrate you were Autistic rather than just suffering from extreme anxiety or social withdraw due to negative experiences? \n\nThis already too long, so if it makes sense, I’ll reply to your comments with my experiences. \n\nThank you in advance for sharing and for helping me further distinguish between signs of Autism and “something else.” ❤️",

They will share things about their current hyperfixation with me abundantly but it's a real struggle to have a conversation about anything else.  \nHowever, I will say that when I was upset recently about a big life event, they were there for me and very supportive.\n\nI have talked to them about it a couple of times, and I can see they are trying to make an effort by including me in their current interests. Both times I've bought it up, they kept trying to steer the conversation back to their current interest.\n\nI'm feeling disconnected from them because I feel like they aren't interested in me but they insist they are. I feel rejected when they don't acknowledge things I say. It's not good for the relationship to be one sided where we only really talk about things they want to talk about?\n\nThey don't really ask me questions about my life, or even \"how are you, how was your day\" and they are often resistant to open up when I ask stuff like that. We used to have big deep conversations and talk for hours and hours so it hasn't always been like this.  \n\n\nI said to them that this is getting too hard for me, and we need to find a solution that works for us both or I don't think we can continue.",

Or maybe its just unusual actually being able to communicate / express myself which feels odd and to be honest , amazing 😂. \nThe worst thing is , is I feel like drunk me is probably the real me, the me that I can’t access once sober (sounds sad I know).\nDoes anyone here have what they would say is a healthy relationship with alcohol?",

Make sure to think about your answer and then read what I'd do (don't worry, it's not a difficult problem or anything like that).\n\nLet's suppose your teacher asks you to write three different recipes. For each recipe you have to add a title (which includes the name of the dish and its country of origin) and a set of steps that detail how the dish is prepared. Now, the teacher says you only have about 10-15 minutes to complete this activity (so, limited time), how would you go about solving it? Think about it and then read below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat I'd obviously do is: write recipe title #1, write steps for #1, write recipe title #2, write steps for #2, write recipe title #3, write steps for #3. That, in my mind, is the obvious and most logical answer. You are completing one at a time. If you run out of time, you can at least hand in one or many two of the receipts.\n\nNow, I was doing this in a group and their way of going about it was chaotic. First, they came up with ALL the receipt titles. The teacher had asked for three but they, for some unknown reason, decided to write four. Once they had the titles, they picked one and starting writing the steps. While doing this, they realized the steps for one of the other recipes were similar, so they started writing those (without finishing the steps of the one they were working with originally). Then, they left it there and grabbed yet another recipe and started writing that. And it went like this for the remainder of the activity. They were basically working on four receipts at the same time. They kept forgetting what they'd written so each time they resumed a receipt they had to re read it. When the 15 minutes were up, we obviously had no receipt fully completed. We had four half way done. I was going insane because no input I'd offered had been taken into account and now we didn't have anything to present. I, obviously, took all of them and finished them myself. I showed them to everyone on my team and they congratulated me. Then, a guy takes them and he presents them. That's a side note and we are a team but I'm still salty about it.\n\nAnyway, my way of doing it seems obviously better. And to me it is the obvious choice when solving these type of problems. I was shocked when they started working on all of them at the same time and no one said otherwise. \n\nPlease tell me below how you would have solved this, like me or like them? Am I in the wrong here? Does this even have to do with autism?\n\nNote: the thing we were doing wasn't writing recipes, obviously lol, I just simplified it for the sake of Reddit but it was the same idea (title + set of instructions)",

But today I found out that a lot of gifted kids are misdiagnosed with asd and as I'm looking at the \"symptoms\" of giftedness I'm just having a bunch of \"oh\" moments like I was when I started learning about autism. Turns out subclinical level autism is super common among gifted kids. So like does anyone know how to differentiate between gifted w/o autism and gifted w/ (subclinical) autism?\n\nThe second question, since I know I was inevitably gonna end up posting about this anyway:\n\nWould I be considered autistic if I meet all of the dsm v diagnostic criteria for autism except the one that requires my symptoms to cause clinically significant impairment in functioning (regardless of whether I'm \"gifted\" or not)? or, to put it in simplest terms, are you considered autistic if you have subclinical autism?",

I also agree on that.\n\nBut I can't help but think that I might really be autistic. The psychiatrist that diagnosed me doesn't agree, he diagnosed me with AvPD and ADHD only (I agree with both diagnoses) and said that there's little evidence to support an autism diagnosis other than my social difficulties. The therapist I'm currently seeing also looks at things from a non-autistic perspective, so the treatment I'm having for AvPD right now I feel like doesn't really match me.\n\nI'm literally one text away from asking my dad what type of \"genetic\" is it with my social difficulties. This would change the whole game for me, as my parents heavily stigmatize mental health. I know my dad has ADHD, but I suspect that my mom has autism. Either way, I don't know -- I mightve gotten tested when I was young or something.\n\n....... i feel scared, but I want to know the truth.

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\n**I’m recruiting autistic women and girls aged 12-24 to participate in my dissertation study on body image and eating behaviours in autistic and non-autistic women**\n\n###Who:     \nAutistic women and girls aged 12-24 who can read and write English and are not currently in treatment for an eating disorder.\n    \n*Girls aged 12-15 will require a parent/caregiver to provide consent to participate along with some additional background information.*    \n\n###What:     \nYou will be asked to complete an online questionnaire that asks about your body image, eating habits, and weight control behaviours. The questionnaire takes approximately 25-45 minutes (and will save your progress so you can take a break and return later).    \n\nAs compensation for your time, you will receive an online gift card for ten dollars (Canadian) after you have completed the survey.    \n\n###How:     \nSend an email *with your age* to bodyimage.enhancelab@ucalgary.ca or DM me here and I will send you the link to access the survey.    \n\n###Why:     \nAutistic women and girls experience higher rates of eating disorders and disordered eating than their non-autistic peers. Body image (how someone thinks and feels about their body) plays an important role in eating disorders, but no research has examined how autistic people experience body image. We hope that by better understanding the autistic experience of body image and eating disorders, we can help improve eating disorder treatments for autistic people.    \n\n\n* This research has been approved by the University of Calgary Conjoint Faculties Research Ethics Board (REB20-0190)*\n\n\nThank you so much for considering.",

But I'm looking at many of these autistic traits, and I think, \"Well, I don't do that.\"\n\nI just noticed myself rocking back and forth after sitting in up in bed while thinking about something stressful. I noticed it and thought it was odd, that I must be doing that because I've been thinking about autism so much lately. I never noticed myself doing it, but it felt natural.\n\nSo I asked my wife, \"Do you ever noticing me rocking back and forth?\"\n\n\"All the time.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Yeah, you haven't noticed that?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Why is it such a surprise to you that you're autistic? You have many autistic traits. I've known you were on the spectrum for a while.\"\n\nI keep finding the same things. I read something, dismiss it. I don't really stim. I do pace back and forth when I'm thinking, often for hours when I'm really into something. \"But that doesn't mean anything.\"\n\nThen I noticed myself tapping my fingers and kicking the table over and over yesterday. I noticed that nobody else was doing anything like that. I realized that I am actually stimming, constantly.\n\nIt seems like with so many of these traits, I initially dismiss them. And then one or two instances of something will occur to me. And then that turns into 20. Then there's this holy shit moment when I realize that it's all the time, and with traits in many different areas.",

It never really occurred to me to that this was an abnormal trait, but now that I've been considering the possibility that I have autistic traits, I've been making an inventory of seemingly abnormal traits. I'm not sure this is even one of them. Maybe everyone thinks love songs are weird, and it just takes an unusually open person to want to write or perform one. But then again, they're a staple in most music styles, so that seems unlikely.\n\nI'm not even sure I have alexithemia. But I think it's possible that I don't feel affection in the same way others do. I think that I maybe feel fascination or obsession, but I'm not sure how my internal states align with the internal states of others.",

It took a tole on my social meter for the day, then we come home and the youngest doesn’t nap, my partner decides to do laundry all day, and both kids are doing acrobatics off me like I’m a jungle gym. \n\nI’m now hiding in the bathroom just trying to have a moment alone while the youngest screams and bangs on the door and my partner is obliviously watching his iPad. I just need to not be touched and have a moment of no one talking to me or needing me.",

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI was wondering if anyone else has trouble with rhetorical questions and/or has any advice on how to respond to them.\n\nFor context, when when my wife is upset about something someone said she will often ask things like, \"How am I supposed to take this [offensive statement]?\", or \"What else could this person have meant?\". Sometimes she is looking for actual answers, but usually she wants me to comfort her by validating her interpretation of the exchange. I often have a hard time figuring out which it is.\nEven when I do realize that she wants validation, I don't know how to respond. Usually I just end up saying \"I don't know.\" or suggesting alternative, more benign, explanations in an effort to help. Unfortunatley, they former is usually unhelpful and the later is often interpreted as taking the other person's side.\n\nI really want to be able to help her feel better, but keep stumbling on this. Has anyone here had similar problems?\n\n(My apologies if this is not the right place to ask.)",

        "text": "I may be autistic and my parents just brushed it off…. I was born with a speech delay, and due to that I was placed in speech therapy for a while. I remember going to a speech therapy program in elementary school, and I remember being confused of why I had to be pulled out of my regular class 3 times a week for speech therapy, but I never question it. My parents always told me I never smiled or showed emotions (I still don’t) which caused problems growing up especially once I got older with jobs. I always got complains by customers saying that I was rude and managers asking can I least give a smile to customers which doesn’t help either that I was a very straight monotone voice. Also in elementary I had 4 teachers in the classroom, while the other classes in my grade only had 1. There were at least 3 kids that had a disability but highly functional in my classroom, which why I understand why they needed more teachers. But why was I placed in that classroom? I was no longer in speech therapy but once I got to middle school my reading score was always lower than an average student so I got taken out again from my regular reading class for extra help but only once on a while. Once I got to high school I no longer needed extra help but I did develop anxiety, eating disorder, and depression with suicidal thoughts which all still effects me today. I’m currently not working and haven’t in the past 3 years, I did get a job a few months ago but it only lasted 2 weeks because I quit. I’m a college student and focusing on my grades but that can even be a struggle. I recently asked my parents if I may be on the spectrum and if they ever took my to be diagnosed and they said “no there’s because there’s nothing wrong with you” my parents  are very old school so it’s very difficult to talk to them about this type of stuff.",

        "text": "Im not officially diagnosed, but special interests is amongst others is a trait I have that a lot of people in the community share so it seems like the right place to ask  this.\n\nHow it works for me usually is that I develop a very intense interest for something for a few years, until eventually it dies down and gets replaced by something else, and sometimes there’s shorter interests in the in-between periods. My last interest was a specific DnD campaign I was in. Unfortunately because of reasons out of my control I can’t engage in that anymore. It was very difficult for me, but it’s been a few months and I’ve managed to move on. I know intellectually that it was for the best, because there was a lot of schedule changes and sessions being canceled, which was extremely upsetting, but I miss having something I really care about. \nMy previous interests were mostly on specific movies or movie franchises. I would learn about the lore, rewatch them etc. but the key thing I think was that I would latch on to a specific character. When i started playing DND it was like taking all of those elements from movies that I liked but also making it more immersive and personal. I think in the beginning of it it was actually really good for me, I bonded more with the people I was playing with, and it helped me to consider some things more in real life, like feelings and the motivations behind peoples actions. People have suggested that I try joining another campaign, and I’ve done that, but it’s not the same. I’m not as comfortable with other groups, so it I’m pretty anxious most of the time and it’s more difficult to get invested. I still enjoy them, especially the character creation process, doing concept art etc. but it’s definitely not the same. It just feels like that campaign was ideal for me, and I don’t think anything can top it or cater to what I like in such a specific way ever again. (I guess when I say I’m over it I mean that I don’t have a mental breakdown every time I think about it, I still feel sad about it but it’s more of a sense of emptiness that is less intense now and I don’t think about it as much now)\nI’ve tried other stuff other than dnd and sometimes it seems like something might stick, but nothing has yet. I’ve gotten to the point where I can get excited about things again, but it’s not consistent, and the interest doesn’t last more than a week or two. It just feels so weird being in this space and I feel like having a thing would help me fully get over the previous one.\n\nIf anyone else has experienced something similar or has any advise please help.",

Why is it so hard for us to accept the possibility that we're autistic even when there's a mountain of evidence? Evidence that we have compiled ourselves! We've done the reading, we know what autism is, we know what traits we display... Is it ableism? Anxiety? Self-doubt? Obviously this subreddit exists because a lot of people struggle with making this judgement, but why?\n\nIt finally hit me: It's the bottom-up processing! We need every single data point to make a conclusion. We need to see every single tree to decide that it's a forest.

        "text": "I've gotten into self-awareness to try and resolve some of my problems, and it was suggested to me on reddit that autism could be a reason for my family's problems, but as much as I think it is the reason, it also doesn't make any sense. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe all have our own demons, some larger than others, but none of us are mentally fine and I am sure that we all went through some sort of trauma and ptsd, I also think ADHD is a factor because of the stimming and struggles in school, even though my family has no obsessions or anything. ADHD also would explain why my dad can't let loose and must always find problems to solve in the same moment they arise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brother was into computers from a young age as it was the cutting-edge technology and would take out and put together parts by himself, I had thousands of interests that only last until something else more fun comes along, and I am the only picky eater of my family, and I begun to suspect that it's just that my mom is a bad cook cause trying meals I hated with friends ends up in me liking them, even my brother who \"hates\" pasta doesn't really hate it, just hates my mom's pasta.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCould trauma and PTSD be the cause and not us being on the spectrum? We are horrible socially to an extent and sometimes face passive aggressiveness that is missed until later, but that happens to everyone. I really struggle with conversations though and it feels like a hit or miss on days where I can hyperfocus and be an amazing storyteller and conversationalist purely by instinct and other days where I have formulate and overthink everything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts like if I can turn off my thinking and let my body do its own thing all the time, I'd be perfectly fine, but with all these thoughts running in my head all the time I just can't act myself. I also never have the confidence to do anything and I always think I look weird. I have severe image and confidence issues to the point that in my interview for my current job, they were amazed with the amount of things I knew about and I could tell they were highly interested, but in my mind all I can think of is \"they're mocking me, this interview is to use me as a joke. Nothing good will ever happen to you, don't ever fool yourself, since when have you ever deserved anything good?\"",

        "text": "Hello, after a lifetime of keeping very much to myself I recently considered the possibility that I could be autistic, given that reading about others experiences resonates deeply with me and explains a lot about my identity. I immediately compiled a list of 'strange' habits/behabiours I never got a reasonable explanation for, although a lot of this has been bottled away in shame (I have very strict parents who told me to 'get over it' a lot) and I tend to lie internally to myself about how I truly feel. I was a child of innocence, and only now am I starting to question my experiences and realise that nothing was really as functioning as I thought it was. \n\nI would value anyones opinion because I am feeling very dysphoric and more confused than ever. I ultimately would like to seek some professional help but there are several barriers to that (I am a teenager for one), so for the moment I am just going to talk with my neurodvergent friends about their experiences, but I'd appreciate if anyone else could relate to/explain my list?\n\nHere is what I have written so far:\n\n\\- I cannot control my facial expressions when feeling strong emotion, I cannot stop myself from making huge grins even when I feel very sad - I feel very self concious about this and desperately try to stop it usually by pinching/squeezing myself to try and distract my mind\n\n\\- Strong smells render me incapable of functioning, especially paper/newspaper. I especially find it difficult to eat/drink around strong smells and in situations where I cannot remove the smell source will just keep quietly to myself. Eg. when my school went to a careers expo I couldn't eat my lunch because there were paper pamphlets everywhere. I also have trouble brushing my teeth because I don't like mint. I love peanut butter, but the smell is very strong and lingers on my fingers for a long time afterwards, which is very distracting. \n\n\\- I'm sensitive to certain textures as well, I hated and still hate putting on sunscreen because it feels greasy and oily on my skin. Sticky things as well, I feel contaminated and like I can't touch anything because it will be ruined (similar to smells, I don't like touching anything smelly)\n\n\\- Rolling a piece of blutac helps me relax, if I am completely alone I will just roll it around nonstop. I also like the smell.\n\n\\- I pick at my eyebrows a lot, I like spiky things that sort of put pressure under my nails. When I was little I used to bit my nails and play with the piece in my mouth because it put a bit of pressure between my teeth.\n\n\\- I distance myself from large social gatherings and tend to find a corner or quiet spot. I really like public toilet stalls at the end because they are small, quiet spaces where I can just breathe for a moment. I also have a favourite spot at the bus depot on the way home, a little foyer just outside the elevator that nobody uses. I tend to gravitate towards these quiet areas and just think if that makes sense. My inner voice is going constantly and I like that, but it disappears if I am overwhelmed by noises/people.\n\n\\- I'm told that I speak 'cryptically', I like to think a lot about what I say (if I say at all) and often it seems to come out like an inside joke that only I am in on. \n\n\\- In primary school especially, but continuing to this day I always felt like I didn't have enough friends, and that those I did have were not close enough. I really like reading and would usually spend my lunchtimes reading in the alcoves of the entrances to the back classrooms to the point where my parents intervened and my teacher talked to me about it (little oblivious me didn't really see it good or bad either way, I think I acted mostly on what my subconcious was telling me so a few weeks later of properly 'playing with the other kids' I went back to reading but more incognito so to not get caught)\n\n\\- When I say 'innocent' I should probably say 'naive', I have always had an innate fear of authority and blindness to my personal needs - I do extremely well in school and have a 'great work ethic' but only now am I questioning why I am like that and why I have just been doing what I'm told all my life. It feels like my personality is defined by what other people have told me I like, or what I am good at because I think 'well I need to please them, I will be good at this'.\n\n\\- I want to be social, I want friends and relationships but I also don't feel like it is something I am good at. Difficult to explain, but for example this week I have been invited to a party which is theoretically something I would love. It validates me in friendship circles and makes me feel wanted, but I also feel just very hollow at the idea. I know I will be there, but I won't be able to do anything properly. \n\n\\- I form really deep emotional connections with media, and I don't think anyone else is affected this strongly. For example, after watching cowboy bebop I went on autopilot for a week thinking of nothing else and trying to process my emotions. I will use the word hollow again but it is the best word I can think of. My worldview was fundamentally challenged and I had an internal existential crisis that seemed to transcend anything else I was supposed to be doing (working, schoolwork). My favourite movie is 'Spirited Away' but I struggle to bring myself to repeat watch it because I know I won't be able to function properly for a long period afterward. \n\nFinally, I don't quite know how to write this down but I have always felt 'different' to everyone else, and that nobody really 'understands me' (my closest friend is the only one who has come very close and who I would say knows me better than anyone has ever before is on the spectrum). I know everyone must feel this to some extent at some point in their life, so its probably something only I can recognise but I always felt like a bit of an outcast. \n\nSorry, this is a lot of text and I am so nervous my fluency is probably not great but I appreciate if you read this the way through. Thank you.",
