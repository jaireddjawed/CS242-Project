        "text": "I'm currently a Jr software developer in a non-IT department making applications in Access with SQL backend, and just had an interview in the actual IT department for a software developer role, but they use the .net framework which I have little experience in. I did very well in the interview other than the .net questions, which I was pretty honest about what I did and did not have experience in, but tried to answer to the best of my ability. I've used C# before and dabbled in some .net in my coursework, but the courses were never centered around it so my experience is pretty much some basic terminology. My ace up my sleeve that I always play during interviews is at the end when they ask me if I have any questions, I say something along the lines of \"if you don't mind, I would like to show you some of my personal projects as examples of my eagerness to learn.\" I love to learn new things so I tend to jump head first into hobbies that I have zero experience in but have always been curious about. \n\nJust for some examples, I have a 3D printed ironman helmet that I painted and used and Arduino to make the face shield open and close, I designed and 3D printed an eyepiece mount for my telescope so I could take photos through it (I focus on how I had to learn how optics work when I talk about this), I made custom headlights for my older car with LED turn signal strips, and currently have a project car that I'm in the process of rebuilding the engine.\n\nThen I usually close it out with \"I recognize I may not have answered all of your questions as well as you are hoping, but I am confident I will quickly learn whatever I may not know.\" When I did this for my current position, my boss later told me that that was what set me apart from other applicants and that they pretty much knew they were going to hire me after that. My only concern with my recent interview is that it's not a Jr role, so they might be less willing to hire someone who doesn't know everything already. At least since it's the same company, they'll be able to see my performance evaluations and talk to my boss who would definitely corroborate my ability to learn.",

        "text": "I was given an offer for a 6-month contract-to-hire job that pays ok, but it's a lot less than I was making at my previous job (but I got laid off, so I need the job), and I know I can make more elsewhere, especially if the economy improves at all 6 months from now.\n\nAlso it's hybrid instead of fully remote, and at the very least I KNOW I can make this same amount fully remotely many other places. So I'm already not feeling confident that I want to accept the employment offer for full-time at the end of the 6 month contract. **Is it considered reneging on the deal if I decline that offer 6 months from now? Would they blacklist me? Would that screw my 3rd-party recruiter over? Because she's extremely nice and I don't want to fuck with her pay or anything.** Because the recruiter already asked me what pay I would be happy with for a full-time conversion, and tbh no amount of pay they'd be willing to offer me would compete with the compensation at my old job. So I just said I was fine with what they were already offering me, I knew they couldn't compete with what I'm used to. \n\nI'm currently in an interview process for another job that pays \\~25% more than this one and is fully remote. I'm not finished with that process yet, it will probably take another 2 weeks. Unfortunately they've given me 1 week to agree to the offer or not, and I'm worried if I ask for an extension that they'll give the offer to someone else (because the interview process was super quick, essentially just 1 quick interview, they could easily get someone else by the time I've made a decision). And I don't want to risk losing BOTH jobs by waiting to finish the interview process at the other place, they don't give me an offer, and then this place that has given me an offer rescinds because they found someone else.\n\nWhat would you recommend I do in this situation?",

I can choose my stack and have full control over the development process. As a result, I've been able to take my time and learn whatever I want on the job.\n* My work-life balance is good. I'm only required to spend two days in the office per week, making travelling (and life in general) far cheaper.\n* Overtime is a big thing at this company (within reason), and it does make up a chunk of my salary during audit periods. I'm young and see overtime as a positive.\n* After a very successful project, I've been given a lot of responsibility and trust regarding my work. I'm not micromanaged in any way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few cons:\n\n* I am the only developer at the company. I have no colleagues to consult with when things become overwhelming, and I have no senior to approve my solutions or call me an idiot.\n* My salary is roughly 20% lower than what it should be and the company is notorious for not paying annual increases or performance based bonuses. This is mitigated by overtime to a degree, but obviously overtime fluctuates.\n* The company is drowning in interdepartmental conflict. I'm not involved in any way, but this does result in a somewhat soured workforce (making large projects involving multiple departments very difficult).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been applying for new positions (largely due to salary and lack of a mentor) and it has been going very well so far. I average two to three interviews per week and most have been positive. However, I am beginning to doubt my decision to leave and this is making interviews difficult to stomach.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat would you do? Stay at a low-stress job where you can learn and build whatever you want, or would you chase a higher salary at a company where you can learn from more senior developers?\n\nI'm definitely learning a lot in my own time, but is this good enough?

        "text": "Hello,\n\nI am a 4th-year Management Information Systems student at a public business school in the US. After taking many courses, I have determined that the technical courses were the ones I enjoyed the most, and I am inclined to pursue a career in software engineering. However, I am aware that my lack of knowledge on mathematics, discrete math, DS&amp;A, and general software engineering techniques makes me currently severely unqualified to become a software engineer. I have decided that I am going to dedicate myself to learning the necessary quantitative/technical skills necessary to become a software engineer.\n\nHowever, how I should start is dizzying. I have considered taking technical courses in the summer and fall semesters. What are great technical courses for someone with my background to start with? How can I reroute my transcript, even with my minimal time left in school, to be as appealing as possible to a software engineering hiring manager? In terms of software engineering job-seeking/career growth, am I going to hurt myself if I just stick to my business curriculum and self-teach technical concepts on my own after graduating? Should I forgo job-hunting for business related jobs after graduating so I can teach myself software engineering, or will that just look bad to any employer?\n\nSome of the more technical courses I have taken/are taking:\n\nAn introductory Java/OOP course. The most 'complex' thing we learned about was inheritance/polymorphism\n\nA basic MySQL/data modelling course\n\nAn advanced MySQL/data modelling/NoSQL course - Window functions, procedures, correlated subqueries, common table expressions, etc.\n\nA business-oriented machine learning course - Covers common ML modelling methods and basic implementation of them\n\nA course on handling big data with Apache Spark for Java\n\nA Tableau course\n\nI know I asked a lot of questions, but I appreciate any help that anyone can provide.

        "text": "I’ve been working at a state department for 2+ years (first dev job out of college). I’m their “web developer” but most of my work has been HTML/CSS fixes and Drupal site creation. I migrated our public site from Drupal 7 to Drupal 9 as this was a statewide initiative, and basically manually copied over and “improved” content (as provided by stakeholders) from the old site to the new one (which was a custom install provided by the overarching admin department for all agencies). Needless to say I’m still not feeling the “web developer” part as I’m essentially a glorified site admin who creates advanced HTML/CSS snippets when needed.\n\nI dislike Drupal as my experience has been nothing but headaches: fixing JS bugs within modules, editing CSS and hoping it works since the theme is a subtheme of a subtheme of the Bootstrap theme, trying to work with the site GUI for content which has been extremely buggy and has a good 50/50 chance of breaking something on or the whole site itself, overall just “why does this thing make this simple thing 10x harder than it needs to be?”. I really hate installing modules for the smallest things that should logically be a preexisting feature, and further hate the resulting bloated mess of a website (which was already bloated by the time I got handed it).\n\nIt’s past the “public site redesign”, and we are now looking at our internal site which is a deprecated, unmaintained .ASP mess. I thought this would be a great chance to use something newer that’s lightweight and would allow me to further actual developer skills - I was told the sky is the limit and I’m free to choose the stack since I’m their only web person and they hold me in high regard for my work. \n\nHowever, I’ve now been told higher-ups want the site “to look like our public site” and a few other divisions are “upset” because they want to be able to edit their content. I’m really annoyed as 1.) there is not a way for me to make an internal version of the Drupal site we have because that’s on a hosting service and the agency who provided it specified they are not supporting that for internal use, 2.) I don’t think the public site is good and I believe I can make the internal one better, 3.) nobody manages their own content on our public site or internal site - they always send in tickets/emails and I have to do it for them despite the public site literally being a CMS, 4.) I’m not a “Drupal developer” and that was not what I signed up for - the position was “web developer/programmer analyst”, knowing Drupal was a “want” not a need out of all the other requirements , and our public site is the only place it is used.\n\nSo I’m wondering, do I just suck it up and make a Drupal site, keep my head down and continue training in JS/other stuff to make projects and get out ASAP? Am I doing myself a disservice and should I embrace Drupal and switch to learning PHP? Is it unreasonable of me to have the mindset of “if we’re going to use Drupal again, either everyone needs to be managing their own content or there’s no point in using it”? I’m guessing the first idea is the answer as I don’t have a team, we don’t have version control (I used Git for pushing changes to the web host though), I run my own task board because our PMO is nonexistent, and I seem to be the only one in the building who knows anything about modern dev topics (tech, processes and workflows, etc.). I know my advanced Drupal knowledge is lacking, but I was hoping I’d be done with Drupal after that migration and could work on better projects. What do you guys think?",
