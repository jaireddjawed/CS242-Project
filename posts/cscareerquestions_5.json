I recently learned that my coworkers that are also contracting through this agency actually have PTO benefits but I do not since I didn't specifically ask for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I reached out to my recruiter letting them know that I would like add PTO to my contract but she said no. I reached out to a secondary recruiter with more knowledge and he said that I should be able to add PTO benefits to my contract, but he needed to double check with HR first.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell today, they scheduled a meeting with the recruiters, a HR lady, and myself. I asked the HR lady if I was eligible for PTO she very confidently said no. I then told her that my coworkers who are contracting through them as well have PTO, but she said that is incorrect and none of their contractors have PTO. I told her that I am positive that my coworkers have PTO, and she very rudely said \"You can go back to them and come back to me with whatever you want, but the answer is still going to be no, you are not eligible for PTO.\"  \n\n\nAt that point, I just dropped off the call because I knew they were lying because I've seen my coworkers pay stub, and it has PTO.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell about 45 minutes later, my recruiters called me (which I ignored) and texted me multiple times asking me to return her calls. When I finally did, she told me that the head of HR said that I am eligible for PTO and the HR lady was incorrect and false information was relayed to me. She apologized profusely on the HR lady's behalf. I told my recruiter that I want to document everything in written form and they told me to type up an email stating what happened, and send it to everyone in that meeting (2 recruiters, and 1 HR lady) and they will reply back to me stating that they acknowledge what written in the email as factual correct. I haven't sent them any emails yet. Is this the right way?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, do I have any type of legal case? We're my rights as an employee fringed upon? What is the correct way to document this in written form?",

Apologies if there are any formatting errors, posting this on mobile. \n\nBut I’m looking for some advice on my current situation at my company with my salary. Some background:\n\nI have 2YOE in SE (all at current company), and 2.5YOE in Web Dev. My current salary, after including most recent yearly raise, is $54k. I originally started at $50k, and foolishly accepted it as it was my first job in this field and thought it was acceptable for my expertise at the time. But since then, I’ve become very familiar with our companies software, have completed multiple projects all by myself, and am currently in the progress of creating a brand new interface for a piece of hardware my company wanted to pick up market share of (won’t say exactly what it is, but it’s in the warehouse controls world). There is also no senior on the team that has worked on this hardware before, so I’m learning everything on my own as I go; which isn’t an issue in itself, I enjoy learning new things. \n\nBut am I crazy to assume that $54k is a little low for where I am and what I’ve accomplished so far? After talking with some coworkers, I also found out that the next highest salary above me is $90k (and he sits at 4YOE). I’m looking to bring this up to my manager to see if we can come to a compromise on salary adjustments, but I’ve never done this before so I’m not really sure how to do this without causing too big of a shit storm lol. Is it worth it to even bring it up or start looking for a new job?",

        "text": " Hey Reddit,\n\nI'm an attorney looking to not be an attorney anymore. What I'm specifically looking for is a switch to a career that is: (1) in demand; (2) pays decently well; (3) is something I could possibly do anywhere in the world--basically nothing with strict licensing requirements that don't transfer well (I'm not necessarily going to move, but I don't like feeling constrained in my ability to move.); and (4) is in a CS or tech-related field or otherwise works well for neurodiverse people.\n\nThis might sound like a weird list of requirements, I know. It comes from experience. I lost my job in a niche area of law and when I was looking for a new one, I found that I was really over and under qualified for everything. I had great experience in a very narrow and uncommon area of law. And frankly, I hate being a lawyer. I did public service, and while I was passionate about it, in the end it still broke me. So in thinking about it, I realized I wanted to leave the practice of law, and that the most important thing to me was being able to move into a field where I could develop skills that would allow me to not feel trapped at a single job. I think for most people this must sound insane, but it's really important to me. And I'm someone that is lucky enough to have a lot of interests and subjects that I'm halfway decent in, so I have that flexibility.\n\nI'm focusing on CS/tech fields because I think it would be a good fit for me. I've done a bit of coding, and I liked it. I like solving problems and puzzles, and I'm great at logic. It's been a long while now, but in school my best subject was always math. (My undergrad degrees are not in anything useful, though).\n\nI'd originally intended to do a data science bootcamp, or maybe a master's, but honestly, I don't have enough knowledge to know whether the market is flooded with DS candidates to the point that it's not worth pursuing a DS career.\n\nMy question is twofold: based on what I've written above, can anyone recommend some fields/career paths that might be a good fit? And if so, do you have any suggestions on good ways to go about making that switch? Lastly, I am here looking for advice, so anything else related to what I wrote about above is also welcome.\n\nTIA :)",

He wanted me to write some relatively basic code in front of him and tbh I was really struggling because I was just kind of \"dumb\" and in shock for a while. He was really rude and kept making comments about how this was hello world level stuff which admittedly, it was but it wasn't helping at all and made me start to panic. \n\nI had a panic attack because he was threatening to fire me and being kind of nasty. So I left the call &amp; resigned. I know it's stupid move but I'm already here and I'll beat myself up over it 10,000 more times before I die so not much use letting me know. \n\nI basically said as much in my exit survey and now HR is calling me. She say she figured out it was me from the survey. My only guess why they would care is that they're a subsidiary of a larger public company who I wonder if that survey won't be seen by.

At this job, I worked a year as a full-stack web developer on a small team but was recently laid off.\n\nGoing into it, I knew next to nothing about web development. I had to learn everything on the job for both the front and backend, and all of the supplemental tools that go along with that. I also had to learn about the field we were creating software for itself.\n\nMy entire time there was very, very difficult and frustrating. I am burned out.\n\nAt this job, I learned that I might have to devote my entire life to software development (eat, sleep, code) if I ever want to be competent in this field. I have a feeling that it was only so difficult because I didn't know anything about web development going in, and I was a novice programmer to begin with.\n\nBut maybe that's not the truth.\n\nMaybe the truth is that I will always find this work difficult because I have no passion for it.\n\nI see other developers that are, well, passionate about this field. They seem to eat, sleep, and code. That is most certainly not me. I have some interest in CS, but I don't and have never coded for fun in my spare time. I have other interests, hobbies, and aspirations that I spend my free time on. I feel going forward I will primarily be programming to make a well-paid, stable living, and not much more than that.\n\nNow I am unemployed. I watch videos like [The Harsh Reality of Being a Software Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws6zCMdp9Es) and I become very afraid. I am weighing my options, and wondering if I belong in this field.\n\nI don't aspire to work at a FANG. I just want a chill job that will pay well, and that has a good work-life balance. Is this even a real thing in software development though? Or am I destined to adopt an \"eat, sleep, code\" lifestyle no matter where I go?",

        "text": "These numbers are for the US. Each year the Department of Education publishes the number of degrees conferred in various fields, including the field of \"computer and information sciences\". This category contains more majors than pure CS (the full list is [here](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/cipdetail.aspx?y=55&amp;cipid=88073)), but it's probable that most students are pursuing a computer science related career.\n\nThe numbers for the 2020-2021 school year recently came out and here's some stats: \n\n* The number of [bachelor's](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d22/tables/dt22_322.10.asp) degrees awarded in this field was 104,874 in 2021, an increase of 8% from 2020, 47% from 2017, and 143% from 2011.\n\n* 22% of bachelor's degrees in the field went to women, which is the highest percentage since just after the dot com burst (the peak percentage was 37.1% in 1984). \n\n* The number of [master's](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d22/tables/dt22_323.10.asp) degrees awarded was 54,174, up 5% from '20 and 16% from '17. The number of [PhDs](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d22/tables/dt22_324.10.asp) awarded was 2,572, up 6.5% from '20 and 30% from '17. 25% of PhDs went to women.\n\n* The number of bachelor's degrees awarded in engineering decreased slightly (-1.8% from 2020), possibly because students are veering to computer science or because the pandemic interrupted their degrees.\n\nHere's a couple graphs:\n\n* [Stacked bar graph of BS and MS degrees 2001-2021](https://imgur.com/dcDxD0K)\n\n* [Line graph of BS degrees from 1995-2021](https://imgur.com/h8m5Mol)\n\nThese numbers don't mean much overall but I thought the growth rate was interesting enough to share. From 2015-2021, the y/y growth rate has averaged 9.6% per year (range of 7.8%-11.5%). This doesn't include minors or graduates in majors like math who intend to pursue software.\n\nEntry level appears increasingly difficult and new grads probably can't even trust the job advice they received as freshmen.  Of course, other fields are even harder to break into and people still do it every year.\n\nMid level and above are probably protected the bottleneck that is the lack of entry level jobs. Master's degrees will probably be increasingly common for US college graduates as a substitute for entry level experience.",

But what concerns me is math will consume too much time of mine and I won't be able to participate in possible project.

Only benefit is my personal satisfaction which is not enough.\n\nFor psychology, I'm only considering this so I'll have enough spare time to develop my cs skills and work on as much as projects with my colleagues.\n\nBonus Option: I only study CompSci and nothing else, unlimited spare time.

I have stayed (so far) because it allowed me to learn other non-technical skills outside of work while I (thought I would) learn software development skills at work.\n\nOn paper I \"should\" know how develop in Java working with Selenium, (basic) Springboot, Maven and the like; and while that's kind of true I've never worked on a coding project before. I've only worked on personal projects to help out one/two people or programs that automate manual work I'm doing elsewhere. I have little knowledge on how version control works, never done code reviews, or worked with other developers on a code project before. Management is also pushing me and other developers towards more devops roles over time, since my company isn't mainly software focused.\n\nThe only area I know a decent amount about is, is game development since it's the entire reason I got into software in the first place. I took a hard turn away from those jobs after hearing non-stop bad news from that area and ended up where I am now. It's not all bad, it's not stressful and allows me to learn other things, it's just that my location and job type are not what I want to settle in to.\n\nWhen I look at other jobs I see technologies &amp; languages I don't know or have worked with. I know you don't need a deep knowledge of any of those areas as long as you can transition knowledge between languages/technologies, but I'm worried about my lack of actual development experience. I've done a few code challenges personally to see if I still have some skills and I still remember how to program luckily, so it's not all too bad. I'm just unsure how to go about job searching down the road.\n\nI guess an example would be a saved post in linked from years ago I have, they want:\n\n* \"BS in Comp Sci\" (Yes)\n* \"2 years working in a multi-person game studio\" (No)\n* \"Have 3D game engine experience, especially Unity 3D\" (multiple years of personal/non-professional \"experience\", but never finished projects mostly just test projects)\n* \"Can work in C# or C++\" (again personal experience using basic C# and very little C++)\n* \"Ability to work in a fast-paced environment\" (I can manage it but don't prefer it)\n* \"Experience working on cross-functional teams...\" (actual experience at work).\n\nEven on just that post alone I have basically no experience at all in the areas they want. I know I can just apply but even if they look into my application it's very clear I have no idea how to work in that area.\n\nSo I guess my question is: how do I transition to a more developer focused job without much developer experience?",

They basically work on using Data Proto Models to make digitally-modeled prototype vehicles generated through the formulation of three-dimensional data. \n\nThe project team itself seems interesting and at the time I had no offers so I didn't really ask questions in my interview to clarify if the job was computer science related, although they do know very well about my CS background through my answers to their behavioral questions, because I did not want to risk not getting any offer. Now, I also have another swe offer at another small company, so I felt comfortable emailing for more clarification about what exactly I would be working on. They responded with the tasks below:\n\nI think DPM stands for Data Proto Models.\n\nSummer co-op possible tasks\n\n1. V5 DPM Quality\n   1. V5 DPM Quality Error Report Support \n   2. Zenteki temp (application) error report\n   3. Automation for DPM vs NEWS (application) compare\n   4. DPM error visualization\n2. Automation Support\n   1.

        "text": "So I got a email from Abalta Technologies for a Data Engineer position interview. However, I dont remember applying to this company. The email is from the CTO Pavel, it doesn't mention my name, and I'm in the market for SE jobs (my resume is tailored to that area.) I am a bit skeptic on whether this is a scam or not.\n\nThings that make me think it's not a scam:\n\n- There is a LinkedIn page with employees and the CTO that emailed me.\n- There are glassdoor reviews/interviews/salaries\n- There are no typos\n- The email domain matches the company\n\nThings that make me think it's a scam:\n\n- I have 0 experience and I'm a new grad\n- I have no confirmation emailing saying I ever applied to the company \n- There are no data engineers on the linkedIn page or the glassdoor page.\n- Their website has 0 openings for data engineers\n\nI might be having imposter syndrome. However, with the state of the job market along with my personal experiences it seems too good to be true. I sent a email saying that there might be a mistake and I applied to a SE position to see what happens. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this and what do you recommend doing?",

However, several people have told me that it creates a negative bias against your profile and comes off as showy. I am just asking because previously when I was job-hunting, a few companies had me take an online IQ test before proceeding to the actual interview stages.",

I feel what I learned in school is kinda separated from what’s currently popular in job market. Any advice for how to start my personal project?",
