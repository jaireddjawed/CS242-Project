The good news is that the mod queue was full of reports, several users directly PM'ed the mod team to let us know about trolling, and we are currently working on fixing problems to make sure this doesn't happen again in the future. \n\n**First**, thank all of you for your vigilance and desire to keep this sub awesome. The mods were able to respond quickly and directly thanks to reports and messages from wonderful long-term users. We are watching the situation closely, but going forward we need your watchful eyes to point out what we miss. \n\n**Second**, continue to report the dross, the trolls, and the \"Just Asking Questions\" posts. We need your eyes to help keep this place humming along.\n\n**Finally**, as a reminder our community rules  are over there----------&gt;.\n\nTop level answers need to be in-depth and informed. Half-remembered tales from middle school history do not make for an acceptable answer. We expect you to have a good grasp of the subject matter, to be able to cite accurate sources (not just Wikipedia), and be able to answer follow-up questions. Check out /r/AskHistorians wiki on [standards for answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/rules#wiki_answers) to get an idea of what we expect. Report the comments that don't meet these standards.\n\nNext, we expect everyone to engage in civil discourse. Don't feed trolls, just report them. If someone is rude report the comment and the mods will deal with the situation. Keep this community a place for great discourse.\n\nThat's it!

        "text": "&gt; “When you grow up, get a good job, find someone, settle down, start a family. __Then, you will be happy.__”\n\nThat's what Generation X (not sure what's the better term, maybe \"our parents generation\"?) say about marriage in Malaysia. You can be good at anything, but you'll only be completely happy after you settle down in marriage. In Indonesia, it's similar. There's a joke that you can have a very good career and have anything you want, but you haven't fulfilled your life yet if you haven't married. Your life is only complete after marriage. I think there are similar anecdotes in Philippines and other countries in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn the last few decades, the trend has changed though (see [here](http://www.malaysiandigest.com/frontpage/282-main-tile/672783-why-more-malaysians-today-are-open-to-staying-single.html)). There are plenty of young people in their 30s content of not being married yet. And they're usually pretty upset when older families/relatives ask them about marriage.\n\nA few days back a professor mentioned in passing about this (in a completely unrelated lecture): the tension between younger generation and older generation about marriage is a phenomenon of capitalism. He said it's the different way people perceive \"happiness\" before and after capitalism. From what I can infer from him, I think he want to say that before capitalism: marriage is the goal that makes you happy; after capitalism: you don't have to settle in marriage to be happy.\n\nI didn't get the chance to ask him more about this but it got me pondering.\n\nAnthropology has studied a lot about marriage and kinship in pre-capitalist societies but it never took my attention what does the marriage mean to the people. If marriage \"completes\" the person, what does it mean by being \"complete\"? If it makes them \"happy\", what does it mean to be \"happy\"? I remember Geertz and the Javanese (Indonesian) notion of *durung njawa* (not yet a real person), but that's not related to marriage.\n\nI guess that would be my first question. Second question would be about the professor's claim that capitalist relation changes the way people perceive marriage and happiness. Does his remark has any grain of truth? Has there been any work that touches this subject?\n\nI'll really appreciate any insight on this subject.",

People had more to eat, were less likely to suffer from mental illness, they had more free time, and there was less prejudice and discrimination. I am definitely getting the quote wrong but they stated 'all of man's ills grew from the time when one individual said \"that's mine\"' - and they seemed to reference the invention of agriculture as the beginning of this process. This seemed completely contradictory to common sense, but I found it hard to explain beyond the absence of infant mortality. Anything I claimed like cars and hummus they claimed were only of use to further a consumerist society - ie we don't need cars if we don't have an office job to drive to. \nThis seems counter-intuitive to me, but it has left me with a bit of a headache, so I decided to ask here. I do not have a background in anthropology so please go easy on me if I have made some unforgiveable error in my question.\nSurely ",

We know that the first organized states of the classic early civilizations appeared in the river valleys of the Indus, Nile, Yellow, and between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. We know that the overflow from these rivers created conditions for agriculture and irrigation that made for a stable food supply, and a surprise, which brought along differentiation of labor and eventually organized polities.\n\nBut why in those places? I was watching a lecture by Columbia Professor Richard Bulliet and he said that the emmer wheat, millet, barley, and rice grown in these valleys provides fewer calories per acre than wild-growing crops like bananas or potatoes. So why didn't civilization, which requires a permanent food source, start in the Americas or in more tropical climates where those crops are native? I'd be interested to hear the explanation!

Illiterate peasants who didn't travel more than 10 miles from their village, couldn't have spoken exactly the same as those who could read and traveled abroad, such as merchants and nobles. Basically, this is how new languages could develop based on other language groups - the more isolated people live, the more new dialects start to spring into being. \n\nPeople just had their own way of talking to each other, and lack of peer pressure from the outside world would lead them to act nuanced. As villagers became more connected later on, language became more uniform, especially with the introduction of literacy and writing. \n\nMy guess is that the nobility in northern england simply stuck to their way of communicating, and it made its way into writing, such that more uniform standards sprung up. \n\nHowever, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu8O6zyc9_4) somewhat asserts that dialectical conformity existed into the medieval era.\n\n-------- \nI'd like to see what this community's opinions on the dialect continuum are?﻿\n\nThe case for the locales of england and how somewhere like france or china was quite different - that's interesting to me, and so any extra knowledge would be helpful.

        "text": "Some scientists say that H-G (hunter-gatherer) societies were egalitarian in every aspect (no social classes, sexes are equal etc). They often take example of !Kung people. !Kung people also have this kind of life philosophy which amongst other things considers any kind of violence childish.\n\nOn the other side, some say the truth is totally opposite. They say the academia draws these conslusions influenced by modern-day politics. In their opinion, violence has its roots deep in humans, so the warfare was also common between the h-g bands. Now, they take example of some (or many?) h-g peoples from Papua New Guinea, Africa, and most famous Sentinelese islands people.\n\nSo, whose side has more correct views? What are the facts (archeological) that support those views, because modern-day h-gs have been under heavy influence by agriculturalists, colonialists, or us from today's world society. So taking them as examples is not so reliable. \n\nBy googling, I found an example of 10000 years old massacre on Ethiopian platau (I think..). And it is stated that it's the (evidence for) earliest act of \"mass-violence\" yet found. But that's not so long time ago, and around that time, people start to transition to sedentary way of life in some parts of the world. \n\nSo, all these things and many others I read about h-gs on the internet, make me draw some kind of conclusion: \n\n* Early, paleolithic h-gs were very mobile, living in small bands, having no hierachical structure in their society and were pretty egalitarian\n\n* This was made possible because of low population density, and their lack of \"land owning\" concept\n\n* Hence, there was not much violence within the bands, but sporadic encounters between two bands could end up violently (out of fear mostly)\n\n* After becoming sedentary or semi-sedentary, they would need to protect their land from others, who could use up resources from their territory\n\n* Also this would enable other hgs to pillage the sedentary ones (even though they are non violent, individal hg communities could have different set of moral and religious believes, among them violent ones)\n\n\nTwo qustions remain: how close is this view to the truth and why did people become sedentary?",

But I can't imagine that women who live in societies deeply affected by gang activity serve only as the objects of male actors. Have there been studies of women as mediators, *instigators*, and transactional/economic collaborators in gang culture(s)?\n\nThe source of my question is a half-remembered BBC article from over a decade ago, about young women in Brazilian favelas encouraging young men into gang culture by praising those who hussled and criticizing those who were not \"gangster\" enough. \n\nAlso, while Jenny Jochens characterizes the ancient/medieval Norse female instigator as a misogynistic stereotype, William Ian Miller introduces the idea that it would be logical for \"non-combatants\" (women, old men, and the lower social classes in the Norse literature) to encourage violence as a form of social competition since their fortunes are contingent upon the successes of the socially/publicly active male upon whom they are dependent. Given that leadership in Western gangs is almost exclusively male, and that competition between gangs is effected primarily or solely by its socially/publicly active (violent) men, I feel that this might reflect a similar social dynamic as identified by Miller in the medieval Icelandic context.",

The only exception is the modern age, where sexual liberation surfaced hand in hand with feminist ideas, and a good advertizing machine backing all of it. Otherwise sexual oppression seems very easy to establish. Some examples. The supposed transformation from neolithic equality to the well-known historical patriarchy in the Middle East (I don't know if that really took place, but it is often talked about). The transition of a more \"liberal (I put it in quotes because women still didn't have equality) atmosphere of the Roman Empire to medieval christianity. Somewhat later, the christianization of Scandinavian and other Germanic tribes who are known to have more liberal sexual mores. In the China, the transition from Taoism to confucianism, which emphasized the importance of hierarchy, subordination of women to men and sexual restraint. In more recent times, the transition between the France post-Restoration and the transition from Georgian period to Victorian period in England. Later, the christianization of African, Native American and Pacific Islander peoples by Europeans, which brought an abrupt change in sexual mores. Every time, it seems that 'puritan' forces are able to keep the opposition easily under control. Is it because they are more organized? The other interesting fact is that more or less the same type of sexual oppression existed both in Western civilization and in East Asian ones, which developed virtually convergently. Why? Is sexual oppression a prerequisit to forming a so called high civilization?",

Freeman argued instead that Samoan culture prized female chastity and virginity and that Mead had been misled by her female Samoan informants. Freeman's critique was met with a considerable backlash and harsh criticism from the anthropology community, whereas it was received enthusiastically by communities of scientists who believed that sexual mores were more or less universal across cultures.[51][52] Some anthropologists who studied Samoan culture argued in favor of Freeman's findings and contradicted those of Mead, whereas others argued that Freeman's work did not invalidate Mead's work because Samoan culture had been changed by the integration of Christianity in the decades between Mead's and Freeman's fieldwork periods.[53] While Mead was careful to shield the identity of all her subjects for confidentiality Freeman was able to find and interview one of her original participants, and Freeman reported that she admitted to having willfully misled Mead. She said that she and her friends were having fun with Mead and telling her stories.[54] Other anthropologists have rejected the notion that Mead's conclusions rested on the validity of a single interview with a single person, arguing instead that Mead based her conclusions on the sum of her observations and interviews during her time in Samoa and that the status of the single interview did not falsify her work.[55] Some anthropologists have however maintained that even though Freeman's critique was invalid, Mead's study was not sufficiently scientifically rigorous to support the conclusions she drew.[56]\"\n\nDoes anyone know more about how accurate are Margaret Mead's writings are? \n\nIf she is in fact wrong, or even partly wrong, why do people keep citing her as a source of cultural or sexual revolution? Is it possible that even if she is wrong, the counterculture revolution (or sexual revolution of the 60's) would've continued? \n\nAny comments would be appreciated.",

Although I have very little time I've always been incredibly interested in human life and development and I took my first anthropology class last semester. Before coming to college I was looking into adding Archaeology as a second major but found that it was under the category of Anthropology. I signed up for a class and loved it. It was a basic class on human development and it was a gen ed. But it was by far my favorite science class I have ever taken. I want to add it as a double major but I have a question for all you anthropologists:\n\nShould I do it?\n\nAnd if so what should I focus on in the field if I wanted to be in the field of Archeology? \n\nThanks for the help!\n",

It seems plausible enough to me. Could it be that somehow a species of early human reached the Americas, survived the initial migration of modern humans, became incorporated into local folklore, and eventually died out with the arrival of Europeans? I could see it being true, but I wanted the opinion of people who actually know about this stuff.\n",

As I believe it was written in the late 30's, I know that much has changed since then. It's claimed that the author had 'channeled' an entity that had all of this information, and I am so curious as to whether any of it is truth or if many parts of it came from the authors own self. Knowing what we do today, would it be viable to discern whether any of the information is accurate? If there are any questions or need clarification please don't hesitate to reach out. I am SO VERY curious, so far this book is incredibly interesting for me. Thanks much in advance!\n\nEdit: I've crossed posted this from AskHistorians",
