        "text": "Back in May last year, I finally got a job after 2 years of unemployment. This is my first full time job as a developer.\n\nThe company is small when it comes to workers, but is one of the largest in my country terms of customers. We focus mainly on statistics and data analysis that customers can perform using our application.\nWe have our own system which is built using Vue, Java and Spring.\n\nI was originally hired to do frontend tasks, but the contract did say \"... and help out with various tasks in the system\", which was kinda vague.\n\nMy boss one day asks me how much I know about Java. I tell him \"the basics\", and he is like \"Don't worry, we will take it slow.\nThen he gives me a 10 minute introduction to spring and tells me to make a new database table and set it up with repository, manager, controller and everything. Oh yeah, it also needed to have proper security, user authentication etc.\n\nOh, and the customer needs it done in 1 week...\n\nThis is how ALL my backend tasks are. So far I managed to get through them by working 70 hours a week (including weekend), but still get paid 48.000 USD a year.\nMy boss seems completely baffled that I am having a hard time. He keeps comparing me with my coworker who has autism. \"He can perform these tasks without overtime, despite his condition!\"\n\nWell I can't... and another issue is that we are only allowed to ask a certain number of questions a day. If we ask too much we get fired.\n\nAnd to make things even more stupid - My boss is giving most of the pure frontend tasks to our secretary, who has to interrupt me all the time because she cannot do basic CSS. She's not a developer, so apparently she is allowed to ask every 30 minutes...\n\nI cannot lose this job. People tell me just to find a new one, but I don't want to be without a job for another 2 years. It ate away my savings.\n\nRight now all I can do is look at other Java / Spring files, copy-paste and try to make it work. Then when it works I write down the code so I can use it later.\nI have no idea how it works. I just know it does.\n\nDo you guys have any tips on how to make these backend tasks easier to overcome? Right now I am using Baeldung, but with a 70 hour work week I simply do not have time to do courses etc.\n\nAlso is it normal for frontend devs to get these kinds of backend tasks?",

My HR is requiring me to give them an updated resume so they can provide it to the client for our next project. Apparently the client wants to see who is on the team. This is a client they already have worked with so it seems strange they would need to see my resume. Is this a strange HR Request? \n\nI'm also not getting any hours since they don't have any tasks for me. It's been like this for a few weeks. They keep saying the project is supposed to start soon, but every week they push back the start date. Im supposed to be full time as well. The last project I worked on for 8 months. After my last project I took a 2 week vacation but apparently they don't have any work for me. I'm using PTO so I still get paid but I'd rather not and I already brought it up to my boss I want to resume my normal 40hrs a week and save my PTO but they keep pushing back the start date of the new project. Meanwhile they have other projects ongoing that I could be working on. I don't feel I deserve to be in this situation given that I performed well on my last project.\n\nThis is kind of a vent more than a question, sorry.\n\nAny advice on how to proceed?",

I did 2 years of BTEC IT in college and got a DDM (UK). I chose planning because, at the time, I thought I could have this career of making cities, and by proxy, the world, a better place. I didn't realise how boring planning jobs could be until I met people in the industry who gave me the impression that it isn't always so fulfilling. (I realise how naïve I was and wish I had more sense back then.)\n\nI always liked IT work in school and college but I just never thought it could be as interesting. As I've grown older (I'm now 24), I've realised how important money actually is and how I want to have a good safety net, as well as a high job satisfaction. I think I have 2 years left of student finance support, so my options are kind of limited. I could pay for the first year of a 3 year course, but that wouldn't include masters.\n\nAnyway, long story short, I realise that IT was probably the better route and I want to ask a few questions...\n\n1. Is it more if a struggle to get into the workforce with just a bsc and not masters?\n\n2. Would it be better to get a degree in CS rather than go through an apprenticeship or some other scheme to get into the industry?\n\nThat's it really. If anyone can relate to my struggle, even better.

I guess some sort of research position adjacent to these fields would be best, but I'm not really sure what to look for or who to ask.

        "text": "I just saw a post on r/programming titled \"I am a bad software developer and this is my life\" and it was obvious to me that this is just a guy who was bad at the interview process but who is actually a fine software developer. As a real bad software developer, I wanted to tell my story so you can learn from it:\n\nI was always good at standardized exams that I studied for. The first time I took the SAT college entrance exam in the US, I scored a perfect 800 on the math and a 720 on the critical reading, for an SAT score of 1520 out of 1600 - a Harvard admissions level SAT score. I graduated with a bachelor's in computer science and was able to pass the coding interviews after studying the book \"Cracking The Coding Interview\" and practicing LeetCode problems, but despite having done well at interviews, I was always a worthless programmer. My first real job in 2016 was an entry level software engineering position at Amazon, and despite it being entry level, I started out with a 130k base, 20k bonus issued in monthly installments, and some vesting stock on the East coast of the US (I had multiple competing offers and negotiated up).\n\nDuring my two years at Amazon, almost every task followed the same pattern. I would let my manager or senior engineer pick out an \"easy\" task for me in the queue. I would ask my senior engineer where in the codebase the change needed to be made (because I could never learn my way around a codebase I didn't write). I used \"git blame\" to find who wrote or worked on that code before me and I would go to their desk or message them asking them questions about the code because I could not learn a codebase or read code written by other people for the life of me. Then I would put print statements in between every single line and run the code over and over, asking my senior engineer for help when I got stuck or didn't know what to do, which was frequent. Eventually I managed to finish the task, but in the process I took up so much of other, more experienced people's time that they could have just completed my task in about the time I spent receiving help.\n\nI never became able to complete any work independently. I never even was able to contribute to any open source project that I wasn't the sole author of. Despite that, I failed up, going from a job at Amazon that paid me $150,000 to another job that paid $86 an hour on W2 in a small city where my rent was $1,300 a month walking distance from work. I did not complete a single task in my three months of time there before I was fired for schizoaffective/bipolar manic psychosis.\n\nEventually I ended up receiving government disability benefits due to psychiatric/neurological brain issues. I now live with my parents and collect $3000 a month from the government, which I intend to keep doing for the rest of my life.\n\nPerhaps the brain issues contributed to me being a sucky programming employee. Despite my cognitive issues, I did well on the coding tests and could write an impressive sounding resume and exaggerate/lie my way through behavioral questions, which is what I was judged on. I am a real bad software developer. If you're having a hard time getting a job but you're regularly making contributions to open source projects and independently contributing to the codebase at work, you're probably not a bad programmer - you're probably just not as good at coding problems and convincingly exaggerating/lying on the behavioral section.",

        "text": "About 3 years ago I decided to pursue a SWE job like a bunch of other people during COVID. I spent around a year self-studying before deciding I wanted to pursue a CS degree. I am going to graduate August of this year. When I decided to make this career transition I was running a small financial company that licensed a specialized product suite (I oversaw about 10 people - reported directly to the owner). I managed to get a job with the software company that provides the software my old job licensed as a Product Manager. When I interviewed with the company I talked to the VP of Engineering and explained I was trying to pivot into a SWE role. He was very encouraging and supportive and said he'd give me a path into Engineering when I finished my degree. \n\nA few years later I've been PM and been doing well as a PM. I have been trying to jump on any SWE type work I can do on the side including building an integration application that our Operations team has been wanting. I basically put into practice a lot of the concepts I was learning in school as I was learning them and spent a ton of my own time figuring out how to build an integration. It works, I demoed a POC to the Operations team and they loved it. I then did some code review with a few engineers and they said it was solid work. The VP was very supportive of my extra curricular activities and even suggested I look at bigger projects when done. Music to my ears.\n\nRecently the VP left the company to do bigger and better things. I reported to our CTO for a while and recently had a meeting where I was asked if I wanted to become a SWE. I was so excited--I said yes, but that wasn't what she was really asking. She told me she doesn't need SWE, she needs product people. I was given the choice to stay IC PM or become a PM/tech manager. I opted to stay IC PM (she strongly hinted this is what she wanted). I was then put under a new boss who basically has been very against me doing any SWE type work. Said I should be focusing on my PM duties...even though most of the work I do for SWE is on my off hours. My new boss then said they wanted to take my integration and go live with it for our operations team and sell it to other businesses. I'm just not going to be involved in any of the coding for it going forward. I'm to \"valuable\" doing PM work to the point that apparently any coding work I do is just not worth it...even if it's good enough to sell. \n\nNot the greatest experience. Anyways - it's clear I am not going to be able to go into a SWE role where I work now. If I want to do that I'm going to have to find a new job. I am starting to question if pursuing SWE is even worth it. This bias against doing it from my boss and the CTO has been really discouraging to the point that I'm starting to think I might be trying to do the wrong thing. I also see a lot of SWE trying to pivot into PM jobs, especially on blind. When I search (google, reddit, blind) for PM to SWE, I don't see as much results. Obviously I should pursue what I want, it's my life. But I am older (39) and have begun to question whether it makes sense to try and do SWE somewhere else. Especially when the PM work I'm doing now has been pretty successful. \n\nMy questions to you:\n\n1. Is pivoting to SWE at my age and experience a bad idea?\n2. Is it normal for companies to be so against PMs wanting to be doing more hands on type stuff?\n3. I see lots of advice that surmounts to \"leetcode and apply to tech companies\" - is that a valid strategy for me?\n4. Would I qualify for a tech PM role somewhere and is that much different from regular PM work? Would I get a chance to code sometimes?\n5. Is a startup a good idea to get some SWE experience?\n\nAppreciate any feedback.\n\nTLDR: PM at a software company that wants to pivot to SWE, but current company is against it.",

Work is hybrid with two days in office per week. TC ~87k\nThe second is a smaller company in satellite internet and located in California. Work is mostly remote. TC ~115k\n\nCurrently more concerned about how this job can affect future job searches and prospectives more than TC.\n\nI’m thinking that the smaller company can give me more opportunities to work on different projects, but I’m also worried that it’s in a relatively niche industry and will restrict my career growth.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

The reason I took my current role is because I needed a job asap and the offer was pretty decent; but in addition to that, the role was pitched as a relatively even split between production support and software development. As I'm sure no one is surprised, the split is closer to 85% support and 15% development. With the (minimal) coding I do on the job + with what I do at home for fun, I think have kept up most of the skills and knowledge I learnt in college.\n\nI've grown tired production support and would like to transition into software development. What would be the best strategy to accomplish this?\n\nAny advice helps!",

        "text": "##Background\nAlmost 2 years ago, I left my role as an E4,SDE2,SWE3,etc at one of the FAANG companies after having been with the company on a few teams for almost 5 years to go work with the family business and see if it would be a good career-path for my wife and me. I mostly enjoyed the work I was doing before, but this career offered more money, control of schedule, etc. so my wife and I decided to try it out. My parents are the owners and were looking to us as potential successor if we showed the aptitude and wanted it. We gave it a shot and ultimately decided that the family business was not for us.\n\nMy role at the business was a Director role, but it was a fairly small business staff-wise. I was managing 4-8 (non-tech) people depending on the season and my role did involve some IC software development for our in-house systems and companies web-app but I was not doing this work every day and the problems were not to the same caliber as when I was a full-time software engineer. I have also been working on a variety personal projects in my free-time over the past few years as well.\n\n##Questions\nI'm now looking to re-enter the tech world as an IC with a career-path towards Senior+ Developer and am hoping to gather some opinions.\n\n-Am I still competitive? Will a recruiter see my past 2 years experience as a good thing or will it be detrimental on my resume?\n\n-What can I do to prepare for interviews? I've been running through technical interview problems and reviewing algorithms, etc. I also am writing out as many STAR examples as I can think of for behavioral interviews in order to refresh my memory of challenges from my previous roles. Anything else I should do?\n\n-Can I expect to re-enter in the same role or is it likely I'll be downgraded?\n\nI'm really hoping to hear from people who have had a similar experience and were able to successfully re-enter the industry so I can set my expectations.\n\nThanks!",
