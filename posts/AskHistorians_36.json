The next day, they clarified that it was a balloon.  I have found a couple references to that press release but not any further info.  Do we know whether the Army ever actually released a statement with that wording, and what else it said?  After decades of research, FOIA requests, etc, do we know anything about the decision making process that went into that announcement?  I know a lot has been written about this topic with regard to the various balloon programs, so I'm trying to frame this question more about the inner workings of military secrecy at the time and how they approached the press.",

Additionally, Christianity has had a complex relationship with sex throughout history, associating it with sin and shame. This got me thinking: was there ever a period in history when sex was widely accepted and not stigmatized?\n\nI'm interested in learning about a time when people viewed sex as a natural and normal part of life, rather than something that needed to be kept private or hidden. What was the context of this period? What were the cultural, social, and religious attitudes towards sex during that time? Were there any particular cultures or societies that were known for being more accepting of sexuality? \n\nI would love to hear about any examples from history that show a more accepting attitude towards sex, and how this impacted the lives of people at the time.

Rome back than did not exist as one state but of a certain directly \"roman area\", some colonies and other territories and the allied nations of Italy who were sort of under their rule (correct me if I am wrong). I would think that the big landowners who were mostly threatened by this new (or old bill) did not only have possessions on directly roman territory and that the problem was at least on the whole Italian grounds clearly visible. So what did Tiberius have in mind should be part of the reforms?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance!",

It is seemingly less of an emphasis in Christian denominations that originated outside America. For example, things such as Saving Christmas and the [TV Guardian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiXg6H_FycI) would have probably never originated from a denomination like Anglicanism, Catholicism, Orthodoxy, Lutheranism, etc., and as far as I'm aware, neither would the practice of primarily or only listening to CCM rather than listening to multiple genres and not just Christian music.\n\nWhat are the reasons why this emphasis on family-friendly and/or Christian media is particularly pronounced among members of denominations that originated in America, but less so in non-American denominations? For the purposes of this question, groups established outside America but are still part of an American-originating denomination (like Hillsong) count as \"denominations originating in America).",

On the other hand, there are other, equally legitimate historians who view this period in much more sympathetic light and try to justify the actions of Muslim rulers in India through different ways. This is in contrast to, for example, the lost cause myth which is largely considered pseudoscience and lacking in academic rigour.

Here are some sources that repeat the claim:\n\n“More directly relevant to Western tradition is that fish were eaten on the day of Venus in Rome, in commemoration of the goddess and of the deification of yoni, the female genitals. Devout fish-eating is one of the many pagan customs taken over by the church and given a new interpretation, in this case removing the sexual content. ”- Lawrence, Raymond J. “The Fish: A Lost Symbol of Sexual Liberation?” Journal of Religion and Health 30, no. 4 (1991): 311–19. Pg. 313\n\n“In ancient Rome Fridays were known as dies veneris or the Day of Venus, during which fish were “orgiastically” eaten as an aphrodisiac in honor of the goddess, Venus and Aphrodite”- Varner, Gary R. “Sacred Wells: A Study in the History, Meaning, and Mythology of Holy Wells &amp; Waters.” United States: Algora Pub., 2009.

        "text": "At what point in history did the life of an average lay person become documentable? What inspired my question is that I was doing some personal research on a number of 18th and 19th century figures, particularly fur trappers, pirates, and bandits. \n\nThere were quite a number of them like Hugh Glass and Blackbeard whose personal lives and backstories were quite enigmatic and lost to history. Blackbeard in particular was one of the worst offenders. Almost the entirely of his life (including his exact date of birth) prior to taking up piracy is unknown. Even Blackbeard's \"real name\" Edward Teach has been questioned and is speculated to be a pseudonym by scholars. As a side note, the spelling of his alleged surname is also fluid and uncertain, and there are other variations like Thatch, Thache, Theach, and Tack. \n\nPerhaps the only \"fact\" about Blackbeard's early life that historians can state with some confidence, is that he might've been a privateer during the War of Spanish Succession. Even then, the precise details of his service aren't recorded, and there are some specialists who believe that the War of Spanish Succession privateer thought to be Blackbeard could have been an entirely different man. The contemporary accounts mention that Blackbeard was literate, which strongly implies that he came from a wealthy family. Again though, that is only an implication, and it hasn't left a path for researchers to follow.\n\nLikewise, anything about Hugh Glass' life prior to his legendary fight with a bear is also shrouded in mystery. There are legends that he was kidnapped and press ganged into a pirate gang and captured and adopted by the Pawnee, but Glass' biographers believe that those stories are dubious at best. In spite of this, Glass was recorded to have been part of a Pawnee delegation meeting with American officials, so Glass certainly had some sort of relationship with them. \n\nSome contemporary newspaper articles that discussed him mentioned that Glass was born in Pennsylvania to a family of Irish immigrants, but there is no information on his relatives available beyond that. As far as I know, the names of his parents, siblings (if he had any), and other family members, have been lost to the depths of time. There are some reports of Glass having a Pawnee wife, but I don't think that has been fully attested. Glass is believed to have been born in 1783, though any more specific details are also unknown.\n\nHowever, there are many other famous 18th and 19th individuals like George Custer, Edgar Allan Poe, and Charlotte Corday for example that are well documented. There is significant details about their families, birth dates, education, careers, and other life events that are readily available.\n\nAnother thing that I found interesting is that for most of history, literate societies were generally only interested in recording nobles and kings, and commoners were mostly overlooked by the scribes. In contrast in this day of age, just about every one has some sort of paper trail. Most people in the western world have birth certificates, school honor rolls, personal addresses, social media platforms, employment records, criminal records, etc. on hand. The personal history of just about anyone who enters the media spotlight one way or the other (such as Jeffrey Dahmer and Scarlett Johnson for example) can easily be tracked down.\n\nOverall, I'm just wondering when the trend of lay persons being documentable started emerging in history. ",
