His house burned down and he decided he wanted to go for his dream: software engineer. He quit his job and spent the first few months helping his mother out and then started to make his website and resume. Now since he’s done that he’s been hit with rejection after rejection. He refuses to work for anyone local (hates our city). He’s reached a low point. He’s been basically unemployed for a year. Recruiters call him all the time for jobs but doesn’t seem to pan out to really anything. Today he got a rejection email from his dream company and isn’t taking it well.\n\nAny advice for resumes, cover letters, interviews? He wants to work in California/west coast.

The company is medium sized ish (~300-400 employees internationally, with the main headquarters being where I am so we have the majority) and established. I was put on the Mobile app team, even though the only thing experience I have is one Android app class project back in college, because I was told it's a UI heavy project (and I have a lot of experience in full-stack/front-end). \n\nI spent the first couple of days setting up my machine, building/deploying the apps, and tinkering with them. The rest of my first week was spent on a business trip with my team, so I didn't touch code. \n\nI've read a lot that for most first time developers, it takes weeks and even months to get acquainted with the code base, and working with three different mobile platforms seems to make it more daunting (we are using Xamarin for cross development, but that is something I am also completely new to, forget the fact that I only have minor Android experience). I'm assigned under a principal developer but for the most part am left to learn and understand on my own (which I guess is normal), and yes I do ask questions here and there but for the amount I don't know I wasn't even given a high level walkthrough of the codebase (I barely figured out why everything was in C# and not native languages and that a lot of the backend logic in one place amongst all three platforms). \n\nI also hear that a lot of first time developers start off with bug fixes, and it takes them months for them to tackle on their first projects. But we just had my first sprint planning meeting since I joined, and they talked about having me implement Touch ID/Face ID authentication for the iOS app. They asked me how I was doing, and I told them I was still learning, ramping up, and getting acquianted with the code base, but it still looks this will be my very first task assigned to me this week.\n\nI msg'd my PM about this, saying I wanted to know exactly what is expected of me this week, since I \"am just starting to get really acquianted with the code base, learning new technologies, and have minor Mobile experience\", and she just said \"learn the structure of the project and implement Touch ID/Face ID feature\". \n\nAfter doing some research, it seems like this is relatively simple to do on its own, but I'm panicking because I need to know how it fits in with the the rest of the daunting code base. I'm very very overwhelmed and don't know what to do or where to start. I don't know if I can learn everything AND implement a feature in a week. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.\n ",

That's what I want most. Can a software engineering degree get me a cybersecurity job?

        "text": "Cross posted in /cscareerquestions\n\nThis might sound more like a college question, but ultimately its intended to be a 'career path' set of questions, so hopefully this fits in the sub properly.\n\nWhy don't you just go to University? -I'm 33. I'm married. I have a mortgage. I have to work. Traditional school will not be an option for me. I will have to work and do class simultaneously. I'm a blue collar guy who wants to transfer into the white collar world for stability, benefits, brain stimulation, continued education, and less wear and tear on my body as I age.\n\nI will have to choose online school of some sort. Reviews are mixed for online education, to say the least, but that's not really what this post is about, thought I'm touching on it. Some questions I have:\n\nI found several Reddit posts from people who were in Software Engineering programs online, such ASU Online, but not any posts from people who had graduated. Did you graduate from an online program? Associates? Bachelors? From where? What did you like/dislike about the program/school?\n\nWill a 2 year program feed well into a 4 year program or is it better to go straight for the 4 year program? It seems from the outside looking in a 2 year program might actually get into the nitty gritty of the career quicker, but not include as much GE. If you transfer to a 4 year, will you have to almost 'pause' the career classes to take math, physics, etc?\n\nIs someone with an Associates, but pursing a BS, more likely to get a career in their field than someone who is 2 years into a Bachelors and still learning? I'm not looking for huge money 2 years in. Though I want to be eligible for an, at least, semi-related job or internship to start gaining actual work experience in the white collar, tech world, as soon as possible.\n\nMy biggest struggle right now is not as much where to enroll, as I'll have to research and figure that out, but whether I should make better money blue collaring-ing for a while yet (probably less than 40hrs per week, thus having more time to study), or take the pay cut and get right to learning an office environment (at likely 40hrs per week for some crappy CSR job, and being busier morning to night).\n\nThank you for any input, and if you have questions about my situation, please ask. I'm 15 years removed from school and I've never worked in an office environment, so its possible I'm missing important questions.",

Also it led me into the wanting to learn more and other languages, i still work hard on my python and i am starting to learn other languages to do other tasks. I am into many domains, machine learning, web, apps. I always learn more even tho i know i should focus hard on one thing but here is the problem.\n\nI am very uncertain about my current degree if i want to land a job into the IT domain.. Maybe software engineering or something related, something that lead me to code, think about its structure and solve problems. I like maths, physics and the very few computer courses i get at my school. But will a generalist engineer degree be a benefit or a waste of time if in the end I want to land a job in IT/software engineer/... ? I still have 3 and a half year to get my degree and in that period i can still do a lot of stuff, get a lot of projects done in that period (especially because the last year is an internship).\n\nSorry for Beeing a little messy about my ideas and maybe doing a lot of mistakes in my writing. \n\nWhat should i do ? Thanks a lot in advance for your answers.",

        "text": "**M.S. Software Engineering, given a set of C.S. elective classes, which C.S. classes would benefit a software engineering student the most?**\n\n\nSo in middle school I was introduce to True Basic (learned about loops, conditional statements and other stuff), graduated high school, then joined the Army as a lab tech and forgot about CS stuff.  Got out of the Army and got a B.S. in Maths. While getting that Maths degree math students were required to take CS I. While taking CS I, I was like \"Ohh yea, I like this stuff.\" So a CS minor was added to my degree.\n\n\nI know which electives I want to take: Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Mining. My math capstone was on Eigenfaces - machine vision, I mainly used [this](http://www.face-rec.org/algorithms/PCA/jcn.pdf) and was left a bit thirsty for knowledge on machine learning.\n\n\nFrom what I'm reading on line, I think, I should be taking (1)CS-631-data management systems, (2)CS-656-Internet and higher layer protocols, (3)CS-633-Distributed System, and (4)CS-602-Java Programing.\n\n\nSo again, I would humbly ask the opinions of those whom are currently working in the field or who have already graduated and have some knowledge of which classes have helped them the most in their day to day endeavors. \n\n\nI understand that depending on where someone may work what is most important may differ. However, surely there must exist some generalities among them. For example, most data is stored somewhere on some sql or no-sql server that is why CS-631-data management system is the number 1 class I think I should be taking.\n\n\nAny and all answers are welcomed and thank you for your time. \n\n\n[ NJIT - Software Engineering ](http://catalog.njit.edu/graduate/computing-sciences/computer-science/software-engineering-ms/)\n\n**Required Courses :**\n\n* CS 684    Software Testing and Quality Assurance\n* CS 685    Software Architecture\n* CS 683    Software Project Management\n* IS 676    Requirements Engineering\n* CS 673    Software Design and Production Methodology\n* CS 700B    Master's Project\n\n**5 electives :**\n\n* CS 602    Java Programming\n* CS 630    Operating System Design\t\n* CS 631    Data Management System Design\t\n* CS 632    Advanced Database System Design\t\n* CS 633    Distributed Systems\t\n* CS 634    Data Mining\t\n*CS 635    Computer Programming Languages\t\n* CS 634    Data Mining\t\n* CS 652    Computer Networks-Architectures, Protocols and Standards\t\n* CS 656    Internet and Higher-Layer Protocols\n* CS 659    Image Processing and Analysis\t\n* CS 670    Artificial Intelligence\t\n* CS 675    Machine Learning\t\n* CS 696    Network Management and Security\n* IS 690    Web Services and Middleware\t\n* IS 663    System Analysis and Design\t\n* EM 636    Project Management\t\n* EM 637    Project Control\t\n* MGMT 620    Management of Technology\n",

        "text": "I always thought that as a new grad with an engineering degree different than CS, having 3-4 programming projects (ranging from AI to games implementing design patterns) under my belt, I would easily start as a junior developer and learn the best practices there. However things turned out to be different.\n\nI decided to go to grad school when a nice project presented itself, however project funding got cancelled and I was left with almost no income, and no prospect of success there. I left the place and started as an intern at a big company. Job turned out to be completely different what it was stated in the posting, yet I was somewhat in a desperate situation, so I decided to took the job and keep applying.\n\n\nI do get to code at my current job, however I am still not in production. Almost all of my coding is self initiated, and I try to look busy so that I don't get dumped with a sales or marketing duty. However, most of the stuff I write is just simple like CRUD apps. I don't get to implement anything \"efficient\", I don't need to. \n\n\nDuring interviews I am asked whether I can implement something efficiently or not. I am of course aware of data structures and their time complexities etc. However say, when it comes to retrieving data from a db, what is considered as efficient? In what context? Who asks a new grad applying to junior position to write \"efficient\" code? I am not a \"brute force\" guy, yet I do not know the best practices in certain contexts either.\n\n\nWithout the job I don't get to learn best practices, without best practices I am not able to get the job. (I mean I also think that if I am going to build something of production quality in my own time, I would start my own business, not put it in my CV and keep looking for jobs!)\n\n\nSo, my question is how to learn best practices at home ?",
