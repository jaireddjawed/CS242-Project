        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/10q2rka/if_the_concepts_of_project_orion_were_proven_why/",
        "text": "So I got to thinking about Project Orion, which for the uninitiated was the USAF's attempt to build a spacecraft using nuclear bombs as propulsion that was only stopped because of nuclear test treaties. The research was done and the concepts were proven complete with scale models (using conventional explosives) used for presentations to congress, etc.\n\nSo if we can seemingly easily come up with materials for the pressure plate that can withstand the ablation of a nuclear explosion, why not just simplify the entire thing and create a canon that can shoot raw materials into space? You would presumably have to use far less material from a single explosion as opposed to the thousands they were planning for Orion, right?\n\nCould a single explosion put enough usable material on to a suborbital trajectory worth retrieving with say, Starship? I just can't help but think this kind of solution could help jump-start, say, something a space-mining operation.\n\nWouldn't the cost per kg be super cheap? Seems like a pretty convenient way to get really heavy things (mostly) to orbit like say, water. In a more peaceful time something like this could even be a joint mission between the great powers. \n\nSo what am I missing? Google, the Wikipedia entry for Space Guns, coming up empty. Is there something obvious I'm not considering like, \"ya but if you screw it up you now have 10t of raw iron hitting St. Louis at 30 km/s\" type things?\n\nOk so that's my ramble question I thought could be interesting enough to post on r/Space please don't hurt me, I have kids, I'll go run and hide now.",

        "text": "We all know what the Fermi Paradox is. It is a conflict between the high statistical probability of aliens existing and the lack of evidence for such aliens existing.\n\nSome of the answers for the Fermi Paradox include life being rarer than we thought, aliens destroying themselves once they have sufficiently advanced technology, them not using radio signals, the Dark Forest hypothesis, or them being too far away.\n\nI honestly (in my personal opinion) think that the simplest solution is often the correct solution. The simplest on this list of possible solutions is obviously, aliens being too far away.\n\nThe math itself says it. Aliens should exist. Space is just too big. Even if abiogenesis is rare, there should still be at least ONE other planet with civilization on it, out there somewhere in the universe. I personally think that it isn't, given how quick (on a geological scale) abiogenesis occured on Earth after it became habitable, the abundance of organic molecules in space, and of course, the vastness of the universe, the abundance of water and oxygen even on a molecular level, and the hundreds of billions of planets in our galaxy. Abiogenesis could be rare though despite all of these possible indicators that it isnt, but for the sake of this post, lets assume it isnt rare.\n\nOur current telescopes cant measure the temperature of a planet, calculate its mass, or see whether or not it has an atmosphere or not, if a planet is more than 1000 light years away. We cant even get an actual photo of a moderately distant exoplanet (e.g 20 light years away). We have discovered planets like Kepler 442b that might be habitable but we cant actually see if they are habitable or not, because they are too far away for practical observation.\n\nNow to even add, space is so vast, and search efforts such as SETI are not even able to scan a fixed location in the sky for months. There are countless stars in just our night sky, and we cannot listen each one for radio signals for even a month, let alone stars that are 1000 or more light years away \n\nIf we don't see obvious signs of life (or advanced civilizations) within our telescopic viewing or measuring range, aliens could simply be outside this range. Math says that aliens should exist. Neptune was discovered by math, and the math wasn't wrong because it said that Neptune should exist, through countless observations of its gravitational effects. We before the time of Neptune's discovery, struggled to find evidence of the existence of Neptune through our telescopes, but it existed, and we found it. This could be the same thing for aliens.  Given the vast number of possibilities, the amount of planets that could be orbiting in the habitable zone, the abundance of organic molecules in space, and just to add to this list, the strongest candidate for an alien signal ever,  the infamous Wow Signal, a radio signal that displayed almost all the characteristics of an extraterrestial source, aliens should exist in our galaxy, or atleast in the universe.\n\nAliens could exist but they are just simply too far away to be detected. This could be the simple (and probably correct) answer to the Fermi Paradox, Now, of course there is the possibility that abiogenesis is for some unknown reason very rare, or that aliens destroy themselves once that get sufficiently advanced. This post assumes abiogenesis is not rare, and that aliens can overcome their own destruction. We simply must seriously upgrade our telescopes and instruments. They could be even in our night sky right now, but we simply cant measure the habitability at all of their very planets.",

        "text": "So I was camping in Maine in my family‚Äôs usual spot. We decided one of those nights around probably 9pm to use some sparklers out on the gravel driveway that our cars were parked in. About half way through, all of a sudden, a meteor flys directly above us. Not anything like those falling pieces of debris burning up that I‚Äôve seen on video or on dashcam. This meteor was big, and big/close enough to be able to see visible craters and details engraved in the meteor. Although I‚Äôm aware it definitely wasn‚Äôt that close, it seemed the meteor was only 2 large trees above our head. Granted, I was younger when I witnessed this. So I‚Äôm unsure if I remember the meteor being loud, or if it was burning up, or how fast it was traveling (it felt much slower than a shooting star though, which further convinced me this thing was big or far away). However, I was old enough to be aware and know for a fact I truly did see this. Thankfully, to credit my sanity, about 6 people in our campsite also saw this meteor, including my mom and Aunt. I only wish we got it on camera or recording. I can‚Äôt remember exactly, but I must‚Äôve been somewhere from 10-12 years old (19 now). I don‚Äôt believe in UFO‚Äôs, ghosts, monsters, God, or anything else that people might use to explain it. But, it was so incredible and seems like the type of thing you‚Äôd see in a movie or book, and it was so extraordinary I‚Äôm still unconvinced it‚Äôs something that actually happens.\n\nAnyways, it‚Äôs probably the most incredible thing I‚Äôve ever witnessed and I‚Äôm convinced it was a 1 in a billion experience. What I basically want to know from this post is how rare this actually is, and if there‚Äôs any photo/video recordings of an event like this.",

        "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI‚Äôve gotten my son hooked on all things Space and rockets and after watching the Artemis 1 launch he really wants to see 2 or 3 in person, the only thing is we live in California. Artemis was scrubbed so many times then launched in the middle of the night so it just seems out of reach for travelers unless you get really lucky. Has anyone every traveled to a launch, did you get opened plane tickets, does Kennedy space center just move your reservation for the next launch date or just a refund and restart? I know there‚Äôs no way to account for scrubs but just wondering if anyone had successfully done this and if you‚Äôve learned anything I might not know as a first timer? Thanks!",
