        "text": "m16 here some context i go to a smaller school and it’s different to regular school i have one class in the morning from 9 to 10 am and i usually leave after that cuz my i can’t help staying there with all the people even tho there’s like no one there sometimes but last semester i was in a class that was at 1 to 2 pm and it was a pretty small class there was only like 5 people in the class and one of them caught my eye and ig ever since i’ve wanted to talk to them and see what happens but now i never see them because i’m guessing their class after mine and we get a hour break in between them and like i said i leave right after my class because i can’t stay their without my social anxiety making me feel like im being watched also \n\nidk why i’m telling you this but when i was in grade 8 2019 i liked this girl and back then ig u could say my social anxiety wasn’t too bad so i was actually going to but the night i was gonna talk to her at a halloween party but my friend was being an asshole and kept going up to here and telling her i was gonna talk to her and stuff so i didn’t talk to her until 2021 because i overthinked that fuck out if it and thought she wouldn’t say anything which she didn’t say anything to me when i said hi which i don’t blame her for but from oct 2019 till April 2022 i was basically obsessed with her i thought abt her every single day until i finally said fuck her and moved on \n\n\nback to the present i’ve posted on here before abt this but it was when i was confident i was gonna actually say something to her but that was in jan it’s march now it’s like sure i could wait around after my class to talk to her but i feel like that would be creepy and weird and there’s people everywhere during that time and ion wanna do it in front of people and i’m scared she’s gonna do the same thing my old crush did even tho she probably doesn’t even know i exist idk there’s so much i overthink abt i hate it so much i low-key hate my life it not even just because of this it’s because i let my anxiety make all my decisions i mind can’t take risks i wanna take risks but when they are there i can’t force myself to go thru with it \n\n\ni’m sorry i’m just rambling but literally i’ve told no one abt it because i told everyone how i felt abt my old crush and i felt it made me like i was never going to talk to her but i did it and my overthinking was right and i wanna talk to this girl because i had hope and i still have a tiny bit of hope left \n\nig i want advice but also just wanted to get this stupid shit off my mind thanks for reading if you did i actually really appreciate it",

It felt like I could see right through them. I don’t feel this way about all women, just them. I distanced myself from them for a bit just to think about my feelings, cuz maybe I was projecting insecurities. Then I tried talking to them in class after a couple days and we had a normal conversation, laughing etc, but then after that, I stopped going up to them first, and all communication stopped. None of them ever tried to make an effort to try and talk to me again. But yet they always talk to other girls in class and try to recruit them in their little clique. It’s so awkward in class, like they don’t acknowledge me at all and act like we don’t even know each other.  It’s weird. Did I do something wrong ? I just don’t like chasing people that’s why I stopped making the first move.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/11g7f80/3_essential_traits_of_the_greatest_active/",
        "text": "Active listening is used by the greatest conversationalists to get the other party to comfortably open up. \n\nIf you study the best podcast hosts like Lex Friedman and Joe Rogan, or great talk show hosts like David Letterman, you notice they all have their own unique style.\n\nHowever, they also share common traits that get their guest to get comfortable and open up A LOT in a very public way. \n\nAfter countless hours of studying these greats, and doing 43 podcast interviews myself, I found  3 essential traits they all have in common. \n\nI'll go over the trait, how it helps you with active listening, and how you can practice it on your own (to become a better listener). \n\nThe traits are:\n\n1. Curiosity\n2. Open Mindedness\n3. Present in-the-moment \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Curiosity**\n\nCuriosity is an itch.\n\nA desire, similar to hunger, but instead of food you crave knowledge. Curiosity is important to active listening because it helps you endlessly craft questions to keep the conversation going.\n\nCan't listen if there's nothing to listen to.\n\nThe problem with most ppl listening is they lose interest *really quickly* to what the other person is saying. If you approach conversations with a curious \"what can I learn from this person\" mindset, you'll have plenty to talk about.\n\nCuriosity can be grown through something my friend invented called ***The Curiosity Game***. \n\nThe rules are simple: engage in conversation with someone for as long as you can *without* talking about yourself. You are only allowed to ask questions about the other person and comment on what they said. Easy mode is with your family and friends.\n\nFor a real challenge try this with strangers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Open Mindedness**\n\nOpenmindedness is the readiness to consider something without preconceived notions.\n\nIn other words, enter a conversation with non-judgment. This is *really hard* to do because most people don't know where their unconscious judgments lie. Curiosity helps a ton. \n\nIt's hard to bring your judgments in when you're unattached to the outcome of the questions. \n\nYou can tell someone is open-minded when they don't get angry when they're wrong. Holding onto your beliefs is a huge ego-centered thing. That's usually where people go wrong. they believe their beliefs are the right beliefs.\n\nBeing open-minded is having your beliefs but accepting that other beliefs could be right too. \n\nThis is important when listening because a conversation could *quickly* turn into an argument when fighting for who's right.\n\nA fun exercise to open your open-mindedness and challenge your beliefs is to branch out of your usual genres.\n\nTake music or movies for example. If you always \"HATE\" on country music or horror movies, give the genre a try. \n\nStart with time-tested classics, it's easier. Trust me. Try focusing in on what you *do* like about the genre (instead of why it sucks). Who knows. \n\nMaybe you'll be a fan\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Present in-the-moment**\n\nPresence in the moment is a powerful trait.\n\nNot just for active listening, but in most things in life. What it means is to be aware of what's going on in the here and now. Not to be sucked in your mind's musings or playing around on your phone.\n\nTo be totally aware of where you are, how you're feeling, and who you're talking to.\n\nIt takes a lot of concentration and focus to build this up. How does it help to listen you ask? Great question! \n\nHow the fuck can you pay attention to another person if you're off diddling in lala land?\n\nYa can't. \n\nPaying attention is the most important part of active listening. It's also one of the toughest. However, there is a shortcut. You can combine curiosity and open-mindedness to be in the moment for conversations.\n\nHere's how:\n\nCuriosity = genuine interest. When you're curious about something, you tend to hone in and pay deep attention to what's going on.\n\nOpen-mindedness = ok with wherever the conversation goes. The person could be talking about Galapagos turtles or Satanic rituals but it doesn't matter, you don't judge them for it. You, instead, are interested and ask more questions. \n\nBefore you know it you're having a full-blown hour-long conversation and you soaked up every minute of it.\n\nSome exercise for presence is, you guessed it, mindfulness meditation.\n\nSit down and focus on your breath.\n\nCount 1, breathe in, **pause****,** breathe out, pause, count 2...\n\nFor 100 breaths. Your mind will wander, but that's ok. Bring it back to the breath. \n\nSomewhere between #40-60 you start feeling a fantastic sense of calm and focus in the moment.",

        "text": "My brother has a 5 month old and my mom\nkept telling me they’re looking for a babysitter when my sister in law goes back to work. I told her I wanted to do it and she said she’ll talk to them. She said they said yeah. Apparently she knew for a couple months my sister in law hired her best friend instead. My mom kept making me think I had the job and then tells me a couple weeks before I thought I was supposed to start, “she changed her hours, they don’t need a sitter anymore”.  Okay that’s fine.\n\nBut then I find out a few weeks back, SIL had actually hired someone else a couple months before that. I think my mom didn’t want to hurt my feelings because she knew how much I wanted to do it. I’m not close with my brother and SIL so I wasn’t surprised she picked her friend over me, I just wish my mom told me the truth. Then when I ask why she lied she just yelled at me for “not knowing what I’m talking about” getting overly defensive and saying I wouldn’t have been good at taking care of her anyways. \n\nMy mom always does this whenever I try to talk to her about something she did that bothered me. I did think it was weird that whenever I helped my mom babysit she never really let me do anything and would take over, even though she claimed I was going to be the babysitter. She would stick her head out the door to watch me when I was walking her in her stroller in the hallway, like she doesn’t trust me. I would have gotten better at it, I just wasn’t used to taking care of a baby. The job is also only 2 days a week.\n\nApparently my aunt also said something about a family I used to babysit for, saying I’m rude and kept quitting on them. I think this is unfair because my aunt never asked me what happened. Those kids were violent and the parents did nothing about it. They’ve gone through like 6 nannies in the past 3/4 years. My family doesn’t know what I went through, I would come home and cry in my room with some new fresh injury everyday. Being a nanny was a dream job and I gave up working with kids after this. Sometimes I wish I just never got involved with those people. The mom misled me the second time I worked for them, and didn’t tell me she moved but didn’t switch the kids schools until after I agreed to come back. I was exhausted from early morning hours and all the driving and quit after a month \n\nThen last week my mom told me the other sitter quit because she already has a baby and two babies was too much for her, so I can do it if I want. I just found out this morning that that wasn’t true either, the sitter is still babysitting for them. My brother only needed me for a hour or so a couple times a week while he walks the dog (he works from home now) Which they changed the dogs daycare center so they don’t need me for that anymore either. \n\nI can’t help but to look back on the times I babysat and go over how dumb I looked, that I don’t even know how to handle a baby. Plus interactions with my SIL where I probably came off awkward and made her think I’m weird (I’m a really quiet socially anxious person). I also went to a vocational high school for early education. I kept looking back at how I always got stuck with the jobs like preparing snack and cleaning because the kids obviously preferred the more outgoing students more. I don’t really know what I was thinking working with kids. Looking back on times where I didn’t know how to handle something so I’d wait for a teacher to help, I must have always looked so dumb and clueless. But I felt I would have been better with a baby, especially if the baby is my niece. This probably sounds stupid but my niece is likely grow up seeing her moms friend as more of an aunt than me. I feel like I was a social hermit for so long I ruined my chance at a normal relationship with my family",

        "text": "TL/DR:\n\nbrain freezes up over the simplest of things, including reciting single sentences (even multiple times) and I do not know why this is happening. It is kinda shooting me in the foot everywhere, socially and academically. Advice needed\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**long answer:**\n\nSo. This is going to be a very long post as I try to give as much detail as I can, in hopes of working to the root of the problem.\n\nIn almost every situation, my brain freezes up. This is not usually social interaction with friends unless I am put on the spot, but every time I need to speak to someone in anything other than a casual, flowing conversation, my brain freezes, and I lose the ability to construct sentences.\n\nsome examples include:\n\n* typical conversational convention (E.G introducing myself, asking someone how their day was and being proactive asking questions)\n* giving a 'brief' of a task to someone\n* improvisatory speech during public speaking (like teaching)\n* talking to anyone in a formal manner, including:\n   * interviews, \n   * giving and receiving feedback, \n   * speaking to important people, \n   * speaking to people I don't know\n* having to getting angry or tell someone off\n\nand a collection of other examples.\n\nif I prepare for it, memorise sections or create materials to read off, effectively scripting myself, I do brilliantly. I even sound confident in all the above scenarios. I just kinda lose the ability to improvise speech, and I don't know why. I have made myself extremely over-animated and quite odd, specifically so that this is what people notice rather than the whole speech thing, but  this doesn't work in all scenarios obviously.\n\nA secondary effect I've noticed, is when I'm required to carry out a task, I often find I have to ask way too many questions about it, and choose not to take the initiative unless it is a task of my own creation. I think this is because I feel I can't get their vision wrong.\n\nso if anyone has any ideas about things I can do to mitigate this, that would be great.",

        "text": "Recently my 13-year old daughter and friend were turned away from and local easement way to public access roads, trails, and sidewalks in a quaint suburban town. To keep this post short and manageable, I'll cut to the chase. Yes, I did the research to confirm what we'd already correctly presumed. This property is owned by the local water district which includes adjacent and abutting roads and ways. We use this trail often as do many others. It is a public road with a public sidewalk leading to the easement. This particular part of the neighborhoods has shown evidence of territorial guardianship for their dead-end, yet public road. \nFurthermore, Maine's implied land use laws permit public crossing of private property unless posted or informed by the landowner.\nOn this particular day, we permitted our daughter and friend to take a walk and of course to use the paths. (Our road which is a main throughway, without sidewalks and is the entrance to all these neighborhoods.) They returned 10 minutes later, shook, and informs us that the woman, whose house abuts the 15' wide easement stopped them, asked where they lived, then informed them that they can't use the path. I immediately suited up and walked there myself only to see woman leaving the neighborhood as evident by the way she looked at me from her passing car. She waved to me, not sure why honestly. I gave her a curious look, waved back, but the visage on my face must not have been one of pure joy.\nHearing that my daughter is now frightened to cross the easement alone, I want to reach out to the lady. I want to let her know how she hurt them. I want to let her know that she has no right in this situation. I want to let her know we will continue to use it like any other member of the public with the same rights and she has no place to stop anyone from crossing. She is not the landowner nor representative. Would you write a letter? What would you say? What shouldn't I say? Should I merely monitor the situation closely, such as walking my daughters there on the next few occasions and guide them through. And possibly speak to the woman kindly, if and when she interferes?",

        "text": "So, for all my life I’ve been the biggest outcast everywhere. Even when I was nice to everyone I was mistreated. This was all rooted in my childhood where I would constantly get shamed just existing probably. School ain’t no better. I would constantly get used by others. My only chance for a change in the environment was a better, more highly competitive private school. I tried my best and did everything in my power to reach that level and my dream became true. I expected people there to be better since it is a high ranking institution with students who get into the eminent Ivy League. Wrong, again… I got treated like a loser again by everyone even more. People knew each other private elementary schools and courses I could never attend. It was a place with overachievers. I was a no one in their eyes. I had no social status, nothing special about me other than being the best in one category they simply don’t care about. I was called pretentious and dumb. Academics were difficult with my previous educational experience and lack of time-management skills. One day I was so sick of people talking shit about m, that I became the biggest fucking asshole towards everyone who ignored or spoke badly of me. I always responded very sassy with a nuance of sarcasm and self irony. However, things got out of touch… I lost all kind of control over my “assholeness” to the extent to which from “ mature and quiet” I got on my project grade rubric - 1 point ( slightly snarky). I called a classmate, who openly insulted me the previous semester “a Christmas tree”, and the idiot did not respond in any way shape or form other than spying on me and my friend’s conversation. I was told that is a horribly rude comment. I did not give a single fuck. Before used to mistreat me very evidently and now they did not. I act as if I feel overly confident. Yes, I love being unaffected by others opinion; however, this behaviour ruined my friendships. My best friend at school has a crush on one of the popular guys and they personally hate me. It got so out of hand that she started to wish I was sick so as to have a chance. She began talking well of people she hates for the sake of “fitting in”.  And, …. It worked. Now I am socially ostracised, I mean I can die and nobody would go to my 🪦. The sad part is that I feel protected as my assholen alter ego, but my heart hurts me for the revenge I successfully performed, yet let me devastated. I cannot fix myself now I feel the darkness of my soul and I feel addicted. I cannot go somewhere without this mask because I feel vulnerable without it. Been used to many times to know people caputalize you to get ahead and they leave you hanging. They previously had the audacity to insult me and this capacity is limited. I prefer to ruin my own life instead of feeling like others do. I want to fix myself, but can’t. I could try to be kinder, yet I don’t think it is worth it, knowing how people and my brain work. I am naturally this one person you dislike just from looking at me. I immediately become an outsider everywhere I step. I think about suicide sometimes. I cannot imagine how am I going to survive the rest of my life without any sort of company and only hate. I don’t know, I should probably drink and get high more. Recently I got addicted to doing homework and barely sleep. My life officially sucks, but making the comparative I felt better as a non-asshole, but stronger as an asshole. Do you thinkI should return to a non-asshole? Thank you for reading this post!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/11fzfdu/how_to_be_interesting/",
        "text": "  \n\nHello everyone. The things i wrote are notes from an italian video ([L'importanza di essere interessanti - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWtbV2sFQuo)). Being interesting will make people look for you. It’s sort of like magic and what is incredible is that with effort you can always learn it. I hope my english and what i wrote will be comprehensible but i suggest you all to look at the video with subtitles if necessary.\n\n**Be a passionate person:** when you start a hobby do you expect it to show itself magically to be your vocation or you invest time, energy and get passioned about it? You decide consciously to get passionate about it.\n\n* What if i am an introvert, timid? The people who are naturally more outgoing and extrovert will find it easier to be passionate about something. But here is the secret. Deciding to be passionate will change your nature and form your character. \n\n**Feed your natural curiosity:** as a human species we developed cognition which makes us able to go over apparences and find the true mechanisms that regulate life. \n\n* Curiosity is a muscle. It needs to get trained\n* If i decide to get passionate about something (see above) i stimulate my curiosity and i start to study or train for the activity i chose\n* People will look for someone who shows himself by his passions. If i study to appear someone i am not i may look savant, erudit but also annoying and useless\n* Tip on how to be curious: realize that you are ignorant. When you choose a passion there will always be new things to learn about it\n\n**Find your stile:** i mean this in every aspect of your life whether it be linguistically, aesthetically etc.. show yourself for what you are. \n\n* Take care on how you appear to people. That is the first thing they are gonna notice. \n* Be careful. Appareances are important but not so much that you have to lie about them. If you don’t really know who you are (i will make a post on how to find who you are) you will try to omologate to how socially you think is acceptable but sooner or later you will realize you wasted time because you are not that thing\n* Remember, interesting people will build their style based on their intentions and not on other people expectations\n\n**Keep your word:** there can not be any kind of interest for someone who is unreliable. People get interested in you because they think that under the surface you have something to show. \n\n* An interesting person is someone who is coherent about their language, perceptions and style. Being coherent about what you show and what you are indicates that you respect yourself\n* If i respect the goals i take on, if i respect what i say i will do, people will be interested because what they see matches what you are\n\n**Be interested in other people:** this is the last point but it well may be the first. You have to be interested in what other people say. When in a conversations you have got to be able to ask the right questions. To listen. If your friend is talking about a problem in his life listen and ask more about it. Don’t talk about yourself trying to relate. Try to ask more about the thing is talking about because you wanna know more. \n\n* Listening to other is essential to understand yourself\n* Not interesting is someone who listens only waiting for his turn to talk",

I asked one about how Hogwarts Legacy and he told me he's still trying to finish it up and that it's really good, then he asked me if I like RPG games. Of course I do, and I asked him if it's more of an RPG. We exchange a few things, but I had to grab something. I come back and he's talking to another coworker about the Elden Ring expansion pack coming out, and he seemed more interested in talking about it with them. Told them my love of the game, even modeled my character after Anton Chigurh (you can even find it by searching on google Elden Ring Anton Chigurh, old reddit post). Anyway, they didn't want to go any further talking about these things. Maybe I'm expecting too much, especially at work but this was end day, and coworkers never seem to want to really get into anything. \n\nThere are some things about me I think rub people the wrong way. Such as having a hard time recalling things, I haven't really talked to people in depth for years, and the way I sound or just my demeanor comes off too casual or something. I don't know it's hard to pin down, I've been there for about 6 month and haven't talked much, maybe they seem weirded out that I'm finally opening up or something...\n\nPeople show interest, but after a while they realize something about me they don't want to further connect with. It really sucks, it's why I stopped trying to begin with, and if I keep trying it's just going to annoy them and make it worse. I imagine they think \"he's a nice enough guy, hard worker, but I'm just not interested\".",

        "text": "I’ve had self-esteem issues (along with depression, anxiety and other things) for a long time, but I know my capacity for confidence is always there. Recently my confidence has been shot. It’s often felt like it was at an all time low. But I still did my normal thing of going out and doing my best to interact with others. Last week felt different. The self-doubt was still there, but I suddenly felt more confident in myself when it came to engaging with others. It almost felt easy (if you are confident, it is easy). It wasn’t an unfamiliar feeling, but it’s one that I seem to have trouble channeling on a consistent basis.\n\nThis week, I feel like I’ve reverted back to before. I’m timid and unsure of myself, and it’s infuriating since I know I’m capable of feeling confident in my self. But… it just isn’t there right now. I really don’t know how the fuck this works. I’m currently on five different medications (I know, not ideal and not the plan, I’m weening off of one right now and hopefully more in the future) and I’m also doing neurofeedback, so if my shifts in self-esteem and confidence have anything to do with any of these things, I wouldn’t know which thing since there are too many variables. I wanna say perhaps it’s sleep, but I usually feel sleep-deprived. It just pisses me off since confidence is also something I need to do well at my new job. It can’t just come and go, it needs to stay. I understand emotions fluctuate and no one can feel good 100% of the time, but with something like this it would just be nice if I could retain the confidence that comes to me for whatever reason so I can go about my life with some hope. \n\nThat is all.",

So I thought I'd try it out for one, I built the confidence to go outside for a walk because I've been stuck inside working remotely. I usually walk on the same path every other day, it was nice out so it was a good day for a walk. On the path I was walking on I saw two women who looked around my age, in their twenties. I didn't stare to avoid looking creepy, but when we did get closer and passed I made eye contact with one of them and gave them a friendly smile, she didn't smile back, but that's okay. I kept walking, and didn't turn around or do anything, I just kept walking. Then as I was walking back (since the path I was on goes in a circle) I see the same women coming back towards me, and as soon as they saw me they turned the other way and ran to the right where I couldn't see them anymore. I guess I really am a horrible person, I can't even make a friend in real life or smile at anyone because they think I have bad intentions, I can't interact with people without coming across as a monster that people want to avoid at all costs. It feels really shitty man, sometimes I don't see the point in even trying anymore if everyone thinks I'm this bad person.",

        "text": " I have a colleague who has helped me a lot at work, but we had some misunderstandings recently. I asked him to help me with a speech, but he told me I should do it myself, although he could assist me. During the presentation, he started speaking instead of sharing his screen, and I didn't interrupt him. When our boss asked about it later, I explained the situation but may have come across as trying to shift the blame. Since then, my colleague has been angry with me, and I feel like he dislikes me now. I apologized to him, but I guess it didn't seem sincere enough, and I think he may still feel that I am interfering with his work. \n\nI want to improve my relationship with my colleague by helping him, but he is very independent and dislikes others getting involved in his work. He often works very late but still manages to help me with my work, which makes me feel guilty. Despite his willingness to assist me, I feel like I am imposing on him and that I should be doing more to help him instead. I am not sure how to proceed as I do not want to offend him or come across as ungrateful for his assistance, but I also want to ease the burden on him and show my appreciation for his efforts.\n\nI don't enjoy socializing, so I lack a lot of social experience. What can I do to address this issue?",

Before surgery they also used these elastics to close my big extraction gaps and as the gaps closed the wire would get longer and longer at the brackets on my molar teeth, which is exactly how it's meant to work. Then just before surgery they snipped this excess wire and closed down the brackets on my molar teeth so all the teeth would then be held exactly in that position for surgery and wouldn't be able to move at all. Now today they put elastics back on to close any little gaps left, but they left the molar brackets closed, so I thought to myself how can the remaining tooth gaps close if the brackets on my molars are closed and not allowing excess wire to pass through as the tooth gaps slowly close from the pressure of the elastics?\n\nUsually in situations like that I won't say anything as its so hard to explain what I'm talking about but this time I did ask and my ortho gave me such a confused look, I felt like such an idiot trying to explain without having orthodontic terminology and it reinforces why I never usually ask specific questions like that.\n\nDoes anyone feel the same way?",
