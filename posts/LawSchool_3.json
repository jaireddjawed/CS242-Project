It‚Äôs an in-person job. \n\nI still have yet to decide, but I need to decide soon.\n\nPro of returning to the last firm: I‚Äôll have  a great sense of familiarity with the work and it will b remote.\n\nHowever, the public defender‚Äôs internship will b in-person and while I will b driving 45 min to and from everyday, I feel like I should take it because it‚Äôs an in-person experience.",

I came out of a small high school, where I was top of my class and got high marks in international exams, got invited to the president's banquet and everything. Then I landed into my huge university cohort, where professors would raise their voice if you didn't know something or took longer than 0.5 seconds to come up with an answer. It was incredibly lonely with no clubs group activities to join on the tiny campus (classes are very big but since the campus is just law students, there is only ELSA and the student council representative). \n\nIt didn't help that I was still in my home town, with my parents making me stay at home for university. So I was physically stuck in the same place that I was in high school, which didn't help me move on from it. \n\nI was never a bad student but I spend the first semester praying that I would get the bare minimum of 15 credits just to not be kicked out of the university. Everyone kept telling me that the first semester is always the hardest and that it will get better as I keep going. I just had to push through, and it's alright to not be getting top marks anymore. I ended up passing, somehow. \n\nBut tell me why. I am in the exact same position I was in during autumn. Exhausted, sick and unable to force myself to do my work. It was supposed to get better. I tried so hard in the first few weeks. Did all the reading, prepared for lectures, tried a new note-taking technique. Then, very suddenly I lost all my interest in everything. I don't know what is wrong with me, but studying has become so overwhelming and I can't focus. I don't even want anything anymore. I think of anything I want from life. I don't know why I chose this field, but there is nothing else I want to do. Giving up is not an option because \"you're a girl you can't drop out\". My brain is foggy. I used to make puns all the time, I was able to think quickly. now it seems that I have to think through starchy water. \n\nEverything feels too difficult. I have been sick for a few weeks, but even doing things to relieve the symptoms (bad cough and nosebleeds) feels like too much work. I don't even want to paint anymore. Everything is very tiring. \n\nAnd it's very stupid because there is nothing actually wrong. My life is fine, I just can't deal with it. I will get out of this, I have done it every time so far. I just hate being here. Can't catch a break.",

However, I am questioning whether or not it's even worth it to write the licensing exam and work as a licensed paralegal in that short time frame in between July and September... There's no guarantee that I will be able to even get a job, and on top of that I would have to pay annual licensing fees. I was thinking if I become licensed it may help me find jobs later down the line when I become a lawyer, and I could also do some notary work while in law school. Other than that though, I have a feeling that it's not worth it and maybe I should do something more productive starting right after I complete this paralegal program such as finding a job off the bat, or doing some volunteer work...

Requires 5 days of training  at a location 3-4 hours away. Otherwise job is completely remote.  Job involves research and writing, listening to appeals on SNAP benefits / medical benefits etc and making a preliminary decision in accordance with the law.  Also involves Passing decision over to he hearing officer  for approval.\n\nCareer Law Clerk - Pays $55K - job is an hour drive each way to a major city.  Parking - nightmare. Train is possible but only 1 train every 90 min.  Job will be clerking for 3 different senior judges involving mass tort cases.  Office is low key but formal. City has residency requirement which would require me to relocate within 1 year. (Not crazy about pulling kids out of their current nice suburban school and moving them to a major city.\n\nI‚Äôve been working from home since late 2019 and feeling reluctant to go to an office.
