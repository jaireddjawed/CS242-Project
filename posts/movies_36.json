However, in the third act it actually started showing glimpses of some genuine heart and i began to feel weirdly invested. It didn’t achieve anything impressive but it definitely succeeded in what i set out to be. It’s a laugh and i would recommend seeing it when it’s released.",

What does this difference of bleach and lye symbolize ? \n\nAlso, what does the recurring theme of fish represent? (Pictures in Maria’s house, the fishing photo with Ivan, fish in Trevor’s freezer) \n\nLastly, what does the theme of disfigurement represent?

Even if there are scenes that aren't directly the match (someone stepping out during to sort out subplot) it's weird that I can't find a movie that has a full boxing match in real time.\n\nMaybe I just haven't seen enough boxing movies though.\n\nAny Recommendations?",

Given that Potter's magical world is inherently violent, R-rating could make some scenes much more impactful and graphic. Just imagine Malfoy lying in a bathroom with his chest split open by the spell or Bellatrix blowing up into hundreds of bloody pieces. Quidditch? Oh man, this sport is made for portraying traumatic experiences. All in all, there numerous instances where violence could be much more graphic, and not for the sake of fake blood, but rather for the sake of showing how extremely powerful and dangerous magical abilities are.\n\nI understand that this idea is ridiculous from a business perspective, but I think that R-rating would greatly enrich Harry Potter movies, both in terms of narrative and presentation.

Or maybe I would choose Middle-earth, where I could journey through forests and mountains with hobbits, elves, and dwarves, and fight against the forces of darkness. The world of Narnia, with talking animals and magical creatures, would also be an enchanting place to live.

        "text": "Let's just get straight into it shall we. For the uninitiated, RRR (Rise, Roar, Revolt) is an Indian Telugu language, 3 hour long movie. And it is bloody amazing. I probably lost a lot of people at the '3 hour' thing but trust me, it does not feel that long. At all. \n\nAt its core, the movie is about friendship but it's really genre bending. It has everything from action and drama to musical numbers and romance. Tbh it's best to go in blind. I'm yet to meet a person who has not liked this movie and if they exist, they are very few in number. \n\nA fair word of warning, you might need to suspend your belief for certain parts, especially if you've never been exposed to Indian cinema before. Honestly, even that doesn't feel like a task because the tone the movie sets since the first moment is that of heightened reality and you just find yourself going along with it because it's such good fun. I've seen people describe it as a \"religious experience\" and honestly, i don't question that. \n\nSo please do yourselves a favour and watch it. At least give it a chance. I'm sure (most of you) will fall in love with cinema all over again.",

Not to mention one of the best films for pointing out the dangers of substance abuse while being extremely funny and entertaining.\n\nI re-watched it for probably my dozenth time and noticed something new. In the cast credits Alex Jones appears as the Street Prophet and this just floored me for some reason. It doesn't take away from the movie for me in any way I just thought it was a fun fact to point out. He may be a grade A jack-ass but he is perfect for that little bit role.",

Victor MacLaglen gives a wonderful performance and Won The Oscar for Best Actor as Gypo Nolan, who is presented as a modern day Judas, haunted by guilt, conscience and an impending sense of doom, meets an inglorious end at the hands of former comrades-in-arms.

        "text": "Autobiographical means someone involved in the production is telling their own personal story. It doesn't have to be strictly factual, artistic license is allowed, but like Fabelmans, it would be focused on a real person's lived perspective and view of events. Some examples:\n\n- Audie Murphy famously starred as himself in To Hell And Back, about his own war experiences. Must have been a crazy time, reliving it all for the cameras.\n\n- While plenty of artistic license is taken, the relationship between Spike Jonze and Sofia Coppola is explored in both Lost In Translation and Her. In Lost, Sofia is reflected as the free-spirited and lonely Charlotte with a dour and unengaged photographer boyfriend, and in Her, Jonze is reflected as the artistic and sensitive Theodore, with Rooney Mara playing his critical and uninterested ex. Interestingly, both movies involve falling in love Scarlett Johanssen.\n\n- Mickey O'Keefe and Bo Dietl have both played themselves in fictionalized biopics of other people. O'Keefe was Mickey Wards real life boxing trainer, plays himself in The Fighter. Bo Dietl consults Jordan Belfort in Wolf of Wall Street, though I have no idea how much of that part is factual.\n\n- Coppola I guess made a movie called Tetro based on his own family but I haven't seen it. Two Jacks is also a movie based on the Huston filmmaking family and stars two Hustons, but I heard it isn't great. \n\n- Hilariously, Edgar Wright made Hot Fuzz in his hometown, complete with a cameo in his old job at the real supermarket he worked. No word on if the town had so many murders, but I choose to believe it's all true.\n\nAny others?",

        "text": "Can find barely any discussion about it on film subreddits. It's about a genocide that happens during the Bosnian War.\n\nI thought it was an absolutely superb film. It's not easy viewing and the story is haunting. It's a very personal account of a tragedy, through the eyes of a mother and translator. It is a very well-contained film. The vast majority of it takes place in one day and the filmmaker does a brilliant job in building tension throughout the film.\n\nI would thoroughly recommend it, it is available on Netflix.\n\nWhat are ppl's views on the film who have seen it?",

        "text": "Finally got around to this movie on Saturday and ended up watching it again on Sunday.\n\nWhat I really loved about this movie is how the antagonist uses his 'power' to keep abusing Cecelia. \n\nThings like invading her personal space. When she's outside and we see his breath, he's standing right behind her. Or the scene with the attic, where she's peering down into the hallway and he's mere inches away on the ladder.\n\nOr how he keeps humiliating her in front of others - first with the kitchen fire and then hiding her work for the job interview. \n\nAnd finally, isolating her from others - writing the email to her sister and hitting James' daughter. \n\nBut what I also found interesting is how capable Cecelia is of hitting back. When she's attacked in the kitchen, she knows how to fight back. She knows how to cut deeply with her words.\n\nAs much as Adrianne is a sadist, I get the feeling he's a masochist. Like he wants someone that can hurt him back.\n\nSuch a great movie.",
