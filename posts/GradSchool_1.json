        "text": "Hello, I'm in a computer science research master's program. I have not done well with my supervisor at all. She is disorganized and I lacked initiative. She recruited me to research with a logistics company, but we were blocked from meeting for months because my prof always wanted to be present for the meetings but she could never make any of the meetings.\n\nShe exploded at me recently because the work has been going slow. It is partially my fault, but she also denied my requests to communicate with them by myself. She really doesn't care to learn the details of what I'm working on, so when I tried to bring up concerns about the research the company wanted me to do, she didn't understand how I was being blocked from continuing.\n\nThe details are weird and embarrassing. I might be able to get a thesis done in time for August. Part of me wants to just drop it all because I don't want to work with a supervisor who seems to now have a lot of disdain towards me.\n\nMain question: Is a disgraceful master's still worth pursuing? I imagine it would be pretty bad to have spent 2 years with no degree to show for it. I feel like even if I complete it my professor won't have anything good to say about me. \n\nI got the prestigious Canadian NSERC grant. It's really quite pathetic that it turned out this way. \n\nI'm just feeling pretty terrible about the whole situation.",

The main reason I'm doing a masters is to help me get the relevant knowledge and background for a PhD (my undergrad wasn't in CS).

Do universities offer paid research internships during semester breaks? Or do I look for research roles in industry? (which would require a lot of time being put in to prep and give interviews, I'd rather just study and do research honestly). There's also a little bit of a financial angle to it - I might have to take out a loan for my masters (at least till I get TA funding, which I hear is quite easy at the university I might attend). How easy is it to pay off a loan during your PhD?\n\nWhat is the best way to approach this? I would like to hear from people who got into CS PhD programs after their masters degree.",

I was talked out of environmental engineering when I was 18 and now at 28 I'm finally actualizing that goal of mine. I got into a top 5 engineering school, despite never being a very good student. I don't test well. I know my admittance is mostly because of my career since I work somewhere they probably want in their alumni network. \n\nSince starting last semester, everything has been a struggle. I assumed last semester would be my worst grades, but this semester is shaping up to be awful. I try so so hard and spend so much time working. I go to every office hour offered, I ask questions in class, and I work in study groups. This semester I've socialized less to study more. I don't want to drop out or quit, but I know I won't make the gpa requirements to keep my scholarship. Everyone around me is so smart and when they do \"bad\" they get a B. I'm just feeling a bit defeated, maybe I'm only good at the job I was doing despite hating it and I'll never really amount to much more. I'm not sure. Maybe choosing a top university was going to set me up for failure and I should've attended somewhere less rigorous. I have worked for a while and I know grades don't define me, but I'm feeling defeated. Advice?\n\ntl;dr: Casually failing midterms and wondering if I'm cut out for grad school.

One of my biggest hopes with being accepted to a PhD program was to finally be able to move out and live somewhere new. Unfortunately I was rejected from most of the programs I applied to and the other institution was my safety and the lowest ranked program. \nI’m worried about burn out and being unhappy going to this same institution again, seeing the same old things and doing the same research in the same lab. I’ve already been here 5 years and I’ll likely be here another 5 which seems daunting. \nWhat has everyone else’s experience been like going to the same school for grad and undergrad? Was it worth it? Any tips for an upcoming PhD student about how to spice things up if I’m going to the same school again?",

For me I am specifically interested in cultural anthropology -- folklore studies, religious studies, Central Asia studies, etc. \n\nShould I just email different programs that I am interested in and ask them? Has anyone here done this, even in a different field? I know that there is a lot of crossover between these two, but I'm not sure how hard it would be to go from one to the other at that level. \n\nThanks!!",

However, we did realize we were two of the four students interviewing for the same PI.  \n\nFast forward a month later, I get an offer, I accept, and the PI sends an email to Sarah and me telling us welcome.  It seems we both got an offer and accepted.  Sarah emails me separately to tell me congrats and suggests we trade phone numbers to share ideas about a fellowship essay we both are planning on applying for.\n\nSince then, we've talked briefly over text, but nothing more than a few messages at a time.  Conversations have been initiated by both of us.  This past week, I thought of a cool research idea that incorporates some novel methods I used in my Master's to answer a research question I know she's interested in.  I quickly typed up the message, in a paragraph, and sent an old video of me performing the method in the lab to show her what it looked like.  I used the terminology \"we could use X method to answer Y problem\".  She read the message days ago and never responded, which has not happened before.  \n\nI feel like I F'ed up.  I can't tell if I'm overthinking this or if I scared her off.  Maybe I shouldn't have said \"we\".  I meant \"we\" as in the lab, not me and her only.  I'm really introverted, and I'm worried being an \"older male\" may make me come off as creepy.  Should I text her again or just leave it?",

        "text": "Cognitive Psychology Ph.D.   \nI'm a 4th year, so you think I'd be used to this! I just have no concept of how much professors have in their discretionary. I'm about to run a study that I've gotten blessing after blessing to run. It's been piloted and I even got a mini $1400 grant for it. Unfortunately, I burned through my money pretty quickly during the pilot/trying different ideas out and I now have to drop another $800+ on my advisor's dime. I'm up against a time pressure and I know I need to just do it, but I can't not think in terms of regular person money and I get so so nervous!! I've resorted to loading smaller amounts of money into Prolific, which generates an annoying number of receipts to be processed.   \nSome of the anxiety is because I transferred into this lab in the last year, so I feel like all of my expenses are unplanned expenses. Something that makes me feel better is that my advisor was accepting students this round and ultimately didn't, so that tells me that she was prepared to support another student even after taking me on. She's the head of the department and quite well known, so if there were ever a lab to try out different ideas in, it would be this one. But I'm not on a grant and I don't know where her discretionary money comes from.   \nAfter the failed pilots (which was expensive), she even told me that I need something to work so I can design some follow up studies (clock is ticking), so we might as well \"throw money\" at the problem. Another explicit blessing.\n\n  \nI'm sure I'm not the only one who stresses over this. My friend comes from a very prominent lab and even he books youth hostel lodging and bad flights for conferences out of guilt. Can we all just pump each other up a little here?",

        "text": "Hello all,\n\nI was recently accepted into a Master of City and Regional Planning program from a prestigious university, and the second I informed my parents they set up a date to visit the campus and meet the dean/director of the department, something I am nowhere near prepared for because frankly graduate school has not been on my mind at all as I am currently in the middle of midterms. I have my parents to thank for having the meeting in 2 days from now which is not as much time as I'd like. This isn't a post to discuss authoritarian parenting, I'm not free to research and ponder what I want to ask the director about the program, I do have some time but very little. This is a cry for help for current undergrads, graduate students, and postgraduates for questions I should ask, things that are important to know about the program so I don't have to figure out what I'm going to say during the car ride there.\n\nI know that some of you are probably going to respond with \"it's your decision, what do you want to know?\", and your right about that but I think that seeing some of your questions that I didn't think of will really help me inform my decision. Right now I really only have 3 questions, 1 of which is probably public information I can find online, I don't want to leave a bad impression by having a 3 minute conversation with the director of the program. The only questions I can think of at the moment can be found from their website. Please help",

I'm sure this has been posted many times before but I'm still having trouble deciding which one to go to despite knowing the general differences between them.\n\nI got acceptance into a professional Master's (two as of this morning lol) and a thesis based master's (both for environmental sciences). For the professional one I can live at home and commute to school while for the thesis based I would almost certainly have to live on residence or find a place nearby.\n\nBoth options will be expensive regardless and something of note is that I don't really have any intention of going into a PhD afterwards but having the option to do so would be nice. (especially since the lab I am going into pays 55k/yr as a PhD student which is kind of nuts lol). The professional master's would take a year to finish (12 months) while the thesis one would take 2 years.\n\nI mainly want to do a master's to more easily secure a high paying job, hopefully without ever sending out a resume, instead getting a good job through the contacts I make during my time as a master's student. Which one would be better for that?\n\nI also believe experiencing more is the best \"education\" you can possibly get. It builds practical skills while also building character. Sitting in a classroom is important, don't get me wrong, but you learn way more out of doing things in my opinion. Which one would be better for that?\n\nOr should I just say fuck everything and find a job lol?\n\nAny help would be appreciated, almost had an anxiety attack thinking about this lol.",

        "text": "Hi all. I'm looking for a sounding board and some perspective on a decision I have been wrestling with. I'm in semester 2 of 4 in a MS Business Analytics program (a quantitative/stem degree) and have been considering dropping out. \n\nI was a corporate recruiter in a past life, so I'm thinking about this primarily through that lens and through what I know about my industry today. I am not seeking a lifelong role in academia.\n\nMy arguments for dropping out:\n\n* I already have the career that I want. I'm a senior data analyst, successful in my role, with capacity to keep growing internally or at a new company, and marketable skills in a pretty niche sector of analytics. I keep thinking about what I'd do post-degree, and I do not think I'd be doing anything different than what I'm doing today.\n* Education for the topics that would be most important for me to keep building on (programming, algorithms, machine learning, data modeling, etc.) are all widely accessible online for little/no cost.\n* I'm not challenged by the program or the course content. It often feels like my cohort members see me as a teaching aid / mentor rather than a peer. \n* It feels like the value in this program was front-loaded. That is to say, the courses on subjects in the highest skill demand (within the job market) were placed at the beginning of the program, so I've already done them. If I drop, I'd be missing 1 potentially useful course (but something where alternative learning options do exist -- see above point), and the graduate practicum (I'm already designing and implementing successful analytics solutions at a large global organization, and I think those show more value than a student practicum would).\n* Last, but certainly not least, I am **tired** y'all. For all of the reasons above, and probably more, I've felt like I have been spinning my tires into the ground for the past six months. Learning a few things, but certainly not in the quickest or most efficient way. My gut is telling me that I'm investing all of this time and energy into this program, when I could be achieving comparable career and knowledge outcomes by methods that involve less stress and less debt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy arguments for sticking it out:\n\n* It feels like there is a stigma around dropping a program. I know this can be managed from a job-search standpoint, but it still feels weird.\n* I'm sure there are some greater benefits to finishing out a 2-year long graduate degree designed coherently together, as opposed to patching together different learnings from different resources.\n\nApologies for the long post. I've been doing a little bit of research (certainly not extensive) and it just seems like most of the \"should I drop out\" discussions that I've seen online have been from folks in scenarios that felt much different than mine.\n\nAny thoughts or advice would be appreciated. :)",
