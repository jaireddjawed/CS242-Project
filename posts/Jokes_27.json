She's called Nao and even though it's the first time we had met in real life, we get along really well.\n\nShe tells me that she pretended to be a guy online because she wanted to talk with someone about rock music but that people wouldn't take her seriously because she was a girl. She apologised, and I said that I'd accept her apology on one condition – that she plays guitar hero with me.\n\nShe laughed and agreed – she had a great smile – and we went to her apartment. She hurriedly opened her PS4 and accessed guitar hero. She was a pretty high level, much higher than I was, but we played anyway.\n\nSomehow I won – I guess I just got lucky, but she turned off the game and started sulking, and didn't speak to me for a while. I didn't want our meetup to end like this, so I tried to motivate her:\n\n\"Hey Nao, you're a rockstar. Get your game on, go, play...\"",

Then, you have to go outside and remove a sore tooth from a pitbull's mouth. And finally, there's a 90-year-old woman upstairs who has never been satisfied in bed.

But after a few minutes, the barking stops and the man walks back into the bar, bleeding and bruised but with the tooth in his hand.\n\nHe looks at the bartender and says, \"Alright, where's that old woman with the sore tooth?\"",
