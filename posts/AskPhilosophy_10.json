        "text": "Before I ask my question I want to warn you all that I am very inexperienced with philosophy and I practically have no idea as to what Hegelian philosophy is about. So please bare with me.\n\nThat said, I've been reading The Rebel by Albert Camus and I've reached the part of the book where he talks about Hegel and his philosophy and how his ideas have shaped revolutionary movements that came after him. From what little I've understood, Camus says that Hegel wanted to apply universal reason in the same way the Jacobins did during the French Revolution, but instead of making reason a transcendent value, he wanted to get rid of said transcendency. Camus gives a sort of summary of Hegel's master-slave relationship about how people only recognise themselves by recognising other people. From what I've understood, I think Camus believes that Hegel ultimately was not a nihilist and that his philosophy was life affirming but due to the vagueness of his writing, the people who read him came to the conclusion that the world was necessarily made up masters and slaves and therefore revolutionaries tried to recreate the world through this same dichotomy since reason has now been brought down from the position of transcendency and instead has been incorporated with history. \n\nThis is what I've understood. I'm sure my reading of the text is miles off, so I'd really appreciate it if someone could help me make sense of what Camus thought of Hegel and maybe even explain the concepts of Hegel that are being discussed here.",

        "text": "I am reading “Heidegger, An Essential Guide for Beginners”. It’s excellent. Heidegger emphasizes, in Being and Time, that we should constantly be aware of the certainty of our death, and that it could happen at any time. He says death is the most important part of understanding our Being.\nUnderstandably, the certainty of death should greatly affect the way we live. Accepting death as a given, for example, will give us a sense of urgency to do what we want to be done since we have a time limit.\n\nThe argument that we should be constantly aware that death is certain is appealing, however, it is based on the premise that death is certain. Is it helpful, or perhaps harmful,to take seriously the idea that technology may keep us alive forever (through any number of means such as uploading brains, anti aging drugs, nano technology, etc)? Or, is such an idea likely just another immortality myth like the kind that have been circulating for thousands of years, including in the Epic of Gilgamesh? Ernst Becker said that these myths, as well as religion, art, and all other forms of human creativity, are just meant to ease the anxiety of death.\n\nIf the premise that death is certain is not true, or at least not extremely likely true, then wouldn’t likely affect the way we should be living? Or, even if the premise is not so certain, should we nontheless STILL live as if it were certain so that we get things done that are meaningful to us?",

        "text": "In the fourth edition of PI by Anscombe, Hacker and Schulte I have come across an interesting anecdote of sorts that Wittgenstein used.\n\nIn §47 Wittgenstein uses the following to portray the difficulty of asking a particular language-game specific question outside of said language game:\n\n“[asking such and such outside a particular language game] ^is like what a boy once did when he^ had to say whether the verbs in certain sentences were in the active or passive voice, and ^who racked his brains^ over the question whether the verb “to sleep”, for example, meant something active or passive”\n\nTo me this is too specific to be unintentional. It seems much more like a recollection than an arbitrary constructed example. \n\nGiven we know Wittgenstein was always concerned with language and understanding even from a young age, you could easily imagine that said boy is him, no? \n\nI want to be careful about language of course (hence my referring the translation edition); can we get the same question when reading in German (“das ist ähnlich dem, was einmal ein kleiner Junge tat”).\nUnfortunately i don’t speak German, so is it the same as when we say “like what a boy did once” which refers a particular event which happened instead of some hypothetical event? \n\nIt seems awfully specific to not be him recollecting something, if not his own experience but perhaps that of a classmates he observed “racking his brains”? \n\nWhat is the census on this? \nIs it a known event in his life, has he refereed to it in other instances? \nIs it just the wrong inference from a translation creating a meaning not intended? \nDid he actually mean to say it like this, but mean it just be a framework for a hypothetical and not referential to something real? \n\nIn thinking over it it seems equally possible that it is either hypothetical or particular and referential. \n\nWhat do you think / know about this? \n\nThanks for your help.",

        "text": "I am looking for a history of the concept of space, not in a scientific/physical sense, but more of a cultural and philosophical one. For example, human civilizations seemed to operate on a Known Space-Unknown Space model, where areas like the Sahara Desert were functionally non-existent. Ancient conquerers had no interest in taking areas that were geographically large but civilizationally useless. Take Alexander's empire, for example, which skips over Arabia entirely.\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/MacedonEmpire.jpg\n\nToday, with GPS, the Internet, satellites, and so on, our concept of space is much more \"complete\", \"total\", for lack of a better word. The boundaries of a state are abstract, drawn on a map without much regard to if that space is used at all. The simple concept of land area, square kilometers on a grid, is dominant. For example, Algeria is the largest country in Africa, but the vast majority of the country is just empty desert:\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/figure/Population-densities-per-wilaya-Algeria-30-The-rebalancing-of-the-urban-framework-is_fig3_319474017\n\nOr is it all that different, actually? Have we simply moved the \"unknown, unusable space\" beyond Earth, into outer space? \n\nI imagine that capitalism, resource extraction, and many other related developments have played a large role here. Even though the unused spaces don't have people, they still contain resources that we now (unlike the ancients) can use.\n\nIs there a book out there that covers the concept of space and questions like this? I know Deleuze and Guattari's \"smooth and striated space\" covers similar territory, and I'm looking for similar works, except with more of a concrete historical basis.",

        "text": "I wanted to ask this forum if one could argue that Eastern philosophy (broadly) is more compatible with the findings of modern physics compared to Abrahamic philosophy. Various famous physicists such as Schrödinger, Heisenberg, and Bohr, have argued that there could be a connection between modern physics and Eastern philosophy. Does that imply that we should perhaps give Eastern philosophy much more consideration as opposed to focusing on the oftentimes rigid frameworks posed by Abrahamic philosophy?\n\nThere are several sources in the academic literature that discuss Niels Bohr's interest in the philosophical ideas of the Upanishads. Some of these sources include:\n\n1. \"Niels Bohr's interpretation and the Copenhagen interpretation\" by B. d'Espagnat, published in Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics (1998). This article discusses Bohr's use of the concept of complementarity and its connection to the philosophical ideas of the Upanishads.\n2. \"Niels Bohr and Indian philosophy\" by Helge Kragh, published in Physics Today (2013). This article provides an overview of Bohr's interest in Indian philosophy and his correspondence with Jiddu Krishnamurti.\n3. \"Niels Bohr and the Indian Tradition\" by M. K. Bhaumik, published in Science and Culture (2004). This article explores the relationship between Bohr's concept of complementarity and the non-dualistic philosophy of the Upanishads.\n4. \"Niels Bohr and the Unity of Knowledge\" by Finn Aaserud, published in Social Studies of Science (1989). This article discusses Bohr's philosophy of science and his use of concepts from Hindu and Buddhist philosophy.\n\nHeisenberg, for example, discussed Hindu philosophy in more detail in his book \"Physics and Beyond\".\n\nOn the unity of all things:\n\n\"The unity and continuity of Vedanta are reflected in the unity and continuity of wave mechanics. This is entirely consistent with the Vedantic concept of All in One.\"\n\nOn the relationship between the observer and the observed:\n\n\"The concepts of Hinduism are essentially consistent with those of modern physics. For instance, the unity of all things, the idea that the observer and the observed are not separate, the concept of complementarity – all these are basically Hindu concepts. In Hinduism, the observer and the observed are not separate because they are both manifestations of the same underlying reality, which is Brahman.\"\n\nOn the limitations of language in describing reality:\n\n\"The language of quantum mechanics and the language of Hinduism are both attempts to describe the same reality, but in different ways. In both cases, language is a kind of symbolic representation of reality, and there are limits to what can be expressed in words.\"\n\nAnd lastly, here are excerpts from Schrödinger's book \"My View of the World\" where he discusses his views on Hinduism and its philosophy:\n\n1. \"Vedanta teaches that consciousness is singular, all happenings are played out in one universal consciousness and there is no multiplicity of selves... The multiplicity is only apparent; in truth, there is only one mind.\" (Chapter 4)\n2. \"The unity and continuity of Vedanta are reflected in the unity and continuity of wave mechanics. In 1925, the world view of physics was a model of a great machine composed of separable interacting material particles. During the next few years, Schrödinger and Heisenberg and their followers created a universe based on superimposed inseparable waves of probability amplitudes. This new view would be entirely consistent with the Vedantic concept of the all in one.\" (Chapter 4)\n3. \"I believe that the present theory of quantum mechanics is incomplete without a theory of consciousness. In the Vedantic (Hindu) tradition, consciousness is viewed as fundamental, and matter as derived from it. On the other hand, in the West, matter is given primacy, and consciousness, if it is recognized at all, is explained as a byproduct of material interactions.\" (Chapter 6).\n\nI wanted to ask users here if we should finally start to take Eastern Philosophy much more seriously, especially on this forum where Western and Abrahamic philosophy still dominates.",

        "text": "If x hinges on y epistemically, meaning y is more fundamental than x, does it entail y provides equal or more epistemic warrant for a claim? One should answer this question more broadly to all the fields of knowledge, but I'll just focus on ethics for this post.   \n\n\nIt is uncontroversial that the role of intuition (an intellectual seeming)  is a very fundamental one; it serves as the ultimate source of justification for any truth claim. (If one keeps asking \"why\", at some point, one just has to say, \"it is simply the case\".)   \n\n\nSo, even if we fundamentally know killing unnecessarily is wrong through intuitions, that doesn't mean intuitions justify the wrongness or immorality of killing unnecessarily.  After one ponders on the issue, upon introspection, one finds that killing unnecessarily is wrong because of the physical and emotional harm it causes others. However, even then, if someone asks, \"Why is physical and emotional harm to others wrong?\", that seems to be answered by intuition. So, considering how moral intuitions are so fundamental in how we know morality, some would argue that moral intuitions provides equal or more value in justifying the claim that \"killing unnecessarily is wrong\". Kant would clearly disagree here. But, there is such intuitive appeal in the idea that epistemic fundamentality would have more epistemic value and warrant. Nevertheless, critics would rebut that this is *begging the question,* since we are using an **intuition** about fundmentality to justify a claim on moral **intuitions** (that it provides equal or more epistemic warrant).  \n\n\nNow, I understand the theory of reflective equilibrium, and recognise how it is the universal consensus in the creation of moral theories. Therefore, I believe the above question about fundamentality is a very important question when we are using the metholdogy of reflective equilibrium.",

I read The Birth of Tragedy, some bits of the Gay Science and Zarathustra and all the other stuff that I know is from secondary sources or vulgarisation (so that's where I'm coming from).\nHowever, I really like Spinoza, and postmodernist thinkers like Deleuze and Foucault who, to my understanding are very well in the same philosophical tradition. I also happen to be a communist (maybe not the most orthodox kind you might guess based on the names I cited) and so far I have based my political thinking, and even my ethical decisions off Utilitarianism or at least some similar personal version of consequentialism. To me, as long as you are a moral anti-realist and you assume that your moral axioms are arbitrary, this isn't contradictory with the broader philosophical framework I use.\nBut knowing the influence Spinoza had on Nietzsche, and especially the influence Nieztsche had on Deleuze and Foucault, I was wondering if it was at all possible to use a moral philosophy given the pretty hostile stance Nieztsche seems to have towards morality.\nI know he is a complex thinker and that he wasn't himself a leftist, and I was thinking that the French thinkers only took some of his work like the method of Genealogy or some concepts like the will to power of the eternal return. But it's still not clear to me as you may see, and I never found some clear statement in these guys' texts on this question. To me, when Deleuze or Foucault talk on subjects close to morality, it's more in a descriptive \"sociological\" way that doesn't really tell of what they think, if they think it would be useful at all.\nTo put it simply, I wonder if you can make any prescriptive claim without using a moral framework, and how that ties in with all of these materialist philosophy/philosophy of immanence.\nI thank you for taking time to read this mess and look forward for your answers !",

She is fully competent as moral agent. She decides her designer clothing is too expensive to get dirty with pond-water, and by the time she removes her clothing the boy will be dead anyway. And so, she forms the belief B: \"I do not have the moral obligation to save the boy.\"\n\n\nLet's say this is obviously morally wrong of Sally. Sally is clearly a terrible person for not saving the boy.\n\n\nBut was this *epistemically* wrong of Sally? That is, did Sally make an epistemic error in her belief that B, or is her error only moral?\n\nIf epistemic errors concern truth, and there are, in some way or another, moral truths, then it seems Sally can be held not just morally responsible but doxastically responsible (that she should not have believed B, because it's factually wrong, since she did have an obligation, and she should have known it was factually wrong).\n\n\nThus, is there literature on this interplay between doxastic deontology and morality? Or anyone have any thoughts or know of any names one hand? I know about moral encroachment, but that is not relevant here.\n\n\nThanks!\n\n(Edit: typo)",

So please bare with me.\n\nThat said, I've been reading The Rebel by Albert Camus and I've reached the part of the book where he talks about Hegel and his philosophy and how his ideas have shaped revolutionary movements that came after him. From what little I've understood, Camus says that Hegel wanted to apply universal reason in the same way the Jacobins did during the French Revolution, but instead of making reason a transcendent value, he wanted to get rid of said transcendency. Camus gives a sort of summary of Hegel's master-slave relationship about how people only recognise themselves by recognising other people. From what I've understood, I think Camus believes that Hegel ultimately was not a nihilist and that his philosophy was life affirming but due to the vagueness of his writing, the people who read him came to the conclusion that the world was necessarily made up masters and slaves and therefore revolutionaries tried to recreate the world through this same dichotomy since reason has now been brought down from the position of transcendency and instead has been incorporated with history. \n\nThis is what I've understood. I'm sure my reading of the text is miles off, so I'd really appreciate it if someone could help me make sense of what Camus thought of Hegel and maybe even explain the concepts of Hegel that are being discussed here.",

        "text": "My question is at the end. But for the sake of discussion in this post, to give a sense of my own perspective:\n\nI have typically defended the rationality of trans identity through a loose sequence of arguments, more or less summed up by: 1. gender and sex = counterparts of dualistic identity; 2. sex = physiological origin, gender = intellectual/emotional consciousness of sex 3. sex is more or less stable (although even this is not even fully true due to intersex, third chromosomes, and long term evolution), but gender is highly dynamic due to different prevailing conceptions of \"masculinity\" and \"femininity\" throughout different eras of history. 4. At no one point in time does gender \"reveals its true essence\", meaning it does not have a scientifically determinable essence. 5. Thus gender's primary epistemological ground is an experiential identity. 5. Experiential identity of gender is primary, and self-justifying, whereas scientific determination of gender is not universally expressed in every subject.\n\nThat is the gist of it. I am by no means a serious or scholarly philosopher. Because of this, I am looking for thorough, well-reasoned defenses of trans identity.\n\n Importantly I am looking for sources which avoid a kind of practical ethics route, along the lines of \"respect others even if you don't agree with them.\" *I want positive defenses of the ontological rationality of trans identity itself, not concessions or appeals to morality!* \n\nAlthough I would also be interested in refutations of it as well!

The opposing side is going to argue that she is posing as an expert. To refute that I want to say that if enough people perceive her as a expert,the influencer does become an expert. Because after all,who decides who is deemed as an ‘expert’? Society. Thus if a significant portion of society views her as an expert,perhaps she is one. I think this links to the whole reality is perception and “did the leaf really wall if nobody heard it?” thing but I’m not certain\n2. Arguing the semantics of expertise is also someone familiar with something. Since the influencer herself is diagnosed with ADHD,she has more experience with this compared to the average person. Thus if your frame of reference is the average person,then yes,she is an expert.  I think this is relativism? Although even if it is,could someone tell me what type of relativism exactly?

Has he succumbed to the force of the crowd, or has he used the force to orchestrate all the mechanism that leads to the Christ being condemned? Does Christ succumb to force as a victim or as a user of power and force, when suggesting Peter and the Apostles should be armed in the Getsemani? Are there examples in the Gospel, like in the Ilyad, of people using force to kill and subjugate that actively know and express the acceptance of their fate as being decided by the same force they are using to subjugate and conquer?\n\nI don't want to judge Weil's work because i'm ignorant and an amateur, but i found the whole book really compelling and interesting, while this parallelism is a bit forced. I know Weil was deeply religious and surely she knew the Bible and the Ilyad better than me, but the two books have such a different structure, context and end goal that this comparison cannot but sound forced.\n\nWhat is your take on this? Did i miss something? Do i need to read something before this book (or after)? Can the Gospel be compared to the Ilyad to such an extent?",

        "text": "Perhaps, this is a quite popular issue, but in philosophical terms - I can't really say who I am (pun unintended).\n\nGenerally, I used to (and still do to great extent) consider myself a sort of realistic pessimist - in the sense that I never think good of people by default, I don't think there is a specific meaning to existence and always brace myself for the most unfortunate variants of how things will go. In the way - it helps me to take everything with less stress than most of who is around me.\n\nYet, right now I'm in process of reading of \"Conspiracy against the human race\" by Thomas Ligotti, and I find myself disagreeing with a lot of arguments and I see most of them as disputed against easily. For example - one of the main thoughts in the book - that being alive \"is not alright\" - I cannot help but counter with a paradox of battle plane. In this case - every single human being who thinks that being alive is alright is actually alive, so to have a fair statistics on this issue we should ask the same question those who are dead, and only after this make conclusions.\n\nIn other words, I'm either not a pessimist, or not a pessimist as Ligotti understands it.\n\nI think that value of life is measured in how much there is in life to take. Does this make me a materialist? I think that some people tend to be pessimistic or optimistic based on nothing more than their conscious and subconscious interactions with the world. Does this make me an empiricist? I think that people don't change and born as who they will become in future. Does this make me a determinist? I think that nonexistence doesn't make more sense than existence, and being dead isn't better than being alive. And I can't really find any system that has same values.\n\nAnd so there's that.",

        "text": "I appreciate this is a very general question and may be referred to with many specific cases of philosophers and their use of the term, however please consider the following.\n\nPlease do put forward your own beliefs - built up by others’ theories or your own.\n\nPlease also provide what you believe is most common and widely held in mind when philosophers use the term ‘a priori’. \n\n—————————-\n\nHow often in philosophy does the term ‘a priori’ refer to a kind of knowledge before ANY experience? \n\n—————————-\n\n\nThe epistemological debates between Empiricists and Rationalists on the origin of knowledge seem to focus on ‘a priori’ to mean before all experience in the notions of ‘Tabula Rasa’ V having Inherent Intuition or ‘Innate’ knowledge. \n\nSimilarly, Kant seems to make a distinction in the Critique of Pure Reason by referring to knowledge before ALL experience as ‘Pure A prior’ but he doesn’t use this term always - which is just as confusing as his accidental swapping of ‘transcendent’ and ‘Transcendental’ (where the latter is more akin to ‘epistemology’) throughout the text - \nMoreover, it’s hard (in my limited understanding) to discern whether he means that the ‘Pure Concepts of Understanding” (which are ‘necessarily true, objectively valid, synthetic, A Priori judgements’) are purely a priori: before all experience ever? For he called them ‘Pure’ Judgements but systematically represents them all using notions he has clearly learnt through experience (language, logic etc). \n\nBut both groups and debates use the same term ‘a priori’ again when talking of knowing before a particular instance, after previous unrelated experience - and it is done with not using of context or language to differentiate. \n\n\n\n——————-Questions for debate on the subject:\n\nHow can we better make the distinction between ‘knowledge of a particular instance before it has happened using all other previous experiences’, and holding to understand ‘(knowing) anything at all before any sensory experience whatsoever’? \n(Specific A priori vs ‘Pure’ A priori)\n\nCan we include mental activity of a senseless human to have any experience? (Mental experience?) \n\n- Thus, are the faculties of mind,which are in place to learn and digest experience, forms of a priori knowledge? (“Do you ‘know’ how to see colour?”) - perhaps this pertains to subconscious vs conscious understanding and one might argue the former isn’t knowledge but ability? \n\n——————-\n\nDo let me know what you think about the above questions and how the term ‘a priori’ is used across the literature of Philosophy, whether precise enough or not. \n\nThank you very much for for your time, tolerance of my possible ignorance and your contribution.",

Claims made by materialism, as they concern the material world, should be falsifiable, right? But would anything be able to falsify materialist claims entirely, and force adoption of a non-materialist worldview? Wouldn’t any evidence against any claims materialism makes involve the material? I guess I do not even know what falsification here would even look like — for example, there’s a lot of metaphor of the brain being a ‘receiver’ of consciousness like a radio, and if this was somehow not a metaphor but somehow true, wouldn’t the fact that we found the ‘broadcast’ make it material now, even if it’s a form we could not perceive before? If only individual claims materialism makes can be falsified but nothing could falsify materialism in favor of some other model, wouldn’t that make it just as unfalsifiable as those other models?",

This isn’t a very formal discussion but I can’t find anywhere else to ask this question.\n\nI’ve always been one to appreciate the idea of being connected to nature, personally i think it only makes rational sense and is good for our health. However, i’ve also struggled to comfortably sit with this idea given to just how horrible nature can be. I feel like most discussions on this topic just glaze over the idea that nature can be cruel. While i’m can reconcile with nature being both beautiful and terrible simultaneously, i also often feel like i’m projecting too much onto nature to force it into an idea that makes me most comfortable. To truly be connected to nature means to fully accept it for what it is, and that means accepting risking being part of the food chain. Yet i am the last person to want to be mailed by a bear. I often feel like when people brush over this idea, they have an idealized view of nature, and while a nature that is moldy dangerous but mostly a paradise is true in some parts of the world, this is mainly because humans have killed most of the other top predators to make it more safe. This makes this kind of nature almost declawed and domesticated in my eyes, changed to fit what makes humanity most comfortable. But at the same time, my interactions with nature have been equally surface level. I take great precaution to stay clear of dangerous wildlife and my hiking trips are only being connected to nature on a surface level, nowhere near fully appreciating nature as what it is. Maybe this surface level connection is what is best, appreciating nature and staying connected to it but not fully taking part of it. But then again, this relationship with nature feels superficial in a sense. I also understand that humans taking effort to separate themselves from nature and control it is in itself a natural process. Although answering this question would virtually change nothing about my life, i still feel troubled about how nearly all discussions of connection to nature i see rest on very shaky foundations.",
