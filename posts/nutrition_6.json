He mainly focuses on sugar and simple carb intake as being the primary thing to avoid (which i agree with to an extent); and that dietary fats from red meats, butter etc are in fact fine (which Im a little iffy about). I know lot of people have this same philosophy as well..\n\nWondering what other people think? Have you seen this guys videos? Do you agree with his nutrition philosophy?",

I’ve had an intense work schedule for most of my life (a few 10-14 hour days/week) over a 9 year period, during which I didn’t have time to eat until I got home very late at night. I trained myself to power through hunger pangs, and now that I have more work life balance in my life.. I rarely feel physical hunger.\n\nI cook and eat healthily, exercise, have a 22 BMI so I feel healthy. But I hate feeling like I’m eating out of boredom, or eating lunch only because it’s the right time of day to eat, for example.\n\nIs it better to listen to your body (eat when you have actual physical hunger cues), or to eat even when you don’t want to (boredom eating)?",
