        "text": "LTL, FTP. Be gentle.\n\nI work at a reasonably sized managed services provider (we'll call it $MSP) as an L1 helpdesk engineer. We work with clients of varying sizes, from mom and pop shops with 5-10 employees to large medical and industrial companies with numbers of employees in the upper hundreds. This is a tale regarding one of those larger companies. Last week Friday, we received a ticket from this company (we'll just call them $XYZ) that went something along these lines:\n\n&gt;Hey $MSP,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;We have a bunch of users that haven't logged in in at least 90 days. Please process this list as terminations. Here's the list of names:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\*a list of literally dozens of names and email addresses, totaling around 150 or so\\*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thanks,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$XYZ-ITDirector\n\nNow, by our norm, this was a *monumental* list of terminations. We're normally supposed to follow a procedure where we individually remove email group access, disable accounts and move their active directory profiles to designated disabled users folders, etc. so this would amount to a lot of hours on one ticket. Another engineer and I were quite hesitant to touch this without confirming with $XYZ-ITDirector if he was sure he wants to do it. We called him and he confirmed.\n\nRegardless of how unusual and destructive the request seemed, the other engineer and I got to work disabling accounts en masse upon getting the go ahead. 4pm rolled around and we had gotten about 35-40&amp;#37; into the list, so we went home for the day, to continue on Monday.\n\nLittle did we know until this morning, is that there was a call at around 4:30pm from none other than $XYZ-ITDirector, saying that there were several names on the list that shouldn't have been there, and that we were going to need to restore those profiles. The on-call engineers updated us on the situation after having had to take ownership of the ticket over the weekend. \n\nApparently, we had given a script to $XYZ-ITDirector that reports back with a list of users that haven't logged in via RDS in a given period of time; in this case, 90 days. He'd likely thought nothing of just terminating those users; just some upkeep, right? Well, as it turns out, lots of employees login via active directory without necessarily going in through RDS, meaning that we were disabling users that were actively working for $XYZ, just not through RDS. What's worse is that $XYZ has active directory sync with O365, meaning they had their email access suddenly revoked after the terminations too.\n\nSo one of our backup engineers is running a restore on their domain controller. I'd love to be a fly in the wall in the meeting room where $MSP's account manager for $XYZ has to explain to $XYZ why all of this is going to be billable because $XYZ-ITDirector thought it'd be a good idea to wipe 150+ profiles without doing even a little bit of looking into it first.\n\nTL;DR: IT director of a client company decides to get us to terminate 150ish users that haven't logged in specifically via RDS in 90 days, doesn't entertain the idea that users may not necessarily get in through RDS. Chaos ensues.",

I must have started and shut it down 10 times while it was in the shop with no issue what so ever!\n\nSo I apologize and take it back to the shop again and it works great.\n\nSo now I'm thinking environmental, bad power, power in the ethernet cable, maybe even keyboard or mouse.

The monitor, I run back to the shop and grab one of the monitors off the bench take it back hook it up and the system boots perfectly! \n\nI still to this day don't know how a $#%^ monitor would cause this, especially a WORKING one, but it did.

        "text": "So this from a few years back when I was working in a very large company's tech support department. We mostly worked with small - medium sized business owners and administrators who used our cloud based products.\n\nSo this was twords the end of my time in this place so by this time I was very good at my job and would often get cases that had gone through a few other agents. This was one of those cases. \n\nMy main speciality was migrations and this was a migration cases but 1 of the previous agents was an email agent so they dealt with a person who had no real tech skills beyond that of an average user for at least a week.\n\nThe case:\nThe customer wanted to migrate all of their data to a new account because of a bad end to a business relationship. The customer said the partner had took all the company stocks, vans, cars, he even stole his girlfriend. He wasn't going to steal his data. No way. Our technical manager at the time even provided a little meme with this large gentleman in a tinfoil hat with a small cat, also wearing a hat. (https://imgur.com/a/9hhoQhd)\n\nOur company had a pretty strict policy on not doing migrations for customers. There was a time when we did but it was stopped when we'd have customers taking up a migration agent for over 6 hours. We might be tech support but we're not that kind. We come free with the product so it's not like having a dedicated tech support service that just remotes in and does it.  \n\nSo get the case and then give the customer a call, trying to hold in the laughter at the pic in the case reassignment doc.\n\nExplain our usual crap about data protection and calls being recorded or whatever it was and begin to ask the customer some questions to get some more context. He interrupts me and says something along the lines of.\n\n&gt;No! This is how it's going to go down. You're going to remote into my computer now and migrate my account from this domain to another.\n\nIt was a few years ago so my memory is a little hazey. I explained first that I couldn't do that but I was happy to email him detailed instructions and if anything went wrong I can troubleshoot using the system logs. I then went on to explain that the migration was a waste of time and an unnecessary risk on his customer data as we can easily secure the account to a point where the only way we could give them the account would be if they got ownership of the actual domain. Customer wasn't having it. They just wanted me to do the migration but as I already explained, that wasn't happening.\n\nSo I then go on to tell them what migration options they should use and ask them to set verbose mode in case anything does go wrong so I have a little more context. Customer was very unhappy at this point and was pretty emotional. Didn't sound that genuine tho as I remember being a little creeped out.\n\nKept saying no to the customers repeated attempts to get me to do the completely unnecessary migration. Eventually they got angry enough to hang up. I went on to send an email with detailed instructions on how to do the migration with screenshots of everything and the exact servers he had to use. I made it incredibly easy.\n\nCheck back the following day and the customer has rang in again, to the wrong department, again, so the case has been transferred twice to two different agents. Not my problem any more!\n\nI use to love and hate cases like this. Often times you get a customer who's just gone through a few of our more useless agents who wouldn't have a technical background so when they get to someone who does they're very happy and that makes everything a lot easier. Other times you're just getting difficult people who won't listen. \n\nTL;DR Customer wanted to migrate all data for company email and internal databases to a new account because his old business partner had left. This was completely unnecessary because security. Several years of data in a small/medium company so there was quite a lot and there's always a risk you'll corrupt some of your data.\n\nEdit(){jjjacer re-uploaded image to imgur so changed link to that}",

        "text": "First time posting here, and I'm on mobile, so sorry for lack of formatting.\n\nI'm a software dev in a department of a dozen. \nWe are split up into multiple app teams. One team is Support and they just do tier 2 stuff. There are two of them. (Tier 1 is someone in a call center with some reference articles and scripts about frequent easy (user training) issues.)\nI'm on an app team and the expert on this app. I've written tons of documentation, though, to help everyone from QA to new devs to Support.\n\nAn important point here is that Support is made up of two devs. (The Support assignment rotates every 6 months or so, though not through everyone.)\n\nS will be the support gal in this story.\nNT comes up later. He is a non-technical person on our T2 team. He is supposed to handle user training issues.\nuser is the user.\n\nS sends me an email asking me to look at an incident. Within 1 minute of starting to read it is obvious this is a user training issue. The user sees items on a dashboard that he feels shouldn't be there. They are there because nobody in the company took action on them (they aren't Approved). That is the designed behavior. If he wants them to disappear, he has to take action. There is a slight snag, but we'll get to that. \n\nS forwarded me the issue assuming the application was misbehaving and asks me to look at it. The user has included a list of 17 items he didn't want to see anymore. S is a dev. She had full access to everything. Within minutes she could have looked up the database query that populates the dashboard and verified the WHERE conditions against the data for one of the items, but she did none of this. And damn, this is becoming her pattern, not even spending a minute on something before escalating to me.\n\nStage 1 is realizing the items in the dashboard is valid.\n\nThe user stated that he wanted to Archive the items, but that action is only possible on items that have worked their way through the company and are in a Approved/Complete status. These pets, however, should be Rejected. He can't Archive because that action can only be taken on a screen that shows Approved items.\n\nS DID know that Archive is only available in the Approved screen but doesn't know why the 17 items aren't showing up there but on the not-approved dashboard. Cue banging head on desk. S didn't think it was because they WEREN'T Approved?\n\nSo user and S need reminding on what Approved means and what Reject is.\n\nStage 2 is that I realized that these items couldn't be Rejected easily even if the user wanted to because someone had soft deleted parent data (clusterf*ck; this had to be a direct db edit since the app requires all child items resolved before soft deleting parents; I'm gong to blame Support for this too, but I'll check the logs later). So he'd have to search for them on a separate screen with an option checked to show soft deletes. [I realize at this point the app sounds like a labyrinth. It's because I'm complicating it by simplifying it to protect anonymity.] I don't fault user or S for this. I type up detailed instructions on how to Reject these items with annotated screenshots (4 steps).\n\nI send these steps and screenshots in the body of an email to S. I copy the text only and paste it into work notes in our incident system.\n\n2 hours later I get an IM from NT (non technical guy on T2 team) asking me what the steps to fix this are. Me: ?\nNT is at the user's desk and the user received a msg from S saying to follow my fix steps.\n\nIt turned out that S didn't notice that I put the steps into the work notes (not visible to end users). Also, S didn't seem to care that those steps left out the screenshots I so carefully prepared. I also notice S didn't close the ticket and had assigned it to me!\n\nInstead of dealing with S again, I make a PDF with the steps and screenshots and attach it to the ticket, visible to the user. I message NT the all clear.\n\nI ask S about it and she said she didn't realize it was work notes (didn't mention lack of screenshots). She said she assigned the ticket to me so I get the credit but didn't close out because she wanted to hear back from the user. (Correct procedure is close the ticket with resolution steps or notification that issue is fixed, users have three days to reopen.)\n\nI take a quick look through the ticket log. I notice she and the other support person often ask for more info from the user before continuing to troubleshoot then just close the ticket after a few days. They don't seem to realize that they are asking these questions IN THE INTERNAL WORK NOTES even though work notes are ORANGE. The two text input boxes for notes and internal work notes are vertically stacked on the page, but the work notes box IS ORANGE with a bold red statement that says \"not visible to the user.\" I point this out to her and it blows her mind. These try have been on support for a month. Flying spaghetti monster help us.\n\nI tell her to reassign it back to her because I don't want the credit.\n\ntl;dr a user training issue exposes a support training issue too\n\nEdit: typos",

        "text": "I work for an cable service/ISP doing tech support. There are two departments who are supposed to set up \"trouble calls\", the local office and tech support. Billing can set up installs, but our install techs are generally contractors who just plug things in, and don't have the same account access as us or the field techs. If Billing wants to set up a trouble call, they're supposed to get them over to us to do the proper troubleshooting. This story shows us why. \n\nIn this story, I will be VK and our customer will be OL (old lady). \n\nVK: Thank you for calling CableISP tech support, my name is Void, how may I assist you?\n\nOL: Well my tech left an hour ago and told me he couldn't fix my problem. \n\nVK: I'm sorry about that. Let me get your account number and I'll take a look at what happened here.\n\n*I pull up the work order tab. There is no open trouble call. There is an install marked complete. I check the notes on the install. The customer had called in about not receiving the music channels on her TV receiver, and the agent she spoke with told her she needed to upgrade to a different (more expensive) box in order to get them. (this is incorrect) The installer did his job and marked it done, but no notes about sending someone else to look into the music channel issue or any indication it was going to be handled.* \n\nVK: Ma'am, if you don't mind me verifying, the issue you called in about yesterday was an issue with your music channels, correct?\n\nOL: Yes, and I don't understand that because the young man I spoke to yesterday said they would fix it. \n\nVK: I see... are those new boxes working?\n\nOL: Yes ma'am, except for the music channels.\n\nVK: Perfect, bear with me for a moment while I look something up.\n\n*Pull up  a different part of the account. All her channels packages are listed and checked, except for music channels, which she's supposed to have. I set up a change of service to add the channels and have her to restart the boxes.*\n\nOL: So I didn't need a new box?\n\nVK: Technically no, if you want your old one back we could arrange that for you?\n\nOL: Oh no, these work so much better.\n\n*generic small talk and end of call words* \n\nTL;DR: CSR broke the rules and sent an installer to do a field tech's job. Found issue could be fixed by simple change of service, and the CSR basically forced a higher priced upgrade on a customer for nothing. Luckily customer likes the new boxes, so no harm, no foul for them. Could have turned out so much worse but did not. ",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/8yt3r1/the_most_ridiculous_website_we_have_ever_built/",
        "text": "I know this is a long story, but there's so much ridiculousness to it that I'd be thrilled if even one person knew of the trials and tribulations I went through over the last 10 years for this very unusual company. The silliest of all of these stories is actually at the bottom of this post, because that was toward the end of my employment there, so feel free to skip down if you only want to know about the most ridiculous website.\n\nI used to work for a membership organisation. The members joined pretty much as a box ticking exercise for the companies they worked for, so they were very much inactive and uninterested in the services (mostly events and publications) of the membership they were paying for.\n\nI think it was this unideal relationship with the members that contributed to the unusual culture in this company. The business managers were incredibly irate and all interactions with them seemed to be fueled by blame culture.\n\n# The first website\n\nIt was my first web development role, and within the first week, I had two business managers tell my boss that he hired the wrong person because I hadn't heard of a particular local accessibility company -- right in front of me.\n\nIn the first year, I worked with a local CMS company to build my company's new website. I remember one day my boss, a few business managers and I went to the offices of this CMS company to change the spec for the umpteenth time. During this meeting, my boss became so furious with one of our business managers that he was screaming at him while bright red in the face right in the presence of this other company.\n\nIn that first year I often traveled to the CMS company to work with them. It wasn't really necessary to be in their offices so often, but it was so enjoyable to be in their presence, and to learn from them in comparison to the usual hostile environment of my workplace, and they were happy to have me there.\n\nOn the day that the website went live, I was sat down in a meeting room with all of the business managers, who spent the whole day describing everything wrong with the new website, and that I had made a huge mistake. They refused to use the CMS until it was as each of them wanted, and we had run out of funding for the website, so it wasn't possible to pay the CMS company to make so many huge changes to their core product. So I spent the next few years primarily juggling two tasks: populating content on the website the CMS company and I had built at the requests of the business managers, and building a new website to replace the other in Drupal, which would be capable of everything the managers requested.\n\n# The second website\n\nIt was a huge learning experience. I took the needs of the business managers on board, but also looked at the website statistics to see which pages people were visiting, and found that in all 2,000 or so extremely lengthy and difficult to read pages of our website, most of them were never looked at by people, and those that were looked at weren't for long enough to actually read the content. I raised concerns that the content was extremely difficult to digest, riddled with spelling and grammatical errors and weren't being read. The business managers acknowledged that the content which was not their own responsibility was problematic, but each in turn, stated that their own content is correct and didn't need correcting, removing or rewriting.\n\nThey concluded that all content should be moved across to the new website as is and will be edited afterwards.\n\nI took a long time to build such a huge and complicated website on my own, but after years of work I eventually got there and released the new-new website, packed full of oddly specific features suited for the business managers and riddled with thousands of pages of unreadable content.\n\nThe business managers had once again agreed that I made a huge mistake, the website was wrong, and they refused to use the CMS until I corrected those mistakes.\n\n# A second developer\n\nAround this time my boss had retired and his responsibilities had been handed down to me. At this point I was managing the entire IT infrastructure on my own and so the decision was made to hire a second developer who would work for me, and that should be enough to manage and build upon the infrastructure of the ever-changing requirements of the business managers.\n\nThis was really interesting from my perspective. I had no interest what-so-ever in managing people, and other than the CMS company that I worked with previously, I had never spoken or worked with anyone interested in programming or development. It was intimidating to go from being the guy who knew the most, to hiring someone who was smarter and faster than me.\n\nOddly, my lack of enthusiasm for managing him lead to a really great working relationship. We worked side-by-side and learned together on projects. This is not the traditional manager/staff relationship that I had come to know from others in the company, which were based on power and manipulation.\n\nWithin his first month we were asked to demo an idea for the direction of a new project to the business managers. They wanted a CRM that was capable of strange functionality which no out-of-the-box CRM offered. During this meeting we were slaughtered. I had warned the other developer of how the business managers can be, but even I was surprised at just how ruthless they were in berating our suggestions and ideas. The poor bastard didn't know what hit him. He came out of that meeting saying something along the lines of \"They made me feel as though I don't know what I'm doing, but they don't themselves have the understanding to know if I do or not\".\n\nWe were told to abandon that CRM project by the CEO after 6 months or so.\n\n# Why are the links blue?\n\nI had been there for years at this point. The toxicity of this culture had slowly grown over time, and like a frog in boiling water, I didn't really notice. I had grown accustomed to the culture, and accidentally absorbed and accepted that any technical decision or idea I had would be questioned and scrutinised relentlessly, and it had become my role to justify to the business managers why. It was also my role to justify to the business managers why their technical decisions and ideas should not happen.\n\nAs an example, I have been pulled into various meetings about the colour of the hyperlinks on the main website. \"Why are the links blue? They used to be green. Unless you have a reasonable explanation as to why the hyperlinks are blue, you'll need to change them back to green\". As it happened, I had a reasonable explanation as to why I changed the hyperlinks from green -- for accessibility purposes - it would have been difficult for people with red-green colourblindness to tell the difference between hyperlinks and various page elements which used the corporate red. But this wasn't reason enough for me to have chosen blue without their say so, and so emails were exchanged about shades of blue.\n\n# The third website\n\nAfter my first boss had retired, I was most often reporting directly to the CEO, but every now and again the organisation would be restructured and I would have a different boss. I think I had a change of boss every year or so, but around year 5, my new boss shook things up. He decided that we should build a new main website! I say \"main website\" because I have missed out that we built a lot of microsites in this time, but the flagship, with its thousands of pages not being read was to be replaced yet again.\n\nMy new boss stated that design-by-committee is a terrible idea, but it's exactly what we're going to do! I don't know if he was just crazy or if he wanted to let the business managers design by committee in order to show them that they can't do it that way, but that's what we did, safe in the knowledge that we shouldn't be doing it.\n\nEvery single week ended with a full day in a hot meeting room with all of the business managers. We would keep them up-to-date on the details of our progress, and they would change the spec accordingly. We started over with the content too. We went from 2,000 pages of lengthy content down to less than 100. I mean it all still read like a terms of use agreement but hey, progress! Also, because Drupal, and various other CMSs were \"too complicated to use\", we built our own CMS.\n\nIt took us about a year to make it and when we finally launched the new-new-new website which was built and designed exactly to the (eventually) agreed spec of the business managers, they once again refused to use it. This time, they couldn't use the excuse that it wasn't what they wanted, but instead kept insisting that they didn't have the time to update the content themselves. My boss, frustrated with how quickly the CEO decided to enforce that we would once again be populating the content on the website using the CMS we built ourselves, decided to quit.\n\n# The most ridiculous website we have ever built\n\nEarlier I mentioned that we made a lot of microsites in this time too. Event sites and such. One of the business managers was responsible for putting out four reports each year - since the organisation began, these had always been PDF files, and according to his input on the spec of the core website, we had built a publications library of sorts. It allowed him (or us!) to very simply add PDF reports as they were released each quarter.\n\nHe decided that this next publication would be different. He believed the content to be growing and dynamic, and that we actually need a website for the publication. As you would imagine, by this point, we had become very good at quickly building new websites, and we had the foresight to build the new-new-new website to be service based. We used OAuth to allow membership access restrictions to be used by any microsite we build in future. We agreed that we could do it: we'll build him a website with an easy-to-use CMS for populating content. A few weeks into the project, he arranged a meeting with us to change the spec. This was par for the course now, and we sat down to hear the new requirements.\n\nHe described that the structure of this publication website was so intricate that the only way he was willing to write the content was in a mindmap, using some unheard of mindmap software. He proceeded to show us that he had created a mindmap with hundreds branches and nodes. The text in the nodes represent the titles of the pages, and the branches represent their hierarchy within the navigation. He coloured some of the nodes blue (A very controversial colour I have come to know). \"The blue pages should only be visible to members who live in the following areas\" he said. \"And the red pages should be visible by any other member\". Green pages for all members, and the default off-white for any user to access. The actual content of the pages was written inside of a post-it note feature of the mindmap software which allowed basic WYSIWYG editing including inline images.\n\nHe went on \"Whenever I update this mindmap, I want to be able to upload it and the website will change accordingly\". This seemed far over spec for a single report. Most of our reports got 40 or so views ever. I looked around the mindmap software to see if it had an \"export as web pages\" option. It didn't. I asked if he had looked for a mindmap product which has such a feature and he refused. This was the solution he had chosen, it was now up to us to make it work. So we did.\n\nWe made a website that extracts the contents of a mindmap file, converts its node texts into page titles, its branches into navigation rules, its post-it notes into page content and uploaded images, and the colours of the nodes into user viewing permissions rules.\n\nVery few ever went to the website. Those of who did, didn't navigate through the pages. Those who did, didn't actually read the content. The business manager didn't once ever upload the mindmap himself, he sent it to us. But at least he edited the Mindmap himself! Victory!\n\nAnd as a cherry on top, he once sent the mindmap file inside a zipped folder -- inside a powerpoint presentation! I didn't even know that such a thing was possible, but having told him that we don't have Microsoft Office, and requesting that he just sends us the mindmap or zipped folder, he once again refused, we must buy Microsoft Office to extract the file.",

I also set the pw to never expire cause he seemed like someone who I would benefit from doing it(we don't usually allow this). I got disconnected after this was done. Mind you, this interaction took 6 minutes. I looked up his server pw on a locker website, connected to his machine and the server and navigated active directory to reset his pw twice. 1 hour later, Management tells me I received a complaint saying that I was too slow and didn't know what I was doing. Thankfully mgmt takes this with a grain of salt but, really dude?  I went back and checked his password to expire and set the maximum pw age to 30 instead of 90. It's not much but whatever, I hate getting negative feedback. \n\nTL;DR Guy doesn't like my 6 minute IT help with resetting his pw.

        "text": "Hey TFTS!  This is a short tale that came into my life earlier this week that I thought I'd share as I reflected on the last couple week's events on this Friday night.\n\nThis story doesn't have a ton of payoff, was just a fun affirmation of the beauty of IT.  Read at your own risk!\n\n\n\n**The Background**\nI work as an enterprise storage and backup administrator for a national service provider with just under 50,000 objects.  That's physical servers, VMs, pieces of other standalone gear, and protected laptops that my team services.  As such, I work primary with managing arrays and tending to our backup infrastructure.\n\n**The Prelude**\nIt's an average week of on-call for me.  We have specific duties for our on-call person outside of the normal flow including responding to our restore tickets and then any non-project requests for extending storage. Because of the size of the environment, these tickets stream in at a fairly regular pace to the tune or 6-8 per day most days of the week.\n\nIt's about 11:15 AM and I am just looking longingly at my phone, contemplating the great mysteries of what the cafeteria will be offering over lunch, when my laptop speaks up with a familiar harp strum alerting me to an incoming ticket.  With an all too practiced sigh and at great personal expense, I turn my chair quarter clockwise and bust open my Outlook client to claim and read the ticket.\n\n*\"Dear Backup team,  please extend the C disk on &lt;$serverName&gt; by 500gb and verify we have a good backup from last Friday.\"*\n\nThis is a little bit of a problem because unless it's a VM it's unlikely there's free extense to just grow into.  But, some of our older builds have these \"Image\" drives on them that are 40gb and are not necessary, so maybe there's something to delete...\n\n**The Rub**\nSo, I RDP in and fire up Tree to check out what is eating what.  It's a 250gb C drive so the fact this is full at all is surprising to me.  Maybe someone grossly misconfigured SSCM and this server has all the patches ever.  Maybe someone who had no idea what they were doing put a SQL database on C.  WHO KNOWS.\n\nI drill down and the problem becomes obvious quickly.  There is a zip file called \"backup\" on the C:\\Restore.\n\nI browse to this location and open the zip.  There is a zip file called \"backup\" inside C:\\Restore\\backup.\n\nI open the zip.  There is a zip file called \"backup\" inside C:\\Restore\\backup\\backup.  This repeats a couple more times.\n\nRight away I call the guy who submitted the ticket and I am just too eager to get his story that I am willing to delay the Southwest Patty Melt being offered downstairs.  So I ring him up, I rest my head on my hand while holding the phone with my other, and furrow my brow in increasing levels of curiosity.\n\nEvery week this gentleman selects his entire C:\\ drive and \"sends to zip\", and then leaves that zip in C:\\restore as his \"backup\".  He didn't even know that we used a product to protect his server, he just thought we fixed things when people had trouble on their own.\n\nEvery other week when his C fills up he'd go dump his copy and take another from scratch.  He finally just got sick of doing this and thought he should ask for more space so he could fit more backups.  He's been sitting around zipping a C:\\ drive on an active server every Friday for the last two years...\n\nIf you stare long enough into the abyss, the abyss stares back.",

At the time, we were busy writing up some new policies, and the way our admin generally does these things is that she finds something similar, rewords it, removes things, adds things and slaps our logo on top. Most times, what she gets are hard copies from some of our physicians private practices. Doctors...don't use email.\n\n\nOne day, soon after hiring a new secretary, $admin assigned her the task of writing up a several page document, of which she had a hard copy. The secretary had several days to get this done, and procrastinated until about an hour before $admin was supposed to come in to work. Secretary comes to me, hoping I could save her ass.\n\n$sec: DO SOMETHING. I can't not have this done. You type faster then me.\n\n$me: I do, yes. But why?\n\n$sec: Because this needs to be done. PLEASEEEEE!\n\n$me: I know that. But why the hell should I type it up.\n\n\nAt this time she shows me her scanned copy, that she scanned as a JPEG and inserted into a word document with our header on it. \n\n\n$sec: IT LOOKS LIKE SHIT. HELP!\n\n$me: *stifling laughter* oy vey. Give. \n\nI scanned the document in as a PDF, opened up the document in Adobe Acrobat and used the text recognition function to get it to recognize the typed text in the hard copy, and copied it over to word for her.\n\n\n$me: here. Fix Adobe's mistakes. Do you remember how I did it?\n\n$sec: yeah.\n\ntl;dr: secretary and admin have no idea Adobe Acrobat has OCR capability...nor how to use it. Admin still has no clue.",

        "text": "This story starts innocently enough: I was given one of my first onsite calls for a laptop intermittently losing WiFi connection.\n\nThe site in question is located on the 3rd floor of an old factory building made mostly of dense brick and steel girders. There are a couple dozen other businesses here as well, all in close quarters.\n\nI arrive to find the computer in question at a desk in one corner, and the wireless router about 50 feet in the opposite corner, on the other side of two half-walls.\n\nI spent probably about a half hour total troubleshooting, eventually finding that in that *exact* spot, the 2.4GHz channel liked to drop below -90dB every ten seconds or so. I moved two steps to the left (other end of the user's desk) and the dropouts ceased. I tried removing/powering off a few possible interfering devices (a cordless phone, another nearby computer, the user's smartphone) and found no influence from any of these things... it would appear the interference was caused by something external, or the building itself.\n\n&gt; $Me: I can't find the cause, but it seems there's some interference right where your laptop is. However, it seems to not be a problem at the other end of your desk. The simplest solution would be to move your laptop.\n\n&gt; $User: I'm really happy with the spot it's in though. Could we possibly move the WiFi closer?\n\nI had a look and determined it could be done, but would likely require a total rewire of their network hardware. I got in touch with my team lead and he instructed me to return to the office and let a senior tech handle it.\n\n&gt; $Me: Looks like we could do that, but it's outside my scope of work. My boss would like to send a more senior tech out to handle that, so we'll get in touch with you and schedule something.\n\n&gt; $User: Excellent. Could you also have a look at $OtherUser's computer? She can't print.\n\nI then spend another half hour reinstalling the printer drivers for this machine, then I pack up and leave.\n\n\nA few days later I'm walking down the hall and overhear $ASeniorTech speaking to $MySupervisor about the call:\n\n&gt; $ASeniorTech: ...well now she's throwing a fit wondering why we needed to charge her an entire hour of onsite labor to tell her that.\n\n&gt; $Me: Are you talking about $User from $Company?\n\n&gt; $MySupervisor: Yeah, I was about to come see you about this. What exactly did you do there?\n\n&gt; $Me: [Explains]\n\n&gt; $ASeniorTech: Well I just got off the phone with her. I had a look at their network prints and quoted them for changing to a WAP in the center of the ceiling. She flipped and wanted to know why you needed an entire hour to figure the problem out.\n\n&gt; $Me: I didn't, I had it figured out in a half hour.\n\n&gt; $MySupervisor: Yeah, your time was justified. They're just not happy with the cost.\n\n&gt; $Me: So are we going to install the WAP?\n\n&gt; $ASeniorTech: No, she moved her laptop to the other end of her desk and it's working fine now.\n\n&gt; $Me: ...you mean the first solution she turned down?\n\n&gt; $All: [shaking our heads and chuckling]\n\n**TL;DR: I give solution1, but user wants solution2. User is upset when other solution2 is expensive, questions my competence, and reverts to solution1.**",

While there, we would get all the escalated calls that level 1 could not handle (restart of the phone didn't work, reinstalling apps didn't fix the problem, etc.). On this day I get a call from one of the level 1 tech sounding frantic.\n\n$me = the one and only\n\n$cust = customer\n\n$tech = tech that seriously messed up\n\n$lvl3 = third level tech I was pretty good friends with\n\n \n\n&gt;$me = *generic greeting* this is $me\n\n&gt;$tech = Hey $me, this is $tech from level 1. I think I screwed up.\n\n&gt;$me = *not surprised* Ok. What can I do to help?\n\n&gt;$tech = I have $cust on the other line. He said that he was having a problem listening to his voicemail and restarting the phone didn't help. I decided to reset his voicemail box to have him set it up again.\n\n&gt;$me = Ok. I'm with you so far.\n\n&gt;$tech = Well, all the voicemails got deleted. There were 3 voicemails in there that were very important to him and he wants to know if he can get them back.\n\n&gt;$me = I doubt it. Once the mailbox is reset, it will clear everything out. Did you make him aware of that?\n\n&gt;$tech = ...\n\n&gt;$me = *sigh* Alright, let me see what I can do. Android or iPhone?\n\n&gt;$tech = Android\n\nI had worked on something similar before with another customer but the other customer had deleted the voicemails for work but had done it a few days prior and wanted them back. This one had been done the same day so there was a good chance they were not purged fully yet. I decide to call a third level tech I am good with. They have direct access to where I needed to go.\n\n&gt;$me = hey $lvl3, can you check for some voicemails for me?\n\n&gt;$lvl3 = When were they deleted?\n\n&gt;$me = level one reset the mailbox about 15min ago. Here is the number for $cust\n\n&gt;$lvl3 = ..., Ok I see them. I can't put them back into the mailbox though. Should I download them and send them out?\n\n&gt;$me = *realizing that I have no idea what the $cust wants*, let me conference in $cust\n\nAt this time we decided to conference $cust in\n\n&gt;$cust = Hello?\n\n&gt;$me = Hello. This is $me and $lvl3 with *company* tech support. We have retrieved those voicemails that were deleted. Unfortunately we are unable to put them back into the mailbox. Would you like us to send them to you on a disk? there is a $90 char....\n\nAt this time he cries out\n\n&gt;$cust = Oh thank god! I will pay anything to have them back! Please!!\n\n&gt;$me = Ok sir. We can do that for you. $lvl3 can you download them and send them out?\n\n&gt;$cust = can you send them as soon as possible?!?!\n\n&gt;$me = I'm sure we can. It may incur an additional cost but you will have to talk with customer supp...\n\n&gt;$cust = *pleading* I don't care, I will pay anything.\n\nAt this time he told us the story of why. The messages were the last 3 message he had from his late wife and daughter. There were across the country and ended up in a fatal accident. He was supposed to fly down to meet them 2 days after the accident. When he was trying to listen to the messages, something was going wrong with the phone so he called in to get help which started this whole thing. \n\nAt this time I was speechless. $lvl3 stepped in.\n\n&gt;$lvl3 = I am so sorry for your loss. Let us see how we can make this better for you. We will call you back in 10min with a follow up.\n\n$lvl3 and I called customer support and explained the situation. We ended up getting the Ok to send the disk to him overnight free of charge because it was our fault he lost them. $cust was sobbing when we called him back with the great news and asked to speak to our respective managers. We did get the kudos call for it and the site directory personally thanked us and gave this huge email about how we went above and beyond but that could not compare to the feeling of happiness and relief that I got when he was able to hear that we are getting those voicemails to him. \n\nEdit: Thank you kind person that gifted me gold. You are awesome!",

It's past midnight in my timezone) and I just knew it had to be shared.\n\nIt's been a rough week, half my team was out of office for remote-site support and our ticketing system went down just because. The Director for IT support ordered a communications to be sent to all global employees to send in their emails instead of logging tickets, leaving me to sift through the rubbish heap and forward them to the proper action groups. \n\nThe very first email came with the subject title, \"Keyboard needed - Leg broken\" and single line, \"please help\".\n\nNormally, we would just drop an email to users asking that they collect the item at the service desk so as to save us the trouble of looking for them, but there was no way I was making someone with a broken leg come to me for my own convenience. So I grabbed a spare keyboard from storage and went hunting for this poor sap. I found her in the lower level, legs obscured from view and clacking away on a working keyboard.\n\n&gt;Broken leg lady: \"Oh finally, I've been using tape for a week.\"\n\nShe grabs the keyboard off my hands and installs it herself, shoving the old one back in my hands.\n\nI look down at the keyboard, it's left leg held on by tape and walk back to my desk, not another word said.\n",

        "text": "LTL, Not FTP, English is my only language, BBQ\n\nTLDR: we fixed the problem. It was strange. \n\nI own a small IT company and one of my clients is a large dental surgery clinic. They have an xray machine that is used constantly - they take 50 to 100 shots a day, every weekday and when it goes down, they get unhappy. About a year ago, they xray company sends us a new PC and we start having issues, we finally resolved it by determining that the video card was in the wrong slot. The local xray guys and I have come to an agreement that we'll keep each other notified of any issues.\n\nQueue up the latest troubles. Suddenly, at random times while taking an xray, the PC will bluescreen. I approach the problem as heat related first - keep the cabinet doors open, confirm the ventilation fan is working, add an extra fan to the case. No dice. Get the support guys on the phone (why can nobody get decent hold music?) and they decide to send out a new PC overnight. Get it all built and configured, transfer the data, crank it up for the first xray and... Bluescreen.\n\nSupport tells me that it's got to be power related - they're seeing 0.1 volts to ground. For those of you who don't know electrical, the ground is a safety that normally has no voltage at all. A tenth of a volt at household levels is barely going to tickle you, if you are even aware of it (phone lines carry 24v)(and yes, I know it's the amps that get you, but I'm not going into all the details). So we call in the electrician and he checks it all out.\n\nThe machine is on a dedicated circuit with a ups and a power conditioner. He can see the 0.1v to ground. He goes and isolates the wires in the panel more. He checks again. He's contemplating running a dedicated ground out of the building for this one circuit when he unplugs the ups. And the voltage to ground disappears. He plugs it back in, it returns. We throw an old ups on there and see no issues. Take some xrays, no bluescreen.\n\nIt wasn't until I looked closer at the bad ups to find the manufacture date, that I realized it was a power conditioner as well. We had two power conditioners daisy chained and one of them was failing. I told that office to give the electrician a bonus - he'd earned it. ",

This is the guy that closes his outlook every time he wants it off the screen, and then complains when it has to reconnect to the mail server and takes a second to reopen, seemingly ignoring the hundreds of times I have explained what minimizing a window does.\n\nAlso this user is so inefficient at his job that he has to get here everyday a full hour before anyone else so that he can achieve a full day of work; he usually ends up staying later than anyone else as well. All this means that he not only thinks that he works harder than anyone else, he thinks that his methods are the best.\n\nI work as a network admin/general tech help. It is a small company so there is just me to help everyone with their computer issues. \n\nSo User x calls me to his desk this morning as soon as I sit down. He wants to know how to cancel jobs on his new printer when he only wants to print the first page of a document. I have explained to him many many times how to selectively print specific pages from a document, but he assures me that his way of just hitting quick print and running to the printer to press cancel before the rest of the pages print is easier for him. The way he needs to cancel prints on his printer is extremely simple, first press the cancel button, then when prompted on the printer screen with \"Cancel?\" press the ok button so the printer knows you actually want to cancel the print. I have taught this method to user x at least 5 times to no avail, it is simply too complicated for him. \n\nSo I reiterate to him this morning that it is much better to just tell the printer to only print the first page, and that if he doesn't want to do that, he only needs to press the ok button after he presses cancel to cancel the print. As I am taking time out of my day to reteach this adult something for like the fifth time a child would have grasped within the first 2, he starts telling me how busy he is and that he has no time for me to teach him computer things. HE CALLED ME TO HIS DESK TO HELP HIM!!! HOW ARE PEOPLE SO DENSE? SERIOUSLY HOW?!?!?!",

The players in this story are $ME and $TEACH, an instructor at the University who is several states away from the operating location of myself and my team. \n\n\n$TEACH had submitted a ticket the day before regarding her laptop, which could not connect to her home WiFi. She neglected to point out that her laptop could not connect to *any* WiFi, a detail I dragged out of her after my team couldn’t figure out what was wrong. I asked her to give me a call, and late that afternoon, she did just that. \n\n\n&gt;$ME: Hello! I understand you’re having trouble getting your laptop to connect to WiFi. I’d like to do some troubleshooting with you, but that would be easiest if I could connect to your computer and take a look. Do you have a desktop computer in your home with a wired internet connection?\n\n&gt;$TEACH: I do! I’m not sure which cable is for the internet, though. \n\n&gt;$ME: That’s quite alright, could you go to the computer and take a look? \n\n*I explain what an Ethernet cable looks like to the best of my ability*\n\n&gt;$TEACH: Oh, is it the one that looks kind of like a phone cable?\n\n&gt;$ME: It is! Make sure you press down on the little tab before you remove it. \n\n&gt;$TEACH: Okay, I’ve plugged the cable into my laptop and it has a little loading symbol.\n\n*A few moments later*\n\n&gt;$TEACH: It says ‘unidentified network’, but I don’t have any internet. \n\nAt this point I proceed to spend about 5 minutes walking the user through troubleshooting this error, most of which involves rapid Googling and reading her the steps because I rarely see this error on what I assume to be a functional network. \n\n&gt;$ME: Okay, so at this point I’m curious as to whether or not this issue is related to the cable you’re using. Could you connect the Ethernet cable back into the back of your desktop so we can see if it has the same problem?\n\n*short pause*\n\n&gt;$TEACH: (*I can hear the nervous laugh in her voice*) Before I say what I’m about to say, I need you to promise me you won’t tell anyone about this. Actually, I know you’re going to tell people, so maybe just don’t identify me when you do. \n\n&gt;$ME: Of course, what happened?\n\n&gt;$TEACH: I was supposed to take the cable out of the computer and not the wall, wasn’t I?\n\n&gt;$ME: (*struggling to suppress a laugh*) Yes, the Ethernet cable needs to be connected from your wall into your laptop.\n\n&gt;$TEACH: I’m so embarrassed, I even helped a tech last week to set up a whole computer lab on the campus. Please just don’t tell use my name when you tell this story!\n\n&gt;$ME: It’s an easy mistake to make, I should have mentioned it when we were switching cables around. My lips are sealed.\n\n\nAt this point she got connected to the internet, I remoted in and uninstalled/reinstalled the drivers for her network adapter, and all was well with the world. I’m glad she was a good sport, because I should have been much more capable of suppressing my laughter. She turned out to be pretty technologically capable and perfectly willing to accept help, which I can’t always say of her coworkers. All in all, it was a nice way to end my day. \n",

        "text": "Yo guys,  \n\n\n*Short reminder of who I am:*  \nLTL, not so first time poster.   \nIntern at two companies owned by the same man and solely responsible for the IT these days.  \nGenerally nothing going on but handling simple problems and looking forward to the next Friday company lunch.  \n\n\nI got a super short tale that concluded 10 minutes ago.  \nYesterday we put in a ticket with our external IT desk to open FTP connections to our NAS.  \nAnd after a short response asking if we wanted any IP filtering the ticket seemed abandoned (higher priority tickets maybe who knows?).  \n\n\nUntil about 2 hours after I put it in when the NAS suddenly becomes unavailable.  \nNo FTP, no SSH, no telnet (only internal for emergencies), absolutely nothing internal or external.   \n\n\nI wobble over to the NAS in a panicked fit to find it's quietly started rebooting. Now this is a 10Tb NAS and it does some verification of the drives while booting so for the next 45 minutes nobody can upload anything. After it finished booting I grab the logs as I want to know who or what queued that reboot.   \n\n\nSome of you might have guessed it but our external IT desk just rebooted a machine in production under active workload without notifying anyone. General protocol is that quick reboots are allowed but everyone should still be notified before doing so to give them a chance to finish / delay their file transfers.  \n\n\nI still have to call them over this but thankfully nothing was lost and nobody was uploading anything large.  \n",

Not really about tech support but trying to dodge work in a weird manner.\n\n\n\nThe past several days had truly and totally sucked and I was taking Friday off as comp time and was going to meet up with some buddies to play some pick up hockey around lunch time.\n\n\n\nI get there about an hour before puck drop, because goalies take a while to get dressed and I wanted to stretch a bit anyhow.  While I'm about halfway dressed I get a call from an account manager demanding I get on a conference call to do something about a fiber cut that has several sites down.  Because of the nature of this network design, I can't do shit.  I attempt to get off this call, but there's nothing for it.  And screw it, i'm in dire need to see some shots this week.\n\n\n\nSo, muting my phone, I skate out to the bench and drop my phone as near the door, and skate to the net with my bluetooth headset on.  I can hear perfectly.  One of my friends who just got there took a few hard shots at me, and I heard the call just fine.  Tell my buddies to keep an eye on the phone and just go on with the day.\n\n\n\nGame on!\n\n\n\nSo, for the next two hours, the sequence of events is \"Challenge shooter, make save, make save, reset after goal/rebound/stoppage in play, reset to resting position, listen to call, VH save, glove save etc etc.\n\n\nNever had more fun on an outage call.\n",

Scan to email is my least favourite aspect of MFPs to diagnose, mainly because a good part of it is out of my hands.\n\nI'll be [Me], and the user will be [U]\n\nWhile I'm remoted in, I'm checking settings on the printers we page. Meanwhile, the User is poking around the same settings on the device herself, just looking. She found herself on the interface settings screen. \n\n&gt;U: What's \"Machine IPv4 address\"?\n\n&gt;Me: That's the address of the printer itself.\n\n&gt;U: Oh. Should it be the same as the Gateway Address? \n\n&gt;Me:...no it should not. Good catch! \n\nI go to the appropriate page on the printers Web image monitor, and sure enough, the gateway address was the same as the copiers address. No wonder it wasn't working. I changed it to what it should be, and lo and behold, scans began arriving in mailboxes. \n\nI would've seen it eventually, but usually when I'm troubleshooting scan to email I'm checking out other settings, like making sure the SMTP field is filled correctly, that kind of thing. I'm glad she caught it, otherwise I'd have been barking up the wrong tree for a while. \n\nStill leaves the question of who the fuck changed it in the first place, but that ain't my problem.",

        "text": "Years ago (1990's) before I officially joined IT I installed and maintained a real-time factory planning system that uses the UNIX variant called QNX. We used a cabinet to run four fast PCs which served as the server for this application. We used tape backup. \n\n\\--Background info for people who grew up with the internet to know how we existed before Google etc. Skip if you want\n\n At this time in the dark ages we did not have CIO's and this is before Sarbanes Oxley so it was not unusual for tech savvy business people to do IT projects. Our IT staff at the time only supported the mainframe (token ring I believe) and the phone system. They grudgingly supported Macs running Apple-talk over a separate set of phone wires. Users were on their own with applications, there was no help desk. Rarely did they help with PC issues. The IT director from our corporate office 'helped' me implement the project. Mostly by hounding me mercilessly about missed deadlines. Since at that time my official job title was Planning Manager I had numerous other job duties plus a department of planners, clerks, factory, and master scheduler to manage. Needless to say I was already busy.\n\nOh and BTW this project also installed the first Ethernet network in our company. We had forty PCs and a 'server' rack of four fast PCs. We used dumb hubs which meant every PC saw every packet. :O\n\n\\--Background over\n\nThe IT director insisted I practice a restore from tape. This application did not use a database application. I know right? Instead it wrote everything out to text files and basically mimicked a database for all practical purposes. To do this it used a fairly impressive folder structure. Also at that time in the professional journals there were many horror stories about people who faithfully backed up there data and then disaster struck, and when they tried to restore, disaster struck again in numerous ways. The tapes were blank because the machine was broken, they installed the tape drive into a new machine only to find the software was not compatible with the new OS or worse they couldn't find the tape software and the vendor didn't have an old copy. You get the idea.\n\nI read the QNX manual (RTFM) and found the commands. I read the application manual and figured out which directories to backup. I formatted and backed everything up to tape. (We set up a grandfather, father, son tape routine) Now I had to do a restore. Guess what, we did not have a test system or dev environment either so the only place to try anything was in production. So I called support. \n\nThe support guy say why are you doing this, the system never fails...\n\nAfter some cajoling, he gets the manual out and confirms my commands to do a restore to a parallel directory as well as a method to confirm the restore looked correct. So I go through all of this and document it for the Corp IT Director and he gets off my back. We have to do a practice restore monthly which I write a procedure for and practice.\n\nAbout a month goes by.\n\n\\#Support calls #me.\n\n\\#Support - Hey, uh, did you get that tape restore to work?\n\n\\#me - Yes, it took a while but it worked, I am practicing it weekly for now and then I plan to back off to monthly. Why?\n\n\\#Support - Uh well one of clients had a fire and they need to rebuild and restore their data. \n\n\\#me - ... OK. That's bad. Why are you calling me?\n\n\\#Support - (In a nutshell) We've never done that and we've rebuilt the system but don't know how to restore from tape...\n\n\\#me - OK. Well I have all of this in a work instruction I wrote to our document standards for engineering and operations. Assuming you know the software it walks you through the restore. You do have to have the tape drive and drive software installed, it doesn't walk you through that. Would you like me to fax it to you? (Ah the time before e-mail ruined our lives...)\n\n\\#Support -  Oh man, that would be great! Can you do it now? Here is the number xxx-xxx-xxxx.\n\n\\#me - Sure on its way.\n\nI send them the spec. I wait a few days and call back.\n\n\\#me -  Can I speak to #Support guy?\n\n\\#Support - yeah let me put him on the line\n\n\\#Support - This is #Support guy, \n\n\\#me - Hey this is me, how did the restore go?\n\n\\#Support - (Sound of phone mouthpiece being covered by hand)  (Whispering) Great I can't thank you enough.\n\n\\#me - No problem, I just wanted to make sure my procedure is good, nothing beats a real world test.\n\n\\#Support - The instruction is perfect. I rewrote it into our format, hope you don't mind.\n\n\\#me -  No problem, we have to help each other right?\n\n \\#Support -  Hey if you ever come to xxxxxx, ring me up, I owe you a beer or more. Also if you ever need work...\n\n\\#me - Sure I'll let you know, good luck!",

        "text": "Hello All,\n\nSo this happened about a month ago. I am the Network Administrator/IT guy for our site and take care of the servers, computers, Phones. Anything IT related. About a month ago I get a message on the weekend from a user telling me how bad they feel for ruining their phone and asking for a new one. The message went in to detail about how they were sitting around the fire and it was in their shirt pocket and when they bent down, it fell in the fire. It still worked, unfortunately they didn't get it out in time and the screen melted a bit.\n\nThat's fine. I assured them that these things happen and it would be no problem. On Monday I preceeded with getting them a replacement and had them back and working by the end of the day. Problem solved.\n\nHere's the kicker. I was walking in the hallway today and encountered the user on their way out for a cigarette. We started chatting and joking and they then asked very seriously, \"can I tell you something?\". I said sure.They proceeded to tell me the real story behind them burning their phone. They told me while at home they fell asleep in their den and their phone was on the night stand next to their coffee. I immediately interrupted with \"you spilled coffee on your phone and to cover it up you threw it in the fire\". They laughed and said no. They said that they woke up from the sleep and picked up their phone and their coffee and went to the kitchen and proceeded to put their coffee in the microwave and selected 30 seconds and hit start. When they turned around they wondered why they still had their coffee in their hand. Then the OH Shit moment. At this point it was probably in there for 10-15 seconds popping and sizzling. They opened it up and it was too late. They started freaking out and panicking about what they are going to tell their boss and me about how they managed to microwave their phone.\n\nI ended the conversation with, \"I am glad you told me it accidentally fell in the fire because I would have been less inclined to give you a replacement if you are going to be microwaving your phones\".\n\nAt the end of the day shit happens but the amount of times I have to replace people's gear because of carelessness is sometimes frustrating. Oh well.\n\nTL;DR User lied about dropping cell phone in fire when in reality they put it in the microwave.",

        "text": "I’m a sysadmin for a company with ~1200 employees spread over a dozen states. Part of my job is to manage all our $fruits in our $mdm, but since that isn’t something that requires constant attention I don’t monitor it all that often. \n\nBut yesterday, I went in there and discovered a critical certificate that allows $mdm to interface with $fruits had expired. No biggie I thought, I’ll just renew it. But then I discovered that you need to renew it *before* it expires— if your cert expires, you need to re-provision all $fruits manually. Wait what?! And because I’d conveniently used $mdm to disallow users from un-provisioning their devices, this meant all of our ~400 $fruits (spread over the aforementioned dozen states) would need to be factory reset. Huh, no way could this possibly be correct!! So I signed in to the $fruit portal that $mdm pointed me towards, which honestly I didn’t recognize, but I figured it had been so long since I set all this up that I’d probably just forgotten about it. Sure enough, there was no option to renew the certificate, only create a new one. So I did, and applied it, and to the surprise of no one, nothing worked. \n\nWell shit. \n\nWith panic setting in, I started doing more digging. Turns out the certs should last a full year, but that would have meant mine expired prematurely, as I had set $mdm up originally and I haven’t been with the company a full year yet. So maybe it was a problem with $mdm...? but now, having replaced the cert, there was no real way to tell. I thought it might still be in my Downloads folder, but nope... there was the app-purchasing cert, still there from way back when I started, but no $fruit syncing cert. So, getting desperate, I phoned $fruit company and asked if there was *any possible way* they might still have the original cert, such that I might be able to renew it, since it shouldn't have actually expired yet. After an escalation, they said that if I couldn’t see the old cert on my $fruit account, it probably was not generated under that account. \n\nIt was at this point I should have put two and two together. But instead I said “but that’s not possible! This is the only $fruit account I ever made for this company!” To get me off the phone, they promised to send me an email where I could provide some written details, and they’d escalate once again. Fine. So I hung up, and while waiting for the email, I called $mdm. \n\n$mdm wanted me to look at the change log, something I didn’t even know existed. We couldn’t find any record of me ever setting up the cert, going back to the time I joined the company. “But that’s impossible!” I said once again. “I set everything in $mdm up, the only other person who could have....”\n\nAnd that’s when it dawned on me. \n\nThis whole time, I had been trying to avoid involving the higher-ups in this, figuring that I had fucked up but I wanted to be *absolutely sure* this was irrecoverable before announcing that we’d need to manually reset 400 $fruits. But at that moment I realized, the only other person who knew enough, and had been there long enough, to have possibly done anything to $mdm was none other than my highly-technically-inclined $CIO. So, after 3 hours of frustration, panicking, and phone calls, I went to his office. \n\n“Hey, $CIO,” I said, “a critical $fruit cert expired today in $mdm. Would you happen to remember setting up such a cert about a year ago?\n\n“Oh, yeah! I remember that. I can update it from my $fruit account right now.” A few clicks later and it was done. And amazingly, despite what the documentation said, everything continued working as it should have, with no re-provisioning necessary. \n\nTL;DR: the certificate being created before I started was \"impossible.\" The certificate being created from a different account was also \"impossible.\" Turns out, that's exactly what happened. Less panicking, more critical thinking needed!\n\nEDIT: I have another story that would work with the same title, if you're interested.",

The voicemail was something along the lines of \"I'm having an issue with program x, could you remote in and take a look as I'm not sure u/MCManiac52 will be able to solve it\" As the call was made to my boss's mobile and not the office number (a ticket wasn't raised with us either) the issue is classed as low priority and handled when we're free. This all happened at about half 9 this morning.\n\nFast forward an hour or so and the client calls the office number this time, and fortunately my boss had just gone out. I answer the phone, and get everything I'm expecting to here;\n\nC - Client\n\nB - Boss\n\nM - Me\n\nC: Hi M is B there?\n\nM: I'm afraid not he just went out, is there anything I can help with?\n\nC: Well I'm having an issue with program x but I'm not sure if you'll be able to solve it as you don't have much experience with it.\n\nM: Well I can definitely take a look, am I okay to remote in?\n\nC: Sure.\n\nSo I remote into the client's machine and they show me what's going on, an error message pops up saying that they are already logged into a separate session and therefore can't access this part of the program. All I had to do was check the disconnected sessions of said program, sure enough there was one for the client, log it off, restart this session, and boom, everything is working as it should be. All of which took about 5 minutes.\n\nMoral of the story, just because you have little experience with a certain program, doesn't mean you can't read an error message and work out the issue.\n\nTL;DR: Client asks boss to solve an issue because they think I'm incapable of it. Client calls back and boss is unavailable so I deal with the issue and solve it within 5 minutes.",

She tells me about the issues saying that my cousin wasn't able to connect to the internet but she gets internet on her phone. I looked at her phone, yep using data.\n\nI go grab the notepad of her passwords, she's getting up there in years, and log into the wifi and go to the management page.

I go and look at the AP and the modem and noticed they tech just hooked my grandma's computer directly to the modem and didn't connect the AP. Ask grandma if there was any other Ethernet cables the tech left. She said no. Gathering my son so i can go home and make an ethernet cable for her i spot the bright yellow cable my ISP gives out to customers. Grab it plug the modem to the AP and the computer to the AP.

Go through the basic troubleshooting bc i know they have to go over it with me to cover their ass. I was in that situation before.\n\nInstead of just lying and  just saying i'm doing the basic troubleshooting that i (thought i) did, i actually go do it again with the rep. I go to unplug the ethernet from the AP(that goes to the modem) and i barely touch and it falls out. Face palm. Apparently when i moved it, i knocked the ethernet cable out enough that it stopped working... if i'd only double checked that....\n\nP.S. i also hide her network per her request and to help relatives to connect to i put on her notepad that the wifi was hidden and to google how to connect to hidden wifi\n\nTLDR; grandma didn't have internet over wifi, tech didn't connect the AP to the modem, i fixed it and then knocked the cable loose while working on her computer and didn't double check it when trying to figure out why the internet went down again until i called ISP tech support.",

Here is a brief transcript:\n\n&gt; $RESIDENT: 'Hi, $BOB, sorry to bother you but my daughter really likes you and hasn’t seen you in awhile. She wants you to come over. I told her that you are too busy and you just can’t. Well, she just told me to call you right away because the sink in her Barbie Dream House is leaking.'\n\n&gt; $BOB: You tell her, I’ll be right over. \n\nI grabbed my wrenches and arrived in 5 min.\n\n&gt; $BOB: Well, what seems to be the problem \n\n&gt; $GIRL: Its my Barbie Dream House. The sink is leaking. \n\n&gt; $BOB: Can you show me. \n\n&gt; $GIRL: Yes come quick. \n\n&gt; $BOB: Oh, I see what the problem is.

He brought it in to have us wipe it for him and make it like new.  Well, this \"old\" computer is practically brand new and had an asset tag as well as encryption software for the local hospital on it.\n\nStandard procedure is to remove asset tags when retiring equipment, so whenever we see one, we call the company to verify that it has in fact been retired, not just stolen.  I called the hospital help desk, and surprise, surprise this laptop is still active and is assigned to not just any doctor, but a department head.  As is typical when we recover these, someone from the IT dept showed up in our office 10 minutes later to take possession of it.\n\nFor those who don't know, losing equipment with protected health information on it is a serious issue.  Lucky for this doctor, it was encrypted, so isn't a reportable loss, but he's going to be in deep shit tomorrow when he gets to work.\n\nTLDR - Doctors are complete idiots when it comes to computers and often common sense in general.\n\nEDIT: Head of IT just stopped by with a Thank You card and gift cards.",

I scratch my head, because I know I've issued a laptop to this user that gives her full access to everything she needs to do her work. I proceed to tell her, \"No, it isn't possible. I'm sorry.\" To which she responds, \"You just flat out don't want to do it or do I need to ask (the CEO) for permission?\" \n\nI explain, \"It's just not a good security practice. I would have no way of controlling patch updates and other security features on your home machine because you are running a home version of the OS we use. We also have licensing agreements that say we'll install certain software we pay for on company computers only.\" \n\nI then ask, \"What's the problem with your laptop?\" She then proceeds to tell me that she is tired of having to bring it into the office once a month for patch updates. I calmly explain that if she would leave the laptop on and running at home for a few hours a week, the patches would be pushed to the system and there would be no need for her to bring it in, as the only folks we ask to bring in their laptops are those that consistently fail to be patched automatically. \n\nShe, of course, storms off after her request saying she's going to the CEO. Well. The CEO had my back. \"She (like everyone else) is subject to the way you administer the computers. There's no wiggle room,\" he told me. \n\nI don't know why, but the whole situation blows me away. If you don't like bringing in your PC every month, then do what I'm asking and leave it running a few hours a week. If not, is it really that much of an inconvenience to have to bring your laptop in and drop it off for less than an hour one time per month!?! Your office is literally down the hall from mine. lol",

For those unfamiliar to dial-up, it requires a fairly clean connection, or else the connection slows or even drops completely.  After attempting several different things such as removing other devices from the phone line, entering connection strings, etc, we had no success.  In my frustration (and perhaps dedication to my employer) I decided to make a site visit.  My job didn't require it, but I just \\*had\\* to figure out what in the world was going on.\n\nI drove the 50 miles to the customer's house, which I might add was well off the beaten path.  I had my trusty laptop with me and plugged it into a phone jack in the house.  After starting the dialing sequence and listening to the connection negotiation, I noticed an odd occurrence.  About once a second, the negotiation sounds would go silent and start over.  This is when I decided to disconnect everything and pick up a handset.\n\nIn the background of the dial tone, I could hear a clicking noise.  I pressed a button to silence the tones to hear more clearly and heard a distinctive \\*tick\\*...\\*tick\\*...\\*tick\\* going on, once a second.  That's when memories of my childhood growing up on the farm kicked in.  I asked if the customer had recently installed an electric fence.  They noted that they had.  We went outside and lo and behold... the electric fence box was located next to the phone line entrance.  I had them unplug it and we successfully connected!\n\nAfter this experience, I added electric fences to my list of questions to be asked of customers having connection difficulties.  It ended up resolving more than one problem in my tenure.\n\nTL;DR: I drove 50 miles to find out an electric fence was preventing a dial-up customer from connecting.",

These computers wipe anything added after restarting, so this would be an extra step for something temporary.\n\nI spoke with the director of the student center, who explained that members of the public are allowed to come in and use the computers but she doesn't want them printing because they're supposed to go to our campus library for that. Fair enough.\n\nI call the event coordinator who put in the request and walk her through our options. I ask if Secure Print is an option for them, and it doesn't sound like something they want to rely on. She normally logs into the event laptops on her profile, then will be running around, so anybody who needed to print would need her ID badge. I offer her a compromise and tell her I can add the printer to bypass Secure Print onto those event laptops, and it will be on there for future events in the student center. This is the best option for her. We set up a time where she reserves the room she's needing and will do a dry-run of the event setup. I let her know I would like to try it remotely but will come over if need be.\n\nShe calls me this morning from the room and explains that it's giving them an error when logging in. There's two other staff members in there helping her. The error is normally when the computer has no network connection and can't login to the domain. I run them through general troubleshooting, like asking if there was another port they could try, checking for lights on the NIC, and restarting. She said there was only one port in that room, there were lights, and even restarting did not help. One of the staff just asked if I could come over there as \"It would make things easier for them.\" I bring over a spare network switch I have with some cables as I know the event will require multiple laptops to be networked.\n\nI get over there and I see almost immediately why it's not working. There were no lights on the NIC, and there were two network drops on the wall. It was plugged into one marked \"Phone\" instead of the one marked \"Data.\" The cable still feels loose, so I replace it with one that's plugged in securely. After that, everything starts working.\n\nRemember rule number 1: Users lie.",

I find it 7 years later and kill the partition.",

        "text": "Usual FTP; LTL...\n\nI work 1st/2nd line for a medium sized company, but we don't get many 1st line type calls onto the desk, so it's often the weird and wonderful I need to deal with. I've been here for around 7 months and it's good! People are friendly and generally are aware that I largely know my stuff. Today, my eczema has really taken a bad turn after a couple of weeks of stress and it's started to blister, so I was told by my boss to go the GPs as early as possible (I know, right?!?!?). So off I go to get ~~my hand chopped off~~ anything I need to get for it and head home after.\n\nThis is a ticket I'm currently working on which I need to take a minute out for... Usually, people know if I ask them to do something in regard to a ticket, it's for a reason. I'm pretty methodical in my approach and I often explain why I'm asking for something, which I've done!\n\nThis particular problem is where one of our financial officers (as well as someone completely different in HR) is experiencing a strange issue in printing an e-mail from Outlook. The header and such is fine, but the body, which mainly consists of a table, has a huge margin on the left hand side of the page and prints off the edge of the right. Puzzling.\n\nThus far, I've checked the settings on the application, checked it's in memo mode, checked the margins and so on and everything LOOKS normal. My settings are fine and I don't get the issue, so I'm trying to work out what's different.\n\n**$Me** is, well... me.\n\n**$FinOff** is my illustrious colleague.\n\n**$FinOff2** is my illustrious colleague's illustrious colleague.\n\n**$FinOffBoss** is their boss. Actually a pretty good guy with tech and knows we do things the way we do for a reason and complies.\n\n**$Me**: Hi FinOff, can you forward that onto $FinOffBoss and ask if they can print it to see if they get the same issue? My settings are all the same and I'm printing fine but I want to check it all anyway to make sure.\n\n**$FinOff**: Hi $Me, no-one else gets these reports, just me and other $FinOff2 and they come out the same.\n\nSo, 2 people having the same issue with the same report, but they are both sent the report directly. I've asked you to forward it onto someone else. I'm well aware your boss doesn't get this report. Just do what I ask. Please. You know I've gone home for the day and typing is hard enough as it is. Just do it.\n\nThis interaction goes on for another 2 e-mails back and forth.\n\n**$FinOff**: When I forward it onto $FinOffBoss it doesn't come out the same.\n\nExcellent, so this is telling me that there's something wrong with your settings which you've already sent to me. Isolating the issue like a boss...\n\n**$Me**: Ok, can you ask $FinOffBoss to send me a copy of the same print settings so I can see if there are any discrepancies or anything that stands out?\n\n**$FinOff**: Hi $Me, it won't be the same off his computer as I have forwarded an e-mail to him. It doesn't look the same.\n\n\\*Facedesk\\*\n\n*This is as far as this story goes for now. I'm aware that forwarding the e-mail will make things look different, it adds a new set of headers to the e-mail with more body, but please just do as I say... I'm 5 miles away and it will take me another hour to get up to the office because of the joys of the British public transport system, and by the time I get there I'll be coming back again anyway.*\n\n*\\*RobsEdit\\* - I politely explained myself further following all of this, how I know that it will look a little different, but just please, do what I ask. I've just had another e-mail back:*\n\n***$FinOff:*** *Hi $Me, you really need to see it, so when you're up here, pop over.*\n\n*I'm tempted to change my colleague's variable name here...*",

        "text": "Hello TFTS, long time lurking and I was hoping to share a story someday.    \nI got pretty excited when I got into a situation I knew was finally worth sharing, soooo FTP as well!  \nPlease forgive any formatting errors and be advised English is not my first language.\n\n\n    Some context:  \nI am, among other things, an \"IT coordinator\" in a small call center: meaning I have no formal training in IT but can google better than the next person and have an interest in the field.  \nI'm used to fixing the small stuff (My coworkers are for the most part almost computer-illiterate. Not judging, just an empirical observation) and I am in charge of escalating to a local MSP in a clear and descriptive manner when I feel the issue is above my skillset. \n\n\nEarly one morning, a visibly annoyed phone operator ($PO) came into my office with an issue she could not resolve:\n\n&gt;**$PO**: Hello $Me, I'm sorry to bother you but my computer will not turn back on, there is no light when I press the power button.\n\n&gt;**$me**: Hey, that's no trouble I'm here for that, I'll come check it out.\n\nI left my almost pristine cup of coffee on my desk with deep regrets and followed her\n\nNow I already knew this one was going to be weird: either a really simple fix or a pretty bad case of user error resulting in dead hardware.  \nThat feeling came from the fact she was nervously rubbing her hands together, sign of a sound mind in turmoil over a fuckup.  The word \"guilt\" was practically embossed on her forehead.\n\nI got to her desk and found the really small form factor (something like 20cm x 20 x 5) desktop they use resting on a small rack under her table.  \nI got down on my knees to check it and Immediately noticed something weird: it was upside down.\n\nI Fiddle with it a bit and notice the power cable was slightly unplugged. *easy peasy*  \nI make sure it's back in place, flip the small PC and press the power button. A reassuring green light winks at me.\n\n&gt;**$me**: Well that should do it, it was just not plugged in properly. The weird thing is that it was upside down, did you do that? \n\n&gt;**$PO**: ... *watching her display intently*\n\n&gt;**$me**: ... *at this point I thought I had broken her mind in some way*\n\nI was standing behind her desk, so, slightly suprised by her silence and reaction, I got around it to face her monitor.  \n\n&gt;**$me**: Huh?\n\nThe Windows loading screen was upside down.   \nafter 2-3 seconds of total silence with my head tilted sideways for some reason, an epiphany washed over me and I repressed what was the beginning of a very large grin.\n\n&gt;**$me**: *Looking at her* Did you?...\n\nI met her gaze.\n\nHer eyes were begging me not to finish my sentence. They were silently praying to a higher power for forgiveness and, most of all: oblivion.  \n\nI did not have the heart to confront her. The look on her face had confirmed my hunch and my body language was probably screaming \"oh I know\". That was enough.  \n\n&gt;**$me**: I'll be right back, I have to check something.\n\n&gt;**$PO**: *Kinda whispering* Thank you.\n \nTurns out before ~~bothering~~ coming to see me, she had just finished cleaning her keyboard with a damp cloth while the computer was on.  \nShe had therefore managed to make her screen do a 180 by pure luck (or lack thereof).  \nTaken aback, a thought so pure it must have hurt formed in her mind: by flipping her PC upside down (and accidentally disconnecting the power cable), it would surely make the screen flip back... right?\n\nNope, but A for creativity. \n\nI got back to my desktop, found out there's a combination of keys that allows you to rotate your screen, went to her desk to fix it and went on with my day with a big ol' smile on my face.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n",

Can I please have your student ID? Thank you $lady, what seems to be your issue today?.\n\n$lady: I have a paper due that I just finished. It is due by midnight tonight (it was like 11:15pm) and my Internet isn't working.\n\n$me: ma'am I'm not supposed to diagnose residential Internet issues, that being said I am gonna ask you a few questions.\n\n$lady: Thank you.\n\n$me: 1. Have you tried restarting your computer? 2. Have you tried resetting your modem? 3. Does anyone else in the house have internet access or is it just you?\n\n$lady: I restarted my computer. Idk what a modem is (at this time she yells for her daughter and asks her if she knows where the modem is. At this point I am talking to both of them which is sub optimal).\n\n$me: Who is your Internet Service Provider. She says $isp, so I start describing what the modem looks like and where it might be located. (at this point she cuts me off).\n\n$lady: this paper is due in 40 minutes I don't have time for a scavenger hunt, can't you remote into my computer and just fix this.\n\n$me: (regretting getting myself into this mess). Ma'am I'm sorry for your frustration, if your internet isn't working I can't remote into your PC. Without a connection. Can you hover over the wifi icon in the lower right hand corner and tell me if it says \"connected but no internet\"\n\n$lady: yes that's what it says.\n\n$me: okay ma'am your service could be down from your provider which I can't fix, we can try one thing if you can't find your router. If this doesn't work you might have to go to a McDonald's near by and use their public wifi or find an alternate method. If we discover that your wifi is down I'll provide you with a ticket ID to refer to your instructor and I can talk with him about our conversation if we can't correct the issue.\n\n$lady: okay what do you want me to do.\n\n$me: okay this is going to sound complicated but I promise we can't break anything. Just follow my instructions.\n1. Click on with windows icon (win10) in the lower left hand corner. Type cmd.exe. Right click the cmd.exe icon and click run as administrator.\n\n2. Once it is up I have 3 commands for you to type.\n a. ipconfig /release\n b. ipconfig /renew\n c. ipconfig /flushdns\n\nI explain how the commands will run and that renew in particular could take a second to complete.\n\nShe completes the tasks as instructed and then.\n\n$lady: *gasps* IT DISAPPEARED WHAT DID YOU DO! *CLICK* (she hung up on me).\n\nI get a call back nearly immediately\n\n$me: hello I.T.-\n\n$lady: I need to speak with your manager. *in the background* MOM! THE INTERNETS BACK. *click*.\n\nShe hung up on me again. I never heard anything from this lady again but what a way to handle the situation. I mean I know I kind of created the issue for myself, but I went above and beyond and not even a thank you or anything. ;-; makes me cri evertim.\n\n\nEdit: anyone who wants to know.

They put me in a training class of about 10 people to watch the mandatory videos about safety, workplace harassment, etc etc. The two HR people leading the class queued up the first video and left the room while we watched. $HRLady1 wrote her desk phone number on the whiteboard so we could call if there were any issues.\n\nAbout a minute into the video, it started to freeze up. The sound still played (mostly), but the video would stop on a frame for a while before moving to another frame and freezing again. $Classmate1 began to call $HRLady1, but I got up and went over to the keyboard to see if I could see what was wrong with the video.\n\nI checked to see if anything else was running on the computer (there wasn't), closed the video, and restarted it. This time it played fine, which was lucky because $HRLady1 didn't answer her phone. While I was at it, I turned the volume up on the speakers connected to the computer because it was pretty low.\n\nApparently this was sufficient to impress my classmates, prompting $Classmate2 to tell me, \"You should be in IT!\" Nothing against any of them; they all seem to be perfectly competent and intelligent people, and I think it was a combination of the bystander effect and it being everyone's first day that stopped anyone else from trying to fix the issue. That does seem like a low threshold for technical wizardry, however.",

Can't interact with any of the elements inside of them, can't close them or drag them around. So I shove her aside and get to work.

        "text": "Hi all. I work for a cable ISP serving small to mid-sized communities doing tech support. We offer Internet, Cable TV, and Phone services. Like all utility providers, we have outages. Usually they're just for one city, one neighborhood, or even just one street. But every once in a while, it breaks for everyone. We had this happen the day after a holiday.\n\nShortly before clocking in, my team noticed the queue jumping from 4 idle to 30 in queue. By the time we clocked in, it had shot up to 50 and an outage had been posted. Essentially the customer phone systems went down. All of them. Perfect. Most calls went smoothly, various versions of \"Oh, okay, it's not just me. I'll give it a while.\" Others, however..\n\nIn this story, I will be VK, and the caller will be Outage Guy (OG)\n\nVK: Thanks for calling $ISP. My name is VK, how my I assist you?\n\nOG: Yeah, I can't use my phone this morning. \n\nVK: I understand. I apologize for the interruption to your service. Unfortunately we are experiencing an outage affecting the phone services of most $ISP subscribers. We are working on the issue and will have everything up and running again as soon as we can.\n\nOG: ... So when are you sending the tech out?\n\nVK: I'm sorry?\n\nOG: You're sending a tech to my house. I told you my phone doesn't work, and I want a tech to fix it.\n\nVK: Unfortunately this is not an issue with your equipment or the lines in or around your home. We would not be able to send technician to your home for this. \n\nOG: ... So you're not going to fix this?\n\nVK: We are currently working on the issue. We will have your phone back in working order as soon as we can. \n\nOG: You're useless, you know that?  \n\n\\*click\\*\n\nLather, rinse, repeat for the following 8 hours.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nI forgot the best part:\n In order to get to me, the caller had to hear a message that stated there was a company wide phone outage that was being worked on.

        "text": "I've been working support for a cable ISP for a few months. Recently I took a call from a customer who said that she'd gotten a particular agent two times and both times her call had dropped after a few minutes. Something clicked and I realized I'd heard the same story from a few other callers in the past few weeks, always about the same agent. She (the agent) had dutifully noted the call drops in the tickets. I got suspicious and did some digging in this agent's past tickets and found several dozen drops a month. Seeing as I average maybe one or two drops a week, this seemed excessive.\n\nI pulled the accounts of those customers with dropped calls and noticed they all had our telephony phone service--basically a cable modem with analog phone ports. So I went back to the most recent, the one I'd talked to. Her modem had uptime that put its last reset right when that second call dropped. Yeah, you know where this is going.\n\nSo I grabbed an engineer who has access to the user logs on the switches and sure enough, this agent had issued reset commands twice on the caller that day. We pulled logs on a half dozen other dropped call tickets for that agent, and every one of them had their phone system reset mid-call.\n\nI was told later they set up a trap call to see her do it. Every call she got, first thing she did was check to see if the call was coming from our telephony system. If it was, she'd go through the motions for a few minutes and then reset them modem to kill the call, all in the name of bringing down her handle time. She'd been doing it for at least six months.\n\nI hope her job search goes well.",

        "text": "This is fresh from the ~~oven~~Microsoft Outlook. It's been barely half an our since I read the mails.\n\nFirst; preface... I'm Zztri, I'm a developer specialized in a few branches of the buzzword \"Smart Cities\". I'm also known as an undertaker - whenever I join a project this means it's dying and my job's to save the project if I can or at least lower the impact of failure.\n\nLately I became a consultant for an energy company for a GIS - geographical information systems - project. I did what I could for a  couple months but my kidneys acted up - kidney stones so my doctor asked me to take a few days off and enjoy some thermal spa.\n\nTen days before I started contacting every single person responsible with the project, telling them;\n\n&gt;Because of health problems, I'll be unreachable from *last wednesday night* to *this monday morning*. Please contact me ASAP if anything urgent needs to be done. I won't be reachable at all during this period.\n\nWednesday night I set up the auto-responder simply reminding people the same thing and set out to the spa. As principle, my business phone was off and noone knows my personal phone #. I do not use social media at all, not even linkedin.\n\nAnyway, I had a good time and I feel much better now. Today at 7am, I decided to check out my mail messages for the first time in four days. About 200+ mails in four days, including the weekend.\n\n&gt;*Luser #1*: I can't login to the reporting system.\n\n&gt;*My auto-responder*: I'm at vacation, remember?\n\n&gt;*Luser #1*: I just realized it needs me to be inside the office to login to the reporting system. There must be a way to check out the progress at home. **(Of course, genius, intranet applications can only be reached in the office network)**\n\n&gt;*My auto-responder*: I'm on vacation, remember?\n\n&gt;*Luser #1*: I know you're on vacation but I'd like to check out reports outside the office. Can't you quickly fix something?\n\n&gt;*My auto-responder*: I'm on vacation, remember?\n\n&gt;*Luser #1*: I spoke to CTO and he said you're unreachable until Monday morning. In case you read this, I need it earlier if you can.\n\n&gt;*My auto-responder*: I'm on vacation, remember?\n\n......\n\n&gt;*Luser #2*: I just got a great idea. We need templates for certain field infrastructures so our field agents will do less work. **(Oh good idea, something similar to the 'Templates' in the main menu, right in front of you?)**\n\n&gt;*My auto-responder*: I'm on vacation, remember?\n\n&gt;*Luser #2*: *(This one's CC'ed to the CTO)* I know you're on vacation but this is urgent. I'd like to see you take immediate action.\n\n&gt;*My auto-responder*: I'm on vacation, remember?\n\n&gt;*CTO*: Zztri is on vacation. Is there something wrong with the template system already implemented?\n\n&gt;*Luser #2*: *(responding to both CTO and me)* What template system, noone trained me about the template system.\n\n&gt;*My auto-responder*: I'm on vacation, remember?\n\n&gt;*CTO*: We were in the same training session when Zztri showed about it. It's also in the training material, video 'Field Operator Actions' starting at xx:yy:zz. Field operators are actively using the templates; for example I can see four different templates for transformer buildings in area N.\n\n&gt;*Luser #2*: *(still responding to both CTO and me)* Oh I see. I'll check it out.\n\n&gt;*My auto-responder*: I'm on vacation, remember?\n\n.....\n\nThese people are responsible electricity in a large area of my country. They ought to make snap, educated decisions in times of crisis.... I'll stockpile candles.",

After a certain amount of time without logging in, a student or alum account gets deactivated, and after reactivation, it takes until about midnight for account information to sync with the student records server. This information includes things like transcripts. Transcripts are easiest to access through the official student portal, although there are other ways to get it, namely coming into the student records office.\n\nThe other day I ($me) had this user ($alum) give us a call:\n\n**$alum:** \"Hi, I'd like to access my unofficial transcript. I keep trying to log in but it's telling me my login information doesn't match any active accounts.\"\n\n**$me:** \"Hey there! What's your username?\"\n\n**$alum:** *$username*\n\n**$me:** \"As I suspected, looks like your account was deactivated since you haven't logged into your account for awhile. Let me just reactivate it for you, and you'll be able to access your unofficial transcript about 24 hours from now.\"\n\n**$user:** \"Can't you get it to me any sooner?\"\n\nOh boy. I've had people like this before. They've procrastinated something too long and now they won't be able to get their transcript in time for their whatever.\n\n**$me:** \"Well, the soonest it could possibly be on your account would be at midnight... if you need it sooner, our student records offices close in about 45 minutes and you would be able to go there and they could print out your unofficial transcript for you.\"\n\n**$user:** \"No, I live in $suburb-that's-less-than-5-miles-away, I can't possibly come in. I need it by midnight tonight, can't you just mail it to me?\"\n\n**$me:** \"Um, I'm not sure that we can email you your—\"\n\n**$user:** \"No. I don't want you to email it to me. I need it printed out and mailed to me. Can't you do that?\"\n\n**$me:** \"Uhhhh... I don't think the mail would get it to you in time. I'm going to transfer you to student records once I get you into your account.\"\n\nIt's not my problem that you put this off for too long. It's your problem. There's even a very simple solution. If you don't have a car we even have this thing called public transit and it definitely goes to your suburb.\n\nThe mail system doesn't work like you think it does.",
