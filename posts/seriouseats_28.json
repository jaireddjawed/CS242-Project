        "text": "Let's use an example. Let's say you've got a recipe for chicken soup that you want to scale up from ~4 servings to ~25 for an event. This means more prep time, more ingredients, more $$, bigger pots, more labor, etc. But in theory, as long as the proportions stay the same, cook times should be equal and the outcomes should be the same. A bowl of chicken soup *should* taste the same whether it came out of a small batch or a larger batch.\n\nBut is this assumption true? Do recipes change depending on scale? Aside from hardware/storage requirements, are there certain considerations to take into account when cooking in larger quantities as opposed to smaller quantities?",

Almost like vegan anchovy. In order to make them, put a 1-2 mm of olive oil in a small sauce pan, throw in some-paper towel-dried capers and shake once in a while. After 5 minutes or so the capers are quite dark, a bit smaller and crunchy. The frying removes all the acid and you are left with crunchy salty taste bombs!\n\n(*) Not really, had some soup as a starter.",

        "text": "Hello all!\n\nSo I tried following /u/J_Kenji_Lopez-Alt recipe for bratwurst and the end result was tasty - but very different. I typically try to cook my bratwurst on the grill over very low heat and turning them almost constantly in an effort to cook them without breaking the casings, and the result definitely is a very strongly flavored and very aromatic sausage.\n\nSo I decided to try Kenji's method, used an oktoberfest beer, and the result was *far* less flavorful. I mostly got a weak sausage taste, and a mild beer taste, combined together.\n\nI'm trying to diagnose where I went wrong.\n\n1st - I didn't put mustard in the beer (I just forgot) so I don't know if that would make a huge difference.\n\n2nd - The fact that the sausages tasted so strongly of beer made me think there was some kind of osmotic pressure problem going on; that the salt in the sausage was leaving and the beer was filling its place. Am I correct in this estimation? And if so is this something the mustard would have fixed OR should I add mustard and salt?\n\nThanks for the guidance!",

        "text": "Easily my favorite shrimp scampi recipe.  \n\nI like scampi with pasta and scampi to me has always seemed like a dangerous flavor game.  You make this acidic, garlicky, buttery sauce that any seafood tastes good in and then you toss it with a pound of pasta and (sometimes) everything goes to heck.  The flavor disappears....so you make more sauce next time.  It turns soupy so you try the pasta water trick to thicken it and it just becomes too much.  At least that's been my history.\n\nDaniel's recipe really shines with the lemon and tarragon.  It spread very well into the pasta like one of those chromatography experiments in chemistry class with the paper and colors.  Lemon zest and pasta go a long way to drawing out that scampi flavor into a full meal.  I added some chopped basil to the parsley and it played very nice.  \n\nThe sauce is key.....he noted to really focus on emulsifying the butter and reduced wine and I tried to really control the heat and keep it from breaking.  The result was a relatively small quantity of sauce (1/4 cup reduced vermouth plus a few Tbs of butter) that coated a pound of linguine really well with no extra sauce pooling in the bottom of the mixing bowl.  I'll echo other commenters that you want to be careful with the salt on the shrimp ahead of time.  I only used 1/2 tsp and it was as far as I'd go.  The baking soda really works and the shrimp were cooked well.  \n\nThe recipe was fast and easy....but I'd like to experiment with adding in the Kenji technique of infusing the oil or butter with the shrimp shells.  Yes, scampi should be fast and easy but we all love a good project.",

Is it better to go with no batter/batter? What's the best ratio of coconut to breadcrumbs?",
