Also a lot of their society is based on Confucianism which is a religion that originated in China. How was Chinese culture able to make such a big impact in those countries?",

Now, if I eat 2000 calories of sweet potatoes, that would weigh around 5 pounds - again, I eat them all, step on the scale now I should weigh 5 more pounds than I did before. \n\nHow do our bodies process the same number of calories that are so different in quantities and weight? If I burn all 2000 calories, what happens to the 5 lbs. of potatoes - is it just sent to the bowels? If I weigh 200 lbs. then 201, after pasta, or 205 after the potatoes - how long does it take to go back to weighing 200 lbs. assuming I don't eat or anything else?",

I can see that there would be pressure, but then how can gas molecules themselves take up more space/expand if what originally was in the container fit perfectly, would that just mean that this is not a true closed system?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould this maybe be due to the fact that there is gas already present in container itself?
