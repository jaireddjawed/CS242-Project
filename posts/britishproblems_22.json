Didn’t register to me that I was still wearing goggles and also had a sharp object in my hand. As you can imagine I was met with looks of confusion all round. Realising I was essentially holding a weapon and looking like a nutter, I swiftly hid it behind my back. It was it this point Spotify decided to play “O Fortuna” and for no reason what so ever, to play it at full volume. As if that wasn’t enough for these poor people, I have a housemate that works in events and decided to test a dry ice machine and some lights he’d just bought so there was a stream of eerie, strobing smoke flowing out from around the living room door, which they could clearly see then to top it all off the dog started going berserk and howling because he wanted to go out. This all happened very quickly and all I could think of to say was “I’m not going swimming”. Without saying a word, one of them slowly leaned over and placed a flyer on my doorstep.
