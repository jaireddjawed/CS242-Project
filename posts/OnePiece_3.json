        "text": "I want to start off by saying that I like Arlong. I would even go so far as to say that I'm obsessed with him, I LOVE Arlong. From the moment I saw his wanted poster, I couldn't wait to find out who he was and what he was all about. And even though it's been a few months since I last watched the Cartoon, I can't stop thinking about how badass he is.\n\nDespite my love for Arlong, my sister is an obvious Arlong hater. She has tried time and time again to convince me that he's a bad dude, but I just don't see it. And it's got me thinking about how much people needlessly hate Arlong. I truly believe that Arlong has a lot to offer in terms of entertainment and valuable life lessons, and here are a few reasons why:\n\nFirst and foremost, Arlong can bring you happiness. I'll never forget the joy I felt on Christmas morning last year when I woke up tired and sad, only to find Arlong waiting for me in plush form under the tree. It might sound silly, but that small act of kindness brought me so much happiness and lifted my spirits.\n\nIn addition to bringing joy to your life, Arlong can also teach you valuable life lessons. For all the Arlong haters out there, it's important to remember that even our most hated enemies are not just faceless villains, but real people with their own stories and struggles. And while we may not agree with their actions, we can at least try to understand where they are coming from. Arlong is a complex character with a rich backstory that sheds light on his motivations and desires. By taking the time to appreciate his character, we can gain a deeper understanding of human nature and the complexities of good and evil.\n\nFinally, Arlong can bring us together in a world that is often divided. As a character who has experienced firsthand the danger of prejudice and discrimination, Arlong can teach us a valuable lesson about the importance of unity and empathy. In the One Piece world, the fish people are often discriminated against by humans, leading to a great deal of racism between the two races. By watching Arlong in the show, we can learn to recognize our own prejudices and biases, and work together to overcome them.\n\nIn conclusion, I urge everyone to give Arlong a chance. He's a character that can bring happiness to your life, teach you valuable life lessons, and unite us as a society. Don't dismiss him as just another generic anime villain, take the time to appreciate his complex and mysterious personality, and try to understand where he is coming from. You might just find that he is a more interesting and compelling character than you originally gave him credit for. And with that said, I leave you with a quote from Arlong himself: \"Only those who have suffered long can see the light within the shadows.‚Äù",

Like when they make another one piece video game I‚Äôm hoping instead of using the same old fish men island outfits (which in my opinion are some of the worst designs in one piece especially the Nami and Robin) they use the raid outfits. The only two straw hats I don‚Äôt like the designs for are Chopper and Franky but everyone else look amazing. Luffy having the shanks coat, Zoro in the black gi instead of the green looks way better. Sanjis red suit is clean af, Namis outfit is rly cute especially the flower in the hair, ussops while not the best still has the head piece which I think works for him, Robins outfit makes look mysterious and yet strong. Jinbeis orange outfit colour scheme contrasts with his blue skin much better, Brooks outfit is hands down easily his best one ever. Let me know what you think.",

Interesting enough Shanks was still in the same position with Luffy taking Roger's place. I think the fear of losing Luffy brought him to that moment as a kid and his defenses momentarily faltered.",

Roger believed that his son would find the One Piece. Even though Ace lost his life maybe Roger was more right then he knew. Also I found an interesting connection, Shanks epithet is \"Red Hair\" and red is strongly associated with Roger. His name come from Jolly Roger which comes from joli rouge which means red flag. And his his lovers name was Rouge.",

        "text": "# The truth about Kizaru and Vegapunk and Kizaru's Devil Fruit \n\nIn chapter 1070, Vegapunk gives us a run down of what Devil Fruit abilities he can recreate and which ones that he cannot. He says that he tried everything he can think of, But recreating a Logia power proved too difficult. \n\n[If this statement is true, then how did Vegapunk create the same Kizaru Logia Lasers he uses for his Pacifistas? One can argue that he just recreated his own lasers studying Kizaru's abilities, BUT when the Pacifistas use them they are identical to Kizaru's lasers from his Logia fruit. So this would mean that Vegapunk can recreate Logia abilities or at least Kizaru's, but why would he lie about that? ](https://preview.redd.it/5gws6v4ztyna1.png?width=652&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=574ae723d31bfb2f8551d1cbb2783edab3fc4935)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[In the Sabaody Arc we have Drake saying that they are indeed Kizaru's lasers not just some random laser. This proves that Vegapunk can recreate Kizaru Logia abilities. Drake also seems to know about the Pacifistas. ](https://preview.redd.it/ugmbvblg5zna1.png?width=639&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f3d93b5d8e87c279fb0c2be0fcb5e7f933678d53)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This panel can go two ways. Since we just learned that the Seraphim have green blood maybe Vegapunk was working on them already and Drake knew about them because he in the previous panel I put he knew about the Pacifistas so maybe hes surprised the blood is red rather than green. Or it could just be hes knows they're cyborgs and that they even have blood. ](https://preview.redd.it/qrhphk1y5zna1.png?width=636&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3f92df48aeecf813205c9ded40807683c4123f5d)\n\nI have two scenarios on Vegapunk and Kizaru. \n\n**Scenario One:** is that Kizaru doesn't have a light logia fruit because Kizaru was created by Vegapunk and his power is just Vegapunk's technology. Which we saw so far in the Egghead arc that Vegapunk can create things purely out of light. \n\n**Scenario Two:** Vegapunk is allies with Kizaru and recreated his Logia abilities and lied about not being able to reproduce logia abilties because the WG would be unstoppable if that were the case. This would also mean Kizaru is another secret agent Vegapunk has in the World Government like Stussy. \n\n \n\n# Scenario One:\n\nKizaru is just a light being created by Vegapunk. I believe light powers are going to play a significant role later on in the story. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[This panel is showcasing how many things that Vegapunk can create purely through light and holograms. So Kizaru isn't something entirely impossible. ](https://preview.redd.it/9uxegkxp7zna1.png?width=760&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=559740545f80ab72c946e5d67aee3fba55e36638)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[We still don't know if Luffy had used haki on that light monster if he would have been able to touch him just like how haki affects logias, but we also see that Vegapunk created gloves that can be be used for this exact thing, maybe for normal people to be able to hurt logia's without haki use since Vegapunk might not have Haki.](https://preview.redd.it/3tmgdk8qzyna1.png?width=652&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4c05e99d9c32ffc11f8d3e5d70dd32f4b169a602)\n\n[Vegapunk is astonished that Franky was able to shoot a laser, Franky learned how to do this on Vegapunk's home island of Karakuri\\/ Baldimore where a young Vegapunk was creating technology. So this means that Vegapunk had Kizaru's laser technology made during this time. And why is Vegapunk so afraid of the strongest form of humanity, the seraphim being attacked by lasers? Surely they can survive a laser attack? I feel like light\\/lasers are the strongest forms of attacks because we also see Imu\\/Gorosei use some kind of ability that may use light that wiped out Lulusia. What if the Seraphim who are clones of the lunarians are extremely susceptible to light\\/laser attacks and thats how the WG defeated the Lunarians so long ago and Vegapunk knows this. ](https://preview.redd.it/6i6qgc27wyna1.png?width=654&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f77674f531a4a82640e3f9b77a2d48b71da0976e)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Scenario Two: \n\nI think Kizaru might be an ally/spy for Vegapunk. \n\nKizaru is also one of the three original Admirals from the beginning of the story who sort of gets overshadowed by the other two, Akainu and Aokiji. So I feel like the reason for this is because Oda is using him for something big to come. \n\n[Kizaru's first appearance is during the Sabaody arc and he volunteers to go investigate the island. During this time Vegapunk and Sentomaru just happen to be testing out the new Pacifistas. Coincidence? or since hes a spy for vegapunk or created\\/working with him decided to go help. If another admiral like Akainu came, he most likely would have killed all the strawhats, Kuma, and maybe some Pacifistas.  ](https://preview.redd.it/0mudx2lcvyna1.png?width=643&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=400b380a0aead9806b4a6c677dd2a106b12e1c01)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Kizaru looking for Sentomaru, because they're helping Vegapunk test the new Pacifistas.](https://preview.redd.it/keegam5o2zna1.png?width=341&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=51ef0a57078fbf657075e824bdd63b537b76a135)\n\n[Kizaru still looking for Sentomaru, Why was Sentomaru on the island with the pacifistas and why is Kizaru looking for Sentomaru when his main goal of coming there was to kill\\/capture the pirates who attacked a celestial dragon?  ](https://preview.redd.it/lov9uoop2zna1.png?width=634&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cb6378c6ce77d69a12036e4eefe11b65adaf59e1)\n\n[Also I found this panel to be suspect. Sentomaru is scolding Kizaru, who is his superior and asks him why hes using a black transponder which is used for wire taps, meaning that whatever they're doing that don't want people to find out. Why is that?](https://preview.redd.it/06jm6pm32zna1.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a49e50ca78efb4f2b80b1eb8e61e890619318a0d)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[If Kizaru is another spy for Vegapunk the he would have told Vegapunk that the WG is coming for him, because so far in Egghead Vegapunk for the life of him doesn't know how the information of him researching the Poneglyphs got leaked, meaning he would have no idea that were coming to attack him unless someone on the inside tipped him off. Maybe this can be proven wrong if it was Stussy who told him.](https://preview.redd.it/ox8us1lw1zna1.png?width=388&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5aac63674cc2bde414625567ddeab7b7e429cac7)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Kizaru again always seems to be the Admiral Linked with Vegapunk, between Sabaody and now he always decides to go. ](https://preview.redd.it/c84x8vja4zna1.png?width=440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=79b0becfeb6810e2eb08fc50e4e6d377096af364)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Maybe this is Kizaru trying to get information out of the Gorosei member. ](https://preview.redd.it/7pj9f05l3zna1.png?width=656&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=06601f4153c24c4e8ee4ab160ce1dba9f0e5314c)\n\n# Coincidence or Oda foreshadowing something?\n\nSo far in the Egghead arc it seems to somewhat parallel to the Sabaody arc. What I mean by that is in Egghead were getting the full introduction of the Seraphim, which is similar to the introduction of the Pacifistas. Also in Sabaody we got the introduction of Kizaru, Sentomaru, and a mention of Vegapunk who are all in this arc, and Kuma was in Sabaody and right now is also in this arc climbing the red line.\n\n# Multiple Failed Clone Theory \n\nThis is something small, but still connects somewhat because of Sentomaru. Sentomaru seems to have a close relationship with Vegapunk and Kizaru which before we got the Vegapunk reveal, a lot of fans theorized Kizaru was in fact Vegapunk. Sentomaru is Vegapunk's bodyguard and for some reason has a higher authority power for the Seraphim over CP agents and regular Government agents who have an authority chip. \n\nNow to get to the multiple failed clone theory. I've seen this theory going around now that we got the Stussy reveal that she is the first successful clone of Miss Buckin, that there had to be failed clones before they got it right. Most obvious candidate for that is Weevil, seeing how he claims to be Whitebeards son, his mother is supposedly Miss Buckin who was on the same crew as Whitebeard and again who was just revealed to have been cloned and she also knows Vegapunk and that he can confirm that Weevil is in fact her \"son\". So where I'm going with this is people theorize that the failed clones all have that similar scar stitching on their bodies. One obviously being Weevil, another being Crocodile and another that I don't see anyone talking about is Sentomaru. Me personally I'm not a fan of everyone is a clone theory, but if this \"scar stiching\" pattern ends up coming true then I believe that Sentomaru is another experiment of Vegapunk and if he is a clone and if its following the Rock's pirates pattern with a whitebeard clone, a stussy clone then could Sentomaru be following the Rocks clone pattern and be Silver Axe? I mean the dude carries a giant axe lol. And if Kizaru is another experiment or creation of Vegapunk this would kind of make sense why Sentomaru calls Kizaru boss/Uncle since they probably feel like family if they have the same creator.  \n\nSide note for Crocodile, for who he was clone from people say Du Feld since they look very similar, but his reason for being a failed clone would be he ended up being a girl and Ivankov changed her into a man which is what his secret is and also his new bounty poster they added \"sir\" to crocodile . Du feld has connections to Stussy, is an emperor of the underworld and it was revealed that he financed the ship on which MADS conducted their experiments. \n\n(I know the stitching scar thing is suppper reaching and Zoro breaks the scar stitching theory since he has one on his chest and a couple of random characters as well, but out of those 3 they all have it on their face and neck if that makes any sort of difference lol)\n\n# Other Random Connections/ Unexplained things:\n\nWhy was Kuma on the island? I think Dragon has had a mission to always look out for Luffy and his crew whether that be by him or Kuma or any of the revolutionaries and how that would be possible is if Dragon has a Vivre card for Luffy. It would explain how knew Luffy would be at Logue town, and when to send Kuma to Sabaody. \n\nOther random things I found that parallel Egghead with Sabaody is the cover stories for Sabaody feature the CP9 agents who also are on Egghead now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[I know this was a Pacifista, but Kuma was on the island. ](https://preview.redd.it/pn0pz7hd2zna1.png?width=637&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5ea2258a6b02b6fc24c1021cbfe81368a8a6c693)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Another foreshadowing to the Egghead arc with the reveal of clones ](https://preview.redd.it/1kht4r7zdzna1.png?width=642&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=92d87ff903af9c373e04cc92f1501b72d662a8a1)\n\nSummed up version:\n\nKizaru was created by Vegapunk and is a light being. Vegapunk said he can't recreate Logia abilities, but somehow recreated Kizaru's logia laser abilities for the pacifistas. We've seen in Egghead that he can create an entire amusement park and beings made of light/holograms. \n\nIf Vegapunk didn't create him I think Kizaru is a spy and that he tipped Vegapunk off about the WG coming to kill him. From the few appearances we get Kizaru its almost always linked to Sentomaru and Vegapunk. From the Sabaody Arc and now on Egghead. \n\nPlot Hole\\*\\*\\* \n\nVegapunk would have been around 7 Years old if that was the case since hes 65, Kizaru is currently 58, but we learned that the two years Franky spent on Vegapunk's home island lab he learned how to create the same lasers as Vegapunk/Kizaru, meaning even though Vegapunk was young that technology was there in that lab. (I know the age timeline is a super reach, but maybe oda will retcon something or its something like Vegapunk creating him later on as a full adult that then Kizaru joined the marines)\n\nWould love to know everyone's thoughts on this theory, I know its super reaching and if you have anything else to help support it please let me know and any other huge plot holes that kill the theory let me know as well.",

        "text": "Like, we can all argue about how he's a coward or how he's objectively the weakest straw hat rn, but he gets it. Everybody's freaking out over sanji x nami, sanji x zolo, luffy x Hancock. Luffy and Hancock have the most chemistry, but only because Hancock is dripping for luffys one piece, luffy might as well be cannonically aroace. Same but reverse with sanji x nami and I'm not even looking at sanji x zolo. But usopp x nami and usopp x Robin have real palpable chemistry on screen and I was even surprised to find not many people acknowledge this. By virtue of being the only regular acting person, he has gained the respect of women, paralleling real life. Let's be honest here the only reason sanji isn't universally hated is bc he's strong, he's got an angsty backstory and he's kinda cute. If he was a sweaty fat man he would get dunked on bc of nami and robin. Usopp is the only reasonable shop, maybe only being rivalled by franky x Robin but basically only bc of thriller bark. \n\n\n\n\n\nJesus christ I should go outside",
