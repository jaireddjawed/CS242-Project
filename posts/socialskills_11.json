I know im an introvert after taking a personality test but idk if i just dont like talking to people or something affecting me from socialising. I can maintain a convo if its in my interests but cant start one for shit. I dont even get how people find things to talk about, maybe i just dont have many things that interest me. I literally dont go out unless i have to eat or go to school or something that i want to do so i dont get the chance to socialise. The most recent effort i put in is about 3 weeks ago where i found meetup.com and joined a charity volleyball group. I do find it lonely sometimes when i have no one to talk to or i become conscious that im alone. But most of the time, im fine when im just playing games, watching anime or youtube. I see many of my peers getting girlfriends so im slowly starting to lose confidence in myself. I guess im really asking how much socialising is too little? And what im doing is too little, how can i start? I dont have a wide group of friends, i have 1 childhood friend whom i consider a close friend but dont really keep in touch. My other friends are in a different academic so they are in exam week while its my holidays now.",

It makes me feel like everyone is watching me, and that I've done or am doing things poorly and/or making a fool out of myself to a large audience.\n\nI feel like I'm more resentful nowadays.

If I go even a little bit without their attention/validation, I feel super anxious and miserable. Then, I'll see them typing at me and I feel like I get this hit of dopamine.\n\nThis most often happens with my most distant friends emotionally. It's like I'm addicted to feeling special to them, since they usually tend to be more reserved, I feel like me being able to get them to really like me proves that I'm special or something?\n\nI know this behavior is definitely stemming from my anxiety, and total lack of confidence/self love. but I feel like I have no clue what to do about that.\n\nTL:DR: I get really attached to my friends to an unhealthy degree, and need help stopping.",

I had an small friend group in my freshman year, but we've basically stopped talking and in that year my mental health started getting pretty bad. In the following two years, I lost almost every relationship I had, including new ones that I’d made in that time, because I became so shy and nervous (I was diagnosed with Social Anxiety in my junior year). Skip ahead to this year, and a good friend of mine (pretty much the only one who didn’t give up on me) has basically inducted me into her friend group. I get along with everyone, and they've all been so incredibly kind to me, but I'm always so anxious around them because I really don't want to lose these relationships. I end up feeling like I’m suffocating whenever I’m with other people. I’m just terrified.\n\nI feel hopeless about making new friends in college. I’m incredibly insecure, self-conscious, and afraid, and I don’t know how to fix that without also becoming/coming off as arrogant or cocky. I have no idea what the line is, and the only way I’ve successfully made any new friends has been through other people, instead of meeting people on my own. I feel like I’m just going to fail and it deeply upsets me. I don’t mind being alone — I’m very introverted, and I’m an only child with working parents so I’m very used to it — but I still yearn for connections with other people. Would I even really be living if I were alone for the next however-many years?",

Happiness isn’t one size fits all; instead, it’s an ever-evolving concept. We’re here to explore the different aspects of happiness and how we can make the most out of our lives.\n\nHappiness has often been defined as “a state of well-being and contentment”, however, this definition does not always suffice when trying to understand its deeper meaning. The idea of true joy goes beyond fleeting moments of pleasure – it requires us to look inwardly at ourselves and identify where we need improvement. By cultivating feelings such as self-love, gratitude, compassion, purposeful living, and mindfulness, we can begin to find balance within ourselves and lead happier lives.\n\nIt takes time and effort to achieve lasting happiness, but there are ways to get started on your journey today!

I have a ton of struggle getting past the casual acquaintances phase and once I’ve done that it’s almost impossible to really get close with people. I’ve realized all my “closest” friends seem to consider me a casual acquaintance, one even said we aren’t close and he thinks sometimes I dislike him. I don’t get invited to hang out with people, I don’t get into new friend groups, I don’t make lasting connections. I’ve never been asked out once. There’s always a group chat I’m not on. It’s almost suffocatingly lonely. This has been going on for years, since I was a little kid. I’ve lost all my old friends and rarely made new ones. \n\nI don’t really know what to do about it. I don’t feel like I’m that weird of a person. I have good hygiene, I have some activities inside and outside of school, I chat with my friends all the time. I’m quiet but not silent. As far as I can tell I’m usually pretty civil and polite to people. Teachers love me, and (as of high school) I’m not openly bullied. I try to ask questions and be interested in people, I always accept invitations (but never get any). I used to initiate or invite people to things although recently I’ve noticed it never works so I kinda gave up. \n\nI don’t know what it is about me that keeps people distant. The only common thread is that when asked about it people frequently say I’m “hard to get to know” or “closed off” or that I don’t emote enough, like I seem unhappy sometimes or maybe broody. I don’t feel this way. I try hard to seem invested in people and I feel like I’m an open book emotionally. It’s like there’s something I’m missing. Maybe physical self awareness of my demeanor? But I don’t know where to start.\n\nExtra info I have ADHD, anxiety, some depression and autism symptoms if that says anything.",

I know she has never liked me as a person although I’ve never hurt her.) \n\nShe is a facebook friend of mine but ever since she badmouthed me, she has been hiding her post and stories from me. \n\nIf she doesn’t want me to see her stuff she should just delete me from her friends list not hide her stuff.\n\nThe weird thing is, her brother watches my stories and I have a feeling she didn’t delete me from her fb friends list because she still wants to “stalk” me or know what I’m up too. (I’m not about to hide my stuff from her too, that’s petty.)\n\nShould I delete her and her brother from my friends list? \nWould it be too harsh to block them?\n\nWhat would you do in this situation?",

I feel like a freak everywhere I go, I just don't fit in, and nobody cares about me. If I disappeared off the face of the earth nobody would notice for weeks and once they did they wouldnt care much, why is it so hard just to get people to care about you?

I sit in all my uni lectures and classes alone, I’ve tried everything in my power to change this but nothing works. I stay up at night feeling invisible to everyone, and it makes me hate university and makes me want to leave and go back home.",

My back story is my teens and early 20s I used to be more outgoing and social and had no problems talking to anyone or making friends.  It wasn’t until I was around 22, 23 when I got extremely depressed because of things that went on with my ex now.  I found it hard to make friends and I was extremely miserable and unapproachable, and also believed that nobody cared about me or liked me.  I went the last 7, 8 years going to shit which caused me to change my mindset and be more resentful.  One thing I forgot to mention was before I hit rock bottom I was always super nice to every, to the point I was a huge pushover, and I had a better sense of humor as well as look approachable.  Now I’m 30 years old, I want to get rid of the mindset where I think people don’t like me, and I want to stop being unapproachable. I hate knowing that there are people who think I don’t like them and I’m tired of always being misunderstood because I have an angry resting bitch face. I want to go back to being the sweet person that I once was, and I want people to know I don’t hate them.  I want to be more likeable to others and I want to show people that I have a sense of humor. I’m tired of being a boring person and I want to be more fun to be around. I know I’m not the funniest person but I want to joke around without people thinking I’m attacking them or I want to joke around and make people laugh.  People always says that I’m judgmental and always worry, I don’t know why maybe it’s the way I talk or say things but I don’t want to be viewed as this.",

Maybe I should stop. I do it as a way of making someone aware of what they’re doing without making it a big confrontation out of it. I do this because my past experience has shown me that the majority of people do not do well with direct confrontation no matter how soft my approach. I don’t have a problem with confrontation in any direction (I wasn’t always like this). So, how do you guys perceive it when someone is passive aggressive?  Do you take the hint?  Does it anger you?  When someone confronts you directly do you take offense?  If you identify someone being passive aggressive, what would you prefer the person did instead?\nThanks for reading.",

        "text": "So 2 days ago, I started my new job, and it was the first time I’ve been around people for…quite some time. I was in self quarantine for nearly 3 years and took the time to really reinvent myself before I wanted to go back out there. \n\nSo I work as a Banquet Server, and I was having fun at my new job and doing great and all, but being liked amongst my co-workers is something I just can’t seem to crack. \n\nI’m a non alcoholic and I don’t mind serving alcohol if it will make the wedding guests happy. After I was pouring champagne for the wedding guests, the bottle ran out, and I went out the door to go get more. There were about 5 of my co workers there vastly of the Hispanic decent, and on my way out, I stopped and told them, “They seem to really like this champagne, I wonder what’s in it?” \n\nAnd one of the guys was like “Try it”, he said it in a very casual voice. (A lot of people at my work are very easy-going).\n\nAnd I gave them this corny response; “Oh I don’t drink alcohol, I only like coffee and tea” and as I walked away, I could hear one of the girls laughing. I looked back at them and I saw them all staring at me with smug grins on their faces. I knew exactly what they were all thinking: “This new girl is so uptight”. \n\nMaybe I’m being a bit too sensitive, but when you embarrass yourself in front of a group of people, especially on your first day when you just wanna play it cool, it kinda bothers me. I couldn’t stop thinking about ways I could have prevented that all day yesterday, like why didn’t I just say “No thanks” Or “There’s no more left?” I’m one of those people who blurt out stupid things because I’m not used to being in social situations, while everyone else around me is, and I’m really insecure about it. I hope some of you can relate to getting laughed at or not fitting in with other people around your age. I will keep this job but from now on, I won’t start any conversations with my co workers because I’m just not cool like that. Also if you guys could tell me should I confront them or just forget about it, that would be nice.  \n\nThanks for reading, peace x",

Again,I was standing in a group of people, my head full of anxious thoughts and not knowing how to react to people. My body language was also terrible again. \n\nIt's just really frustrating that when I felt like I did it I lost my progress. I'm now slowly building that confidence but it's draining.

        "text": "I feel like I’m the only one who doesn’t physically understand how to kiss someone. Lemme explain…\n\nSo like, I know how to kiss a relative or someone like that. Like that kind of in-and-out, one second kiss where you like pucker your lips. But like, how do you physically kiss someone you’re in a relationship with on the lips? Like I see it in movies and stuff and they just put their lips together and look like they’re kinda sucking each others lips. I guess it will be difficult for you guys to explain with words but I’m really at a loss here.\nThere is a (small) chance that I will need this information soon and I don’t wanna look like a fool if it ever happens. And also, I feel like I know how to French kiss with tongues even more than I understand how to do that basic, long-lasting kiss. Like do you like suck on their lips? I really can’t figure it out. I’ve tried googling like ‘How to kiss’ but it always comes up with stuff like ‘Have a mint’ and ‘Set the mood’ and then it just says ‘Kiss’. Like how bro???\n\nTL;DR: How do I actually like physically kiss someone I’m in a relationship with? I’ve never kissed a girl on the lips before in the way that they do in movies. Do I suck her lips? Or just like roll my lips against hers??? 😭",

        "text": "Recently my school break has begun, I (19M) had gotten angry at a close friend of mine for being 'inflexible and inconvenient' to hang out with, I lamented that I was constantly conform to his timetable. He refuted by saying that it wasn't true and that he was genuinely busy. This might not sound related at all, but it all connects soon.\n\nAfter giving it some thought, I realized it really wasn't his fault at all. I've constantly been comparing myself with him and amongst my other peers. Most of whom are either doing something meaningful with their time. (preparing for a triathlon, picking up a new hobby, upgrading themselves and building up their portfolio for university etc.) They all seem to be goal-oriented, and it looks like it paid off, they have a good social life, academic grades and are fit.  \nMeanwhile me on the other hand, I've just been enjoying my holidays playing videogames, going to the gym and also continued learning a new language. I'm aware that 'Comparison is the thief of joy' and that one should only compare themselves with themself, but I still can't help feeling jealous and inadequate. I constantly feel that I'm not at their level or am inferior to them in some way.  \nI think I just bottled all of this up and it eventually came out. I don't think I was being fair to him as all of this was just something in my head that I've built up. Chances are he probably thinks I was being a terrible friend and I feel quite like an ass flaring up on him like that.  \n\n\nTo conclude, I just really don't know how to control and understand my own feelings and don't know how to feel happy for them and their goals while at the same time be satisfied with where I am now or what I'm doing. Why do I constantly feel so poor and how can I stop?",

People generally like me and have good things to say about me to others, but I can’t turn any of those relationships into anything meaningful and I don’t get it. For years I’ve felt like I was missing some skill that other have and use to make friends. I try to do all the things like reach out to people afterwards, ask them questions about themselves, etc. sometimes I can be pretty quiet, but for the most part I’ve grown out of that. \n\nI’ve never had a lot of friends, but for most of my life I had a few very close friends. I either grew apart of had falling outs with all of them. I haven’t really had friends in over 3 years now. I’m not lonely. I have a boyfriend of 2 years and I’m close with my siblings and grandma who I see often. But sometimes I just feel down cause like I don’t even have any friends to invite to a birthday party or anything. My boyfriend is very charming and well liked, sometimes I watch him interact with people and right off the bat he forms a connection and they wanna be his friend.I watch a lot of people interact, that’s probably weird but whatever, and what I’ve noticed is everyone else can do this thing to connect with other. But it’s not something I can actually see or like a script I can learn. \n\nI just feel like I am missing something and I’m wondering if anyone else has felt that way?",

        "text": "So let me explain, because I really need advice. I (F21) have liked a guy from my university class for 2 months now, but the occasions to strike a conversation with him were rare and even when there were some, I have to admit that I was too shy to randomly go up to him. I did do it a few times and interacted with him, only shortly, but at least he knows I exist and he has been friendly with me. \n\nSadly the semester is now coming to an end, and I have heard from some other people, that this guy might not continue the studies next semester. And this made me really disappointed, firstly in myself because I feel like I could have done more to get closer to him, but also because now I won‘t be sure if I ever see him again, and if I do it will only be in two months after spring break.\n\nSo I have been debating on using my last chance, which is texting him. The thing is, I am a shy girl with very little confidence and I don‘t know if I have what it takes to confidently lead a conversation, and I don‘t know even less how I am supposed to make my romantic intentions known haha. I guess that I‘m also scared of coming off weird and pushy. Yes it is a lot of overthinking and for this reason I am wondering if I should just abandon. But at the same time I‘m sick of just living my life in fear and letting every opportunity pass by.\nAny wise words would be appreciated :‘)",
