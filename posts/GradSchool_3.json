I’m still waiting on couple other schools but I feel really grateful to have the privilege of getting choose where I’d like to go. Among the three listed schools, which one would you say offers the best value for your my money? I’m convinced independently of wherever I end up going, all these schools will provide me with similar and strong academic experience. The main aspects I’m, therefore looking at right now to make an ultimate decision is the social life of graduate student at those schools, as well as opportunities during the program and after graduation. Those are two aspects I neglected during college apps (I prioritized academic and reputation) and I do not want to repeat this mistake as I feel quite miserable in my college. \n\nI am mostly leaning towards UMich at the moment. They offered me less money than Rice but the fact it is a big research university means I might find better opportunities to strive professionally, academically, and socially. Also I’ve heard only good things about Ann Arbor so far. Your input is greatly appreciated.",

I have a very specific mindset that I am not here to socialize or have fun (some may disagree but that's not the point of this post) but when like 8 people from my lab *and* other lab go out somewhere and I m completely left out of it, it does leave a bad taste. I will be graduating this December, get a job hopefully and leave my current state, so I try to shrug this feeling off but it has been more difficult recently. I talked with a Venezuelan friend who defended a while ago, and they had the same issue except the other way around. It sucks. \n\nHow do you deal with this unintended alienation?

So, which grad schools can you suggest that might have more of a focus on contemporary “world” (a contentious term, I know) literatures, particularly where these interact with postcolonialism, trauma, memory, and related themes.

I know of a few people in their 5th year who are doing it but I don’t really know them too well. I was just wondering if anybody else had done it or if they would recommend against it?

I specify Europe in my question because I'm not sure about how much requirements change from country to country, but in my university they didn't ask for a minimum GPA in order to apply for a master degree. The second master I'm interested in applying to is a joint program between Germany and Poland, and free of charge, what makes me think that it will be more difficult to get accepted that if I had to pay. They don't ask for a specific minimum GPA in particular, but they do ask for \"academic excellence\", which I'm afraid I don't have. However, I know about people with lower grades who got accepted into programs asking for a good academic background because they had work or research experience, another degree, papers, etc. I've also completed one paid internship and I'm currently doing another one, both of them are directly related to my bachelor, although not that directly related to this second master. Could this be enough to make up for my mediocre GPA? Do you have some advice about how could I improve my chances to be selected? Thanks!",

However, their deadline to place a deposit is March 24. While this is one of my top schools it is also further away from family so I was hoping to wait to hear from the other programs. Unfortunately the rest of them won’t get back to me till about April.\n\nWould it look bad if I were to place a deposit for the March 24th school then potentially withdraw if I were to choose admission at another program? I know that I’d forfeit the money which I am okay with, I’m just scared of cutting ties or ruining any relationships with the first school.\n\nWould appreciate any advice!! TIA!",

For my first year I was working close to full time on top of being a TA and taking a full course load. In the summer I got an opportunity that seemed really great, 20 hours a week doing some data management and stats work which would help me improve some of my research skills and would alleviate my work load. I would also be working for someone who themselves had a Ph.D. and was hiring me with the understanding that I’m in grad school (not the case with my previous job). So I took the job in July and it’s honestly been a mess. I constantly feel like I’m not living up to my bosses expectations. She oversees two other full time staff and she seems to expect the same output from me. She’s also not clear with expectations so I often feel blindsided when she’s upset with me because I didn’t complete a task the way she wanted, even though I thought I was doing it well. I know I haven’t been the best employee, my mind is constantly preoccupied with school and I worry she’s getting a bad impression of me and my work ethic. At the same time I feel more stressed working 20 hours a week than I did working 35+ at my old job and it still doesn’t feel like enough. I’m more burned out than I was last year and I don’t know how to communicate that I want this job but grad school is my main priority. Any advice or sympathy would be helpful. We had a misunderstanding today about whether I was working from home or the office (I had stayed home because I thought that was the plan) and I’m just so exhausted by all of the miscommunication and by constantly disappointing my boss.",

Define your success and be surrounded by those who **celebrate** you. I've learned that just because a research area with a great prof may not align with my direct interests, their determination to see me exceed and good intentions makes me even more excited and motivated to explore a new research area.

        "text": "Hi all, I'm a 4th year PhD in EE in a huge conundrum about whether I'm cut out for research or want to stay in the PhD. I thought I would really enjoy a research career, and for the first 2.5-3 years or so I was enjoying my program despite how difficult it is.\n\nThing is, around this time my main research project turned out to be a total dud. It was a cool idea that, if it worked, would have easily been my dissertation and I would sail off into the sunset. Problem is that the physics just don't work, which took us a while to figure out why. Unfortunately very little can be salvaged from this work that is novel and publishable, so I had to start figuring out WTF I was going to do for my PhD.\n\nMy advisor is hands-off to the point of non-existence. This project was his brainchild and he desperately wanted it to work, and now that I told him I don't think it's worth working on anymore I haven't really gotten any feedback from him - almost nothing about new projects, new funding, new ideas/avenues I could explore. Around this time I started thinking, well, a PhD is supposed to be all about independent inquiry, right? So I started randomly reading articles I thought were interesting to try and think of a whole new project. I stumbled on something that turned out to be a dead-end... and now I'm just totally spinning free with no clue what to do.\n\nIt honestly feels like I'm at a point where I'm being dropped into the lab and told, \"Go write a dissertation. Here's no guidance or support on what is important or relevant in the field. Also we have no sponsor funding any of this work. Good luck!\" The thing is, I don't think most of my peers in engineering are in this kind of scenario - the field is sufficiently complex that it feels ridiculous that someone with 1-2 years of experience could devise a thesis-worthy project entirely on their own. Most of them seem to be working on projects that their professor won funding for, whether it be from the DoD, NSF, what have you, and they chip away at it for 4-5 years and get their PhD at the end. This is honestly what I was expecting also.\n\nIs this an unrealistic expectation? I mean, I know a PhD is supposed to be a very independent endeavor, but I always thought that was more along the lines of independently pursuing a research project that your supervisor crafted with you, guiding you towards relevant questions that have the potential to yield some sort of results. Independent in the sense that, you may not have entirely devised the idea from scratch, but you run the project, decide what to do next, what knobs to turn, etc.\n\nAm I supposed to be the originator of an entire thesis-worthy research idea, from beginning to end, all my idea and inspiration with no guidance to go off of? Do most students create their whole research plan alone and I'm just the one who can't hack it? Has something gone horribly wrong?\n\nBecause if it is supposed to be this independent, I have no issues admitting it's not for me. But if it isn't, then I clearly need to make a change.",

I am not sure what my future career holds, but I would like do something that would pair nicely with my journalism/comms background and give me the best financial opportunities in an impoverished area. \n\nWhen I left my job, I thought that public administration would be perfect, as I found a love and appreciate for the public sector and my community. In researching, I see the same university’s leadership program requires 6 hours less of study and might be a quicker way to get my degree. (How?) \n\nThe two degrees seem to be very similar. It looks like a lot of universities have these two masters under the same umbrella,  but these are separated into the colleges of liberal arts and education/professional development. \n\nSince I am working full time, I also would ideally like to take a max of two classes a semester.

I started work in an environmental grad program this past fall, and despite having a cohort that is kind and having ample opportunities to succeed, I can't help but hate it all. I have social anxiety that makes it difficult to connect and feel community with my cohort (10 people), and am missing the day-to-day life in my respective field outside of grad school (mostly outdoor, physical work). The main reason that I decided to to to grad school was to learn more about my professional field, gain the skills/knowledge I need to succeed in said field, and to be able to obtain a position that requires a graduate degree. I have hit a large wall this quarter, and have spiraled into a depression that has pushed me to the point that I just hate everything about it. I know that if I stop, I will be letting myself down, and will be limiting my ability to get my dream career later on down the road, but I don't know how to climb out of this hole of hating graduate school. For reference, I have always enjoyed school/academia life, but this time it feels different. I dislike my classes, the pressure that my professors put on me to excel, and feeling like I am incompetent in completing my thesis and coursework.\n\nI want to be able to do my best, and get the most out of my time here; do any of you have advice as to what I can do to make this experience more enjoyable?",

        "text": "After TWELVE years of fooling around and not applying, I finally applied for a PhD program. I've been dreaming of grad school since being a freshman undergrad and it was always a thing i thought i would do.\n\ni only applied to one program. one application. sometimes i'm wondering if i did it just so i could say i did and not because i want to get in.\n\ni have a stable full time job i don't plan on leaving (i assume i would bring it down to PT), a chill partner and kiddo, a wonderful support system, i own my house, and i want the DMA so i can have the focused time to write the musical I've halfway written so i can stop doing it on my free time. i'm applying to school in the hometown i live at, applied late dec, have not heard back. \n\ni mean, it's music composition DMA, it's a tiny field, and i've seen at least one acceptance go out.\n\ni don't know if the wait is this disheartening for everyone (omg HOW DO YOU SURVIVE?|!) or if the wait has disheartened me to the point i'm not even sure it's worth doing this anymore (long time commitment, having to maybe leave this jobi love for good, wondering if i can juggle this much, wondering if ic an handle the stress, etc).\n\nhelp. i don't even know what i'm looking for. i just want that damn response. idc if i get in or not i just want to know.",

        "text": "Just tired of this. Literally no time to just enjoy existing, endless work for no pay, classes and more classes and I’m just tired of it. No one lower class could even make this work, having a part time online job with another job I can pickup shifts if I want to is the only reason I can even do this. My stepdad pays tuition and let’s me live with him or it wouldn’t be possible at all. \n\nI’m just over it. They need to make school something you can freaking live during. I’m so privileged and I’m still struggling, it’s bull crap because lower class persons couldn’t even have this dreadful experience to try to get a better life.  I have no money and can barely work bc of the course load, and I’m just tired of the never ending cycle. I really am. I’d like to be a goddamn full adult now with my career and salary. Im exhausted mentally :( \n\nIt’s a freaking scam how they build the programs and costs for them. This whole thing is crap. To anyone not as privileged as me, I am impressed with your resolve.  And I’m in clinical mental health, this isn’t even close to what math program students go through! How can I stay mentally positive for clients like this like? This is bull. Others in my program are also burning out. Why make this impossible 😭😭😭😭  tonight I start an 8 week 5 hour once a week class and I’m pissed about it. Sick of this crap. ok rant over",

I first got into Marketing because of the beautiful combination of \"the art\" and analytics. But, I can see my job going away in about 5-10 years.\n\nI've always loved economics aka the study of making decisions. So, I'm wondering, is it worth getting a Master's degree in the Behavioral Science/Economic field (which I don't see technology taking away from people and possibly pairing... profitably with marketing)  in order to get a leg up on this shift?\n\nAnything helps, thanks!",
