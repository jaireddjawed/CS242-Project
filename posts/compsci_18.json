Traversing a tree in the order required by the implementation can give us a sorted list then. Why can't we use this algorithm of using red black trees and patent it as another sorting algorithm? The treemap collection is available in java if anyone is not familiar with the same.\n\n​\n\nIt will sort the list in lesser time in worst cases as well than traditional sorting algorithms perhaps? Need feedback and your thoughts on this.\n\n​\n\nEdit: I came to know that this is Tree Sort that runs in O(nlogn) time{worst case of O(n\\^2)} and came to know about it only after writing above post :|",

I have the option of doing either HCI (human computer interaction) or a course on Program Analysis.\n\nThe HCI is almost entirely a large group-project where you work with some sort of human-computer interface. Essentially, the main themes for this course are how humans with physical and information environments, and how to design software with human's information needs and their cognitive capacities in mind. The issue I have with this is that I'm also taking another project based course, and Operating Systems, so I'm not sure if I could handle multiple projects in one term.\n\nThe program analysis course sounds cool (and theres no project) but I'm a bit intimidated of it since its a senior level. The course is supposed to give us an overview of the program analyses that work and those that do not work in practice and how to design program analyses for modern software systems (e.g., Android). Stuff like intermediate representations, interprocedural and intra-procedural analysis techniques, call graphs, pointer analysis, and analysis frameworks will be taught (though I'm not sure what any of that means).\n\n​if you have done one of these courses (or both), did they help you in the workforce at all? \n\nThanks!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

But there is surely no way you can take those optimal weights and thresholds and learn what it is that is causing the cancer for example? It seems you have a black box capable of answering a question without giving you any further understanding of the problem in way that more 'traditional' approaches do. Is machine learning as opaque as I am suggesting or are there techniques for using machine learning to further understand a problem rather than just arrive at a black-box that spits out an answer?",

        "text": "I'm trying to build my programming skills (I have some background skills) and general computer understanding as I go into my PhD in Biomedical engineering. My thesis project is building a computational brain map, so it is mostly (80%) programming. I get to take a good number of grad-level CS courses.\n\nFor some background, I did an undergraduate degree in math and a masters in Electrical engineering. Relevant undergrad CS courses I took were OOP (Java), Data structures &amp; algorithms (java+ python), and scientific computing in C++ (grad level).\n\nI have the choice of taking an OS course or a Computer Networks course. The OS course is very difficult, but I feel like it could fill in a lot of the gaps in my CS education so far (rigor, debugging, software engineering). The Computer networks course looks pretty interesting and I would build an HTTP server in Java.\n\nWhich course do you guys think would help me sharpen my skill in computer science?",

I've implemented it into python and it works. However, I was not sure HOW this worked. I understood all of the algorithm except for the decision parameter. Specifically why it has to be  d = 3 – (2 \\* r) ,   d = d + (4\\*x) + 6,  d = d + 4 \\* (x – y) + 10. Is anyone familiar with the algorithm or understands the math behind how these were derived?",
