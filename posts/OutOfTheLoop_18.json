        "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nFor years, I followed along with the news on 3D printing. I'd watch videos and read articles about the new machines coming out each year, and their pros and cons. However, I fell out of the loop for a few years, and it seems like the industry has really been [chugging along and advancing this whole time.](https://all3dp.com/1/best-3d-printer-reviews-top-3d-printers-home-3-d-printer-3d/)\n\nMy main questions are thus:\n\n1. I know that you can buy machines for as low as $100 now, and that there's lots of DIY models, too. But I'm not looking for that. Which brands are known for being the best? Which ones put out consistently-good machines that are reliable, well-made, and which put out good quality prints? I'm not wanting the \"Apple\" or the \"Tesla\" of 3D printing, where they're more known for beauty and features and fluff. I want the Honda Accord of 3D printing. ***TRUE*** quality.\n2. What is the price of entry for a reliable machine? When I last checked, it was around the $2500-$3500 mark for something you could have printing around the clock, to make sellable parts. Has that come down to below $1000 now?\n3. Which are the best and most trusted brands of filaments? (And best places to buy them from?)\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated, thank you!",

At the same time they praise Stalin, Putin, Communism (and socialism in other posts I don't have problems with) in general. It is obvious to me it's propaganda, mistranslated videos, disinformation in general but why are so many left leaning subs pro communism and anti-EU / anti-Nato lately??? Have they been infiltrated or are there greater forces at play that want to make them look bad? This has been especially apparent since the invasion but it's getting progressively worse and I can only imagine what the sentiment will be in those subs mere months from now.",

What I’ve figured out so far is that Favre was somehow involved in the Mississippi state government in giving our welfare funds but they somehow decided to use it to build a stadium for the college that his daughter goes to? And then the Mississippi state government is suing Favre for using funds irresponsibly?\n\nI don’t get this at all. How did they end up giving welfare funds to Favre? What were the funds meant to be spent on? How was Favre allowed to just spend the money without the government approving what it was going towards?
