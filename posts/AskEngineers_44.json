An article I read said that you can tell the difference between the two because some bronze objects tend to have \"feint rings\" around them. Sure enough, this unit does, as you'll see in the high-resolution picture from Wikipedia. However, I do not see how that is a good metric for distinction mainly because when simply Googling \"rings around bronze\" and alike, I get absolutely nothing. Is someone here able to point me in the right direction and also explain the feint rings on the surface? I am assuming such was done for added strength to prevent crushing as the specs say the tube is ~0.5mm thick.\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SBM-20_Geiger-M%C3%BCller_Tubes.jpg\n\nIf anyone knows of a non-invasive and destructive procedure for telling the two materials apart I would also love to know!",

Initially i would have motor A connected to the left wheel and motor B on the right, but with this the wheels would turn at slightly different speeds and i need it to go straight. So i want to have both motors connected together, and then turn both wheels together. I have access to normal spur gears and pulleys, but no bevel gears etc. My idea is to have both linked with a pulley, then use that with two separate outputs and connect that to the wheels via a series of couplings. Only problem is this would make the wherls turn opposite ways, so id need an extra gear on one side. Is there a better way to do this? (in terns of symmetry and keeping part number to a minimum) Thanks!",

Thoughts like this culminated in popsci movies like \"I, Robot\".\n\nYet some time after that, it lost all it's hype and we don't hear much about robots nowadays(except Boston Dynamics) and our waiters, garbage collectors, nurses, plumbers or electricians are nowhere to go, soldiers don't wear exoskeletons or fight side-by-side with android combat robots either.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/yxvynh/too_late_into_my_degree_to_switch_want_to_break/",
        "text": "Hi, thank you for taking the time out to read this. I'm panicking immensely and I just want any and all guidance I can possibly get. \n\nTo begin, I want to introduce myself a bit. I began my undergraduate degree in a general Life Sciences degree because everyone in my life really wanted me to pursue Medicine and I hadn't really had any career aspirations of my own apart from claiming I wanted to do medicine when I was, like, 7, so I assumed I might really grow to love it and gave in. Never thought to consider Engineering because everyone I asked told me they didn't think it was the right fit for me because I always told them I worried I wouldn't be able to handle more Physics, despite my stellar AP Calculus and AP Physics scores, compared to my just decent AP Bio and AP Chem scores. The people in my circle also just thought medicine was better societally for me.\n\nFast forward to being in my first and second year of a Life Sciences degree, crying all the time, so deeply miserable and unhappy. I didn't tell a single soul and applied to transfer to Engineering. Got in, told my family and friends and they weren't really supportive (not a career for me, I might not be smart enough, etc.) but it was the first time I'd felt genuine joy and really believed I could do it. \n\nSo, then I went into a gateway engineering program where the first year was nearly unified between all engineering streams, because I wasn't sure which engineering I wanted to do. I was so deeply indecisive, especially between Mech and Civil, but ended up choosing Civil because job stability (research said it was one of the most stable careers and in demand), so diverse (figured I'd love one of the many substreams), and the program is ranked extremely highly (top 100 in the world, I think top 3 in my country) compared to my school's mech program. So, despite the fact that I loved cars and enjoyed my tech classes in high school, and my more Mech-inclined first year courses, I went into civil. \n\nI could've switched into Mechanical a year into Civil if I'd wanted but I was worried because I would've had to redo a lot of courses from the year and I just did not want to be in my undergraduate degree for that long especially as I am taking on loans and am paying it through myself. I told myself, and had read people got into co-ops from different streams and it wasn't uncommon, so I went along. I tried really hard and my grades in engineering were better than my pre-med grades. Regardless, this still wasn't enough for the camp of people that still wanted me to pursue medicine but I kept going because I was finally doing something for myself. I know people will tell me that this is growing pains and I need to stop taking their opinions to heart but it really hurts to be made to feel like a disappointment because I didn't fulfill their fantasies of what they wanted me to be. \n\nI got my first engineering co-op at my university in a mechanical/electrical engineering position and I've worked here for almost 2 years. It's not exactly the type of mechanical work I want to do but I still enjoyed it SO MUCH more than all my coursework. I tried every subject in Civil that was offered as well as researching other careers in Civil in case I was being narrow-minded, but I didn't find any that I liked nearly enough to pursue a career in. I even interviewed for a Civil firm for a summer (an hour away) and got an offer but I didn't want to give my Mech job up so I turned them down. \n\nIn March of this year, I grew tired of the constant comments of how I wasn't serious about pursuing medicine and I have disappointed a lot of people. This led me to do poorly in some core courses in my degree. I passed them but not with good grades. \n\nThis launched me into a depressive spiral because I figured that if I disliked Civil, I could have gotten into a Masters program, specifically an Automotive Engineering one because everyone I talked to said last two years are heavily considered in Masters applications. As a result, I switched to trying to just focus on breaking into the Automotive industry in an entry-level Engineering position, sharpening up some skills, fixing up my resume etc.. I worked on reaching out to industry professionals on LinkedIn and some even responded but a few discouraged me from applying to certain positions because of the degree I am anticipating to receive in April, especially what I consider to be my dream position. \n\nThat leads me to today, being more than halfway into my second-last semester of Civil Engineering, feeling extremely worried. Civil is a great discipline with so many bright individuals, and I truly do not belong here. So many people in my class are so brilliant, so passionate. Some of the best future Civil Engineers in the making, without a doubt. I do not deserve to be alongside them because I cannot imagine doing this for the rest of my life, while they're so passionate about it. Some of my professors are so deeply brilliant and are just incredible educators. I am so grateful the faculty accepted me, so grateful. \n\nI don't know what to do. How do I break into the industry I think I could genuinely be happy in? \n\nMy GPA is lower than the required one at any decent university for a Masters in Data Analytics (I also love Math &amp; Stats, not great at coding but am interested in a Data Analytics scope), Tron, or Automotive Engineering. \n\nI am worried that no Automotive company will take me, because even though I am an incredibly diverse candidate and they promote diversity, I might be too diverse and not skilled enough and I don't know how to gain these skills apart from coding. \n\nAnd, I don't think I can get into a Masters with my GPA (can message what it is if asked but I'm too embarrassed to say it but it's .2/.3 lower than the minimum required GPA for a majority of programs). I still want to try but I don't know how good the odds will be. \n\nAnd, I can't switch into Mech, Tron etc. bachelor's degree now, it would mean taking on more loans and more time taken. \n\nPlease help. I would appreciate any advice. While I have not worked in a Civil Engineering firm, I have gone to many and done a lot of shadowing to ensure I'm not just being reactionary. My family are not any help because they do not respect my desire to be in Engineering at all and think the switch ruined my chances at a career in Medicine. I would love to help people but I am not equipped to be a Medical professional, not at this point in my life. \n\nSorry if this was hard to read or too panicky or not professional. I'm just really worried and don't know what to do. \n\nI also know believing working with something you like is not enough for happiness because at the end of the day it's just a job, but I really want to try. Please. Also, sorry for any humble brags about the AP scores or the ranking of the program, I just wanted to frame my position as accurately as possible and being grateful for everything but still being worried. \n\nTL;DR: Chose Civil instead of Mech but now really want a career in the Automotive Industry. Family don't respect the desire to be an Engineer at all, compared to Doctor.",

        "text": "I currently work as an electrical engineer at a research lab and I have for about 10 years. It's very cool job and I have a variety of things I do. In a given year, I could be:\n\n- Designing analog circuits, working with ASIC designers to hunt down the source of 1/f noise, modelling things like that\n\n- Designing PCBs, picking components, laying out the PCBs, getting it assembled, bringing it up, etc...\n\n- Doing FPGA development, writing HDL, reading out ADC data and dealing with timing issues, working with Ethernet or JESD blocks\n\n- Developing cryogenic systems and test stands, working with physicists to design experiments and readout different types of sensors, like SPADs. Doing parameter analysis with CV curves and 4 wire probing. Doing 3D and mechanical design for fixtures to 3D print or bump bond these tiny things.\n\n- Software development, whether Linux on FPGAs, or making automated tests in Python or making GUIs that will interact with all my firmware in the FPGA. Working in big groups, using Git and Docker and so on.\n\n- Signal processing, DSP, FFTs and things like that\n\n- Manual and automated testing of oscilloscopes, arbitrary waveform generators, power supplies, characterizing ADCs, that sort of thing\n\n- Traveling to present and install our stuff at other places\n\n- Some light management, managed a project subsystem in the single millions range, dealt with vendors and suppliers\n\nIt's a quite cool, very varied job. I kind of have always just filled the cracks. A project will require someone to do X, and I'll go back and read textbooks and do tutorials about X and quickly become an expert at it. That's really fun for me. I'm just a little tired of the relatively low pay and semi-academic environment.\n\nIn this job environment, everyone online says to find a new job, so I'm curious and I've been applying. One kind of problem is that I really don't have a specific idea of what I like to do. Making VR headsets sounds cool. So does doing High Frequency Trading with FPGAs. Or maybe working on something like the Ring as a consumer device. I wouldn't say no to rockets. East coast, west coast, it doesn't matter to me. Making the move to software engineering to get in that high paying cohort? Or management to try to rise up in an organization? All these seem like fun adventures. There's cool stuff happening everywhere and I don't have a specific thing pulling me like \"My cause in life is to make electric cars a reality and that's all I want to do\".\n\nSo admittedly, I do aim high and make sure that a role has a \"cool\" factor when I apply. I've gotten to the 2nd or 3rd level interview at Meta for designing VR helmets, FPGA work at a HFT firm in Chicago, PCB design at Amazon's Blue Origin, sensor work at Apple, systems integration at Rivian. I think my resume is on point and it gets me these interviews. Unfortunately I've never actually gotten an offer since I've been looking in the last year or two.\n\nMy gut feeling is that I'm not coming across well enough at the stage where I'm doing the technical assessment. Based on what the posting is for, I do a deep dive refresher into the specific topic for the week leading up to it. I have done a lot of practice in not getting flustered and nervous, and remaining calm in an interview situation. But my fear is that I'm not doing well enough at these stages. I do all the things I know you're supposed to do - I think out loud and talk about my reasoning process. I bring in all the auxilliary knowledge I know about the problem. But in my head what I'm really thinking is \"Oh, this question came out of left field and wasn't in what I studied. If you just gave me a bit of time to research this, I'd have the task done, and I'd be able to explain it simply to upper management.\" In my mind I'm pretty confident that if I got these jobs, it would take a couple of weekends of me catching up, but soon enough I'd be just as good a performer as anyone they've got.\n\nHow can a more \"generalist\" engineer like me approach these interviews? Should I just focus on one specific section of engineering like FPGAs and just be doing work for that in my spare time, and only apply to jobs like that and just be in that headspace so it seems like second nature to me? Or is it just that I'm applying to highly competitive positions? Or is it just a numbers game and I need to keep at it and sooner or later there will be a sympathetic hiring manager?\n\nI tried having a session with a career coach, but I didn't find it helpful.
