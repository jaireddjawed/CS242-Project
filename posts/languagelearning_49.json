Almost like I need subtitles in real life. \n\nFor example, if I listen to a song I can pick up some of the words but I won’t know the entire sentence until looking at the lyrics, and I’ll have been missing words I know that I’ve learned and can translate immediately, but for some reason I didn’t process them correctly in an auditory setting. \n\nMaybe I’m overthinking it, but I’m wondering if this is normal? I’ve been studying at least 1 hour a day for 3 months now, a language that Ive been exposed to since I was a child but never fully learned, and yet I still feel a substantial lag when hearing the language being spoken. The lag is there for the whole process of actually processing what words were said, translating them in my head, then trying to think of a response, and then translating that in my head back to them. \n\nPerhaps I just need to continue to up the repetition and get more experience with conversational speech instead of the current methods of studying (music, tv shows, Pimsleur) where there isn’t a lot of feedback. \n\nI apologize if the answer is right in front of me and I’m not seeing it. \n\nHowever, I don’t have anyone to speak the language to where I live. There’s no one around me that I can reliably go to to practice.",

Although I don't have evidence to draw this conclusion from, I do believe that it makes sense that you'd have fewer issues with people automatically switching to English when they know you're a language learner in countries with a lower proficiency index. \n\nObviously this is going to be more useful for people who are learning languages that are spoken in multiple countries, though it still could be valuable.\n\nThis is not to be used, however, as a way to rank one country over another in terms of value and should not be used to perpettrate any racism or stereotypes.

I plan on moving to Norway in the near future and fully plan on doing immersion learning but I want to gain a decent level of proficiency before then.

        "text": "So I'm wondering what people's longer term plans are for the languages they are learning.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I am not saying that your career is the only reason to learn languages. Nor am I saying there is anything wrong with learning languages as a pure hobby or interest. I also learn languages for pure interest and this is in fact the reason I'm asking this!\n\nFirstly, when I say career, it could be that you just want to move to a country that speaks the languages you are learning. That is sufficient a reason to learn a language for career purpose. But it could be more than this. Maybe you want to use different languages everyday career or maybe you want to be a translator. \n\nMy problem is this. I tend to dislike learning things under pressure. For a long time it was precisely because I'm not learning languages for my career that I enjoy learning it so much. If I was under pressure to learn languages because I need to, I'm not sure I would enjoy them. Also learning languages to just speak to friends, make more friends, or travel is one thing. Using a language for work requires another level of fluency, and more importantly, confidence. Like could you imagine using one of your learnt languages to write a job application and communicate to a manager on a daily basis? Currently I can't imagine this. Wondering if anyone else has this dilemma?",

We also peel an apple. And we use Skin as a verb sometimes just like Peel.  So maybe we are just saying “piel” and we never realized. Am i just focusing too much on this or am i on to something?  Is there a word for Peel in Spanish? I think it is just “skin”. The same usage.  Right?    Did english create a new word “skin”?  Why is our skin our skin but also our Peel. .

I'm considering just translating words /concepts that I don't know, memorise it and then write it to them myself. I know talking with/being around native speakers is one of the best ways to learn but I'm not sure if its too soon, but I want to see if there are ways I can struggle through communication and learn through there",

I already have certificates from my unviersity confiming my english level as C1, but weirdly enough those are not accepted.\n\nAfter some research, I almost did the Linguaskill test for 160€ but as it is an online exam anyway, I could potentially take it at a language center in Bangladesh or similar...? I searched the web for a few cheaper test centres and the lowest I've found is from the Baltic Council at 120€. LinkedIn proposed \"  Worldwide English Services, Inc.\" but I could not find any way to actually register for the exam on their website.\n\nCan anyone help me out with finding the cheapest way of doing a Linguaskill test? I mean it's essentially the same test, just offered via a different agent, so there is no point in paying a premium just for the location of said agent.\n\nMany thanks!!!",

        "text": " \n\nFor  3+ years, I have been studying, learning new stuff, and improving everything as much as possible, e.g. grammar, pronunciation,  comprehension, vocabulary, etc. Nonetheless, two days ago while I was reading my hand-made vocabulary (which incorporates idioms, phrasal verbs, and so on, not only words), literally everything was rushing in my head. I couldn't remember the most fundamental words or their  synonyms. I felt that everything I knew was...diminishing. I have been always afraid to make a mistake, whether the mistake is grammar,  spelling, and the list goes on. Mistakes are supposed to be put down to experience, yeah, but you don't have a clue how frustrating it is to sound inarticulately to a native speaker, just because your thoughts are not sequent, you wonder if that word is appropriate to use for this occasion or not, and you try your best to use the most unique, rare, or hard words because the underlying vocabulary doesn't satisfy you anymore...Besides, reading books, watching movies, and listening to music/news don't master a second language for you, nor talking to a  native speaker does, because...well... you don't have any around yourself, on your Friends list on FB, Instagram and yeah.\n\nGrammarly also contributed to my breakdown. It is installed on my browser to help me, but lately, it has not been much of a help. I don't claim to know  English perfectly or better than anyone else, sometimes it is me who makes stupid mistakes. Still, Grammarly with its yellow color, indicating something wrong, made me obsessed with checking everything to the last letter, and guess what: There is ALWAYS something wrong! How could be either??! Into the bargain, watching these YouTube videos of some ''teachers'' or whatever they are, headlined ''How I got fluent just in 5 days/ Do this and you will be fluent in no time'' drives me up to the wall. Most of them say absolutely NOTHING useful in the video,  yet I know they are better than me and have polished their English enough, while I am still struggling.\n\nLet's infer this tirade with nothing, but hope that if I laid back a bit and concede the fact I will never be a native speaker and cut that overthinking for good, perhaps everything will come together eventually,  and I will be happy that I have made it that far with a second language.\n\n0 comments",

        "text": "After comparing prices and reviews from a few schools in Central America, I eventually decided on [this school](https://www.spanishacademyantiguena.com) in Antigua, Guatemala. Here's a quick summary: \n\n\n#COST\n\nI did 5 hours of one-on-one classes each day M-F, and also lived with a local family. The home stay included a private room and bathroom as well as 3 meals a day, 6 days a week. They also picked me up from the airport. \n\nThe total cost for this was under $1,200. \n\n#THE CITY\n\nI've traveled fairly extensively, and Antigua is definitely one of my favorite cities so far. The views of the mountains and volcanoes are gorgeous, the locals are super friendly, there's a large foreigner crowd which creates a fun nightlife, and it's cheap if you stay out of the touristy spots. \n\nIt's also quite safe. I didn't hear about anyone being robbed or mugged, but one girl did have her bag stolen from a bar while she danced. You're unlikely to have any issues if you don't leave things laying around. \n\n#PROGRESS \n\nWhen I got to Antigua I knew around 100 words and the alphabet. I could also only speak in present tense. \n\nWe spoke Spanish nearly 100% of the time in class, starting off with very basic conversations and gradually getting more complex as I learned. We also spent a ton of time on grammar. \n\nThe family spoke some English, but during our meals the other students and I  tried to avoid English as much as possible. \n\nI'm now pretty confident in saying I'm around A2. I can have quite fluid conversations about familiar topics, but still have to pause and think about certain conjugations and other grammatical stuff. My vocabulary is also smaller than I'd like, which makes reading a pain in the ass as I constantly have to translate a ton of new words and idioms. It also makes unfamiliar topics impossible to discuss without asking a million questions. \n\nA2 isn't amazing obviously, but it was a reasonable goal to set given the time period and I'm pretty happy with my progress. I think B1 is realistic for me  after another 2-4 weeks of classes, which I may do in Cartagena in late January. \n\nIn the meantime, my goals are to start watching SpongeBob and other shows in Spanish and finish some easy books.\n\nThanks for reading, have a good one!",

I’m still somewhere between A0 and A1, although not close to being A1 so I’m having a hard time remembering characters. I then thought about making example sentences as I don’t use them for German. The problem is, I don’t really know where to get them from and it’s hard to take them from content when you understand 10% or less of the language. \n\nI then had the idea of asking ChatGDP to write a simple sentence using the word 今天 in Chinese. It replied: 今天是个好天气, and the pinyin (jintian shi ge hao tianqi) with tone markers. I can now copy and paste the sentence and pinyin. For those who haven’t created flash cards in a language that uses another writing system, it’s super tedious. You first write in your native language, then switch to the other keyboard, and for mandarin it’s even worse because if you want the pinyin without confusing numbers it’s a third keyboard.\n\nThat, plus the incredible short stories it can create if you prompt it to do so. Some people said it isn’t always right, but the ones who say that need to remember that this is just the start of the AI era and that they’re only going to get better. Our creativity with this tool is now our only limit. \n\nThat’s all for my post, have an amazing day and don’t procrastinate your flash cards ;)",

        "text": "I learned english a couple of years ago (my birth language is spanish), so i tend to think in both languages depending on the situation.\n\nThere's even times when i don't know a word (of some object or description of something) in spanish but i know it in english, and the other way around.\n\nBut the weirdest thing I've done ( and keep doing) is to write a note on my phone of something i need to remember or whatever in spanish and out of nowhere i start writing in english, or the other way around. But i don't notice that until i go back and read everything from start to finish. There's sometimes i just start thinking in english and then in spanish, is very weird.\n\nSo have you guys had experiences like that? Im just bilingual (im trying to learn a 3rd language, specially korean), i can't imagine what can happen with people that knows more than 2 languages haha",
