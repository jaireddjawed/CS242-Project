        "text": "Hello space reddit, I need your help correcting a potentially fake childhood memory I have about having seen Halley's comet.\n\nI was born in 1992 so I couldn't have possibly seen it... right?\n\nI remember being fairly little, somewhere between age 7 and 10 (somewhere around the year 2000?), and my father (an amateur astronomer) getting very excited about a comet passing by (we lived on the Northern hemisphere, GMT+1). He'd tell me the story of Halley's comet, and I probably misunderstood what he was saying and thought that I was actually looking at Halley's comet. We spent around an hour looking at a comet with a not very high quality home telescope, but I remember him saying it was almost visible by the naked eye too.\n\nHelp me, was there a Halley-related event that I might be remembering? Was there another noteworthy comet passing us by sometime around 1998-2000?\n\nNot sure if this is enough info to go on, but I trust yall! Thanks so much for the help, ask away if I can provide any more information.",

        "text": "Hey guys, I know the title sounds crazy, but hear me out. \n\nAfter doing some research and thinking about this for a while, I think it's possible that we're all living inside a black hole.  \nFirst of all, let's talk about what a black hole is. It's a region of space with an extremely strong gravitational pull, so strong that not even light can escape it. The center of a black hole is called the singularity, and it's a point of infinite density and zero volume. Anything that gets too close to a black hole is pulled in and becomes part of the singularity.  \nNow, let's consider our universe. We know that it's expanding, but what's it expanding into? Some scientists have proposed that our universe is like a bubble in a larger multiverse, or that it's infinite and goes on forever. But what if the reason we can't see beyond our universe is because we're actually inside a black hole?  \nThink about it - the singularity at the center of a black hole is a point of zero volume. If our universe is the singularity, then it could be that the entire universe is compressed into a single point of zero volume. This would explain why the universe appears to be expanding - we're not actually moving away from anything, we're just getting further compressed into the singularity.  \nThis theory also explains why we can't see beyond our universe - anything that gets too close to the event horizon of a black hole is pulled in and can't escape. In our case, the event horizon would be the edge of the universe, and anything that tries to escape would be pulled back in.  \nI know this theory sounds crazy, but it's not completely without merit. Some scientists have proposed similar ideas, and it's an interesting way to think about our universe. So, what do you guys think? Could we really be living inside a black hole?  \n\n\nSent from my iPhone",
