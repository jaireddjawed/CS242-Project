        "text": "After [last session's shenanigans](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5rwmz0/dd_the_rbg_gang_and_the_messy_night_out/), I was left with something of a dilemma. Do I have Coldsteel happily join them in the atrocities, or do I have him join the town's guard and face off against the party? Either way, I had to account for him being missing through that evening.\n\nThe gang, for those of you with short memories:\n\n&gt;Coldsteel the berbarian\n\n&gt;BBW the dire wolf\n\n&gt;Blackstone Darkstone the psion\n\n&gt;Lucifer \"the betrayer\" Shadowthane the stealth archer\n\n&gt;Razordblade Spiderblade the ninja\n\n&gt;Lady Deathshroud the death cleric\n\n&gt;Azag, the leader of the orcs currently sacking Oringold\n\nI consider my options. Coldsteel knows the city is getting put to the torch. Coldsteel has spent his time in Oringold thus far taking guided tours around the museums and cultural landmarks.\n\nThe party, minus Lady and Groin, who left town after the well poisoning, but now with Azag in tow, are fighting their way down a street when Coldsteel bursts out the front door of the Oringold City museum, riding a golden sarcophagus pulled by BBW as a kind of treasure chariot, and [wearing an admiralty jacket as a cape](https://i.stack.imgur.com/FpJZgm.png). We mow down a line of tower shield wielding guards, but spot some paladins sparkling in the distance. Razorblade double tapped all the casualties and then we bravely legged it.\n\nAzag and Coldsteel are introduced, and quickly [make friends through their muscles](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B_KvOH2WwAAPdfz.png). Azag wants to take us back to his warchief to report, so we do, jumping fences and barging through hedges along the way to avoid the paladins.\n\nWe got to this shack in the slums that's serving as headquarters for the orcish warchief, Nazdreg. Azag goes in and talks to him, we hear his grunt of surprise when Azag refers to *infiltrators*, plural, and he shouts for us to get in there. \n\nNazdreg the orcish warchief is huge, and sat on top of a pile of human skulls. He looks at us, we look at him, and he asks who the fuck we are.\nColdsteel, not privy to Blackstone's claim to be an orcish infiltrator, looks to either side of him before introducing himself as Coldsteel the Berbarian. Lucifer, not wanting to be upstaged, adds that he is Lucifer Shadowthane. Blackstone adds that we are from the temple of Gruumsh, a technically factual statement. Nazdreg raises an eyebrow, and begins to question him in orcish. Blackstone thankfully does speak orcish, and so he responds in kind rather than in a series of racist grunts. Blackstone knows just enough about Gruumsh's religion to pass as an acolyte, and in light of our help to Azag, Nazdreg reluctantly lets us go. (Well, he screams at us to fuck off before he has us killed, but for a Gruumsh worshipping  orc warboss that's practically courteous) \n\nWith Azag no longer accompanying us, we are left with something of a problem: being in a burning city and not being on anyone's side. Furthermore, Oringold's forces are well-organized and equipped, and seem to be holding off the orcs. \n\nWe need to get out of the city, and fast. The gates are blocked off by the worst of the fighting, and the aqueducts are now full of poison, thanks to Blackstone and Lady's handiwork, so we decide that we have to escape over the walls. The walls are improbably high and improbably thick, so we will have to use ropes to climb down. There is one problem with this, however- BBW. Being a wolf, he can't climb a rope, and he's nowhere near tame enough for a harness. Knocking him unconscious is also out of the question, as he's the size of a carhorse and too heavy for any of us to drag at speed. \n\nAfter seriously considering digging a tunnel through the walls with our magic weapons, we decide the best way to go about this is to get BBW extremely drunk. We bust into a nearby bar, looking for a keg that he can drink from, only to find that a group of orcs have already broken in, and are doggedly drinking their way through the strong liquors. Blackstone holds out his holy symbol of Gruumsh like a talisman (which it is) and screams at them in orcish to go see Nazdreg at once. The orcs are confused at this, as we are not orcs but three humans and an elf, but thankfully they are drunk enough to buy our story and they amble out.\n\nThe next part of the plan is to get BBW drunk. Coldsteel splits a barrel in two with his axe to let the big wolf drink from it. Thankfully, BBW is fond of beer and doesn't take much convincing to drink it all, but what we didn't count on was how clumsy he would be once inebriated. After BBW [struggles to use all four of his legs at once](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/fa/20/a0/fa20a02da6555a08035cb2c87b3058be.gif), we unhitch him from the treasure chariot and load its contents into Razorblade's bag of holding. As the golden sarcophagus is too large for the bag, and too unwieldy for any of us to carry, we are forced to leave it behind.\n\nWith Coldsteel supporting the swaying dire wolf, we make our way to the top of the walls. With the fighting heavy in the city, most of the guard posts are unmanned, and we are not contested as Lucifer constructs a beautiful and elaborate hoist system to safely lower the now docile BBW to the ground. \n\nIn our hurry, we leave the ropes in place when we go, and a single tear runs down Lucifer's face as he looks back. Not at the city in flames, not at the lives he has ruined, but at this masterpiece wrought in rope.\n\nJoin us next time, when the gang ~~are mercilessly hunted by paladin deathsquads~~ [decide to found their own museum/amusement park.](Https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5tru68/dd_the_rbg_gang_and_the_time_we_split_the_party/)\n\n\n",

        "text": "[I'm just going to start this off by saying that this is the campaign I've had the most fun running, and we're only on the first session. Everyone has been committed and involved, and I think that is why I'm so psyched that I'm channeling my energy into this campaign diary. So please, read on, and I hope you can see a bit of what makes this campaign so fun for my players and I.]\n\nOur story begins 20 years ago, in the year 181 of the Age of Heavens. To a noble family of some renown, ruling over a small chain of island bearing the same name as her family, a child named Telsanna was given. This changeling child was taken in by her father, partially because of the moon-shaped brand upon her forehead - a holy symbol of the long-deceased God of Light, Angelus. Telsanna was raised at the center of a minor cult around her, and she acted as an oracle to her followers. Amongst these followers was a suli magus known as Cir-Ah, who became one of her most trusted followers.\n\nIn the year 201 Heavens, betrayal struck. The island home of Telsanna was overthrown, and she was forced to escape in exile, Cir-Ah in tow, heading for the new continent of Siyon across the Astral Sea. After a harrowing journey, they arrived, but soon met a goblin guide known as Papar Dum. At Dum's recommendation, they decided to land at Sevenwood - Siyon was in the middle of a fight for its independence, and Sevenwood was a small town in one of the neutral colonies, the perfect place for refugees to get their bearings.\n\nDum led them away from the con artist waiting to scheme refugees out of their coin and to the Black Dragon Inn, run by an old friend of his - Bihook. At Telsanna's quiet insistence, Bihook told her of a couple rumors going around town. A rich half-orc cardsharp was looking to gamble. Someone had been placing graffiti on the Temple of Cetus, the sole stone building in town. Lastly, the tomb of an ancient kasatha hero had been discovered, but there was no obvious entry.\n\nTelsanna, a religious person herself, decided to investigate the church. At Cir-Ah's Intimidation, the halfling who cleaned the graffiti drew the symbol upon a pad of paper, although he himself had no clue what it might mean. However, the next stop proved fortuitous: while buying some equipment at a magic shop, Cir-Ah happened to ask the shopkeeper, Triple M, if he knew the symbol - and he did. It was the symbol of Brevedor, the Bear-Drake, son of the Wolf God Lykos. Brevedor is worshipped amongst the Wyrmsmoke Tribe of goblins, of whom Dum had battled before and was not particularly impressed by. Cir-Ah also asked about the tomb, and discovered the name of the hero entombed within: Kill 10,000 Demons [Kasatha in my universe take names after their greatest accomplishment]. With this information, they decided to retire to their rooms in the Black Dragon Inn.\n\nNoting two kasatha bodyguards protecting a drunken gnome, Cir-Ah strikes up a conversation, although they don't speak Common and he doesn't speak Kasatha. Struggling through a game of gestures, all played in-character, the bodyguards (Regards the Work of the Gods in Despair and Never Misses Throwing Away) clumsily outline the story of Kill 10,000 Demons serving as a magus representative of Brevedor over 1,000 years ago, before betraying Brevedor after his brother, Saves City of Glass, was killed for \"Not dying muk honor.\"\n\nThe three sleep, and in the morning, decide to explore this tomb. Along the way, after nearly dying to a giant lizard, they meet a dragonborn paladin known as Sir Arzalak and his half-elf squire, Legna. Arzalak informs them 3 adventurers recently went into the Tomb, although he has moral compunctions against tomb raids. Telsanna appeals to his honor and good nature by asking him if he's comfortable with their disappearance and the disappearance of their party, to which Arzalak relents and joins - Telsanna does have something like +10 Diplomacy. All these were random encounters - which in my game, is done by rolling 1d100 and subtracting the party leader's survival, with lower encounters being less dangerous and encounters 1-15 being non-combat encounters. Papar Dum rolled a 78 and an 12, and had a survival of 5, so the party got a tough encounter and \"a visit by two friendly NPCs.\"\n\nThe party enters the tomb - which, they don't know but I'm silently screaming about, is a Pathfinder conversion of the Tomb of Horrors. I've established the paladin as a paladin 5/cleric 5, so I hope I can kill him via dice rolls in front of the party and deter them from this dungeon for a bit. Still, I've made it a policy not to fudge rolls in this game, so everything must be in front of the players - I find that gives them a better sense of when they need to run or fight smarter.\n\nAnyways, as expected, the first trap does trigger - none of them have any good Perception, as a result of a low WIS on Telsanna and Cir-Ah and Dum being new players. Telsanna and Dum make their Reflex rolls to avoid some damage, but Cir-Ah and Arzalak are too close to the door. Rocks fall, I roll 10d6 in front of the players... Cir-Ah manages to hang on by 2 HP, Arzalak by 10, but both are buried under rock. Telsanna and Dum clamber out of their positions under the rubble, and quickly do their best to dig out Cir-Ah and Arzalak as the floor begins to sink and spouts slowly fill the pit with cement. After several bad checks, all four manage to escape with some clever rope-work by Dum.\n\nThe party rests for the night, Arzalak healing them, but injuries he's sustained give Legna, a Bard (Archaeologist), the opportunity to fill in for her master. Now much smarter, the party very carefully move into the next entrance, having Legna disarm the trap. Continuing very carefully, the party finds two magic swords - one of which is Cir-Ah's, the other becomes a gift to Legna - and an enchanted +2 Charisma veil. However, the veil whispers paranoia into the ears of whoever wears it (I have each party member make a Will save, and all succeed, so it doesn't actually dominate them). Telsanna becomes convinced that Arzalak wants to kill her, and is a member of the same knights that exiled her, and has Cir-Ah put on the veil to hear the whispers too. Together, they decide to kill Arzalak. They have Dum put on the veil, and although he hears a different message, Telsanna/Cir-Ah were vague enough in their description of what was said to them that he doesn't put two and two together. \n\nArzalak joins them in the dungeon, and Legna falls to a put trap. Arzalak takes off his armor to climb down the trap and rescue her, relying on the party to hold the rope. The party doesn't act against him - yet. He ties Legna to the rope, as she is unconscious and taking 1d4 CON damage each round. The party pulls him up, leaving him in the pit, as he yells at them to go get a potion from his bag to cure Legna. Cir-Ah and Telsanna rush to the pack, while Dum interrogates Arzalak from above, calling it suspicious that Legna was injured and Arzalak was not. Cir-Ah trips on his way back with the potion, and is too late to save Legna, who the party had grown quite attached to.\n\nThe party curses Arzalak some more before letting him out, at his demand. He casts Raise Dead on Legna (yes, I know, he shouldn't be able to, but Legna was the NPC the party had gotten attached to, and it seemed more dramatic). However, a homerule I have for my game (because I dislike easy resurrection) is that the Goddess of Death demands a life for a life - so Arzalak dies to resurrect his squire.\n\nThat is where the session ended. Legna, unconscious and weak, Arzalak, dead, and the party, confused and remorseful, all in the third entrance of the Tomb of Horrors...",

        "text": "(Dramatic title is dramatic, but you'll see what I mean...)\n\n[[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/5poypz/5e_ideas_for_making_a_former_villain_sympathetic/)] TL;DR: the players were going up against an old enemy of theirs, and I wanted to give them the possibility of \"redeeming\" him, as they've done for virtually every other antagonist so far. To do so, I needed a way to ensure my players didn't kill him on sight--i.e., I needed a way to make him at least a little sympathetic.\n\nWell. Last night's session was the moment of truth--and I think my players *loved* it. \n\n------------------------\n\n**Background:** \n\nThe villain, whose name is Deimos, has been dogging the player's steps for some time. He was an Inqusitor of the goddess of courage, and hunted down and exterminated cults of the goddess of fear--who the players were then (sorta) working for. Naturally, they didn't get along. \n\n[I've been hinting](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/5owqi7/suddenly_and_strangely_you_realize/) at Deimos's Tragic Backstory^TM for some time, though the hints have been vague and spread far apart: basically, once upon a time, Deimos was married, but his wife died suddenly and unexpectedly. Though Deimos has never spoken of what happened, he blames himself for it.\n\nIn a recent adventure, Deimos went completely off the deep end, and siezed an artifact of the Goddess of Fear--an evil, magical crown--for himself. Using the Crown, he killed a member of the party, then vanished in a puff of smoke. \n\nFor the current adventure, the Goddess of Fear, who the party was kinda working for again, sent the group to a specific city where Deimos was hiding. She asked them to retrieve the Crown, then to \"make him scream\" (in a bad way). The party ran into Deimos, but he ran away; however, it quickly became clear that the bigger problem was an infestation of Slaadi (big, ugly chaos-aligned beasties, who reproduce by laying eggs inside living humans). With the help of an NPC, the players started fighting the Slaad.\n\nHowever, the party rogue had snuck away from the party, twice, and run into Deimos both times. She (the Rogue) had spared him, but had actually lied to the party about it--she told them that Deimos had slipped away from her, or that she had simply gotten lost. \n\nThe players and the NPC got into a fight against some Slaadi, and had done fairly well; however, they got ambushed by one last Slaad, one that could have killed the party Sorcerer. At the last moment, Deimos appeared, and, using the Crown, cast a Darkness spell. The Darkness allowed the Rogue to assassinate the Slaad, but Deimos teleported away before anyone could talk to him.\n\n--------------------------\n\n**Last Night:**\n\nSurprise! The NPC turned out to be the Rogue's nemesis. Rogue tried to backstab him, but he was ready and waiting for her, and *went to town* on her. While he did so, he revealed that she had lied to the party--she had met Deimos and spared his life, then lied about it to the players.\n\nAfter killing the NPC, the party confronted the Rogue, who has a bit of a reputation for being, shall we say, *disruptive.* The Rogue confessed that, yes, she had met Deimos, and that she *had* lied; however, she had an ulterior motive for sparing him. She also revealed that Deimos, too, was fighting the Slaadi.\n\nThe party Cleric, a rather aggressively happy, optimistic, and touchy-feely sort, immediately cried out in joy. \"He's killing the Slaad? That means we don't have to kill him!\" Everyone else just kinda rolled their eyes.\n\nThe party turned to leave--only to find Deimos standing inside a doorway a block or two away, sans Crown. He was waiting for them, but very clearly didn't want to fight. He was also looking at a pendant, which he slipped back inside his shirt as the party approached. The party was super-suspicious--for example, Cleric whipped out his Wand of Paralysis and used it on him (he passed the Con save), and a couple other party members readied for battle. But he simply took it, not reacting at all, until they actually tried talking to him. \n\nDeimos told them that killing the NPC probably wasn't wise, but he understood why they did it. He also apologized for killing the party member; though he took responsibility, he also told them that he was acting under the influence of another Evil God, whose control he had only just barely managed to shake. In fact, the killing of the party member (and a few of his own allies who were caught in the blast) horrified him enough to help him break free.\n\n[As they were talking, Rogue managed to steal the pendant he had been examining, which turned out to be a golden locket.]\n\nDeimos revealed that he had a plan to kill the Slaadi, and that he needed the players' help to do so. Using a player's ability to see through the eyes of the Slaad (like Harry Potter from Order of the Phoenix), the party figured out what their nest was, and Deimos urged them to go and to start cleaning it out. \n\nBefore he left, though, he allowed the players to ask him a question, to which he would be completely honest. The players decided to ask why he no longer had the Crown, and he told them that its power was not meant for mortals, himself not excepted. He used it only when he *had* to--and, when he was done with it, he was going to hide or destroy it. For the moment, it was hidden somewhere they would never find it.\n\nDeimos turned to walk away when [at my urging], the Cleric asked why he had become an Inquisitor in the first place. This question stopped him *cold.* After a long pause, he said: \"My wife died in my arms, because I was too afraid to save her.\" He walked away without another word.\n\nAs soon as he disappeared, Rogue pulled out the locket she'd stolen. The party gathered around; Rogue opened it, revealing a portrait of a pretty woman, with a lock of her hair inside. Immediately, several party members started to feel bad for Deimos, and three or four even tried to get the locket back from the Rogue.\n\nBefore he left, Deimos had told the party that he had something to take care of, but would meet them at the Slaadi's nest. Several players followed Deimos to see what he would do, and, to their surprise, he went to go retrieve the Crown from where he had hidden it. As soon as he had the Crown, the party, including the Cleric, revealed itself. Cleric begged Deimos to reconsider--\"We can save you! You don't have to use the Crown anymore!\"--to which Deimos replied \"You don't understand. *I don't want to walk away from this.\"*\n\nThe party tried to tackle him, but he soaked another blast from the Wand of Paralysis, then teleported away. \n\n*Skipping some juicy bits to focus on the villain:* \n\nThe party found the nest, and was trying to liberate the prisoners, while Deimos, using the Crown, remained outside. He was luring all the Slaadi, all across the city, to protect their nest, and was doing what he could to stem the tide. \n\nAnd then, Deimos threw his hands over his head, and, using the powers of the Crown, began to summon a [Spirit Bomb.](https://youtu.be/xsHRRHW6sGw?list=PL6EC7B047181AD013&amp;t=212) I had the players make an Insight check, with those who succeeded realizing that Deimos wasn't going to make it out of this--unless they did something, he was going to kill himself. \n\nMost of the party braced themselves for what was about to happen, but Warlock rushed in to try and grab the Crown from Deimos in an effort to protect him, while Cleric flew in and cast Death Ward (which made him sorta-invincible). \n\nThe bomb went off and destroyed the Slaadi--but also the building in which the players were hiding. As the smoke cleared, the players saw, to their surprise, that Warlock, Cleric, and Deimos were standing on a six-foot section of ground that had been protected from the blast and burned with the holy symbol of one of their goddesses. \n\nDeimos himself was frantically fighting Warlock for the Crown, but she managed to pull it away from him (with a critical success). Barbarian tackled Deimos to the ground, and, though Deimos struggled, he eventually gave up. As he lay there, robbed of both his last great sacrifice and his own dramatic death, he started to cry in hurt, anger, and frustration.\n\nBarbarian--who was the closest friend of the party member that Deimos had killed--pulled out his sword and threatened Deimos with it. Deimos looked up at him, and Barbarian realized that *he actually WANTED it.* \n\nThe party, being my party, tried to reassure and comfort him, trying to convince him that, despite how much he hated himself, and how much he'd failed, he could still change and do better. Given a terrible streak of rolls on my part, they succeeded, and Deimos began to openly weep. \n\n[Face-palmy part: it's been established that Deimos still blames himself for, and feels guilty over, what happened to his wife. That said, one of the players still tried to convince him to ease up, claiming that \"This isn't what your wife would have wanted!\" Not only did that touch a nerve, that touched *the* nerve, and Deimos almost strangled her--or would have, if the Barbarian didn't still have him pinned.]\n\nThe players huddled up and tried to decide what to do next. The Goddess of Fear had ordered them to \"make him scream,\" but he had apparently repented and genuinely regretted what he'd done. After some fierce arguing, they decided to give him back to the gods and let them decide.\n\nAt that moment, they heard someone clapping--a long, loud, slow clap. They turned to see the Goddess of Fear herself standing there, watching them. Deimos, as soon as he saw her, dropped to his knees and bowed himself to the ground.\n\n\"I thought I told you to *make him scream,\"* she said. The players protested that he was *different* now, to which she scoffed. \n\nThe Goddess of Fear spent some time with the players, accepting the Crown, giving them their rewards, and prepping them for their next assignment. She then turned to leave, but, before she did, she looked over at Deimos and sneered at him. \"Do whatever you want with this *trash,\"* she said, before disappearing. \n\nThe party helped Deimos to his feet, and he, somewhat reluctantly, somewhat quietly, thanked them and promised to do better. \n\n--------------------------\n\nSo, to answer the original question: How do we make a villain sympathetic? Let's recap:\n\nDeimos basically put himself in the party's power, knowing they had it out for him. Then, he showed them exactly where to find the artifact that they'd been searching for, removing any real reason to keep him alive. He also revealed that he was suicidal, and that, given all the mistakes he made, *wanted* to die.\n\nAfter all that was established. Deimos did his damnedest to kill himself, essentially, forcing the players to take action if they wanted him alive. Even after that, he more-or-less begged the Barbarian to kill him.\n\nEven then--they passed the decision to me, by saying \"Let the gods take care of it!\" And I threw it right back: \"Do what you want with this *trash.\"*\n\nI basically *begged* them to kill Deimos. *And still, after all that--*they still saved him.\n\nMy party is amazing, guys :)",

He drops a large spike, and reveals that the spike is attached to a large chain. \"HOW DARE YOU ATTACK MY MEN!\" he shouts, swinging his large weapon angrily(Crit). The large blade slices clean through K'iltar's chest, leaving a very large, gushing wound(4d6+5 for 15, 8hp remaining) K'iltar gasps realizing the blow he's just taken. The other pirate, with a hole in his chest, realizes the oppertunity has arisen, and slashes at k'iltar(8 damage, 0 health exactly) K'iltar takes a breath and falls to the ground in excruciating pain, screaming at the top of his lungs.\n\n\"K'ILTAR!!!!!\" The entire party shouts, seeing the rogue fall to the ground, bleeding profusely.(Deathsave natural1) K'iltar raises a hand, only for it to fall to the ground.\n\n\"NOOOOOO!!!!!\" Logan charges, evading an attack as he sprints. Suddenly, the Divine's light bathes his hands. \"PLEASE DON'T LEAVE US!\" He slams his hands on K'iltar's chest, bathing his body in the light of the divines. The light shines so brightly that the pirates, and the party stop for a moment. Only a moment, as they witness the true power of the paladin. The light slowly fades, as the rogue begins breathing again.(healed for 15)\n\nAlexander charges hookbeard, Screaming furiously. His axe comes down right on his shoulder, stopping on the bone.  A small gush of blood spurts out of the wound. Hookbeard retaliates, Swinging his chain blade around, but overshooting and missing completely. \n\nThe other pirate notices the paladin, and stabs furiously. Logan raises his shield in the nick of time, and the blade bounces off with a metalic clang. Logan looks behind the pirate, and sees K'iltar on his feet, his face twisted in rage.\"You...You dare to strike me DOWN?!\" His fury takes hold, and his rapier, in one clean thrust, pierces through the skull of the pirate(sneak attack crit) The fragments of bone and brain splatter all over, bouncing off Logans shield.\n\nMecina, Still in her feral bear form, Takes another bite out of the pirate. He clutches his shoulder in pain. Mecina raises him up, and with a flick of her neck, tosses the man overboard. As he is sent flying, she charges the other pirate, who swings, piercing her flesh. The wound is shallow but painful.\n\nAlexander retrieves his axe from the shoulder of Hookbeard, And swings again. He connects, slashing Hookbeard's stomach. A flesh wound, but certainly painful. Hookbeard simply laughs. \"Traitors! ALL of you are traitos!\" As he speaks, he is bathed by holy light.\n\n\"Hookbeard! Your battle is with me alone!\" Logan says. (Compel duel, success) \n\"Fine! Take THIS!\" He shouts, swining his large chain weapon towards the paladin. He swings wide, wrapping the chain around the ironclad warrior. \n\nWith a smile on his face, Logan turns. \"Do it K'iltar.\" K'iltar understands. He dashes behind the man...no, the monster that stands before him. His rapier, still slick with blood, glistening in the wind. The halfling jumps, and with all the might he could muster, pierces the man through the heart. Blood begins to seep. In this moment, both knew that no words needed to be said. Both knew everything that would have been said, and knew the futility of speaking. Hookbeard, simply slumped down, releasing his grip on the chain(Sneak attack, Kill)\n\nMecina swipes her razor claws across the chest of the last pirate, and he slumps to the ground in a heap. The battle is over, but the price was great. K'iltar faints from the exertion. As he hits the deck of the ship, matte with blood, large tentacles begin rising from the sea. \n\n\"no....\" Logan says. The kraken has found them...\n\n*SESSION END*\n\nEdit: Breating to Breathing.",

Lady decides to stay behind, as she is looking after her abomination baby.\n\nOn the way to the pub, we decide we are going to commission copies of the knife of the local legend Eviserrak in order to frame Eviserrak for hypothetical future crimes.\n\nWe get to the Golden Hind and Coldsteel asks the bartender for the most expensive drink. This turns out to be something called a \"Gnomish Tinkler\". The bartender carefully mixes and pours the liqueurs, and Coldsteel is presented with a rainbow striped drink from which a glittering mist rises. When he lifts the glass, the drink plays a jaunty tune. The rest of the gang are impressed, and order gnomish tinklers too.\n\nThis attracts the attention of another group of drinkers, a group of gnomes on a bachelor party. Their names are Flo'in, Jaro'in, Tu'in and … Groin. Groin rankles at being called \"Groin\" for some reason, and Lucifer finds this pretty funny. We get to talking and they teach us the words to the song the tinkler plays. Flo'in is going on and on about how gnomes are better than elves, and Lucifer gets angry and challenges him to an archery contest. \n\nWell, there is only one way to conduct an archery contest, as well we know. We give Blackstone an apple to balance on his head and tell him to stand against the wall.\n\nColdsteel asks to participate in the contest, representing humans, and Lucifer and Flo'in agree. As he doesn't own a bow, Coldsteel goes to the other side of the room and pulls out his greataxe. The room is silent as Coldsteel whirls the greataxe around his head. Blackstone swallows his fear and manifests some extra hitpoints. At heavy penalties, Coldsteel throws… and hits! The bar erupts into cheers, Blackstone sinks to his knees and the apple falls in two halves either side of him. The gnomes are impressed, and even Lucifer admits there is no topping that. Groin says that's a cop-out but everyone ignores him.\n\nAt this point, the gnomes join us on our bar crawl. They take our plan to frame Eviserrak for crimes as a precursor to some kind of epic prank, and decide to help us. They tell us they know a guy who can cast fabricate and goad us into breaking into an ironworks to get the raw materials for the dagger. We do just that, with Coldsteel Kool-aid manning it through a shop door and leaving money at the till. \n\nGroin spikes Lucifer's drink with some sort of wisdom damage poison. When the poison has taken hold, Groin bets Lucifer he can't jump over a building whilst riding BBW. Lucifer, ever game for this sort of thing, even moreso at wisdom 6, manages to climb onto BBW without getting eaten, and tries the jump. About twenty feet in the air, BBW decides he doesn't want an elf on his back, and throws Lucifer off. Lucifer falls crotch first onto a chimney stack and talks in a falsetto for the rest of the night, much to Groin's amusement.\n\nBBW starts to get sick from all the booze the party have been feeding him, and so Coldsteel and BBW stay behind at a pub in the artisan district. [AN: I was away for a session]\n\nThe rest of the gang are between pubs when they stumble upon a gang of orcs robbing a grocery store. The orcs notice them, they notice the orcs, and there's something of a stand-off.\n\nFinally, Blackstone pulls out a holy symbol of Gruumsh (remember how I mentioned we lived in an abandoned temple of Gruumsh?) and claims that he is an agent of the temple, sent by his chieftan. The leader of the orcs accepts his claim, and greets Blackstone as an apparent brother in faith. Flo'in, Tu'in and Jaro'in get freaked out at this point, and leave, but Groin is fascinated.\n\nThe orc leader, Azag, outlines his plan to Blackstone. He has been smuggling orcs into the city for months and hiding them in the slums. At the signal, the orcs within the city will rise up and sack it. The gang tries to get Azag to come drinking with them, offering to take him into the Gilded Lily, the most exclusive drinking hole in the duchy. Believing the party to be orcish infiltrators, Azag agrees, concluding that the chaos sown by assassinating the key public figures who frequent the bar will allow his attack to succeed earlier than planned.\n\nRazorblade and Lucifer take Azag to a tailors, and intimidate the tailor into altering a courtier's outfit to fit him. They then go to the Gilded Lily, where they convince the bouncer to let them pass by having him hug Lucifer (an elf) and claiming he is the orcish ambassador.\n\nMeanwhile, Blackstone, Lady (having rejoined the party and being the only one who is completely sober) and Groin are going around the city. Blackstone asks for a hallucinogen to make people unable to respond to the orc invasion, but Groin brews up something deadly instead, and they end up poisoning all the wells, murdering the guards who catch them doing it, and throwing those bodies down the poisoned wells.\n\nOnce Razorblade and Lucifer get Azag inside the Gilded Lily, he starts murdering the people inside. Razorblade and Lucifer join in, Lucifer shouting his own name as he does so. They manage to get the city treasurer, several of the Duke's counsellors, and the fourth in line to the throne, along with many local business leaders. The slaughter concluded, they loot the room, choosing to cut off hands rather than pry off rings. Azag is happy, and sets off the signal for the orc attack.\n\n\nJoin us next time for the tale of our [valiant escape.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5shk96/dd_the_rbg_gang_escape_from_oringold_city/)\n",

        "text": "So, I'm currently running a 5e pirate-style campaign with 3 of my friends. The group consists of a water-genesai fighter named \"Wet\", a goliath cleric (life) named \"Mavek Hellfist\", and a fire-genesai wizard named \"Siegfried Flamehaus\". \n\nThey had been hired by a college to assist in a salvaging expedition of an old sunken ship. They were given some gear, heavy iron boots and magical spear guns, and a wizard npc companion to help assist them with things like water breathing. Once down there, they discovered that a small group of Kuo-toa had emerged from the Underdark and set up shop around the sunken ship. These Kuo-toa were shown to be highly religious, but also very quick to convert to a new belief if one should be shown to them. They had cast aside their old goddess (Blibdoolpoolp), and had begun to worship a giant crab present inside the shipwreck as a god of death. It basically killed anything that went near the ship, but it also protected the Kuo-toa from other large predators. \n\nOnce they arrive, they quickly find a survivor of the last group sent down here, and the npc wizard tells them he'll be back in 30 minutes after he takes this guy back up to the surface, and to not go anywhere without him. Naturally, they forge ahead anyways. As they were traveling through the crude cave system around the boat, they had a few encounters, and there was always one Kuo-toa that always got away. They became obsessed with chasing it down, and finally cornered it and another Kuo-toa in a room blocked by a crude barricade made from driftwood. \n\nAt this point, Siegfried had cast \"comprehend languages\" on himself to try to understand what these creatures were saying. Wet's player tells me he wants to kick down the barricade, step inside the room, and shoot the second Kuo-toa to intimidate the scared one. I tell him to roll, and he kicks down the barricade with a solid 18, steps into the room, and crits the poor Kuo-toa with max damage. The scared one now loses his shit. He immediately abandons his faith, and bows down to Wet, calling him a god. Siegfried translates this, and Wet uses \"shape water\" to create an ice crown attached to his head and a flow of water rolling off his back like a cape. \n\nTheir new friend (Blip) tells them about the crab god, which he referred to as the \"Deathless One\", and the Kuo-toa Archpriest named Janic, who basically ran the group. He leads them to a back entrance of the main room of the cave system, where about 30 Kuo-toa were living. The party basically just busts into the room, ice crown shining, water cape flowing, and Blip yelling about a new god that these guys just have to follow. The Kuo-toa, initially caught off guard, don’t really attack the players, and they actually listen quite close while Blip spins this bullshit tale about Wet's brilliance. Janic soon swims into the room, brought here by all the commotion. He casts \"tongues\" on himself, and then proceeds to rip into the players, calling Wet a false god and a surface dweller. \n\nWet and Janic begin this massive argument, with insults and mocking names flying back and forth. Siegfried now starts casting \"prestidigitation\", adding colorful sparks to Wet's already impressive display of magic. Eventually Janic tires of the argument and throws down the glove. He tells the players that if Wet is truly a god, then killing the Deathless One should be no problem for them. Wet, of course, accepts Janic's proposal, and the group proceeds to the shipwreck. The deck of the ship has a massive hole in it, and the Deathless One awaits on the floor below.\n\nThe players jump down, and are greeted by [this] (https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/04/87/2a/04872afe925b7219ec60d356d66e5fa6.jpg). Because of the Kuo-toa's belief in it, I gave the crab a necrotic aura that dealt 2d4 damage to anyone who ended their turn within 5 feet of it. The players rolled initiative, and Wet and Siegfried both rolled the same number. A long fight broke out, and it took the players 8 turns to get the crab low. It finally dropped to 2 hp when Wet's turn came around again. I told him that the crab was limping, and that blood was pouring out of its mouth; it wouldn't last much longer. I also tell the group that there are about 20 or so Kuo-toa looking down on the fight from the hole above.\n\nWet drops him spear gun, and pulls out both of his sabers as he walks towards the almost dead crab. Siegfried's player tells me that he wants to move towards the shadows of the corner of the room and prepare a spell. Since he and Wet had rolled the same initiative, and because I was curious about what he had planned, I allowed the simultaneous turn. Wet approached the crab, looked up at the Kuo-toa above, and made two attacks against the crab. He rolled a 6 and a 15, while the crabs AC was 16. I really wanted to \"rule of cool\" it, but I placed my trust in the wizard and told him both attacks missed. Siegfried then throws a chromatic orb (cold) at the crab from the shadows. As it sailed through the water, it struck the back of Wet's blade, exploding into a shower of ice shards and absolutely shredded the crab's face, killing it. To the Kuo-toa above, unable to see the wizard, it looked as though Wet had missed his attacks, and then just exploded the crab with some sort of delayed magic. They soon swam down as well, and began to worship Wet's magnificence. \n\nThat's where we ended the session, and my players left super pumped about next week's session. In addition to combat experience, I also awarded them a ton of experience for helping Wet keep up his charade. Now my players have a small army of Kuo-toa worshiping one of them, and I have to figure out how to role-play this for the next session.\n",

        "text": "**Edit:** only now do I realize I put part 1 and session 1 in the title.\n\nSo if you are a Red Court Infected with a human girlfriend named 'Veronica' or have a homoerotic crush on a warlock named Niki Valentine do NOT read ahead! (Or you Kristian, even though you haven't joined yet!) Also, *trigger warning*, this involves magical shenanigans involving enchanted \"seduction\" that is basically a less-disturbing rape (but not by or to the players, only involving victims they are saving from a villain).\n\nAlright, so me and my group had been having a blast with *Urban Shadows* but decided we wanted something a bit **more** open-ended and diverse so my sister pitched in and I grabbed the *Dresden Files RPG* books to run a new game in them. This session only has two players because my girlfriend is on a family trip and my younger brother had a project due last night. Also keep in mind neither I nor my players have read the novels, and so there will be changes to things not only because of lack of familiarity but also from the start I wanted my own variation of the setting, not playing exactly the same.\n\nMy first player was my younger sister, who had been a straight human huntress in the last game, but opted to try out the \"White Court Virgin\" (Vampires who feed off of emotions instead blood, and a Virgin being one who has not killed by draining yet so they're weaker but also less vulnerable) template and my friend grabbed the \"Red Court Infected\" (monstrous vampires, the infected have yet to fully turn so they're kind of half-vampires) template. The game is set in Toronto, \"Haven\" is the campaign title, the White Court of vampires hold domain over an old-timey event district and feed off positive emotions rather than negative ones, and the Red Court has been mostly pushed out, leaving the Infected who work to fight them (Fellowship of St. Giles) with far less to do day-to-day. Younger sister is a slightly-overzealous \"White Court Inquisitor\" named Lili, hunting murderous White Vampires for the leader when they exceed more than one kill, and the friend goes for a \"Mostly-Normal Blood Hunter\" named Lucius, he's not fully part of the Fellowship but works closely with them to fuck up the Red Court.\n\nI expected the session to only be an hour or two because of how long character creation took, but ultimately it turned into four and a half due to player enthusiasm. So the first set of events was pretty standard, both got a call to investigate some murdered humans on the lakeshore (presumably by some kind of vampire), met a Surly light-house keeper (who will come up constantly in future Lovecraftian plot-lines) and then found the bodies. They had been drained, but by something more like a large lamprey or leech, not a vampire. Nonetheless, they push forward to investigate (I compelled their better aspects to make them feel responsible) and track the prints to a dock maybe two kilometres up the coast. Meet a [hobo with a throbbing arm](https://i.imgur.com/6ZpxcrO.jpg) have super-powered fight and riddle him with bullets. He tries to escape into the lake but they down him, so instead the effected arm breaks off and swims away on its own.\n\nAfter they send his body back to the White Council of Wizards, the Council responds with \"investigate no further\". We carry out the next two-weeks in character of just Lucius looking for a job (currently failing, he has mediocre Rapport and a face-tattoo), and Lili looking for love by getting set up with one of her old friend's (Niki) friend. She goes on a date with unapproved sorcerer trying to become a magic doctor, every girl's dream etc. etc. **But you didn't come here for cute Wizard-Doctors and failed job interviews! You came for the LESBOMANCY.**\n\nSo they later get a separate call from their main patrons. To Lili it's the White Court Matron (Mother Fuentes) letting her know that either Fuentes' son Damion or a senior vampire named Victor is involved with a newer Coven of Warlocks in Liberty Village (hipster neighbourhood) and three college girls have gone missing in that area. Lucius gets a similar call about a new coven taking girls (though no mention of a Vampire) from the White Council and is hired to investigate and get evidence for the Council to move in.\n\nBoth arrive at their contacts (for Lucius it's two candidates trying to be recognized by the Council, for Lili it's Niki Valentine). Both end up getting a flyer from a warlock club called \"Morrigan's Den\" that had \"Enchantment! Summoning! Lesbomancy!\" at the bottom. They arrive at night, with Niki in tow, and recognize each other so they decide to join forces again to get the invesitgation done quicker.\n\nRight in the door, they're greeted by [The Wasp](https://i.imgur.com/Ue2zzRl.png), the owner of the club and unknown race/abilities, who is extremely friendly and upbeat, and points them in the direction of the hallway for the \"show\". They run into Victor (the senior White Court vampire) and a friend of his who looks like a balding Ned Flanders sweater-and-all (named Gary, he's a Emissary of Hell disguised to look as harmless as possible. He wears riot gear under the sweater). Short argument and Victor more or less flees the scene, but they do not pursue. Gary goes to watch the show, Niki right next to him. \n\nThe PCs don't enter the showroom, but they watch through a crack in the door (Lucius videotaping for evidence) as [this scene-NSFW-](https://i.imgur.com/W0LgsSl.jpg) unfolds before them. They watch in horror/interest until it finishes (yes, the girl ont he bottom is one of the missing college girls). They enter after wards and find the woman who was straddling the blindfolded girl, a witch named Sharon Rachstone, is still with the girl, and another of the missing girls laying with her, also blindfolded. Interrogation ensues, but Sharon is really good at evading blame and putting it on the PCs, saying things like \"Don't touch the performers without consent\" whenever the PCs go to remove the blindfolds or shake the girls awake, and then \"They're tired, if they wanted to talk they would answer you\" whenever the PCs try to wake the girls with their voices alone. Finally, Lili gets fed up and lays a hand on Rachstone pretending to be interested in joining in on the ritual, but really is making contact to incite guilt into her (Incite Emotions on Touch is a White Court power), Rachstone blurts out that she kidnapped the girls and calls for the Wasp to come in and kick the PCs out.\n\nThe Wasp comes in, both Rachstone and the PCs appeal to him, Rachstone saying they're harassing her and PCs telling him he's been hosting live rapes. He was not aware there was no consent, but just kicks everyone in the room out before he \"Crushes the whole goddamn room\". PCs secure the kidnapped girls and Rachstone bolts for it. Lili pursues and manages to catch her (Rachstone is not athletic). \n\nWe ended the session there but more is to come as the game continues! I've got lots of things lined up, like Jade Court vampire shenanigans in Chinatown, Lovecraftian horrors deep in the lakes, Demons popping up in the Garden District, Faerie Court intrigue in the Olde Haven, The Wasp possibly turning out to be Ah Muzen Cab, Morrigan's Coven making moves on the White Council, the Red Court being more present than once thought, and gang wars between the Pimps of the Garden District and a Lycanthrope biker gang called the Sable Steed Riders!",

He had no weapon, but his hand strike still hit with an impressive amount of force.\n\nCiara failed to deflect the blow, but her counterattack drew blood.  \"Ouch!\"  The boy yelped in pain.\n\n\"GET AWAY FROM MY LITTLE BROTHER!\"  A much larger figure burst from the bushes, striking out at Ciara.

He struck in a similar fashion to the young boy, and Ciara took a substantial amount of damage.\n\n\"Alright, wait, who are you two jokers?\"  Claust cracked his knuckles, ready for a fight.\n\n\"Us?  Hah!  You can't tell me you've never heard of us!

They're dressed too nicely to be bandits.\"  \"Hmm... good thinking, Matt.  Hey!  Are you guys bandits?\"\n\nLorelei and Ellisandra gave each other a sideways look before Anna spoke.  \"We are not.

These mountains are dangerous, full of goons that are real tough to crack, but our martial arts can break right through their guard.  Besides, I've always wanted to see Abel.\"\n\nThe older one introduced himself as Gares Revale, and the younger one as Matthew Revale.  (In Anima terms, both are Taos that specialize in Kempo, Tai Chi, and Kung Fu, as well as Velez - in Fire Emblem terms, this gives them the affect of being permanently Brave, and allowing them to attack an enemy's RES instead of his DEF.)\n\nWith the brothers' help, the martial art-using bandits that plagued the mountains were easily dispatched, and the party crossed the range.\n\nIt was then Anna turned to the party with an ashamed expression.  \"I admit, I requested we go this way for a reason.  One of the towns to the north... Abel has a spy there.  She recently sent a distress message, and she's in danger.  If she's still alive, we need to help her.\"  There was a slight uproar, and Lorelei simply said to Anna \"It's fine, just don't lie to us about where we're going again.  Just tell us what you need.\"\n\nAnna thanked everyone, and they ventured towards the town under the cover of night.  However, their trip would be short.\n\nAs it turned out, the spy had in fact been discovered, but was saved with the aid of a couple anti-Geneseal terrorists.  The three of them were running themselves, heading south to attempt to flee the garrison.  Together, they made a mighty force.  \n\nThe spy was a Duk'Zarist Nephilim named Bella-Luna DuCarre, an ambidextrous Myrmidon who dual-wielded a rapier and a sword. In Anima terms, an Acrobatic Warrior.\n\nOne of her helpers was a human girl named Nora Adelee, a psychic specializing in Psychokinesis, giving her both offensive and defensive powers.  In Anima terms, a Mentalist.\n\nThe other was a knight, a moogle named Kubanzo Mog.  A heavily armored combatant who preferred to use a hefty lance forged specifically for him.  In Anima Terms, a weaponmaster.\n\nTogether, the three of them were the only units on the map at first.  Their objective was for Bella-Luna to retreat from the south end of the map within 20 turns.  They fled south, following a path through the trees and slaying Geneseal patrols for a few turns before the party's main force arrived at the south end of the map.  There was a substantial force between the groups, so Anna and company began to work on them while Bella-Luna and her allies kept moving.\n\nThen everything went to hell.  On command from an unknown general, Geneseal wizards sent light spells into the sky, eliminating the fog of war, and revealing that the Grand Archon himself, Matthew Gaul, General of the Geneseal 1st, had arrived in pursuit of the spy.  When Anna saw him, she panicked and advised everyone to avoid him. (In terms of power, he was definitely The Black Knight from the Radiant FE games.)\n\nHowever, Bella's escape became delayed, and Kubanzo and Nora made the decision to stand their ground and buy her time.  When Gaul closed the gap, Kubanzo actually sustained a blow from him without buckling (though he was reduced to critical HP.)  A single extra attack would finish him.\n\n\"Matt, let's do it!\"  \"You got it, big bro!\"  Gares and Matt sprang into action.  Combining their ki energy, they unleashed an attack known as the \"Shining Heaven Storm,\" named for the martial art style they both used.  The blast was so powerful that it wiped out the majority of the pursuit force, and cleared the way for Bella.  It also drew Gaul's attention, and Gares and Matt broke ranks to charge and engage him.  \"Anna!  Get going, we'll catch up!\"  Matt sounded resolute as the two of them combined their powers to fight Gaul.\n\nWith the two brothers distracting him, Bella was able to escape, and the battle ended.  It was a short while later that Matt caught up to the party... weeping, bloodied, and carrying the gauntlet that Gares had been wearing.  Gares was nowhere to be found, and Matt was almost inconsolable.  \"B...b...big bro, he...\"\n\nIt would be a long time before the party got anything out of him regarding what happened.  While Lorelei and Ellisandra comforted young Matt, Bella-Luna gave her report to Anna.  Apparently, the Geneseal army had been drafting villages, and slaughtering those who refused to fight.  They were preparing for a full scale conflict.\n\nThe next village that was supposed to be hit was a day or so west, and right now Anna and her group were ahead of the Geneseal army.  She asked Lorelei and Ellisandra for their opinion - was it worth delaying their return to aid the villagers?  The decision was 'yes, it is worth it.'  Together, they raced towards a nearby village, Matt still carrying the gauntlet (now revealed to be the Susano'o, a powerful weapon,) but refusing to put it on... or put it down, for that matter.\n\nWhen they arrived at the village, they saw that they weren't TOO late, but the Geneseal advance draft force had arrived, and already begun their work.  Still, in the middle of the village there was an impressive fight happening.  A large armored figure, around Claust's size, was protecting an archer while she shot down the soldiers that came for them.\n\nThe party ran to aid them, and introductions were made when they revealed they were not Geneseal.  The girl introduced herself as Cassandra Strauss, obviously an archer. (In Anima terms, a Ranger.)  The man did not speak, but he seemed incapable of it.  Claust made a joke about him being a real Atlas if he was wearing that much heavy stuff, and the name stuck.  Atlas joined up as well to defend the village.  Atlas was a knight who refused to use a weapon, instead preferring to act as a guardian. (In Anima terms, a weaponmaster who used a shield, and who had the special ability to redirect any attack on an adjacent ally to him instead.)\n\nThey got ready to fight as Cassandra informed them that \"I think there are still others in the village resisting... we should search the houses.\"\n\nAnna finished the pre-battle by informing everyone of the following: \"If it's true that the Geneseal main force is approaching, we'll have to move fast.  We can't stay long.\"  Thus, the battle had an 8 turn limit placed on it...\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEnough for now!  As per last time, if there's enough interest, I shall continue.\n\nQuote of the section: \nGares: \"Alright, here we go... these hands of ours shine with an awesome power!\"\n\nMatt: \"Their loud roar tells us to defeat evil!\"\n\nGares: \"And now, the ultimate technique of the School of Shining Heaven!\"\n\nMatt: \"The Revale Family Legacy!\"\n\nGares: \"SHINING!\"\n\nMatt: \"HEAVEN!\" \n\nBoth: \"STORM!\"",

        "text": "We had just finished our last mission and we're just beginning to go through the goodies we found along the way. Our boss tells us he has another mission that needs to be taken care of immediately and has an airship brought in for us.\n\nOur boss is a mob boss in Waterdeep. The gang split into two factions known as The Blades and The Griffins. The Blades were high ranking members of the local government. The Griffins were the kind of people who do back street deals and assassinations. Our boss was leader of The Griffins.\n\nHe wanted us to relocate because of the splitting of the gang. It wasn't safe in Waterdeep, The Blades controlled the government and we're trying to close in on The Griffins so they would have less competition. One of the spoils if war was a peagusus I inherited from a dead ally. My group loaded up the airship the boss sent while I acquainted my new friend. I rode my peagusus while the group rode on the airship.\n\nRight as we begin to leave one of the geniuses on the ship decides it's a wonderful time to try out the new bow he found in the pile of goodies. He let's the arrow fly and the DM just stairs at him. \"Did you really just do that? Which way are you facing?\" Right towards the city.. The DM pulls out the stats for the bow and shows that it was enchanted with fire. This flaming arrow flies off of a ship baring the symbol of The Griffins and hits fucking parliament. It sets the entire building on fire. Needless to say I got the fuck out of there because I knew what was coming next. Our airship was blown out of the air. Most of our players died on impact. Only 2 or 3 had items that saved their lives. The archer was one of them.\n\nI fly down to parliament where they threaten to kill me on the spot. I tell them I need to speak with who's in charge to clear the situation. Luckily she was there after escaping the burning building. I explain what I saw and how I know who is responsible. In exchange for a full pardon for myself I would turn in the one behind the attack. She agreed as long as I could do it in 24 hours.\n\nI almost flew my Pegasus to death trying to get to the rendezvous point as fast as I could. I looked for anyone I knew hoping to find any information on my party. I found the archer after a while of searching (he basically had a magic get out of jail free card and escaped the explosion). I told him I got him a a fair trial if he went along willingly. He handed over his weapons and went without any trouble, he was guilt ridden about what he'd done. I turned him in and not only was I forgiven but I bought the boss enough time to get out of Waterdeep and saved nearly the entire gang. I single handedly stopped a war and saved not only my party but the entire gang. Due to my actions I was given a major promotion and I'm the current leader of our party. Suck it paladin, you're MY bitch now.",

        "text": "In continuation from [last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5qx9gx/dd_deadzone_saga_part_1_ankheg_hag_penguin_and/) the party is comprised of a vengeful and evil hating paladin named Alastor, a Cat Folk rogue dubbed Miss Kitty, a trigger happy rogue named Daude, and a cuddly Pengin warlock named Flip-Flop. Their mission is to save the empire from the ever growing influence of the deadzone, and area of fog, undead, disease, and bad juju. Last time they fought stuff, found some magical trains, and went to bed, and Flip uses find familiar to get an owl buddy. \n\nUpon the break of dawn the party awakes to Daude unconscious and covered in a blue green rash. Deciding to be highly scientific in their attempts to diagnose and treat Daude, Kitty and Flip engage in some very inquisitive poking of the dying man with sticks. The rash bubbles and drips of puss, and Alastor being the good paladin he is, tries to use lay on hands, instead spreads the rash. \n\nDeciding that Daude was too far gone and that his loot is worth more than his life, Kitty decides to put him out of his misery and rolls a nat 20 killing him instantly, while her dagger dissolved from the pus and blood. The rest of the party accepting that he was dead anyways lets Kitty loot Daude, and burns the body before continuing on with their journey.\n\nA little ways further the some train tracks are discovered and we decide to follow in an attempt to reacquire the main plot. Alastor summons a very sickly warhorse, and the three remaining members somehow squeeze on top and ride until we encounter a bridge that is very much built for only trains. A rumbling noise can be heard in the distance and while Alastor and Kitty try to determine how to properly cross the river and bridge, Flip sends his owl friend to investigate the noise. After discovering a mound of moving metal, and some words with the party, it is established that a train is coming and that being in its way would end poorly.\n\nFlip being impatient, tries to swim across the river which he discovers is both deeper and moving faster than initially thought, just in time to escape death. This leads to a very bored penguin and a party still needing to cross the river. Waiting around almost an hour the train suddenly passes, splitting the fog, and with some perception checks the party ascertains that the figures on the train are not quite human, and waving wildly at the party. The party incapable of discerning what the figures were trying to say, waits for the train to pass and then crosses the narrow tracks to the other side.\n\nA little bit out from the bridge we encounter a train tunnel that has no sign of being used, and is covered in a strange furry substance that blocks its entrance. Seeing the obstruction Flip uses eldritch blast to create a small hole that quickly repairs itself in an unnerving manner. To get a better understanding of the land, Alastor and Flip investigate the maps from the station and Kitty notices that this tunnel is supposed to be closed and not in use.\n\nNoticing that there is a town on the other side of the tunnel, Flip decides to clear a path, and from a distance lights the furry mass on fire with create bonfire. The mass smolders, then starts burning and smoking, while simultaneously spreading a bluish, putty like substance in an area around the tunnel. The putty starts moving towards the hole and tries to seal it, and Flips owl is sent to find a way around.\n\nAs the party waits for the owl to find a new path, Flip decides to inspect the strange magic beads from the train station and to poke them with magic to learn more about them. After some rolls it is determined that they are some sort of magic fuel, for something, and with nothing better to do, Flip decides that finding out how to use the fuel would be beneficial.\n\nKnowing that unknown magic fuel thing going off near self and party would be a bad idea, Flip decides to find a unwitting test subject to discover the beads possible explosive properties. Seeing the still reforming mass of blue putty, Flip hurls the bead into the mass with a nat 20, and proceeds to blast it with eldritch blast. The bead starts to glow brightly, it starts making swirling patterns of light, and writing similar to that in the train station starts to erupt from the bead, and makes a huge 20ft tall wall or magic text on top of the blue putty mass.\n\nIntrigued by this Flip starts vigorously taking notes, and the entire party has to make some will saves. Alastor and Flip succeed, and Kitty fails by one point forcing her body to slowly move towards the mass and text. Alastor tries to stop her, and instead rips her shirt, he then tries to tackle her, and instead gets charmed by the swirling mass too, and Flip tries to cast ray of frost on the paladin and rogue to slow their 5ft per turn crawl to 0ft per turn. Instead a mass of red text intercepts the rays and dispels them.\n\nSeeing the strange reaction from the wall, Flip decides that he needs to take more notes and ignores his entranced party members slowly moving towards the wall of text. Kitty reaches the wall and succeeding on a will save, decides of her own volition, that poking the mass of putty covered in magic text is a good idea. She starts getting enveloped as soon as she makes contact. Alastor then places his hand on it and his arm starts getting enveloped too. \n\nThe block of text now double the size of what it was starts to envelop the trapped paladin and rogue with different colored text, and Flip decides to get closer and take even more notes. Alastor then suddenly regains control over himself and freaked out by his now very enveloped arm, pulls back suddenly with enough force to free himself, but not his arm. At this exact moment the owl familiar tells Flip there is another route, and deciding that the party needs to go that way, attempts to free then rogue. \n\nMiss kitty regaining her senses tries to pull her arm and now trapped leg out with help from the small penguin, but the attempt fails. At a loss for what to do, Flip calls upon his fiendish patron to provide some sort of help or insight.\n\nFor some background to get his warlock powers Flip accidentally found himself in hell and befriended a lawful evil balrog that took pity on him. Flip lovingly refers to him as Chuck.\n\nSo in this dire situation the penguin begins babbling incoherently in infernal, obtains glowing spectral horns and wings, and floats off the ground. All of this directly in front of the evil hating, divine sense spamming, lawful good paladin. Upon seeing the now visibly possessed penguin, Alastor attacks with his good sword, only to be stopped by a wall of energy summoned by Chuck.\n\nFlip engages in light conversation with his fiendish friend and is told that no application of fire magic would free Miss Kitty, and instead would not make her sorta crispy or even moderately crispy, but would in fact make her extremely crispy, as in a pile of ash.\n\nInstead a new plan is devised, using shillelagh Flip will hit the mass really hard with his staff, Alastor will begrudgingly hit it with his sword and radiant damage, and Chuck will hit it from the small opening to hell manifested on the other side of the wall. \n\nThe only noticeable effects from this combined strike were the wall turning a caramel color, Chuck screaming in pain and retreating to hell, Flip no longer looking possessed, and Alastor thinking he vanquished the demon back to whence he came. All of this is happening while Miss Kitty starts screaming and is finally fully enveloped by the mass.\n\nAs a last try on freeing her, the party  backs up, and Flip casts shatter causing the entire mass to warp and bend, along with the cat folk rogue, but ultimately to no effect. The sword used by Alastor, and Miss Kitty are enveloped, the mass turns black, and the mass and sword float away from the tunnel and are impaled into the ground.\n\nAlastor having enough of Flips antics stares him down in a battle of intimidation and takes away his bags of magic beads, only for the bags to float into the sky, start glowing, and for  thick fog to descend on the party. With nothing better to do Flip starts a fire and goes to bed, and the exhausted and one armed paladin decides to as well. Oh and Miss Kitty had to roll a new character, but not completely new...\n\n**TL:DR** Flip the penguin see some trains, plays with some magic beads and putty, and the paladin loses and arm while Miss Kitty gets eaten by the blob.",

        "text": "The setting: The beginning of a steampunk empire formed from three kingdoms. This empire is now falling apart due to a green fog that is spreading plague, undead, monsters, insanity, etc. Its bad.\n\nThe party is entering this fog to try and stop whatever is happening and is comprised of, a human rouge Daude, a very vengeful tiefling paladin named Alastor, and a cute and cuddly penguin warlock named Flip-Flop (me).\n\nSo the party starts walking towards the deadzone, and enters it hours before they were supposed to. We arrive at a town to rest and instead find the outer wall covered in growth, the guards are dead and a large mound of grass in the middle. We investigate, discover the soylent mound is made of people, and as we leave the buildings collapse and spew out noxious spores. Thinking the spores are a bad thing, Flip decides to burn them away, and instead incinerates the whole town.\n\nWe then engage with moss covered wolves, and find a giant magical train station that is very much NOT supposed to be where it currently is. As this is suspicious and Flip doesn't know what a train is, we decide to investigate. After some vigorous looting, the party collects some bags of wheat, maps of train routes, bags of magic beads, and statues of the empire founding demigods called the Oracles.\n\nDaude finds the platform of the train station and only the top half of a train, while Flip and Alastor investigate the flowing magic script covering the whole station. Some magic beads get spilt, and out of thin air a cat folk rogue falls from the nothingness. This rogue refuses to tell anyone anything including her name, and instead is dubbed Ears by the paladin (much to her displeasure), and Miss Kitty by the fluffy penguin.\n\nDirectly after joining the party, the station itself decides that we are a magic hazard and evicts us tens of kilometers into the unknown deadzone, near to a destroyed city. IOn this city the ground starts shaking, we retreat onto piles of rubble and a wild Ankheg appears and combat ensues. After a long battle the victorious party finds a loot room in the hole left from the beast, and the paladin decides to filet the giant ground swimming bug filled with acid, in an attempt to eat it. Meanwhile Miss Kitty tries to retrieve her dagger and barely misses getting filleted too. Because of his stupidity the Alastor takes some acid to the face and after some raiding of the loot room the party leaves.\n\nUpon walking in the vague direction of where we think we need to go a figure starts walking out of the fog. Flip being a happy penguin wants to talk to them with a smile on his face. Instead the Daude uses his bow and shoots it in the face. Turns out Daude saved me from a charisma check battle with a hag, and combat ensues.\n\nThe hag dies, it emits some weird spores which Daude decides to collect and breath in deeply, and the evil hating Alastor once again tries to filet it while Kitty tries to loot it. Barely escaping the paladins wrath again, Kitty get nothing and the hag is chopped and lit on fire. Flip uses presdigination and puts it out, Alastor determined to destroy all evil sets it on fire again. This back and forth continues until Flip is somehow convinced that the hag is somehow alive and casts eldritch blasts, exploding chunks of it into the stratosphere, and destroying the DM's plans to progress the plot.\n\nAfter a night of rest and a trek through a forest, and winged snake descends upon a desperately trying to hide party, everyone fails to hide due the beast being a Couatl and having innate abilities to find living things. The penguin being cuddly tries to have a nice conversation with it, the Paladin uses divine sense and discovers the normally lawful good creature is very much, almost, evil, meanwhile the cat does nothing, and the Daude wants to shoot it in the face. After some failed negotiations we fight it and after putting the cat into a downed state, and almost killing Daude and Alstor, the Couatl dies, and with its dying breath thanks us for freeing it from a life of possession from evil. The party then goes to bed and Flip decides he needs a birdy buddy and summons and owl to his side.\n\nThus the session ended with the party victorious over the evils of the deadzone, and the wheels of fate waiting to screw the party over next session.\n\nThe end of part 1.

Too socially inept to hire a cart, and not magical enough to teleport, we decided to walk there. Other travellers on the road stopped to stare at us, for we were\n\n&gt; Coldsteel the Berbarian, a muscular human, stripped to the waist, one arm around the neck of a massive, defeated-looking wolf\n\n&gt; BBW, a massive, defeated-looking wolf\n\n&gt; Blackstone Darkstone, a man whose stench of aftershave and urine could be caught on the wind for miles before he is seen, wearing a top hat and dark glasses. \n\n&gt; Razorblade Spiderblade, ???\n\n&gt; Lucifer Shadowthane, a half dark-elf half light-elf, distinctive for his mottled skin\n\n&gt; Lady Deathshroud, the world's most magical goth, holding in her arms a dog-headed green skinned abomination baby.\n\nWe entered the city unchallenged, and immediately tried to stop people to ask for directions. The cityfolk found us terrifying, and so the guards asked us to stop, and pointed out the tourist information booth. The guards were still watching us as we went to the booth and bought a map. Each of the gang had different priorities, and so we resolved to split up for the day and meet up that night.\n \nLucifer went to the library, where he learned about the masked vigilante Eviserrak whilst researching local history. Eviserrak had never been caught, and his trademark was a knife, which he left at every crime scene and which would later disappear from the Watch's evidence lockers. \n\nColdsteel and BBW took a scenic and largely uneventful tour around the cultural landmarks of Oringold.\n\nBlackstone and Razorblade wanted to know more about the wizard Ertai the Mad (he created all the dog abominations) and so booked a consult with a local necromancer, Dove Bant, by walking to her house and talking to one of her retainers through a locked door.\n\nLady Deathshroud needed food for her baby, and so tracked down a bitch that had just had puppies and paid for the doblin to be allowed to nurse. The spaniel was concerned at first, but Lady was able to ease the creature's discomfort by wrapping the doblin's humanoid body in a shawl to disguise it.\n\nBy the time we met up again, it was almost time for the consult with the necromancer, and the whole gang decided to come along. We were greeted at the door by her butler, a distinguished looking gentleman by the name of Gandian the Wight (It's a pun, works better verbally, just trust me on this one). Blackstone, having met him earlier that day, attempted to greet him with a hug, but the undead butler caught him by the wrist. The flesh on Blackstone's arms visibly greyed, and the butler advised him not to lay hands on the staff any further. \n\nAs we were paying customers, the necromancer's butler provided us with refreshments; vol-au-vents and miniature quiches, along with a bone of unknown provenance for BBW. Lucifer, with his fantastic double-elven metabolism, scarfed down handfuls of the snacks, and Coldsteel drank some mead. Blackstone was uncharacteristically quiet, prodding at the withered flesh of his arm, which left Razorblade to do the talking.\n\nDove the necromancer, whilst she was well preserved, was quite clearly dead.\n\nRazorblade asked her about Ertai the Mad. Dove had studied at the arcane college with him some several hundred years previously, before he was expelled for modifying other students. He had been trying to transmute students into slightly smarter versions of themselves, with mixed success. After his expulsion, he had struck out by himself, built his tower, and started producing dog monsters. When the dog thing had started getting out of hand, and dog abominations had started leaking into the surrounding countryside, an order of paladins had mobilized to cleanse the tower, and no-one had heard from Ertai since. Her story concluded, Dove asked if the party wanted anything else.\n\n\"You don't suppose you could fix this, could you?\" said Blackstone, holding up his withered arm.\n\nDove sucked in her breath through her teeth, a mannerism usually reserved for craftsmen such as plumbers. \"Yeah,\" she said. \"But it'll cost you.\"\n\nAnd that's how we ended up quite a bit poorer in the city of Oringold.\n\nOur funds much depleted, we decided that [a pub crawl was in order.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5rwmz0/dd_the_rbg_gang_and_the_messy_night_out/)\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "(Sorry for the long delay. This was a long chapter and I've been busy. The first half of the chapter is in this post, and the second half is in the comments due to length, so hopefully the length makes up for the delay! Much more is coming, and I should be back on schedule)\n\n*A handful of ripped pages, still barely glued together at the long edge, drift past. They could have come from anywhere, and represent the first object of interest in some time. Grabbing the paper, and reading it, the words appear to be in the common tongue of Kephrea. This should be impossible given the location, but there it is. The words form part of a story, and funnily enough, it’s a familiar one.*\n\n“He says there are blighted nyss ahead. No way to get to where they are. They’ll be over our heads.”\n\nTheir faces weren’t exactly hopeful, but then again they weren’t very cheerful for the last few days anyway. White sleet pounded against their jackets to the right, crunchy snow insulated their legs up to their knees. What little support the ground gave them was worth their lives, as the white wind concealed a drop of hundreds of feet unto teeth of ice and stone, starting fractions of feet beside them. They were almost literally blind, and if not for Fly Fang they’d be functionally blind as well. Luckily, as Ara’k-azur had reminded them, they wouldn’t be caught unawares if there was any danger ahead.\n\nUnfortunately, they now knew if danger was ahead.\n\n“I’d like to point out that I wanted to go by the Young Road,” lied Sillith. Nobody paid her any mind.\n\n“What’s the worst they can do?” asked Ulfbert. “Toss arrows and stones at us? We’ve dealt with that before. Let’s just try to move faster when we’re under them.”\n\n“I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but there’s not exactly a lot of room for ducking and dodging,” said Sillith. “And not all of us have your big armour.”\n\n“I didn’t hear you complaining when your magic protected you from a sword earlier.” Sillith was silent.\n\n“I’m the most endangered,” said Ara’k-azur. “And I agree with Ulfbert. We’ll be fine.”\n\n***\n\nFive people, three horses, and one great wolf tried their best to sneak under the cliff, at the edge of a perilous bluff. The wind masked them halfway through, but Furrio’s armour and large stature proved too much for part of the path, and the most dangerous step so far was made.\n\nStone fell long onto the perilous ground below. Furrio took too long to right himself, and began to descend. A rope went taught. Ulfbert pulled. Geldin pulled. Furrio slammed his fist into the mountain beside him, and grabbed the rope with his other hand. With grunts of effort, Furrio was pulled to safely, and steps forward.\n\nAn arrow flew down to the place he was just standing. They all looked up, and saw a distinct dark face against the white sky. They’d been spotted. The figure leaned over the edge to take another shot, and flew over the edge to its death. Fly Fang’s bark of triumph was heard, and he blinked away. It wasn’t enough; more arrows flew down shortly, as more archers showed themselves.\n\n“Go! Go! Go!” Ulfbert ignited his armour, burning the rope tied around his waist, and melting the snow in front of him. The others followed with efficiency and care, but not speed. Ara’k-azur felt an arrow sink into his back, and let out a yell. He kept on moving, pushing the short-legged Geldin ahead of him.\n\nAnother nyss fell over the side. A third archer turned around to see an undead spider where his friend had just been. The remaining nyss opened fire on the spider, tearing it to pieces. When they turned their heads back down below, their prey had escaped. They went back to their cave where they’d made camp. No use chasing prey that has a head start and an advantage on the terrain.\n\n***\n\nIt was nearly as cold on the other side of the mountain path, but in these occasions, words like “nearly” are of the greatest value. Ulfbert had taken off his scorched parka; the armour kept him more or less warm.\n\nAlong their path, four figures had set up camp, including a dark-skinned figure kneeling down and doing something with a small gold-furred dog. As the party approached, an Ogrun in thick armour came up to meet them. “Hi!” he said, “I’m Ogrun!”\n\n“Hello, friend, I’m Orcish. You can call me Ara’k-azur. What’s your name?”\n\nThe Ogrun looked confused. “I said. I’m Ogrun.”\n\n“Your name... is Ogrun?”\n\n“Ogrun’s name is Ogrun.”\n\nAra’k-azur had nothing to add to this tautology. “You look for the blight vault?” Ogrun asked.\n\n“The what?”\n\n“Oh, if you don’t know the blight vault in the north, Elsa says not to tell you.”\n\nFurrio moved forward. “Oh, that one. Of course we know.”\n\n“Oh, good! If you don’t know, I’m not supposed to say about the blight vault in the northern mountains, and the charm whelps that won’t go there, and how Elsa-”\n\n“What’re you talking about?” asked a human in thick white and gold robes, with long golden hair just as thick.\n\n“We’re blighthunters,” said Furrio, no longer sure to what degree that was a lie. “My name is Furrio, like the cereal.^1 What news of the vault?”\n\nAmanda chuckled. “I’m Amanda. None that I can think of. Our leader, Elsa, thinks it’s in the North, but just like everyone else, we can’t get the charm whelps to go near there to help us out. Without the charm sense, we really don’t know how it’s possible to find it.”\n\n“And of course those contents of the vault will never be yours otherwise.”\n\n“Right.”\n\n“And that’s sad, because all any of us want is an end to the blight.”\n\n“Exactly! All any of us want is to see Haen’s light restored! We’re all on the same team! But nobody wants to work together because everyone thinks there are limited weapons. But they don’t do any good sitting in the vault unused.”\n\nFurrio nodded, satisfied, as the dark-skinned one came over. She was a drow.^2 Her sharp voice cut into Amanda, “now what are we talking about *here*, Amy?”\n\n“Nothing, Elsa, just the vault.”\n\n“Okay, what did you learn?”\n\n\n“Nothing, these travellers seem to be in the same position as we.”\n\nElsa looked suspiciously at the party. “Where’s the blight vault?”\n\nSillith spoke up. “Why should we tell an unarmed nyss?”\n\nElsa spat. “Drow to you. A mage like yourself should be able to think of a few reasons, and none of them would come close. Anyway, that wasn’t a threat, though it’s odd that you’d read it that way.”\n\nSillith rolled her eyes, and took her parka off. “Watch this,” she whispered to Geldin next to her as she dismounted. She walked right up to Elsa, and locked eyes. “I’ll arm wrestle you for all the information we have.”\n\n“Why on earth would I arm wrestle with a brute like yourself?”\n\n“Fair enough,” said Sillith, who had removed some of her armour on her right arm, “I could probably lift you.” She flexed, showing off a pretty shocking physique for an elfish magic user.\n\nElsa began to sweat. “W- well I know nothing about that.” She looked around frantically. “You have no charm whelp! Just how were you expecting to get to the vault?”\n\nSantabane brought Ara’k-azur to the dog by Elsa’s side. “I could ask you how you were going to get there treating Patrick this way.”\n\n“The charm whelp doesn’t have a name,” said Elsa.\n\n“Sure he does. His name’s Patrick. I could tell.”\n\nElsa drew her eyes into slits. “You can communicate with the whelp, then? It seems that we can help each other.”\n\n“We get friends!?” said Ogrun, excitedly.\n\n“One moment,” said Furrio. The party huddled, and consulted a map. Powerful weapons in a vault, not that far out of the way to Haensland (they were still near the mountains, and Haensland was to the Northwest anyway). It was worth checking out, and Sillith seemed to have a handle on the drow. “Alright, we’re in.”\n\n“Yay!” said Ogrun.\n\n“Very good,” said Elsa. “Orc, talk to my whelp and see if you can’t get it to move. I’ll get our things in order.”\n\n***\n\n“Funny how these towns are full of humans, but we’re the only two in this group, hey?” said Ulfbert to the other party’s human duellist, Derik. “Other than Amanda, but she’s a bit ‘praise Haen’, you know?”\n\n“I come from a long line of warriors,” said Derik. “We watched as our people failed to fend for themselves in large groups, as these beastfolk and wilders made out just fine. We wouldn’t have it. We are the most elite of all orders of soldiers, the Darke bloodline runs strong like a mighty river through a soft countryside. We have vowed to carve our own destiny into the land, and-”\n\n“Never mind,” said Ulfbert. After a few minutes, “Derik Darke, though? You’ve never thought that was a bit silly?”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“Well, you said earlier that your family was killed by monsters, and you swore to get vengeance.”\n\n“That’s right.”\n\n“But you also have this vow you inherited from your ancestors to carve your own destiny.”\n\n“Of course.”\n\n“I’m just surprised you’re not the last of your kind of something like that.”\n\n“But I am the lone scion of the Darke line.”\n\n“Of course.” said Ulfbert.\n\n“I’m sorry I’m not a 50 year old blacksmith, then, alright?” spat Derik, and he went to ride off more or less alone, away from the others.\n“‘E w’s fun,” said Geldin.\n\nUlfbert shrugged. “I like him better than the nyss.”\n\n***\n\n*Although Elsa and Sillith had a fairly long conversation which hints somewhat at Elsa’s upcoming actions, Elsa is an altogether minor character, so it is the translator’s opinion that the entire conversation is best omitted in the interest of good taste. It’s possible that Elsa was a character of some other story and was therefore thought worthy of this much exposition. Another theory is that one bard from whose account this volume is collected was a drow, and therefore wanted to focus on Elsa’s motivations, rather than have her appear arbitrarily evil. This theory doesn’t quite work, however, as these fairly explicit passages do anything but paint her in a good light. Finally, based on the level of violence throughout the text, which was toned down considerably for this translation, it’s possible that this gratuitous conversation was included largely for its own sake.*\n\n***\n\n“Patrick won’t go any further,” said Ara’k-azur. “So I’ve let him go. He’ll be no more use to you, and now roams free.”\n\n“You idiot!” spat Elsa. “We’ll need him later to track down the blight! You owe us 70 gold for a new one.”\n\n“I don’t,” asserted Ara’k-azur.\n\n“And how do you expect to find the vault if we’re not going to force it closer?”\n\n“Patrick is he, not it,” said Ara’k-azur. “And we’ll find the vault with this.” He pointed to his own nose. “Your “charm whelps” have purely mundane smell. I’ve borrowed Patrick’s. I need only switch on the smell, like s- OH!” Ara’k-azur hit the ground, and started gagging. After a minute of this, he stood up. “That is the worst smell that has ever existed. Blight is even more evil than Ki’ir-e’kann cooking.”^3\n\n“Do you know which way to go?” asked Elsa.\n\n“Yeah. But I think I’ll switch off the smell until we’re closer.”\n\nOgrun raised his hand. “Why dog is gone?”\n\n***\n\nAra’k-azur suffered greatly on the road to the vault. His screams could be heard for some distance around, and it is a small wonder that they drew no attention, given how many hunters thought themselves so close to the vault. Eventually, they found the entrance.\n\nAt the bottom of a steep ravine, which can be rappelled into without too much difficulty, there was a large flat stone surface jutting just above the uneven ground. A spiralling pattern was carved into the stone, making two lines simultaneously going out from the center, where a semi-orb of marble sat. The tiny trenches caused by the carving make their way to two great doors carved into the side of the mountain right beside this circle. Words are written in ancient Orkish above the door.\n\n“I know some of those words,” said Ara’k-azur. “That one means opposite. And that one means attract. Opposites attract, I guess?”\n\n“It’s an inverted statement,” said Sillith, the aspiring bard. “Its meaning would probably be closer to ‘attract the opposite’. I don’t know any ancient Orkish, but I can tell about the structure from the endings.”\n\n“Attract the opposite?” said Derik. “Well, the opposite of us is the blight, because we want to destroy it. Perhaps we should put some blight on the orb there.”\n\n“And I suppose you carry a blighted nyss around with you?”\n\n“The Darke bloodline are proud hunters, and we always claim a trophy from our kills. This severred ear once belonged to a general of the Blight’s forces, until that brave day on the Ides of last spring, when the fields of battle-”\n\n“I’m very glad you have a blighted ear, but I don’t need you talk mine off too,” said Ulfbert, as he snatched the ear from Derik’s hand, and placed it on the marble orb. Before Derik could come back, the ear disintegrated, and the orb lit up in bright blue. On the left, the trench, where it ended at the orb, filled with blue light, and on the right, the other one did the same, slightly darker. As they spread out, the spiral which started on the lift become gradually green, then yellow, then a pale golden colour, as its opposite grew purple, and dark, but still shining. They got to the doors, and soon both doors were completely alight. Then, they were drained of all light at once, and slid swiftly into the ground. The way forward was unobstructed.\n\n“Well, you’ve certainly been helpful in getting us here with this party of yours, Sillith,” said Elsa, “so I’ll give you an offer this one time. Join us, and we’ll spare you. Your friends are doomed already I’m afraid.”\n\n“I don’t get it,” said Sillith.\n\n“Are you betraying us?” asked Furrio.\n\nElsa rolled her eyes. “I can hardly call it betrayal when a real person does away with some light-skinned and light-brained tools of hers. You’ve all got me this far, but now you’d get in the way. Derik, Amy, and Ogrun are a hand-picked elite strike force, and they won’t work properly with you four stumbling all over the place.”\n\n“No, that doesn’t make sense. It’s a dungeon of some sort, right? These things are littered with traps. If you really want us to die, just make us walk forward and trip them. What you’re doing literally just doesn’t make sense. Also you have no weapons, and you said I don’t even know how many times that you don’t use magic. *And* our party outnumbers yours.”\n\n“Not if Sillith joins me! Sillith, what say you?”\n\n“I’m also confused,” said Amanda. “We’re good guys, and they’re good guys, so we’re obviously not going to kill them, so what are you saying?”\n\n“Seriously, Elsa, you don’t want to fight my friends,” said Sillith, “they’re not just fun to be around, they’re safe to be around too. I watched them kill an entire small army of blighted nyss before it could even invade a town once.”\n\n“Really?” said Elsa. “Well, if I’m being truthful, a change of scenery would be nice. Very well, you all work under me now. As for you three,” she walked up to Derik and placed a hand on his forehead, “consider your services terminated.”\n\nDerik started screaming, and blood dripped out of his ears. He fell to the ground, and clutched his temples. Furrio acted in a flash, and charged right for Elsa. Elsa dodged even before Furrio swung, and then jumped over Furrio’s improvised kick, landing near Amanda. “Good night Amy,” she said, and did the same thing to her that she did to Derik.\n\nSillith started to circle around, and a red bolt flew from Elsa’s chest, nearly hitting Ogrun, but being blocked by Ulfbert’s shield. Ulfbert moved forward to try to hit Elsa, but she predicted his movements as well. Ara’k-azur shot arrows at her swiftly, but he movements were insane, always placing her where she needed to be. “There is no need to resist,” she said, “I’m on your side now. The trash will be dealt with shortly.”\n\nFurrio charged again, and this time cut deeply into her shoulder with his sword. Ulfbert bashed her with his shield, and she fell backwards. Ara’k-azur tried to finish her with his handaxe, but she moved swiftly out of the way. “That hurt!” she said. “I’m finished with you all!” She drew white light out of her skull and into her hands, and just as she was about to thrust it out at everyone gathered, Ara’k-azur launched an arrow right between her eyes. The light faded away, and Derik and Amanda stopped struggling.\n\nFurrio ran to Amanda. “Are you alright?”\n\n“Yes,” she said, “but that was really painful. I’ll need to rest in order to fully recover, but I’m fine right now.”\n\n“I’m totally good to go,” said Derik. “Nobody can mess with me.”\n\n“But,” said Ogrun, “why is Elsa dead?”\n\n“She betrayed you, Ogrun,” said Furrio.\n\n“But, usually she doesn’t become dead when she does that.”\n\nNobody had anything to say to that. They discussed their options briefly, tossed Elsa’s corpse off to the side, and entered the dungeon without waiting another moment.\n\n***\n\nThe first room was massive, with a ceiling so high it couldn’t be seen, and a floor patterned in a [taijitu](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Esoteric_Taijitu.svg/1024px-Esoteric_Taijitu.svg.png), with the circle on the right emitting a pale purple light, and the one on the left glowing bright yellow. Each circle spawned indistinct sparkling entities, which flew around the room blasting each other with yellow or blue beams of light. They didn’t seem to notice the eight adventurers in the doorway, which could just as likely be a good thing as a bad. Furrio bolted for the stairs going up on the left, ignoring the stairs going down on the right, and everyone followed. Dodging the beams of light was impossible, they could only predict where they’d be fired, and this was hard with all the sprites (as Furrio called them) flying around the room. Derik, still a little dazed from Elsa’s actions, dodged into one, killing him at once. The others made it safely to the staircase, and climbed quickly, to escape the clearly deadly lights.\n\nThey walked up the many stairs in silence, until Ogrun spoke up. “Wait. Why is Derik gone?”\n\n“He’s dead, Ogrun,” said Amanda.\n\n“Oh. Wait, why is Derik dead?”\n\n“It’s Elsa’s fault,” said Amanda.\n\n“Oh. Ogrun hopes Elsa doesn’t find out, but Ogrun is almost glad she’s dead.”\n\n“Haen would never forgive me if I said the same,” said Amanda, “so for that reason alone I won’t.” She smiled guiltily.\n\n***\n\nThe seven made it to a room at the top of the stairs, lit up in a soothing yellow light, whose source was unknown. The walls were lined with empty bookshelves, and many books littered the ground. On the roof, some distance above, there was a largeish square slightly lighter than the stone around it, surrounded by white runes written in a circle.\n\n“Can anyone read that?” asked Sillith.\n\n“Not right now,” said Furrio.\n\nAmanda looked at him. “And what would let you? Hearing the language?”\n\nFurrio appeared to match her gaze from behind his vizor. “I doubt it. But this place probably has a solution or key somewhere. Maybe we can decode it.”\n\n“Oh, sorry, I misunderstood” said Amanda. “That makes sense.”\n\n“Dawn Quick’s Oat” said Sillith. “Does that mean anything to any of you?”^4\n\n“No,” said Ulfbert. “Does William Tell?”\n\n“Does William tell whom what?” asked Amanda.\n\n“No, it’s what this book’s spine says. There’s nothing written on the pages.”\n\n“This one says Kantavery Tales. This is all nonsense.”\n\n“Look at the floor,” said Sillith. “In front of us, there’s an arrow pointing at the middle bookshelf with an image of parchment and a quill. To our right is an arrow with an apple picture on it, and the apple’s got an arrow through it. To our left is an arrow with a shield carved on it.”\n\n“We c’n see,” said Geldin, “why’d ye ‘splain tha’?”\n\n“I don’t know,” said Sillith. She took her book, and placed it on the bookshelf to the left. It moved forward and then to the side, revealing a sort of metallic smooth hallway sloping upwards. Furrion moved to try to walk up this hallway, and as soon as he put weight down on the foot he’d placed in the hallway, he fell right forward, and banged into the ground, sliding back into the first room. \n\n“Alright, forget that,” he said. Try the other shelves. They tried placing random books in the two shelves, and when the book Ulfbert picked up was placed on the right bookshelf, it moved to the side, revealing a hallway with lettered tiles on the ground and holes in the wall. When the book entitled “Kantavery Tales” was placed on the shelf opposite the entrance, it too moved aside, revealing a bridge made of books suspended above a seemingly bottomless pit. On the other side was a rather ordinary looking door.\n\n“Well, this deathtrap looks the least dangerous,” said Furrio, “Ogrun, why don’t you try stepping on some of those tiles.”\n\n“Ogrun is good at stepping on trap tiles!” said Ogrun. He got through the first row, but at the second, arrows flew from either wall, and injured Ogrun. He stepped back and the arrows stopped. Through trial and error, they figured out that stepping on a tile which had a letter contained in the word “apple” was safe, and all got across, with Ogrun only needing to deal with a few arrows in him.\n\nOn the other side, they walked into a smaller square room of stone. The far wall and wall to the left each had a hole in them, and a few broken twigs littered the floor. Like before, there are two arrows scrawled into the floor, one pointing forward with an image of a bow, another pointing left with a picture of a tree. “Hey Ara’k-azur, try firing an arrow into that whole,” said Sillith.\n\nAra’k-azur launched an arrow into the hole, and it made a clicking noise. Part of the wall sunk into the ground, revealing another room. This one had another bottomless pit and no floor, and seemed to go on forever in all directions. There was a platform far away with a pedestal on it, tethered to the room they were in by a thin string. The string was taut, and didn’t break with any amount of stress they dared to put on it. It didn’t take long to resolve to send Fly Fang to the platform, grabbing whatever’s on the pedestal, and coming back. When he returned, Fly Fang had something golden and curved in his mouth. It looked like a bow, but it couldn’t be bent in either direction, so it wouldn’t work at all if strung. What’s more, other than the string connecting the platforms, which they failed to remove, there was nothing to string it with.\n\n“Maybe this is one of those weapons,” said Ara’k-azur. “I can use bows, I might as well hang on to it.”\n\nThey looked at the left wall. Ulfbert picked up one of the twigs from the ground, and pushed it as far as it would go into the wall. It stopped, so he forced it further. This caused another click, and part of the wall opened into another hallway. This one didn’t have a floor right where one would expect, but a ways down there was a bit of standing water. At their level, there were thick green vines covering the walls, and some stretched across between the walls, almost forming a sort of floor, but they didn’t look strong enough to tread on. In the middle, at the bottom, the water was pouring away into some abyss, and though it didn’t seem to be flowing back in, it didn’t seem to be getting lower either.\n\nGeldin tried climbing across on the vines, but they moved away from his grasp, so they gave up and went back to the main room.\n\nThe party sent Ogrun to try to walk on the book bridge, but he refused outright to step so that he was above the books’ spines. Furrio tried, and agreed that such a thing, although it looked easy, was impossible. When Ogrun tried to walk on one side of the spines, the bridge tipped in that direction, and he had to run back. When Ogrun and Furrio walked on either side of the spines, it seemed balanced, although Furrio’s armour was much heavier, and they managed to get to the end. The door was already open, but when they got there, it was covered in complete darkness. Some darkness even spilled out onto the bridge, as light might into a dark hallway. They saw no way to enter the room safely without vision, so they went back.\n\n“Well,” said Geldin. “I see n’ way forw’rd here. Le’s go down?”\n\nThey agreed, and started to descend.\n\n***\n\n“Well it was scary is all I’m saying.”\n\n“I really don’t care, Samph, you need to keep it down.”\n\n“Those guys are probably dead. They even killed their leader themselves, we watched.”\n\n“There were eight of them, that’s twice as many as we have. If you’re so confident they’re dead, we shouldn’t be here.”\n\n“Seven,” said Natus.\n\nThe others looked at the man. He insisted on wearing nothing but a cloth, and his body was covered in tattoos. This and his wild hair told half the man’s story. The look in his mismatched grey and green eyes told the rest.\n\n“No,” said Medynn, the party’s dwarven priestess of Enn. “I’m pretty sure there were eight.”\n\n“There was a corpse in the last room. One of theirs. He’d been in pain, too.”\n\nSamph, the goblin ranger, said, “Neth’s backside, Nat, why do I need to know if he was in pain? I’m having second thoughts about this whole dungeon. Why do we care about the blight again?”\n\n“We wouldn’t have got here if we couldn’t handle it,” said Medynn. “That’s how this stuff works. And besides, who ever heard of two parties running into each other in a dungeon.”\n\n“It’s a bit more likely if you follow people to a dungeon,” said Kris, a gunslinger. \n\n“Still, what’re we going to do, run into them and have a fight on the stairs?”\n\n“For someone with such a keen sense of story, you should really know better than to say stuff like that. Might as well ask what the worst that could happen is.”\n\nSillith’s voice shocked the four adventurers. They now stared up at the other group, in the thin staircase. “Hi,” said Medynn. “This is awkward. How are you folks doing?”\n\n“You followed us?” asked Ulfbert.\n\n“Uh, yeah. Sorry.”\n\n“Well, look, we’re all civil, why don’t we just all go past.”\n\n“No!” said Samph. “Don’t go down there! There’s all these blighted monstrosities, worse than anything I’ve ever seen before. You need to avoid that for sure.”\n\n“So we’re all just going up?” asked Sillith. “That’s kind of weird, eleven people trying to crawl a dungeon.”\n\n“I see where this is going,” said Natus. He stretched, and huge glowing red claws appeared on either hand. He blinked behind Amanda, and tore at her neck. Her protective aura and life were gone before the blood stained the stairs.\n\nFurrio wasted no time. He smashed Samph’s skull with the flat of his sword, burning the flesh where the blow connected. Ulfbert and Geldin climbed back, and made a protective line against Natus. Ulfbert stabbed with his halberd, but it just glanced off his skin as if he were wearing thick armour.\n\nMedynn was screaming in an ancient tongue, and green runes appeared all around her. With eyes glowing green, Kris drew two massive guns with four barrels each, and opened fire. Bullets flew at Furrio and Sillith, but there was no effect. Sillith cut off Kris’ left hand, and magically bled him hard from the wound. \n\nAra’k-azur turned to Natus, and pierced his mind with his own willpower. Natus was caught off guard, and Ara’k-azur succeeded in what he was trying to do. He blinked behind Medynn, and jammed his axe into her skull. Kris’ eyes lost their glow, and he fell to the ground. Natus saw this, and blinked out of sight.\n\nGeldin leaned down and looked at Amanda’s injuries.\n\n“Is Amanda dead?” asked Ogrun.\n\n“I’m afra’ so.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Frekken greedeh bligh’hunters. Wha’ a waste.”\n\n“I don’t know about you,” said Ulfbert, “but downstairs didn’t sound fun to me. Let’s see if we can figure out that metal slide.”\n\n“I think I have an idea,” said Ara’k-azur, and he teleported further up the stairs.\n\n***\n\nHaving teleported into the room above, Ara’k-azur tossed a rope back down the hallway. The slippery metal surface made it impossible to grip anything else, but pulling themselves up on the rope proved a relatively simple task for the adventurers.\n\nThis new room was square, like the one opposite it. The ground had small pieces of leather strewn about, and onto the floor were scrawled two arrows, one pointing right and the other forward. The one looking forward has an anvil on it, and on the right a picture of a metal bar of some sort. The pointed-to walls had shields mounted on them, facing the walls. Four slots were cut into the shields. After some discussion, trial and error, the leather fit into two of the slots firmly, allowing them to pull on the shields, revealing a door behind each. \n\n“It’s branching,” said Ulfbert. “I hate it when dungeons branch. They take forever.”\n\n***\n\nFurrio walked softly on the glass floor, watching the fire try to lick at him. The cloak they’d found two rooms ago protected him from the heat, but he was still having second thoughts about electing to walk on the glass with this much armour on. Finally, he opened the door at the other end, to see two rather thin cloaked figures standing next to a puzzle box of some kind. They turned to him, and the room was instantly filled with an opaque darkness. “Oh, the darkness from earlier,” said Furrio. “I get it now. The solution is to attack it!”\n\nAra’k-azur blinked to Furrio’s side, and the two charged into the room, blindly swinging their weapons. Furrio heard a dagger clank against his back, and he spun around, swinging his sword. The darkness dissipated, revealing a fresh corpse. Ara’k-azur grabbed the other by his neck and flung him into the glass hallway behind. The floor held strong, but so did the heat. Ara’k-azur closed the door, and held it shut.\n\n“You’re going to need to take this cloak back across so the others can get through without burning alive,” said Furrio.\n\n“Give that guy some time first. I want to see if he tries to cross through the middle.”\n\nThe screams a minute later told them he had.\n\n***\n\nFurrio cupped his hands in the ink pooled on the ground, and flung some onto the ceiling. It happened, apparently at random, to spell out the word “bless”. He repeated this exercise a few more times, always to the same effect. “Bless?” he said, aloud.\n\nThe golden arc they’d picked up before clicked.\n\n***\n\n“Jus’ abou’ done wit’ th’ parchm’nt theme,” said Geldin, looking at the papery hallway in front of them. Veins of ink moved snakily around the walls, floor, and ceiling. \n\n“Well, after you, Ogrun,” said Furrio.\n\n“That’s not fair,” said Ulfbert, “we can’t just send Ogrun in first every time.”\n\n“Is okay,” said Ogrun, “that’s what Ogrun is for.”\n\nOgrun took one step confidently into the hallway, and the parchment floor ripped under his weight. He grabbed at more, but it just ripped more and more, until he fell into a bottomless pit below.\n\nThe party watched as ink filled the hole Ogrun had created, and Furrio silently tossed a single coin onto the inky filling. It held strong as steel. They soon found that this could support someone’s weight, and tore through the floor to create a path through.\n\n“We shall all be thankful for Ogrun’s sacrifice,” said Ara’k-azur.\n\n“I officially am never going first,” said Sillith.\n\n***\n\nFurrio put the monocle to his eye, and looked at the ceiling. “Yep, I can read it now. They’re instructions.” He put the monocle down. “Give me the bow.” Ara’k-azur handed him the golden arc. Furrio, still wearing the cloak, poured some of the seeds they’d found into a slit in the arc, and aimed it like a bow at the square in the ceiling. “Bless,” he said.\n\nAn arrow of light shot from the golden bow right into the square in the ceiling, and the square descended on a rope. Bright light poured in from the room above, and the adventurers climbed up.\n\n“Well that took forever,” said Ulfbert.\n\n“Yeah, I’m going to be writing down this part of our story for months,” said Sillith. “I might just skip half the dungeon.”\n\n***\n\nSillith climbed into the room, behind all the others, and looked around. Everything seemed to be made of gold. Treasure chests lined the walls, and majestic weapons were hung above them. Lying still directly in front of them, and taking up most of the massive hall, was a long, white-furred dog-beast with countless legs. It stirred, rose gently above the ground, and looked down at the party.\n\n“Welcome, folk from this realm. I am the Charm Avatar, and this is my lair. You have passed my many intellectual challenges, and I present myself to you now, one last physical challenge. I know not why you seek to harm beings of Charm, and I mean to stop you.” Bright light flared out from his nostrils, and steam rose from his mouth. “Prepare to die!”\n\n“Wait!” called Sillith. “What do you mean harm beings of charm? We’re here for the blight weapons. Aren’t these they?”\n\nThe light from the Avatar’s nostrils died down. “Wait,” he said, “you’re not here for the charm arsenal?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Then why’d you come up here? All the blight stuff is downstairs. Didn’t you encounter some ancient tome explaining the Vault of Opposites or something?”\n\n“No, we sort of followed some other party here. They’re, uh, all dead now.”\n\n“Oh. Well, that’s some tough luck. Sorry you wasted all that time getting through here. Hey, you get to keep that golden bow, though, that’s pretty sweet.”\n\nThe party exchanged exasperated glances. “So how do we get to the blight weapons?”\n\n“Well, the Blight Avatar is a bit less sophisticated. You’ll have to go downstairs, fight through a hallway full of blighted horrors, and then face the Avatar in all of its awesome glory. Then everyone gets to take one weapon or treasure.”\n\n“What if I take more than one?”\n\n“They both explode. It’s pretty deadly. Definitely don’t do that.” The Charm Avatar smiled. “Master’s Gray Eyes, I’ve not had a good chat in as long as I’ve existed! You folks are alright.”\n\n“Thanks Charm Avatar,” said Sillith, “you’re pretty alright too. And not just for a dungeon boss.”\n\nThe party hung out and chatted and stuff for another twenty minutes, and then went to the hall below.\n\n***\n\n^1 it’s unclear to me why Furrio says that here. I can’t imagine to what within Kephrea he’s referring.\n\n^2 it’s important to understand the drow/nyss difference. A thousand years earlier, everyone would call a dark-skinned white-haired member of the Fair Folk a Drow. Drow didn’t travel much, so not much was known about them. Some few hundred years prior to this story, there was an attack by a large number of blighted drow on a town in northern Munida, and the marauders were called “nyss” for lack of a better word; that many drow had never been seen in one place, and they’d never acted like that, so they couldn’t be drow. By now, it’s understood that drow and nyss are the same, but “nyss” still carries connotations of blight, and is not considered a very nice word when referring to an unblighted person. The text may be implying that Elsa is not blighted by referring to her as a drow; contemporary readers would certainly assume she was blighted if she’d been called “nyss.”\n\n^3 apparently an opposing clan of Ara’k-azur’s, I couldn’t find anything about the Ki’ir-e’kann or their cooking. It seems that the alienness of this reference as we experience it was meant to be evoked here, so a footnote is hardly even necessary. Sorry.\n\n^4 this was a pretty weird section to translate. As I have it, Sillith appears to be trying to say Don Quixote, but remember of course that she wouldn’t have been speaking english or reading latin letters. Regardless, sounding out the syllables she says, it sounds exactly as I’ve written it. I’d want to call it a coincidence, but then there’s the pun on William Tell with Amanda misunderstanding. The name is common, and different from William, but I’ve inferred it from the next paragraph, the presence of Don Quixote, and the equivalent of their word for “tell.” “Kantavery” is presented as a single comprehensible word with the same pronunciation, and “tales” is their word for tales. I googled “kantavery tales,” and Canterbury Tales came up, so if you like you can choose to believe that’s what was written on the book’s cover. In any case, no book exists called “William Tell,” despite the popular folk character with the same name appearing in numerous stories, so I might’ve made a mistake there. Of course, from the age of the paper this volume was written on, I’m left unsure whether it would be weirder for these titles to be so similar to english-language stories apparently written after this one, or for the books names to happen to sound like stories we’d recognize.",

Pronouns are schler and schlee.\n\n&gt;Lucifer Shadowthane. Half light elf half dark elf, and possibly the world's greatest stealth archer.\n\nWe'll begin [where we left off last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5qgtz0/dd_the_rbg_gang_and_the_king_of_the_forest/). Coldsteel began to nurse BBW back to health after having beaten him mostly to death, and the others went into town to spend their reward money. For some reason, Razorblade, who had scored the actual killing blow, had decided to tell anyone who would listen that slaying the King of the Forest was Coldsteel's doing, and was drinking out on the story.\n\nIn the shady part of town, next to a shady entrance to a shady alley, Razorblade found a man with a market stall full of eggs. Razorblade asked what the eggs were, the man explained that these were monster eggs. The creations of a wizard known as Ertai the Mad, these eggs would hatch into dog-hybrid monsters, such as [dogsnakes](http://0.media.collegehumor.cvcdn.com/20/47/199f86016b79a1718281050ae672ac96-dog-snake-is-sneaky.jpg), doggogriffs, dorcs, doblins and maybe even a dogon. Razorblade bought a clutch of three eggs before turning invisible and hiding beneath the man's stall, and Lady Deathshroud, feeling awkward at being left behind, bought one too. The salesman promised to incubate the eggs, and deliver the creatures once they were hatched. He also warned against cross-breeding, as this could create uncontrollable hybrids, including the terrifying throwbacks known only as dog-dogs.\n\nBlackstone bought a daschund puppy from a local breeder, hoping one day to be able to create a daschund cerebus by crossbreeding the abominations, and satisfied with the day's shopping, the gang retired to the top floor of the local inn.\n\nRazorblade woke to a knock at schler door, and opened it to find a small covered basket had been left there. Opening the basket, schlee discovered three newly hatched dogsnakes; creatures with the brightly coloured bodies of venomous snakes and the heads of spaniel puppies.\nExcited, Razorblade went to fetch the rest of the party, leaving the basket of dogsnakes open on schler bed.\n\nWhen the party returned, the basket was empty and there were screams from downstairs.\nRealising that the baby dogsnakes had escaped and were now loose in the inn, the party began to panic.\n\nBlackstone checked the dumb waiter. He stuck his head inside, startling the baby dogsnake that had curled up on the platform. He attempted to grab the little creature, but for a newborn, the dogsnake was a surprisingly skilled combatant, and it wound itself round Blackstone's neck, biting him in the eye.\n\nLucifer attempted to shoot the dogsnake attached to Blackstone's eye, but instead shot Blackstone in the hand. Blackstone began to scream and curse, promising vengeance. Razorblade, sensing that things were turning sour, turned invisible and jumped out a window. Desperate, Blackstone used his psionic powers to subdue the poor creature.\n\nLady Deathshroud spent the rest of the evening crawling around in the attic of the inn with a plate of sausages from the kitchen, but they were having none of it. In the end, Lucifer acted as spotter and Blackstone (whose ocular puissance was somewhat impaired)  used his powers to levitate the dogsnakes down into the basket.\n\nThe party brought the dogsnake pups to Coldsteel for training. BBW was suspicious of the little abominations at first, but grew to accept them.\n\nIt was several days later when the salesman invited Lady Deathshroud to the hatching of the final egg. This was a Doblin, he explained, a dog-goblin hybrid, and Lady would have to be present for the birth in order for it to imprint properly.\n\nHe took her to the heated shed behind his cottage that he was using as a hatchery, and they were let in by a dog-headed orc. The cottage itself had darkened windows, though barking could be heard from inside, and green smoke poured from one of the chimneys.\n\nInside the shed was a high trough filled with straw, in which lay a mottled egg little larger than an ostrich egg. No sooner had Lady stepped through the door when it began to crack. The salesman urged her forward, to be the first to greet the creature. She did, and took it in her arms when it had struggled out of the shell, wrapping it in a blanket.\n\nThe abomination looked up at Lady, the fur on its face still slick from the inside of the egg, and spoke its first word.\n\n\"Mama?\"\n\n[Next adventure](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5qx0nu/dd_the_rbg_gang_and_the_scary_necromancer_lady/)\n",

        "text": "Setting: The continent of Nexaa.  Home to numerous countries.  In the northwest, the esteemed Summer Rose Kingdom, a nation made primarily of Nephilim (from Anima.)  In the north, the Empire of Dominus (from a Final Fantasy homebrew we played.)  In the west, Bavannia, a nation of some technological advancement (a different Final Fantasy setting.)  The southwest holds the land of Faeris, a land of magic and elves (a d&amp;d 4th edition setting.)  The direct south of the continent holds the land of Charheim, a nation of valorous warriors (from a third, different Final Fantasy setting.)  In the center of the continent, the Abel Empire (from Anima.)  And in the east, dominating most of the continent, the great Geneseal Empire (unique to this game.)  The nations have maintained an uneasy peace, with everyone paying tribute in some way to Geneseal in order to keep them at bay.\n\nOur story begins with two soon-to-be-heroes.  A dragon-rider (cavalier-class, mounted on a flier, using Dark Paladin as the class template) named Lorelei Le Doux and her mount Emirys, and a thief named Ellisandra Morgenstern (using Thief as the class template.)  The two were chosen by Abel High Command for a stealth mission over the Geneseal border.  Apparently, one of the Abel recon units had sent a distressing message, and contact had been lost.  Lorelei and Ellisandra's mission was simple: cross the border into Geneseal, locate the missing unit, and hopefully bring them home.\n\nSo the two departed for the border, heading for the last known location of the recon unit.  A few days after crossing (a bloodless affair, thanks to Ellisandra's stealth,) they found a wrecked caravan that was crawling with Geneseal soldiers.  The caravan bore the markings of Abel, and the two of them knew that if something wasn't done, it would give Geneseal a political excuse to go to war.\n\nLorelei drew her axe, and Ellisandra her sword, and they charged in.  The geneseal soldiers were completely unprepared for an assault, but they found themselves up against an opponent they weren't ready for - a Geneseal Knight.  Heavily armored and armed, able to inflict massive damage with a single strike to either of them.\n\nIt was then that a survivor revealed herself - a young human girl crawled out from under the ruined caravan and drew a strange looking sword known as a \"Killing Edge.\"  Holding it with a practiced stance, she joined the fray, and the massive damage that she was able to inflict allowed them to overwhelm the knight's defense.  \n\n\"Who are you?\" Lorelei was curious.  It wasn't often that girls of 15 or 16 were used by the Abel army, but she carried the seal of Empress Elisabetta Barbados, marking her as not only a soldier, but a girl of some importance.\n\n\"I'm Anna.  Anna Never.  I think I'm the one you were sent here to find.  And I'm glad you did, because we need to destroy this wreckage, burn the bodies, and get moving.  I was part of an operation to locate a weapon that would give us the power to defeat Geneseal; the ultimate weapon.  And we found it.  I have it in my possession, and that's all I'll say for now.  Get me back to Abel, and we stand a chance of freeing ourselves from the oppression of our damned overlords.\"\n\n\"Are you the only survivor?\"  Ellisandra, always the curious type, and definitely the brains of the two.  The three worked together to pile the corpses into the caravan before igniting it.\n\n\"It's very possible.  There weren't many of us, and some tried to draw the rest of them away.  I pray to C'iel that they are safe, but we cannot wait for them.\"  With that, Anna Never joined their group. (Lord, using the Warrior class, but with vastly improved stat growths.)\n\nHowever, their return would be greatly delayed.  As they reached the border, they observed that it had been closed and heavily reinforced.  \"Damn... a report must have gone out regarding the caravan.\"  Anna looked utterly distressed by this.  \"We're going to have to go around... there's a port town to the north.  It's several days away, but if we can get there, we can catch a ride across the inner sea back to Abel territory.\"\n\nThe three began their trip, and their first waylay took place when they passed a village that was being harassed by Geneseal soldiers.  As they observed from a distance, and saw the citizens being tormented, there was a noise in the underbrush near them.  \"Lady Anna!\"  The voice was that of a woman... in fact, two of them, both mounted upon fine steeds, emerged.  \"We've been looking for you!\"\n\nAnna seemed delighted to see the two of them.  \"Lorelei, Ellisandra, allow me to introduce you to two of my escorts.\"  The first woman rode forward, wearing hefty armor, carrying a spear, and a shield.  \"I'm Ciara Territh, guardian to Lady Anna.\" (Cavalier, using Paladin as a class template.)  The second was a fierce-looking woman holding a massive greatsword.  Her steed was a little larger, more wild-looking.  \"And I'm Rhea Maxime.\"  (Cavalier, using Dark Paladin.)\n\nThe reunion was happy.  Rhea and Ciara had managed to elude, circle back around on, and ambush their pursuers, and they'd been looking for Anna for a couple of days.  After finding the burnt caravan, they followed the tracks that the three had left.  With the addition of Rhea and Ciara, Anna decided that they couldn't just stand by and let the Geneseal soldiers take what they wanted from this village any more.\n\nThe group charged into battle, and they were a little bit shocked when Rhea recognized one of their opponents - a 8'4\" Jayan Nephilim that seemed to be made of pure muscle named Claust.  He wore no armor, and held no weapon, but they saw from the way Claust threw a soldier that annoyed him that he needed no weapon.  (Claust is a Tao, specializing in Muay Thai, Tae Kwon Do, and eventually Pankration.)\n\nNevertheless, they charged in, and Rhea told them to let her try and talk to Claust.  So she got close, and the following exchange took place.\n\nRhea: \"Hey! Idiot!\" \n\nClaust: \"WHO YOU... Rhea? What are you doing here?\"\n\nR:  \"What are YOU doing here?\"\n\nC:  \"Well, I mean, I'm here to fight. You know? Why are you fighting with these chumps?\"\n\nRhea sighed and clapped her hand to her face.\n\nR: \"Claust. Look around. Dead Geneseal everywhere. No dead us. Tell me who the chumps are.\"\n\nClaust took a look around, started counting on his fingertips, and then pulled off one shoe to finish on his toes.\n\nC: \"Son of a bitch.\"\n\nR: \"So, you gonna stick with them and keep being a chump?  Or are you gonna come with us?\"\n\nC: \"I AIN'T NO CHUMP!\"\n\nAnd with that, Claust, the mightiest man on Nexaa, joined them.  He turned around and promptly kicked a Geneseal soldier so hard that he may have attained orbit (it was a very large critical hit.)  \n\nAs they continued through the village, they learned that there was apparently a man in the church who offered aid to people who needed it.  First Claust came to the door, knocking on it.  The voice inside asked if he believed in righteousness, and Claust answered that he believed in strength.  The voice stopped responding.\n\nIt was Ciara that got an answer.  \"Do you believe in God, my child?\"  \"I fight in the name of the holy seven.  I am a knight, ordained by C'iel to protect the weak and defend the hurt.\"  With that answer, the door unlocked and opened.  There was a priest inside, and he asked if they were there to help.  When Ciara said yes, he agreed to aid them.  \"I'm Dante Durand.\"  (Wizard, specializing in Light Magic; however, due to a 'Code of Conduct' disadvantage, Dante cannot take any hostile actions whatsoever.)  Dante joined up, and his healing magic proved to be a valuable asset as they finished clearing the village.\n\nThe grateful villagers provided them with food and a refresh on their supplies, resetting their healing supplies to full use.  Anna looked at a map of the region.  \"There's two ways we can go.  There's a mountain path to the north that's usually riddled with bandits, but it's the most direct way.  Or we can take the long way around, but it'll take longer... this isn't just my call.  I'll value everyone's opinion.\"  \n\nBy consensus between Lorelei and Ellisandra, the decision was made to cross the mountain pass.  Dante packed his things, leaving the village in the hands of his apprentice in the church (\"I believe that this is my calling, these people have come, and I must go with them,\") and the seven of them set off for the north mountains.\n\nThey began to cross the pass, unaware they were being watched...\n\n\n________________________________________\n\nI'll leave off for there for now.  If it's an entertaining read, I'll gladly post more!\n\nQuote of the session: Claust - \"Alright, chump.  I got two fists, two feet, and you've only got one head.  This math ain't gonna work out for you.\"",

Claims to be the world's greatest stealth archer, and is upset when people haven't heard of him.\n\n&gt;Razorblade Spiderblade. Human ninja of ambiguous gender.

Massive goth, really likes dogs and writing poetry.\n\n&gt;Blackstone Darkstone. Human psion, despite the fact that psionics don't really exist in this world. Spent his childhood in wizard school, bullied for his inability to use arcane magic, and now hates all arcanists. He wears a lot of leather, which he tans himself (ineptly), and so he is followed by a constant stench of rotting hides and stale urine, which he attempts to cover with aftershave.\n\n\nThe party had a secret base just out of town, in an abandoned temple of Gruumsh we had raided. (What can I say? The rent was cheap, and it had an ooze in the basement we used for waste disposal. We called him Mr Poopy.)\n\nWe were in town ordering furniture for the base when we heard that merchants and travellers on the roads were being killed by a creature known as \"The King of the Forest\". Fearing for the safety of our imported furniture and wall-hangings, we set out to slay this beast.\n\nLucifer and Coldsteel tracked a set of large pawprints through the woods, and we came across an extremely large wolf in a clearing full of human remains.\n\nWe fought the wolf (I won't bore you with the details), and Coldsteel decided to keep him as a pet, so he begged a little healing magic from Lady Deathshroud to stabilise him, bound his wounds and tied him to a makeshift sled. Coldsteel christened him Big Bad Wolf, or BBW for short.\n\nMeanwhile, the party searched the clearing, and found that although there were gnawed bones and skulls in the clearing, there was no armour or anything in value, and there were also humanoid tracks leading away. The real King of the Forest was trying to frame BBW for his crimes.\n\nWe set off following the new tracks, Coldsteel dragging BBW on the sled behind him. Although Coldsteel was very strong, dragging a cart-horse sized wolf through thick undergrowth was very tiring, and the party set down to rest after only a few hours.\n\nWith Coldsteel exhausted, Lucifer decided to scout ahead. He was crawling though the undergrowth when he stumbled upon an enemy sentry, a small goblinoid creature. After a brief standoff, he asked the creature if it had heard of him, Lucifer Shadowthane. The creature responded that yes, he had, and Lucifer realised that he felt an uncanny kinship with him, and boasted of the strengths and dispositions of his companions. (Why yes, he *was* supernaturally charmed, how could you tell?) The encounter ended with Lucifer's new friend promising to bring trade goods and a nice breakfast if he'll just tell him where the party's camp is.\n\nThe first the party learns of this is on Lucifer's return, when he bursts out of the bushes and excitedly announces that the goblins are going to bring them pastries. The party panic, shake Coldsteel awake, and ready themselves for the inevitable night attack.\n\nMy favourite bit of this whole scenario is the look of utter heartbreak on Lucifer's face when the goblin werewolves (barghests) emerge from the trees, armed with the equipment from the caravan guards they have killed, and he realizes they aren't bringing pastries, *and they never were.*\n\nAfter a close fight, we put the head of the largest barghest in a bag and go back to town for a reward, making Lucifer promise never to go off by himself again.\n\nJoin the gang in their next adventure: [The RBG Gang and the Monster Egg Salesman](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5qqii4/dd_the_rbg_gang_and_the_monster_egg_salesman/)",

        "text": "Hey, all.  So one of my great hobbies is trying to figure out how to adapt games to make other games work.  Well, with a lot of effort, I managed to convert Anima: Beyond Fantasy into a grid-based tactics game that bears a very strong resemblance to a hybrid between Fire Emblem and Super Robot Wars.\n\nIf there's interest, I'll share the adventures that two of my friends are having with it right now, as they're playing through it using roll20.net so that way we have an actual grid and character sprites.  The concept for it is one I came up with that I called Project: R-Zone, named after Namco/Capcom's Project: X-Zone.  Basically, I realized that after literally years of dice gaming, we had upwards of 80-something characters laying around.  So I crafted a universe that all of them exist in, wrote a story, and got things rolling.\n\nFor the record, one of my two players knows all of these characters, as she was present for several of the games and a longtime player of mine.  The other one is actually brand new to them, so she has the outsider perspective, and she swears that it's still working, and it's one of the best games she's ever played.\n\nSo if there's interest, I'll share the story of Nexaa, of Lorelei Le Doux and Ellisandra Morgenstern, and their war against the Grand Empire of Geneseal.  It's a VERY LONG STORY, with a very large cast, but hopefully someone's interested!",

        "text": "This was early in a campaign with new characters.  We have just spent the past session navigating a cave system that was full of traps and pitfalls.  We are on our way out when we stumble into a passageway described as long and narrow, with a roughly hewn wooden door at the end.\n\nThe cleric immediately checks if the door is a mimic.  He has a dire mimic fear.  It's not.\n\nSo our rogue approaches and decides to attempt to pick the lock, only to find that there's no keyhole.  Obviously this sparks discussion, as to what the secret to the seal of this door could be.\n\nWe variously check for traps and tricks, wards, spells and portals, only to find none we can detect in our low levels.  Finally our fighter bashes the door with an axe in frustration.  He rolls a one, but still leaves a sizable dent in the door.  Obviously this means physical trauma can affect the door.\n\nWe start plotting for how to harm the door.  Recently, we had found the schematics for what amounted to a bomb.  Obviously, this door was put here to have a physical test of the bomb.  But, we lacked some components, and generally were low on supplies.  Substitutions and schemes later, we have what we hope to be a working bomb, but have used up most of our supplies.  But, to escape it was worthy it.  We plant it by the door and run to a safe distance.\n\nFor the past five minutes, the DM has had a look on his face like he is ready to die laughing. But, he describes our makeshift bomb as working, blowing the door to smithereens, nothing but splinters left behind.  By this point, the DM is having trouble laughing as he describes us going through the opening and emerging to the basement of a meadery.  The bomb has damaged several casks and the meadery owner is rushing down the stairs, looking horrified.\n\nThough the meadery owner, the DM explains what was so funny.  The door was just a door, not locked or sealed.  We just had to open it normally.  No idea why we all assumed it was sealed somehow or a trick.  So how could we have opened it?  Turn the handle, the DM says.  He hadn't thought it out too far before we started fighting a normal, unlocked cellar door to his amusement.\n\nSo...Any gold earned in the cave exploration ends up going to help the meadery owner recoup his losses, and our party makes numerous apologies as we slink off into the night.",

        "text": "So a while back I posted about Jack the Necromancer who over the course of two seasons of a forum role play managed to piss off almost every player, killed the sage/mentor of the heroes, switched sides, betrayed the villain by killing one of his top generals, fused his soul with a demon, created a death god, separated his soul from the demon, and set up a nice timeshare in hell on the lavafront. Great property by the way, waking up every day to the screams of the damned. \n\n\nPicturesque.\n\n\nSo the GM has started a new season after five years and all the old players are back. By this time I had left the forum, didn't have the time. But I'd check back everynow and then to see what people were doing. \n\n\nI see the new season get posted and privately message the GM. She approves my request to rejoin the game but under the condition that my death god gets the cosmic equivalent of the shaft. \n\n\nI agree, it was a poorly thought out decision to create that guy anyway. \n\n\nLastly I negotiated that she doesn't announce my joining of the game. To the other players I am a new user and posting unannounced in the IC is very much against the rules. Technically I wasn't breaking the rules but only the GM knew that.\n\n\nSo I post a saved post which prevents other players posting out of respect automatically. They have to wait for GM decision on this cheeky newcomer and then they need a mod to delete the post. In the mean time I post a video link to a Kelly Clarkson Song: \"Stronger(what doesn't kill you..)\"\n\n\nThe post slowly begins to form with the first bit describing someone with a rasping voice starting to sing:\n\n\n*What doesn't kill you....*\n\n\nPlayers are getting annoyed now because it's been a day already and the GM hasn't done anything despite getting slammed with private messages. As I finish, Jask has finished the song and the returning players have finally picked up on it. One of them happened to be a mod and immediately perma-banned me. Took me a week to get back in but the GM was forced to take control of my character. I left her alone though she made Jask a Wild Card Villain. I believe he would have wanted that.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The party arrives in the largest city in the world.  New sights and sounds abound.  People of every shape and color wander the streets.  The adventurers, weary from their last adventure, take a few days of much-needed R&amp;R.  One of them decides to take a test to become a God, unfortunately taking all the group's hard-earned loot with them and leaving the rest of the group quite destitute.\n\nThe party Cleric, after spending a few days in quiet prayer to his God of Healing and Redemption, casts Divination to ask, \"How can I serve your wishes?\"\n\nThe response comes, clear as day: \"Go to the Adventurer's Guild.\"\n\nThe party, lacking any other demands on their time, goes along for the ride.\n\nUpon arrival at the Guild hall, they see a rather long line of adventurers waiting to get in.  The adventurers seem to be of all strengths, from the low-end to extremely powerful.  To a person, though, they are all waiting patiently in line.\n\nThe party gets in line as well, patiently waiting until at last the bouncer signals that it's their turn.  Entering the hall, it is extremely richly furnished; everything is ornate and gilded.  \"Excessive\" doesn't even begin to describe it.  Another bouncer directs them towards the only open door out of many.\n\nThis door leads to an office.  Most of it is brightly lit, but the back of the room is draped in shadows. It has two occupants: a human sitting at a desk, and a large figure holding many scrolls and writing standing back in the shadows.\n\nThe human speaks, telling the party about the adventurer's guild.  How they match up Adventurers with CR-appropriate encounters and provide the support network that every Adventurers group needs. \n\nIn the meantime, the large shadowy figure in the back keeps writing on its scrolls.  No one in the party is all that concerned with it, instead asking the human more questions; for example, what contracts are available and how much money.  You know, the nitty gritty of joining the guild.\n\nThe offer comes up: they kill an APL+4 creature, get 250,000 GP (as a party).  Immediately, the bolt ace and monk offer to sign.  The shadowy figure produces two contracts, each longer than the characters are tall.  The characters attempt to make heads or tails of the contract but are unable to; the legalese is mind-numbing and none of them are all that proficient at reading.  It's right there in big letters at the top though: Kill the creature, get the money.  They sign without further question.\n\nThe Paladin considered himself the leader of this party, and is not very bright regardless - so, seeing his party members sign the contract, immediately signs.  The cleric is not far behind.\n\n-------\n\nNot one of them attempted to get a better look at the large shadowy figure even once.  And that's the story how I accidentally got both a good Cleric and Paladin to Fall in the same game session without wanting them to.",

        "text": "I'm playing in a two person campaign with some friends which had been going on for a few months of meeting every other week. The party consisting of me, a dragonborn Monk/glass cannon and my friend the elf Rogue. Through a series of hyjinks we ended up in a Dwarven Fortress, but I somehow lost my character sheet for my Monk and had to roll up someone new. I decided to play a magic class since I always tend to gravitate towards either straight melee classes or the general meme of being a Bard.\n\nI rolled up a level 3 warlock with stats that shouldn't be. 18 STR, 17 DEX, 17 CON, 16 INT, 17 WIS and 20 CHA. This was of course, after applying the racial bonuses of the Aasimar. Warlocks cast based on Charisma and I had higher base stats than anything the Rogue had, so it was a bit unbalanced.\n\nAfter managing to convince the nobles of the fortress that I am an emissary of the gods sent to retrieve a book that we had been asked by the steward of the king to get, we gave it to him only to find that we had been tricked. Now enraged and thoroughly insane (the DM wanted something to balance out the slight brokenness in my character, so I made him prone to fits of utter madness), I proceeded to enthral a good number of the guards and lead them against this noble. Of course, fighting half of the city's guards was a bad plan, and enthral can only last so long, so inevitably I was captured and placed in jail with no possible escape until my trial.\n\nSo I started praying. My character had no backstory in this game. Not because I was lazy, but because he couldn't remember anything other than the fact that he came into contact with a Great Old One (later found out to be Cthulhu) before being forced into a contract and becoming a warlock. One prayer a day for 3 weeks later and I land a natural 20. I black out and nothing happens. \n\nAbout an hour passes, and the whole fortress starts shaking. Being dwarves in a mountain fortress, the residents are quite ready for earthquakes and go to designated  shelters to wait it out, but it never stops and keeps getting stronger. Eventually, both my character and the Rogue wake up in the pile of rubble that was the Fortress. No survivors other than us, and no clue of what happened. A whole mountain range along with the Fortress levelled.\n\nAfter this spectacular feat of accidental genocide, I ask one question:\n\nMe: How much XP did I get from that?\n\nDM: applypalmliberallytoface.exe\n\nTL;DR: I screwed up, tried to pray my way out and killed thousands of people.",

        "author": "DivineEternal1",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5pl40h/another_commoner_curse_of_300_wands/",
        "text": "After reading the [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDGreentext/comments/56owc3/the_commoner_curse_of_300_wands/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) by u/Draz825 I convinced my forever DM to run a one shot using all the same resources and setting. Our test subjects were: Holme Bagge the halfling twelve year old son of a merchant, his two npc guards a female halfling named Mella and male human named Phileon, my character an Elf carpenter with pet fox named Celegild, and Thelcha a half-orc town guard with a bad sense of direction, as well as another human that was modeled after the peasant named Dennis in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  \n\nThis story starts exactly the same way as the other with a dorf asking for help testing wands with a 1000 gold per person reward. He offers to test the wand and shoots a nearby bird flying by. DM rolls for effect. Nearest forest starts on fire. Obviously the peasants are outraged and the merchant is hauled away for magical arson. Now with an untended cart filled with mysterious wands our intrepid group of adventurers decided they still want a shot at 1k gp each and so decide to take the cart away from the village to the river with my character driving. Before we leave we manage to fire off a few shots. Most either did nothing interesting or anything noticeable, though we later found out Thelcha accidentally killed they mayor (the player rolled to see if he hit what he was aiming for) and his daughter was put into a permanent magical sleep a la Sleeping Beauty. At this point only Thelcha and Dennis are testing the wands as Holme is writing down which effects the wands have, I am driving, and the guards guard Holme. Nothing interesting happens other than us shooting animals fleeing the burning woods, until Dennis suddenly falls unconscious. As he was walking beside the cart I stop so he can be put in the back. While waiting I shoot an animal. The DM asks me to roll a con check. I roll low. DM says \"All your blood instantly coagulates. You are dead.\" I was bummed but as no one was playing Holme's guards I was still in the game, however it was not long after Celegild's death that the party notices a familiar orphan named Anya has been following them and they can see that she had stolen some wands at some point. The party is unsure of what to do with Anya but she eventually catches up when she uses the four wands she had stolen and wants more.  \n By the time the party reaches the river Dennis has woken up, and gained troglodyte breath, there are four statues of Thelcha in the road, and the carriage has an igloo in the back. Upon stopping Anya takes as many wands as she can carry, which turns out to be fourteen, and stands on top of the igloo to get a better view as there are no more animals fleeing from the forest. Over a small hill she spots a group of knolls watching the forest burning in horror. Anya decides that they would be great targets and dual wields two wands to make sure her target dies. Anya kills her target, I roll for effect. Anya starts glowing and moments later a freaking balor appears next to the knoll's body. The knolls are terrified and some bow to the balor while others flee. The balor ignores them, shoves the dead knoll into his sack and leaves. Anya isn't too sure what just happened but it was interesting and didn't want to give the wands back to the boring people she is with. So she runs for it.  \nDennis, who saw what happened with the knolls, is not amused by Anya trying to run away with a wand that summons a balor and shoots Anya. Player rolls for effect. All target's stats become 18 and no damage is done. Anya now has all 18 stats. Anya also knows that Dennis just tried to kill her. Anya spins around and shoots Dennis, with the same wands she shot the knoll with. Dennis dies and not much later the balor reappears. As the balor begins to loot Dennis' body Anya comes to a conclusion. The wand had perfected her, she was stronger, faster, smarter, and had never felt healthier. The balor was about to take this wand. She knew that if the balor took it then the things he could do with it would be unspeakable. She couldn't let him take it.  \nAnya put away the wands she was using in hopes an untested one has an effect that will kill it. Anya backs away from the balor and dual wields two new wands. Silence one mile radius and Anya's stats now rearrange every hour(DM bummed because all Anya's stats are the same). Balor, who had been ignoring us now looks up and is extremely irritated. Thelcha duel wield attacks the balor. Balor's blood is now invisible and cryptic scrawls appear on foliage w/in sixty feet. Balor kills Thelcha and then the nearest guard. Holme grabs a wand he knows is safe, four statues are created by nearest female in their likeness. Holme grovels in front of balor and pledges allegiance. Balor tells him to kill the remaining guard. Anya shoots balor again. Anya is now a vegetarian and the balor's house is now filled with marshmallows. Balor is now extremely pissed at Anya and now wants to take her back with him to torture. Holme kills remaining guard whom is hiding in the igloo and praying fervently. Balor, who has been suppressing his fire aura the whole encounter btw, grabs Anya. Anya resists enough to still be able to use her hands. Anya grabs four wands and breaks them, rather killing herself then be taken.  \nWands explode in wild magic maelstrom. All nearby would becomes alive, target's left arm becomes a demonic claw, next twenty pounds of food target touches turns into stone, and something that must not have been interesting because I forgot what it was. DM also says the magic blast makes the forest fire permanent as it was created by magic, the wands in the cart fuse not only into each other but the wagon and the igloo, as well as Dennis' and Phileon's bodies as they were in the cart which creates a twenty nine hit dice golem. The DM also ruled that all the wands have turned into staves and their effects doubled.\nThe DM rolls low on damage and Anya survives the explosion with three out of nine hp left. As a bonus it also knocks Anya away from the balor who is now staring down a golem. The balor with a bigger threat in view begins attacking the golem, while Anya retreats to the river and Holme, whom barely escaped taking damage but not effects of the explosion, and grabs the balor's bag that has the wand of perfection. This was a fight the balor will never forget. Every attack the golem made had a random magic effect. First the balor's whip is disintegrated, followed by the hand that was holding his sword fell off at the wrist, finished with his sword disappearing and his severed hand taking on its qualities.  \nMeanwhile Holme had used the now staff of perfection on himself gaining twenty in all stats, and his demon claw reverting to his normal arm, with perhaps other bonuses my DM still refuses to tell me about if any. Anya had been plinking away at the balor and was now afraid of forests(they might be filled with treants) and thinks she is poisoned.   \nIt is now that the balor is at low hp and wants to make a getaway. He cannot because of the one mile silence spell still in effect. When Holme sees that his new master is about to be defeated he shoots him. Anya now has four animated statues of her likeness around her and are moving to protect her. The balor is defeated and explodes. Anya and Holme are far enough away to avoid the explosion. The golem barely survives and jumps into the river to extinguish itself as it had started on fire.  \nThe golem had the memories of both Dennis and the guard Holme killed as it had absorbed their bodies. It wasn't happy with Anya but because she had acted to Dennis trying to kill her he had no plans on doing any harm to her. The twelve year old halfling that had betrayed the party and murdered his own guard? He was evil and a murder.  \nHolme sensed that the golem was going to attack him so the golem didn't get a surprise round, though it was still faster to attack. Target begins to think they are the subject of their worship, take no damage. Holme makes his save. Anya saw how easily Holme betrayed his companions and was willing to murder so she decided to side with the golem. Now that the wands were staves she could no longer dual wield. Sixty feet around caster turns to glass ten feet deep. Holme survives damage. Holme attacks golem. Golem is at extremely low health and Holme does enough damage to kill it. Golem explodes and turns the river into dwarven ale, permanently. Anya is dropped to zero hp and begins to float down river. Holme thinks she died in explosion and leaves area. Anya rescued by animated statues but is now drunk from dwarven ale. Later rescued by soon to be drunk dorf sorcerer who takes me back to dorf city. Drunkenly make bets with other dorf in the city that there is an actual river of dwarven ale. Anya is scary as an angry drunk, scare dorf into making journey to river. Sell shiny clothes to be used light source for miners. DM ruled that after the exp from the fight we are now level 10. Anya is now protean sorcerer and Holme is a priest to his new demon master Abubu.\n",

        "text": "I'll keep it as brief as I can because I'm not so great at storytelling, and I don't know if anyone wants to hear a complete retelling of my the campaign so far. All you need to know is that I'm inexperienced, I was directionless, and I made a lot of mistakes in my first session as a result. \n\nAlso, I'm two sessions into the campaign, in which I am the only player (just me and the DM), playing a villainous duo who have been tasked with corrupting and/or invading some nearby towns in order to pave the way for our monstrous master.\n\n- I loot a farm, then realise that I need to cover my tracks, so I burn it to the ground.\n\n(Also, during the looting, I had an epic battle with a farm cat where the only attack rolls made - both from my characters and from the cat - were nat 20 crits. That cat was our very shortlived arch nemesis.)\n\n- I realise that, since some of the loot is metal, they're going to find out it wasn't an accidental fire.\n\n- I kidnap a random villager from a nearby village, and attempt to make it look like he's been 'caught' by an unknown vigilante hero, by knocking him unconscious, tying him up, and leaving him with an incriminating note by the side of the road.\n\n- I then realise that I've just dug my hole ever deeper - as soon as the villager wakes up, he'll blab to the guards and let everyone know who the real culprits were (and, as a Tiefling and a Dragonborn in a land of mainly humans and dwarves, it's hard to be inconspicuous).\n\n- I need to think up a plan, fast, before the villager can gain consciousness - infiltrating the tower might be hard, especially as I'd need to assassinate him and then get out without raising a single guard's eyebrow.\n\nNeither of us are great at organising to meet up, so about 5 months go by without another session. I'm just as hopeless at planning in-game, too - I still have no clue what I'll do... but inspiration strikes when I look back over my character sheet to refresh my memories of the campaign.\n\n- One of my characters is a Rogue/Sorcerer who specialises in deception and trickery. There are several ways to play this, but the hole I've dug myself is pretty deep already, and none of my ideas seem both guaranteed to work and guaranteed not to lead into a bigger mess further down the road.\n\n- I notice she's also proficient in Forgery Tools (well, actually, 'Fogery Tools' since I'd made a typo on the character sheet). I have a eureka moment, and decide that she'll forge a document from the lord of the town, demanding that the prisoner be put to death immediately.\n\n- I talk to some of the townsfolk, too, and it turns out that everyone feels pretty negatively about the lord - taxes are far too high, he's always out of town, and he spends far too much on the town's security.\n\n- The DM gives me a hint - death sentences are usually reserved for more serious crimes than thievery and arson. I relent, and change the document instead to order his tongue to be cut out - and forge a second document, a wanted poster that implies that the villager had personally insulted the lord.\n\n- I cast Alter Self to disguise myself as a courier, and am very convincing to the guard to whom I hand the documents. He goes inside  for half an hour, and when he returns, he has a slightly damp, bloody package for me.\n\n- The DM then tells me about DND's rumour system, and suggests I try it out. Over the next few days, I successfully plant a rumour that the windmill burning was an inside job by the lord, and the villager was his scapegoat.\n\nSo, to sum it up, I used the fire as a cover for the theft, then I used the villager to cover up the fire, but then changed tactic and am now using the rumour that the lord is using the villager to cover up the fire, itself, to cover up the kidnapping that I used to cover up the fire to cover up the theft.\n\n\nI'm not sure if I've managed to climb out of the hole that I dug for myself, so much as dug it so deep that it came out the other side of the material plane.",

        "text": "This is a tale of three characters in a game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Highschool, joined my sophomore(?) year, having played D&amp;D all of once before plus a few PC games. I’m handed a character that a previous player had made, but I didn’t know this was actually a kinda bad thing to do so I went with it. Renamed, revised. He’s a sorcerer. His name is Jim Picard-Spock. Me and the others, Cleric the Cool, Rogue the Fuck Off, Fighter the Why Are You Here, and Bard the Your Diplomacy Is WHAT?! meet up with Beric, the DMNPC. We get on a boat and go to a dead continent after Beric beats the shit out of some guys called the Wordless. They’re assholes with no mouths, servants of the New Gods, Pelear and shit. DM’s got a pantheon of old school Gods he’s cooked up. This matters later for two reasons.\nSo after we get to the dead continent, DM approaches me. “Hey, you’re pretty good at RP, and I have this Cool Idea: I want you to be a doppelganger plant from the Big Bad.” Naturally I agree to this. It sounds cool.\n\nThrough the last couple of games my character has been relatively irreverent. Now, though, I’m a bad guy. I resolve to be as irreverent as possible. This goes very, very well. Only the rogue is suspicious of me. This is in large part because when I play, I get into it. I’ve cozied up to the bard, and by the time we hit the desert continent I’ve almost convinced him to actually break with the party. This is good news. I even get him to approach the DM with me so we can discuss the mechanics of that. DM is fuckin ecstatic after that. In the process, however, I have actually severely damaged the relationships that players have with each other. Rogue player is on edge because he thinks everyone is against him, and Cleric and Bard and I are kinda tag teaming the shit out of his arguments and plans.\n\nLater, we go to a place on the desert continent. We find a mask of true seeing. This is capital B Bad. My hiding relies on not being seen by that shit. So I resolve to be the person who wears the mask all the time. This will be difficult, because my arguments for being that guy are going to come off to a bunch of other teenagers as pretty much just being a dick. Teenagers are dumb. Stuff happens, blah blah blah. I have to miss a game, so I say it’s okay if another player who’s trying out the game plays my character.\n\nBad decision. She has to hide that my character’s a doppelganger. We get into a fight with someone who uses an invisibility spell to attack us from hiding. Because she doesn’t know that magic missile hits every time, she lets everyone else use the mask while she hides under the sand like a little bitch, simultaneously clueing everyone in that something’s up. If I would have been there, I would never have allowed this, instead telling everyone to surround me and have them continuously swing in front of them while I track the guy and hit him with some pancake stacks from the center of the formation.\n\nSo of course, late one night, when I’m feeling like I’m about to be discovered, I break the mask and throw the pieces into the desert. I am discovered anyway. I’ve been hatching a plan to kill the Big Bad and take his power, so I’m okay with them at least knowing I’m a doppelganger. Now I can use them to fuel my plot. Thing is, I’m also feeling like this character is coming to a close, arcwise. After we call up the Big Bad for me to make a “report,” we go to the Valley of Life, where the Old Gods live. Valiar, King of the Old Gods, is really, really pissed for some reason. I say something rather rude because he’s being a bitch and not giving us what we need to accomplish the mission that he basically gave us his blessing to carry out, and he picks up the floor and crushes me. Jim Picard-Spock is no more.\n\nMy next character is somewhat darker. He also lasted a good deal longer, making up the bulk of my time playing at this game.\n\nAfter leaving the Valley of Life, the party is teleporting to somewhere on the only continent that isn’t total shit, but magic bad stuff happens and they end up in the middle of the Jarl Wastes or whatever. Basically, it’s a magical dead zone. Enter Torgnan the Half-Orc Barbarian. As a player, I think it’s always good for a character to have a Big Secret. Torgnan’s is more fucked up than most I’ve encountered. He joined a caravan crossing the wastes. They stopped in Shitsville, Nowhere where he got drunk (he has a bad habit) and sort of accidentally totally raped an elf. For those not in the know, that’s worse than just raping a person in a lot of ways. Elves live for a really, really long time. They’re pretty picky about their sexual partners, and even pickier about their “life” partners. Turns out she was married. Not super important yet. Anyway, he woke up the next day, left with the caravan, then started to get paranoid that everyone in the caravan knew he’d done the nasty badly. So, being the brilliant, illiterate maniac he was, he unceremoniously strangled everyone in their sleep and decided to start walking back home.\n\nThe party teleports in, and Torgnan’s sitting at his fire and dragging a chest full of food and a little bit of gold. Everyone is instantly suspicious because, as Torgnan is not very smart, he’s not very convincing when it comes to letting everybody know he’s totally not a bad dude.\nI should mention that, after Jim Picard-Spock, AKA DoppelJim, AKA ShitJim, basically nobody in the party trusts me as a player, and so are instantly suspicious of me as a character. This isn’t great roleplay, but I accepted it. I’d broken everyone’s trust, lied to them in and out of character, so I figure it’ll just be a while before everyone trusts me again.\n\nLater, after we leave the wastes (we killed a sick sandworm, cutting the cleric out from inside its belly and also watching Beric, the asshole nobody fuckin liked because he’s an asshole, lose one of his legs after blowing a roll to jump onto its back and instead slipping beneath its body; of course, the sorcerer at the back stole the kill with a fuckin crossbow, the bitch), DMNPC MK2, Ne’arel or whatever the fuck, casts a pussy-ass spell on me and forces me to tell them what I did; the spell does not let me know that I did this. Everybody’s content to just keep an eye on me, because I’ve proven pretty useful, and it kinda sucks to kill a new character right out the gate. I continue proving myself useful. I punch out a stablemaster after the Bard fucks up and convinces him that platinum is worth significantly less than it actually is (it’s not that interesting, really, just funny), Bard and I interrogate some gnome who used to work with the Big Bad by giving him food using a ship powered by an infinite motion machine, then kill him and steal the ship. This was a Good Decision.\n\nWe go to the other Dead Continent. I don’t remember its name, but it was basically where pretty not-quite-halflings came from. Apparently they were super fuckin hot. They’re all dead now.\n\nBard and I, separate from the rest of the party, go to the center of the planet. It’s a giant snake. We ask the snake about some stuff to do with the Big Bad, seeing as his army isn’t where we were told it would be. He doesn’t really help us very much, so we leave.\n\nWe’ve managed to build up a trade empire. Kalkea’s Alchemical Goods Emporium, the shop we made great and is now the founding store of megamalls across the globe, is bringing in the dough. We’re millionaires, if not billionaires. So we have our own ships. We take them to the nice continent. On the way, I confess to Bard that I raped a woman and feel like I need to go and apologize to her. This is a Good Decision. It leads to multiple Bad Decisions. He says we shouldn’t do that, but I say we gotta, so he says fuckin fiiiiiiiiiine.\n\nWe go do that. Turns out she was married. And got pregnant. She had the child about a year ago, tried to kill herself and the baby. Husband saved the kid, lost her. I find the kid, and then tell the husband the boy is coming with me. He says nuh-uh and tries to punch me. I catch his hand and roll a natural twenty on the grapple. His hand is completely destroyed. His subsistence farming is never going to work again. That \nmatters later.\n\nI take the kid and run. Bard chases me and later we share a moment of me crying profusely about what I’ve done and what I wish I could’ve done and what I should’ve done. Bard gives the kid back and offers the guy a new job working for our army in a logistical role because obviously he’s never working a farm again. He agrees.\n\nTime passes. Bard and I save the desert continent from a horrible civil war because we need their armies for shit that actually matters. The Big Bad’s army shows up and completely annihilates a country overnight. It’s very emotional for someone, I’m sure. Not any of us, though. We only liked two of the people there, anyway. We head back to our fort. Many agents of the Old Gods are there, including one who is a member of a species that only numbers around something like a hundred. We’ve dug tunnels filled with explosives around the fort, so when Big Bad’s army shows up, we fuckin murder em. Not all the tunnels collapse or explode, though. That one guy dies, my character blows the fuck up and tries to kill the guy that was in charge of that tunnel. Everybody gets super pissed. My character, realizing that he’s about to lose his command, decided to go and see the dude who’s been taking care of his kid all this time. I get there and ask him where the kid is. I just wanna see him. He says no. I get a natural twenty to punch him in the face. Instantly dead. Everybody else is freaking out because Torgnan just went fucking nuts and is trying to escape. Torgnan is dead shortly after.\n\nTo this day, nobody knows the name of his son.\n\nAfter this, I create a new character: Cuirannis AKA Queer Anus, the Stoner Elven Druid. He lives inside a large tree growing devil’s weed and hotboxing all the time. He’s been drawn out by the immense evil presence that just passed through his area and joins up with the party, resolving to not have that kind of thing happen again any time soon.\nIn the process of the previous battle, two parties have been combined. Later, Queer Anus learns that these people have a bag of endless caltrops. His first question is, quite simply, “What are these caltrops made of?”\n\nThe DM looks at me for a moment. “Um… Steel.”\n\nI look around the table. “We have an infinite motion machine, right?”\n\n“Right…”\n\n“We’re gonna go pay a bunch of wizards to make a bunch of bags of endless caltrops and put them on that machine. We can also give that dead country with all the iron mines to that one dwarven kingdom so they’ll help us out, because now we have buttfuck huge amounts of steel and have no need for iron.”\n\nEven later, we go to the Valley of Life. While we’re there, I ask if I can have a few seeds of a specific kind of tree. It’s a tree that doesn’t grow anywhere else in the world. You see, there’s this spell called Treewalk. You can go anywhere in the world by travelling through a large enough tree to another large enough tree. Thus Druid Messaging (DMing for short) was born. There are now groves in every major city that facilitate material and information trade around the world. Instant Industrial Revolution.\n\nWe go to the Valley of Life again after finding out the Big Bad has bound himself with a super evil Old God that was buried at the center of the world. I summon a number of Earth elementals, we get the Old Gods to teleport us in on top of him, and kill him in under eighteen seconds. It was rather anti-climactic. Felt good, though. That guy was a real prick.\n\nQueer Anus would then go on to found large cities made of trees. The smoking of Devil’s Weed is highly encouraged, and hotboxing of all public venues mandatory. All waste is dealt with by funnels from the trees to an interplanar gate. Food is grown on one of the dead continents, where the land was coated in ash. Druids and wizards call in rains and speed up the growing season with magic, and many workers are employed in harvesting it. People are happy in these parts of the world. Much of the rest of the world is now in a deep depression, as they are no longer able to keep up with the pace of production and high living in this new world. Life is Good. Queer Anus lives on, taking care of his forests, teaching and administering his hordes of druids, and toking up as often as elvenly possible.\n\ntl;dr: A trio of characters waltz through life as villains, heroes, and villainous heroes. The industrial revolution starts about 1600 years early.\n\nPretty sure a chunk of this was posted by the DM at some point in the past: /u/Atnuul; his version differs from mine, but he had more to remember than me. I didn't give a shit about anyone else's stories.",

        "text": "Hello again! Sorry for the massive delay, IRL commitments have been whooping my ass but I'm jumping back on the horse. This is a direct continuation of 'This is Who We Are: Part 2' which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5htfow/shadowrun_4th_edition_this_is_who_we_are_part_2/. Before we begin, I would like to ask that anyone who did not like the tale or who has any criticism for the story please leave a comment or send me a \nprivate message. I do this to improve my writing skills as much as to entertain. Thank you and enjoy.\n\nThe following tale has no grounding in real life. Any resemblance to people real or fictional is entirely coincidental and hilarious. Please, ABSOLUTELY try running Shadowrun at home.\n\nAustralia was a wondrous country: Delightful people, plentiful beer and natural beauty as far as the eye can see...and a plethora of lethal creatures, both awakened and mundane, waiting to pounce...and swirling vortexes of mystical energy that ravaged the countryside indiscriminately...and rifle-wielding wild-life willing to go to extreme lengths to obtain civil liberties. Actually, now that Patu thought about it, Australia sucked ass. \n\nFour days earlier, the team watched on with idle curiosity as Jana haggled furiously with their latest client. Everything from price to deadline were discussed in seethingly polite terms, every word a carefully honed weapon in their respective arsenals. Jana had sold her team as a highly competent, well-oiled mercenary machine that could accomplish whatever task was required in a fraction of the time that another crew could. Burnie was struck by the dichotomy of this situation: Their client was trying to spend as little nuyen as possible while also retaining their services and loyalty, all because Jana had convinced the Johnson that they were genuinely needed. \n\n\"How much longer is she going to talk?\" Patu groused irritably, his voice modulated by their shared sub-vocal microphones. The mystic Maori sat slumped forward in his seat, arms crossed grouchily, and stared forlornly out the charming cafe's front window. A glowing sign blazed in augmented reality, a neon promise of booze and bedlam for those brave enough to enter. His daydreaming was interrupted by a sharp pain across his shin and Patu glared at Kahu as she smirked back. \n\n\"It'll take as long as it takes.\" She sniped back, reclining comfortably with one arm behind her head. As much as she enjoyed ribbing her team-mate, Kahu found herself agreeing with him. They had been for almost half an hour now, enduring the relentless whine of a white-noise generator, and for what? Another few hundred nuyen? But she deferred to Jana in matters of negotiation, so the hacker would hold her peace. With a flick of her wrist, Kahu ordered another round of refreshments for the table. It had been a professional concession for Mister Johnson to provide them a moderate tab with the establishment and who was she to turn down such generosity? \n\n\"I think things are wrapping up now.\" Burnie murmured quietly, sipping at something carbonated. His colleagues sat a little straighter, Patu's boredom fading at the prospect of work. A waitress with a sunny smile brought them their drinks at the same time that Jana turned to her team with an ever-so slightly smug nod. The Johnson stood stiffly and left as quickly as they could without drawing attention. Kahu added a thirty nuyen tip to their tab before listening intently.\n\n\"Alright then. After intense debate, we have decided to take on the job.\" Jana chirped, more for the Johnson's benefit than theirs; there was no way in hell they were turning such a well paying mission down. \"From what little information I have been able to gather...\" There was a snort from Patu, quickly silenced by Jana's withering glare, before she continued. \"We will be travelling to to Sydney, Australia, and then south of Lismore. At the coordinates in question, we need to locate our target and obtain blood samples from him.\" Jana forwarded each of them the dossier and congratulated herself mentally. \"The task must take no more than two weeks and we will be paid a tidy sum of 30,000 nuyen each. Any questions?\" \n\n\"Over the ditch, eh?\" Patu mused with a yawn. \"Why the hell not? Who's the poor bugger we're sticking with a needle?\" He chuckled at the thought. Jana rolled her eyes in exasperation. \n\n\"I just sent you the file. Why don't you apply your intellect and have a look?\" Her voice held the same quality of a teacher talking to a particularly slow child. He flicked a cocktail umbrella at her and Jana hissed indignantly as her suit was splattered with cheap soda, her features warping to reflect her ire. Patu whistled in amusement, opening up the virtual file.\n\n\"You know something? You're ugly when you're angry, sweetheart.\" It fell to Burnie to restrain Jana, the driver preventing her from committing grievous bodily harm. Patu laughed through it all. \"Alright then, let's see what we're working with here. What do you think, Kahu?\" The woman in question was already cortex deep in their information package, gathering and processing data with the practised motions of a data thief.\n\n\"Looks like we have options on acquisition. Straight from the source or from a research facility near Lismore.\" She hummed in contemplation, her eyes flickering in a stream of information. \"Target has links to an indigenous rights movement called Yichichik. Fairly shady group with no small amount of firepower, might be responsible for a number of missing persons cases. We need a contact on-site to learn anymore.\" Kahu closed her eyes with an aggravated sigh. \n\n\"Wait, we're beating up the Aboriginals? Drek me, that's pretty bloody low.\" Patu grumbled with no real heat. \"Had enough fuckers thinking I'm less because I'm a Maori. Not sure I want to perpetuate the cycle of discrimination, you know?\" Burnie shot him a queer look, obviously confused, but Kahu ignored him in favour of a different tact.\n\n\"I don't think we'll have to worry about that. Read the file.\" The hacker ordered, a strangely satisfied look on her face. Patu did so warily, opening the document. He read to himself in a low mutter, picking out what he considered important and ignoring the rest. It was easy to tell when Patu reached the description of their target from the way his brow furrowed and his jaw dropped open. He looked from Kahu to Jana in disbelief, glasses slipping down his face.\n\n\"He's a fucking kangaroo!?\" It was no simple matter entering the city-state of Sydney: Colossal concrete and steel walls ringed the land around metropolis, enchanted to deflect the arcane might of roving mana storms that threatened to engulf and warp all who dwell within. Traditional air travel was close to impossible due to the unpredictable nature of these transmutative maelstroms and sea travel was heavily regulated due to strict smuggling rules. It was for this very reason that the team decided to take a detour. \n\n\"Brisbane's actually quite nice.\" Burnie offered off-hand, a small smile on his face as he steered their battered vehicle through the wild countryside. \"Even putting aside the poor roads, it's a lovely drive. Look at that countryside!\" He was either ignorant or uncaring of the filthy looks levelled his way by the sickly looking runners. The truck had been bouncing haphazardly across poorly maintained asphalt and traversing bush with the same ease that a man with asthma runs a marathon, which is to say badly indeed. \n\n\"Someone kill the perky bastard.\" Kahu hissed before wincing as another ditch made itself known. Patu weakly lunged for the driver's seat but fell back with a loud groan as the shoddy highway broke down into a loose gravel path and turbulence wracked their voyage. There were despairing moans from all around before Burnie grinned and the world straightened out. It took a few minutes for the others to recover from their nausea, accompanied by jaunty whistling from the driver. \n\n\"I hate you so much.\" Jana whimpered, knuckles white from clenching her head-rest. Her tormentor ignored their pitiable cries completely, his mocking music fading away as he stared out of the windshield. The others followed Burnie's gaze as he came to a sudden stop and their bickering halted abruptly at the sight before them: A colossal gyre of scintillating energy that tore across the countryside, silent despite it's immense size. The land twisted and churned beneath the mana storm. Transfigurative energy wracked the once serene countryside. Plants turned to shifting stone statues and animals erupted into geyser of liquid gold that splattered the newly purple earth. It was as if a cataclysm from lore had torn free of the history books, akin to the razing of Babylon or the eruption of Vesuvius. \n\n\"Oh my god.\" Patu wheezed, his lungs choked of air. \"How do you stop something like that?\" His fear was reflected on the faces of those around him. Hardened criminals one and all, their experience proved little comfort in the face of such a . The silence was deafening; a complete absence of life or sound. \n\n\"You don't.\" Kahu murmured, her hushed words like a gunshot in the stillness. \"You run and hide and hope to hell that today's the day you get lucky.\" She stared placidly at the act of mysticism before leaning back and closing her eyes. \"Not much of a praying sort.\" Kahu began reading through the files provided to them by Jana's contact, a slimy toad of a man named Tater. It had cost them more than a little nuyen to acquire this information and the hacker was going to make sure they got their money's worth. \n\n\"Cool as a fucking cucumber you are.\" Patu rumbled, clutching his signature weapon to him like a safety blanket. The mystic adept did not dare survey the astral plane at such a time so he entertained himself by checking the football scores. \"Fucking bullshit.\" Patu muttered furiously beneath his breath.\n\n\"Shut up, you're breaking my concentration.\" Jana snapped, her attention stolen from the virtual conspiracy board she had been painstakingly building since their separation. Patu glared back at her before busying himself with his scores. The demolitions expert huffed and returned to her theories, connecting digital strings with nimble fingers. Through it all, Burnie stared out at the storm and waited for their chance. Twenty minutes passed in relative tranquillity as the Mana Storm raged on; changing the terrain as easily as one might flick a switch. \n\nIt was safe to say that the storm vanishing was anti-climactic. There was no flash, no explosion or shaking of the earth; it simply disappeared and left chaos in it's wake. It was a humbling experience, for all save Patu.\n\n\"Fuck this place, fuck Mana Storms and fuck Australia. Let's do the job and get the fuck out of here.\" He snarled, banging a meaty fist against Burnie's headrest. \"Let's go, Fat Man. Time to fuck up a kangaroo.\" The driver rolled his eyes and accelerated, their beaten four-wheel drive bouncing across the metamorphosed landscape. Their destination was a small city by the name of Lismore, 150 km south of Brisbane. It was a generally place save for an Arcology that had been built in the area by Renraku along with a heavy presence by the Australian/New Zealand AA Corporation Spitwater. That had been two years ago; now there was another draw for people.\n\n\"They're called the Yichichik mob.\" Kahu informed her team in the monotone drawl of a hacker in hot sim. \"A gang of awakened kangaroos who are trying to gain civil rights and protect their claim to the land. No small number of metahumans have flocked to their cause, especially the Aboriginal Australians.\" Patu scoffed at the report, fiddling with a rifle in the back seat. \"They've been active in handling poachers, bandits and go-gangers for almost a year now. No way to actively link these acts back to them but the Shadow-Net is seething with rumours: Assassins outrunning law enforcement vehicles, snipers nestled in the bushes and even cybered up Kangaroos with cyber-blades.\" Kahu finished with a bemused drawl.\n\n\"So are we really going to try and shoot one of them with a reverse injection dart?\" Jana protested, glancing around. \"I'm sorry but is anyone else concerned about us driving into enemy territory to try and forcibly take blood from a sentient kangaroo when they've been killing people for a year? Anyone?\" She demanded.\n\n\"Jana's right.\" Burnie admitted with a frown. \"We don't have our usual gear, no support network to fall back on and no idea how many bad guys to deal with. Attacking the target head-on is a good way to die young.\" Jana breathed a sigh of relief. \n\n\"Suppose so.\" Kahu relented. \"Any ideas?\" The team of professional assassins and mercenaries took a few moments to think about it before Patu perked up.\n\n\"Find out where he is, wait until he's alone then bonk him on the head and take some blood?\" The mystic adept offered enthusiastically, leaning forward with a gleeful smile across his face. Kahu rolled her eyes, elbowing the burly Maori. Jana scowled at him and bounced a can off of Patu's head, the metal thunking dully across his forehead.\n\n\"Next.\" The explosive expert commanded, looking around hopefully. \"Come on guys, there's got to be something.\" Jana entreated them desperately. \"We're runners for fuck's sake. Do we seriously not have another plan for getting this kangaroo's blood other than shoot him or bash him over the head?\" The silence was damning for all of them. \"Frak me, chummers. Some black ops team we turned out to be.\" Jana muttered despondently. Even Kahu had the good grace to look ashamed, the typically stoic sniper looking away in consternation. It was, to their eternal surprise, Burnie who offered a solution.\n\n\"We could...ask him?\" He asked hesitantly, as if the very idea was ludicrous. The others stared at him until Burnie was fidgeting uncomfortably in his seat.\n\n\"That's so stupid that it might actually work. Kahu, thoughts?\" Jana asked their resident hacker. She performed a few mental calculations before sucking on her teeth. \n\n\"Might work. We go in peacefully, ask for the sample, take it if he won't give it without conflict. Can't see anyone expecting it.\" She admitted, tapping at the window with an idle hand. Patu pouted at the idea, arms crossed unhappily. \n\n\"Pull your head in, omae. We're in this for the money, not the entertainment.\" Jana rebuked him forcefully, jabbing a finger into his chest before turning to Kahu. \"Did Tater's dossier give you any contact info for Snoopy?\" She asked impatiently. Kahu scrolled through her digital list until something caught her eye. \n\n\"Not for the target directly but it looks like someone in the Yichichik mob might be useful. Guy's named Needle, says he's a runner who hangs with their crew.\" It was unusual for them to associate a runner with an organisation but the thought of a fellow runner being around gave them a strange sense of relief. \"Want me to give him a ring?\" Kahu questioned, a knowing smirk on her lips.\n\n\"So let me get this straight.\" A bland voice announced over their shared communication channel. \"You want me to set up a meeting with one of my lads for some kind of talk but you won't tell me what for.\" Needle questioned in bewilderment, his augmented reality persona cocking it's head to one side. The group lounged just outside of Lismore while, strewn around and across the Wall while Jana made a deal.\n\n\"That's the long and short of it. We're willing to pay one thousand nuyen to facilitate the meeting and another thousand to Snoopy as an incentive.\" Jana told the native runner, a a friendly smile on her face. \"I'll be honest, we're sort of hoping for a little runner hospitality here. A little bit of professional courtesy between expendable assets.\" She joked light-heartedly, expecting and receiving a short chuckle from Needle. \"The only people runners can depend on are other runners, am I right?\" Needle rolled his eyes affably but nodded nonetheless.\n\n\"Well, you're not wrong. Look, I'll get you folk into touch with Snoopy but if you start any shit then you know whose camp I'm in.\" The indigenous mercenary remarked. His tiny avatar waved amicably to Jana before winking out of existence and her genial smile turned cold. \n\n\"So it just cost us two thousand nuyen for the chance to meet this fucker. Let's not screw this up.\" Jana growled to her team. Patu snickered until he was silenced by a scathing glare. \"I'm serious. This is the first and only shot we have of making this work without violence. If the meeting goes bad then we have to get the sample, shoot our way out and make it back to Auckland while a mob of sentient sniper kangaroos after our asses.\" She hissed at the mystic adept. Patu's face twisted into an irate grown before Burnie stepped between the two, hands raised placatingly.\n\n\"We get it. No fuck-ups. I think everyone understands that.\" He reassured her gently. Burnie glanced over his shoulder. \"Right guys?\" Kahu nodded and Patu relented, albeit reluctantly. \"Right then, all good.\" The driver breathed a quiet sigh of relief before retreating to his rightful place behind the wheel. Jana took a moment to calm herself before smiling genially at her team. \n\n\"Alright then. Let's just wait for Needle to call us back and we'll go from there.\" She simpered sickly sweet at her team-mates, sliding into the truck before they could answer. Kahu snorted in droll amusement before perking up at the tinny chiming of her comm.\n\n\"Speaking of...\" The hacker murmured. Kahu patched the call through to Jana, silencing the input options of her colleagues temporarily. Jana smiled winningly at their most recent contact.\n\n\"Hello again, Needle. It's very nice to hear from you again so soon.\" Fifteen minutes later, a painfully non-descript truck trundled to a stop below a thin copse of withered trees. Waiting beneath the sparse shade was a strangely well-dressed Macropus Rufus, a red kangaroo with an attitude and an automatic rifle slung over one shoulder. The team stared out their windshield at their target, each of them lost in thought; Kahu scanning the arid landscape for foes, Burnie plotting the quickest route back to Brisbane and Jana planned out her offer to the slightest detail. Patu, on the other hand...\n\n\"Does anyone else feel like we've reached a really weird point in life?\" Patu put forward to the group, drawing their attention. \"Like, we used to steal shit and kill people but now we're trying to get a blood sample from a talking kangaroo.\" He continued talking until Kahu elbowed him in the ribs. Patu grunted in pain and shot her a betrayed look. \"Alright, shutting the fuck up apparently.\" He groused under his breath, rubbing at the abused flesh. \n\n\"Alright, let's roll. Burnie stays in the car with Kahu, Patu with me.\" Jana commanded and the team followed her orders like a well-oiled machine, apart from some good-natured grumbling. She slipped free of the truck and strode towards Snoopy, as at ease in the outback as in the board-room. She felt Patu behind her, his familiar presence reassuring her despite their petty disagreements. They stopped just within the meagre cover and waited for their host to hop over. Despite herself, Jana agreed with Patu as they watched a hoodie wearing kangaroo bounce up to meet them: Life had certainly become bloody strange.\n\n\"G'day, mates.\" It was like every Australian stereotype had been mashed together and Snoopy was the product. \"Needle tells me that you folks need to have a chat with me.\" The kangaroo peered at them over his mirrored sun-glasses with some interest. Jana grinned playfully at their target. \n\n\"Kia Ora, friend. I'm Jana, that's Patu.\" The Maori in question gave the Kiwi nod while Jana kept talking. \"Thanks for agreeing to meet with us, it's much appreciated.\" She remarked pleasantly. Snoopy snorted but inclined his head in return.\n\n\"No problem. So, what's up?\" The kangaroo asked lazily, scratching at an itch behind one ear. He paid more attention to that than to them and Jana was perfectly fine with that.\n\n\"We have been employed to acquire a sample of your blood.\" She stated, her tone matter of fact even as Patu began coughing violently. Gleaming red lights flitted over their forms and Kahu cursed from the car as her team were covered by laser sights. Snoopy stopped his grooming to stare at her, his clawed hand lowering slowly. Jana smiled politely though it all. \n\n\"I don't know if you're stupid or ballsy but you've got my attention.\" Snoopy admitted incredulously. Jana clapped her hands together loudly and gave him a wide smile.\n\n\"Excellent! For the record, I'm neither. I simply believe in being honest with my clients and customers.\" The cheerful statement sent Patu back into a hysterical coughing fit, his heavy frame shaking in disbelief. \"So, we have been hired by an Independent Research Facility with an interest in your unique biochemistry. They recommended that we try to take the sample by force but I think we all know that it would accomplish nothing more than four bodies for your mob to clean up.\" She laughed lightly at the end of her statement, arms spread wide. \"Who wants that? Instead, I thought I'd just ask nicely.\" \n\nSnoopy continued to watch them silently throughout her speech. His face was impassive until the very end. There was an awkward silence after Jana finished talking, as the laser sights whirred through the air like a nest of furious hornets. Kahu and Burnie watched with bated breath, ready to intervene in some hopeless way, when Snoopy began to chuckle. It started off slow at first, a rumbling purr deep in his chest that grew louder and louder until he was openly braying with mirth. Jana grinned easily, leaning casually against a thin tree with her arms crossed. It took a ludicrously long time for the sentient kangaroo to stop laughing, his mirth dying down in guffawing gasps. \n\n\"Alright, love. I like your style.\" He waved one clawed hand in the air and the laser indicators winked out of existence. \"Any idea why they really want my blood?\" He asked the mercenary. She shrugged uncaringly and Snoopy hummed in consideration \"So you want me to give you a sample of my blood but you don't know what they want it for or who's really behind it.\" He summarised.\n\n\"That's about the shape of it. We're happy to pay you one thousand nuyen for the inconvenience and then be on our way.\" Jana offered without missing a beat. Snoopy laughed once more at her audacity, shaking his head. \n\n\"Tell you what. I'll give you a big old vial of blood and you can keep your cash.\" Patu perked up at the statement but Jana narrowed her eyes warily. \"But I want the same in return.\" Snoopy smiled nastily, displaying a muzzle-full of thick teeth. \"A vial of blood from every member of your team, in case anyone tries some funny business.\" Patu hissed angrily at the offer but Jana silenced him with an off-hand gesture. She and Snoopy regarded each other for a long moment before she nodded.\n\n\"Deal.\" Jana ignored Patu's outraged cries and commed Kahu. \"We're doing a blood exchange, bring out the kit and bring Burnie with you.\" She ordered, managing not to flinch at the glare Kahu sent her way. The team soon stood together beneath the trees, reluctantly allowing their blood to be drawn into thin vials. Jana held the four crimson containers in one hand and the vacuum syringe in the other. \"There's our end of the bargain.\" She stated coolly. Snoopy dipped his head in acknowledgement and extended one furry limb. One faint hiss and a filled ampoule of mutated kangaroo blood later, Jana reluctantly offered their target his bribe. Snoopy reached for them until she pulled them back, finally showing a hint of uncertainty. \"You know what happens if anyone else gets a hold of these, right?\"\n\nSnoopy bared his teeth in a terrifying smile and Jana relinquished the blood vials with a sigh. The kangaroo placed his prizes gently into his pouch before nodding to the group and hopping away slowly. One by one, the runners began to retreat to their truck until only Patu remained. The mystic adept was staring after Snoopy with an intense glower on his face; his fist clenched so tightly that the colour was leeching out of it. A hand fell on his shoulder and Patu span with a snarl, ready to pound someone into paste. The fact that it was Burnie behind him did not quench his desire.\n\n\"It's done. Let it go.\" Burnie reasoned quietly. Patu gnashed his teeth together, sparks flying off of his body to force the driver back. \n\n\"Let that asshole go with our blood? Do you have any idea what someone can do with a vial of your blood? What a mage can do?\" He spat furiously. Burnie opened his mouth but Patu cut him off. \"Obviously fucking not if you're so happy to give it out. It means that someone can target you with a spell from anywhere in the fucking world, motherfucker. No line of sight bullshit or whatever. You're just walking along and then you go boom!\" There was a tone of panic beneath the anger, enough that Burnie took note.\n\n\"I know. Doesn't matter now. We got the job done, time to go home.\" Patu paused, seething silently. Burnie capitalised on his momentary rage break. \"I'm done with Australia and it's crazy fucking mana storms and it's weird fucking animals.\" He pushed the right buttons and soon enough, Patu was nodding along tiredly. The electrical field vanished, lightning flashing out of existence, and the mystic adept trudged back to the car sullenly. Burnie followed wordlessly; there was nothing else to say. \n\nThe trip back to Auckland was blissfully uneventful; no mana storms descended on the despondent team and their plane arrived on time. The team separated as soon as they hit New Zealand soil, staying together only to receive their payment. Patu made a bee-line for the closest bar and promptly spent a good portion of his pay on getting shit-faced while Kahu retired to her farm-house to brood about the situation. Jana spent the next few days piecing together more information about the conspiracy around recent events while Burnie returned to his legitimate courier business. He arrived just in time to witness his company being raided by A.L.E forces. \n\n\"What the hell is going on here?\" The entirely authentic businessman demanded. He was met with cold detachment from the raiding officers as they tore apart his office, terrifying his receptionist in the process. \"Officer, I know my rights and I know that you have to answer my question here.\" Burnie snarled, stepping protectively in front of a scared Siri. The armoured agent sneered at him but complied.\n\n\"We're searching for contraband after we received an anonymous tip that your company was transporting illegal goods. We haven't found anything but we'll be keeping a close eye on you.\" He gestured and the team filed out, like a row of perfectly uniformed toy soldiers. The leading officer paused for a moment, leaning in with a nasty smirk. \"Joseph Caxton says hello.\" Burnie glared after him, straining not to reach over and snap the man's neck. The runner looked around at his ruined office, taking stock of the damage, before sighing.\n\n\"Son of a bitch.\"",

        "text": "[PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/5ol9tm/my_most_intense_game_yet_had_players_getting/)\n\nTheir wizard was dead, security was high, and steaks slowly rising. They were only half way into the Volcano, Karn-Beag. The situation was grim. \n\nThey reached the functioning part of the factory and had Dead Wizard's new character introduced. They fought past iron golems and snuck into transportation without raising the alarm and then stole a truck loader. With the help of the new dwarf in the party they knew a shortcut to their destination - the control tower of the factory. \n\nBut right as they were entering another factory building some spotlights from a high tower briefly passed over them right before they entered. No big deal right? Well this is where they don't keep so low on the radar, because they basically just fight their way into the building. \n\n**Enter scene:** [**Snatcher**](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/5oqpob/ocmy_most_recent_boss_the_snatcher_a_dwarven/). *From the ceiling a huge machine built from dragon bones emerges. It's metal spine hangs from massive iron rails running around the entire facility. It has four eyes like spotlights, two [metal shears](https://media.machinerypark.com/offer/images/46/46/381-286/750ee06ff055734567.jpg), and two arms that could reac out across 15 squares on the map.*\n\nThe tough dwarf ally that had helped them this far was overtaken by fear and simply said in a quavering voice, \"The Snatcher...\" And rain for it. I start playing [this playlist](https://play.spotify.com/user/zingzopper/playlist/22kxFDDEcqTY7oSlQ7qLhP) (recommended while reading). Party decides they should get out of dodge. \n\nParty runs in a straight line.\n\nThe Snatcher breathes fire and the party takes a considerable amount of damage. They round a corner and reach a moving platform. Their ally has already started smashing controls to get it moving, but the snatcher catches up instantly and grabs their barbarian. People start freaking out. Luckily he was able to get out and use a few spells to make a quick escape as the party scrambles out of the building through a ladder. \n\nFor some reason when they got out of the building they thought they were safe. They saw their destination high above across a network of ladders and catwalks. \n\nThey heal up a bit and climb to the top of the facilities largest chimney stack that's 1,200 ft. above the rest of the factory. They see spotlights searching the entire facility and start running around the top of this chimney. Behind them the snatcher rises up on rails again. They see an aqueduct of lava that has a smaller catwalk coming off where the snatcher's rails don't go. They high tail it there while their barbarian gets grabbed again, but this time he escapes AND manages to destroy the pilot light for it's fire breath.\n\nIt starts catching up and clawing at them, they are getting really low on health and supplies as they try to keep it away and run at the same time. \n\nThey reach their smaller catwalk where they don't think the Snatcher can follow. They all start running in a line again. &gt;:D it finally catches up completely, but instead of grabbing them, it drags its hand in the river of lava below, reaches its red hot hand to its mouth, and releases a torrent of flame upon them. \n\nTheir destination is close. Just at the end of the flimsy catwalk is a hand-cranked elevator that leads to the control tower. Behind them the Snatcher releases itself from the rails and attaches itself to the railing of the flimsy bridge they're on. It's weight makes its side of the bridge start falling apart to the ground thousands of feet below. But it's latched on and starts clambering toward them. It nearly grabs the wizards new character. \n\nBy now people were really panicking wondering if they'd even make it to the end of the bridge with this thing still catching up. \n\nLuckily it failed grabbing anyone. \n\nThey thought it would fall to the facility below, but one of its arms stretches out to grab the platform they're at. \n\nTheir elevator needs two people cranking a wheel for it to rise. I tell them they have 4 turns of successful strength rolls to reach the top. As the barbarian and ally dwarf are making strength rolls the snatcher is trying to fit its jaw through the scaffolding and bite people. \n\nRight before the elevator emerges through the floor of the room above its arm reaches in and grabs a PC, stopping the elevator from moving up entirely. They go crazy hacking away at its metal arm until it screeches and leaves. \n\nOnce again they think they're safe, even though they hear it clambering around the top of this tower scraping and clawing at the walls. \n\nThey reach the final control room. It has glass walls on 3 sides so they can see the factory below them, and inside are 3 dwarves who start trying to get the infamous PCs out of their tower. And this is where things got really crazy. \n\nNot only did the Snatcher hang from the side of the building and start reaching through the now-broken windows, but another dwarf had activated a defense that has the room start filling with lava from one side. \n\nThe Music was blasting loudly now, and there were more than a few epic moments. The barbarian had a giant crossbow he shot at the snatcher dealing the final blow as he yelled, \"SNATCH THIS!\" Sending Snatcher plummeting to its doom. They slew the gaurds with relative ease, but the lava kept filling the room. \n\nI handed them a piece of paper with five buttons drawn on.\n\nThey don't know which to press, and I smack a 2 minute sand timer in the middle of the table with little explanation. After a few seconds they realize that it's the time they have until the room has completely filled with lava. \n\nThey start panicking more and yelling to eachother about what to do. They hit one button that turns off the alarms below, not what they need. \n\nOne minute left.\n\nThey try another that opens a locked door that's now covered in molten stone. \n\n30 seconds\n\nThey are frantic yelling that they don't know which one they need. \n\n15 seconds. \n\nAfter hitting each one the timer looks like it's seconds away from being empty. And with moments to go the correct kill-switch was the last button they pressed. \n\nIt was definitely the most intense battle I'd ever witnessed. The players were hugging each-other IRL, my heart was racing, and hands were sweating. Somebody had reached 0 HP right before the end, but they won. And I couldn't be happier.\n\n**TL:DR, Giant machine chases players across dizzying heights. Each time they think they're safe it comes back just a little bit more up close and deadly.**\n",

        "text": "[Previous Entry](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5n0sk8/dnd_5e_kidnapped/)\n\n“Lana, do you know what love is?” \n\n“Yes,” Lana lied. It wasn’t that she was purposefully being dishonest, instead it was her poor upbringing that skewed her understanding of love. In time Lana learned how to recite the textbook answers to appease Dr. Tomlund, but never had she felt it.\n\nThat is until now.\n\nLana sat next to her unconscious friend. His face had become more recognizable, the swelling having gone away as the week passed by.\n\n*Please wake up Rin!* Lana pleaded silently. The Halfling remained still. Once she had heard him mutter something but it was too incoherent. The only hope she had for him surviving was the steady rise and fall of his chest.\n\nA week ago she was scared that Sylis could have spoken truth about the Halfling, that Rin might have left town after she had promised herself to the Wizard. Part of her almost wished Sylis had been right. It would have been easier to have dealt with Rin’s abandonment over the guilt she was now plagued with.\n\nLana had gone to check on him, hoping Rin had returned from his job, but found his home emptied. She left a note for her friend before returning to Sylis and informing him that he wasn’t there.\n\n“Lana... do you think Rin might have left town?” Sy asked as they walked to the tattoo parlor. \n\n“Of course not!” she retorted, “He’s doing a job. For all I know he could be gone a few days. It was wishful thinking he’d be done by now.”\n\nSylis however pushed the topic. He explained how on the ship, when he had kissed her for the first time, that Rin had seen the exchange. “He gave a look that a man would give another when they’ve been defeated. I think he might have loved you.” \n\n“We’re just friends Sylis!” her words came firmly, “He said he was happy for us. He wouldn’t just leave me without saying good bye!”\n\nAt the time, Lana’s face burned as anger bubbled to the surface. If he had left, that would have been crippling. He was her best friend and the only one who didn't treat her with the hopes to bed her. For all she knew, Rin wasn't interested in women. Lana had been naked in front of him on more than one occasions and never had he reacted or treated her differently. But it didn’t help that Sylis kept trying to convince her of the Halfling's likely disappearance.\n \n“Stop it!” she had yelled at him, “He’s not gone! You’re acting jealous ya know!”\n\n“What have I to be jealous of? I have my forever,” Sylis said warmly, pulling her in. Lana gave a fake smile. She couldn't believe Rin loving her. She still had a hard time believing that Sylis loved her. Sure he said it to her often enough, but maybe it was just the sex...\n\nBut something woke within Lana a week ago. After being taken by Barut, she had momentarily forgotten near everything she knew. She had found herself in a cold prison, endured his rape, and escaped with friends who she thought were strangers. Lana had watched Rin get beaten and hated that of all people she’d forget, he was one of them.\n\nThe Warforge, Shard, agreed to help carry Rin for Lana. Sylis found Lana’s pack, boots, and daggers. He passed them to her and soon she had a long shirt retrieved and thrown over her. \n\nAs they left warehouse, Lana thanked the men for saving her and the Halfling. Sylis ever so often would try and wrap an arm around her. Not remembering him, the contact was stifling and sent the sensation of spiders crawling over her skin.\n\n“Could you please not touch me?” she had demanded. Sylis couldn’t believe his ears and snapped.\n\n“Not touch you? Are you joking around with me? Lana, it’s me! Sylis!” The Wizard noted the scared look on Lana’s face and continued with a softer tone, “I'm your life, your forever.” He tried to take her hand in his.\n\n\"Why would I joke? What do you mean ‘your forever’!?\" Lana spat back, jerking her hand away. “I’ve only just met you! Don’t think you can do what you like just because you saved me!” Her arms once more wrapped around herself protectively.\n\nSylis looked pained. After a few more minutes of quiet walking, he spoke of their shared past. He reminded her of the Bringers of Hope Guild, of how they fought side by side, of their time on the cruise, and of the red string’s meaning.\n \nAs he talked, Lana shaking her head at his attempts to convince her, it was like something melted away inside her mind. She looked down at the red string and the memories suddenly unraveled. The guild came into clear view. She started to sleep there after they failed to kill Barut at the Magic Flute. Then the graveyard where she saw the ghost of her mother, Sylis had wrapped her tightly in his arms that night as the memory haunted her. Then the cruise and the intimacy they shared there.\n\nLana had stopped walking. She slowly looked to Sylis and felt such a joy to see him again. He had come for her! He had saved her! What possessed her to have forgotten him?\n\nShe wrapped her arms about him tightly, enjoying his embrace for a brief moment. Sylis was a haven to the hell Barut put her through. Lana then turned to thank Shard as well, but spotted Rin unconscious on his shoulder. Something gripped at Lana’s heart as she recalled what she heard Barut say to him. \n\n*She has done this to you! She has brought you here!*\n \nIt was her fault. If Rin had never helped Lana, if they never had met, he never would have been involved. The guilt was worse than when her mother’s ghost accused her for murder... \n\nBut then Rin’s voice replaced Barut’s. *Rin knows Lana’s a good woman!* \nAnd that was even worse. What did the Halfling see in her that would make him say that? She had brought him nothing but trouble and used him for help. His friendship was more of a convenience.\n\nYet Lana found herself holding Rin’s hand as she sat next to him. All week she had watched over him, putting his recovery above all else. The morning sun illuminated his pale skin. Though he looked far better than when she had first brought him to Faela, his body still was covered in gauze and poultices. The wounds were healing slowly and every time she saw them it was a reminder of how terrible she was. \n\n*Women like you deserve to be punished!* Barut’s voice taunted.\n\nLarge tears poured down her cheeks. She quickly wiped them away. Sylis wasn’t there to catch them and she was happy about that. She didn’t want his distraction, not while Rin remained hurt. Let alone she still felt betrayed that he would accuse Rin for being the reason Lana was abducted.\n\n“Because I don’t trust him!” Sylis retorted when Lana asked why he had denied knowing the Halfling. “Think about it. He’s always in the wrong place at the wrong time. For all we know he could have been why you were taken in the first place!”\n\n“How could you think that! Rin would never sell any of us out! He’s saved my life AND your life at least once!” Lana shouted. On top of everything that had happened to her over the past few hours, accusing Rin of such betrayal ignited a rage Lana didn't know she had. “Just leave me alone!\" she continued to shout, \"I’m going to make sure Rin get’s well if it’s the last thing I do! And I don’t need your help!”\n\nSylis cursed back at her, exaggerating his joy for her being back.\n\nAnd so it was, a week ago, Lana entered the church next to Rin’s home dressed in just a shirt, writhing in anger and self loathing, with Shard and her dying friend. \n\n*Please Rin come back to me!*\n\n[The Week](http://iadumija.blogspot.com/2016/10/the-week.html)",

They knew one tough dwarf who used to work here, and new an abandoned section underground they could sneak in through.\n\nSo they sneak into some tunnels in a volcano and find their way through old broken machinery with numerous rust monsters and a gelatinous cube. There was some traps flavored as rusted floors or semi-dormant machinery. All in all, it was your average dungeon.\n\nExcept that the party wizard/rogue was fronting all the damage. It was mostly a joke until the end of the game when the gelatinous cube crit HARD on the wizard, killing him instantly. There are no revives in this world. This player had been with the party for 4 years and it was really unexpected. The players were in shock, and absolutely destroyed what was left of the slime.\n\nThey spent about an hour saying funeral rites and reminiscing on their past adventures. And ended the game with the barbarian throwing his corpse into a pool of lava as a viking burial and a reference to some shenanigans from the first session.\nThey all said, \"I expected him to die sooner or later, just not like this.\" It was really emotional etc. etc.\n\n\nBut they didn't know they were only half way through the dungeon. &gt;:D\n\nstay tuned...",

Now, I recently realized that there really aren't any more tales I'm familiar with to read, and I was wondering if there are any that you kind folks over here at r/gametales might want to hear me read.\n\nJust a couple things to mention; I don't generally like greentexts, since they're formatted really poorly for reading aloud, and I usually like things that would take maybe 10-20 minutes to read. It's been a bit, so I'm happy to do another long-form thing like OMH was. It was a lot of fun, but it took a lot out of me reading for long periods consistently.",

        "text": "So the session starts normally enough. Mage (Tarot), Street Sam 1(Prototype), Street Sam 2 (Basher), Rigger (Watcher) and I (Uriel - Face) are on two jobs. One is to babysit a AA CEO's 23 year old daughter as he's getting hits on him and she's next in line for the corp. The other is to recover 12 puppies from a rapper in CAS and return them to his soon to be ex-wife trid starlet. We're based in San Francisco. \n\nSo we take the young lady and fly on the trid starlet's plane to West Palm Beach. Daddy is paying 5k a day for bodyguarding, and we've got 2 weeks up front, so we rent out the penthouse of the Hilton for three days under one of my SINS.\n\nNext I rent a van and everyone but Watcher, the rigger, goes to get some info on the house we're breaking the puppies out of. Oh, yeah, the puppies all have My Little Pony names. We're gone ~45 min.\nWe arrive back at the hotel and take the elevator up to the suite... to find the rigger banging the young lady we are to protect. Also, she's a virgin, and the sex was terrible for her - Tarot, the mage, assessed her and found her in pain. My character - a burned runner, left for dead by an unprofessional former team, is enraged as this is fucking the goose that lays golden eggs and whose father can have us killed with his pocket change. I go to my room and start screwing on the silencer to my pistol.\n\n\nI also com to everyone but the rigger, \"You DO NOT fuck the goose who lays the golden eggs. You DO NOT fuck a virgin w/ a powerful father. You DO NOT fuck a drunk woman who can't consent. Period. He is a fucking dead man. Tonight.\"\n\n\nBasher, the cybered up Troll Street Sam is buddies w/ the Rigger and asks him out to the bar. He then beats the shit out of Watcher in the elevator instead of killing him. They return to the penthouse. At this point I've got my gun by my leg and a called shot at the ready if that fucking elf shows his face. Out comes Basher, blood on his hands... but far too quickly to have disposed of the body. I ask where's the body. After seeing the look in my eyes the elf decides to stay in the van I rented at the beginning of the mission than come into the penthouse.\n\n\nI go to pick up the RV the group rented for the ride back to UCAS and on the way calls my fixer for two doses of Cutters, hard nano-tech that can be triggered to deal physical dmg. **GM Hand waving agrees.** After paying a CRAZY amount of money for this forbidden shit on no notice my character sneaks up to the rental van the frisky elf has been relegated to after getting kicked out of the penthouse, and Neuro-stun X grenades him. Well he fails to save on either his perception, that of his drones, or his body check and falls unconscious. Once he's out he get's two doses of cutters (to make sure he really is dead) and a note pinned to his chest will a list of things that if he does or happens he will die. Like my character dying, fucking the job, drinking on the job, pissing me off, ect.\n\n\nSo then I go up to the penthouse and explain my lesson in being a fucking professional and the short leash the rigger is on. Basher, being best buds w/ Watcher, comes after me. Well, as a Face in a fistfight with a cyber'd up troll I'm fucked, so I blast him in the face w/ my cybergun in my hand, DMSO + NuroStun X. Not enough to drop him. So the troll then crushes my head w/ one attack, all the way through stun into physical, and ruptures my eyeball.\n\n\nBasher is then taken out by Tarot with control thoughts, and made to sit the fuck down. I get taken to the RV to get patched up. The furry elf and I awaken at approx. the same time. I'm visited by the mage who is telling me the troll want's my head and I need to deactivate the cutters NOW. Well... looking at my ruined face I put on my helmet (with a gasmask built in) and drop another stun grenade. The mage falls unconscious. I then get on the motorbike I rented to get to the RV and fuck off.\n\n\nThe ***BEST*** part is EVERYTHING is in my face's name, and they're in CAS. So Uriel runs away with 80k of the group's money, and the van, RV, and Penthouse are in his name... Oh, and they've got to get back to San Fran w/ no money.\n\n\nBest RP session EVER.",

        "text": "This is the story of our first time playing Delta Green.\n\nI was a federal agent named Booty Hunt, and there was my partner, Steven Whills, and our interpreter, Codename: Polished Fingers. I had a shotgun, a pistol, and a grenade. This is important for later.\n\nSteven and Booty worked for the CIA, and were assigned to track down a missing camper named Bartholomew Hamm in a campsite about fifteen miles out of Hiroshima. While Booty chose to leave the offices and drive across town to the CIA database, a Delta Green contact pulled up in front of the CIA facility and presented Steven with a blank business card (a calling card for Delta Green agents). Steven was taken to an abandoned warehouse, but updated Booty on his location so that he could join them after gathering info. At the warehouse, Steven was introduced to Codename: Polished Fingers, a man who had spent time working for a Japanese ambassador, and thus was fluent in Japanese and had sufficient experience in foreign affairs there.\n\nOnce Booty arrived, an informant stepped out to tell them that Delta Green wanted to expand the group's assignment. Not only were they to find Hamm, but they were informed that multiple people had gone on. Additionally, the area was the site of several Japanese and Nazi experiments during the WW2 era. Fingers went to go prepare a flight for Japan. Booty and Steven chose to go search the files on the area deep within the Japanese embassy. We found a single document.\n\nThe document described the experiments of Dr. Richard Wagner. They did work on children who seemed normal enough, but they would play games where they would chant in a circle around someone. The person couldn't flinch, or they would lose. Wagner often noticed a red-headed girl, but the other workers insisted that a redhead had not been there for at least six months. One child confronted Wagner and asked him unexpectedly if he had *really* gotten a golden watch from his grandmother. He had.\n\nWe flew to Tokyo mostly uneventfully, and got a hotel for the night. While Booty went to a nearby convenience store to pick up a prepaid phone, he noticed a white SUV with tinted windows, slowly edging closer. He ducked back into the hotel and informed the others. We chose to leave it be. The next day, Steven received a call saying to take the back roads to Hiroshima. We were being followed. We got a rental vehicle and took off for the back roads, and sure enough, we saw the white van behind us. We convinced Fingers to go off road and loop around behind the white van to determine whether or not they were following us. They coincidentally took the same path to Hiroshima. It seemed a coincidence.\n\nOur first decision was to scope out the site. It was a campsite, based mostly on an honor system. There was no attendant at the entrance. Instead, people were expected to fill out the necessary forms and deposit their camping fees into a box. We chose to pop open the box to look at the paperwork of previous campers. We learned nothing from it. Upon taking a look at the campsite, we found it would be difficult to navigate on any vehicle and were essentially expected to hike it. We elected to grab supplies, find a cheap hotel, and come back in the morning. Guess what was parked in the lot at the first cheap hotel we came to? Yep. Another white SUV with tinted windows. Fingers looked at the license plate. It looked normal enough, but he determined the regional code was fake. We stayed at a nearby hotel, but not the same one. The group never learned what the white SUVs were.\n\nThe next day we made for the camp. After a quick walk, the track split off into three directions. The outer directions were to campsites. We presumed that because our man was missing, that he probably was not around people. We went straight. On the path were three sets of footprints: an old man, a young woman, and an adult hiker. The tracks disappeared at different intervals. As the last set of tracks ended, we found a pool of blood leading off to the right of the track. We chose to mark the trees and go off the path in that direction. We followed the path for several hours, and came to a site where there were tree stumps shaped distinctly like kneeling, beheaded figures. It was growing dark and cold. We chose to set up camp closer to the path. As we walked back, we found an old rusty military vehicle. Fingers pulled it open. There were three skeletons in Nazi uniforms. Germans. Our camp went up close by. There was nothing to do about the soldiers.\n\nInside our tent, we prepared to go to bed. Of course, after nightfall is when the crazy shit begins. We heard heavy human breathing outside. Booty asked, nervously, for the breathing to \"kindly fuck off.\" It did. Momentarily. However, the breathing then sounded from the other side of the tent. Booty commented to Fingers, jokingly, to go check it out. Fingers actually did.\n\nBooty stuck his head out of the tent and shined his flashlight to watch Fingers, but he soon was out of sight. It was unnaturally dark. Fingers noticed what appeared to be a little girl walking around, and then felt a figure come up behind him and put its hands on his shoulders. He screamed, alerting Steven and Booty. They grabbed their guns and took off towards Fingers. The little girl appeared to both of them, making them panic. They kept running. They found their friend, collapsed on the ground, bleeding out from neck wounds. Steven, the more experienced in first aid, did not manage to stabilize him. Booty tried and failed also. Steven went for surgery, but that failed. Booty made an effort, too. He missed the check by 1 point. Fingers died.\n\nBooty and Steven went back to camp and were left alone by whatever it was that was around them. They did not sleep well. While Booty began to insist on turning back, Steven pointed out that Delta Green agents would be subjected to torture if they backed out. Begrudgingly, Booty pressed on. They came to a large brick facility with a single door. Booty opened the door and found that the insides were pitch black. The pair drew their flashlights and stepped inside. It was a dark building filled with 40s electrical equipment. To the right, they heard chanting children. To the left was a small red-headed girl. She stared blankly. She did not respond to 'hello.' Steven began to talk in some broken Japanese to the girl, prompting her to open her mouse but not respond. The door to the outside slammed shut. Booty attempted, but failed to open it.\n\nSteven said, \"Dr. Richard Wagner.\" The girl began to scream at such a volume that the building shook. Steven quickly added, \"We killed Dr. Richard Wagner.\" At that, the girl stopped screaming, but she began to move towards them erratically, as if on fast-forward. She would occasionally jump back to her original position, but continued to advance. Booty (privately to the DM) pulled the pin from his grenade and began to hold the trigger down. Things were going south. Once the girl got within ten feet, Steven shot her twice. It slowed her. It did not stop her. The pair began to move away, towards the chanting. The girl did not seem intent on catching them, but rather, on leading them. Steven reached a red door, and chose to open it. There stood a man with solid black eyes, who acknowledged them politely.\n\n\"Would you like to play a game?\" he asked. The two hesitated. \"What kind of game?\" asked Booty.\n\n\"Yes or no,\" replied the man. The two continued to hesitate, talking it over between themselves. Several children appeared behind the man, and they all appeared progressively more monstrous as the \"yes or no\" question became more and more frequent.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Booty. They smiled.\n\n\"Take a seat,\" said the man, pointing to the middle of the floor. Booty and Steven sat back to back.\n\n\"Don't flinch,\" he said. Then the children locked arms and began to dance around them, spinning and chanting. Booty and Steven managed to maintain composure. They did not flinch, even with the children getting within inches.\n\n\"You are one of us now,\" the kids said to Steven, more confident in his ability not to flinch.\n\n\"It's still part of the game,\" hissed Steven to Booty. \"Don't flinch.\" One kid grabbed a screwdriver and moved towards Steven. He refused to flinch. The kid stabbed Steven in the base of the skull with the screwdriver, making him feel *free.* Booty reached around and tried to pull the screwdriver out of Steven's neck, prompting the children to attack him. As soon as they made contact, Booty dropped the grenade and blew them all up.\n\n**tldr; Booty Hunt blows up some ghost kids.**",

        "text": "[The Prequel, plus the cast description](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5n7o1h/the_gang_does_chemical_warfare_sr_5e/)\n\nThis session was... interesting. 15+ hours over the course of three days, but it definitely became the best session(s) of tabletop I've ever done. \n\nWe open on the parking lot of Dante's Seoul, on New Year's Eve. Flames drawn in augmented reality jump out at the hundreds of people standing in line, bored, waiting for the bouncers to let them in. Our team, however, doesn't have to worry about that- the Johnson sprung for VIP passes. The team filters in one by one. First Kimberly, much to the confusion of the waiting paparazzi. Then Ex and Psy walk by. A photographer for a racing magazine starts taking pictures, and as paparazzi are wont to do, many others start shooting in the hopes of figuring it out later. Their very own Conrad Verner approaches. \"Oh my god! It's you guys! You're an ORCR team! Can I have an interview? And a picture?\" Much to Psy's dismay, they allow a picture, and promise an interview at another time. Then they go in for the meet. 20 minutes later, the meet is about to begin. The Johnson is checking his watch, waiting for the final member- Neuro. And, as he does, Neuro arrives less than 5 minutes early. Just as the team is giving up hope, the coked-up Elf walks into the endless buffet, and sits at their table with the confidence only he can muster. Our Johnson speaks up as he arrives. \n\n\"Ah. Finally. Guten Abend, my friends! Thank you all for joining me! We can discuss business now, yes? I have a job for you... you will be flying into Burma. Some Saeder-Krupp scientists have had their plane hijacked while refueling, then the signal from their transponder went offline. Satellite imagery reveals the plane is not where the signal went offline. We believe that the plane was hijacked, the scientists held hostage, and then the plane moved to hide their tracks. We want you to uncover them.\" \n\nNeuro speaks up. \"Well, assuming the paygrade is agreeable, I think this works for us all, yes?\" \n\nAfter negotiating pay, we get more details about who we're looking for, leads, etc. We get a datachip with their pictures, names, and general information, as well as the promise of a list of possible places they are within 2 days. In addition, Psy's fixer tells her that we can meet a local smuggler, named Khun Thura, for extra information. Everyone spends 2 days packing up all their stuff, then they arrive at the airport for a private SK flight. The flight gets off and to Rangoon within a few hours. \n\nThe plane lands in Rangoon. \"Thank you for flying air SK. The local time is 3:30 PM, and the local weather is *hot.*\" And, stepping off the plane, the team feels it. With temperatures in the high 90s (fahrenheit, obviously), and nearly 100% humidity, it's practically a sauna. The two minute walk to the van is just a bit uncomfortable for everyone. And, the van ride isn't much fun either. Traffic is *awful.* Day turns to night as they fend off beggars, scammers, panhandlers, and salesmen knocking on their windows. But finally, a long time later, the van pulls into a parking lot. Bags are taken out and brought into the air-conditioned building as quickly as possible. Psy, being the one who made the reservations, approaches the desk. The standard conversation is had, with the woman manning the desk tossing in the number to the local black market in case we \"need further service not provided by the hotel,\" then we're given our keys and sent upstairs. \n\nThere are two rooms, one with a queen bed for Psy and Ex (the others assume they're just *really* close friends) and one with two twins for Kimberly and Neuro. The four start discussing their plans, and eventually, they settle on resting for the day, and then going off to talk to Khun Thura the next day. After a long shower and a short nap, Ex goes to the bar, Psy takes a shower with promises of joining her later, and Neuro is doing a line of cocaine in the bathroom. Right before he can snort it, however, Kimberly knocks. \"Hello. I have something that might enhance the experience, would you like to try it?\" \n\n\"...What is it?\"\n\n\"Bliss.\" Now, for those blissfully unaware, Bliss is a strong opiate; its description and effects not too far removed from today's heroin. A strong downer. Coke is an upper. Both Neuro and Kimberly knows what happens when you mix uppers and downers, but neither particularly care, Kimberly because she loves experimenting with drug interactions and hates morals. Neuro, because... well, he's Neuro. \n\n\"Yeah, okay, sure.\" Neuro snorts a line then feels a needle hit him. He thankfully rolls well on the addiction roll to Bliss, and survives the speedball. He lays down, feeling remarkably unhappy with his choices for something named Bliss. Psy, unaware of this happening, has just left for the bar, and Kimberly leaves a few minutes later- leaving our drugged out hero all alone. On a strong drug for his first time. This goes about as well as you expect.\n\nHowever, at the moment, Psy is entering the bar to see Ex and some large (that is, swole) native man wearing a tight black t-shirt with a buzz cut, flirting. Ex explains her motivations over DNI message to Psy- those being to screw with Psy and get info on local goings-on- and Psy, satisfied, sits on the other side of him unceremoniously. \n\n\"So, what brings you to Burma? Honeymoon?\" the Captain asks her.\n\n\"Oh, uh, yeah! Honeymoon. My wife and I just got married, we're touring Asia. She's always wanted to learn to fly- do you know where we can find an airfield, maybe?\" The GM tells me to roll con. With my standard 2 dice, I decide to pre-edge it. This allows me to add my edge pool to the roll, for a whopping 7, and I can roll every six again. I hold my breath and roll... \n\n9. 9 successes, on 7 exploding dice. I charm the absolute pants off of him. \n\n\"Oh! Yes, of course! In fact, I am an army captain in the Burmese military, and I have an ex-air force friend. He runs a small airstrip outside of town, please, call me if you ever want to go, I'd love to help out. Maybe get a discount for you?\" Now, of course, this is where Psy and Ex both roll to judge his intentions. And their judgement is that he's full of shit. Of course, it's impossible to tell why, but it's pretty obvious to them. Then, at this point, Kimberly comes down- and Ex spies a perfect opportunity to mess with both Psy and Kimberly. Ex sends a DNI, \"Just go along with it.\" then springs up and hugs Kimberly. \"This is my loving wife, captain! We're so happy you're helping us out!\"\n\nKimberly just barely pulls herself together from this sudden assault. \"Yes. Of course. Thank you.\" Over DNI, she's saying things to the effect of 'this is the worst moment of my life.' After a little while of Ex mentally torturing Kimberly by being as dopey and loving as possible, the captain sends his commcode then takes his leave, while the team returns to the rooms. Kimberly opens the door to her room, only to find Neuro... missing. Ex and Psy split up to comb the stairways, while Kimberly goes in to record results of her experiment. Eventually, Ex finds Neuro, 8 floors down from their rooms, in a stairwell, muttering to a few specks of dust in between loudly singing the Rocky theme.\n\n\"Okay, Neuro, let's--\" \n\n***\"DUN DUN DUUUUUUNNNNNNNNN\"***\n\n\"-get you back on your-\" \n\n***\"DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUNNNNN\"***\n\nEx sighs. \"Feet.\" She pulls him up to his feet and helps him to the elevator, carrying him to the room. (And, for the record, he's been trying to make it down the stairs for over an hour at this point. He made it down 8 floors, harming himself in the process.) Having been a long day for everyone, the party sleeps, promising to find Khun Thura the next day.\n\nThe next day arrives, and with both Ex and Kimberly passing their insomnia checks, they aren't too grumpy- so they set out to meet their smuggler contact. Our GM tells us all to roll edge as a group to see how lucky we are with traffic. I roll 5 dice. 0 successes. Neuro rolls 2, 0 again. Kimberly rolls 3. 0. And Psychedel, finally, rolls her pool of two- for a 0. We all look at the successes, emotions ranging from shock and fear on our part, to childlike glee on the GM's part. He finally speaks up. \n\n\"You get in the van, and start driving. Traffic isn't as bad right now, but it's still pretty tight on this road. Then, after an hour or so in the van, you see something.\"\n\nWhat the party sees is a truck full of soldiers in uniform stop in the middle of traffic, and all the soldiers jump out. They set up a perimeter, then two of them saunter over to the first car near the truck. They open the car door.\n\n***BLAM. BLAM.*** Two shots ring out from the soldiers' guns, and they close the doors, taking their time getting to the next one. There's too many men for a few drones and one combat-oriented character to take on, and its impossible to know what kind of backup they had. So we start planning how to get out of this. Apparently, Kimberly had an influence on us all, because we decide on using thrown pepper punch to incapacitate the soldiers, then drive our van sideways into the alley, escaping out of the side door and running. Ex starts putting on her chemically-sealed body armor, and everyone else puts on gas masks. Vents are closed, windows are shut tight besides the driver's side one. Eventually, after what feels like hours of waiting, they get within one car of the van. They're not stopping- it's time for our heroes (I use this term loosely) to escape. Pepper punch grenades fly out the driver's side window, which is promptly shut tight. Most of the enemies still near the truck on overwatch are instantly nauseated, with skin that feels like it's burning. Before the unaffected enemies can react, Psy slams the van backwards into the car behind to make some room, then hits the pedal forward. It works beautifully, with the van perfectly wedged to block foot access to the alley yet let us escape from the side door. The soldiers aim to shoot Psy and Ex in the front seats, but the cover of the van and the awkward angle of shooting both make them miss. Kimberly and Neuro then hop out of the van and get as far as they can. Then, returning to the top of the initiative order again, Ex tries to bluff with a smoke grenade, and hopes they think it's an actual grenade. It doesn't work, but it gives them the extra cover they need. Both Psy and Ex are able to escape the van, and they run down the alleyway. Everyone pulls their gas masks off, and Ex swaps her helmet out for her enhanced vision goggles. After a few minutes of running, the team stops and turns to face each other. Kimberly instantly speaks up. \n\n\"This bullshit is *not* worth 20K! I'm not staying.\" And, just like that, Kimberly starts walking off. But this isn't her last surprise of the day. For dramatic effects, she throws a random vial of chemicals from her briefcase... and gets a critical glitch. She rolls a few dice to find out what drug she threw- it's DMSO Kamikaze; a drug that enhances combat abilities, yet makes the user short-tempered, and makes them actively want to be killing something if possible. The DMSO allows for skin absorption. \n\nThe GM speaks up. \"A crit glitch... Roll 1d3.\" Kimberly rolls 1d3, for which person she hits- one being Psy, two being Neuro, and 3 being Ex. It's a 3. \n\n\"But isn't she wearing chemseal?\" At which point I roll edge... with 0 successes. It hits her in the head, where her helmet used to be. Everyone stares at Kimberly- yet, before they can do something to her, Ex's morals kick in, just in time for the drugs to help. She remembers a young girl and her mom in their car, crying as the soldiers approached. \n\n\"I have to save them.\" Ex starts sprinting for the street they had escaped just a few minutes previously, tossing the goggles on the dirty street and replacing her helmet. Psy is after her just a moment later. \n\n\"YONG, WAIT!\" Psychedel screams after her, running as fast as her legs will carry her. Neuro, after realizing he just heard Ex's real name, tries casting a physical barrier spell to trap her. He gets two successes- which is the same amount of strength Ex has. Ex quickly smashes through it and keeps running. The drain, however, is nearly too much for him- he starts feeling light-headed and woozy. He slaps himself with a stimpatch to remove some of the stun, with a downside- an hour from now, he'd crash hard. Ex, herself, has around half an hour until her kamikaze wore off. She keeps sprinting towards the crashed van; towards the people who need help. Psy keeps sprinting and yelling out. \"WAIT! Yong, think of us! Think of our *daughter!* You're... you're gonna get yourself killed!\" Ex slows a tiny bit, then shakes her head clear and keeps moving. The drugs have brought forward one motivation- save the civilians. Psy reaches out and yells one last time. \"Stop! I... You can't die...\" Ex has her all but blocked out. She has tunnel vision to the end of the alley, the crumpled van blocking the way out to the street. Neuro rounds the corner at the other end of the alley, and gives it one last attempt. He casts physical barrier as high force as he can, using edge to hopefully get a lucky roll and stop her until the drugs wear off. And he does. Just as Ex is about to reach the door, a shimmering dome falls over her, smacking her to the floor as she runs into it. She gets up, launches her shoulder into it- and gets knocked back again. Ex keeps launching her body, but the wall holds. Psy stands on the other side of the wall, tears streaming down her face, just trying to keep herself calm.\n\n30 minutes later, the sun is starting to set, and Ex's drugs are just now wearing off. The barrier dissipates and Psy helps Ex up, before just hugging for a minute. Both are emotionally drained, and with the crash of the drug, Ex is physically drained too. Neuro reminds them, he has 25 minutes or so until he gets knocked out. The three support each other as they limp to Khun Thura's smuggler den (picking up the dropped goggles along the way.)\n\nThe door to the den crashes open as the team steps in, Neuro and Ex falling to their knees as they enter as some form of rest. A big troll walks out. \"And who might you be?\" Neuro, at this point, has crashed from the stimpatch wearing off, and Ex doesn't look too good either. Psy explains the story from the top, and finding this satisfactory, he picks up Neuro and leads them downstairs to his den.\n\nNeuro and Ex both wake up in medical cots in the basement of this small shop, with a few other people nearby. Psy, barely bothering to hide her relationship anymore, is just taking care of Ex. Neuro is being taken care of by Khun Thura. There are a few other people in the room, and we take note of one person in particular- a red-headed woman with green eyes, trying her best to look like a pirate. It's quickly revealed that these people are all runners, and the team has recently lost its leader. Ex, Psy, and Neuro agree they need a replacement for Kimberly, and this new red-headed runner, named Red (Kimberly's replacement PC, since she had some issues with playing Kimberly and wanted to try something new), volunteers- and her payment request is just to kill the captain we had met earlier, for personal reasons. We gladly accept, and checking the list of airfields our Johnson had just sent us, we see one suspect one in particular- that is, it's the same location as the captain gave to us for his private airfield. We head out in an offroader, making our way through the jungle towards the tiny airstrip.\n\nWe pull to a stop a few feet off the small trail, and Red, Ex, and Psy all hop out to start scouting out this airfield and seeing how they'll pull their attack. They eventually decide to attack from 3 different sides and storm the hangar before anyone can even react. As they crawl up towards the hangar, they get a DNI from Neuro: \"There's a car, and they've stopped- it's the captain.\" Red responds, \"As long as you leave him for me.\"\n\nRed, Ex, and Psy all start running back towards the car to hopefully get there in time to help Neuro. Ex arrives first, to see the captain and a few of his henchmen standing around their jeep, questioning Neuro. Ex fires her rifle into one of the two henchmen. He goes down, and a drone fires shortly after at the other nearby. The captain, outnumbered and outgunned, drags Neuro out of the car and holds a gun to his head. \"I'LL SHOOT HIM!\" Red sprints out of the woods and towards him, making it towards his stopped car. Neuro tries to distract the captain by casting Euphoria on him, at a force 6. The captain shakes his head to clear it and smacks him. \"Knock it off!\" \n\nReinforcements arrive. Two generic offroaders pull up, 4 men hopping out of both. An assault rifle-carrying man shoots at Ex- 0 successes. He misses wildly, and Ex sticks her tongue out at him. Another man shoots, but Ex's cyberware allows her to just barely judge get out the path of the bullet as he fires. Then two men are able to flank her, one with a shotgun and one with an HMG. The shotgun fires, and Ex isn't able to get out of the way in time. It hits her right in the chest... and the slug pings off. The HMG, then, hits her with a short burst, putting a few bullets into her armor and her. \n\nEx decides running away is the best choice. She sprints back and slides behind some thick plant life as cover, and uses her drone for suppressing fire on the enemies. Psy, picking up on the plan, sends a grenade their way. If they move, they get hit, and if they don't, they explode. They choose the latter, most dying or being heavily injured. Red, then, sprints over to the captain and stabs him in the side before he can do anything. \n\n\"SURRENDER! WE SURRENDER! STAND DOWN!\" The few remaining soldiers stand down, tossing their guns to the floor. Neuro walks over and starts casting healing spells on Ex, while Red walks the captain up towards the airfield, using her swords as incentive. The team ties up all the remaining survivors, then Psy and the drones watch over the prisoners while Ex and Red go to the back of the hangar, looking for prisoners. They open the door and find a cage full of people. Ex starts cutting the cage open with her miniwelder. \"We're looking for two SK scientists! All of you will be extracted, but please, we need you two up front first.\" The scientists push themselves to the front. \"We-we're here... who are you guys?\" \n\nEx thinks for a second, then opens the cage doors. \"Call us the Purple Hearts.\" \n\nAnd that was the story of how our cast of characters became a legitimate team. The Johnson flew in a few hours later, picked up all of the people we'd found, and paid us before he flew out again. We drove back to the Rangoon airport, got on a private jet, and flew back home. Over the course of a week, this team lost and gained a member, learned more about themselves, and most of all, became a team. Thank you all for reading! There will hopefully be a new session up by the end of the weekend if you're all interested, and sorry for the *huge* post, but it's what we needed to fit all this in!",

        "text": "The game is 3.5 edition D&amp;D in a homebrew setting where the continent is split in two by a massive mountain range. Anyone born north of the mountains detects as evil. Anyone born south of the mountains detects as good. Our party is monsters and barbarians on a combination diplomatic/investigative mission to the 'civilized' folk of the south. The party consists of:\n\n* Kobold sorceror – dragon shaman, has wings and flame breath at this point. Self serving coward.\n* Goblin bard – neutral, has been shanghai'd into this by kobolds, just wants to survive the adventure. Disguises herself a lot.\n* Necromancer/cleric - actually undead in sealed full-plate, but none of the party know. Has a penchant for awakening his undead and teaching them enough for them to get class levels.\n* Human barbarian – typical 'fight more, wench more' barbarian with a greatsword.\n* Orc shaman - a coward from the 'Cockroach Tribe' who's been forced into adventure by his intelligent spear.\n* Half-crystalline troll pugilist/monk. - pro-wrestler. Never breaks kayfabe. More than willing to beat the shit out of everything, lawful neutral edging slightly into lawful evil.\n\nNow, we are not an optimized party. Most people other than the necromancer took fairly unoptimized builds with role play choices and the half-troll was laboring under a LA of +4 or so, so while he had a crapton of Con, plus Regen and DR, his HP total was only slightly higher than the necromancer's. The party was around level 9, IIRC, but might have been higher than that.\n\nWe've been journeying for a while - first coming down from the central plains of the north to the mountain range, then finding a port that is willing to take us on and sail us around to a port city near the biggest of the southern kingdoms. In the process several characters have died. So our initial '3 kobolds + undead + goblin' party has had two of the kobolds die on us, and the barbarian, orc and pro-wrestler are new to the party, picked up in the northern port or shortly before. So the core of the party is the necromancer, the goblin and the kobold. Our notable adventures at this point consist of killing a giant squid and animating its corpse, and setting fire to a feudal lord's castle in a not-Japan island and then escaping via jumping off a cliff into the sea for the zombie-squid to rescue us. We finally arrive in the southern port and are viewed with suspicion, but we aren't actively marauding, the savage races don't have a central government, and we're accompanying a human. Clearly we're either servants, slaves, or adventurers.\n\nWe go to the adventurer's guild tavern and the DM describes a 'shady looking figure in a large hooded cloak' that hangs out in the back, having a meeting with a sneaky assassin-type fellow we ran into once in the north. The large, obvious plot hook is dangling, so after the party confers for a bit, we decide to bite on it and confront these guys. They move upstairs to a room. We follow and enter. We bullshit for a bit, going back and forth, posturing and making threats briefly before talks break down. He's clearly a minion of the BBEG, and it's Go Time. The assassin jumps out a window and vanishes, leaving the rest of us to go too it. We draw our weapons &amp; get ready to punch face. But when the mystery man draws a fullblade, he also flies into a screaming rage. And frenzies. And transforms. Into a werewolf.\n\nChrist.\n\nWhelp, the troll is the tank – his armor class isn't amazing but he has damage reduction in the double digits and Regen, so he steps to the front to be the damage sponge he was meant to be. Kayfabe can't be broken - a boast is made. Werewolf's initiative!\n\nHe gets one attack because he has to move- **CHUNK.** The strike does enough damage, even with reduction, that the troll is at under 10 hp.\n\nOh *shit.*\n\nBarbarian steps up but can't quite make it to the front line in this cramped room. The orc is prodded into getting closer, where he casts some kind of buff spell. The kobold pegs the beast with a fire spell of some description and does piddling damage. Bard shouts down the stairs to the rest of the adventurers in the tavern that there's a berserk werewolf upstairs, and successfully motivates them all to come to our aid. Necro-cleric steps up and successfully sunders the fullblade, removing his big, fancy two-hander, and we hope - most of his damage.\n\nRound 2 – The troll thumps him once, then steps back to try and buy time to regen up, figures without the sword he'll be less of a problem.\n\nUnfortunately, we have forgotten that this is a werewolf. Removing his sword means that he now has two claws and a bite attack free in addition to his big spate of regulars. The Werewolf steps forward and full-attacks.\n\n\"**ROAAARRGGH!**\" Boatload of attacks. Boatload of damage. Necro-cleric is down and dying. Orc is dead. \n\nThe Barbarian charges into the gap, does a pretty good chunk of damage flailing that greatsword around. The Kobold declares 'fuck this' and dives out the window to glide to safety. Gobbo-bard runs over to the Necromancer and tries to heal him. Unfortunately, none of us have been informed of his undead status, and while he's got some fancy magic armor that detects cure spells and spits out double strength Inflict spells to mimic getting healed, he still has to eat the damage from the initial cure first.  Her cure spell finishes the job of killing him before his armor can spit out the Inflict to heal his undead ass. The stairwell and hallway fill with adventurers trying to come to our aid. They succeed at nothing but clogging our escape route.\n\nRound 3 - Troll interposes himself between the bard and the werewolf, goes full defensive, still hoping to buy time.\n\nThe Werewolf foams at the mouth and drops a full attack that hits both the Barbarian and the Troll\n\n\"**RIP AND TEAR YOUR GUTS**\" This hulking maniac drops another bucket of successful and horrifically damaging attacks on us.  The troll is down in the negative 30's, barbarian is dying at -9.\n\nGobbo-bard is now trapped in a room alone with this maniac. Escape is a necessity, not an option. However the hallway is filled with adventurers pouring forward from down the stairs. She is stuck moving 5ft a round against the tide. DOSEN'T MATTER, WHATEVER IT TAKES, GET THE FUCK OUT.\n\nNPC wannabe heroes pour into the room, looking for glory and honor. They find neither.\n\n\"**WARGHLBARGL**\" The werewolf is now doing a fair impression of a blender. The GM doesn't even roll. NPC adventurers begin dying in droves\n\nSo now over half the party is dead. (even if one of them will probably get better because Regen is stupid good, but that fact escapes us for the moment.) We all kind of sit in silence as the DM describes this guy eating a dozen and a half adventurers before leaping into the night and escaping.\n\nThe DM voices the fact that we weren't really supposed to fight that guy, he was 5 levels higher than us, a werewolf, and had Frenzied Berzerker levels. We're all feeling kind of down about how poorly this session has gone when Necro-cleric's player pales as he obviously remembers something we didn't.\n\n“Oh shit. My minions. I have no control now that I'm dead.”\n\nNow the necromancer has been very carefully cultivating a lot of good corpses that he has turned into undead and has been very free with Awakening spells because he wants smarter minions. He had an NPC paladin he raised following us around, and that squid. That fucking squid. Remember how I said we sailed into port?\n\nSo like I said, one of the major highlights of our sea voyage has been the giant squid who attacked, got killed, and was subsequently raised as a minion by the Necro-cleric. It is not merely a giant zombie however. He also awakened it, and since it rolled absurdly well for Int, has been taught wizardry during the long voyage. We used it to foil a couple pirate raids on our ship and as a getaway when we needed to jump off a cliff into the sea on one of our supply stops, and that was severely underusing it's potential. Necro-cleric, being truly dead now, no longer has control over it.\n\nSo the bard makes it out of the tavern and meets up with the kobold. They book it away from the tavern towards the ship, just in time to witness it shatter into matchsticks as **ARCHETEUTHON - UNDEAD LASER-SQUID AND SCOURGE OF THE DEEP** bursts from his hiding place beneath our vessel and begins to raze the port town with thaumic power and tenticular fury. And the goblin and kobold have unfortunate front row seats.\n\nWith the core of the party gone, and the only actual survivor being the troll, who pulled himself out of the rubble of the city about a week later wondering what the *fuck* just happened, we opted to let the game end there. The DM offered to do a retcon/rewind and let us redo the encounter in the tavern but we figured death by kaiju laser squid and the destroyed port city was pretty awesome in it's own right and we let it stand.\n",

        "text": "My group's between RP games; at the moment we're just doing boardgames. However! The other night, the rum was flowing and the mood was silly. \"Lasers and Feelings!\" I hollered, because L&amp;F is the easiest and best RPG to run when you're slightly tiddly. \"I'm GM!\" announced Friend1, which I'm immediately on board for, because he GM'ed our last game of L&amp;F and it was amazing. \"But!\" he continued. \"It's not Lasers and Feelings! It's Claws and Cuteness!\". Friend2 and I are immediately wary, but Friend1 quickly explains the premise; we're kittens that have lived in an attic all our lives. One day our parents go missing, what do? Oh, and we have thumbs. \n\nFine, let's do it. We hash out that Claws is for athletics, aggression and cunning, and Cuteness is for subtlety, knowledge, and D'AWWWW. I lean towards Cuteness, Friend2 towards Claws. I am Smudge the Dexterous, and Friend2 is my stalwart brother, Higglesby the Bat-Friend. \n\nSo the story opens on the attic; parents have been gone for a few minutes/hours/days (time is fluid to a kitten mind) and we're getting anxious. Higglesby consults with his cheiropteran allies, while I busy myself poking around the parts of the attic our parents forbade us from exploring. After a bit of fiddling around, I find the attic trapdoor and it opens, revealing the floor below! Deciding that we will be the exception rather than the rule when it comes to the fatal conclusion of the curiosity/cat combination, we descend into a new world!\n\nThe house we have lived in is abandoned; we're aware of the outside world because of windows in the attic, but this is the first time we've been outside the attic. \n\nSuddenly we hear a crash downstairs, and then voices, which weirdly, we can understand! We scarper back into the attic as we hear footsteps coming upstairs. We hide in our attic as best we can, but the Hu-Mans seem to deliberately coming after us. We break out of the attic, using our cunning kitten-thumbs to open the window, and run out onto the roof, where we are accosted by a pigeon, who we murder out of blind panic. \n\nFrom the roof, we can see that the house has a large back garden, and beyond the broken fence, there's a canal! That'll do as an escape route. We leap from the roof and land on our feet (naturally) just as our pursuers come running downstairs after us. \"There they are!\" they shout. Interesting; they definitely seem to know about us. \n\nWe get through the broken fence, and see that there's a docked canal boat there. We leap aboard and hide in whatever nooks and crannies we can find. We hear our pursuers look around for us, but we're too well hidden. Eventually, they give up, assume we're not on the boat, and leave to look elsewhere. \n\nThe day's been exhausting so we sleep. I awake hungry hours later and go look for food. The canal boat is no longer docked though, now it's drifting! Well, nothing I can do about that. I follow my nose and find something edible, but Friend1 (who by now is on his sixth rum and coke) tells me it's chocolate and I proceed to shit just everywhere. Yay. Friend2 is also exploring, but runs afoul of a gang of river-rats that infest the boat. We get into a scrap and kill a few rats, but they overwhelm us with numbers. I try and talk them down, but they seem ready to kill us. Suddenly, they all scarper at the sound of a gruff Cockney voice. \n\nThe voice belongs to a dog. A chihuahua in fact, sporting a pirate hat and eyepatch. Where he came from, we didn't know or question. Captain Morgan (for that was his name) informed us that if ever we were to get in trouble with the Hu-Mans, he would look after us and use this boat to take us to our next location... the mystical city of Birmingham.\n\nAnd there the first part of our epic adventure ended.\n\nTL;DR - drunk RPG group plays a game about mutant kittens.

        "text": "An Ares Roadmaster APC screeches to a halt in the parking lot of Takagami Towers, the doors opening as it does. Something like 20 armed men rush across the parking lot, in armored suits, carrying SMGs and assault rifles. *Pop! Pop!* Two suppressed shots ring out, the two guards outside the lobby are dead. They rush inside, with 6 men going to the 48th floor, the rest securing exits, defending their position, and some going to the vault. But there was one thing they didn't count on- Mr. Takagami's docwagon biomonitor going off.\n\nThe cast is: \n\nKimberly: The human medic/side-face/kind of combat of the team. She's also huge on chemistry, for combat gases like pepper punch.\n\nEx Machina: a previous character of mine that I hadn't been able to fully explore as a character, so I wanted to bring her back in this campaign. She's a human rigger/street sam.\n\nPsychedel: French/Tir na nOg-raised Elf rigger. She's also a previous character who we wanted to bring back, and due to previous shenaniganery with our characters, her and Ex were married. The GM's condition for this is that they adopted a daughter, which was a 13 year old former-street kid, as a demanding dependent quality. \n\nNeuro: ...Neuro. He's the special one of the crew. He used to be a screenwriter for the show World of Shadows, but got fired for his episodes being too unrealistic (due to him writing them on a cocaine high). He wants to get back in that game, so he decided to join this team as a face to get insight to the real world of running for the script. A narcissistic, coked up, face-mage, human-looking elf.\n\nThe cast all arrives at a big DocWagon building, told to meet the Johnson on the 23rd floor. Ex, Psy, and Kimberly all get there early and wait for this fourth member they were told would join them. They wait. And wait. \n\nNeuro, 2 minutes before the meet is supposed to start, is out in the parking lot, doing a line off of his dashboard. He straightens his hair, then looks in the mirror. \"You can *do* this! You're *Neuro!* The goddamn best runner in town! Yeah!\" His narcissistic tendencies outweigh the green-ness and he enters the lobby, just barely on time for the meet. At this point, we're invited into the room, and discuss the job with the Johnson. This isn't your standard job- we're being hired by DocWagon for 3 days of work as a response team. We get to our bunk, get our gear out of our bags, then almost immediately- \"We have a signal from Takagami towers, from a platinum member! It's only some heart irregularities, but it's platinum, we're sending in HTR! Get your asses to the helicopter!\" Ex and Psy start loading drones while Kimberly and Neuro get everyone's gear loaded, and a few minutes later, we're off. \n\nWe approach the tower, then our radio is hailed. \n\n???: Unknown, please identify or leave this airspace.\n\nEx: We're Docwagon HTR, and we're coming in to land. Please make sure anyone or anything that would block our route to the 48th floor is gone so we can retrieve our patient. \n\nThe radio is silent, then it crackles back to life with a German voice. \"Please, land, and hand over all your weapons when you do. We have missiles pointed at your helicopter, and it'd be a shame if we had to shoot it down. And don't do anything stupid. The hostages wouldn't appreciate it.\" \n\nThe team look at each other, silently, for a minute. Then Ex picks the radio back up. \"Agreed. Landing now.\" Pyschedel lands the helicopter on the roof to a few armed guards, and the rest of the team comes out with their hands up. Pyschedel, however, stays in the helicopter. Neuro and her convince the guards that leaving the drones and leaving Psy in the helicopter is just 'company policy,' and she should stay behind. So Ex, Neuro, and Kimberly go to the hostages on the 48th floor. Kimberly smuggles a few syringes, and Neuro smuggles his spellcasting focus. They finally get to put a face to the voice- and the face is that of Alan Rickman. Hans Gruber starts monologuing. \"We're here because we don't believe in the greed of this company, etc, etc...\" Ex, Neuro, and Kimberly all kind of get bored and walk off to different ends of the room. We start formulating a plan over DNI.\n\nKimberly asks the mage guard if she can go to the bathroom, and the mage escorts her. With the mage out of the room, we start. Neuro casts a force 6 Opium Den. Everyone in the room goes to the ground as if they were suddenly high, and is acting as such. Our GM then says he'll allow Neuro to cast awaken on the teammates to get them off the ground, and we enact our plan. Ex is awakened and picks a rifle off of a guard, then quickly runs over to their decker and cuts the cable to his deck. He suffers the usual dumpshock, then a bullet to the head. As the shot rings out, we cut to Psy, and the guard on the roof approaches her- only to get knocked out by someone coming out of an air duct. Described as the \"Korean, shirtless Bruce Willis,\" he introduces himself as Jin, and says he was trapped here when Gruber started attacking the building. Psy uses this opportunity to rig into the drone swarm and takes a turn to send them out towards the 48th floor. At this point, back with the party, a few guards are shooting at Ex to no avail. Then Kimberly's turn arrives and her player speaks up.\n\n\"I would like to uncap my syringes and run at Hans Gruber.\" \n\n\"Uhh.. alright. What's in them?\"\n\n\"DMSO Pepper Punch.\" And, after an explanation of what this is (basically tear gas+, with DMSO making it work as an injection into the bloodstream), our GM reluctantly allows it. She runs at Gruber, and *somehow,* makes the roll. He gets two syringes, out of nowhere, into the chest. \n\n\"What's the damage code for those?\"\n\n\"Uhh.. 30 stun, combined.\"\n\n\"We're having a serious talk later.\" But for now, he allowed it. Hans Gruber fell to the ground, screaming and convulsing in pain, as one does when injected with a double dosage of Pepper Punch. The mage runs out a second later and flings a spell, but it's resisted. Neuro then casts stunbolt on her, dealing some stun damage, and it goes back to the top of the turn order. Ex scores a kill on the mage, then the drones show up at the window and start shooting at the guards. The two remaining guards after this use their initiative turn to run- right into the waiting arms of their ground-based drones. Police HTR arrive around the same time as the media. Being runners, even with a legitimate purpose, there is some fear of police, so they make an early escape in the helicopter as the news crews get there. Ex and Psy go to the pilots' seats, Neuro goes to write this run up in a narcissistic light for the silver screen, and Kimberly sits in the corner, thinking about her actions. And how to make them more violent. \n\nThis was a prologue of sorts for the session that made us all really go, \"This needs to be on Gametales.\" That one will be uploaded soon if everyone wants to hear it. Until then, thank you for reading!",

        "text": "[Previous Entry](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5l117q/dnd_5e_a_brush_with_death/)\n\n*This chapter holds dark elements that those sensitive to torture or rape may want to steer clear. Nothing graphic is depicted, but sensitive topics are suggested.*\n\n**BARUT**\n\n\n“Baarruut,” Lana sung, “It’s time to wake up.”\n\nLana sat on top of Barut Mirehook, knife in hand, waiting for him to wake. She looked at his battered face, almost impatient for his eyes to flutter open. Oh the expression he would have once he saw that she came out the victor. And he would suffer as she had. But unlike her, Barut would meet death in the end.\n\nThe last thing Lana remembered before waking up in Barut’s prison, was walking about Sharn, hand in hand with some man. He had light blonde hair, like hers, and sky blue eyes. They had bickered off and on, though what about she couldn’t recall. She had also gotten two tattoos; a heart under her right eye and an intricate lace like design under her breast.\n\nShe and her friend had just left the tattoo parlor when a girl, maybe a year younger than Lana, ran past in hysterics. The look, the age, everything about the girl screamed Barut’s doings. Lana quickly instructed her companion to keep an eye out for anyone pursuing as she took off after the girl.\n\nLana entered into an abandoned church building. Caution had suggested otherwise, but when the blonde man caught up, he had said no one was coming. So into the building she went with the hopes to tack on another point toward Barut’s demise. \n\nWhen she had nearly reached the sobbing girl, the young woman suddenly snapped her head up and yelled, “NOW!!” Instinctively Lana would have ran, but she found herself surrounded. She gained some courage when she heard the leader remind the five men to take her alive. Quickly Lana retrieved her daggers from her boots and maneuvered to the closest man. She figured she’d take out as many as she could, but she only managed to sink one of her daggers in before two arrows pierced her back.\n\nWhen she woke, something wet and sticky covered her face. Lana reached up to wipe it away but found nothing was there. Instead she realized how cold her body was. She sat up, her back aching in the process. A shiver ran up her spine. For a moment she cursed her poorly chosen outfit as her thin night shirt hung off her shoulder and her waist high shorts left her legs bare. \n\nLana then heard his voice. She looked in the direction it came from and found Barut talking with a hag. He looked her way and curled his lips into a cruel smile. Barut returned his attention to the hag, bowing to her. She then extended a withered hand and placed it upon his head, her raspy voice saying, “Well done.”\n\nBarut stood up right, the smile still there as he replied, “You’ve seen nothing yet.” He barely looked Lana’s way again as he left  the room. \n\nLana looked about the place. She was in a large cage that had iron bars extending to the ceiling. Cold stone surrounded her. Beyond her cage the room was littered with rugs and various trunks. \n\nShe began to shake. Cold and fear coursed through her. Lana had to escape... but how was the question. The thought of squeezing through the bars crossed her mind, but the hag in the corner made her hesitant. Lana scanned her surroundings trying to spot anything that might help her. Something that she could use as a weapon would have been well received, but nothing was accessible.\n\nBarut’s voice then drew her from her plans for escape. An orb at the foot of her prison began to glow, emitting a rectangular shape that held an image of Barut and a Halfling strapped to a concrete slab. The little man looked inches from death and his bright eyes were full of fear and pain. Blood was everywhere in various stages of coagulation. Lana could only assume that this was a viewing of what would happen to her and it made her stomach churn.\n\n“Do you know what she has done? You say she’s a good woman, but you know nothing of her!” Barut said, whipping the Halfling with a thick, scoring cane. The man yelped in pain, Lana flinching herself. “She has done this to you! She has brought you here!”\n\n*Had I brought the Halfling here?*\n\nThe little man, who took shallow breaths, looked back at Barut. His face was racked with pain, but the look his eyes held was fierce. \n\n“Rin know Lana is a good woman!”\n\n*He knows me?* Lana’s thoughts questioned. She looked more closely at the figure. There was nothing about him that was familiar. Perhaps it was because he was so battered and swollen, but even the voice remained foreign.\n\nThe man quivered as he tried to lift himself up against his restraints. “Rin will see to it that you will pay!” and with that spat in Barut’s face.\n\n“She will be your downfall!” the cruel man retorted, hitting the Halfling a few more times in his rage. Lana gripped herself as she winced. She then watched as Barut smoothed his hair back, taking a few deep breaths. He informed the little man that she was there and that he would get to watch him beat her.\n\nWith eyes wide, Lana watched Barut walk out of the scene. His footsteps soon echoed down the hall and back into her room. She backed into the far corner, keeping her eyes fixed to him, trying to think more quickly what she would do.\n\n*Burn him with fire!*\n\nHer simple fire spell was all she had at her disposal, but quickly she found that that did little to him with his hag friend watching over. Barut had begun to unlock the cage door when Lana sent her spell at him. It would have hit, but it suddenly veered away at the snap of a finger. \n\n“There’ll be none of that,” the hag croaked.\n\nLana could feel her sanity slip away as hysterics threatened to take over. She doesn’t know how she managed to keep it together, but she did. Barut entered her prison with a cat o’ nine tails in hand. Lana threw insults his way, hoping to throw him off his game, but he seemed all the more humored in her desperate tactics. Barut looked up where the rectangular image once floated. It had been replaced by a new orb. All it did was shine a light toward them.\n\nBarut smiled and positioned himself. It then registered to Lana that wherever the first orb went, someone was watching. No doubt it was the Halfling.\n\n“You have know idea what you have done,” he began, walking closer and closer to Lana, tapping the whip handle in his hand. “Your friend,” Barut pointed to the orb, “that is what you’ve done to him.”\n\n“I did nothing to him!”\n\n“Your actions have done this to him!”\n\n“What actions!? What have I done!?” Lana screamed.\n\nBarut jerked the whip, lashing it across Lana’s face. She fell into the bars, gripping them as the pain coursed through her. When she managed to look back at Barut again, he was tossing a glowing object in his hand. He threw it toward her and a smaller, rectangular image appeared. She watched as she, the blonde hair man, and some other woman, attacked Barut and two other men.\n\n“I did that?” Lana questioned, the memory far from her mind.\n\n“Those were good men. They didn’t deserve what you did to them!”\n\n“If they worked for you, then their death was earned!”\n\nBarut pinned Lana in her corner spitting at her, “Women like you must be punished!”\n\nThe room was then rent with the sound of the whip again, followed by the ripping of clothes and the screams of Lana.  Though she couldn’t remember much of anything, she couldn’t help but wonder, would this hell end? Would the pain ever go away? Would the smell of sweat and fish ever leave her nose. Would the memory of stone and Barut’s hot breath fade? Would the grip of his hands disappear? Would the feeling of him inside her vanish?\n\nNo amount of kicking or biting or thrashing could she do to thwart her attacker. Never had Lana felt so alone as the echoes of her cries went unanswered.\n\n\n✻  ✻  ✻  ✻  ✻ \n\n\n[Next Entry](http://iadumija.blogspot.com/2016/10/barut-pt-2.html)",

I've taken all this off the LotJ wiki page. This all happened by players in game using the game's mechanics.\n\nIf you're a Star Wars fan or you've just got that Star Wars itch after Rogue One, I really recommend having a go at this. It's one of the simpler MUDs and you'll pretty much always find someone helpful as long as you join a clan (which is split between the Republic or Imperial at the minute, although you can join engineers if you need to).\n\n---\n\n**[&lt;- Battle Over Hoth](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5mmd2r/legends_of_the_jedi_mud_battle_of_hoth_battle/)**\n\n---\n\n**Battle of Hoth - The Death Star**\n\n---        \n\nWhat awaited the boarding party comprised of six men and two women, seven ARC Troopers and a combat engineer, nobody could have predicted. When the Assassin Corvette finally touched down inside the Death Star's main hangar bays, the boarding team leaped from the boarding ramp with blasters firing on full-auto, expecting to find legions of Stormtroopers prepared for battle. Instead, there was nothing. The Empire had taken great care in completely sealing off the hangar decks from the rest of the ship, effectively cutting off the last hope for the Republic in taking down the monstrosity of a battle station.\n\nNonetheless, traversing into the winding, endless corridors, the boarding party split up into two teams to search every possible corner for a route to get to the battle station's power core. While the battle was still raging in space, even the calm interior of the giant durasteel sphere seemed like a war zone. Panels being blown from the walls, conduits exploding in showers of sparks, shrieks and yells heard echoing throughout the corridors from the deep places of the station.\n\n---\n\n**Hoth is Destroyed**\n[NEWS ALERT] *The screen lights once again, and at it comes into focus, it shows a familiar elderly zabrak sitting behind a desk. Still looking haggard, he speaks with a firm voice that seems very forced.* Sentients of the galaxy, I am Sarit Donoga, here with you again. I come as the bearer of terrible news. We have just been informed that the planet Hoth, stronghold of the Republic, has been destroyed. *He seems to choke up for a moment, and then clears his throat noisily* Several hundred Republic personnel, from nurses to soldiers, were believed to still be on the planet.... our deepest regards go out to their families. The space around the planet's remains is still a terrible war zone. The debris is making the galactic melee even more horrible. Again, we will try to keep you informed as best we can.... may the force be with you all. *The screen fades.*\n\n---  \n\nAfter endless searching, one of the strike teams radioed finding a working central turbolift. While the team was comprised of highly skilled combatants, trained slicers were not among them. Every attempt to override the lockout mechanism was foiled by the highly-advanced electrical systems wired into the monstrosity. As the troopers' hopes of overriding the lift waned, something astonishing happened. The lift began rocketing upwards on its own, the sudden unexpected shift in momentum enough to pummel anyone against the floor. As the troopers recovered, the doors slowly crawled open, as if hesitating to reveal who had summoned the lift. Through the deafening silence came the unmistakable pop-hiss of a lightsaber ignition, the blade of Ba'buir Kama slicing through the air with unwavering accuracy. Stunned by the initial blow, one of the troopers let loose a barrage of full-auto repeater fire at The Eidolon, his rapid saber movements quickly deflecting them back at the other troopers with perfect precision. Continuing the surprise assault, the Sith Lord swept through the turbolift sending deadly arcs of lightning from his fingertips, electrocuting the soldiers where they stood. All but two were sent to the deck in a twitching, unconscious heap, and those two somehow managed to remain standing long enough to fire off a volley of shots into Babuir's chest, sending him reeling in agony down the corridor and out of sight.\n\nMoving quickly to revive the downed troopers, the group hastily got back on its feet, determined now more than ever to get to the central power nexus and destroy the hulking beast from inside its belly. While the stunned Troopers slowly recovered, the two who remained fully conscious set out at once down the corridor, uncertain what laid in wait for them around each and every corner. When word came over the comms about hidden escape hatches found to be scattered throughout the station by the Bothan Infiltration team, the two Troopers immediately knew these hatches would be the only way into the bowels of the ship. Spotting one of these hidden hatches almost instantly, the two crawled deeper into the ship, only to find a labyrinth of identical-looking corridors and bulkheads. Led by determination and sheer desperation alone, they managed to finally locate the central power nexus and one by one deactivate the seven secondary reactor couplings, as well as the central reactor core, effectively draining the vital organs throughout the battle station of energy. They then activated the self-destruct countdown sequence using the remaining energy stored in the buffers, as a final precaution to make sure nobody would ever use the horrible planet-killer ever again.\n\nAs warning alarms blared in every corner of the battle station, the ARC Troopers sped through the halls in a desperate attempt to return to the Assassin Corvette they flew in on. Only one of the Troopers made it back to the ship alive, while four others were trapped inside the power nexus by emergency blast doors. One by one escape pods were being launched as a last-ditch effort to save their lives by the remaining Imperial forces aboard the Death Star, each of which was quickly dispatched by the hail of turbolasers and rockets erupting from the devastating Republic fleet. Not willing to risk the possibility of an Imperial somehow stumbling into the reactor and disabling the self-destruct sequence, the Troopers waited and kept watch inside their durasteel prison, unfaltered by the impending doom inching ever closer as the time on the clock ticked away.\n\nWith under a minute left on the clock, the remaining four Troopers had a decision to choose: remain in the core to ensure the self-destruct was successful, or make a mad dash for the escape pods, abandoning their cause in the hope that no Imperial forces remained on board. One of the Troopers issued the order for the other three to run for the pods, that he himself would wait behind allowing the rest to escape with their lives. As the final seconds ticked off the clock, the station seemed almost sentient, as if it realized these would be the final few moments of its short history, and from within the central nexus of the power station, it activated a hidden escape pod chamber, allowing the lone ARC Trooper safe passage away from utter annihilation as the great sphere's countdown reached terminus and every square inch of durasteel was reduced to smoldering ash in the vastness of space. Pulverized by an incredible blast, the charred embers of the recently-destroyed ice world Hoth mixed freely with the remains of its destroyer, in an ending too poetic to ignore.\n\n---\n\n**Battle of Hoth - The Aftermath**\n\n---        \n\nWith the destruction of the Death Star, and the death of the Emperor, the Grand Imperial Union crumbled. The figurehead of the Stormtrooper Corps, the infamous Commander Varn Andras was captured by the Jedi, and taken into custody. The Grand Imperial Union was essentially no more, with only tiny remnants of resistance left. These were mostly focused around the region of Kuat. Kessel, Korriban and the old Hoth system were removed from galactic navigation charts, their locations mostly forgotten as relics of an era best forgotten.\n\n---\n\n**THE END**\n\n---",

However, a few of the faster ships in the Imperial fleet were waiting just a single sector outside of Hoth space. The Fleet Admiral had guessed correctly where the attack would take place. It was an anxious few minutes, waiting for the Death Star to arrive. The situation on Coruscant was getting progressively worse, but the New Republic decided that the battle they were about to undertake had more military value than defending Coruscant from the Grand Imperial Union’s army. Finally, the Death Star arrived, bringing with it its support fleet of Imperial Star Destroyers. Immediately the Death Star headed towards the planet, the ISDs starting to arrange themselves into a fighting formation.\n\nThe New Republic immediately responded, turning their ships towards the attackers, and instructing their squadron leaders to scramble their ships. The Battle of Hoth was about to begin in earnest.\n\nAs the first few waves of fighters hit each other it was a close battle. The starfighters were giving as good as they got. Several A-Wings and Sith Raider spacecraft were destroyed. Then suddenly an Imperial Star Destroyer erupted into flames, its shields having failed moments before. The onslaught had dealt its first major casualty and it came in the form of an Imperial warship. Things progressively got worse for the Grand Imperial Union’s fleet as they steadily lost capital ship after capital ship to the New Republic Navy. Very few of the Republic’s ships were getting damaged, and the battle seemed to be turning massively in their favour.\n\nDouble Admiral Jhoira Ghitu, from the engineering company Cygnus Spaceworks arrived in the system, bringing with her the ground forces that had yet to arrive at Hoth. Slicing into the computer systems aboard the Death Star, Ghitu’s Assassin-Corvette made several attempts at landing aboard the Death Star, but was repulsed each time. She had to take refuge aboard the MC90 belonging to the Vice Admiral, and was allowed to refuel and recharge her shields before trying again.\n\n---\n\n**Coruscant Burns**\n[NEWS ALERT] *The screen lights again, and at it stabilizes it shows an elderly zabrak man sitting behind a desk. Looking rather haggard, his suit seems to have been thrown on, and his eyes are bloodshot. There is a slight quiver in his voice as he begins to speak* Sentients of the galaxy. I am Sarit Donoga, editor for Galactic News Incorporated. I come to you tonight with news of the terrible events that are unfolding. As I speak, lives are being lost by the thousands. There is an epic battle raging over Hoth. The amassed fleets of both the New Republic and the Grand Imperial Union are locked in mortal combat, and both sides are taking heavy losses. One source reports that the Union's Death Star is also being prepared to reduce another planet to rubble. The surface of Coruscant is burning, with reports coming in non-stop of bodies paving the streets. We will attempt to keep you informed, viewers, as best we can. Our thoughts go out now for the families and friends of all those who have died, and we thank the force for their heroics today. Today is a day when our galaxy begins a great change. For better, or for worse, we will be there with you, keeping you informed. May the force be with you all. *A tear is caught in the light, reflecting from the editor's cheek, and the screen fades.*\n\n---        \n\nA public ship, unknowingly to the New Republic containing the Emperor Ba’buir Kama, streaked out of hyperspace into the middle of the battle. It was immediately tractored aboard the Death Star, and very little was thought about it at that moment in time.\n\nWhen Ghitu attempted her next forced landing she was instead tractored aboard the Death Star along with her ARC Commando cargo.\n\nRadio frequency messages began flooding across the starsystem as the battle-station’s main laser was being prepared to fire, its target seemingly the planet of Hoth itself. Evacuation messages began to go out all over the planet in the hopes that people might find the time to save themselves before the massive burst of energy vaporised the planet. There was nothing that the Fleet over Hoth could do to help as the battle-station’s laser began to light up a bright green, and then plunge its way into the heart of the Ice Planet. Enraged, the New Republic Admiral redoubled his efforts to bring the monstrosity to its knees.\n\nThe Imperial Fleet, by now, was almost entirely destroyed, with the New Republic having lost a single Nebulon-B Frigate and a few squadrons of A-Wings. The Death Star hadn’t given up yet, however. The very same laser that had destroyed the planet of Hoth was now turning its way towards the MC90 manned by the Vice Admiral of the New Republic fleet.\n\nAs the battle-station fired, the ship belonging to the Vice Admiral erupted into a huge fireball of burning atmosphere and ordinance. His ship was gone in an instant, leaving half of the New Republic fleet completely without direction. However, the Imperial fleet was by now completely decimated, with just the Death Star left to try to fend for itself. Its energy reserves, having been massively depleted already, began to dwindle, and the surviving ships in the New Republican fleet settled in for the long siege.\n\n---\n\n**[The Death Star &amp; The Aftermath -&gt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5mqs7g/legends_of_the_jedi_mud_battle_of_hoth_the_death/)**\n\n---",

Antarian Rangers and Jedi Knights are the first to infiltrate the base, swiftly followed by members of the New Republic Army.\n\nThe infiltration team, which included one of the Bothans from the original Death Star mission, discovers nothing, although the very absence of anything is in itself suspicious as it seems that the entire engineering team of Cygnus Spaceworks had relocated to the safety of Korriban, the Grand Imperial Union’s base in the Horuset system.\n\nWith this information, the New Republic Army leaves the Chommell system, but shortly afterwards receives a warning from the Grand Imperial Union simply stating that the next target had been chosen. This ominous warning forced the New Republic to quickly head for the Chommell system, and back to Naboo, but they were all too late. GNI Reports and witness accounts had already described the total vaporisation of the planet by the battle-station. The galaxy is once again horrified as the Grand Imperial Union shows its willingness to kill billions in their quest to re-establish a Galactic Empire.\n\n---\n\n**Battle of Hoth - The Invasion of Coruscant**\n\n---        \n\nTensions were high in the New Republic. People were not sure which planet would be the next target of the massive super weapon, The Death Star. Constant vigilance was being maintained whilst the Grand Imperial Union planned its next assault. The Fleet Admiral of the New Republic was making his own plans to assault the Death Star in orbit of Korriban, the planet that the Grand Imperial Union was using as its base of operations. All of the soldiers were getting ready for the assault, and the ships in orbit of Coruscant were being prepared to jump.\n\nReports suddenly came in of Stormtroopers landing secretly on Coruscant. More and more began to filter through the galactic communications, and the New Republic began to mobilise its troops to counteract the threat that these Stormtroopers represented. Some of the New Republican slicers then reported that the Death Star appeared to be on the move. Fleet Admiral Balthor decided that Hoth was the likely target, and changed the target for the strike from Korriban to Hoth. A small garrison was left to defend Coruscant, the New Republic unwilling to change their plans at the last minute.\n\n---\n\n**[Battle Over Hoth -&gt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5mmd2r/legends_of_the_jedi_mud_battle_of_hoth_battle/)**\n\n---",

Their mission was to infiltrate the various systems on the battle-station and retrieve some plans that were stored inside the mainframe computer. The mission was entirely secret, known only to those that were taking part in the operation.\n\nTo begin with the mission went as planned, but very swiftly an alarm was set off when the security seal on a door was sliced. Shortly after a human was spotted wandering the halls of the Death Star, and the Bothans knew that they had to work fast. Not long after this, things began to get a bit more difficult.\n\nReports were coming out that a few of those in the infiltration team were dead, and that there were Stormtroopers wandering the halls on the insertion level. The turbolift was blocked off by these forces. One of the bothans managed to make it to another level, and proceeded to hack several of the mainframe terminals. When half the infiltration team lay dead, this individual decided that he had done all that he could, and went on to use an escape pod to land on the surface of Korriban, and then make his way to safety.\n\nEventually a single female Bothan was left wandering the halls, running from Stormtrooper patrols and looking for an exit other than the turbolift. She was growing desperate, and managed to escape the clutches of the chasing Imperials a couple of times. Finally, after wandering for several minutes, she spotted a small hatchway to the side of the corridor. Urged on by her luck, she quickly scaled the ladder and disappeared to another level of the battle-station. What she found when she got there was a mainframe terminal, a model exactly like those that she had been trained to hack into. She swiftly went about doing just that, and took the plans that came out of the printing compartment.\n\nOnce the Bothan was finished, she decided to take a look around for other mainframe terminals nearby, but soon realised that this was probably a bad idea and turned around to walk back where she had come. There stood a Stormtrooper with his back turned to her. Realising that she was already pushing her luck too far, she swiftly snuck past the Stormtrooper, and into an escape pod, following the other survivor down onto the surface of Korriban, and to safety.\n\nAfter being smuggled away from Korriban, the two bothans managed to reach Coruscant and present their findings to the Chancellor of the New Republic.\n\n---\n\n**[Naboo is Gone &amp; The Invasion of Coruscant -&gt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5mfi56/legends_of_the_jedi_mud_battle_of_hoth_naboo_is/)**\n\n---",

Each one had a different color and if you clicked on it, it would say the name of the color. If you clicked this big wide brush with brown paint it would yell in a low-mid monotone voice, \"BROOOOOWWWWWN.\" \n\nThat's all I remember and I wish I had more information but please help me remember the game so i can get some sleep",

        "text": "First time poster, so bear with me. For those of you who aren't familiar with the game, Freemarket is a super futuristic, sandbox style game with a card based conflict system. The setup is that you (the players) are on a space station that has adanced to the point where there is no such thing as hunger, disease, or even death. It is futuristic to the point that if you are killed, or even hurt, the space station has a system that will just 3d print you a new body/organs/limbs and implant your old memories into it.\n\nPart of character creation is that every character has to make up their own short term/long term memories (that the gm draws content for missions from), it's worth it to mention that if your body is destroyed/perfect deathed, you lose some of your short term memories, included the memories of what just happened to kill you. \n\nEnter Zig. Now Zig (a nefarious character that spans across most games I run) was a Thin Slicer, a personal able to extrapolate and sift through data to determine trends and fads that will be popular, then introduce them into the general populace for flow (cash). Zig was known for a myriad of things, but most notably for creating a certain fad that involved people eating their own organs many years ago.\n\nIn game, I get a ping (PM) from a group of guys who are excited to have finally found the illustrious Zig. We arrange a meeting and it turns out, they are trying to bring back the auto-cannibalism trend. As Zig enters the room, he is greeted by 3 people. Two men in the MRCZ (guild) and another man sitting at a dinner table.\n\nThey explain to me the dilemma. The man they are trying to convince to eat his own innards is having a difficult time making the initial plunge. He starts saying that every time he tries to cut himself, he can't stand the pain. Even after assuring the man that the stations medics will immediately print and repair him, he can't muster enough strength to carry out his own disembowelment.\n\nNow, there are multiple skills and abilities, but the one I decide to use is called Flood/Bleed. It allows me to leech people's memories or feeling and emotions, alter them, and then replant them without their knowledge. So the obvious answer to me, is to replace the feeling of pain when he cuts himself, with a feeling of something nice. Maybe the feeling of hugging and cuddling puppies.\n\nSo I decide to stroll on over to the 3d matter printed puppy shop to grab some memories from an unsuspecting victim. As I greet the printer technician, she basically curses me out and refuses to let me use her memories. Upon approaching her a second time, she flips me the bird and I decide I have had enough. Now you have to make physical contact to Bleed memories, so I grabbed her middle finger and broke into her mind by force.\n\nWhat happened next can only be described as a Looney Toons/Tom and Jerry-esque battle of epically slapstick proportions. Including but not limited to : giant hand fist fights, drawing large animated dogs and sending them to attack each other, frying pan attacks...etc. In the end, it was only a narrow victory for me with a compromise.\n\nI failed to get the exact memory that I wanted of the puppies, but instead I had stolen the memory of this womans grandmother. Every warm and fuzzy moment she ever had,  especially her last hug. As as I release her hand she forgets everything about her grandmother, in fact even that she ever existed in the first place.\n\nWith that taken care of, I trudge back to MRCZ headquarters, and begin the process of replacing this guy's feelings of pain with the stolen warm and fuzzies of grandmother memories. Unfortunately, I botch the shit out of it, almost scramble the guys brains, and leave him with strange memories of an old woman he has never met before. \n\nI give the guild members a bullshit reason to excuse myself and tell them that i will be back to fix it, then promptly exit stage left before they could interject. After doing some research, the GM informed me that the guild was going to try to recruit me, and if I said no. They were going to keep \"deathing\" me to erase my short term memory so I would forget turning them down, then rinse and repeat. \n\nShortly after finding this out, Ole Zig turns into a ghost, and goes off the grid and lives to fight another day.",

Either because they did not like the council, or they knew that his son would kill him eventually (they feared what the power was doing to him), or just wanted to find a way to hold it over him when the time was right. \n\nDuring the final Senatorial debate to be named emperor one of his enemies brings his son out in chains and tell the public the horrors that he had done.

        "text": "so I don't know how often Ill be updating this, but Ill make sure to do so whenever a good tale pops up in the campaign.\n\nalso please excuse the writing style, this was originally a bunch of messages sent to a friend to share the story with them, they encouraged me to toss it up here.\n\nfew important context notes: \n\n1) pathfinder with some changes/altered/homebrewed stuff, like the elemental class the one player has.\n\n2) the world is our world... but mythology is real! all mythology! largely leaving Christian,Muslim,Jewish etc. in the background because the Gm didn't want to offend anyone (new gm) and because he found the other myths more varied. the year is 20XX but because magic is a thing the industrial revolution only kinda happened. the world wars happened, and were vastly different- my character was involved mostly in WW1 and it shaped his point of view.\n(Ill happily answer any questions about the game world in the comments)\n\n3) I am joining the party at level 9, I was introduced during the Christmas session, and after helping there continue to adventure with the party because knowledge is power, and that paladin has a mighty fine looking skeleton.\n\n4) We are Canadian, so we tend to say back home, or etc. we are referring to Canada instead of the US, Hence some of the characters. (and my spelling of certain words)\n\n5) I have never played a Wizard before, so things are gonna get interesting, I made some default \"Spell Day\" layouts for: average day, \nCombat heavy, Necro, and stealth/info getting, to help speed things up\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nso the cast of characters: \n\nSir Micheal of Canmore- 892nd in line for the British throne, is a paladin (Mountie) gets his powers from Captain Canuck the demigod leader of the RCMP, is a rather nice guy, knows lots of languages so he can say you're under arrest to people in their native tongue. \n\nKalden Derova or Inquisitor Derova- Mountie (Internal affairs office) \nis a lot more \"the ends justify the means\" than the paladin. was absent from this session. more to come on this one. \n\n____ the Valkyrie- A synthesist summoner If Im not mistaken, the eidolon is attached to her magic armour? Im not entirely sure I understand all the the details, seems like a cool setup- has wings etc. anyways, is typical valkyrie etc. cares for the souls of fallen warriors, is from asgard eats alot, drinks a lot, sleeps a lot, is eh on the laws of mankind. (as far as I can tell)\n\nZelac Blackstar- the Necrom... I mean Wizard... yes totally Wizard...\nis actually a Wizard cause classes, anyways is a Kayal (cause the name fetchling is actually an insult) which the DM and I agreed are from Svartalfheim, fought during the WW's during ww1 when a gas attack melted a lot of his friends and soldiers around him he raised corpses to attack- see's it as better to send a corpse over the trench walls than some innocent 18 year old kid (or less) also.... knowledge is power and whatnot. is profession (Doctor) Carries donor cards everywhere with him to hand out to people, skeleton is checked off by default...  first introduction of him to the party they misheard Zelac as Salad and it stuck, constant discussion re: the type of salad has continued. \n\n\"Pedro\" the Elemental- formerly magus, due to jumping in this machine that splits and combines spirits etc. Pedro is now a custom class- that the DM wrote, can shift between the elemental types- Pedro isnt his real name its Falcata, but like Salad.... oh the irreverence of players. Was absent from this session.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nso rough sketch of the plot I had going in: Party is in China, which has been isolationist for hundreds of years, bad things are happening, the party is trying to overthrow the emperor cause he's a) bad for his people and b) pretty sure he's part of the over-arcing plot of a cult trying to drain magic from the world and keep it all for themselves.  OOC I know b) IC Im along for the ride right now, but I dont mind- there is knowledge and power to be had!\n\nCurrently the party is being sent into this wrecked lab- basically the lab was being used to make hybrid magical creatures or to distill their essence for the bbeg's group- we were sent in to clean up the mess the PC's made on the last visit and make it safe to investigate\nso there's rooms like the cages- then the library, lab, colesium, and admin\nmost of the cages are empty, we catch and toss some minor things back away\nthis whole lab is underground by the way. we have a set of 5 senior priests helping clear this black evil goo that was the result of an aspect of evil escaping (the Elemental just pulled random calligraphy seals off a door, not knowing they were what was binding the aspect) this slows travel progress through the lab.\n\nwe go to the library- 9 imps bouncing around, I cast black tentacles, grapple, 7 of them, the valkyrie carries the paladin into the air, chasing the last 2 around the room. we kill/knock them out- we stuff them in a cage and seal it\nnext task, check on the machine that combined/split things and generally made a mess of stuff\nwe go to the lab! we find a TENGU! (an appropriate mythical one, not the usual pathfinder race) a quick knowledge roll means there's no way we can fight this thing, we talk to it- its nice, it wants to just learn, we leave, deciding its not causing problems right now.\n\n\nTo the collesium!\nwe find the red and blue oni (ogre basically)turns out it was a gold oni that the party split last time they were there, we have to put it back together and subdue it.we basically piss them off, have them chase us into the lab, the tengu browbeats them into submission, re-combines them and has it go sit in a corner, we are politely asked to stop bothering the tengu- we explain that researchers and whatnot will show up eventually, but ok we are leaving \n\nwe catch other minor things, and exit\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nSO MAJOR PLOT POINTS FOR ME TIME! we meet an Immortal who explains some things for me, and tells us the plan on what to do next. Basically: China's emperor is in the pocket of the BBEG cult- there are 8 immortals- basically demigods of china that are leading the rebellion we are stirring up so the BBEG cant drain china's magic and use it to obliterate people. 2 cities we have to \"topple\" before we can march on the forbidden city and the emperor, Shanghai and Beijing- we are in Hong Kong. We go to Shanghai first- via Taiwan - anyways we send our steamship back to Canada (apparently we had one of those, but it sticks out like a sore thumb) \n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nWe begin travelling across the island of Taiwan\n\nthe first night at 3am, me and the paladin are up (ring of sustenance!) a thick fog has rolled in, staying just outside of our fire's area \n\na thick MAGIC fog\n\nwith evil creatures moving in it says the paladin, toss more wood on the fire, fog shrinks back so I plant torches all around the camp, fog shrinks further back- but then almost pushes forward. the Valkyrie has decided to stay asleep during this by the way.\nI say f*ckit, I have slept, I can do this, cast wall of fire around the camp, concentrate till dawn.\nwe find bootmarks, scuff marks and some spots where they panicked and ran off when I made the wall of fire.\n\nwe continue travelling the next day. we find a nice town with a friendly Japanese innkeeper and his wife, we stay there for the night.\n3am, paladin and necromancer are up, having a drink and talking we decide to check on the dogs in the kennel open the door, fog is rolling in we look at each other, sigh and close and lock the door.\n\nwe put the paladins armour on, pour another drink, sit by the hearth and listen to scratching outside\nso the rest of the party has slept through this twice by the way, so did the innkeep, so they think we are crazy\nwe continue to the city of taipei, where we want to find a ship to shanghai, we get stuck behind a caravan, thanks to travelling light we are able to maneuver around them without loosing any time. (paladin and I spend the whole time looking nervously for fog, the Valkyrie laughing at us)\n\n\nso we putz around taipei, buy some stuff, talk to some crews, find a crew that will take us there in the morning! we find a nice inn, we get 5 rooms. the paladin and I both sleep right away in shifts, are up by midnight and are sitting in the same room watching out the window, the door locked, all that- just waiting, watching, \n\nwe see the fog start to roll in at midnight\nwe rouse the party and get them in our room,  bar the door with the dresser, the window with the bed (the window had no glass, just shutters)\n\nwe here the scratching and scuffling at the door, then 3 bangs\n\nwe stay silent...\n\n3 louder bangs\n\nsilence\n\nthey try to force the door, the Valkyrie holds the dresser against it firmly\n\nsilence\n\nthen they bang on the door, but at the same time we can hear two of them ripping the shutters off the window, the Valkyrie goes to hold the window, flipping a bed up against it, the paladin holds the door, and I prep something extra special. \nso the two of them manage to break down the bed, we get a description of them, leering masks, clawed feet, 6' humanoids- basically generic Asian demons was the idea. the very second I have an opening a brilliant green fireball rips past them to detonate behind them, catching them in the radius, but not the party.\n\nthey are hanging on a wall and weren't expecting it, no reflex save\ni used harmful surge (costing me a lot of HP)\nit was an empowered fireball, harmful surge made it a MAXIMIZED EMPOWERED FIREBALL.\nthe street goes from night, to eerie green day in an instant, I burn away a ton of the fog, leaving 6 more charred corpses in the street, as well as the two that were on the window\npaladin uses a lay on hands to bring me to full health as soon as the shock wore off\nthe fog retreats and we can tell there were more demons in it seeing the shadows fading away and the Paladin's detect evil\n\npaladin and I are basically bro's at this point and share an awesome we told you so moment with the party.\nthe bodies disappear, but we find a tetsubo- an evil.. magic.. tetsubo\nI decide to figure out what exactly is going on\n\nspellcraft check of 32 later- the island is out of wack, everyone's chakra's/spirit/juju whatevs is a tiny bit out of alignment, like shifted 3\" to the left, well only the people that were born here\nexcept... the kitsune- they are either centered or wayyyy out\nso I send the paladin to find any priests, churches, puppies etc. to keep him out of my hair, I mean see if there is any lore regarding this\nI snag a kitsune and offer a couple gold for a chat\n(one of the centered kitsune first, and yes i did have the interrogate spell prepared)\nTurns out that's basically how its always been, the centered people get killed if they stray further than the docks, the people off center have this compulsion to stay on the island, she's staying cause family, blah blah blah, we decide we cant help cause we have a ship leaving and the rebellion is time sensitive, but we will come back. I get her address and let her know we may come back one day (didn't even have to use interrogate, the 2 gold did all the work I needed)\n\nWe hop on the boat go to shanghai, meet up with the two immortals- which live outside of shanghai in a bamboo grove\nparty has a little downtime- cut to individual character montage- Paladin praying for strength, buying gear etc. Inquisitor planning with the immortals, Valkyrie buying new gear- Elemental drinking\nme...\nI managed to make a spellcraft check to reverse engineer detect undead to make it detect corpse (kinda, not super accurate but eh)\nsession ends on a big dramatic set of cutscenes, praying, planning, shopping, drinking, and me... dredging 2 corpses out of a lake in the middle of the night.",

        "text": "Way back in 2011, my best friend and I started up a Pathfinder group in our home town, and met a couple of really cool guys.  The group has survived to this day in one format or another, with players coming and going and us even switching into different systems, but today's story is about that first group and my first encounter with a near TPK.\nMy best buddy was GMing the game in a home-brewed setting with a few house rules scattered about but otherwise it was a pretty standard affair.  Until we hit the shire we were traveling to.\n\nThe party at the time was myself, a Halfling Rogue, an Elf Wizard who had recently joined, and a human cleric whose house we played at. The plot was pretty standard stuff, princess is kidnapped by evil cabal, we rescue princess only to have the King and Queen almost immediately die but she is totally not an evil clone or anything of course not &lt;/sarcasm&gt;.  She had sent us off to collect an amulet that she claimed was a family heirloom, with refusal resulting in our deaths so being the good little players we were, off we went.  When we arrived at the shrine, however, we discovered a few snags.\n\n1. The shrine was protected by several armed guards who did not want us to go in (saying things about how they were stopping \"a great evil from being released or some such malarky)\n\n2. Said shrine was in a different country, and taking the amulet by force could start a war if things were not handled carefully.\n\n3. We forgot to bring proof that we were in fact in the employ of the princess-now-Queen, and so the guards did not believe us and we had no leg to stand on.\n\nAnd finally 4. The Cleric was not a patient man, and thus attacked the guards.  I managed to convince the party to not kill the guards so we could stop an international incident, which lasted until all the party except the Cleric had been knocked out, with none of the guards being incapacitated.  The cleric, deciding enough was enough, invoked his gods name, and with the blessing of Sarenrae Burning Hand'd the shit out of the guards.\n\nOnce we were up, and since we had already caused an international incident, we decided to add breaking and entering to our rap sheet, and decided to just take the damn amulet and cheese it before the cops arrived, or someone noticed, or we were attacked by a dragon or something (our DM was very creative in finding ways to make us think and act quick).  After a brief battle against a wright, who was also guarding the amulet for some reason, we finally had the object in hand and began our long trip back to the castle.\n\nExcept this thing was radiating so much Evil magic aura voodoo that there was no way to miss it.  On our walk back we came up with a plan to not let the young Queen of a nation, who was already at the least very unhinged by the death of her parents and seemed to be teetering on the edge of full-on Red Queen Disorder have the evil radiating artifact, as nothing good could come of this.  We decided to hide the amulet behind anew magic shield we had recently found in a brief dungeon crawl in hopes of hiding the amulets aura.  When we entered the Queen's court, however, everything started to fall apart.\n\nThe Queen demanded we hand over the amulet we obviously had, because we would not return without it.  We countered by saying the shrine had been ransacked by the time we arrived, and the amulet gone.  She counter-countered by having her court Wizard confirm that yes, there was a very strong magical aura coming from the group and specifically from our shield.  Damn.\n\nWe tried to convince the Queen that we had in fact found this new shield recently (a truth) and that the Wizard must be sensing the magic coming from that (technically a truth) and that there was nothing behind the shield (also technically true, as the amulet was in between the Cleric's backpack and shield, and thus from the Queen's perspective in FRONT of the shield).  The Queen decided to just kill us at this point.\n\nThe Wizard, thinking fast, grabbed the amulet from the Cleric's bag and \"suddenly realized\" that the amulet she was speaking of was the one we had found and were trying to figure out; we hadn't realized this was THE amulet!  The Queen demanded we hand if over, as she claimed she was the rightful owner, and the Wizard, in a moment I will remember forever, simply stated:\n\n\"No. Finders Keepers.\"\n\nThe courtroom was stunned; had the Wizard just said NO to the Queen?  A guard walked up and tried to pry the amulet from his grasp, upon which the Wizard cast a Shocking Grasp in an attempt to discourage the man.  Unfortunately the Wizard rolled max damage and now we had killed a member of the Queens Guard, which resulted in a hilariously one sided battle. \n\nHighlights included the Wizard being swarmed by a dozen guards and being knocked out when trying to cast Shocking Grasp again; the Cleric desperately trying to keep us awake and healthy and then finally giving up and trying to fight, only to be knocked out with extreme prejudice, and myself grabbing the amulet from the unconscious Wizard, downing a potion of Spider Climb and making a run for the wall, in an attempt to go through a window to safety because seriously fuck those guys, ending with me being shot down by some archers and kicked asleep.\n\nWe awoke an unknown time later, battered and bruised in an unfamiliar desert-y area, with a note taped to our fronts, but THAT is a story for another time...",

        "text": "*I posted this on the discussion board of Unreal Worlds. The story of an idiot. (First 12 hours of playing). Unreal Worlds is a roguelike survival game based on Finland in medieval times.*\n\nI was left outside of a village. Full of tents and random people doing their own thing. I talked to a few and got to know their names and asked most of them to trade. However, they keep telling me whatever I pick up I can trade. I only found stakes and thin tree logs and nothing of interest. It wasn't till much later I knew how to enter the tents and find the good stuff.\n\nI left the village and built a shelter on the other side of the lake. I really enjoyed fishing there. I was good at it and seem to catch enough to keep me feed well. It was also good that I know the best way of cooking fish.\n\nAfter a few days and many fish later I decided to do a ritual and go track some game. I don't know if the Gods were listening or I was extremely lucky because as soon as I went on the hunt I found a herd of stag which I managed to get only a few feet from. I created a few javelins as well as a spear which I didn't need as the first throw was true and killed him instantly. Little did I know that would never be that easy again.\n\nI skinned my trophy and managed to bring back over hundred pieces of meat which I quickly roasted it all. I can still remember how delicious it was. So much better than fish. Since I carried it everywhere with me I found cutting and moving logs and wood to be difficult and the meat slowed me down but I wanted to keep it with me so I could eat every time I felt peckish.\n\nAfter a while though. I don't remember how long it was all my meat went off. But that didn't stop me. I kept eating it and I kept throwing it up but I kept eating it. I didn't want to waste my meat. After all it was a whole stag and that stag was huge. There didn't seem to be long term effects so I never wasted food. \n\nI wanted an axe and a bow and went into a village and found what I wanted. The villagers weren't happy with my rotten food. Even the delicious fish wasn't enough. They wanted my clothes and my fine knife which I refused to give them. So, I decided to walk out with it. I heard them yelling saying I must pay for them and so I bolted. I kept looking behind me and maybe I shouldn't have and they stopped me. I said I'm not paying and they called me a thief and suddenly there was a sharp pain in my stomach. I blacked out. I woke up in a random place and I checked my belongings. All my stuff was there. They just took what was theirs. I walked a few minutes still feeling the pain and found the same village. I guess they were still ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at me since they yelled at me calling me a thief still and again ANOTHER sharp pain in the stomach and I once again blacked out.\n\nWaking up again with two stab wounds to my stomach I decided to eat and finish eating my rotten meat. Maybe it has healing properties? I found another village and found the village Shaman. He says he will help treat my wounds. I agreed hoping he doesn't want anything in return as all I had was small amount of roasted fish.\n\nI think he was a phoney. It didn't seem to be healed. I still have two holes in my abdomen but he did teach me how to chant and dance which I have tried a few times but I felt like an idiot. I'm not sure if it worked so I only do it occasionally.\n\nAfter traveling some time I realised I could make bandages. By jolly I'm an idiot so I ripped my undershirt and made a bandage and was going to wrap it around myself but needed herbs. Hmm I found some berries but they didn't work. I later found some unknown herbs and leaves. Not sure if they were poisonous or not so I ate them to check. Seem fine so I put them on my bandage. Did it help? Well I only covered one and both wounds eventually healed leaving only a scar so probably not. Probably better than those shamans.\n\nAfter walking to what seems like days and getting lost I finally found that there is a map and I know where my shelter was. My shelter was special only because of my fishing spot and all the wood I had waiting there. I could have set up camp anywhere but that shelter held a special place in my heart so I managed to get back.\n\nI got back and I was starving. I had no food. Berries I found didn't help much. I was desperate and decided to try and eat some of the food in my local village. After all, if I don't have it on me, they can't actually charge me right? I was right. I ate the food and left empty handed. No one chased me. However, when I went back they said I owe them for the food. Lucky enough I made a few bowls and they really wanted my javelins and fish. They wanted a lot for just some small amounts of meat however I didn't want any more holes in me.\n\nI started building my house. Cutting down many trees and turning them into logs taking many days and ended up making 3 walls. I'm making progress and even went on some successful hunts. \n\nAfter making progress and managed to buy a bow and arrows (which costed my clothes) I ended up getting cold. I couldn't even sleep at night. So, I decided to go on a hunt. Get some leather and make some clothes since I'm practically naked. Walked around and failed a few attempts in skinning squirrels. Lost sight of some reindeers. Then I see it. The biggest (and last) game. It was a brown bear. I was a little worried but I figured hey I got bow and arrows. I have a crap ton of javelins and I would be able to kill it and get a heap of leather. This is my chance.\n\nI was about 4 metres away from this bear. I got my bow out and managed to shoot 4 arrows which never got near it. Hmm I needed to practice more so I get out my javelins since I'm much better at it. The bear hasn't even noticed me yet. I threw my first and it missed. I think I ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it off since it started charging. I threw another and not sure if I hit it or not as he came fast. I think I threw another. Don't remember because he was right on me. I felt intense pain as he swiped at me. I started running still feeling pain against my back. He must have gotten my legs because I fell then blacked out right after. A bear ate me. Lesson: Bears are fast. ",

Something wasn’t right and it left her with a pit in her stomach.\n\nA twitch jerked her left shoulder up, startling Lana a moment. That was part of the the reason she felt unsettled. Her hands kept shaking. Tremors that wouldn’t leave. Last night was bad, but surely not the worst thing she’s experienced. The minotaurs that broke into the guild certainly did a number on her, a faint line of the ax visible near her neck. Still, pain doesn’t seem like something that would weigh upon her mind. Maybe it was because she had passed out, like she had when fighting Barut.\n\nWith shaking fingers, Lana put them to work. She was grimy from yesterday’s events. Dried blood covered her hands and torso, while her hair seemed to have been saturated in it. There was also something else, something thick and clear that she remembered waking up to after blacking out in the fight. It was like molasses had been rubbed all over her face.\n\n*Damn it! What happened!?*\n\nLana worked aggressively at her matted and grubby hair. As the filth finally began to loosen its hold, Lana could see clumps of the blood and goo fall off in the murky brown streams.\n\nAnother deep breath and with calmer determination, Lana retraced the night’s events.\n\nIt was early morning, two or three am. Sylis and Lana had scarcely scrapped a nap when the ship had returned. Quickly dressing and joining the group as they disembarked, they were immediately approached by one of their guild representatives. They were then rushed back to the guild hall where Rasuvius, their guild leader, waited anxiously.\n\nLana furrowed her brow. She could hear the shrill voice of the hag from the message Rasuvius played for them. A chill ran through her as the memory replayed. They were discussing, bickering, over what the message could mean, what it was the hags could possibly want with them, when the threat broke through the guild doors. Lana tried her best to harm the minotaurs, but they were too strong for her. In two- *or was it three?* hits, Lana’s knees buckled as the ax tried to sever her head. That’s the part that made the pit in her belly grow heavier. That gap in time. How much time had passed?\n\nWhen Lana woke, everything was in a blur. The taste of wood and blood filled her mouth. A frenzy of emotions rushed so rapidly that Lana could only feel confused by what was happening. Was she angry? Scared? Desperate? Happy? Why was she fighting against Sylis?\n\nLana worked the last of the debris from her hair. She then began to lather it in soap. It was like a bad dream that she couldn’t remember. Just bits and pieces that seeped into her bones and filled her with dread. It was rather silly to allow such a thing to take hold of her. With the scent of soap in her nose and the steam caressing all around her, Lana turned her thoughts to more pleasant ones. \n\nThe cruise Wendalin had taken them on wouldn’t be forgotten soon. The beautiful skies they flew among, the rich food that the wealthy abound in, her first kiss from Sylis as the day came to an end, and having her best friend, Rin, with her for the fun.\n\n*Rin!*\n\nAs she rinsed her hair of the soap, Lana couldn’t help but remember how Rin had taken such good care of her. He hid her when she was running from Barut. Calmed her when she was shaken by the ghost of her mother. Washed her back with no strings attached. Rin’s quiet and simple care pierced through the walls Lana kept up, so much she now longed for him. She needed to tell him about last night and perhaps enjoy some of the tea he had made her once before. \n\nHowever Rin had told Lana that he was taking up a job to pay off his debts. If she was lucky, maybe he had already finished. Quickly she wiped away the last of the dirt that covered her body. It was in that moment that Lana also noticed her hands had stopped trembling.\n\nWith a bit of excitement, she hurried back into her room, to dry off and dress. It surprised her a brief moment to see Sylis watching her from the bed. He had a curious look on his face and a few scratch marks on his left cheek. It was as though he was studying her, or admiring her nakedness. Then he said something very unexpected.\n\n“So tell me baby girl, who’s Jessie?” \n\n✻  ✻  ✻  ✻  ✻ \n\nLana put on a bright smile, happy to see her lover, but surpassing his question. “Good morning- well afternoon by now,” she said, her voice a little too high. Sylis gave a warm smile, his seriousness breaking for a moment. Lana leaned over and gave him a kiss to play up her happy mood and not give him any room for worry.\n\nAs their lips broke, Sylis once more asked, “Who’s Jessie?” \n\nLana pursed her lips and proceeded to ignore his question as she selected her outfit for the day. Sylis continued to poke and prod at the subject, but Lana refused to speak.\n\nJessie was a girl from Dr. Tomlund’s Asylum for Young Girls. It was located on the outskirts of Sharn, among the warehouses where the screams and cries were drowned out. From the outside, most would find it a rather eerie place, but once a person passed the threshold of the gates, it opened up to a rather calming atmosphere. Though the lighting was gray and gloomy, the courtyard had a few trees and a spacious lawn that the girls sometimes could go out on for fresh air. Inside the halls were white. It always felt too clean for Lana. Something about the whiteness bothered her.\n\nWithin the first week at the asylum, Lana knew that she was truly around some crazy people. There were girls who felt compelled to burn things, hurt themselves, talk to inanimate objects, or just stand and stare off into space. There was one girl, Callie, who was magically inept but insisted she was on a quest to slay a dragon. Another girl, Georji, loved everyone and everything, going around helping and giving hugs whether one wanted it or not. She certainly wasn’t very bright.\n\nHowever, the most interesting of all was Jessie. At first glance, Jessie seemed like one of the spaced out girls. She was the youngest at the asylum, eight years of age, with long, mousy hair that was slightly unkempt. Her skin was very pale and her eyes a light blue-gray. Often she was seen just standing off to the side. Sometimes she’d be interacting with an object, like a doll or blocks, but for the most part she’d just be standing silently. \n\nJessie was rather aware too. Lana would catch her looking at people, but everyone gave her a wide berth. It became clear why that was when Georji tried to hug her. The seemingly harmless eight year old grabbed hold of the girl and became something feral. She clawed and bit and pulled hair. Adults soon swarmed Jessie, pulling her off the sobbing Georji.\n\nLana made it a point to keep a sharpened pencil on her at all times. It paid off when a few weeks later she found herself alone in a hallway with the eight year old. Lana tried to bypass her, hoping whatever triggered Jessie wouldn’t happen, only for the girl to strike. For something so small, she pushed Lana hard into the wall. Quickly Lana reached for the pencil as Jessie continued to go into her feral tactics. What felt like an eternity suddenly ended as Lana rammed the pencil into the girl’s neck.\n\nThe look Jessie gave her was eerie. Lana was mildly disappointed that the blow didn’t kill her for she was certain the girl would have it out for her afterward. But that was the curious thing; Jessie became a sort of pet to Lana. When the eight year old returned to the core group, she surprised Lana by hugging her. She had been looking at the bookshelf looking for a book to read when little arms wrapped around her. Lana turned and found Jessie looking at her with adoration. It took awhile for Lana to trust her, but soon she became a crucial piece to Jessie’s improvement.\n\nThe little girl who was unpredictable, who never talked and found enjoyment in hurting others, suddenly was progressing toward stability. Lana was the only one she listened to. By the end of Lana’s fourth year, Jessie had improved to being able to care for herself and managing a schedule. She still doesn’t speak, but her outbursts were next to none.\n\nLana missed Jessie and felt a bit bad that she had nearly forgotten her in the four months she had been free. \n\nWhen Sylis wouldn’t let up on who she was, Lana finally answered. “Oh she’s just a girl from the Boarding School I went to.” She then changed the subject. “I was thinking we should go visit Rin. I want to see how his job went, let alone tell him about our wild night.” \n\n“I didn’t know you went to Boarding School. Where at?” Sylis pestered, seeing past her distraction. \n\n“In Sharn,” Lana replied thoughtlessly.\n\n“Oh neat! Maybe we can go pay a visit to Jessie then,” Sylis the suggested. Lana slammed the trunk lid down.\n\n“No!” she said more curtly than she had intended, “It’s- it’s rather busy there. And we shouldn’t interrupt her studies-”\n\n“Lana,” Sylis cut in, \"don’t lie to me.” Lana furrowed her brows. She felt mildly embarrassed he caught her half truth.\n\n“I don’t understand why you’re so interested in her. How do you even know that name!?”\n\nSylis took Lana’s hands and explained last night. “When you woke up after your fall, you were... acting very strange. You were eating blood and wood and anything you could get your hands on. You attacked those who tried to stop you. Then, when you began to come off of the high you were on, you began to ramble about being Jessie. You were rather insistent at points. I was just curious as to who she might be.”\n\nLana shrugged, confused by all that Sylis said. In the back of her mind, it explained the taste of blood and the anger toward him, but at the same time, it sounded farfetched. She touched Sylis's cheek where scratch marks lingered.\n\n“Sorry about that...” she said absent mindedly, “It really was quite the night.” Then with a flirtatious tone, “I can assure you one thing, I am very much Lana May.\" She then wrapped her arms about Sylis, giving him a passionate kiss that finally silenced him.\n",

        "author": "Dakkaface",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5krjl9/star_wars_saga_edition_the_centennial_tortoise/",
        "text": "Now I'm going to step away from our misadventures with Don Quixote. This is the story of The Centennial Tortoise and the 2-session campaign.\n\nThe game is Star Wars: Saga Edition. Our GM is a fresh-faced kid from a straight-laced conservative family, he's played a few games with us before, but this is his first run at GMing. We're not given much direction in what he intends to run, other than that it'll be pretty classic Star Wars space opera stuff and the time frame is the middle of the Clone Wars. That in mind, we put together a highly eclectic, but standard in terms of roles party. A Face, a Mechanic, a Slicer, a Jedi and a Combat Heavy.\n\nThe Slicer is an astromech with a bunch of hidden compartments - also our pilot. The Jedi is a non-Jedi force user of some description for wizard antics, the Combat Heavy is a wannabe Mandalorian with some big guns. They're largely window dressing. The real horrendous players and the primary cause for the campaign derail are the remaining two. The Face is a Faleen Noblewoman, who makes extensive use of Faleen pheromones to aid negotiations. She's the owner and nominal captain of our tramp freighter; the Centennial Tortoise. The final member of the crew is myself. Akut Jakkar, Jawa ship's mechanic, slave owned by the Faleen, and general tinkerer.\n\nOur story begins when we drop out of hyperspace to do a routine course correction and find a bunch of Trade Federation capital ships sitting around, in the middle of nowhere. They order us to stand down and dock. Being a shitty light freighter up against cruisers, we do so to avoid being blasted to smithereens. First thing they do when we get off the ship is put us in meeting room right next to the docking bay and try to gas us, just like Episode I. Well, unlike Quigon and Obi-wan, we have skills other than hitting things with laser swords. The droid hotwires the doors and we all get the hell out right quick. We get ambushed by battledroids, but fuck that shit - I'm a *Jawa*. \"Utinni!\" I cry, as I ion blast the droids.  They quickly fall, and I and do my level best not to leave the pile of precious precious droid parts behind, dragging what I can to the ship.\n\nWe blast our way out of the hanger and we end up dodging like there's no tomorrow - though we wouldn't have to dodge so much if the ship actually had shields. The Faleen captain shouts at Akut over the comms, bitch-factor maximum. \"Mechanic! Why the hell don't we have shields?!\"\n\nAkut replies with unfortunate news. \"Ah. Um. We need shields? Needed cable. For other stuff. Main power line from reactor to shields is in Akut's room. Wait wait, Akut will fix.\"\n\nA tense minute and some loud mechanical noises later and the captain hears from Akut again. \"Shields A-okay now. Don't go in cargo hold. Power routed through floor.\"\n\nAnd with that exchange and a reading of the Saga edition ship combat rules, we managed to negate the shots that actually hit us via piloting and mechanics checks, tanked the one shot we couldn't dodge and make it to hyperspace.\n\nOur newbie GM is at a complete loss as to what to do. His plot planned for us to be captured by the Trade Federation, and as a new GM he can't handle the fact that we just jumped the rails. He does his best, asking us where we plan on heading now. The captain decides we are heading to Coruscant, because we'd be safe from Trade Fed there.\n\nThat was where the first session ended. The GM spent the next week trying to come up with some way to have us back on the rails in one session and couldn't think of a single thing. Unable to come up with a way to shoehorn us into a plot that required us to be captured by Trade Fed while we were in the heart of Republic space, he gave up and asked \"What are you going to do on Coruscant?\" \n\nThis was a bad idea from the start.\n\nThe Faleen decided she wanted to go shopping for slaves, having the inkling of an idea. The Mandalorian and Force user decided to go with her to keep their employer safe. The droid held down the fort in the ship. \"Junkyard.\" Akut said. \"Best parts always at junkyard, for cheap, just need little fixing.\"\n\nThe GM decided that he'd satisfy everyone and put down a Star Wars Miniatures game map from Tatooine that had a junkyard near a tiny cantina. The main party struck up a conversation with someone in the cantina, discovered that Red Twileks are frightfully rare outside of their home planet, and not terribly cheap even on planet. Asking around some more, the party left after picking up a job smuggling glitterstim to Ryloth. Even if red Twi'leks are hard to find, Twi'lek slaves must be cheap on the Twi'lek homeworld, right? Later we found out that there was a brawl and bounty hunter appearance planned, but since they only spoke to two guys, and picked up a job that paid obscenely well for a short trip - they weren't sticking around and left before the GM could spring that particular encounter.\n\nAkut on the other hand, walked into the junkyard's office and demanded a grav sled. \"Grav sled! Need grav sled to pick out parts!\"\n\nHis abrasive manners did not go over well with the two Duros in the office. They gave him his grav sled - and activated the droid security bots that sat in several junk piles, camouflaged in the rubbish. Possibly the worst thing they could do to deter a Jawa. As he picked through the piles of trash Akut was delighted to discover multiple droids still moving, even armed with blasters! Ion blasts made quick work of them, and soon a grav sled with 4 slightly crispy B1 battledroids and a large number of spare speeder parts was pushed into the front office.\n\n\"You terrible junkyard owners. Droids almost new! Still, ion damage here. How much you want?\"\n\nThe Duros are afraid. The tiny humanoid just disabled their security system, and is handling a blaster rifle. \"Nothing, just take it!\"\n\nAkut narrows his glowing eyes in suspicion. \"Nothing? Can't take for nothing. Akut knows how this works, if leave here, you call troopers because you not paid! Akut is shot in back and left in ditch, and you get stuff back. No - I give you 50 credits.\"\n\nThe shopkeeps eye each other and nod. Anything to get this maniac out of the shop. \"Deal. 50 creds.\"\n\n\"NO! You still plan to shoot Akut on way out, say 'He try to underpay me.' Here. 200 creds. YOU GIVE ME RECEIPT!\" This last barked while shaking a blaster rifle by the barrel at the two Duros.\n\nAnd thus he left, loading the parts onto the party speeder, visions of speeder tinkering in his demented little mind. After selling off the extraneous blaster rifles, we loaded up our highly illegal spice, and our Faleen revealed her genius plan to keep the shipment hidden. Obscene sex toys. Our ships manifest had the raunchiest and most terrible sexual items imaginable listed on it - and any customs inspector was going to have to go through crates of blinking purple Ithorian dongs and Gammorean gimp masks to get to our illicit goods.\n\nWe have a brief run through customs in which our concealment works flawlessly, and the noblewoman waves a rotating and flashing Ithorian dildo at an Imperial Customs agent while describing it's use. The customs agent, and the GM, go red-faced and wave us through. With that done, we leave for Ryloth. En route, we looked over the ship catalog and planned our next move. We decided we would ditch the tramp freighter for a bulk cargo hauler, and convert most of the cargo space to luxury quarters. We'd buy pleasure slaves on Ryloth and turn the ship into a flying bordello, with the Faleen as the madam, and we could sell passenger space and charge a premium on the 'pleasure cruise.' After making planetfall, we could operate out of the docks until we had a full set of passengers and then take off again.\n\nAs we discussed our plans the GM's face had a growing expression of shock and horror. It was too much - he quit, not being able to handle something so out of his depth in his favorite universe. The rest of us never really saw the problem given that pleasure slaves are canonical to Star Wars, but the campaign collapsed there. The game only lasted two sessions, but hot damn if that crazy Jawa isn't one of my favorite characters to this day.",
