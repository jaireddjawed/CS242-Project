You basically built a statically linked binary that - probably similar to AppImage - extracted the actual application and ran it in a containerized setting ... probably using cgroups directly. Neither docker, nor podman nor anything of the likes was involved.\n\nThe focus was clearly to pack and distribute services to be run in corporate settings.\n\nI can't find it anymore. I am going through all my bookmarks, notes, tried tons of different google searches. Nothing.\n\nCan anyone remember this project as well? If so: link?",

No-one mentions this these days - in the bad old good old days we were taught to do a fsck regularly on any disc you wanted to keep.\n\nHow long since your root was fsck'd? - please reply to this post with the output of the **tune2fs**(8) command and your distro name and version (see below for a howto).\n\nWith quite a bit of help from u/aioeu (thank you for that) I learned that things have changed since systemd was implemented and:\n\n1. my root volume had been set up to 'never' do a fsck at boot.\n2. I can force a fsck by putting `fsck.mode=force` on the boot command line in grub\n3. Or I can force a fsck on next boot with `touch /forcefsck` although this is deprecated\n\nI don't recall ever setting up my root to to be 'never' fsck'd and suspect it was set that way in the fedora installation on both my systems (2017 and 2019). Or perhaps by a fedora update. Maybe your experience differs?\n\nYou find out by running the following as root (this applies to ext\\* file systems only - btrfs, xfs, jfs etc will be different):\n\n    tune2fs -l \"your root partition\"\n\nYou can find out \"your root partition\" with **lsblk**(8). Mine shows this:\n\n    sdb                                           8:16   0 232.9G  0 disk  \n    sdb1                                          8:17   0     1G  0 part  /boot\n    sdb2                                          8:18   0     4G  0 part  \n    sdb3                                          8:19   0 227.9G  0 part  \n      luks-2eab52d6-c148-41f3-9ba7-c5adba32e64b 253:0    0 227.9G  0 crypt /\n\n... so my root volume is /dev/mapper/luks-2eab52d6-c148-41f3-9ba7-c5adba32e64b\n\nOther possibility are /dev/sda or /dev/sda2 ...\n\nThe fields of interest in the output of **tune2fs**(8) are:\n\n    Filesystem created:       Mon Feb 25 12:12:20 2019\n    Last mount time:          Fri Jan 20 11:16:14 2023\n    Last write time:          Fri Jan 20 11:16:07 2023\n    Mount count:              182\n    Maximum mount count:      -1\n    Last checked:             Mon Feb 25 12:12:20 2019\n    Check interval:           0 (&lt;none&gt;)\n\nWhile you're at it, it might be a good idea to do a **badblocks**(8) check on the disc but that's a subject for another day. I found a couple of bad blocks which I was able to fix.\n\nOnce again, the fedora System Admin documentation is useless on this topic and you need to look to [arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Fsck) for the good oil.\n\nFor my own systems, I have decided to have the system do a fsck on boot every 5 times the volume is mounted with:\n\n    tune2fs -c 5 /dev/mapper/luks-2eab52d6-c148-41f3-9ba7-c5adba32e64b",

The output is shown in the screenshot below. \n\nLastly, we can also monitor the modifications made by “khugepaged” by checking the information on “/proc”. For example we can check the “AnonHugePages”/”ShmemPmdMapped”/”ShmemHugePages” in “/proc/meminfo”, which is global for the entire system. If we want information regarding a specific process/task we can use “/proc/\\[PID\\]/smaps” and count “AnonHugePages”/”FileHugeMapped” for each mapping ([https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/transhuge.html](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/mm/transhuge.html)).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jfyexautv9da1.jpg?width=1066&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0dc7ee2d8b97737a3d83e4e956aff3a2fd95d4ad",

        "text": "Hello all,\n\nI set up a Linux box with Mint 19 for my mother in law when her windows box became too bloated/old.\n\nAll well and good, she surfs to her online email and does some simple stuff on the PC like spreadsheet. Up until like a month ago or three, the computer suddenly took ages to boot, she lost her password long ago (but auto login works so...).\n\nI tell her I'll have a look, and I unplug one of my boxes and puts her in its place, checks out what I can without sudo, but everything seems sort of okay, except the very slow boot time. I also deactivated any log off after 15 minutes etc. as the password is lost.\n\nI reboot to see if I can enter rescue, doesn't work.\n\nI reboot again, no luck.\n\nAnd again to see at least everything is working, and now is the thing I haven't even ever heard of:\n\nWhen the desktop shows, a little box with the username is shown, under it is a password field.\n\nBummer.\n\nBut that's not the thing!\n\nThe PC starts moaning repeatedly, in a digitised voice coming from like a 1980 sci-fi films \"computer\" talking:\n\n\"Paasswoord, enter the pAAsWoord\", like some Gollum sitting under my desk! Took me some time to get it wasn't a kids phone or something either ☺️\n\nI guess it's some smart stuff for when you go headless or something, but really, I would sleep better if someone could exorcise it!\n\nCheers",

And by randomly, I mean no consideration is made for the host CPU load.  Moreover, I wasn't expecting pinning.  This seems like a suboptimal resource sharing algorithm.  I realize you can specify which host CPUs are used and what percent usage you want, but that lacks flexibility.\n\nThe rub is if you have 2 (or more) containers pinned to the same CPU.  They could be contending for processor resources while other host CPUs are idle, under utilized, or running low priority (nice) processes.\n\nThis revelation has made me rethink containerization and suddenly I'm in the weeds trying to discover how to optimally share host resources among (K)VMs, LXC, and Docker, what type of process scheduling they use, how to deal with workloads that vary, etc.\n\nI don't really have anything useful to share other than to generate awareness with other users.  Frankly I'm kind of exasperated.",

As you know, Fedora recently removed some patents from their main repository for legal reasons. This makes sense because they're associated with a company, and therefore are beholden to patent laws. But weren't those codecs there for years before this? So did they just not care in the past or did they somehow miss the fact that they were violating a patent for years? And if so, how could they miss that? How did their legal department miss that?",

However, when I try to boot, I get dropped into a recovery shell with a message saying that the system was able to mount the root fs successfully but was unable to find /sbin/init.\n\nNext I tried pointing the kernel to the location of init in the install directory, but the system just hangs on boot. \n\nMy next guess is that I may need to write my own initramfs for this. Am I missing something or is this the right direction?\n\nI'm aware that you get the above with btrfs subvols, I'm just playing and hacking about with the system to learn what can be achieved with the more traditional filesystems. Maybe use XFS next instead to have a poor-man's snapshots with reflinks. \n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Hoping someone can help me get a brand new instance of CUPS to recieve jobs from our WiFi network. Currently it is only working when printing from our wired network.\n\nA little background. I'm working in a primarilly Windows environment where the print server had been a Windows 2012 R2 VM with a whole bunch of other small workloads tacked onto it. This week I finally got fed up with printing on Windows and decided to spin up a CUPS server to make printing easier for our Windows clients. It's working great from our wired network but our WiFi is on a different subnet and printers won't add and print jobs won't send from WiFi. WiFI clients can ping the server and there aren't any blocks that I'm aware of for IPP ports or anyhting like that between the wireless and wired networks. I've not worked with CUPS in a Windows environment before and when I did work with CUPS before it was a much smaller and flatter network so I'm hoping someone here knows what setting I'm looking for to get CUPS to listen.\n\nNetwork Info:\n\nWifi [10.0.0.0/24](https://10.0.0.0/24)\n\nWired [192.168.1.0/23](https://192.168.1.0/23)\n\nCUPS Server: [192.168.2.57](https://192.168.2.57)\n\nHere's my cupsd.conf as it stands now\n\n    #\n    # Configuration file for the CUPS scheduler.

I want to check **AC Recovery is Enabled, Wake on LAN, and Block Sleep**.\n\n I've tried multiple things so far:\n\n* `dmidecode` This just seems to show hardware specific information. Not any settings\n*  `biosdecode` Same reason \\^\n*  `hwinfo` Same Reason \\^ \n* `ethtool`Just to check if WOL was enabled on the eth interface but it always says its disabled even though BIOS says its enabled so that doesn't seem very reliable\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI installed [fwupd](https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd) as well but was unable to get it to work properly. \n\n* Installing it with **yum** would only yield me an outdated version (1.0.9 or something). \n* Installing with **snap** I kept running into  `Run install hook of \"fwupd\" snap if present (run hook \"install\"` error whenever I tried installing it (its currently an [open bug](https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/issues/5122)) \n*  I finally installed it with **flatpak** and it gave me the most updated version (1.8.9) but when I try running `flatpak run org.freedesktop.fwupd get-bios-settings` (tried with sudo as well) I get this error:\n\n&amp;#8203;\n\n    WARNING: UEFI ESP partition not detected or configured\n      See https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/wiki/PluginFlag:esp-not-found for more information.\n    WARNING: Will measure elements of system integrity around an update\n      See https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/wiki/PluginFlag:measure-system-integrity for more information.\n    WARNING: This package has not been validated, it may not work properly.\n    This system doesn't support firmware settings\n\nSo I added `OverrideESPMountPoint=/efi` to the uefi\\_capsule.conf file ([outlined here](https://github.com/fwupd/fwupd/wiki/PluginFlag:esp-not-found)) and got this error\n\n    15:45:40.358 F                                                                                                                                                          uEngine migrating OverrideESPMountPoint=/efi to EspLocation\n    Failed to create file “/app/etc/fwupd/daemon.conf.2KS4Y1”: Read-only file system\n\nSo I tried `chmod g-or /app/etc/fwupd/daemon.conf` but that didn't change anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo any other options would be much appreciated to just check the three settings!",
