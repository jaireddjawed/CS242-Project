        "text": "I've worked this job a month and half, but been a CNA for two years on and off. It sucks ass. I'm young, younger than most people expect, less than  35\nSo i had been at this nursing home for a week and a half, and one night a lot of people called in and i was forced to train for four hours on night shift. The girl i was training was a CNA for longer than I've had the displeasure of living on this earth, so was very nervous about giving me tips. Its nightshift...we play on our phones and make sure the residents are still alive. \"No biggie, I'm always looking to do my job better.\" I said when she gave me tips. I trained her like I was trained.... She never came back. Called the office and said that \"Silence didn't know what she was doing, Silence shouldn't be training since she was only here a week\" I did. I worked night shift before, but was more than gladly to pass her on to my more experienced replacment. \n\nI did the dumb pleasantries and shit. Management let me know that it was MY FAULT THAT SHE DIDN'T COME BACK. IT WAS MY FAULT THAT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TRAIN. I was written up. Assholes. They preceded to also tell me that i shouldn't have been training in the first place....I told them that I had checked Twice with the nurses trying to get a more qualified CNA that had been here longer to train her. They had said no. I had told them it was a mistake. They refused to listen to me....\n\nSo this place is in some murky business, and treat their CNA staff poorly. I've already put poor reviews on their websites, multiple accounts that have different names. They've been in an anonymous arguement with half of these fake people on reviews. Also I called state on them.... They should be getting a another state check(surprise) by the time I quit on Friday. Also FUCK YOU YOVONNE.\n\n\nEdit: yovonne is my management and she also made us all come to a mandatory meeting today... Later. I've got some petty stuff to make them all uncomfortable.\nAlso yovonne isn't her real name, im not dumb. It's one of those unusual names of the 80's.",

        "text": "Background: I [21] am visiting my grandpa [91] a flight away from my home for a week. I also sound 12 on the phone. \n\nDuring a very emotional conversation about a recent family members’ passing and service, somebody called and told my grandpa his computer was infected. He hung up. \n\nTwo hours later they called again and I picked up. I said, “do not call this number again”  and hung up. \n\nAbout an hour later, they called again. I was very frustrated and had ample time, so I decided I was going to mess with him. \n\nHim: hello your Microsoft computer is infected. Are you sitting in front of your computer? \n\nMe: Oh my, that’s not good. What to do, what to do. \n\nHim: I’m going to help you fix it, ok? Can you go sit in front of your computer? \n\nMe: Which one of my computers \n\nHim: *caught off guard* a computer \n\nMe: but what computer is infected??? I have three??? \n\nHim: are they all on the same WiFi\n\nMe: no \n\nHim: We know they’re on the same WiFi \n\nMe: No there’s an upstairs WiFi and a downstairs WiFi \n\nHim: are you sitting in front of your computer \n\nMe: so are all three computers infected? \n\nHim: *sounding relieved* yes all three are infected. So if you open up your computer....\n\nMe: *interupts* are you going to help me fix all three computers? \n\nHim: Can I speak to your parents? \n\nMe: Are their computers infected to? If so, you will have to call them. They don’t live near me. \n\nHim: So how old are you? \n\nMe: 21, but what does that have to do with computers? \n\nHim: And you don’t live with your parents \n\nMe: I told you you’d have to call my parents about their own computers \n\nHim: and you have a job that pays, yes? \n\nMe: I do but I don’t work with computers. \n\nHim: so you’re in front of you computer\n\nMe: yes my favorite computer \n\nHim: so you opened it, and you see the control key \n\nMe: I don’t know if I have one of those but I have a C-T-R-L key\n\nHim: yes next to the C-T-R-L key \n\nMe: an F-N key \n\n*a few minutes where we argue about different keys* \n\nBefore it got real bad, I just hung up. My grandpa wanted to eat pie and I was happy to oblige. \n\nTd;lr: rude scammer tried to scam my grandpa, so I irritate him for 20 minutes.\n\nScrew people that try to take advantage of those who don’t understand technology. Be sure to remind your loved ones who might be susceptible to such calls that Microsoft will never call them on their telephone lines. Tell them that these people just want your money, or want to instruct you to install malware that steals your passwords (and thus your money) ",

        "text": "I used to work at a palm oil company for six months. And my boss is famous around the company circle for being vicious with her worker, to the point that there's a worker who only work for a half day and then just disappear before lunch, never came back working.\n\nBut then I realize that she had a little competency to be the head of the department despite having been working there for ten years. Her social and negotiation skill were crap, and her knowledge for the purchase product was limited.\n\nFor the first two months, i enjoy working there. I handle fertilizer purchase with my friend \"A\". Most of my co-worker were nice, and we get along fine. But then, one day \"A\" asked me for help. When I asked what's wrong, he said that my boss needed help with her personal problem.\n\nI was reluctant at first, but \"A\" was a good guy, who helped me a lot when I first enter the company. Thus, I'm willing to help, but I said sternly that I was helping him, not her. And if something happens, I will grab him and run away leaving her behind. He agreed and asked me if I wanted to know the story behind all of it. Which I said no. After that, My boss thanks us for helping her, and tell me the background story of her problem, to my annoyance. And it all went peace and quiet for a while. But after we helped her, my boss, always asked A to consult her personal problem. Which become bothersome for us, because we cannot do our job properly. And nearly cost the company money. So A ask her to seek help from another people.\n\nAnd that did not sit well with her. She starts messing with us, berate us on everything or scold us for ridiculous reasons. And then my three months work assessment comes. I knew I will be targeted, and it happened. But I knew what to do. When she asked to write my work progress, I write it all bad to mediocre. And when she said I was a slow and inept worker, I immediately agree with her. And this confuses her so much that she freezes for a couple of minutes. And the she said that she won’t extend my contract and even said I could stop working tomorrow, which I refute by saying I still have a contract responsibility for another 3 months.\n\nSkip to the week before my contract expired. I was downgraded to be an admin, and “A” was demoted to another position and we still get harassed by her. And one day she called me after lunch, asking me to help her to make a couple of reports for the CFO. And then an imaginary light bulb shining above my head, my petty revenge begun. She said that i was slow and inept worker, well, I work as fast as I could and see if she could balance my work speed. The result, she told me to slow down. Which I reply with a big grin. But my petty revenge was not over, on the day before my last work day, I submitted all of the reports required by her. But with one tiny problem. I screw up a small portion of all the calculation data on the report. Small but fatal. And then I skipped work the next day.\n\nI also messed up with all of the data template for my weekly reports and hid my actual data deep and on multiple folders on the company server. My co-worker tells me when I visited them a week latter that on my last day, my boss was looking for me frantically, but she has of much pride to call me. And a couple of months after that, I hear she was subtly forced to resign from that company. So much for that ten years experience.\n",

        "text": "Although it is still illegal in South-Africa to either cultivate, use or be in possession of cannabis, it is widely used for recreational purposes across the country and by all parts of the community. Here in South-Africa we call it Dagga.\n\nIt is an expensive habit if you rely on a dealer to get your weed, and then the quality is not guaranteed. We usually buy a \"banky\" of around 5 grams of weed for around R150. Converted directly to US dollars about $10 worth of weed. Depending on the quality it last for about 2-3 days.\n\nAnyways, I realized that I won't be able to keep buying weed and that I will have to generate a different income if I still wanted to smoke the good herb. Friends also always ask me when they were out, and I then had to share my last weed, adding to my monthly dagga budget. It got too expensive to keep on buying an sharing so I decided to become a dealer!\n\nI told me original dealer about my plan, and he gave me a considered discount as I knew loads of people who smoked that does not buy from him, so he will be getting more sales from my business.\n\nI got my bag of weed from my dealer and started dealing to my friends. It went very well. I made enough profit to buy myself enough dagga without having to touch my normal income.\n\nWell, one of my \"friends\" and also colleagues was a real heavy dagga smoker. I don't smoke before work and wait until I get home, get kid bathed and in bed, then sit at computer, smoking while my game loads. BLISS!\n\nThis guy smoked like every few hours. Before work, during lunch and probably anytime he gets.\n\nHe also started to buy dagga from me as my price was much lower and I was readily available and in town. If you wanted dagga from a dealer you had to go DEEP into the ghetto's(scary AF). With me working with him it was easy to get dagga.\n\nIt was around the 3rd time the week when he told me he needs a refill, but he will pay me the next week. I was like \"sure buddy, here you go!\"\n\nNext week comes, and he wants more but cannot pay yet, gave some excuse of his sick child or whatever. I really liked the guy and we got along well, so when he asked me the 3rd and 4th time, I gave him a banky.\n\nWell, now my profit is screwed as I was giving out free weed to this dude, and I started to run at a lost.\n\nI told him the next time he asked for more dagga that he needs to pay me his debt before he can get more. He got pissed off so bad! Told me how selfish I am, that I'm being a dick, and I can gf myself, he knows a dealer with better weed anyways!\n\nI decided to be innovative and to start growing my own and that is what I did.\n\nI told the other guys I will be growing my own and that I will let them know as soon as it is ready, then I will be able to sell it at a much lower cost etc.\n\nI planted the seeds but only a few plants came up.  More than half was male plants and I was left with two female plants.\n\nWe just recovered from a long drought and while my plants was growing it really rained a whole lot. It was like heavy rain and then hot as hell, heavy rain, hot as hell etc.\n\nOne of the female plants literally became a tree because of this and it was one of the most beautiful things I ever seen in my life.\n\nMy hand could not fit around the stem at the bottom of this magnificent plant and did she carry flowers!!\n\nShe was this big lush bush, with branches on branches and she made the biggest flowers I have ever seen. Some of the side buds was big enough to fit in two hands. Some of the branches was hanging on the ground because of all the maturing flowers(top flowers got spoiled as it was lying in the mud /sad).\n\nYou could smell this bush meters away. I had to wash my hands with alcohol after touching the buds because of all the resin on the flowers. It was sticky AF\n\nWell, finally after mabe more than 6 months of growing and maturing I started to harvest, but man was it hard work. I had to cut of the leaves, cure the buds for 2 months and then pack and weight them. I realized that I alone won't be able to do this by myself so I invited my friends to come and cut them some fresh dagga, for free, which they can then go clean, cure and enjoy!\n\n\"Friend\" calls me up, asking me about the offer to other friends and if he could come too. I told him to gfys, you are not welcome at my house and you will not be getting any of the loads of free weed!\n\nEach friend left with a grocery bag or two full of weed each and there was still left over plenty for me to cure. Well it lasted me this whole winter and my new plants are a few branches high (no pun intended).\n\nI gave up the dealing as I had enough dagga and I will be growing my own, just for me from now on!",

        "text": "I was 17 at the time and my sister was 12. We were going on family vacation with my mom and grandparents. We had all taken our seats on the plane and the flight attendant was going over the usual safety protocol. After his spiel, he walked down the isles to check everything was in its appropriate place but came to a halt when he reached my row. I was seated on the left side of the aisle with my mother and grandmother while my grandpa and sister opposite. I should mention that it was near the back end of the plane and was not an emergency exit row. Additionally, my grandfather had the window seat and my sister the aisle (she's weird I know, what kid doesn't want the window!?). \n\nThe steward (balding white guy probably mid 40's) leaned down to my sister and said something along the lines of \"Honey, how old are you?\" To which my sister replied, \"12\". He then said, \"Ok, and how much do you weigh?\" To which my grandfather confusedly replied, \"why..why does her weight matter?\" At this point, the steward stood upright and began raising his voice. \"HOW DARE YOU LOOK AT ME LIKE I AM A LECHEROUS MAN! I need to know her weight because she is a child that is sitting in the aisle! There are strict guidelines about flight that YOU would never know! And for you to assume that I asked that question with some ulterior motive is horrible. I am not a pervert! YOU ARE TREATING ME LIKE A PERVERT! I could have you kicked off the plane! Do you know that!? So you better watch what you say!\" At this point, everyone on the plane had turned and was watching. I was across the aisle with rage boiling over. In that moment I wanted nothing more than to stand up and punch the steward right in the face for berating my grandfather. Before I could do or say anything, I came to the realization that he was right. He had complete control of the situation because if I were to react in anyway that would be the end of the vacation. We would be kicked off the flight, put on a no-fly list, arrested, or any other list of things. As I watched my grandfather sit in shock, I realized that he came to the same realization because he did not say a word in response but proceeded to stare at the chair in front of him with the sternest look I've ever seen. \n\nThe entire scene came to an end with the steward forcing an answer out of my sister (who was now mortified and crying). While I can't remember the number she said, the steward replied \"That's fine. Now that wasn't so hard was it?\" before he continued down the aisle. As we were exiting the plane, I allowed my family to disembark ahead of me and as I passed the steward on the way out I was sure to ask his name and tell him to go fuck himself. \n\nFast forward to 10 days later when we return home, my mother still furious about the man (like all of us), calls the airline to explain what had happened. The representative listens to all the whole story and details before informing my mother that the steward already had several complaints against him including a few from other passengers about that same exact instance. She continues that the man had already been fired and that they were awarding us with free miles that were equal to that trip in which the event occurred. We are not the type of family that wants someone to lose their job over a mistake, but we felt more than justified due to the extent to which the steward reacted. All in all, we felt that the man got what he deserved but I still feel angry inside for not being able to stick up for my grandfather on the spot.\n\nTLDR:  While on a flight for vacation, a steward asked my 12 year old sister a weird question to which my grandfather asked why it was relevant. The steward flipped out and said my grandfather was calling him a pervert, causing a scene on the airplane. Powerless due to the fact that we were on a plane, we could not do or say anything. When we called the airline a week later to get the man fired, we found out others had reported the man and that he had already been fired.",

        "text": "This happened about 2 1/2 years ago. \n\nI was the property manager for an apartment complex in a town with about 20,000 people in the midwest. The complex had a serious turnover problem. In the two and a half years that I worked there, there were 5 managers, 4 leasing agents, 5 housekeepers, and probably at least 10 maintenance guys. (The staff setup was: 1 manager, 1 leasing agent, 1 housekeeper, 2 maintenance guys) This was because corporate and upper management was awful and treated everyone like shit, whether you were an employee or resident.\n\nBecause of the high turnover, there were a lot of problems. When I started as the leasing agent, the complex was at 75% occupancy. This was in a town that was going through a major economic boom and every other apartment complex had a months-long waiting list. To put this in perspective, in the property management industry, if you fall under 95% occupancy, it's considered bad. I was fresh out of dropping out of college (lol) at 20, and I never had a job outside of cashiering before, and to my surprise, leasing came very naturally to me. I loved the residents and I tried everything I could to make everyone happy and handle all the problems that I could in the ~25 hours a week that I worked. \n\nSince I began, a manager would start, stay for anywhere between 2 weeks and 3 months, then they'd quit and our \"zone manager\" would fill in for the property manager until they hired another, it usually took a couple months. The zone manager was basically like the regional manager for the 3 properties in our \"zone\" - each of the properties were in a 30 minute drive of the capital city/largest city in the state, ours was 30 min north of the city. The zone manager lived 30 minutes north of my property and our office was her \"home office,\" so she usually worked alongside me. She was around the same age as my parents and we got along super well. She became like a mentor to me. About a year into my job, the only good property manager that the complex had had at that point had to quit because her husband was offered a lucrative position in another state. Before she left, she hinted to me that if I kept up the good work the zone manager and her boss would offer me the property manager position. I had a six month old at that point and was super excited as it would be my first \"grown-up\" job. \n\nI worked my ass off. A few weeks later, I was offered the position of \"Assistant manager.\" This property didn't have an assistant manager position - it was explained to me as a probationary period before becoming the full-on property manager. But I had all the responsibility of the property manager, with a measly $1 pay increase from my part-time position. Red flag #1, but I was so excited that I accepted. After a couple of months, the zone manager and her boss (she oversaw all the properties in our state) offered me the property manager position. I was offered $12/hour, which was bullshit, but I got a free apartment as well, so I figured that made up the difference in pay that I felt I should have gotten. I picked out my apartment and submitted my request to boss' boss and got red flag #2. I was offered a free apartment - but no one told me it would only be free if it was a third floor apartment. The one that I picked out was a first floor apartment, which the complex charged more for, so I was told that I would have to pay the difference between the third and first floors - about $200/month. I figured, well that's still better than what I was currently paying, so I went with it. \n\nOnce I officially became the property manager, everything changed. My zone manager was always short with me and didn't ever just talk and laugh like we did. They started telling me to lie to residents, and do other illegal shit. I figured out, the zone manager was basically training me to be complicit so that when I did become the property manager, I'd do the deceitful stuff they wanted me to and I wouldn't quit after a couple weeks/months like all the other managers. I never did. I refused every time they asked me to do anything illegal/immoral/shady. They didn't like that, and started being outright mean to me. I started having anxiety attacks before work and was just constantly stressed. Red flag #3 that I ignored - when I became the property manager, they switched me over to salary pay, so I was exempt from overtime pay, and since I moved on site, they required me to be on call 24/7. I thought this was normal, because my zone manager told me that she did the same thing when she was my age, and most property managers did. I thought it was a normal, industry standard. I would be at the grocery store, date night at the movies with my husband, visiting family 2 hours away - I ALWAYS had to answer the company phone, I was never allowed to take a break. I had even been yelled at for not answering the phone at 3am because a resident complained to the corporate hotline about it (they lost power in their kitchen and bathroom and were too stupid to check the circuit breaker before freaking the fuck out). I started looking for other jobs and other places to live after this. \n\nI came into work one day and the zone manager was criticizing the property inspection report that I turned in the previous day for not being \"descriptive\" enough. If a fluorescent light cover is broken and has a crack in it how the fuck are you supposed to describe that other than \"light cover in (building #, hallway) broken - crack approx. 3\" long\" but I digress. She started using personal attacks, calling me lazy and I was always coming up with excuses, other bullshit, etc. At this point I hadn't even set down my purse or gone into my office. I had literally JUST walked in. So, I sat down at my computer without saying a word, typed up a two week's notice, and gave it to her. She said \"Well, at least you gave me this so I wouldn't have had to fire you today.\" What the fuck??? I just said \"Well, that's unfortunate.\" Because I only think of stupid stuff to say in the moment. I knew after that I wasn't going to stay for two weeks. I knew I wouldn't even be able to stay the rest of the day without having an anxiety attack. She called her boss, right in front of me, and told her that I had \"Finally\" turned in my notice. After an hour of submitting resumes and emails about rentals in town, putting my small amount of personal items in my purse, and deleting every single thing off of my computer, I told her that my daughter had an emergency and I had to leave, and that I would be back tomorrow. Apparently she decided to start being nice to me again since she wouldn't have to deal with me much longer, and told me that she hoped my daughter was okay and to keep her updated. I went home, told my husband I was done, and we started packing. We were gone two weeks later. \n\nAnd now, after the super-long setup, here's the revenge. \n\nI had let a couple of my neighbors know some of the shady shit that they asked me to do, and the ways that they straight up lied to people. For example, they told everyone that rent was due on the first and any rent paid after the first was subject to a late fee. But corporate never actually ran late fees until like the 5th-6th of the month. I also let it slip about how a unit had bedbugs, the unit was treated, and the bedbugs just moved into the unit next door. Instead of treating the entire building at once, they were chasing them around, because they feared if they gave notice to the entire building that they were going to treat them all for bedbugs, then word would get around about an infestation. Obviously they didn't realize that by chasing them from unit to unit, they'd end up treating the whole building anyway, in the most inconvenient way possible. Word got around the entire complex shortly after I left. Lawsuits were threatened, dozens of angry reviews left online, and the reputation around town was that it was a meth lab bug haven. The staff all quit not long after I did. It's been two and a half years since I quit and they do not have ANY staff. And I mean ANY staff. They still have not been able to fill any of the open positions. I still talk to some people who live there, and they tell me that they have contract cleaners coming in for the housekeeping, and all of the other positions are filled by employees from other properties who will come in and work until they're sick of it and then corporate will find another employee to send. My boss filled the property manager position for a while, but then after a couple months, she quit or was fired. I'm not sure which - one of the residents that I still talk to  told me that boss' boss started working as the property manager one day and wouldn't tell anyone what happened to my old boss, she'd just say something along the lines of \"she is no longer here but I can help with whatever you need\". There have been a handful of people who have been hired there but they never last long, and the local facebook groups always warn people off of working there whenever someone asks who's hiring. Oh and to top it all off - by the time that I had quit I had gotten the property to 100% occupancy with a waiting list. Not even six months after, they were back down to 75%, and apparently it keeps dropping. ",

You would think there would be enough room in the front of the plane but no, there wasn't.  Just after breakfast the guy in front of me slams his seat into full recline and damn near dumps my dishes into my lap.  I let out a yelp and curse word or two but there was no response from him.  Normally I would be on guard but I figured this was first class, there will be plenty of space.  If he would have given me a warning it would have been fine but I was startled and wanted an ounce or two of flesh.  He settled in for a little nap.\n\nIf I was back in coach I might have settled for a knee in the back of the seat once or twice but there was a better option here.   The way this plane was set up the position of the A/C vent was perfect.  I swiveled the nozzle forward and opened it up as far as it would go.  I was rewarded with sight of his hair starting to part from the breeze.  He swatted at his head like there was a bug there a couple of times and then settled in.  After a restless twenty minutes he finally looked up and saw the vent.  I was waiting for some kind of response but he didn't say anything.  He just gradually tilted his seat back up and started to read his Wall Street Journal.\n\nFlesh taken.",

For example I would be in the library and a girl would hand me a book that had gay in the title. She then proceeded to say \"it's for you\" and giggle. Instead of coming to the obvious conclusion they were calling me gay I skimmed it, didn't like it, thanked them for their thought, and put it back where it belonged.\n\nNow that there's a bit of context on how dense I was I'll tell y'all the actual story. It was April 1st and I was walking into the band room for the next class. As I was entering one of the trumpet players turned around asked, \"Would you go out with me?\" Then ran back to his friends. This guy was one of the dudes who glared at me in the hallways, called me fat at lunch, laughed at me when I ate, so I wasn't happy about being asked out by him at all.\n\nIf you've seen a frightened cat that was how I looked at that moment. He yells out that he was just kidding and I visibly relaxed causing his friends to laugh, but not at me, they laughed at him. I tried to make things better by telling them that that was funny but scary I wasn't interested in dating at all. This only caused them to tease the poor dude more. Honestly if he wasn't a consistent jerk to me otherwise I would've felt worse when I finally understood why he was being made fun of.\n\nTl;Dr: reversed a \"prank\" by reacting obliviously\n\n",

        "text": "I'm a bit afraid of coming off as r/iamverysmart in this post, but I'm really not going for that. I'm just proud of myself. \n\nSo a year or so ago I was taking a college course on horror, literature and film and how story telling has progressed over the years in this genre, ect. For one of our assignments we were split into small groups and each group was given a movie to watch. From that movie, we were supposed to talk about how the 'horror' aspect was really just a moral lesson of regular society. Dracula is about avoiding sexuality and what not. \n\nMy group was given the classic 1957 \"I Was a Teenage Werewolf\". I was a bit disappointed, what with Body Snatchers and They Live on the list, but whatever. The best thing about my movie, aside from how funny it was to actually watch, was that it was insanely straight forward. \n\nWe agreed to watch the film at one group members dorm, and set a date. The time the night came, I had trouble getting to the dorm. I had trouble finding the right building, which was two buildings merged together, I had trouble finding the room, and after several texts and calls (and did I mention I have anxiety, so this really sucked) I was able to knock on the right door, and realized most of my group mates were already friends, and freshman, and I wasn't. \n\nThey didn't seem happy to see me, and gave me some shit about being late, despite knowing the situation. We sat down to watch the movie, and the girl who lived in the dorm offered us the pizza she ordered, specifically naming everyone but me. I didn't feel comfortable eating a slice, until 15 minutes later when they told me I could have one. \n\nThe movie was simple, and kind of funny, and we all wrote down quotes and lines we thought were important to our assignment. I figured if these people were going to act so superior, I could at least trust them to be on target for the class, right? \n\nWrong. After the movie concluded we began to talk about working out a power point for our presentation and dividing the work for the group paper, it quickly became clear to me that we weren't on the same page. I took my chunk of the film and arranged clearly what I wanted to say and what parts of the movie supported my idea. I explained it out to them, but they kept ignoring me and shooting me down and trying to take this long way around the logic of the assignment and stretch it into some kind of ordeal. \n\nFine. Cool. I left that night knowing that I would just stick to my plan and see what happened. I arranged my part of the power point, I wrote my part of the paper as I wanted to and without their input. We turned the paper in a few days before we presented, and then, the day came. \n\nAs other groups went before us I started to see my group shit their pants. They began to realize they'd misunderstood and totally circumvented the point of the project, and were panicking. Our presentation was rocky as hell, and at the end of it, we were handed back one copy of our paper. \n\nThey all scored 70 and lower. I was given a perfect 100. I tried to pretend to be bummed for them, but they iced me out quickly and told me I could keep the paper if I wanted. And hell yeah, I wanted. I still have it somewhere, and it feels good. \n\nTl;DR: My groups mates ostracized and ignored me, got embarrassed in front of our class and all got a worse grade than me. ",

Unfortunately our flight was canceled due to weather. Oh well, this meant I got to spend an extra day with my sister and miss another day of school. Today, we got on our flight and other than the guy who wouldn't stop ranting about his flight being canceled yesterday, it's been pretty normal. Well shortly after takeoff, not but a few minutes ago, I felt my seat begin to lean forward. Well, not willing to put up with someone pressing against my seat all flight, I learned back as hard as I could. No luck, my enemy is stronger than I'd anticipated. We have to innovate and innovate fast, this is quickly becoming a war of attrition. Suddenly I feel them. They are advancing into enemy territory and unfortunately the front lines are giving in. We need reenforcements. Queue the legs. I plant my feet firm on the floor and press back with all my might. I feel the seat start to shift. I'm winning, our counteroffensive seems to be working, now just to hold them there and keep them from advancing. But there's a problem, I've begun a two front war with my enemy in 20D and my shoes. I wore flip flops waiting to be comfy on the plane and they have now betrayed me. As I feel myself slipping, my enemy pushing me forward I know I need a new strategy. I brace my legs against the seat supports in front of me, careful not to push their seat back, not wanting to put them through what I have been through. I push as hard as I can, now sitting slightly higher in my chair. My enemy notices. As I slowly push back, my head now at least one foot higher, our little war of passive aggressive attrition has now been acknowledged. He knows I won't give in. Then I go nuclear. My finger dances around the button on the side of my arm rest contemplating the consequences of what I am about to do. As I make my way back I press it. My seat locks just a bit farther back. More territory has been secured. I now contemplate what to do next. I press the button once again, my enemy now in full retreat, my seat leans back about half way to its max. I am victorious. Nearly 20 minutes later, I now watch my finger dance around the button, contemplating whether to leave him defeated, or take the final strike and leave him conquered. I press the button it goes back farther. Unwilling to make eye contact and acknowledge the reason why I've done this, I finish my post with this tl;dr and hope 20D reads this. \n\n\n\nTL;DR person behind me is literally shoving their feet into the back of my chair, (mind you they are an adult, not some kid) so I push back and lean my chair all the way back.",

        "text": "This happened in the summer of 2016 when my wife and I moved into our new home on a tree lined, brick street. Nice neighborhood but nothing fancy. Blue collar, working men and women.\n\n\nWe met the neighbors, my wife made cookies and they invited us to their pool parties, we swapped foodstuffs and recipes ... It was all Ozzie and Harriet - until I put a fence up around our back yard for security firstly as anyone could come off the back alley and right up onto our porch and back door. Plus, I wanted to be able to let our two shorthair pointers out to play without having to tie them up or supervise them.\n\n\nWell, our neighbors didn’t like that, and who can say why? It disturbed their visual routine, they were resistant to change, they suffer from frachtiphobia? Never did find out.\n\n\nThree things changed: One, they no longer invited us to their pool parties, two, we no longer traded cookies and pies, and lastly...they began parking in front of our house.\n\nIt’s a public street and you can do as you will but my two spaces were constricted by a telephone pole that had guy wires coming down from it meaning you’d have to be careful getting into and out of your car lest you scratch the paint, or worse, clothesline yourself with metal cables.\n\nSo we had but one good spot that lined up our car door with the sidewalk perfectly...and that became their default parking space despite the fact that they had their spaces and a two car garage off the alley in the back.\n\nThey also started a piano lessons business (better than drums, I suppose) and apparently decided to keep their front spots open for their customers.\n\nI work odd hours and it always seemed there were a line of cars in front of both houses so I’d end up having to park frustratingly far away and with winter coming, trudging through the slush carrying groceries had zero appeal.\n\nSo I watched and waited until one fine fall day with the leaves changing from green to vermillion and brilliant gold, and a morning chill that promised of winter soon to come - it happened! Their 3-5 cars (the live-at-home, unemployed daughter maintained a rotating cast of paramours) were gone, and nobody was giving piano lessons!\n\nI struck! I raced to my dad’s and hitched his houseboat to his beater farm truck and towed the combo back home, parking 80’+ of gloriously tacky red-neck hardware directly in front of their house, while my vehicle took up our prime spot and most of the telephone tripwire space as well.\n\nAnd I left the combo there for almost two weeks, unmoving, and rusting loudly right in front of their front porch swing that they liked to perch on in the evenings.\n\n\nPressure from my wife and the impending monthly street sweeping finally led to my removing the blockade and they’ve not parked in font of our place since, nor have we spoken more than 5 words in 2 years ... and that’s fine by us.\n\nThe woman can’t bake anyhow.",

        "text": "So backstory I work at a grocery store that is pretty much Boomers R Us so its \"can I speak to your manager\" and expired coupon tantrums galore. This particular store also charges $1.00 per plastic bag so you are required to ask and then inform the customer of such circumstances and most people acknowledge the price. Now if someone asks me politely to double bag their groceries I don't charge them for the second bag (this will be important later)\n\nSo this happened earlier, an older man who seemed to be in his 60s goes into my lane with a cart full of stuff and doesnt seem to have any bags with him so I ask him the typical \"would you like bags? They cost a dollar each\" spiel and this is what went down\n\nMe: would you like a ba-\n\nMan: *interrupting me* OF COURSE I WANT BAGS AND MAKE SURE TO DOUBLE BAG THEM I DONT WANT IT RIPPING AND SHIT SPILLING OUT!!\n\nMe: ok sir but just to let you kn-\n\nMan: SCAN MY STUFF AND STOP ARGUING WITH ME!\n\nSo I get to bagging his stuff and making sure to double bag every single bag. There was roughly 10 bags that were double bagged, so 20 bags sold in total. His total comes to I think it was $50.00 and some change *plus* the $20.00 for the bags (would've only been $10.00 if he wasn't an entitled asshat)\n\nMe: That will be $70.00 please! *fake ass smile*\n\nMan: WHAT?!!?!? THATS IMPOSSIBLE I DIDNT BUY NO 70 DOLLARS WORTH OF FOOD I'M ON A BUDGET!!!\n\nMe: well as I tried to explain earlier, bags are a dollar each and you requested I double bag\n\nMan: THIS IS INSANE I DEMAND TO SPEAK TO YOUR MANAGER!!!\n\nMe: no problem! *pages manager*\n\nManager comes by shortly and I try to explain what happens but the man yells at her about the situation\n\nManager proceeds to explain the bag policy and he claims I never did, but I state I tried to tell him and a nearby coworker was around to back me up on my claim. She basically told him to either pay for his shit or leave. Man pays for his $70.00 purchase with a check *groan* and leaves ranting and throwing a tantrum about how he was never shopping here again\n\nBe a douchecanoe pay extra for bags bitch",

        "text": "So this happened many years ago during the winter in my very snowy home state. I was moved out of my apartment and staying at my parents for a couple weeks waiting for the new place to become available. To help out a little since my father is disabled, I would do all of the shoveling for my parents. They have a double lot property in the city so there's a lot to shovel, and it happened to be an incredibly snowy couple of weeks. And most days if I beat the next door neighbor out, I would shovel his walkway too, he is a really kind older man and a family friend.\n\nBut the neighbor on the other side, was a massive douche nozzle (DN). The whole block disliked him, and loved my parents as they've lived their for 35 years and I grew up with all of their kids. He just moved in the year before and would call the cops on my parents for their dog barking, the cops came 2 times during the first summer. My parents were very good about getting the dog inside right away if he started to bark. Except for a couple times where my dad let the dog out, made his way to the bathroom upstairs, and had to slowly move through the house to get the dog in. Takes him a couple minutes to get down the stairs. The neighbor even installed a noise activated camera to try and give the cops some evidence. According to my parents, this guy on more than one occasion left his husky outside overnight howling to get back in, which my father or another neighbor had to call them to let their dog in.\n\nEach time the cops showed, my parents never got a citation, and the neighbor handed them a 5 minute video of their dog barking on many different occasions. The city law, is that the dog must be taken in if it barks continuously for 5 minutes. Not 5 minutes of barking over the course of several months. Anyways, that's how he pissed off my parents, I don't know how he pissed off the rest of the neighborhood.\n\nThe DN owned a lawn maintenance and snow removal company, and it must have been pretty successful since it's one of the nicer neighborhoods. And his property has a driveway at the front that goes all the way to the garage at the back where he and his family always parked, they never parked in the street. He didn't do anything for himself, and would have his company take care of his yard and garden in the summer and the snow in the winter. But like I said, this was the snowiest two weeks we've had in many years. We're talking close to a foot of snow every other day. And his company must have been swamped with customers since his sidewalks weren't touched in the whole two weeks I was there. \n\nSince my dad is disabled, I would shovel to his car parked on the street, and shovel a walkway through the grass to get to his car easier. And you can't save street parking spots I know, but most houses on the block had driveways like DN's, so not many people would park on the street, certainly not in front of their friend of 35 years who is disabled.\n\nBut DN didn't give a damn, and any chance he could, he would park in the perfectly shoveled spot I made for my dad. He was already proven to be unreasonable to my parents, they said talking to him would accomplish nothing. And I could have called the cops because he is legally required to shovel the public sidewalk in front of his house a certain amount of hours after each snowfall, but that wasn't petty enough for me and my parents weren't that type of neighbor. \n\nSo probably the 5th time of this happening, we get home after going out to eat, where my dad and I had a few to drink (my mother was driving) and there's his car again, not in front of his house, not in his driveway, not in his empty garage, right in front of my parents house, and the only car on the street. So I get to shoveling. Started right away by making a new path for my father in his new spot. But all that snow had to go somewhere, so what better place than all around DN's car. The street hadn't been plowed yet anyways. That path wasn't enough snow though, but hey, the street hasn't been plowed, why don't I help the city out a little and clear some of that too? Took quite a while, cleared a good chunk of the street, and left a 5 ft wide 4 ft tall wall around DN's SUV, and a little thicker around the doors. \n\nWoke up the next morning and looked out the window. DN's car is gone, must have gone to work. Grabbed the shovel again to clear up the massive snow wall I built so the city didn't have to. And the footprints in the snow told me everything. He cleared off the top with his hands to open the back hatch, stomped into the now 2 ft wall to get into the back, must have climbed through the car with his snowy boots on, and just plowed through the wall in the front of his car. \n\nSafe to say he never parked there again, asked my parents every snowfall. He never called the cops about the dog again, but I think that had to do with the conversation he had with the police when he showed them the video, and he moved out a year later. New neighbors are nice, and have no idea why someone would think the dogs amount of barking was excessive. I shovel for them now from time to time when I visit.",

Her (let’s name them THEIF) fitted into no category l, she wasn’t good enough to be classed as a loser. She’d use you as a friend, steal your stuff, lie about it to her parents (who of course believed her) and spammed you with messages. She quite literally, had no friends, and the ones she may have had *clearly* didn’t like her.  She would laugh when she got in trouble, wear the most babyish of clothes, think she was cool, and just be an all round loner.\n\nBack then, in our year, if you had the lowest grade, you were a laughing stock. “Oh, but at least you aren’t as bad as [insert low grade person]”. You were the star of all school related jokes.\n\nContext: When someone copies from me, I do mind. And I mind greatly. And care a little less when...\n\n-they copy from me and I let them\n-they copy me and change words\n-they copy me and tell me\n-they look at my work but don’t copy.\n\nOnwards with the story!\n\nOne time in English, and had to sit next to thief. My teacher loved me (since I was the only person who would listen), and she asked me to sit next to thief and to give her tips and stuff (not that I wanted to).\n\nIn that lesson, we had to analyse a picture, and write a poem or shirt story about it.\nI liked English, and decided to put up with thief next to me (but made no effort to talk to her). \n\nA while later, I finish first and sit there reading a book. In my perivaral  vision, I can see what she’s written, and it’s very similar to mine....*very similar*. Oh wait, **it IS** mine. I say nothing, and move back to my normal seat, and she goes back to sit next to her assistant (let’s call her TA).\n\nAs we go over our work, I ask to mark thief’s work (since I was ‘helping her’). I called her out on copying me, and she said “no. You were copying me”\n\nDid you just say that?\n\nI say nothing, and just stare at her. TA asks thief questions about her work (obviously thinking she’d done it). Thief goes back and forth between me and her desk (for some reason). \n\nAfter a while, our teacher asks ‘thief, why do you keep going over to [me]” \n\n*“Because im marking [me] work”*\n\n“She was asking me for help, since she clearly didn’t write her work herself”\n\n*”actually. You were asking me for help, so why you lying for”*\n\nAt this point, I was kinda done with her crap, and just wanted to sit and read. \n\n“I, asked *you* to help me.”\n\n*”yeah duh”*\n\n“Tell me this, thief. Why would I, a level 9 student, be asking you, a level 2 student for help?”\n\n*”wtf I’m not a level 2”*\n\n“Prove it then, read out your work”\n\nShe doesn’t read it at first. And then when she starts to, she can’t even pronounce half the words written. \n\n“What does that word mean?”\n\n*”Do you know what it means? Say it then”*\n\n“Sorry, but I don’t help low level lying cheaters”\n\nAt this point, the class was starting to laugh, and the TA was looking rather confused. At this point, I decided to read out my work, and the look on her face was priceless. And after all of this? Guess what she did?\n\n*”miss. She copied all my work, and she does this in all my other lessons”*\n\n“If I did this in all lessons with you, you think I’d be a level 2 student too, based off of your appalling work. Don’t ask me for help ever again, asshole”\n\nThe class was laughing way too hard, and my teacher didn’t do anything.\n\nI’m pretty sure she failed a lot of her classes, and probably went crying home to her parents.\n\nTLDR: girl in my class copies all my work, denied it, can’t read out ‘her’ work, still denies it, and I expose her grade.\n\nEdit: oh yeah, I also ended up throwing her stuff on the floor, for some reason. I was a strange teenager.",

        "text": "Holaaa!\n\nSo I'm not sure if this is petty but it truly makes me feel awesome. Some years ago I worked at a retail place. The story begins with a cashier supervisor, let's call her Amelia, who was extremely rude. One of the worst acts Amelia committed was that she made you feel like nothing through condescending acts. For example, when she yelled at an employee for doing something wrong she did it in front of customers. Furthermore, Amelia also called everyone muchacho/a (Spanish for boy/girl) when she clearly remembered their names (this is demonstrated by how she yelled at them by their names a couple of minutes after the fact). The list can go on and on. I eventually moved on from the job. My pettiness comes when I go to the store and Amelia is working and I go up to her with a big smile and say: \"Hey, muchacha.\" She clearly gets annoyed and wants to tell me to go fix racks or something else but alas she can't. Once I finish talking to her about how good things are going I go, and have friendly conversations with my ex-coworkers. \n\n",

        "text": "I went out of town to visit some family last week. During this trip, my husband and I went to go eat at the restaurant where my cousin works. My cousin is roughly my age, so we have always been close. While we are eating, some girl comes in. Let’s call her “Kristen”. Well, Kristen comes in with some dude wanting to be seated on the patio. A host told them that the patio was full, but that they could be seated inside immediately. That’s when my cousin walked up to the front of the restaurant. She seemed to know the girl, and politely seated Kristen and the dude inside. My cousin told me later that she dated Kristen’s ex. Basically, Kristen has a vendetta and was out to get her petty revenge. She complained about my cousin, saying that she had denied her the patio, made rude remarks and gave terrible service. We knew this to be false. As stated previously, Kristen was not even denied the patio by my cousin, but by a different host. Kristen and dude made a big deal out of literally nothing, got free margaritas, and got my cousin fired. This was upsetting to all of us, but we decided to let it go, get some coffee, and have a good night despite it. \n\nWell, a few days later, my husband, cousin, and I go to a popular sporting goods store. We see Kristen working as I’m looking for some sweatpants to wear on the drive back home. My cousin points her out to me. I tell my cousin that she should complain, saying that she asked for a larger size of sweatpants and that Kristen denied her, making rude comments and giving overall bad service. She laughed, and said that she might do it. I buy my sweatpants, we drop my cousin off, and begin our road trip home. \n\nOnce we were home, my cousin facetimed me. She called to report that she indeed had complained to the sporting goods store, just as I had specified. The store said that they’d take action with Kristen, and give my cousin a gift card. To quote my cousin, “Get me fired for a free margarita? Bitch, I’ll get you fired for free sweatpants.”\n\n*edit* typos",

I ended up dating  one of the girls on the team and it was going pretty good for a while. Then we broke up and she started dating one of my best friends who also happened to be on the team. So I sat around moping for a little bit, then started looking for someone new. Whilst I was doing that, apparently she was telling all the girls how horrible of a person I was. The reason we had broken up is because I had accidentally hit on one of her friends one day when I was really tired. Then a different one of her friends asked me to make out with her so she could get back at her ex. My ex then proceeded to throw a fit because I'm not allowed to screw around with her friends. Im just sitting there thinking, \"So I can't screw around with your friends but you can go and date one of my best friends on the night you dumped me?\"\n\nRevenge:\n\nSo since we're both if the same robotics team and since we travel for competitions, we take buses a lot. At one of these said competitions, we got done and were gonna be heading to dinner. Now her and her new bf are sitting together and it's just generally annoying everyone around them. They aren't on the bus yet so I'm like, \"What the hell, they're seat looks nice\". So I sit down and pretended to sleep for the 30 minute bus ride to dinner just so they couldn't sit together that one time.\n\nTLDR:\n\nEx-gf is a bitch after we break up so I take her and her new-bf's spot and \"sleep\" in it.",

        "text": "Disclaimer: this whole story happened when I was a  very young and shy child.\n\nIt was summer at the time, and I was normally going to the beach/shore with my family. It had a structure and a bar. I had some friends there. \n\nNow I was more excited than normal that day because I planned, with my friends, to sell some old toys there to take new ones, basically something similar to a stall just with a towel where we would put our things, I also brought there some toys I didn't want to sell.\n\nAt about noon my brother, my friend and I would position with our towels and our toys, ready for \"customers\".\n\nAfter about 15 minutes my friend tells me that he needed to go to the bathroom so he told me to check his stuff so nobody would steal it. Alright.\n\nSo I was alone with my brother, which was as shy as me. Shortly after, a middle aged women with her toddler, crying, passes by. \n\nShe looked very annoyed by her toddler which was crying, so she turns towards us, quickly moves her hand down and tooks a toy from my towel. It was one of my favourite toys, a black hot weels car, and I wasn't even selling it!\n\nShe then turns to her child and hands it to him. He immediatly stopped crying, started walking and shortly after, turns around and stuck his tongue out.\n\nI had no idea what was happening, and was too shy and scared to go tell the woman that she stole my toy, and my brother did the same. \nWe stood quiet, watching this kid and his mom walking away from us with my toy.\n\nMy friend returned and saw me crying, he asked what happened and I told him everything. \nWe then told our moms about it, but we couldn't do anything for it, what was done was done.\n\nFast forward to the next day, \nMy friends and I were playing at a Foosball table. I was still pretty bummed out of what happened last day. \n\nSo while we were playing, the woman and her toddler came back. \nShe looked annoyed as always and her toddler was crying.\nShe approached our table and asked to let his toddler play. We, of course, denied and kept playing, she started begging after some time and talked about how much his son wanted to play and that we should let him play ecc. ecc. but we still denied.\n\nEventually she gets up and walks away with his toddler still crying and screaching at her.\n\nI was pretty satisfied of my revenge but I wish I could do more. This story still haunts me to this day.\n\n(Sorry if my English is bad, It's not my native language and I typed everything on phone).",

        "text": "My family went on a day-long vacation to an amusement park. Eight of us in total make for rare yet special family moments. This is one of those moments.\n\n\nThe youngest sister (YS) of the family got ecstatic because she was going to ride the bumper cars without needing an adult. She talked about it nonstop for two weeks, and when the day finally arrived, we were relived to no longer have to hear about it.\n\n\nAround noon, she jumped in line with the oldest sister (OS) of the family while the rest of us took a break from rollercoasters and purchased refreshments.\n\n\nTwenty minutes later, all of us are seated at a table, and we are shocked to see YS exiting from the cars with tears streaming down her face while OS is marching behind her, red faced and fuming!\n\n\nDue her sobbing we can't figure out what happened until OS reaches us. Apparently, there was an idiot highschooler on the bumper cars who got so caught up with hitting people, that he forgot to ease up on the younger kids. He threw his weight around hardcore and made a couple of the kids cry including my YS.\n\n\nWhen OS confronted him afterwards, he simply responded, \"that's the point of the bumper cars\" and left.\n\n\nThe guy didn't even have the decency to check up on anyone or apologize. He indifferently walked right off ignoring those he hurt.\n\n\nThe story got us all pretty heated, especially with our sister crying next to us. She rarely cries. We all attempted to console her, and at that precise moment, OS turned around and saw the culprit getting back in line!\n\n\nAll of us (the entire family) looked at each other, and without saying a word, we proceeded to walk over, and also get in line behind the little turdbucket. The youngest two of the family stayed out to watch.\n\n\nAs we buckled up, kid-rammer had a stupid little smile on his face as he prepared for another round not knowing that our entire family was literally surrounding him with only one target in mind. \n\n\nWhat occured afterwards was a combination of teamwork and a perfectly executed plan. We alternated between trapping him and hitting him. The first to hit would attempt to keep him stuck while the others drove around to gain speed and plaster him to kingdom come!\n\n\nFun fact: When throwing body weight at the point of contact, the hit becomes much more effective; which is what we did. My favorite image that I replay in my head is the kid stuck from front back sides so he can't steer or move, and my dad drives in a bone crushing hit from one side followed by a deafening smash by brother on the other side. The dude's body dramatically shifted from one side to the other.\n\n\nThe assault continued for a good five minutes. Right before the ending bell, two of my sisters got in the best hit I've ever seen. They delivered a bone jarring jolt while he was trapped in the corner. The whiplash he experienced almost made me feel bad for him. Almost.\n\n\nAs we walked out, the dude no longer had a stupid smile on his face, but we sure did. His face grimaced as he rubbed his neck with his hands.\n\n\nHe saw all of us at the exit and I think he put two and two together when he saw YS with us and all of us laughing about the hits we got in.\n\n\nOS walked up to him and said, \"You hurting? I guess that's the point of bumper cars, isn't it? Next time, pick on people your own size\" and walked away. He stood there dumbfounded as we all went back to lunch.\n\n\nTLDR: Idiot teen abuses kids on the bumper cars, my whole family gets back at him.",

        "text": "I wanted to post this to r/neckbeards but I felt the entire exchange was kinda petty. Glad I found this sub.\n\nBack in my grade 11 year I had wormed my way into a number of friend groups, one just so happened to have a Neckbeard, let's call him DoughBeard. DoughBeard was a fellow nerd when it came to technology but he was super elitist, disagreeable and kinda creepy when it came to girls (nothing serious, my friends just said he gave vibes) but he and I were cool. At first he tried to impress my friends by being rude to me in front of them but sucking up when we were alone but eventually he got over it and I thought we were friends. Obviously not.\n\nEventually he got a girlfriend who was kinda weird but I was happy for him nonetheless. Let's call her Koreaboo (she was really into korean pop bands, it was all she talked about). Soon enough I began dating a girl. DoughBeard and Koreaboo told me how they cyber stalked us both for a couple hours after we made it FB official. I figured it was just them being weird and no harm done.\n\nMeanwhile my (female) friends were complaining about DoughBeard sending really uncomfortable snaps to them. Then my GFs best friend tells me she (my GF) blocked some creepy dude trying to hit on her, I ask my GF about it and she says the account was DoughBeards. He obviously knew we were dating considering the creeping through our pages but i gave him the benefit of the doubt and went to confront him.\n\nI start looking for him and a number of my friends (most are in my schools wrestling club with me) tag along to help me find him. I find him in the studying room, politely ask the teacher if we can speak to him outside, and in the hallway we *kinda* surround him while I confront him. \n\nAt first I'm polite, i calmly ask him why he was messaging my girlfriend. He didn't deny he knew who he was messaging, He denied knowing we were dating even though we had talked about it before. At this point I got pissed and I think he got my point through the profanities. He kept putting out stupid excuse after excuse, every single one either didnt make sense or I knew was a lie. I called him a snake and under his breath he said \"no you're a snake.\" \n\nI don't consider myself a petty person but imagine how i felt. I was just backstabbed by some guy who I had at one point thought was my friend. I wanted to hit him but walked away. Naturally stressed out by the entire situation I confided in one of my friends and she in turn offered to send me pictures of his sappy messages.\n\nI said yeah and looked through it, it was a tonne of cringy stuff, my favourite being his \"top 5 girls I would fuck list\". Koreaboo wasn't even on there. My girlfriend was #1.  (weird, sending this to a girl you're htting on.) After a number of these and even a few videos I sent it to Koreaboo. A day later she messages back saying she broke up with him.\n\n1 month later I broke up with my GF for unrelated reasons and at this point am chasing after a girl who just so happened to be Koreaboo's best friend so naturally we all hangout together. One day we are walking down the street and i notice DoughBeard in a sandwich shop. Koreaboo doesn't. I say I want to go in and buy something real quick and offer Koreaboo something to eat to get her to come in  with me.\n\nWhen they were dating, Koreaboo said that DoughBeard looked like the Pillsbury dough boy all the time and he hated it. So Naturally I'm on the way out with Koreaboo, grab her hand, and shout \"Hey Pillsbury\" on the way out.\n\nThe next day he sends a mutual friend to tell me that he's really upset and i should apologize.\n\nPetty? Yes. Called for? Probably Not. Worth it? I would say so. ",

I know it was just for a few hrs 7pm-9pm but I love him so much, he’s my everything. And so one of those rules was: if you’re putting him in the garage you need to let me know. Reason being: I park my car in the garage and I know my dog will run out into the street. She never told me he was in the garage and so I pulled into the garage and he ran out behind my car and onto the street and a car almost hit him &amp; had just stopped in time. I was PISSED and without caring I did yell at her i front of everyone for not telling me he was in the garage. And she just said “oh sorry” and went back to rolling a blunt. And we did the surprise and I wanted to kick her out, everyone knew what happened at this point and they felt bad for me and my dog was shaking (prob bc I was so scared myself)\nAnd then she went out w everyone to smoke, I don’t smoke so I stayed inside. I saw her car keys so I just dropped them in the trash. I was MAD so idgaf if she is my best friend, I’m tired of her “i don’t care about anyone but me”\n\nShe did come out and apologize properly but lol too late her keys are in the trash right now :) I’m obviously still mad",

        "text": "When i was in high school, there was this one group of boys that would terrorize any classroom they got in. It didn't matter if it was debate club, drama class, they would sign up for anything and talk shit all class, annoy the teachers and get away with it. \n\nNow, every three months, my school changed the main classes. And I was unfortunate enough to end up stuck with them every morning and half of my afternoon for three months, and worse of all: we also had fixed groups for group projects, and one of them was in mine. Being completely negligent and lowering all of our grades. \n\nI had studied with them for a whole year before that, i knew how awful they were. I had to endure them mocking the autistic boy. I had to listem to them talk about how rape should be legal. I had to hear them making rumors about fucking their cousins, for some reason. But what made me want to get my revenge was something much lesser than that. \n\nIt was sociology test day, and the last one from that quarter. I watched all three of the boys decide whom to sit next to, and when one of them turned to my direction and sat on the place next to me, i knew he wanted to cheat from my test. It was obvious. I was going really well in that subject, I took extra classes with the teacher and I was overall a good student. \n\nAlso, I knew his grades weren't great because he hadn't done the group presentation. It was an opportunity.\n\nThis teacher made a test with 5 questions, each with five options. I marked the first question on pen, and i saw tweedledum next to me mark the exact same answer, right after, and on pen. So yeah, he was obviously cheating. And not even looking to what I had just chosen. \n\nI proceeded answering the test, all on pencil. But instead of choosing the correct option, I marked the most absurd one, the one that was most obviously wrong. I did that to the four remaining questions, making sure he could see all of my answers. \n\nOnce he took the test to the teacher, i marked all of the correct answers in pen, erased the pencil marks and handed the test in as well. \n\nLater that day, I talked to that teacher during cinema class, the extracurricular he taught. I asked him if he had noticed he was cheating from me earlier, and he told me didn't see anything out of the ordinary, but he didn't doubt it. I then told him he would have fun correcting his test.\n\nWhen the time came for us to have out tests back, i was not impressed to see I had scored a perfect 10. In fact, most of the class had done pretty well on it, given it was a short test and the subject wasn't particularly hard. Even tweedledum's friends, who likely cheated from other people or their phones, had gone pretty well. \n\nSo when he took his test and saw he scored a 2, he was very shocked. I could hear him talking to his friends, concerned about who had also taken that score so he could figure out who he'd cheated from. Honestly, it even offended me a little that he'd forgotten it was me. \n\nBut hearing him say he was fucked, and that his grades would end up way too low? Yeah, I felt proud. I look at my teacher, and we shared a knowing smile. In the end, he kept cheating on tests, as I knew he would. I don't really care about cheating, to be honest. The problem is, I don't like people who annoy me and my friends taking the easy way out through my work. \n\nSo yeah, I'm glad I did it. I wish I could have done the same to his other friends, but the opportunity only presented itself once, and I took it. ",

        "text": "Sorry for format, mobile. TLDR at bottom.\n\nBackground: A few years back I used to mow my neighbors lawn. They were decently old but still very spry (running marathons and such) and had this beautiful German Shepherd. They never took the dog on walks, so he just dropped his payload in his favorite spot, which I dubbed, the minefield. Now on to the story.\n\nMy first few weeks were alright, not too much to handle or avoid so I didn't say anything. Eventually it started to pile up. First, I got the entire bottom of both my shoes coated in the stuff. I asked them nicely to clean up after their dog and they agreed, but did not commit.\n\nThe second time, it got stuck in the mower. All over the blades, the wheels, everywhere. So again, I asked them to clean up and still they did not. So the next time I found the massive dung pile, I said that if they didn't clean it up, I wouldn't come back next summer. (I worked for a much lower rate than landscapers did and they couldn't afford them) They said, \"point made, we'll clean it up.\" Boy was I foolish.\n\nAfter a few more times and I finally sought my revenge. I decided, if they won't clean the spot, I won't mow it. So I let the minefield grow, and grow, and grow until it eventually became about 2ft high. Sounds like a light revenge, right? Oh it gets better.\n\nBirds started nesting in there, bugs started staying in there. The best part of my day would be looking out my back window with a cup of coffee watching as the birds would scare the life out of them every time they walked by. Plus I eventually heard about their dog tracking bugs back into the house. \n\nThey never commented on it, I still got paid, and quit at the end. \n\nTLDR: neighbors didn't clean after their dog, I let the lawn grow into a breeding ground for jump scares.\n\n",

        "text": "Back in 2011, I was a 20 year old gal living at the mercy of my “in laws”.  The family consisted of the dad (picture Danny DeVito minus any level of cool), the living embodiment of Satan as a mom, my boyfriend at the time and his little 18 year old sister who was a spoiled brat. I’d just moved to the States from my home country overseas and was waiting for my work visa to process. In the mean time, I was basically treated as a house slave for this trashy, middle-class-but-think-they’re-hot-shit family of weirdos. Seriously, the mom was insane and I could never please the woman. The sister slept in the bed with her mom while the dad slept on the floor with the dog. The dad once tried to attack my boyfriend with a baseball bat because we didn’t bring him home a subway sandwich. I’m talking really outlandishly dysfunctional, Dr. Phil intervention levels of weirdness going on in this household. \n\nAnywho, one fine day in Hell, spoiled brat Sister and I were asked to do chores (a daily requirement for me, a fortnightly job for Sister), specifically the chore of cleaning the bathrooms. The deal was I would do the main family bathroom, and she would do the ensuite in her parents room. Of course she did fuck all and I did both bathrooms, emptied all the trash cans, vacuumed the whole house and changed all the bed sheets. \n\nLucifer herself comes home from work and her offspring comes bounding up to her “look Mom I did both bathrooms! I took out the trash and did the vacuuming too!” Of course the Mom laps this up like a dog eating leftover spaghetti. I just sit back, dumbfounded at the fact that Sister has just taken every ounce of credit for my entire day of work. To rub salt in the wound, I later found out the Mom gave her a card with cash in it, thanking her for all her hard work. Cool right? \n\nSo I did what any woman scorned would do, Cinderella style. I took the toothbrush of both Mom and Sister and scrubbed right under the lip of the toilet bowl. You know, the part that never really gets cleaned properly. Of course there was nasty residue on the bristles so I swirled it around in the toilet water for a bit then popped them back in the toothbrush holder. That night I stood in the bathroom doorway and watched while Sister brushed her teeth niiiiiice and thoroughly. \n\nShe never found out but to this day, the satisfaction that petty revenge gave me still puts a smile on my face. If you’re reading this Lauren, HAHA, you brushed your teeth with poop water and it’s hilarious. ",

        "text": "Not sure if this is petty or even revenge, but I'll post it here anyways. Also, I am on mobile.\n\nIn 5th grade there was this kid that always had a problem with me. We will call him Barry. Me and Barry were in accelerated reading and math classes so we saw each other alot, and we both played 4-Square. In the beginning of 5th grade (i joined this school in 5th grade) both of us were kind of friends. However, this kid was always passive agressive to me. He was careful not to be too mean, but just mean enough, so I couldn't report him or do anything about it without being seen as a baby. \n\nOne day his constant berating got to me and I absolutely lost it and punched him\n\nI was sent to the Office and had a chat with a school official. I blabbed to her about all the things he had done. He didn't get in trouble but I didn't either. But I did punch him. \n\nFast Forward to 6th grade. I was dumb and decided to give him another chance and be friends. By this time I had alot more friends than before and had matured. Alot. By this time I had begun my transformation into a fantasy nerd and decided to write my fantasy novel. However I needed a artist- and the only one fit for the job in my elementary school was Barry.\n\nSo I hired him. We agreed that 25% of the profits from my novel would go to him. He drew good and we were friends again.\n\nUntil he started bossing me around and taking control of my novel. He wanted our 75-25 deal to be 50-50 and then wanted it to be 40-60. He also told me that I needed to work faster on the novel and tried to take complete control of it.\n\nSo I fired him. \n\nHe immediately started being passive agressive with me and started to get his friends to be mean to me. It was horrible. However- he also wanted to join a club we had, Battle of the Books, a reading competition. I knew that he was usually 3rd place in these competitions, enough to be on the official team for our school. I decided to knock him down a notch.\n\nI entered and read every single book. Testing time came and I got a 75% - best score - and he got a measly 52%. He was the subsitiute, on the bench. Our other teammate didn't attend, so unfortunately he got to attend the competition. We lost.\n\nAfter that, however, he started going downhill. I would not see him with his usual friends, and his friends were actually quite nice-, his friends became my friends, and he became likely to a loner. He also started getting defeated in other tests. He was usually viewed as the 2nd or 3rd smartest kid- I took that position away from him.\n\nIn the summer after 6th grade I had unblocked him on Instagram because I wanted to see his schedule and make sure we had no shared classes for 7th grade. \n\nHe began pleading for me to become his friend. I said that I had given him many chances before, and I would not give him another. He also accused me of starting rumors- he said he would ignore all that to be my friend again.\n\nI laughed and blocked him again.\n\n",

I find this agricultural cooperative that hires people for work in the fields, involving corn. It's also 500m away from my place and it's perfect. I get a good vibe there at the group interview. We're going to fertilize corn and we have to wear pants and jackets in 30+ Celsius heat. That's quite a bummer but hey it's a 30 day job, I can make it.\n\nWe are managed on site by that 40 year old stern looking woman who I have never seen smile, she drives us to the fields every morning, not even uttering a word during the 15min drive, and once there she assigns us rows of corn to fertilize. The job is physically hard. We literally bend over all the time to self-fertilize corn and cover the 'female' parts of the plant with little transparent plastic bags while wearing inadapted gloves. It's really tough and the heat is unbearable. There was a time I was looking forward to, and it was lunch time ( forget about other breaks we never had any ) . There we all sat in the shade and ate our sandwiches. The group was nice, mostly young people and a couple unemployed people. A really nice group. I break the ice very quickly and soon enough I become the 'fun' guy of the group, cracking jokes, initiating conversations on a wide range of topics, and so on. I realized that the lady ( let's call her Bitch ) didn't like her employees creating bonds(especially the young ones) and she sometimes cut our break short when we were laughing too loud for some bullshit excuse ' our quota is not going to be met' and so on...and there we went for another 4-5 hours in the heat, not seeing anyone, bending over forever until she called us back to the truck and drove us home, without a word except for criticizing our work.\n\nSometimes she came to inspect our work and yelled loudly for us to come over so she could yell at us face-to-face about how easy the job was and reprimand us. I noticed she didn't like me at all because I was the funny guy. I knew it. She took pleasure in swooping on me unannounced and telling me that my work was shit. She also treated our only black coworker like that, so much that on the third day I saw that coworker crying silently in the truck on the way home, we all felt uneasy as hell.\n\nOn day 4, she is called somewhere else and leaves us for a few hours. We naturally decide to take a break ( as the law allows us by the way ) in the middle of the afternoon. I see my coworkers literally transform and feel relieved by her absence. We chat and laugh and go back to work as soon as we see her little shitty truck bumping on the road. Too late though. She bursts out of the vehicle and demands to know who initiated that break. No one says shit. She looks at me and the black coworker and says ' productivity is our only objective, so you, you and...you ( she looked for another colleague, a slightly overweight young mom) are fired ' . So me, Bitch, the black girl and the mom share an awkward and dead silent ride back to base. Once Bitch leaves, the black coworker laughs it off and says ' good riddance she was a bitch, I'll just go work at my uncle's restaurant ' , hugs us and leaves. The mom however breaks down crying and tells me that this job was her only way to get money for herself and her kids, and that she wouldn't have money to buy them school supplies for september. To this day it is still one of the most heartbreaking moments I have witnessed. I was fine, as I had my parents house to myself with plenty of food to last until their return. I gave her the 50 bucks my dad had left me. She thanks me and boards the bus, still crying in the summer heat. I felt terrible.\n\nThat night my best friend came to visit. I told him I'd been fired and that the job was crappy anyway. When I told him what I was doing there he interrupted me ' but you worked for a GMO company !! they're breeding engineered crops and once the gathering is done, they send the crops to the southern hemisphere for another growth cycle, it's the shit food of tomorrow' .\n\nAt the time, GMO had suddenly become a hot topic in my country, and the public opinion was scared of them. I hated reading about farmers getting their crops contaminated by GMO and the products used on them. Bear in mind I was living in a rural area close to Paris, full of wheat fields and various crops.\n\nAn idea popped up in my mind after a couple beers. I told my friend and off we went in the midst of night. I guided him on the road to the fields, he parked away from the road and we used his flashlight to navigate in the crops. WE MADE SURE TO CROSSBREED ALL THE CORN PLANTS WE SAW. Literally it meant touching the corn with our bare hands and touching the exposed female parts of other plants, ruining the process of genetic improvement these people were putting in place. We were told it was forbidden to do it, as it would mean getting fired. lol.\n\nIt took us a couple hours, and it was fun knowing I was taking part in something that I considered morally ok.\n\nA couple of months later I bumped into one of the employees who told me the batch that was harvested was genetically compromised and that this activity would be relocated from the following year on. Funny thing is the following summer I worked at a little supermarket close to the agro company, and Bitch came once to buy groceries. I checked her items out in complete silence, with a broad smile on my face. I enjoyed it. She visibly didn't.\n\nTo this day I don't feel any regret.\n\nTLDR :  agricultural manager behaves like a shitty boss to me and several colleagues, and eventually fired us. As revenge I destroyed most of the controversial GMO crops the company was growing, ruining a part of their activity. \n\nedit : 1st sentence structure",

        "text": "First time Poster, Long Time Lurker.\n\nSo a little bit of context.\n\nI began dating this lame guy during junior college that was a total man-whore. Fools around with many of my friends at the same time as his then GF. As a friend he was pretty decent, but I never really considered him anything more. Skip to two years later when we both happen to live in another state, I'm 18 and an \"adult\". I go visit him and another friend. He's single and seems to have become a better person. We start dating and come back to our home state. 4 months in our relationship (after drama within my own friends) he begins cheating on me with ex-GF. This girl never really liked me in HS or after for that matter. She would be so awkward, rude, and just very hateful towards me when I was dating the man-whore. Granted I wasn't really an angel of a person, but this girl was straight up psychopathic. I mean young love makes you do dumb shit, I get it. This goes on for almost a year, back and forth FWB-shit between me *and* her. Finally after *all* the cheating and heartbreak, he tells me she got knocked up and it is his. A lot of us assume that she was crazy enough to get pregnant on purpose. You never know, I never asked. In all honesty, that kid made it easier for me move on. (I am grateful it wasn't me in her place.) For years after that though, I was *completely miserable and depressed.*\n\nFast forward to seven years later. I am in a happy relationship with my partner for 4+ years. I have two great jobs, one of which is the beginning of my professional career. And starting my Master's degree, even after a shitty junior college experience due to a traumatic relationship.\n\nTHREE DAYS AGO:\n\nI see the ex-GF in front of my house. Like **DIRECTLY** in front of my house underneath my tree due to the shade. Note that it is EXTREMELY HOT this day like 108\\*. I manage drive past her and duck my head because maybe she forgot I where I lived and head to breakfast. I come back 1.5 hour later and she is still there! My house is kind of unforgettable, it is straight up a jungle. I know she knows it's my place. I park my car for a few minutes and try to fight the urge to just ignore her and avoid any potential drama. Facebook shit, non-stop phone calling, egging of my house, knocking my door to ask if sleazeball has come around (just immature stuff.)\n\nI muster up the balls to go up to her. I tell her immediately that I haven't seen sleazeball since forever and ask her if she needs help. I notice how skinny and frail she looks, I don't want to assume she's on drugs... but y'know, I really couldn't help it. The vibes just came across. I give her a cold glass of water, let her use my cell, and actually give her a ride up the street to a gas station. During the ride, she proceeds to tell me she lives with some other dude (who has a tear-face tattoo?), his crack head room-mate, and how they are planning to attack her because they're accusing her of stealing?? As she unloads her laundry basket and waste bin from my trunk I just say good luck and hope her kid is doin' good. I drive off with a wave and after I turn the corner, I let out a long and happy laugh.\n\nIt may not be the coldest revenge, but the petty joy I felt from being a bigger person and STILL come out to have a better life was very VERY sweet.\n\nEDIT: fixed misspelled words",

        "text": "Edit: DH = husband, BF = boyfriend. \n\nSo not entirely sure if this belongs here, let me know if not.\n\nWe lived in a villa (a small house that has at least one wall connected to the next door neighbour's house, a front yard the size of a postage stamp and a backyard that would have been okay, if small, if it had grass instead of pavers) and I went to work regularly about 20 mins after my now DH, then BF. Most of the other people in the villas were elderly but DH had bought one as a way to get into the property market.\n\nNext door (the neighbour whose lounge room was seperated from ours by a wall) would come out her front door magically about 10 minutes after DH left, so that by the time I walked down the front to my car, she'd be almost level with it (she walked slow). Being a polite sort (my mama raised me with manners and to respect the elderly) I would offer her a ride. I did this maybe 5 times before this incident.\n\nGot down to my car, offered the \"not-waiting\" neighbour a ride, she accepted, we get in the car, I attempt to make small talk, and as I click my seatbelt, I ask where she was off to today (I'd dropped her at three different places before). In a snooty tone she replies \"Does it matter? You already said you would take me.\" I replied back that I wanted to know where to take her. (I thought it was a pretty fair question.)\n\nAs she gets out of the car, instead of saying thankyou for the ride, she told me I shouldn't offer rides if I don't want to take her places. (For reference: her tone was similar to the one you'd use after finding excrement on your shoe.)\n\nSo I decided, from then on, I wouldn't. I was done being her free taxi, since she couldn't even treat me like a human being. I left earlier and earlier, no discernible pattern to my leaving times, so she couldn't \"just happen\" to be near my car. There were two times after that, that she left the house around the same time as me - the first I \"forgot\" something and had to loop back around and go in and get it. The second, I walked straight past her, got in my car, and drove off.\n\nHer son moved in not long after that (in about his fifties?) and drove her wherever she needed to go from then on.",

        "text": "Edit: for everyone bitching, where I live the servers make minimum wage and this particular restaurant offered their servers benefits as well. So keep arguing but this woman made her $13 an hour regardless of what I did. \n\nThis story takes place in a town where everyone who stays ends up bitter and with a sad life. I was getting some extra credits from a community style college for my degree in Big City, and I was also working at Game Store. \n\nOne evening after Game Store had closed, our manager asked my coworker and I if we wanted to go out for dinner at a newer restaurant. We all agreed and headed out. \n\nWe entered the restaurant and we were seated by a scowly looking woman. She wasn’t unpleasant per se, but she definitely looked that way. We all order our food, eat, and when we’re done we’re finishing chatting and my manager says to us “hey you guys, if you pay your own bills I will get the tip yeah?”, so we all agree and he does the math on what the 18% tip would be if our bill was all together - it’s about $15- $20 \n\nOur server comes and asks us if the bill is all together or separate, we say separate and she bring us our bills. We are then told to meet her at the counter to pay with our debit cards. So we all line up, my coworker and I paying first with my manager paying last. \n\nMy coworker pays and doesn’t tip, the server sees this and her scowl gets deeper. Then I pay, and I don’t tip, and she turns red as her scowl gets even deeper and she very rudely half shouts at us “it’s extremely RUDE not to tip me!! Are you guys serious??”\n\nMy manager is in front of her as she says this, and she huffs and hands him the debit machine. He looks up at her, and back at us, and then he slowly smirks as he enters his debit information into the machine. \n\nAs the receipt is printing he hands it back to her and says “I was going to pick up the tip for all of us, but after what you just did I don’t even think I’ll be coming back here again. Hope your day is better!” and we all walk out. \n\nShe tried to stammer out an excuse and got very flustered but we were too busy walking away and talking about  new game that just came in. \n\nTLDR: Out for dinner with work crew and manager offers to pick up the tip. Is going to pay it until the waitress has a mean outburst. ",

We aren't employed through any company, so I was assuming she would say no, because she isn't under any obligation to pay more for extra work. I reasoned by saying \"I don't want to stay almost 2 hours later for the same pay, it doesn't seem fair.\" Let me provide some context by saying she does not like me at all, she's hella anti Semitic, I could go on for days about that woman. At least she's old, right?? She COULD HAVE just said no, but instead she told me \"I don't like that you fuck my daughter, you can consider that your bonus\" I told her I was cashing my bonus when she walked in on us later in OUR OWN HOME and bitched us out.

        "text": "I used to frequent an arcade near my high school, skipping classes whenever I felt like shoving quarters into a machine to play Space Invaders, Asteroids or Galaxian.  This was a long, long time ago.  So long, that Jimmy Carter the peanut farmer was busy losing the presidency to Reagan the actor, and computer video games were in their infancy. Sometimes I’d be alone; other times there’d be other guys from school who like me didn’t give a shit about classes, we’d all hang out watching each other play.  A bunch of teenage boys getting all excited, yelling stuff, being kids.  \n\nThe arcade was big, by the standards of our not-too-large city.  The arcade had two floors.  The first floor was devoted mainly to the old style pinball machines.  I’m not sure those even exist anymore, but in the late 70s / early 80s pinball machines were still a big deal.   I wasn’t a big fan of the pinball machines. I sucked at pinball.  I’d try now and again, but the silver ball always seemed to go right down the middle, despite me hammering the side buttons and screaming for all I was worth.   So I was usually to be found on the second floor, blasting aliens.  When there were a bunch of us, usually one would be playing, and the others would hang around to watch.  We took turns.  We competed.  None of us had much cash, so I guess this was one way of stretching out the play time.\n\nExcept the owner of the arcade didn’t like that.  The owner (or maybe she was only the manager) was this really annoying woman. I never saw her.  Nobody did.  She worked in a back room somewhere, monitoring the place via video cameras.  She hated to see a bunch of kids standing around a machine watching another kid play.  In her view, everyone should be playing all the time, and not watching their friends play. So when she spotted this happening, she’d extend a pudgy hand (for I pictured her as a fat 300lb+ beast) to touch the intercom button, and then her white-trash voice, made harsh by too much booze and cigarettes, would intone,\n\n“Hey guys!  Play some games.  PLAY SOME GAMES!”\n\nNow I have to say that I have this thing about the imperative.  I really hate it.  I’ve always hated it.  I have never liked being ordered about.  I don’t like giving orders, either.  I don’t like telling people what to do, and it really bugs me that there are people out there who get off on issuing their stupid commands.  The “PLAY SOME GAMES” edict I found particularly galling.  It was basically the same thing as saying, “GIVE ME SOME FUCKING MONEY”.  Now I guess if I were the owner, I’d want everyone to PLAY SOME GAMES too, but I don’t think I’d use an intercom to bark commands in a whiny, bitchy voice in order to accomplish this.\n\nSo anyways, one day I was upstairs at the arcade with some guys from school having a good \ntime, when we were interrupted by the “PLAY SOME GAMES” command.  I had been expecting it, and I’d come prepared.\n\n“Hey guys, we gotta play some games,” I said, moving over to a game that had a horizontal, table-top style mount.  I forget what game it was; it wasn’t one of the ones we usually played.  For what I had in mind, I needed to use a machine where the CRT screen was easily accessible to the player, and the horizontal style machines were perfect for my needs.\n\n“That game sucks!”, my friends objected.  “Don’t worry about it,” I said.  “Let me show you how we can play for free.”  That got everyone interested, and so they crowded around, which, as you will learn shortly, was necessary for what was to follow.  \n\nOnce everyone was around the table and I was somewhat shielded from the video cameras, I reached into my pocket.  I pulled out a sock.    “Watch this,” I said, “and don’t react.”\n\nI then placed the sock on the surface, and began to move it around.   Inside the sock, was a very powerful magnet.  It wasn’t nearly as good as the rare earth magnets you can buy nowadays, but it was pretty good.  Good enough that you could very easily fuck up a CRT display, rendering the machine temporarily useless.  After a few passes with my magnet, all the screen could display was a jumble of meaningless, pretty patterns. After messing up that screen, we sat around it for a while, pretending that nothing was wrong and that were were still playing.  I fucked up a few more screens, and then went back to class, chuckling about the time the owner would spend degaussing a bunch of machines.\n\nI made a habit of keeping that magnet with me whenever I went to the arcade.  Whenever the “PLAY SOME GAMES” announcement was heard, I fucked up a screen.  I doubt the owner ever made the connection.  She sounded pretty dumb. \n",

I  and other guys (there would only be one guy on the line) would be asked to clean out the tray which sometimes involve getting in the shaft which was dangerous.\nI complained about this, a senior  manger said it was was not our job and maintenance staff should be called which meant a huge delay and they were really incompetent and didnt want to do anything.\n\nSo on my soon to be last day, a tray smashed, the shift leader told me (with no politeness) to go fix it. I said calmly \" this is too dangerous, you know very well we are not supposed to go in there and we are to call maintenance\" she ignored me and just said \"never mind that,  Patients need to be fed, I need you to clean it out now\" I took off my apron and said \" you need to go fuck off, I quit\"  she said \"you cant quit, you will never get a good reference from this hospital\", I said \"since when is a shitty high school dishwashing job a required reference for engineering, you can stuff your reference up your ass and besides you are the one who will need a reference when I make sure you are fired\". She told me \"your fired, get out\" as I was walking out the door even though I said I quit.\n\nWhen i got home I sent an email to the senior manager, copied the health and safety manager outlining how the manager knew better but forced me to work into a well known dangerous job situation which was clearly not in my job description.\n\nShe was fired. This was like the last straw for that manager, most of the staff hated her and there had been other incidents.\nAn HR manager called me about a week later to apologize and said refusing unsafe work is the appropriate approach. You can report back to work.\nI said \"thank you very much for calling but I'm not interested\" \nMy wife asked who that was, I said it was a telemarketer from the bank selling insurance.\n\nDone, never looked back.\n",

        "text": "I was just at a store that has a play area for kids. My kids played while I shopped for a gift. We were in there for no more than 20 minutes beginning to end. I always stay within earshot of my kids to make sure they are being kind to each other and other children. \n\nA little background on my kids. For the most part, my children want to be friends with EVERYONE. They are eager to make new friends everywhere we go and everyone's parents always tell us how sweet our kids are for playing so nicely with their kids. They go out of their way to share and be friendly. I'm not one of those parents who think their kids can do no wrong. I am the first to correct my children if they are being a$$holes and admittedly, my son can *sometimes* be a little ornery when holding his ground.\n\nSo back to the situation at hand. I could hear my kids occasionally getting a little frustrated and expressing displeasure with something. I kind of thought they were bickering amongst themselves as siblings are wont to do. So I quickly wrapped up my shopping and headed for the play area to monitor them from a distance. \n\nI witnessed a little boy my son's age being a possessive over a train table, not allowing my kids to play while his father chatted on his cellphone ignoring or not caring that his son was being a little $hit to my kids. So I walked into the area and asked my kids in my most unassuming voice: \"Are we being kind to each other?\" And they kind of said yes, but I could tell they were holding back what was really happening and the little boy tried to and show me what an \"angel\" he was being.\n\nI told my kids that we would be leaving soon so the boy says, \"You guys have to leave now.\" That got my goat. I was not about to let this little $hit get away with being an a$$hole just because his dad was sitting 10 ft away.  So I looked around and saw a large marble run that I kind of wanted to play with myself, so I told them to look for a small ball in the play bins with no luck. I then read a sign that said to ask the front desk for marbles. They both went and politely asked for marbles and came back and proceeded to play at the cool marble run. \n\nYou can only guess what happened next. The boy proceeded to ask if he could have a turn. Without missing a beat, I said he would have to get his own marble. He went to his dad and started whinging and crying and they left the area. It. was. glorious. \n\nTLDR; A boy was being an a$$hole to my kids so I was an a$$hole back to him and he went crying to his daddy. ",

        "text": "This story happened back in the 80's in small town America involving our favorite past-time, football. I was a senior, but an average outside linebacker on the football team. We (Delano) had a particular hateful rivalry with another school (Watertown). It was usually between the two for conference championship and bragging rights. The reason for the hatred was that most years the game was a hard-fought battle. In addition, the victor's taunting usually spilled into other sports. \n\nIt was the second to last game of the year, once again the conference championship was on the line. It was played at on Watertown's home field. This game was especially grueling as it went into 4 OT! I was so exhausted after the 3rd OT that I wished it would just end. Well it did. Unfortunately, we were on the short end. The team was completely drained, frustrated, and depressed as we lumbered back to our bus to find that someone threw a fence post through two windows of our bus. We were all irate, including the coaching staff, but there was nothing we could do about it...just wanted to go home. This was late October in Minnesota, hence the 30 minute ride home was freezing. While I was shivering and angry, I vowed to seek revenge!\n\nWe were still considered mostly a farming community. If you have ever grew up in a small farming town, you know farm boys like to get into trouble. We made the most of our free time since it was a very limited resource with school and chores taking the lion's share. I had three older brothers that boasted of numerous successful pranks, luckily I had them as consultants! Our challenge was to leave our mark, yet not make it obvious it was us (Delano). Over the next couple of days we stewed over our options and devised the perfect plan. We would literally burn their field, well at least part of it. We couldn't burn a \"D\" because they would know it was Delano, leading to our school administrators interrogating the team to identify the perps. We needed to be more creative. Watertown's next opponent was Kimbal, though meaningless, they would be hosting a playoff game the following week. So we decided to burn a \"K\" at mid-field. Also, the playoff game would be played in November, with the ground frozen there was no way to repair the damage, ha!\n\nThe plan was that the night before (Midnight) the game three of us would sneak onto their field to pour the gas while a driver waited in the car to signal if anyone was headed in our direction. Headlamps were not mainstream back in the 80's, thus required one guy to shine a flashlight while the other two dumped the gasoline. The night arrives and \"Mark\" picks each of us up in his car. The plan was to use a two gallon can, well \"John\" could only find a FIVE gallon can (FYI cans full of gas were always available on a farm). We had to get in and out town fast since the only people on the road late on a school night is the town cop. If he saw a car full of teens, our plan would have to be abandoned. \n\nWe arrive in Watertown, field located in town with numerous houses close by so we turned our headlights off as we drew close. We knew just where to park since we had scouted it out earlier in the week. Using emergency brake to stop, along with previously removing the fuse for the interior lights we three quickly snuck out with the gas cans and bolted for the field. We locate mid field and proceeded to pour the gas in somewhat straight lines to make a \"K\" that extends from one 45 yard line to the other. Gas all poured, being the flashlight guy meant also being the fire starter for obvious reasons. In hindsight, we should of had the other two get a head start toward the car because the three of us were spread out at different points when the match ignited the fumes. \"Mark\" looking from the car said the seven gallons of gas produced so much light he thought someone turned the stadium lights on, so he drove away. The light and force of the fire startled the three of us, sending \"John\" running in the wrong direction. Myself and \"Tom\" ran toward the car only to discover it wasn't there. However, we spotted him up the street slowly approaching so we ran to him and jumped in. To our dismay \"John\" wasn't in the car! What do we do because the field is on fire and surely someone called the fire department. We had to get out of there fast sans our friend. After 30 minutes, assuming the town cop was at the field, we go back to town after hiding in the outskirts. Luckily, we guessed right and found him walking along main street at 1:00 AM with his Letter jacket turned inside-out. He jumps in and we get away unnoticed.\n\nThe four of us had a good relationship with our coach. He must have assumed we were not going to let the fence post incident go unanswered due to his response the next morning. Like most mornings during the season, we visited coach before school. This time he was reading our faces from the moment we entered his office. He immediately said \"The Watertown field was burned last night. They would accuse us but the burn seems to resemble a K\". He then looked at each one of us while forming a smirk on his face said \"I sure hope you guys had nothing to do with that\". Almost in unison we said \"No coach!\". Tom then had to add \"If it was us, we would have burned a D on the field\". That statement pretty much proved our guilt, but the coach just turned away and said \"You better get to class.\"\n\n\nEdit: TL;DR burnt the letter K into football field of rivalry team. Got away with it because K was the letter of the next team they faced, and not the team that actually did it. (Thanks for the wording)\n\n",

        "text": "On Mobile, maybe formatted incorrectly, autocorrect sucks, etc. \n\nSo now, let's begins with the story. Once upon a time, I was a little 13-year old (M).  I was an angry crier but I could still use my brain when I was frustrated (which was often). My mom, however, was a hypocrite who would get angry at the slightest thing but would do those aggravations herself. \n\nOne day, I was reading this very sub on my phone while eating breakfast and my mom wandered in. Suddenly, she shouted, \"M, hurry up! We have to go!\" I put down my phone and started eating breakfast quicker while my mom continued yelling. Finally she left to go start the car. I finished and quickly headed down the stairs but not before seeing that she left her phone charging on the counter.\n\nOnce I got in the car,she started yelling at me again saying, \"You're so irresponsible\" and \"Your phone is like cocaine to you!\" I said, \"Says you, you're the one who forgot their phone.\" Mom continued on yelling oblivious to my reminder. As soon as mom reached the end of the driveway, she rudely commanded me to set the directions to my summer camp on her phone. I said, \"You forgot it Mom...\" Mom complained how he didn't remind her and requested him go get it but since I already reminded her, I refused. Now I mimicked her and said, \"Ugh, you're so irresponsible.\"\n\nTLDR: A kid gets yelled at for using his phone, reminds his mom to get her phone, mom doesn't listen but blames kid and kid laughs.
