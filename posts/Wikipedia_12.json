        "text": "I didn't know where to ask this and other people must have written about it before but for about a year or two now I've noticed that people use quit a personal voice in articles. I've been using wikipedia since 2006 and articles always seemed more like a \"data dump\" to me. I know everyone is biased and the information people chose to give or leave out is also biase but wikipedia has always seemed neutral to me. Or at least it tried to be. I've noticed that nowadays people give their own opinion on things in articles.\n\nThis is good. This is bad, this is beautiful, ugly etc.. To give an example, in the past to talk about the beauty of a car, the writer would have chosen to cite a magazine and written:\n\n\" Car X was voted most beautiful car of 2009 in Vehicule Magazine\"\n\nBut nowadays I find a lot of:\n\n\"Car X is a very beautiful car\". It feels weird to me when I research subject and suddenly the writer gives his own opinion especially, when the write uses phrases such as \"I think\".\n\nWas there some kind of rule change that allows this in recent years? Was the impersonal writing never a rule just an etiquette that people respected and that culture just changed? Are there just too many people using it today that enforcing any standards seems impossible?",

Which is messed up on multiple levels because it‚Äôs not even to do with him\n\n\nI just think it‚Äôs inappropriate to have violent crimes committed against people to be on their biography pages.

It simply states, \"The cover has been widely criticised and ridiculed, with most of the focus being placed upon Scantlin's strained, uncomfortable, and off-key vocals.\" That's a cordial way of putting it, to say the least.\n\nDo any members here have similar, hilarious examples?",
