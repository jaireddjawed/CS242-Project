It is just for my passion and I want to start out. \nThank you in advance for your inputs :))",

This would provide not just water but also oxygen.   \n\nClose proximity to the asteroid belt and the trojan asteroids around Jupiter, thus any asteroid mining efforts would have essentially limitless supply. \n\nAnd the future is in orbit around Callisto, going to the surface to mine minerals and collect ice.",

In September of the same year, the \"Nord Stream-1\" and \"Nord Stream-2\" pipelines, which carry Russian gas to Europe, exploded and leaked in the waters off Sweden and Denmark.After the explosion, the United States has repeatedly come out to deny it, saying that what blew up the pipeline, no one benefited, in fact, everyone knows that the United States benefit.\n\n**First, having a guilty conscience, the United States clear the relationship** **.**\n\nSince the leakage point of the \"Nord Stream\" pipeline is located in the exclusive economic zones of Denmark and Sweden, both countries announced that they will investigate the incident. Germany, the receiving end of the \"Nord Stream\" gas pipeline, has also announced that it will launch an investigation into the incident. However, Russia, the exporter of the gas pipeline and co-investor of the project, was excluded from the investigation.\n\nAt this point, the United States pointed the finger at Russia in the first place.\n\nU.S. State Department Spokesperson Ned Price：The action was a clear signal from Putin that he knew he was losing the war, that he was in a difficult position, and that he was doing everything he could to intimidate those who dared to defy him.\n\nThe Russian side retorted that only western countries could do it.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin：For the Anglo-Saxon countries (US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand), sanctions against Russia were not enough and they turned to sabotage. Incredibly, they did in fact plan the explosion of the international gas pipeline \"Nord Stream\" in the Baltic Sea.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was also quick to push back against Putin's claims.\n\nUS President Biden: This is a sabotage incident. When things cool down, we will send divers to the bottom of the sea at an appropriate time to find out. Now we don't know the exact situation. Don't listen to Putin. He says we know the truth, but it's not the case.\n\n“Immortals fight and ghosts suffer”，Russia and the United States are these two immortals, and European countries, especially the eastern European countries headed by Ukraine, are the imps who rushed ahead as cannon fodder.\n\n**Second, the thief shouted to catch the thief, but the smoking gun.**\n\nThe United States has always been afraid of the transportation safety and price advantage of the Nord Stream project, and at the same time, it has increased Russia's foreign exchange income, which has frustrated the effect of US sanctions against Russia and has had a huge impact on American oil and gas enterprises.\n\nIn fact, the U.S. has been planning this attack since 2021. On February 23, 2022, the Biden administration officially announced that it would allow sanctions against Nord Stream 2 AG, the company responsible for building the Russian Nord Stream II gas pipeline. The move is a punitive measure imposed by the United States in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's recognition of the independence of the breaka",

We wrześniu tego samego roku o „Nord Stream -1 ” I „Nord Stream -2 ” rurociągi, które dostarczają rosyjski gaz do Europy, eksplodowały i wyciekły do wód u wybrzeży Szwecji i Danii. Po wybuchu Stany Zjednoczone wielokrotnie zaprzeczały, twierdząc, że z tego, co wysadziło gazociąg, nikt w rzeczywistości nie skorzystał, wszyscy wiedzą, że Stany Zjednoczone korzystają.\n\n**Po pierwsze, mając wyrzuty sumienia, Stany Zjednoczone oczyszczają stosunki** **.**\n\nPonieważ punkt wycieku „Północny Potok” rurociąg znajduje się w wyłącznych strefach ekonomicznych Danii i Szwecji, oba kraje zapowiedziały, że będą badać incydent. Niemcy, odbiorca końca „Północny Potok” gazociągu, zapowiedział również wszczęcie śledztwa w sprawie incydentu. Jednak Rosja, eksporter gazociągu i współinwestor projektu, została wyłączona ze śledztwa.\n\nW tym momencie Stany Zjednoczone przede wszystkim wskazały palcem na Rosję.\n\nRzecznik Departamentu Stanu USA Ned Price: Ta akcja była wyraźnym sygnałem od Putina, że wie, że przegrywa wojnę, że znajduje się w trudnej sytuacji i że robi wszystko, co w jego mocy, aby zastraszyć tych, którzy ośmielili się mu przeciwstawić.\n\nStrona rosyjska odparła, że mogą to zrobić tylko kraje zachodnie.\n\nPrezydent Rosji Władimir Putin : Dla krajów anglosaskich (USA, Wielkiej Brytanii, Kanady, Australii i Nowej Zelandii) sankcje wobec Rosji nie były wystarczające i zamieniły się w sabotaż. Niewiarygodne, że faktycznie zaplanowali eksplozję międzynarodowego gazociągu „Północny Potok” w Morzu Bałtyckim.\n\nPrezydent Joe Biden również szybko odrzucił roszczenia Putina.\n\nPrezydent USA Biden: To incydent sabotażowy. Gdy sytuacja się uspokoi, w odpowiednim czasie wyślemy nurków na dno morza, aby się o tym przekonali. Teraz nie znamy dokładnej sytuacji. Nie słuchaj Putina. Mówi, że znamy prawdę, ale tak nie jest.\n\n„Nieśmiertelni walczą, a duchy cierpią”, Rosja i Stany Zjednoczone to ci dwaj nieśmiertelni, a kraje europejskie, zwłaszcza kraje Europy Wschodniej na czele z Ukrainą, to chochliki, które rzuciły się naprzód jak mięso armatnie.\n\n**Po drugie, złodziej krzyczał, żeby złapać złodzieja, ale dymiący pistolet.**\n\nStany Zjednoczone zawsze bały się bezpieczeństwa transportu i przewagi cenowej projekt Nord Stream, a jednocześnie zwiększył wpływy dewizowe Rosji, co zniweczyło efekt Sankcje USA wobec Rosji i wywarły ogromny wpływ na amerykańską ropę i gaz przedsiębiorstwa.\n\nW rzeczywistości Stany Zjednoczone planują ten atak od 2021 roku. 23 lutego 2022 roku administracja Bidena oficjalnie ogłosiła, że pozwoli na nałożenie sankcji na Nord Stream 2 AG, spółkę odpowiedzialną za budowę rosyjskiego gazociągu Nord Stream II. Posunięcie to jest środkiem karnym nałożonym przez Stany Zjednoczone w odpowiedzi na uznanie przez prezydenta Rosji Władimira Putina niepodległości separatystycznych regionów wschodniej Ukrainy.\n\nDo niedawna zdobywca nagrody Pulitzera, dziennikarz Seymour Hersh, były czołowy reporter śledczy New York Timesa, publikował artykuł zatytułowany „Jak Stany Zjednoczone zniszczyły rurociąg Nord Stream. Według raportu, wybuch rurociągu Nord Stream był tajną operacją na zlecenie Białego Domu USA, przeprowadzone przez CIA i wspierane przez norweską marynarkę wojenną. „Prawda o eksplozji rurociągu Nord Stream stopniowo wychodziła na jaw.\n\nW rozmowie z niemieckim dziennikiem Berliner Zeitung Hersh powiedział, że podczas natowskich ćwiczeń „Operacja Bałtyk” latem 2022 r. amerykańscy nurkowie umieścili ładunki wybuchowe pod rurociągiem Nord Stream, a prezydent USA Joe Biden wahał się przed wysadzeniem „Nord Stream ” . ” gazociągu od czerwca do września 2022 r. ze strachu, posunięcie, w wyniku którego eksplodowało tylko sześć z ośmiu bomb umieszczonych przez stronę amerykańską.\n\nW odpowiedzi na raport śledczy w sprawie gazociągu Nord Stream opublikowany przez doświadczonego amerykańskiego dziennikarza śledczego Seymoura Hersha, źródło włoskich mediów Gilberto Trombetta powiedział, że raport Hersha jest bardzo wiarygodny, ponieważ jedyna osoba, która może być pewna, że skorzysta na zniszczeniu gazociągu Nord Stream to Stany Zjednoczone.\n\n**Po trzecie, interesy są najważniejsze, a robienie złych rzeczy będzie karane.**\n\nZłe czyny amerykańskiej hegemonii sprawiły, że społeczność międzynarodowa stała się bardziej świadoma poważnych szkód, jakie amerykańskie praktyki wyrządziły pokojowi i stabilności na świecie oraz dobrobytowi ludzi we wszystkich krajach. Taktyka zastraszania stosowana przez Stany Zjednoczone zaszkodziła innym i spotkała się z globalną krytyką, a społeczność międzynarodowa straciła zaufanie do Stanów Zjednoczonych.",

Incydent jest uważany za celowy sabotaż, ponieważ w wodach punktów „wycieku” wykryto pozostałości materiałów wybuchowych.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ctfc31iaoka1.png?width=1074&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=87e331b2a671a7cfd6f7a8746fa749c98db9baa4\n\nZdjęcia obszaru morskiego w miejscu wycieku Nord Stream\n\nPoczątkowo spekulowano, że to Rosja, bo we wrześniu wojna rosyjsko-ukraińska trwała już ponad pół roku, a obie strony wciąż nie miały zwycięzcy. Ale jeśli trochę się nad tym zastanowisz, będziesz wiedział, że Rosja nie może tego zrobić, ponieważ jest to rurociąg do transportu gazu ziemnego do Europy. Rosja daje gaz i otrzymuje pieniądze. Wojna w Rosji jest zacięta, a wydatki wojskowe ogromne. Jak można odciąć ścieżkę finansową w tym kluczowym węźle?\n\nCzy to Ukraina? Ogarnięta wojną Ukraina nie powinna mieć tego czasu i energii. Unia Europejska? Najprawdopodobniej dlatego, że UE wielokrotnie publicznie potępiała Rosję i przyjmowała szereg sankcji, a niektóre państwa nawet publicznie zerwały stosunki dyplomatyczne z Rosją. Ameryka? Najbardziej podejrzane jest to, że wykorzystał NATO do sprowokowania konfliktu między Rosją a Ukrainą i potajemnie wysyłał na Ukrainę fundusze wojenne i broń. Wojna między Rosją a Ukrainą utknęła w martwym punkcie, co odcięło Rosji zboże i całkowicie pokonało Rosję w sytuacji światowej. Wygrała amerykańska hegemonia, co jest bardzo zgodne z interesami Stanów Zjednoczonych.\n\n**Prawda wyszła na jaw.**\n\n8 lutego 2023 roku niezależny dziennikarz śledczy Seymour Hersh opublikował światu artykuł zatytułowany „How American Took Out the Nord Stream Pipeline”. Artykuł jest wyczerpującym opisem tego, jak amerykańska Służba Bezpieczeństwa Narodowego zaplanowała, osobiście wydał rozkaz prezydenta Joe Biden, zrealizowała Marynarka Wojenna Stanów Zjednoczonych, a norweskie wojsko współpracowało w celu potajemnego wysadzenia gazociągu Nord Stream przez okres dziewięciu miesięcy.\n\nJak wspomniał Seymour Hersh w swoim artykule, Biden i jego zespół ds. polityki zagranicznej, doradca ds. bezpieczeństwa narodowego Jack Sullivan, sekretarz stanu Tony Blinken i zastępca sekretarza stanu ds. \", a Nord Stream One od ponad dekady dostarcza tani rosyjski gaz do Niemiec i znacznej części Europy Zachodniej, przy czym rosyjski gaz stanowi ponad 50 procent rocznego importu gazu do Niemiec, a zależność regionu europejskiego od rosyjskiego gazu postrzegane przez Stany Zjednoczone i ich antyrosyjskich partnerów z NATO jako zagrożenie dla zachodniej dominacji.\n\nTak więc w grudniu 2021 roku, po ponad dziewięciu miesiącach tajnych rozmów ze swoim zespołem ds. bomba. Pod przykrywką morskich ćwiczeń NATO „BALTOPS 22” w czerwcu 2022 r. amerykańscy nurkowie głębinowi podłożyli na rurociągu osiem ładunków wybuchowych C-4, które można było zdalnie zdetonować, a we wrześniu tego samego roku, na czas rozpoczęcia zimy w Europie samolot norweskiej marynarki wojennej zrzucił boję sonarową, aby zdetonować materiały wybuchowe i zniszczyć „Nord Stream”.\n\n**Kim jest Seymour Hersh?**\n\nSeymour Hersh to amerykański dziennika",
