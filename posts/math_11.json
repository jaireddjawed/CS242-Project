For the unknown function, I have only the DFT and that lets me plot it as a sum of cosines. But I don't know how to generate this function directly. The spectrum is much like the spectrum of the periodic sinc function. But where the periodic sinc function has equal amplitudes for the cosine components, the unknown function has amplitudes that are larger for the higher frequency components. Does anyone recognize this function or see how to generate it? [Here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jnsqyymdwb) is a similar plot of the periodic sinc function for reference.",

If I start from where I began integrating for coefficients and plug in n = 0 at the very start the coefficient comes out fine. So I figure I’ll pull out the zeroth term and write it on its own (it’s a constant after all) but I’m not sure how to write it. I could break it into two series but I feel like there’s a better way.

        "text": "I am in the last year of my PhD doing PDEs. I am hoping to stay in academia and land a decent postdoc (I made a recent post about this), but I have strong doubts about my ability as a mathematician. The first part of my PhD was strongly affected by COVID and honestly I didn't learn much. I also joined my program straight after my bachelors so it's not like I knew much before enrolling. I often meet masters students who know way more than I do (sometimes even undergraduates). For example, if you were to ask me to solve a random problem from Folland's measure theory book I'd probably be unable to solve it 99/100 times (and if I'm being generous, maybe only 1/2 of the problems in baby Rudin).\n\nI've read that most people gain their expertise as a result of the qualifying exam pressure, but again, because of COVID my year of students didn't have that (we pretty much all passed without any trouble). When reading a paper or a textbook I can often follow a proof but I struggle when proving things on my own. If I'm being honest this is probably due to not doing enough exercises, but I'm realizing this too late.\n\nI am committed to math now and I have no problem putting in the required effort, but I wonder if it's too late now. It seems all great mathematicians had their PhD done and were an expert by the time they were 26-28 (I'm almost 30). The hope of being a \"good\" mathematician is probably gone now. It's a lot harder teaching myself basic material when I have no one to verify my proofs and when I have other responsibilities.\n\nSorry if this is similar to my older thread but it's been starting to get me very depressed and I can only wish I worked harder in the beginning. I'm kind of desperate for advice now and don't know what to do. I'm in a weird position where I know math than a senior math major but none of it as deeply as someone far into a PhD.",

The cycle in the zodiac signs is something I don't exactly remember and don't care to look up, but I remember it being remarkably similar to that of the Avatar Cycle, with two consecutive elements changing place (say earth and fire).\n\nI found this curious and thought that it was a pretty close distance between the two series. Then I thought it was actually still pretty different because half of the members of the sequence changed place, albeit a \"small\" distance. This made me wonder if there is a way to \"measure a distance\" between two sequences, and if so, if there is a single maximally distant sequence, or if it is rather a whole set of them. I don't know a lot about this, but I did think that maybe [Levenshtein distances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance), which are used for strings, could give some insight, but these measure things that are rather different to sequences such as the ones discussed.",

        "text": "I wanted to bring up a discussion topic on the education side of things. I am a 3rd year PhD student in computational math, and I've filled a role as a graduate instructor for Calc 1 several times now. The math department at my university has a poor reputation with the undergraduates. The common student-to-student recommendation is to \"skip\" the classes by taking them at a community college.\n\nI have generally been wary of this kind of student criticism, because I have tended to believe that they are probably being lazy. That said, I have now seen a long train of hard-working students experience brutal failure in calculus, and I have started to wonder if our version of the course really is \"too hard.\"\n\nThe issue I see is that our assessment strategy is focused on assessing rigorous reasoning skills over \"procedural fluency\". The consequence of this is that our homework and test questions are very challenging to even *start*, and they tend to \"bury\" the calculus basics behind complicating factors and word problem mumbo-jumbo.\n\nI genuinely want my students to have and demonstrate rigorous understanding of the material, but I also think there's value in assessing basic/procedural knowledge in a straightforward way. I don't think that procedural fluency is a \"bad\" or \"weak\" foundation for students who are going into engineering, for example. This isn't the last shot they have at learning rigorous mathematics, after all!\n\nWhat are your thoughts? How have you calibrated the difficulty level of courses that you teach, such as calculus?",

Can we find a Sudoku that doesn't have any reflections in its columns and rows?\n\nFor example : the rows:[1324, 3412, 2143, 4231] would be such a solution for n =4.

Its been all simple until today that I found a distribution that I could not explain by those. Assume after some equations I come up with a variable (\"x\") that throws these numbers in its different outcomes:\n\nx1: -1000\n\nx2: -500\n\nx3: -100\n\nx4: -50\n\nx5: 0\n\nx6: 100\n\nx7: 400\n\nThis variable in those 7 instances would be better for the model if they were represented by the numbers:\n\nx1: -1000\n\nx2: -500\n\nx3: -100\n\nx4: -50\n\nx5: 0\n\nx6: -10\n\nx7: -40\n\nAll the same except the positive ones, which would have been better represented by slightly negative ones, which become a tiny bit more negative as their initial values become more positive. So given that the positives should be even lower than the neutral, it doesnt seem to me like a logarithmic regression, but smth parabolic. \n\nCould you help me figure out what sort of equations would best fit these numbers and also pointing out some simple study material for this?",

I.e. he could take a course in dynamic systems (nonlinear ODEs), geometry of curves and surfaces, intro to PDE, etc. This seems to be possible because his core courses were pretty rigorous, included a bit of point set topology and group theory. But he could also take all of those same courses later, in a form that requires Analysis first...\n\nWe both basically had to just progress as fast as we could because we had our actual majors to attend to, and we picked up what we needed to know from these more applied courses on the hoof. It was only after I finished graduate school that I considered self-studying something like differential geometry for pleasure, and at that point I had the required Analysis to read graduate level textbooks. I've always felt I missed out on building intuition in thin slices learning math this way, but I also don't want to project my pathologies onto my cousin.\n\nWhat do actual mathematicians think? Maybe tell him to hustle on, but read some classic self-contained texts in the areas that interest him? What might some 'read for culture and intuition building' sugesstions be?",

I presume it would look like something else entirely if you used, say, a mathematical system with \"9\" digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) or any other number of numerically representative digits instead of \"10\" digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), and/or if you plotted the results on an alternate form of coordinate plane with non-perpendicular axes. In other words, I believe it looks like that and contains those mathematical characteristics as a direct result of the mathematical and visual systems selected to represent it.\n\nDoes anyone know of (or have the ability to create) a simulation of a non-decimal version of the Mandelbrot set?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/11dpq9f/yet_another_lowerbound_estimate_for_tree3/",
        "text": "I effin' love this function, not gonna lie\n\nThis is the function that just keeps on giving. Anytime one lower bound seems well-established, another one arises that blows the previous one out of the water. This is exactly what's happened with the latest estimate. CarBricksCity did a video on it, and I think it's also on the Googology page.\n\nWe start with the weak tree function, not to be confused with the stronger TREE, where nodes don't have separate \"colors\" but you get a certain head-start in terms of how many you're allowed to use, which determines the function's argument. If you're allowed to use n+1 nodes for the nth tree, then you have tree(1), n+2 means tree(2), and so on.\n\nThe first two values are very small, as in the strong TREE, but this quickly expands to gargantuan proportions. tree(1)=2 and tree(2)=5, but tree(3) is at least ~1.6 quadrillion. Gigantic sure, but still within the range of physically applicable numbers. It's at tree(4) where the fun really starts.\n\ntree (4)&gt;f epsilon_0 (Graham's number)\n\nKeep in mind Graham's number is roughly (omega+1)(64) on the FGH. This is only tree(4) and to calculate it we're talking about using the epsilon sequence omega to the power of omega to the power of omega, etc., *diagonalized to include Graham's number Omegas*. Needless to say, it hits Graham's Number out of the park. And the fun's just getting started.\n\n tree(5)&gt;f gamma_0 (Graham's number), where gamma is an ordinal far more powerful than even epsilon.\n\ntree(Graham's number) is roughly f SVO (Graham's number), where SVO is the Small Veblen Ordinal.\n\nHow does this all relate to the TREE function? The lower bound for TREE(3) was calculated as tree_3(tree_2(tree(8)). The subscripts function like a sort of hyperoperation on the iteration of the function itself. tree_2(tree(8))=tree^tree(8) tree(8). So tree_3=tree^tree^tree^tree....^tree(8) tree(8), with tree^tree(8) tree(8) *layers* in the iteration tower. So in the first layer, tree^tree(8) tree(8), you'd have to iterate weak tree tree(tree(8))+1 times. Then based on the answer to that, you'd iterate it that number of times in the second layer, and so on for tree^tree(8) tree(8) layers.\n\nIn other words, since the layers are represented as superscripts like exponents are in equations, it might be helpful to view it as a tetration of iterations, although it might not strictly be the same.\n\nTREE(3)= tree⬆️⬆️tree(8) tree(8).\n\nAnd of course, that's just TREE(3). You wonder what TREE(4) would be, let alone TREE(TREE(3)). And stronger functions like SCG massively outstrip both those numbers, but that's a different story. Words like gargantuan and enormous tend to get overused when talking about these numbers, but it turns out that TREE(3) is so big that even functions that are themselves already huge must be iterated and tetrated a gargantuan number of times themselves just to come \"close,\" which probably isn't all that close at all, as the number itself is almost certainly much larger, and there's still no known upper bound. And if that's not gargantuan, you'd be hard-pressed to say what is.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/11dossm/base_10_with_digits_other_than_09/",
        "text": "0 is often presented as making positional counting possible, but we can write 10 with it, like the Romans did, with X. And indeed by introducing this digit, we can use it to write any natural number 0 is used for - twenty is written 1X; one times ten plus ten times one. \"Taking one\" like that can carry us all the way to the bank. For 100, we get 9X. And then we go on to X1, X2, and so on. 111 is first three-digit number. Powers of 10 look like a bunch of 9s followed by an X. Thus 1000=99X, and 10000=999X.\n\nBut we can't do everything. The number zero can't be written. If you allow numbers between one and zero to be written without the leading 0, you can have most of them, but anything below .1 is a bust. But we can go deeper.\n\nLet A be -1, and let 9 go. We can write the number nine as 1A now. Let's count a little, just to get our bearings. 5, 6, 7, 8, 1A, X, 11, 12,...17, 18, 2A, 1X, 21, 22,...87, 88, 1AA, 8X, 1A1, 1A2,... 1A7, 1A8, XA, 1AX, X1,... we got our eyes on the pattern? Good. Now check this shit out: AX. -1 times 10 plus 10 times 1; that's zero, folk. We actually have infinitely many zeros, by putting 9s between the A and the X. A9X, A99X, A999999999X, those are all zero. Let's write an 11th: .090909... .1A is .09. Hmm... .1A1A... is .0909.... A 100th is .AX1.\n\nThe digits A, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and X can write any rational number the same way 0-9 can. I haven't written up a full proof but that's, what's the phrase? Been deemed trivial and left as an excersize to the reader? Anyway, let V equal 15. 1, 2, 3, 4, AV, 6, 7, 8, 1A, X\n\nBut why are sticking with integer digits? Let's reset to 0-9, but then enter the digit e, and to force us to use it, let's obliterate the digit 3. We would now the number three as e.2817.... But 3.1 represents a problem. It's bigger than e.e9 but smaller than e.4. Returning to our system with A and X doesn't seem to do it, because with two digits that can't be increased by 1, we lose a lot of ability to move around. If we add pi in though, that works. 3.1=e.π675...\n\nThere's a couple thick areas of redundant notation here. e.1=2.81828..., e.5=π.0766... in fact the entire range from e to 3 can be written with a leading 2 or a leading e, and from pi to e+1 can be written with a leading e or a leading pi. And these ranges wrap around mod ten, so that 1e-13 suffer this again.\n\nAnd I mean, we haven't even imagined imaginery numbers, complex numbers, quaternions, p-adic digits!!! What would a digit that's ...111 in 3-adic even mean? I don't know, because I've never actually worked with p-adic numbers before. And then you can even mix non-natural digits with non-natural bases! Imagine base 2e^iπ/8 with 1+i as a digit. Sends you directly to Hell probably.\n\nIn conclusion, numerical notation is a land of contrast, or as the natives call it, maize",

Now, if you are a science student then I can understand why you would want to study it, however if you are studying mathematics it is not only useless but also misleading. \n\nA mathematics student, who takes the subject seriously, will have to, at some point, take multivaribale analysis establishing the foundations for all this calculus; and upon taking it they will understand the subject much better, much more deeply. I am usually confronted with the argument that multivaribale calculus establishes good intuition for what's to come. And while I think that in in the case of two dimensions, apriori knowledge of 2d calculus(before analysis) can be helpful, it is really misleading when you are working with multiple variables. The further down you go the more understanding you sacrifice due to lack of rigour, until you dont understand anything at all. This intuition based approach to proof is very much, in my opinion, harmful. So why waste you time in the first place? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts?",
