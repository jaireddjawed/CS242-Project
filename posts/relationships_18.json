        "text": "[24F][24M] We had our first date in October and we both felt an immediate click so in November I'd asked if I could call him my boyfriend. He's really sweet, smart, funny, and we share a lot of interests like the gym and gaming. We both struggle with depression and anxiety so thankfully whenever we needed space or slight support but in the last 2 weeks I started noticing he was different. He started being really distant in text, not as physically affectionate, no interest in intimacy, and honestly I didn't realize how much that was affecting me until this past week.\n\nWe were together for a little under 5 months but ended up breaking up yesterday because I'd called him regarding my friend sending me a photo of him at the beach with another girl and my friend had asked if that was her boyfriend, she said yes and they'd been together for a few weeks. Now I don't know if I'm in denial but when I asked he sounded so hurt because we've both been cheated on and we had agreed that if we no longer wanted to continue the relationship either of us would say something. He denied that they're together and that they were at the beach as a group. I actually didn't know he was going to the beach but he never really mentioned his day plans unless I'd asked, I know he went to dinner with his family that night though. \n\nAnother time (late February) yet another friend sent me a photo of a bumble profile of him and I'd called him asking about it and he assured me that he's not on those apps anymore and while on the phone he redownloaded all the apps he was on and deleted the profiles for good.\n\nIn January we were cuddling on my bed watching something and he asked what time it is and I tapped his phone but a tinder notification was there, I recoiled back into his arms and just handed his phone to him when he asked me what was wrong then I pointed at the notification. He apologized profusely and assured me that we're dating and he doesn't want to hurt me.\n\nOn that call yesterday he told me that he wasn't feeling any romance anymore, not because of me but his mental health made him realize he's not ready to commit. He told me he knew that he wasn't being emotionally available and his distance was hurting me. We were supposed to go on a trip together tomorrow for a few days and he wanted to see if it would reinvigorate his feelings which is why he pushed through the last month. I just wish he told me so idk I'd at least try to help create a spark.\n\nI'm just so confused because he told me \"I love you\" first and this complete 180 in emotions, and his actions really hurt. I genuinely don't think that he would've cheated on me. Maybe I'm just naive?\n\nWas I looking too deep into things? I didn't immediately jump to him cheating on me whenever my friends sent me that, they just started dumping their own ideas onto me and it started making me second guess. Am I a clown for wanting him back? \n\nWe had both agreed to work on our own mental health while apart from each other. I have a therapist contacting me for making an appointment soon and I have another appointment for antidepressants next week.\n\nsorry if everything's all jumbled my brain is basically sauce rn\n\ntl;dr boyfriend had been distant for the last month and we ended up breaking up yesterday. 2 different friends sent me i guess suspicious things but i never immediately concluded that he was cheating on me but they were hard pushing that idea onto me. he didn't feel any romantic feelings anymore but im just confused because of how fast things turned around. am i naive? am i silly for wanting him back?",

I don’t want to be a controlling friend and I understand everyone is different when it comes to relationships. Should I not give advice again?

But these people give me unsolicited advice and intrusive thoughts which makes me confused,, but ultimately I need to trust him regardless because if he says it’s in the past then it’s in the past until it gets fishy right?\n\nI couldn’t help but wonder if some couples had the same situation as me?

To be fair, it was a bit out of left field as I was drinking and he was out at a concert, and it was midnight. I apologized about bringing it up at a completely inappropriate time the next morning and asked if we could have a conversation about it. \n\nHe explained to me that saying I love you doesn’t come easy to him, and he has only said in once in his relationship history (for context he’s been in four five-ish year relationships). This to me was extremely shocking and unsettling. I explained to him that I have a hard time being in a relationship with somebody who may never love me. He said that he’s just not ready yet and it takes him time, which I accepted, but further explained that I can’t feel confident in his ability to love me if he’s been in five year relationships and never expressed that he loves the person. He said circumstances were different in those relationships and he values and appreciates our relationship, he’s just “not there yet.” \n\nI’m not sure how to go about this. Him and I have a very good relationship, he supports me and shows acts of love constantly. It sounds like he has some deep rooted issues surrounding love and has a possibly convoluted idea of it. I don’t know if this is a red flag, as this is truly the only problem that’s been presented in our relationship. \n\nIs this something I should be concerned about? If my partner is supportive, caring, and makes time for me, should something like saying “I love you” be detrimental?\n\nTL;DR : my boyfriend of six months hasn’t said I love you to 3/4 of his five year relationships",

        "text": "Heyho everyone! This is my first long Post in any reddit so i'm gonna give my best! I hope I can sort my words and thoughts a bit here... while hoping for some comfort or advice.\n\nMy Girlfriend just broke up with me a couple days ago. (Long distance relationship)  \nShe is 26, i'm 26, we've met over Discord back in 2017... alot of random events led to one another and she happened to create a crush for me (I was in a Discordserver where not alot of mature men were active... so I kinda stood out of the crowd and attracted the attention of alot of female members... I wanted to date one of them, but it didn't work out, she tried to help me make it work and in the process fell in love with me (she told me that back then)).  \nAt first I wasn't really interested in her, kinda still stuck with the other girl in my thoughts and I also at first sight did not find her very attractive... however, since our interests aligned well I suggested her to meet eachother in the middle (i'm from near Frankfurt, Germany and she is from Paris, France) we met in Metz for an extended weekend and spend a few nights in the same Hotelbed together.   \nWe had an amazing time and she even admitted when i came back that she wanted to kiss me but was too shy to do so. I kinda fell in love with her during this time, so we both were in a happy relationship.  \nWe met regularly, usually every 2 months, I was still in apprenticeship (started like 2 months after i met her first time). She was unemployed (still is), we had alot of nice first months. October we met in Metz, January she was at my place, March she was at my place, May i was in France for the first time. and after she stayed at my place the following summer for 1 entire month we decided that it's time for us to try to move together, she moved to my place since I was only living with my mom and we had plenty of space (her family lived in a much smaller apartment with 5 people... barely 50m² sharing bedrooms amongst eachother comapred to our 74m²). As she also had alot of problems with her mother and her stepfather who were... working most of the time and came home very late just to switch to bed after 30min of dinner (they swapped to bed at 21....) her Stepbrother at the age of 8 back then being heavily underdeveloped... still acting like 5 sometimes...   \nDuring this time (2019) when she lived at my place, me and my mother provided everything for her from Money and food to German courses and general support. I told her when she needs my help with German she has to ask me (this was something that I told her continously). However... as the months went by... we also realized how difficult it is to live together with the same person in the same room... 24x7... I had alot of issues with my apprenticeship back then aswell... it was very stressful and I worked alot of extra hours while still having to focus on school-grades (germany's system includes school and work). And it weight down on me heavily during this time... I could not focus on my school, work and her stuff at the same time... we also made the mistake to continue speaking english rather than switching to german (she did not manage after a few attempts because she is a very shy person) so I kinda wanted to wait until her German improved. (She already had 4 years of german class before tho). After roughly 5 months we started arguing alot... her habits were really hard to accept (getting up and going to the PC to play a MMORPG that she was (in my opinion) addicted to playing it (sometimes until 2am just to \"do an event in the game\") without clothes in the morning instead of helping to prepare breakfast, go shower, go out with dog or at least put clothes first... my mom continously became tired of her lack of ability to manage a routine or take things into her own hand... she also had been unemployed for 2 years at this point after ditching school... She had appointments with possible short-time work places to manage to step into work life a bit and earn some money for herself aswell.   \nLong story short... she ended up missing her family and her little brother alot and the things that piled up with her being kinda overchallenged with setting up her life including our arguments that sometimes went really loudly... she is not the one to hold back, neither am I if I don't feel like i'm being taken serious. (and she often did that purposely to provoke someone with the \"boohoo\" type of baits)  \nMe, who had already cried my soul out and prepared for the worst was surprised by her. On the morning that she had to leave, she kneeled in the bed after I came from shower and cried to me, that she wants to keep the relationship alive since she still feels like it's important to her.  \nThe following year... 2020... corona hit and we didn't manage to see eachother for at least 8 months until the lockdowns were lifted... this... was heavy on our relationship, (I also lost my job shortly before my birthday during this time... which was heavy on me) but since our hobbys included mostly playing games, watching anime, watching serious, trolling around on webcam, we managed kinda well through this phase (we had still alot of arguments because she didn't really manage to be there for me when i was at my lowest after losing my job) and we both met eachother in summer, our relationship grew stronger than ever... however, as things at her place piled up even more, financial issues (they had to move to a larger appartment due to space issues with the brother turning older where I also provided ALOT of help to move which was during this summer). We kept seeing eachother regularly the following months  \nI finally found a new job after they moved and things seemed to improve, for 6 months everything was fine again... but in March, shortly before my birthday (again) I was kicked out of the job for the second round of the Lockdown... she was at my place during this time... but again.. failed to provide as an emotional support... she tried... but she didn't really fully manage everything. She also had her own problems with still being unemployed, at home things being very difficult (pressure from her mom to find a job to \"earn money idc what you do, just work!\") while she never had support from her mom it was difficult to deal with this for her.  \nMonths went by and during this time the lockdown didn't allow her to go back to france due to travel restrictions... we were stuck to eachother, she was continously stressed that she \"has to go back and take care of things\", she did not manage to be happy or smile alot during the last few months of being at my place (april, may, june 2021). She often picked fights with her attitude (the quiet being annoyed attitude, without telling anyone what's wrong) while making things for me and my mom aswell as my other family-members difficult. She went back in early July and after kinda managing one more month with me, she Broke up in early August... I contacted her again after 1 month of \"No-contact\" and we kinda managed to go back to our cute and wholesome conversations (she is still addicted to plushies and we trolled around on cam with them a bit), I found it cute (never really immature) and it made me happy aswell since she was always smiling when doing so... (She continously keeps a bear with her that i gifted her on our second time meeting... still... to date... it's her #1 plushie). 6 Months went by.. (October to march) in which I had ALOT of failed dating experience with mentally unstable girls (bi-polar, depression, anxiety, immature, girls that don't know what they want etc.) After experiencing all this... I decided to use an opportunity (a festival that was announced for our favourite groups) to invite her over... i paid everything and it worked out great... the first night already... before the festival even started... we went back together... never been so happy before... neither her nor me... the first 2 months worked better than ever and everything seemed perfect but 3 more months later it was clear she still was stuck to the failures of the previous time we tried.. she never managed to fully commit to the second attempt... every small disagreement (even if considered normal by everyone else) she connected it to the past and always judged me for it. While i never brought up her past...   \nI know I have my problems (Sometimes very occupied on my mind, bad in reading the \"Mood\" that she has, since she never tells me what's wrong..., and I also get angry and frustrated when things don't work out ( i don't get violent, I just curse out to release steam (not screaming tho) ) and i often just say what I think when things bother me too much. (i am direct on pointing out things that go wrong).  \nWhile I did not really value these moments highly she kept telling me it's \"too often\" (they really did not happen often... we never really argued harshly during this time, it was mostly just small discussions after she saw me act a certain way). I managed to get her a job during these months at my place, so she could earn money, even without german skills... and I did alot to get her this job...  \nShe also had the option to work here permanentely, WITHOUT a job-degree... which i managed to make possible... she refused... (I accepted, that she did not want to work in Germany fulltime)\n\nThis February... I went to her place again... after having worked for 8 months without break, almost 80 extra hours collected during December, January, February (with alot... and i mean ALOT of stress with customers...) I even already resigned the job, just to be dragged into it again by a hefty payrise...  \nMy situation at home isn't much better... my mom is in full-time home care with me being the caretaker #1 on paper, since the State continously denies our requests for more help. (I worked sometimes 10+hours just to come home to sometimes 2+ more hours of household and emotional stress seeing my mom struggling with health)  \nWhen I arrived at her place... nothing.. and i mean nothing was taken care of... her room looked like a bomb exploded... she had a huge mess in there (clothes, stuff, everything flying around in a mess)... it was dirty.. dusty... and there was plenty of mold-smell from water-damage behind the wall...  \nShe did not prepare the bed for us to sleep on and after 6hours+ of travel after 3hours of sleep since i still had to take care of alot before being able to leave my mom alone for 10 days... I was asked to sleep on her 80cm wide bed.... with her together...   \nFor the first night, since we arrived kinda late at her place, I accepted it.. and just went with it... it was a terrible sleep... and on the next day i decided to just stay home with her and relax to \"calm down\" however, in the evening, she again did not want to prepare the bed because she was tired. (excuse for being lazy at this point). Although I asked her where the bed is so i can take care of it she just answered \"it's in the garage, you can't access it this easily... just don't\"... I kinda became angry... since she knew how bad i had slept the past days... and I asked her if she had even taken care of a single thing before I arrived at her place in a kind of \"disappointed voice\", she immediately became angry and said something like \"YOU DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT I HAD PREPARED BEFORE YOU CAME HERE YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE\", after she went loud in voice I also changed into a serious tone and basically replied \"\\[Her Name\\] your room has worsened so much since I left last time and you did not even have the courtesy of preparing a bed or at least space to put a bed knowing 1 month in advance that i will arrive??? You have alot of freetime, not having anyone at home and being currently not employed... I really am disappointed... you could have also just asked me to take care of it or communicate that you might be tired or you can't carry the mattress, anything \\[her name\\] just tell it to me...\"  \n(She was often stressed by \"taking care\" of stuff and in the end just avoided it... so knowing this I just got angry at this point, after she went offensive)  \n(And I also am continously lost without help in my Job and continously have to \"initiate\" things to be taken care of... at home.... at work... so it was just too much seeing that she doesn't support me either)  \n\n\nThis day... being the second day of a 10 day holiday kinda set the scene for the following days. We did not argue anymore and I managed to calm down alot on the 3rd day... already having forgotten about Sunday and I apologized to her for stepping out of character, then i tried to explain it to her and she just listened.... but how things have went.... it did not change her mood. She refused sex (accepted it twice, but didn't really went fully into it...), she refused cuddling or doing something together, she just let me sit alone behind her on the bed being on my phone because I did not have anything else with me to keep \"busy\" since i expected us to do something together, instead she chose to watch videos on her own (in french with headphones) and play her game (that she is addicted to for years...). She did not smile, she kinda just accepted my presence. (I felt pushed away and no matter how many times i approached her, she just cold-heartedly gave me the cold shoulder... not wanting to hug, cuddle, kiss or anything...)  \nWe went out after I asked her to, I paid for alot of restaurants, shopping, traveling around the city... and it seemed nice, we held hands, even laughed and enjoyed a few days. However... she kept dragging this sunday with her... the last night before I left she cuddled me alot and we fell asleep in eachothers arms... she even teared up. (She also told me the following days that she was sad because she was very happy to be like this but also sad because we only managed it on the last and on the first day).  \nIn the morning before I left... she told me she wants a breakup... since we lacked time before my train left.. we did not manage to speak out to eachother alot... I asked her to take a break instead, for both of us to clear our minds and go back to a talk where we both assess what went wrong in this holiday. She did not want to... however... on the trainstation... she gave me... until this day the longest, most serious kiss ever... and we also hugged very long...   \nWhen I came back home I was still happy... but she kept distancing herself... she still sent cuddle emojis and hearts and good nights and good mornings, but she refused playing together, watching something together... so... 3 days ago I asked her if we could talk about what's wrong since she still acts like we're in a relationship but still pushes me away... by then she just said \"she feels like we should go separate ways\". Me, who had cleared his mind at this point tried to use this time to explain why things went bad... She did not want to be like \"I Understand why you acted the way you did\" she just said her point of view pointing out purely bad things and exaggerating them (she even mentioned things like, she always has to get up before me and i never get up first... like... she knows since years that I just use the time to cuddle her in the morning and im also by nature a long-sleeper)  \nWhen I wanted to tell her why I acted the way I did, why I went angry at her on this second day, she just didn't want to hear it. She continued saying \"even if I understand you it won't matter, you acted the way you did and this is too much for me in my life right now, I don't need a relationship like this right now\".  \nI also asked why she didn't tell me earlier that she isn't happy with the situation.  \nShe just said \"I didn't want to stress you out more and just tried to pretend to be happy like everything is fine\" (1. She is terrible at doing this 2. I told her like... hundreds of times she should not do this as it just confuses me and leads to us arguing in the end anyways...)  \nI tried to go further trying to ask what the exact things are that make her think this way. And she just bluntly said \"the same reasons as always, you are selfish, you don't listen to me, you don't understand me when Im upset, you get angry so often\".  \nInstead of pointing out where it happened in which context.. she just threw adjectives and small sentences at me...   \nI can connect some of those things, but some of them are very hard for me to understand...  \n\\- I am selfish -&gt; Yes I tend to be focused on my own desires from time to time. With the little amount of \"self\" time that I have... this sometimes looks very selfish. (I sometimes sigh or react stressed and annoyed after my mom asks me the 4th time in 40mins to do something for her after a long day of work) -&gt; she connects this to being selfish since I basically \"want my freetime after 8pm and worry about my own needs\". And I often tell her what my \"needs\" are for the relationship (which she considers selfish since I don't ask for hers), she never does until it's already too late or until she gets very angry (she told me most of these things only after breakup and gaslights me into thinking she did it already so often before. Or after she gets noticeably upset and I ask 30 times for her to tell me what's wrong, which she only does after complaining that i \"insist to much\" and after she gets even more angry)  \n\\- I am not listening to her -&gt; She connects this to me not sitting still and staring into the camera while she wants to tell me something about her day or something that happened in the family and she needs to \"vent\". (I listen to her, I just happen to not look staticly into the camera. Or sometimes I tell her that i'm currently playing a game when she starts this... i tell her \"im playing right now, but you know it's a semi-afk game so I will listen to you anyways\".)  \nAlso, she judges me not remembering something that she told me like 3 months ago. (With how many things I have to worry about daily, I have difficulties remembering details so mostly I just remember \"yes i know you told me something about \\*xyz\\*\" and ask her to please repeat it for me. (When she does it pops into my memory, but she often chooses to be like \"no you should know\") -&gt; These things are sometimes very minor events... like where she had a small disagreement with her mom for example... but when I don't remember them she gets angry...   \n\\- I don't understand her -&gt; It's hard to understand someone who keeps thinking \"Pretending happy for his sake\" is better than communicating what she is upset about, what annoys her, bothers her or what she would like to change....   \nYes, I should understand things and I do, but when I do and I approach her, she instead either keeps quiet, goes like \"you should know\" or keeps \"pretending happy\"....  \n\\- I get angry so often -&gt; with how my life is right now... i told her multiple times... i can't cry ... i am not the person to cry... i express sadness, depressed feelings, stress and most negative feelings through anger. (This anger is never directed towards her and it's literally just cursing like \"FUCK THIS\" when something goes horribly wrong). Yes I understand that perception can be different... however she never asks why I am angry instead she is instantly the \"victim\" in her head.\n\n  \nTLDR: My LDR (Paris, Fulda (near Frankfurt)) girlfriend broke up twice with me. I chose to go back to her since the interests aligned much better than with most girls that i met and i also had very bad dating experience after the first breakup. (Mental disorders etc. that were even worse for me)  \nShe has alot of family problems... personal problems and lack of ability to \"take care of things\". I also had my fair share of problems, which improved in the second round, but she kept dragging \"old\" things into the new attempt and as a result came into a spin of negative energy, ignoring everything positive and focusing purely on negatives. She didn't manage to communicate her needs and \"pretended happy for her boyfriends sake\" instead of talking about what bothers her, as a result broke up because \"It became too much\".  \nShe gaslighted me and only focused on negative things, talking about me like i ruined her life. Me being the reason why she is in \"the shit\" and unemployed.  \nShe, unemployed for 6 years nearly. 26y old. Complicated family situation (financially, socially)  \nMe, 26y old had a lot of ups and downs through corona, lost multiple jobs, has to take care of a sick (near to death) mother at home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight now... i'm just lost... I have to admit, writing this text helped HUGELY right now... i'm breathing...  \nI also called in sick for the entire week to not drag this into my job (The customer i'm responsible for is like 90% of our companies income, so i can't afford failures...) (Yes this is a huge pressure aswell...).\n\nYes this was also some form of vent, however, I do hope that I can get some people inside here to give me some advice... I understand it's alot of text, I'd appreciate some people reading it and maybe trying to help specifically rather than giving things like \"it will be fine\". The TLDR is really really little information... it's nearly impossible fitting it all in there...   \nAgain. IF you choose the read the long text. THANK YOU ALOT.   \nAny cheering or small comments based on the TLDR are still welcome ofc. Anything that gives me some form of direction.  \n(Also hope that writing this here prevents me from going deeper into this and possibly avoiding depression)\n\nYes I understand that professional help is only possible through therapy, however I'm trying to go out of this without therapy...  \nAnd no... I do not really have close friends that I can talk to about it.... at least none that wouldn't just go \"yea better this way, she was difficult\" and just leave it like that....  \nI also know, that this is \"my view\" and even though it changed based on the information she gave me, she can still think very differently. I'm not her to be like \"SEE SHE IS WRONG\".  \n\n\nSorry for the long text...",

        "text": "See..my boyfriend cares a lot about what peeps think of him. Or he loves when he feels important. We work in the same office. And there is a girl in his department who constantly say loudly how handsome my boyfriend is. Sometimes, when my boyfriend is going to get coffee in the cafetaria of our office, she would be talking loudly to another colleague about how handsome he is or how she wants him just for him to listen. The colleague she is talking to will often call out to my boyfriend in the cafeteria saying \"did you here what she said?\" My boyfriend will always feign ignorance but later he would narrate to me what that girl said. By seeing his expression, I could tell he is loving the attention since he loves to feel important but would never give in to her attentions. \nNow fast forward to today..he posted a story of his vacay in Italy and that girl commented \"enjoy your vacay!\"\n\nHe told me about it and this got me irritated because i didnt even know he was friend with her on FB. See he hides his friend list. He always tell me how he hates her because she already got a boyfriend but would still flirt with him. For someone you hate, you shouldnt be friend with her.\n\nJust to see his reaction, I asked him to remove her from his friendlist. See, i would never ask my partner to remove someone from his friend list, I just wanted to see his reaction.\n\nHis reaction was: I can remove her from my friendlist but it would be awkward since we are in the same team..people will talk about it.\n\nThis turned me off..since his account is very private and rarely he post something. She will never notice.\n\nIf it would have been for me..if he asked me to remove someone with whom he got a bad feeling, I would have removed him without any question asked since he is important. I feel stupid now..\n\nAm I overreacting?\n\nPlease reddit peeps give me some advice\n\n\nTD;LR: My boyfriend is not interested in his colleague but I do feel he loves the attention",

        "text": "I broke up with my first love a couple days ago. Our relationship lasted 1 year. It hurts so bad, but last night, I felt I had to do it.\n\n**The Reason:** My girlfriend has done a lot of things to hurt me in our relationship.\n\nShe has gaslighted me. She has made comments about my body. She has disrespected me in front of my friends and others. She has been incapable of resolving conflict without getting angry or frustrated quickly. One of her past exes who has been trying to get back with her even reached out to her a while back and asked her out and she said \"I have plans this weekend' and didn't even bother to mention me. And it felt like every couple weeks by the end of our relationship, something was making me upset. And a lot of these things were issues because she never knew how to love properly in the first place. Her last relationship was physically and mentally abusive. She has quite a bit of family trauma. She was aware of all the toxic tendencies she projected onto me and said she would try to change, but I would need to be patient. And I finally told her on call that I couldn't wait any longer and I called it quits. She didn't tear up or cry - but was just in pure shock. And we hung up.\n\n**The Regret:** But, on the other hand, I am now remembering all the things she has done to love me. The thing is - I know for a fact that she genuinely did love me.\n\nShe would push so hard for me to stay another night with her on weekends. If I was hungry, she would cook me food even if she didn't feel like it. When she saw me, she would genuinely say \"you're so beautiful\" in awe, and I know no one would ever say that and mean it like she did. She would grip my arm tightly when we were out. She said I was the first man she was proud to be with. Whenever I accidentally made a mess in her apartment, she forgave me so quickly. Or even when I slipped up and hurt her, she would be quick to forgive. She would show and introduce me to everyone she knew. And she was making change, but very gradually. She even tried to get therapy, but didn't have luck finding a therapist. I knew she was capable of changing entirely, but it would take so much time. I remember all these little things and I feel like I won't find someone who will love me as much as she does.\n\n**Now:** After a couple of days of no contact, she reached out to me and asked if we could meet in person and talk, saying that she didn't feel like she got closure and say what she wanted to say. I responded and said that I explained my rationale behind breaking up and gave her the opportunity to respond, but she didn't say anything in the moment. **She didn't respond anything afterwards and it's been 2 days. Should I reach out to her? Wait it out and see if she responds? Just move on? We really did have so many good memories, and most of the time, things were happy - but the lows are just so low. Any advice?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Gf and I have had a lot of toxic fights and issues during our relationship. I decided to break it off finally on call and she was in shock and said nothing. She reaches out a couple days later asking if we could meet so she can get closure and get the chance to say what she wanted to say. I told her I gave her the opportunity to speak and she didn't. No response from her. Should I give her the opportunity? Should I wait for her to text again?",

He does not stink; it's a pleasant smell, but it smells both familiar as well as highly unusual compared to how most men smell.  I thought it must just be a very unusual choice of aftershave/cologne.\n\nThen a few days ago I was at my cousin's house and after using her bathroom I used the air freshner - Airoma Wild Citrus Flowers - and I immediately recognised the scrent as that which my soon-to-be new boyfriend regularly wears. So he is spraying toilet air freshener on himself... I am speaking under correction but i doubt this is the norm.\n\nWhat should I make of this? Is he a weirdo? Perhaps he has financial problems and is using air freshener he scanenges from other people's toilets? I don't know my mind is going wild.  Is this a big deal? Should I be concerned or should I just relax?\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: if a man sprays toilet air freshener on himself is that a red flag?",

        "text": "So for context, I'm a sophomore in college and my social life is nonexistent. I've been struggling with not feeling connected with people and feel kind of out of it when I talk to people. But, I'm a pretty normal guy besides. I've even been told I'm a catch. I'm kind and I have good intentions, and want a healthy long term relationship.\n\nI think my main problem is I'm quiet and introverted and I have a sort of serious appearance. I've been told by friends that I'm handsome, which in my opinion seems to just make girls refrain from approaching my even more. On top of that, I commute to school, which I feel really limits the opportunities I have to meet people. \n\nI also think I'm not emotionally very intelligent and feel weak willed. I'm not good at sticking with things if I don't see results. I'm not the type to get angry or violent or anything, outwardly I'm almost always very calm. Inside, however, I can be a nervous wreck, an overthinker and a pessimist.\n\nI truly want to work through my problems and pursue a real relationship, but I have no idea how to do that. I've never dated before, but in highschool I had a foundation - my friends - which helped me feel grounded. I'm not used to actively pursuing relationships with people though. In college, I have no foundation, so I kind of feel like a building that might collapse if someone pushed on it the wrong way.\n\nI don't feel super depressed or unhinged or anything like that, and I feel more or less whole as a single person. I'm not looking for someone to complete me. I'm good at being alone, but it sometimes just hits me like a truck how lonely I truly am and how I long for a romantic relationship.\n\nI don't think I should go straight for a relationship yet, but I have no idea how to get to that point in the first place. So how can I get to that point?\n\nTL;DR I want to be good in a relationship but I have no idea how to get there. I'm a good natured person but I have no friends and have had difficulty connecting with people at school.",

        "text": "TL;DR My boyfriend (M18) and I (F18) want to be in a committed relationship and hang out more, but my mom doesn’t want to me dating until after I’m done with college. How to I please my mother while being true to my relationship and making the most of our situations? \n\nMe and my boyfriend are both 18, and we share the same plan to be in a committed relationship after our senior year with each other. Depending whether we end up at the same college, which is a big possibility, we still plan to stay close. We met on a school trip in December 2022 and have been together since. We’ve enjoyed dates, he’s introduced me to his family, and it’s been a wonderful experience. We share similar interests in music and have good values. Best of all, I consider him a friend as well as a romantic partner. However, my mother believes that he’s ‘brainwashing’ me and accuses me of settling for him, but we just like going on dates each week/ talk about everything in person and on the phone. Every time I mention his name, though, she can’t hide her disapproval and says that she’s just trying to make sure I secure I future for myself. Although I assure her I am capable of handling my relationship, she reacts negatively and says I have to wait until college (my parents are Catholic Asians who are on the stricter side while his family are Catholic Latinos who are also strict but still inviting. They are nice towards me). \n\nStill, she lets me see him and actually drives me to the places where we want to hang out and eat etc. I just feel so isolated because my mother and I can’t bond over this and I’ve had a hard time getting her on board with me seeing him often. My dad on the other hand, wants to meet him when the time is right, but expresses the same sentiment that I need to wait. Although I make a good effort to get my parents to meet his parents or go out to coffee, My parents refuse to do so currently. My mom constantly asks if I’m serious about him, and I reply yes; she’s suspicious and discourages me. I don’t know if this is her way of showing that she cares, but it doesn’t feel that way because we have a strained relationship and doesn’t ask me how my dates went/ what’s going on in my personal life. Can’t blame her though, my other siblings take up her time and she can’t communicate emotional things well. She doesn’t hold back anything and can come off insulting. I try my best not to get hurt or take comments personally, but words do sting and contributes to my anxiety. \n\nMy boyfriend though still makes an effort to meet my family because he wants to prove that we are in a good relationship. He’s very understanding. I myself, am working on getting my driver’s license and could possibly inherit my mom’s car. And I still have a strong feeling that my mother is going to like him too, she just doesn’t /refuses to get to know him right now. \n\nI’m just glad that we decided to be in a relationship with each other; not a choice made by our parents, but something we want to be. When he asked me to be his girlfriend, I knew my answer immediately. \n\nAnyway, I’m just inquiring for advice/ a little support because this is both our first serious romantic relationship and we both expressed that we want to learn about things with each other. I really hope that I’m not ‘straining’ my relationship with family, but I feel like the issues my mom brings up are based in no evidence, and I’m not going to let her paranoia hinder my life or my autonomy. If anyone has advice I’d gladly appreciate it *in regards to dysfunctional families and general relationship advice* thanks! :)",

Advice on how I should ask or express concern/support to them would be appreciated.\n\nMy friend has suddenly gone very distant on me over the span of a week. We were used to texting and sharing memes every day hanging out weekly to now maybe getting response over text. I know lately she has been quite stressed dealing with an HRO court hearing and I don't think she has come to terms yet but I am fairly certain deleted the bulk of her evidence and I know she is very anxious she is going to lose and she would probably have to leave the area if she lost. I have been trying to be supportive and people have been trying to help her figure things out.\n\nSome background to our situation/relationship is we tried dating for only a month back in December and it just wasn't going to happen at the time for her which was fine because we got along so well we just stayed friends and it has been working out well since, until now. We would usually still hang out platonically once-twice a week and now it has been a month since we have hung out, about 1.5 weeks of that was fine because she was on a vacation. The last time we hung out she seemed extra flirty with me as well which I just shrugged off and didn't read into it.\n\nWhen she got back we were still texting quite a bit and had some long phone calls and at first asking when we were going to hang out (which didn't pan out due to constant blizzards in our town) but the past week she has fallen off, I asked twice (probably to my embarrassment if anything) if I did anything wrong and she said no I was all good but it just feels so off. Around a week ago she also deleted almost all of her social media. I don't know if I should ask more about the distant behavior's, just send my support here and there regardless of getting a response or just try and act normal.",

        "text": "I've avoided relationships and serious connections with people since ending a toxic relationship in 2018. I'm now getting to know a man \\[27M\\] who is pretty intentional with our interactions and transparent about his desire to be serious. I like him and have no real reason to doubt his intentions but still find myself hunting for things to be annoyed with, things to consider a big enough red flag that I can bail like I normally do when men are suspicious. The problem is, he's not suspicious. And he's not doing anything; in fact, his approach is everything I'd want it to be... and I realize it's making me insecure?\n\nI feel inadequate compared to someone who is so together and so sure of what he wants. It's made me realize that my past relationship successfully eroded my self-confidence and distorted my self-awareness so I am now hyper-conscious of my shortcomings and incapable of realizing my good qualities. It has eliminated any hope that men may truly like me and want me, only me... or that any man would be faithful to a woman, let alone to me.\n\nThis has resulted in me sabotaging the dynamic by overthinking so much that I just don't know what to talk about, then I worry about coming off wrong or throwing off the potential chemistry which just makes it worse. Sometimes I don't reply as soon as I want to because I've convinced myself that he's not serious anyway. His consistency, transparency, and flattery ease me a bit though never for long.\n\nI feel silly because I can't tell if insecurity and trauma are fueling me to self-sabotage or if my intuition is flagging me down to show he's really not worthy of my time. Despite how it sounds, I feel like I'm kinda ready to pursue something more serious... but I'm afraid. I believe this is all rooted in fear of going back to the toxic spiral I fought so hard to come out of. Has anyone ever felt like this? Is it normal to be so confused and uncomfortable when trying to pursue the first \"real\" thing after a toxic relationship and breakup?\n\nTL;DR: My past relationship left me so insecure/scared/traumatized that I don't know how to behave in the pursuit of a new romance.",

        "text": "Hello Reddit, normally I'm one to read and follow stories here, but now this seems to be the best place to try and get some advice. \n\nI (27F) am concerned over my friend (17F) interacting and possibly dating a guy (20M), as he displays all the red flags my past abusive ex (17M and 16F at the time) had, and she is acting how did before I realized how bad the relationship was.\n\nBrief backstory for me: In high school I got into a relationship ignoring every red flag in the book, which led to the most traumatic time of my life, honestly something I'm still working on). In this relationship I was coerced/ forced into sexual activities, isolated from my friends and family, talked down to if I ever mentioned if things made me uncomfortable, and cheated on multiple times. I made excuses for him for the longest time until my mother finally sat me down to talk, and I realized the trauma and depression I was going through. After I ended things, he would stalk me to my car after school, and tried to use my parents to get us back together. The experiences left me with PTSD, and only recently have I found myself comfortable to try dating and getting intimate again.\n\nAnd to the main story now: My Friend, let's called her A, has been a coworker of mine for a while now, and our friendship is like that of siblings. Recently we hired a guy (just call him B) who was interested in A from the start. She didn't reciprocate feelings right away, but due to a complicated home life, it feels like she became interested in him because he was giving her attention and affection. As far as I know, they have not decided on a committed relationship, but they are close to the point they seem to be dating? As of late, he's been caught sneaking out of work )his second job that it run by the same owner) to call her during the day. Once waited for her to get off shift (on a day he wasn't working) to give her flowers. He's also confronted another coworker and told him to \"not talk to his girl\". At his other job he's also been caught talking about how excited he is to \"get with a younger girl\". and recently he's been hiding and possibly lying about his child and his custody rights. It doesn't help his living situation is that he's renting a couch outside of a person's trailer and frequently drinks and spends all of his money (of which he once gave his bank information to A so she \"could keep him in check\".\n\nThe main question I have now is, what do I do? I'm not her parent or siblings, I'm aware I can't keep her form him and that my own words will only go so far. I've told her my personal experiences and warnings, and now I won't bring it up anymore because her response has always been to defend him. Watching the whole situation unfold is like watching myself go through the same thing again, and it's becoming too much. I don't want to abandon her if she needs me, but it's really starting to take a toll on me mentally and resurfacing old memories and emotions. Part of me wants to put distance between us but feels guilty seeing what she might be getting herself into (it doesn't help she thinks I'm just paranoid of men because of my past, which makes me wonder if that's where all my uneasiness for B comes from.)\n\nSo Reddit, any advice? \n\nTLDR: My friend, who is like a sister to me, seems to be getting into a toxic relationship that reminds me of the most abusive one I went through, and I just don't know what to do anymore.",

I've asked about her picking up more of the housework (instead of splitting 50/50) but that's also not what she wants.

        "text": "About two weeks ago I had one of the most loveliest days. I had to bury my cousin who committed suicide on the same day as my late fathers birthday. It was the 5th birthday celebrated without him. Hitting milestones when grieving is especially difficult, and to say the least, I was very much not okay that day.\n\nThroughout the two years I’ve been with my bf, I have been very vocal about how these days/time of year is very difficult for me and in the moments I am explaining to him or venting to him, he is extremely understanding and very sweet. He tells me all the time that he understands it’s a hard time for me and sometimes I struggle and reassures me that he will always be there for me.\n\nSo two weeks ago, after I got home from burying my cousin, I texted my bf and asked if I could come over because I was just a wreck and wanted to be comforted by him/just spend time together while I was down. I was alone otherwise and didn’t want to be cooped up while I was such a wreck. He immediately seemed to get annoyed with me and said, “Well, my friend is here. I don’t really want to ask them to leave.” I understood that but also couldn’t understand why we all couldn’t hang out together? I asked him that and he said “Well we want to play video games and I know you’re gonna get upset about me not paying attention to you. My friend doesn’t want to do anything but play the game.” This response really annoyed me honestly, because I felt like he was prioritizing his friend wanting to play a video game over me. What really got under my skin is the fact that on Christmas, my boyfriend insisted that we spend time with this friend and leave my family gathering to spend time with him because said friend was upset. So we did. But when I’m having such an awful day and directly communicating to him that I do not want to be alone, he can’t do the same for me. \n\nHe went on to tell me that his friend had only just got there and therefore it would make it even more unfair if I came over. Come to find out, his friend had actually been there all day. By the time I had asked my bf if I could come over it was 6pm, the friend had been there with him since 11 am. And sure, they can hang out as long as they want, but why the fuck would my boyfriend lie? To make himself look better? To make me feel worse? I don’t know. But it makes me pretty angry, and also makes me feel uncared for and unprioritized. It makes me even angrier that my bf pretty much flipped the blame on me and told me there’s “things we need to fix in our relationship” because of this whole thing. He kept saying the whole time that he “wasted his hang out time with his friend” because he “only just got there” and was “texting me the whole time”. But that was a straight up lie? Because I wanted him to be there for me. But no, because his friend wants to play video games, that is the most important thing apparently.\n\nTLDR: I wanted to spend time with my bf and be comforted by him on a very awful day. He lied to me about his friend being at his house all day and insisted I couldn’t come over because his friend “just got there” (lie). However, we have adjusted plans to hang out with this same friend when he was upset and it bothers me not only that my bf would lie, but that he wouldn’t do the same for me.",

She's younger, completely different than me, attractive, quite frankly it's not her fault she knew of the situation but I literally hate her. I can't help it. I just sit here dwelling over the fact that he slept with her in the bed, and then he stayed with her in the morning, sending me messages and didn't admit to it until later in the day.\n\nWorst of all, a wedding is coming up for someone they work with and they are both going!\n\nI don't really know what I'm asking I am just wondering if anybody else has been in a similar situation?",

        "text": "This may seem like a silly question. I (28f) live with my bf (29m). We’ve been dating for 8 years. My family lives far away. I moved to this city for him (staying here, I love it here). His family is here. \n\nWe have had a very rocky relationship and I think I’ve FINALLY come to the conclusion that breaking up is for the best. He doesn’t have a job (on disability). So he doesn’t pay rent. I do. I’m the only one on the lease. Do I make him move out right away? His mother lives around 30 mins outside of town. Do I make him move back with his mom right away? \n\nWe’ve broken up / in the past over Covid and I let him stay with me until he figures things out and it resulted in us getting back together. However, few years later we still have all the same problems. I don’t want that to happen again.  The thing is He won’t move in with his mom. She lives a very “hoarder” style living and he can’t do that. He doesn’t have the money to move out. Do I let him stay until he finds a roommate somewhere? \n\nAlthough I resent him for a lot of things he’s done and said to me, I still care for him (for whatever reasons that may be). He will have nothing without me and I don’t know how to be okay with that. \n\nTl;dr I feel like I need to break up with my LT bf but I don’t know how to start or what the “rules” are.",

        "text": "I kissed a guy while he was on a break from his gf. Immediately regretted it. They got back together (I had a feeling hence the regret). I met her and she’s lovely. The guy flirted with me two more times after that. I didn’t shut it down if I’m being honest. I liked the attention. I was drunk. I mostly just laughed in response. Shitty thing to do tbh. I also changed from a sweater (hoodie) into a t shirt in front of him a few weeks later at a company event. I was in his car waiting and made him look away and I was wearing a bralette over top my bra but felt weird after that and apologized to him. In the moment I was just very hot and I just changed into a different shirt but after it felt inappropriate and that it wasn’t my place to do that. He didn’t look and I made sure but just a weird thing to do on my part. We stayed friends once I shut the flirting down. But now I’m looking at these instances and feeling incredibly guilty. And realizing he was basically cheating on his partner and I didn’t shut it down fast enough. I know it was only 2 times and both times but I just feel grossed out by my actions. I can’t answer for why I did what I did in the past but now months later I’m having intense anxiety over it so much so that I am having panic attacks. I’ve apologized to him and asked him to apologize to his gf and I’ve cut all contact off so as to not cause anymore problems. I feel horrible for his gf. I can’t even imagine how she feels and if she hates me she should honestly I was acting horribly. I just need to know how I can make things right? I feel super guilty and I just didn’t want to hurt his gf. It was a confusing relationship and they were always on/off again so I didn’t think much of it until now when I’m sober and in a better mindset. My bf thinks I’m overreacting but I genuinely do like the gf and feel so horrible for having hurt her like this. Is there anything I can do? I just hate how I acted so far and am truly apologetic. I wish I wasn’t such a selfish aH back then.\n\nTL:DR; panic attacks over past actions. I’ve apologized and distanced myself but is there anything else I can do?",

She confessed her feelings for me after and while I have had feelings for her for a long time, I was never going to act on them on account of her being the ex of one of my best friends. I was completely okay with dealing with the crush on my own and leaving it at that, but she kissed me, confessed, and one thing led to another. We’ve had a bunch of conversations since about what we want to do going forward and how the news was to be broken, but I cannot shake this feeling of guilt and indecisiveness. On one hand, I feel that would be telling him to assuage my guilt and it would only ruin our relationship as friends which is important to the both of us. However, on the other hand, I know that I want to be honest in my relationships and not hide something from him that may very well come out later on. I don’t know the best way to go about it- I really don’t want to lose him as a friend.\n\nBackstory: We were all really good friends while they were together and when he moved, I remained close with her and the other members of our group. Again, I always had a little crush, but I planned on ignoring it forever. He moved back to our town and they tried to get back together, but she didn’t want that anymore. I’ve been a close friend and confidante for the both of them and now I feel that I’ve betrayed one of my oldest friends and I don’t see a reason for him to want to reconcile.\n\nTLDR; I hooked up with my best friends ex and I’m scared that I may lose him.

        "text": "I need some help/perspectives/advice. Apologies and thanks in advance - this is long, so feel free to skim haha.\n\n\nI don’t feel like I can talk to friends/family about this, because my partner (29M) and I (28F) could be forever material, and I don’t want people close to us holding grudges if we’re able to resolve things.\n\n\nFirst of all, we’ve been together almost nine years, and for the most part are amazing together. Having gotten together so young, we do have a disadvantage as far as not having a chance to get out our messiness and figure out relationships with other people, and might not have the perspective we need for all issues. But we have similar backgrounds, make each other laugh constantly, enjoy a lot of the same things, and want the same kind of lives. \n\n\nWe’re really happy together most of the time, but our fights are sometimes really tough. We each have our own baggage/trauma that each seems very opposed to the other person’s. He grew up with an alcoholic, abusive father, and is often very avoidant. He often prefers to take time away from each other until things feel okay on his end again. I grew up in more of an emotionally abusive/neglectful household, and feel really unsafe with extended avoidance. \n\n\nThat’s probably more context than is really needed for this situation - basically, I approached him wanting to talk about plans we had made previously, and he told me something with his friends had come up.\n\n\nMe: “Hey, wanna talk about our plans tomorrow morning?”\nHim: “Actually I’m going to be doing [activity with friends] until probably really late tonight.”\n\n\nI told him I supported his time with friends, but felt kind of de-prioritized by the way he was treating the change of plans as a done deal, rather than something we could discuss. He kept checking his computer while we talked briefly about that, and I ended up saying something like “I know you want to get back, so we can figure this out tomorrow.”\n\n\nPretty small issue, honestly. But the next day, when I brought it up, he took issue with my description of the problem - I was saying how just stating that he had other plans (without touching base with me or letting me know whether or not he still wanted to do our pre-discussed thing), came off like a lack of investment in our thing, and I just wanted him to say something about our plans in that kind of situation. Like, “oh actually I had [thing with friends] come up - what would you think about moving [our couple thing]?”. \n\n\nHe said he was hurt that I wasn’t using “I” statements about the problem, and that I could just bring up the planning around his friends thing myself. I said that I didn’t see a problem with what I’d said - I wasn’t saying anything about him, or feelings, I was just talking about how the conversation landed (maybe this was wrong of me, and I should’ve restated regardless), and that that was why I was asking him to bring it up, if he was changing our plans. He said I wasn’t listening, and I said I wished he would just talk with me about the thing I was asking for, instead of just critiquing how I was having the current conversation. \n\n\nWe both got heated and were cutting each other off in conversation (something he hates). In talking about it after, he describes only me as getting heated/cutting him off, but from my remembering we were both doing so. This culminated in him telling me “Shut the fuck up. Fuck you, I’m out.” He has used similar language with me before, not often, but I told him then that I wasn’t going to have a relationship where we talk to each other like that. \n\n\nWe reconvened later that day and he told me he was feeling unsafe and like I was being like his father (raising my voice and getting activated). I basically dropped my issues and worked really hard to make him feel safe, talking with him about his feelings, apologizing for making him feel unsafe, and letting him know that that was a priority for me. We just chilled the rest of the night, I ran us a bath and we hung out and played music and just worked on being safe and comfy.\n\n\nToday I feel like an idiot for that, because when I told him I was still kinda sad about how he talked to me yesterday, and about how I never was able to resolve my original issue, he responded “that’s too bad you’re still feeling rough” and then got back on his phone. When I said I wanted more than that, I wanted to feel like he cared about my issue - he said he did care, but he would treat me exactly the same today, including telling me “fuck you”, because he didn’t want to have a heated conversation like his parents used to have, and that was an effective way to end it. I told him he could still end the conversation if he needed to and I supported that, but doing so by swearing at me and being so disrespectful wasn’t something I could handle. He was like “well, we’re between a rock and a hard place, I guess” and I was fighting tears and just said that I couldn’t have a conversation right now where I had to defend my right to not be told to shut the fuck up by my partner. He said, “fine, we can talk about this later. I can’t guarantee that I’ll have time today, but can plan on tonight”. \n\n\nSince then we’ve both been at work (working from home), but with not a lot to do. He’s been on voice chat with his friends, and I’ve just been trying to keep myself busy and feeling uncomfortable.\n\n\nI don’t know how to approach this. I might be reading into it too much, but it doesn’t feel like he cares very much about hurting my feelings, and if he feels justified lashing out with put that above worry about hurting me. I’m at a loss - I just want him to care about me, and currently feel like he doesn’t. And if I say that to him, his feelings will get hurt and we’ll end up talking about him instead of me again. I’m just frustrated. \n\nTLDR: It feels like he’s a great partner unless he’s working with his own hurt, and then mine doesn’t exist. I don't know how to approach this issue.",

        "text": "So about a week and a half ago, my gf (19f) and I (20m) came pretty close to breaking up due to our personal lives conflicting. She has no car, basically lives with her friend to be able to get to work and struggles with medical issues. I have been out of a job for awhile due to unforeseen circumstances, am currently preparing myself for my grandfathers death and starting a new job now after 2 months. We discussed our relationship and agreed to try making it work with our situation. The day after that conversation, we found out that she’s pregnant. We both come from traumatic backgrounds and struggle with those issues every day. I’ve always said I can never have a child because I’m afraid of how bad a father i would be. She’s also stated how she doesn’t want kids for a long time but when we found out, it changed. She and I both want the baby but we agreed not to because of her medical and our emotional issues. Plus our financial situation is really bad rn and we both live with our parents. She’s been really distant and when she’s present, she’s very emotional (understandably). But she thinks I don’t care about the baby to be or the aftermath of an abortion. I am very closed off about things and I’m overtly logical about every situation. I’m the “well here are the facts and here are the options” friend. I look at everything from an emotionally detached perspective because I believe it helps me to make better decisions. She’s much more emotionally driven which is one thing I love about her. My struggle is that I do care and that I stay up night after night thinking about the baby to be. Thinking of names, a home, a family, and a future. But my gf and I have been together less than a year and aren’t even ready to get an apartment together. She says she has to abort and I agree that we should. But I have no idea how this will affect our relationship. I want a family and a future with her but not yet. Not so soon and not when the timing couldn’t be worse. I’ve told her that. I’ve told her that if it was 3 or 4 years from now, I’d already be buying a stroller and writing down names for if it. I just don’t know how to support her. We are both in such bad emotional states. Her with the pregnancy and me having just said goodbye to grandfather for the last time, as well as us trying to fix our relationship. I need support and she needs space. I have no clue how to be supportive in this. I tried being more open about my feelings and she brushes me off even though she specifically asked me to be. I’ve cried to her about how this abortion isn’t what I want but something we agreed we need to do. Hell, I was already struggling with suicidal thoughts and when we found out about the pregnancy, I almost wrote my note. I didn’t sleep for 3 days. I also told her that I feel like I need to stay strong so she can be emotional and she told me no but it seems like I can’t be emotional  at all due to the situation. I just need advice on how to support her through this while also keeping myself together. \n\nTLDR; my gf and I are getting an abortion and I have no idea how to support her through this due to all the other issues in our lives.",

I always thought she was cute, and she came to me last night while I was at the bar asking if remembered her from the previous time we met, and then complemented me on my outfit. I ended up buying her a drink, and then we kind of separated for the night. I ran into her towards the end of the night, and we (and a few of her friends) shared an Uber together. In the Uber, she told me that i should come to their friend post game if our mutual friend ended up coming too (he didn’t, so I didn’t end up going).\n\nI definitely am a little interested in this girl (and I think she’s a bit into me too), but am unsure how to slide into her dm to start. I was hoping she would post something on her story that I could swipe up on, be she didn’t. Also, if I were to slide in, is it weird that I waited 1+ day? I’m not looking for anything serious with her and am just trying to have some fun (and from what I’ve been told, she’s not into serious relationships either), bc I move back home in like 2-3 weeks (graduation).

        "text": "TL;DR - In a 7 month relationship (our first). We haven't seen each other in 2 weeks but we text every day. I used to be codependent but I fixed it by having 1 week of no contact. Calls? Not so much because he has covid at the moment with a sore throat. \\*\\*I don't know if the one-week contact broke me but I don't really want to initiate any hangouts because I actually enjoy being alone right now. No, I'm not losing interest and would still be open to the idea of spending time together if he asks for it- meaning asking for a breakup right now is out of the question.\n\n**Q: Can we coexist doing our own thing (independence) but still want each other? And is it normal if you don't always do cute couple stuff together?** I get that we're young (not married) and are still working on building our future so I assume that should be the priority right now.\n\nOur relationship dynamic used to be me being very codependent and wanting to see each other 1-2 times a week and just do everything together. The past 4 months have been very hard and it wasn't until recently when we had a 1 week of no-contact (I asked for this) which helped me fix my codependency issues and start enjoying my own space again. Now I am just focused on school and gym but still try to spend time with my bf when I'm available compared to always prioritizing him and making him my entire world before.\n\nWe haven't seen each other in 2+ weeks because of all the fighting and he's sick (lately I've been doing his homework for him so he doesn't fall behind in school). I've talked to my bf before about breaking up but he doesn't want to and he still wants to make it work. I wouldn't say he's emotionally unavailable but rather he doesn't show affection very well online (like I'm talking to a wall, texts dry). We currently don't have any activity we can do together online other than watching a movie together. He's very good at coding so I can't really bond with him over that because he's too lazy to share his passion for it (also I don't know how to code) and can find gratification in other ways like through his male friends. In the times that we are together he's very affectionate and caring. I'd describe him as a very simple guy. He never expects anything from me, he never made me pay on a date/drives us to places.\n\n**Since we're young should I just enjoy the relationship and just focus on school?** I have a feeling I am overthinking like he's losing interest/he's talking to someone else...**or maybe we're only in a relationship just for the sake of staying together even when there's no chemistry?** The reason I say that last part is because we don't really do anything crazy romantic things like have a picnic together, or go on dates often, we don't have a lot of pictures together either (personally I think it's mostly because we both feel awkward since we don't usually take videos of ourselves but our friends when we're with them).",

She’s pretty and a very good student straight As. \n\nHowever I dropped out at 16 to pursue my business that I sold at 19. I’ve made 3 real estate purchases. I’m successful for my age. \n\nMe and my sister both applied for uni this year, I entered less competitive unis like Surrey and York. She went for economics in UCL, LSE etc etc. she’s been met with 5 rejections and I’ve had 5 acceptances. \n\nI’m sure this is a massive blow to her, as she was so arrogant about being a millionaire investment banker. This is all due to my dad brain washing her with his desires. \n\nAfter turning her into a very rude and entitled person, he refuses to parent her. My mum is the only one who will confront her. \n\nNow my two lady straws have been two incidents. \n\n1. She does a very narcissistic thing, where she joke bully’s a person and puts them down. Shes done this recently again, where a family friend was concerned at how she treated me. I confronted her and apparently she was on the phone, she muted and unmuted / said lies to make it seem like she was the victim to her bf. No accountability \n\n2. If she’s in a bad mood, she’ll say shut up, go away your so annoying if you try and make contact.\n\nAny advice on how to cut her off, if there’s any saving it ? I don’t an someone so disrespectful and who likes putting me down in my life. What can I do \n\nTd;lr looking to cut off my sister",

Far from it.\n\nWe have a great time hanging out with friends, playing games or watching TV and movies but she just never wants to go do things.\n\nI love going to bars or concerts or just going and doing things. She never does. She would rather just sit in and read a book or watch a movie or play board games. Which I love about 50% of the time. But I wanna go out, listen to music, have a few drink and stay up late every now and again.\n\nThis wouldn’t be a problem but she also wants me to be with her as much as we can but when we go to bars, live music or anything like that she wants to leave as soon as we can or looks like she isn’t having fun. But we were even just on vacation last week and there was a beach bar with live music and she avoiding going and when we went wanted to leave after about an hour. Not late at night either around 5pm… Idk really what to do.\n\nI want to have a conversation with her to come to a civil compromise but idk how to approach the subject without an argument.\n\nIt is important to note she does not drink (she has no problem with it).\n\nTL;DR My wife never wants to go out an do anything but always wants me with her. She would rather stay in all the time and when we do go out she wants to leave right away and idk how to have a civil conversation with her about it.",

        "text": "My boyfriend thinks im a complete liar and has been calling me that for the past few weeks. He believes other people stories over mine. He is close friends with my sister and I don't what she tells him but I do notice that he believes her over me. My sister used to lie to me about things about my boyfriend but it all stopped when I would find out the truth. He knows she used to lie to me and told me we both have something it common but still takes her side.\n\nLast night I was suppose to come over to his house to spend time with him and go to the store. I thought we were going to see each other early around 7pm so i started getting ready. I was waiting for him for hours to text me when to come over because he was out and wouldn't be home until 10 something and told me to leave at 10:10 cause he believed he'll be home by then. My sister came over to my house around 8pm while I was getting dressed to drop something off and left seconds later. Earlier this same day my sister told me she had been terrified because she felt like her ex was stalking her at her house. I told my mother about it and around that time my sister stopped answering the phone. So my mom got worried and I told her I would drive past her house on my way to see my boyfriend.\n\nAround 10pm I got some gas, drove past my sister house then to his house. While I was leaving from driving past my sister house, he calls me and ask what was I doing which I explained. I get to his house and he starts to question how im dressed. Because of the way I was dressed he told me that I went out to another guy house before coming to his. I really dressed up to come see him and felt like i always dressed up like that but to him i don't and was dressed too differently and better. No matter what i told him he didn't believe it.\n\nI slept over at his house and woke up and went home before he got up for work. It was a good night a good time until this afternoon he calls to tell me that im a liar and that it was over. He said he just got done speaking to my sister and according to her, I didn't leave the house at 10pm I left at 8pm, she didn't talk to me the whole day and I didn't come from my sister house when he called. I tried to explain everything and send screenshots + proof but he wasn't trying to hear it and told me it was over, told me he was tired of my lying and that when im ready to have a real conversation about things we can talk and hung up. I have more proof of me leaving the house but he refuses to see it. I tried to talk to my sister and she confirmed everything I said but thinks he must've gotten some parts she said confused. She didn't know I drove by her house but did mention she did see me at 8pm but said she didnt say that was the time I left.\n\nHours all before this happened he had called me but i was asleep then texted me to never text him again and he doesn't want to talk anymore. All because I didn't answer the phone. Now it leads up to this. Need help on what to do next.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: boyfriend dumped me for good after accusing me of lying. He talked to my sister on the phone to questions her about my actions then called to dump me. Wouldn't give me a chance to defend myself. This is his third time trying to break up with me this week.",
