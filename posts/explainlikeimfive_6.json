Something that's really thrown me though is piece values, especially why bishops are worth so much.\n\nI can understand that in openings they're powerful since you can play offensively without sacrificing defensive pawn structure or too many moves like a rook would require (e.g: Kádas opening), but given that they can only take on their own color - an immediate weakness exploitable using nothing but pawns - and have a limited number of viable positions compared to the granular placement of a rook given sufficient moves I don't understand why they're valued higher.\n\nknights can deliver checks/takes behind an opponent's cover and rooks can go onto any color of tile, surely you'd want to sacrifice bishops in mid/end game situations due to the limitations and difficulties of actually getting an endgame checkmate with one (even two still looks aggravating), but I haveve seen mid and high level players prioritizing taking them over other pieces during endgames.",

Said as soon as the infection is taken care of, it should close up pretty quickly!\n\nThe doc said it was not my doing and gave me antibiotic eardrops and amoxicillin to get rid of the infection and drainage.\n\nThe drainage is doing a lot better already, but my hearing is still muffled and occasionally I will feel and hear a slight popping sensation with no pain, does this mean it is working? And will my hearing return soon or do i have to wait for it all to fully heal before that improves? \n\nSorry for being all over the place I just need to know because i feel like it is vastly improving, but i would love for the muffling to lessen more.
