I got £168 worth of books for £50. Insane! \n\nBrought the box into work, to go through them and many people were so shocked. Which sparked a conversation, where one of the guys hasn’t read since he was in school. He’s in his 50s, I asked him… what do you do to entertain yourself or for fun.. and he couldn’t answer. He’s not into films, listens to the generic radio for music.\n\nThen I found myself justifying how I read so much and what I do to fit it in, maintain my goals.. and realised that I actively make room for books/audiobooks of all varieties. I find them an integral part of my life.\n\nThey seemed bemused, but not convinced.\n- How would you convince a non reader to read if you had to? \n- Or what book would you recommend?",

Of course, her heroines are generally handsome (and clever, and {eventually marry} rich), but it is not so romantisised? It is more like an evident asset to ones character and I guess, it generally betrays that the character is \"morally higher than the lower class\". But looks seem to be always overshadowed by characters actions in the end. And I think it is kinda cool. \nAnyone else noticed this or compared it to Victorian preocupation with beauty + melodrama? \n\nI just thing that it is a kind of huge shift in literature. Maybe it indicates people later in the 19th century were better off and could focus more on aesthetic appeal, art for art's sake and so on. \nBut yea, after all Austen entered the 19th century and things had to change quite a bit since. \n\nI just find it funny how she is put into this \"stereotypical romance writer\" box. Meanwhile being in Dorian head's now, all the \"womanly scheaming to marry well\" seems like a rocket science in comparison.",

As Hagrid had said, what would come, would come… and he would have to meet it when it did. Instead, he smiled, raised a hand in farewell, turned around and led the way out of the station towards the sunlit street, with Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and Dudley hurrying along in his wake. \nHis hand closed automatically around the fake Horcrux, but in spite of everything, in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead of himself, in spite of the final meeting with Voldemort he knew must come, whether in a month, in a year, or in ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with Ron and Hermione.

        "text": "This was the first novel published by Jane Austen in 1811.\n\nSimple plot, like all Austen stories(:⁠-⁠P), there are 2 protagonists, Marianne and Elinor. The major part of the book deals with the love life and heartbreak of Marianne, the younger sister of Elinor. The sisters have opposite thoughts towards love, which is a debated point in the book.\n\nThe title of the book is fairly justified; the book portrays how common the lack of sense is in society, for the protagonists are shown to be civil and sensible.\n\nOne thing is for sure, Jane Austen very well knows how to display the stupidity of characters through her writings. Of course, her novels are more aptly 'novels of manners' than romance novels so it is expected for the author to be judgemental and sarcastic about characters, but the wit she presents so subtly and unexpectedly is remarkable.\n\nI got bored in the second of the three parts of the book, because I found it to be dwelling too much on the heartbreak of Marianne, but the story gained pace towards the end.\n\nThe book won't disappoint anyone, we get what's expected - romance, wit, sarcasm, intelligence and unintelligence.\n\nOne of the most important thing that I noticed was that never be too harsh to judge anyone in your friend or family circle - we should learn to accept every kind of behaviour. For in the book, Mrs. Jennings seemed to be the least appealing to Marianne, but she's the one who supported her till the end!\n\nSpoiler alert!\n\nAccording to me, one thing that Jane Austen wanted to highlight is the similarity in the characters and contrast in the circumstances of Willoughby and Edward. Edward and Willoughby both didn't speak clearly to their respective lovers, and hence the latter were left to assume their relationship by themselves. But in the end Edward's situation turned out to be beneficial for Elinor, whereas Willoughby due to his greed, hurt Marianne. I wonder what Edward would have done if Lucy didn't undergo a transfer of affections.\n\nAlso as in the initial part, Marianne thought of herself as well as seemed as the most sensible character in their society, when in fact she turned out to be the most stupid for loving someone like Willoughby so blindly; because I always assumed Willoughby to be a playboy, as perceived from certain descriptions as well as the behaviour portrayed in the book.",

I found the prose to be beautiful and well-written, and the story kept me interested, but also I wondered what the point of it all was - and maybe that is the point? \n\nAlso, I found myself pissed off, especially with Edith, who was just an awful person, and Lomax and Charles Walker.

        "text": "I recently read \"Fairy Tale\" by Stephen King and found it to be quite enjoyable. As a fan of King's work, I found this book to be a great addition to his collection, and although it's not his best work, it's still a solid read.\n\nThe plot is intriguing and kept me engaged throughout the book. It's a classic tale of good versus evil, but with a modern twist that makes it unique. The characters are well-developed xD. The villains are okayish terrifying and give the book a sense of urgency and danger.\n\nKing's writing style is, as always, fantastic.\n\nOne thing I particularly enjoyed about this book was the use of fairy tales as a theme. King's re-imagining of these classic tales was refreshing and added a layer of depth to the story that kept me hooked xD.\n\nThough the book does have its flaws. At times, the plot can be confusing, and the ending is somewhat underwhelming. There are also a few scenes that drag on for too long and could have been cut down.\n\nOverall, \"Fairy Tale\" is a moderately enjoyable read that will kept me entertained from beginning to end. It may not be King's best work, but it's still worth picking up.\n\nDunno why I'm writing this, but I'm kind of eager to share.",

        "text": "I tried reading The Color Purple by Alice Walker in 9th grade, but was immediately put off by how utterly miserable the first few pages are. Years later, I picked it up again and just finished the whole book...wow. It's a spectacular story about two sisters finding agency, spirituality, and love in their lives. I highly recommend listening to the audiobook version, since it's narrated perfectly by Alice Walker herself.\n\nJust as a trigger warning, the book definitely starts at the lowest point, where the main character Celie is sexually assaulted and abused as a teenager (to describe it lightly). This was definitely tough to get through, but the story is ultimately about her self-empowerment, finding agency, and exploring sexuality and love. \n\nThis book is truly ahead of its time. Interwoven beautifully with the narrative are nuanced discussions of:\n- African American family dynamics in the 1900s\n- African tribes and their relationships with Christian missionaries\n- Different levels of misogyny and sexism in both American and African society\n- Spirituality not being same as strictly defined religion\n- The human will to live and survive through trauma\n\nOverall, this book was a transcendant and incredibly healing experience. Highly recommend, 10/10",

        "text": "As the title says, I’m 17. I’ve been an avid reader since elementary school, but have only read YA books and some adult fantasy. I kept seeing posts and videos about how great classic literature was and I felt left out so I just went ahead and picked up a well talked about book that sounded really interesting: Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. \n\nI didn’t research the book much. All I knew going in was that it was about a Russian man being driven to murder. I heard that it was hard to read and often slow but that it was worth it. And I honestly expected to not enjoy it and to find it a slog. But I was very, almost extremely surprised by how much I…loved it! The writing seemed to flow really well, the characters leapt off the page with how eccentric and boisterous they all were. Raskolnikov was such a hilariously pathetic maniac that I couldn’t help feeling sympathy for him and kept wanting him to succeed despite how twisted his actions and morals were. His internal struggle gripped me at every turn. The character development was wonderful and harrowing to read. The environment and society that Dostoyevsky portrayed and the way he had Petersburg and the general society of the time crucially affect the characters lives and actions without actually drawing immediate attention to it was amazing and felt so real. The ending left me floored with how funny it was. That’s my biggest surprise was how funny the whole book was. There were so many jokes and hysterical moments that it made the depressing and philosophical tangents feel all the more impactful. \n\nNeedless to say, I could rave about the book for hours. I’ve never read a book that gave me so much to think about. But because it’s given so much food for thought, I’ve realized that I might have missed quite a bit of the depth and meaning to a lot of the moments, philosophy, and social insinuations. Simply because of my age and lack of broad knowledge and experience. I feel like there was a second story underneath the text on the page, but that I’m not smart enough to really grasp it. How do I get over this and fix it before moving on to other similar classics? I want to read The Karamazov Brothers next but I’m afraid I’ll end up missing out on the big picture and small subtleties like I think I did with Crime and Punishment. \n\nWhat advice can you give me?\n\nPleas and thank you, with gratitude!",

And by a sequence of what I call a mixture of miracles and political intelligence (he was a boy still), he gathered warriors and became powerful. And not just some warriors, but (by wit and a lack of ability to forgive), he overthrows initially all tribes in the Mongolian steppe and becomes the Khan of all Mongols.\nAnd he doesn't stop there.

        "text": "I am tired of western publishers treating cartoon books as if they're for kids. It seems as if every western book aimed at anyone over the age of 10 is a wall of unreadable wall of text. The western publishing industry treats anyone who relies on cartoons for information as people who have issues. They think everyone who has a IQ 500 and can process 5,000,000 pages at once and that anyone who can't is too stupid for them. If they just instead of focusing put 10 million words to make a verbose book and disregarding anyone who just wants some cartoons as stupid, they would have a much bigger audience. They instead treat cartoon fans as illiterate and then claim with their superority complex that people aren't reading anymore and are therefore stupid. What makes this even worse is that Asian Countries which have a higher rate of readership already have a whole industry of adult cartoon books. Cartoons are capable of being art. Grave of the Fireflies is a cartoon movie, yet it has been lauded as one of the most moving films of all time. Bloom County is just a newspaper cartoon, but it won a Pulitzer prize. So what is your problem, Western publishers? I know a lot of people are saying \" UM, AKSCHUALLY, read comic books 🤓” or \"Cartoons are for babies, Books are meant to be imagined\". So what is your problem Western publishers? I used to read tons of fiction as a kid, but now I can only read nonfiction books due to them actually caring about cartoons. Western publishers are trying to appeal to various demographics, but they keep on treating cartoon fans as stupid people. If someone were to make a book about the Vietnam war and have cartoons in it, it would be lauded as Grave of the FireFlies, but for books. I know that a lot of you say that cartoons are “expensive”, but then how come they rewrite entire books as comic books and not simply adding cartoons to the original book? So one last time, What is your problem with cartoons, western publishers?!",

The way the author has narrated the story through Arthur in the web novel is amazing and I fell that the webcomic fails to capture that essence.\n\nSame is the case with Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint, even though in my opinion it is the best webnovel ever written and yet it did not get the recognition it deserved till it became a webcomic. The way the Author had described the antics of Kim Dokja are legendary and even though the web comic does not miss out on anything, it does miss out on the essence of the writers in the story.\n\nI came across a new Webnovel named \"Purgatory\" that web novel was extremely enticing and well written, it's story was a banger and the way the author narrated it made me feel like I was a part of the story. This novel was on the same level as the greats in the bracket of web novels but it had little to no recognition whereas many below par web comics had a much wider audience.\n\nTo me it seems like injustice, but I understand that people like to see picture more that they want to read, they want to have their imagination limited by the drawing placed infront of them.

I was proved wrong once again when I read \"The Cathedras: Intentional Mistakes\" that book was just a  part of a bigger story still being written, but there was just something different about. The way the writer wrote in the perspective of different characters. The way he mixed modernity into medievality was mindboggling. \n\nNormally fantasies are written in a particular way and that way is to show the characters as living in a medieval world. \"The Cathedras\" had surpassed those limitation and shown to me a whole new possible way of writing fantasies.",
