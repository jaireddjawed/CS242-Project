Aside from basic SOLID and DRY principles, avoiding brute force / hardcoding i dont think i have improved dramatically.\n\nI feel that most of my projects are far from optimized and probably will have glaring issues / code smells upon further inspection. I often rotate between the \"if it works then it works\" and the \"i think can make one small change to make this run faster, and end up spending the entire day on insignifcant performance increase\" mindsets.\n\nNot sure if i need reassurance or somebody to tell me to wake tf up. I passed on an SWE internship and took on a role as a tester instead because of how unprepared i feel. Everyone around me told me i was an idiot and should just fake it till i make it. When will i know im ready ?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/11pmc3z/should_i_obtain_pm_or_it_certifications_given_my/",
        "text": "As a quick outline, I’m looking to transition careers and/or continue obtaining certifications and am looking for advice to the best approach. Input as to where to focus next is highly valued and I want to thank you all in advance for your input on this inquiry.  \n\n\nObjective: \n\nTo transition from Real Estate Sales into Project Management. I have roughly five years’ of on paper PM experience (over the last ten years) in the small business environment.   \n\n\nRecent endeavors: \n\nI obtained PMP® and PMI-ACP® certifications in early March, and I have seen a slight increase in outreach already. I have reached out to multiple recruiting services over the last two weeks and have received basically no follow-ups. Additionally, I’ve applied for roughly 150 jobs over the last two months which I’ve had roughly five over the phone interviews.  \n\n\nFuture possible endeavors: \n\nNow the question is, do I start applying for positions only, focus on online networking, continue a balance approach of applying for jobs while also obtaining more certifications, or something else?  \n\n\nMy current path: \n\nGiven my situation I’ve narrowed it down to two primary paths which include moderate levels of both job applications and continuing certifications. \n\n1. PM Path - This seems the simplest from here given that I have one of the highest and most accredited certifications (PMP) you can have in this domain. Continuing certifications, in order of operation, if I wanted to continue down a mastery path would be:\n\na. Certified Scrum Master (CSM)\n\nb. PMI-RMP® - PMI Risk Management Professional \n\nc. IASSC Certified Lean Six Sigma Black Belt™ (ICBB™)\n\nThe only drawback I see to this approach would be that I may be viewed as overly specific. \n\n2. Analytics/Software Path - I’ve had a few interviews for PM roles that I’ve been looked over because they want someone who understands specific systems, most commonly SAS, SAP, Salesforce, BlueYonder, MS Project, Xactimate, or insert one of a hundred other applications here. \n\nWhile worthwhile, I feel it would be difficult to obtain certifications for specific software packages until I acquire a job with an existing set of systems. Therefore, I thought a good offset for a lack of individual software experience would be to acquire Analytics and IT based certifications. Certifications, in order of operation, if I wanted to continue down this more general path would be:\n\na. ITIL 4 Foundation &gt; ITIL 4 Managing Professional\n\nb. Google Data Analytics Certificate for introductory phase (not really a certification)\n\nc. Associate Big Data Analyst (ABDA™)  \n\n\nConclusion/Advice:\n\nDoes being more rounded with generally certifications seem to be a better use of time than mastering the PM approach? Do these seem like good potential certifications to take if the former? Are there certifications out there you would recommend instead? Should I focus on individual software systems instead? Should I focus more on blanketing my resume and work on acquiring a position now? \n\nFinally, it may also be worthwhile to potentially go back to a brick-and-mortar university for a B.S. Civil Engineering Degree, but I’ve been reluctant to do so given the cost and that I have a M.S. Business Management Degree. I feel I get overlooked a lot because my degrees, while from accredited universities, are not exactly household names. Thoughts on this?   \n\n\nEducation/Certifications/Licenses: \n\n• M.S. Business Management\n\n• B.S. Business Management\n\n• A.S.S. Construction Engineering\n\n• Technical Certificate of Computer Aided Drafting Technology\n\n• Project Management Institute - Project Management Professional (PMP)\n\n• Project Management Institute - PMI Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP)\n\n• Real Estate Affiliate Broker - Two States  \n\n\nRoles (by title): \n\n• Director of Operations – 1.7 Years\n\n• Project Manager – 2.3 Years \n\n• Real Estate Agent / Property Manager – 2.5 Years\n\n• Operations Manager – 5.1 Years\n\n• Lead – 4.5 Years",

        "text": "Hi all! I'm still processing this news as it's still pretty fresh. I interned with a company for essentially 3 summers (started in Fall 2021; ended in Summer 2022). I never received an ounce of negative feedback my entire time there. I was really hoping I'd get an offer after graduation (because how could I not???). \n\nLast September I receive a survey from the company saying that they were interested in my next steps and I filled it out immediately. It wasn't an automated email but rather sent from a real person who works there (we connect on LinkedIn - he's very nice). I'm thinking, \"ok great! They didn't forget about me! I have a fat chance of walking away with a return offer\". Now, my roommate told me to always have a back-up plan and that I should still look for jobs. I thought to myself, \"nahhhh nothing is going to go wrong. I'll get my offer :)\". I was wrong.\n\nFebruary 2023 rolls around. I email the woman in charge of talent acquisition and inform her I'll be graduating very soon (this May) and am interested in potential full time opportunities. A few days later, I get this heartbreaking email:\n\n\"Thank you for reaching out! I hope all has been well.\n \nAt this time, I’m unfortunately not working on any positions that would be a fit for you. However, please feel free to check out our career’s page and apply to openings that look of interest.\n \nBest of luck with your last semester!\"\n\nNow, when I first read the email, I was in SHAMBLES, rightfully so, as I was really banking on this job. I was thinking, \"oh dear god WHAT DID I DO WRONG?\", feeling like an absolute failure ( I still do). After re-reading it a few more times, I realized it has nothing to do with my performance explicitly, but rather there are no roles for me straight up! I'm thinking that since I wrapped up my internship last Summer, there hasn't been any entry level SWE roles under this company AT ALL (which makes sense given the market we are in currently). It's crazy because I have not seen any entry level SWE openings on the career's page since I looked last Fall. Now, when I checked the career's page just now, I ONLY see senior SWE roles. Upon doing the whole job search, I'm finding mostly senior level roles which is disheartening. \n\nIt took me a while to realize that the email doesn't say \"you can't EVER work here again!! Don't come back!!\". She said she doesn't have anything for me RIGHT NOW. Which doesn't mean forever. Who knows?? A role could open up in a couple months or even 6 months to a year.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for my internship experience, I think I'll have a leg up on some candidates. However, it would have been a dream to finally make that, \"I'm pleased to announce I'll be an incoming SWE at 'X company' after interning with them\" post on LinkedIn. Because that's what LinkedIn is, you basically jerk yourself off right?\n\nI know it's not the end of the world, but it sure feels like it. It really sucks how this \"recession\" is eating up the tech space. I'm also going to stop looking at my feed on LinkedIn for a while. I love seeing folks land their internship/full-time roles and I'm excited for them! Just a little sad for me, you know? When I was applying for my very first internship role, I made a big a** spreadsheet with like 50 rows on it. Now, I don't even have the motivation/energy to do that. Resisting the feminine urge to crawl into bed and not come out. \n\nHow does someone intern with a Fortune 50 3 times but can't land the job?\n\nAnyone else in the same boat as me? Anyone not get a return offer because of this f*cked up market we're in?? Please comment down below.",

I often find myself torn between different career paths, unsure of which one to pursue. I am hoping to seek guidance and advice from those who have experienced similar struggles or have insights to share.\n\nOn one hand, I am considering learning web development, specifically focusing on html/css/js and if you look on my post history i am doing it currently alongside with job. I am aware that this field is oversaturated at the entry level, but the potential for a high income without a degree is appealing. However, I am also intimidated by the numerous frameworks and libraries which i will have to learn, which can be overwhelming for a beginner. projects made by me are total garbage. Also to be honest i have not any interest in this field and currently learning it only for money.\n\nOn another hand, I am also drawn to the growing field of data science. I find math to be intriguing, and this field seems to be expanding rapidly. Pursuing a degree in this field seems like a viable option, but I am afraid about potentially failing at this path and wasting my 20s.\n\nFurthermore, in regards of my current situation I have graduated law, but the legal industry in my country pays poorly so i am concerned about missing opportunities in lucrative field of tech and i constantly tell myself that if you work harder for 2/3 years maybe you will land well paying job. but since middle school i was not friend with numbers and performed terribly in STEM subjects so at least it seems safer path but less rewarding.\n\nAt the same time, I desire financial stability and the ability to provide for my family. my dream is too safe up money up to one million. I feel like i am in my turning point right now, feel anxious everyday , concerned that I may make a devastating mistake in choosing the wrong path. I blame myself to be unprincipled, inconsistent stupid, individual.\n\nHow to choose one right path to follow principally ?\n\nThank you in advance for your guidance and support.",

Of course this is a necessity in every field, and I think I’m good at it. But I would like to do a lot less. I also wish to be in a field that will encourage more working at home and hybrid working opportunities. Frankly I face quite a bit of dread and anxiety because of how much this is expected from me in this field. So much so I can’t seem to sleep properly due to the stress of thinking about work.\n\nAdditionally, I found coding only in SQL (which is the primary job 80% of the time) quite limiting and not much avenues for growth. \n\nAs such I’ve thought of two paths and wanted to get your opinions\n1) I’ve started a course for a front end developer pathway and working through it everyday so I can switch to a new career in the software field asap.\n2) I can transition into a data engineer field as I heard that this role would be aligning with what I have learnt so far, but focus more on coding rather than the client facing aspects of data analytics.\n\nHope there’s anyone else that may have followed the same path. But regardless would love to hear your thoughts. \n\nThanks all!",

        "text": "Happy Sunday y’all. Need some advice here. I’m currently a construction estimator making 46k. It’s a not a bad gig for graduating college last year. Some days are better some days are worse as with any job. But, I don’t see myself really growing in this career field and I don’t see much room for for growth. Benefits, PTO, etc are all meh. The only reason I’m staying for now is because I live with my parents and it’s close by, so it’s the “safe and comfortable” option for now. But whenever I move out (August-September) I know that I will want to be somewhere else with better pay/benefits. I was curious to see if there’s a way I can pivot my knowledge of estimation - pricing, quoting, takeoffs, bidding, emailing/phone communication, reading blueprints/construction plans/specs into a more tech related field? Classes to take? Companies to look out for? Any help is appreciated! Or, if you recommend staying in the construction industry and looking into new or more modern companies that can help too. Thanks!",

Additionally, and more importantly, I just need the extra cash so I figured I could start some freelance work on the side. I understand this may be filled with n00b questions, but I'd like to learn the intricacies of freelance work.\n\n1. Which websites/sources can I find freelance work to begin with?\n2. How would you recommend building a site for a potential client (i.e. Wordpress/SquareSpace vs building your own project from scratch)\n3. What are the pros and cons of the methods listed above?\n4. Is either method preferred over the other depending on the ask of the customer?\n5. Let's say I did decide to build my own project for a customer. What happens once the project is done? Do I ask them to acquire their own domain? Have them set up their own Heroku or AWS account to host the database I've set up for them? Should I give them access to their project's repo on my github or have them create their own github? I guess I'd like to know how to hand off the project to the customer. (Somebody please let me know lol T-T)\n6. If I used Squarespace/Wordpress (FYI: haven't learned them yet), do I have them create their own accounts and then basically just work on their sites there?\n7. Are there any tips/pitfalls anyone can share in regards to freelance work?\n\nAgain, my apologies if these questions are really entry level. If anyone has any guides or sources I can reference for this kind of thing, it'd be much appreciated!\n\nThank you kindly in advance!",

        "text": "Hi guys,\n\nI am a soon-to-be college graduate from the midwestern US. I am graduating this May from a top 50 university with a BS in Financial Mathematics and a minor in Computer &amp; Information Science.\n\nInitially, I wanted to gain the skills to become an actuary through my degree, but I've decided instead to aim towards becoming a software engineer, preferably in a role where advanced math is applicable (back-end, AI/ML, game design, data science).\n\nUnfortunately, I did not do well academically throughout my schooling due to a multitude of personal struggles, so I'll be graduating with about a 2.3 cumulative GPA.\n\nIn addition, I do not have any completed programming projects to showcase to future employers. I do not have a portfolio page to put them either. However, I do have a GitHub, and I know roughly how to use it.\n\nLastly, I do not have any internship or full-time professional experience related to either financial mathematics or computer science at this time.\n\nMy coursework related to mathematics included: \n* multivariate calculus, \n* linear algebra, \n* differential equations, \n* scientific computing, \n* financial economics, and \n* derivative pricing.\n\nMy coursework related to computer science included:\n* introduction to programming in Java,\n* data structures in Java,\n* discrete mathematics,\n* data structures &amp; algorithms,\n* computer systems, and\n* information security.\n\nGiven my situation, I am wondering where I should focus my energy in the coming months. My concerns are:\n* if you were someone with little academic success (but a STEM degree), no programming projects, no professional experience, but some OOP knowledge with Java, would you apply to jobs or build your portfolio?\n* is completing an internship necessary before finding a full-time software development position?\n* should I branch out to learn new technologies, such as HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and build additional projects with those? How far down the Node/React/SQL pipeline should I go?\n\nMy thought was to begin The Odin Project to learn to build web applications through the \"Full Stack JavaScript\" track, build and showcase my own projects afterwards, then practice for interviews on LeetCode while applying to jobs, but I'd still be months away after graduation from being hired.\n\nWhat do y'all think?",

        "text": "Fullstack web, 2yr XP.\n\nLong story short Ive been out of work since December when the first company I was at shut down suddenly. Pretty desperate for work. Finally got an offer from a company but I haven't talked to anyone face to face. Its $70/hr WFH \"flexible schedule\", good benefits.\n\nRecruiter hits me up and asks me to fill out a questionnaire with some easy technical and soft-skill questions. I send it and she replies with basically \"congrats you got the job, send your address and well get an offer letter together.\n\nNow I'm sitting with the offer letter in hand, knowing nothing about the role aside from an extremely generalized job description, not having met anyone from the team. They're about to send a whole home office setup to my house. The offer letter also requires images of my driver's license, so if this is a scam then that would be the endgame for them.\n\nThe company is legit, very large, and very corporate based on Glassdoor reviews. I have not seen anyone who had the same onboarding experience.\n\nI responded today asking for a video meeting with someone from the dev team or the dev manager, and mentioned my reservations about accepting an offer without having spoken to a person.\n\nI guess my questions are, how common is this? Am I doing the right thing asking for a meeting? Will they rescind the offer because I'm giving them a hard time?\n\nAlso relevant -- in final stages of interviews with another company I really want to work at. I don't plan on telling either company about the other.",

But when they send me coding assessments, I get stumped by at least one problem and get rejected. Like, many of these problems are harder than test questions in my Algorithms class. This is really disheartening especially when I thought I had a chance. \n\nIs the only solution to grind LeetCode? I’ve done about 3/4 of the Blind 75, but I don’t get how completing even hundreds of LeetCode problems can prepare me to answer *any* potential question I encounter in a test. I also feel like it’s kind of a waste of time to study LeetCode when it’s not very relevant to anything but job applications, but if that truly is the best solution and the only way to get a job, I’m willing to do it.\n\nI’m also wondering: if I can’t do these assessments based on what I’ve already learned and my previous practice, is CS actually the right career for me?

        "text": "I noticed a lot of new grads and students looking for jobs and internships have fairly weak projects. These projects are usually\n\n- School projects \n\n- Not hosted anywhere (no users, undemoable)\n\n- Using non-industry standard coding practices and frameworks (to be fair, college courses are never going to teach modern tech stacks)\n\n\nOf course, you dont need projects to land an internship or job (and lots of interns + juniors who work at big tech companies have no personal projects at all), but it will definitely help you\n\n1. During the interview process \n\n\t- For system design, you can dive deep into all layers of your work and confidently explain high level concepts with examples\n    \n\t- For behavioral, you will have an edge compared to other applicants when discussing about learning new technologies, overcoming difficulty, leading project development, simplifying workflows for customers, ...\n    \n\t- For leetcode, you will be able to write cleaner functions that are easier to understand, test and evaluate scalability and edge cases\n\n2. Not feel dumbfounded when onboarding and learning a new tech stack \n\n3. Understand what parts of web dev you like more (frontend, backend, devops, ...)\n\n\nFocus on 1 idea at the start\n\n- Dont overcomplicate your project with a ton of cool features you want to support, this is the easiest way to quit working on it after a week or so\n\n- It doesn't have to be revolutionary - all of the popular apps and services we use daily are pretty straightforward, e.g. reddit is just a forum, youtube is just a storage for videos, ...\n\n- For inspiration, check out some of the pretrained ML models on [tensorflow](https://tfhub.dev/) and [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/hub/research-models) (no ML knowledge needed to use these)\n\n\nBuild a simple service around your idea \n\n- E.g. lets say your making an English to Spanish voice translator \n\n- Make it easy to test and use (think about simplifying inputs and outputs)\n\n- Then wrap that logic behind a RESTful api interface - congratulations, you have built your first microservice!\n\n\nNext you want to build a frontend and backend \n\n- You can use any tech stack you want, but keep their codebases separate to avoid coupling \n    \n\t- React frontend, Express / Spring boot / Django backend is a great start \n\n- For the translation example above, we want the client to record or upload audio to a cloud managed object store, tell our backend to process it, then have our backend delegate that request to the processing microservice \n    \n\t- Create the concept of a \"user\" and track their info, media files and processing tasks in a SQL database \n\n\nThat's pretty much it! When it comes to personal projects, hiring managers care more about depth than breadth. Here are some starting points and topics for building on top of this\n\n- Unit / integration / e2e testing \n\n- Typescript \n\n- SSR vs CSR\n\n- Global state management \n\n- Responsive UI\n\n- Lazy loading\n\n- GraphQL vs REST\n\n- API gateway / reverse proxy configuration\n\n- Authentication middleware \n\n- JWT vs Oauth \n\n- User roles / authorization \n\n- Payment integrations (Stripe)\n\n- Understand design patterns used by your frameworks (MVC, DI)\n\n- Building on top of existing features (practice OOP and SOLID principles, inheritance vs composition, API migrations)\n\n- Making your backend stateless and horizontally scalable \n\n- Serverless - pros and cons\n\n- Caching (Redis)\n\n- Build features that use various types of SQL relationships\n\n- SQL vs NoSQL\n\n- CDN (Cloudflare)\n\n- Queues for processing tasks (SQS, rabbitMQ)\n\n- Containerization (Docker) \n\n- Container orchestration (Kubernetes, ECS)\n\n- Infrastructure security / zero trust\n\n- Service mesh and discovery \n\n- Monitoring / usage analytics / performance benchmarking \n\n- CICD pipelines \n\n- Automating infrastructure deployments and migrations (Terraform)",
