        "text": "\nCERN, which stands for  European Organization for Nuclear Research in English, [is a research organization that operates the largest particle physics laboratory in the world](https://home.cern/about). It is mostly know for the Large Hadron Collider, [which is a particle collider that  allow physicists to test the predictions of different theories of particle physics including measuring the properties of the Higgs boson and searching for the large family of new particles predicted by supersymmetric theories](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Large-Hadron-Collider). \n\n[CERN is financed by 21 member states, which each contribute various amounts totaling 1,240 million Swiss francs in 2013](https://voisins.cern/en/en-bref/who-funds-cerns-research). [In 2016, the budget was of 1127.2 million Swiss francs](https://press.cern/facts-and-figures/budget-overview). [The Large Hadron Collider took about a decade to construct, with a total cost of about $4.75 billion USD. Since turning on in 2008, the total cost of finding the Higgs boson has been about $13.25 billion USD](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2012/07/05/how-much-does-it-cost-to-find-a-higgs-boson/#7e28d07c3948).\n\nThe work CERN does is absolutely complex and requires a ton of money to finance. Regardless of if it does important work or not, should taxpayers be burdened with its finance? Would private money be a more beneficial financing method?\n\nThis question is something I came up with while spending some time in /r/space, where I asked [if space exploration should be taxpayer financed while there are so many homeless, shitty schools and crumbling infrastructure in the US](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/8p1bej/pew_research_72_of_americans_think_it_is/e08cn82/?context=3). I got a lot of responses by really defensive people and was downvoted, but I was wondering what you all thought of the question of financing CERN (and for that matter NASA if you're so inclined to engage).\n\nI think its an interesting question because there are currently privately financed space exploration projects going on, most famously [SpaceX](http://www.spacex.com/), [Blue Origin](https://www.blueorigin.com/) and [Virgin Galactic](https://www.virgingalactic.com/). They seemed to have a business model based on future commercial space flights, launching satellites and space colonization projects. The work CERN does doesn't seem, at least on the face of it, to have much of a commercial demand. At least not now (I could be wrong though).\n\nWith all of the inequality and poor government services that there is within the 21 member states ([poor healthcare services in the UK](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/18/nhs-care-among-worst-europe/) and the [rest of the EU for example](http://www.socialwatch.eu/wcm/access_to_health_services.html)), is there a practical reason why taxpayers should have to foot the bill?\n\nSo, thoughts? I am really curious what you guys think.\n",

        "text": "So this may be a stupid question but it really got into my mind on why people continue to play sports or some form of physical activity at all in today's world.\n\nToday's world with this current era of technology have made things so much easier like cars and other transport making travel easier and access to anything can be made by the touch of a button and also, the downside is that most technology of today like social media, video games and even movies, are dopamine-inducing creations where the brain, as smart is as it is, is still primitive in its own way as dopamine is basically the brain's way of hacking people's emotions or feelings to want more pleasurable activities like food or sex for the sake of survival.\n\nI am very much aware of the benefits of physical activity such as better concentration, lowering risks of potential diseases or disorders, lowing risks of depression and other mental disorders, as most of these feats can also be done by modern technology (maybe even better than physical activility) like medication, rTMS, and maybe even physical contact and human attachment.\n\nBut I am mostly asking from a more evolutionary perspective. Why do people, after all the advanced technologies, after the benefits (and downsides) of technology replacing the old ways and making us more sedentary, apart from all the health benefits of physical activity and apart from all the huge business benefits of sports competition and the tribalism involved when people watch their favourite teams, why do people still want to play sports?\n\nIs there a certain evolutionary benefit for the adrenaline that one feels during physical activity? Is there maybe a certain primitive desire behind the feeling of power and strength when you lift more weights as if you feel like you can conquer the world? Is there an evolutionary benefit that those who do physical activity still increase the possibility for better sex lives or better potential mates or even survival or social competitiveness (and I mean it from a more primitive context as social competitiveness like other animals do or the Neanthardals did is not exactly a phenomenon that exists in today's world except in some instances like warfare, politics and so on)\n\nIs there an evolutionary explained perspective? \n\nIs there a certain correlation between playing sports or physical activity and chances of survival (in both the ancient times and today's world)? \n\nIs there a certain between better mates or better life satisfaction in terms of income and social status, and physical activity? \n\nAre people who play sports are more competitive (and term \"competitive\" is also ambigious because there is the \"healthy\" term and the \"unhealthy\" term) or challenge seekers or seek challenges in more positive manners like personal growth or thrill or the having of flow or being in the zone?",

These  particles bounce and collide in all directions and on a large scale  produce the effects of pressure and heat transfer. If it was possible to  allow particles from one direction to pass a thin film, while the  particles in the other direction were blocked, in theory a net force on  the film would be produced. The energy would be taken from the air  molecules and so a proportional drop in the heat energy would be  observed as the pressure difference is created along the cross section  of the film.  \nHow far could you take this? Could you create a powerful  method of propulsion from sheets of the film? Possibly a flying vehicle  powered by the heat energy of air?   \n The idea is purely theoretical, since there is no practical way to create a material that the film could be composed of. ",
