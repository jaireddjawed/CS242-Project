        "text": "This was a couple months ago, but I never thought to post it here until now. I was taking a delivery on a stormy day to an RV park which required me to go about 5 miles down a highway. I get to the customer, drop off the pizza, and get ready to merge back onto the highway (it's literally off the highway, no on-ramp or anything, you just have to wait for a gap and floor it) when my car gives a bit of a shudder. I figured I was just having trouble with gaining traction for such a sudden acceleration due to the wet road and continued on my way.\n\nIt wasn't until about half a mile later that I noticed I had a large trail of exhaust coming from the back of my car- again no biggie, it's probably because it's a cold stormy day and I'm driving at highway speeds, I figure this is causing the exhaust to seem plentiful.\n\nI keep driving and notice I now have a smoke wall worthy of a spy movie following my car. I try to find a place to pull over, but the closest parking lots and off-ramp were still a couple miles away, so I end up pulling to the outside of the highway next to the guard rail and turn on my hazards. At this point a column of smoke/exhaust is rushing out from under my hood, so I pop it open and quickly realize I have no idea how cars work.\n\nI ring up my dad and tell him what happened, he runs me through some troubleshooting steps (all while I'm stuck on the highway, dangerously close to traffic) and I do my best to follow what he's saying. He finally tells me to check the radiator hose which I now discover is limp and sporting a giant gash: http://i.imgur.com/bIytadD.jpg\n\nI call the store and let them know what happened, they said to let them know if/when I fix my car (yeah, thanks guys...). So I try contacting some family that live nearby but no one answers their phone, and the only person I can get ahold of, my dad, is on the opposite side of the country.\n\nSo I stand on the side of the road, contemplating a tow service or trying to contact a friend that lives in a different city to come help me out, when a pickup truck pulls up behind my car. A man steps out and walks towards my car, asking me what's going on.\n\nI fill him in and he tells me that we should move my car somewhere that won't risk me getting rear ended (especially as I'd have the hood up and lose my knees if it happened). It turned out he was a mechanic that traveled around fixing industrial vehicles, and carried a variety of tools in his truck. He offers to use a tow-line on my car and hooks it up, then tells me to get in to my car and pop it into neutral. I get in, go to shift to neutral and-- nothing. I can't shift gears and it seems frozen in park. He tells me to start turn the key and try that-- nothing, not even lights. I realize I had been sitting there for so long that my battery died and apologized profusely to the guy. He says not to worry about it and to use the key in the gearbox to try and unlock it, which works.\n\nWe start to drive, he has his hazards on and I'm being dragged along behind him. We get to a small gravel turn-off and he starts to slow down-- only I now have no brakes, or very little stopping power. He notices this and gradually slows down, pulling along the side of the highway until we reach a further one, while I slowly crank on the e-brake (it's all I could think to do, and we were going about 10mph). We safely stop on the turn-off and I thank him for getting me to a better spot to work on the car. \n\nHe then offers to drive me to a parts store to pick up a new radiator hose. I couldn't get ahold of anyone else, and the store wasn't offering to send anyone to help me, so I figure why not. We drive to what I thought was a parts store, only to find out it's a closed mechanic, and he then has to drive me another 3 miles to the closest parts store. We get to the store, buy a new hose, radiator fluid, and jumper cables (he said he left his at home), and he then drives me back to my car and begins installing the hose.\n\nI standby, holding a flashlight as it's now getting dark, asking what he wants me to do to help (and undoubtedly annoying him with how little I know about cars), and within 20 minutes he has my new radiator hose installed and has jumped my car. \n\nAll together, he must have been helping me for close to an hour and a half, I'm amazed he stuck around after towing me, let alone helped me to get everything up and running again. I thank him profusely and give him $20 (all I had on me, I would have happily given him more) and we part ways. I got back to the store in one piece and finished out the night with my deliveries, all thanks to this guy stopping by to help a stranger. \n\n**TL;DR: Radiator hose blows up on highway, random mechanic stranger swoops in, tows me to safety, drives me to a parts store, and installs the new hose/jumps my car, spending almost 2 hours of his time to help me out**",

        "text": "So let me straight by saying that I love delivering pizza, it's a relaxing job and it gets me out the house and helps pays some bills and I have some petty cash on hand--it's nice and the people I work with are awesome. (granted I'm still new so maybe the scales haven't fallen from my eyes yet?) \n\nAnyway, I am about 30 minutes past my shift, we're short handed and I don't mind staying to help out. My last house of the evening the she ordered wings and a pizza requesting for Parm cheese and red peppers. I find her place, an apartment alllllll the way in the back.  Now here is the thing about this, the road isn't straight it is curved with the fences along the road not at all straight, one of them even has a tree stump in front of it.\n\nNo worries, I find it and she's stepping out. I go up to her, smiling as I deliver her pizza and wings, telling her that unfortunately our store is out of peppers but I have her cheese, I offer her as much as she wants and so far no biggie. She then wants to pay her tab of $25.15 with $40, I tell her, \"Okay let me see if I can get you the cash.\" (Lot of cash customers to night). Since it was 25.15 I rounded it up to 26 so I would only bring her back 14. I counted it at my car, but I accidentally double counted one of the bills so when I came back to her I only had 13, I quickly apologized when I realized my error, and said, \"Let me go that dollar for you,\" she snapped, \n\n\"You just owe me some change!\" To which I paused and asked, \n\n\"You paid with 40 right?'\n\n\"YES!\"\n\n\"Well I owe you another dollar, see I rounded it up.\"\n\n\"NO, you owe me change.\"\n\n\"Oh, change change, I'm sorry ma'am but we don't carry that on us.\" She then gets a little huffy and then gives me 3 dollars to which I thank her (because really I'm surprised) but I get in my car and start backing up. At that I hit the stump I mentioned before--and it sounds a lot worse than it is. I check and there is no damage to my car or the stump so it's all good. I pull forward this time and head back to the store, a little shaken because that scared the hell out of me and with her as my last customer, I'm done for the day.\n\nLo' and behold I get back to the store and one of my coworkers said that the lady I just delivered to is complaining about me. Saying that 1) I can't count change 2) Her pizza and wings were all messed up, upside down and everything (So much bs in that statement considering I protect that black bag of cholesterol like a small child in my front seat) 3) I hit her neighbor's fence and if there is property damage that they are coming after me personally. \n\nShe has been yelling at my manager for awhile, and my manager is done. She apologizes and says that they could give her a ten dollar credit to which the lady responds, \"I want the 10 in cash.\"\n\"I'm sorry but we can't do that. It doesn't work that way ma√°m.\"\n\"It will when I come down there.\" And she hangs up on my manager.\n\nSo I have to explain what happened and the manager lets me know that she'll have to let our store manager know and she and a co-worker told me not to worry that worse will happen is that I'll have to 'have a talking to' and watch a video on the computer, and probably have a ride along, otherwise I'm fine but...I can't help but feel stressed out by it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",

Every few days she brings in her doll, orders food, and sits down to eat. Usually she just eats, feeds the baby, and is on her way, or at least that's how much I see as a driver. Being the good employees that we are, we generally tolerate any of the weirdness that comes from strange customers. Her service doesn't suffer. However, she did something the other day that took all of my willpower to not laugh in her face for.\n\nI was returning from a delivery, walking back to the kitchen when I crossed paths with this woman, baby doll in hand. I step aside to let her pass, giving her a nod of acknowledgement. As she walks past me she turned the baby doll towards me and let out a loud squawk/shriek in my face. Wide eyed I cover my mouth, and quickly walk away. When I got back to the kitchen, I couldn't help myself but to crack up. It was easily one of the funniest moments of my job.",

        "text": "First time posting in this sub, so I hope I'm doing it right. I currently work for Pizza Hut. Last night, we had this lady put in an order for a large pizza. She lived a minute down the street. Within walking distance. So I was like, \"Cool, I'll be back in no time.\" I take her pizza to her, she gives me no tip, and I go back to the store.  \n\nThe phone goes off, and I pick it up. It's her complaining about how the pizza was raw in the middle. So we ended up making her a premium version of the pizza she originally had, put it through the oven once, took it out, and put it through half way again to make sure it wasn't raw. When we cut it, we also checked to see if it was raw. I take it to her again, come back, and she's on the phone with the manager complaining about how it's raw again and how she's going to \"come down there and give [us] a new one.\"  \n\nWell, about a few minutes later, she's in the store screaming to see the manager. He comes up and she starts yelling at him saying, \"This is the poorest excuse for a pizza shop in the neighborhood. I understand this is probably your first time being a manager or even making a pizza, but it's not hard to put sauce, cheese, and veggies on raw dough and put it through the oven.\" My manager, visibly irritated, says, \"Ma'am, I've been a manager here for five years. I've been making pizzas for longer than that. We put the second pizza through the oven one and a half times then checked it to make sure it wasn't raw. I don't know what else there is that we can do for you because the second, premium version of the pizza was not raw when we sent it back to you free of charge.\" She then proceeded to call the manager a \"Stupid fucking idiot\" and me the \"Sorriest delivery driver in the world because it took [me] more than ten minutes to get the pizza to a house that lives a minute away.\" I tried to explain to her that the oven takes nearly eight minutes to push a pizza all the way through but she just said, \"Yeah, whatever,\" and walked out. Definitely the craziest experience I've ever had with a customer ever. I always think about that encounter when I drive by her house secretly hoping that she'll never order again.",

One minute in the call with AS and Tom is already telling AS to stfu. \n\nI know you guys might say that it is inappropriate for a manager to swear to a customer but AS was not shutting up.\n\nTurns out his order of chicken wings dinner was missing BBQ sauce, coleslaw and the dinner rolls. (The other driver forgot the bag in the store.) This guy did not accept an apology, taking back the sauces nor free food. Seemed like he just wanted to yell over the phone and fight.\n\nAfter he threatens Tom and tells him he knows who he is, Tom then called him a b*tch and told AS to come and deal with his problem. Fast forward ten minutes. A huge guy comes in the door, and yells \"which one of y'all called me a b*tch\". I just looked behind me, and here Tom comes and confirms it was him. \n\nI'm not gonna lie I was ready to pick up the spatula behind me and smack this guy if anything was going down. But after the guy saw we were equipped with some muscular employees, he \"calmed\" down and started bullshitting how he can't eat his chicken without the sauce and that if he waited for the driver to go back the chicken would have gone cold. So he just sat quietly in the lobby, and waited for his wings with the sauce.\n\ntl;dr angry man calls back and wants to fight because driver forgot his BBQ sauce and coleslaw.",

I have been at my store for a couple years so I have gotten a pretty decent memory for regular customers, but my memory is often faulty in general so sometimes I question myself. \n\nAnyhow, about 10 minutes til close, I'm working the oven when I box a carryout order with a familiar name. Let's call him William McBoatface. I keep looking at the name and thinking \"I don't think I've ever seen this guy order carryout, but I've delivered to him late at night at &lt;insert address here&gt; a bunch of times.\" I wonder if he really is coming, should I call him to check, am I remembering correctly, overthinking the whole thing for a couple minutes while doing my work. The thing is, if he did want delivery it wasn't going to be possible very long after closing time and he would never get his food. By the time he noticed that he hadn't gotten his delivery and called the store everyone would be gone.\n\nFinally I decide to call him. First I check the order to see if it was called in or placed online (online, easy to accidentally hit carryout), then call his number. It goes right to voicemail so I figure his phone is off and just hang up. \n\nA few minutes later, 1 minute after close he calls back and caller ID shows his name. I'm so excited I sound like a total dork, but I answer with \"Thank you so much for calling us back!\"\n\nI explain the situation and he confirms that yes, he did intend to order delivery and I saved it!!! I pull his address out of my memory (he's not in the system at the new store yet) and he confirms it, another win. \n\nMy manager is standing right next to me and gives him free delivery bc it's too much of a pain in the butt to get his CC info and alter the order so I get to give him the good news. Next driver that's in takes it out with another order and all is well. \n\nI'm so glad I took a chance on trusting my brain. ",

She says she got an $80 tip. Wow!\n\nThe story is that she delivered to a place (a nice place) and the guy had paid with his card, so he signs the slip, but then tells her he has no cash for a tip (which is odd because the slip provides a tip line where the customer can write in the tip).\n\nHe then asks how much cash she has on her and produces a $100 bill. She says $20, because that's all we're supposed to carry as a bank. He then exchanges the $100 bill for her $20. So, in the end, she got an $80 tip.\n\nBonus fun fact: As she's going on and on about how happy she is and how excited she is, she says that she needs to pee, so she goes to the bathroom. While she's gone, one of the insiders comes into the office and asks who took the delivery to XYZ Lane because there was supposed to be a drink included and it wasn't delivered.\n\nYou guessed it...chick who just got the $80 tip forgot to bring the guy his 2-liter. So, when she finds out, now she's getting upset because she thinks he'll ask for the tip back. Manager had already clocked her out, tells her to leave the money in her cubby, just drive the soda out there, and if he asks, tell him it's at the store...\n\nI can't imagine the guy would ask for it back, and the driver said when he opened his wallet, it was full of $100 bills, but we'll see how all this turned out tomorrow.

I'm just wondering if it's possible to change my name in that system so that pervs have less prep time and the target painted on me as a female delivery driver is maybe a tad smaller.",

Took maybe 25 - 30 deliveries, but I only walked out with $66 because half of the deliveries I took were stiffs and most of the tips I got weren't much except for two $5 tips and one $7. And I burned $18 of gas so I only made it home with $48\n\nOn top of that we had to deal with a lot of drunks who were almost too drunk to even order. I almost got rear ended by one dude after I put my blinker on and slowed down to pull into a customers drive way. Dude driving an Escalade came within a few inches of destroying the back of the my vehicle, then has the nerve to blow his horn and flip me off as if it's my fault that he was following me way too closely.\n\nDespite all that however, I was bound and determined not to start 2017 off on the wrong side of the bed.  So after my last delivery, I just came back to the store, did all the dishes, and went home.\n\nI get that we have good days and bad days as far as tips go, but that was one hell of a bad day there.",

It was one I hadn't seen before, and I knew E Jonesy St didn't run continually on the hill so I try to map it before I head out. Google Maps and my native iPhone app both didn't show an exact building for that address and that street isn't a street at that location (it's a pedestrian stair path) but I knew it had to be somewhere near there so I head out. \n\nI have a saying about delivering to weird addresses: \"I'll find out when I get there!\"\n\nI arrive at 11th and E Jonesy St to find the aforementioned staircase, look at the houses on both sides to see the numbers and nope, they aren't the place I'm looking for. I turn on my cell phone flashlight and start down the staircase, hoping the house is accessible from it. \n\nI get half a block E and about 4 flights of stairs down to see a couple of houses nearby but unless I want to climb over a fence and trek through brambles I won't be reaching them. So back up to my car I go. \n\nThe next closest place to try is an alley between 11th and 12th aves that looks like it may go to the imaginary E Jones St house location. I drive up a couple blocks to the alley, go down it to the end and park by a dumpster. I see a building that may be what I'm looking for and follow a dark path around to the other side and it turns out to be townhouses marked in the 3200s so they would have addresses on 12th ave, but way off to one side, I see a rusty 1114 over the garage, locate the front door and ring the doorbell. I also notice the driveway to get into this tiny cluster of townhouses comes off 12th\n\nThis has made my run take probably 8 minutes longer than necessary, but mostly I am worried the customer would be annoyed by the wait. He opens the door and says \"Wow, I'm really surprised you found me! Most of the time I get a phone call.\" He's cheerful and tips lightly, wishing me a happy new year. (I don't call unless I have really no clue what I'm looking for because nobody ever seems to answer their phones, even when they tell us to call on arrival)\n\nThe more I think about it, the more irritated I am though. This guy knows he has a weird address, gets phone calls from delivery drivers almost every time, but doesn't toss us a bone for a clue on where his place is?!\n\nI know the character limit makes it a bit difficult, but a simple \"end of alley off E Other St is back of house\" or even better \"enter driveway from 12th, unit is to the right\" could have saved so many of us so much time! All the wasted freaking time of goodness knows how many delivery people from how many different companies that could have been prevented. Gah! \n\ntl;dr Dude has weird address off street that doesn't exist that no one can ever find but leaves \"delivery instructions\" field blank and just waits for you to call when you're lost. Wastes time, makes me mad. ",

Cool.. the people there are usually nice enough and we're most likely going to be delivering to people who work for TIPS another plus because you'd think they could relate. \n\nGo up to the back door of the place during the rush hour and knock loudly enough to where someone opens the door. I say that I have a delivery to a \"Michelle.\" The guy who opens the door disappears for a bit and Michelle shows up in a huff and asks, \"How much is it exactly?\" I give her the amount which ended up being like $19.45. She has a $20 dollar bill in her hand at this point. She says, \"Hold on, I'll be right back.\" \n\nShe vanishes into Denny's again for a bit and I'm out there waiting in the god damn cold for about 5-6 minutes. She finally comes out and gives me exact...fucking...change. Counting out the 45 cents very very slowly so I knew that I was getting stiffed. \n\nI have this idea after I get off of my shift. I ask my mother if she would like to go to Denny's since I don't get to see her too often and I didn't have shit else to do that night. So we go to Denny's and fuck it if we don't have Michelle as our waitress.\n\nWe got done with our food and at the end of the night as we get our check I count out 45 cents and give it to her as a tip after we pay for our food. Learn how to be a decent person. The look on her face was priceless. Geez. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObligatory: I know some people who I work with read this sub... So hi.\n\n",

Instead it was the same woman just blabbering that she's drunk and wants food but incapable of feeding herself. She sounds worse than before so I tell her to hold and look for my boss. I tell him what's happening in hopes he could help somehow. He gives me a sort of look like he'd rather not but I guess I had worried face so he was prepared to talk to her. Sadly she hung up.\n\nNever heard anything from her after that so I hope so she got the help she needed or at least went to sleep it off. \n\nHaving only worked here for about 6 months that's been the most interesting thing to happen.

Even though HE owns the franchise and pays our paychecks. Is this typical of all pizza chains, or even actually a rule for Marcos?\n\n2) our store also has a $2 delivery fee, but only $1 goes to us and the other to the store... Again, says it's \"marcos standard he can't give us the whole 2\" so when we get stiffed we only make a dollar. So, again is this standard to all pizza chains, ir even Marcos? Or is my boss just a snob?\n\nI wont be posting what city or whom I work for especially after reading the rules, but I've honestly considered calling corporate and asking them myself but I can't find a number for them.

Some of you will get flat tires and be left behind on the cold road. And some of you will even suffer the stiffness of an empty wallet.\n\nHowever, others of you will succeed. You will be tipped extremely well by intoxicated patrons. You may be invited back to a party after work. And some of you, just maybe, will be invited into a nice warm house by a beautiful woman/handsome man who is all alone at midnight.\n\nIn order to maximize your chances of survival, I present the following tips (pun intended). Please feel free to reply with your own as we're all in this together:\n\nExpect it to be rough. Go into work with the mindset that you will have a stressful night.\n\nPractice defensive driving always. No matter how many PSAs the cops put out stating that they are \"cracking down this year\", people are still going to drive drunk. Be especially vigilant.\n\nBe prepared to deal with drunks accordingly. As mentioned above, there will be many, and while some may be jolly and merry, others may be ready to fight because \"you didn't give me the right change\" or \"this ain't what I ordered.\" Be as patient as possible.\n\nHelp out your crew. Everyone is going to be stressed to the max, so help out where you can and try to be the best team player you can be. It will still be chaos, but by working together, you can help to mitigate that chaos.\n\nIf you don't have a flashlight, get a flashlight.\n\nExpect big orders. People will be having parties. This is your time to shine. Have jokes ready, be ready to have quick conversations. This can maximize tips. Be cool with everyone.\n\nStop relying solely on GPS. While GPS can get you into the area of where you need to be, it will burn you from time to time, and there is nothing worse than being 15 minutes away from the store in the middle of nowhere and the GPS is telling you to turn onto XYZ St and there's nothing but a field on either side. Look at a map before you leave, or better yet, get a map for your vehicle.\n\nFor those of you working until or through midnight, I will be there in spirit and solidarity with you. May we all start the New Year off right with lots and lots of great tips! Happy New Year!",

I don't care what anyone says with regards to race, if a black man/woman answers the door your tip will be the change left over after the break the bill and that's it.

These are relatively short roads and do connect to areas I would consider \"bad\", but the houses are middle class/working class type places for the most part. Nothing exciting, nothing completely ghetto.\n\nI will say this to ALL drivers...consider concealed carry. I personally feel much more secure knowing I have a gun on my person. As I've mentioned in other threads, you can have the money, you can have the product...however, you are NOT forcing me into a home or vehicle and you are not taking my car. It's the only one we have. But, most importantly, I have a family that I'm going home to at the end of the night. That's where I draw the line and is the only reason I would use deadly force.\n\nOur store policy is no concealed carry (and yes, I do have a CCP), but after last night's robbery, we were basically told, off the record, that we are encouraged to carry protection without consequence. I have been doing this from the beginning, because the worst the store can do is fire me...the worst someone on the street can do is kill me. I'll take my chances on losing the job.\n\nAnyway, just a reality check for everyone out there...\n\nAnd before you ask, yes, we have put both roads on the Do Not Deliver list (along with over 170 others after dark). I even mentioned to the GM about blocking that whole section/neighborhood region, but he pointed out that we already have over 170 streets blocked. At some point, we would lose entire swaths over an incident (and just to clarify...it's not like we've had over 170 robberies. In most cases, it's just that the store just blocked streets after dark that are known for crime, according to police reports and common sense).\n\nPlease do your best to be safe out there. I don't care what your store policy is...if a situation looks/feels shady and your gut tells you something is not right, just leave the area.\n\nOh, and also, make your cash drops! The driver who got robbed last night had thankfully just dropped over $100, but she still lost $51 to the robber, which included her bank. This means she had to pay $31 to the store at the end of the night. It only takes a few seconds to drop your cash when returning from a delivery, and she could have been owing a lot more. Sucks she ended up owning anything, but still...make your drops after each delivery...and if at all possible, keep your personal money at home or at the store. Keeping it on you in a wallet/purse can lead to even further financial stress after a robbery.\n\nAgain, stay safe and vigilant. Most people don't realize how many different areas we delivery drivers end up in, and just because you live in a nice area and we deliver doesn't mean our next run will be to someone pointing a gun in our face.",

NYS Minimum wage is currently $9/hr and I'm making $7.50 with no reimbursement from my employer for mileage. 100% of credit card tips I make are taken by the State.\n(Some context for my issues below)\n We hire 3 different positions here; \nManagers (The only ones that actually make food)\nCutline (General in house. Dishes, phones, taking calzones out of the oven, taking customers up front, etc.) Who make $9/hr and get tips from the tip jar up front\nDrivers (Do everything Cutline does plus delivery) that only make $7.50 and get tips from customers on location. \n\nFrom my perspective, the drivers here really get fucked. We do everything that Cutline workers do plus delivery and make $1.50 less and get 0 reimbursement for miles. I know that drivers most likely make more in tips but we also have a ton of other shit to pay for like gas, maintenance, tickets (if you try to meet the standards of the business' delivery schedule), and whatever else may occur to their vehicle/persons while out delivering. Drivers are also required to place a very very large advertising sign on their vehicles that have now scratched the hell out of the paint on my car. \nDoes anyone else think I'm getting completely screwed here? I feel like I'm really getting it raw from the owners and I'm not too enthusiastic about it.\n\nSecond issue is tax related and I think this is all federal based so there won't be a State tax code barrier here. I've been logging my miles as best as possible and plan on claiming them as a tax deduction. From what I understand it's just .54 per mile so X miles times 54 cents and that's what I have potential to be reimbursed by the government?\n\nSorry for the completely shit format, I don't post on forums much and I'm also somewhat drunk.

        "text": "So I work for a fairly successful, but relatively small, locally owned pizza chain in the greater Pittsburgh area. That shouldn't give away too much. At our particular store, we are located about 3 or so storefronts away from another popular local pizza shop. Last Friday, the week before Festivus, I may or may not have started a war between the two.\n\nIn between the two stores there is a street with a 4 spot loading zone for us. Unfortunately, many rude people like to take those spots because they don't want to pay for parking to shop or are too lazy to park in the parking lot across the street. That street connects to an alley way running parallel to the main road, and a hill up to the suburbs. As I was coming down the hill, I stop behind a vehicle at  the stop sign. They do not move, and I inch forward. They do not move, and I inch forward again. Frustrated I drive past, honking (he waves -_-), and I flip him the middle finger and go park my car in the lot because all of our spots are taken.\n\nReturning to the shop I head to the back of the dining area to the employee area and remove my heavy jackets and get ready to go into the kitchen. Up walks this 45-50ish, 5'5\"ish, portly Syrian man who comes up, points a finger in my face, and says in his thick accent \"You give me bad finger!\"\n\nAt first I was startled. Who is this guy, and why is he up in my face? Was he the one I just flipped off? I suppose so. Realizing who it was I get defensive and stand my ground. \"Yeah, I did. You were parked illegally. You can't do that.\" Got him.\n\nMy manager walks by, delivering food to a table, and without even stopping telling him he needs to leave.\n\n\"You think I was parked? I was not parked, I was waiting for someone,\" he says back to me, still angry. I wasn't having any of it. If I have to pay to park when it's busy, so do they. \"I'm sorry that you were offended,\" I say, \"but that doesn't make you were doing less illegal.\"  \n\nMy boss, now frustrated that this guy in here causing trouble with his employees in the middle of the lunch rush, comes back saying \"We don't come into your store and cause trouble, now get out.\"\n\nIt was a surreal morning, but the very next day that I went into work (two days later), there was a glove sitting near our front door. Just one glove. It was sitting up and had the middle finger raised. Now we have no proof is was the other shop, but we take a little solace in thinking it was them. ",

Came in at 3pm, closed at 8pm, scheduled to be out by 8:30pm, didn't leave until 9:30pm. Actually, there weren't that many deliveries, but in-store was just nuts (and I have to help on makeline, cut table etc.)\n\n\nFrom about 4:30 till close, it was pretty much non-stop, with easily 15 pizzas on the makeline at any given moment. In total, I probably took about 10 deliveries in five hours, but the amount of carryouts was bonkers. Of course, when I got back from my last delivery, I still had closing duties, meaning I got out an hour late because of last minute orders.\n\nJust wondering how everyone else's Christmas Eve went.\n\n\nBonus fun story of the day: So, I believe my first delivery was to a street that we don't deliver to after dark. It has a north side and a south side. We don't deliver to either one after dark. So, I actually end up answering the phone and take the guy's order. He's from Yonkers and is visiting the south.\n\n\nI get the delivery and ended up on the south side of the street when I needed to be on the north side. I call him and he can't give me directions or landmarks. I finally figure it out, deliver the pizza, he's cool, we chat about NY for a minute, and I'm done.\n\n\nI get home tonight after a tiring shift and look forward to lighting a fire and spending some time with my wife since the baby is asleep (we rarely get time alone together these days.)\n\n\nSo, then, the phone rings and I recognize the number as the NY guy because its distinctive. I figure a butt dial or something. Let it go. Then it rings again. Same number. I answer and explain that I'm the pizza guy (I had to call him to get some directions earlier.) He then apologizes and says he thought it was his other friend \"Savage\" who is also white (the customer dude is black).\n\n\nAfter I tell him I'm the pizza guy from earlier, he asks if I'm off and then says he's partying and asks if I'm partying tonight. I tell him I'm hanging out with the wife tonight, knowing he's about to say, \"Why don't you come down to Get-Yourself-Robbed-and-Killed-Avenue and hang out?\"\n\nSo, the call ended amicably, but he did try to call back on more time about five minutes later. I just declined at that point. Not sure what was up, and I'm glad about that.",

And this location delivers all day long not just for the late morning and evening like the other place where I worked. I have half a year of delivery experience under my belt. \n\nI'm hoping that this will mean more tips once they decide to let me drive. It will suck if I'm just here for an in store position, especially since I applied for driver. \n\nBut I'm a bit curious. The last two pizza places where I worked had me start out as a driver. I did two or three days of trips with more experienced drivers to first start out and then one or two days in the kitchen. So it was about a week in store training for me before they put me in the driver's seat. \n\nHas anyone else experienced this, and if so, how long was it before the company said you could drive? I'm actually glad that I got the job at this location instead of a different pizza chain because I heard that it takes even longer at other locations to become a driver. \n\nIs it that they want to make sure you won't slack off when you're driving and the in store experience is what will show them that you're serious about driving for them? Just curious what everyone else has experienced when it comes to waiting for being put in the driver's seat for pizza places. \n",

I'll give you another $10 if you can spit a dope rhyme.\"\n\nAnother guy offers $5 on top of that, I kind of smiled and said \"...fuck...\"\n\nThe guy says \"just a couple bars!\"\n\nOne of the girls goes to grab her phone to record and the guy tells her no, that's too much pressure but she's already on her way. \n\nI say \"ok, but one of y'all has to beatbox for me.\"\n\nThey agree, a couple of them come and stand next to me while the girl starts recording on her phone. \n\nThe 2 guys start up the beat, so here comes my turn. \n\n\"These people making me spit, a Christmas rhyme...

        "text": "Just thought I'd share this experience from tonight for any customers out there who read this sub and sometimes wonder if their tipping habits have any effect on how quickly they get their food.\n\nTL;DR -- They do, at least sometimes (especially when things are mostly equal between the two deliveries and its up to the driver to decide which to take first).\n\nWe were quite busy for a Thursday night and a few orders were starting to go late (at my store, this means the computer estimates they will be delivered in more than 35 minutes after taking driving time into account).\n\nI was waiting to take a double to the edge of our delivery area, a poorly spaced out double to be honest (at the request of my GM), but unfortunately the second order was slower coming out of the oven than normal and the first order went late (then the second went late a few seconds later before I could check out on both of them).\n\nSo, I set out with \"Smith Ave\" (about 6 miles Southwest from our store) and \"White Street\" (also about 6 miles from our store, but more to the South).\n\nBoth orders were placed at almost the same time (I think White Street was placed at 6:58pm and Smith Ave was placed at 6:57pm). They both were somewhat spaced out and not convenient to drive to/from, so it didn't really make any more sense to take one over the other except for the difference in when they were placed. However....\n\nWhite Street had pretipped $3, while Smith Ave had pretipped $2. This one dollar difference in tips, small though it was, tilted the scales in favor of me delivering White Street first.\n\nIf the tips had been equal, I would have taken Smith Ave first because it was placed 1 minute earlier than White Street, but an extra dollar from White Street compared to Smith Ave meant White Street got their food about five minutes earlier than Smith Ave.\n\nMaybe it's unclear in how I explain it, but hopefully it can illustrate how even a single dollar more in a tip can make a difference when it comes to delivery time. It doesn't always work that way, but it does happen, so I just thought I'd share a real example of how even a minor difference in tip amount leads to better customer service for one customer over the customer who tipped just a bit less.\n\nFWIW, I still got Smith Ave their order in under 40 minutes and White Street got theirs in just over 45 minutes (both orders still nice and hot). I know some people might not care, but this is just one example of how the amount that you tip can and does make a difference in how quickly you will receive your order.",

I offered to help, and the money never hurts. This was 100% the head managers fault for not scheduling enough drivers. \nCome this week (happened tonight) I was scheduled 10:45-10. The longest shift I've seen was a 10:45-8, but that was for a driver with a special case. 8 hours into my shift it slows down and I ask if I can head home. He asks me what my schedule says and that I need to stay until then. I proceed to start telling him how that doesn't sound legal. He sends me home and then when I'm logging off he says \"You can stay home tomorrow and rest up\" in the tone which the words sound nice, but everyone knows it's an attitude. \n\nWhat's been your longest shift? + stories :)\n\nSorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile, and this is my first post!",

Anyways I stand there kind of telling the guy it's not cool but also wanting to get my tip and leave so I was a little nicer than i should have been about it, just gave the food and left. As soon as I got back in my car I took a picture and a video for evidence. The bite itself is not that bad, I don't believe it broke the skin as I wasn't bleeding. However two days later the bite area is starting to turn slightly purple and I believe this is probably bruising. However, on the page that it is possibly infected,what should my course of action to be with this situation? I am going to fill out an incident report at work in a few hours. My manager has been filled in on the situation and ive given her pictures of the bite and the customers information. At the moment im not pursuing compensation. Im really unsure what to do here.

        "text": "Here are a few from last night...\n\nCase #1: I get back from a run and one of the other drivers asks, \"So, did you hear about the fake GM?\" I'm confused. Our GM did get sacked the other day, and the DM brought in the new GM to see the store and introduce himself. So, I'm thinking that this driver is talking about the new GM.\n\nAnyway, he explains that, while I was gone, a black guy comes in (the actual new GM is white), talks to people at the front, then proceeds to walk behind the counter and address the manager on duty by name in the office. He says he's the new GM and starts asking about different employees by name. The MOD is kinda' freaked out because, once again, we were introduced to the new GM by the DM the night before, and this guy is not wearing any company garb\n\nDude eventually leaves, but now the MOD is making all kinds of phone calls to try to figure out what's going on. Turns out, the guy was the husband of one of our drivers and was playing a prank.\n\nCase #2: Three cop cars pull up, lights going and all in front of the shop. Guy gets arrested in the parking lot. Driver comes in all pissed off because no one called her to let her know the cops were out front because she was smoking weed or something. Starts yelling, apparently high. She was half joking, but I'm like...c'mon.\n\nCase #3: At 11:55pm, some woman comes in holding some sort of...I don't know...like, a plush pink and white bag or something. She asks for Erin, but there's no Erin at our store. She then says that she talked with someone on Facebook about selling whatever it was in her hands. She said that the person said she worked at PJ's and that we close at 11pm (we close at 12am on Saturdays).\n\nWe explain that there is no one employed here by that name, so she goes and gets her phone to show a picture of the person. I had a delivery, so I didn't get to stick around to see, but my manager said that the picture was not of anyone who worked at our store. The woman looked strung out and apparently began apologizing over and over for wasting time. Who knows, dude...who knows.",

Of course it's walking distance away from the pizza place too! I go there on my way back and the kid opens the door. I see another man inside who I assume is the lady on the phones husband.

        "text": "Northern Midwest locale. I'm a shift manager, not a driver. We haven't been taking out of town deliveries for the past 3 weekends due to snowy weather. Most of our out of town deliveries are at least 5 miles from the store, up to 10 miles for a couple of gated communities.\n\nEmergency services make a big deal of announcing every year before a major snowstorm that unless it's an actual, life-threatening emergency, they won't be going out to tow stuck cars. If you get stuck, you're on your own until the roads are cleared.\n\nWe have online ordering and unfortunately there's no way to turn off just out of towns, so I was having to call them back and ask if they wanted to do pick up instead. I was also dealing with the assholes who wouldn't take no for an answer when they called in, so they wanted to speak to a manager (yay me). As you can imagine, responses were mostly, \"Oh, I'll try somewhere else then,\" or, \"Well that sucks.\"\n\nI did have one guy say something like, \"Tell your manager to hire people with cars outfitted for bad weather, because I want pizza.\" Then laughed like he made the BEST JOKE EVER. Idk what people think the drivers get paid, but it's not that much, dude...\n\nAnother customer complained because she didn't have any food in her house and didn't want to drag her kids out. This wasn't a surprise storm lady, it's been all over everything for a week. You had time to stock up...\n\nAnother customer was cussing (mostly to whoever else was with her) because we wouldn't deliver to her, and how it was such bullshit that we wouldn't deliver because of some snow. I super nicely asked her if she wanted to change her order to a pickup, and she said, \"Hell no, I ain't going out in that!\"\n\nA few people promised a \"big tip\" if we'd make an exception. Actual quote from one of my drivers on that one: \"Unless they put a $20 tip on the credit card right now, when they order, there's no way. Even then, it depends on how far.\"\n\nOur delivery times tonight were up to an hour and a half at one point, and we were pretty much giving customers our best estimate along with \"we can't be certain because of road conditions right now.\" One guy (in town) called and got pissed about our times, because he wanted his order in a half hour for delivery. Like, have you looked outside?? Our STANDARD delivery time starts at 30 minutes. Even if we had NO deliveries, it'd still be at minimum, 50 minutes to your location. To his credit, he came and picked up his order, then complained about the roads. And still complained about our delivery time.\n\nMy closing driver tonight basically said that he didn't feel safe driving any longer because of how bad the snow was coming down and how it was melting and refreezing against his windshield as he's driving(windchill was in the -10s F at that point). Snow was drifting badly, and it was after 10pm (close at 11:30), so we weren't going to get much business anyway. He's a good worker and pretty reasonable, so I knew he wasn't just trying to get out early - plus he stayed to finish all his closing crap too before he left.\n\nI told a customer that we weren't taking any more deliveries for the night because my driver had car trouble  (it's a hell of a lot easier to say that... less questions). \"You didn't get anyone else to come in and finish his shift?\" On a Saturday, an hour before close, with crazy drifting snow and negative temps... no. Me being a nice manager said, \"No sir, no one was available, I'm sorry. Would you like to do a pickup instead?\" Him: \"Fuck no I don't want a pickup!\" Hangs up while cussing me out to whoever he was with.\n\nAnd lastly, a good story. An online order popped up from one of our farther out of town locales, so I had to call. The lady was super nice about it, and cancelled the order. Two minutes later, she called back and said they'd changed their mind, they're going to come pick it up. When she got there, I thanked her and gave her a couple of coupons for free appetizers. She asked why, and I told her, \"For being so understanding. I've been declining out of town deliveries for 3 weekends in a row, and not everyone is quite as understanding. And you still wanted your order, and drove to us instead in this weather. So thank you.\" She thanked me for the coupons and left with a huge smile on her face.\n\nWhen she left, I noticed that she had given the girl who cashed her order out a $4 tip too (I talked to her just after she paid). That's pretty rare for pickup orders. You might say, why couldn't she have just done pickup in the first place, but come on, delivery thrives off of people who don't want to drive themselves. And after 3 weekends of crap like this? I kind of wanted to kiss anyone with a positive attitude.\n\n**Tl;dr - shitty weather, lots of bad customer responses, and one super awesome customer that prevented my faith in humans from crumbling entirely.**\n\nEdited to add that our drivers get $1.50 commission for in town, and  $2.50 for out of town, no matter what, even if it's one of those 10 mile deliveries. Definitely not worth it when the roads are bad...",

        "text": "The latest installment of \"People are jerks and need to knock it off!\"\n\nWe stop delivery at midnight on Friday and Saturday. It's in the 20s outside and now windy and sleeting. I finish a run around 11:40 and figure I'll now have time to work on dishes and clean the back so I can get out of there at a relatively decent hour. Oh, and our GM was fired and replaced today.\n\nSure enough, 11:52 rolls around, order in. Ugh! Ok, fine. I look at the map and it's close by. In fact, it's in my neighborhood. I don't have a fancy house by any means, but many of the houses in the neighborhood are fancy and the owners tip well.\n\nI figure I'll be in and out, it'll take 10 minutes and I'll get a good tip to end the night. Wrong!\n\nFirst, even though I know the neighborhood and the road the house is on, I can't for the life of me find it. Then the house numbers start getting off and GPS is up to her normal lying ways. It turns out that the road goes around a curve, and on the curve is a road that goes off to the right. So this was not a tradition T-shaped intersection. Suddenly, the house numbers jump from 1900s to 1100s. I'm like WTF?\n\nI drive back and realize that the house I'm looking for is the house on the corner of this curve/road split and that the road I'm on was the split. The house actually faces the other road, not the road I'm on. Anyway, it's a huge house, nicely manicured, professional landscaping and lighting, brick exterior, the works. I breathe a sigh of relief. I'll get a good tip, get back, finish up, go home and relax. Wrong!\n\nI get out, knock on the door. Sit for 20 seconds. Nothing. I now ring the doorbell. A dog starts flipping out inside. 30 seconds goes by. Keep in mind, again, the cold, windy rain I'm standing in.\n\nI knock again, this time as hard as I can without sounding like I'm pounding on the door. Dog still losing his shit, I can hear a little boy inside telling the dog to be quiet and can hear the TV going. WTF is going on here? Obviously people are in there, and I've now knocked/rang three times. Oh, and the one time I left the printout with the customer's number on it would be this run.\n\nI begin walking around the front of the house to see if I can find a window to verify that humans are actually in there. I've now been standing out there for over two minutes. Finally, a kid who looked to be about 6 or 7 opens the door (it's now after midnight...you should have been in bed hours ago!)\n\nI hand him the pizza and he starts to walk off. I asked him if his mom was around to sign the slip. He then proceeds to start yelling for his mom, who I think was in the kitchen about 10 feet away (why didn't you answer the door, mom? I could have been a child kidnapping murderer!)\n\nShe meanders over to the door, doesn't say anything, takes the slip inside and leans down to write on it. She takes her sweet ass time, but I'm figuring that because she's taking so long, maybe she's doing the math for a nice tip. She hands it back, I thank her and leave. I never look at the slip until I'm in the car and down the road because I don't want people to think I'm expecting a tip (I am).\n\nI think you all know the way this story ends. On top of getting stiffed on the last run of the night from a customer who obvisouly was not broke, I ended up being at the shop until 1:10am.",

        "text": "You know the type customer I'm talking about. The dreaded customer who calls for delivery when they're not home, or tries to run an errand and beat the driver back? Well, I had one tonight.\n\nUsually, no big deal. Annoying, but it's bound to happen. I've done this job so long, that I don't even get exasperated by customer's stupidity, or even ask myself, \"What were they thinking?\" anymore when this happens. \n\nTonight was different,  though. \n\nI'm in Northern New England. We are in the deep freeze. Temperatures topped out today at about 8F. Then the sun went down. \n\nAnyway, I was going into my peak dinner rush. I had seven pending deliveries. I notice that one of the addresses is a house that has become a regular customer. I usually go there with $50 orders at least one per week. \n\nI remember this address because they always tip well, and they've become regulars.  I remember that two weeks ago, the last time they ordered, I got there really late. We'd been slammed that night.  I couldn't keep up. Because of this, I made a mental note to bump their order ahead in line the next time they ordered.\n\nWell, tonight they should have been delivery four, out of seven. I could tell it was going to be another long wait for them if I took their order in the que.\n\nTrying to be a kick ass driver, I bumped them up. Dropped off the first run, and then hauled ass to their house.   Knocked three times. Progressively louder each time. Then called, only to get voicemail. All while freezing in the bitter wind and cold. \n\nI had orders in the car and things were cranking at the store. I couldn't wait any longer. I'd spent seven minutes at this address and needed to get underway to the next.  Called and got no answer. Left a voicemail.\n\nMiraculously, I got all my other orders delivered in reasonable time. Finally, I get back to the store. As expected, the customer has called looking for their food.  They're told it will be remade and come right back out. \n\nBy the time I got the food there, two hours  and forty five minutes hours has gone by since I first arrived with the their order 23 minutes after it had been placed.\n\nThe customer comes to the door. She wasn't pissy, but you could tell she was irritated with the situation.    I apologize for the long wait. She then tells me that they told her it would be 45 minutes to an hour, and that she'd called to place the order on the drive home from work! ( we never quote less then 45 minutes, even if it will be 15. Better to be early than late)\n\nI explained, or tried, that that is just an estimate. It could be more or less. It's never a good idea to try to beat the delivery guy! \n\nShe's not happy with this reply. I explain again...This time, I ask her to please, please wait to get home when you place an order. \n\n  She replies, \"That's hard with hungry kids who want to eat! I was trying to save time, and the guy on the phone said it would be at least an hour!\" \n\nI didn't argue with her. Just ran her card, expecting no tip, but I got $6, so it wasn't a complete loss. \n\nO.k., I get it. Your kids are brats and they can't wait during dinner rush on a cold Friday night when everybody else also wants delivery. In your plan to save time, you got your order almost three hours after you placed it. I made sure your food got cold as hell in the meantime.  I took it for a ride, stopped for gas and coffee before I delivered it, remade (which they shouldn't have done to begin with, but hey, I don't run the place. I just deliver).\n\nSometimes I ask myself, why do I even bother to try? Damned if I do, damned if I don't!\n\n\n\n\n\n",
