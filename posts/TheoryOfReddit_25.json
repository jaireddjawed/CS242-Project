In that time it has made the front page a few times.\n/r/wholesomememes started as extremely, well, wholesome.\nNow, I am wondering whether the following is just a subjective perception or whether there has been a real change happening.\nWhen that subreddit started, there were mostly a 100% (seemingly) wholesome memes and comments and it seemed to have been a true wholesome community. \nHowever, since it grew so fast in numbers a sort of inflation happened. \nThe front page of that subreddit contains many memes that are obviously ironic and comment sections are filled with usual memes (it's over 9000 etc.) and sarcastic text comments.\nDid it grow so fast, that the spirit of community couldn't adapt and is getting lost?\nLooking forward to reading your thoughts.",

        "text": "So, first of all: alt because I don't want my account to be called out for whatever some people would call me because of this 'investigation' of mine. Trust me, if somehow this results in the scam I'm referring to being made impossible, I would gladly take credit with my real account.\n\nWe all know vote manipulation is illegal on this site. I believe, however, that I have uncovered a new type of manipulation on Reddit. This is the tactic the users involved follow:\n\n- User Y pages 'famous' user (say X) in a completely irrelevant way in a thread that is becoming popular underneath a top post\n- This allows X to make an off-topic comment, which he gathers a great amount of karma from, because he is a) 'famous', b) people like 'famous' people answering to pagings\n\nNow, inherently we would say that there is no mistake on behalf of user X, after all he is only responding to the calls being made and therefore isn't even off topic. Now, my question. \n\nIf I was able to prove that this X was NOT being called by random users, but by users Y1,Y2,Y3,... while he controls them calling it, would that change the story for you guys? Because if this is the case, he's branching off-topic responding to accounts controlled by him and hence deliberately manipulating the discussion. This is deteriorate to the quality of popular Reddit threads to me, as it goes against the natural flow of commenting.\n\nHow would I ever prove this?\n\n- The Ys are always the same ones, all of them paging X and only X multiple times\n- Irrelevant threads, mentioned above\n\nNow, you could just think: okay, these are fanboys, no biggie. Follow along...\n\n- Response time is hyperfast: very rarely above 5 minutes/no response at all, sometimes below 30 seconds. Ever got a user mentioning you? Trust me, you will *never* respond that fast, and certainly not if the thing you are posting is some copypasta (which happens)\n\nThis, in my opinion, at least reveals that it is a coordinated action, which is manipulation in itself in my opinion. \n\nBut then, there's something else...\n\n- At around the same time, Y1,Y2,... all changed from paging as /u/X to paging as u/X.\n\nThis is hardly 'evidence', but it indicates that this is one and the same user, controlling multiple accounts to branch a discussion off-topic, come in with his main account, make a low-effort comment that will get upvoted not because it contributes but because it is X, while avoiding he is the one branching off-topic and getting the hate.\n\nNow, in this *hypothetical* [;)] situation, is there anything to be done about this? Is this manipulation to you as well, or am I just oblivious to the fact that this somehow **does** contribute to Reddit's quality?\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts!\n\nEdit: \n\nSome examples (fictional to not refer to anyone, but accurate) to show what we're talking about:\n\n- Post about movies, two comments in the top comment are about Star Wars. Y1 responds: \"u/X, seen any movies tonight?\" to which X either responds with a post about a random movie, or with a simple \"snappy\" reply to put Y1 in place. People upvote because of user name and I'm not sure whether this set-up where X and Y1 are one and the same person isn't manipulation.\n\n- Random post, two comments in top comment Y1 says again: \"u/X, thoughts?\", X responds with \"Mind your own business\" or something like that. Again, hijacking highly visible places while not even contributing anything to what that thread and comment thread is about.\n\nIf this was all organic I wouldn't give a fuck, but it's simply not. If admins could verify and confirm, would they do anything? This is in my opinion not much better than upvoting one's own comments.\n\n**UPDATE**: I've now been following it a bit more closely, all the pagings he responded to are from those same users, branching off-topic and X giving a 'relevant and funny' response to the set-up, sometimes a long comment in about 40 seconds since it was posted. It's on days like these that Reddit's policy with as few rules as possible might not be able to tackle all manipulation.\n",

        "text": "I was thinking about memes that we constantly see on Reddit. Not just the pictures but also the text-\"jokes\". Are they funny? Some are but mostly it's just a repetition. Constant repetition. So, is constant repetition actually funny? Is the joke funny the 100th time around? Not really.\n\n[This is how I see the \"laugh\" they are supposed to create by seeing a meme together.](https://images.gr-assets.com/hostedimages/1455395313ra/18097631.gif)\n\nIt's not a natural laugh. It's being in a group and having something in common and therefore also having fun together. It's creation of a culture. It can be a flag, national song, clothes or a internet meme. It's a similar thing. It creates a bond. So the meme is supposed to be easy to recognize and recreate but is supposed to be for the ingroup. So it has to be unique and special too. When you post it you don't just think \"please laugh and smile\", you also think \"please recognize me as being part of the group - because I am showing that I understand and respect your culture and am showing that I can relax and have fun with you\".\n\nExamples:\n\nr/The_Donald is doing it right. I am not a Republican, I actually dislike GOP, but I still feel pulled towards the sub because it looks like people have a lot of fun there and are caring for ingroup members. It makes me change my political views a bit just to fit into a fun group. And to fit in you also have to attack outgroups. So do illustrate that you are willing to fight for your ingroup. Use words/attack-memes such as cuck, SWJ, feminazi and libtard.\n\nOn r/Denmark we have the \"Sweden sucks\"-meme. No one actually dislikes Sweden. We all love the country and its people. But we still need something to bond our group together. And as we are not a warmongoring country and don't like to be called haters we make a funny-meme out of the attack-meme.\n\nThen there is r/politics or dry science subs. They don't have the same memes and jokes that makes me part of their ingroup in the same way. They don't feel like fun, they just feel informative or sometimes even indoctrinating. That's right, a dry but informative sub can feel more indoctrinating than a fun and relaxed sub made for the purpose of being indoctrinating. When you relax you are open to new ideas. Of course if you visit a sub/group enough times even the lack of jokes/memes won't stop the creation of an ingroup. Obama had memes I liked and supported: \"Yes we can\", \"Change we can believe in\". They didn't feel funny but they still felt like ingroup memes. So it's not like I am saying only one political side can create effective memes.\n\nSo my point is. If your sub does not have any kind of meme that is repeated, random people won't come there to feel like part of the group or to feel good. They will come there for information and leave again not feeling different than before. They will be a bit more intelligent though. People want to be part of a good group. They feel lonely without it. Even though I do dislike seeing the same joke 100 times I do understand one of its purposes.",

No more will you be left in the dark about which threads are REALLY popular based on where everyone is spending their time commenting.  No more will you be unable to search and find other comments, explore subreddits you never knew existed and have to hunt around for the info you're looking for. \n\nI give you the beginning of an ambitious project:  http://search.pushshift.io  -- totally free of charge, no ads, no bullshit.  \n\nThis is just an alpha and a proof of concept that already has some functionality.  Soon you'll be able to do whatever you want when it comes to Reddit. \n\nPlease feel free to play around and offer suggestions.  I have tried to make it mobile friendly -- but there is still much work to be done.  I'll need your feedback and opinions if this will eventually be the best tool out there for reddit.\n\nThanks!\n\nhttp://search.pushshift.io\n\n**Notice**\n\nPlease make sure you only open one window at a time for this.  It does make calls to Reddit's API every couple of seconds and if you open more than one window, it will start making more calls than necessary.  Eventually I'll find a better method to cache responses from Reddit through my API.\n\n**Update**\n\n*2016-12-21 11:00:00 ET*\n\nTonight I fixed a couple bugs and revamped how comments are displayed.  I decided not to throw comments out all at once but to buffer them and display them in a more rhythmic fashion to make it easier to follow.  When the comments get backed up more, the speed increases to keep them going.  I've tried to balance the variable amount of times between comments to pad it out so that they're easier to follow.  Also, when hovering over the comments, it will stop updating in case you want to read one more carefully. Let me know what you think.",

It surely must have been prominent enough, as /r/enoughlibertarianspam was created four years ago as a counter to it.\n\nFour years later and we see a different mindset. Many posts hitting the front page are more critical of capitalism (or crony capitalism for more specificity) and subs such as /r/latestagecapitalism, /r/socialism, and /r/fullcommunism have made their presence well-known. Bernie Sanders, the antithesis of Ron Paul, became reddit's well-loved candidate; who also shared socialist tendencies. \n\nI guess the question is: what caused this drastic shift over a period of a few years? I understand the front page of reddit isn't representative of reddit users as a whole, but I still find it fascinating these two opposite beliefs have been embraced in such a way.",

So I figured it's best to post it here, or in /r/mildlyinteresting, lol. \n\n----------------------\n\nYesterday morning I woke up to see that the front-page of /r/bodyweightfitness had changed dramatically compared to the previous evening.  This is what it looked like: https://i.imgur.com/e4njT2a.png\n\n**Notice anything that's out of place? If you're familiar with reddit, you'd probably catch it.**\n\n-------------------\n\nWell, I'll tell you because I have not witnessed anything like this before on this subreddit or Reddit in general. \n\n1. /u/Tykato posted a self post for his video and it got a couple hundred upvotes early on but then /u/gregoryscottfit posted a self post as well and it took over which was not unexpected or impossible because it was about push ups and push ups are a very popular topic in the fitness world but it was still impressive because Tykato had a strong footing and it surpassed him. \n\n2. But that wasn't the surprising part. The astonishment came when I woke up this morning to find NEITHER of their posts were in the #1 position anymore even though 24 hours had not passed! \n\n* Historically, when a post gets a couple hundred upvotes on a medium sized sub such as this, it will tend to stay in the #1 for 24 hours *straight* but now we got a new post by /u/naturally_stronger with not even 60 upvotes and it knocked down both Tykato and Gregory Scotts posts down!\n\nI'm guessing this is the results of the recent algorithm changes to appeal to the users who wanted their front page to look fresh every few hours rather than having to wait until tomorrow to see blue links.  \n\nWith this increased turn over rate for the top position, this makes posts even more competitive.\n\nIt boggles my mind how lucky you have to be to get to the top position of a massive sub such as /r/videos with 13 million subscribers. To give you an idea of how competitive r/videos is...[My video on how to do push ups got 9000+ points on /r/videos](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3f0t2n/heres_a_video_i_made_to_help_you_do_push_ups/?ref=search_posts) and *it never even made the #1 position.* It was mostly in the #3-5 position and then got shuffled down. And that was a year ago well before any of these algorithm changes.  It's kind of bizarre, because now you see \"points\" in the tens of thousands nowadays.  Everything is skewed.\n\nThe good news is that our front page will look different in just half a day, we will get to see more content, but we will potentially miss good content faster as well if we don't visit reddit for a day.\n\nAnyway just wanted to share some random ramblings of things I observe. I'm sure there was an announcement detailing how this works in detail but I must've missed it.  ",

Two other posts reached 1.2k and 1k upvotes respectively. The remaining posts got about 100 upvotes combined.\n\nI barely spent a couple of minutes on imgurs front page to get these images. Although they load pages with scroll now, i dont think i went beyond page 2.\n\nIm sharing this because its interesting to me how easy it is to get karma just reposting stuff off imgur within a span of ten minutes. I'm pretty confident i can reach 100k if i spend a day karmawhoring. But its pretty pointless cuz they are just internet points afterall. \n\nI also have another entire post, a much deeper and important one, on what i dislike about reddit as i spend more time on it. Some things, mechanisms, behaviour patterns that you dont realize as a new user and how easy it is to manipulate both image as well as comment posts. But maybe ill write that some other day. ",

There continues to be a few \"sublevels\" of comments, diminishing in size the further down you scroll, until reaching the end of the children from the 1st comment.\n\nIt seems as though this pattern for which comments are displayed is always followed in big comment subs like r/askreddit. However, a lot of comments are simply NOT worth displaying- yet because they're a 2nd level comment, and according to this algorithm a 2nd level comment MUST be displayed to fulfill the \"pattern\". For example:\n\n1st comment: (funny reference to earlier AskReddit post) +3000\n\n2nd level reply: \"2META2FAST\" +300\n\nSeem familiar?\n\nThe \"need\" for the sorting algorithm to display a certain number of comments per top comment results in content like this being visible- when in reality we don't need any replies to be visible.

Each sentence is rated positive, negative, and neutral.  It was no surprise to me that /r/EnoughTrumpSpam, /r/The_Donald, /r/conspiracy, /r/trashy and /r/watchpeopledie were rated negatively.  However, I was surprised to find /r/thenetherlands, /r/legaladvice and a few others rated negatively.\n\nThe most positive subreddits like /r/MakeupAddiction, /r/MechanicalKeyboards, and /r/Python were no surprise.\n\nAnyway, please enjoy the data.  \n\nPM me if you want me to add any special subreddits added.\n\nView results here: [opfeels.com](http://opfeels.com)\n\nEDIT: I have removed /r/thenetherlands. Vader doesn't like dutch. They use the word \"die\" too much. =)\n",

That way, trends in subscriber statistics become more noticeable.\n\nIn the most recent version I noticed an oddity. \n\n[This is the graph](http://i.imgur.com/QoOnKR9.png). \n\nNote how there's a sudden change of momentum for almost all subreddits on October 16th.\n\nIt's most pronounced for /r/IAmA where the negative trend was reversed. /r/worldnews went from relative stagnation to relative growth. /r/science went the other way round. So did /r/todayilearned. /r/AskReddit starting growing even faster, /r/pics started declining even faster and /r/funny went from stagnation to a slight relative decline.\n\nSince it affects all major default subreddits in non-linear ways, I guess the root cause is something the admins did to default selection for new users, possibly as part of an A/B experiment.\n\n[Last time I noticed an oddity](https://np.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/4d46ud/was_rannouncements_temporarily_undefaulted_in_a/) it turned out to be a bug, so this might be another possible root cause.",

For many posts, it's going to go up. Here are some other facts:  \n- [Karma is not changing](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/5goxk4/upcoming_change_to_vote_scores/datxu1x/), since it's calculated separately  \n- [Vote totals still aren't (upvotes - downvotes)](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/5goxk4/upcoming_change_to_vote_scores/datypwz/), but are a much better reflection thereof.  \n- [This change is retroactive](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/5goxk4/upcoming_change_to_vote_scores/datyd2p/).  \n[More detail will be added in the official announcement.](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/5goxk4/upcoming_change_to_vote_scores/datyql4/)\n\nSo this isn't a groundshaking change, but it's significant: the vote adjuster has been part of Reddit for a long time.\n\nPeople in the /r/ModNews thread are already discussing some implications.  \n- Score adjustments of political posts have been alleged to be part of a conspiracy, and this change will give less credence to that idea.  \n- People will be less confused about the mechanics of Reddit.  \n- Will this mean that /all/top will be a more accurate measurement of the most popular content on Reddit?\n\nAlso, was the old score adjusting code effective at hindering spammers? Do you think this is a good change?",

        "text": "For the past several years, there's been a pretty clear rightward shift in Reddit's political discourse. The Reddit community, which has really been truly progressive, was once known for its staunch \"liberal except for issues concerning women and minorities\" attitude. Over the past few years (certainly since Gamergate), this consensus has been replaced by a kind of pluralism in which right-wing voices have become normal. This transition is [pretty well-documented](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/4unhzd/did_something_cause_reddits_swing_from_more_sjw/). The rise of /r/t_d seems to have also brought in huge amounts of new \"alt right\" posters, whose political views regularly bleed into other subs.\n\nBut now, I'm wondering if the pendulum has begun to swing back in the other direction. Let's take a very brief look at political subreddits. After the titan that is /r/t_d and the still-active /r/sandersforpresident, the most popular sub dedicated to a particular tendency seems to be /r/socialism, at 73,000 members. Though clearly dwarfed by the two candidate communities, this sub has [grown pretty steadily](http://redditmetrics.com/r/socialism) over the past couple years. Its low-effort counterpart /r/latestagecapitalism has [exploded](http://redditmetrics.com/r/LateStageCapitalism) in its less-than two year lifespan, regularly hitting /r/all and leading to constant mod headaches as perplexed centrists proclaim their misgivings about socialism in the comment section. \n\nInterestingly, Reddit has no real \"safe space\" for center-left posters. /r/hillaryclinton never took off, and although the users of /r/politics were staunchly anti-Trump, their views were substantially more progressive than those of most Democrats. Weirdly enough, communists seem to be a lot more prominent on Reddit than self-described liberals.\n\nIs Reddit actually experiencing a legitimate shift to the left? Or has the destruction of its former liberal consensus just allowed far-left voices to be more easily heard? Could the rise of socialist discussion be indicative of some kind of broader trend among typical Reddit users, or are Reddit users just flocking to the far left because there are no established centers for center-left discussion?",
