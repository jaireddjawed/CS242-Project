Be it friends, entertainments, or even simple dislikes, it all goes away and becomes something you long for again. So easy to retrieve again in some cases, yet so undesirable regardless if you miss it or not. The childhood spark as I call it. \nI really wish I could go back to my childhood days, perhaps 10 years old. I remember getting on Xbox One, playing CoD and Minecraft etc. \nIt all felt so simple back then. So mind sparklingly fun in a way that drives your brain and gives you memories you long wish to get drunk over again. The many online people you’ve met but will never see again. The pain of growing up and staring at your games and the progress made in it. Minecraft hits the hardest, seeing all the builds and progress in ways that you know will be forever frozen in time (talking to you especially, community worlds). \nI miss the old days of stores and restaurants that were so fun and simple, before they cheaped out everything. I miss the days when people cared. When it felt like the world was set on serving us and our desires (how it felt like all the toys and entertainment were made to relate to us). Cartoons that we once saw but will never get again. The cartoons which now seem more relatable to us as adults the more we get into context, as if they left those messages for us to know in the future. \nI hate the fact that, somewhere along the way, the majority our generation fell down hill and turned into some pieces of shit that can’t think straight. It feels like nothing is even real anymore. I feel like I’m stuck on an ever moving conveyer belt where nothing is as fun or engaging as they used to be. 2017 and beyond don’t feel real. Nothing feels the same. \nI want to go back sometimes. Maybe if I could get some things I use today back then as well, I’d gladly go back.  \n\n-Some guy with a nostalgia rant to be heard",

        "text": "Mods please feel free to delete this if this type of post isn't allowed.\n\nRecently I've been diving pretty heavy into early-late 2000s, or \"golden age,\" Disney channel content, and with sites like nickreboot, toondisneyreboot, etc, I've never come across a strictly original Disney channel related channel (Yes, I know a lot of these shows are available on D+ but it just hits different in slightly lower quality and with all the original bumpers and commercials.) \n\nIn all of my failed attempts to locate such a medium, I have created my own channel using cytube compiled from a lot of files I have found on internet archive. It's about 65 1/2 hours worth of content (Even Stevens, Lizzie McGuire, That's So Raven, DCOMs, &amp; more) that runs on a constant loop. If no one is actively watching then it will freeze at its current timeframe and resume when someone tunes back in.\n\nOverall it took me about a night and some change to get everything set up and would still like to figure out how to add a banner amongst other things to make the page feel more inviting, but it's live and functioning. I've been wanting to share this with people who might actually appreciate it and couldn't think of a better place to post it than here.\n\n[https://cytu.be/r/DCReboot](https://cytu.be/r/DCReboot)\n\n**Sidenote**: Cytube is weird when it comes to mobile users depending on the video source, but I've got it working perfectly for on the go consumption.",
