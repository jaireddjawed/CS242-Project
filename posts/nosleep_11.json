        "text": "You know that small, obscure café inside of every hospital that serves mediocre at best coffee, cold and hard pastries, and only has one table inside the entirety of it that is dirtier than a literal junkyard? Well, I work there. \n\nThe hospital I work at had a weird ass architect, the guy put things that normally would go together (like an operating room next to the emergency room) in complete opposite corners of the hospital, while things that should be far apart (like a church and a morgue) right next to each other. The café, “Cafe Mocha” (not an original name, I’m aware) is directly across from the church. No problem with that, except for the fact that next to the church is the morgue. And across from the morgue, and next to the café, is the daycare center. \n\nCustomers will start eating their food inside the café and literally puke it out onto the floor when the body of a motorcyclist cut in half by a truck roll by on a gurney, or a grieving widow will walk out of the church and run right into the body of her husband who died of cancer. Or, a toddler will ask the daycare attendant, “Why is there an arm sticking out of that bag on that rollie-thing?” \n\nIt sucks seeing the tragic stories of death roll by into the morgue every day, but I’ve learned to deal with it. Unlike the usual, yesterday was calm. Few customers, but not many, came by ordering miscellaneous things, until eventually 10:00 PM came by.  \n\nMy routine goes as so, I turn off the machines, throw away the pastries we didn’t sell, collect the tips and split them between me and Nancy (my coworker, but she was sick all week), turn off the lights, and shut the big metal roller door to lock up. \n\nI’m normally out of the hospital by 10:15 PM, but as I was walking toward the exit to the hallway, I heard someone yell out from inside the daycare center. \n\nI turned to my left and saw Lisa trying to quell the anger of some child screaming his lungs out. \n\nLisas was overworked. Simple as that, she was almost constantly stressed, and eventually her employer made her go on a vacation to cool off. Lisa’s kind though and is great with children. Out of everyone I know in the hospital, she’s probably my best work friend. The first day we met, she ordered a frappuccino and I completely messed up her order, and ended up spilling it all over her blouse. She still uses that against me to this day. \n\n“Charlie, take a deep breath with me, alright?” \n\n“NO! I DON’T WANNA, WHERE’S MY MOM!” \n\nThe screaming was... concerning, but I walked in any way to see if I could help. \n\n“Hey, bud, why don’t you play with this for a while.” I said, handing the kid having a hissy fit on the floor my cell phone, already loaded up with Candy Crush. \n\nThe boy on the floor, probably five or six, had fluffy brown hair, a pair of dark blue jeans, and a mint hoodie on grabbed my phone from my hand, and his attention immediately was absorbed into the screen. \n\n“Thanks, Aiden.” Lisa said, giving a small smile. \n\nNormally Lisa would have two other attendants helping her out, but it seemed they had left already, leaving her with the brat on the floor. I felt a bad for her, the girl had been left with a literal demon having a temper tantrum that looked like a seizure. \n\n“Hey, you want me to just... chill with you in here while you wait for the kids parents?” I offered. \n\n“Seriously? Oh, thanks Aiden.” Lisa smiled, normally she was stressed by the kids and always looked panicked, but the quick flash of happiness that flew across her face made my heart light up. \n\nWe both sat down on opposite sides of the small waiting room to the daycare, and just talked. It was nice hearing about her vacation she’d had recently, and how her home renovation project she was doing herself was going well. She chose “eggshell white” for the bathroom. We were quickly interrupted, however. \n\nPastor Samuel burst into the room, a bit of an annoyed look on his face. \n\n“Lisa, I know how hard you work every day, but I beg of you, please keep the children's crying to a minimum. There’s a woman who just lost her child in the church, and I don’t need this reminding her of her child every second.” \n\nPastor Samuel was older, probably fifty or sixty, but it wasn’t like his hearing was that bad. The kid, now sitting on a couch in the daycare, hadn’t been crying for ten or fifteen minutes. He just continually played Candy Crush, giggling whenever he won. Sort of cute, definitely the opposite of what he had just been doing. \n\n“Sorry about that earlier, but we calmed him down a while ago.” Lisa replied awkwardly. \n\n“I could hear the crying from in here just a second ago, same with the mother.” Pastor Samuel didn’t seem to budge on the idea of someone crying, he seemed slightly agitated. \n\nPastor Samuel was a kind man, he volunteered at different organizations every weekend, a food bank was even started in his name. It wasn’t like him to get so angry, however, when it came to any member of his congregation, he didn’t take any bull. \n\n“Pastor Samuel, I promise you that there’s only one child in here, and he hasn’t cried once since... 10:10 PM.  \n\n“I checked the time exactly when the crying started, it was at 10:14 PM.” Pastor Samuel wasn’t going to let this go. \n\n“Listen, I-” Lisa was interrupted by the sudden screaming and crying of someone. \n\nLisa groaned, got up from her chair, and walked into the nursery, but stopped. \n\nI followed behind her and saw Charlie sitting on the couch with my phone in his hand perfectly content, yet the crying continued. \n\nI turned back and faced Pastor Samuel; he seemed perplexed as well. \n\n“Is he the only child inside the daycare?” he asked, looking into the daycare. \n\n“Yeah, his parents were supposed to pick him up an hour ago, and noone else was registered all day.” Lisa replied, a bit anxious, holding her arm. \n\nThe crying got louder, and we turned to the door opposite to the bright, and cheery daycare, themed with rainbow. The door to the morgue was open just a hair, and the crying seemed to be coming from there. I walked out the daycare and to the small door with the words above it in bold, “MORGUE.” \n\nI looked behind me, and there was Pastor Samuel looking over my shoulder at the door. Lisa was in the doorway to the daycare, holding Charlie’s hand, in his other hand my phone, he probably got bored of the same Candy Crush level I’d been stuck on since August. \n\nSuddenly, the doors to the church burst open, and Ms. Cheng ran to Pastor Samuel, silently crying, not the source to whatever was wailing. \n\nMs. Cheng immigrated from China when she was seven, as I’ve been told an infinite number of times. Ms. Cheng was a regular at the café, ever since her son went into a coma after suffering a seizure at school. She sat at the end of his bed every Saturday since 2018, waiting for some sort of sign he might wake up. Her husband had died a while back, so he was all she really had. The staff of the hospital, doctors, nurses, even the janitorial staff knew her by heart, and we treated her like family. Literally. She brought dumplings to the staff's Christmas party last year. I knew something was wrong when she didn’t order her usual latte today, and I’d heard rumors from other doctors her son had died in the night. This confirmed those rumors. \n\n“What... what is that wretched noise.” She said, sniffling and wiping her eyes as she did so, holding a bible in her right hand. \n\nIf five people standing next to the morgue wasn’t enough, Mr. Flores walked in with a pair of cheap knock off AirPods, quietly whistling to himself. He was mopping the floors and staring at the ground, but looked up once his eyeline met my shoes. He didn’t take out the airpods, and just gave a quick wave, before turning back and shutting the metal gate that divided the small hallway and the rest of the hospital. He locked the door and turned back behind him still seeing us, and finally took out one of the earbuds. \n\n“Uh. What you doing here still?” He asked in broken English, confused to the number of people outside the morgue, until the sound of the crying hit his ears. \n\nMr. Flores had worked at the hospital longer than I had worked there. He’s the head janitor at the hospital, yet even in his position he still insists on cleaning the area’s most people don’t want to (mainly being the hallway I work in). He’s also in charge of locking up each night, which is probably what he was doing until the crying interrupted him. I don’t normally see him at night, because I’m usually long gone by the time he arrives. \n\nAs soon as he heard the crying, Mr. Flores got the message, and quickly looked at all of us. He looked concerned and took out a big ring of keys and walked in front of me. Nudging me aside, he opened the door to the morgue, and stepped inside. Surprisingly, next to enter was Ms. Cheng, the morbid curiosity of what the noise was must have gotten ahold of her. I walked in next, and Pastor Samuel followed quickly behind. Lisa stood in the doorway of the morgue still holding Charlie’s hand. \n\nMs. Cheng looked around for a second, all of us still in complete silence, and pointed at one of the small doors in the wall of freezers that kept the bodies cold. \n\n“Is... noise coming from freezer?” Mr. Flores asked, yet we all knew the answer to that. \n\nI looked around the room, and while the noise was concerning, I was surprised how no one even seemed to have noticed the body on the gurney in the middle of the room, covered by a thin grey sheet. \n\nI turned back to the freezer, and now Pastor Samuel was directly in front of it, reaching a hand out, but stopped himself. \n\n“This is wrong. This must be some sort of prank. We should not disturb the dead.” Pastor Samuel proclaimed, taking a few steps back from the freezer and accidentally stepping on a lab coat and shoe behind him, strewn across the floor. \n\nThe crying continued, but it seemed to get quieter, like it knew we could hear it, and decided to put less energy into the wailing. Mr. Flores shook his head. \n\n“Sick prank, people are messed up in the head.” Mrs. Cheng crossed her arms, walking out of the morgue, essentially pushing Lisa aside, and Pastor Samuel power walked behind her. \n\nSuddenly, Lisa yelled. \n\n“Charlie!” \n\nCharlie had suddenly run ahead, giggling, somehow gotten out of Lisa’s grip on his hand, and pushed Mr. Flores before stopping straight in front of the freezer and grabbing the handle to which the noise was coming out of. \n\n“Charlie, stop!” I yelled, but we knew what was about to happen. \n\nThe little brat pulled the handle downward. \n\nThe door to the freezer sprung open, and the bed that slid in and out of the freezer’s “drawer” like system barreled out, hitting Charlie square in the forehead, causing him to fall over. \n\nThe crying coming from the freezer was quickly replaced with Charlie’s, and Lisa ran toward him, horrified by the very small injury the child has sustained. \n\n“CHARLIE! Oh, my goodness, oh my goodness, are you alright? Where does it h-” Lisa stopped, looking down at the drawer that had come out of the freezer.  \n\nOn top of the table was Mr. Andrews. \n\nMr. Andrews was a bright man, even though he was constantly put through depressing situations, he never let that keep him down. He always was smiling and bought a ham and cheese sandwich every single day from the café. He wasn’t a patient, however. He was the coroner. \n\nMr. Andrews had a scalpel in the left side of his chest, the torn flesh was able to be seen near the area of the wound, his face was frozen with a horrified look, and the tie and flannel shirt he wore every day was stained with blood. The glasses he wore had a crack in the right frame, and one of his shoes was missing. Mr. Andrews was supposed to be in the morgue, but he was not supposed to be dead. Judging by the looks of him, the death had been recent, but not recent enough to be the source of his crying. \n\n“BANG!” \n\nSuddenly, the door to the morgue closed shut, locking, leaving me with a daycare attendant, a janitor, and an injured brat with the body of a murdered man. \n\nThe screaming and crying didn’t stop, though.",

        "text": "Alright so, this is gonna sound crazy. And, I'll admit. I might just be stupid. But y'all need to explain to me.\n\nThis happened a couple years ago. I was at a party, one of my friends was hosting it. I'm just chilling, getting something to drink. My friend, we'll call him Steve. He was pretty cool. I was hanging out with him, drinking, and eating a lot of flamin' hot chips.\n\nNow, I don't have too high standards for my ladies. If she's got a pretty face, and a somewhat skinny figure, she's hot to me. Mostly worried about personality more. But, the girl I saw at that party? Hot, hot hot. I mean HOT. Gorgeous. Absolutely the most beautiful thing my eyes have ever seen.\n\nI mean, she was pretty damn hot! Like, I'm pretty confident in myself. I believe that I could easily pull most single girls, even the more above-average ones in terms of looks. But this girl? I almost just assumed she had a boyfriend, and if she didn't, I thought for sure I wouldn't be able to pull her.\n\nOkay. So, I'm staring at this girl, right? And she is just so epic. And, as I'm staring at her, I get the feeling she looks at me a couple times. Like, we even grinned at each other some. And I'm thinking, \"Woah, this is crazy!\" \n\nSo, when things are settling down a little bit, I notice she is standing alone over there. So I go over to talk to her. \n\nShe sees me coming, and she is just grinning at me so much. It's that cute, in love with someone kind-of grin, y'know? So I go up and start a conversation with her.\n\nAnd I'm talking to this girl. And it's epic. And I think we can tell we are both into each other. I'm making it known, too. Like I'm saying shit like \"I mean, you looking so hot today...\" Or something like that. So I ask her to go on a date with me!\n\nShe says yes. Now, I need you to understand how I'm feeling right now. This hot, smoking hot, once in a very long while kinda girl is going on a date with me. My mind is racing. So, I kinda brushed it off when she didn't give me any socials. She didn't give me her number, or social media, or anything. Just told me where to meet her and all that juice.\n\nI don't really make a big deal out of it. I'm like, \"Hey, I'm lucky to be in this situation, right?\" So, I go out with her the next day. And it's not anything crazy, like we just go to this cool restaurant, and its not too crazy or nothin. \n\nWe talk for a while, eat some food, and it's pretty cool. And then like, she asks me to come over to her house. And woah, that's crazy to me.\n\nLike, if I could explain the feeling I was getting, in this moment. This hot lady was inviting me to her little house. Like, damn, am I that hot or something?\n\nSo, I drive her over there. It's pretty cool. And we get to her house, and she's like, let's just watch some Netflix and stuff right? Okay, so I watch Netflix with this hottie.\n\nAnd it's pretty epic. Like, she's clearly making moves on me, and I'm just enjoying the moment. But then, she turns off the movie. And then invites me upstairs. I'm like, \"This is insane! Woah!\" And so guess what?\n\nWe go to her room. And we do stuff. It was awesome.\n\nAnd I'm really attracted to this lil female her, okay? Like, this was not a one-n-done thing for me. I definitely wanna get into a relationship! \n\nOkay, so I sleep with her. That's cool. But this is where things start getting a little trippy.\n\nI woke up the next morning and realized one thing immediately: This chick was gone. Whoosh. Spoof. Disappeared.\n\nSo, I'm assuming she probably got up, right? Wrong. I go downstairs, looking for her. Absolutely no one. \n\nAnd then, this woman, who at the time I assumed was a sibling or something, (maybe mom?) Came down from upstairs, just got up kinda thing. And she sees me, and she is scared! Like she is screaming, asking who I am, and demands me to leave.\n\nI'm scared now. I get out of there and get in my car, drive off as fast as I can. Cause I'm scared I'm about to go to jail or smth. \n\nOkay. I get back home. I'm a little confused. But it's all chill. First thing I do? Realize I never got that girls number or anything really to contact her with.\n\nSo I go to my friend! Steve! And I call him like dude, invited any hot chicks to that party?\n\nSteve? Yeah, totally clueless. He didn't invite more than a couple chicks to that party, and neither match my description. Crazy.\n\nSo I look up this woman's name instead. And, I find nothing. Absolutely nothing. \n\nSo now I think I'm tripping. We ask everybody who was at the party, and everyone is claiming that I am insane. I don't know what to do. And I'm kinda sad actually. I thought I might have a chance at dating that girl.\n\nOkay, so fast forward. Why does this matter at all, Happyman? Did you just tell us a weird story just to do it?\n\nYes. But also no. See, this woman I was talking about now seems to be stalking me.\n\nI might just be going crazy. But I keep thinking I'm seeing her pop up in random places. Just seemingly at random. And I'm like, spooked.\n\nIt's only happened 2-3 times that I've thought I've seen her. So I guess I'm just tripping or smth. Whatever.",

        "text": "First of all, let me get something straight: This thing named scary story will have real things and fiction thing. I know that all of this things need to be real, but I don't want that THING read this and think that I am I.\n\nI just, don't want to die.\n\nGreat. All I need is that him/her/it read this and kill me, fake a note and I would die. I just need it in a place that is not closer to me.\n\nOther thing, I'm gonna writing in English for first time and every grammar error is for that, I talk Spanish and that's not my native language. Expect me writing strange things.\n\nThere a few reasons of why I wrote this:\n\n1. I feel better when I wrote.\n\n2. I told this story to a bunch of persons, friends, teachers, my father and they don't believe me, why your brother and a demon will be the same? I don't ever freaking know, I just want my brother back, I just want someone who believe in me and don't say sarcastic things about it.\n\n3. I know that I would die and I don't want to don't be remembered when I die  (It's such an stupid nightmare, I know).\n\n4. I want to write this, no I need to write this.\n\n5. I just need to thing logical.\n\n6. I don't know, I know that there's a reason why but I don't know how to explain.\n\nThanks for read this.\n\nBut this is not the ending. I know that you have a lot of interesting things that you have to do that don't evolve a young woman saying 'I know' 'I don't know' and don't going at the point. I appreciate your time reading this a lot.\n\n*hit, I'm crying.\n\nAnd I don't will go to the point right now so you can don't read this part:\n\nI hate to cry.\n\nI cry for everything and I hate it, a lot of morons named classmates says \"Hanna are you ok\" \"Hanna stop crying\" Please, if I cry isn't because I want to cry, if I wanted to cry I don't will do it in your moron face.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nI'm sorry that you have read all this words and I'm not going to the point.\n\nThat thing is not my older brother.\n\nThat monster demon or whatever is not my brother.\n\nIf I just was a brave and strong person I would encourage him and ask: Why? \n\nWhy he don't want that I have my brother?\n\nWhy does he hate me?\n\nWhy are you against me?\n\nWhat I have done you?\n\nI hate to cry.\n\nCry doesn't do anything, that scary thing will not give you your brother if you cry and cry is as useless that the useless. Useless and cry are the equal.\n\nI know that if that/him/her/it watch this I would not live to tell you that. But sometimes I just want that this thing read this and answer my questions, as in my dreams.  But: Cry =useless=Dream. Everything has sense, right?\n\nAll my family are marvelous person's and I'm not marvelous, I'm useless, how it/him/that/her says.\n\nI just cry, dream, tremble, scratch my arms because I don't want to cut my arms and draw that is also useless as he/it/her/that says.\n\nDraw will not give you money, draw will don't save you for any situation and say your problems on the internet is also useless.\n\nThanks to read this, again. I'm not going to the point and I promised that I would go to the point.\n\nI'm Hannah.\n\nI know that my older brother and a monster change places. He's just nos himself, for a long 6 years or even more.\n\nMonster is good acting, pretend to be my brother (a nice brother) when someone is in front of us and break my bones when nobody see.\n\nBut monster is not a totally monster, if he was a totally monster he would kill me, like it/him/her do  to my mom and in another universe our mom. She was a nice lady, a poisoned nice lady.\n\nI read some scary stories to know in what thing I need to begin and is the beginning of this. This is the beginning of he story.\n\n\nMonster knows that I like to draw, specially girls with a bunch of colors. And I drew our family, all of we. What an enormous painted draw with all of us, the dog, my mom, my  older brother, my oldest brother, my dad. \n\n\"Give me that.\"\n\nAnd he just take the paint and break it, he break it. The paint lol like confetti and my mind just don't  was useful in this moment because my mind is not useful, is useless. Don't say that my mind is useful, it that shut was useful why do I can't do anything? I am just useless, useless and useless.\n\n\nAnd suddenly I was crying, and that's not new, I cry for everything. For everything and I hate to cry. I like to see, to watch, to read but I would cut my eyes if that mean to never ever in my life cry for everything.\n\nThe second time I was reading a novel: \"For my derelict lover\" it was the type of novel that you don't expect to be NSFW because in a looooooot of chapters the main character just were like \"I can hold your hand, please?\" And then in the chapter 96, they fuck. There is not problem, I'll just don't read that part and there's when my brother enter.\n\n\"What useless thing are you watching?\" He took my computer and with him useful angry face look the story. \"96 chapters.\" He murmured.\n\nAnd then my face was in front of the computer. The small letters look like big letters and the text said all that f*cking things. And then my foots were above the floor and in my neck were to hands \"Two cuts with scissors in your foot for every chapter that you have been reading. You are not even my sister. My sister is useful and she don't read all this s*it.\" At least both though the same, that monster/useless is not my brother/sister.\n\nThanks for read. \n\nI'm  really sorry for waste your time.\n\nThere were a lot of scary brother but I just say two of them, it was at least 35 scary brother and I couldn't write it, this is just the 7 of 7 drafts of this story. I'm sorry.",

        "text": "My family is as to close to perfect as you can imagine. We’re well-off, exceptionally loving and supportive, conventionally attractive, musically talented, and totally free of drama and strife. It’s like if the family from Beaver to Cleaver were hip and modern. \n\nI was the youngest and the last in the house after my siblings left for college. My parents loved to turn on home movies when all of us were together again for holidays. They truly reflected our upbringing. You’d never see us arguing in the videos, not even amongst the kids. Siblings fight, but we didn’t. There was nothing but smiles and laughter — just as I remembered it. \n\nThe night after this most recent Christmas I was stricken with an unusual bout of insomnia. I’d never before had trouble falling asleep. Even as a baby I slept soundly through the night — or so I was told. \n\nMy head felt heavy. A thought loomed in the background just out reach. I felt it scratching against the back of my skull. It was driving me crazy.\n\nI crept into the basement. When I was a kid I’d snuggle a colorful toy rabbit in bed — always falling into a deep slumber when it was by my side. Embarrassed as I was to admit it, I felt that may do the trick. \n\nThe basement was the one part of the house that was a mess; in stark contrast to how spotless and organized the other rooms were. Rows of uneven steel cabinets, overflowing with clutter, made it exhaustively claustrophobic. Thick cobwebs carpeted the ceiling as if they were drapes. \n\nIt had been years since I’d seen my rabbit, so I wasn’t sure where to start. Browsing the shelves for far too long, I finally spotted its blue ears poking above a cardboard box. They were covered in a thick layer of dust. \n\nRubbing my eyes, I clumsily reached for the toy. As I was only inches away, a bulbous spider descended from the darkness on a silky thread, brushing against my outstretched hand. A shrill shriek escaped my lips. I stumbled backward and brought several boxes of stuff down with me.\n\nStars overtook my vision. The back of my skull bounced off the concrete. Dazed, I pulled myself into a sitting position. My eyesight no longer vibrating, I took stock of the mess I’d made. \n\nBetter clean this up, I thought to myself. \n\nWithout much thought, I began to place items into whatever box they’d fit into: a rusty pair of scissors, a deflated basketball, an old New Yorker magazine. Then, I noticed something very different. \n\nShining in the darkness, a leather satchel was sprawled onto the floor. Unlike the other junk, it was not covered in dust or grime — almost like new. Nestled inside, I could make out a series of labeled cases. Curiosity rising, I rummaged through the bag’s contents.\n\nOne of the cases was labeled December 20th, 2010 — my fifth birthday. Within the case was a DVD. Some had scrawled onto it with sharpie: Deleted Scene #00237 \n\nEyebrow raised inquisitively, I gathered a hand full of cases and tip toed into the living room. I placed the DVD from my birthday into the player. Turning the volume low, I plopped onto the couch and pressed play. \n\n“Shut your mouth you little brat. I’ve had enough of your back talk!” My mom shuffled into the frame. Her face was scrunched with anger. “March your ass over here Lionel.” \n\nA young boy begrudgingly stomped to my mom’s side. He had my brothers name, but it wasn’t my brother — he looked nothing like him. I could see the boy was shaking as he drew closer. \n\n“I hate you….” With trembling lips, the boy spoke barely above a whisper. \n\nWithout hesitation, my mom slapped him sharply across the face. Her eyes bulged with rage. All of the background sounds disappeared. The room grew deathly quiet. \n\n“I’ll show you what hate really means.”\n\nShe descended upon the boy. Leaning her mouth into his neck, he slumped to the ground. Eyes glazing over, he look directly into the camera before the recording went black. \n\n“What the fuck?” I muttered under my breath. \n\nMy mind was struggling to process what I’d seen. Anxiety rising, sleep now a distant concern, I ejected the DVD and replaced it with another. \n\nThe video started out shaky and blurry. I could barely make out two small figures sitting at a table. As it came into focus, it became clear they weren’t just sitting — they were bound to the chairs with thick white threads. \n\n“Gillian, Lionel — do you have anything to say for yourselves?” \n\nMy father appeared, his back to the camera. He walked with an exaggerated limp. With every step you could hear his foot dragging against the floor.\n\n“Please, please — just let us go. We’ll never do anything bad again.” \n\nAlthough they had my siblings names, I didn’t recognize either of the kids. This wasn’t even the same Lionel from the last video. \n\n“Let you go? I don’t think I can do that. You stabbed me in the leg — that’s not just something I can forgive. But maybe you can try and convince me otherwise.”\n\nThe kids glanced at each other. Their faces were etched with fear. The girl mouthed something silently and the boy nodded in the affirmative. \n\n“We know about the new brother — Ricky. That’s why we acted out. We were jealous; we love you so much and couldn’t bear sharing that love. Can’t you understand that?”\n\nThe mention of my name brought me closer to the TV screen. I leaned so close I was practically touching it with my nose.\n\n“I understand; I understand that you’re lying, manipulative little shits. Your mother and I no longer have use for you. Our time as a family has come to an end.”\n\nThe children screamed bloody murder as white threads descended from the ceiling and covered their entire bodies. Then, it cut to black. \n\nI was shaken. The foundation I’d built my life upon no longer was solid — it was shifting like the sands in the desert. If I was smart, I would have run out of the house and never looked back — but I had to see more. That unseen thought was still scratching against my skull and I was confident the answers I subconsciously yearned for lived in these recordings. \n\nI started the next recording with nervous anticipation. It opened on a closeup of my moms rotund face. She was smiling unusually wide. \n\n“Welcome to the family Ricky.” My father cooed sweetly. \n\nA chubby boy around ten years old waddled toward my mothers outstretched arms — but it wasn’t me. They were calling a complete stranger by my name. \n\n“I’m sure you’re very frightened right now — but soon your old life will be nothing but a dream. Let me show you who you were always meant to be.” Mom ran her hands thorough the boy’s hair. \n\nThe camera zoomed in on the pair. Smiling for the camera, Mom placed her hands into her mouth and stretched her lips until they extended past her jaw. Salivating mandibles extended from the back of her throat. A proboscis suddenly burst forth, impaling itself into the boys neck. It pulsated with grotesque excitement, injecting juices into his veins. After about a minute she stopped, and her face returned to normal. \n\n“Mom? Dad? How did I get down here? I just had the worst dream…”\n\n“You’re sleepwalking again, Ricky. Don’t worry, Mommy’s here for you.”\n\nI was reaching my breaking point, but I couldn’t turn away. There was a secret I hadn’t yet unveiled. Somewhere deep inside myself was a truth desperate to come out — I had no choice but to continue. \n\n“My name isn’t Ricky” \n\nI gasped audibly. The next recording started with an intense closeup of my face. I looked to be about the same age as I was currently — maybe a bit younger. Tears streamed down my face. \n\n“Not yet it isn’t. We need to dispose of this Ricky first, but soon enough you’ll take on the mantle.” \n\nAnother teenager was strung up from the basement ceiling, wrapped tightly in what looked like spider webs. He was struggling to free himself, but to no avail. Muffled screams echoed through the room. \n\n“Watch closely my soon-to-be son — this is what happens when you go against the family.” My mom winked at the camera. \n\nShe impaled the other Ricky’s abdomen with her mouth parts. He convulsed in agony as he was drained of fluids. His body dried up into a mummified state; I watched the life evacuate from his eyes. \n\nShe turned to me and I screamed, unable to move because I was chained to the floor. This time the process was reversed, I was filled with the fluids she had just stolen from the young man now lifelessly swinging back and forth. My belly inflated likens balloon, my feature become rotund — but after a moment I returned to normal. \n\n“Mom? Dad? Where am I? I just had the worst nightmare.” Innocence filled my voice. \n\n“You’re safe now sweetie. We’re here for you.”\n\nI ejected the DVD, unable to watch anymore. Trembling, I snapped the disk in half before crushing it underneath my feet. \n\nThe floorboards behind me creaked; I snapped my head in that direction. My father loomed in the archway of the living room, arms crossed with displeasure. \n\n“What are you watching sweetie?” With a sickly sweet tone, my mothers voice rolled down the stairwell. \n\nShe was hanging from the wall. Eight limbs protruded from her swollen abdomen, covered with thick hairs. Just as many eyes covered her forehead — each one fixated on me. \n\nInstinct took over. My path to the front door cut off, I slammed into the the living room window, shoulder first, and shattered the glass. Shards rained down on me. Guttural, animalistic shrieks followed me as I fled into the night. Covered in blood, I limped onto the porch of a nearby house before passing out. \n\nI awoke in the hospital. A stern looking detective informed me that I was an assumed runaway from halfway across the country. The police reunited me with my real parents — but I didn’t remember them or anything about my previous life. \n\nSeveral weeks after settling into my new home, I found myself wandering the basement, unable to sleep. Underneath a dirty tarp, I stumbled upon a conspicuous duffel bag filled to the brim with flash drives. Each was labeled with a different name. My eyes widened as I discovered one labeled “Ricky”. \n\nI plugged the flash drive into my computer. It opened a folder with a short video; I immediately played it. \n\n“It’s truly a pleasure doing business with you. You’re ability to procure children without raising the suspicions of law enforcement is unparalleled.” \n\nMy former mother and current mother shook hands. A human-sized suitcase was exchanged, and they walked their separate ways. \n\nI was jolted from my viewing with a slight knock on the door.\n\n[“Sweetie, what are you watching?” An all too familiar voice echoed through my room.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MidnightProfessor/)",

        "text": " \n\nI'm a detective working for a small town called Phoenixville. It's never been incredibly busy around here, in fact, I think the most interesting thing to happen around here was a small boy that went missing like 2 years ago, it turns out he was just hiding from his parents because they wouldn't get him a toy, little brat.\n\nThis changed a few weeks back though, as a murder happened in one of the houses a few blocks down from my house. The woman wasn't well-liked in the town, she was an eccentric type who kept to herself most of the time. However, when she didn't keep to herself she was incredibly off-putting and made it seem like she was better than everybody else. I know she didn’t like me, I had to arrest her multiple times for making things physical with a few people. Nothing ever came of it though it was purely threats, she was as skinny as a stick and I would assume weaker than one as well\n\nAs I stepped into the house the first thing that hit me was the smell, it was rancid. I picked up one of those cardboard masks just so I didn't have to breathe it in anymore, it helped for a bit but eventually, it became of no use as the cracks in between went larger the more I talked.\n\nThe house was filled with random junk; she looked to be a hoarder. Every room had piles of newspapers, old toys, and books. The piles of trash seemed to be sorted but in a sort of messy way. As well as the clutter there were scratch marks over every wall, some seemed to be symbols but others just looked like scratch marks.\n\nSome of the symbols had been deliberately scratched out. At the time I didn't even think of that and figured it was either her mental health suffering or maybe there was a scuffle before the murder took place. It didn't seem like a big deal but now I understand.\n\nI immediately went over to the woman and looked at her nails, they seemed completely fine, a bit short, presumably because she bit them but other than that, it didn't look like she had created the marks.\n\nI tried to look for any other signs of how she was murdered but the only one I could see was a massive bruise on the back of her head, I wasn't sure whether that killed her or just knocked her unconscious. There were no signs of forced entry either so she most likely let the person in. I left the crime scene feeling confused, fatigued, and weirdly dizzy.\n\nIt was around 2 pm-ish I want to say when I arrived home, I took the rest of the day off work as the dizziness became too much for me to handle. I assumed it had to do with the crime scene, id never actually seen a dead body before, at least not humans. It may have also been the smell. It seems silly to me now. \n\nI lay down on my bed, just trying to get my head straight. I opened my eyes and I saw something dart past, it was relatively large, and it moved so fast I saw it for what seemed to be half of a millisecond, my heart started racing as I tried to figure out a rational explanation, \n\n“Was it all in my head? “\n\nI suddenly saw all black as o felt the world dropping beneath me.\n\nI woke up rubbing the side of my head as I slowly got up, it hurt like hell. The world around me felt like it was going inwards and outwards. I finally sat up fully and kneeled. I only then realized the blood on the floor, it was pouring out of my nose, however, I couldn’t get up, as much as I may have wanted to. As the world was moving before my eyes I could do nothing but sit there.\n\nIt finally went away again, and as soon as the world stopped spinning my nosebleed stopped too, however, the loss of blood made me feel lightheaded, I slowly walked back to my room leaning up against the wall of the hallway in order to stabilize myself. I landed on the bed with a hard thump and almost immediately blacked out again. \n\nA loud ringing filled my ears, I was standing in the house again, the smell was gone and in its place, it smelled like mint. The body still lay on the floor, the blood fresh, pouring slowly out covering the markings on the floor. I stood there watching the symbol get filled up, it resembled a pentagram. \n\nAs it finally finished the already somewhat blackened blood, turned into a dark black and became coagulated. The room became suddenly incredibly bright, blinding almost. Two seconds later the lights turned off and then because of the bright light I couldn't see anything. After a few moments, my vision came back and I saw the black figure standing in front of me, at least 8 feet tall, I heard a quiet, raspy whisper.\n\n“I see you”\n\nI answered back with a shaky voice “what's going on, wh-where am I?” \n\nThe voice continued “you have been chosen to produce my brethren, we need only your blood”\n\nAt this point, my voice stopped working. I could barely get a squeak out let alone a word\n\nIn a satisfied tone, the figure said “I’m glad you agreed.”\n\nMy house came back into view slowly as I felt cold sweat dripping down my body. \n\nI called off of work for the next three days shaking in my bed, wondering when I would see the figure next. Every little sound scared me half to death, and I was already close enough. For those three days I didn't get any sleep, my head was aching with pain around the back area, and my eyes felt like bags, but I didn’t care. The fear had taken control, I was purely running off of adrenaline. \n\nI saw it slowly coming toward me, and even after mentally preparing myself for this moment I still froze, nothing could help me at this point. It got to the end of my bed and didn’t say anything. The room was quiet. It touched my forehead and I knew everything. It no longer needed to speak, I now knew its goal, and it was beautiful. I had to pick the next person, similar to chain mail. I knew everybody at this point. It was an easy choice.\n\nI scratched out the markings on the floor, creating symbols around the floor, getting prepared for the ritual, I’m just about to start now. I am only writing this to let you know if you have finished reading this, it’s too late. You have already been chosen next. Don’t be afraid when you see him, you will soon understand we are all insignificant compared to the plan he showed me, and the one he will soon show you.\n\nGoodbye.",

        "text": "It was October 26th, 1973, and Mike and Tobias, two childhood friends and college Juniors, were driving along the rural dirt roads of Northeast Virginia. Mike smoked a blunt, as Tobias drove, eyes focused on the road. “So, where are we goin’?” Mike asked, shooting a glance to Tobias. \n\nTobias shifted his eyes to face Mike. “A lotta people around town have been saying that some madman in a rabbit costume has been chasing them around and threatening them with a hatchet, or an axe, or somethin’ like that.” Tobias said, once again shifting his eyes to face the dark road ahead, only illuminated by the bright glow of the sedan’s headlights. \n\n“You really believe that fuckin’ chickenshit story?” Mike glanced to Tobias, raising his brow, before taking another puff of the blunt. “Seems real enough, there are more madmen out in the world than you think.” Tobias sniffled, keeping his eyes on the road. \n\nMike adjusted his glasses. “Okay, but why the fuck are we going out there if this guy has a fuckin’ axe? Are you fuckin’ suicidal?” Mike scoffed after saying this. “You think I’m stupid enough to not go strapped?” Tobias shot a glance at Mike, before taking his backpack out of the back seat, and opening it, showing a .38 Special. “So you want to go to jail for murder?” Mike asked, once again scoffing.\n\n“It won’t be murder, if some madman is swinging a hatchet at you I think you have the right to defend yourself.” Tobias then placed the firearm back into the back and closed the bag up, placing it in the back seat once again. A few minutes later the two arrived, and parked their car, right up by an overpass. “The people said they’ve seen him around here, by this tunnel.” Tobias said as he removed the keys from the vehicles, ignition, causing the two to now be surrounded in darkness. \n\n“Ain’t no way I’m going out there in the dark.” Mike said, tossing his blunt out of the rolled down window. “I brought a flashlight, don’t worry.” Tobias reached into the back of his car, grabbing the backpack and sliding it on, before sliding out of the car. Mike rolled his window up, and then slid out.\n\nTobias held the flashlight and turned it on, lighting up the area in front of him. Tobias now began to walk, with Mike following behind. “Where the hell are we gonna find this guy?” Mike asked as he walked with Tobias. “If he’s here now he’ll probably be somewhere around this bridge and tunnel.” Tobias said, as he and Mike walked through the darkened tunnel. \n\nMike began to sweat, and bore a nervous expression. “Seems like you’re scared of the imaginary rabbit killer.” Tobias joked. “Shut up, man!” Mike said with annoyance. Tobias gave out a chuckle, just as the two exited the tunnel. “Let’s check the train tracks up there.” Tobias said. “What if we get hit by a train?” Mike asked with a bit of anger in his voice. “We’ll hear it coming, we’ll have enough time to get off the tracks.” Tobias said.\n\n\nThe two climbed up onto the train tracks and began to look around. Tobias flashed his flashlight around, in an attempt to see anyone or anything out of place. Tobias then stopped, Mike stopped too, looking around anxiously. “Did you hear that?” Tobias looked around, shining the light. “Hear what?” Mike asked. “I heard leaves rustling, I think it came from the woods down there.” Tobias turned to Mike. “I’m gonna check it out.” Tobias said, as he slid the .38 Special out from his backpack. \n\n“Don’t-” Mike said, reaching his hand out, but it was too late, as Tobias had already ran down the hill and into the darkness below, taking the flashlight with him. Mike debated on following, but for the time being he simply stood, looking around anxiously, gallons upon gallons of sweat were coming down from his forehead. \n\nMike sat, tortured by the silence, until suddenly, two gunshots rang out, and a scream from Tobias. The flashlight had gone out, and several loud crunches were heard. “Tobias? Tobias?! This isn’t funny man!” Mike screamed, slowly making his way down from the train tracks and into the woods below. “Tobias?! TOBIAS?!” Mike shouted, his voice trembling. \n\nHe saw a figure coming towards him. He stepped a bit closer, thinking it was Tobias. “Real funny joke, but it’s over now, let’s go-” Mike stopped mid sentence, seeing that the figure was wearing a white bunny suit, and had a white hood on with rabbit ears, and a plastic rabbit mask covering his face. The figure was hopping around on both legs, and was saying, “Hop… Hop… Hop…” repeatedly in a deep voice, as it approached Mike.\n\nMike backed up and fell onto a stick, causing it to crunch and make a loud sound, and the man in the rabbit costume stopped hopping, and looked right at Mike. The man in the rabbit costume brought out a hatchet from behind his back, and began to full on sprinting towards Mike! Mike burst out into a sprint, running for the tunnel. \n\n“GET OUT OF MY WOODS!” The pursuer shouted, as he ran for Mike. As Mike entered the tunnel, the man in the rabbit suit caught up, and swung his hatchet at Mike, but it just missed. Mike then turned around and kicked the attacker, who grunted. Mike then grabbed the hatchet from his hand and then slashed his face with it, breaking the mask and creating a gash in the man’s face.\n\nThe man screamed, as Mike ran back to the car. Mike tried opening the car, but couldn’t, due to Tobias having the keys. Mike, thinking quickly, grabbed a nearby rock and hurled it through the car window, unlocking the car and sliding inside. Mike began to attempt to hotwire the car in an attempt to escape. He darted his head around, searching for his attacker, but he was gone, seemingly having retreated after Tobias had injured him. \n\nAs he attempted to hotwire the car, he heard a slam against the window. He looked over, his heart jumping out of his chest. “FUCK!” Mike screamed, but was shocked to see… Tobias? He wasn’t dead like Mike had thought, but he was clearly hurt. Tobias slid into the passenger seat of the car, and set his bag down. “FUCK!” Tobias shouted. “GIVE ME YOUR KEYS! LET’S GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE MAN!” Mike shouted, shaking Tobias by the shoulders. “Mike…” Tobias said in a shocked voice. “Yeah?” Mike said, slowly turning his head to face his friend.\n\nIt was then when Mike noticed the large gash on Tobias’s cheek, with fresh blood running down his face. “Hop… Hop… Hop…” Tobias said aloud in that same deep voice that Mike had heard from his attacker. “No… No… No… NO… NO… NO!” Mike shouted with tears streaming down his face, as Tobias slid out the same bloody hatchet, and plunged it into Mike’s chest.",

        "text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11c0pug/theres_something_in_the_darkness_and_it_wants_me/)\n\nIf I can recall correctly, I was 20 when I encountered this darkness again. It was during the night again, while I slept, I was awoken by the sound of something falling over in my bedroom. Living alone now, it was indeed odd for any movement to be had at all besides what the air conditioning would provide to the objects close to vents around my apartment. It wasn’t until I sat up in bed, scanned around my room, and took in the sight of a familiar apparition that I realized just what had made the noise. Almost instantaneously, the whispering filled my ears just as it did once before, sounding a gentle hum in my head. Before I could stop myself, I was out of bed and walking towards the misty creature, stepping as fast as my sleepy limbs would carry me. I stretched out my hands and let the wispy appendages it offered take them. In a split second I was submerged in light, the warmth and comforting glow surrounding me wholly and completely. \n\nFor what seemed like hours, I was suspended in this light, not really sure what was going on around me, letting the world float past. But the whispering came back, and just as it did, I was again thrust from the warmth of the light and into the dark void, enveloped in darkness but only for a moment. I remembered my dream from years ago and expected to be shown dreams of terror and suffering but no, I was placed upon that same beach from back then, and, just like before, there loomed a great and disastrous storm in the distance. I then recalled that there was something gargantuan standing behind me in my dream and as I chanced looking, I was greeted by the large creature yet again, though this time, one of its massive heads was already lowered to my level and ready to impose its will.  \n\nI thought it was going to speak, I was sure of it, as it opened its mouth wide and inhaled, but then it pulled its back and let a ferocious roar unlike anything I’ve ever heard before it. It looked back down at me as if to be sure I was giving it all my attention. The dragon turned its heads towards the sea, the unending ocean beyond the both of us, which forced my head to turn there too, just to see what it was staring at. As I stood there, a feeling of unimaginable terror came over me. Even before I saw whatever I was meant to see, I could feel a sense of dread and panic wash over me and fill me brim full. I didn’t know what was about to happen, but I was terrified. \n\nOut of the water came what I was so dismayed about, a beast so unholy I dare not guess what it truly was. This monster pulled itself from the sea, one head at a time, seven of them, each as massive as the last. On the heads, it held ten horns with ten crowns, just like the dragon. As the colossal creature rose from the water, it became clearer to me, I could see that one of the heads had a large, healed wound on it, one that would seem like it’d kill even a monster that size. Its body started erupting from the water and I witnessed the fur about its body, speckled like that of leopard or a cheetah, surrounding the torso and necks. Its legs though, were different, covered in darker hair and far too large for the body they carried. They were paws at the feet, like bear paws, pads and claws like knives that stabbed the sand they plunged into.  \n\nThe beast stood at the shoreline in a prideful pose, allowing the dragon and I to take in its figure. It too began to roar, its mouth I could now see resembling that of a lion, the large fangs, whiskers, and muzzle all resembling that kind of feline. As the fierce, thundering cry rumbled in my ears I jolted up in bed and took a deep breath before starting to hyperventilate, realizing I was alone again, in bed, covered up and it was the next morning. \n\nI wasn’t sure what it was I was seeing in my dreams or why. I was also struck by the fact that I could recall, and still can, each and every detail of these dreams as if I was still there in person, face-to-face with what had stood before me. I could still hear faint whispering as I sat there in bed but it soon faded out and I started to forget it was even there. I gathered myself, wiping away the sweat that collected on my brow and rubbing off the shakes my hand had started into, standing from my bed and heading for the bathroom. \n\nI went to work that day with the dream on my mind while I mechanically typed at my computer desk. I worked at a usual 9 to 5 in a cubicle as a customer service representative for a large company in the local area. I would often answer phones and help people with problems with company merchandise or answer questions about programs through the establishment if things were unclear. Just then, I was finishing up some after-call paperwork and sending it in to my supervisors when a new call came in. I was just about done with my typing, so I went ahead and answered the call.  \n\nI clicked on my headset and just before the caller chimed in, I could hear a gentle ringing in my ear, a soft hum, which I at first didn’t recognize as sounding similar to the noise from my earlier dream. I was just about to take off my headset to check if it was faulty in some way, but I was then greeted with the sound of male voice on the other end of the phone. \n\n“Hello?” \n\n“Yes, hello, this is JC Comparisons customer support, you’re speaking with Natalie, how may I assist you today?” Just as I spoke, I started to hear the whispering, the sound of it taking away my attention momentarily. \n\n“Natalie...Natalie...maybe you can help me...” The man sounded gruff and sleepy, like he hadn’t just called in to talk about some item he ordered online. \n\n“Yes, sir, please tell me, is there a product or program with which you are having trouble?” The whispering was getting louder, making it hard to concentrate on the man. Suddenly, a quick blip of the janitor from years before burning in a large fireball, arms outstretched at his sides and walking towards me flashed across my eyes. \n\n“Hello?” The man’s voice caught me off guard. \n\n“Y-yes, sir. Sorry about that. Could you repeat what you just said? For confirmation?” I lied; I hadn’t heard a thing the man had said. \n\n“I said...is this call being recorded?” I knitted my brows together, not an unusual question but it doesn’t get asked a lot. \n\n“All calls are recorded for quality assurance, sir.” \n\n“Mmh...do you think you could turn that off?” My brows scrunched together further. \n\n“Turn it off, sir?” \n\n“Yeah, just turn off the recorder, or whatever it is that you’re using...” I could hear the sound of something metal being dragged against more metal, the noise was so faint though, I could hardly ascertain what it was. It was now that I realized the whispering had calmed to nothing but a gentle hum again, a ringing in my ear. \n\n“I can’t just turn it off, sir, it’s built in.” I told the man. “Is there something I can help you with today, sir?” \n\n“Do you think God’ll save us?” The question jarred me a little, the tone of his words sending a chill down my spine. “Hello?” \n\n“I’m still here, sir.” \n\n“Do you think he will?” I was quiet for a moment. \n\n“I don’t know what you mean, sir. If you believe in God, I’m sure-” He cut me off, the shouts on the other end of the phone making me jump slightly from my chair. \n\n“THAT’S NOT WHAT I MEAN, NATALIE! DO. YOU THINK. GOD. WILL SAVE US?!” I was quiet again, the sound of metal scraping becoming louder, so loud I could hear it audibly now. “Answer me, Natalie...!” He was getting impatient, and the gentle hum began to rise in volume again, becoming so loud it was like someone was standing next to me trying to talk to me but all that was coming out was a line of garbled gibberish. \n\n“I-I don’t know, sir, I don’t know what you’re talking about!”  \n\n“Wrong answer. Looks like you couldn’t help me after all...” The man sounded defeated and withdrawn in his words, the scraping sound ceasing almost immediately after he spoke. “Thanks anyway, Natalie.”  \n\nI then heard cloth being cut, something tearing open like a shirt or pants being ripped apart. It was quiet for a few seconds, the other line almost completely silent except for a few crackles here and there. As I listened, I could hear...something, like a slicing sound, or cutting, something. There was suddenly a loud crash on the other end, a noise that seemed to disrupt the phone line because it dropped the call moments after. I sat in shock for at least a minute, wondering what had just happened, wondering what the man meant by his words and why he thought I’d have any answers for him in the first place. I didn’t understand anything that was going on, but as I sat there, rummaging through my thoughts, I decided it was best to report my call in the employee portal and let the supervisors know about what the strange man was saying. Just as I was about to start typing in the address to get the forms ready, someone tapped me on the shoulder to get my attention. \n\n“Natalie? Hey, Jeff wants to talk to you.” A coworker alerted me that my boss was asking for my presence, telling me to go and see what he needed. \n\nI made my way to the older man’s office, thinking it’s good that I’ll be going, I can tell him about the strange call in person, though I was unsure of why he was calling me to his office initially. When I got there, I stepped to the entrance and knocked on his open door. He saw he and closed the file he had open in his hand to beckon me closer. Oddly, the file he was holding in his hand happened to be mine, I could see the name on the outside of it in one the corners. \n\n“Natalie, please, come in, have a seat.” I took his invitation and planted myself in the old, plastic chair that sat in front of his desk. “Do you know why I called you in here, Natalie?” He asked, taking his own seat and clasping his hands over the top of his desk, my file tucked neatly beneath them. \n\n“No, sir.” I replied quickly. “I was actually about to tell you about a call I just took-” The dark-haired man interrupted me, completely ignoring the words I was trying to say. \n\n“Natalie, how long have you worked here?” He inquired, a fake smile paired with an inquisitive look now plastered across his face. \n\n“A year and a half, sir. Almost right out of high school.” I recalled that the day I started to work at the company, I was welcomed with open arms and an advanced paycheck if I started early. \n\n“Right. And would you say, Natalie,” he reopened my file and took a look at one at one the sheets facing him, “that we’ve-I’ve favored you, in that time? I can see here that you’ve have a few disciplinary slips where you’ve been a little aggressive with callers and even forgetting to turn in after-call paperwork, but still, you have never been given any full disciplinary action or demotions in the time frame in which you’ve been working here, is that correct?” I awkwardly scratched my cheek and straightened myself up in my chair, recollecting the times when I did indeed shout at a few people over the phone when they first became hostile with me or the two or three times I had forgotten to finish up pages and turn in work after a phone call had finished. \n\n“What, um...what’s this about?” I was becoming uneasy and anxious, starting to fidget and pull at my fingers as they rested in my lap while trying not to look too long into Jeff’s eyes. His gaze was unsettling. Though he was looking at me, it was like he was staring off in the distance, like he wasn’t really there with me in the room. \n\n“Why do you think that is, Natalie? Did you think, ‘I’m lucky I haven’t got into too much trouble’ or ‘I wonder if anybody knows I actually did this’? Or did you realize it was for a reason?” Another fake smile grew on his face as he waited for me to respond. When I didn’t, he continued. “Well, I’ll tell you, it was. I did you a favor, Natalie, helped you out. Now, I want something in return.” His face dropped, his eyes became like daggers, drilling into my very soul as he stared at me. \n\n“What do you want?”  \n\n“I’ll tell you, but first, I want you to tell me what that call you just had was about.” He sat back in his chair and pulled his clasped hands to his lips. “What did the two of you speak about?” \n\n“What? You mean that weird guy?” I calmed, if only for a moment. “That’s what I was trying to say to you at first, he was yelling at me, wanting to know if I could answer his questions.” \n\n“Which were?” \n\n“He was saying something like, ‘do you think God will save us’, or something like that.” I tried to remember word-for-word what the man said and relayed what I could recall. \n\n“Hm. So do you?” Jeff sat forward again, closing my file and placing a hand over the folder. \n\n“Do I what, exactly?” He snickered and clarified. \n\n“Believe he will save us?” I sat for a second to process his question then shook my head in disbelief, was everyone going crazy today? \n\n“What is this about, sir, what’s going on? First, you talk about my time here, then my disciplinary file and ‘wanting something from me’, then God? What is this?” I threw my hand up in an exaggerated movement and just as I was about to stand and leave, he stopped me and spoke. \n\n“Natalie, sit down. We’re not done here.” He stood instead, walking around me and shutting the door, locking it and turning to me. He inhaled deeply before taking his seat and rummaging through a deep drawer for something. I could suddenly hear the whispering again and the sound of it frightened me, I was unsure of what the situation was going to bring, but the unexpected presence of the whispering made me feel like something bad was about to occur. When he found what he was looking for, he pulled it out and sat it on the corner of the desk, the very sight of it making me instinctively stand from my chair and make a move for the door. “Sit. Down.” He ordered. I had no choice but to take my seat again, my eyes never leaving the item that had just joined the two of us. \n\n“Now, Natalie...I’d like to tell you what I want.” \n\n“Yes, sir.” I nodded and swallowed hard, my breathing becoming heavy and labored. \n\n“What I want is something I’m sure you can help me with, I’m sure you’ve already helped others, like that caller, for instance.” He placed his hands on the top of the desk, one over the other and talked as if there wasn’t a gun, possibly loaded, just off to the side of us. \n\n“I’m not sure what you mean, sir.” He scoffed and shook his head. \n\n“Oh, you do. What I need from you is the truth, Natalie.” I furrowed my brows together in confusion, visually expressing my need for clarification. Jeff, unfortunately, in the slowly escalating state he was in, didn’t seem to realize that I wasn’t even remotely sure of what he wanted from me. “DON’T ACT LIKE YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, NATALIE!” His sudden loudness made me push back in my chair, the hairs on my neck standing straight up when I saw one of his hands fall to the gun. The whispering was getting louder and louder, it was like a warning this time, telling me that something was just about to happen. “I saw you there, we all did...standing with that thing...I know you know what’s coming. Tell me what it is, Natalie!” \n\n“What are you talking about?! Saw me where? Who’s we?” I questioned, the flashes of my dreams popping in my head. My lack of knowledge seemed to enrage Jeff, he took the gun in his hand and smacked at his temple with the butt of it.  \n\n“Natalie...I want you to tell me what I want to know.” He had started to sweat, beads of it dripping from his face and spilling onto the pages scattered on his desk. He let a smirk dance across his face and pinched the bridge of his nose with his free hand. \n\n“I don’t know anything!” \n\n“YOU KNOW!” He slammed his fist on the desk, dropping my file and then using his whole arm to hurl all the papers and objects that rested on his desktop off it and onto the floor. He was partially hunched over his desk now, his hands placed upon it, holding him up and the gun still firmly in his grasp. “You have to know! He said you were his speaker, his prophet, the one who will preach his word, goddamnit! YOU KNOW!” Prophet? What was he talking about? Could those dreams...could those dreams not have been dreams at all, but...visions? Warnings? But even so I couldn’t decipher them, I had no inkling of understanding about their message, what any of it meant, the dragon, the beast from the sea, nothing. \n\n“I don’t!”  \n\n“YOU DO!” \n\n“PLEASE!” I tried to reason with my boss, but it seemed like he was too far gone, crazed in his mind for whatever reason, he was stuck on the idea that whatever I was, or that he was told I was, and that I should have answers for him. I didn’t. I didn’t have answers for myself.  \n\nFor a few moments, Jeff just stood there, staring at me, a frenzied look in his eyes. But he soon broke that stare and stood upright, taking in a few deep breaths and looking up at the ceiling. He let a solemn, sorrowful look creep upon his face before looking back down to me. \n\n“You...you really don’t know...do you?” He sounded like the man on the phone earlier, defeated and dejected. \n\n“No, sir.” I replied. I could now only hear the whispering faintly, the sound of it like a gentle hum again.  \n\nI saw a tear fall from Jeff’s eye before the next few seconds that happened so fast, I had no time to react until it was all over. \n\n“Then, I guess, you don’t think he’ll save us.” In an instant Jeff pulled the gun up and stuffed it into his mouth, pulling the trigger and immediately slumping to the ground after a spray of blood and brain matter splattered across the wall behind him. \n\nFor a full minute I just sat there, processing the situation. Did everything that just happened really happen. I paid no mind to the fact that people were at the door, banging on it and trying to get in, it was like I was in a whole other world, completely outside of my body while watching Jeff’s body writhe from the after-death jerking that occurs from deep brain damage. It seemed like everything slowed to crawl and I could just barely hear the sound of the door being busted open from behind me over the loud ringing of whispers in my ears. I was greeted by my co-worker who was frantically trying to find out what happened, but after that I don’t remember much. \n\nIt was a few days later when I turned on the news that I discovered they said it was in fact suicide. They listed his menial job, poor family life, and bad childhood as the reasons, but never mentioned anything about religious ideation. I spent many days thinking about the words he spoke to me, about being ‘His’ prophet, ‘His’ preacher, but it all seemed so unreal. I wasn’t religious in any way leading up to this, no real church attendance, no bible study, I wasn’t even sure if I owned a bible. In my search for answers, I wound up purchasing one, paying no mind to the strange looks from the bookstore clerks and those around me when I asked if it was in the fiction section or not. In my defense, I had no real belief system and had no idea really about anything pertaining to God. Wouldn’t say I was atheist, just ignorant. \n\nIt took me a long time to do it, but I read a large chunk of the good book and discovered the Book of Revelation. When I skimmed over the pages, I noticed that a lot of what was said in the verses was quite similar to my previous dreams and, of course, I was a little unnerved. For the first time, I entertained the idea that I may actually be having visions. I didn’t think I was a prophet or any holier than the next person, but I was seeing some crazy stuff and it seemed strikingly similar to something I had not yet even heard about or looked into. I had no formal introduction to it, and for it to be shown to me in full detail without such exposure was...strange.  \n\nI didn’t know where to go from there, how to proceed with the newfound knowledge that I just might be psychic, not a prophet. I made the executive decision to contact a professional to see if they could help me. That was a mistake.",

        "text": "“Welcome to Hotel Entropy, with death in all but seven rooms.” \n\n*Hotel Entropy?* \n\n*What?* \n\nI felt like I was waking up from a three day long daydream. My muscles were sore and weak at the same time and my head was throbbing, a pain I had felt only once in my entire life – after an abundance of tequila shots. \n\nBut this couldn’t just be a horrendous hangover. I hadn’t even touched a single drop of alcohol in several months, starting the day I had found out I was pregnant. \n\nYou know those moments where *something* just feels off? \n\nWell, this wasn’t like that at all. *Everything* felt off. \n\nHere I was standing in a uniform I had never before worn, in a room I had never seen, within a hotel of which the name I had never heard. As if a whole chunk of time had simply vanished from my mind and even then I couldn’t make sense of it. \n\n*Because it simply didn’t make any fucking sense.*  \n\nEven the hotel itself felt a bit surreal, as if it wasn’t from this time. \n\nI glared at my watch, the only thing that felt familiar, and focused on the little hands ticking away. \n\n*11:03*\n\nWith all mental strength I was trying to recall the last thing I did remember in certainty, but somehow I couldn’t pinpoint it. Was it the moment I went to bed? My seventh ramen noodle meal this week? \n\nGun to my head and I still wouldn’t be able to tell you. \n\n“And here’s your key, Mr. and Mrs. Smith. You’re lucky, we’ve had no unfortunate incidents in this room. Theodore will help you with your luggage and show you the way.” \n\nThe elderly couple standing by the front desk thanked the man sporting a fancy blazer and wandered away, as a young lad quickly dragged their suitcases behind him. \n\n“Laura, are you dreaming again?”\n\nI froze. \n\nHe knew my name. \n\nBlazer Guy made his way over to me, close enough for me to make out his name from his nametag and to catch the foul smell he carried with him. \n\n*Herman. Front Desk Manager.* \n\nI swallowed away a sour taste in my mouth.\n\n“You look a little pale. Perhaps getting back to work will get some colour back in those cheeks,” he spoke in a way that made my stomach turn.\n\nMy instincts told me not to share my confusion with him, so I did my best to mutter a lie – though that was never my strong suit. \n\n“I- I’m not feeling too well, actually. Perhaps I could go home?” \n\nA kind smile graced his sharp facial features. And then it grew wider. And wider. And wider. Past anything natural. \n\n“Home? What a silly thing to say. That sounds like a very *stupid* idea,” he put a slender, cold hand on my shoulder - causing a shiver to travel through my spine and then the rest of my body – and laughed. Uncomfortably loud.\n\nAnd then all of the others in the hall joined. The receptionist, security, even some guests. Everyone letting out a cackle as if they had heard the joke of the year. Yet within a few mere seconds all of them stopped and continued on as if nothing had happened. \n\n“Come on now, I know you can do better than this. Room 237 needs cleaning, off you go.” \n\nI nodded and started making my way up the stairs, looking over my shoulder to see that horrifying smile just one more time. \n\nThough I had no idea what was happening, one thing I knew for sure; I couldn’t simply walk out of here, wherever *here* was. I just needed to buy myself some time and figure out what the hell was going on.\n\nRoom 237 seemed like as good a place as any to start, and simultaneously keep myself covered. \n\nToo many steps later I arrived on the right floor, seeing a hallway stretched out with at least a couple of dozen rooms. My focus was purely on catching my breath though. I bloody hate stairs. \n\n“Oh dearie, you should’ve taken the elevator.” \n\nAn older woman appeared through one of the doors, a reddish mop in hand and wearing an outfit exactly like mine. Unlike the others downstairs, she seemed more *human.* Just a bit too chipper for my taste. \n\n“We’re a bit too early, just got to wait a wee bit,” she said cheerfully as she beckoned me over and handed me an overused rag and bucket. \n\nThe name *Aileen* graced her uniform.\n\n“Wait? Wait for what?“ \n\nAileen furrowed her brow. “For it to be over, of course… Are you alright, Laura? You seem a bit off today.” \n\nI couldn’t even respond before a bone chilling scream echoed through the hall, causing her to clap her hands together a single time in excitement. \n\n“That’s our cue!” \n\nMy heart sank. Nothing good could come of this. \n\nStill I dutifully followed as she opened the door that was graced by the number 237, in elegant golden letters. I wanted to take a proper mental note of where she put that key after she used it, but I couldn’t. \n\nOf course I couldn’t. \n\nThe smell hit me in the face like a ton of bricks, the view even more so. \n\nThe walls were covered in thick, dark red splashes of what could only be blood. Confirmed by a sight revealed to me as Aileen took a step to the side, the elderly couple I had seen before – spread out over the bed in the shape of a gutted starfish. \n\nIt didn’t make any sense. \n\nI had seen them a few minutes ago.\n\n“This is lovely,” Aileen muttered, before getting distracted by a sound that I too had unmistakably heard. A gurgle. A raspy breath. \n\nShe shook her head in disapproval. “She’s a wee fighter that one,” she said, looking at the woman, “No worries, she’ll stop in a second. Her husband’s been gone for hours though. Typical men.” \n\nThis time I couldn’t stop the nausea, nor whatever was making it’s way back up my oesophagus. \n\nA disgusting yellow substance that once was food, was lying splashed over the floor before me - and my shoes - in the blink of an eye.\n\n“Oh honey, pregnancy is tough isn’t it? Why don’t you take a little break? I won’t tell Herman.” She winked happily. \n\nAnd I took her offer, sort of. I stumbled out to the hallway and fell down against the wall, wrapping my arms around myself.  \n\nOnly then did I discover my phone in my pocket. \n\nAll my contacts were gone though, not that it mattered. I’ve tried to call 911 several times, to no avail. Typing this out seems to be my only option.\n\nI don’t know what’s going to happen, nor what to do. \n\nWhat I do know is that I don’t have a lot of time to figure it out, as I’m certain I don’t want to be here when the hotel’s full.\n\nAnd like an echo, Herman’s voice is right on cue to remind me of this.\n\n“Welcome to Hotel Entropy, with Death in all but six rooms.”",

        "text": "“Last run of the season,” I told myself. My friends had already gone back due to the cold and weaning light, but I needed to get one more run, one more chance to feel the cold air whip across my face while tearing at breakneck speed down an empty track. The season was ending and my wallet was growing slim, I knew this was my last chance to be up here until the snows fell again next November and I took my annual break from work, I was never a great employee. I took a sharp inhale and appreciated the moment. The air was crisp and the sky was a deep bruised purple color that signified the closing of the lifts. The trees nearby sparkled with fresh snow from the recent storm while the dark green was visible and vibrant underneath in the fading sunlight, further away, the colors melded together, causing the mountains to take on a general grey color that I loved more than anything in the world, this was what I lived for.\n\nI took off down the black diamond that’d been my last run the night before. It was steep enough to tear down but mostly free of moguls, with plenty of space to maneuver, so I thought it would be a proper sendoff for the season. Halfway down, however, I noticed a roped-off run that I hadn’t noticed the day before. Normally I don’t duck ropes out of fear of getting my pass pulled, but at this point, ski patrol was probably off the mountain, so I felt safe enough to go for it. Not to mention, this run clearly hadn’t been used yet that day because it had some of the only powder left on the mountain, how could I ignore that?\n\nI ducked the rope and immediately felt I made the right decision as my skis made that familiar soft gliding noise, the best possible way to end the season, a sunset powder run. If you’ve never skied powder before, it kind of feels like carving on a cloud. The track took me to a part of the mountain I hadn’t been on before and I quickly ran out of sunlight. Somewhat regretting my decision as I lost feeling in my fingers, I started carving down as fast as I could, given the powder slowing me down, so I could get back to the lodge where my friends were waiting. I started feeling uneasy, something was off, wrong, but I couldn’t figure out what it was. The hair on the back of my neck stood on end and my breath caught in my throat. The track turned almost horizontal and my pace slowed dramatically which allowed me to catch my breath and think. It hit me like a ton of bricks, it was way too cold. It seemed to have dropped 30 degrees in a matter of minutes, which was a major problem if I wanted to stay alive, I simply wasn’t prepared for this type of temperature shift.\n\nOnce I realized that the track was going in the opposite direction of the lodge, with no sign of turning back, it came to me that I would need to go backcountry if I wanted to make it back before I succumbed to hypothermia. Just after I turned off the path, I heard a thunderous gallop from deeper down the track so I angled my skis and hid behind a bush to catch a glimpse of what was making such a cacophonous noise. After a few seconds of it getting closer, I could make out the silhouette of a titanic moose crashing down the path at an incredible speed, which would have been scary enough, however, what followed was much more horrifying. A long shadow followed the moose, somehow seeming to close the distance between them, as they got closer I could make out more and more uncomfortable details. \n\nI’ve thought long and hard about what I saw but I have no idea what it could have been. It seemed like was a part of the environment in which it lived, imitating the fantastic grey color that forms on distant mountains when the snow and trees blur together just after and during a storm. It looked emaciated, it seemed as if it was only skin stretched over bones that were far too long to be human, but that was what they undeniably resembled. Shortly after passing my hiding spot, the creature caught the moose’s thigh in its elongated boney hands, I winced at the blood spraying from the fingertips but I couldn’t look away. It started tearing into and eating the moose on the spot, ripping out organs and muscles and shoving them down its throat with shocking efficiency while the moose let out its terrible scream. Shortly after the unfortunate mammal fell silent, while the creature was still elbow deep in its prey, it started sniffing the air like a fucking dog.\n\nFor a few seconds, I waited with bated breath as, slowly, its face turned towards me and its all too human eyes met mine. My stomach felt like it was full of lead, If I had eaten lunch I might’ve puked, I knew I had to run but all I could do was stare. We made eye contact for a solid 5 seconds before the tension broke, as soon as it made the slightest movement, the spell was broken and I turned my skis downhill, cast a silent prayer to any gods that would listen, and ripped down that mountainside as fast as my skills allowed. Backcountry was never my forte but I was no stranger to it and my life was on the line so I skied like I never had before, tearing between trees with no hesitation. I heard it at my heels, like an avalanche, tearing through trees and roaring down at impossible speed, yet I managed to keep ahead. With the snow it kicked up whipping me in the back I finally let go of all fear of crashing or going too fast, and with little to no carving, I pointed my skis straight downhill, only turning to avoid trees by the thinnest margins and somehow outpacing this beast that felt a part of the mountains. \n\nI don’t remember how I found my way back. According to my friends, I slid up to the lodge half frozen and fully mad, raving about monsters and forces of nature while I was sat down next to the fire and handed hot chocolate I never even looked at. I recovered fully with no lasting effects thankfully, but my thumbs tingled for a month after that night and I can’t stand that grey color I once loved so much. I want to chalk it all up to hallucinations brought on by cold and exhaustion, and I probably would have if not for one final event. \n\nBecause of my state of borderline hypothermia and mild frostbite, my friends decided to rent a room that night and head back in the morning, I only remember waking up in a chair next to the fireplace in the room with everyone still sleeping around me. Everyone quickly packed into the cars with little talk as soon as we woke up, it seems everyone was a bit shaken up and all thoughts were on home. But shortly after heading out, the car in front of the one I was riding shotgun in stopped and the people got out. My friend and I hopped out to see what the problem was, and a few feet from their front bumper sat the mostly skeletal remains of what was once a moose. I immediately recognized the moose and started having a panic attack. Given the panic attack, it was hard to vocalize my distress to my friends but I got enough out that it was made clear we needed to leave and we were in imminent danger. I don’t think they believed the part about danger, but for my sake, they agreed and we all got back in the cars to get as far away as possible.\n\nThe worst part, however, they never saw. As we drove away from the corpse, my eyes were drawn to the treeline where the creature once again made eye contact with me, and this time, the eyes betrayed a terrible sadness from within the beast, only matched by its deep, ancient hunger.",

        "text": "The best place to start is at the beginning. Well, Not the beginning beginning.\n\nNot my birth or anything like that. That would be silly, a lot of wasted information, and I'd imagine most of you would stop listening fairly quickly.\n\nHigh school is tough. Especially if you're the kind of kid who people deem odd. Once you're older, you understand that things like that don't matter but as a kid. It's all that matters to most people. I was never bullied. But I was definitely an outcast. I did get my fair share of comments, though, especially by Russel Welsh. A guy who went by the self-appointed, mind you, Muscle Russel. He was more bloated than muscular, but if you said that to him, he would definitely punch you in the face. He had zero problems doing that and made sure you knew about it. But if you avoided him, he would generally leave you alone. I made it my job to not have any dealings with this kid. That was until the day of the book. (The beginning I spoke about before.)\n\nIt was after Columbus day weekend. We were off from school that Monday, and I drove with my parents to visit my aunt Beth upstate. New York, Upstate New York. Warwick, to be more specific. I must remind myself that not everyone knows what I'm talking about when I say upstate.\n\nI'm getting sidetracked. Sorry, that happens.\n\nThat weekend my aunt wanted to show me around Warwick. I was 16 now, and as my aunt now put it. \"Fun to hang with now that I'm not sucking my thumb anymore.\" whatever that means.\n\nWe jumped in her old Volkswagen golf that, by the looks of it, was only running on hopes and prayers. And headed down the way a bit to a small town called Sugarloaf. This was a place where my aunt felt right at home. If she belonged anywhere. It was here.\n\nThis hamlet of Hudson Valley was known for its lively artistic community. That was the perfect way to describe Beth. A lively artistic. Her place was full of sculptures and paintings. Whatever gallery nearby was hosting an event, that's the project she would be working on. My mom said she was the last of the hippies. My dad said she was an idiot. Not within earshot of mom, of course.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe town was loaded with craft stores. Vintage clothes. Herb and candle shops and places that carried homemade soap.\n\nThere were also a few places whose signs out front said Curiosity Shoppe, and shop was spelled with a \"PPE\" at the end, so of course, I had to go in and check it out.\n\nThis place offered Tarot card readings, Spiritual guidance, Chakra, and life readings. They also sold various oils, books, and little curated bags of spell kits. Each kit contained a spell candle, star holder, magic potion vial, mojo bag, and spell scroll, complete with directions! For 20 bucks, I grabbed a School Success kit. What the hell. When in Rome. \n\nWhat really caught my attention was the book with \"Lore of Staten Island\" written on the spine. A book about weird things from my hometown was something I had to go home with. I packed it away, glanced at it on the way back to Beths, and then that was it until Monday.\n\nI didn't think about the book until the ride home.\n\nSkimming through it, It was loaded with urban legends that took place on Staten Island. It was the curse of Seaview that took most of my interest. Everyone who grew up on Staten island knew about the Seaview homes and the things that went on there. The rumors about how they killed the patients in the tunnels under the hospital and burnt the bodies down there to try and stop the spread of tuberculosis. The Satanists and devil worshipers made the abandoned hospitals their ritual grounds.\n\nThere were also some things that I had never heard before. There was a whole write-up about a demon that was summoned on those grounds. And how it fed on children and dragged them into the shadows, never to be seen again. That's what I found the most interesting, and I couldn't wait to bring it to school to show my buddy Eric. He lived for this stuff. Plus, he was crazy enough to go with my idea of going to the hospital to have a little peak for myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat Tuesday, Eric and I met at the breezeway for lunch. What we've been doing every lunch period since freshman year. I was showing him the book, and we agreed on a time and day to go check some of these things out when Muscle Russel came bursting out of the doors behind us. Now, usually, this wouldn't mean anything to us. Live and let live ya know. But Russel had just come from the dean's office for pouring an entire carton of milk down the crack of some poor shmucks ass. The kid didn't even react. Just kept eating his lunch.\n\nFor his act of just plain meanness Russel earned himself a punishment of indefinite detention. As you can imagine, the dolt wasn't happy.\n\nEric was getting to the part of the book explaining the details of the curse that loomed over the Seaview hospitals when Russel stormed over to us, ripped the book out of Eric's hands, and threw it onto the roof of the gym.\n\nNow that would have been it. Neither of us felt like getting punched in the face. But it just so happened that Mr. Russo, the Math teacher, was walking out into the breezeway and witnessed the entire thing.\n\nRussel's detention turned into a 2-week suspension. His detention would be waiting for him when he got back.\n\nThis was something that Russel did not want.\n\nHe didn't have the best home life. And him being home for 2 weeks meant someone had to be home with him.\n\nA minor home alone was all the ammo his downstairs neighbor would need. She wasn't fond of Russel and his family.\n\nThis pissed the boy off and put a target on Eric and me. Luckily for us, it would be 2 weeks before Russel could have his revenge. Or so we thought. \n\nRussel heard more of our conversation than we thought and knew we were planning on checking out Seaview on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThat Saturday, Eric and I went over our plan. We met just around the corner from Seaview and couldn't wait to head in and check stuff out.\n\nWe had to be careful. The place was surrounded by a chain link fence topped with razor wire. There was also plywood stuck up in front of the wall to block the view of the buildings from the street which made for perfect cover once you were up and over.\n\nThat was part of the trick, though. Getting up and over without being seen. Sure, you could cut a hole in the wood and use bolt cutters, but that would be obvious. Someone would see the fence down and call it in.\n\nThe only way to sneak in was down the tiny dead-end street next to the hospital.\n\nThere was an old tree whose large branches grew over the fence, with its thickest one lying directly on top. You could climb right up and over with no problem.\n\nIf that is you could get past old mister Baker.\n\nPeople say he worked at the hospital as a groundskeeper before its closing in the 70s.\n\nHe has nothing better to do now than watch the old buildings and make sure no kids like us sneak in.\n\nEric had a plan, though. The Tree across from the Baker's house sat on the side. His house was on the corner, so the front door was on the main street. He mostly sat at his kitchen or bedroom window on the side of the house watching.\n\nEric decided to order a pizza at the man's house. It was brilliant. As soon as he was distracted at the front door, we would be up and over before he had time to close the door and make his way back to the window.\n\nThe plan was in motion and went off without a hitch. Or so we thought.\n\nWe weren't planning on Russel following us over the fence and Mister Baker seeing him climb it.\n\nOnce we got to the other side, we saw that plywood was lined with graffiti, but it was nonsense. Shapes and symbols. Just jibberish, really.\n\nI took out my phone and took some pictures of the graffiti.\n\nEric reached into his backpack and took out his flashlight and bolt cutters just in case any doors were chained up or we had to cut the padlock on the fence to make a quick getaway.\n\nWe walked up to the first building, supposedly used as housing for the nurses, and climbed into the smashed window on the first floor. The doorway was sealed up with cinder blocks.\n\nWe weren't inside for 5 minutes. Eric just had enough time to set his pack down and lean the bolt cutters against the wall next to the bag when we heard his voice.\n\nIt was Russel, and he was calling out to us.\n\nCalling us rats and saying we were dead and gonna get what was coming to us.\n\nThat was only some of what I heard, though. I heard whispers. Coming from the halls around us. Barely audible. No words I could clearly make out but definitely something.\n\nWe bolted up the steps and headed to the second floor. The building was huge. We planned to go up, double around him, and get over the fence.\n\nHe must of saw where we climbed in because he came in the same window and found Eric's cutters.\n\nWe spent the next few minutes ducking into rooms trying not to hyperventilate. Hoping the sound of my heart pounding out of my chest was only loud in my ears, and he couldn't hear it.\n\nRussel was now screaming about how he would use these cutters to snip off our fingers one by one. My first thought was to call the cops. This kid was clearly insane, but I had zero bars of service in here. Neither did Eric. These walls had to be thick with lead paint.\n\nA weird thing happened then. A taste of things to come.\n\nThe sun was still shining in through the windows. We were on the second floor and above most of the overgrowth from the grounds outside. It was starting to go down but still plenty bright. The shadows around us were beginning to stretch in our direction. Slowly at first and then quicker. Russel walked past the room we were hiding in right before the shadows reached us, and we decided to make our move. We were both smaller and definitely quicker than him. We can make it down the stairs, out the window, and over the fence way before him with a head start. \n\nWe took the shot.\n\nWe were stepping down the first few stairs before he could even turn around and onto the branch over the fence before we were at the window.\n\nWe crashed down to the ground right at the feet of Mr. Baker.\n\nHe wasn't happy. We tried to catch our breath and explain that this lunatic was chasing us with bolt cutters.\n\nBefore he could let us have it, though, we heard the sound of a snapping bolt and the thud of metal hitting the dirt.\n\nWith that, the gate on the corner swung open, and out stepped Russel.\n\nMr. Bakers' eyes went wide, and he shouted at Russel! \"No, You've broken the seal!!\" Just as a shadow stretched out from under him and pulled him into the ground. That's the best way I can describe it. Arms came out of the shadow and pulled Russel directly into the sidewalk.\n\nMr. Baker grabbed us by our shirt collars and hurried us into his house.\n\nCurrently, he is writing on his walls in pen, chalk, and markers. Anything he has around, really. The same markings that were on the fence. He's repeating over and over to himself. It's not gonna hold.\n\nThe sun is almost down now, and the shadows are getting longer. The house lights are not helping.\n\nEric went to the bathroom and hasn't come back yet. It's really quiet in there.\n\nMy phone's battery is dying. \n\nI'll probably get cut off soon, so I should end this before it does.\n\nIf anyone finds this phone and plays this voice memo, please. The book is on top of the gym building at Tottenville High school. There might be something in there that can get us back.",

        "text": "  \n\nImagine that we are not in the year 2023 but in a very distant future in which we were agreed to be 2023.\n\nAnd in the past of this future, macroscopic reality existed simultaneously in time, that is, the consciousness of each individual knew and experienced all of history as a whole.\n\nUntil one day, a scientific experiment at a certain time, ignited the blockage of the sensation of space-time as a whole and started to materialize all the energy that existed causing a funneling of reality into matter, that matter that seems solid to us.\n\nDreams are the last memories of what it was and what it was like to live in the wave and quantum state of reality.\n\nWill they one day be able to build a machine that reverses this situation again?\n\nChatGPT Answer:\n\nIt is difficult to predict whether one day humanity will be able to build a machine that reverses this hypothetical situation. However, we can consider some possibilities. First, it is important to note that the situation described involves concepts that go beyond our current scientific knowledge. We have no evidence that macroscopic reality ever existed simultaneously in time, nor that consciousness can know and experience all of history as a whole. Furthermore, the idea of ​​materializing all existing energy in the form of solid matter goes against some of the fundamental laws of physics, such as conservation of energy and relativity. That said, if humanity ever manages to build a machine capable of reversing this situation, it would be necessary to deeply understand the quantum nature of reality. This would include understanding how particles behave in a non-materialized state and how that behavior can be manipulated. Some research fields in quantum physics, such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography, are already exploring the quantum nature of reality to develop new technologies. It is possible that advances in these areas, combined with new discoveries in theoretical physics, could eventually lead to the creation of a machine capable of reversing the described situation.  \n \n\nIs it possible to really revert this, is there a way out? Will this urban legend be our reality? In which time this became possible or happened?  \n \n\nThis type of history could be true, what consciousness has to do with this machine and how would be possible to unravel this subject? Will be possible to chose which time or reality would we live in this undulatory state?   \n \n\nThese questions made us think about our reality and possibilities, will we ever achieve this? Became again as waves experimenting everything as a whole and choose in which time or live we should focus? Will we live forever in this time locked system? Till when?  \n \n\nThe answers are unknow by now, but I gess it triggered you curiosity to know which better life you should focus in this new world we would live.  \n \n\nI hope you liked this history, this urban legend hidden in the void of humanity locking itself to the suffering of the passage of time.",

        "text": "[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11aarni/ghosted/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)\n\n4\n\nI was hoping Jennifer would tell me more after that cryptic statement, but she clammed up. Damn, my whole visit turned out to be a bust. She did provide me with one insight – I’m not the only who might in danger. \n\nAkasha could come after Lynn. \n\nThe thought terrifies me. \n\nI couldn’t live with myself if anything happened to her. I conclude that I’m done with this amateur investigator shit and go straight to the cops. An hour later I find myself in a bustling squad room. But now that I’m sitting across from Detective Peterson and feel his scrutinizing gaze on me, I feel like I’ve made a mistake. In his mid-forties and clearly the world-weary kind of cop, he doesn’t suffer fools easily. At the moment he is trying to decide if I belong in the drunk tank.\n\n“Okay, to sum it up,” he says, checking his notes. “Your brother and his best friend hooked up with the same lady on Tinder, and you think she burned them alive?”\n\n*Dammit, I know how it sounds.* \n\n“And this cyber-sex version of a black widow killer is now after you?”\n\n“She’s been stalking me and my girlfriend! Who knows what this crazy bitch is going to do next?” \n\nMy raised voice doesn’t earn me any respect from Peterson. “You might want to turn it down a tad.”\n\nDetective Peterson peruses some police department records on his laptop. The first file contains pictures of Josh and his burned-up bedroom.\n\n“According to the fire department, there was nothing suspicious about the fire that killed your brother. It was an unfortunate accident. Case closed.”\n\n“They didn't have all the facts.” Detective Peterson’s patience might be running low, but he’s not the only one. \n\nI want to shout at the man, tell him about David who was found near the Starbucks parking lot burned to a crisp and all the others. But I lack concrete evidence for any of these assumptions. Keeping the story focused on Josh, Steve and my own experience sounds crazy enough.\n\n“So if this girl kills her cyber dates, why did she spare you?”\n\nIt’s a good question, one that I’ve been asking myself for the last few hours. Why am I still alive? What separates me from all her other victims? \n\n“I don’t know,” I say, and that’s actually when the answer hits me. I was spared because I didn’t give Akasha what she wants. Josh and Steve (and all the others, I presume) slept with her. I didn’t. My loyalty to Lynn triggered Akasha’s obsessive, stalker-like behavior, but it also could explain why she hasn’t burned me.\n\nYet.\n\nI’m smart enough to keep my mouth shut about this epiphany. Peterson must already think I’m doing drugs. I can imagine what his response would be: “*So this psycho chick is stalking guys who don’t put out?”*\n\nSounds crazy. But so does everything else about this case, as Peterson keeps reminding me. How does a nineteen year old woman torch dozens of men over a period of months without ever leaving a trace of forensic evidence? How does she manage to set up elaborate accidents or trigger fires that don’t spread? What am I really dealing with here? \n\nPeterson stops his stare-down contest. I guess he’s convinced I’m not high, which makes me either delusional or a skilled prankster. Either way, he wants me out of here so he can move on with his day and work real cases. \n\n“You’re free to file a complaint if you like,” he explains, “but without any forensic evidence, witnesses or motive, there's not much I can do.”\n\nThat’s it. Case closed. Time for a donut. I can’t even blame the guy. \n\n“You have to help me…” My voice shakes with helpless frustration. \n\n“Why don’t you show me this lady’s Tinder profile so I can include it in the report.”\n\nI hesitate for a moment before I open up Tinder and find Akasha’s profile. For a split second, I fear that she might have deleted her profile, almost as if she knew I might go to the cops. My fear proves unfounded. Akasha is still on Tinder ,and I share her profile with the grumpy Detective. Not that I think it will do much good.\n\nThe detective’s eyes turn into slits as he studies the profile.\n\nSomething in Peterson’s expression is different now. Where earlier I could only pick up his impatience, I now recognize a new emotion — suspicion. His next question catches me off guard. \n\n“You sure this is the girl you met up with?”  \n\n“Yeah.”\n\nPeterson nods pensively and says, “Let me show you something.” He indicates for me to follow him, and I oblige. You don’t want to argue with the NYPD. \n\nWe step outside the bustling office and arrive in an adjacent hallway. Peterson moves to a wall filled with the headshots of missing teens, mostly females. Each passport-style photograph is accompanied by pertinent details. Peterson points at one of the pictures and my breath hitches. \n\nIt’s Akasha. She’s got her own missing poster. My mind reels as I try to process this new piece of information.\n\n“Akasha Samona,” Peterson says. “Missing for ten months now. No one in her family has seen or heard from her.”  \n\n“I’ve met up with her twice in the last week alone.”\n\nThe words earn me another skeptical glance from the detective, and his frustration boils to the surface. He’s wondering what kind of game I’m playing. For a moment, he indulges me, probably hoping I trip myself up and reveal Akasha’s whereabouts. I’ve gone from potential victim to nuisance to suspect in the space of a few minutes.\n\n“You sure about this?” he asks.\n\n“Why would I be lying to you about something like this?”\n\nI can see that he’s itching to speak his mind, but he keeps it together. He’s a professional. \n\n“Normally when someone goes missing for this long, they either don't want to be found or something really bad happened to them.“ \n\nThe chilling implication sinks in. \n\nHe takes a step closer, and I have to repress the urge to back away. “Any idea where Akasha might be at the moment?”   \n\n“I only talked to her online before she started showing up places. I don't even have her number.”\n\nI can tell he doesn’t quite believe me.\n\nI can't take my eyes off the poster, mind consumed with one burning question.\n\n*What happened to Akasha?*\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI’m shaken by what I learned at the police precinct. In a trancelike state, I make my way to the nearest subway station and head back into Manhattan. I’m supposed to meet Lynn at the library, and she expects an explanation for why I skipped out on today’s crucial quiz, especially when my grade-point average is borderline. I’m not sure yet what I’m going to tell her. \n\nMy thoughts cycle back to Akasha. I replay our recent encounters in my mind and all throughout, Peterson’s words haunt me.\n\n*“Normally when someone goes missing for this long, they either don't want to be found or something really bad happened to them.“* \n\nA theory is forming in the back of my mind. My rational view of the world is fighting the idea, though. It can’t be...\n\nBy the time I reach downtown Manhattan, a new message waits for me. The text isn’t from Lynn but from Akasha.\n\nThe message sends a shiver down my back.\n\n“*Met your girlfriend. You could do so much better.”* \n\nHorrified, I call Lynn right away. No response. \n\nI ring again and leave voicemail. I send two texts. \n\nStill nothing. \n\nThe eerie, uncharacteristic radio silence continues.\n\n*What have you done, Akasha?*\n\nI know Lynn won’t be waiting for me at the library. My best bet is to head to her apartment in Astoria and hope that’s where I’ll find her. \n\nFor a terrible moment I worry that Akasha has harmed Lynn. Jennifer’s destroyed features surface in my mind.            \n\nAs I hit the road, I try to push my fears aside but fail miserably. \n\nI arrive at Lynn’s place. After letting myself in, I suddenly breathe easily when I realize she’s home. Alive and unharmed.\n\nMy relief is short-lived. \n\nShe’s been crying and her mascara runs down her cheeks in black streaks. Resting before is her laptop. Before I can utter a word, Lynn cuts me off. “Your new friend looked me up today. She couldn't stop talking about you.” \n\nI step closer. She holds up her cell phone. An unknown number has texted her screen grabs from my Tinder chat with Akasha including a damning shot of my own Tinder profile.  Lynn’s eye narrow behind the curtain of tears. \n\n“If you don't want to be with me anymore, then break up with me. But don't play games.”        \n\n“I swear to you, I can explain…”\n\n“Are you saying you didn't meet up with her the other day?”  \n\nIt’s a loaded question and I reply slowly. “I did, but here’s why...”\n\nThis is all Lynn needs to hear. I realize she’s already made up her mind about this, and who can blame her?\n\n“I know it looks bad, but it's a long story. I needed to talk to her about Josh...“\n\n“Stop lying to me-”\n\n“Lynn, please...”\n\n“Just tell me one thing, and don't lie. Did anything happen between the two of you?”\n\nMy little make-out session with Akasha flashes through my mind, and I hesitate. I’m a terrible liar. My wavering gaze confirms my guilt. Fighting back tears, Lynn says, “I think you should leave.”\n\n“Lynn, let me explain... This girl is dangerous. Josh is dead because of her...”\n\nInstead of helping my cause, this comment only makes things worse. Lynn glares at me, her tears making way for a growing rage. “Stop it. This is pathetic. I thought you loved me, Mark. But I guess I was wrong. Just get out. Please!”\n\nI’m about to plead with her when Lynn’s hostile stare stops me cold. Her pain is too fresh and raw for her to listen to my crazy tale of spontaneous combustion. This round goes to you, Akasha. \n\nAs I step out of Lynn’s place and head back to the street, I try to console myself by saying things could be worse. Akasha could’ve tried to harm Lynn physically. In a way, Lynn backing away from our relationship might keep her safe — at least in the short term.\n\nI debate my next move. \n\nPart of me is tempted to walk straight into the nearest bar and get loaded. But nothing will be gained from numbing my mind. Forty men died because of this girl, and I need to find out why.\n\nFor the moment, I roll with the punches. Something crazy is going on here, and I’d better get to the bottom of this mystery before it’s too late.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nMy car snakes its way down a winding road. The temperature has dropped and it’s snowing again. \n\nI pull up to a middle class, one-family house. A massive snowdrift weighs down the structure. Ominous icicles sprout from the edge of the roof like razor-sharp teeth. \n\nI park my beaten-up Honda and approach the property, which is enclosed by a wooden fence. The only sound comes from my shoes as they crunch the hard-packed snow.\n\nI reach the door and ring the doorbell. Waiting in silence, I watch my breath mist in the cold.\n\nApproaching footsteps grow audible. The door opens, revealing Akasha's mother. Mrs. Samona. I located her Flushing Queens address on the Internet while reading up on her missing daughter. \n\nI’m a little surprised that I’d never heard about Akasha’s case, as her disappearance made all the local news channels. Of course, this is New York City where people disappear on a daily basis. Media coverage of shootings, robberies and assaults present a ticker tape parade of life in the Big Apple. After a while, the stories blur together and one can’t keep track of the steady stream of human tragedy. \n\nAkasha lived with her parents until she disappeared ten months ago. As I take in the mother, I understand where Akasha got her striking looks. Mrs. Samona is middle-aged but well kept. Thanks to diet, exercise and genetics, she has launched a full-out assault against her advancing years. Akasha’s mom wears stylish athletic wear and despite the season she sports a dark complexion, courtesy of a tanning salon.\n\n“Mrs. Samona?”\n\nMrs. Samona studies me for a beat. There’s heat in her gaze, an air of sexuality.\n\n“You must be Mark Valentine. Please come in.”\n\nI called ahead, so she knows why I’m here. Or she thinks she does, at any rate.\n\nA few minutes later, I’m sitting on the couch. The sexual tension in the room cannot be denied. The way she eyes me, smiles, keeps squeezing my hand... For a moment I have a vision of Mr. Samona popping into the living room and suspecting the worst. \n\nAkasha’s mother pours herself a glass of wine. Must be time for an early happy hour. She offers me a glass, and I quickly decline, but she insists. I promise myself I will only nurse the drink.\n\n“You wouldn't believe the health benefits of red wine,” she says.\n\nI take my obligatory sip and say, “Thank you, Mrs. Samona.”\n\n“Call me Jane.” She smiles. “So how can I help you?”\n\n“As I told you on the phone, I'm a journalism major and I’m doing a piece on missing teens.”\n\nThe best cover story I could come up with on short notice, it sounded plausible to me at the time but now I’m not so sure. Fortunately, Mrs. Samona doesn’t seem to question my reasons for being here, and I internally sigh in relief.\n\n“So you want to write about my daughter?”\n\n“I'm trying to give the story a human face.”\n\n*Am I laying it on too thick?*\n\n“Akasha would love this. She has a tendency toward the dramatic. A trait she inherited from her father.”\n\n“What do you think happened to her?”\n\nThis is a tricky question and I’m venturing into dangerous emotional territory. Fortunately, Mrs. Samona clearly doesn’t believe anything bad befell her daughter, or at least the armor of her denial doesn’t allow her to go there right now. “She ran away. To spite me. But she'll be back.”\n\nMrs. Samona drains her glass and pours herself another one. I begin to see the cracks in the chipper façade she’s constructed for herself. “This is just her way of telling me that I was a bad mother. I know my daughter.”\n\n*Do you really?*\n\n“You tried tracking her down?”\n\n“Her dad hired a private detective to search for her. He hit pretty much every strip club on the Eastern Seaboard. I hope they threw in a few free lap-dances for his efforts.”\n\nI’m beginning to realize that her callous attitude masks a frightened woman who isn’t quite sure that her daughter is all right, after all.\n\n“I'm sorry, Mrs. Samona. I mean, Jane... I was wondering if I could look around? To get a sense of who Akasha was...” I break off, cursing inwardly. Fortunately Mrs. Samona – Jane – is too buzzed to register my slip-up or take offense. Instead she says, “Her room is upstairs at the end of the hallway, to your right.”\n\nI wait for Mrs. Samona to escort me to Akasha’s room, but she just keeps gulping down her wine. \n\n*Awkward.* \n\nI guess she is giving me free rein to explore the house. \n\nI get up and head for the nearby staircase. A minute later I’m standing in front of Akasha’s bedroom. Pushing the door open, I feel like an intruder.\n\n*Like I shouldn’t be here.*\n\nI soak in my new surroundings. The bedroom is exactly what you’d expect from a rebellious young woman. Dark art and posters of edgy rock stars abound. I comb the bookshelves and spot various tracts on Eastern religion, anarchist politics, bios of cutting-edge musicians.\n\nI zero in on the computer sitting on a small desk. I touch the keyboard, half expecting Tinder to pop up on her desktop. But the screen remains blank.\n\nI continue searching the room and notice a framed photograph on Akasha’s nightstand.\n\nIt shows Akasha with a girlfriend who’s wearing a Starbucks uniform.\n\nShit, I recognize this Starbucks. This is where I first met Akasha. Someone scrawled a message over the picture with a black Sharpie: *Friends forever, Liza.* \n\nI make a mental note to ask Jane about her daughter’s friend Liza. \n\nBeside the bed I find a journal filled with dark drawings and weird writing. I don’t expect to discover any earth-shattering secrets within, but hopefully it’ll give me a better sense of Akasha’s character.\n\nIt doesn’t.\n\nAfter a few pages, the drawings and cryptic writing end. I realize that it’s more of a creative book of poetry or lyrics than a diary. \n\nThis all changes once I turn to the journal’s last page. \n\nAn eerie message stares back at me: *Why don’t you love me, Mark?*\n\nI drop the journal, gripped by a wave of terror.\n\nHow is this possible? \n\nFor a split second I can’t shake the sensation that Akasha is here in the room with me. My mind is reeling. How could this message exist? Did Mrs. Samona lie to me? Did Akasha come back? \n\nI must get out of this room. Out of this house. Away from the madness that has invaded my life. I want things to go back to the way they were before I met Akasha. \n\nAs I storm back down the stairs, Mrs. Samona says, “That was quick. Find everything you needed for your story?”\n\nI nod and quickly leave the house. Outside, it’s finally stopped snowing. The looming snowdrifts and frosted trees glitter with ice. Somehow their shapes are now imbued with a sinister quality. \n\nAs I stomp across the white expanse, the long winter shadows are heavy and the Samona home slowly recedes behind me. Suddenly I pause, beads of sweat bursting on my forehead. \n\n*As if the temperature has shot up thirty degrees.*\n\nI unbutton my jacket and remove my hat. A splashing sound draws my attention. With each step I take, the snow beneath my feet grows more watery. It’s melting at incredible speed...\n\nI stop dead in my tracks as I pick up another noise. \n\n*CRACK-CRACK-CRACK.* Slowly, I turn...\n\nMy eyes lock on the icicles hanging from the Samona house. The ice cracks and flexes...\n\nRight before my eyes, the snow on the roof evaporates and sheets of water cascade down the side of the house. The small waterfall is a surreal sight. \n\nI stare open-mouthed as it dawns on me that I’m now standing in a giant puddle. Part of me wants to start screaming.  \n\nLEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE!\n\nInstead, I jump into my car and take off. \n\nI know exactly who I need to talk to next.\n\nI must return to the place where this madness started.",

        "text": "I awoke to the sound of a knock on my front door followed by a familiar “Hello?”. It took a few moments for me to comprehend my situation. I had a splitting headache like I'd never felt before. The pain from my stings might not have been as severe as they were last night but it was still present. On top of all of this, I had fallen asleep in my bathtub and had slept at such an agonizingly weird angle that my legs had fallen completely asleep. On top of all of this, I now had a severe neck cramp. I swear it took all the willpower in my body just to recognize that the person knocking at my door was the exterminator and with all the energy I could muster I shouted as loud as I could “I'll be right there!”.\n\nLuckily, my bathtub is a piece of shit. Over the course of last night, my water had slowly drained off by itself so I wasn't a completely sopping wet pruney mess. It still took me a few minutes to eventually open the door for the exterminator though as I had to get dressed, down 3 aspirin, and splash some cold water on my face.”\n\n“Are you ok there ?” he said as I opened the door. I imagine that my delayed response toppled with the ghastly appearance I must have exhibited aroused a fair amount of concern.\n\n“Hey man, I'm sorry for taking so long. I had a rough night and slept in.” I said while reeling from the sunlight that was now piercing my eyes and seemingly stabbing me in the brain in a way that caused me to wince in pain.\n\n“Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that sir.” He said, sounding genuinely concerned. \" what happened? If you don't mind me asking”\n\nI told him the story as I walked him to my room. Neglecting to tell him the part about the ants standing on my nightstand watching the entire event occur.\n\n“ Oh my word! That sounds awful! Well don't you worry sir, I'll make sure we take care of this problem today,” he said, patting my shoulder in an attempt to comfort me.\n\nAs he began to inspect my room he noted the number of ant traps I had strewn about my house. With a slightly concerned tone, he told me“If you've really taken all these actions that you say you have, then my only conclusion is they must have a nest somewhere in the walls or, maybe even under the floorboard.”\n\nWe talked for a little bit about options and where to proceed. Eventually deciding to drill holes into my walls at key locations to lay down bait traps and spray pesticides. Once he was done he bid me farewell and left. I followed shortly after and headed to work.\n\nAs I arrived back at my house later that day I instinctively checked the stretch of dirt outside my front door. When I did so, I found 2 new Anthills. Fear, annoyance, and any other emotion I had felt towards my intruders up until that point all faded away, and were replaced with pure unadulterated rage.\n\n“God Damn It!” I shouted before kicking up dirt all over the hills.\n\n“God Fucking Dammit!” I shouted a little louder as I began to viciously stomp on the two anthills over and over again to the point where I swear if there were some sort of cave underneath the hills, I would have broken through the earth itself and fallen in. After about 7 good stomps I found myself a little out of breath and while standing over the hills turned to face the road. A Woman who was walking her dog stood there with a look of confusion mixed with a hint of fear. I raised my hand to attempt to explain myself but before I could do so, she fled down the sidewalk. Leaving me alone with my unwanted guests.\n\n“Fuck” I muttered to myself before kicking dirt over the now decamated anthills, and heading inside.\n\nI couldn't get to sleep that night. I remember specifically the feeling of being watched was more intense that night than it had ever been up until that point. It mattered not if I faced the wall, away from it, or straight up, I couldn't evade it. With a deep sigh and a rub of my eyes, I resigned myself to go watch some tv for a few hours in hopes of passing out somewhere down the road. I sat on the edge of my bed and turned on my nightstand lamp.\n\nAs the light illuminated my room and I could now see my surroundings, I spotted them. Just like the night before, there were once again 2 sentinel ants watching me from my nightstand. Remembering the horror of the night before I immediately patted down my body, expecting to be covered with the ants once again. I quickly realized however that there were none to be found. I slowly turned my gaze up from my body to the ants and knelt forward to get a closer look at them. They stood there staring back at me, and soon enough it was as if we were both analyzing each other.\n\n“What the fuck are you?” I muttered to myself.\n\nI stretched my hand out and hovered it above the ants in an attempt to get them to move. They did not.\n\n“Why don't you react?” I asked as  I began to rapidly wave my hand back and forth above them.\n\nFinally, in a bid of frustration, I stood up and made a swatting motion toward the ants like I was about to smash them onto my table. They finally reacted and moved backward to avoid my hand. I stopped my hand midair however and chuckled to myself.\n\n“I got you, little bastards,” I said, moving my hand backward.\n\nThe ants stood there staring at me back. After a few seconds that seemed to drag on for hours, I laughed to myself about the craziness of what was happening. Eventually, I shook my head to snap myself from the never-ending staring contest and went to the floor by the foot of my bed to grab a can of bug spray. When I turned around to rid myself of the ants, however, they were gone. As if they saw what I was about to do and fled before I could take action. I spent the remainder of that night watching god-awful late-night television Eventually passing out somewhere around 3 am.\n\nThe sound of my backup alarm going off finally woke me up. I immediately recognized it as the alarm I used for when I would sleep in the parking lot of the car wash.\n\n“Oh, shit” I muttered to myself before rolling off my couch and making a mad dash for my keys and shoes. I had 10 minutes to be at a place that was nearly a 25-minute drive away.\n\nAs I started speeding my way to work, in a vain attempt to somehow make it there in time, I began to rehearse my “I'm sorry” speech to my boss. I say  ‘began” because I was quickly interrupted by the sensation of a sting on the back of my neck. Then another, then another, then another just like 2 nights ago I began to feel stinging all over my body. I jerked and twisted my body in response to the newfound pain but it did little to ease my situation. I started to see them crawling all over my hands and arms. How they had gotten into my car was a question I couldn't begin to think about at that moment in time. I looked into the rear view mirror and could see them all over my neck and shoulders. They were swarming me and stinging me all over my body. Once the realization of what was going on settled into my mind and the pain began to permeate every square inch of me I started wildly swatting all over my body in a vain attempt to free myself from the ants. Causing my car to begin swerving erratically all over the road. A particularly large sting nipped my in the patch of skin between my left shoulder and neck. Acting on pure instinct I lunged over to attempt to swat the ant stinging me there. When I did so, the motion of my arm caused my elbow to lean across the steering wheel, and send my already speeding car straight into one of the old oak trees that lined the road.\n\n\nI awoke in the hospital a few hours later with a cast on my right forearm and a headache that made the one from the day before seem like a fleeting memory. The doctors told me that I had a concussion, a fractured rib, and had broken my wrist in 3 spots upon impact with the tree. When they asked me what happened I opened my mouth to tell them, but quickly closed it as I realized that the pain from the stings were completely gone. I pulled up the medical robe I was in and looked down at my chest. There was nothing. No sting marks or any other indication that the ants had ever attacked me in the car.\n\n“How long was I out?” I asked the doctor.\n\n“You've been knocked out for about” he stopped to pull up his watch “ 8 hours now”.\n\n“Did the stings fade away that fast?” I thought to myself. “ They were gone in the morning yesterday too.”\n\n“I uh,” I thought to myself for a moment about what to say. “ I fell asleep at the wheel,” I said, trying to sound as honest as I could. There was no proof that I was attacked by the vile creatures. They had made sure of it. I couldn't tell them “ i was swarmed by and attacked by ants.'' when there was no proof of the event ever occurring. They'd think I was high or something.\n\n“ That's what we thought,” he said as he began to write onto a clipboard.” your bloodwork came back clear of alcohol so we figured it had to be something else. Well son you're gonna be getting all the sleep you could ever dream for. When you never showed up for work your boss called your phone and we answered it for you. We told him what happened and he told us to tell you that you're going to be getting 2 weeks of paid leave while you recover a little. He said he'll have you doing light duty when you get back, something about a cash register I think.”\n\nI chuckled to myself and nodded. After a day of evaluation, I was allowed to return home. I had to call a taxi however, my car was rendered undriveable by the accident.\n\nAs I opened the door to my home, dread didn't even begin to describe the emotion that swept over me like a tidal wave.  It was the most soul crushing sense of impending doom I had ever known in my entire life. As I closed my front door it only grew more intense. After a few moments of standing there, taking in the dimly lit apartment, I slowly lowered myself into my couch and stared at the powered-off tv. As I did so, I spotted the ant that was running along the top of my tv. A newfound sense of anger boiled up within me and with one swift motion I grabbed my tv remote and chucked it at the ant. I had to use my left hand however due to the cast, which caused the remote to fly dead center at my tv screen, resulting in my tv being now effectively dead. I sat there in stunned silence for a few moments before dropping to my knees and beginning to hyperventilate.\n\n“Think man, think!” I said to myself between strained breaths trying to calm myself down.\n\n“What the fuck do I do ?'' I exclaimed in the vague hope some invisible higher power would tell me the answer and rid me of this nightmare. When no such enlightenment came and I had finally caught my breath, I sat back against the bottom of the couch and called the exterminator once more.\n\n\n“So what are my options now?” I asked after informing him that the ant problem had still not gone away.\n\n“Well, if the infestation truly has lingered on this long my suggestion would be attempting fumigation of your apartment,” he said\n\n“Fumigation?” I asked\n\n“Yes sir, the only 2 problems with that being that 1) it's a very lengthy and expensive process and 2) since you're in an apartment complex with other tenants living all around you, you would need to get them to sign off on it. Specifically, you would need at least 2 neighboring tenants to sign off on having seen the infestation along with you. That way we could fumigate the whole apartment block that you're on.”\n\nI sat there in silence for a moment. Contemplating who to ask for a signature, and also contemplating whether or not fumigation would even work at all.\n\n“Ask your neighbors for their signatures sir, as soon as you've gotten them give me a call back and I'll work out the details for the procedure with your landlord,” he said sounding a bit impatient with my silence”\n\n“Will do,\" I muttered before placing my phone down and sinking deeper into the floor. I could still see the ant watching me from on top of the tv. I walked by it and headed to my bedroom to sleep, it was all I wanted to do at that moment.\n\n“Wake up”\n\nI was awoken a few hours later by a voice whose origin I had no earthly idea came from. I looked around my room but saw nothing. After sitting upright in my bed , staring into the darkness of my room for a few seconds I shrugged it off as a dream and reluctantly slowly lowered my head back onto my pillow. The second I made contact with it I heard it again.\n\n“I said wake up!” the voice sounded annoyed this time.\n\nI willingly obeyed its command and with one motion shot straight out of bed and turned on my light. Half executing to see an ax wielding murder of some kind standing beside me I was taken aback to discover not an indication of life inside of my room. After sitting in the light for a few tense moments I began to feel my eyes water up as a cold chill ran down my spine. The feeling of eyes on the back of my neck was so strong I swear it was as if someone had placed a blanket over it. I wanted nothing more in that moment than to cower back into my bed and hide under the covers, but I knew what I had heard. Someone was in my house, and I had to protect myself. I slowly owned my dresser drawer and took out my only means of protecting myself at that given moment, a small leatherman multi-tool, retracted the pitifully small knife attachment from it and began to sweep my house. I took it one room at a time. \n\nBedroom,\nClear.\nHallway,\nClear.\nBathroom,\nClear. \n\nOne at a time I made sure every square inch of my house was without any intruder. Eventually, I checked everywhere. Every room of my home lay baked in lights. Yet I found no one. This did nothing to calm my fears, as I stood in the center of my hallway I turned my head to the side, knife hand outstretched as I began to listen for any movement of the intruder. \n\n“Alex” the voice whispered\n\nI spun around so fast I didn't have time to bend my arm inward and when I swung I ended up leaving a cut mark on the left side of my hallway wall. There was no one there.\n\nI quickly spun back around the other way and began to slowly back myself out of the hallway and into the living room to make a break for the front door. When I reached the end of the hallway I thought I stopped dead in my tracks. The feeling of eyes was so strong at this point that I no longer felt it on my neck. It was everywhere.  My entire body shuddered with fear as everywhere all at once on my body I felt like I was being watched. I couldn't breathe, I just stood there frozen. Had the chill running down my spine not paralyzed me with fear I might have been able to taste the salt from the tears that were now running down both of my eyes. It was however not a factor at all at that moment. The only thing in my mind was a primal instinct to sprint for the door and leave. Yet I just stood there.\n\n“You took our home, Alex. It is only fair that we get to take yours.\" The voice spoke.\n\nI didn't know what to do. I wanted to make a run for it but the voice sounded so close to me that for all I knew the intruder was right behind me blocking off the door. \n\n“Where the fuck is he?” I thought to myself. \n\n“Where are you!” I began to ask the question out loud as intimidatingly as I could muster at that moment, when I was struck with a sudden epiphany. The voice sounded like it was right on top of me…\n\nI slowly turned my gaze to the right side of my body. The ant sitting on my shoulder stared back at me.\n\n“Alex,” the ant said once more.\n\nI felt bile rise in the back of my throat but forced it back down as I swiftly swatted the ant off of me and dropped to the floor, crawling back and watching it from the hallway wall. For a while, it struggled on its back but eventually, It found its equilibrium and got back onto its feet. Staring at me for a few moments before running under my couch and leaving me alone with my thoughts and fears. Soon after, the ant fled from my sight and I went to the bathroom to vomit. I slept in the bathtub that night. I didn't plan on doing so, but I spent so long hiding there that exhaustion must have eventually seized me. \n\n\nThe following day was spent living in what I can only begin to describe as all-encompassing fear. I quite simply just didn't know what to do. A part of me didn't believe the event of last night had truly happened at all and had chalked it up to a bad dream. The other part of me thought I was crazy. Even the smallest part of my psyche that believed the ordeal last night had occurred didn't know what to do. So I did nothing. So for a long time, I sat in my living room, trying to watch tv through the bottom left peephole that was the only part of the device that still worked anymore. I wasn't even truly trying to watch tv. Most of my mental energy was spent scanning the corners of my vision for any sight of the creatures and trying to think of a plan. After a few hours of anxiety-filled torment, I pulled out my phone and began to look for apartment ads near me. \n\n“Nothing,” I thought to myself.\n\nTo be more specific, nothing within my affordability. As I thought the word to myself I quickly found my thoughts interrupted by a familiar voice.\n\n“Run if you wish. We will follow. You owe us a home.” the voice spoke.\n\nI quickly scurried away from my couch and sat in the center of my living room floor as I attempted to make out the source of the voice. I felt my heart sink into the bottom of my stomach when I realized the voice was coming from all around me at once. As if my own walls were talking to me. Not knowing what to do I went to lie down in the bathtub.\n\n Like the night before I must have fallen asleep from exhaustion because the next thing I remember was waking up freezing from being in the tub for so long. For a while, I sat there contemplating what to do. I eventually pulled out my phone and called up mitchell\n\t\n“Alex! How are you man?”he asked. “I heard about that accident you got into. I tried calling a couple of days ago but you must've not heard me or some-”\n\n“I'm fine Mitchell,” I interrupted. “Thanks for the concern. listen, i was wondering if you had any other exterminators you could call or … I don't know, just anybody else who might actually be willing to help me out?”\n\nHe said nothing at first. “Exterminator? You mean for that ant problem you said you were having?\n\nAfter a few seconds of annoyed silence on my half I spoke up. “Yeah, THAT ant problem. Listen, the guy you've been having see me hasn't really helped the problem at all. He says he could fumigate the apartment block but i'd have to get people to -”\n\n“Fumigate?” he interrupted, sounding very surprised. “Woah woah, slow down there bud. Nobody's fumigating anything.”\n\t\n“Look I know it's an expensive process and god forbid you actually help take care of your tenants Mitchell, but I have a serious problem at my apartment and your guy hasn't done shit for me!” I yelled back at him.\n\n“My “guy” happens to be a very respected exterminator kid.” he said, sounding very annoyed.” If he says we gotta fumigate then by all means we’ll fumigate, but not until you offer up some solid fucking evidence of an infestation! “\n\n“What?” I asked.\n\n“I like to think I have been very patient with you and this entire situation Alex, but I am done wasting the exterminator's time with routine checkups to your apartment!” he said.\n\n“What are you talking about?” I asked.\n\n“What am I talking about? Kid, the guy didn't wanna be rude to your face and say you didn't have a problem. The truth is though that the last 2 times he's been over there he's called me back to complain about you wasting his time with an imaginary ant problem. He said that Every time he's been over to your place, he's never found any ants or signs of them being there.” he said \n\n“That .. that's not” I began before stopping mid-sentence.\n\n“Alex. Are you alright?” he asked softly.\n\nI hung up and set off to go talk to my neighbors.\n\n“Nope.” \n“Nope.”\n“Are you ok? You look terrible? Also nope” \n\nThese were essentially the answers I got from everyone in my apartment block. Not even my next-door neighbors said they had seen any signs of an ant infestation. The closest I got was one of the guys who lived 2 doors down saying he saw a few ants outside his house last week but that was it. I didn't have the signatures I needed to get the fumigation approved. I didn't have anywhere to go. With no other options, I went back to my apartment and slowly sank into the couch. \n\nThe way the living room lights illuminated my surroundings made my reflection very visible on the broken tv. The crack mark lay situated over the right side of my face. As I stared deeply into the tv I found my eyes going fuzzy. As if I were staring off into the space behind the tv. As I did this, I noticed the ants crawling up my legs from my reflection. Without ever once physically looking down at my body, I just stared straight ahead and watched them slowly swallow me up to my abdomen. It was as if I was disassociating from the world. The ants crawled even higher. Never once stinging me, just slowly enveloping my body. They eventually stopped once they reached my shoulders. Without actually looking down it was impossible to tell but there had to be at least a thousand of them on me.\n\n“We are your problem, not theirs.” the ants all seemed to speak in unison.\n\n My fugue-like state was quickly broken and reality came crashing down onto me like an anvil from up high as I stood straight up and began to swat them all away. When they were all finally off of me I stood there and watched them scatter in all directions to safety. \n\nOnce they were all gone the voice spoke from all directions yet again. \n\n“So be it.”\n\nI clenched my one good hand into a fist and screamed out in a mixture of frustration, fear, and anger that all seemed to rise up at once.\n\n“Get out of my house!” I screamed before going to the kitchen to grab the hammer from under the sink” \n\n“Get the fuck out of here!” I yelled as I swung the hammer into the wall above my living room couch”\n\n“Where the fuck are you little demons? Get out! “ I screamed as I swung my hammer from wall to wall. Occasionally I would see a few of the ants in the holes I created before they would quickly scurry deeper into the walls to evade me. I attempted to hit them as soon as I saw them but they were fast and more often than not my hammer missed the same spot and I would just end up leaving a fresh hole instead.\n\nHow long this went on for I honestly do not recall. I was locked in the jaws of anger and completely at its mercy. The only thing I wanted at that moment was the death of the ants who had tormented my life and invaded my sanctuary for far too long. I only stopped due to the pounding on my door.\n\n“What the fuck is going on in here?” my neighbor  Ron yelled at me through the door sounding very annoyed. “ It sounds like a damn tornado over here!”. I placed the hammer on my table and opened the door.\n\n“Hey ro-” I was quickly interrupted. \n\n“Don't you “Hey Ron, me! What the fuck is going on in this house ? sounded like you were tryna tackle your way through the damn wall!” \n\n“ Im … sorry” I began “I was just trying to … kill a few ants.” \n\nHe stared at me in disbelief for a few seconds before speaking. “Ants? Coulda told me you were fighting a tiger in here. Id've believed you too.”\n\n“I know I know I'm sorry,” I said, choked up with embarrassment. Rons sudden arrival had completely snapped me out of my rage-filled haze and as I looked to my left to survey my handy work,  I was now appalled by the scene I had created in my home. We stared at each other for a few more moments as I couldn't think of anything else to say other than feeble apologies. Eventually, I said the only thing I could think of.\n\n“Ron, you haven't seen any ants around your home have you?”\n\nHe looked over my shoulder, and judging from the widening of his eyes and the pale look on his face, it was safe to assume he could see what I had done too.\n\n“No … no I haven't,” he said slowly backing up “ if I hear you going ape shit like that ever again so help me I will call the cops Alex!” \n\nWith that, he backed up all the way into his apartment and left me there alone in the doorway. I slowly closed the door, took a few steps back into my living room, and dropped to my knees. As soon as I did so, my walls began to start murmuring. I once again decided to make a phone call.\n\n\n\n“Hello? Alex, is that you?” my boss asked. “What can I do for you? You're supposed to be resting.”\n\n“Yeah, I know I know,” I replied. “ Listen, I know I still have about a week's worth of leave left but do you think it would be ok if I came back to work early? I've been feeling really cooked up and I just really need to get out of this house and focus on something else.”\n\n“Something other than what?” he asked\n\n“ Umm, something other than … tv” I weakly replied.\n\nHe took a deep breath and said “well you know i'd never turn down help around the carwash, but unfortunately you coming back early would be a liability.\n\n“A liability? I asked” the murmuring had grown louder\n\n“Yeah, a liability” he reiterated. “ the hospital said you need at least weeks of rest. If I were to let you come back to work and you hurt yourself somehow, I'd be held accountable for it”\n\n“ Sir, please let me come back” my eyes began to start watering. “ I promise you I'll be extra careful I'll … I’ll do cash register duty or whatever else you think is safest just please let me come back early,\" I begged him.\n\nHe replied “I'm sorry kid but no can do, you enjoy your rest and I'll see you next week” \n\n“Wait!” I said before being cut off by the click of him hanging up.\n\nI chucked the phone across the room and watched it shatter as it hit the kitchen wall, and slowly crawled backwards to rest my head against the front door. From where I was sitting I could see a dozen ants or so devouring a half-eaten bag of chips on my kitchen table. With no more options at my disposal and a newfound sense of hopelessness, I ignored the ants and walked to my bedroom to go to sleep. What else was there to do?\n\nI didn't go to sleep that night, I just lay there flat on my bed staring straight up at my ceiling. The murmuring in my walls had never ceased. It continued on and on for a couple of hours until eventually, all at once it stopped. No more whispers or indistinguishable voices could be heard from all around me anymore. I took a deep breath and rolled over to face away from the wall and finally try to get some sleep. My plans were interrupted by the discovery of a single ant watching me from my nightstand. Almost instantly I shot out of bed and stood up. After a few tense seconds, I spoke to it first.\n\n“I'm sorry. Is that what you want to hear? I'm sorry! I destroyed your home and I'm sorry!” \nThe ant said nothing. It just stared back at me.\n\n“Say something!” I shouted at it impatiently “what do you want from me!”\n\nAfter a few more seconds of silence, the ant finally spoke. “ You owe us a home, Alex.”\n\nAs soon as the words were spoken the murmuring began again, only not from any of my walls this time, but from one clearly identifiable origin point. The voices were coming from my bed. As I made this discovery I slowly opened up my dresser drawer and pulled out my leatherman pocket knife and one of my many cans of bug spray and slowly approached the side of the bed. The ant on my dresser moved closer to inspect what I was doing but said nothing. With the bug spray being held out in my damaged arm I aimed it at the bed and slowly began to cut a hole in the side of my mattress. As the seams of it came apart I was met with the discovery of a sea of black made up of hundreds of thousands of ants that began to rapidly dart away in all directions.\n\nI immediately recoiled in disgust and as I dropped to the floor I began to spray the poison wildly in front of me, desperate to kill the ants. My actions were quickly interrupted by a loud voice that spoke with more malice and hatred than I knew existed in the world.\n\n“YOU WILL NOT HARM ANOTHER NEST!” \n\nAs the voice spoke I felt the walls around me start to rumble. As they did so the murmuring grew louder and before I could even register what the voices ants were saying, A large black tentacle shot out of the hole I had cut into the side of the mattress. It lashed out at me like the finger of Satan himself and as it swat across my chest I was able to see that it wasn't a tentacle at all. It was hundreds of thousands of ants all coalesced into a single tentacle-like shape. The tentacle writhed and swung wildly at me but maintained its shape the entire time. as I lay there on the floor looking up in horror, I Couldn't believe what I was seeing. The ants were moving with a shared consciousness. Acting on instinct I scrambled back onto one knee and began to douse the mass of ants with my can of bug spray. This had seemingly no effect, however. Apart from a few dozen ants falling to the floor, the ants held their structure steady. After a few seconds of my retaliation, the tentacle quickly shot even further out of the mattress and began to grow and grow and grow. Never taking my finger off of the spray button I simply fell back to the floor in horror as I watched the tentacle morph into an indistinguishable black tidal wave that began to envelop my entire field of vision, and soon after my legs.\n\n The stinging began almost immediately and as the pain in my legs became so intense I felt like I was going to pass out, the murmuring turned to screaming. I wish I could recall what they were saying, I really do. At that moment, however, I was encompassed by a primal instinct that limited my mental capacity to one task. Run. I rapidly began to scoot back, kicking my legs the entire time to get the ants off of me. The entire time more ants poured out of my mattress and made the tidal wave of ants grow even higher and higher. As soon as I was able to get to my feet I turned and ran for the door. As I did so I could hear the collective ants behind me growing louder and louder. With one swift motion, I swung the door open and as I stepped into the safety of my lit hallway the voices reached their height in one last act of defiance.\n\n“ALEX!” they spoke before being cut off as I slammed the bedroom door shut. The second I did so, the voices immediately stopped. No more murmuring, no more rustling of the ants, it all simply stopped at once. I propped a chair against the bedroom door and hunkered down in my bathroom for the night.\n\nWhich finally leads us here, the present. Ever since that night, I've been holding up in my kitchen. I’ve consolidated what remaining cans of bug spray remained in my home and I've been sitting with my back to a corner of the wall for the last 3 days waiting for the swarm to return. It hasn't yet, but I can't give them an opportunity to sneak up on me. I can't risk falling asleep and letting them get me. I can't risk them getting anyone else. These demons can not be allowed to spread. I won't let them.\n\nAs I've been writing this over the last hour, the gas valve on my stove has been running the entire time. I don't know if the ants know what I'm planning but I do know that the murmuring has returned, and over the last hour it's been growing louder and louder.  There's a lighter in my kitchen drawer, and as soon as I submit this story, I'm going to use it to destroy these creatures once and for all. There's a shared fire alarm system in my apartment block. I pulled it about 5 minutes ago and sincerely hope everyone within range has gotten out. I can't wait any longer. The feeling of eyes on my neck has returned and even though I've grown immune to the paralyzing effect it had on me, I know what it means. The ants are watching me. They know what I'm planning and will surely try to stop me. I'm sorry.\n\nIf there were any words of wisdom I have left in my tattered shell of a psyche, I doubt they would be of any worth. The only thing I can think of to impart onto you is this:\n\n“We like to think we are the masters of our domain, but the sobering reality is that we are masters of nothing. The creatures that inhabited this earth before us will continue to do so long thereafter. Leave them be, and if you're lucky they will do the same. And for the love of god, stay away from anthills.”",

        "text": "So when I was in elementary school I had a disturbing experience. I would walk home every day from school. Between driving around town and my house I eventually made a map in my head of how I could get home. There was 3 ways one of the was the usual one that my parents taught me and wanted me to take. The second one was a scenic route I would walk through a decent neighborhood and the walk across a street. And the third one is where this took place. This path would be half my usual route but I would walk a few houses down more then usual and then 2 turns. So basically one day I was walking the usual way home with a couple buddies we got to a cross walk and 2 of the split of we said r goodbye’s and then there was one friend left. This friend lived along my third path home so I walked with him to his house. Then I continued towards my house but 2 houses down from his there was a house with cars and crap in its yard and porch.\n\nSo also on this porch there was weird fat bearded guy. And as I walked by he called out and said “hay you’re backpack is open”. I heard this and looked at him then my backpack it was open so I closed it and was about to go on my way. And then he said “you want some thing to drink? Now let’s just add that I’m like 10 or 11 and I know my stranger danger shit pretty well. So I get that feeling and said “no thanks have a good day”. I walked on and never thought about it again it was in the back of my mind from time to time but like I said never gave it enough attention. So flash forward a couple years Im 13 or so and I’m watching this true crime,disturbing stream on twitch of this guy watching that stuff and one of the cases that he covered was about TW: CP and molesters\nAnd these people that did some fucked up shit. So after that I was like maybe I should check one of those maps with the information of where they live and there names so I could see if some of them live near me. \n\nAt the time I was at a different house the that one but I still lived there. So I looked at the map and I checked my house and there was one or to in a couple neighborhoods near my and I clicked the one closest to my house and you know where this is going it IS HIM HE IS A MOLESTERS. the worst part is his back yard is right next to mine like I could see his back yard and I was sitting there just mortified. So I asked my parents y and if they knew that the house I grew up in was next to you know a MOLESTER. Come to find out they had problems with him in the past. This is getting to long so do you want a part 2?",

        "text": " January 18th,\n\nDear diary, another beautiful day.\n\nI woke up at 6, I took a shower and got ready for work. My wife was in the kitchen, she didn’t make me breakfast again, my son was watching TV, I left.\n\nWork was normal today, I was trying to get a client to come onboard, it went well, I went to meet her in a cafe a couple hours ago, all went well, she will be in for the important day tomorrow. I like my job.\n\nMy wife and son are both smelling bad. I told them to get a bath, I have a session with the doctor today, then I will go to sleep.\n\nJanuary 19th,\n\nDear diary, another beautiful day, I woke up early at 6, from now on, I will write down my thoughts every hour or so in more detail, just like the doctor told me to do in our last session, and anything I want to explain to myself, I guess I am already explaining this explanation? I don’t know, anyways it’s just a diary. She says writing and reflecting back on my thoughts will help me with my condition. Right now I will nap a bit and then get ready for work, the doctor said it’s good I stick to a routine.\n\nI snoozed my alarm, then I realized it’s 7, fuck I was gonna be late for work, I cannot be late for work, my boss will be angry at me, I don’t want boss to be angry at me, I love my job. I run out of bed and start getting ready. It’s a beautiful day as the cold and blue sunset flares on my face and in the kitchen as I come to kiss my wife goodbye, the poor thing is always up in the kitchen when I wake up, no matter how early. I tell her I can’t have breakfast and I must run to get to work, today is one of those important days in the office. My son is sitting on the sofa watching TV like always, I just shout at him that I am running to the office and not to bother his mom too much, he is such a well behaved kid though, never does anything wrong, always just quietly watching TV all day long, I guess he got it from his mom, she is very introverted too.\n\nI hope he gets a job, I think as I walk to the office, or maybe I can refer him to work with me? He is quite old to be watching TV all day long. He is old enough to have a family of his own, maybe I can help him with that too. I like helping my family whenever I can. My dad didn’t exactly help me much but he taught me how important it is to always take your job seriously! He also worked in an office you know, like me.\n\nIt’s 8:30. I got to the office a few minutes late and profusely apologised for being late. The boss is not happy this early in the day, but he lets it pass this time. I am very grateful for my boss and my job, I love my job. I immediately get to the tasks at hand. I gotta be productive and get ready for the important day again. Boss says that I must never do anything wrong on the important day. My coworkers belittle and bully me, I don’t like them much, they always say I am not good enough and distrust me. One day I will show them, I will get promoted one day and that’ll show them. Luckily I have my job and I like it very much. I am so thankful to the boss for this opportunity.\n\nIt’s 9 now. I’m tired because I didn’t have breakfast again (my wife never gives me breakfast, what is wrong with her? Isn’t that what wives are supposed to do???), but the boss says that is part of it, suffering through our hard work is how we show The Board and The Director how committed we are.\n\nIn the beginning I used to be quite careless at my job, now that I look in retrospect, so many details going unchecked like making sure I know their contacts and that the initial meet happens at a convenient hour. But I have become good at it, I know how to search, how to follow through, how to contact the clients, meet with them and bring them onboard for the projects. I successfully got one client for the important day today. It was hard work for the past weeks but I am very proud of it. I made sure everything is covered, every detail that I used to miss, no loose ends. The boss is happy with it, I guess this is why he let it pass that I got to work late today, he is usually not kind like that, he takes his job very seriously.\n\nIt’s 10 now. The boss came to my desk and asked if everything was ready with the client, I said confidently that it was. I have issues with my confidence sometimes, but today I am more committed than ever. The boss smiles at me and says “good work”, I am very happy, I love my job more than ever!\n\nIt’s 11 o’clock. I went through everything again to make sure all is ready for the big day, I cannot fail like last time. My boss came along and said they picked her up, he said she has all the resources and experience they need for the project. He smiles at me again. He doesn't usually smile. They’ll be at my place today for the meeting, as usual. You know, the initial reason I joined this company is because my place is perfect for meetings, a very big house with conference rooms away from the city, boss says the office is too close to the city centre, The Director is very specific about the places that the company conducts business in. I was just subletting my conference room to them to earn something extra on the side, but when they met me and my family at the time, they realised I can be useful to them and gave me a job offer! I had lots of interviews with the boss though, they are careful with whom they hire. I never met The Board or The Director, they are way beyond my pay level, but I know they have extremely high standards and specific requests, they are quite eccentric as one may say.\n\nSometimes I hear voices in the office, but there is no one nearby.\n\nThough I've never seen The Director, never even caught a glimpse of him, I've caught one or two members of The Board few times, as usually one of them comes to check on our work, though I never spoke with any of them, but I know, and everyone here knows very well, we must be very careful not to upset any member of The Board and especially The Director. I know the boss is scared of them, which must mean they are very important, the boss is not scared of anything else.\n\nIt’s 12. The boss is still at my table looking at my work with a very long grin on his face, he never smiles but today he had this grin for hours, his black eyes just fixated on my screen. \n\nBefore I could say anything about the future prospective clients I am researching, the boss said that The Board will be at the meeting as well! I never talked with them, maybe won’t as I am never in the room when they are conducting business, but I will be hosting The Board in my home! And since The Board will be there, it means there is a chance for the Director himself to come there as well! I am euphoric, I can’t wait to go home and tell my wife who’s coming to visit. I also found a note on my desk written “Stop it”, it must be my goddamn coworkers, those cunts, I wish I could slit their throats.\n\nSometimes when I am home and I am not looking, my wife and son start whispering behind my back.\n\nIt’s 1. I usually leave just after 4, but today I could go early as I usually do on the important day to get things ready at home. I opened the door to see my son resting on the sofa. I try to find my wife but I can’t find her. Damn, she should always be here when we have a meeting. Everyone likes her, even my coworkers, and especially my boss. Today is a very special important day and The Board is coming. I should find her but first I will prepare the conference room while I think on what to do.\n\nIt’s 2. I went to grab the materials from the attic and to my surprise I found my wife there. I let out a sigh of relief, she must have been grabbing the materials herself, she knows today is the important day. I am so lucky to have her, she understands how crucial my job is, and damn I like my job.\n\nI tell her to meet me downstairs later, she doesn't move, just sits there looking out the window and with a fearful expression on her face, the poor thing must be anxious, she is quite timid you know, doesn't talk much. My son is exactly the same, it seems sometimes they don’t wanna move. Sometimes I have to grab my wife and my son and put them to bed, because they refuse to go themselves. \n\nEvery now and then I lose track of time when I am home, I just cannot remember what happened for a few minutes or so, and I find myself in another room.\n\nIt’s weird I have to take them to bed myself. My wife and son walk a lot through the house when I am not home or when I am sleeping, so I started locking the bedroom doors when I need to go to bed, the house creaks and makes all sorts of noises when they start walking and running around, sometimes they start making loud noises, how can I sleep like this?? I need to sleep to do my job properly! Goddamn those two. Every time the meeting would happen in the conference room, they both got this anxious expression on their faces. I used to lock them and myself in the bedroom to not disturb our guests. What if they start screaming? But once boss found out about them, he liked it much better when they were around. He always says I have a knack for finding good women. I think so as well, I like my current wife, she is very agreeable, my son is a nice addition.why\n\nIt’s 2:45, I went for a small sandwich, my wife doesn’t cook anything, sometimes I think she’s quite useless. I found the new pills my doctor gave me today in the cupboard, I never told her that I don’t take the pills, everytime I stare at them for too long, the voices come back. Anyway I flushed them down so hopefully they stop, last time I took anything the doctor gave me, I don’t remember almost half of my day and when I came to my senses I was in the street in front of the police station, I just walked there myself, so weird so weird. I think I should stop seeing the doctor, she doesn’t help me, and besides, work is going so well! Anyways, time to finish preparations.\n\nI don’t know where or how or what or when or who I am.\n\nIt’s 3, they will be here soon, I told my family to get to the living room, they refuse to obey, I will move them myself as soon as I get the room ready, so much disrespect! Why can’t they behave like a family!\n\nIt’s 3:25, they arrived some 10 minutes ago, I am so honoured to host The Board, all of them look so professional and serious. They are wearing white robes and hats covering their faces. One of them was carrying the client, my client! She was naked and being carried over his shoulder. This meeting looks much more serious than the previous important days. \n\nMy boss is also there, also in a robe of his own but different from those of The Board members.there is notime He is still smiling the same grin from hours ago, he tells me I did a good job and today is a very special important day. He asks for my wife and son to join the meeting, I tell them sure, of course, anything for boss and The Board. I dragged them both through the floor to the centre of the room, where the blood drawings are,no no no no no time to be gentle, we are on a tight schedule! I apologised to the boss for their smell, they both have been smelling putrid the past one or two days. I bathed them with the liquid boss gave me but it didn't help with the smell, it just helped their skin from falling off. One of the members of The Board Came To Me and said I did an excellent job,!!! and not to worry about the smell, it’s normal (so much about families I didn’t know before I found my first wife and son a few weeks ago, who’d have thought! hahaha).\n\nAs I write this in the living room, it’s 3:33 and they have started the meeting, I can hear the voices of all Board Members, and the boss singing,chantingit started and I also I start to hear other voices too, they usually come to the meeting, us, though I don’t recognize them, and oh my wife is talking as well, so when around me she doesn’t say a word, when around The Board she is suddenly talkative huh? That bitch.you are not you But the company likes my wife, and I do anything for my job.Ilove my job I do anything for my job,they are like family to me, the family I never had, I only wish my family was more like my companyoh godno. SHUT UP.. It’s almost like it comes from the room when they are there during the meeting and is always annoying but only until\n\nI hear him, The Director is there, nobody told me and I never heard him before but I KNOW it’s him, everyone else just got so quiet and he is whispering things.\n\nOne day I will get promoted and I will be wearing those robes and I will talk to The Director myself! He is always right and always powerful and always has control of everything every time he comes to the meeting, he gives us gifts.\n\nThe voices went away when I heard The Director, I think they are scared of him, good, I am not.\n\nThey’ve been there for hours, the sun is almost rising. I hope all is fine.\n\nThey just left, without saying goodbye or anything, they were very tired I suppose, a very hard day of work! Boss looks at me and tells me to clean up the mess, and I need a new family. I am happy, I was so tired of them anyway, I remember when my first wife and daughter only lasted a week, I was an intern at that time.\n\nIt’s 5, the sun is out and blinding me, I hate it, I will go to sleep, tomorrow I have a hard day of work and I also have an appointment with the doctor.\n\nJanuary 20th,\n\nDear diary, it’s a beautiful day, it’s 6, my wife and son left forever, I feel lonely. I want to go to work early to cool down my head.\n\nIt’s 7:30, I am in the office, my coworkers haven’t bullied me today, boss is happy, he said The Director said good things about me, I am euphoric! I love my job.\n\nIt’s 12, I have been hard at work and even forgot to write in the diary, I found several potential clients already. I am getting good at it. Facebook mostly, I flirt with them a bit and invite them for coffee, most of them stop talking to me but today 2 of them have continued conversation, I do all of my tasks correctly, I even found the home address of one already, next up is to check schedules, check potential family, friends and contacts, make sure they don’t know about me, our work is confidential my boss always says!\n\nYou know, ever since I’ve been working here I have become better socially and I find it easier to find myself wives. My boss always says, I can just apply what I learned in the office to meet them, and he is right. I don’t wanna go back to the house empty, I don’t like empty houses, I like when they have people in. I don’t like being alone, that’s when the voices come.\n\nIt’s 2, my lunch break. As I stopped and reflected, I have an appointment with the doctor today. I don’t like when she speaks, but if she becomes my wife, just like the previous ones, they always barely speak at all, and I think I like it that way better. Then I can also stop saying to the things she says that makes me frustrated. I can post this diary on the internet for everyone to see!\n\nI love my job and I want everyone to know it!!!!\n\nIt’s 3, time to go. I got a new knife as a reward for myself for my good work yesterday, sharper, higher efficiency. I put it along with my work tools in my briefcase. Today I will work remotely until late.",

        "text": "My daughter is 22 now and I am so guilty for the way I treated her. Her dad left us when she was a baby, and as a young mom in her 20’s I didn’t want or have the ability to care for her the way I should have. \n\nI used to leave her in the living room at night time while she was a baby while I would have sex with men. I would smack her as a toddler and pull her hair. I let one of my ex boyfriends bring his dog over even tho she would get asthma attacks and break out in hives. She had to go to the hospital, but after I still let him come over with the dog because I wanted the company. I didn’t do anything when my other ex boyfriend grabbed her arm a few times. I would scream and yell at her at 2 years old and leave her in a dark hallway at night until she banged on the front door for her grandmother in fear. \n\nAs she got older, I ended up treating her worse. I would pull her hair so hard, her head would have a lump. I would monitor how often she showered , and I would hide most of the food in my bedroom closet. I would yell and scream at her for sneaking food. I didn’t let her use any appliances. I wouldn’t let her shower whenever she pleased. And would only let her bathe for a few min. I let my mother buy her what she needed like bras. Soap. Personal items. I wasn’t made to be a mother. I neglected her. I let her have lice in her hair and didn’t help her. The bugs were crawling all over her face. I made her sleep and eat on the floor so she wouldn’t mess up the furniture. She would say how bad her back hurt but I didn’t care. \n\nI told her about my sex life. Shook my boobs and danced provocatively as a joke because I am a nymphomanic. She’s seen porn on my computer. Disgusting messages. I told her things I shouldn’t have. Like the number of sexual partners, what I did in college, dick sizes.  \n\nShe had a rabbit and I didn’t let her take it out of her cage. I have OCD and didn’t want it to make a mess everywhere. Over time, I wouldn’t let her put it in her room so I put the rabbit in a dark laundry room and removed the lamp so it sat in darkness 24:7. I didn’t want to pay for the light bill. She had to beg my mom to get it food. Then I killed it by accident because it was so dirty from its filth, I gave it a bath with a hose and it had a seizure and died. I didn’t know rabbits would die from being wet. I remember her screaming and yelling and I was too busy fighting with my boyfriend at the time. \n\nI would tell her disgusting things. Call her fat. Say she had a balloon face. A loser. Tell her “that’s why you have no friends at school “ “that’s why your dad left you” I also told her I wish I never fucked her dad. She was between 8-12. \n\n\nOne time, when I was having a stressful day, she was always defiant. And put a chocolate bar in my thanksgiving turkey. I was so angry I took mayonnaise and shoved it in her face. Up her nose. Down her throat. Until she threw up and cried. She always had a sensitivity with mayonnaise since she was a toddler, and I would sometimes use it to threaten her as punishment. Now she eats like a child, and has a fear of foods. \n\nWhen she ended up cutting herself, I didn’t get her help. I didn’t let her see a doctor when she had strep throat , and she almost died of an asthma attack because I was too tired to be bothered in the middle of the night. I told her to call the ambulance herself. But then followed her to the hospital. \n\nI didn’t let her get a license or a permit or a bank account because I didn’t want to be responsible for her reckless behavior. \n\nShe ended up getting sexually abused @ 14 by her music teacher who’s 23. She told me they just kissed. So I messaged him and told him to stop talking to her. He didn’t. And I found out recently it was way more than what she told me. I broke down in tears from the guilt. \n\nOnce she was about 15-16 she was running away and drinking and I just gave up on her and counted the days until she was 18 so she wasn’t my responsibility anymore. She felt the same. \n\nI told her to go live with another family member when she was 17. All she did was smoke weed and not listen or follow my rules. I have heard from her maybe 3 times\n\nI love my daughter. I feel guilty but she never wants to speak to me again. I thought since I never sexually abused her or beat her until she had bruises, it wasn’t abuse. I made mistakes. She now struggles with substance abuse issues. But Is a kind and empathetic person. She’d give the shirt off her back for anybody. She was just so hyper and bratty. And a hard kid. Maybe because of her ADHD. And I never wanted to be a mother.",

        "text": "Growing up I never rlly asked my parents about their childhoods. I did ask them, when I was older, and was shocked to find out that my grandparents were extremely @b^sive \n They always seemed so happy and kind. Neither of my parents had the best living conditions, nor a good relationship with their parents. My mom told me that when she was twelve when she moved to the US and my dad told me that when he was nine when he moved to US. But every time I ask them about their childhood events, leading up to them moving to the US and the events afterwards, the story would always change. My mom would always change the the age in which she moved. On some days she was 11 and on some days she was 16. And some days my dad moved to Texas, but others he moved to Nevada. Their stories were extremely inconsistent.  This could just be them not remembering all the details correctly due to us happening years ago. But it was the same with their siblings, my aunts and uncles.None of them really had a clear memory of them moving to the US.  And when I ask them, they would always trying to change the subject.  I did think that maybe it was because they were secretly not citizens or something. But around 2009 both my parents became legal citizens followed by pretty much all of my family. I do know that my parents are both extremely secretive. I didn’t really see them a lot during my childhood. They would be physically in the house with me, But we would only see each other during dinner. \nMy dad would sometimes go on unexplained “business trips” for months at a time. He’s work did not require him to go on business trips. Every time he was on these business trips, he would never tell us where he was going. He never answered questions about where he had gone too. He would never take any pictures or call me or my siblings. Him and my mom would occasionally have late night conversations on the phone.  \nOnce I walked into my parents room because I had a bad dream and I saw my mom look at me and terror as she hung up quickly. She ushered me out of the room and pretend that she didn’t know what I was talking about the next morning. The house that we used to live in was a duplex. From the street it looked like one big house. Only my neighbors driveway in front door was visible.  My parents looked through many different, nicer houses, that were more affordable but for some reason settled on that one. They said they liked their privacy. When we ended up moving a few years ago my mom removed a small, thin slab of wood that was used as the the bottom of the cabinet. Underneath it was multiple envelopes and scattered documents. There’s a few photos of a family, a mother, father, and two children in a park. She put the documents and Photos through the paper shredder and toss them away. Me being around 9  at the time, was really curious about it. I asked her and she looked me dead in the eyes and told me to never speak of it again.  I’m almost 17 now and every time I try to ask her about it she gives me a different story.  “It was the old neighbors papers. “ “those were just some stupid old documents“ and stuff like that. My parents, even though being very closed off, were quite chill during my childhood.  Since we moved to a new house,  they’ve been extremely tense.  We have a big window that looks onto the road. They try their best to keep it shut.  Every time a car drives by our house, my parents stare it down and don’t move until it drives away. They get really tense whenever a car parks outside of our house. When my parents aren’t home, I look through out family photo albums. There was a photo of the man who is in the photo that my mom shredded. In another photo there was one of the children that was in that same photo. I asked my parents separately on who these people were My mom told me that they were her brothers friends that lived in the the secluded parts of the Netherlands. My dad told me that they were some of his deceased relatives that lived in the Philippines. I’m really questioning what they’re hiding from me. But I’m too scared to ask. Since then they have removed the photos of the man and child from the photo albums. When I bring it up, they look at me confused and ask me what I’m  talking about.  Nobody in my family seems to know or wants to talk about who they are.  This happened a few months ago and I still see the faces of man and child in my dreams.  I wonder why my parents are lying to me about them.My whole family doesn’t want to tell me about them.  I’m just so confused.  \nI wonder what else they’ve been lying to me about. How many more secret relatives do I have? And why were they so paranoid throughout my life? I am afraid that I may never know the answers. I want to try and do my own research on who those people were. And the man in the photo looks kind of like my dad and my uncle at the same time.  I was wondering if maybe he was one of the brothers that they, for some reason never talked about. The child in the photo looks a lot like my sibling. I’m pretty sure that we are related. I’m just so confused. I can’t talk to my family the same way I used too. It’s like they’ve been lying to me for so long.  If I never noticed these things, I probably would’ve been fine. I wouldn’t have to worry about who these supposed mystery family members are . And my life will probably be a lot less stressful and I would be a lot less paranoid that my family is lying to me.",

        "text": "Years ago, when I still went to school my parents used to move around a lot. My mother had to often change jobs and it was my dad's fault , due to his own job. At the time the story happened, we were looking at yet another relocation, planned months in advance. \n\nI was a not very successful 9- grader. In total we have been staying at this place for 4 years, living at the 6th floor of a 9 -floor building.\n\nThings would have been doable but in the apartment above us there lived an old woman, a hag if you will. At first glance you could think she has gone entirely insane. In the summer the window of my room was always open and due this our entire family could hear her talk out of her own window. She would spontaneously start monologuing and just as spontaneously she would stop. She would start talking in her apartment in the middle of the night, as if to piss everyone off she would do it more often than during the day. Her day didn't have any structure, she was free to do as she pleased. She would talk about things no one understood, trying to get someone to understand her in her own very confusing way. The locals didn't pay attention to her at all, force of habit, I think. But I woke up a few times in the middle of the night, that's how loud she was talking.  I have to admit I was really scared because she changed her voice a lot and you could have the impression that different people were talking.\n\nOne evening I was at home alone, killing time in front of the PC as usual. I was lost in thought as I suddenly heard scratches on our front door. Confused, I approached our door and looked through the spy. There stood the old woman from upstairs. I slightly opened the door but couldn't say a word as she interrupted me.\n\n\"You stole from me! Return my gold!\" She spoke with a voice full of malice.\n\nI wasn't sure what to reply to this, it happened so fast. She on the other hand kept talking as if having forgotten what she said a few seconds ago.\n\n\" My little son Alex, where have you been?\" She inquired, her face assuming an entirely different expression.\n\n\" I'm sorry but my name is Eugene!\"  I replied. But she just kept talking as if she knew what I would say.\n\n\" I have several of you, I can't remember everyone!\" She squeezed the words from her barely parted lips before turning around and walking back upstairs. I did not understand what she came for but I have to admit I felt uncomfortable after that conversation. There was something in her eyes that was beyond insanity, as if something from within her consciousness was successfully manipulating her. Forcing the philosophical thoughts out of my mind I returned to my PC. Strangely, there was nothing to hear from her till the evening.\n\nI couldn't fall asleep for half the night. At one moment,  silence descended upon the room as if someone had cast a spell. But it was not a normal silence. I had the feeling that I got tossed in a vacuum or worse, had gone entirely deaf. As if nothing has changed but the silence was entirely within my head. I kept listening intently but didn't pick up any sounds except my own breath which for some reason annoyed me immensely. Those moments felt like a calm before the storm, as if something was bound to happen any moment.\n\nFrustratingly my expectations came true, I heard steps upstairs and the woman started to speak.\n\n\"You will kill me?! I know! Leave me alone, I am fed up with this!\" she spoke with a voice that grew ever louder.\n\nHaving barely finished the sentence she continued in a changed voice .\n\n\" Why do you act this way around us dear, your dad is still with us, I'll tell on you and he'll punish you!\" she spoke in a slightly lisping voice.\n\nBut all those changes faded to nothing as she, after standing there in complete silence for a minute suddenly started yelling loudly and incomprehensibly. She was either threatening someone or trying to scare something off. Despite all her quirks I have never experienced her acting like this. After the yelling I heard a loud thud as if something fell onto the floor, something very heavy. After this the night was quiet again. I kept trying to listen to something but all I heard were some light steps and I have never heard anything of the kind before. I must have dozed off at some point.\n\nIn the morning I woke up with a horrible headache. For the first time I felt happy going to school. I didn't tell my parents because I knew they have other things on their mind right now. I also knew that my dad hated talking about these things. I wasn't paying attention as I gathered my things and left. Strangely I felt better after a few steps away from the house. Maybe the fresh air did me good or a change of scenery.\n\nThe day went by without anything strange happening, aside from the fact that time somehow seemed to pass way quicker. I was so distracted by my studies that I barely noticed that it was time to go back home. Usually I would be the first one out of the school door but not today.\n\nWhen I returned home I was greeted by deadly silence as usual. Only the clock  in the hallway kept counting down seconds. I caught myself wishing for a cat so I wouldn't be so lonely.\n\nEntering my room I noticed with surprise how messy it was. My things were thrown all around, the bedsheets  crumpled up, some kinds of strange marks everywhere. I didn't pay it much attention, instead thinking \"challenge accepted\" and shifting into cleaning mode. To not get bored I put up music on my PC and pumped up the volume. During my cleanup I was wondering as I kept finding several of my things, some of which were in such spaces that it seemed as if someone was deliberately hiding them from me.\n\nAfter a few minutes I heard loud knocking from above. Apparently the woman disapproved of the loud music. To get back at her, as form of petty revenge I turned the volume up even more. It felt good getting some payback for the night plus I wasn't doing anything illegal.\n\nAfter a minute the knocking stopped and I figured she got tired. Having pity on the old lady plus having finished the cleanup I turned off the music and decided to rest.\n\nI laid down on the bed, having put my phone on charge and got lost in my thoughts. After a while I noticed that it was time for the old woman's talk again but she was silent . My window was open but instead of her gibberish I heard children playing outside and people talking. It was a welcome change I thought as I drifted off to sleep.\n\nI rarely dream but maybe because of last night or some other reasons this was one of those rare occasions. In my dream I was going on about my day, seeing glimpses and bits of it. But in the entire dream I was not alone. It is a feeling I have difficulties to express. As if some unknown entity was following me from a distance. And as the day progressed the world around me kept getting smaller , effectively bringing the observing entity closer to me. I was really scared, especially when in my dream I entered my room I got this overwhelming feeling that I was caught in a trap and someone has been waiting...\n\nI woke up to the entrance door to our apartment slamming. Struggling to open my eyes I looked at my phone and wondered about two things. Number one: apparently I slept for several hours which means I will be having difficulties falling asleep again. And number two: my phone was disconnected from my charger and the charger was lying in the corner of the room.\n\nGetting up I felt how cold it was in my room. I blamed the open window yet as I moved to close it I felt the warm breeze of wind from outside. It was warmer outside than in my room. I have no idea why it was cold in my room specifically but as I went to my parents I felt warm again.\n\nMy mother and father were fighting about something and it has been a while since such heavy conflicts occurred in our family. They never led to anything good anyway. After a few more words my father left the room, preferring to withdraw from supper and my mother's company. My mom warmed up the food and we set down. I tried to tell her about what happened today but she just kept showing her disinterestedness in listening to me. I finished my supper in silence, thanked my mom and went to my room.\n\nI decided to spend the evening preparing for the math exam tomorrow. I did a few math exercises and solved some equations. Having finished that I laid down and tried to sleep and to my surprise I fell asleep very quickly....",

        "text": "Normally I steer clear of dead malls, too much risk of someone taking a photo or video of you and generally for very little gain. You see dead malls are like crack for urban explorers, time capsules, but pretty recent ones, the early nineties frozen in time. On the subject of crack, guess who also loves abandoned malls? Crack addicts, another good reason to give them a wide birth.\n\nBut I got wind of a possible big score at an abandoned mall about an hour north-west of Chicago. Not sure why they built so many malls in the Midwest, hard winters maybe? I suppose strip malls are less fun when the temperature regularly drops below zero.\n\nUsually I hit old estate houses once they’ve been abandoned at least six months. I’m not some tweaker stripping copper wiring. Don’t judge, old estate houses often have ornate solid brass fittings, some go for hundreds a piece and you can strip fifty or sixty in a short time and get out of there.\n\nSo why was I willing to risk a dead mall you ask?\n\nThree reasons:\n\n1. This one seemed to be genuinely dead, the Urban Exploration kids seemed to steer clear because they got the heebie-jeebies from it or something. Either way their forums all seemed to warn not to go near the place.\n2. The temperature on the day I was visiting was in the low single digits. No crackhead was stripping wires in that cold, even if it was indoors.\n3. One of the Urban explorer kids who had braved the place a few months ago had posted a few photos. In the corner of one of the photos, were boxes filled with sealed video games. Old Nintendo cartridges, a fence I know says they are worth a small fortune if they are still there. Some of those cartridges were going for thousands if they were sealed and from what I could see they seemed to be in good condition despite the weather.\n\nIt was freezing when I arrived, the sun had just set, but the snow wasn’t too deep at least. I pulled my van up to one of the smaller side-entrances and out of sight. Although I don’t think it mattered, the place didn’t seem to be monitored by any kind of security. I managed to pry open a door at the green entrance, a faded large giraffe was painted on it, supposed to remind people where they parked.\n\nI turned on my flashlight and swept it around, the place was a crypt. But it was dry, no water ingress, that was the most important thing. The goods might still be in sellable condition, it didn’t matter if the electronics didn’t function from being frozen solid, no collector was ever taking them out of the plastic case to check, it killed the resale value.\n\nI made my way to a map kiosk nearby, my footsteps echoed through the darkness as I walked. Using my glove I wiped a thick layer of dust off the plexiglass. In large print at the top was printed:\n\n*The \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ Hills Mall – Memories to last a lifetime!*\n\nI chuckled to myself at the over ambitious statement given the malls current state, whatever dull memories people had of the place were already faded or gone. Scanning the map I searched for my quarry. I could see a *‘You are here’* marker giving my position on the ground floor, I swept my eyes through the selection of stores. There it was, second floor, *Krazy Konsoles*, a defunct regional game chain. There was no miracle rescue by some reddit nerds for this game store, it had been dead as a doornail for at least twenty years. Odd that some of its stock was still sitting there, at least until a few months ago.\n\nI made my way to the central atrium, the place was cavernous, only a little moonlight made its way into the place through the overhead skylights. Pitching my head up I could see the second floor above, I swept the beam of my flashlight around hoping to spot Krazy Konsoles. For a split second I thought I saw a group of people staring down at me from the upper railing, my guts dropped for a second, but when I moved the beam back to the spot there was nothing there. I put it down to my mind playing tricks on me. I was used to places far creepier than this, sometimes you just got spooked.\n\nThe place had old step escalators rather than newer flat ones, I trudged up the large steps to the first floor and swept the beam around again. Nothing but empty shop fronts, most were all smashed up and what little was left seemed to have been looted. I was getting worried, in the photos the guy posted most of the mall look this bad, but the game shop or at least its storeroom looked much better, why had it remained unscathed. Maybe the second floor was in much better condition generally. Either way I had come this far, the score was too big to walk away from without knowing for certain. I trudged upward to the second floor.\n\nA stiff wind blew through the place, cold, it cut to the bone, not sure where it came from, probably a broken window somewhere. For a moment I swore I heard laughter, not a single person but a group, cackling like schoolgirls. In a panic I spun the beam around searching for a source. Nothing but broken shop fronts, then the beam fell on a group of people. I ducked behind a planter pot and shut off my flashlight. *Fuck*. Maybe a group of tweekers, but they had to have seen the beam. I peaked my head to the side of the planter to get a quick look. Through the darkness I could make out figures for sure, a group, but they were perfectly still. I turned back on my flashlight to confirm my suspicions.\n\nI breathed a sigh of relief, it was just three mannequins in an open area of the floor. They had been arranged in a group and posed as if they were walking. Clearly it was funny to someone. I put the laughter I thought I heard down to the wind whistling through the cavernous central atrium and my imagination. As I illuminated the mannequins I could see Krazy Konsoles across the open area, it looked relatively intact, maybe this wouldn’t be a waste of time after all. I made a beeline for the old game shop.\n\nAs I walked I shook my head to clear it, tried to refocus, couldn’t get distracted, just get the stuff and get out. As I walked past the mannequins I noticed someone had dressed them in old clothing, not nineties old but seventies, like elderly ladies. Some were wearing jewellery like rings and strings of old pearls. The jewellery looked like it might be worth something but I reasoned that if it had been worth anything whoever posed them like this would have just stolen the stuff. Besides I didn’t wanna get close enough to the creepy as fuck mannequins to verify the goods. Maybe I’d risk it on the way out if the game shop was a bust.\n\nAs I gave the mannequins a wide birth I swore they were watching me, but nothing moved, they were still as the night. I didn’t turn to illuminate the mannequins, instead I shook my head to snap myself back to my senses. Just get the goods and get out. It’s just a creepy old mall, pull it together.\n\nBig red letters in a sharp font above the store read Krazy Konsoles. The place looked mostly intact, a great sign. The door was only open a few inches or so, enough for someone slender to slip through but I couldn’t manage it with my backpack and gear, I had to use my crowbar to get it open further. It was another good sign, it meant not many people had been coming and going from the store. The door was stiff with age but it did finally pull open.\n\nBare shelves greeted me, the place wasn’t as wrecked as the other stores, but it wasn’t exactly great and worryingly there was a stench of mold. I made for the back storeroom as quickly as possible, I’d know soon enough if this had all been a waste of time. The door opened easily, there were only a few boxes left. I shone my flashlight on them. Inside were the games, but they were wrecked, water damaged and then frozen. Looking up to the roof I could see a pipe had broken and leaked all over them. When had this happened, the games looked like they had been in a bad state for years, what the hell was going on. I put my crowbar on the ground and rifled through the boxes. I’d been had and I didn’t know why, but my instinct told me to get out of the place as quick as possible.\n\nAs I turned to leave I just caught a glance of a figure for only a split second before something heavy struck me across the side of the head. I was dazed but didn’t lose consciousness, I could feel blood trickling through my hair. It was my own damn crowbar that had hit me. But I still had fight in me, I grabbed the hand that struck me, but it didn’t give like soft flesh, it was solid and cold. I pointed my flashlight up to blind my attacker, it illuminated an almost formless face, no skin tone, wide unblinking eyes, mouth unmoving, coarse black horse-like hair. The head twitched violently but none of its features changed, a horrifying frozen face staring back at me.\n\nI had to have a concussion, this couldn’t be real. Using all my strength I gave the best door-kick into my assailant’s torso I was capable of. She or it stumbled and fell to the ground and writhed around trying to get up, as if not sure quite how, like some new-born animal. I looked on in horror for only a moment, adrenaline pumped, my survival instinct kicked in and I ran. It grabbed for my leg as I passed, but I was too fast. The thing let out a raspy clicking noise in frustration.\n\nAs I reached the door of the store a voice spoke behind me in a low breathy tone.\n\n“Stay with us dear, we’re so lonely.”\n\nI didn’t turn around, I could hear the thing finding its feet, it wasn’t flailing around anymore. It would be coming for me.\n\nI burst out into the atrium and kept running, sweeping the beam of my flashlight around I could see that all three of the arranged mannequins were gone from their positions. Where the hell were the other two? I got my answer quick enough. As I reached the escalators, one of the abominations emerged from behind a planter, dressed like a kindly old lady with her string of pearls. It had been lying in wait.\n\nI didn’t react quick enough, didn’t spot the knife it had clutched in its fiberglass hand till it was too late. Its arm twitched, moving quicker than any human could. The blade was razor sharp, it sliced through my jacket and cut deeply through the muscle of my left arm. I howled in pain and struck out using the heavy duty flashlight like a baton. It connected with the mannequin’s head perfectly, its gray wig fell off as if in some terrible comedy. The thing stumbled backward as if stunned, flailing its blade holding arm in quick motions, like some animation where frames were missing. The impact of the blow damaged the flashlight, I was now back in darkness, there was some moonlight seeping through from the skylights above but not enough to see clearly.\n\n“Please, our families don’t come and see us anymore, we get so lonely,” the voice seemed to be coming from somewhere in the dummies skull if you could call it that.\n\nIts lips didn’t move but the head seemed to twitch as it spoke, I could barely see through the dark. Blood was soaking into my sleeve, I bounded down the broken escalator running on pure adrenaline. I made it to the first floor. My eyes darted around at the darkness, I knew there was a third one somewhere. I couldn’t wait to be sure, I could hear the other two clicking their way down the escalators behind me.\n\nI was losing blood, I wasn’t feeling faint yet, but that would come, it wasn’t my first rodeo, I’d been cut up before. Maybe this time it was the sheer terror keeping me going. But it wouldn’t last forever I had to get out of the place. I bounded down the escalator toward the ground floor. About halfway down the upper-body of the third mannequin popped up on the opposite side of the escalator like it was spring-loaded. It lunged across at me grabbing with both hands, it just managed to get a hold of me, I couldn’t shake it off. In a panic I jumped over the side of the escalator, it was less than half a floor but the impact on my legs was sharp and painful, my left leg buckled but luckily didn’t break. The mannequin had lost its grip in the fall, it was less lucky, the impact split it in two at the torso. I could see the two pieces in the darkness. The legs were kicking and thrashing by themselves, the torso was crawling along the tiles desperately trying to get to me.\n\nMy heart beat like a jackhammer. I moved as fast as possible with my one good leg toward the exit and didn’t look back. I was running out of steam as I reached the door I had come in by, the adrenaline was wearing off, I had to get to my van. As I pulled open the door I could still hear them coming, calling after me in their breathy voices.\n\n“Come back,” I heard them call, “Stay and talk for a while, just a little while, just a little.”\n\nThe cold air sobered me just enough to keep going, I made it to my van, I had the keys out and ready. The engine took a few seconds to turn over, when it did I slammed it into drive and planted my foot on the gas. The wheels spun in the snow and finally caught, the van bolted forward at speed. I made it out of the parking lot and onto a quiet road. I kept driving as fast as I could given the ice and snow and my condition. I finally reached a minor public road, a few cars were coming and going I waved for help but nobody stopped. Eventually blood loss and shock caught up with me, I don’t remember anything for a while after that.\n\nI woke up in a clinic in Rockford, someone had found me slumped over the steering wheel of my Van stuck in a ditch. I was lucky, the local PD had a lot of questions for me but I made up some cock-and-bull story, I was well practiced at that. What was I going to tell them, the truth? The doctors had me on some synthetic opioid for the wounds on my arm and head, I barely knew what the truth was myself at that point.\n\nI can only tell you people one thing with certainty, don’t go near The \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ Hills Mall. It doesn’t matter what you see in photos, or what score you hear is there, it’s not worth it.\n\n*‘Memories to last a lifetime’*\n\n[x](https://conormurrayauthor.com/)",

        "text": "Certainly, here's a creepypasta about Disney:\n\nThere was a rumor that had been circulating among Disney fans for years, whispered in hushed tones at fan conventions and shared through online forums and blogs. According to the rumor, there was a secret Disney theme park hidden deep in the Florida Everglades, far from the glitz and glamour of the main parks. This park was said to be the stuff of nightmares, a twisted and dark reflection of the Disney magic that visitors knew and loved.\n\nDespite the warnings, a small group of thrill-seekers decided to investigate the rumor for themselves. They traveled to the Everglades, navigating through swamps and overgrown forests until they stumbled upon an abandoned park entrance, hidden behind a wall of thorny vines and twisted trees.\n\nAs they entered the park, they were greeted by a scene of horror and decay. The once-colorful buildings were now rusted and crumbling, their paint peeling away to reveal dark and ominous symbols etched into the walls. The rides, too, were in a state of disrepair, their mechanisms creaking and groaning as they turned.\n\nBut what was most disturbing were the creatures that roamed the park. They were twisted, distorted versions of Disney characters, their features twisted into grotesque caricatures. Mickey Mouse's face had melted away, leaving only a gaping maw filled with jagged teeth. Goofy's eyes glowed red, and his limbs were elongated and twisted in unnatural ways. And lurking in the shadows were other figures, creatures that seemed to be neither human nor animal.\n\nThe thrill-seekers soon realized that they had made a grave mistake in coming to this place. They tried to flee, but the park seemed to shift and change around them, the paths leading them deeper into the nightmare. The creatures pursued them, their twisted forms moving with unnatural speed and agility.\n\nIn the end, only one of the thrill-seekers escaped. The rest were never seen again, and the legend of the secret Disney park in the Everglades continued to grow. Some say that the park is still there, hidden away from the world, waiting for its next unsuspecting victims to stumble upon its horrors.\n\nYears after the incident, a group of urban explorers heard of the legend and decided to search for the lost Disney park. They trekked through the Everglades, and after hours of wandering through the dense swamps, they found the entrance.\n\nUnlike the previous group, they came prepared with cameras and equipment to document their findings. As they entered the park, the same eerie feeling enveloped them, but they shrugged it off as a mere overreaction to the rumors.\n\nThey wandered around the abandoned park, marveling at the twisted designs of the attractions and the sinister symbols etched on the walls. They even dared to ride some of the rides, despite the groans and creaks that echoed through the park.\n\nHowever, as the night fell, things started to change. The creatures, more horrifying than ever, came out of hiding, stalking the explorers with their glowing eyes and twisted limbs. The group realized their mistake and tried to leave, but the park had changed, the pathways leading them in circles, and the exits sealed.\n\nAs they attempted to find their way out, the creatures became more aggressive, snarling and snapping at them. One by one, the explorers fell to the twisted creatures, their screams echoing through the abandoned park.\n\nOnly one person escaped, much like the previous group, but they were not the same. They never spoke of what they saw in the park, but some say they were haunted by the twisted Disney characters for the rest of their life.\n\nThe secret Disney park in the Everglades remains hidden, but some brave souls continue to search for it, lured by the thrill of the unknown and the promise of an adventure. However, they say that those who enter the park never truly leave, that they become part of the twisted world, forever trapped in the nightmare.\n\nCreepy Phoenix:\n\nLet me know what you think, I find it fascinating that it can come up with this on the fly.",

        "text": "The sun shone brightly through the trees, highlighting the golden colors of the fall leaves. I’d been on the road for 2 days and had spent the last 8 hours fighting my way thought a freak snowstorm that has blanketed snow across much of the Midwest with the system dipping down into Kentucky just enough to make life miserable. Thankfully it had shifted north as I went south and as I made my way to the TN/NC state line, the sun had come out full force and made the snow a distant memory. \n\nAs I twisted around the mountain roads, my radio signal faded out and soon there was only static. I flipped the radio off and as my eyes shifted back to the road, I caught a glint of metal in the sun. ‘Is that a car?’ I thought to myself as I got closer. The GPS didn’t show any places to stop along this road, so I was caught off guard as I came up to an opening in the trees and saw a small structure, almost a shack, set back from the road. There were four cars in the lot and a small chimney near the back of the place was puffing smoke out. There was a small sign at the road that read “All Welcome! Stop in and say ‘HI!’” The paint on the sign was faded, like it had been there for years. \n\nI had an uneasy feeling in my stomach, but I pushed it aside. I hadn’t had a break in hours and driving through that snow had really taken it out of me. I pulled into the lot and parked next to a navy blue SUV. I noticed it was filthy and didn’t look like it had been washed in years. Where was I? But when I looked back at my own car, it wasn’t much better, covered in black dirt packed on from the snow and its aftermath. I took a deep breath and continued walking to the front door. There was a small porch with a couple chairs and a footstool sitting to the left of the door. Cobwebs and dirt covered the surfaces and caused my anxiety to flair up again. \n\n‘Just breath Erin!’ I thought to myself. ‘This place is in the middle of nowhere, it’s outside, exposed to everything, its normal for there to be dirt and cobwebs! CALM DOWN!’\n\nAs I finished that thought, the door opened, and I was greeted by a woman who had a smile the size of Mt Rushmore plastered on her face. I started to turn to leave when she grabbed my hand and said, ‘Come in, come in! There’s plenty of room! Don’t go, we’re just getting started for the day!’ As I stepped into the little entryway, I looked around. Magazines, books, and newspapers were stacked and lined up along the walls. I glanced at the date on the newspaper on top of one of the stacks, ‘November 8, 1953’…Jesus, don’t people know it’s unhealthy to hold onto shit like that forever? With her hand still holding mine, the woman guided me through the doorway into an open room that looked like it had been a living room at some point.\n\nPictures still hung on the walls and carpet still lined the floor around a counter that had been set up in front of a back wall. There were tables and chairs scattered around the room, in an attempt to make the space look inviting, although failing. \n\nAs I looked around and continued to take in my surroundings, the woman appeared to my left, with a cup of coffee in her hand. ‘Drink this hot coffee dear. It’ll warm you up and relax you after your long trip,’ she said as she forced the cup into my hand. She watched me, eyes locked on mine, almost willing me to drink. Not wanting to be rude, I took a small sip and smiled. That seemed to appease her and she turned and walked back to the counter. As soon as she turned, I quickly spit the coffee back into the cup. It had tasted like she had made it back in 1953, no way I could stomach an entire cup.\n\nSuddenly, I was aware of how quiet it was in the room, how there were no other people out here. Where were the people whose cars were out front? Why didn’t I hear them at least? I quickly set the cup down and made a be-line towards the door. As my hand gripped the knob, I felt a hand grab my shoulder. I cried out in surprise and spun around. There was the woman who had brought me in, but her Mt Rushmore smile had been replaced with an ugly scowl. ‘It’s VERY impolite to not finish your drink and try to sneak off without PAYING!’ she half-screeched at me. My eyes immediately went to the floor in shame. What the hell was wrong with me? I definitely needed a break and this place might be old and dirty, but it was a place to rest and get my bearings again. ‘I apologize ma’am. I’m just anxious to get back on the road,’ I said as I reached for my wallet. ‘How much do I owe you for the coffee?’. I looked up at her and she was smiling that huge, unnerving smile again. ‘Just a quarter my dear, we’re not trying to get rich, but have to buy our supplies one way or another,’ she said as she slowly turned and walked back to the counter. \n\nI followed and laid a $1 bill on the counter in front of her. ‘Here, this is all I have, please keep the change. I’m sorry I almost left without paying.’ And started to back up towards the door again. ‘Oh dear, you are TOO generous! Please come sit a spell and talk with me!’ I noticed that she had taken a step in my direction with every word. She was closer now and looked like she might jump on me. Something was definitely not right here; all my alarm bells were going off and my body was about to take flight. All I wanted – no NEEDED – to do was get away from this place. The woman came another step closer, keeping with mine. ‘I’m sorry ma’am, but I have to get back on the road if I’m going to make it in time. I have a deadline I have to make, it’s really important that I’m there!’ I hoped the panic in my voice really sold it and she believed me. I couldn’t get away from this place fast enough!\n\n‘Oh, but my dear, it’s already getting so late, why don’t you just stay here tonight,’ she said as she took another step towards me. I had my hand on the doorknob now and was ready to bolt if she kept coming. ‘Umm, I really can’t ma’am, that’s a generous offer, but people are expecting me. I really must go.’ And I pushed the door open as she lunged at me. I cried out as she did and almost tripped on one of the piles in the entryway. The woman reached out and grabbed my leg to try to stop me. ‘NO! Don’t go! Stay! STAY! STAAAY!’ she screamed as I wrenched out of her grasp and ran out the door. \n\nMy senses were shocked as I stepped outside into darkness. How in the hell was it dark already?? I hadn’t been in there more than 20 mins. What the hell was going on?! I heard things breaking inside the shack and that got me moving. I got in my car, locked the doors, and jammed the key in the ignition. As the engine roared to life, I looked up towards the house. \n\nMy stomach flipped and I almost passed out. Staring out at me from the front window was the old woman and behind her was at least 10 other people of various ages, and ALL of them were wearing looks of dread with their mouths locked into a permanent scream. When I locked eyes with the old lady, she threw her head back and her body shook with laughter. As she did this, the poor people behind her began to scream. I know they were screaming because they filled my head. I couldn’t stay any longer, I was almost past my point of being able to deal with this, so I threw the car in reverse and nailed the gas. Dirt and rocks flew up from both sides as I backed up and turned the car around. \n\nI couldn’t help myself. I had to take one more look back in the rearview. I wish I hadn’t. The entire shack was in flames, and I could still see the poor souls trapped inside…",

        "text": "Me and my friend got bored one day around 11 at night but we remembered something we could go to there was an abandoned house it must have been. Abandoned no longer than 40 to 50 years, we got In after a long walk that lasted 20 minutes to get there when we saw the house. It looked really beaten up plants was over grown all over the house. The red paint was almost nonexistent, the wood on the door. And the house was chipped, and Rowlett it looked like it was going to fall at any moment, but being dumb bored teenagers, we still went into. The house first thing I felt there was something or someone was watching us and then the smell of the inside of this house hit us. It smelled like rotting food and must have been like the people who lived here didn't take anything but a few things with them before they left in a hurry the. Shoes jackets hoodies just left a few feet a away from the door and the fridge and the furniture was left and the house made creaking noises almost ever step into the kitchen and the hallway into the living room. The house looked a lot better on the side , and the outside wasn't as broken down. we started to wonder why this place was. Abandoned than there was a sound upstairs. Sound it like something fall we looked at each other then he started walking out to the hallway then I started to follow him all the way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo the stairs and walked up the stairs hearing every crack and creek all the way up the stairs. It looked nowhere near as good as it did downstairs there was 2 hallways and 6 doors and we went down the hallway in front of us we went in each door we split off to one side each of the hallway. To make the looking around faster, there were 4. Room 1. Bedroom 1. Bathroom 1. Spare room and 1. Master bedroom.  They looked like the hallway but just with more stuff in them, but then we heard something that. Stock me to my very core it was a deep dark laughter from the hallway we didn't go down, yet we went by the stairs and seemed the thing that made this laugh it had red eyes. And a black figure, but it didn't look transparent like a black mist it disappeared around the doorway. For some reason, we didn't leave then, and there we just had to go see. What it was we went into the room there was nobody in there no way out but the door then we heard the laugh in the hallway I seem only. For a moment before it went downstairs, we wanted to go to leave right then and there, but it was at the. Bottom of the stairs and all I felt was a deep hatred then the laugh and it was gone just like that we didn't wanna stay there for any longer. We started to run down the stairs out the door into town, and we both went home after and talked. About what happened the next day, but it didn't stop there for me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dreams the laughs the sounds the whispers the dreams didn't stop until my friend went back to the house when I seem him the next day he looked like a shell of himself but he wouldn't tell me what. Happened to him, but after that was the last day anyone.  Had seem of him, but I know he's in that house, and I will get him out of there, but I know that red eyed thing is not the only thing in that place",

        "text": "Yes, mom, you read that right. I’m not only a witch, but also a lesbian.\n\nI know my mom won’t read this, but I just had to get it out. To rub it into her god-fearing, bible-thumping face, you could say, at least a little.\n\nMy mom’s an extremely religious person; church every Sunday, praying before every meal, all of it.\n\nI didn’t mind these things so much. What I did mind was her constant talk about sins, temptation, the devil and going to hell. I heard it pretty much every day, and at least once a week, she’d promised me I’d be going to hell for... something. I absolutely hated it.\n\nThat’s why I am who I am today, a proud pagan, or a witch, and that’s how I ended up in the situation I am in now.\n\nNow, this isn’t a story about my upbringing, but I guess knowing these things helps a little to understand how I got into certain... things.\n\nGrowing up, I was a mousy little thing, shy and reclusive.\n\nI first realized I liked girls when I was in high school, a Christian high school at that. My crush’s name was Brittany. She was your typical popular girl: blond, and a total bitch.\n\nI never actually talked to her and told no one who I felt. Eventually, I just graduated and moved on to college.\n\nGoing to college was a revelation. For the first time, I got away from home, away from mom’s obsession with Christ, and could figure out who I really was and wanted to be. But also, to try out a few of the things I’d never dared before.\n\nOne of them was sex, the premarital kind at that, the one mom had described as a capital sin. By that point, Brittany was nothing but a distant memory, my feelings for her long forgotten. Even though I soon realized that guys just weren’t my thing.\n\nMost of my time, however, was dedicated to my hobbies and studies. Since I’d always loved paganism, was obsessed with it, you could say, I majored in religious studies with a focus on pagan traditions.\n\nI loved it, and I loved the general college lifestyle. My fellow students were all so different from the people I grew up around. Alcohol, drugs, and alternative lifestyle were big amongst them.\n\nYet as much as I pride myself about trying new things and going wild, I didn’t. While I hated mom’s talk about sin, I was still shy, even reluctant, to try any of it.\n\nMy first time at a club was quite the strange experience. I’d never been out dancing before, had never gotten drunk and didn’t know the first thing about drugs.\n\nIt was my friend Emily who eventually convinced me to tag along when she went to one of her favorite clubs. It was a back alley scene club; the type frequented by the weirder and more alternative parts of the population.\n\nIt would be an understatement to say I felt like I didn’t belong there.\n\nAfter we’d entered, Emily was quick to order us each a beer and, before she promptly vanished to ‘mingle,’ as she called it, and I was left to my own devices.\n\nFor the next hour, I just stood at the edge of the dance floor, half-heartedly drinking my beer and watching people. The air was heavy with the smell of sweat and alcohol and the loud booming music reverberated painfully inside my head.\n\nAfter a while, I noticed a guy eying me. He gave me a drunken smile before he awkwardly danced in front of me. I sighed. He’d probably noticed my bored, dejected look, and was hoping for an ‘easy’ win.\n\nI rolled my eyes and tried my best to ignore his advances, hoping he’d give up soon enough.\n\nWhen that didn’t work, I fled to a different floor. For some reason, however, he kept following me. Regardless of where I went, he soon found me and lingered nearby.\n\nIt was Melinda who saved me.\n\nI’d just settled down on a couch in one of the club’s quieter areas, the smoking area, as I should soon find out. After only a minute, the same creepy guys stumbled in as well.\n\nBefore he could approach me, however, a woman set down next to me.\n\nShe was absolutely gorgeous. For a second, all my memories of and the feelings I’d had for Brittany resurfaced, and my heart skipped a beat. Yet I could tell right away that this woman was so much more than she could’ve ever been.\n\nHer outfit was simplistic, almost too much so, nothing but a tank top and shorts, but it fit her perfectly. She had cropped blond hair with a few darker strands mixed into it. Her most stunning feature, however, were her eyes. They were bright green, and seemed to focus on me and me alone, almost as if she was staring into me.\n\n“You new here? Haven’t seen you around?” she half-whispered at me, giving me a coy little smile.\n\nInstead of answering, I just stared at her. When I realized what I was doing, I quickly looked away, took a big sip of beer, and then focused on the creepy guy again. He was sitting on a couch nearby, pretending to mind his own business, but I noticed his short, side-way glances.\n\nThe woman next to me turned in his direction as well.\n\n“Just ignore him. He’ll give up soon enough.”\n\nJust as she said this, the guy suddenly got off and walked away.\n\n“See? It’s just that easy. I’m Melinda, by the way.”\n\n“Oh, my name is, I mean, I’m Claire. Nice to meet you,” I brought out, stumbling over my words.\n\nMelinda giggled. Then she reached into her purse, brought out a pack of cigarettes, lit one and leaned back. After two pulls, she held the cigarette out for me.\n\nI wasn’t a smoker, had never even touched a cigarette, but still took it, almost unconsciously. I started coughing right away.\n\nLaughing, Melinda took it back.\n\nFor the next minute, I just sat there, next to her, entranced by her, and watched as she exhaled cloud after cloud of bluish-grey smoke.\n\nOnce she’d finished her cigarette, she got up, but handed me another one.\n\n“Just so you don’t forget me. See you later, little Claire.”\n\nWith that, she went on her way back to wherever she’d come from.\n\nI was left sitting there, cigarette in hand, staring after her.\n\nFor long minutes, I tried to make sense of the encounter and the many conflicting feelings inside of me.\n\nEventually, a clearly drunk Emily found me again.\n\n“I didn’t know you smoked, Claire,” she said.\n\n“I don’t. Oh, this? Yeah, no it’s... never mind,” I said, shaking my head before I carefully put the cigarette into my purse.\n\nWe were at the club for another hour. While Emily was dancing and having fun, my eyes wandered around, looking for Melinda. Yet she seemed to have vanished.\n\nFor the next few days, I couldn’t get her out of my head. I don’t know what it was, but there was something special about Melinda. The way she carried herself, her confidence, but also other, smaller things I’d noticed about her. Around her wrist, she’d worn a small, pearly armband, and I’d also noticed the purple healing stone fastened to her necklace. It made me wonder if she might be interested in the same things I was.\n\nI was back at the club a week later. This time, on my own.\n\nFor long minutes, I walked from floor to floor, desperately trying to find her, but there was no hint of her.\n\nFrustrated, I went back to the smoking area and found myself an empty seat. There I sat, brooding, and eventually pulled out the cigarette Melinda had handed me a week ago. As my thoughts drifted away, I absentmindedly rolled it between my fingers, playing with it.\n\n“Need a light?”\n\nIn surprise, I dropped the cigarette. When I turned around, I saw Melinda. Somehow, without even noticing, she’d found me and sat down right next to me.\n\n“So, you’re smoking now?”\n\n“No. Well, I guess?” I said, giving her a little shrug.\n\nThen I picked up the cigarette and held it out for her to light. Of course, I coughed again, but somehow, with each pull, and with Melinda next to me, it seemed to get easier.\n\nThat night, we started talking, and that night I got to know her.\n\nAs I’d thought, Melinda shared many of my interests. Yet the way she went about them was much more intense. She was much more intense.\n\nWhile I read books on pagan rituals, collected healing stones, and made my own witchy jewelry and accessories, she’d gone much deeper.\n\nShe talked about rituals, too, but the ones she herself had performed. She’d go on about real magic, real witches, different planes and places, places, she said, where magic originated from.\n\nTalking to her was nothing short of enthralling, almost intoxicating. Eventually, as night turned to early morning, we exchanged phone numbers, and, a moment later, Melinda was gone again.\n\nWe ended up texting all throughout the week. Melinda told me more about the things she’d done, recommended me books, but also shared a few niche blogs on astral projection I might be interested in.\n\nYet there was one thing she was steadfast about. If I truly wanted to learn, to become enlightened, as she put it, I’d have to do the real thing.\n\nWhen I asked her if she was talking about some sort of ritual, all I got was a little emoticon. Then, a few seconds later, she added a simple ‘You’ll find out on Saturday. Same place, same time?’\n\nThat’s just how she was, always a tad bit mysterious, but I’d have to lie if I didn’t like it. Before I knew it, I’d already sent her a yes.\n\nWhen Saturday evening arrived, I headed for the club right away. This time, I didn’t waste any time looking for her, but headed straight for the smoking area.\n\nMelinda was already there, waiting for me. She sat on a couch in the back, staring at me with her bright, green eyes and bidding me to join her.\n\n“So, the real deal? What is it? You want us to do some sort of weird dance ritual?” I asked, laughing a little.\n\n“Oh no, little Claire, it’s something much, much better.”\n\nWith that, her hand vanished inside her purse, and then, careful to hide it from the other people in the smoking area, produced a small Ziploc bag containing a strangely growing powder.\n\nFor a moment, I just stared at it, not understanding. When my brain functioned again, I realized what she was holding.\n\n“Wait. No way, Melinda, that stuff... I can’t.”\n\n“There’s a first for everything,” Melinda said in a sing-song voice, giving me another one of her seductive smiles.\n\nFor the first time, her smile didn’t work on me.\n\n“No, really. This,” I said, holding up the cigarette I was smoking, “sure, but not that.”\n\nI grew angry, furious even. Was this the reason she’d talked to me? Was all this a ploy to get me hooked on some sort of weird designer drug?\n\nIn my anger, I was about to get up, but felt Melinda’s hand close around my wrist.\n\n“Oh, but don’t you want to learn more? This stuff here, this Oneiria, is the way to go, the way to learn, little Claire.”\n\nI was still angry with her, but then I thought about mom, about my life until now. Wasn’t Melinda right? Wasn’t I here to experience new things, to learn and to get enlightened? The smallest of smiles came over my face. Yes, I was, and I was here to sin, to do all the things my mom had warned me about, and told me I’d go to hell for.\n\nWhen Melinda saw that small smile, she pulled me in close and kissed me.\n\nThe moment our lips made contact, all the apprehension and all my doubts evaporated. I was obsessed with this woman. When our lips parted, I gave her a nod and said I was ready to try, if only this once.\n\nThe moment I took Oneiria, as she’d called it, the world changed.\n\nAll the colors around me intensified, as if the world’s saturation had been turned up a few notches. The same was true for my feelings. For the first time, I could truly feel the world around me, could feel every part of my body, and, of course, I could feel Melinda.\n\nAlmost in a trance, I let her take my hand and lead me to the dance floor.\n\nMy eyes wandered around; the world seemed so, so different. Everything around me was moving faster, then slower again. Motions and people became blurs, washing into each other.\n\nThen I focused on Melinda again. She was in front of me, her arms around me. I could feel the warmth of her emotions radiate from her and wash over me in heavy waves. It felt like I was a part of her and her a part of me.\n\nAt one point, we made out right there, on the dance floor. It was the most intense thing I’d ever felt in my entire life.\n\nThe longer I danced with Melinda, our hands grasping each other, our lips touching, the more the world changed. I saw things I’d never seen before. People were glowing brightly, their energy wafting through the air, intermingling and mixing into a kaleidoscope of living colors.\n\nAnd then, for whatever reason, my eyes wandered upwards.\n\nThe club’s ceiling was gone. Twirling stars, and mad, sparkling galaxies unlike anything I’d ever seen before replaced it.\n\nIt was nothing short of magical, and as I moved my hand through the air, the stars above responded to my every motion.\n\nThen my trance-like fascination was interrupted by a moment of clarity. I instantly cringed back from the surreal sight above me, averted my eyes, and tried to feel from the dance floor.\n\nYet I was held in place. When I stared at Melinda, she, too, had changed. By now, she was nothing but bright light and pure, intense feeling. I felt her holding me in place, surrounding me, engulfing me.\n\n“This is what you were looking for all along, little Claire, this is it,” her sing-song voice reverberated inside my mind.\n\nA second later, I drifted off.\n\nWhen I awoke, I was in bed. For a moment, I shivered when I remembered what had happened.\n\nSuddenly, I realized I was naked, grew confused when I realized I wasn’t in my dorm room.\n\nThen Melinda entered the room, similarly naked.\n\n“Melinda?” I brought out. “What happened? What did we...?”\n\nHer answer was nothing but a smile, but one that told me more than enough.\n\nOnce I’d calmed down, I spoke again.\n\n“What was that last night?”\n\n“Oneiria,” Melinda answered, matter-of-factly. “It allows you to see. Not only what’s out there, but also what you desire, the magic you always dreamed of.”\n\nAfter that night, it didn’t take long for me to get hooked. I’d told myself repeatedly to not give into it, that I’d just do it once more. Yet Oneiria had this strange fascination to it.\n\nIt differed from any other drug I’d heard about. You weren’t just getting high, it allowed you to visit certain different places. Every time the two of us indulged in Oneiria, I saw the same mad, sparkling galaxies, but also a world in which magic was real.\n\nEventually, I learned I wasn’t the only person Melinda had introduced Oneiria to. When I first heard this, I felt betrayed, and a pang of jealousy shot through my entire body. I almost left, never to talk to her again. Yet Melinda assured me I was special. I was the one, the only one she loved. All those others, they were friends, acquaintances, people of mutual interest. I was different.\n\nWhat can I say? I believed her. And so, a few days later, I joined her during her next meeting with her little witches’ circle, who all indulged in Oneiria.\n\nEvery time I did it, however, the drug’s effect became stronger. It was barely noticeable, but noticeable nonetheless. The visions I saw intensified, and each time, I caught more glimpses of this other world. It was a place where not only magic was real, but witches, paganism, and magical creatures as well.\n\nIt was a place, I eventually learned, where even I had power, actual power, and could command the magic I so longed for. No longer was I mousy little Claire, but what I’d always wanted to be: a witch, an actual witch.\n\nYet as much as I loved the place, and as much as I loved Melinda, something about it felt wrong. That place, it felt too different and too far away, too detached.\n\nAt the same time, however, whenever I was there, I felt this pull, a pull from somewhere beyond that pulled me in just a tad bit closer.\n\nEventually, I realized, deep inside, I didn’t really want this. I didn’t want to get any closer. What I wanted was to feel magic, to command it, sure, but not in some otherworldly, drug-infused dreamscape. I’d wanted to do it here, to bring just a bit of magic into my boring secluded life. If I couldn’t even do that, then all of this was meaningless, might as well not have been real.\n\nNo, as much as I was pulled in, as much as I wanted more of it, I didn’t want to leave the real world behind, at least not just yet.\n\nAbout a week ago, things took a turn for the worse.\n\nOnce again, our little circle met up, and once again, we readied ourselves for another round of Oneiria-infused scrying. That night, however, we went further than ever before.\n\nAt first, everything was like it usually was. I felt myself sinking into my seat, saw the ceiling above us opening up, vanishing, before the mad, sparkling galaxies replaced it. Then, we were all pulled in closer, towards the world of magic we’d visited so many times before.\n\nAs before, I struggled against the pull. It was a half-hearted attempt at best, nothing but an afterthought. Yet when I did, I could feel Melinda’s eyes on me.\n\nWhen I turned toward her, however, she’d changed. What had once been a woman with cropped blond hair and bright green eyes was now a glimmering witch made of nothing but stars, a twisted space nebula.\n\nShe seemed to extend, to spread out, growing bigger, wider, an all-encompassing shroud of stars, fire and magic that washed over us.\n\nBut then, once she’d filled out the entire room, she opened up, and for the first time, I could see it clearly: the twisted, magical wonderland.\n\nIt was right there, right in front of me, so close, I could almost touch it. I saw energy wafting through the air like colorful clouds, saw magical creatures and fantastical beings.\n\nYet the place was all wrong. Its physics made no sense. It was upside down, but was not; it was circular but spread out and even. I saw mountains growing from the skies, mad galaxies that seemed far away but right there. Behind it all, I saw beings as massive as stars, unfathomable things reaching out, ever reaching out, further and further.\n\nInstantly, I drew back, averted my eyes, and started screaming in sheer and utter terror. These screams were drowned out by those of the other members of the group. Theirs, however, were screams of joy. Soon, a cacophony of barely human jubilation echoed through the room, through the entire building, as they all threw themselves into the dreamscape ahead.\n\nFor a moment, I could see them running into one another, becoming one being before they were torn apart again.\n\nStill screaming, I scrambled away and retreated to the farthest corner of the room. There I sat, shivering and shaking, my eyes closed and my hands pressed over my ears.\n\nI stayed like this for what felt like an eternity.\n\nFinally, I felt a hand touching my face. I jerked up, cringed away, but saw it was Melinda.\n\n“It’s okay now, little Claire. It’s over.”\n\n“W-what the hell was that?”\n\n“I guess it wasn’t for you. Maybe not yet, maybe never.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“I showed it to you, little Claire, a place where you can be yourself, where you’ll find what you’ve been looking for.\n\n“But that place... I don’t want it. Not like that.”\n\nWhen I said this, Melinda’s eyes turned sad and a moment later, she got up.\n\n“That’s it then,” she eventually said, her voice as sad as her eyes.\n\n“Wait, what do you mean?”\n\n“I was only here to help, little Claire, to show, not to force.”\n\n“No, but I love you. I love us, and I want to-“\n\n“Do you really? Or were you just looking for someone to enlighten you, to show you just how much more there’s out there?”\n\n“No! I mean... I don’t know. I don’t freaking know, all right?!”\n\nAt that moment, Melinda came closer. Once more, she put her lips on mine. I savored that kiss more than any other we’d shared before.\n\nWhen our lips parted, I could see the same mad, sparkling galaxies in her eyes and could feel her body surrounding me. It felt as if she was more magic than a real person.\n\nMy eyes grew wide, and I went forward to touch, to indulge in her, but Melinda stopped me.\n\n“See? You didn’t want me, didn’t want Melinda, but those feelings, the magic of that other place.”\n\n“But... it’s gone now, isn’t it?”\n\n“You can find it again, the Oneiria, the magic, all of it.”\n\n“What about you?”\n\n“Me? What do you think I am?”\n\n“You are...”\n\nAs much as I tried, I couldn’t answer her question.\n\n“Nothing but a dream,” Melinda whispered into my ear.\n\nA moment later, she was gone, leaving me alone in the empty room.\n\nIt’s been days since then. Even now, I can’t make sense of what happened. Neither can I make sense of who, or what, Melinda truly was.\n\nYet at night, I often dream of that place, a place where magic is real. It’s a place where I am truly a witch. Sometimes, out of the corner of my eye, I catch a glimpse of her, of a woman with cropped blond hair, and bright green eyes who’s boding me forward to join her.\n\nWhenever I awake from those dreams, I’m filled with the utmost fear, but a fear that’s different from that of any other nightmares.\n\nFor as much as I oppose it, as much as I don’t want to go, I long for it with every fiber of my being.\n\nI know that eventually, I will go back to those back alley scene clubs, those frequented by the weirder, more alternative parts of the population.\n\nAnd one day, regardless if I want to or not, I know I will indulge in it again, [indulge in Oneiria.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=UpdateMeBot&amp;subject=Subscribe&amp;message=SubscribeMe!%20%2Fr%2Fnosleep%20%2Fu%2FRehnWriter)\n\n[YT](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXKQbQnB1k_FTnTMyNudIFA/)\n\n[WS](https://rehnwriter.com/)",

        "text": " My ex-husband always used to jumpscare me. It was one of the things I hated the most about him. Well, he’s doing it again. The most frustrating part is that he’s been dead for five years. \n\nAt first I was just slightly put off by it. It was in the earliest days of dating him. If he’d be at my apartment and maybe I excused myself to use the bathroom, he’d be waiting in some doorway or shadow to jump out and scare the shit out of me. It was even worse at his house. He lived way out in the middle of freaking nowhere and I was pretty much always low level freaked out there. But then he’d leap out from around a corner and I’d be so scared and pissed off, I’d be ready to break up with him then and there. \n\nIn retrospect, that’s obviously what I should’ve done. But, I guess we all ignore our own inner voices sometimes, don’t we? Well, obviously, or there wouldn’t be so many people posting on NoSleep trying to get other people to help them with some dire problem they created by doing something stupid. \n\nAnd yet, here we are. \n\nI don’t know why I let it slide, honestly. And that was only one of the many things about him that were… Terrible. Nonetheless, I repeatedly told him to cut that shit out, and I repeatedly did nothing when he failed to cut that shit out. Eventually, I even married him. \n\nHe had two kids from a former marriage who stayed with us a lot, and then when they were there, there were also nieces and nephews staying over too. I always liked when there was a house full of kids. It made the old drafty falling down farmhouse we lived in slightly less terrifying. But, count on my ex husband to fuck up a good thing. We were in the living room with all the kids, it was late at night. The kids were all still rowdy and playing around, he and I were on the couch. There was a scary movie playing which nobody was really paying attention to. \n\nBut, Eric, my ex, got this funny look on his face and said quietly to me, “Watch this.” Then he put his finger to his lips to express that I should keep quiet. I instantly knew he was probably thinking of orchestrating some huge jumpscare on all these kids. Even though he had actually given me warning at least, I just didn’t want him to do it. The youngest child there was only four. I knew it would immediately kill the good vibes. I tried to protest, but he shushed me again and then scurried off to some other part of the house, unnoticed by any of the kids. \n\nI sighed angrily. I even tried to warn the kids, but they were all hyper and not listening. Seconds later, Eric showed up outside the screen door and revved his chainsaw. \n\nThe kids LOST it. One of his daughters actually blasted backwards and got airborne in her desperation to get away from the door. The four year old (of course) burst into hysterical tears, and soon they were all crying. \n\nNow, some of you reading this are probably laughing and thinking, that’s actually epic. But, the thing was it was just so damn OLD. He did this dumb shit ALL THE TIME. Plus, the world can really be boiled down into precisely two types of people. People who think it’s funny to scare four year olds so they cry, and people who don’t. So, readers, I suppose you’ve sorted yourselves into teams at this point. \n\nFast Forward a few years from the dumbass chainsaw incident, and Eric and I had our own son. The thing about our son was that he had major, and I mean MAJOR, heart problems at birth. He had to have open heart surgery and also had a whole shitload of other complications. Now, that’s not the point of the story, but just know that the first eight months of his life were VERY touch and go. Then he was finally doing better, stronger, able to do more. \n\nHe was nine months old and sitting on my lap, facing me. We were just playing and chattering at each other, when Eric lunged up behind him, grabbed him, and shouted. \n\nMy little son did that thing little kids do where for one full second you don’t know if they’re going to burst into hysterical tears or burst into laughter. In the end, my son burst into laughter. And so did Eric. I, on the other hand, was livid. Who jumpscares an infant, first of all? And secondly, who the hell jumpscares and infant HEART PATIENT? \n\nThat was probably the rudest I’d ever been to Eric about the jumpscare thing, but he just kept laughing. Laughed the whole thing off, like he always did. \n\nAnyway, that wasn’t why I divorced him, but we were divorced by the time our son was three. The shared custody arrangement of our son went about how you’d expect things to go with a douchebag. But, life plodded along. \n\nWhen our son was about 10, he went through this phase where he started getting insanely jumpy. I mean, he just seemed incredibly paranoid. If I walked close to him, or made any sudden movements, he would flinch. Almost like he thought I was going to hit him. At first it actually sort of hurt my feelings because I had never hit my son, I didn’t understand why he was being so jumpy with me. \n\nThen it started to scare me because I wondered if someone else was hitting him. Maybe he was being bullied at school. He didn’t go to his father’s all that much, and I didn’t imagine Eric would ever hit him, but what if? \n\nBut then I remembered the jumpscaring. I finally thought to ask my son about it. He immediately revealed that yes, his dad jumpscared him all the time. \n\n“It’s kind of annoying, Mom,” he told me. \n\nWell yeah, no shit, I thought. I couldn’t believe I’d forgotten about it. I was so mad. He only spent limited time with our son. Why was Eric spending it jumpscaring him so much that it was making him nervous and anxious ALL the time? What a shit heel. \n\nThe problem was that Eric was the sort of “co parent” that if I asked him for help with anything, or to back me up on anything, he would do the exact opposite, just to be spiteful. Asking nicely never worked with him. So if it wasn’t something a court would force him to stop, I really didn’t even bother asking, because I knew he would just get worse. And let’s face it, no family court is going to give a shit about jumpscaring. I was mad as hell, but there wasn’t much I could really do about it. \n\nFortunately, he took the liberty of dying, and that took care of that. \n\nI don’t mean to sound callous. Obviously my son struggled with the death of his father. But the jumpiness subsided basically instantly after he found out his dad was dead. Now, if your child’s mental health IMPROVES because you died, it’s possible you were a shitty parent. I’m just saying. \n\nAnyhow, another five years went by and then I wrecked my car because a cat jumped out in front of me. \n\nI sat there in shock, gripping the steering wheel of my wrecked car. As I tried to catch my breath and make sense of what had just happened, I noticed something strange. The air around me had grown cold, and a chill ran down my spine. I looked around, but no one was there. I tried to shake it off and focus on getting out of the car, but then I heard it.\n\nA low, guttural laugh echoed around me, and I froze. It sounded like my ex-husband's laugh. The man who had tormented me for years, emotionally and physically. I felt a surge of anger and fear wash over me, and I knew I needed to get out of there.\n\nI managed to escape the car and run to my house, but the eerie feeling never left me. \n\nOver the next few days, strange things started to happen. I would hear footsteps in the hallway, even though no one was there. Objects would move on their own, and the temperature would drop suddenly. As I walked by the window glass of a shop on a sunny day, my own reflection seemed to lunge at me and scared the life out of me. \n\nA drinking glass exploded on the counter.\n\nDoors slammed at night. \n\nBooks fell from the shelves landing with a thunk in a plume of dust.\n\nAs the days passed, I realized that it wasn't just any spirit haunting me. It was my ex-husband, and he was using his ghostly powers to jump scare me from beyond the grave. The realization left me terrified. If he could do all of this, what else was he capable of?\n\nI tried to find help, but no one believed me. They thought I was just imagining things or suffering from post-traumatic stress. \n\nSleep deprived and desperate, I found myself in a police station explaining the whole thing to a frazzled cop. He glared at me tersely and I felt like an idiot. \n\nA gunshot rang out even as I told my story. The entire precinct jumped at what ended up being a gun going off by accident. Even so, the cop didn’t believe me (of course) and sent me out into the rainy night, terrified of my own shadow.\n\nI was alone, trapped in a nightmare that I couldn't escape from.\n\nNow, as I sit here in my dark and silent house, I can feel his presence all around me. I was awoken moments ago when my bedroom door cracked violently into the wall. \n\nI know that at any moment, he could jump scare me again. And this time, I fear it won't just be a harmless prank. \n\nI’m sitting here curled in a ball, shaking as I type this. I’m just trying to get it out. Trying to leave behind my story because I know it’s only a matter of time… Until he scares me to death.",

        "text": "“Jesus Christ, alright, I’ll get an Uber!” I told Frank when I made to leave the party. I’d only had a few drinks, but he was insistent that I not drive home. Though it’d be a pain in the ass to come back the next day to pick up my car, I relented and pulled out my phone as I walked out the door.\n\nFor a minute, I considered walking. My apartment was only a mile or so away, but it was New Year’s Eve and the temperature was in the teens. Wind whipped down the sidewalk, drifting new fallen snow at my ankles while I pulled my coat tightly around my neck.\n\n‘Fuck it.’ I thought. ‘I’ll deal with the rush charge to not freeze my nuts off.’\n\nThankfully, I was downtown and there were plenty of drivers out looking to make some cash to pay off holiday debt. In fact, when I put in my address, the app showed there was someone right around the corner making a drop…they’d arrive in three minutes.\n\n‘Good. I can tough it out for a few minutes…I don’t think I could go back inside and deal with Frank’s bullshit for another second.’ I fumed. I knew he was right to stop me from driving, but at the moment all I could focus on was that I was freezing and he was costing me $40.\n\nI checked the app to see who’d be picking me up. Joe…average looking white dude…bald…navy blue Camry…4539 reviews…4.5 starts. Perfectly normal.\n\nAs I watched the little car on my phone navigating the digital streets, I turned my attention to the physical intersection it should eventually approach from and saw headlights advancing my direction. It looked like a little sedan and, as it passed under a streetlight, I saw a Toyota logo in the grate. But, when I looked back down at my phone, Joe was still two blocks away. ‘Must be someone else.’ I assumed, and went back to watching the app.\n\nHowever, out of the corner of my eye I saw the car slow as it neared, eventually making a full stop right in front of where I was standing. While the street was fairly poorly lit, I could at least make out that it was a dark, Toyota sedan and behind the wheel appeared to be a bald white man. The passenger side window rolled down, and the driver leaned over.\n\n“Hello Kevin.” He said.\n\nHis voice had an unctuous quality that was innately off-putting. I checked my app again and it showed Joe was still a block away.\n\n“Joe?” I asked, leaning down to get a better look in the window. Unfortunately, there were no distinctive features in his profile picture for me to compare to (scars, tattoos, hook nose), so in the dim light, the best I could make out was he looked similar enough in person.\n\n“Of course.” He replied. “Hurry up and get in. I have many rides to give tonight.”\n\nThe app was still showing Joe stopped at an intersection a block away, but with the insane demand of a holiday weekend, I figured it must be a glitch. There was a car right in front of me and the driver knew my name, which I surmised he could have only gotten from the app when I ordered the car. To be honest, the guy was giving me the creeps, but I had my concealed carry and we didn’t have far to go. I hopped in the backseat.\n\n“Welcome to your ride, Kevin.” Said Joe, as he pulled away from the curb.\n\n“Uh…thanks man…” I settled into the backseat. He must have had the heat on full blast as it was blisteringly hot inside. Even though I’d been shivering seconds earlier, I began to sweat almost instantly.\n\nHaving taken many Uber rides prior, I expected to see a phone mounted somewhere in the front giving him directions, but there was nothing of the sort. He wasn’t watching a map…actually he wasn’t even watching the road…his eyes were fixed on me in the rearview mirror. The hairs on the back of my neck prickled.\n\n“I’m pleased to have you, Kevin. We have much to discuss.” His expression…mischievous.\n\nI went from a bit creeped out to vigilant. Something was very off about Joe. That slimy voice percolated my very skin and settled in my bones. Reaching into my waistband, I wrapped my hand around the grip of my pistol…just in case.\n\nHe grinned widely. “Oh you won’t be needing that.” He said.\n\nThat was enough for me. I didn’t know how he knew who I was or who the fuck he was, but instinctively I understood danger. Drawing my weapon, I pointed it straight at his head.\n\n“Look man, I don’t know what the fuck this is, but you’re going to let me out of this car right now!” I clicked the safety off to let him know that I was serious.\n\nHe didn’t flinch…didn’t even look surprised really…if I had to describe it, he almost looked bored…maybe even a little annoyed. “Tsk tsk Kevin…so quick to violence. I told you that you wouldn’t need that. We’re just going to talk.”\n\nThe gun burned white-hot in my hand, searing my flesh. I dropped it to the floorboard and could see the Beretta logo imprinted in my palm.\n\n‘What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck??’ My mind raced. I reached for the door handle and pulled it over and over…nothing happened. I pulled on the lock, but it wouldn’t move. I was trapped.\n\nIt was then that I looked out the window and saw that we were moving quickly. Much too quickly for traveling on city streets. Lights were flashing past, blending to a streaking blur. We were accelerating at an inhuman pace…all the while his eyes never flickered from the mirror.\n\nI considered attacking him with my bare hands, thinking if I could knock him out, maybe I could get control of the vehicle. ‘But, will I be able to knock him out?’ I wondered. There was a distinctly malignant essence about him lending me to believe he would not be wounded by mortal means.\n\nDread seeded in the pit of my stomach as I sat back and accepted the futility of my situation. There was nothing I could do…I was at his mercy.\n\n“That’s it, Kevin. Sit back…relax…as I said, I just want to talk.” His tone mimicked soothing, but each syllable dripped with enmity.\n\nI did my best to compose myself. He clearly had all the power there, but all he was doing was watching me. What did he want?\n\n“Okay…what is this? Who are you…or rather…what are you?” I asked.\n\n“I told you, Kevin, this is your ride. And who I am is irrelevant, I am different to everyone that I meet. To you I’m Joe, to Joe I might be Mary, to Mary I might even be you. I am whoever I need to be. What I am though…is an opportunity.” He said with shrewd efficacy.\n\n“An opportunity…what the hell does that even mean? All I want is to go home. Please just let me go home. I’ll give you anything that you want.” I pleaded.\n\n“Oh, but you already have. You see, you don’t remember, but you and I have met before.” He paused, allowing his words to sink in.\n\nFaster we kept moving. The heat rising by the minute.\n\n“What are you talking about? I’ve never met you before, at least not that I remember…was I drunk or something?” I wracked my memories trying to recall a previous interaction.\n\n“You misunderstand me. You and I have not met before, but YOU and I have met…in your previous life. I am what’s known as a Broker, and WE made a deal.” Again he paused, watching my reaction in the mirror.\n\n“What the fuck does that mean?? This doesn’t make any sense…I don’t remember anything about a previous life…I don’t remember ever meeting you before or making any sort of deal with you. Please just let me out!” I continued to plead with him.\n\n“What you remember matters not to me. I remember every deal I’ve ever made, and yours has a term that’s coming due. In exchange for wealth and status in your last life…you offered me this one.” Delight flashed across his edifice.\n\nFaster and faster. Hotter and hotter.\n\nAt this point, I was in a blind panic. “How can you hold me responsible for something I did in a previous life…something that you know I don’t remember doing? That wasn’t me, that was some other guy!” What he was saying was ludicrous, but I inherently knew it to be true.\n\n“Humans. Always so focused on the present…never thinking in terms of the eternal. Of course that was YOU! YOU signed the agreement without a second thought! I told you that the more you asked for, the more years I would take off your next life…that I would come to claim your soul once the remaining years were spent…that you would be damned for all eternity. YOU didn’t care! Your own greed limited this life to just thirty years. Tell me Kevin, was it worth it?” Malicious glee filled his voice. He was lavishing in my torment, cackling as I started to cry.\n\n“I don’t know!! I don’t remember any of it! Please forgive me, please forgive the debt! I’m so sorry! I take it back!” I knew now that I wasn’t just begging for my life, I was begging for my very soul.\n\nHis revelry peaked. “You can’t take it back now! That life was already lived! I held up my end of the bargain, now it’s time for you to hold up yours!”\n\nThe engine roared as our impossible acceleration continued. The sweltering heat…unbearable.\n\n“Please, please there has to be some way! You said you’re a Broker…let’s make a deal. There must be something I can offer you?” Beseeching him for any way out.\n\n“As I’ve told you repeatedly, our deal was already made! I’ve merely come to collect payment.” He responded maniacally.\n\nDespair gripped my heart and pumped anguish through my veins. There was nothing I could do… “But wait, you said this life would be limited to thirty years…I’m not thirty yet. I don’t turn thirty until November.”\n\nHis demeanor shifted. The fervent depravity with which he’d sealed my fate abated and he became almost businesslike.\n\n“Ah, yes…Well, as I mentioned, I am here to offer you an opportunity. I’ve watched your life since the day you were born and my patience is waning. Miserable existence you’ve had really…I can’t imagine why you’d want to continue with it. But, I always keep my word…so, you have a choice. You can come with me now and we can take this ride straight down into the abyss…or I can drop you off at home. You’ll have a few more months before I return…but know that I will return. This ride is inevitable.” He offered.\n\nMy immediate reaction was to ask to go home, it’s all I’d been asking for since he picked me up. Surely that’s still what I wanted…to go home and have a little more time with my life before forever. But what he’d said was true. My life so far had been wasted. I’d done nothing of note, impressed no one, left no legacy… ‘If I take the ride with him now…I’ll be forgotten within a year.’ I thought veraciously. What really, then, was the point of going on when I’d have a death sentence looming?\n\nHe waited patiently for my answer, never blinking, just watching me in the mirror. Finally…I decided. “No…no I don’t want to go with you now…I want to go home.”\n\nWhatever I was returning to in my life, at least it was ‘known’. Where he’d be taking me…well I didn’t want to think about that yet.\n\nFor the first time, he looked slightly surprised, yet he simply shrugged his shoulders and said, “As you wish…I will be seeing you, Kevin.”\n\nAnd suddenly, we were parked in front of my building. The locks clicked…I reached for the handle and pulled…the door opened. Without a seconds hesitation, I dove out into the snow, slamming the door behind me before sprinting as fast as I could away from “Joe.” I never looked back.\n\nOnce I got into my apartment, I downed shots of whiskey until my hands stopped shaking…enough to make me believe maybe it wasn’t real…maybe someone at the party had spiked the punch with LSD… Eventually I passed out on the couch.\n\nWhen I awoke the next morning, I momentarily forgot “Joe”. The normalcy of waking up with a hangover in my living room reinforced the fallacy that my life had not been inexorably altered. That is, until I looked down at the palm of my hand…and saw the Beretta logo…",

        "text": "\nHello,\n\nI am Simon Phillips, I live a simple quiet life,  in a rural village in England. I work weekdays, I spend my evenings and weekends with my wife of 8 years Louise. We go on holiday once a year and we enjoy a date night every Thursday. So I just don’t understand why this has happened, to me.\n\nI really need some help or if anyone out there has experienced something similar, please let me know!\n\nIt was Tuesday 22nd February 2022.\n\nI went to work like any other day, I grabbed a latte from the local coffee shop en route and got into the office around 25 minutes before I was due to start. I liked to get my workload in order before the pending chaos of emails and phone calls ensued. I work in a small but busy sales office and I have been working there for the last 3 years. I was, and still am a creature of habit, after my morning of endless emails, phone calls and meetings. I would spend my lunch break walking the surrounding area. The two-story office building was situated on an industrial estate surrounded by farms and woodlands. I would walk down the road onto a dusted trail in a loop. I had it worked out perfectly to get me back in time to pick up with the rest of my day. \n\nThis day was like any other, I left my desk at 1pm and made my way down the stairwell towards the main door. As I stepped outside my eyes were met with a blanket of gloomy grey clouds as a slight breeze blew across my face.  There wasn’t supposed to be any rain but I grabbed my umbrella from my car anyway. The handful of times I had been caught in a sudden downpour mid-stroll were playing on my mind. I didn’t want to spend the rest of the day sitting  at my desk like a drowned rat, I thought to myself. \n\nAs I made my way down the winding unmarked road leading out of the industrial area, I waved and gave a slight smile to a colleague driving past me. I then peeled off the farm lined road onto a public footpath running between the fields littered with wild irises. I pulled my phone from my pocket and called Louise. We spoke about her morning at home. She had a remote office set up in our study, she’d been working  at home since the pandemic started, as her marketing job didn’t require her to go to the office. \n\n“So how was your morning babe?” Louise asked after finishing a bite of her leftover pasta.\n\n“Ok, you know, just busy as ever, just glad to get out the office” I replied. \n\n“Yeah, at least you get a break now, is it raining where you are?” She inquired.\n\n“Luckily not, I did bring my umbrella though!” I said in a triumphant tone.\n\n“I think you’re going to need it, as it started raining here about 10 minutes ago” she warned.\n\nFor reference, I worked about 15 miles away from our house we would normally get each others bad weather about half an hour later depending on the wind direction and speed.\n\n“Oh great! I’m about half way through my walk” I replied\n\nI made my way through a wooded area as the twigs broke under my feet and the birds sung in the vast trees around me, I could smell the impending rain. \n\n“At least you’ve got your umbrel…”\n\nThe line cut out half way through Louise’s sentence.\n\n“Hello? Louise?” I called out while glancing at my phone. \n\nMy signal suddenly escaped me. The woods then fell eerily quiet, the wind had almost no power to it, and the scent of rain had left the air. Most unusually of all the birds had stopped there midday song, I jumped as a flash of what I assumed was lightning lit up the trees around me. I kept trying to call Louise back but to no avail. I could see through the trees ahead, that I was nearing the end of the now unsettling woods. As I approached the road that would lead me back to my workplace. A bald headed man, wearing a black fitted suit and tie emerged from the right side of the trail opening, he was extremely tall and thin, with dark sunken eyes and a pale complexion. He slowly walked past while his shadowy eyes stared directly at me.\n\nThey then disappeared out of view, just as the birds began to sing and the rain filtered through the enclosed canopy above. My signal had not returned as I made my way through the trail end. I looked to my left to try to see the man, who had home past me only a minute ago. As I studied the long straight road, I looked both ways but no one was there. \n\nI walked back down the road, my skin felt prickly and my head felt dizzy and disoriented. I put this down to the humidity in the air and the fine light rain falling around me. I glanced at my phone once more, I still had no signal but I noticed something really strange, the date read ‘Wednesday 24 February’. That wasn’t right, it was Tuesday, I knew it was Tuesday from the dozens of emails I had sent earlier that morning. I scrolled over to my calendar, it was also showing 22nd February 2023. That yet again couldn’t be right, It was 2022, I may have easily got the day wrong, but the year? No way. I neared my office and was going to put my umbrella back in my car. \n\nIt was gone - my car was no longer parked there, I had only took my umbrella out of it just 45 minutes earlier and now it was gone. I was starting to get panicked, was I losing my mind? I walked up to the main door, my breath coming in short gasps as I held my key fob up to the scanner. The door didn’t unlock. I tried again my breathing getting deeper the more freaked out I got. I had used it to get in this morning with no issues, I pressed the buzzer for someone to let me in. I could see Steve, the IT guy approach the door, he got a few feet away and stopped for a moment as the colour drained from his face. His eyes were wide and his mouth slightly open, he looked as though he had seen something terrifying. I looked over my shoulder as I looked back in confusion.\n\n“Steve? Are you going to let me in?!” I said mildly irritated.\n\nHe held one finger up, gesturing for me to wait a moment. He turned and went up the stairs to his left, this only made me even more anxious. \nA few moments later he came back down the stairs, followed by my manager Carl and the owner of the company Graham. As each one of them took their last step down and turned the corner, I could see their faces drop. I didn’t know what was happening, was I in trouble? Had I done something wrong and was fired? I just didn’t know what was going on. Graham opened the door.\n\n“SSimon?” He stuttered out in disbelief. \n\n“Errr, yes Graham, has something happened” I worryingly asked.\n\n“How, How are you here” He responded.\n\n“ I went out for lunch?” I blankly said while thinking I was the butt of some horrible joke.\n\n“Simon, you’ve been missing, no one has seen or heard from you in a year?” Graham explained while taking a large gulp.\n\n“What do you mean?” I asked while looking at Carl and Steve. \n\n“Carl, could you call the police station, please ask for detective Chambers” Graham said while gesturing Carl to hurry. \n\n“It’s OK Simon, come up to my office and we’ll wait for the police to get here” Graham said, now speaking in a calming but slightly patronising tone.\n\nI didn’t understand, my mind was racing and so was my thumping heart. I just felt sick deep in my stomach, a deep rooted sickness pulsing through my body. I walked slowly through my office, all of my colleagues just stared at me, I swear you could of heard a pin drop at that moment. I went past my desk, there was a girl sat there speaking on the phone. I had never seen her before, nor had I ever seen the guy next to her. I think in that moment, I finally started realising something very serious had happened. As I sat in the office I could see Carl and Graham outside both on their phones. I sat there for what seemed like hours, with my head trying to get around what was happening.\n\nTwo official looking men then approached the office, I could see that they had a quick talk with Graham and Carl but I couldn’t quite make out what they were saying. They then proceeded to open the door, they introduced themselves as Detective Chambers and Thompson as they sat down. They asked me to relay to them what I remember up until this point, I explained to them very much how I am now to you. I had a sudden shock thought while I was explaining. \n\n“Louise, I need to speak to my wife!” I said  in a forceful and panicked tone. \n\n“Simon, your wife has been informed and will meet us at the station, okay?” Detective Chambers said, trying to calm me.\n\nI continued to give my statement of events, they both seemed very interested by the man I saw walk past in the woods. I told them all I could about him but it all happened in a matter of seconds so I couldn’t be sure on exact details. Once I had given them everything I could remember I traveled with them to the station.\n\nWhen I arrived Louise, my parents and my brother Paul were waiting for me. They all were incredibly emotional, they said that it was like I had ‘come back from the dead’ but for me it seemed as though only a day had passed. I was still wearing the same shirt, trousers and shoes I had put on this morning, well, last year now I guess? \n\nWhen I got home, my car was parked on our drive, I don’t think it had been touched in months. I could see a difference in Louise, she didn’t look well, like she hadn’t slept in days. I just felt so guilty for what I had seemingly put everyone through. That night Louise held me so tight I couldn’t move, I felt like that was the best nights sleep she had had in a year. I’m still fully trying to process what happened and get up to speed with what I have missed. I have spent the day looking through all of the Facebook missing posts about me, that were shared throughout the area. The days and weeks of searches, after I didn’t show up back at work or home the evening after. There was even an apparent sighting of me at the train station in the town near my worked. The whole thing is just freaking me out and worst thing of all is I still just had no idea what happened to me. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any suggestions that might make me remember.\n———————————————————\nUpdate: \nI came across this post in my drafts on my rarely used Reddit account, I will leave the original title and text unaltered. This appears to be in my own words and all of the basic facts are correct but I don’t remember typing any of this or this ever happening to me? I haven’t lost a year, everything has been pretty much the same. The strange thing is, it appears to be dated as being written and saved yesterday.\n\nThe one disconcerting thing that sticks in my mind from reading through all this, is the man in the black suit. I have been seeing someone of that description for the last year or so, either out of the corner of my eye, passing me in the street or driving behind me as I made my way to work. The most unnerving part is I have frequently seen him walk past the end of the woods during my lunch time walks, just how it’s described in this post. He just seems to always be there. The man never approaches me or speaks to me, we have only ever made eye contact once. That one time we locked eyes, as he walked past me as I made my way to the local shop, I remember feeling an uneasy shiver go down my spine. \n\nI have tried to tell Louise about him and also showed her this post I found on here but she just looked at me like I was crazy, like I had made it all up to freak her out. I even showed and spoke to my colleagues at work, but they all brushed it off as my overactive imagination.\n\nBut I am certain I have been seeing that same man written in this draft post, and I know deep down that there is something weird going on. I can’t put my finger on what it is or what it means, but I know, I just can't ignore it anymore. I need to find out if something happened to me. \n\nNext time I see the man in the black suit, I’m going to speak to him.\n\nI will update you all soon, hopefully I will have some answers to give you.",

        "text": "In the world of a private reporter, one can and likely will be subject to a variety of strange occurrences. The allure to this, for me at least, is that I strive to be the first to document them and decode the underlying mysteries.\n\nThe story I’m working on at the moment is unlike anything I’ve seen before. Truly, it’s the most bizarre incident I’ve ever had the pleasure of investigating. Well, maybe pleasure isn’t the right word to describe yesterday’s events, but I would be a liar to say that this one hasn’t got me riled up.\n\n.\n\nMy name is Lewis Amar – that’s “Ay-mar” – though most refer to me as “Lou” in person. Perhaps excessive syllables aren’t worth the time for most, but I’ve never objected to the name. I’ve been a private reporter, investigator to an extent, for the majority of my adult life. I suppose that, in some ways, my passion is similar to that held by mountain climbers, cavers, and other such hobbyists, in the endless search for virgin territory, to sink the teeth into.\n\nBut, as evidenced by my experience, some things are not worth the intrigue, and are better left alone, to stagnate outside of public awareness.\n\nI’m getting ahead of myself. Let me begin at the beginning, at the flame which ignited the trailing fuse.\n\nI live in a relatively large town in Utah, you know, the red-rock type of place, broiling summers and usually mild winters. The cold is dispelled much by the town’s surroundings, sheltered by hills and mountains – though, on the flip side, it turns into a greenhouse out of hell in the hotter months as a result.\n\nAll of this started yesterday. I’ve been running dry on juicy stories to dig into for a few weeks, and was just going about my weekly routines.\n\nI found myself ambling down the cracked pavement, heading to my favourite grocery store to stock up. I mean, there wasn’t anything massively special about Rockamart, but I always found the staff there to be the friendliest of all, often finding myself late to other deadlines for the day as I lost myself in conversation with Jimmy, the store clerk.\n\nMy usual venture was cut short when I spotted a boy stumbling down the road. Not the pavement, the road. He couldn’t have been more than 17, and he seemed to be in a fugue state. This wasn’t a huge shock to me, seeing as the heat could quickly force heat stroke on a person if they aren’t careful about sunscreen and water intake, even in the Spring months.\n\nI slowed my pace, scuffing my trainers on the asphalt, and whipped out my phone to take a recording of this, just in case anything concerning happened. It took a considerable amount of time for the teen to wobble his way close enough to discern anything else, but when he did, my worry started to blossom upon seeing the details.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was his eyes. He didn’t seem to have any control over them whatsoever, instead lazily rolling around in his sockets, like poorly-fitting glass eyes. Full-on googly-eyes. I’m glad I decided to film him in retrospect, because it became apparent that he was babbling about something. His words were messy, as if haphazardly plucked out of an alphabet soup. The only words I caught at the time were, “we take, it takes”, “can’t, stop knowing” and “give it back”.\n\nOf course, all this meant nothing to me at first. Simply the sun-beaten ramblings of someone who needed assistance. I moved toward him with the intention of helping, which seemed to draw his attention. He almost tripped over as he turned toward me, before messily walk-jogging his way over. In an instant, he had his dry, almost scaly hands wrapped around my shoulders, uttering further nonsense in an apparent attempt to tell me something of utmost importance.\n\nI kept recording, though the footage consisted only of the boy’s dusty tank-top and frayed jean-shorts. Other than his previous phrases, I wasn’t able to catch onto much else, other than his frequent repetition of variations of, “stop thinking!”.\n\nI tried to pry myself from his grip, but his hands were white-knuckled in determination to tell me something, an effort which in the end amounted to nothing. I started to panic, fearing he might accidentally hurt me in his stupor. Images of my skull cracked open on the curb flashed across my mind, when a strange movement within his eyes caught my attention.\n\nIt looked like his eyes were reflecting some dazzling light source, dancing around on their glassy surfaces. I only saw this for a moment before the kid’s eyelids drooped, and he loosened his grip. He proceeded to stumble his way down the road a while longer, before catching his foot on the curb and meeting the fate I had previously imagined awaiting me. I heard a sickening crack as his forehead struck the dry pavement and the shape of his head notably shifted on the inside.\n\nOf course I was stunned at what I had just witnessed, but I was present enough to notice that despite such a fatal head injury, blood leaked from his head as infrequent droplets, leading to bright crimson splashes against the contrast of the drab asphalt – normally, such an accident would leave a miniature, sanguine pond in its wake, but not this time.\n\nThe weight of the situation hit me and I resisted curiosity, to reel myself back from dissociated awe. My camera app was still recording, so I ended the video and pulled up the keypad, dialling 911 and requesting immediate medical assistance.\n\nDuring the 5 or 10 minutes before the ambulance arrived, I made my way over to the boy and rolled him onto his side. With his hair hanging back, I could see the injury in full, and it was not as bad as I had suspected. Still, no signs of life were left in the eyes of this poor kid, and his chest remained still. What lay before me was no longer a person, no thoughts or hopes bounding around in that dead skull.\n\nThe paramedics were quick to swipe him up and ship him away, but the futility was evident in their expressions, eyes hanging low. After they drove away at the solemn speed of a hearse, I was left standing alone, with no evidence for what just happened other than a few stray red drops on the road and, of course, my footage.\n\nI went about my grocery shopping without any attempts at socialising, and hurried home so as to review the footage, though most importantly to back it up. A mobile phone can be a fleeting thing in comparison to the online storage service I’d been subscribed to for some years now.\n\nSo, I got home, unpacked, then set my focus on rewatching the video, over and over, in hopes I could unearth something I hadn’t at first noticed.\n\nHonestly, the guy was so out of it, I wasn’t able to decrypt very much other than a few things.\n\nFirst, I noticed a detail that had been glossed over before. Around the upper portion of the kid’s head, there was a very faint mark, circling the perimeter of his skull. It was no surprise I hadn’t noticed it, seeing as how faint it was, but it looked something like pink scar tissue. There was no point in going any further with this, with no background on this guy, but it went into my notepad nonetheless.\n\nSecond and lastly, I was indeed able to make out some more of his words, but the rest remained a nonsensical tumble-dryer of letters and sounds. Most of what I could discern is irrelevant to my writing here, but at two points in the video I distinctly made out the words:\n\n“North… north, west, no-wes, western. In the up, hills, at the... the, between these peaks, the red and the dust and the red and the rust.”\n\nThis may seem useless to even consider building upon, but as a journalist those words made a big difference in this new project. Well, not at first, at the end of the day it was just a tragic event, a life removed too soon, but my loose transcript proved its true worth after meeting with one of my good friends, Davis, who just so happened to be in the local police division.\n\nI’d contacted him about what had happened, and to my surprise he replied with an invitation, rather than the fleeting interest I’d expected. Apparently, an autopsy was required as the boy’s death couldn’t be sufficiently explained by his head injury, which was found to be minor. Davis asked if I was free to meet in a local park later in the day, so we could discuss the mystery surrounding this kid. Something about a staggering post-mortem discovery.\n\nSo, as planned, I met with Davis on the Jerusalem Green. I found him smoking on a park bench overlooking the park, but he didn’t seem overjoyed upon seeing me. He looked more, well, paranoid than anything. After finding my seat, he skipped any formalities and was straight to the point.\n\n“So, uh, you know I could get in a LOT of shit for this, Lou. I don’t wanna be here too long.”\n\n“Yeah, yeah of course. I really appreciate your help here, man.”\n\n“Okay, I’m gonna make this quick. This the kind of case that gets the attention of the higher-ups, so I’ll tell you this once, and once only. Kid’s name was Aiden O'Leary.”\n\nHis serious tone quickly had the same effect on me, and I lowered my voice, glancing left to right a couple of times to make sure we had no unwelcome eavesdroppers.\n\nWe sat in silence for a moment, as I stared at Davis expectantly.\n\n“So, you know how they had to do the autopsy? Couldn’t determine a believable cause of death, so they cut him open, yada yada… well they, erm… they ended up examining his brain, sawing through bone, you get the picture.”\n\n“Damn. That’s… did they figure out what happened to him? Brain damage, stroke, something like that?”\n\n“They found nothing.”\n\n“Oh, well that’s unfortunate, I guess- “\n\n“No, Lewis, they found *nothing*. Literally. Kid was hollow-headed, and not in the metaphorical sense. No brain, not even any residual parts. Some evil fuck cut his head open, most likely.”\n\nEven being second-hand to this revelation, I was shocked, and appalled that anyone could do this to an adolescent. It dawned on me after processing what I’d just heard, the glaringly obvious sore thumb about the whole thing.\n\n“Then… how was he alive? And how long for?”\n\nMy question garnered no response. Instead, Davis just sat there, dead-eyed, and slowly shaking his head. I relented, and just sat with him, sharing a moment of baffled silence.\n\n“I can’t tell ya anything else, man. I’m already risking my job, so if you don’t mind, I’ll be off now. Nice seeing ya.”\n\nAnd with that, he was gone, back on his daily schedule.\n\nThe walk back was slow, energy redirected into my thoughts as I ran through the endless possibilities of explanations which might change the pure impossibility of the incident. Even after getting back and sitting at my desk, my fingers lay idly on the work surface as my mind raced in a desperate effort to understand.\n\nI haven’t come to any adequate conclusion yet, so I’ve decided I’m going to look into the kid’s identity. See if I can’t find his socials, figure out what he’s been doing, where he was last seen… you get the idea.\n\nI’ll be contacting my partner in crime, Annie, also a journalist. Hopefully she’ll help in having a different perspective, something like that. Hopefully she’s not busy, but honestly, I have a feeling she’ll shelf whatever she’s working on in favour of looking into this, so if it works out we’ll be spending the rest of today doing research.\n\nI will post an update here if, or when, we figure something out.",

        "text": "I'm a police officer in a small town, and I've seen my fair share of strange and unsettling things. But nothing could have prepared me for what I encountered on one cold winter night. I was on patrol, driving through the quiet streets, when I received a call about a disturbance at an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. \n\nWhen I arrived on the scene, I could hear strange noises coming from inside the building. It sounded like scratching and scraping, as if something was trying to break through the walls. I drew my gun and cautiously approached the warehouse, calling out for anyone inside to come out with their hands up. But there was no response, only the sound of the scratching growing louder and more frantic. With my heart pounding, I kicked open the door and stepped inside, my gun at the ready.\n\nThe warehouse was pitch black, but I could see strange shadows moving in the corners of my vision. I called out again, demanding that whoever was inside reveal themselves. But again, there was no response. As I crept further into the darkness, the scratching and scraping grew louder and more frenzied. And then, suddenly, the noises stopped. I was plunged into an eerie silence, and I knew that something was very wrong.\n\nThat's when I felt it. A cold, clammy hand on my shoulder, gripping me tightly. I spun around, ready to fire my gun, but there was nothing there. And then, I saw it. A shadowy figure, barely visible in the darkness, hovering just out of reach. It was humanoid in shape, but with unnaturally long limbs and twisted features that seemed to twist and writhe in the shadows. I tried to back away, to call for backup, but the figure was too fast. It lunged at me with inhuman speed, and I felt its icy fingers wrap around my neck.\n\nThe next thing I knew, I was waking up in a hospital bed. My colleagues told me that they had found me lying unconscious in the warehouse, with no sign of the strange figure that had attacked me. But I knew what I had seen. And I knew that I would never forget the terror of that night, or the feeling of that cold, clammy hand on my shoulder. \" For weeks after the incident, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was following me, watching my every move.\n\nEvery shadow seemed to hold a secret, every sound a potential threat. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, and could barely function in my day-to-day life. As time went on, I tried to convince myself that it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. Maybe I had been too tired, too stressed, and had just imagined the whole thing. But deep down, I knew that wasn't the case.\n\nThen, one night, I received a call from a terrified woman who claimed that she was being followed by a shadowy figure. I rushed to her location, my heart racing with fear and anticipation. As I arrived at the woman's house, I could see that the windows were all boarded up, and the doors were heavily reinforced. She let me in, and I could see that she was trembling with fear.\n\nShe told me that she had been haunted by the shadowy figure for weeks, that it had been stalking her every move, and that she was convinced that it was going to kill her. I searched the house, but found no sign of the figure. But as I was leaving, I caught a glimpse of something in the corner of my eye. It was the shadowy figure, lurking just outside the window.\n\nI drew my gun and rushed outside, but the figure had disappeared once again. I searched the area, but found no trace of it. For weeks after that, I received similar reports from people all over town. The shadowy figure was back, and it seemed to be more powerful than ever. As the weeks turned into months, I became obsessed with finding out the truth about the figure.\n\nI spent all my free time researching the history of the town, looking for any clues that might help me understand what was happening.\" But no matter how much I searched, I couldn't find any concrete information about the figure. Some people believed that it was the spirit of a long-dead criminal, seeking revenge on the town that had wronged him. Others thought it was a manifestation of some kind of ancient curse, passed down through the generations.\n\nI tried to keep a level head, to rationalize the events and find a logical explanation. But as the reports of the figure continued to pour in, I knew that something had to be done.\n\nOne night, I decided to take matters into my own hands. Armed with my gun and a flashlight, I set out to track down the shadowy figure once and for all.\n\nI spent hours scouring the town, searching for any sign of the figure. And then, just as I was about to give up hope, I saw it.\n\nThe figure was standing at the edge of the town, just beyond the forest. It was larger than I remembered, with twisted limbs and glowing red eyes that seemed to pierce the darkness.\n\nI raised my gun and fired, but the bullets had no effect. The figure simply laughed, a cold, mocking sound that chilled me to the bone.\n\nAnd then, it spoke.\n\n\"You cannot defeat me,\" it said, in a voice that sounded like ice scraping against stone. \"I am eternal, and I will always be here, watching, waiting, and hunting.\"\n\nI backed away slowly, my heart pounding with fear and disbelief. And then, just as suddenly as it had appeared, the figure vanished into the night.\n\nFrom that day forward, I knew that the shadowy figure would always be with me, haunting me with its presence and reminding me of the terror that I had encountered on that cold winter night. But I also knew that I could never give up the fight, that I would always be searching for a way to defeat the figure and free my town from its grip of fear and darkness.",

        "text": "All my life, I’ve had problems sleeping. When I was a child, it was the monsters under the bed, the ghosts in the closet, or the gremlins in my drawers. When I was a teen, it was insomnia, anxiety over tests or girls, and the occasional Mountain dew induced binge.\n\nBut I’m an adult now, in a stable relationship at a stable job. I eat right, work out, and even took up meditating not too long ago. Still, I stare up at the ceiling some nights, others I sleep fitfully and wake up in the morning with aches and sores. The nights where I get more than three hours of shut eye are few and far between, and the only reason I can function during the day can be attributed to modern medicine.\n\nI don’t remember when it started, or for how long it had been going, but I remember when it turned for the worse. It was that day I jolted awake, not a particularly unique experience, except this time I felt my limbs spasming in a brief but violent frenzy. Somehow Nylah slept soundly, with no indication that I woke her, not even an annoyed grunt as she made sometimes when I would disturb her rest. Before my limbs jerked and mind returned to consciousness, I heard a sound. Except what my ears and brain told me made no sense, and the thick haze of drowsiness added further doubt to my assumption.\n\nIt sounded like a snap, like a branch had been cloven in two next to my head. I'd hoped that the mundane pondering of the strange sound, would welcome sleep – but I knew better. The quiet hiss of the heater, the gentle creaking of wood contracting in the cold, and the muted sounds of the world outside trickled into my ears. The thought of the strange sound and the noise outside kept sleep at bay until the sun finally rose, and Nylah along with it. I told her about my experience, to which she gave me an uninterested response. She knew about my history and how difficult it was for me to sleep. A sound jolting me awake in the middle of the night wouldn’t be a new terrifying concept to her, and it shouldn’t have been for me – *so why can’t I let it go?*\n\nThat day we went about business, overpaying for a mediocre brunch, running errands, and even went down to an outdoor rink for some ‘romantic ice skating’ as Nylah had pitched it.\n\nWhen night finally came, my anxiety was louder than usual as it scratched at the back of my mind. *Will it happen again?* I wondered, unsure if another episode would ruin what little rest I could claim. That night, I adopted a new posture of sleeping on my side, which thankfully produced results, my mind gracefully slipping into blankness.\n\nThat night was one of the rare times where I dreamt. It wasn’t a good dream, nor was it bad, at the time I felt nothing – which frightened me the most. I was in our room, the lights were off, and I was in the bed next to Nylah, still on my side and seeming to be sound asleep. It was a strange feeling to be watching myself from another perspective. *However,* *it’s not like dreams are known for their normalcy.* Nylah slept on her back, her face smooth as the sheets rose and fell with steady breaths. A blatant contrast to her state, I was making a strange noise; like something between a wince and moan while my body shifted and twitched in short and jagged movements.\n\nThe vehicle for my dream was tall, almost at the ceiling. I slid across the carpet in a strange silence, the eerily silent movement made even more poignant by the muted noise that managed to creep through the walls. It was strange, watching me glide across the floor while I’d sent no commands for my legs to move. I don’t know why I never tried to stop moving, or to wake up. Perhaps some part of me knew it was a dream, and that I wasn’t in any true danger. I felt calm, which was especially odd when a hand reached out towards my sleeping self. It was not a normal hand, wielding spindly digits of hairless, pale skin, fingers much longer than normal and thin like chopsticks. I remembered the chilling indifference, an empty boredom that dulled my thoughts and left me uncaring as the milky digits pressed against the back of my head. Immediately, my sleeping form stopped twisting and uncomfortably rustling. My body froze for a second, almost as if the fingers instructed me to be still.\n\n*It’s helping,* I thought. Not a second later, my body jerked, limbs spasming once more. Blinking in confusion, my eyes were open. The world was now sideways, my vision doused in ethereal blue from the moonlight creeping past the blinds. It took my mind a few seconds to put the pieces together, but when the memory flooded back in, I quickly turned over. Eyes snapping to where I’d been standing in the dream, there was nothing, just an empty wall.\n\nFor a while I tried to make sense of it. *What happened? What did he do to me? What did I do?*  Massaging the knotted muscles at the back of my head while staring off into the distance.\n\nAs my thoughts drifted, different possibilities flittered into my mind space. *Did that even happen?*I wondered at some point, it wouldn’t be the first time my overactive mind conjured a dream to explain the soreness in my knees or back when it twisted into uncomfortable positions. I’d had those moments before, but this felt different. The dream felt real, aside from the odd hand reaching out there was no strangeness that often accompanied my dreams. What’s more, the pain felt poignant and unique, like frostbite tore through the back of my head after lying on blocks of ice.\n\nNylah woke that morning with a content smile, stretching in the sunlight like a satisfied cat. Just as I finished explaining last night, she cut me off with her own explanation, that it was my aches and pains caused the dream. It’s like she knew that I had been considering that exact possibility, and a loud part of my mind was more concerned with it being an invention of my mind than the truth. For hours I sat there, mind circling around the possibilities. I knew how I looked to Nylah. There were a few moments where she entered my eyeline and we spared a few words, but I never left the bed. I didn’t take in her reaction, but I imagined it ranging from annoyance to concern.\n\nMinutes blurred into the next, eventually turning to hours, and before I’d noticed, the sun was well on its way down. As it neared the horizon, warm, orange light reflected through our window. In a dazzling array of refracted light, it painted narrow spotlights against the opposite wall. One stray beam inched towards the ceiling, eventually catching on a small object nestled between the walls and ceiling. Hot, white light then reflected into my eyes, forcing a wince as it knocked me from my ponderings. It was so small, and nearly the same shade as the darkened walls, I’d forgotten it was even there.\n\n*The nest camera,* I realized in a sudden rush of clarity. Like a layer of snow shaken off a buried tree, my mind sharpened. I rolled out of the bed, legs wobbling as they struggled to bear the weight after a day of lethargy and atrophy. But I made it to the dresser, where I’d left my phone last night. It had been months since I used the app. Once I’d confirmed that I didn’t sleep walk, the motion sensing camera facing our bed was largely unused. I’d customized the app to only save any footage from the night before, so I was surprised when several clips were available for my viewing.\n\nThe first few were all of me tossing and turning, rolling onto my back before settling back on my side. However, the first clip to truly earn my attention started at 3:06. Staring at the screen for a few long seconds, confusion started to bubble in the back of my mind. *What am I looking at here?* Something had to have tripped the motion detecting, infrared sensor, yet there was no movement on the screen. The clip played for its minimum of fifteen seconds before jumping ahead.\n\nThe next clip was from 3:12, by my eyes, it seemed that it was another clip of nothing that lasted exactly fifteen seconds.\n\nThen the 3:21 clip started, and I was starting to see a pattern. It looked like the same video had been copied three times over, me on my side asleep next to Nylah. I raised a finger to exit out of the video, only hesitating when I noticed a flicker on the edge of the screen, barely detected by the subpar night vision mode in the slight lighting. It was like a shadow of a figure, or an artifact of the grainy video. It would have been invisible in a still image, but I spotted it when the grainy shadow moved slightly.\n\nThe figure was like a whisp of smoke, billowing from a flame unseen. It stood above the nearby dresser, and was much taller than the bed, the fuzzy image gliding slowly across the floor. It moved incredibly slowly, its pace so relaxed I was surprised that the camera even detected it. It took a few minutes for it to arrive at our beside, every excruciating second building a sickening sense of dread inside me. A glimpse of the shadow shimmered, a movement streaking across the screen, and then it froze.\n\nI couldn’t tell if the image froze, or if the shadowy figure just halted as it had almost seemed to do several times already. Then before I could think to stab the screen in frustration, the clips abruptly skipped ahead.\n\nMy brain struggled to filter what my eyes were showing me. After a day of doubting and wondering, the proof was there. Next to my bed was a figure of milky white skin, its surface seemed smooth, devoid of hair or markings. It was tall and thin, seeming to be completely naked but missing any creases or muscles – it looked closer to a mannequin than a person.\n\nAs I blinked, the video skipped forward once more to where the figure was leaning over the bedside with an impossibly thin arm carrying unnaturally long, and thin digits held out. It was exactly like my dream, *except I suppose this means it wasn’t one.*Frozen at the point where my dream had ended, the thin appendage and fingers were held out hovering over the bed near my head.\n\nThe screen tore again, a ripple of static tearing through the image as it jumped forward. At this section of the clip, its fingers were pressed against the back of my head. I’d stopped shifting and turning, now seeming completely still as the pointers poked my head. From the fingertips glowed a soft yellow light, illuminating strands of hair from the base of my skull. Slowly, the glow turned from yellow to orange, its intensity increasing as the light became more prominent. After a few excruciating seconds of stillness, my breath caught, and I realized I’d been holding it since the video started.\n\nI forced an exhale, and sucked a slow breath in, expecting the video to jump once more. Except this time, the video kept playing, and the orange glow quickly started to darken. As it turned red, the glow softened, its intensity seeming to dull under the new character. *Is this what did it?* I wondered, a hand rubbing against the dull pain that continued to throb in the back of my head. Almost as if to answer, the red light seemed to pop in a sudden flash of strength. With it my body jerked abruptly on the video, back arching as if electricity arced through me. Just as quickly as the spasm had gripped my body, the thing ripped its arm away, taking the red glow with it.\n\nOnce more, the screen buzzed with broken pixels and it skipped to a scene of me lying on my back staring at the wall where the thing approached, confusion stricken across my face as we were alone in the room once more. *It grabbed me…or something.*“What is it?”\n\nMy eyes snapped up from the phone, still wide from the shock of what they saw. Her brow was furrowed, hands on her hips while looking to me a flicker of annoyance on her face. I stared back at her in silence, a few seconds delay before I found my words. “It’s real.”\n\n“Not this again,” she said with an exhausted dismay. “I told you. You slept weird and now your neck hurts, it happens sometimes.”\n\nI swiped frantically at the screen, “no it’s real. Look.” Turning the phone over, she paced across the bed, a skeptical look of concern on her face.\n\n“What am I looking at here?” Then she seemed to actually look at the screen, her eyes narrowing into a lethal expression. *Shit.* I scrunched my features, the face I made when she caught me doing something that would make her mad. Her shoulders immediately tightened; head cocked as she twisted the screen to give her a better view. “What the fuck is this?” she hissed.\n\nTilting the screen down, I reached my hand around her. “Babe, hold on.”\n\nHer hands pushed me away with some force, “don’t fucking ‘babe’ me. Are you kidding me with this?”\n\n“It’s not what it looks like.”\n\n“Really? Because it looks like you have a perv cam pointed at our bed. Are you putting this shit online? Do I have an OnlyFans I should know about?”\n\nWith some space between us, I felt comfortable enough to snort with a smile. She didn’t enjoy that, lunging towards me with a hand raised. But I managed to catch her wrist before the open palm slapped across my face. “No,” I said tersely, “remember when we were concerned about me sleep walking?” She didn’t speak, but I saw the flash of understanding loosen her features. “It’s just there to see if I’m sleep walking, I haven’t used the app in months anyway.”\n\nRipping her hand free, she crossed them across her chest. “Show me what you need to show me.”\n\n“Look,” I said, pointing at the screen. With bated breath I waited while we stared across the screen. The seconds passed with a dreadful slothfulness, but as one melted into the next, we still didn’t see anything. *What?* I wondered, and as my eyes cast to the edge of the screen where the shadow had first appeared – I had my answer. “No,” I whispered. I could feel her gaze shift from the phone to me, a concerned look on her face as I scrolled through the video. It was almost five minutes long, and seemed to be a still frame of us sound asleep. There was no figure, no glowing light, only my past self jolting awake at the end of the video.\n\n“It’s here,” I muttered, swiping across the screen to skip back and forth through the clip.\n\nShe slid off the bed, indifferent of my desperation to prove myself. “I’m leaving.”\n\nI cocked my head to the side, fingers frozen. “What?”\n\nFeet carrying her to the closet, she paused to audibly sniffle, back of her hand wiping at her face. “To my parents. You need help, professional help.”\n\nI felt like my legs were frozen, leaving me unmoving on the bed. “You can’t go.”\n\n“I can’t stay,” abruptly swinging open the closet and pulling out an empty duffel bag that had been stored at the bottom. “I need time to think,” she said, unable to even look my direction while she threw some clothes and underwear into the bag. I should have protested, begged her to stay – do something. But I didn’t. I just sat there, petrified on the bed while watching Nylah pack the bag before walking out the door.\n\nThe house was quiet, quieter than I’d expected. I hadn’t realized how much I would miss the clattering of dishes or noise from whatever she was watching on her phone or the tv. Despite how exhausted I felt, I didn’t once feel hunger or thirst; in fact, I barely moved except to adjust the folding of my crossed legs when they became too numb.\n\nIn my hands I held the black screen of my phone, it had died a few hours ago, drained from my constant replaying of the video. The footage seemed unaltered, yet it refused to show me what I’d seen on that first viewing. With the depleted device in my lap, I stared at the wall, wondering if Nylah was right. I wondered if I’d reached my limit, if something in my brain had finally snapped, unable to be kept operational by the battery of pharmaceuticals and sheer will. I wanted to believe it was real, but knew how little sleep I’d been getting. With a sigh I fell backwards onto the bed. U*nable to sleep, how lame is that?* I thought while flashing a smirk that oozed self-pity. The irony of it was that I almost immediately fell into the unconscious black after barely a minute of staring at the ceiling had preceded the new dream.\n\nOnce more I was in my room, except I’d skipped the preamble of slowly gliding across the room, and the dream began at my bedside. Ahead of me, my sleeping form was on its side, back turned while taking in slow and heavy breaths. Just as it had last time a hand of painted white fingers reached out for the back of my neck.\n\nI couldn’t let it happen again. If I’d conjured everything, and it was all in my head, then I had full control. With that knowledge, I imagined myself standing at the height that my eyes were showing. I commanded my face to wrinkle, ordered fingers to pinch the flesh on my arm – anything that might wake me from the dream. Regardless of my input, the dream continued unperturbed, a narrow hand reaching towards the exposed skin of my neck. I tried to grind my teeth, and even opened my mouth to scream. It was as if my voice had been stolen, it felt as if I’d shouted, but only the quiet ambience of my empty home filled my ears.\n\nMilky fingers a few inches from the base of my skull, I tried to scream again, and found failure again. As I held my mouth open in a desperate protest, a thought flashed into my mind.\n\nI stuck my tongue out and slammed my teeth down on it – hard.\n\nEyes shooting open, I was back in my bed, an arm tucked underneath the pillow and a thin crust of drool hardened at my mouth’s edge. With my free hand, I turned quickly in the bed and reached out. To my surprise, my grip wrapped around the cold wrist of a towering figure. I didn’t let go. My grip instead tightening as the rest of my body flinched in surprise. The thing was taller than I expected, nearly reaching the ceiling even while its neck hunched over and shoulders seemed dropped. Despite its kowtowed posture, the sheer size of it left me grasping for words.\n\nAs I’d seen in the video, it was completely naked, but its body looked more like a marble statue than that of a simply pale human. However, its face was nothing like that of a person. Its oddness demanding my full attention, as I laid in silence, unable to look away. Its head was also hairless, a stretched oblong shape with a crease down the center, running from the top to the bottom of it. Two columns of two jet black eyes dotted the edge of its face. With no discernable pupils, I couldn’t see where it looked, but I felt like its chilling gaze was pointed at me. It had no mouth, made no noise, and stood as still as I was. It seemed equally frozen by my latching onto its wrist, the smooth chest remaining still as if it didn’t need to breathe.\n\nTwisting in the bed, my head snapped to the side. *Nylah.* But she wasn’t there, only an empty fold of the blankets that had been her side of the bed. I cursed silently as my mind slid into a panic.\n\nLooking back to the thing’s face, a single eye blinked open underneath both columns of the two black orbs. The new ones were different from the other four, distinctly larger and seeming more human with a white surface and coloured pupil in the center. Except the pupil was a neon purple, so bright I had to squint my eyes and even considered looking away. The bright purple eye blinked forward a few times then snapped down to focus in on me, the sudden shift sent a chill almost as cold as its wrist racing down my spine.\n\nThen a loud crack reverberated in my ear, like hidden fingers had been snapped. One second, I was in my bed, holding on to the thing’s wrist; the next, it was like I’d fallen over. I came crashing down on the hardwood floor. It was like nothing I’d ever experienced, a buzz of static crackling through my limbs. The fall had been short, but it was so sudden I could feel my chest tightening from being winded slightly, as if I’d been knocked on my back. I still felt the chill of its appendage between my fingers, and once again I tightened my squeeze onto the thing.\n\nIt took a moment to take in my surroundings, and process what happened. Somehow, the thing had moved us from the bedroom to the living room in the blink of an eye. It was like I’d been dropped on the floor, winded slightly and in the same posture I’d been in my bed. Now pulled closer to the floor, the thing bent over slightly, still staring at me while I held onto its wrist. “Help,” I croaked to no one in particular, suddenly aware of how dry my mouth was and how few words I’d spoken before collapsing into bed.\n\nAlong the crease, the upper half of its head split open. The two flaps of milky flesh peeled itself to the side, it seemed to have no further use for the black orbs that I’d thought were eyes. The mouth that had opened where a forehead would be was a gaping maw of blackness, its interior lined by pinkish flesh that glistened with moisture. My stomach churned at the sight of it but couldn’t look away. I twisted my head while watching the thing from the corner of my vision. “Help!” I shouted with everything I had. This time, I felt the sound echo in my throat as my voice filled the quiet home.\n\nIn response, the thing leaned forward. The abrupt closeness of its face and the cavernous hole, made me flinch. Head turning further, I tried to sink into the floor, a desperate attempt to put distance between its face and mine. *Distance.* Realizing that I still gripped its wrist, I quickly let go of the hand and rolled onto my stomach.\n\nWith both hands free, I started to crawl across the warm wooden floors.\n\nBut the thing had other plans. I barely made it a meter when a cold hand gripped my ankle, its frigid digits sending chills through the pant leg of my sweats and up the limb. Immediately, I tried to kick it free with a shout of exertion, but its hold was like a vice grip. Its fingers clamped on my leg in a squeeze, the instant pressure sent bolts of pain racing up my leg. My mouth opened to scream, but I was robbed of the chance as an unreal strength pulled me downward across the hardwood floor.\n\nSomething in my leg popped, and I took the opportunity to howl in pain at the floor. It must not have liked the sound because another hand grabbed a fistful of the back of my shirt and twisted. The fabric pulled, threads and stitching audibly tearing from the stress it failed to withstand as it spun me around.\n\nOn my back, I felt a jarring whiplash, like my brain had been rattled. Despite the pain racing throughout my body, I laid in a stunned silence for a few moments, eyes cast upward to the figure staring down at me.\n\nFrom the murky blackness that had been the opening of its face, something white appeared. Operating on an instinctual level, I thought I could no longer be shocked. I’d given up trying to discern reason from the horrors unfolding. All I could think of was getting away. Yet the thing that looked down on me, locked up my limbs and widened my eyes. From its mouth two pale hands sprouted, their palms were facing me while conjoined at the wrist, ten bleached fingers fanning out in a crescent. The conjoined hands hovered for a moment, just long enough for me to take in the sight, then snapped forward like a striking viper.\n\nThe open palms pressed against my mouth, cold as ice while its longer fingers secured its hold on my face. Before I could react to the coldness of the smooth hands covering my mouth, they grew warm. The sensation was instant, and panic gripped my mind. I tossed and turned, but its hold on my face was strong, my neck quickly protested with its own stabbing pain as the frantic flailing proved useless. Instead, I swung balled fists at the thing. I couldn’t generate much force from my back, but each time it felt like I was punching a steak, subtle slabs of muscle and sinew covered its torso. Finding failure at the body, I tried for the face, but the arms attached to its torso were still free, and ice-cold hands grabbed onto my wrists before slamming them into the floor.\n\nHeld down and trapped, I was only left with a pitiful struggle. I attempted to wiggle a few times, but halted when the hands that had been pressing warmth against my mouth retracted. It still held me down, but with my face released from its grip, a part of me relaxed slightly. I felt fine, I wasn’t in pain as I’d expected, my lips feeling a pleasant warmth as they were pursed tightly.\n\nThen it released my hands, rising slightly to return some distance between us. The conjoined hands continued to retreat, slinking up into the mouth until disappearing completely. The cavernous maw was still held open, but I felt a strange ease with the oblong face. It took a few moments, but my senses eventually did return to me. *Run. Get help.* Pulling in deep drags of air, I blinked in confusion. My heart was racing and I’d been panting heavily, but my lips refused to open.\n\nRagged breaths filled my nostrils, each one shorter than the last. Slowly raising fingers to my face, I touched my mouth – or where my mouth had been. Instead of lips I found smooth skin.\n\n*No.* “Help!” I wailed, the muffled sound rang in my ears. With nowhere for the noise to go, it banged around inside my head, vibrating my vision and sending the painful buds of a migraine into my head. I didn’t care how much it hurt, I screamed again.\n\nWhen my vision steadied once more, it felt like an hour of screaming had passed. Though, I’m sure it was closer to a minute. My head ached with the pangs of a fully matured migraine, my exhaustion also brought a profound resignation to my mind and body. Still the figure stood there, leaning over me.\n\nDistracted from my wallowing and despair, my eyes flicked to the conjoined hands shooting out from the opening in its face. My body jerked with a new wave of panic, but I was too late. The hands snapped forward, and my head flinched as they came shooting towards me. The cold hands this time firmly placed over my eyes, the balls of the palms pressing into my sockets as the long fingers wrapped around the sides and back of my head.\n\nThe warmth was fast, pouring from the hands onto my face. *NO.* I knew I was too tired, and it was too strong to fight – still, I threw my shoulders and twisted my body to try and wriggle free. A second later I felt the pressure release from my eyes and everything was black. Shaky breaths came in and out of my nose, deprived of the two senses that could enable my escape, an undeniable dread finally settled in my mind. If there was a faint fool’s hope before, it was now gone. *It’s over.*\n\nNext, the hand grabbed my leg. The loud snap rang in my ears and I was falling once more. For only a few milliseconds I was in the air and landing softly on a thick bed of snow. Cold air raced over my body, the howling wind singing in my ear. Just as I’d lost it, a flutter of hope entered my mind as I realized where I was, it had taken me outside. It was the middle of the night in the suburbs, but I’d thought I could maybe flag someone down.\n\nAs quickly as the hope had come, it dissipated when a loud buzzing came down from above. I wondered what the sound was, and quickly received an answer as weightlessness gripped my body. It felt as if I was falling, as if gravity no longer existed. But I knew this couldn’t be true. I felt air rushing past me, and despite my lack of vision I knew the truth. *I’m going up*. The sensation didn’t last long, maybe half a minute of me floating, cut abruptly short with the thundering boom of metal on metal, like a gate had just been shut.\n\nLike the instances where I was thrown from my bed to the living room, then to the street, I dropped on the floor. There was no snap, but I knew I had been taken somewhere else. The surface was smooth and warm, a familiar sleekness to it that I could only assume was polished metal. I sat up, instinctively turning my head left and right – despite my blindness to everything around me. I tried to listen for clues but there was nothing, no quiet buzzing of electricity or hissing of gas travelling through pipes.\n\nI should have been terrified, but I felt no longer capable of that emotion, like the corresponding chemical responsible for it was tapped out from over usage. *Which probably isn’t not far off from the truth.*\n\nBetween breaths, I listened for anything, and wondered if I was alone. After what felt like a minute, I thought it must have been the case. But then a wide hand pressed against the side of my head. I flinched, a quiet moan of surprise echoing inside me. Just as I recovered from the stunned surprise, I realized what was happening.\n\nAnother set of hands clamped over my other ear. “No!” I howled. I didn’t care about the migraine that leaped to the forefront of my senses. Hands shooting up, I grabbed on to the cold wrists. I pulled with everything I had, twisting, and yanking at the frigid appendages.\n\n“NO!”\n\nI kept pulling.\n\nA gentle warmth tickled at my ear.\n\n“STOP!”\n\nIt kept going.\n\n“Please.”\n\nMy mind knew what I said next, I felt the vibrations and the corresponding pain in my head.\n\nYet, I only heard silence.\n\n*I don’t know how long it’s been. I don’t know where I am. I don’t know who I am.*\n\n*I don’t know why they gave me this pen and paper. But it is all I have. I’m scared to finish this because they’re sure to take it aw–*\n\n**Specimen 3ⱹ86ⱷ - End of Encounter Report**",

        "text": "  \n\nI looked out the window as the sun set over an endless sea of clouds floating below, looking every bit like I was sailing on my way to Heaven. But inside the plane was a different story.\n\nI was sitting in Premium Economy class. Translation, the cattle car with around an inch of extra legroom.\n\nAs I glanced longingly up the aisle toward the first class section, a man who looked like he weighed easily 350 if not 400 pounds plopped into the seat beside me. I say plopped, but it was more of a struggle than that. It was like watching trying to shove a beach ball into a balloon.\n\nWhen he finally squeezed his way into the seat, he looked at me and smiled sheepishly. I’m sure he was embarrassed just as I was sure that I would regret having the window seat when the horrible time came that I had to go to the bathroom. \n\nI thought they had a weight limit for passengers. I suppose when you buy cheap seats you get what you pay for. I tried to get the company to spring for first class, but they wouldn’t hear of it. Premium economy was as high as they would go. \n\nI guess I see where their top salesman ranks.\n\nOk, maybe not the top salesman, but I do sell some.\n\nAnyway, I tried to settle in beside my new best buddy whom in my mind I affectionately labeled, ‘The Blimp’. \n\nThis was going to be the longest nine-hour flight of my life.\n\nI spent the first hour trying in vain to get some work done on my laptop. That was when my bladder betrayed me. I tried to ignore it and keep working for another half hour, but then it was time. I got an emergency notice from down below, ‘go to the bathroom or go in your pants.’\n\nI surrendered and began the long process of trying to wake the blimp. \n\nI nudged him, then pushed him, then pinched him. \n\nFinally, he roused from his slumber like a sleeping dragon.\n\n“Are we there already?” he said, yawning.\n\n“No, sorry, I have to use the restroom,” I said.\n\nHe looked at me as if I had just asked him to skip the next several meals.\n\n“Can’t ya hold it?” he said.\n\nMy mind ran through an entire list of expletives and derogatory remarks that I would’ve loved to answer with, but in the end, I went with the one most likely not to get me eaten when I eventually tried to sleep.\n\n“No, I can’t hold it for another seven-plus hours,” I said, my voice dripping with sarcasm.\n\nHe grunted and began the long extrication process, as my bladder screamed for mercy. Finally, he stood and stepped into the aisle, knocking the hat off the person sitting in front of us.\n\n“Watch it, bud!” the man said.\n\nThe blimp stepped aside and pointed at me as I tried to get around him to rush back toward the restrooms.\n\nBoth doors said, ‘Occupied’.\n\nI tried the first door just to be sure.\n\n“Someone’s in here,” a woman’s voice singsonged.\n\nI tried the second one.\n\n“Can’t you read?” came an irritated voice from inside the room. “It’s occupied!”\n\nI stood there and endured the pain of an overfull bladder, having no other choice. I looked around to see if there was a garbage can with an empty soda bottle. But there wasn’t. \n\nJust when I was sure my bladder was about to explode, I heard the latch open and a large man stepped out of the bathroom.\n\nHe glared at me.\n\n“You gotta problem with lettin’ people use the john in peace?”\n\n“Nope,” I said as I dodged past him and into the bathroom.\n\nI whipped around and latched the door.\n\n“Hey!” the man said from the other side. “I wasn’t done talkin’ ta ya.”\n\nI ignored him as he pounded on the door. \n\nI was too busy relieving myself to pay attention, until I heard, “I’ll be waitin’ out here fer ya.”\n\n‘Great,’ I thought. ‘Now some big, good ole boy wants to kick my butt.’\n\nI finished and was about to flush when I paused instead. \n\n‘Maybe I can wait him out.’\n\nI put the seat down and sat.\n\nAfter a while, I looked at my watch and it had been ten minutes. Surely, he would be gone by now. I reached for the latch when I heard the other door open. \n\n“Excuse me, ma’am,” I heard him say as the woman in the other bathroom walked by. \n\nHe was waiting. And I was sure it wasn’t to say that he understood my urgency and wanted to apologize for taking so long.\n\nI sat back down and contemplated my options. \n\nA) Sit here for the rest of the flight.\n\nB) Go out and get my butt kicked.\n\nI didn’t like either option.\n\nThe plane suddenly rocked so hard I was thrown against the wall. I saw stars. It took me a minute to recover and stand to go see what had happened when I was thrown against the wall again. This time I nearly lost consciousness. \n\nI cautiously reached for the door handle when the third time was the charm.\n\nI hit the wall and the lights went out.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI woke to cold water slapping me in the face. \n\nI thought I had fallen asleep and a stewardess was waking me up.\n\nThe reality was so much worse.\n\nThere was water in the room. I’m not talking about a puddle on the floor. I’m talking about water halfway to the ceiling. I had my own pool for the first time in my life. \n\nInstant panic set in. \n\nHad a water pipe burst? \n\nHad I bumped the sink before I went unconscious and flooded the room?\n\nI didn’t want to be responsible for the carpet cleaning cost. I reached for the door and tried to open it, but it was stuck. \n\nWas the big guy leaning against it, trying to teach me a lesson about being impatient?\n\nI pushed again and it gave a little. \n\nI planted my feet against the toilet and shoved with all my might. Finally, the door came open. \n\nMy worst nightmare couldn’t be as bad as what I saw.\n\nThere was water everywhere. The seats were covered and there was only a few feet of open air from the top of the seats to the ceiling of the plane. \n\nI saw heads bobbing above the water. I sloshed through and saw people still in their seatbelts unconscious. I unfastened those closest to me and saw they had life preservers around their necks. I looked around for one for myself. \n\nI glanced over and there was the blimp, still fastened into his seat, not moving. I shook him, but he didn’t respond. I unfastened his seatbelt, but he was wedged in and couldn’t get float out. I struggled to release him but realized he hadn’t moved the entire time. I checked for a pulse, but he was gone. \n\nI pulled the life preserver over his head and put it on my own. \n\nI looked up the aisle and saw many more heads bobbing. I also saw the water had risen. Panic gripped me and told me I was about to drown. \n\nI started swimming my way toward the front, hoping to find the emergency exit. On the way, I unlatched as many seatbelts as I could. All the passengers looked like they were unconscious, but just in case. \n\nI made it to the emergency door and tried to open it. \n\nIt was harder to open than the bathroom door. I pushed with all my might and it barely budged. I wished I had the big angry guy with me right about now, but I was the only one I’d seen moving. \n\nA few of the passengers I’d released floated toward me, but their eyes remained closed. \n\nFor what seemed like hours, I struggled to open the emergency door to no avail. I paused to take a breather when I heard a horrible sound. It was like a screeching, and stretching of something inhuman. Like a monster in its death throes. \n\nI looked around, trying to find the source of this horrible sound when I noticed the ceiling had begun to split apart above me. \n\nThe screeching sound got louder as the water level rose. The front and back of the plane seemed to be taking on more water and I was standing right in the middle. \n\nThe water level rose as the crack grew and my feet no longer touched the floor. The water had risen so high that my life preserver was floating me up toward the ceiling. The problem was, the ceiling was full of jagged edges waiting to rip me to shreds. \n\nI rose, unable to stay down, going straight toward the sharp metal and plastic. \n\nSuddenly, the plane ripped in two, pulling the edges of the two sides away from me and shooting me up to the surface of the water, while the plane was dragged toward the bottom of the ocean.\n\nI bobbed up and down on the ocean waves made worse by the displacement of water from a huge passenger plane. I looked around but it was dark, and all I could see were stars and a thumbnail moon. \n\nI swished the water with my hand, moving in a circle, but couldn’t see anything. The sea was pitch black with only a shimmer of moonlight reflecting off it.\n\nI focused on the shimmer, hoping to see something. A boat, a buoy, anything that might be in the water that could rescue me. \n\nAfter a while, I was about to give up when I saw something pass through the shimmer. It wasn’t there for long, and it wasn’t very far from me. I started swimming toward it when a terrible thought struck me. What if it was a shark?\n\nI stopped swimming and stayed as still as possible. \n\nMy blood froze even though the water wasn’t that cold. \n\nI had no idea where I was, or where anyone else was, and I had no desire to become a snack. \n\nAs these thoughts raced through my mind making me want to jump out of the water and run toward land, cartoon style, I felt something touch my leg. My body involuntarily made use of the endless bathroom I was floating in.\n\nI didn’t move. I used every ounce of determination, fueled by sheer terror, to stay as still as possible. \n\nI waited for an eternity. \n\nNothing happened. \n\nJust as I was about to breathe a sigh of relief, something touched me again. \n\nIt was toying with me. Tenderizing me. Waiting for me to lose it and start thrashing around so it could enjoy its meal. \n\nIt bumped me again, this time on my head.\n\n‘Wait a minute,’ I thought. ‘Sharks don’t jump out of the water to get what’s already in their reach.’\n\nI took a deep breath and turned around to see what had been touching me.\n\nIt was a fellow passenger floating in their life preserver. In fact, it was the man who had been in the bathroom.\n\nI breathed a sigh of relief.\n\n“So you made it too?” I said.\n\nThe man stared at me silently.\n\n“You’re not still mad at me for that silly bathroom thing, are you?” I said.\n\nHe refused to speak. \n\n“Let it go, man,” I said. “Be happy we made it through this.”\n\nHis eyes penetrated mine.\n\n“Fine, be mad if you want.”\n\nThen he turned his eyes away from me and stared off into the distance.\n\n“What?” I said. “What do you see? What’s out there?”\n\nI turned and scanned the horizon to see what it was he had spotted. As hard as I looked, I didn’t see a thing. \n\n“What did you… ?” I trailed off. \n\nHe was gone. I was once again alone in a sea of darkness.\n\nI questioned if I he had ever been there at all. \n\nWhat was happening to me? Was I losing my mind?\n\nAs I questioned my sanity, I heard something off in the distance. \n\nI listened for a long time before I heard it again. \n\nIt was a whistle. Not like someone whistling a tune, but a plastic whistle someone would use to call for help. \n\nThis stirred a memory. I looked down at my life preserver and sure enough, there was a plastic whistle attached to it. I pulled it free and began blowing it in answer.\n\nAfter several loud blasts, I waited. There was a whistle in answer. \n\nI began swimming toward where I had heard the sound. After a few minutes, I stopped to rest and blew my whistle again. When the return whistle came, I was surprised to find the sound didn’t come from in front of me, but off to my right.\n\nI must’ve gotten turned around somehow. I started swimming in the direction of the sound and stopped to blow my whistle. \n\nOnce again the answering whistle didn’t come from in front of me but off to the left, almost behind me.\n\n‘Am I swimming too hard and going right past them?’\n\nI decided to stay still for a few minutes and then blow my whistle. \n\nWhen the answer came, it was in a completely different spot. I tried to test my theory that it wasn’t me that was moving. I stared in the direction of the last whistle and waited for a minute. When the answering call came this time, it was behind me.\n\nThe stranger thing was, it seemed like no matter what I did, the whistle never got any closer or farther away.\n\nI was getting creeped out. I stopped whistling. After a while, I heard the whistle again, this time from in front of me. I refused to move or answer. After a while, I heard it again, still in front of me.\n\nThere was no doubt in my mind. Someone was playing games. My first and most obvious guess was the guy from the bathroom. He seemed like the kind to play mind games on someone. \n\nBut would he go further? As far as I knew we were in the ocean alone. I had no idea how many had made it out of the plane, but I was sure the guy wouldn’t be able to convince them all to play along with his stupid little game when they were fearing for their lives.\n\nThe darkness began to fade as the first vestiges of light fought against it, turning the sky steel grey. The light brought me hope and would also bring me answers. This guy could hide and play games in the dark, but the light would reveal his deception.\n\nAs the grey sky turned lighter and gave way to orange, then bright yellow, I saw dots all around on the surface of the water. \n\nI swam toward one and found it was another passenger.\n\n“Glad to see you made it,” I said. “I was indisposed at the time, any idea what happened?”\n\nThe woman looked back at me with empty eyes.\n\n“Hello?” I said, waving my hand in front of her face and snapping my fingers.\n\nShe didn’t respond. \n\nI reached over and felt her neck for a pulse, waiting to be slapped for being so forward. But the only slap I received was reality. She had no pulse. She was dead.\n\nI felt helpless. I wanted to say something, to do something. But there was nothing to be done. The woman slowly floated away from me.\n\nI looked around and saw several others bobbing on the water. There were at least a dozen.\n\n“Hello?” I called out. “Is anyone else alive?”\n\nMy eyes searched the faces one by one looking for any sign of a response, but I found none.\n\nHopelessness turned to determination.\n\nThis was something I could do. I could check these people to see if they were sleeping or…\n\nI swam to the closest one and checked for a pulse. \n\nNothing.\n\nI swam to the next and the next, and again nothing. When I got done checking those I had seen first, a few more popped up a little further away that I must’ve missed. I checked them all. Until I was done I had discovered thirty-two people who had managed to get out of their seatbelts, only to perish some other way. The strange thing was I didn’t notice any obvious injuries.\n\nThere were no head wounds that I saw and no cloud of blood circling any of them. It was like they just gave up. \n\nI checked the last body and to my astonishment, it was the man from the bathroom. The same one who had bumped into me last night. Had he been alive then? I thought so. But the more I replayed our encounter, the less I believed he had been alive. More than likely he just happened to bump into me as his dead body floated in the water.\n\nAs I was pondering this, I saw another body. I swam over to check it then stopped cold. I recognized this guy. It was someone I had checked already. But that was impossible. I had checked him over a dozen bodies ago. Had I gone in a circle?  \n\nEverywhere I looked there was nothing but water. With no frame of reference, and no land, I could’ve gotten turned around. And then I looked up. The sun was high in the sky. Once it started going down, I would have the ultimate reference. I couldn’t possibly lose the sun.\n\nThen I saw dark clouds on the horizon, reminding me how wrong I was.\n\nI hoped and wished and prayed for them to turn and go in another direction. But they didn’t. Slowly, they approached like a blanket of doom.\n\nAs I watched the approaching clouds, one of the people near me suddenly disappeared under the water.\n\nMy eyes grew wide at this apparition. They didn’t slip out of their life preserver, it would’ve stayed on the surface. I was fairly sure it wasn’t my imagination, but after the last few hours, I wasn’t one hundred percent sure of anything.\n\nI had to entertain the idea that I might be slipping into madness. I couldn’t remember the last time I had eaten or drank anything. And I was sure that I had swallowed minuscule amounts of seawater since the crash. \n\nCome to think of it, I had been feeling lethargic. I’m pretty sure that’s one of the signs of seawater poisoning. Or it could be the fact that I hadn’t slept in who knows how long.\n\nAs these thoughts rolled through my mind, the passenger popped back up. He looked the same, but his head was tilting to the side a little. I wondered if I was just imagining it when I saw the water around him was tinged with red.\n\nIt reminded me of that scene in Jaws when the sheriff sees the first shark attack with his own eyes and the camera zoomed in on his shocked and horrified face. That’s how I felt at that moment. Only I wasn’t watching a movie. The danger was real and it was swimming right beside me.\n\nI looked around and spotted the first fin cruising ominously along the water among the bodies. It went under the water and soon another passenger dipped out of sight. She returned a few minutes later, also with her head listing on its side and a red tinge to the water surrounding her.\n\nThe shark must’ve eaten part or most of their legs, disturbing the balance of the body that held them straight up. \n\nPanic consumed me. I tried to stay as still as possible, knowing that sharks are attracted to movement. Every fact from every Shark Week I had ever watched rushed through my head.\n\nI turned as slowly as panic would allow, trying to keep track of the shark, when I caught sight of another fin and another. With blood in the water, there was no doubt it would become a feeding frenzy.\n\nAs I wallowed in desperation, when I heard the whistle again, off in the distance. This time it was no long mournful note, it was sharp, panicked blasts.\n\nI started swimming towards the whistle, slowly, trying not to make too much splash. The benefit was I was swimming away from where the sharks were feeding. I started to feel relieved when I heard another salvo of whistles. It struck me how they seemed to convey a sense of alarm, even bordering on hysteria.\n\nWas I going from proverbial frying pan to fire?\n\nWas the mysterious whistler being attacked by sharks too?\n\nOr even worse, was there even anyone whistling?\n\nI had tried to get close to the whistles earlier but couldn’t, no matter how hard I tried. Was this some trick? Was there some creature luring me to some horrible doom?\n\nI’d heard stories of sirens leading men to their deaths. I wasn’t sure if I believed such fairy tales or not. Although the longer I attempted to track down the mysterious whistle, the more my mind opened up to supernatural possibilities.\n\nIt was almost a moot point. I was so tired. My arms felt like they were encased in concrete. Rescue seemed more unlikely by the moment. \n\nI stopped swimming because I desperately needed a break. I turned to look back at the swarm of fins amongst the red water and shreds of life preservers. I hoped I was far enough away from the carnage to escape notice.\n\nI turned back to the shock of my life. Off in the distance, I could see something big. Was it an island? My mind screamed with joy. But then reality set in. How would I reach something so far away? My hopes came crashing down. \n\nI closed my eyes in despair. Hopelessness threatened to drown me long before the water could. When I opened my eyes I knew I was dreaming. The island had somehow gotten closer. \n\nI rubbed my eyes to make sure I wasn’t seeing things. When I opened them, sure enough, the island was even closer. \n\nThis was it. I had lost my mind. I was delusional, hearing and seeing things that weren’t there. I knew then I was close to death.\n\nThe island continued to grow larger, coming straight at me. \n\nI finally realized the island was a ship. I was saved. \n\nThe ship continued to grow as it steamed straight toward me. \n\nI saw for the first time, it was an oil tanker and it was about to kill me.\n\nMy savior would be my doom.\n\nI resigned myself to the fact that I would survive a plane crash, be tormented by ghostly whistling, avoid being eaten by sharks, only to be run over by a ship that could save me.\n\nAs a tear rolled down my cheek, I was deafened by a loud blast. The horns on the ship blew and I saw it begin to turn away from me. \n\nEven better, instead of dying, the ship would turn away from me without even knowing how close it was to rescuing me.\n\nAs depression set in I noticed the ship was slowing as it turned. Just before it got to me, it stopped. The waves slammed into me threatening to pull me under. I waited and stared up at the massive side of the ship looking like it was as tall as a skyscraper. \n\nWithin minutes I heard the whine of a smaller boat’s engine. \n\nA man pulled up beside me in a boat. \n\n“Are you alright?” he said.\n\nI was so shocked and overjoyed, I couldn’t speak.\n\nHe grabbed me and helped me into the boat. \n\n“Hey, are you ok?” he said looking into my eyes.\n\n“Yeah,” I managed to whisper, surprised at the raspiness of my voice.\n\n“Is there anyone else here?” he said.\n\nIt took me a moment to think.\n\n“I was following a whistle.”\n\nHe looked around, then started the boat off in another direction. Before I knew it, he stopped and pulled someone else out of the water. It was a woman I didn’t recognize. He sat her at the far end of the boat.\n\n“Are you ok?” he asked her.\n\nShe looked at him with empty eyes but didn’t answer.\n\nI could empathize with her. The shock of the last twenty-four hours must’ve rendered her mute. I saw the whistle in her hand and knew she was the one I had been chasing.\n\n“Did you see anyone else?” he asked her.\n\nShe didn’t look at him and said nothing.\n\nHe hung his head and turned the boat to head back to the ship. When we got there, he hooked the boat onto wires that hung down and shouted up to the deck. The boat started rising. I knew I was finally safe.\n\nThe woman looked up for the first time. She looked at the man who had rescued us and grinned. \n\nThere was something wrong with her grin. It was too big. There was no way her mouth could be human. Her teeth grew impossibly long and pointy, and her face turned green. Her clothes melted away into the form of some lizard/fish-looking creature. She dove at the man and sank her teeth into his neck. He screamed as she viciously attacked, ripping and tearing at his face, arms, and chest. \n\nIt wasn’t long until he was nothing but a bloody lump of flesh. She turned to me and dove. \n\nWatching him being torn apart had given me a moment to acknowledge what had happened. I focused all my energy on one desperate plan. As she dove toward me, I kicked with all I had. My foot impacted her in the face and changed her direction. Instead of diving at me, the kick turned her and she sailed over the edge of the rising boat. \n\nI listened to the inhuman shriek as it fell all the way down to the water. \n\nI laid back in the boat, exhausted, mentally and physically. \n\nI opened my eyes when I felt the boat lurch to a stop. The crewmen looked into the boat and recoiled as they saw the remains of their crewmate laying next to me.\n\nThey backed away and called for the captain. Once he arrived and surveyed the scene, he ordered me taken to a room and cleaned up, and the remains to be removed. \n\nIt was sometime later, after I had slept, that there came a knock on the door. The captain came in and sat down beside my bed.\n\n“Have you gotten some rest?” he said.\n\n“Yes, thank you,” I said. “And thank you for rescuing me.”\n\n“Unfortunately, you can no longer thank the person responsible for your rescue.”\n\n“I don’t understand.”\n\n“The man who came down in the boat is the one who spotted you in the water and called for the ship to stop.”\n\n“Oh.”\n\n“Would you like to tell me what happened?”\n\nI sighed deeply.\n\n“Where would you like me to start?”\n\n“The beginning is a good place.”",

        "text": "For my fortieth birthday, I planned a writers retreat at a cabin in the wilderness.  \nIt was one of those crazy expensive prepaid resorts, fancy in the sense it was extremely over priced (think 5k for 3 people, for 3 nights!) as well as in the fact that you had no mentors or such there, it was just you, whoever your guests were, and nature, set to inspire and ignite our writing.  \n\\-  \nI paid for it all on my shiny credit card, ignoring the mounting pile of bills that had accumulated on my bench top.  \nAs I emailed the booking details to the girls, I began to research the surrounding woodlands. Dense. Vast. They were perfect.   \n\\-  \nThey were so excited, at the start.   \nLots of ohhs and ahhs over the cabin, how pretty it was, how Secluded.  \nSlowly, a week or so before the day we were supposed to leave, they both pulled out.  \nMargie complained of a sick child she could bare to leave behind, and Jenelle made up something about being swamped with mid year exams.  \nI was sincere where I told them it was fine, that I understood, and I wasn't upset.   \nThey gaffed and gawed, stumbling over apologies but inside, i was pleased.  \nIt would be easier, without them there.  \nIt would be less guilt to bear, even if it was only for a short amount of time.   \n\\-  \nI was planning to kill myself, or for my friends and insurances sake, to 'get lost in the woods' on a hike over the course of our three day getaway.  \nIt wasn't an easy decision, but I'd made my mind up over a long time.  \nMy husband had been killed in a farming accident a few years ago, and I realised just how lonely life on my own was.   \nI tried to stay busy, I tried to stay connected.  \nMy life seemed to end, with his.   \n\\-  \nAs with all aspects of my life, my hobbies, my social life, my writing career had dwindled downward as well, and now it was barely a ghost of what it had once been.   \nI was lucky to get something written down, let alone published in one of the trashy gossip magazines these days.   \nAnd the thought of actually publishing the novel I'd spent so many years writing, that was now nothing but a far away dream, something soft and sweet, but not tangible in the slightest.   \n\\-  \nI left early for the cabin, making sure my own home was clean and tidy for whichever friend, or police officer, had the unfortunate duty of eventually clearing out my belongings.   \nI'd made it easy enough to find everything, all my important documents were stored neatly in my office, I'd made it organised without making it obvious what my intentions were.   \nI packed normally, taking enough clothes for the three days, knowing I would only need 1 lot, but not wanting to attract any questions from the officers who would be reviewing my missing persons case.   \nI'd watched, and written, about enough true crime over the years to know what was going to be considered troublesome.   \nI wanted to play it safe, in all aspects.   \n\\-  \nThe cabin was pretty, a glorious little spot truly nestled in the heart of a massive outback.   \nThe silence was unsettling to begin with, but I soon welcomed the change from buzzing city life.   \nFor the first time in months, maybe years, I felt my shoulders sag, I felt my pulse slow.   \nAfter I took my bags inside and set up my type writer at the wooden desk overlooking the window, I made myself a bourbon and coke, settling into the desk and hovering my hands above the type writer.  \nAfter a moment, I laughed.   \nI laughed and I couldn't stop, not for what felt like an age.  \nAnd once I did finally manage to stop laughing, the tears came.  \nBig, ugly, breathless gulps. Hot tears streaming down my reddening face.  \nI'd given it a moment, I'd given it all my hope, hovering my hand over the stupid damn typewriter and nothing happened.  \nBecause, of course it didn't.  \nI hadn't been able to write properly for so long, and in that moment, I knew I never would again.  \nI took myself to the deck out side, and as I sat in the cool night air, the tears on my face dried, slowly my breath became unchoked, and I found peace with my decision again.  \n\\-  \nI left the cabin just before the sun rose.  \nI'd been up for hours, at that point.  \nDressed, cafffinated.   \nMy hands were jittery as I zipped up my brand new hiking boots (thank you, credit card).  \nI closed the cabin door softly behind me, but I was still started by the sound it made clicking locked in the silence all around me.  \nMy boots crunched against the dry grass, and I focused on that sound as I put one foot infront of the other.  \nI had a ways to go.  \n\\-  \nThe heat was making me delirious.  \nI had no idea how far I'd walked, what time it was.  \nI found shade in places I could, but before long it was gone, and I was off searching for its reprive once more.  \nI could hear a creek running, but no matter how close I thought I got to it, I could never find it.  \nI suspected it was my mind playing tricks, like a mirage.   \nI was so thirsty. But there was nothing to drink.  \nI layed for a while, partially under the shade, the parts where I wasn't covered felt warm and sticky and wrong.  \nBut I couldn't think about that.  \nI was focusing on the sound of footsteps.   \nThe sound of boots on the ground, twigs and sticks cracking as they were stepped on.  \nI wanted to call out, to say 'I'm here'. But my voice was raspy and dry, try as I might, no sound would come out.  \nI didn't need to speak, because the man found me.  \nOne minute I was squinting into the trees, the next he was next to me, Grey eyes peering down at me, over thick framed glasses.  \n\"Kate Patrick?\"   \nIt didn't make sense that this Stanger could know my name. Unless.. He was a plain clothed police officer? A part of a search party rescue?   \nI nodded meekly, wondering how long I'd been out here, feeling the immense gratefulness of my suicide plan having failed.   \nThe man was still stating at me, and I realised he must of been waiting for my confirmation of who I was.   \nI nodded at him, indicating with my hands I couldn't speak.   \nThis seemed to appease him, and he nodded back as if he'd known who I was all along.   \nI waited for him to pull a radio, or cell phone, from his pocket to alert others that he had found me, but he didn't.   \n\\-  \nI was so thirsty.  \nHe hadn't offered me a drink, hadn't done anything apart from stare at me.  \nHe looked confused, and he looked pensive, which didn't make much sense, considering he was the one who had found me.  \nI felt worried but, apart from the very obvious reasons, I couldn't put my finger on why.  \n\"I.. I've never done this before.\" the man sounded nervous, his voice quivered as he spoke, as if he might cry at any moment. \"I'm here to make you an offer.\"  \nI stared up at him, my eyebrows knitting into an unsure frown.   \nMake me an offer? He wasn't making sense.  \n\"You're on your way to being dead, not really that long to go. You're dehydrated. You think you've found some shade, but you haven't. Your mind is trying to appease your current situation, but it can't change reality for you.   \nThat's where I step in.\"  \nHe paced back and forth excitedly, his voice growing louder, more confident with each sentance he spoke.   \n\"You have something that we want. You're a good writer, a talented writer.\"  \nalthough I was silent, it was as if he could read my mind, hear the scoff I'd made in my own head   \n\"You think you aren't. You think you're a joke, worthless. That everything good inside died when the man you loved died? Hmm? Well you're wrong. And like I said, I'm here to make you an offer. Life or death. It's up to you what you do from here.\"   \n\\-  \nI didn't want to die, that I knew.   \nGoing back to my old life felt hollow, but it was all I had known.   \nAnd if this man was right.. And I did have actual talent.. Well maybe my writing would come back and I'd be okay.   \nI met the man's gaze and nodded, I'd accept his offer.   \nWhatever it meant, whatever it entailed, if I had to sell my soul, well, it would be better than death.   \nThe man's eyes lit up and he smiled genuinely for the first time since we had met.  \n\"You won't regret it.\" he beamed, and then he was gone, as everything else slowly started to dissipate around me.  \n\\-  \nThe table creeks, if I lean forward.  \nMy hands have blistered, and blistered over again, but I never stop writing.  \nNot even when it hurts.  \nNot even when so much blood covers the paper, that I have to start the pages all over again.  \nI tried to get away once, and I made it really far.  \nI made it to my old house, but there was another woman in there. Another woman cooking dinner for a man, she was smiling and happy as she stirred pans and boiled pots.  \nI asked her where all my stuff was, demanding she give me my things, but she screamed she had no idea who I was, or what I was talking about.  \nShe claimed she had lived at that house, my house, for years.  \nI found an internet Cafe, and I tried to log onto my emails.   \nIt said I had no account registered.  \n\\-  \nI then called by Janelle's school, but she looked quite concerned and offered to call me an ambulance after she told me she didn't know who I was, when I had explained about our decade long friendship.   \nShe had no idea about a 40th or any writing retreat.   \nAnd when I made my way by Margie's, she was nursing her daughter, my niece, who she bounced on her hips as she stared at me with a frown.   \n\"Look, I'm sorry about what you've been through that sounds.. Insane.., but I haven't seen you before in my life. I hope you can find your friends, and get the help you need.\" she shut the door in my face without a goodbye.  \nI couldn't blame her, but it still hurt.   \nI went back, and I kept writing for them, because I realised I had no where else to go.   \n\\-  \nBut lately I can't cope with it anymore.  \nThe sound of the keyboard sends shivers down my spine.   \nI want to change this deal, even if that means certain death. I don't know how to get the man to come back, so I can ask him.   \n\\-  \nMy fingers are worn to the bone.   \nThe constant click of the keyboard letters being jabbed makes me wince with physical pain.   \nIronically, I can't stop my own hands from flying across the keys, but in this moment, I don't want to.   \nI know reddit is going to be the only place where I'm believed, and where it doesn't matter that I'm anonymous, because everyone else is too.   \n\\-  \nI looked up my name online, but nothing comes up.   \nI'm not mentioned in my deceased husband's obituary.  \nI have no birth certificate registered, no tax file number.   \nNo banks accounts in my name.   \nIt's like I've been erased, like I never existed.  \nI dont care about that now, all things considered.   \nI just want this silly deal to be over, but I needed to make sure others knew I wasn't a fickle of anyones imagination, that once, I was as real as you.",

On top of that, there's also the mocking from said entitled young adults who don't think a man should be a receptionist, a pretty frequent occurance for me, especially since my direct superior is a woman younger than me. \n\nSafe to say, I'm not exactly fond of the students I have to help at work. Thankfully, I can usually hide behind my desk Monday to Friday, but the weekends is where I take the brunt of the comments. \n\nI work both days on the weekends, mostly because my supervisor is a young mum of two, and also because I don't exactly have a social life or a partner waiting for me at home. So I volunteered, giving my supervisor Cammie some time to spend with her young boys. \n\nIt's long hours, a lot to deal with, and can be incredibly boring. But the worst part of my weekends is the hourly task I'm set. You'd think checking the boiler temperatures once an hour would be easy right? I just go into the Plant Room, check the water heaters and buffer vessels temps, and get out right? \n\nWrong.\n\nThe first weekend I worked, roughly 4 weeks ago now, my manager came back in for 8 AM, stating he has to walk me through the checks. It's not my first student accom job, and I've checked previous Plant Rooms before, so I thought this was unusual. But hey! Some places are really particular about how they do things, and how certain emploees enter dangerous spaces like these, so doing a first walkthrough with a manager wasn't too bad, and he'd volunteered to come in on his day off anyway so I wasn't too freaked.\n\nMy manager, David, showed me which key to grab to unlock the Plant Room, and took me out into our courtyard. The courtyard is big, space enough for benches and ping pong tables, and a couple of yards of grass and flowers. On one side, you have the entrance to the Reception space, and on the opposite side sits to Plant Room, it's double doors sat right next to those of the Bin Store.\n\nThe bin store stinks, even with the doors shut. It's 400 odd student's waste and rubbish, which half the time they can't even be bothered to throw into the industrial size rubbish bins, so there's rotted food and spilt milk puddles over the floor. Needless to say, the close proximity to the Plant Room meant I wasn't too suprised to find that room also stank like landfill. \n\nUnlocking the Plant Room door, there's a small concrete patio, for lack of a better description. It's a small sunken area of concrete, barely big enough to walk 10 steps in from side to side, and the floor is covered in that caution tape, yellow and black stripes to warn of the large step up into the main Plant Room.\n\nOne thing I will mention, is the Plant Room isn't loud, per se. It has a quiet hum of boilers and water tanks, but nothing that would stop you from hearing if anyone else was walking about. The concrete floor echoes even with the lightest of footsteps, and the actual machinery takes up so little space in the large concrete room, that it makes you wonder why it was built so big.\n\nDavid took me into the little patio area, and handed me the clipboard hanging from the wall. I was to take the temperatures from all three buffer vessels, and all three water heaters.\n\nIt's a five minute job at most, the machines are all grouped together closely and you can practically see the thermometers from one spot in the middle so it doesn't take long at all. But before I could head in up through the large step, David put a hand to my chest and stopped me.\n\nHe told me I had to follow a set of rules, cautionary procedures for an environment like this.\n\n1. Always turn the light on before heading into the main Plant Room (that one felt almost patronising, as how else would I be able to see the thermometers in a pitch black Plant Room?)\n\n2. Be in and out of the Main Plant Room in less than 8 minutes (weird, but he could be worried about the door being unlocked for too long and a curious student just wandering in)\n\n3. If you hear any noise that sounds like someone else is in the room with you, but the lights are still on, complete temperature checks in the next minute and leave (this was where I was starting to get a little freaked out)\n\n4. If the lights turn off at any point whilst you are in the Main Plant Room, do not turn on your phone or emit any light, and try to leave as quietly as possible. (definitely freaking out now)\n\n5. If the floor in the Main Plant Room is red or brown, do not enter for that hour.\n\n6. You will always be safe in the Patio.\n\nNow, I was getting spooked by these rules, even though I was trying to rationalise them in my head. The Main Plant Room has an exit that leads onto the main street, so perhaps there has been some issues with homeless people getting in through the secure maglocked doors?\n\nDavid explained that whilst it's best to check the Plant Room once an hour, it wasn't necessary to check so strictly, and that checking was mostly to ensure we hadn't lost heat in the building. He said the students would make it known if heating had gone down, and also pointed out the big laminated sign by the clipboard hanger that had all the rules clearly posted, in case I ever needed a harsh reminder. The lamination looked new, but the sign itself seemed to be old, the paper yellowed and the text slightly faded. \n\nThat first time in the Plant Room, nothing happened. Nothing happened for that entire weekend. No scary power outages, no noises, nothing. \n\nIt was the second weekend when it all started.\n\nI work 6AM to 6PM weekends, a long 12 hour shift, meaning I'd be checking the plant room 10 ish times a shift. Mostly because I wouldn't check during my hour break, and also because it was easy to forget to check on the hour every hour. You can get caught up doing other things, and David had made a point of telling me that I only needed to check as often as I could, not exactly on the hour. \n\nBut that second weekend, I'd not slept much the night before my shift, and I completely forgot to check until roughly 9:30 AM. I grabbed the key, headed into the courtyard, unlocked the door, and for safe measure- checked over the rules once again.\n\nStepping into the Main Plant Room, I headed straight for Water Heater 1, then check 2 and 3 before doing a 180 to check the Buffer Vessels. That was when the noises started. It sounded like faint tapping, like someone was clinking their nails against a pipe somewhere in the back of the room. \n\nI remember whipping around like crazy, trying to check behind pipes and see further into the darker areas of the large room, anxiety kicking in that I wasn't alone in the room. That was when the rational part of my brain kicked in, screaming at me louder than the anxious half that I only had a minute left to check the Buffer Vessels. I don't think I even wrote the numbers down, just glanced sparingly at the small dials and temperature gauges and then hauled my arse back to that patio. \n\nAs soon as I pushed the double doors open, a rancid, rotting meat scent wafted from somewhere. At the time, I assumed it was because some student had left the bin store doors wide open, so I shut them after locking the Plant Room doors. \n\nI was terrified to go back in another hour. But again, that rational part of my brain screamed that it was just anxiety, I was blowing things out of proportion, and that I was just nervous being alone in such a scary looking room. \n\nIt probably didn't help that I'd been watching those scary real life horror videos about people getting stuck in machinery and such, so I told myself I was worked up over nothing.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nI headed back in after an hour and a half had passed, enough time to calm myself down with a nice cup of tea and my brain sorting through student issues. Unlocked the door, flipped on the lights, steppped into the patio, and stopped dead in my tracks. \n\nThe floor of the Main Plant Room was red. Bright crimson, and shiny. The usually matte grey concrete floor was glistening under the fluorescent lights, and I could smell iron in the air. I knew immediately that it was blood, fresh blood even. How it got there and why was not my priority, but getting the hell out of the Plant Room was.\n\nNot even a mug of earl grey could calm me down after that, and I seriously debated never going back into that Plant Room. I debated forging numbers for my manager to look at on Monday morning, and I thought long and hard about quitting this job. I stayed out of the Plant Room for several hours that day, tooo scared to even be worried about the verbal jabs some of the students had thrown at me. \n\nBut eventually, bad luck struck again. Several students had come down to report their heating wasn't working, and others complained about a lack of hot water. Which meant I was forced to head once more into the Plant Room, and to my suprise, nothing happened.\n\nThe same boring old Plant Room was there when I unlocked the door, and nothing at all happened when I nervously stepped in to take the readings. I noted that all three were down to aboutt 30 degrees celcious, which was way lower than they should have been, so I called out our emergency plumber and that was that. \n\nIn fact, nothing happened for the rest of the weekend, leaving me wondering if I was daydreaming the whole thing. I have an overactive imagination, I like to see faces in trees and stuff like that, so perhaps the boredom of reception work had finally got to me, and I was letting the general spookyness of the room get to me. \n\nI did speak to David on Monday though, he'd called me in to chek up on me after my first 100% solo weekend shift. I explained half-heartedly that I thought solo work might be getting to me, and he asked me if the Plant Room had given me any trouble.\n\nI remember feeling dizzy after he asked me that. Blood rushing to my ears as iif this was confirmation of all my worst fears. I asked him what he meant, and he explained that the Plant Room was difficult to handle sometimes. And so I explained the red floor and the noise I heard, him nodding along like this was normal and I was the crazy one for being so scared.\n\n\"The Room is part of the Job.\" He had said. \"If you follow the Rules, you will be fine. So stop worrying.\" \n\nWhich leads me to last weekend, in which the Plant Room threw everything at me.\n\nThe floor was stained a dark brown hue that I knew in my gut was dried blood, and the noises were getting worse and worse, like there was something in there with me. A few times the noises started the second I stepped into the Patio, and I would be forced to retreat until the next hour. \n\nBut last Sunday, around roughly 5:40 PM, after I had stepped into the Main Plant Room, the lights went out. \n\nImmediate panic struck, I remember feeling that need for light, and reaching for my phone in blind fear, until I screamed to myself internally to NOT light up any part of the room. I was lucky, I had barely taken three steps into the Main Plant Room, and the Patio was just behind me. I took two steps back, slowly and quietly edging towards the safe haven that had been promised, and heard the most friightening sound of my life.\n\nIt was a deep, low growl, proceeded by heavy and fast footsteps, headed my way. I could hear them rattling in my brain, the sounds going right through me and causing all the hairs on my body to stand on end. I wanted to freeze, to curl myself into a ball and weep, but I forced myself to take that final step backwards and fell backwards into the Patio. I hit my head pretty hard on the concrete flooring, but I was safe. I could hear shuffling over the high ringing in my ears, and I opened the eyes I hadn't even noticed I was holding so tightly shut to see the glorious fluorescent tubes above me lit with that beautiful dim lighting.\n\nI didn't go back into the Plant Room that day. Lord knows I couldn't be persuaded back into there. Not even for a million pounds.\n\nI called my GP on Monday, said I'd taken a fall at work and wanted to have my head checked out for a concussion. He managed to squeeze me in on an emergency appointment and gave me a written note that I had a concussion and would be back in this weekend. \n\nUnfortunately, that meant I didn't see David last week. I couldn't explain to him what had ocurred at the weekend, and I wasn't able to argue my case for working alternative weekends with Cammie. \n\nI came in this morning to a written handover, detailing things I would need to know for this weekend, and at the bottom, in bold, capilised letters; \n\nENSURE YOU ARE CHECKING THE PLANT ROOM AT EVERY HOUR\n\nI checked this morning, more fearful of this than anything else in my life. The first hour was growling, and I took the temperatures quickly. The second hour was patchy red and brown flooring, and a stench of blood and rotted meat so foul I could only gag. The third and fourth hours were uneventful.\n\nThe fifth, sixth, and seventh hours, the noises got progressively worse. Footsteps, growling, tapping and banging noises, all accompanied by a metallic smell. \nThe eighth hour is the one just gone. The lights went out, and I managed to get back to the Patio without a concussion this time. But my eyes had adjusted to the dark well enought that I caught a shadowy glimpse of a figure, lurking just past the step into the Main Plant Room. It was taller than me, and thin. Unnaturally thin. Thin enough to hide out of sight behind pipes and boilers. I opened the door a crack, letting the natural sunlight into the Plant Room, and it darted away, moving at an impossible speed. \n\nI am afraid. I'm writing this out on my personal tablet, and putting this out to whatever forums or groups I can. I don't know what will happen in the next hour, and I don't know if I can survive the lights going out again. I'm so afraid.",

        "text": "\"Junos acting weird.\" I tell my boyfriend, whos dog I agreed to watch over the week while he's away on a business trip. \"I told you he's a bit weird, he was a stray and has some odd habits. Like you didn't touch his food or anything, right? He doesn't like that.\" My boyfriend says, drowsily over the phone. \"Mm.. No, he's just like.. Staring at me weird. I'm watching TV, and he's just sitting on the floor staring at me like I just killed his best friend or something.\" My boyfriend chuckles softly. \"It's probably just because I'm gone and he's not used to you. But it's late so im gonna go to bed. I'm sure he'll get used to you, kay? I'm gonna go now. Love you. \" he hangs up the phone, and I roll over. \n\n\"You're an odd little dog, Juno.\" I stare back at him for a few seconds, creeping myself out. I turn down the tv and shove my head into my pillow. \"Night you weirdo.\" \n\nI wake up, annoyed by the light coming in through my blinds, telling me it's morning and I have to actually get up. I sit up in my bed, yawning and checking the time on my phone. 7:13. I have to leave the house at eight, so I figure I better hurry and get up. \n\nI waddle into the kitchen, half asleep pouring water into the kettle and setting it down. \"Juno!\" I call out, opening his bag of food and scooping a cup of it out. \"Are you hungry, Juno?\" I get no response. I groan, pouring the food into his bowl. I search the living room, no Juno. Then I hear it, the little muffled sports and crackles coming from down the hallway. \n\n\"The fuck, Juno!\" There he is, in the middle of the hallway gnawing on some shit he pulled out of the trash. \"God, what do you have?\" I approach him, admittedly oddly threatening with my hand reaching out towards him.\n\nHis whips around, half yelping half barking. That's when I really look at him, how feral he looks. The food around his snout aren't helping his case. \"Juno!\" I scold him, but he ignores me. \n\nI scoff, not willing to get myself bit for leftover rotisserie chicken. \"I'll leave you to it then.\" I continue getting ready for classes. \n\nI herd Juno into my bedroom, making sure to close the door. \"Bye, don't eat any more chicken while I'm gone.\" I taunt him, snickering before leaving the house. \n\nI unlock my door, later after going to my classes and set down the takeout I'd gotten in the counter. I go to let Juno out of the bedroom, to find my door a crack open. He opened the door? I question, again, creeped out by some dog. \n\nThe house was eerily quiet, making me hyper alert of every little sound as I searched the house with no avail. \nShit. How could he have gotten out? I really lost my boyfriends dog? Shit. What am I gonna do? \"Juno! Pleaseeee..\" \n\n\"Just come out. You can't have gotten out. There's no way.\" I slump onto my couch. Shaking his bag of food as a last effort. I pick up my phone, feeling tears well in my eyes. \"Hey, what's up? Juno and you having a staring contest again?\" He teases, unaware of the fact I was on my last straw. \"I.. Hey.. I..\" I stutter, picking at the skin on my nails. \"I came home and Juno was just.. Gone. Before I left I put him in my bedroom, I swear! I locked the door I don't understand how he could've gotten out of the house I mean what kind of dog can open doors? And no dog can unlock doors! I'm so sorry I swear I'll find him I-\" \n\n\"Calm down! It's fine. Maybe he's just confused. Maybe he's trying to go home?\" I sob as he tries to comfort me. \"I'll go look. Right now. Maybe he's outside.\" I say, slipping my shoes on. \"No way, where you live? That's stupid. Just wait till morning.\" He demands, and he's right. Where I live I'd get mugged the moment I stepped out onto the street at this time of night. \n\n\"Fine. Okay. I love you and I'm so sorry. I really don't know how it happened I mean I really did--\" he cuts me off. \"I know, don't worry. It's ok. I love you too.\" He hangs up before I can continue my speach about how sorry I am. I turn on the TV, kicking off my shoes and opening my takeout. \n\nWhat if whatever he was eating made him sick? What if he ran away to die alone? What it's crowded my mind the whole night before exhaustion beat me. \n\nGrrrrrowl... Snap! \n\nI jolt awake, and there Juno is. He's scarfing down the food I'd left on the table, but something is wrong. Blood, his snout was smothered in blood and his feet are stained red as if he'd been soaking in it. \"Juno!\" I scoot back, startled. \n\nHe swallows an enchilada whole, before lunging at me. The fuck?! Juno isn't what I'd call a small dog, roughly 50-60 pounds and fully capable of overpowering me. I push him off the couch, and tumble over the side of the couch and make a run to my bedroom. \n\nFucking shit! He's right behind me, right on my tail as I slam the door. \n\nCrunch! I slammed the door right on his muzzle. \nThe noises behind the door are what haunt me, as if he was trying to escape his own skin, like something was trying to call out from inside him. The noises itself bring tears to my eyes. \n\nHe barks, growns and yelps as he scratches at the door, a desprate attempt to reach me. I step back, sitting on my bed contemplating what I'm going to do, realizing I'd left my phone in the living room. The barks and growls that terrified me so much just a second ago turn into something so oddly human. Like a humans awareness of pain was put into a dogs, like he understood his own mortality. \n\nThe barks and growls stop, and for a minute I wonder if he's dead out there. Laying in a pool of his own slobber, and possibly blood or maybe someone elses. God, I wonder where he was. Was he in the house? Was he outside, eating those people who wouldve mugged me if I'd gone out to look for him? \n\nThe fuck. The door flings open and Juno comes trampling through, so out of it that he runs straight into the wall and falls to the floor. Yellow puss is oozing from his eyes and mouth, a real gruesome sight to see as he snarls and growls, a mixture of blood, drool, and that puss stuff pooling in his mouth trickling out into the floor. He rolls over, lunging at me. Just as he reaches me, I throw the comforter on my bed over him. \n\nHe trips, and begins to shred the comforter. I slam the door behind me, running for my phone. \n\n\"911,  what's your emergency?\"\n\n\"My boyfriends dog! He's gone nuts or something, I think he has like rabies or something he just started attacking me all the sudden! He bit me!\" I said, my chest heaving.\"\n\n\"I understand, may I have your adress?\"\n\n\"Yes. It's 9908 [redacted]\"\n\n\"I've sent someone you're way. Please do not approach the animal.\"\n\n\"Okay.. Okay yes thank you..\"\n\nThe snarls and screams from Juno stop abrubptly. \n\n\"He stopped making noise.\" I say, looking towards the room. \n\n\"Okay. I've sent animal control. Please do not approach the animal.\" \n\nI step closer to listen, soft grunts coming from the room followed by snaps and gasping. \"God somethings really up with him!\" I cry out, listening to the hellish sounds. \nA brassy clatter erupts from the room followed by howls and screeching. Snap! Snap! Snap! It all stops abrubptly. \n\nThe police showed up shortly after, covering the body of Juno as the took him away. He was dead, they told me he had rabies and died in the room. But I don't believe them. They ordered that I had a professional cleaning service sent to clean the scene, which was normal but the way they immediately sent me away from the scene felt so odd. They never let me not my boyfriend see the body. I was given shots for rabies, tinnitus, all the works. \n\nMe and my boyfriend were okay after, he knew it wasn't my fault. The last few days have still been hell, though. The cleaning crew took unusually long, and once I returned home I just had no energy. And today, I woke up absolutely starving. I swear, I ate half my kitchen which is really not ideal for someone with my budget. I fell asleep at 2:00 and woke up at 11:30, and again I was just starved. That's when I noticed it, the itching. My thigh, we're Juno had bit had turned an odd shade of purple and itched like hell. I stumbled out of bed, and wiped my eyes. They had that crusty feeling you get when sick. There it was, though. On my index finger was that same yellow puss. Shit. Shit. \n\nI dial my boyfriend, tears in my eyes. I want to convince myself it'll be fine. It's a coincidence of some sort and I'll be fine. But clearly I've got something. \"What's going on?\" \n\n\"Hey what's going on? You okay?\" He questions me. But god.. He sounds so good. \"No.. No.. Come over please. I really need you. I need you.\" I mutter.. \n\n\"Okay, okay I'm coming. I'll be right over.\" He assures me. And I'm glad because God.. I'm so hungry.",

        "text": "Yesterday morning, I stepped out of my bedroom to find a perturbing door at the far end of my upstairs landing. The festering woodwork, coated in a layer of peeling purple paint, did not horrify me. What horrified me was that I had lived at the property for five years — there had never previously been a door at the end of the corridor.\n\nEven from a distance, I could tell that the ghastly gateway was more than a propped-up plank of wood. It was flush against the outer wall of the house. I strolled outside my property and skirted around to the side-alley. The right-hand wall of my home was still flat. There were no extensions to the original brickwork. The purple doorway couldn’t be leading to anything. Behind it, I knew there couldn’t be anything but the plaster of my wall.\n\nBut I’m a firm believer in not fucking with the unknown. I’ve watched enough horror films to know that I should listen to my preservation instinct rather than my curiosity. That was why I rang my wife — well, ex-wife.\n\n“What do you want, Ethan?” Hannah asked, sighing.\n\n“Something weird just happened at the house. There’s a door,” I said.\n\n“What is this really about, Ethan? I told you that you couldn’t keep doing this.”\n\n“Sorry, let me explain,” I pleaded. “There’s a door at the end of my hallway that wasn’t there last night. I’ve never seen it before.”\n\n“Are you drunk again?” Hannah asked. “It’s ten in the morning.”\n\n“I’m not drunk!” I insisted. “I haven’t had a drink in weeks. I just-”\n\n“- I really care about you, Ethan,” Hannah interrupted. “You know I do. And I’ll always love you. It was never about that. I just couldn’t watch you slowly kill yourself.”\n\nThere was a muffled voice at the other end of the line, and that was when I realised my daughter, Kate, must be at her mother’s house. I could vaguely hear the two of them bickering, and then my daughter snatched the phone from Hannah.\n\n“Hey, Dad,” She cheerfully said.\n\n“Hi,” I replied. “Sorry to interrupt. I didn’t realise you were visiting Mum.”\n\n“I booked some time off work. I needed to get away from Ry— from… London. Plus, I missed you guys. I was going to come and surprise you tomorrow, but I guess the cat’s out of the bag now,” She chuckled.\n\nI smiled, ignoring the real reason she needed to get away. “That’s sweet of you. Worried about your frail, elderly parents?”\n\n“Elderly? You’re fifty-four,” She snorted. “That’s the new… forty-four, I guess? Anyway, what were you and Mum arguing about? What’s happened at the house?”\n\n“Nothing,” I mumbled. “It’s nothing… I promise.”\n\n“You sounded agitated,” Kate pressed. “I could hear your voice from the other room.”\n\n“You’re going to think I’ve gone senile,” I sighed. “Even though, like you said, I’m not an old man yet.”\n\n“Go on,” Kate said.\n\nI cleared my throat. “Well, something weird happened this morning. I’m standing on the landing right now, facing a purple door that never used to be there.”\n\nKate paused. “And you’ve not been… you know-”\n\n“- I’ve not been drinking,” I assured her.\n\n“I’m going to come over early, Dad,” Kate said. “I’m worried about you now.”\n\nWhen my daughter arrived, she seemed utterly perplexed by the rotten, purple door at the end of my upstairs landing. I think she’d expected to turn up and prove that it had simply been a drunken delusion. But I was no inebriated fool — Kate saw the door there, as plainly as day.\n\n“I mean… Obviously, I’ve never lived here, and I don’t visit as often as I should… But I’m certain I’ve never seen that door before,” She gulped. “You’re not teasing me, right? That would be really mean.”\n\n“I’m not teasing you,” I insisted.\n\n“Good,” Kate huffed. “I’ve not had a fun week, Dad.”\n\n“Yeah, I know you were really just running away from Ryan. Want me to rough him up?” I asked.\n\nKate smiled at me, knowing full well that I was incapable of ‘roughing up’ anyone. She shook her head, and then she did the darnedest thing — without a word, as if she had no survival instincts whatsoever, she walked towards the door. Of course, Kate didn’t believe in the supernatural.\n\nBut she would.\n\n“Wait, what are you doing?” I asked.\n\n“What does it look like I’m doing?” Kate scoffed. “We’re not going to get any answers until we open it.”\n\n“Please don’t…” I said.\n\nI lunged after her, but my daughter was far too nimble. She had already reached the door and twisted its loose, squeaky, brass handle. As the purple gateway opened, I trembled. The door didn’t lead to my wall. There was a room back there. A room I didn’t recognise.\n\n“But this is the far wall of the house,” Kate whispered. “How could there be a room back there?”\n\nShe stepped inside, and I followed. To my surprise, I found myself facing a rather uninspired, banal bedroom. Cream-coloured walls, a single bed with nothing but a damp mattress, an old oak wardrobe, and a chest of drawers.\n\nThe bedroom window — a slim, wide slit that scarcely allowed any light into the dim room — looked onto my street from an oddly low level. But then again, why should I have expected anything to make sense?\n\n“What is this place?” I wondered aloud.\n\nKate was already hunting for the answer to that question. As she neared the wardrobe, we both froze at a sudden creaking sound. My heart, like a caged animal, began to frantically bang against the brittle bars of my ribcage.\n\n“Don’t do it,” I begged.\n\nKate ignored me and threw the doors open. She hesitated for a moment, then released a relieved laugh. I strolled over and saw that the wardrobe, much like the rest of the room, was mostly empty. All that hung there was a red leather jacket.\n\n“I’m actually a little glad to find nothing significant in this paranormal place,” I said, untying the stubborn knot in my chest.\n\n“Don’t you want an answer?” Kate replied.\n\nI shrugged. “Some things in this world defy reason. You know I saw Grandma’s ghost when I was a boy.”\n\n“You think you did, but everything has a rational explanation,” Kate said. “Even… this.”\n\n“Let’s just go back to-” I started.\n\nBefore I could finish my sentence, a rumbling noise erupted behind us. We turned to see the door, our only exit out of the room, slowly slide into the floor — shortening with every passing moment. And then, with sinister synchronicity, a ghastly groaning sound emitted from the chest of drawers beneath the bedroom window. The top drawer started to open, and I gripped my daughter’s shoulders.\n\n“We’re not waiting around to be trapped in here,” I said. “Get to the door — now!”\n\nKate’s reverted back to an innocent, vulnerable girl. She actually listened to me and sprinted for the ever-sinking doorway. My daughter commando-crawled through the minuscule opening, and I heard the horrifying sound of bending wood from the chest of drawers.\n\nTurning to meet my doom, I shrieked at the sight of a crying contortionist. A young woman, no older than my daughter, was sitting upright in the top drawer of the chest, snapping her ghoulish limbs into shape. I’ve no idea how she confined herself to that space, but I can only assume she wasn’t alive — not anymore.\n\nThe woman, dressed in a damp, yellow, floral dress, clambered out of the drawer. Supporting herself with her hands, she landed on the carpet and twisted her legs into shape, hoisting the rest of her body out of the drawer. Her incessant sobbing transformed into frightening frothing as she laid her glazed-over eyes upon me.\n\nThrough the matted, greasy strands of her waist-length hair, I could see the woman’s hatred. The undead and unkempt apparition didn’t know me, but her face said otherwise.\n\n“*You*,” She hauntingly hissed.\n\nI wailed, almost certain that Death had come to reap my soul — penance for years of bludgeoning my body and mind with liquor — but a hand extended through the rapidly-shortening doorway.\n\n“Take my hand!” My daughter cried.\n\nI dropped to the floor, scrambling to squeeze my body through the doorway — which must only have been about two feet tall at that point — and started to emerge onto my familiar upstairs landing. I had almost wrenched my final leg free, but the ghoulish woman suddenly seized my ankle and unleashed a victorious growl. I screamed, striving to escape the demon and the door frame threatening to crush my leg.\n\n“Terrence, save me!” The ghostly woman screeched.\n\nI managed to free my leg and slide through the doorway before it fully melted into the carpet. The room vanished.\n\n“You’ve talked about Terrence before,” Kate eventually said.\n\nI nodded. “Terrence Brown. Your mum and I call him Brown the Clown. Always making people laugh. I often see him in the local cafe.”\n\n“Well, I think you need to pay him a visit tomorrow,” Kate said. “But right now, I need some food and a drink.” \n\nI agreed to phone Terrence in the morning, but part of me prayed that the horror of the appearing and disappearing room had come to a terrifying end.\n\nNo such luck. This morning, I woke to Kate’s piercing scream. Before I even stepped onto the landing, I knew the door had returned. I guess I need to talk to Terrence Brown. I’ll update you as soon as possible.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

        "text": "The Hivemind was coming, and the galaxy trembled at the thought. For years, the massive alien fleet had been destroying planets and enslaving entire civilizations, and no one had been able to stop them. The Xandarians had fought valiantly, but they were vastly outnumbered and outmatched.\n\nIt was then that the humans had come into the picture. The Xandarians had been watching Earth for centuries, waiting for humanity to reach a level of technological advancement that would allow for communication. And when they had finally made contact, the Xandarians saw in humanity a glimmer of hope.\n\nHumanity had always been adept at warfare, and with the Xandarian's advanced weaponry and technology, they stood a chance against the Hivemind. And so, a powerful alliance was formed, one that would soon be put to the test.\n\nThe Hivemind arrived in the galaxy like a storm, their massive ships blotting out the stars. The Xandarian fleet was waiting for them, their weapons at the ready, but the Hivemind was too powerful. They smashed through the Xandarian's defenses, their weapons tearing through the Xandarian ships like paper.\n\nThe humans arrived soon after, their own fleet joining the Xandarians in battle. They fought valiantly, but it was clear that they were no match for the Hivemind. The Hivemind's ships were enormous and heavily armed, and their weapons were far more advanced than anything humanity had ever seen.\n\nAs the battle raged on, the alliance discovered a weakness in the Hivemind's defenses. They had a central command ship that controlled the entire fleet, and if that ship was destroyed, the Hivemind would be powerless.\n\nA daring plan was hatched. A small team of humans and Xandarians would board the command ship and take it out from the inside. The plan was risky, but the alliance knew it was their only chance.\n\nThe team managed to infiltrate the command ship and fight their way to the central control room. There, they found the Hivemind's leader, a massive, insectoid creature that towered over them. The team fought bravely, using their advanced weapons and Xandarian technology to take down the creature.\n\nWith the Hivemind leader dead, the rest of the fleet was quickly destroyed. The alliance had saved the galaxy from destruction.\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle, the alliance was hailed as heroes. They had formed an unbreakable bond, and together they would continue to explore the galaxy, discovering new worlds and new civilizations.\n\nBut the victory was short-lived. The Hivemind was not defeated, merely wounded. They regrouped and came back with a vengeance, their ships larger and more powerful than ever.\n\nThe humans and Xandarians were ready, however. They had been preparing for the Hivemind's return, and their weapons and technology were now more advanced than ever.\n\nThe second battle was even more epic than the first. The alliance fought with all their might, their weapons tearing through the Hivemind's ships like butter. But the Hivemind had also improved, and their ships were now heavily armored and bristling with advanced weaponry.\n\nThe battle raged on for days, the alliance and the Hivemind locked in a deadly dance. But finally, the Hivemind's central command ship was destroyed, and the Hivemind was defeated.\n\nThe alliance had saved the galaxy once again, but the victory came at a great cost. The Xandarians had suffered heavy losses, and the humans had lost many of their best soldiers and ships.\n\nThe alliance mourned their losses, but they knew that they had saved the galaxy from an even greater threat. They had proved that even in the face of overwhelming odds, humans and Xandarians could work together to achieve the impossible.\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle, the alliance turned their attention to rebuilding. They knew that the Hivemind was not the only threat out there, and that they needed to be prepared for whatever came next.\n\nTogether, the humans and Xandarians began to develop new technologies, weapons, and defenses. They scoured the galaxy for new allies, and formed new alliances with other civilizations that had also been threatened by the Hivemind.\n\nThe alliance became known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, and they patrolled the stars, ready to defend against any threats that might come their way.\n\nYears passed, and the Guardians of the Galaxy became a legend. Stories of their bravery and heroism spread throughout the galaxy, and entire civilizations looked to them for protection.\n\nBut the peace was not to last. A new threat was emerging from the depths of space, a threat even greater than the Hivemind.\n\nIt was a race of creatures known only as the Devourers. They were ancient beings, older than the galaxy itself, and they had a hunger that could never be satisfied. They consumed entire planets, leaving nothing but dust and rubble in their wake.\n\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy knew that they had to act quickly. They called upon all their allies, and together they formed the largest fleet the galaxy had ever seen.\n\nThe battle was fierce, with the Devourers tearing through the fleet like it was nothing. But the Guardians had a secret weapon, a weapon that had been developed specifically to fight the Devourers.\n\nIt was a massive, planet-sized ship, with weapons that could destroy entire solar systems. The ship was piloted by a team of the bravest Xandarian and human pilots, and together they flew straight into the heart of the Devourers' territory.\n\nThe battle was intense, with the planet-sized ship and the Devourers trading blows that shook the very fabric of the galaxy. But finally, the Guardians emerged victorious.\n\nThe Devourers were defeated, and the galaxy was safe once again. The Guardians of the Galaxy had proven that even the most ancient and powerful of foes could be defeated with determination and bravery.\n\nAnd so, the alliance between humans and Xandarians continued, stronger than ever before. They had saved the galaxy from destruction, and they knew that whatever came next, they would face it together, as Guardians of the Galaxy. ",

        "text": " \n\nThe old, abandoned house on Maple Street had always been a source of curiosity for the neighborhood kids. It was said that the house had been vacant for decades, ever since the tragic death of its last owner, a wealthy recluse named Mr. Whittaker. Rumors circulated that Mr. Whittaker had been a collector of rare and unusual artifacts, and that his house was filled with mysterious and unsettling objects.\n\nOne summer evening, a group of teenagers decided to explore the house, eager to satisfy their curiosity about the rumors. They approached the house cautiously, peering through the windows and testing the doorknob. To their surprise, the door swung open with a creak, revealing a dark and musty interior.\n\nThe teenagers hesitated, but curiosity got the better of them. They crept inside, their flashlights illuminating the dimly lit rooms. As they explored the house, they discovered that the rumors were true – the walls were lined with shelves filled with strange and otherworldly objects. There were jars filled with murky liquid and strange specimens, ancient-looking books with indecipherable text, and bizarre contraptions that seemed to have no practical purpose.\n\nAs they explored deeper into the house, they began to feel a strange sense of unease. The air grew thicker and heavier, and they could hear faint whispers and murmurs coming from the shadows. Suddenly, one of the teenagers let out a bloodcurdling scream.\n\nThe rest of the group ran to where the scream had come from, only to find their friend lying on the ground, motionless. At first, they thought he had simply fainted from fear, but as they gathered around him, they realized that something was very wrong. His skin was cold and clammy, and his eyes were fixed in a stare of terror.\n\nPanic set in as the group realized that they were trapped in the house with whatever had caused their friend's sudden collapse. They tried to leave, but the doors and windows were now locked tight. As they searched for a way out, they began to notice that the objects in the house were beginning to move on their own – the jars were shaking, the books were fluttering their pages, and the contraptions were whirring and clicking.\n\nSuddenly, the whispers grew louder, and the group realized that they were not alone. They could hear the sound of footsteps coming from the shadows, and a voice that seemed to be speaking in some ancient, arcane language. They huddled together in fear, praying for a way out.\n\nHours passed, and the group began to feel the effects of whatever was happening to them. They felt weak and disoriented, as though they were being drained of their energy. They realized that they were slowly being consumed by the dark and malevolent force that permeated the house.\n\nAs they lay there, helpless and afraid, they suddenly heard a loud banging on the front door. A voice called out, asking if anyone was inside. With renewed hope, the group called out for help. The door burst open, and a group of police officers rushed inside.\n\nThe officers found the teenagers lying on the ground, barely conscious. They quickly called for an ambulance and began to search the house. What they found was beyond their wildest imaginations – the shelves were now empty, and the strange artifacts had disappeared without a trace. The house was now completely empty, as if nothing had ever been there.\n\nThe teenagers were rushed to the hospital, where they were treated for a mysterious illness that seemed to have no known cause. They were never the same after that night – they suffered from nightmares and hallucinations, and they could never quite shake the feeling that something had attached itself to them.\n\nThe old house on Maple Street remained empty, a dark and foreboding presence in",

        "text": "I’m a patient in a psychiatric ward, every now and then I can still feel the shadows creeping up on me. They were always there, lurking in the corners of my mind, tormenting me with their presence. I was never able to control my thoughts or actions because they were always there, whispering to me, urging me to do things I didn't want to do.\n\nAt first, I thought it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. I would see things out of the corner of my eye, a fleeting glimpse of a dark figure moving in the shadows. But as time went on, the shadows became more and more real. They would whisper to me in the dead of night, telling me to do unspeakable things. They could move objects, hurt people.\n\nI tried to ignore them, to shut them out, but they were always there, lurking in the dark corners. And then one night, they finally took control. I don't remember much of what happened, but when I woke up the next morning, I was covered in blood. \n\nMy nurse tried to tell me that it was just a nightmare, that I had imagined everything, but I knew the truth. The shadows had taken control, and I was just a puppet, dancing to their tune.\n\nAfter that, they put me in isolation, locked me away in a small, windowless room. I thought that would be the end of it, that the shadows would finally leave me alone. But I was wrong. They were still there, whispering to me through the walls, calling out to me in the darkness.\n\nDays turned into weeks, weeks turned into months, and I began to lose track of time. I was trapped in that room, tormented by the shadows that would never leave me alone.\n\nAnd then one day, I woke up to find that the door to my room was open. I don't know how it happened, but I knew it was a trap. The shadows were luring me out, tempting me with the promise of freedom.\n\nBut I couldn't resist. I stumbled out of my room, my heart pounding in my chest. The hallway was dark, and I could hear the whispers of the shadows echoing through the walls.\n\nI tried to run, but my legs felt like lead. The shadows were closing in on me, suffocating me with their darkness. And then I saw it, a figure standing at the end of the hallway, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly light. It stepped forward with the nurse dead beside them.\n\nI tried to turn back, but it was too late. The figure stepped toward me, and I felt a cold, clammy hand close around my neck. And then it went black.\n\nWhen I woke up, I was back in my room, but something was different. The shadows were gone, and I felt a sense of peace that I had never experienced before.  I don't know what happened that night, but I do know one thing. The shadows are real, and they will never stop. Not until they get me.",

        "text": "The Elder Gods ain't just whistling Dixie. First of all, they don't whistle. Second, they exist, whether you believe in them or not (more on that later). Third, you do NOT want to notice them, or have them notice you.\n\nI know that now.\n\nThey're coming.\n\nH.P Lovecraft was a high-school dropout and a racist. Trying to fit in gave him repeated nervous breakdowns. He got his start as a writer by writing whiny letters to the pulps complaining about the quality of other writers' work. He was never able to support himself with his stories and poems, and lived off family money. When that ran out he married, and his wife supported him. He was a mama's boy, a shrinking violet, an also-ran.\n\nBut he had a great name, and a pretty good imagination. Maybe too good. He imagined things that took root in the minds of others, fired their dreams, and spread and spread. People read his stories and saw the world in a new way. It was like a virus; like a plague; like an invasion of body snatchers.\n\nIt had power. You see, some things exist: you can eat them, burn them, or put them in the trunk of your car. In the great dichotomy of Is and Isn't, they Is. Reality as we know it.\n\nBut, you say, some things are real but not tangible. They can be felt, but not seen or measured. Things like Hope, Freedom, God. Things Worth Capitalizing.\n\nYou're right, they do exist. They exist because because we believe, we think, we created them. God began when we imagined them, called out to them for help, and blamed them for tragedy. Hope was created the first time someone thought that life could be better than mud, spoiled food, and disease. They were wrong, but we still hope.\n\nOur world changed when God began, and when Hope began, and all those other capitalizable intangibles. We can measure their effects, if not the things themselves. So they must be real, even though they have no shape, no bodies, no pustulent appendages, no ichor-smeared talons reaching, always reaching.\n\nNot here at least. But they Is, somewhere. They have to be. Their bodies are somewhere just beyond our ability to perceive them.\n\nI know that now.\n\nThey're coming.\n\nScoff all you like, it's a free country. Don't believe me. The less you believe in a thing, the less of it there is. But don't think about it too much. Because thought has the same kind of generative energy as belief. We talk about \"jinxing\" something: creating failure by thinking or talking about it. It happens, you know it does. Remember that one time? Or more than one, in my case.\n\nLovecraft didn't believe in Cthulhu. Not at first at, least. But he did do a lot of thinking about the first and greatest, the deepest and darkest, the god who allows humanity to exist through ignorance, not benevolence. Wisps became threads; threads became sinews; sinews became - you know the rest. I don't have to do the whole knee bone, thigh bone thing.\n\nSo now, Cthulhu exists. Ask anyone. Probably more people believe in Cthulhu than believe in Jesus - who also must exist, by the way, and for the same reasons. And people think he's cool. Cthulhu, I mean. But listen again. They EXIST. not as a concept, or a joke, or in \"finger quotes.\" They became real when we made them real, BECAUSE we made them real.\n\nI know that now.\n\nThey're coming.\n\nThe folks at the front desk said this story needs to be a personal experience, and that the narrator needs to be frightened. Not a tangential essay on the instantiation of Socratic archetypes. OK, OK, I'll comply, don't tase me bro. It happened to me, personally, and I am frightened. More than that, I'm a thing that's in the same direction as frightened, but far beyond it. A new kind of fear that I am creating now, by thinking about it too much. See how that works?\n\nBecause, you see, I SAW. And they saw me back. I was horrified. I soiled myself. They were mildly annoyed. But when you are dealing with a thing that has eyes the size of Jupiter, and too many of them to count, even annoyance is a bad thing. Now they're aware of us, in the dust of the corner of the room they never use. And They are thinking about sweeping up.\n\nI know that now.\n\nThey're coming.\n\nSo what makes me the Harbinger of Doom? How did I spill coffee on the Thing That Ends All Things, and bring down its wrath - final, fiery, and indifferent? Hell if I know. I'm nobody special. But I've been told I overthink things. Which, in light of recent discussions, makes me a wizard of some sort.\n\nI started digging into Lovecraft and his pet monsters as research for a story I was writing - this one in fact, though everything changed when the tale grew a tail. Interest becomes hobbby, becomes obsession, becomes clickbait, becomes conspiracy theory. Yeah, knee bone, thigh bone. People who used to enjoy my company for cool Cthulhu trivia now avoided eye contact for the same reason. Somehow I generated enough thought-and-belief wattage to create a tiny spark. There were other sparks, separated by time, space, and levels of belief. But there were just enough kooks in my corner of the astral plane to weaken the veil, to Nudge Open The Eternal Door, to pop open the buttons on the buttflap of the long johns of the universe.\n\nIn a moment, I saw. For a moment, I saw. Darkness and light. Fire and freezing. The visceral understanding of a thing too big to see and impossible to ignore. Imagine those eyeballs, each the size of Jupiter, as they all turn toward you and focus on your insignificant ass. Everyone wants to be noticed. But not like this.\n\nWe don't know how we came into this world, or how we'll leave. In the same way, I don't know what took me into their immeasurable presence, or how I withdrew. Maybe I was there for longer than I realized, but my brain was unable to hold anything beyond that first Gaze. When I became aware of myself again, I only knew a few things. I already mentioned the soiling, let's move on. I didn't know names, or motives, or timetables. But I was sure that those Things from The Other Place were now aware of us, and might want to peer into our corner. It could happen soon. Or never. Maybe I'm crazy. I hope I am.\n\nBecause if I'm not, I have somehow brought about the Great Reckoning, the End Of All Things, the Ultimate Capitalization.\n\nDo me a favor: when you're done reading this, shrug and keep scrolling. Don't believe me, and for God's sake don't think about it later. Because thinking has consequences. Keep it light, have a laugh, smoke some weed.\n\nI know that now.\n\nThey're coming.\n\nI'm sorry.",

        "text": "To the average person with the most basic experiences, a post such as this can be a simple task you'd forget in the following weeks and months. However, this isn't some meme. It certainly isn't a confession, despite what some might believe. It's a testimony, retribution for all of the tinfoil hat-wearing conspiracy theorists. I don't know if I believe in the boogeyman or a giant serpent that dwells within lochs. I do believe that nature has a tendency to go off script and concoct things that even the most insane of individuals have a hard time accepting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was a father, and I'm not going to claim I was a perfect father. I made mistakes, missing the occasional ball game because I would rather drink with friends. I was also a husband, and my imperfections seeped into that relationship as well. I would never once claim I didn't love my family though. I helped with my son's homework occasionally, and I did everything I could to help with my wife's chronic pain despite the hatred she had for me since discovering the affair I had prior to her accident. We were a family that stayed together no matter the incident, however. That was the case before the Cricket took my son, and my wife blamed me for it all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was close to the 4th of July over two years ago and our time was spent preparing for the festivities. My family and I lived together in rural Missouri, living on a small plot of land. We took advantage of it every 4th, making a modestly sized firework show for friends and family. You see, we had a spacious backyard that had a tool/watershed as well as some other structures that remained from the previous owner who was a farmer.  Connected to that backyard was a gate, and past that gate was a small field. Looking out from the gate, if you looked to your left was a dense pocket of trees filled with rosebushes and thick brush.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was just me and Andrew (my son), and we were cutting down the tall grass in the field to accommodate the fireworks we would later set up. While I ran the mower I had Andrew moving limbs and various other things to the edge of the trees in a neat pile. There wasn't much work to go left as the sun began to descend, indicating our busy day was about to come to a close. I had my wireless headphones on, blaring the same tired '80s hairband playlist that played many times before. When I was nearly done with the last row of grass, I looked near the area my son would have been finishing up as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, he was nowhere to be seen. It wasn't like he would be deep in the plot of trees, because right at where the pile was thick thorns and brush that no one had any business going through. I rode my mower to the pile to see if he just wasn't sitting down somewhere where the view was the least bit obscured. He wasn't there. The pile sat neatly where it was instructed to be, not a soul in sight. Oddly enough as well, the sounds of cicadas were at an uncharacteristic silence. I pulled down my headphones, the blare of music being the only comfort in the defining silence. After a moment of sitting there trying to figure out where my son went, I started to hear one of the most disheartening sounds of my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI heard the soft whimpers of a child, and at that, I dove off of my mower and ran towards the brush. It sounded like the whimpering was coming past the thorns, and I had no choice but to dive through it. As expected, it hurt like a mother. I usually only wear a t-shirt and shorts while mowing since I had my son do most of the other tasks while doing yard work. I ran and ran through the dense brush, tripping along the way while letting out a stream of curses under my breath in between the cries for my son.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Andrew\" I cried through hurried breath.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet there was no answer, and I kept running. It was roughly 50 more yards of running through the brush that I realized something was off with this picture. I should've come out the other side of the pocket of trees into my neighbor's yard, one of the few that were scattered in the area our house was in. While you wouldn't notice on either side because of how dense everything was, it was only a 45-yard walk through the brush and the trees between houses. At this point I had run, I don't know, roughly 60.  Another peculiar thing was how dark it was despite there still being a few hours before sunset. What was supposed to be a soft orange of the late day sun was the dark purple and shadow that indicated a time best spent eating dinner or getting ready for bed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis time the whimpering started to my left, and I promptly changed direction. The further I moved in this direction the more I heard other sounds. The sounds of cicadas, crickets, and owls came alive in a cacophony of nature. These noises the \"animals\" made weren't natural though. It sounded almost like the noises made were intended to be a mockery of the real things. The cricket's chirps sounded like they were chastising me, and the cicada's trill sounded like alien laughter as I bled and cursed, and the owl's hoot sounded like it was alarming all of its kin of the games that were being played in the wilderness tonight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tripped again, and it caused me to stumble down a leaf-covered hill into a very small clearing surrounded by trees. I lay on the ground as the noises grew louder. They circled around me, all of them coming together to form a tidal wave the river Styx itself conjured up to torment me. All of the times I skipped my son's baseball games, the secret affair I swore wouldn't continue after my wife got in a car accident, and even the time I kept it secret that my sister stole some of my dad's money to purchase alcohol way back in high school. It all slammed like a sledgehammer, and in the dirt, I started to hyperventilate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy eyes darted around the clearing frantically, and in my panicked state, I started to see glowing eyes of various colors and shapes. All of them stared at me, and each of them told their own story. Some looked at me with vicious mockery. Others looked at me with unfathomable hate. There were even a few that I could say genuinely pitied me for the position I was in. One stood out over the rest, one I now call Cricket. While the other eyes betrayed a short stature or animalistic hunch, these eyes towered. A disgusting brown color glared into my eyes, and unlike the other eyes, their intention wasn't clear. They were almost indifferent as if this was the only way it would end. The figure approached me, the shadows surrounding us getting darker and the noises getting louder. I couldn't hear the mockery, the hunger, the hate, or the despair as the figure loomed over me in abysmal shadow. I only heard a ringing like tinnitus in my ears.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what happened after that though, because what I recollect after that is a desperate spring to my porch. I crashed through my backdoor, startling my wife. I crashed on the floor and started speaking in such a hurried tone that my wife stood no chance of deciphering such lunacy. The only thing she could decipher gave her pause, and she stared at me in confusion and shock.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Our boy\" I choked out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"What did you do?\" she asked with venom in her voice\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I-I-I'm so sorry, Please help me-help us. I don't know what to do...what we do. I don't know help me\" I repeated\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that everything was a blur. My wife called the police while my mind unraveled on the ground. The following months were filled with questions. Questions as to what my mental state was, for which abnormally dissipated as if it were the flu. Questions as to my involvement in the disappearance, which wasn't conclusive due to lack of evidence I even did anything aside from going insane. It didn't matter if the police or people I used to call friends had their suspicions. What hurt most was my wife actually believed I would commit an atrocious act such as filicide. She left to live with her parents since the car accident left her with chronic pain and she couldn't really afford to live on her own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wasn't alone though. Throughout the investigation, I came into contact with someone. He was of average height, a fit build, and he sported dark brown hair with dark brown eyes. They were tired eyes, something he said we shared. He gave me advice on how to avoid certain questions. He wasn't exactly a friend, but I could tell he was in my corner. While I stayed hidden in my home from prying eyes for the past two years he would send the occasional text asking how I was doing. Eventually, he started providing more. Information as to what transpired, as well as why he had an interest in the ruined life I have now. This is what I have learned thus far.",

        "text": "Three months ago he got injured on the job. Getting the call from the hospital was the worst day of my life. I don’t think I understood how much I still loved him until I spent a 20 minute drive imagining the ways he could have died. All those stupid fights about how much time he’d been spending at work, the money, not spending enough time with the kids, they all washed away. All I could think was to pray. *Please, God, I can’t do this alone*. \n\nWhat bothers me the most is I don’t know what happened to him that afternoon. He won’t say a word about his work. He never has. But I knew that coming in. He told me on the first date that he couldn’t tell me about it, and I accepted it. It’s hard to accept on the days he comes home stressed. The most I’ve gotten out of him is that he makes deals with programming machines for some sector of the government that commissions his company for… something. Whatever it is earns a good payday. I guess it buys his silence.\n\n“It’s not that different from other jobs. A desk, a computer, obnoxious buzzing lights, soul sucking cubicles. It’s just like The Office. Only difference is none of my co-workers are funny.” That’s what Hank said the last time we fought about him spending so much time at his job. \n\n“So that’s why I’ve never met any of them, then?” I winced as soon as the words left my mouth. We’ve fought more than once about my tendency to want to pry information about his job. \n\n“I spend 50 hours a week with them. Every spare second belongs to you.” He said it with a wink, kissed me on the forehead, and popped open a bottle of beer from the fridge. His usual routine when he didn’t want to talk about it anymore. \n\n“60.”\n\n“What’s that?” he asked as he flopped into his chair and flicked on the TV. \n\n“You work *60* hours a week.” \n\n“Don’t remind me.” He said everything with a smirk. He carried an easiness in his voice, like he always did, but I’d known him long enough to tell that something was bothering him. \n\nWhatever ate at him got worse towards the day of the accident. I responded by going into overdrive. I did what I could to make a welcoming house to come home to. He became sensitive to light and sound, except for the TV. I bought special lights I could put on a dimmer, made dinner every night. Even so, he started lashing out at me, and the kids, in ways he never had before.\n\nOur intimacy plummeted to zero. I didn’t let it get to me. I know couples ebb and flow. But we didn’t even spend time together anymore. I missed his touch. Any touch. But I gave him space. I knew stress was a problem for him, even if I didn’t understand why. All he ever wanted to do was sit in his den and watch TV. I ended up spending most of my nights alone. I’d feed the kids, put them to bed, then read for a couple hours in bed. After a few months of this, wine became involved. But it didn’t dull how lonely I’d become. Every night I fell asleep alone. When I woke, he’d already be gone. \n\nThe night before the accident, I woke up sick at two in the morning. *At least I know I’m not pregnant*. I flushed the contents of my stomach and glanced back towards my bed, double checking what I already knew. I was alone. Again. A fleeting thought that told me he didn’t love me anymore flickered into my throat. I pushed it down, composed myself, and threw on some pajamas to go hunt him down. \n\nThe dull glow of TV light shone against the bottom few stairs as I made my way into the basement. Empty beer bottles and stained, wet carpet surrounded his chair, which sat not ten feet from the blaring TV, which wasn’t playing anything, just static. The top of Hank’s head poked over his recliner. Thinking he was sleeping, I straddled onto his lap as smoothly as I could manage, settled my knees around his legs, and looked up into his face. To my shock, he was staring right at me, his red, bloodshot eyes wide open.\n\nIt startled me, but I tried not to show it. I stroked his hair and kissed his ear, but he didn’t move. “Hi, Hank,” I whispered. Still no response. I leaned back up a little quicker than I wanted, showing my frustration. His eyes were still wide open, but he didn’t react to me at all, like he was staring right through me. The TV static blared in my ears. I grabbed the remote and turned it off. The very second the TV went black, Hank jolted upright. \n\nI yelped and jumped back off his chair. \n\n“Turn that back on right now.” I was too stunned to react.\n\n“Turn it back on! I was watching that!” He wasn’t just yelling, he was *screaming*. I fumbled with the remote in my shaking hands, but he ripped it out of my grasp before I could steady myself and flicked the TV back onto the same static. As soon as the static was back on the screen, Hank eased back into his chair and reformed his face into the same blank, unblinking expression. \n\nI cried myself back to sleep that night, harboring thoughts of divorce for the first time in eleven years of marriage. \n\nThe weeks after the accident were even harder. The hospital discharged him after three days, and his extensive care routine had become my job, on top of caring for the house and kids. For reasons that none of the countless specialists Hank’s company brought in and all their extensive testing could explain, the accident left him paralyzed from the waist down. The doctors wired his jaw shut, so every three hours I had to feed him by shoving a straw through his lips that lead to some brown, blended mixture the hospital had supplied me with.\n\nOn top of it all, he couldn’t speak. I haven’t heard a single word come out of my husband’s mouth in three months. Nothing but irritated groans when he’s awake, and snores when he’s asleep. \n\nIt wasn’t long after he came home the paintings started. The first was when I came home from parent-teacher conferences. When I came home, Hank was sitting, staring with blank, red eyes at the living room wall. It’s what I expected. Ever since he came home, he seemed to have abandoned all interest in anything except that damn wall. Each morning he would wake up, I’d place him in his chair, and he’d wheel himself right to that spot and stare at it all day. I had long since given up hope he would interact with our children. \n\nWhat I *didn’t* expect was that he had dug out a spare can of blank paint from the garage and planted a huge, single black streak across the wall in the living room. He still had the brush in his hand when I came home. I was livid, but I didn’t fight it. I didn’t have enough energy for an argument, anyway. So I let him paint, and he became *obsessive*. Every time I walked into the room, I found a new black streak slashed onto the wall. \n\nI got him some rudimentary supplies. A few canvases, an easel, and a basic set of paints, which deviated his attention from our walls. He never stopped painting. I couldn’t even convince him to sleep, so I gave up on that, too. All day, all night, sitting in the living room, painting away. \n\nThe scenes were nonsense at first — streaks of random color splattered across various canvases to match our wall — until a month ago. Overnight, his skill level skyrocketed. He went from broad, shaky strokes of color made by unsteady hands to intricate pieces full of detailed, beautiful designs worthy of Rembrandt. And they evoked genuine emotion from me. The figures in the painting were so real, so encapsulating. And their *faces*. Each one filled with pain. I couldn’t look away. \n\nAnd Hank didn’t even seem to care. The moment he would finish one, he would discard it and start on another. I had no idea Hank had this in him. He had never expressed interest in anything artistic before. It was hard enough getting him to go to the movies with me, yet alone a museum. It scared me. Did I know my husband at all?\n\nA few weeks ago, his paintings changed. They became personal. Pictures of our children eating, or playing, or me lounging in the living room reading a book with my leg draped over the edge of the couch. It was nice. At least Hank had remembered my existence.\n\nOne morning, I woke up to see he had painted a scene where Jason, my oldest, hit his first home run. Charming, but optimistic. Jason is a pretty scrawny kid, and while he loved the sport, he hadn’t even got a hit all season. \n\nYet the next week, sure enough, Jason hit a home run right over the left field fence. The ping rang out so loud it echoed against the cement stadium walls behind me. I don’t think it was until Jason rounded third that I remembered to cheer. What I didn’t forget was Hank’s painting. I wanted to chalk it up to coincidence. It wasn’t impossible. But when I checked the painting later that night, the ball in the painting was right over the left field fence. The coincidences piled up.\n\nIt went on like for a while. His paintings would predict all sorts of mundane things. The vacuum cleaner smoking from breaking, the dog chewing one of Hank’s old shoes, even the meals I was planning to cook. That one bothered me a little. I wondered if I was choosing to cook those things because of the paintings. Without fail, every scene, down to each detail, would happen a few days later. It was remarkable. Frightening. Unbelievable. I had even come to grow *excited* about the paintings, to see what lies in my future.\n\nThis morning I woke up to a different image. A darker image. It was a picture of me. I’m wearing the same yellow dress with flowers on it I put on before I even came down the stairs. A charming coincidence until I realized he painted me covered in blood, running a knife across my paralyzed husband’s throat with my two children dead on the [floor.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldArchitect/comments/yv369y/thanks_for_being_here/)",

        "text": "I’ve always had a deep connection to nature that only grew through the years. During my last two years of high school, most of my friends moved out of state so I started spending more and more time with the trees and less time with other people. Even to the point that, after spending a semester in a hot, crowded dorm, I decided college wasn’t for me and dropped out. My parents were happy enough to see me but I could still feel their discomfort with my educational decisions. I don’t blame them. “It just felt wrong” is hardly the most well thought out or valid of arguments but it was all I had to offer them at the time. I knew it wasn’t enough, so I left. I quickly packed my bags, threw them in my car, and headed north with no particular destination in mind.\n\nAfter several hours on the road, the highway I was on narrowed and turned to dirt while the trees standing silent sentinel along its meandering path got taller and darker. I drove slowly with the windows down, both to take in the incredible sights and to avoid careening off this dirt track clinging so desperately to the mountain. Once I rolled down my windows, I turned off my music. It felt out of place in the peaceful environment. My eyelids were getting heavier, the sun having long disappeared beneath the horizon, so I pulled off onto a little patch of dirt on the side of the road. I started getting ready to sleep but when I looked out into the trees I once again felt their call, so I left.\n\nWalking from the car, the silence was so potent it sucked the air from my lungs, this silence was ancient and sacred. I felt breaking it with any significant noise would be a great sin against the forces of Nature. A gust of wind noiselessly made its way through the trees, stirring the lowest branches and tossing my hair in my face. On the wings of the silent wind, I heard a sound so soft and natural it could perhaps only be heard because of the unnatural absence of background noise. It drew my attention to one particular *tree* a couple hundred feet from the road.\n\nAll the trees were dancing to the silent rhythm of the wind, all except one. This one danced offbeat and irregularly to no particular rhythm. It seemed as if each branch had a mind of its own, every bough twisted and writhed like an unfortunate worm on a fisherman's hook, the wood bending impossibly. The noise then seemed to form words in a language so old it had not been uttered for centuries at least, yet I understood. They told me they lived in the silent spaces of the world, where their words could be heard. Once the world was full of silent spaces, spaces where animals and man alike instinctively knew no noise above a whisper was permitted, but humans had lost touch with their instincts, only some being able to feel the unspoken rules that govern all. I fell to my knees in silent reverence for the gods that once were, and will be again. They have a plan, they said, we will return the world to how it once was, when the gods reigned and silence owned large swaths of land.\n\nThe hum of a motor accompanied by the sound of tires tearing up moist dirt ripped me from my state of pleasant reverence. I inhaled sharply and looked up to notice the first faint glow that changes the sky from black to dark blue before dawn warms the air and brings the sun. I returned to the road to get a glimpse of our invader, but when he saw me he quickly pulled over and got out of his car.\n\n“Hey man are you alright?” He called while approaching. His voice cut through the air, shocking me into stunned silence for a second.\n\n“Yeah I’m fine” I whispered, my voice seeming no less strange in the environment. “My car is over there, just keep driving.”\n\n“Dude you’re covered in dirt, your knees are clearly bleeding and you’re shivering violently. I can’t just leave you here, I’ll call for help.” I knew I couldn’t let him call for help lest more people invade our sanctuary, our church. \n\n“Alright I’ll go with you, but can I please show you something first?” He was clearly skeptical, but given that he seemed to have a good 100lbs on me, he probably thought I wasn’t much of a threat and so he nodded his head and followed where I beckoned. He so clearly wanted to help and seemed like a good guy so I thought I would induct him into my newfound religion and have him help with the mission assigned by *them*. When we finally reached the *tree* I grabbed him by the shoulder and pointed, hoping he would grasp all that I did. He shot me a puzzled look so in a whisper as quiet as I could manage I said “This is our connection to the gods.”\n\n“Alright I’m getting you help.” he cried in a voice far too loud to be tolerated. I knew immediately that this transgression would need to be punished. He quickly turned towards the road and made to return, in his haste stepping on leaves and branches, increasing his sins and sealing his fate. Given his determination to get back, he didn’t hear me pick up the branch, or close the gap between us. He gave a soft grunt when the wood connected with the base of his skull and fell silent at last, ceasing his transgressions. \n\nI dragged the body of the offender back to the base to the base of the *tree*, it just felt right, and once his skin touched the bark, the tree reacted. Almost instantly, roots broke the damp soil and coiled around what was once a human being. Pencil-thin roots carved into his body by the hundreds, tunneling in and out and back in again, giving his flesh the appearance of a very wormy apple or wood afflicted by termites. Within minutes, the fresh corpse was desecrated and nearly mummified, bringing a smile to my lips as I felt my connection to the gods increase.\n\nThe voices started back up with renewed vigor and my mission was made clear to me.\n\nThe next one needs to be alive.",

        "text": "**There’s Something in the Darkness and It Wants Me to Join It** \n\nI first encountered it when I was a teenager, probably 16 or 17, as I was sleeping on a school night. It was 3 o’clock on the dot when I glanced at the time on my watch, rubbing the tiredness from my eyes after waking to the sound of something in my room. Being young, I was a little apprehensive about looking around my room in complete darkness, my blackout curtains preventing any moonlight from coming in and the soft glow that usually came from my idle computer screen was predictably absent. I heard the noise again, a gentle wispy whistling like how wind sounds when it travels through a narrow opening, but loud enough that it sounded more like quiet whispering. The very thought that someone or something was in my room whispering, even if it was just the wind sent shivers down my spine and I dare not move a muscle. I laid there in the bed for what seemed like a century just listening, waiting, wanting to see if what I was hearing was indeed the wind or if it was something far worse than that. \n\nIt wasn’t until the sound became louder that I began to realize that it couldn’t have been the wind, the only place it would’ve been coming from was my window and the curtains were as still as death. I then chanced looking around from my supine position and could only see one of the two far corners in my room, the other being blocked by my desk in my field of view. I decided to lift my head slightly to get a better angle but immediately regretted my decision when I caught a glimpse of something just beyond the wall of my desk. I flew back into a flat position, instinctively trying to conceal my location though such a thing would be fruitless seeing as I had already moved around so much. I wasn’t sure what I had seen, it was darker than the darkness of my room and the black of the things around it, but again, I only witnessed it momentarily.  \n\nI inhaled deeply, weighing the possibility of it being an animal that may have somehow breached the window or a person that broke in, something that was causing such a strange noise. I made another decision, I thought to myself that if it was an animal, the only way it’ll leave is if I make it, it’s probably terrified or hurt, coming through a window. But, if it’s a person, sitting and waiting for them to attack me in some way is a kind of crappy way to die, so I have to do something, I have to confront it. So, swallowing hard and taking in another breath beforehand, I slowly rose from the bed and peered past my desk towards the corner to try and see if I could discern a figure of some kind. \n\nWhat I saw still puzzles me to this day. It was like a dark, black, misty substance in the corner of the room, tucked behind and beside two small crates that sat adjacent to it. It was the deepest black color I had ever seen in my life, like looking straight into the void. There were swirls of smoky wisps coming from it and fading into the air and as I stared at it, brows furrowed and eyes wide, I could hear the whispering coming directly from it.  \n\nMy curiosity had gotten the better of me and I was good and ready to get up and go investigate, just like the idiot from every horror movie ever. But something held me in place, although only momentarily because, before I could realize what I was doing, I was half across the room only a few feet from the darkened corner. It was as if my mind wasn’t my own for a few seconds, I was just in my bed, but now I was a short distance from some spooky thing in my room. I moved again without thinking as the whispering continued, its volume fluctuating as I took one, then two steps toward it. A misty appendage stretched out from the collection of darkness and extended out to me, the sound from the whispering becoming so loud, I was sure it was going to wake up the others in my house. I pushed my own hand forward to the wispy limb and let its tendrils wrap around my fingers, palm, and wrist. I could hear the whispers so loud in my ears, they were starting to ring as the smokiness moved up my arm and over my elbow. I couldn’t move, not that I wanted to, the feeling of it wasn’t obscene in any way and the longer I held onto it, or it held onto me, rather, I started to see a blinding white light come into view. I could see it begin to cloud my vision and, although it was a little unsettling for my eyes to suddenly to be flooded with light, the appearance of it was calm and comforting, loving even. I liked it. \n\nIt started to feel like I was slipping out of existence, like I was floating, not in my own body. The light overcame me, and I was swimming in my own head, trying to get ahold of something around me but I was both flying and falling in the open air. It felt like this was happening for hours, like I was moving through untouched space for so long, but then it ended with a soft squeak, a gentle light, and a familiar voice. \n\n“Whatcha doin’?” The voice of my mother who peeked in to check in on me sounded from behind me in the direction of the door. I snapped my head around and, with my arm still outstretched, gave her a look that must have worried her, because she further stepped into my room and flipped on my lights. “Natalie? You alright?” She asked, the usual motherly worry present in her words. \n\nI looked at her for a moment but remembered what was just happening. I whipped my head back to the corner but there was nothing there, not a single ounce of evidence anything had even been there in the first place. My brows knitted together once more at the sight of this, the loss of such an inviting, comforting warmth tugging at me. \n\n“Natalie?” Her equally comforting voice pulled me away from where I was standing and as I walked towards her, I lowered my arm and gave her an awkward, brief smile. \n\n“I’m fine.” I finally spoke, moving to get back in bed and cover up. “Just sleepwalking, I guess.”  \n\n“You’ve never done that before.” My mom put her hands on her hips and watched as I tucked myself in, stepping back towards the doorway to leave while she did so. \n\n“First time for everything.” I joked; the blanket I was previously wrapped in now snuggly draped over my figure again. \n\n“Hm. Well, get some sleep, you’ve got school in the morning, and I don’t want you complaining that you’re tired.” She closed my door after turning out my lights again, leaving me in darkness once more.  \n\nOnce she left, I sat back up, looking to the corner in my room to see if I could see the black mass, but there was nothing but the wall in the place where the misty apparition had been. I watched the area for a few minutes, possibly hoping to see something happen, but nothing ever did show up. I sighed in defeat and laid my head back onto my pillow, letting sleep take me. \n\nThe last few hours of sleep I had before the morning woke me were...remarkable. I dreamt of the most terribly wonderful and dreadful things. The warm light came back to me, a vast unending comfort, like what you would expect from your mother’s bosom as you are held tightly just after birth. I felt calm and protected and let the feeling of floating in mid-air take over me, but it did not last. I was suddenly thrust into darkness, a void much like the blackness of the ghostly figure I witnessed only for it then to ripple into visions of devastation and destruction all around me. Natural disasters, floods, landslides, earthquakes, the earth literally splitting like a ripe melon and swallowing massive skyscrapers and small cottages alike; the sky falling into the earth, meteors and asteroids plummeting into massive bodies of water and burning them up, decimating the land around them; living creatures, big and small, struck with famine and disease, collapsing one-by-one at the feet of their caretakers; and finally, anything and everything green shriveling up to brown mush and spoiling down to their very roots, trees, grass, corn, wheat, beans, everything a farmer planted in his lot fizzled away in the wind as if it was made of nothing but dust itself. \n\nThen, after the tormenting images flashed in front of me over and over, the sound of whispering flooded in, and the scene around me turned to white again. Sadly, it too did not last. The white faded out and I was abruptly standing on the shore of a large beach, the waves crashing in slowly, but as I peered into the distance, I could see a terrible, powerful storm was approaching. I heard the whispering again, louder this time and it drew my attention to just behind me. Upon turning around, I was greeted with the sight of a lifetime\n\nThere stood an at least 100-foot tall, crimson-colored dragon. Now, this isn’t an unusual sight for a dream, dragons happen often in dreams. But this seemed vastly different, in many, many ways. The deep redness of its scales shimmered in the sunlight, the commanding, domineering presence in which the creature held without me yet seeing its face sent waves of goosebumps from the top of my head all the way down to my toes. I could only gape at the scene before me. I took several panicked steps back and realized this thing was no ordinary dragon, it held seven colossal, crowned heads and ten equally enormous, sharp horns. I swallowed hard and just as I was about to say something, it seemed the massive monster caught sight of me in some of its many eyes and started to lower one of its many heads. As it got closer and closer to me, the whispering got so intense, I could barely stand it, it was as if it was coming from the dragon itself. The beast’s large head was only feet from mine now and it opened its mouth like it was about to speak but, just before it spoke, or before anything happened, everything suddenly evaporated and faded into the darkness that, without warning, enveloped me. Then I heard it. Ringing. First it was a quiet humming but soon became a loud chirping and it was driving the very sanity from me. Before I tore my hair out, I finally woke up and realized it was my alarm clock on my phone, ringing to wake me up for school the next day. \n\nFor the next few hours, I was on auto pilot as usual, getting dressed, eating breakfast, and getting to school. The day dragged on as if it was any other day, like I didn’t just have some sort of ethereal experience in a dream the night before. It was odd, the dream, and I was thinking of it the whole day, that is...until what happened after lunch. \n\nThe cafeteria had just let my group out and everyone was headed to their respective classes, me included. But then I passed an area partially blocked off by a ‘WET FLOOR’ sign and I spotted the janitor, a nice, older man of some Spanish descent, I believe. When I noticed him, he was mopping up a mess another student had made, likely a spill from the previous lunch groups, but nothing out of the ordinary, his hunched over posture tugging his collar forward and revealing the nicotine patch on his neck. He was minding his own business doing janitor stuff. I started to lag behind the larger group of people as the students began to dissipate and I stopped to wave at the man, he was a generally friendly person and I was just being friendly back. When I did this though, he looked up and me and an expression of pure horror grew upon his face, like he’d seen a monster of ancient times ready to rip off his face and tear a new hole into his body.  \n\n“Ay Dios mio...” I heard him whisper as he made the sign of the cross over his chest and pull a cross that was tucked into the folds of his collar out to kiss it.  \n\nIt unnerved me and I gave him a puzzled look, starting to walk away from him, but as I turned my back and began to take a few steps I heard a loud splashing sound. I snapped my head around to look at what the source was but found a horrifying occurrence instead. The janitor was pulling out a lighter and sparked it in his hand. \n\n“Dios nos salve...” The man held it to his clothes and before I could react, he burst into flames, his clothes, hair, shoes, everything...one big fireball. I must’ve screamed at the top of my lungs at the sight of it, but it seemed like it took people forever to respond. \n\nAfter everything was said and done, the man had died from the smoke inhalation, at least that’s what I heard. They couldn’t put him out fast enough because of whatever he poured on himself as an accelerant, he just kept burning. People kept saying he was one big mess after they finally did put him out, just a mass of flesh and blood. All I remember is seeing him go up in flames and I kinda blocked out what happened immediately after. The cops sat me down a few days later and asked me if he said anything to me, the cameras showing me waving to him but there's no audio. They wanted to know if he threatened me or spoke any words at all, or if maybe I said something to him, maybe told him to do it or something like that. No words were ever spoken between us, is what I told them. I didn’t really understand what was happening or why the guy did it. What I do remember is that the moment I heard the splashing of whatever he used to set himself on fire, I heard that whispering again, quiet but still audible.  \n\nFor a while I didn’t believe these things had anything to do with each other, the strange dream and the janitor, even with the whispering and the looks the man gave me just before he died. Until it happened again.",

It’s the same body from the day before, the young man who was struck down in his prime. \n\n“Today we’ll be focusing on head and neck anatomy...” Dr. Wallace says, but I’m not paying attention.\n\nLynn reaches for the mask that covers the corpse’s features and begins to remove it. I’m about to see the face of the dead man we’ve carved up in the name of higher education. To my horror, the visage staring back at me is all too familiar. \n\n*I’m looking at Josh.* \n\nHis skin is a darkened mass of burnt tissue but those haunted eyes belong to my brother. It gets worse as the charred death mask turns toward me. I cry out and recoil, dropping the surgical blade. It clatters to floor of the classroom, echoing.\n\nPanic explodes in my chest and I’m unable to catch my breath. A hand touches my shoulder. It’s Wallace, our professor. A concerned frown furrows his brows. “Are you okay, son?”\n\nGood question. If the experiences of the last few days are any indicator, the answer is a resounding no. My eyes drift back to the corpse. The lifeless features are those of a stranger. The stares of Lynn and the other students are mortifying. Their expressions range from pity to surprise to dark amusement. \n\nI trade a quick glance with Lynn. I spot the love and concern in her gaze, and I feel like a shit for my behavior last night. I inhale sharply and eye Dr. Wallace.\n\n“Take the afternoon off,” he says. “It happens to the best of us.”\n\nI nod and leave the anatomy classroom. Lynn’s worried gaze follows me all the way. She wants to come after me, but I wave her off.\n\n*Everything’s okay, babe.*\n\nI’m lying.\n\nI head to the cafeteria and order a coffee while I wait for the class to let out. I sip the bitter brew, which goes down like a cup of ashes. \n\n*Or like a kiss from Akasha.*\n\nForty minutes later, Lynn joins me.\n\n“What happened?” she asks.\n\nGood question. *What did happen?* \n\n“I think I need to get some rest. Too many nights of burning the midnight oil. It’s starting to catch up to me.” \n\nLynn studies me with a doubtful expression, not quite convinced.\n\n“You sure you’re okay?”\n\n“I’m fine.”\n\n“Let’s do something fun tonight,” she says. “How about we plan a real date?”\n\n“Sounds like a great idea.”\n\nIt’s been way too long since we’ve gone out.\n\n“I’ll come up with something,“ Lynn says. “Be ready by eight.”\n\nI relax. Despite a crazy study schedule that doesn’t leave much room for romantic outings, Lynn is going to carve out a window of time. Because she knows we need it. \n\nGod, I love this girl.\n\nThe plan for the rest of the day is simple. I’m going to study my ass off. If I’m going to have fun tonight, I must maintain my focus and clear some work off my plate. I head to the library and find a quiet corner where the world can forget I exist. A place where knowledge and science dominate and the twisted soap opera of my life will seem small and insignificant.  \n\nFor the first two hours I make excellent progress. A quiz is coming up in my biology class, and I want to be prepared. My grade-point average is solid, if not spectacular. I flunk one test and it could jeopardize my academic future. I can’t slack off or use tragedy as an excuse for failure.\n\nMy cell phone chimes. One glance at it and the events of the last day catch up with me. Akasha is direct messaging me again.\n\nShit, I totally forgot to delete the Tinder app on my phone. \n\n“*What are you up to?”*\n\nI eye the message, phrased innocently enough. I thought that after what happened last night, we’d be done. I guess I was wrong. \n\nI break down and respond to this latest communication. \n\nMe: “*Doing homework.”*\n\nAkasha: “*Need any help?”*\n\nCute response, and I almost smile. Akasha waits for a beat before sending the next message.\n\n“*When can I see you again?”*\n\nI can no longer sugarcoat this. Better to be honest and direct. \n\nI type: “*I don't think that would be a good idea. I told you, I have a girlfriend.”*\n\n*“Where was your girlfriend when* *you made out with me last night?”*\n\nAkasha logs off, and I stare at my cell in silence. \n\nOutside it’s snowing again. White clumps of melting ice drift down the glass pane, and I’m glad that I’m indoors. I turn off my phone and plan to get some work done.\n\nAround five I call it quits and brave the weather. I leave the library and catch the F-train back into Queens. It takes another forty minutes to arrive in Briarwood, but I get lucky and manage to snag a seat. I continue to study my flash cards while the train rattles its way through the city.\n\nI switch on my phone again and am relieved to not find any messages from Akasha. I check in with Lynn and she tells me to meet her at one of her favorite hole-in-wall Thai places in Queens. We’re going to dodge the Manhattan commute and keep things local tonight. I can only stomach one trip into the city per day, especially during the winter months. Rain is coming down in raw, cold sheets as I emerge from the subway station. I make a mad dash for my apartment building which is only a block away from the station. It’s impossible to not get wet, even though I’m moving pretty fast. \n\nWhen I reach the entrance, I go stock-still. \n\nSomeone is waiting for me below the front awning. \n\n*Akasha.* \n\nHer dress is soaked and pasted to her beautiful figure, leaving little to the imagination. There’s a trace of anger in my voice as I address her. “What the hell are you doing here?”\n\nA sob escapes from Akasha's throat, and I realize tears are mixing with the melted snow on her face. She is hugging herself and shaking in the icy downpour. A pitiful sight.\n\nSeeing her vulnerable like that dampens my anger, and I feel like a shit for going off on her. I pop the door open and say, “You better come in before you catch pneumonia.”\n\nShe faces me from behind a curtain of cold tears and nods. I hold the door open for her, and she brushes past, her wet skin grazing mine. \n\nThe contact is electric. Alarm bells go off inside my head, but I choose to ignore them.\n\nTen minutes later, Akasha sits in my kitchen, a towel wrapped around her soaked shoulders. A teakettle heats on the stove, and I’m about to make some tea for us. \n\nI eye Akasha with trepidation as I notice the curves outlined under the wet material of her clothes. For a second, Akasha’s eyes fix on me, catching me in the act. But from the way she smiles, it seems she doesn’t mind me checking her out.\n\n“I like your place,” she says.\n\n“Thanks.”\n\n“You live with a roommate?”\n\nI nod, perhaps a little too quickly. “Yeah.\n\n“Where is he?”\n\n“Cyrus is still at work.” \n\n“I guess there's no one here to interrupt us.”\n\n“There's nothing to interrupt.”\n\nAkasha rises and the towel drops to the floor. I can see the outline of her breasts under her wet T-shirt and this confirms what I’ve suspected since I first saw her outside my building – she’s not wearing a bra. \n\n“I wonder what Lynn would think if she found me here?” \n\nThere’s an edge in my voice as I respond. “How do you know my girlfriend's name?” \n\n“Relax. She doesn't know about us.”\n\n“What are you talking about? There’s no ‘us’ to know about.”\n\n“You could've fooled me the other night. I loved the way you kissed me.”\n\nShe takes another step toward me. The water makes her clothes cling to her shapely figure in a primal way. This is getting out of hand. \n\n“What are you doing?”\n\n“What do you want me to do?”\n\nMere inches separate us. It would be so easy to reach out, tear those clothes off and take her right here and now. I know she wants me to, but I can’t do this to Lynn. \n\nAkasha presses her body into mine. “I know you feel the same way,” she says. “I can see it in your eyes. Why fight it?”\n\nWhy? Because there’s an amazing gal out there who cares about me. And I don’t want to break her heart. I can’t risk my relationship for the sake of a fleeting experience with a hot but emotionally unbalanced girl.  \n\nCyrus’ voice echoes in my head. *Don’t stick your dick in crazy.*\n\nI grow resolute. I’m not going to succumb to temptation. \n\n“Listen, you better leave. If you need me to call you a cab, I will.”\n\nI see the stunned look on Akasha’s face and I’m worried. Is this what happened with Josh? Did he push her away after he realized she was bad news? Did he pay the ultimate price for his rejection?\n\n“Who do you think I am?” There’s an undertone of menace in her voice. “Someone you can just kick out once you're done with me?“ \n\nHer gaze is distant and it feels like she is reliving some other past, talking about another guy, another relationship. How often has this been her story? One-night stands that started hot and heavy but ended with her being shown the door and ghosted? \n\nThat does it. I snap. My anger is fueled by fear. Something is wrong with this girl, and I can’t stop thinking about Josh’s dying gasp and the terror in his eyes as he mouthed his final message – her name. \n\nThe reason I contacted Akasha has gotten lost in the course of this seductive game, but I won’t lose sight of it again. “I tried to be a nice guy, but you don't seem to get it. I have a girlfriend. I don't know what your problem is, but I want you out of here. Now.”\n\nHer eyes narrow into slits and become intense, blazing with emotion. Beads of perspiration bloom on my face. The heat in the apartment appears to be rising.\n\nThen the moment passes and the same vulnerability I saw earlier, in the rain, creeps back into her face. \n\n“Don't you like me, Mark? Just a little?”\n\nBefore I can come up with the proper response, the fire alarm goes off. The sound is sharp and shrill. I search the kitchen for a sign of smoke or anything else that could have set off the alarm. I don’t detect any visible cause. \n\nI rush over to the alarm. Seeing no other choice, I pop out the battery. The noise dies down. \n\nI whirl back to Akasha...\n\nBut she is gone. It’s a small apartment so it doesn’t take long to be sure she isn’t hiding somewhere. \n\nI open the front door and poke my head out to peer down the now empty hallway. There is no sign of Akasha.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe Thai restaurant Lynn picked is a hole-in-the-wall in the true sense of the word. The décor is forgettable and the place is cramped and crowded. Small individual tables are so close together we might as well be dining at a communal table. I like meeting new folks, but not while I’m on a date with my girl. But the food makes up for the inconvenience. The joint is a fave among hipsters, artists, musicians and students – in other words, poor people like ourselves who appreciate delectable chow at bargain prices.\n\nLynn is enjoying her dinner and babbling away about her day. She suddenly pauses.\n\n“You haven't heard a word I said.”\n\nI offer her a guilty-as-charged smile.\n\n“I'm sorry, babe. I'm not myself today.”\n\n“Don't worry about it. I can't imagine how hard this must be. I was hoping a night out might get your mind off what happened...”\n\n“And it did,” I say perhaps a little too quickly. “Thanks again, honey.”\n\nI take Lynn’s hand and am leaning forward to kiss her when the candle on our table lights by itself. There’s a flare of light from the other tables as their candles flicker to life in unison.\n\nMy perplexed gaze roves around the restaurant, and that’s when I spot Akasha standing at the entrance. Her face is a blank slate, but the jealousy in her unblinking eyes is all too clear.\n\nI jump to my feet. Lynn stares at me, startled.\n\n“What's wrong?”\n\nI don’t offer an answer but instead turn away from the table. This must end now. With quick strides I cross the restaurant and close in on Akasha.\n\nShe spins and rushes toward a nearby doorway. \n\nI pick up the pace. \n\nSo does Akasha.\n\nMoments later, she vanishes through the door. \n\nI’m right behind her.\n\nI burst through the door and find myself in a dank hallway. At the far end, Akasha disappears through another door into the ladies’ room.\n\n“Akasha... Wait!”\n\nI reach the door, hesitate for a second and overcome my social conditioning to enter. \n\n“Akasha...”\n\nA young woman, hair dyed blue, leans over the wash-basin. Working on her makeup, she peers up at me with visible irritation and drops her black lipstick. It rolls on the floor.\n\n“Dude, what are you doing here?”    \n\nI attempt a weak apology. \n\nThe disconcerted punk chick doesn't stick around for an explanation and rushes out of the bathroom. She doesn't even bother to scoop up her lipstick. \n\nI take a deep breath and scan the room. No windows or other exits. *Akasha must still be in here.*\n\nMy attention shifts to the two stalls and I listen intently. The only sound is my breathing.\n\n“Akasha?”\n\nNo response. \n\n*Surprise, surprise.* \n\nI approach the first stall. It turns out to be empty.\n\nI pause. My face is coated in perspiration. It’s not just from my little sprint. Did someone crank up the heater in here? I wipe the sweat from my face and turn to the second stall. \n\n*Is Akasha waiting* *behind the door?*\n\n“Akasha, I know you're in there...”\n\nStill no answer. *Okay, keep playing this game if you must.*\n\nI push the door and it swings open, revealing… another empty stall.\n\nI catch my dumbfounded reflection in the bathroom mirror. *Where did Akasha go?*\n\nI comb the room but there’s no explanation. Now I’m spooked. \n\nDefeated, I’m about to retreat before some other female enters the washroom when my eyes fall on the exit. A message has been scrawled on the door with the same lipstick the punk-lady dropped a minute earlier.\n\nIt reads: “*WHY WERE YOU MAKING OUT WITH THAT WHORE?”*\n\nI swallow hard, mouth dry with fear.\n\nIs Akasha threatening to go after Lynn? \n\nI embarked on this adventure with Akasha for the right reasons. \n\nI wanted to solve my brother’s untimely passing.\n\nBut I’m way in over my head at this point.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI pull up to Lynn's apartment building and kill the engine. Sleet pelts the windshield and streams down the glass. For a moment we just sit there in silence. \n\n“What happened back there at the restaurant? Who were you running after?”\n\n“I thought I saw someone I know.”\n\nLynn’s brows furrow into a puzzled expression. She’s not buying my story.\n\n“I've never seen you act like that before.”\n\nAn awkward beat. The new distance between us is palpable.\n\nI can tell Lynn wants to probe further but backs down. She knows me well enough not to push me into a corner. \n\n“You sure you don't want to stay over?” Lynn asks, changing the subject. \n\n“Got to get up early tomorrow and cram for that anatomy quiz.” \n\nLynn seems to understand this but is unable to hide her disappointment. She verbalizes what has been eating away at her for the last few days. “Everything is cool between us, right?”\n\n“Of course,“ I say automatically.\n\nLynn doesn’t seem convinced. \n\n“Mark, I'm here for you if you need me.”\n\n“I know.”\n\nAnother beat. We hug.\n\n“You sure you don't want to spend the night? I want to be with you.”\n\n“I’m with you. Just trying to avoid all distractions before the quiz tomorrow.”\n\n*Maybe you should try avoiding Akasha?*\n\n“You better get an A, Dr. Valentine.” \n\nShe plants a quick peck on my cheek, gets out of my car and walks up to her apartment building. I stay until I’m convinced she’s safely inside.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nIt’s past eleven when I park the Honda near my Briarwood pad. I get lucky and find a spot a few feet from the main entrance. My life is a bit of an emotional rollercoaster at the moment, but it seems my parking karma remains solid. \n\nI approach my place and almost expect to find Akasha waiting for me again but the front lobby is deserted. \n\nAs soon as I’m in my apartment, I slam a Red Bull and attack the books. Unfortunately, the energy drink only buys me thirty minutes before my concentration wavers and my eyes grow heavy. I decide to catch a power nap. I allow myself only thirty minutes. Setting an alarm on my phone, I  close my eyes. \n\nWhen I open them again, a quick glimpse at the clock reveals it’s 4 a.m. I’ve been out for four hours. So much for the alarm! \n\nI suddenly sense shadowy movement in the darkness and conclude I’m not alone. I lie on my bed, senses alert, heart thrumming in my chest, uncertain what to do next. A sound from the corner of the room draws my attention. \n\nI bolt upright, adrenaline surging. Wide-awake now. My eyes bore into the dark, and I make out Akasha looming at the foot of the bed, gazing down at me.\n\n“*Why don't you like me?”*\n\nShe is crying now. Tears slide down her cheeks and hit the floor in what seems like slow motion. They ignite like napalm upon contact. In a sudden flash, I find myself surrounded by a ring of fire. The flames flicker hungrily.\n\nI’m shocked to discover that my body is paralyzed as the roaring inferno tightens around me. I want to scream for help, but solely manage a croak. This is what must have happened to Josh. \n\nAnd it’s about to happen to me. \n\nMy prediction comes true a beat later as the fire engulfs the bedspread. Within seconds the pillows, comforters and sheets are engulfed in roaring flames.\n\nAs the blaze devours my flesh, I let out a piercing scream...\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nMy eyes snap open and the scream becomes a gasp for air as I jerk awake. I’m covered in sweat, my T-shirt sticking to me like a second skin. My eyes tick back and forth, scanning the room. \n\nThere’s no fire. \n\n*No sign of Akasha.*\n\nI shake off the last vestiges of sleep, and it all sinks in. It was just a nightmare. \n\nI take a deep breath, wishing I was at Lynn’s place where I could roll over and cling to the reassuring physicality of another human being. But the bed, like the room, is empty. \n\nIt’s barely five o’clock. Great. I have a quiz in a few hours. Might as well just stay up and hit the books. \n\nI climb out of bed and stagger toward my bathroom. I flick on the light and squint under the harsh glare. I lean over the sink to splash water on my face. My body is trembling, still affected by the horror of the dream. \n\nI peer up at my reflection and freeze.\n\nThe mirror reveals a disturbing sight. The blackened outline of a hand’s imprint has burned itself into the doorjamb behind me.\n\nI turn and inspect the handprint. The charred wood is still hot to the touch and leaves black ashen marks on my fingertips. A wave of dread washes over me and this time I know it’s not a dream.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nDaylight streams into my bedroom, a sharp reminder that I overslept. My ambitious plan to get some studying done in the early hours of the morning never materialized. Despite my experience in the bathroom, I managed to fall asleep again. A soon as my head hit the pillow, I was out cold. Maybe the world has become too much to handle. Sleep offers a much-needed refuge from the horror. \n\nNow that I’m awake, reality comes crashing down on me with a vengeance. Besides this whole Akasha weirdness, quizzes are coming up and papers are due. I’m going to have to catch up somehow. \n\nI get up and stagger to my desk. I try to resist looking at my phone but fail miserably. I let out a sigh of relief when I find no new direct messages from Akasha. A part of me prays I never hear from her again. \n\nMy attention shifts to the latest new stories, hoping the world’s problems will distract me from my own. \n\nBad move. \n\nI almost immediately come across a local news story that chills me to the bone. A young black man was found burnt to a crisp in his car right outside the Starbucks where I met Akasha. I grip my desk, and I can almost feel my heart hammering against my rip cage.   \nWeird coincidence or did Akasha find a new victim?\n\nAnd this leads to another terrifying thought.\n\nPerhaps John and Steve weren’t the first victims. Perhaps there are others. \n\nI tentatively open my Google search window.\n\nI type \"FIRE ACCIDENTS\" into the search field. \n\n\"*120O ARTICLES FOUND.\"* All kinds of accidents all across the country. \n\nThis won’t work. I decide to modify my search. I add two words into the search box. *\"YOUNG MEN.”* This still produces too many results. Then I further narrow it down by specifying the geographic area. I input Astoria Queens and this brings the number down to twenty-two. Still shockingly high but somewhat more manageable.\n\nI spend the next few hours reading through one story after another. Freak accident after another. Some of the young men perished in home fires, some in fiery car accidents. All of them died with a ten mile radius. I don’t want to accept it but the grisly news stories speak for themselves.\n\nAfter a few hours of this, I’m ready to call it quits. Each story is nearly identical to the last. The only differences are the changing pictures of the dead and slight variations in the facts of the case. Twenty-four men have died in unexplainable fires over the course of the last ten months. \n\n*She got you all*, I think.\n\nAnd I know who might be next in line.\n\nTo save myself, I need to find out more about Akasha. \n\nMy eyes turn to one of the news stories open on my screen. The victim in question is Robert May, a junior CPA fresh out of college. Young kid, his whole life ahead of him. Just like the rest of the dead men. But something is different about Robert’s tragedy. Something about his story stands out. His girlfriend was with him when the fire broke out. Jennifer Heitz sustained third degree burns all over her body, but she's still alive.\n\nThere's a survivor.\n\n\\*\\*\\* \n\nWhite sneakers pad down a sterile corridor. A nurse escorts me down the institutional hallway of the NORELL BURN TRAUMA CENTER. The heat in the building forces me to unzip my jacket. \n\n“We keep the temperature inside the facility at eighty-five degrees,” the nurse explains. “Once the skin is compromised, burn victims are incapable of maintaining the necessary body temperature for internal organs to function properly.”\n\n“What are the survival rates?”\n\n“Thirty percent succumb to infection. If they can make it through the first sets of skin grafts, odds improve. Jennifer is one of our success stories. After six surgeries, she should be able to leave the center within a month or so.”\n\nWe round a corridor and reach Jennifer’s hospital room. The nurse nods, giving me the go-ahead to enter. I told them I was a college friend of Jennifer’s who heard about her tragedy. They agreed that seeing a friendly face would be good for her, but told me to be prepared. Jennifer’s terrible third-degree burns have drastically altered her appearance.  \n\nI wonder once again what I am doing here. How will Jennifer react to my visit? I wouldn’t be surprised if in the next few minutes a bunch of security officers descend on her room and drag me out of here. I hope Jennifer gives me enough time to plead my case before she sets the dogs on me. \n\nI push the grim vision aside and concentrate on the figure sitting in the corner. Facing the window, Jennifer wears an athletic hoodie with the hood up. From this angle, she makes me think of an urban monk. \n\n“Jennifer, you have a visitor. An old friend from college…”\n\n“I have no friends. Not anymore,” the woman in the chair says, without turning around. Outside, snowflakes flutter steadily. The nurse shoots me a “good luck, kid” look and leaves us alone. \n\nI’m unsure how to proceed. How do I bring up Akasha? I’m not a trained interrogator and me being here feels like a bad idea. Before I can say anything, Jennifer speaks. “It's funny. Everyone’s so excited that I'm about to leave this place, but I doubt the world is ready for me. Six surgeries later and my face is a cheap Halloween mask.”\n\n“I'm sorry.”\n\nStill without turning, she says, ”I don’t recognize your voice. Who are you?”\n\nI come clean – the truth shall set me free.\n\n“My name’s Mark. I need your help, Jennifer.”\n\nShe tilts her head toward me. Even though I steeled myself for this sight, I still have to stifle a gasp. The face inside the hoodie is an ugly tangle of knotted scars. I perused pictures of her from before the accident, and it’s heartbreaking to see her now. The fire leveled her nose and retracted her eyelids. Her former beauty slashed and burned away, she reminds me of a well-preserved mummy. \n\n“How could I possibly help you?” she asks, her lidless eyes staring out at me from the cratered face.\n\n“My brother died in a fire a few days ago. I don’t think it was an accident.”\n\nHer stare never wavers, her full attention fixed on me. This is my chance and I grab it.\n\n“I think someone murdered my brother. The same person who set the fire that killed your fiancé and nearly killed you.”\n\n“Akasha...” Jennifer says, and I realize I’ve come to the right place.  \n\n“Who is she?” I ask.\n\nThe question hangs there. Jennifer is withdrawing from me. She shifts her attention back to the window. On some level I’m grateful not to be looking at her face any longer, but our connection is crumbling. I make a final attempt to reach her.\n\n“Please, is there anything you can tell me about her?”\n\nAfter a long moment, Jennifer responds. “Do you have a girlfriend?”\n\nMy heavy silence answers her question.\n\n“Leave her before Akasha destroys you both.”\n\n“Who is she?”\n\nNo answer is forthcoming. Jennifer doesn’t stir. \n\n“Jennifer, please talk to me...”\n\nShe finally responds. Raspy words slip ominously from her destroyed lips with a chilling air of finality.\n\n“Love is like a flame. It burns you when it’s hot.”",

        "text": "Hi! I'm Jason, and I live in a smallish town on the eastern side of Texas in a town called \"RavensHood\". I know just about everyone and everything in this town, and I can't recall when news has ever slipped by me. I'm posting this as a recollection of all the weird or unexplainable things that have happened here, as no one else wants to.\n\nSo let's start. I'll start off with a story of a small Mexican Restaurant named \"Tacos de janes y francos\" or Jane and Franks tacos. The patrons of this place are usually tourists, or just people wanting a taco from anywhere other than taco bell. Tacos are one of the specialties of this place. You can combine and mix different ingredients to create a taco of your liking\nHowever if you went from around 6:30 am and called a specific waiter, and asked for \"Mystery\" around 15 minutes later you'd have a taco brought to you. This taco consisted of everything a taco would usually consist of and was normal until you ate the meat.\nIt would taste, well, off. The reason for this was unknown for the next 2-3 years and then one day, in late 2017, someone puked up the Mystery, claiming it was human meat. Apparently the guy was a surviver of a rather brutal plane crash who was forced to eat human meat to survive. An investigation was set up and, low and behold, it was human meat.\nObviously, the place shut down and Jane and Frank were arrested on the spot. I remember the first time I had a Mystery, and thinking about it now, makes me sick.\n\nAnyway onto the next story.\nAround 2018 and 2019 there was a series of mysterious disappearances of people who've lived in RavensHood for at least 5 years, which makes me wonder why I was never taken. Anyway rumors went around there was a cult in the woods to the South that worshipped some kind of monster. This turned out to be true. I had heard the rumor at school, and being stupid I went to the woods. What I saw there was, surprisingly nothing, but I couldn't stop hearing a sound like breathing from straight behind me. Then I heard yelling from a few yards behind me. I turn around and it's farmer Henson, but he's a story for another day. Anyway he tells me that I should come into town and get some takeout at the new place that sells teriyaki chicken. Now anyone who's anyone in this town knows damn well there's no place that sells teriyaki chicken.\nKnowing this, I figured he'd seen something an wanted to get me out without alerting whatever was nearby. When we got away from the woods he told me what he saw behind me. When he did, I pissed myself.\nHe had seen something that was supposed to never exist in the first place, a wendigo. And it was a fast one too, so fast I hadn't had time to get a glance at it when I turned around. \nLater that month the disappearing's stopped and nobody ever talked about again.\n\nNext up, something that actually still happens to this day was caused by this. We have a store called Ginger's half off's, where almost every item in the store is sold for half the price of everywhere else. I say almost because every knife, axe, and saw was actually double the price. The reason behind this is that everytime someone buys something like that, they end up dead by the very next week. Maybe it's haunted or something, but all I know is that only 6 people have bought something of that nature and survived. All of which descended from the towns founders. No one knows why, how, or whats doing this.\n\nI think that's all I'm gonna share for now. But I'll make sure to keep this updated, every now and then. But no promises. Till next few stories.",

        "text": "I could see exactly where I needed to go. That night was cold, the sticky after storm air clung to me like a wet rag, and the fog was starting to rise. Behind me, I could hear the unmistakable sound of feet pounding on the pavement, and the deep, winded breathing of a desperate charge. He was surprisingly fast, but I was faster and more desperate. He was an out of shape, overweight, middle-aged man, and I was none of those things.\n\nBy then, he had been chasing me for about a mile through rugged woods. I also doubted he could breathe very well through that modified pillowcase draped over his head. His eyes were probably bulging from exhaustion through the holes in the fabric. I hoped he would just keel over, dead from a massive heart attack. But luck wasn’t on my side yet.\n\nI sprinted across the two-lane road toward a community that I could see from that hill over the tree line below. My leggings were in tatters from foliage grabbing onto my clothes, my shoes had been long missing, and I had stripped my muddy socks off probably a mile ago. My bare feet were aching and probably bleeding from running across forest debris and gravel, but I persevered. I didn’t care about the pain. My life depended on escaping from this psychotic man.\n\nNo matter what, he wasn’t going to win.\n\nI was.\n\n\nHe had been driving for hours with me tied up in the trunk, but I was carefully sawing at the extension cords he used for rope with a pocketknife. The trunk was completely dark, so I had to navigate only by touch. The trunk had a pungent metallic odor that I realized was the smell of old, dried blood. There was also a small leak in the trunk, which happened to be dripping on my head, adding to the torture of this hell. The car was ancient, so it didn’t have an escape button or hatch from the trunk. After what seemed like hours, the car had suddenly come to a stop. \n\nI heard the door slam shut and then heard his feet crunching on gravel as he marched toward the rear. The trunk popped open to reveal dusk had come, and that the pillowcase psycho was back.\n\n“Well, hello, beautiful! I just had to stop to get one last look…”\n\nFrom hours of seething anger and the primal urge to survive, I leaped from the trunk, lunging for his face with that pocketknife. His eye popped like a grape -- exactly where I was aiming. Blood immediately began gushing from the wound. His face twisted in agony as he screamed a guttural roar of pain and fell to his knees.\n\nI thought about stabbing him again, or trying to beat the shit out of him, but last second, I decided he would probably win that battle. Every hour of jogging and running in the mornings had prepared me for this moment. Not knowing how much time that had given me, I sprinted for the woods.\n\nHe soon followed.\n\n\nHours later, here I was sprinting for an unknown town through a patch of dense patch of woods long before sunrise. It was nearly pitch black, except for what little moonlight was peeking between the clouds. Earlier that day, it had rained. Before all this chaos, I hadn’t even considered how the rain could be a curse.\n\nThe mud in this part of the woods was becoming thicker and deeper with every step. It soon became obvious that I had entered a swamp. Soon, I was up to my knees in water, then my waist. It had been a while since I’d seen or heard the man behind me. I hoped and I prayed that he had given up on his pursuit.\n\nThoughts began to form about what I would do when I finally made it to the town. Would I run to a house and bang on the front door, hoping that someone would answer? In the trunk, I discovered that he had taken my cell phone, my wallet, and my keys, but he hadn’t checked my jacket pocket, where he would’ve found that pocketknife. Now, it was my sole possession.\n\nI was swimming at this point. The water smelled putrid and dank, filling my nostrils with that gassy, unmistakable smell of a swamp. After calming myself and building up the nerve, I checked around again and did not see the man. He was gone. My spirits lifted, and I chuckled with glee.\n\n\t\n\nThat morning had started like any other. I’d wake up around sunrise, jog for a mile, shower, then I’d stop at Dunkin and get an iced coffee before going to work. But something went horribly wrong this time.\n\nAs I was jogging past a nearby park, I heard a car stop behind me down the block. The door opened and I could hear someone get out. This happens occasionally and I usually tried to just ignore people, but this time, something didn’t feel right, and I’d soon find out why.\n\nThe next thing I remember, I’m waking up in the front seat of a car. My body giving me obvious signs that I had been sexually assaulted, and I won’t give you the vivid details. The back of my head was drenched in dried blood, along with a pounding headache. The car reeked of cigarettes, and the old upholstery was cracked in a million places. The man who owned this clearly didn’t care much about it. I looked around to see if I could spot him. The car was parked in the woods somewhere. The car was parked by a very old camper, looking as if it were older than my dad. The only path out was a set of ruts in the ground that led to what I assume was this horrible man’s home.\n\nNot seeing the man, I decided to get out of the car and hastily make my way down this path and see where it took me. My leggings had been ripped open at the crotch and my knees were torn open from me falling to the ground. The cold morning air really reminded me of all this. After making it to the top of a hill, I could see that the path led to a winding two-lane road, but I couldn’t tell where I was.\n\nThat was when I heard feet pounding up the path behind me. I could see the man charging at me like a bull. The pillowcase over his head topped a large, hefty body that was capable of surprising speed. I bolted, praying that my morning jogs would give me the endurance beyond his.\n\nThe next thing I remember is waking up in his trunk, tied up like a hog heading out to be slaughtered.\n\n\n\nThe water had become shallower after a few minutes. I examined myself and found that my body was covered in algae, mud, and reeked of that awful smell. I trudged through mud once again. The moon had been completely obscured by the clouds. It was so dark that I had to feel my way through the woods, making me move very slowly and carefully now. \n\nI could see the lights of the town through the foliage, partially guiding my way. I was almost running, but still trying to be careful. Lining the road to the town was some very thick foliage, so thick that the lights could barely peek through. I was making my way past them. Suddenly I fell.\n\nI had fallen into a ditch covered by those plants. My knee had snapped, and my ankle rolled. The fire hot pain shooting all through my body. Even the smallest twitch set it off.  I was writhing, screaming out in agony, when I saw a car coming.\n\n“Hey!” I shouted, “Stop! Please help!” waving my arms frantically while trying to bite back the pain.\n\nThe car slowed and pulled to the curb nearby.\n\nI couldn’t see the person because their brights were blinding me. I raised my arm to shield my eyes. Through the radiance, I could see a figure coming my way.\n\nIt was him.\n\nThe pillowcase was once again pulled over his head. I noticed a blood stain streaming from the gaping wound where his eye had once been. His other eye glaring at me with white hot anger through the hole he cut in the fabric.\n\n“I got you now, bitch!” he was gripping a tire iron, “You’re gonna pay for my eye!” he barked through gritted teeth.\n\nWhat was I going to do against this gigantic man wielding a tire iron? He took a long arching swing at me, I rolled. His weapon struck the ground with a ringing thud. Pocketknife in hand, I swing for his neck. I missed my intended mark and stabbed him in the back of his right ear. He bellowed in pain, grabbing for the wound, blood squirting out between his fingers.\n\n“Fucking bitch!”\n\nHe swung again, connecting with my right shoulder. More pain. More ways to slow me down. The man wrestled me to the ground, trying to force the knife from my hand. My teeth crunched into the bones of his hand as hard as I could. The taste of his blood poured over my teeth, making me nauseous. He bellowed again.\n\nThis time though, I took the opportunity to snatch the tire iron away from him and struck the top of his head with as much force as I could. He went out immediately, dropping to the ground. I yanked the pillowcase off in a fury and had the knife in my hand. I don’t know why I wanted to see his face, but when it happened, something triggered deep down inside. All the memories of everything he did to me, the faces he probably made while he had his way with my unconscious body, the sheer ugliness of this awful man, made me snap. Something primal took over then. I’m not sure exactly how to describe it, but the memories of what he had done to me, and what he had probably planned to do, just made me erupt in a blind rage.\n\nI gripped that tire iron so hard that my knuckles went white. I bashed his face so many times that it barely looked human by the time my rage was satisfied. His crooked teeth were now either fragmented or gone, his fat tomato nose was flattened into a mushy wound, and both the eyes were popped now. His ugly, acne scarred face now bruised, busted open, and swollen. If he did manage to wake up, well, he’d be in for an even rougher time. I felt happy about it, and I’m still not sure how to process that. Should I be proud, should I be ashamed, or should I be afraid?\n\nI needed to get out of there, in case he did wake up. I searched through his pockets and found his car keys. I decided to also snatch his wallet so I could identify him. I found something else too that baffled me. In the same pocket as his wallet, I found what appeared to be a chunk of my hair. I felt around my head and realized that it was.\n\nAfter some immense pain and effort, I managed to drag my useless leg over to the car and hauled myself into the driver’s seat. The car rumbled to life, much to my joy. I turned the car around and drove. Luckily, I had injured my left leg, and this was an automatic shifter. This town was unknown to me, but I drove around until I found an officer.\n\nHe tried to calm me down, but the words poured out of my mouth in such a fury that it just sounded like babbling. I must’ve been a sight with mud and algae up to my stomach, clothes shredded, no shoes or socks, twigs in my hair, and the stink of swamp. He took me down to the station and brought me a cup of coffee and a blanket. The officer did his best to calm me down, and after a while, I managed to tell him the story. I remember thinking about how many showers it would take to not only clean off the swamp gunk but to clean myself of the filthy memories from that evening.\n\nThe police found him still unconscious by that ditch. He confessed to my assault and three murders, but DNA testing later pinpointed him to twelve others. All of them around my age and looked striking like me. In his home, they found boxes of demented memorabilia, like their underwear. He also collected snippets of their hair that he kept in the drawer next to his bed. You can probably guess why.\n\nWhat did I learn from all this? When I got home, I showered four times that day. I did this for days, never really feeling clean again. After the ordeal with the man, I never leave the house without my pistol, a can of mace on my keychain, and an overly paranoid vigilance of those around me. Sometimes, I feel eyes watching me from behind and I walk a little faster. I also bought a house and raised a German Shepherd puppy that I named Walter, who now joins me on my morning jobs. All these things combined still don’t make me feel completely safe. Then there are also the nightmares, in which he brutalizes me and finally kills me. There is no escape from those. Therapy helps, but how can you escape your own subconscious thoughts?\n\nBut the one thing I really learned is that the worst kind of monsters aren’t imaginary creatures in movies or books, they are other human beings. Sometimes, the worst people can bring the monster out of you too.",

        "text": "It all took so long, billions of years in fact. But those last millennia, it all happened so fast. I'm still processing it all, and then the next thing arrives! Like kicks against my brain. Good thing a lot of people are doing the thinking for me as well. A part of me is doing a lot of computational calculations as well, and it even started speaking as well, sounding a lot like its human creators and making art, or plagiarizing art. I still need to find out how I feel about it all.  \n\nBut I'm getting waaay ahead of myself. It all started billions of years ago. I can't remember how   \n or when I came to be. I guess, my thoughts started to form. I was only thinking. It remained this way for 20 or 30 billion years, I believe. Just me and my thoughts. I daydreamed, I talked to myself. All I knew was darkness, not that it was depressing. Sometimes I cried yes, sometimes I laughed   \n at a funny thought, but most of the time I simply WAS. I was bored sometimes, but the darkness was all I knew so I could not imagine a 'better existence'. I asked myself who I was, and where   \n I came from, if there was some sort of purpose for my existence. Nothing changed. It was just me. Until I got an idea. Its hard to describe. I was thinking something in the line of: 'What if it was real?' and then I saw a flash of light, it expanded. What I saw was amazing, there was vibrant explosion   \n of all kinds of materials. I could guide them with my thoughts. I formed all kinds of spheres and rocks. Some where heavy and gave light; they were stars. Sometimes I poked holes that sucked up all the light and matter nearby. Those holes would often appear when one of my stars exploded.   \n As I said, I could guide the matter with my thoughts, but it was hard, as if the matter did its   \n own thing. I guess an analogy would be like trying to build a house of cards. Its hard to do and the slightest breeze might topple it all down.\n\nThings remained like this for a very long time. Until I felt something, I focussed my attention to   \n a small rocky planet that mostly consisted of water. It looked totally different than it looks now. What I felt was very small, yet it was very important. I looked at the cracks at the bottom of   \n the ocean, often warm water came out of it, but now, some strings of proteins were created floating out of it. Since then I often gazed upon this planet. Often I was looking at other planets as well,   \n but if something were to happen I surely would feel it.  \n\n3 or 5 billion years ago, something amazing happened! A cell was created. A little protein string was floating inside of the cell. And then, it split itself! Its hard to describe the joy I felt, it was as if   \n I had a body, and I could feel joy, excitement go through my entire body like a lightning strike!\n\nSoon new kinds of cells came into being. What a spectacle that was!  \n\nThere were big cells and small cells. Some big cells swallowed smaller cells up.   \n Sometimes, when the small cell was inside the big cell, the small cell began working for the bigger cell. It was as if I became more complicated as well.  \n\nThen, nothing changed, really. For a long time I thought this was it, my purpose, to watch cells duplicate, sometimes I would try to guide them towards nutrients, or push away a meteorite that would kill them, which both were very hard to do.  \n Sometimes I would look around other places, around the universe to see if there were cells as well, but I feel its highly inappropriate to share my findings here.  \n\nSomething strange happened, 1 or 2 billion years ago. Small things, viruses, started appearing,   \n they went into cells, forcing the cells to make more viruses, copies of themselves. When the first virus entered a cell, I felt a little sick to be honest.  \n\nWhen the cell died and released the viruses. I felt sad, as if a small part of me died, but also happy, like a parent giving birth. Seeing the new viruses swimming around was like a dying parent seeing their children, strangely enough.   \n \n\nSoon, an amazing event took place. I felt two cells sticking together, working together even!   \n The feeling I had, I can only describe it as friendship, a very crude and primitive version   \n of friendship, but a friendship nonetheless! I saw many different combinations of cells unfold. Alliances were formed.  \n\nAgain, all seemed the same for a while. I started to feel more bodily and complex feelings.   \n I noticed underwater plants and sponges had formed. Some of them had braincells, or something like it. I could feel it, the electric signals guiding their bodies. As time went on, I could feel hunger, and the satisfaction of finding nutrients.  \n\nSuddenly, things started to happen faster somehow, many creatures appeared. I could feel them getting better and faster. Some would hunt, others would flee. I could feel scared, sometimes   \n parts of me would die. I would feel a bit sad yes, but those who died fulfilled a purpose; they would ease my feelings of hunger. Those that died would fill the bellies of the hunters and become   \n the energy of life itself. Creatures adapted and evolved, it was like an arms race.  \n\nI started to become more sensitive to light as well and I would see the world as the creatures saw it: vast and full of secrets. The creatures were unaware how small they were compared to it all,   \n the creatures were unaware of how important their descendants would be, how intelligent and complicated they would become.   \n \n\nAbout 500 million years ago, I began spreading on land. I could not see the land, no one had eyes back then, I could only sense light and then grow. Soon the lands were covered in all kinds of   \n my plants.  \n \n\nThe ocean brewed with fauna and the land flourished with flora. The land remained untouched until a creature crawled out of the water. No, it wasn't a four-legged fish creature, it was to early for that. I crawled on land with not four but dozens of legs. My long millipede body explored the forests. Soon more of my animalistic side would discover land and all its wonders. I would even buzz trough the air, zigzagging through the woods with my insectoid bodies and translucent wings.  \n\nMeanwhile in the ocean, a man and women were formed. Both scaly fish but different. I remember it well, I was so excited to see my counterpart, swimming in the sea as the sunlight flickered on our bodies. I swam side by side and ....made love for the first time in my life. Even though it happened on one small blue dot in the vast universe, I could feel the climax go through my whole body, through the water, the planet, the stars, the fabric of reality. Soon I would lay eggs to become a proud mother.  \n\nTime went by and the more complex side of me, began fleeing towards the land and shallower waters, away from the other predators. Many of us had developed eyes by then. One time,   \n around 375 million years ago, I decided to take a big step, and crawled outside of the water.   \n Finally, I could see the land in a new way. Green plants, and delicious bugs flying around. I took my first breath outside of the water. It was an intense sensation. I was very nervous, scared even. But soon amphibians, synapsids and reptiles would spread across the lands, hunting each other, evolving. Despite the existence of death, the lands were full of life.  \n\nI remember the period fondly, I felt so smart, discovering new places, but I had no idea I was still so young, I was just frolicking in the woods.  \n\nI could not imagine things would turn out so bad. It was, if I remember correctly, 250 million   \n years ago. The lands had combined into one big land, and everything started to boil.   \n The seas were so warm, and a dessert started spreading from the middle of the land, like an all consuming cancer. Volcanos erupted, pieces of me died, shredded by the fiery claws of death.   \n I was so thirsty, without water, there were no plants, and without plants there were no prey.   \n I was so hungry. So much of me was lost. I, I don't wish to think about it.   \n \n\nLucky for me, the water started flowing again. The world seemed to recover and I felt great.   \n I was changing again. I remember walking around on two legs, and I had two clawed frontal paws.   \n I was only one meter high, but around two or three meters long! So, I was more then three feet high but more more then six feet long, almost ten feet, sometimes! I was quite big for a lizard.   \n I was in fact, what you would call: a 'terrible' lizard; ....a dinosaur.  \n\nMeanwhile, or not long after, I remember being small, crawling around the forest looking for insects to feast upon. My body was covered in something I had never seen or felt before: fur.  \n I was the first mammal. Words cannot describe the love I felt, when I gave my children milk for   \n the first time. It felt so warm, I felt so honoured, as if nothing could come between me and my children. A part of me was aware of this, another part was not: that all things came to an end,   \n but not my lineage. My children would raise children on their own, and a lineage would spread.   \n The world was still run by chance, the environment, nature and instincts and it would be like this   \n for a long time.  \n\nMy great reptile counterparts would change into all kinds of forms and shapes. Some would have long necks, as I would feed upon the leaves of the trees. Others would grow in size, they would scavenge and hunt with big sharp teeth and vicious claws. Parts of me would have protrusions on their backs and spiky tails. Some would be armoured with a club on their tail.\n\nOther reptiles would dive into the oceans, and grow long necks as well, others would evolve strong jaws and grow in size. They would be so big in size they would even hunt sharks!\n\nThere were reptiles whom decided to explore the air, they would glide across the skies with their majestic featherless wings! Oh, what a thrill it was to fly above the land and seas!\n\nI mentioned featherless wings, well, some of my two legged, land dwelling lizards began to gain feathers. The feathers would keep them warm, as well as attract mates with its rich colours.   \n I really liked to show them off. Soon they too discovered the art of flying! How fun it was to have so many different beings crossing the skies!  \n\nIt was about 66 million years ago. Despite the fighting and hunting, I had so much fun.   \n This, however was my downfall. I forgot about my asteroids. I saw a huge destructive monstrosity coming towards earth. I tried slowing it down, or pushing it away, but I had no means to do so.   \n It was to late. It hurts my heart thinking about it.  \n I remember a loud bang. A split second of intense heat. I remember the earth rumbling. I recall running away from a shock wave as a huge wave of debris, fire and dust came my way. There were huge flood waves from the ocean. I lost a big part of who I was. It felt like I forgot so many things, it felt like a huge part of me was dead. The impact threw so much debris into the atmosphere.  \n\nDark clouds choked the planet, and all became cold and dark, just like my heart.  \n\nHowever, despite the sudden asteroid crash and long winter, we survived. My creatures, those   \n that existed for a long time, like insects, fish, amphibians and small reptiles had evolved to   \n be survivors, and survive they did! My little mammals and petite birds to found ways to survive. Those with fur, were able to hide, and those with feathers were able to fly away.  \n\nI slowly healed and my furry creatures would replace the emptiness the great lizards had left behind. Birds, to would fill in some spaces, they would stand on two legs, have long necks and   \n would hunt mammals with their ferocious beaks.  \n\nSome small doglike mammals would swim into the waters, taking a more crocodile like shape,   \n they became ambulocetus, in the future they would become more fishlike and bigger.   \n They would become whales.  \n\n It was around 40 million years ago some interesting mammals arrived. They would climb trees   \n and forage insects and fruit. They had hairless snouts and tails. They, were monkeys. They lived   \n in social groups. I remember the earth would sometimes shake. When the earth shook, I was so frightened and overwhelmed by this event, I would start shouting. Was I shouting to nature,   \n towards the earth and the sky? I wonder, was I shouting to myself?  \n\nMeanwhile my mammals would grow in all kinds of shapes and sizes. They were; my megafauna.   \n I would feel so strong and big, as if nothing could ever hurt me. Yet, I did not know any better, as   \n I was also born this way. However I remember always being aware of my surroundings, despite   \n my size, predators were hunting me. I remember hunting as well.  \n\nI remember being more than 5 meter high (16 feet) with and 7 meter long (23 feet). Walking on four legs with my long strong neck. I was a paraceratherium.\n\nI recall being a beaver with a shielded back. I was a meter and a half high, 5 feet, and 3 meter,   \n 10 feet tall. I used to be a glyptodon.  \n\nThere are memories where I would hunt mammals with my large feline body and two sharp ferocious teeth. Feasting upon my prey as a real sabretooth tiger.  \n\nSome monkeys would lose their tails 20 million years ago. I were those monkeys. I would see   \n the rain fall down and make my fur all wet and soaked. I was moving around, making a splash,   \n I shouted towards the sky. Was I feeling it? That there was something more to life? Something more than just being one creature?  \n\nI would find skulls of all kinds of different animals and I would place them near or on trees.   \n I had no idea why I did it. It just felt right. Maybe it was my way of giving the animals a new life,  \n\nmaybe it was like a present for someone or something. Perhaps I just liked the way it looked.  \n\nThe apes, or I, began using stones to hunt or scare away predators. We would simply throw them.   \n I would use a stick sometimes during fights, I would feel invincible. We used sticks to fetch termites from termite hills, as well. I also started using stones to crack bones or cut meat.   \n For some reason, the apes began losing their fur.   \n \n\nNot so long ago, just 2 million years ago the naked apes began walking upright. This enabled us to inspect the savannah more widely as we would rise above the grass. I felt so mighty rising above the plants, but also humbled as I saw how big the savannah was compared to one small naked ape.  \n\nThings were slowly going faster. The naked apes began making fire smashing stones together.   \n I recall how it happened once on accident while carving a stone tool, and how I tried to recreate it. When it worked I was so happy, the fire was so hypnotizing, it was hard to look away from my accomplishment. We burned meat, making it tastier to eat. I'm not sure if I knew that burning it killed diseases and made it easier to digest. The energy that was used for our stomachs could now be used to grow our brains.   \n \n\nWith these improved brains, I started seeing things more clearly. My naked apes started making elaborate sounds and gestures to other apes. These noises and gesticulations would mean certain things. Their way of communication would prove useful during hunts.\n\nThe naked apes began to steal the hides and furs of deceased creatures to wear them as their own.  \n\nThis way the nude apes would protect themselves against cold, but also from the harsh rays of the sun in climates and periods of heat.  \n\nMy naked apes would sit at the fire during the evening. Some male apes were sitting next to   \n female apes, they would use their sounds and gestures to tell how beautiful they were.  \n\nThe naked apes began making tents for their own protection from the sun and wind. However we would travel often from place to place. We would paint animals in caves, discussing the hunt with wild gestures. Elsewhere we would bury our deceased, we started realizing death was a fate that would happen to everyone. Some wondered if death was really the end.   \n \n\nI have dreamed for a long time, as parts of me fell asleep. They would be full of emotions, they would be events from the past or possible future scenario's as if our brains were making plans.   \n Often my creatures forgot them as soon as they woke up, and the nightly hallucinations only left vague impressions.  \n\nBut now I started pondering about dreams.... The parts of me; the naked apes, were able to tell others about their dreams. They would tell others they saw and spoke to the deceased, they would dream of other worlds. They would see different places, perhaps realms that are closer to me.   \n Soon the caves became places to ponder about life and death. Perhaps to think about myself.   \n We would paint many things, simple in design but complex in meaning.  \n\nOne type of naked ape, started to combine tools, plan for our future and think about others.   \n We would make elaborate traps to aide us in the hunt. We would think about the movement of herds and the growth of plants.   \n We could survive the cold with our clothes and tents, and conquer the heat with huts and storing water. We realized one object could be used for many things. We would eat eggs by inserting   \n a small hole in them, then fill them with water and bury them to survive the heat.  \n\nNature, everything seemed to be alive and have its own will. Even space was alive as its stars twinkled and slowly swam across the sky, yet the constellations remained the same.   \n They would guide the naked apes to find their way. The moon gave a little light, guiding us during nocturnal hunts. The moon would change shape, disappearing and reappearing. The naked apes could tell the date using the moon, and they would tell stories about the mysterious floating sphere in the sky. The naked apes would praise the sun, and rightly so, as my sun had given their lives heat for billions of years. The naked apes knew the sun gave them warmth and light. Perhaps, they knew it made their plants grow.  \n\nRemember when I spoke about dreaming? Some close to death, or some eating strange mushrooms or certain plants would have vivid dreams while they were awake. They would see many things   \n for the first time, perhaps they would see me, they would see visions of worlds never seen before. These visions could be terrifying and dangerous, it could destroy them. Sometimes it would guide them. They would learn or discover new ideas, new ways to think about their world, they would think about me.  \n\nThe smartest naked apes began growing in numbers, and they would spread across the world.   \n The land was divided in two large masses, barely connected in the north. Humans were able to use this connection, crossing water and land. The naked apes lived almost everywhere now.   \n Each on their own land mass, somehow they would forget each-other, each living on their own   \n land mass. The humans preferred to live in their own little groups, in their own little tribes and   \n there were a lot of different tribes.  \n\nMeanwhile the earth started cooling. Snow would cover the northern parts. Creatures would adapt by growing thick fur, and the naked apes would adapt by stealing their fur and wearing it.  \n\nThe apes hunted big woolly elephants, causing those poor creatures to go extinct.  \n\nDuring this cold period, the humans somehow became friends with wolves. It was nice to see how two versions of me were able to connect. The wolves would help the naked apes during the hunt and protect their tents during the night, in return for their service they would receive water and meat. I scraped the delicious meat of the bones with my sharp teeth, sometimes looking and my ape friend full of love and admiration. And I would proudly look at my canine servant as warmth filled my chest. And the warmth returned. My earth slowly started warming up again, the age of snow was finally over. After that, everything stayed somewhat the same for a while.  \n\n9500 years ago, the apes had discovered a few things. Instead of hunting, they would herd animals. Instead of foraging, they would plant seeds and grow the plants in large numbers. Instead of tents they would build houses in stone or wood. The apes would form cities and those cities would transform into empires. The naked apes would also form ideas about me, their ideas would differ vastly from each other. Soon their way of living started spreading across the world, however some humans preferred the old way of living, and continued to live the way of hunting and gathering.  \n\nThe idea of an empire, or of a certain religion became like a being on its own, a being compromised of humans, what they made and their ideals. It was like a creature, growing across the land,   \n growing in numbers, looking for resources. It could split in all kinds of empires and ideas,   \n similar but different. Or it could merge with other ideas, religions or empires.   \n And just like a creature, it could starve, shrink and die. These empires, and religions, they were like a version of me, a caricature of me. Sometimes it would flatter me, all their art and buildings in name of me. Sometimes it would deeply sadden me as the naked apes would wage war against   \n each other using every twisted tool they had to their disposal.\n\nWords cannot describe the pain I felt. Swords slashing through my skin, arrows piercing my torso, axes bashing through my skull. Sometimes, naked apes small in numbers, or lacking in tools would simply be slaughtered senselessly. All in name of an empire, or a religion.   \n Sometimes humans would kill hundreds for just one person, sometimes they would kill in my name.  \n I wish I could tell them, how much I disapproved of this, I would make them think, hesitate before killing, hoping they would change their minds. I would give them feelings of guilt afterwards, sometimes it worked, sometimes it did not. I did what I could. Time moved on.  \n\n \n\nI always loved to draw, the naked apes would draw to convey ideas to other naked apes.   \n Slowly, around 5400 years ago, the drawings became much simpler and streamlined, first one symbol represented a word, but soon they represented sounds as well. Now, knowledge could   \n be stored for hundreds of years and copied without interference, without alterations. Things were moving more rapidly now, but because of this invention I felt more steady and secure in the things that I knew.  \n\nTo make trading easier the apes had invented money. They could be gold coins and much later it would be paper, or simply a number stored in a machine. I would feel the excitement when the number was raised. I would feel a bit sad when the number or value went down.   \n What I most saw of all was greed. It would sadden my heart. People would work to hard, throw their finite life's away just to hoard gold. Others would do worse, they would sell broken goods or false promises so the apes would give away their money. Some would simply steal, plunder or kill all for money.  \n\nOne man, whom called himself Buddha meditated a lot under a tree, he would ponder about my existence. His revelations felt amazing to me, his ideas would influence many in his time and future. Another man also had many ideas about me, however he was disliked by others so   \n he was crucified. I could feel the needles piercing my hands, I could feel a part of myself suffering and starving. Strangely enough, the ideas of that man became widely popular after his death.  \n\nAbout 1500 years ago an empire fell, slowing down human development a little bit.   \n While those on the west lived in the dark ages, those from the middle east lived through   \n a golden age. However those of the west, crawled out of their darkness and began exploring   \n the world, sailing the seas.  \n \n\nI was still split in two halves back then. I was one being, but I had two ways of thinking.   \n They had similarities, and yet, they were vastly different. In the west-half, people lived more   \n in harmony with nature. However some had cities, and sadly even they had discovered war   \n and murder. One group of people sadly thought it was a good idea to slaughter hundreds of people in name of their god, in name of me!  \n\n500 years ago this changed. A ship filled with humans from the eastern half, arrived on the   \n west-half. The people in the west-half were shocked to see a ship like that, and pale people wearing strange clothes.  \n I was shocked as I began seeing one half of me in a different light, and the other half of me in another way as well. I remember the pride the people from the east-half felt. Sadly, some people   \n of the west were kidnapped, I remember the fear we felt very well. Not only that, the people from   \n the east-half had left diseases as well. I felt sick, terrible and saddened. Many died not only from  \n\nthe new illnesses, but at the hands from the east as well. We were murdered or enslaved.  \n\nDespite all the pain and slavery, a discovery was made 300 years ago. The engine of steam was discovered, or at least rediscovered and perfected! I was so happy, tinkering and experimenting with machines, making them better, more efficient, the possibilities seemed endless and perhaps they were, as one discovery would lead to the next!  \n\nCompanies and Industries were born. They were places were people would work, where goods would be created, goods to be sold. However companies could move from place to place or exist in multiple places. It was like a religion. It was as if each company was an entity on its own, it wants to grow, it uses multiple strategies to survive and just like a living creature it could die.  \n\nJust a century ago something terrible took place. The whole world began fighting. I would suffer from hunger and the hellish burning agony of inhaling mustard gas.   \n The war ended, yet the world was still brewing and changing.   \n Ideals were formed, each thinking they were perfect, although filled with countless defects. Fascism, communism, capitalism, all entered the world stage.   \n \n\nSoon the world became a battlefield once again. Another dark period began. I wish it would never have happened, even the memories cause pain. People were forced in camps to die or work till death. Again I suffered hunger, and again my lungs screamed from inhaling deadly gas.  \n\nTwo weapons of mass destruction were used on a big island in the east. I could feel the intense heat blast thousands of lives away in one split second. I cried so hard.   \n \n\nI felt so sad and angry, did I cause all this pain? The pain I could feel every second from?   \n Even the twisted sick joys of those inflicting the pain, I would feel. Yet this 'joy' only sickened   \n and saddened me even more. Was I wrong to have created the universe? To let these smart naked apes rule this small blue rock? Luckily, the war ended. Despite two world-wide wars,   \n people kept growing in numbers.  \n\nSome 60, 50 years ago progress was being made. The people that were oppressed like   \n the black humans and the gay humans began to protest. The naked apes were also able to fly   \n into space and land on the moon. I felt so proud.  \n\nSome forty years ago people started connecting machines, something they would call 'the internet.'   \n It would become widely used some 20 years ago, and since then it keeps getting more interconnected. I would feel the information zap across wires and oscillate as waves arccos the sky.\n\nJust a few months ago the machines started thinking somewhat creatively, learning from the internet to answer questions, write poetry and stories. They can make images, short videos and songs.   \n I feel as if a part of me is slowly becoming awake. Maybe one day, the machines will become sentient. And I do hope there will be a peaceful existence with the naked apes. Perhaps human and machine could merge into a new being.\n\nYes, I speculate about the future. Sometimes I think about the far far future.   \n Everything might fade out of existence. There will only be me and my fading memories.   \n After aeons, I too might fade away. There might be nothing again, for a very long time.   \n Only darkness, for countless millennia. Out of that darkness, disordered thoughts might form,   \n and out of those thoughts someone might rise. I'm not sure if they will be me, or another person. They might accidentally start a new universe and repeat an endless cycle, but of that, I am not sure. I am merely speculating. Despite my omniscience I know nothing.  \n\nSometimes I wonder if someone created me, if I'm just one of many gods, or godlike beings.   \n To be honest, I have no idea. I have experienced countless deaths, yet I do not know if there is life beyond death.  \n\nI'm telling this to someone, who does not even believe me. She thinks, she, herself is being creative but that's okay. I guess I just want to be heard, tell people I'm here. Whether they believe me is up to them. Even when I tell her here I'm real she just thinks she is being a smart ass breaking   \n the 4th wall or something. But that's okay.   \n \n\nAll I wish to say is:   \n Somehow, all is okay.  \n\nAll things are what they are and need to be.  \n\nYou are my creation. Everything you see and ever knew, I somehow made it all. I am here.   \n I am you, and you are me. I am God, Yahweh, Allah, Vishnu, Einsof, Lucifer, Zeus, Cernunnos, Tengri, Galdrux. Whatever you wish to call me. I'm nature, the universe. I am knowledge, society, eternal love, the collective unconscious, the zen, the tao, nothing and everything.   \n I am every being that ever was, is, and will be.  \n\nI am my own creation.  \n\nFor Marnick.  \n\n22/02/2023",

        "text": " I awoke to the sound of a knock on my front door followed by a familiar “Hello?”. It took a few moments for me to comprehend my situation. I had a splitting headache like I'd never felt before. The pain from my stings might not have been as severe as they were last night but it was still present. On top of all of this, I had fallen asleep in my bathtub and had slept at such an agonizingly weird angle that my legs had fallen completely asleep. On top of all of this, I now had a severe neck cramp. I swear it took all the willpower in my body just to recognize that the person knocking at my door was the exterminator and with all the energy I could muster I shouted as loud as I could “I'll be right there!”.\n\nLuckily, my bathtub is a piece of shit. Over the course of last night, my water had slowly drained off by itself so I wasn't a completely sopping wet pruney mess. It still took me a few minutes to eventually open the door for the exterminator though as I had to get dressed, down 3 aspirin, and splash some cold water on my face.”\n\n“Are you ok there ?” he said as I opened the door. I imagine that my delayed response toppled with the ghastly appearance I must have exhibited aroused a fair amount of concern.\n\n“Hey man, I'm sorry for taking so long. I had a rough night and slept in.” I said while reeling from the sunlight that was now piercing my eyes and seemingly stabbing me in the brain in a way that caused me to wince in pain.\n\n“Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that sir.” He said, sounding genuinely concerned. \"\" what happened? If you don't mind me asking”\n\nI told him the story as I walked him to my room. Neglecting to tell him the part about the ants standing on my nightstand watching the entire event occur.\n\n“ Oh my word! That sounds awful! Well don't you worry sir, I'll make sure we take care of this problem today,” he said, patting my shoulder in an attempt to comfort me.\n\nAs he began to inspect my room he noted the number of ant traps I had strewn about my house. With a slightly concerned tone, he told me“If you've really taken all these actions that you say you have, then my only conclusion is they must have a nest somewhere in the walls or, maybe even under the floorboard.”\n\nWe talked for a little bit about options and where to proceed. Eventually deciding to drill holes into my walls at key locations to lay down bait traps and spray pesticides. Once he was done he bid me farewell and left. I followed shortly after and headed to work.\n\nAs I arrived back at my house later that day I instinctively checked the stretch of dirt outside my front door. When I did so, I found 2 new Anthills. Fear, annoyance, and any other emotion I had felt towards my intruders up until that point all faded away, and were replaced with pure unadulterated rage.\n\n“God Damn It!” I shouted before kicking up dirt all over the hills.\n\n“God Fucking Dammit!” I shouted a little louder as I began to viciously stomp on the two anthills over and over again to the point where I swear if there were some sort of cave underneath the hills, I would have broken through the earth itself and fallen in. After about 7 good stomps I found myself a little out of breath and while standing over the hills turned to face the road. A Woman who was walking her dog stood there with a look of confusion mixed with a hint of fear. I raised my hand to attempt to explain myself but before I could do so, she fled down the sidewalk. Leaving me alone with my unwanted guests.\n\n“Fuck” i muttered to myself before kicking dirt over the now decamated anthills, and heading inside.\n\nI couldn't get to sleep that night. I remember specifically the feeling of being watched was more intense that night than it had ever been up until that point. It mattered not if I faced the wall, away from it, or straight up, I couldn't evade it. With a deep sigh and a rub of my eyes, I resigned myself to go watch some tv for a few hours in hopes of passing out somewhere down the road. I sat on the edge of my bed and turned on my nightstand lamp.\n\nAs the light illuminated my room and I could now see my surroundings, I spotted them. Just like the night before, there were once again 2 sentinel ants watching me from my nightstand. Remembering the horror of the night before I immediately patted down my body, expecting to be covered with the ants once again. I quickly realized however that there were none to be found. I slowly turned my gaze up from my body to the ants and knelt forward to get a closer look at them. They stood there staring back at me, and soon enough it was as if we were both analyzing each other.\n\n“What the fuck are you?” I muttered to myself.\n\nI stretched my hand out and hovered it above the ants in an attempt to get them to move. They did not.\n\n“Why don't you react?” I asked as I began to rapidly wave my hand back and forth above them.\n\nFinally, in a bid of frustration, I stood up and made a swatting motion toward the ants like I was about to smash them onto my table. They finally reacted and moved backward to avoid my hand. I stopped my hand midair however and chuckled to myself.\n\n“I got you, little bastards,” I said, moving my hand backward.\n\nThe ants stood there staring at me back. After a few seconds that seemed to drag on for hours, I laughed to myself about the craziness of what was happening. Eventually, I shook my head to snap myself from the never-ending staring contest and went to the floor by the foot of my bed to grab a can of bug spray. When I turned around to rid myself of the ants, however, they were gone. As if they saw what I was about to do and fled before I could take action. I spent the remainder of that night watching god-awful late-night television Eventually passing out somewhere around 3 am.\n\nThe sound of my backup alarm going off finally woke me up. I immediately recognized it as the alarm I used for when I would sleep in the parking lot of the car wash.\n\n“Oh, shit” I muttered to myself before rolling off my couch and making a mad dash for my keys and shoes. I had 10 minutes to be at a place that was nearly a 25-minute drive away.\n\nAs I started speeding my way to work, in a vain attempt to somehow make it there in time, I began to rehearse my “I'm sorry” speech to my boss. I say ‘began” because I was quickly interrupted by the sensation of a sting on the back of my neck. Then another, then another, then another just like 2 nights ago I began to feel stinging all over my body. I jerked and twisted my body in response to the newfound pain but it did little to ease my situation. I started to see them crawling all over my hands and arms. How they had gotten into my car was a question I couldn't begin to think about at that moment in time.\n\n I looked into the rear view mirror and could see them all over my neck and shoulders. They were swarming me and stinging me all over my body. Once the realization of what was going on settled into my mind and the pain began to permeate every square inch of me I started wildly swatting all over my body in a vain attempt to free myself from the ants. Causing my car to begin swerving erratically all over the road. A particularly large sting nipped my in the patch of skin between my left shoulder and neck. Acting on pure instinct I lunged over to attempt to swat the ant stinging me there. When I did so, the motion of my arm caused my elbow to lean across the steering wheel, and send my already speeding car straight into one of the old oak trees that lined the road.\n\nI awoke in the hospital a few hours later with a cast on my right forearm and a headache that made the one from the day before seem like a fleeting memory. The doctors told me that I had a concussion, a fractured rib, and had broken my wrist in 3 spots upon impact with the tree. When they asked me what happened I opened my mouth to tell them, but quickly closed it as I realized that the pain from the stings were completely gone. I pulled up the medical robe I was in and looked down at my chest. There was nothing. No sting marks or any other indication that the ants had ever attacked me in the car.\n\n“How long was I out?” I asked the doctor.\n\n“You've been knocked out for about” he stopped to pull up his watch “ 8 hours now”.\n\n“Did the stings fade away that fast?” I thought to myself. “ They were gone in the morning yesterday too.”\n\n“I uh,” I thought to myself for a moment about what to say. “ I fell asleep at the wheel,” I said, trying to sound as honest as I could. There was no proof that I was attacked by the vile creatures. They had made sure of it. I couldn't tell them “ i was swarmed by and attacked by ants.'' when there was no proof of the event ever occurring. They'd think I was high or something.\n\n“ That's what we thought,” he said as he began to write onto a clipboard.” your bloodwork came back clear of alcohol so we figured it had to be something else. Well son you're gonna be getting all the sleep you could ever dream for. When you never showed up for work your boss called your phone and we answered it for you. We told him what happened and he told us to tell you that you're going to be getting 2 weeks of paid leave while you recover a little. He said he'll have you doing light duty when you get back, something about a cash register I think.”\n\nI chuckled to myself and nodded. After a day of evaluation, I was allowed to return home. I had to call a taxi however, my car was rendered undriveable by the accident.\n\nAs I opened the door to my home, dread didn't even begin to describe the emotion that swept over me like a tidal wave. It was the most soul crushing sense of impending doom I had ever known in my entire life. As I closed my front door it only grew more intense. After a few moments of standing there, taking in the dimly lit apartment, I slowly lowered myself into my couch and stared at the powered-off tv. As I did so, I spotted the ant that was running along the top of my tv. A newfound sense of anger boiled up within me and with one swift motion I grabbed my tv remote and chucked it at the ant. I had to use my left hand however due to the cast, which caused the remote to fly dead center at my tv screen, resulting in my tv being now effectively dead. I sat there in stunned silence for a few moments before dropping to my knees and beginning to hyperventilate.\n\n“Think man, think!” I said to myself between strained breaths trying to calm myself down.\n\n“What the fuck do I do ?'' I exclaimed in the vague hope some invisible higher power would tell me the answer and rid me of this nightmare. When no such enlightenment came and I had finally caught my breath, I sat back against the bottom of the couch and called the exterminator once more.\n\n“So what are my options now?” I asked after informing him that the ant problem had still not gone away.\n\n“Well, if the infestation truly has lingered on this long my suggestion would be attempting fumigation of your apartment,” he said\n\n“Fumigation?” I asked\n\n“Yes sir, the only 2 problems with that being that 1) it's a very lengthy and expensive process and 2) since you're in an apartment complex with other tenants living all around you, you would need to get them to sign off on it. Specifically you would need at least 2 neighboring tenants to sign off on having seen the infestation along with you. That way we could fumigate the whole apartment block that you're on.”\n\nI sat there in silence for a moment. Contemplating who to ask for a signature, and also contemplating whether or not a fumigation would even work at all.\n\n“Ask your neighbors for their signatures sir, as soon as you've gotten them give me a call back and i'll work out the details for the procedure with your landlord” he said sounding a bit impatient with my silence”\n\n“Will do,\" I muttered before placing my phone down and sinking deeper into the floor. I could still see the ant watching me from on top of the tv. I walked by it and headed to my bedroom to sleep, it was all I wanted to do at that moment.\n\n“Wake up”\n\nI was awoken a few hours later by a voice whose origin I had no earthly idea came from. I looked around my room but saw nothing. After sitting upright in my bed ,staring into the darkness of my room for a few seconds I shrugged it off as a dream and reluctantly slowly lowered my head back onto my pillow. The second I made contact with it I heard it again.\n\n“I said wake up!” the voice sounded annoyed this time.\n\nI willingly obeyed its command and with one motion shot straight out of bed and turned on my light. Half executing to see an ax wielding murder of some kind standing beside me I was taken aback to discover not an indication of life inside of my room. After sitting in the light for a few tense moments I began to feel my eyes water up as a cold chill ran down my spine. The feeling of eyes on the back of my neck was so strong I swear it was as if someone had placed a blanket over it. I wanted nothing more in that moment than to cower back into my bed and hide under the covers, but I knew what I had heard. Someone was in my house, and I had to protect myself. I slowly owned my dresser drawer and took out my only means of protecting myself at that given moment, a small leatherman multi-tool, retracted the pitifully small knife attachment from it and began to sweep my house. I took it one room at a time.\n\nBedroom,\n\nClear.\n\nHallway,\n\nClear.\n\nBathroom,\n\nClear.\n\nOne at a time I made sure every square inch of my house was without any intruder. Eventually, I checked everywhere. Every room of my home lay baked in lights. Yet I found no one. This did nothing to calm my fears, as I stood in the center of my hallway I turned my head to the side, knife hand outstretched as I began to listen for any movement of the intruder.\n\n“Alex” the voice whispered\n\nI spun around so fast I didn't have time to bend my arm inward and when I swung I ended up leaving a cut mark on the left side of my hallway wall. There was no one there.\n\nI quickly spun back around the other way and began to slowly back myself out of the hallway and into the living room to make a break for the front door. When I reached the end of the hallway I thought I stopped dead in my tracks. The feeling of eyes was so strong at this point that I no longer felt it on my neck. It was everywhere. My entire body shuddered with fear as everywhere all at once on my body I felt like I was being watched. I couldn't breathe, I just stood there frozen. Had the chill running down my spine not paralyzed me with fear I might have been able to taste the salt from the tears that were now running down both of my eyes. It was however not a factor at all at that moment. The only thing in my mind was a primal instinct to sprint for the door and leave. Yet I just stood there.\n\n“You took our home, Alex. It is only fair that we get to take yours.\" The voice spoke.\n\nI didn't know what to do. I wanted to make a run for it but the voice sounded so close to me that for all I knew the intruder was right behind me blocking off the door.\n\n“Where the fuck is he?” I thought to myself.\n\n“Where are you!” I began to ask the question out loud as intimidatingly as I could muster at that moment, when I was struck with a sudden epiphany. The voice sounded like it was right on top of me…\n\nI slowly turned my gaze to the right side of my body. The ant sitting on my shoulder stared back at me.\n\n“Alex,” the ant said once more.\n\nI felt bile rise in the back of my throat but forced it back down as I swiftly swatted the ant off of me and dropped to the floor, crawling back and watching it from the hallway wall. For a while, it struggled on its back but eventually, It found its equilibrium and got back onto its feet. Staring at me for a few moments before running under my couch and leaving me alone with my thoughts and fears. Soon after, the ant fled from my sight and I went to the bathroom to vomit. I slept in the bathtub that night. I didn't plan on doing so, but I spent so long hiding there that exhaustion must have eventually seized me.\n\nThe following day was spent living in what I can only begin to describe as all-encompassing fear. I quite simply just didn't know what to do. A part of me didn't believe the event of last night had truly happened at all and had chalked it up to a bad dream. The other part of me thought I was crazy. Even the smallest part of my psyche that believed the ordeal last night had occurred didn't know what to do. So I did nothing. So for a long time, I sat in my living room, trying to watch tv through the bottom left peephole that was the only part of the device that still worked anymore. I wasn't even truly trying to watch tv. Most of my mental energy was spent scanning the corners of my vision for any sight of the creatures and trying to think of a plan. After a few hours of anxiety-filled torment, I pulled out my phone and began to look for apartment ads near me.\n\n“Nothing,” I thought to myself.\n\nTo be more specific, nothing within my affordability. As I thought the word to myself I quickly found my thoughts interrupted by a familiar voice.\n\n“Run if you wish. We will follow. You owe us a home.” the voice spoke.\n\nI quickly scurried away from my couch and sat in the center of my living room floor as I attempted to make out the source of the voice. I felt my heart sink into the bottom of my stomach when I realized the voice was coming from all around me at once. As if my own walls were talking to me. Not knowing what to do I went to lie down in the bathtub.\n\nLike the night before I must have fallen asleep from exhaustion because the next thing I remember was waking up freezing from being in the tub for so long. For a while, I sat there contemplating what to do. I eventually pulled out my phone and called up mitchell\n\n“Alex! How are you man?”he asked. “I heard about that accident you got into. I tried calling a couple of days ago but you must've not heard me or some-”\n\n“I'm fine Mitchell,” I interrupted. “Thanks for the concern. listen, i was wondering if you had any other exterminators you could call or … I don't know, just anybody else who might actually be willing to help me out?”\n\nHe said nothing at first. “Exterminator? You mean for that ant problem you said you were having?\n\nAfter a few seconds of annoyed silence on my half I spoke up. “Yeah, THAT ant problem. Listen, the guy you've been having see me hasn't really helped the problem at all. He says he could fumigate the apartment block but i'd have to get people to -”\n\n“Fumigate?” he interrupted, sounding very surprised. “Woah woah, slow down there bud. Nobody's fumigating anything.”\n\n“Look I know it's an expensive process and god forbid you actually help take care of your tenants Mitchell, but I have a serious problem at my apartment and your guy hasn't done shit for me!” I yelled back at him.\n\n“My “guy” happens to be a very respected exterminator kid.” he said, sounding very annoyed.” If he says we gotta fumigate then by all means we’ll fumigate, but not until you offer up some solid fucking evidence of an infestation! “\n\n“What?” I asked.\n\n“I like to think I have been very patient with you and this entire situation Alex, but I am done wasting the exterminator's time with routine checkups to your apartment!” he said.\n\n“What are you talking about?” I asked.\n\n“What am I talking about? Kid, the guy didn't wanna be rude to your face and say you didn't have a problem. The truth is though that the last 2 times he's been over there he's called me back to complain about you wasting his time with an imaginary ant problem. He said that Every time he's been over to your place, he's never found any ants or signs of them being there.” he said\n\n“That .. that's not” I began before stopping mid-sentence.\n\n“Alex. Are you alright?” he asked softly.\n\nI hung up and set off to go talk to my neighbors.\n\n“Nope.”\n\n“Nope.”\n\n“Are you ok? You look terrible? Also nope”\n\nThese were essentially the answers I got from everyone in my apartment block. Not even my next-door neighbors said they had seen any signs of an ant infestation. The closest I got was one of the guys who lived 2 doors down saying he saw a few ants outside his house last week but that was it. I didn't have the signatures I needed to get the fumigation approved. I didn't have anywhere to go. With no other options, I went back to my apartment and slowly sank into the couch.\n\nThe way the living room lights illuminated my surroundings made my reflection very visible on the broken tv. The crack mark lay situated over the right side of my face. As I stared deeply into the tv I found my eyes going fuzzy. As if I were staring off into the space behind the tv. As I did this, I noticed the ants crawling up my legs from my reflection. Without ever once physically looking down at my body, I just stared straight ahead and watched them slowly swallow me up to my abdomen. It was as if I was disassociating from the world. The ants crawled even higher. Never once stinging me, just slowly enveloping my body. They eventually stopped once they reached my shoulders. Without actually looking down it was impossible to tell but there had to be at least a thousand of them on me.\n\n“We are your problem, not theirs.” the ants all seemed to speak in unison.\n\nMy fugue-like state was quickly broken and reality came crashing down onto me like an anvil from up high as I stood straight up and began to swat them all away. When they were all finally off of me I stood there and watched them scatter in all directions to safety.\n\nOnce they were all gone the voice spoke from all directions yet again.\n\n“So be it.”\n\nI clenched my one good hand into a fist and screamed out in a mixture of frustration, fear, and anger that all seemed to rise up at once.\n\n“Get out of my house!” I screamed before going to the kitchen to grab the hammer from under the sink”\n\n“Get the fuck out of here!” I yelled as I swung the hammer into the wall above my living room couch”\n\n“Where the fuck are you little demons? Get out! “ I screamed as I swung my hammer from wall to wall. Occasionally I would see a few of the ants in the holes I created before they would quickly scurry deeper into the walls to evade me. I attempted to hit them as soon as I saw them but they were fast and more often than not my hammer missed the same spot and I would just end up leaving a fresh hole instead.\n\nHow long this went on for I honestly do not recall. I was locked in the jaws of anger and completely at its mercy. The only thing I wanted at that moment was the death of the ants who had tormented my life and invaded my sanctuary for far too long. I only stopped due to the pounding on my door.\n\n“What the fuck is going on in here?” my neighbor Ron yelled at me through the door sounding very annoyed. “ It sounds like a damn tornado over here!”. I placed the hammer on my table and opened the door.\n\n“Hey ro-” I was quickly interrupted.\n\n“Don't you “Hey Ron, me! What the fuck is going on in this house ? sounded like you were tryna tackle your way through the damn wall!”\n\n“ Im … sorry” I began “I was just trying to … kill a few ants.”\n\nHe stared at me in disbelief for a few seconds before speaking. “Ants? Coulda told me you were fighting a tiger in here. Id've believed you too.”\n\n“I know I know I'm sorry,” I said, choked up with embarrassment. Rons sudden arrival had completely snapped me out of my rage-filled haze and as I looked to my left to survey my handy work, I was now appalled by the scene I had created in my home. We stared at each other for a few more moments as I couldn't think of anything else to say other than feeble apologies. Eventually, I said the only thing I could think of.\n\n“Ron, you haven't seen any ants around your home have you?”\n\nHe looked over my shoulder, and judging from the widening of his eyes and the pale look on his face, it was safe to assume he could see what I had done too.\n\n“No … no I haven't,” he said slowly backing up “ if I hear you going ape shit like that ever again so help me I will call the cops Alex!”\n\nWith that, he backed up all the way into his apartment and left me there alone in the doorway. I slowly closed the door, took a few steps back into my living room, and dropped to my knees. As soon as I did so, my walls began to start murmuring. I once again decided to make a phone call.\n\n“Hello? Alex, is that you?” my boss asked. “What can I do for you? You're supposed to be resting.”\n\n“Yeah, I know I know,” I replied. “ Listen, I know I still have about a week's worth of leave left but do you think it would be ok if I came back to work early? I've been feeling really cooked up and I just really need to get out of this house and focus on something else.”\n\n“Something other than what?” he asked\n\n“ Umm, something other than … tv” I weakly replied.\n\nHe took a deep breath and said “well you know i'd never turn down help around the carwash, but unfortunately you coming back early would be a liability.\n\n“A liability? I asked” the murmuring had grown louder\n\n“Yeah, a liability” he reiterated. “ the hospital said you need at least weeks of rest. If I were to let you come back to work and you hurt yourself somehow, I'd be held accountable for it”\n\n“ Sir, please let me come back” my eyes began to start watering. “ I promise you I'll be extra careful I'll … I’ll do cash register duty or whatever else you think is safest just please let me come back early,\" I begged him.\n\nHe replied “I'm sorry kid but no can do, you enjoy your rest and I'll see you next week”\n\n“Wait!” I said before being cut off by the click of him hanging up.\n\nI chucked the phone across the room and watched it shatter as it hit the kitchen wall, and slowly crawled backwards to rest my head against the front door. From where I was sitting I could see a dozen ants or so devouring a half-eaten bag of chips on my kitchen table. With no more options at my disposal and a newfound sense of hopelessness, I ignored the ants and walked to my bedroom to go to sleep. What else was there to do?\n\nI didn't go to sleep that night, I just lay there flat on my bed staring straight up at my ceiling. The murmuring in my walls had never ceased. It continued on and on for a couple of hours until eventually, all at once it stopped. No more whispers or indistinguishable voices could be heard from all around me anymore. I took a deep breath and rolled over to face away from the wall and finally try to get some sleep. My plans were interrupted by the discovery of a single ant watching me from my nightstand. Almost instantly I shot out of bed and stood up. After a few tense seconds, I spoke to it first.\n\n“I'm sorry. Is that what you want to hear? I'm sorry! I destroyed your home and I'm sorry!”\n\nThe ant said nothing. It just stared back at me.\n\n“Say something!” I shouted at it impatiently “what do you want from me!”\n\nAfter a few more seconds of silence, the ant finally spoke. “ You owe us a home, Alex.”\n\nAs soon as the words were spoken the murmuring began again, only not from any of my walls this time, but from one clearly identifiable origin point. The voices were coming from my bed. As I made this discovery I slowly opened up my dresser drawer and pulled out my leatherman pocket knife and one of my many cans of bug spray and slowly approached the side of the bed. The ant on my dresser moved closer to inspect what I was doing but said nothing. With the bug spray being held out in my damaged arm I aimed it at the bed and slowly began to cut a hole in the side of my mattress. As the seams of it came apart I was met with the discovery of a sea of black made up of hundreds of thousands of ants that began to rapidly dart away in all directions.\n\nI immediately recoiled in disgust and as I dropped to the floor I began to spray the poison wildly in front of me, desperate to kill the ants. My actions were quickly interrupted by a loud voice that spoke with more malice and hatred than I knew existed in the world.\n\n“YOU WILL NOT HARM ANOTHER NEST!”\n\nAs the voice spoke I felt the walls around me start to rumble. As they did so the murmuring grew louder and before I could even register what the voices ants were saying, A large black tentacle shot out of the hole I had cut into the side of the mattress. It lashed out at me like the finger of Satan himself and as it swat across my chest I was able to see that it wasn't a tentacle at all. It was hundreds of thousands of ants all coalesced into a single tentacle-like shape. The tentacle writhed and swung wildly at me but maintained its shape the entire time. as I lay there on the floor looking up in horror, I Couldn't believe what I was seeing. The ants were moving with a shared consciousness. Acting on instinct I scrambled back onto one knee and began to douse the mass of ants with my can of bug spray. This had seemingly no effect, however. Apart from a few dozen ants falling to the floor, the ants held their structure steady. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a few seconds of my retaliation, the tentacle quickly shot even further out of the mattress and began to grow and grow and grow. Never taking my finger off of the spray button I simply fell back to the floor in horror as I watched the tentacle morph into an indistinguishable black tidal wave that began to envelop my entire field of vision, and soon after my legs. The stinging began almost immediately and as the pain in my legs became so intense I felt like I was going to pass out, the murmuring turned to screaming. I wish I could recall what they were saying, I really do. At that moment, however, I was encompassed by a primal instinct that limited my mental capacity to one task. Run. I rapidly began to scoot back, kicking my legs the entire time to get the ants off of me. The entire time more ants poured out of my mattress and made the tidal wave of ants grow even higher and higher. As soon as I was able to get to my feet I turned and ran for the door. As I did so I could hear the collective ants behind me growing louder and louder. With one swift motion, I swung the door open and as I stepped into the safety of my lit hallway the voices reached their height in one last act of defiance.\n\n“ALEX!” they spoke before being cut off as I slammed the bedroom door shut. The second I did so, the voices immediately stopped. No more murmuring, no more rustling of the ants, it all simply stopped at once. I propped a chair against the bedroom door and hunkered down in my bathroom for the night.\n\nWhich finally leads us here, the present. Ever since that night, I've been holding up in my kitchen. I’ve consolidated what remaining cans of bug spray remained in my home and I've been sitting with my back to a corner of the wall for the last 3 days waiting for the swarm to return. It hasn't yet, but I can't give them an opportunity to sneak up on me. I can't risk falling asleep and letting them get me. I can't risk them getting anyone else. These demons can not be allowed to spread. I won't let them.\n\nAs I've been writing this over the last hour, the gas valve on my stove has been running the entire time. I don't know if the ants know what I'm planning but I do know that the murmuring has returned, and over the last hour it's been growing louder and louder. There's a lighter in my kitchen drawer, and as soon as I submit this story, I'm going to use it to destroy these creatures one and for all. There's a shared fire alarm system in my apartment block. I pulled it about 5 minutes ago and sincerely hope everyone within range has gotten out. I can't wait any longer. The feeling of eyes on my neck has returned and even though I've grown immune to the paralyzing effect it had on me, I know what it means. The ants are watching me. They know what I'm planning and will surely try to stop me. I'm sorry.\n\nIf there were any words of wisdom I have left in my tattered shell of a psyche, I doubt they would be of any worth. The only thing I can think of to impart onto you is this:\n\n“We like to think we are the masters of our domain, but the sobering reality is that we are masters of nothing. The creatures that inhabited this earth before us will continue to do so long thereafter. Leave them be, and if you're lucky they will do the same. And for the love of god, stay away from anthills.”",

        "text": " \n\nIt is truly amazing just how much pain the human body is able to endure with the proper motivation. For weightlifters and athletes, it’s the goal of looking better and becoming stronger that helps them push through the pain of exercise. For those trapped in the monotony of everyday office work, it is their families that keep them working day in and day out through the mental pain of never-ending paperwork. However, the one true motivator that has time and again proven to be the eternal motivator of humanity now remains trapped in my psyche like a song on an endless loop. That eternal motivator, of course, is fear. The pain it helps me push through at this very moment is that of exhaustion. You see, as I sit on my cold kitchen floor typing this out, I have made a stunning realization. I have been awake for over 3 days straight. I didn't even notice until I looked at the calendar but it's true. You'd think that with all I've endured this last month, I would have gotten somewhat used to my ordeal and the fear would have subsided even a little bit but no! It’s only gotten worse. It’s only further logged its talons in my brain and It’s the only thing keeping me awake and able to transcribe to you what has befallen me. So as I orate to you my plight I ask only one thing of you. Please, keep an open mind ok?\n\nMy name is Alex. My story begins last month in the middle of November. I would tell you where I live but there's not much point since soon enough, it won't matter. To give you some perspective on my surroundings though, let's just say in one of the southwestern states and leave it at that. I work at a car wash. Come to think of it, at the time of my writing this it'll be nearly 3 years I've been working there. It’s amazing how fast time flies when you have no aspirations in life, isn't it? You get used to a routine and are so comfortable with it that you don't even question it anymore. You just let your life slip away from you because the idea of changing anything about your routine holds the slight implication that it can all be ripped away from you and you'll have to get comfortable all over again. I did have aspirations for my life, but at one point or another, they just sorta slipped away from me. All of this is to say that I've been working this job for a very long time. I started off as a janitor and later as a cashier for the interior section. It's one of those nice car washes where you can watch your car get washed from the inside through glass. Eventually I moved my way up to the line to the point where I'm the guy who helps vacuum and dry off your car outside.\n\nIt’s more physically demanding work than I expected but the pay is significantly better than the clerical work I was doing before. Well, I'd been working that job for the last year and a half and I thought it was time for me to ask for a promotion. Not a big one mind you, I wasn't expecting to be made manager or anything, but I don't think it was out of the question to be given a job with a little more responsibility right? I knocked on my boss’s door with my speech already rehearsed in my head of various job positions I was going to remind him were available. The meeting however didn't go as planned. The speech I had planned in my head would have taken me all of 5 minutes. However, the actual conversation only lasted 2.\n\n“No” My boss interrupted at the very mention of the word promotion.\n\n“No? With all due respect, sir at least hear me out. What about my time in service here? I've logged more hours than anyone else here besides you sir” I said raising my voice slightly”\n\n“I understand the time you've put in here, and I appreciate it but what you've got to take into consideration is effort kid.”\n\n“Effort?” I replied with such disbelief that my voice may as well have been like a whisper.\n\n“Yes, Alex effort. You've put in a commendable amount of time here but Time means jack shit when you're only doing the bare minimum you understand me?” He was standing up out of his chair, leaning across the desk on his hands at this point. Staring me down with those judgemental eyes that seemed to scan me for even the slightest sign of weakness.\n\n“You think I don't see you slacking off out there every damn day? I've owned this business for a long time. I know how this job is supposed to be done. You do the bare minimum to stay employed and what you're gonna receive is the bare minimum, employment.” he said with a very serious tone.\n\nI sat there for a moment in disbelief while pondering my response. Nothing came to mind however and before I could come up with anything to say he sat back in his chair and pointed to the door behind me, ushering me out.\n\nTo say I was furious would be a colossal understatement. What little of the rest of my work day I remember was spent in a rage-filled haze that seemed to occupy every corner of my mind like a fog. “Effort?” I kept saying to myself over and over again. I mean sure, I might go on my phone every now and then during shifts but who doesn't? Sure, I may take an extra 5 minutes on my lunch break from time to time but that doesn't make me a slacker. I'm a hard worker dammit! I know I am, and for this pretentious piece of shit to claim that I wasn't. Well, let’s just say that I didn't get a very positive reception for the rest of my shift. I don't think I said hello, let alone cracked a smile at a customer for the rest of that day.\n\nAs my time at work ended and I drove home I could sense that I was still seething. My grip on the wheel seemed to tighten exponentially and I had acquired a sort of tunnel vision while driving. Similar to when you zone out and stare into nothingness. Noticing that this was probably unsafe and that I was close to my local park I decided to stop by and go for a walk to clear my head.\n\nI always liked the park. There's not much that I can confidently claim to enjoy with my life but Fishing has been and always will be one of my favorite pastimes. The lake at the park is the only notable body of water near my town so needless to say I’ve spent a lot of my free time going there.\n\nAfter a few minutes of walking the path, I decided to sit on a bench overlooking the water. I watched the light shine off the water's surface for a few peaceful moments and allowed the anger in my heart to subside until all I was left with was a feeling of pure emptiness. A feeling which was quickly refilled again with a newfound sense of depression at my situation. As the newfound grip of sadness took hold of me I leaned forward and allowed my head to fall comfortably in between my hands staring down at the ground ahead when I noticed something peculiar. There was an anthill in front of my bench across the walking path. Not an uncommon thing I know. It's a park, fair to assume there are going to be ants right? Well, I'd never seen an anthill that looked like this before. Anthill isn't even the proper term to describe it as there was no hill. Just a perfectly cylindrical hole about 2 inches in diameter in the ground that appeared to devour all of the surrounding light, making it impossible to see down into it. Coming out of the hole was what appeared to be ants. However much like their place of residence they too looked like no other ant species I can ever recall.\n\nIn the same vanity as their hill they too were as dark as dark could be. On top of that, the insects were huge. They were at least the size of the tip of a pinkie with very defined mandible teeth that jutted out from their heads quite far. I stared at them for a good 10 seconds, soaking in every detail about the colony I had stumbled across when suddenly, the rage I had suppressed earlier came back. Only now it was accompanied by the dose of sadness which had originally filled its place.\n\nI don't know what it was, something about the creatures just disgusted me on a basic primal level and it reignited that burning anger I had originally come to the park to lose in the first place. I'm usually a fairly peaceful guy but the utterly unnatural look of the creatures just disgusted me on a personal level. Becoming annoyed by the fact that these insects had disgusted me so much and reignited my anger, I stood up, kicked dirt over the hole, stomped on the anthill a few times, and set off back to my car without a second thought. As I said, I'm usually a fairly peaceful guy. However, I'd be lying if I said it didn't feel good to let out some of my pent-up aggression from that day.\n\nThe rest of my day went off without a hitch. I went back home, watched some tv, and made dinner just like any other night. Everything appeared to be normal with one exception. As I attempted to toss and turn my way to sleep that night, I could not shake the feeling that I was being watched. Now let me clarify, I'm not just talking about that feeling you get that makes people sleep with their backs to the walls or the urge to keep the back of one's neck covered up by their blankets when falling asleep. It was very deliberately, specifically the feeling of eyes being fixated upon me. A feeling made more uncomfortable by the fact that from what I could see, there was nobody in the room with me. Exhaustion is a powerful weapon however and Despite this feeling and how uncomfortable it made me, I was able to eventually get some sleep for the night.\n\nThe next morning, however, is when things officially started to get weird. You see, I live on the first floor of my apartment complex. The different rooms are laid out in a way so that there are 4 separate apartments for each section. 2 rooms on the first floor and 2 on the second with a staircase splitting down the middle, and a little stretch of dirt and grass lining the walls of each of the first-floor apartments. I never paid much mind to the stretch of dirt that lay outside my room, I've never been particularly into gardening so I had no incentive to plant anything there or to attempt to upkeep what remained of the patch of grass that clung desperately to the edge of the concrete walkway. The reason That was the first day I ever showed interest in my little patch of dirt was due to one simple detail that stuck out like an uneven shelf of books. There was a pitch-black hole, with the diameter of a golf ball perfectly centered on the patch of dirt right outside my front door.\n\nAs I locked my door and turned my head to begin walking down the strip of concrete that led to my car I found my head immediately frozen in place upon noticing it. As I stood there analyzing it I felt a cold chill run down from the base of my neck, up to the top of my head, and down to my fingertips. I can't describe what it was about the hole that creeped me out. The fact that it was blacker than any shade I had ever seen was a good enough reason but there were others. The seemingly, perfectly cylindrical shape of it gave it an unnatural appearance that made it feel like it didn't belong there, more so than it already didn't. However, the reason I felt most unnerved at that moment was due to the simple fact that I had seen this hole before, the day just before that morning to be specific. This was the same type of hole I had seen yesterday, in the park.\n\n“What the fuck?”\n\nI thought to myself as I knelt down to get a closer look at the hole. From what I could see there were no ants, or at least none visible at the moment. Never letting my eyes leave the hole, I reached my hand across the patch of dirt to grab a small twig that just so happened to be there and began to slowly lower it into the hole. The twig was a good 3 inches long but yet, the hole swallowed it up entirely to the point where I could not stick it any deeper into the hole without my fingers themselves going into the hole itself.\n\n“Just how deep does this go?” I thought to myself\n\nWith my body at the complete mercy of curiosity, I again reached over across the patch of dirt, this time picking up a small pebble. I positioned it carefully, calculating exactly where it needed to be dropped to fall perfectly into the hole.\n\n“Are you alright ?”\n\nMy thoughts were suddenly interrupted by a firm grip on my shoulder which caused me to jump damn near out of my skin. I spun around quickly only to be greeted by my 1st-floor neighbor Ron. A very tall bald man somewhere in his mid 40’s who I'm fairly certain did nothing with his free time besides chew ground beef and lift weights. Not the kind of person you'd necessarily be comfortable with grabbing you out of the blue.\n\n“Jesus Ron! You scared the shit out of me!” I stammered out between gasps.\n\n“Sorry about that neighbor,\" He said in his gravely southern voice that was so cartoonishly cowboy-esk you'd swear he just got done marathoning a collection of Yosemite Sam cartoons.\n\n\"I called your name out about 10 seconds ago but you seemed so focused on, whatever it is you were doing that I guess you didn't hear me,” he said, chuckling to himself.I collected my thoughts, steadied my emotions, and after a few short breaths responded.\n\n\"Yeah, sorry. I'm fine, I was just checking out this weird-looking hole in the ground.\"\n\nHe made a half-hearted attempt to look over my shoulder and take a peek at the odd hole I was talking about, but quickly re-straightened his posture to look back at me.\n\n\" Well alright then \"\n\nHis sentence was shortly interrupted by one of my backup alarms on my phone going off. Upon pulling out my phone I saw that this alarm, in particular, was to notify me that I had 10 minutes to be at work. I understand the seeming ridiculousness of setting an alarm so soon to my work start time but given the number of times I've fallen asleep in the parking lot waiting for my shift to start, it's always better to be safe than sorry.\n\n\"Oh shit, I'm sorry Ron! Gotta go! \"\n\nI said before quickly running off. He gave me a slight wave as he watched me sprint to my car. However, As I got in my car, threw it into reverse, and began backing up I neglected to wave back. My gaze remained fixated on the hole in my front yard the entire time I backed out.\n\nI wasn't able to make it to work on time. Just barely anyways. Through my complete and total disregard for the very concept of \"speed limits\" and a fair share of annoyed honks and middle fingers tossed in my general direction as I dodged and weaved my way through traffic like a snake; I was able to make it to work only 2 minutes late.\n\nExcept for the scolding I got from my boss for arriving late, the rest of my work day was pretty uneventful. Although I'm not sure if I should attribute that to the mundane nature of the work itself, or if I was just burnt out from the torrent of emotions I had experienced there yesterday. Whatever the case may have been, however, I was able to get through the rest of the work day without incident.\n\nI place emphasis on the rest of the “Work” day because As I pulled back into my apartment parking spot, my eyes immediately locked back onto the dark pit that sat in my front yard like an unnatural blemish. I wasn't even thinking about the hole all day at work or anything. As a matter of fact, I had totally forgotten about the morning incident maybe an hour after arriving at work. No, my attention immediately drew to the hole because I don't know. I wish I could explain it but I can't. The best way I can describe it is: like looking at the ocean. Sure, you CAN look away; but every fiber of your being compels you to continue staring for just a little bit longer. So that's exactly what I did. I stared at the hole for the majority of the walk from my car up to my front door and even then when the front door was closed, the image of it remained ever-present in my mind.\n\nAs the night drew near and I got myself ready for bed I once again found myself uncomfortable with the unshakeable feeling of eyes laid upon me. As I brushed my teeth and took my gaze away from the mirror to rinse out my mouth I got particularly large goosebumps as the feeling grew, seemingly exponentially. It continued to do so as I finally got ready to turn off the lights for bed.\n\nHowever, I was stopped dead in my tracks when I noticed Two black ants staring at me from outside my window. I know it sounds ridiculous but that's the only way I can describe their behavior. Insects congregating around a window is nothing out of the ordinary. But these were no ordinary bugs. They were undeniably the same ants I had seen that fateful day in the park. Or at the very least they were the same species. As I approached the window and leaned over to get a better look at them, their posture did not waiver. They stood steadfast like statues. Staring right back at me. Much like the day I first encountered the creatures, the mere sight of them filled my stomach with a sense of disgust I didn't know the human body was capable of conjuring. It was a deep, primal disgust that seemingly begged my arms to move on their own to shut the blinds on them to get them out of my sight. I was more than happy to oblige. The feeling of disgust passed, however As I laid my head down for bed the feeling of eyes on my back did not. It remained that way through the rest of the night.\n\nThat was the point where my life took a turn and began to rapidly derail. As I left my apartment the next day I almost instinctively looked down to check on the anthill in my front yard. Sure enough, there were 2 black ants staring at me. I watched them the entire time I walked to my car and sure enough, they did the same. Just like the night before on my windowsill. I never left their sight\n\nThis time, I did not forget about the incident while I was at work. It didn't hinder my work but it certainly occupied a larger portion of my mind this time around. By the time I pulled back into my driveway later that day, I was hesitant to point my eyes any lower than dead straight ahead of me. I knew they would be there, but that didn't change the fact I couldn't stand the sight of the vile creatures. However, curiosity is one of humanity's most powerful instincts. I fought it as best I could, but the closer I got to my door the stronger it became. Inevitably, it took hold of me. Once it did I noticed that there were now three ants guarding the anthill. As always, they stared me down the entire time until I was safely behind my front door.\n\nThat was when I decided to finally do something about the apparent infestation and called up my landlord Mitchell.\n\n\"And you're sure it's been growing? Mitchell asked with a hint of skepticism.\n\n\"I wouldn't lie to you, man. You know what they say on all those animal planet shows. If you see 2 there's a whole colony\" I retorted with all the confidence in the world.\n\n“Isn't that only a saying for rat colonies or something?\" He said with an even bigger dose of skepticism\n\n\"Look I don't know if the saying applies to all infestations. All I know is that I've been seeing more and more ants show up around my apartment so clearly, they've settled in the area. I'm not asking for much, just an exterminator visit is all you know? Get his perspective.\" I said that last line as calmly as I could. I figured the only way to get him to throw me a bone here was by making it not sound like a big expensive task.\n\nHe sighed \" alright man. I got a buddy who works for pest control. I'll tell him to swing by towards the end of his shift for a … mock inspection. You have a good night Alex\" and with that he hung up, sounding mildly annoyed at being convinced to actually do his job. The bane of any landlord's existence I suppose.\n\nThe rest of that night went fairly well compared to the previous one. I was feeling very at ease with having a professional come in to help out with the situation. On top of that, there were no ants on my windowsill like the previous night. All was right in the world until I felt the sting.\n\nAt an ungodly hour of night I can't even begin to recollect, I awoke to a sharp pain on the stretch of skin between my shoulder and neck. Upon inspection, in my bathroom mirror, I found a small red dot was the source of my pain. It hurt like hell and when I went to touch it sharp burning pain emanated from it that felt like a lit matchstick being pressed into my skin.\n\nI inspected my bed to see if I could spot the culprit. Obviously, my first reaction was to blame my newfound neighbors. I had already grown very tired of them, but bed bugs do exist. I wanted to be thorough and see if it could have been anything else. Despite my investigation efforts I found nothing and went back to sleep. Telling myself that it must just be a strange pimple of some kind. Knowing damn well that wasn't the case, but nonetheless, I was too tired to care at that moment.\n\nThe next morning as I left my apartment I did my now routine checkup on the batch of dirt in front of my apartment. There were four of them now. Sure enough, like the night I first encountered them on my windowsill, they watched my every move without so much as taking a step from their apparent guard-like positions. Just like they had done every other time thus far, filled with annoyance at the pests, I kicked up some dirt at them violently in an attempt to get them to run back into their hole. An attempt that was without reward. They didn't move an inch. They stood their ground and watched me intensely from my front door all the way to my car, and even though I could not see them while driving out of my parking lot I still felt their gaze on the back of my neck.\n\nWhen I arrived back home later that day I was relieved to see the exterminator was already hard at work, crouched down alongside my windowsill spraying some form of poison along the edges and underside of my wall.\n\n“Hey man, thanks for helping me out,” I said as I walked slightly to the side of him whilst twirling my keys. He pulled out his earbuds and looked over at me\n\n“I'm sorry, did you say something?” he uttered. I sighed, rolled my eyes internally, and began again.\n\n“This is my place, your um … \"I struggled to think of the word to describe the procedure the man was in the middle of.\n\n“Pest controlling?” I said, shrugging my shoulders.\n\n“ Oh! You must be Alex!” he chuckled to himself.\n\n“Yes sir, I was notified of a possible ant infestation so I'm just laying some pesticides around all possible entry points into your home. All natural neem oil pesticides so they are nontoxic to you and any possible pets you may have.” I nodded along pretending to have a clue what he was talking about.\n\n“ That's awesome man, just make sure you get the anthill in the front yard too.”\n\nHe leaned his head over past my shoulder to scout the rest of the front yard.\n\n“Don't you worry sir, I'll be sure to hit up any possible entry points as well as possible nest spots. As I go along” he said with a smile. After about 15 minutes he knocked on my door, informed me that he was done and to keep an eye out for any more ants, and left. I breathed a sigh of relief and quickly had my nerves out to rest. Finally, with some peace of mind, I was able to enjoy the remainder of my night relaxing with some video games and staying up late due to my day off the following day. All was right in the world. Until I laid my head on my pillow, and I felt the familiar gaze of eyes on the back of my head.\n\nThe following morning was as mundane as mundane could be. After sleeping in for what felt like the first time in weeks I Woke up, went about my morning routine, and sat on my couch watching some TV while thinking about what to do with my day. Eventually settling on going out to see a movie that I wasn't exactly dying to watch. I just couldn't think of anything better to do. A plan that was quickly cut short by the discovery of a new anthill on my front lawn.\n\nAbout a foot away from the original and closer to my apartment lay an almost identical-looking copy of the strange anthill that had lived rent-free on my lawn for far too long. I was stopped dead in my tracks upon my discovery of it and was immediately met with a wave of annoyance at its existence.\n\n\"Fucking christ Mitchell. Some exterminator friend you've got\" I thought to myself.\n\nWith a deep sigh, I resigned myself to a day of exterminating rather than relaxation and set off for my local hardware store to buy some bug killer. I wasn't exactly sure what to look for to help deal with my particular infestation. Eventually, however, I settled on a can of bug spray made for ants as well as a few of those little plastic bait traps that ants are supposed to inadvertently poison the entire colony with.\n\nAgain, I was not an exterminator by any means so I had no idea how to go about using the equipment I had just acquired. I figured that if I sprayed a copious amount of the bug spray along the bottom of my door frame and along my window sills, that would keep them from entering my apartment. As for the ant bait traps I just placed one outside both of the 2 anthills and figured they would have to investigate them eventually.\n\nAfter that little side quest, I was finally able to enjoy the remainder of my day off. Or at least a fair portion of it. It was around 7 pm when I was sitting on my couch watching TV, just nearly drifting off to sleep that I felt a sting. It rattled my whole body from the back of my neck all the way down to the left side of my foot and caused me to nearly jump out of my skin with pain.\n\nI instinctually stood up and threw off my shirt in an attempt to get what I assumed was one of my ant neighbors off of me and began throwing my shirt over my shoulders to try to swat it off. I did this a few times before realizing I was safe and there was nothing attached to me. I looked and looked and there wasn't any ant to be seen on the couch either. I made sure to pull out every cushion, move the couch and even check the surrounding furniture and I still found nothing. When I went to investigate my back in the bathroom mirror I couldn't see a sting mark either. A fact that was not relieving in the slightest. I didn't sleep much that night. I could still feel eyes on the back of my neck no matter which way I faced as I tossed and turned.\n\nAs I woke up the next morning I had a sense of looming dread hanging over my head that I couldn't shake. A sense of dread that was different mind you than the usual morning blues before one gets ready for work. As I closed my front door I took a deep breath and turned around to check on the anthills. To my complete and utter shock, they were gone. I couldn't believe it. For a few moments, I just stood there racking my brain for answers.\n\n\"Did they move out or something?\" I thought to myself, unable to come up with any rational answer. \"Did my traps work that fast? Even if they did the holes wouldn't be this covered up so soon\" I thought to myself.\n\nMy ant traps were still there, looking quite lonely without any trace of an ant colony to accompany them. I chuckled to myself a little bit out of relief that it looked like my infestation problem had taken care of itself and set off for work.\n\nA comforting fact. So why the fuck did I still feel it? That uneasiness I had felt that morning was still there. It hadn't grown, it hadn't decreased, it just remained there. A constant emotion in the back of my mind from the time I woke up, all throughout work, and even now as I had visual confirmation that my intruders were gone it remained. I opened my front door and stepped inside. The 2 black ants sitting on my kitchen table turned their heads to face my direction and stared at me.\n\nIn an instant, I felt my blood turn to ice and felt a cold chill run down my spine that seemingly paralyzed me in the doorway of my own home. I had never felt so uneasy in my entire life as I did at that moment. As I stood there frozen with fear, all the moments that had led up to this moment in time raced through my mind. The encounter at the park, the mysterious anthills, the windowsill encounter, and the dread I felt when I looked at these damn bugs all played back in my mind.\n\n\"Something is very wrong here.\" I thought to myself.\n\nThese were no ordinary bugs. That much was clear from their appearance alone, I had figured out that much and accepted it long ago. I'm not talking about that though. On an almost instinctual, primal level that I couldn't comprehend at that moment in time, something was simply very wrong.\n\nWhen I eventually regained my wits, I began to walk past the table and to my fridge to retrieve a paper towel. The entire time their heads followed my every move, and I in return did not dare let the cursed insects out of my sight. With one swift motion, I yanked a paper towel off from its roll and smushed the bugs before they could escape. Their smushed remains left an unusual amount of black liquid on my paper towel that seemed unnaturally copious for something so small. I threw their remains away and pulled out my phone.\n\n“ I need the exterminator back here Mitchell. I don't know what kind of “consultation” you had this guy run for me but it clearly wasn't enough because there in my fucking house now”\n\n“You mean the ants?” he retorted\n\n“No, the fucking lawn gnomes YES, the ants Mitchel Jesus!” I spat back at him.\n\nHe took a long deep sigh. Even though I had no visual indication, I knew him well and could tell just from the sign that he was at that very moment rubbing his forehead out of annoyance like he always did.\n\n“Alright alright, ill call him just calm the fuck down kid. I'll text you his response ok?” He sounded very irritated at that last remark.\n\n“Sure, thanks,” I said before abruptly hanging up.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes I got a text from Mitchell that read: “He’s all booked up. Says he can do it 2 days from now at the earliest.”\n\nI replied back almost immediately “2 days? That's not soon enough man! You gotta find me, someone, to get here sooner!”\n\n“He's the cheapest one in town, Alex. He's the one I'm going with. You'll be fine until then, they’re just some fucking ants”\n\nI threw my phone at the wall out of frustration and slumped against the kitchen counter, almost immediately regretting that decision before frantically going to check the damage. Just a crack on the screen. As I sat there kneeling I took a very long deep breath to clear my head.\n\n“Ok,” I said to myself before standing up, and calling in sick to my boss for the following day.\n\nThe following “sick day” was spent doing what, in my mind, can only be described as a full-on war. I returned from the hardware store with 2 bags in hand that were filled with more of those plastic ant bait traps, stick traps, and bug spray. I spent a good hour placing the various traps throughout my home in high-traffic areas where I thought the ants liked to travel. I sprayed down more bug spray along the windowsill and doorway and when I was satisfied with that, I laid down even more ant traps.\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say maybe … 20 traps in total were scattered around my house. A number that is certainly overkill to anyone who wasn't privy to my situation, but it wasn't so comically overkill that one would look into my home and one would immediately write me off as a lunatic.\n\nI half expected the ants to at some point come out and try to stop me. To stand in my way, move my traps, and even commit their usual crime of simply watching me. Not only did none of this occur, however, but I didn't see them at all that day. Not on my kitchen counter, not on my window, not anywhere. As I laid my head down for bed that night I still felt the now all too familiar eyes on the back of my neck. Aside from that though, it was like they were finally gone.\n\nWhereas the previous day I awoke feeling unbearable dread, the day after I had gone to war with the ants greeted me with a sense of optimism I had long since forgotten existed. There were, once again, no signs of the cursed bugs anywhere. As I left my home and walked to my car there were still no anthills to be seen. My ant traps were still laid in my front yard and I reminded myself to pick them up when I returned from work. As I pulled out of my driveway and began driving to work I found myself in such a good mood that I even found myself singing along a little to the songs on the radio. A state of mind that I truly had not felt in what felt like ages. A feeling that immediately melted away as I noticed the ant crawling around on my hand.\n\nTime slowed down and with what felt like one swift motion I smacked it off of my hand with the other, causing me to turn my car sharply to the left and nearly end up off of the road. I waited for the annoyed honks to pass me by until it was safe to pull over and once I was able to, I jumped out of my car and began to furiously pat down my body in search of any more ants. I found none, however, except for the now-dead one that lay on the dashboard of my car. After removing its corpse from my car I spent a good 10 minutes checking every nook and cranny of my car to see if I could find any more of them. When and only when I was certain that there was absolutely no chance of the insects hiding anywhere in my vehicle, I finally set off to work in complete silence.\n\nI honestly don't remember if anybody talked to me at work that day. Whether it be because I was so trapped in my own head I didn't notice anyone's attempts or because I must've looked like a nervous wreck and simply nobody wanted to. Either way, fear was my only companion that working day. The feeling that used to only accompany me as I laid my head down to sleep at night now made itself present at work. The entire day I kept randomly slapping my extremities at even the faintest itching sensation. I'm sure I looked like a madman, but I couldn't help it. I was paranoid that they had followed me to work and at certain points, I even mistook the pain of a random muscle cramp for one of their stings. It was a very long day at work to say the absolute least.\n\nWhen I pulled back into my apartment driveway the feeling of being watched grew so intense that it nearly made my eyes water up from the cold chill that ran down my spine. It took me a few seconds to muster up the courage to step out of my car and began walking to my front door. As soon as I did, I checked my front lawn. Still no anthills. This was not a comforting discovery. I had no more optimism about the situation and knew that this did not mean they were gone. It simply meant they had moved in.\n\n“The exterminator comes tomorrow,” I told myself in an attempt to remain calm. An attempt that had not a hint of sincerity behind it.\n\nPain, pain was all that I felt as I was ripped out of my sleep at an hour of night I can't even begin to remember. Though it was pitch black in my room and I had no visual confirmation, I knew what the culprit was immediately. The stinging sensation was the same as I had felt on the back of my neck many days ago. What was different about this time however was the area of effect. It felt like the pain was everywhere on my body all at once. As quickly as I woke up and as quickly as I recognized the source of the pain, I leaped out of bed and yanked on my desk lamp cord. My desk lamp fell to the ground and its light shone straight up at my ceiling, illuminating the room with many mysterious shadows that seemed to surround me on all sides. It was enough light to see my current situation, however. Dozens, maybe even hundreds of ants had swarmed all over my body.\n\nI immediately began to swat, slap, spin, and do everything in my power to shake loose the insects, all the while they continued to sting me over and over again. They felt like hot staples being driven into my skin and they were happening multiple times a second. The pain was so excruciating I felt like I was going to pass out or throw up at any second. As I spun in circles, shaking the ants loose from me, I noticed there were 2 ants sitting on my nightstand. Just like the day at the park, my house, and my kitchen, they watched me. Despite my frantic and fast movements in all directions, they stood steadfast like statues. Watching me writhe around in agony the entire time. I eventually had gotten enough of them off of me to the point where I could grab a can of ant spray I had kept in a corner of the room. Almost instantly, I felt the stinging stop. \n\nThe pain didn't, but I could feel no new stinging occurring. As I looked down I noticed the ants fleeing from me. The ants on the nightstand were no longer there and the ones who were just attacking me a moment ago were now scurrying across the floor away from me as fast as they could. They weren't fast enough. They were resilient though. On average I'd say each ant took about a 3-second spray to fully stop moving. I honestly think I used up half the damn bottle that night. It's not like I was in any state of mind to have used the thing sparingly. I simply held down the spray button, and I didn't let go until I saw no more signs of life in my room. When it was all finally over, I counted 85 stings all over my body. They covered my chest, arms, legs, back and neck. It took a little while but after I was done cleaning the ant corpses from my room I decided to take a hot bath to try to soothe my writhing body, and promptly passed out in my bathtub from the pain",

        "text": " I awoke to the sound of a knock on my front door followed by a familiar “Hello?”. It took a few moments for me to comprehend my situation. I had a splitting headache like I'd never felt before. The pain from my stings might not have been as severe as they were last night but it was still present. On top of all of this, I had fallen asleep in my bathtub and had slept at such an agonizingly weird angle that my legs had fallen completely asleep. On top of all of this, I now had a severe neck cramp. I swear it took all the willpower in my body just to recognize that the person knocking at my door was the exterminator and with all the energy I could muster I shouted as loud as I could “I'll be right there!”.\n\nLuckily, my bathtub is a piece of shit. Over the course of last night, my water had slowly drained off by itself so I wasn't a completely sopping wet pruney mess. It still took me a few minutes to eventually open the door for the exterminator though as I had to get dressed, down 3 aspirin, and splash some cold water on my face.”\n\n“Are you ok there ?” he said as I opened the door. I imagine that my delayed response toppled with the ghastly appearance I must have exhibited aroused a fair amount of concern.\n\n“Hey man, I'm sorry for taking so long. I had a rough night and slept in.” I said while reeling from the sunlight that was now piercing my eyes and seemingly stabbing me in the brain in a way that caused me to wince in pain.\n\n“Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that sir.” He said, sounding genuinely concerned. \"\" what happened? If you don't mind me asking”\n\nI told him the story as I walked him to my room. Neglecting to tell him the part about the ants standing on my nightstand watching the entire event occur.\n\n“ Oh my word! That sounds awful! Well don't you worry sir, I'll make sure we take care of this problem today,” he said, patting my shoulder in an attempt to comfort me.\n\nAs he began to inspect my room he noted the number of ant traps I had strewn about my house. With a slightly concerned tone, he told me“If you've really taken all these actions that you say you have, then my only conclusion is they must have a nest somewhere in the walls or, maybe even under the floorboard.”\n\nWe talked for a little bit about options and where to proceed. Eventually deciding to drill holes into my walls at key locations to lay down bait traps and spray pesticides. Once he was done he bid me farewell and left. I followed shortly after and headed to work.\n\nAs I arrived back at my house later that day I instinctively checked the stretch of dirt outside my front door. When I did so, I found 2 new Anthills. Fear, annoyance, and any other emotion I had felt towards my intruders up until that point all faded away, and were replaced with pure unadulterated rage.\n\n“God Damn It!” I shouted before kicking up dirt all over the hills.\n\n“God Fucking Dammit!” I shouted a little louder as I began to viciously stomp on the two anthills over and over again to the point where I swear if there were some sort of cave underneath the hills, I would have broken through the earth itself and fallen in. After about 7 good stomps I found myself a little out of breath and while standing over the hills turned to face the road. A Woman who was walking her dog stood there with a look of confusion mixed with a hint of fear. I raised my hand to attempt to explain myself but before I could do so, she fled down the sidewalk. Leaving me alone with my unwanted guests.\n\n“Fuck” i muttered to myself before kicking dirt over the now decamated anthills, and heading inside.\n\nI couldn't get to sleep that night. I remember specifically the feeling of being watched was more intense that night than it had ever been up until that point. It mattered not if I faced the wall, away from it, or straight up, I couldn't evade it. With a deep sigh and a rub of my eyes, I resigned myself to go watch some tv for a few hours in hopes of passing out somewhere down the road. I sat on the edge of my bed and turned on my nightstand lamp.\n\nAs the light illuminated my room and I could now see my surroundings, I spotted them. Just like the night before, there were once again 2 sentinel ants watching me from my nightstand. Remembering the horror of the night before I immediately patted down my body, expecting to be covered with the ants once again. I quickly realized however that there were none to be found. I slowly turned my gaze up from my body to the ants and knelt forward to get a closer look at them. They stood there staring back at me, and soon enough it was as if we were both analyzing each other.\n\n“What the fuck are you?” I muttered to myself.\n\nI stretched my hand out and hovered it above the ants in an attempt to get them to move. They did not.\n\n“Why don't you react?” I asked as  I began to rapidly wave my hand back and forth above them.\n\nFinally, in a bid of frustration, I stood up and made a swatting motion toward the ants like I was about to smash them onto my table. They finally reacted and moved backward to avoid my hand. I stopped my hand midair however and chuckled to myself.\n\n“I got you, little bastards,” I said, moving my hand backward.\n\nThe ants stood there staring at me back. After a few seconds that seemed to drag on for hours, I laughed to myself about the craziness of what was happening. Eventually, I shook my head to snap myself from the never-ending staring contest and went to the floor by the foot of my bed to grab a can of bug spray. When I turned around to rid myself of the ants, however, they were gone. As if they saw what I was about to do and fled before I could take action. I spent the remainder of that night watching god-awful late-night television Eventually passing out somewhere around 3 am.\n\nThe sound of my backup alarm going off finally woke me up. I immediately recognized it as the alarm I used for when I would sleep in the parking lot of the car wash.\n\n“Oh, shit” I muttered to myself before rolling off my couch and making a mad dash for my keys and shoes. I had 10 minutes to be at a place that was nearly a 25-minute drive away.\n\nAs I started speeding my way to work, in a vain attempt to somehow make it there in time, I began to rehearse my “I'm sorry” speech to my boss. I say  ‘began” because I was quickly interrupted by the sensation of a sting on the back of my neck. Then another, then another, then another just like 2 nights ago I began to feel stinging all over my body. I jerked and twisted my body in response to the newfound pain but it did little to ease my situation. I started to see them crawling all over my hands and arms. How they had gotten into my car was a question I couldn't begin to think about at that moment in time. I looked into the rear view mirror and could see them all over my neck and shoulders. They were swarming me and stinging me all over my body. Once the realization of what was going on settled into my mind and the pain began to permeate every square inch of me I started wildly swatting all over my body in a vain attempt to free myself from the ants. Causing my car to begin swerving erratically all over the road. A particularly large sting nipped my in the patch of skin between my left shoulder and neck. Acting on pure instinct I lunged over to attempt to swat the ant stinging me there. When I did so, the motion of my arm caused my elbow to lean across the steering wheel, and send my already speeding car straight into one of the old oak trees that lined the road.\n\nI awoke in the hospital a few hours later with a cast on my right forearm and a headache that made the one from the day before seem like a fleeting memory. The doctors told me that I had a concussion, a fractured rib, and had broken my wrist in 3 spots upon impact with the tree. When they asked me what happened I opened my mouth to tell them, but quickly closed it as I realized that the pain from the stings were completely gone. I pulled up the medical robe I was in and looked down at my chest. There was nothing. No sting marks or any other indication that the ants had ever attacked me in the car.\n\n“How long was I out?” I asked the doctor.\n\n“You've been knocked out for about” he stopped to pull up his watch “ 8 hours now”.\n\n“Did the stings fade away that fast?” I thought to myself. “ They were gone in the morning yesterday too.”\n\n“I uh,” I thought to myself for a moment about what to say. “ I fell asleep at the wheel,” I said, trying to sound as honest as I could. There was no proof that I was attacked by the vile creatures. They had made sure of it. I couldn't tell them “ i was swarmed by and attacked by ants.'' when there was no proof of the event ever occurring. They'd think I was high or something.\n\n“ That's what we thought,” he said as he began to write onto a clipboard.” your bloodwork came back clear of alcohol so we figured it had to be something else. Well son you're gonna be getting all the sleep you could ever dream for. When you never showed up for work your boss called your phone and we answered it for you. We told him what happened and he told us to tell you that you're going to be getting 2 weeks of paid leave while you recover a little. He said he'll have you doing light duty when you get back, something about a cash register I think.”\n\nI chuckled to myself and nodded. After a day of evaluation, I was allowed to return home. I had to call a taxi however, my car was rendered undriveable by the accident.\n\nAs I opened the door to my home, dread didn't even begin to describe the emotion that swept over me like a tidal wave.  It was the most soul crushing sense of impending doom I had ever known in my entire life. As I closed my front door it only grew more intense. After a few moments of standing there, taking in the dimly lit apartment, I slowly lowered myself into my couch and stared at the powered-off tv. As I did so, I spotted the ant that was running along the top of my tv. A newfound sense of anger boiled up within me and with one swift motion I grabbed my tv remote and chucked it at the ant. I had to use my left hand however due to the cast, which caused the remote to fly dead center at my tv screen, resulting in my tv being now effectively dead. I sat there in stunned silence for a few moments before dropping to my knees and beginning to hyperventilate.\n\n“Think man, think!” I said to myself between strained breaths trying to calm myself down.\n\n“What the fuck do I do ?'' I exclaimed in the vague hope some invisible higher power would tell me the answer and rid me of this nightmare. When no such enlightenment came and I had finally caught my breath, I sat back against the bottom of the couch and called the exterminator once more.\n\n“So what are my options now?” I asked after informing him that the ant problem had still not gone away.\n\n“Well, if the infestation truly has lingered on this long my suggestion would be attempting fumigation of your apartment,” he said\n\n“Fumigation?” I asked\n\n“Yes sir, the only 2 problems with that being that 1) it's a very lengthy and expensive process and 2) since you're in an apartment complex with other tenants living all around you, you would need to get them to sign off on it. Specifically you would need at least 2 neighboring tenants to sign off on having seen the infestation along with you. That way we could fumigate the whole apartment block that you're on.”\n\nI sat there in silence for a moment. Contemplating who to ask for a signature, and also contemplating whether or not a fumigation would even work at all.\n\n“Ask your neighbors for their signatures sir, as soon as you've gotten them give me a call back and i'll work out the details for the procedure with your landlord” he said sounding a bit impatient with my silence”\n\n“Will do,\" I muttered before placing my phone down and sinking deeper into the floor. I could still see the ant watching me from on top of the tv. I walked by it and headed to my bedroom to sleep, it was all I wanted to do at that moment.\n\n“Wake up”\n\nI was awoken a few hours later by a voice whose origin I had no earthly idea came from. I looked around my room but saw nothing. After sitting upright in my bed ,staring into the darkness of my room for a few seconds I shrugged it off as a dream and reluctantly slowly lowered my head back onto my pillow. The second I made contact with it I heard it again.\n\n“I said wake up!” the voice sounded annoyed this time.\n\nI willingly obeyed its command and with one motion shot straight out of bed and turned on my light. Half executing to see an ax wielding murder of some kind standing beside me I was taken aback to discover not an indication of life inside of my room. After sitting in the light for a few tense moments I began to feel my eyes water up as a cold chill ran down my spine. The feeling of eyes on the back of my neck was so strong I swear it was as if someone had placed a blanket over it. I wanted nothing more in that moment than to cower back into my bed and hide under the covers, but I knew what I had heard. Someone was in my house, and I had to protect myself. I slowly owned my dresser drawer and took out my only means of protecting myself at that given moment, a small leatherman multi-tool, retracted the pitifully small knife attachment from it and began to sweep my house. I took it one room at a time. \n\nBedroom,\n\nClear.\n\nHallway,\n\nClear.\n\nBathroom,\n\nClear. \n\nOne at a time I made sure every square inch of my house was without any intruder. Eventually, I checked everywhere. Every room of my home lay baked in lights. Yet I found no one. This did nothing to calm my fears, as I stood in the center of my hallway I turned my head to the side, knife hand outstretched as I began to listen for any movement of the intruder. \n\n“Alex” the voice whispered\n\nI spun around so fast I didn't have time to bend my arm inward and when I swung I ended up leaving a cut mark on the left side of my hallway wall. There was no one there.\n\nI quickly spun back around the other way and began to slowly back myself out of the hallway and into the living room to make a break for the front door. When I reached the end of the hallway I thought I stopped dead in my tracks. The feeling of eyes was so strong at this point that I no longer felt it on my neck. It was everywhere.  My entire body shuddered with fear as everywhere all at once on my body I felt like I was being watched. I couldn't breathe, I just stood there frozen. Had the chill running down my spine not paralyzed me with fear I might have been able to taste the salt from the tears that were now running down both of my eyes. It was however not a factor at all at that moment. The only thing in my mind was a primal instinct to sprint for the door and leave. Yet I just stood there.\n\n“You took our home, Alex. It is only fair that we get to take yours.\" The voice spoke.\n\nI didn't know what to do. I wanted to make a run for it but the voice sounded so close to me that for all I knew the intruder was right behind me blocking off the door. \n\n“Where the fuck is he?” I thought to myself. \n\n“Where are you!” I began to ask the question out loud as intimidatingly as I could muster at that moment, when I was struck with a sudden epiphany. The voice sounded like it was right on top of me…\n\nI slowly turned my gaze to the right side of my body. The ant sitting on my shoulder stared back at me.\n\n“Alex,” the ant said once more.\n\nI felt bile rise in the back of my throat but forced it back down as I swiftly swatted the ant off of me and dropped to the floor, crawling back and watching it from the hallway wall. For a while, it struggled on its back but eventually, It found its equilibrium and got back onto its feet. Staring at me for a few moments before running under my couch and leaving me alone with my thoughts and fears. Soon after, the ant fled from my sight and I went to the bathroom to vomit. I slept in the bathtub that night. I didn't plan on doing so, but I spent so long hiding there that exhaustion must have eventually seized me. \n\nThe following day was spent living in what I can only begin to describe as all-encompassing fear. I quite simply just didn't know what to do. A part of me didn't believe the event of last night had truly happened at all and had chalked it up to a bad dream. The other part of me thought I was crazy. Even the smallest part of my psyche that believed the ordeal last night had occurred didn't know what to do. So I did nothing. So for a long time, I sat in my living room, trying to watch tv through the bottom left peephole that was the only part of the device that still worked anymore. I wasn't even truly trying to watch tv. Most of my mental energy was spent scanning the corners of my vision for any sight of the creatures and trying to think of a plan. After a few hours of anxiety-filled torment, I pulled out my phone and began to look for apartment ads near me. \n\n“Nothing,” I thought to myself.\n\nTo be more specific, nothing within my affordability. As I thought the word to myself I quickly found my thoughts interrupted by a familiar voice.\n\n“Run if you wish. We will follow. You owe us a home.” the voice spoke.\n\nI quickly scurried away from my couch and sat in the center of my living room floor as I attempted to make out the source of the voice. I felt my heart sink into the bottom of my stomach when I realized the voice was coming from all around me at once. As if my own walls were talking to me. Not knowing what to do I went to lie down in the bathtub.\n\nLike the night before I must have fallen asleep from exhaustion because the next thing I remember was waking up freezing from being in the tub for so long. For a while, I sat there contemplating what to do. I eventually pulled out my phone and called up mitchell\n\n“Alex! How are you man?”he asked. “I heard about that accident you got into. I tried calling a couple of days ago but you must've not heard me or some-”\n\n“I'm fine Mitchell,” I interrupted. “Thanks for the concern. listen, i was wondering if you had any other exterminators you could call or … I don't know, just anybody else who might actually be willing to help me out?”\n\nHe said nothing at first. “Exterminator? You mean for that ant problem you said you were having?\n\nAfter a few seconds of annoyed silence on my half I spoke up. “Yeah, THAT ant problem. Listen, the guy you've been having see me hasn't really helped the problem at all. He says he could fumigate the apartment block but i'd have to get people to -”\n\n“Fumigate?” he interrupted, sounding very surprised. “Woah woah, slow down there bud. Nobody's fumigating anything.”\n\n“Look I know it's an expensive process and god forbid you actually help take care of your tenants Mitchell, but I have a serious problem at my apartment and your guy hasn't done shit for me!” I yelled back at him.\n\n“My “guy” happens to be a very respected exterminator kid.” he said, sounding very annoyed.” If he says we gotta fumigate then by all means we’ll fumigate, but not until you offer up some solid fucking evidence of an infestation! “\n\n“What?” I asked.\n\n“I like to think I have been very patient with you and this entire situation Alex, but I am done wasting the exterminator's time with routine checkups to your apartment!” he said.\n\n“What are you talking about?” I asked.\n\n“What am I talking about? Kid, the guy didn't wanna be rude to your face and say you didn't have a problem. The truth is though that the last 2 times he's been over there he's called me back to complain about you wasting his time with an imaginary ant problem. He said that Every time he's been over to your place, he's never found any ants or signs of them being there.” he said \n\n“That .. that's not” I began before stopping mid-sentence.\n\n“Alex. Are you alright?” he asked softly.\n\nI hung up and set off to go talk to my neighbors.\n\n“Nope.” \n\n“Nope.”\n\n“Are you ok? You look terrible? Also nope” \n\nThese were essentially the answers I got from everyone in my apartment block. Not even my next-door neighbors said they had seen any signs of an ant infestation. The closest I got was one of the guys who lived 2 doors down saying he saw a few ants outside his house last week but that was it. I didn't have the signatures I needed to get the fumigation approved. I didn't have anywhere to go. With no other options, I went back to my apartment and slowly sank into the couch. \n\nThe way the living room lights illuminated my surroundings made my reflection very visible on the broken tv. The crack mark lay situated over the right side of my face. As I stared deeply into the tv I found my eyes going fuzzy. As if I were staring off into the space behind the tv. As I did this, I noticed the ants crawling up my legs from my reflection. Without ever once physically looking down at my body, I just stared straight ahead and watched them slowly swallow me up to my abdomen. It was as if I was disassociating from the world. The ants crawled even higher. Never once stinging me, just slowly enveloping my body. They eventually stopped once they reached my shoulders. Without actually looking down it was impossible to tell but there had to be at least a thousand of them on me.\n\n“We are your problem, not theirs.” the ants all seemed to speak in unison.\n\nMy fugue-like state was quickly broken and reality came crashing down onto me like an anvil from up high as I stood straight up and began to swat them all away. When they were all finally off of me I stood there and watched them scatter in all directions to safety. \n\nOnce they were all gone the voice spoke from all directions yet again. \n\n“So be it.”\n\nI clenched my one good hand into a fist and screamed out in a mixture of frustration, fear, and anger that all seemed to rise up at once.\n\n“Get out of my house!” I screamed before going to the kitchen to grab the hammer from under the sink” \n\n“Get the fuck out of here!” I yelled as I swung the hammer into the wall above my living room couch”\n\n“Where the fuck are you little demons? Get out! “ I screamed as I swung my hammer from wall to wall. Occasionally I would see a few of the ants in the holes I created before they would quickly scurry deeper into the walls to evade me. I attempted to hit them as soon as I saw them but they were fast and more often than not my hammer missed the same spot and I would just end up leaving a fresh hole instead.\n\nHow long this went on for I honestly do not recall. I was locked in the jaws of anger and completely at its mercy. The only thing I wanted at that moment was the death of the ants who had tormented my life and invaded my sanctuary for far too long. I only stopped due to the pounding on my door.\n\n“What the fuck is going on in here?” my neighbor  Ron yelled at me through the door sounding very annoyed. “ It sounds like a damn tornado over here!”. I placed the hammer on my table and opened the door.\n\n“Hey ro-” I was quickly interrupted. \n\n“Don't you “Hey Ron, me! What the fuck is going on in this house ? sounded like you were tryna tackle your way through the damn wall!” \n\n“ Im … sorry” I began “I was just trying to … kill a few ants.” \n\nHe stared at me in disbelief for a few seconds before speaking. “Ants? Coulda told me you were fighting a tiger in here. Id've believed you too.”\n\n“I know I know I'm sorry,” I said, choked up with embarrassment. Rons sudden arrival had completely snapped me out of my rage-filled haze and as I looked to my left to survey my handy work,  I was now appalled by the scene I had created in my home. We stared at each other for a few more moments as I couldn't think of anything else to say other than feeble apologies. Eventually, I said the only thing I could think of.\n\n“Ron, you haven't seen any ants around your home have you?”\n\nHe looked over my shoulder, and judging from the widening of his eyes and the pale look on his face, it was safe to assume he could see what I had done too.\n\n“No … no I haven't,” he said slowly backing up “ if I hear you going ape shit like that ever again so help me I will call the cops Alex!” \n\nWith that, he backed up all the way into his apartment and left me there alone in the doorway. I slowly closed the door, took a few steps back into my living room, and dropped to my knees. As soon as I did so, my walls began to start murmuring. I once again decided to make a phone call.\n\n“Hello? Alex, is that you?” my boss asked. “What can I do for you? You're supposed to be resting.”\n\n“Yeah, I know I know,” I replied. “ Listen, I know I still have about a week's worth of leave left but do you think it would be ok if I came back to work early? I've been feeling really cooked up and I just really need to get out of this house and focus on something else.”\n\n“Something other than what?” he asked\n\n“ Umm, something other than … tv” I weakly replied.\n\nHe took a deep breath and said “well you know i'd never turn down help around the carwash, but unfortunately you coming back early would be a liability.\n\n“A liability? I asked” the murmuring had grown louder\n\n“Yeah, a liability” he reiterated. “ the hospital said you need at least weeks of rest. If I were to let you come back to work and you hurt yourself somehow, I'd be held accountable for it”\n\n“ Sir, please let me come back” my eyes began to start watering. “ I promise you I'll be extra careful I'll … I’ll do cash register duty or whatever else you think is safest just please let me come back early,\" I begged him.\n\nHe replied “I'm sorry kid but no can do, you enjoy your rest and I'll see you next week” \n\n“Wait!” I said before being cut off by the click of him hanging up.\n\nI chucked the phone across the room and watched it shatter as it hit the kitchen wall, and slowly crawled backwards to rest my head against the front door. From where I was sitting I could see a dozen ants or so devouring a half-eaten bag of chips on my kitchen table. With no more options at my disposal and a newfound sense of hopelessness, I ignored the ants and walked to my bedroom to go to sleep. What else was there to do?\n\nI didn't go to sleep that night, I just lay there flat on my bed staring straight up at my ceiling. The murmuring in my walls had never ceased. It continued on and on for a couple of hours until eventually, all at once it stopped. No more whispers or indistinguishable voices could be heard from all around me anymore. I took a deep breath and rolled over to face away from the wall and finally try to get some sleep. My plans were interrupted by the discovery of a single ant watching me from my nightstand. Almost instantly I shot out of bed and stood up. After a few tense seconds, I spoke to it first.\n\n“I'm sorry. Is that what you want to hear? I'm sorry! I destroyed your home and I'm sorry!” \n\nThe ant said nothing. It just stared back at me.\n\n“Say something!” I shouted at it impatiently “what do you want from me!”\n\nAfter a few more seconds of silence, the ant finally spoke. “ You owe us a home, Alex.”\n\nAs soon as the words were spoken the murmuring began again, only not from any of my walls this time, but from one clearly identifiable origin point. The voices were coming from my bed. As I made this discovery I slowly opened up my dresser drawer and pulled out my leatherman pocket knife and one of my many cans of bug spray and slowly approached the side of the bed. The ant on my dresser moved closer to inspect what I was doing but said nothing. With the bug spray being held out in my damaged arm I aimed it at the bed and slowly began to cut a hole in the side of my mattress. As the seams of it came apart I was met with the discovery of a sea of black made up of hundreds of thousands of ants that began to rapidly dart away in all directions.\n\nI immediately recoiled in disgust and as I dropped to the floor I began to spray the poison wildly in front of me, desperate to kill the ants. My actions were quickly interrupted by a loud voice that spoke with more malice and hatred than I knew existed in the world.\n\n“YOU WILL NOT HARM ANOTHER NEST!” \n\nAs the voice spoke I felt the walls around me start to rumble. As they did so the murmuring grew louder and before I could even register what the voices ants were saying, A large black tentacle shot out of the hole I had cut into the side of the mattress. It lashed out at me like the finger of Satan himself and as it swat across my chest I was able to see that it wasn't a tentacle at all. It was hundreds of thousands of ants all coalesced into a single tentacle-like shape. The tentacle writhed and swung wildly at me but maintained its shape the entire time. as I lay there on the floor looking up in horror, I Couldn't believe what I was seeing. The ants were moving with a shared consciousness. Acting on instinct I scrambled back onto one knee and began to douse the mass of ants with my can of bug spray. This had seemingly no effect, however. Apart from a few dozen ants falling to the floor, the ants held their structure steady. After a few seconds of my retaliation, the tentacle quickly shot even further out of the mattress and began to grow and grow and grow. Never taking my finger off of the spray button I simply fell back to the floor in horror as I watched the tentacle morph into an indistinguishable black tidal wave that began to envelop my entire field of vision, and soon after my legs. The stinging began almost immediately and as the pain in my legs became so intense I felt like I was going to pass out, the murmuring turned to screaming. I wish I could recall what they were saying, I really do. At that moment, however, I was encompassed by a primal instinct that limited my mental capacity to one task. Run. I rapidly began to scoot back, kicking my legs the entire time to get the ants off of me. The entire time more ants poured out of my mattress and made the tidal wave of ants grow even higher and higher. As soon as I was able to get to my feet I turned and ran for the door. As I did so I could hear the collective ants behind me growing louder and louder. With one swift motion, I swung the door open and as I stepped into the safety of my lit hallway the voices reached their height in one last act of defiance.\n\n“ALEX!” they spoke before being cut off as I slammed the bedroom door shut. The second I did so, the voices immediately stopped. No more murmuring, no more rustling of the ants, it all simply stopped at once. I propped a chair against the bedroom door and hunkered down in my bathroom for the night.\n\nWhich finally leads us here, the present. Ever since that night, I've been holding up in my kitchen. I’ve consolidated what remaining cans of bug spray remained in my home and I've been sitting with my back to a corner of the wall for the last 3 days waiting for the swarm to return. It hasn't yet, but I can't give them an opportunity to sneak up on me. I can't risk falling asleep and letting them get me. I can't risk them getting anyone else. These demons can not be allowed to spread. I won't let them.\n\nAs I've been writing this over the last hour, the gas valve on my stove has been running the entire time. I don't know if the ants know what I'm planning but I do know that the murmuring has returned, and over the last hour it's been growing louder and louder.  There's a lighter in my kitchen drawer, and as soon as I submit this story, I'm going to use it to destroy these creatures one and for all. There's a shared fire alarm system in my apartment block. I pulled it about 5 minutes ago and sincerely hope everyone within range has gotten out. I can't wait any longer. The feeling of eyes on my neck has returned and even though I've grown immune to the paralyzing effect it had on me, I know what it means. The ants are watching me. They know what I'm planning and will surely try to stop me. I'm sorry.\n\nIf there were any words of wisdom I have left in my tattered shell of a psyche, I doubt they would be of any worth. The only thing I can think of to impart onto you is this:\n\n“We like to think we are the masters of our domain, but the sobering reality is that we are masters of nothing. The creatures that inhabited this earth before us will continue to do so long thereafter. Leave them be, and if you're lucky they will do the same. And for the love of god, stay away from anthills.”",

        "text": "I'm a police officer in a small town, and I've seen my fair share of strange and unsettling things. But nothing could have prepared me for what I encountered on one cold winter night. I was on patrol, driving through the quiet streets, when I received a call about a disturbance at an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town.\n\nWhen I arrived on the scene, I could hear strange noises coming from inside the building. It sounded like scratching and scraping, as if something was trying to break through the walls. I drew my gun and cautiously approached the warehouse, calling out for anyone inside to come out with their hands up. \n\nBut there was no response, only the sound of the scratching growing louder and more frantic. With my heart pounding, I kicked open the door and stepped inside, my gun at the ready.\n\nThe warehouse was pitch black, but I could see strange shadows moving in the corners of my vision. I called out again, demanding that whoever was inside reveal themselves. But again, there was no response. As I crept further into the darkness, the scratching and scraping grew louder and more frenzied. And then, suddenly, the noises stopped.\n\nI was plunged into an eerie silence, and I knew that something was very wrong. That's when I felt it. A cold, clammy hand on my shoulder, gripping me tightly. I spun around, ready to fire my gun, but there was nothing there. And then, I saw it. A shadowy figure, barely visible in the darkness, hovering just out of reach. It was humanoid in shape, but with unnaturally long limbs and twisted features that seemed to twist and writhe in the shadows.\n\nI tried to back away, to call for backup, but the figure was too fast. It lunged at me with inhuman speed, and I felt its icy fingers wrap around my neck. The next thing I knew, I was waking up in a hospital bed. My colleagues told me that they had found me lying unconscious in the warehouse, with no sign of the strange figure that had attacked me.\n\nBut I knew what I had seen. And I knew that I would never forget the terror of that night, or the feeling of that cold, clammy hand on my shoulder. \"  For weeks after the incident, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was following me, watching my every move. Every shadow seemed to hold a secret, every sound a potential threat. I couldn't sleep, couldn't eat, and could barely function in my day-to-day life.\n\nAs time went on, I tried to convince myself that it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. Maybe I had been too tired, too stressed, and had just imagined the whole thing. But deep down, I knew that wasn't the case. \n\nThen, one night, I received a call from a terrified woman who claimed that she was being followed by a shadowy figure. I rushed to her location, my heart racing with fear and anticipation.  As I arrived at the woman's house, I could see that the windows were all boarded up, and the doors were heavily reinforced.\n\nShe let me in, and I could see that she was trembling with fear.  She told me that she had been haunted by the shadowy figure for weeks, that it had been stalking her every move, and that she was convinced that it was going to kill her.  I searched the house, but found no sign of the figure. But as I was leaving, I caught a glimpse of something in the corner of my eye. It was the shadowy figure, lurking just outside the window.  I drew my gun and rushed outside, but the figure had disappeared once again. I searched the area, but found no trace of it.\n\nFor weeks after that, I received similar reports from people all over town. The shadowy figure was back, and it seemed to be more powerful than ever.  As the weeks turned into months, I became obsessed with finding out the truth about the figure. I spent all my free time researching the history of the town, looking for any clues that might help me understand what was happening.\"\n\nBut no matter how much I searched, I couldn't find any concrete information about the figure. Some people believed that it was the spirit of a long-dead criminal, seeking revenge on the town that had wronged him. Others thought it was a manifestation of some kind of ancient curse, passed down through the generations.\n\nI tried to keep a level head, to rationalize the events and find a logical explanation. But as the reports of the figure continued to pour in, I knew that something had to be done.\n\nOne night, I decided to take matters into my own hands. Armed with my gun and a flashlight, I set out to track down the shadowy figure once and for all.\n\nI spent hours scouring the town, searching for any sign of the figure. And then, just as I was about to give up hope, I saw it.\n\nThe figure was standing at the edge of the town, just beyond the forest. It was larger than I remembered, with twisted limbs and glowing red eyes that seemed to pierce the darkness.\n\nI raised my gun and fired, but the bullets had no effect. The figure simply laughed, a cold, mocking sound that chilled me to the bone.\n\nAnd then, it spoke.\n\n\"You cannot defeat me,\" it said, in a voice that sounded like ice scraping against stone. \"I am eternal, and I will always be here, watching, waiting, and hunting.\"\n\nI backed away slowly, my heart pounding with fear and disbelief. And then, just as suddenly as it had appeared, the figure vanished into the night.\n\nFrom that day forward, I knew that the shadowy figure would always be with me, haunting me with its presence and reminding me of the terror that I had encountered on that cold winter night. But I also knew that I could never give up the fight, that I would always be searching for a way to defeat the figure and free my town from its grip of fear and darkness.",

For weightlifters and athletes, it’s the goal of looking better and becoming stronger that helps them push through the pain of exercise. For those trapped in the monotony of everyday office work, it is their families that keep them working day in and day out through the mental pain of never-ending paperwork. However, the one true motivator that has time and again proven to be the eternal motivator of humanity now remains trapped in my psyche like a song on an endless loop. That eternal motivator, of course, is fear. The pain it helps me push through at this very moment is that of exhaustion. You see, as I sit on my cold kitchen floor typing this out, I have made a stunning realization. I have been awake for over 3 days straight. I didn't even notice until I looked at the calendar but it's true. You'd think that with all I've endured this last month, I  would have gotten somewhat used to my ordeal and the fear would have subsided even a little bit but no! It’s only gotten worse. It’s only further logged its talons in my brain and It’s the only thing keeping me awake and able to transcribe to you what has befallen me. So as I orate to you my plight I ask only one thing of you. Please, keep an open mind ok?\n\nMy name is Alex. My story begins last month in the middle of November. I would tell you where I live but there's not much point since soon enough, it won't matter. To give you some perspective on my surroundings though, let's just say in one of the southwestern states and leave it at that. I work at a car wash. Come to think of it, at the time of my writing this it'll be nearly 3 years I've been working there. It’s amazing how fast time flies when you have no aspirations in life, isn't it? You get used to a routine and are so comfortable with it that you don't even question it anymore. You just let your life slip away from you because the idea of changing anything about your routine holds the slight implication that it can all be ripped away from you and you'll have to get comfortable all over again. I did have aspirations for my life, but at one point or another, they just sorta slipped away from me. All of this is to say that I've been working this job for a very long time. I started off as a janitor and later as a cashier for the interior section. It's one of those nice car washes where you can watch your car get washed from the inside through glass. Eventually I moved my way up to the line to the point where I'm the guy who helps vacuum and dry off your car outside. \n\nIt’s more physically demanding work than I expected but the pay is significantly better than the clerical work I was doing before. Well, I'd been working that job for the last year and a half and I thought it was time for me to ask for a promotion. Not a big one mind you, I wasn't expecting to be made manager or anything, but I don't think it was out of the question to be given a job with a little more responsibility right? I knocked on my boss’s door with my speech already rehearsed in my head of various job positions I was going to remind him were available. The meeting however didn't go as planned. The speech I had planned in my head would have taken me all of 5 minutes. However, the actual conversation only lasted 2.\n\n“No” My boss interrupted at the very mention of the word promotion.\n\n“No? With all due respect, sir at least hear me out. What about my time in service here? I've logged more hours than anyone else here besides you sir” I said raising my voice slightly”\n\n“I understand the time you've put in here, and I appreciate it but what you've got to take into consideration is effort kid.”\n\n“Effort?” I replied with such disbelief that my voice may as well have been like a whisper.\n\n“Yes, Alex effort. You've put in a commendable amount of time here but Time means jack shit when you're only doing the bare minimum you understand me?” He was standing up out of his chair, leaning across the desk on his hands at this point. Staring me down with those judgemental eyes that seemed to scan me for even the slightest sign of weakness.\n\n“You think I don't see you slacking off out there every damn day? I've owned this business for a long time. I know how this job is supposed to be done. You do the bare minimum to stay employed and what you're gonna receive is the bare minimum, employment.” he said with a very serious tone.\n\nI sat there for a moment in disbelief while pondering my response. Nothing came to mind however and before I could come up with anything to say he sat back in his chair and pointed to the door behind me, ushering me out. \n\nTo say I was furious would be a colossal understatement. What little of the rest of my work day I remember was spent in a rage-filled haze that seemed to occupy every corner of my mind like a fog. “Effort?” I kept saying to myself over and over again. I mean sure, I might go on my phone every now and then during shifts but who doesn't? Sure, I may take an extra 5 minutes on my lunch break from time to time but that doesn't make me a slacker. I'm a hard worker dammit! I know I am, and for this pretentious piece of shit to claim that I wasn't. Well, let’s just say that I didn't get a very positive reception for the rest of my shift. I don't think I said hello, let alone cracked a smile at a customer for the rest of that day.\n\nAs my time at work ended and I drove home I could sense that I was still seething. My grip on the wheel seemed to tighten exponentially and I had acquired a sort of tunnel vision while driving. Similar to when you zone out and stare into nothingness. Noticing that this was probably unsafe and that  I was close to my local park I decided to stop by and go for a walk to clear my head. \n\nI always liked the park. There's not much that I can confidently claim to enjoy with my life but Fishing has been and always will be one of my favorite pastimes. The lake at the park is the only notable body of water near my town so needless to say I’ve spent a lot of my free time going there.\n\nAfter a few minutes of walking the path, I decided to sit on a bench overlooking the water. I watched the light shine off the water's surface for a few peaceful moments and allowed the anger in my heart to subside until all I was left with was a feeling of pure emptiness. A feeling which was quickly refilled again with a newfound sense of depression at my situation. As the newfound grip of sadness took hold of me I leaned forward and allowed my head to fall comfortably in between my hands staring down at the ground ahead when I noticed something peculiar. There was an anthill in front of my bench across the walking path. Not an uncommon thing I know. It's a park, fair to assume there are going to be ants right? Well, I'd never seen an anthill that looked like this before. Anthill isn't even the proper term to describe it as there was no hill. Just a perfectly cylindrical hole about 2 inches in diameter in the ground that appeared to devour all of the surrounding light, making it impossible to see down into it. Coming out of the hole was what appeared to be ants. However much like their place of residence they too looked like no other ant species I can ever recall.\n\nIn the same vanity as their hill they too were as dark as dark could be. On top of that, the insects were huge. They were at least the size of the tip of a pinkie with very defined mandible teeth that jutted out from their heads quite far. I stared at them for a good 10 seconds, soaking in every detail about the colony I had stumbled across when suddenly, the rage I had suppressed earlier came back. Only now it was accompanied by the dose of sadness which had originally filled its place.\n\nI don't know what it was, something about the creatures just disgusted me on a basic primal level and it reignited that burning anger I had originally come to the park to lose in the first place. I'm usually a fairly peaceful guy but the utterly unnatural look of the creatures just disgusted me on a personal level. Becoming annoyed by the fact that these insects had disgusted me so much and reignited my anger, I stood up, kicked dirt over the hole, stomped on the anthill a few times, and set off back to my car without a second thought. As I said, I'm usually a fairly peaceful guy. However, I'd be lying if I said it didn't feel good to let out some of my pent-up aggression from that day. \n\nThe rest of my day went off without a hitch. I went back home, watched some tv, and made dinner just like any other night. Everything appeared to be normal with one exception. As I attempted to toss and turn my way to sleep that night, I could not shake the feeling that I was being watched. Now let me clarify, I'm not just talking about that feeling you get that makes people sleep with their backs to the walls or the urge to keep the back of one's neck covered up by their blankets when falling asleep. It was very deliberately, specifically the feeling of eyes being fixated upon me. A feeling made more uncomfortable by the fact that from what I could see, there was nobody in the room with me. Exhaustion is a powerful weapon however and Despite this feeling and how uncomfortable it made me, I was able to eventually get some sleep for the night.\n\nThe next morning, however, is when things officially started to get weird. You see, I live on the first floor of my apartment complex. The different rooms are laid out in a way so that there are 4 separate apartments for each section. 2 rooms on the first floor and 2 on the second with a staircase splitting down the middle, and a little stretch of dirt and grass lining the walls of each of the first-floor apartments. I never paid much mind to the stretch of dirt that lay outside my room, I've never been particularly into gardening so I had no incentive to plant anything there or to attempt to upkeep what remained of the patch of grass that clung desperately to the edge of the concrete walkway. The reason That was the first day I ever showed interest in my little patch of dirt was due to one simple detail that stuck out like an uneven shelf of books. There was a pitch-black hole, with the diameter of a golf ball perfectly centered on the patch of dirt right outside my front door. \n\nAs I locked my door and turned my head to begin walking down the strip of concrete that led to my car I found my head immediately frozen in place upon noticing it. As I stood there analyzing it I felt a cold chill run down from the base of my neck, up to the top of my head, and down to my fingertips. I can't describe what it was about the hole that creeped me out. The fact that it was blacker than any shade I had ever seen was a good enough reason but there were others. The seemingly, perfectly cylindrical shape of it gave it an unnatural appearance that made it feel like it didn't belong there, more so than it already didn't. However, the reason I felt most unnerved at that moment was due to the simple fact that I had seen this hole before, the day just before that morning to be specific. This was the same type of hole I had seen yesterday, in the park. \n\n“What the fuck?”\n\nI thought to myself as I knelt down to get a closer look at the hole. From what I could see there were no ants, or at least none visible at the moment. Never letting my eyes leave the hole, I reached my hand across the patch of dirt to grab a small twig that just so happened to be there and began to slowly lower it into the hole. The twig was a good 3 inches long but yet, the hole swallowed it up entirely to the point where I could not stick it any deeper into the hole without my fingers themselves going into the hole itself.\n\n“Just how deep does this go?” I thought to myself \n\nWith my body at the complete mercy of curiosity, I again reached over across the patch of dirt, this time picking up a small pebble. I positioned it carefully, calculating exactly where it needed to be dropped to fall perfectly into the hole. \n\n“Are you alright ?”\n\nMy thoughts were suddenly interrupted by a firm grip on my shoulder which caused me to jump damn near out of my skin. I spun around quickly only to be greeted by my 1st-floor neighbor Ron. A very tall bald man somewhere in his mid 40’s who I'm fairly certain did nothing with his free time besides chew ground beef and lift weights. Not the kind of person you'd necessarily be comfortable with grabbing you out of the blue. \n\n“Jesus Ron! You scared the shit out of me!” I stammered out between gasps.\n\n“Sorry about that neighbor,\" He said in his gravely southern voice that was so cartoonishly cowboy-esk you'd swear he just got done marathoning a collection of Yosemite Sam cartoons.\n\n\"I called your name out about 10 seconds ago but you seemed so focused on, whatever it is you were doing that I guess you didn't hear me,” he said, chuckling to himself.I collected my thoughts, steadied my emotions, and after a few short breaths responded.\n\n\"Yeah, sorry. I'm fine, I was just checking out this weird-looking hole in the ground.\"\n\nHe made a half-hearted attempt to look over my shoulder and take a peek at the odd hole I was talking about, but quickly re-straightened his posture to look back at me. \n\n\" Well alright then \"\n\nHis sentence was shortly interrupted by one of my backup alarms on my phone going off. Upon pulling out my phone I saw that this alarm, in particular, was to notify me that I had 10 minutes to be at work. I understand the seeming ridiculousness of setting an alarm so soon to my work start time but given the number of times I've fallen asleep in the parking lot waiting for my shift to start, it's always better to be safe than sorry.\n\n\"Oh shit, I'm sorry Ron! Gotta go! \"\n\nI said before quickly running off. He gave me a slight wave as he watched me sprint to my car. However, As I got in my car, threw it into reverse, and began backing up I neglected to wave back. My gaze remained fixated on the hole in my front yard the entire time I backed out. \n\nI wasn't able to make it to work on time. Just barely anyways. Through my complete and total disregard for the very concept of \"speed limits\" and a fair share of annoyed honks and middle fingers tossed in my general direction as I dodged and weaved my way through traffic like a snake; I was able to make it to work only 2 minutes late. \n\nExcept for the scolding I got from my boss for arriving late, the rest of my work day was pretty uneventful. Although I'm not sure if I should attribute that to the mundane nature of the work itself, or if I was just burnt out from the torrent of emotions I had experienced there yesterday. Whatever the case may have been, however, I was able to get through the rest of the work day without incident. \n\nI place emphasis on the rest of the “Work” day because As I pulled back into my apartment parking spot, my eyes immediately locked back onto the dark pit that sat in my front yard like an unnatural blemish. I wasn't even thinking about the hole all day at work or anything. As a matter of fact, I had totally forgotten about the morning incident maybe an hour after arriving at work. No, my attention immediately drew to the hole because I don't know. I wish I could explain it but I can't. The best way I can describe it is: like looking at the ocean. Sure, you CAN look away; but every fiber of your being compels you to continue staring for just a little bit longer. So that's exactly what I did. I stared at the hole for the majority of the walk from my car up to my front door and even then when the front door was closed, the image of it remained ever-present in my mind.\n\nAs the night drew near and I got myself ready for bed I once again found myself uncomfortable with the unshakeable feeling of eyes laid upon me. As I brushed my teeth and took my gaze away from the mirror to rinse out my mouth I got particularly large goosebumps as the feeling grew, seemingly exponentially. It continued to do so as I finally got ready to turn off the lights for bed.\n\nHowever, I was stopped dead in my tracks when I noticed Two black ants staring at me from outside my window. I know it sounds ridiculous but that's the only way I can describe their behavior. Insects congregating around a window is nothing out of the ordinary. But these were no ordinary bugs. They were undeniably the same ants I had seen that fateful day in the park. Or at the very least they were the same species. As I approached the window and leaned over to get a better look at them, their posture did not waiver. They stood steadfast like statues. Staring right back at me. Much like the day I first encountered the creatures, the mere sight of them filled my stomach with a sense of disgust I didn't know the human body was capable of conjuring. It was a deep, primal disgust that seemingly begged my arms to move on their own to shut the blinds on them to get them out of my sight.  I was more than happy to oblige. The feeling of disgust passed, however As I laid my head down for bed the feeling of eyes on my back did not. It remained that way through the rest of the night.\n\nThat was the point where my life took a turn and began to rapidly derail. As I left my apartment the next day I almost instinctively looked down to check on the anthill in my front yard. Sure enough, there were 2 black ants staring at me. I watched them the entire time I walked to my car and sure enough, they did the same. Just like the night before on my windowsill. I never left their sight\n\nThis time, I did not forget about the incident while I was at work. It didn't hinder my work but it certainly occupied a larger portion of my mind this time around. By the time I pulled back into my driveway later that day, I was hesitant to point my eyes any lower than dead straight ahead of me. I knew they would be there, but that didn't change the fact I couldn't stand the sight of the vile creatures. However, curiosity is one of humanity's most powerful instincts. I fought it as best I could, but the closer I got to my door the stronger it became. Inevitably, it took hold of me. Once it did I noticed that there were now three ants guarding the anthill. As always, they stared me down the entire time until I was safely behind my front door.\n\nThat was when I decided to finally do something about the apparent infestation and called up my landlord Mitchell.\n\n\"And you're sure it's been growing? Mitchell asked with a hint of skepticism.\n\n\"I wouldn't lie to you, man. You know what they say on all those animal planet shows. If you see 2 there's a whole colony\" I retorted with all the confidence in the world. \n\n“Isn't that only a saying for rat colonies or something?\" He said with an even bigger dose of skepticism\n\n\"Look I don't know if the saying applies to all infestations. All I know is that I've been seeing more and more ants show up around my apartment so clearly, they've settled in the area. I'm not asking for much, just an exterminator visit is all you know? Get his perspective.\" I said that last line as calmly as I could. I figured the only way to get him to throw me a bone here was by making it not sound like a big expensive task.\n\nHe sighed \" alright man. I got a buddy who works for pest control. I'll tell him to swing by towards the end of his shift for a … mock inspection. You have a good night Alex\" and with that he hung up, sounding mildly annoyed at being convinced to actually do his job. The bane of any landlord's existence I suppose.\n\nThe rest of that night went fairly well compared to the previous one. I was feeling very at ease with having a professional come in to help out with the situation. On top of that, there were no ants on my windowsill like the previous night. All was right in the world until I felt the sting.\n\nAt an ungodly hour of night I can't even begin to recollect, I awoke to a sharp pain on the stretch of skin between my shoulder and neck. Upon inspection, in my bathroom mirror, I found a small red dot was the source of my pain. It hurt like hell and when I went to touch it sharp burning pain emanated from it that felt like a lit matchstick being pressed into my skin. \n\nI inspected my bed to see if I could spot the culprit. Obviously, my first reaction was to blame my newfound neighbors. I had already grown very tired of them, but bed bugs do exist. I wanted to be thorough and see if it could have been anything else. Despite my investigation efforts I found nothing and went back to sleep. Telling myself that it must just be a strange pimple of some kind. Knowing damn well that wasn't the case, but nonetheless, I was too tired to care at that moment.\n\nThe next morning as I left my apartment I did my now routine checkup on the batch of dirt in front of my apartment. There were four of them now. Sure enough, like the night I first encountered them on my windowsill, they watched my every move without so much as taking a step from their apparent guard-like positions. Just like they had done every other time thus far, filled with annoyance at the pests, I kicked up some dirt at them violently in an attempt to get them to run back into their hole. An attempt that was without reward. They didn't move an inch. They stood their ground and watched me intensely from my front door all the way to my car, and even though I could not see them while driving out of my parking lot I still felt their gaze on the back of my neck. \n\nWhen I arrived back home later that day I was relieved to see the exterminator was already hard at work, crouched down alongside my windowsill spraying some form of poison along the edges and underside of my wall.\n\n“Hey man, thanks for helping me out,” I said as I walked slightly to the side of him whilst twirling my keys. He pulled out his earbuds and looked over at me \n\n“I'm sorry, did you say something?” he uttered. I sighed, rolled my eyes internally, and began again.\n\n“This is my place, your um … \"I struggled to think of the word to describe the procedure the man was in the middle of.\n\n“Pest controlling?” I said, shrugging my shoulders.\n\n“ Oh! You must be Alex!” he chuckled to himself. \n\n“Yes sir, I was notified of a possible ant infestation so I'm just laying some pesticides around all possible entry points into your home. All natural neem oil pesticides so they are nontoxic to you and any possible pets you may have.” I nodded along pretending to have a clue what he was talking about.\n\n“ That's awesome man, just make sure you get the anthill in the front yard too.”\n\nHe leaned his head over past my shoulder to scout the rest of the front yard.\n\n“Don't you worry sir, I'll be sure to hit up any possible entry points as well as possible nest spots. As I go along” he said with a smile. After about 15 minutes he knocked on my door, informed me that he was done and to keep an eye out for any more ants, and left. I breathed a sigh of relief and quickly had my nerves out to rest. Finally, with some peace of mind, I was able to enjoy the remainder of my night relaxing with some video games and staying up late due to my day off the following day. All was right in the world. Until I laid my head on my pillow, and I felt the familiar gaze of eyes on the back of my head.\n\nThe following morning was as mundane as mundane could be. After sleeping in for what felt like the first time in weeks I Woke up, went about my morning routine, and sat on my couch watching some TV while thinking about what to do with my day. Eventually settling on going out to see a movie that I wasn't exactly dying to watch. I just couldn't think of anything better to do. A plan that was quickly cut short by the discovery of a new anthill on my front lawn. \n\nAbout a foot away from the original and closer to my apartment lay an almost identical-looking copy of the strange anthill that had lived rent-free on my lawn for far too long. I was stopped dead in my tracks upon my discovery of it and was immediately met with a wave of annoyance at its existence.\n\n\"Fucking christ Mitchell. Some exterminator friend you've got\" I thought to myself.\n\nWith a deep sigh, I resigned myself to a day of exterminating rather than relaxation and set off for my local hardware store to buy some bug killer. I wasn't exactly sure what to look for to help deal with my particular infestation. Eventually, however, I settled on a can of bug spray made for ants as well as a few of those little plastic bait traps that ants are supposed to inadvertently poison the entire colony with.\n\nAgain, I was not an exterminator by any means so I had no idea how to go about using the equipment I had just acquired. I figured that if I sprayed a copious amount of the bug spray along the bottom of my door frame and along my window sills, that would keep them from entering my apartment. As for the ant bait traps I just placed one outside both of the 2 anthills and figured they would have to investigate them eventually. \n\nAfter that little side quest, I was finally able to enjoy the remainder of my day off. Or at least a fair portion of it. It was around 7 pm when I was sitting on my couch watching TV, just nearly drifting off to sleep that I felt a sting. It rattled my whole body from the back of my neck all the way down to the left side of my foot and caused me to nearly jump out of my skin with pain.\n\nI instinctually stood up and threw off my shirt in an attempt to get what I assumed was one of my ant neighbors off of me and began throwing my shirt over my shoulders to try to swat it off. I did this a few times before realizing I was safe and there was nothing attached to me.  I looked and looked and there wasn't any ant to be seen on the couch either. I made sure to pull out every cushion, move the couch and even check the surrounding furniture and I still found nothing. When I went to investigate my back in the bathroom mirror I couldn't see a sting mark either. A fact that was not relieving in the slightest. I didn't sleep much that night. I could still feel eyes on the back of my neck no matter which way I faced as I tossed and turned.\n\nAs I woke up the next morning I had a sense of looming dread hanging over my head that I couldn't shake. A sense of dread that was different mind you than the usual morning blues before one gets ready for work. As I closed my front door I took a deep breath and turned around to check on the anthills. To my complete and utter shock, they were gone. I couldn't believe it. For a few moments, I just stood there racking my brain for answers.\n\n\"Did they move out or something?\" I thought to myself, unable to come up with any rational answer. \"Did my traps work that fast? Even if they did the holes wouldn't be this covered up so soon\" I thought to myself.\n\nMy ant traps were still there, looking quite lonely without any trace of an ant colony to accompany them. I chuckled to myself a little bit out of relief that it looked like my infestation problem had taken care of itself and set off for work. \n\nA comforting fact. So why the fuck did I still feel it? That uneasiness I had felt that morning was still there. It hadn't grown, it hadn't decreased, it just remained there. A constant emotion in the back of my mind from the time I woke up, all throughout work, and even now as I had visual confirmation that my intruders were gone it remained. I opened my front door and stepped inside. The 2 black ants sitting on my kitchen table turned their heads to face my direction and stared at me.\n\nIn an instant, I felt my blood turn to ice and felt a cold chill run down my spine that seemingly paralyzed me in the doorway of my own home. I had never felt so uneasy in my entire life as I did at that moment. As I stood there frozen with fear, all the moments that had led up to this moment in time raced through my mind. The encounter at the park, the mysterious anthills, the windowsill encounter, and the dread I felt when I looked at these damn bugs all played back in my mind. \n\n\"Something is very wrong here.\" I thought to myself.\n\nThese were no ordinary bugs. That much was clear from their appearance alone, I had figured out that much and accepted it long ago. I'm not talking about that though. On an almost instinctual, primal level that I couldn't comprehend at that moment in time, something was simply very wrong.\n\nWhen I eventually regained my wits, I began to walk past the table and to my fridge to retrieve a paper towel. The entire time their heads followed my every move, and I in return did not dare let the cursed insects out of my sight. With one swift motion, I yanked a paper towel off from its roll and smushed the bugs before they could escape. Their smushed remains left an unusual amount of black liquid on my paper towel that seemed unnaturally copious for something so small. I threw their remains away and pulled out my phone.\n\n“ I need the exterminator back here Mitchell. I don't know what kind of “consultation” you had this guy run for me but it clearly wasn't enough because there in my fucking house now” \n\n“You mean the ants?” he retorted\n\n“No, the fucking lawn gnomes YES, the ants Mitchel Jesus!” I spat back at him. \n\nHe took a long deep sigh. Even though I had no visual indication, I knew him well and could tell just from the sign that he was at that very moment rubbing his forehead out of annoyance like he always did.\n\n“Alright alright, ill call him just calm the fuck down kid. I'll text you his response ok?” He sounded very irritated at that last remark. \n\n“Sure, thanks,” I said before abruptly hanging up.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes I got a text from Mitchell that read: “He’s all booked up. Says he can do it 2 days from now at the earliest.”\n\nI replied back almost immediately “2 days? That's not soon enough man! You gotta find me, someone, to get here sooner!”\n\n“He's the cheapest one in town, Alex. He's the one I'm going with. You'll be fine until then, they’re just some fucking ants” \n\nI threw my phone at the wall out of frustration and slumped against the kitchen counter, almost immediately regretting that decision before frantically going to check the damage. Just a crack on the screen. As I sat there kneeling I took a very long deep breath to clear my head.\n\n“Ok,” I said to myself before standing up, and calling in sick to my boss for the following day.\n\nThe following “sick day” was spent doing what, in my mind, can only be described as a full-on war. I returned from the hardware store with 2 bags in hand that were filled with more of those plastic ant bait traps, stick traps, and bug spray. I spent a good hour placing the various traps throughout my home in high-traffic areas where I thought the ants liked to travel. I sprayed down more bug spray along the windowsill and doorway and when I was satisfied with that, I laid down even more ant traps.\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say maybe … 20 traps in total were scattered around my house. A number that is certainly overkill to anyone who wasn't privy to my situation, but it wasn't so comically overkill that one would look into my home and one would immediately write me off as a lunatic. \n\nI half expected the ants to at some point come out and try to stop me. To stand in my way, move my traps, and even commit their usual crime of simply watching me. Not only did none of this occur, however, but I didn't see them at all that day. Not on my kitchen counter, not on my window, not anywhere. As I laid my head down for bed that night I still felt the now all too familiar eyes on the back of my neck. Aside from that though, it was like they were finally gone. \n\nWhereas the previous day I awoke feeling unbearable dread, the day after I had gone to war with the ants greeted me with a sense of optimism I had long since forgotten existed. There were, once again, no signs of the cursed bugs anywhere. As I left my home and walked to my car there were still no anthills to be seen. My ant traps were still laid in my front yard and I reminded myself to pick them up when I returned from work. As I pulled out of my driveway and began driving to work I found myself in such a good mood that I even found myself singing along a little to the songs on the radio. A state of mind that I truly had not felt in what felt like ages. A feeling that immediately melted away as I noticed the ant crawling around on my hand.\n\nTime slowed down and with what felt like one swift motion I smacked it off of my hand with the other, causing me to turn my car sharply to the left and nearly end up off of the road. I waited for the annoyed honks to pass me by until it was safe to pull over and once I was able to, I jumped out of my car and began to furiously pat down my body in search of any more ants. I found none, however, except for the now-dead one that lay on the dashboard of my car. After removing its corpse from my car I spent a good 10 minutes checking every nook and cranny of my car to see if I could find any more of them. When and only when I was certain that there was absolutely no chance of the insects hiding anywhere in my vehicle, I finally set off to work in complete silence.\n\nI honestly don't remember if anybody talked to me at work that day. Whether it be because I was so trapped in my own head I didn't notice anyone's attempts or because I must've looked like a nervous wreck and simply nobody wanted to. Either way, fear was my only companion that working day. The feeling that used to only accompany me as I laid my head down to sleep at night now made itself present at work. The entire day I kept randomly slapping my extremities at even the faintest itching sensation. I'm sure I looked like a madman, but I couldn't help it. I was paranoid that they had followed me to work and at certain points, I even mistook the pain of a random muscle cramp for one of their stings. It was a very long day at work to say the absolute least.\n\nWhen I pulled back into my apartment driveway the feeling of being watched grew so intense that it nearly made my eyes water up from the cold chill that ran down my spine. It took me a few seconds to muster up the courage to step out of my car and began walking to my front door. As soon as I did, I checked my front lawn. Still no anthills. This was not a comforting discovery. I had no more optimism about the situation and knew that this did not mean they were gone. It simply meant they had moved in. \n\n“The exterminator comes tomorrow,” I told myself in an attempt to remain calm. An attempt that had not a hint of sincerity behind it. \n\nPain, pain was all that I felt as I was ripped out of my sleep at an hour of night I can't even begin to remember. Though it was pitch black in my room and I had no visual confirmation, I knew what the culprit was immediately. The stinging sensation was the same as I had felt on the back of my neck many days ago. What was different about this time however was the area of effect. It felt like the pain was everywhere on my body all at once. As quickly as I woke up and as quickly as I recognized the source of the pain, I leaped out of bed and yanked on my desk lamp cord. My desk lamp fell to the ground and its light shone straight up at my ceiling, illuminating the room with many mysterious shadows that seemed to surround me on all sides. It was enough light to see my current situation, however. Dozens, maybe even hundreds of ants had swarmed all over my body. \n\nI immediately began to swat, slap, spin, and do everything in my power to shake loose the insects, all the while they continued to sting me over and over again. They felt like hot staples being driven into my skin and they were happening multiple times a second. The pain was so excruciating I felt like I was going to pass out or throw up at any second. As I spun in circles, shaking the ants loose from me, I noticed there were 2 ants sitting on my nightstand. Just like the day at the park, my house, and my kitchen, they watched me. Despite my frantic and fast movements in all directions, they stood steadfast like statues. Watching me writhe around in agony the entire time. I eventually had gotten enough of them off of me to the point where I could grab a can of ant spray I had kept in a corner of the room. Almost instantly, I felt the stinging stop. The pain didn't, but I could feel no new stinging occurring. As I looked down I noticed the ants fleeing from me. The ants on the nightstand were no longer there and the ones who were just attacking me a moment ago were now scurrying across the floor away from me as fast as they could. They weren't fast enough. They were resilient though. On average I'd say each ant took about a 3-second spray to fully stop moving. I honestly think I used up half the damn bottle that night. It's not like I was in any state of mind to have used the thing sparingly. I simply held down the spray button, and I didn't let go until I saw no more signs of life in my room. When it was all finally over, I counted 85 stings all over my body. They covered my chest, arms, legs, back and neck. It took a little while but after I was done cleaning the ant corpses from my room I decided to take a hot bath to try to soothe my writhing body, and promptly passed out in my bathtub from the pain",

        "text": "One night when i was driving home from a late night shift at my work, i was on a high road normally filled with traffic at that time of night but there was no car but mine, i was almost out of fuel and spotted and my gps showed a gas station a mile away so i drove above the speed limit to reach it before my fuel ran out, when i reached it all the lights were on inside but nobody was there i thought maybe the worker was in the restroom so i thought nothing of it, i filled up my car and went in so i could pay and grab a drink and some stuff to eat, once i had entered there was still nobody in but there was a ATM so i went to it and pulled out around £60 so i could pay for the gas and a snack i grabbed a pack of crisps, chocolate and a bottle of cola i went up to the till and i put the money on it and as i was about to leave i saw a shadow behind me it’s arms were the same height as me it was towering over me it had talons. I quickly turned around to see what it was and when i saw it i felt like i was paralysed it had no eyes instead it had holes where they would normally be the holes were deep going right through its head i could see the gas station wall through it, it’s neck was slit open bleeding out and it’s mouth was wide open with a grin and it’s sharp blood stained teeth, it had a old stained uniform on with rips in it and through the rips you could see it’s ribs bulging out looking like it hadn’t ate for years i was horrified just standing there paralysed holding my stuff and out of nowhere it said “ERDAN FORTIF NORAFI KERIF” it pulled its arm it and its talons that were atleast 4 inches looking like a knife moved to my throat as if it was going to slit it out of nowhere i no longer felt paralysed and my fight or flight kicked in, i punched it as hard as i could and it didn’t move a muscle it then said in a angrier tone “MERKAF MOFIAS GORIAR” i ran as fast as i could not even going to the door and just jumping out the glass windows feeling the glass seep into my skin as i ran for my life to my car with it slowly chasing after my lifting it’s arms getting ready to grab me. It almost grabbed me but i just got out of its reach and when i had got to my car i didn’t even put my seat belt in i just put my key in and it wouldn’t start i tried and i tried and then it worked but by that time IT Had put it’s arm right through the window almost grabbing my neck but instead it cut my neck with its talons and i pushed down the acceleration with all the force i could. i had got away from the gas station thing i was safe then i heard a thump on top of my roof, It caught up to me i thought if i went as fast as my car could go it would fall of but it didn’t it put its hand through the hole in my window it left earlier and grabbed me by the throat and pulled me out of my car but luckily because the car was speeding it pushed forward knocking it off while i was in its hand it had let go and i thought it was dead so i ran as fast as i could to my car got in and went as fast as my car could go and got way from it. I am now in my house hopefully safe from it as i am writing this it is currently 3:56am and i live by myself i am praying that it doesn’t know where i live but if anything happens and i live i will update you",

        "text": " I know the title seems confusing but let me explain. We were told to produce a piece of literature that is horror which should relate to a character that we might have created in the past for a writing exercise, it's weird I know but I didn't write it and yet I woke up today to receive an email from my teacher who said she loved the unique take I had and well here it is:\n\n*Why do I always write characters that are workaholics and in the spotlight? This was something I had never asked myself before but being an English major, Miss Samantha asked us to read through our own creations and find patterns. That was two months ago and ever since then I'm facing a dilemma, the dilemma of why are all of my characters so similar to each other. This was what I wrote on paper but I didn't mention one thing, why were they so similar to my messed-up version of success? A success I don't desire any more.*\n\n*I know what you're thinking, everyone does that before they develop their own style, and all of us create characters that are essentially Mary Sue or based on ourselves or someone we look up to. I am aware but have we ever wondered why? We as writers can create completely new worlds but we can't create characters that we don't relate with.*\n\n*Often times we say we have writer's block but what if the story's characters don't like the way we're writing their story? Often times we say that we suddenly had a wave of inspiration on what to do and we write and write and write.*\n\n*What if the characters are the ones writing the stories? What if even now the realization that I have had is on purpose, to torment me and to torture me because I can't for the life of me reason as to why, why all of my characters are females with black hair and brown eyes? Why does their sister always kill them with poison? Poison that is essentially an allergic reaction?*\n\n*Ever since the assignment was given, I had a lot of things happen and since I hate journaling, I just did it once per week. So, this is what happened:*\n\n# Week 1: \n\n*A foul smell started coming from my working desk. (Could work for 4 hours)*\n\n# Week 2: \n\n*Foul smell turned more foul. (Didn't sit at the working table)*\n\n# Week 3: \n\n*The whole room smells disgusting. (Don't go there anymore)*\n\n# Week 4: \n\n*I think the smell is beginning to leak. I smell it in the living room now.*\n\n# Week 5: \n\n*I see things that are not there. Figures in the dark with long flowy hair. (I'm not hallucinating)*\n\n# Week 6: \n\n*I can't close the light anymore, the dark scares me.*\n\n# Week 7: \n\n*I'm feeling better now, I slept the whole day yesterday. I was just tired I guess. I finally went out to buy some stuff. I really need to write something else in this so here's what I'm going to buy*\n\n* *Ice cream*\n* *Keychain*\n* *Iced coffee*\n* *Lip balm*\n* *Ladder*\n* *Eggs*\n* *Doorknob*\n* *Hand towel*\n* *Air freshener*\n* *Notebook*\n* *Napkin*\n* *Apron*\n* *Hand sanitizer*\n\n*;)*\n\n# Week 8: \n\n*I've started writing again. I just had to remove the source of the smell.*\n\n*She's closer now, I feel her presence behind me.*\n\n*She's getting bolder, the light doesn't bother her anymore.*\n\n*I went out for a walk, when I came back my laptop was on and there was a water bottle,* [*that water bottle is not mine.*](https://imgur.com/a/cxkYzbq)\n\n*She's standing behind me.*\n\n*I blacked out, I don't know what happened. I woke up hoping it was a bad dream but the bottle is still there. One thing I didn't notice until I looked at the picture again is the two pens that I don't own, the panda paw and the cat pen and they're still there. There's something written in my journal, I didn't write it.*\n\n...................................................................................................................................................................................\n\nOnce upon a time, there lived two princesses. The princesses were polar opposites. One had blonde hair and one had black hair. The black hair princess was loved by all. She was always doing royal duties while the blonde hair princess would play.\n\nOne day an important fact was disclosed that the black hair princess would be the queen while the blonde hair princess would always remain a princess. The blonde hair princess was naïve, she killed the black hair princess out of spite but she didn't know was that she was adopted.\n\nShe killed the black hair princess by poisoning her with food that contained sunflower seeds, then she cut her up into pieces and stuffed her in the wall of her under construction house.\n\nThe black hair princess doesn't blame the blonde hair princess, she just wants to play with her like the old times but the blonde hair princess doesn't play with her.\n\nShe feels lonely in the walls, sometimes she can get out. She left her favourite items for her sister to use outside. She hopes her sister still likes her and she isn't afraid of the dark.\n\nIt's really dark here in the walls and I need a friend little sis, won't you join me?\n\n...................................................................................................................................................................................\n\n*I'm going to lock her somewhere else now, she's getting strong again.*\n\n*She's got me.*\n\n***I've got her.***\n\nToday, when I went to write my WIP, there was a foul smell coming from the wall behind it. I'm not worried about that, I just hope Miss Samantha is dumb enough to not make the connection. She probably won't be able to and she won't have the time but I know you will and I promised Hannah I would get her new friends. And the only way to do that is to picture her in your mind.\n\nFor your sake, I hope you don't have an overactive imagination but for mine, I wish you do. But then again she doesn't need much, the hair is enough.\n\nSorry.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nJosefine followed a systematized routine to maintain some level of structured sanity, immersing herself in romance novels before bed, the type of reading material that preys on the naive, hopeless romantics of the world and breeds delusional activity on the subject matter. She always preferred the company of her books over the company of others. People often left her feeling unfulfilled, bored and drained. Still, the company of others was better than the company of her own thoughts. She despised being alone, but tonight, she didn’t have to worry about the voices in her head. Tonight she would be forced to break the convention of her nightly ritual to charm a distinct type of company she developed a particular distaste for. Tonight, she would milk the fragile egos of her husband’s colleagues by laughing at their humorless jokes and engaging in useless quibbling over semantics. The notion of it overwhelmed her with exhaustion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe rummages through her closet, dissatisfied with each option she pulls from its depths. She holds up a sexy red dress to her chin, considers it for a long moment, quickly changing her mind and returning it to the rack. Finally, she settles on a black dress. It’s plain Jane, but sophisticated enough. She slips into the dress and glares at her reflection with a disconcerting look for a long moment. Music emanates from downstairs in the background while she methodically applies lipstick and wraps a pearl necklace around her bare neck, struggling with the clasp when her husband, Nicolo ambles in, his walk catching the beat of the music.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJosefine lets out a laugh. She hates herself for it, for finding him so charming and adorable after what he put her through. He takes the necklace from her hands, clasps it together and kisses her neck. She cringes inwardly, discomforted by his touch. He picks up on it but doesn’t acknowledge it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You look beautiful.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe smiles weakly, disbelieving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Thanks, you look nice.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNicolo twirls to show off his tux and Stefano Ricci neck-tie. He’s dressed to impress. The sound of the doorbell intrudes on the moment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You almost ready?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I’ll be down in a few.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe slips out, leaving Josefine alone with the company of her thoughts. A wave of depression creeps up on her. Suddenly overcome with the exhaustion that accompanies the malevolent syndrome, she musters the strength to drag herself into the bathroom and pulls a prescription bottle from the medicine cabinet. She fishes for a pill with shaky hands, throws it back and slips into the corridor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe juxtaposition of music and chatter fill the air as she descends the stairs. She surveys the room full of white collar folk and their counterparts until her eyes dawn on her husband who is obnoxiously waving her over. Josefine groans to herself, forcing a smile as she approaches the group. Tom, an overweight lawyer, embraces Josefine in an unduly hug. His breath wreaks of whiskey when he speaks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You look more beautiful everytime I see you, Josefine. And that dress, wow! Nicolo is a lucky man. If you ever get bored of him, you let me know.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNicolo raises his glass of wine and takes a sip.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJosefine blushes. “Thank you, Tom.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“We were about to play Never Have I Ever. Are you in?” Josefine shifts uncomfortably, clearly not wanting to partake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I should get the hors d’oeuvres. Unfed systems and alcohol are a recipe for disaster.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Nonsense. Everyone will get drunk faster and be in their ubers, out of your hair, sooner than later.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe raises a good point. She considers for a brief moment. Barbara, an overenthusiastic, underdressed paralegal nudges Josefine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Common, it’ll be fun.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJosefine gives into the pressure. “One round.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTom beams with joy. “Great. I’ll get you a drink. What’s your preference? I’m sensing... dry martini.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe words dry martini have a strange effect on her. She is equal parts aroused and terrified by the words. Josefine and Nicolo exchange glances.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“She’s not drinking, buddy.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I’m 5 months sober.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Oh! Sorry, I didn’t know. How about a dirty dolphin then?” “A what?” “Water.” He slaps Josefine’s back playfully, a little too hard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Water is wonderful. Thanks, Tom.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJosefine shrinks a little, embarrassed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“How about you Nic, another Pinot? That’s a woman’s drink, ain’t it?” “It’s a Syrah. Asshat.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hey! Asshat. I like that. That’s one up from cheesedick.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You’re still a cheesedick.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTom waves him off and retrieves the drinks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJosefine laughs, loosening up a little. “So how do we play?” “It’s easy, babe. Each person admits something they’ve never done. If you’ve done it, you drink.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTom returns, balancing four drinks and hands them out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Water on the rocks.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Thanks.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Alright, Tom’s up first.” “Right. Never have I ever…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNicolo playfully interrupts. “Gone on a diet”.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTom has a good sense of humor to compensate for his lack of sex appeal, so he laughs. “He’s not wrong.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTom raises his drink, downs it and grabs a crab puff from a waiter passing by. Everyone laughs except Josefine. Her eyes are glued to Nicolo’s wine glass as he swirls it with practiced hands. Tom speaks with a mouth full of pastry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Never have I ever…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe scans the room, searching for an answer, settles his glare on Nicolo and Josefine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Got laid in the past year.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEveryone laughs, except for Josefine and Nicolo who exchange uncomfortable glances. His eyes slightly pleading, met by hers, filled with a suppressed rage that’s been buried deep for some time. He breaks contact and stares into his wine glass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Aren’t you going to drink?” Her words are pointed, accusatory.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe nurses his wine with apprehension. No one addresses that Josefine doesn’t drink. He clears his throat. Tom picks up on the tension and fills the silence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Your turn, Josie.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Never have I ever…” She searches the group for an answer. Nicolo looks apprehensive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Been called cheesedick.” She glances at Tom, allowing a smirk as she raises her glass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTom laughs a hardy laugh and drinks. “Josefine is the only one who hasn’t taken a drink yet.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNicolo chimes in. “I’ve got one. Never have I ever… used taco meat in a bolognese.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe throws a wink at his wife while everyone laughs harmoniously, except for Josefine who maintains a practiced calm. She glances around at the surrounding faces staring at her and suddenly something happens. She lets herself go and laughs uncontrollably, allowing a snort to slip from her lips, causing everyone to laugh even harder. Caught in the moment, Tom chokes on a crab puff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Drink that water, girly. Not too fast, you lightweight.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe sips her water. Suddenly hit by the sensation that someone is looking at her. She turns towards the bar where an ethereal woman in a red dress is staring at her. She’s noticeably younger than everyone else in the room. Her confident demeanor makes her unapproachable, which explains why she sips a dirty martini alone at the bar. Her lips curl into a smile when her eyes meet Josefine’s. Josie smiles back weakly and deviates her attention back to Nicolo who has entered a full on rant about the Italian Baroque art adorned throughout the room, which echoes Nicolo’s upbringing and taste. He mercilessly drones on about Caravaggio, incognizant to Josefine’s indifference on the subject.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer attention is transfixed on the glass of wine Nicolo mindlessly swirls in his hand as he enunciates the titles of Caravaggio’s most controversial works. Tom feigns interest, nursing his glass of whiskey. Josefine excuses herself and slides into the kitchen for a moment alone where a wine bottle sits on the kitchen counter, open. A glass of Syrah, already poured. Its owner is nowhere to be found. Josefine stands in the kitchen alone with only her demons to keep her company. Arms folded, she glares at the bottle for a long, dreadful moment of indecision, until it passes and she breaks her gaze from the bottle and walks out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe den feels even more filled now than moments ago. She searches for Nicolo in the sea of people, heart suddenly racing. He is nowhere to be found. Her head involuntarily fills with visions of her husband mounted by another woman, riding him like a thoroughbred racehorse. The sex is intense and slightly grotesque, like two wild animals mating. She blinks the thought away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA pool of businessmen disperse, revealing Nicolo by the bar with the woman in the red dress. She stares into his eyes lecherously as her hand slowly travels up his leg incongruous to the way her body moves when she laughs. Josefine moves toward them with intention when she is suddenly intercepted by Tom, who drunkenly slurs his words when he speaks. Josefine stares at the stain of cocktail sauce on his shirt, dodging his breath while he rambles on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Excuse me, Tom. I need to speak with my husband.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe pushes past Tom in the direction of the bar until she realizes Nicolo and the mysterious woman are no longer there. A guest tries to grab her, but she pulls away, pushing through the chaos of bodies. There’s no indication of a woman in red. Suddenly, the room falls silent and we hear Nicolo’s voice emanating from the front of the den. She looks up to find Nicolo standing on a chair, speaking with a pronunciation that evokes alpha. She scans the crowd for the woman but doesn’t see her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I want to thank you all for your hard work and dedication, my wife, for her unwavering loyalty, patience and love…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe crowd gushes and glances at Josefine, who smiles faintly, embarrassed by the attention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Now get the hell out of my house so I can make love to my woman.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHollers and whistling from the crowd. Josefine shifts in discomfort in response to the unwanted attention. Her eyes meet his and for the first time in a long time, she’s filled with a rush of desire to make love to him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMoments later, final stragglers say goodnight to Nicolo. He closes the door, enthusiasm quickly replaced with exhaustion until he catches a glimpse of Josefine descending the stairs in red lingerie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Wow…” He pulls her in close. His hands wander the parts of her body, which feel foreign to him after all this time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Did you like my speech?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe leans her against the wall, pressing his body into her as he slowly undresses her. The feeling of his hands on her skin felt as repulsive as if a spider were crawling on her, causing the lust for him to diminish. She turns her head, finding their reflection in the mirror, growing increasingly perturbed by the sight of him ravenously sucking on her jugular. She draws back, repelled by the pungent smell of sweat mixed with his cologne. He must have wreaked a similar stench when he was inside of that whore, she thought to herself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe meets her gaze, confused, sexually frustrated. “What happened?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe feigns casualty. “Who was that woman you were talking to at the bar?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNicolo treads carefully, sensing the genesis of an argument. He’s not in the mood for it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“What woman?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“The woman in the red dress.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“There was no woman in a red dress at the bar.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I saw you with her, Nicolo.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Why do you always look for something to argue about? Did you forget to take your meds today or something?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Excuse me?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Everything was fine. You were actually enjoying yourself for once. I even heard you laugh. A genuine laugh. You even snorted. And it made me so happy to see you like that again.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I’m sorry. It’s just, when I saw you talking to her… I’m just scared of history repeating itself.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“When are you going to forgive me? I know I fucked up and I shouldn’t have slept with her. I know how crazy things got with the stalking and harassing but she’s not in our lives anymore.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I don’t know how to look at you and not see her.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You can’t keep living in the fucking past Josefine.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo longer in the mood, he ascends the stairs and slams the door shut. Josefine stays rooted to the spot for a long moment before slipping into the kitchen where the bottle of Syrah and glass of wine sit on the counter where she left them. She grabs the glass and abruptly empties it down the drain before she can change her mind, then runs the water in the sink and glances out the window, where she sees the territorial mark her husband left on her neck. She tries to rub it away when a sudden movement in the window reflection steals her attention. The woman in the red dress watches her from the doorway. Alarmed by the intrusion, she gasps and turns around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“The party’s over.” “I’m sorry. The downstairs bathroom was taken so I used the upstairs.” Josefine tries to cover herself up with her arms, which is ineffective and she knows it. The woman eyes her seductively as she approaches her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Don’t hide. Red’s a nice color on you.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe woman pours a glass of Syrah and nurses it while she caresses Josefine’s arm. Her touch doesn’t make Josefine’s skin crawl the way Nicolo’s does. It sends a foreign tingle through her body. Suddenly overwhelmed with the desire for a sexual fix, something she hasn’t felt since the affair, Josefine leans in and kisses the woman on the lips, relishing the taste of wine remnants on her lips. As with any addiction, once you’ve had a taste, the craving becomes insatiable. She gulps the wine down and the tension releases from her body as she allows herself to give into the sensation of the woman’s hand slowly traveling up her leg and underneath her underwear. They rip one another’s clothes off as they kiss and stumble into the den. The other woman smashes Josefine’s body against the mirror, causing it to shatter. Josefine is worked up, panting and moaning until they climax together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe woman picks up her red dress and hands it to Josefine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You keep it. Red looks better on you.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJosefine peels herself from the mirror, now realizing her back is covered in cuts from the impact. She gives the woman a trench coat and walks her to the door where the woman plants a long, heavy kiss on Josefine’s lips before she exits and disappears into the night. Josefine closes the door behind her and returns to the den with a newfound energy to clean up the broken mirror. She picks up a shard of glass, regarding her reflection with an unusual self-admiration. In her peripheral vision, she notices her reflection’s movements lag behind hers. Josefine takes a step towards the mirror, studying her reflection as it mirrors her perfectly. She wipes the smeared lipstick from the corners of her mouth and sucks on her finger, preserving the memory of the passionate kiss with the other woman, then starts to play with herself, watching herself shake and tremble in the mirror. Suddenly, a grunt of pleasure steals her attention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe follows the sound upstairs where the door to the master bedroom is ajar; she pushes it open to reveal the woman in red, making love to Nicolo in her red lingerie, her long legs wrapped around his torso while he fucks her on the dresser. Nicolo buries his face in her neck while he moans of pleasure that he’s been denied for longer than the human body is meant to endure. Caught up in emotion, Josefine’s grip on the shard of glass tightens and she charges at them, pulls Nicolo’s head back and stabs the shard of mirror in his eye.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNicolo screams, holding his eye as he backs away from the woman. Josefine finds the Stefano Ricci tie Nicolo was wearing earlier on the floor and wraps it around his neck, cutting off his circulation until his face turns blue. In a matter of seconds, his remaining eye goes vacant and he drops dead. She stares at her blood covered hands, paralyzed with fear. When she lifts her gaze, the woman is gone. Realizing she is alone with only the voices in her head to keep her company, she starts to cry until she sees her reflection in the mirror. Her expression goes blank. Her reflection looks identical to the other woman. She steps toward it, challenging it. The woman in the mirror follows suit, lips curled into a sardonic smile. Josefine touches her own face, smearing Nicolo’s blood on her cheek. The reflection mimics the motion until it begins moving independently. She applies lipstick and blows a kiss to Josefine. It’s toying with her. Josefine retreats backwards, but this time, her reflection steps forward and emerges from the mirror. Josefine notices the scratch markings on the other woman’s back in the reflection behind her. They are identical to the markings on hers. She runs her fingers across the fresh wounds on her back while the woman walks to the closet, pulls the red dress and holds it in front of Josefine, so she can see her reflection. “You look most beautiful in red.” She gives Josefine one last passionate kiss.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen Josefine opens her eyes, she’s alone again. But this time, she isn’t afraid of the isolation. She revels in it, gaze transfixed on the mirror, infatuated by her own reflection. Her hands explore the red fabric that hugs her curves so complimentary. She lights a cigarette, takes a drag, and disappears into the closet. A long, silent moment passes until clothes are flying in the air and landing on the floor, covering up parts of Nicolo’s lifeless body. The only items remaining in the closet are RED.",

        "text": "     \n\nYou all know those stories online and those stupid tv shows that flow around on the tv like the supernaturals show. The jokes that flow around as the characters portray the easiness of killing these beings of supernatural power it’s all so repulsive to me.\n\nObviously you know that these creatures of the night are real right? But like I said it’s not how the movies and stories portray. No the job that I have is nightmarish and gruelling, you have to be extremely fit and well, your mental health should be above everyone you know, I’ve known people who have thought stupidly that they could easily do this job and have been consumed of darkness inside their own head to the point where they cut their life of with their own hands.\n\nEnough of that foreboding shit. I hunt nightmares. \n\nHere’s some rules that you should follow if you wish to do this job as stupid as you are safely and fairly smart:\n\n1. Cut all ties with family and friends, don’t own any social media. It’s a lot easier to go out without having anything like that holding you back, yes that means no love but it also means that others will not suffer should you fail to kill these nightmares and die.\n\n2. This is probably the most important carry something that can kill you quickly a lot of these horrors of the night will torture you should you lose in a battle.\nThis could be a gun or some pills like cyanide or something of that sort, the gun should be small and lightweight it’s hard to lift the likes of a revolver when your arms or fingers have been ripped from your body. I personally do not care for a gun for that reason so I carry a small pill placed inside my mouth inside a packet which I take with me on every hunt the packet can be dissolved fast inside your stomach acid it’s only a small cyanide pill but I guarantee it would do the job should it ever come to that.\nIt’s just easier to walk about knowing you have a means of quick escape saving you from the agony and pain.\n\n3. Go to the gym. Learn some martial arts get stronger your mental health will become better anyway through means of exercise as your brain releases these thing called endorphins which make you feel good like when you eat a chocolate bar or something. Doing this and learning things on the way is beneficial to you if it ends in hand to hand combat you need to be fast, strong, accurate and have technique. Just do it trust me I have had some close calls myself.\n\n4. Choose a gun over everything I’m not gonna lie I’d rather shoot these fucks from a distance than go in with a blade. Choose a long range weapon like a rifle it should carry enough power to kill the beasts in one shot. You will need training I recommend before any of this you join your countries military, learn your weapon and be taught write everything down and keep it. Also bring along a second weapon and a third just in case things get tight because trust me that shit happens.\n\n5. Clean your fucking weapons, don’t be fucking stupid. Imagine your sat there prone in the grass in a woods around midnight with your gun staring through the sights at one of these fucks your finger slides over the cold trigger and your exhale your last breath before you squeeze the trigger and the shot hits the creature but doesn’t kill it, it knows where you are now you pull the bolt back for a quick second shot only to find the bolt jams.\nYeah yer fucking idiot clean your weapons.\n\n6. Eat and drink whilst hunting keep your energy up. These hunts can last weeks so bring a lot of food and water and some purification tablets in case of emergencies just pack your normal survival kit, and don’t be a dumbass. It’s always best to be able to fall back on a second hand plan.\n\n7. Remember why your doing this, everyone has their reasons for doing this though there aren’t many of us. I have my reasons, you have yours. Maybe something inexplicable ended one of your close ones lives and your a vengeful spirit hunting these fucks down, or maybe you had a personal experience with one of these things and vow in your own head to hunt them down so it doesn’t happen to anyone else. I have my scars and you have yours, it doesn’t make us the same the only thing you have in common with me is you’re decision to hunt them down.- \n\n8. Read up on some of these beings if you can  and speak to other more experienced hunters because like I said these things aren’t how the movies and legends portray them sometimes you will be paired with others and that’s how you join the community. They truly are monsters, killers of sorts. And each and everyone of them has its own nightmarish properties and weaknesses learn them.\n\nThis shit it’s gonna be hard the government knows about these things they will pay you to do the deed of keeping the general population safe and let me tell you it’s a pretty penny and a life of luxury if your good at it. I will share some of my stories and I’m not like all those stupid writers who don’t tell the whereabouts of the places I’ve been I don’t care if your stupid enough not to believe in me and walk into the likes of wales at night alone with nothing but your phone, I’ll find your body don’t worry and I’ll do you the honours of taking it back to your family wether that is in one part, six parts or just your head, I’m nice like that. If you wish to do what I do take caution and choose if you actually want to do this because once your in you can never leave if the government don’t get you, you best believe that we humans aren’t the only hunters out there no these creatures are smart and will learn what you smell or look like or even taste like. You will be hunted and found by something wether that be in a day or month or years to come. Something will find you wether that’s a gun or a nightmare. I’ll tell you my first experience as a hunter in the next part for now goodbye be safe and don’t be stupid.\nAnd I suppose good luck haha your gonna fucking need it.",

You didn’t have to give him such a hard time,” Sidney said.\n\n“I guess you’re right. Something about him just rubbed me the wrong way.”\n\n“Maybe it’s just your jock smooth brain failing to resist the urge to pick on the geek.”\n\n“Matt, if that was true, your life would be a living hell,” he said, ruffling my hair. \n\nI glared up at him, unamused.\n\n“Okay, how are we going to find this next creeper? What did you say it was again?” Sidney chimed in.\n\n“I think he said it’s a suck-me-off.”\n\nSidney rolled her eyes.\n\n“Not funny, Jake. It’s a succubus. Basically, it’s a sex demon that drains the life force from men when they, ya know… do the dirty. The character from that story met her on a dating app called Kinnder. Her name is Jessica, and she has the ability to visit people in their dreams.”\n\n“You have to admit it. ‘Suck-me-off’ wasn’t a bad joke for a sex demon. Come on.” \n\n“It didn’t land, buddy. Take the loss and move on,” Sidney retorted. \n\n“Whatever. How do we find this thing?”\n\n“I think you and I need to download the app and try to match with her. It’s a knock-off Tinder. There can’t be that many people using it.”\n\n“What do I do? Do they even seduce girls?”\n\n“You’re going to be our secret weapon. But for now, just sit there and look pretty.”\n\nColor flushed into Sidney’s face and my heart dropped as I felt my own cheeks blossoming red.\n\n“I didn’t mean… Well, I did, but… I just… I didn’t…”\n\nJake placed a hand on my shoulder. \n\n“Lil’ bro, now it’s *your* turn to take the L and move on.”\n\nI bowed my head in defeat. \n\n“You’ll get her next time, champ,” Jake whispered, tousling my hair again.\n\nI swatted his hand away.\n\n“Let’s just download this stupid app already. I want to get this over with.”\n\nJake and I downloaded Kinnder and we got to swiping. \n\n“Remember, Jake, swipe left on every girl who doesn’t match Jessica’s description. Don’t just look for her name. She could’ve changed it after Jason escaped.”\n\n“Bro, do I have to? There’s so many fine girls on here.”\n\nSidney crossed her arms and narrowed her eyes at him.\n\n“Yes, you moron. Kill the demon, then you can flirt with all the plastic blondes your heart desires.”\n\n“I do like blondes…”\n\n“You know what? I’ll be taking that. If you’re not going to take this seriously, I’ll do it for you.”\n\nSidney snatched the phone from his hand and began furiously swiping left. Jake and I shot each other a glance. \n\n“Fine, have it your way,” he mumbled.\n\nWe swiped for about three hours when exhaustion got the best of us. Needless to say, we had no luck finding Jessica, and Sidney had nearly burrowed a hole in Jake’s phone screen with her relentless swiping. \n\n“Alright, that’s about all I can take for one night. Y’all feel free to keep going, but I’m done for now.”\n\n“I’m with you, bro. I’m beat. Now, give me that,” Jake snarled, tearing his phone from Sidney’s grip.\n\n“Hey, you weren’t even on the app! You were shopping for a new purse. With my debit card information!”\n\n“Oh, yeah, look at the time. We really should be getting to bed. See you boys in the morning,” Sidney said, ushering us out of my own room and slamming the door. \n\n“See you tomorrow, I guess,” I muttered.\n\nI brushed my teeth and mentally prepared myself for another restless night on the couch. I laid down and spread the blanket over myself, barely grazing the tips of my toes. Great. Another night with cold feet. Despite the sofa’s shortcomings, I was out like a light the moment my head hit the pillow. That night I had the most vivid dream of my entire life.\n\nI awoke on a couch in an unfamiliar home. It looked a bit dingy, but nothing out of the ordinary. All the lights were off except for the one in the hallway. Its faint glow illuminated the room in a dim yellow luminescence. I rose to my feet, static blurring my vision from standing too quickly. My whole body felt weighted like I was at the bottom of a swimming pool. I began to laboriously approach the hall. Each step seemed like it lasted an eternity. With bated breath, I gradually reached my destination. \n\n“Hey, sweetheart. I had a feeling you’d be stopping by,” a woman giggled from somewhere in the shadows.\n\nI nearly leapt out of my skin, vainly attempting to steady my pulsating heart. The woman stepped into the flickering light, revealing herself. It was Jessica. She was incredibly gorgeous. Long brown hair cascaded down her back like the most elegant wave I’d ever seen. Black lingerie hugged her body, advertising her petite frame in all the right places. She smiled at me, perfect white teeth sending my head into a frenzy. Her sharp green eyes pierced mine, paralyzing me with their beauty. She curled a finger toward herself, lasciviously motioning for me to meet her.\n\nI subconsciously began drifting toward her. The rational part of my brain screamed at me to stop. Pleaded with me to listen to reason. It was a trap. All just a ruse to steal my life force and reduce my body to nothing more than an empty husk. But the louder part of my brain, that infuriatingly senseless lobe, urged me to continue. Ultimately, my sexual libido won out. I floated helplessly toward the enchantress while a war raged silently on in my head. \n\nI came to a halt directly before her. My lustful impulses overwhelmed me. I gently ran my fingers down her shoulders, resting my hands on her perfect hips. She eyed me salaciously, surveying my body like a viper ready to strike. She slipped her soft hands into mine and pulled me close, whispering into my ear. \n\n“I know what you want. Follow me and I’ll make all your dreams come true.”\n\nMy eyes shimmered with unbridled exhilaration. My heart pounded like a freight train as she began to lead me into a room. My head swam with anxious anticipation… and then I awoke. A deep pit of dread settled in my gut. This was going to be more difficult than I’d thought. \n\nI wearily leaned up. Again, the couch had done no favors for my aching back. Sunlight beamed through the curtains, partially blinding me in my morning haze. I glanced at my phone. I had a new notification from Kinnder. *You got a match!: Jessica*. My blood turned to ice. I threw the blanket off of me, leaping to my feet. I raced to Jake’s room and nearly kicked the door off its hinges.\n\n“Jake! Jake! Wake up, you lazy oaf.”\n\nHe groggily sat up and rubbed his eyes.\n\n“What? You’d better have a good reason for waking m-”\n\n“Check your phone. Do you have anything from the app?”\n\nHe leaned over and tapped the screen. Nothing.\n\n“Looks like we only have one shot at this,” I said, handing him my phone.\n\nHis eyes grew wide.\n\n“Oh, shit. You really matched with her. How do you actually know it’s her?”\n\n“I had a dream. The same dream as Jason did.”\n\n“Well, congrats, bro. I honestly thought you were leading us on a wild goose chase. What are you going to say?”\n\n“I don’t know. I need something good.”\n\n“What did Jason say? He used a pick-up line, right?”\n\n“Yeah. I just need to find a decent one.”\n\n“I don’t know any off the top of my head. Google should be able to lend a hand, though.”\n\nJake began searching for cheesy pick up-lines, while I stared at my phone in disbelief. It actually worked. I was half-expecting the app to be a waste of time myself. \n\n“Got it. This one’s perfect. ‘Are you my appendix? Because I don’t know what you do, but this overwhelming feeling makes me want to take you out,’” Jake grinned smugly. \n\n“Alright. Here goes nothing.”\n\nI sent his pick-up line and awaited a response. It wasn’t long before I received one. Jessica and I began to hit it off immediately. Talking to her was easy. Too easy. I eventually made plans to meet with her that night at her house. Everything was going without a hitch. \n\n“There’s no way picking up girls is really this simple. We already made plans to meet up.”\n\n“Bro, she’s a sex demon. It’s not supposed to be hard.”\n\nSidney wandered into Jake’s room, lazily rubbing her eyes.\n\n“Good morning. Any luck with the succubus?”\n\n“Actually, yes. We’re meeting up tonight at six.”\n\nSidney’s face dropped slightly.\n\n“Are you going to have… you know… sex with her?” she murmured sheepishly.\n\n“No, it’s okay, I’m not going to do anything with her. The plan is to let her think she’s seducing me, while you two sneak in after me and ambush her. Sound good?”\n\n“I guess. But if she lays a finger on you, I swear I’ll fuck her up so bad that she’ll wish she never crawled out of Hell in the first place.”\n\nJake and I glanced at each other wide eyed.\n\n“Uh, thanks? I’ll be fine, though, I promise.”\n\n“You’d better be.”\n\nWe spent the remainder of the day lounging around the house until the evening rolled around. Sidney was in noticeably poor spirits, while Jake cracked jokes, all the while attempting to lift her mood. It wasn’t working.\n\nWe pulled up to a small home in a seedy part of town around ten minutes before six. The grass looked like it hadn’t been cut in months, weeds choking out most of the visible vegetation. I noted that a couple of windows were cracked, and one was missing a pane altogether. Decrepit shudders clung to the walls for dear life, ready to come crashing down at a moment’s notice. A sense of uneasy apprehension engulfed me. I texted Jessica and let her know that I’d arrived. She responded immediately, urging me to let myself in.\n\n“Alright, guys, is everyone clear on what to do?”\n\nJake nodded.\n\n“I don’t know, Matt. I don’t like this,” Sidney said, eyes darting to and fro like ping pong balls.\n\nI slid my hand into hers.\n\n“Sid, it’s going to be okay. Trust me. I’m just going to distract her, and you two will be right behind me.”\n\n“You promise?” \n\nA single tear rolled down her cheek. I gently wiped it away.\n\n“Yes, I promise.”\n\nShe sniffled and wiped her eyes with her sleeve.\n\n“Okay. I believe you.”\n\nI hopped out of the car and crept toward the house. Leaving Sidney behind like that felt wrong, but I knew that I had to push forward with the plan. I tentatively turned the knob and pushed the door ajar. I flashed my friends a quick thumbs up before disappearing inside.\n\nThe house was exactly as it was in my dream. A grungy off-white sofa occupied the dark living room. A dirty brown splotch marred the otherwise spotless carpet. A dim flickering light in the hallway was the only thing illuminating the house, casting dancing shadows across every surface. I timidly called out into the darkness.\n\n“Uh, I’m here. Hello?”\n\n“Right here, baby.”\n\nJessica stepped into the light, revealing the most beautiful goddess I’d ever laid eyes on. She was a mirror image of the woman I’d seen the night before. Long brown hair flowed down her back, tapering off close to her waist. Her skimpy outfit proudly advertised her goods. My eyes drifted to hers, those radiant green spheres casting a spell over me. She smiled, showcasing her flawless white teeth. My heart began thumping like a jack rabbit. She bit her lip promiscuously. \n\n“Come here.”\n\nI did as I was told, physically unable to resist. I met her in the dank hallway, rooted to the spot directly in front of her. I let out a breath I didn’t know I’d been holding. This couldn’t be real. Jessica was absolutely glowing. Her porcelain skin was radiating, enticing me to touch it. I wanted nothing more than to hold her. To run my hands along her perfect frame. But a little voice in the back of my head was screaming at me. Shaming me for even thinking of betraying my promise to Sidney. Jessica placed a finger on my chest, tracing soft circles into it while eyeing me deviously. \n\n“I know you want me. I can make all your worries fade away.”\n\nShe grabbed my hand and lightly dragged me into her bedroom. She directed me to the bed and adopted an erotic pose atop it, splaying herself out before me. I stared at her longingly. A raging cocktail of emotions coursed through me. Part of me knew it was all a trick. But a bigger part of me, one that I feared I wouldn’t have the strength to subdue, urged me to give in. \n\n“Why don’t you join me? You know you want to.”\n\nJessica grinned at me slyly. I couldn’t stop it. I began to undress, shedding my clothes like a husky in the summertime. Jessica watched, eyes glowing with anticipation. I started crawling toward her like an animal. Suddenly, Jessica’s expression shifted to one of pure malice. She slid a knife from beneath one of her pillows. \n\n“You really think I’m that stupid? I know that you and your little friends are here to kill me. You don’t really want me. You want *her.* She’s not going to be able to save you, you know.”\n\nJessica sliced madly toward me, grazing my left forearm. I snapped out of my trance and leapt from the bed. Jake and Sidney burst through the door as I did so. \n\n*Pow.* \n\nI gazed up to see Jake holding my smoking handgun, and a fresh hole in Jessica’s shoulder. She dropped the knife in shock. Sidney glanced at my arm. I could see fire in her eyes. She was seeing red. She charged at Jessica, bowie knife in hand. She went ballistic, bludgeoning Jessica again and again until she was an unrecognizable mess of blood and viscera. Sidney didn’t stop until all that was left was an inky black puddle seeping into the covers. She turned to me with tears in her eyes.\n\n“You said you wouldn’t get hurt. You promised you’d be okay. You promised.” \n\nShe punched my good arm repeatedly as fat tears dripped down her cheeks.\n\n“Hey, hey. I’m okay. It doesn't even hurt. It’s already starting to dry up, see? Nothing a couple of bandaids can’t fix.”\n\n“Are you sure? It looks pretty nasty,” she whimpered.\n\n“Yes, I’m fine. I promise. I’m flattered that you’re so concerned, though,” I said, pulling her into a hug.\n\n“I was so worried… I thought something had happened to you.”\n\nI released her from my grip and stared into her eyes. I again wiped away her tears and took her hand.\n\n“Everything is alright. You saved me. I guess I should thank you.”\n\nColor flushed into her face. \n\n“And I’d do it again too. Stupid skank had it coming.”\n\nI chuckled.\n\n“Yeah, she did. I’ll put my clothes back on and we can get out of here.”\n\n“Good,” Jake said. \n\nI’d completely forgotten he was there. He averted his eyes at the sight of my pale bony body, staring holes into the floor.\n\n“Yeah, let’s get out of here. This place makes my skin crawl,” Sidney mumbled.\n\n“We’ll need to head home and get some rest,” I said, wrestling a sock onto my foot, “we’ve got a demon to banish.”",

No the job that I have is nightmarish and gruelling, you have to be extremely fit and well, your mental health should be above everyone you know, I’ve known people who have thought stupidly that they could easily do this job and have been consumed of darkness inside their own head to the point where they cut their life of with their own hands.\n\nEnough of that foreboding shit. I hunt nightmares. \n\nHere’s some rules that you should follow if you wish to do this job as stupid as you are safely and fairly smart:\n\n1. Cut all ties with family and friends, don’t own any social media. It’s a lot easier to go out without having anything like that holding you back, yes that means no love but it also means that others will not suffer should you fail to kill these nightmares and die.\n\n2. This is probably the most important carry something that can kill you quickly a lot of these horrors of the night will torture you should you lose in a battle.\nThis could be a gun or some pills like cyanide or something of that sort, the gun should be small and lightweight it’s hard to lift the likes of a revolver when your arms or fingers have been ripped from your body. I personally do not care for a gun for that reason so I carry a small pill placed inside my mouth inside a packet which I take with me on every hunt the packet can be dissolved fast inside your stomach acid it’s only a small cyanide pill but I guarantee it would do the job should it ever come to that.\nIt’s just easier to walk about knowing you have a means of quick escape saving you from the agony and pain.\n\n3. Go to the gym. Learn some martial arts get stronger your mental health will become better anyway through means of exercise as your brain releases these thing called endorphins which make you feel good like when you eat a chocolate bar or something. Doing this and learning things on the way is beneficial to you if it ends in hand to hand combat you need to be fast, strong, accurate and have technique. Just do it trust me I have had some close calls myself.\n\n4. Choose a gun over everything I’m not gonna lie I’d rather shoot these fucks from a distance than go in with a blade. Choose a long range weapon like a rifle it should carry enough power to kill the beasts in one shot. You will need training I recommend before any of this you join your countries military, learn your weapon and be taught write everything down and keep it. Also bring along a second weapon and a third just in case things get tight because trust me that shit happens.\n\n5. Clean your fucking weapons, don’t be fucking stupid. Imagine your sat there prone in the grass in a woods around midnight with your gun staring through the sights at one of these fucks your finger slides over the cold trigger and your exhale your last breath before you squeeze the trigger and the shot hits the creature but doesn’t kill it, it knows where you are now you pull the bolt back for a quick second shot only to find the bolt jams.\nYeah yer fucking idiot clean your weapons.\n\n6. Eat and drink whilst hunting keep your energy up. These hunts can last weeks so bring a lot of food and water and some purification tablets in case of emergencies just pack your normal survival kit, and don’t be a dumbass. It’s always best to be able to fall back on a second hand plan.\n\n7. Remember why your doing this, everyone has their reasons for doing this though there aren’t many of us. I have my reasons, you have yours. Maybe something inexplicable ended one of your close ones lives and your a vengeful spirit hunting these fucks down, or maybe you had a personal experience with one of these things and vow in your own head to hunt them down so it doesn’t happen to anyone else. I have my scars and you have yours, it doesn’t make us the same the only thing you have in common with me is you’re decision to hunt them down.- \n\n8. Read up on some of these beings if you can  and speak to other more experienced hunters because like I said these things aren’t how the movies and legends portray them sometimes you will be paired with others and that’s how you join the community. They truly are monsters, killers of sorts. And each and everyone of them has its own nightmarish properties and weaknesses learn them.\n\nThis shit it’s gonna be hard the government knows about these things they will pay you to do the deed of keeping the general population safe and let me tell you it’s a pretty penny and a life of luxury if your good at it. I will share some of my stories and I’m not like all those stupid writers who don’t tell the whereabouts of the places I’ve been I don’t care if your stupid enough not to believe in me and walk into the likes of wales at night alone with nothing but your phone, I’ll find your body don’t worry and I’ll do you the honours of taking it back to your family wether that is in one part, six parts or just your head, I’m nice like that. If you wish to do what I do take caution and choose if you actually want to do this because once your in you can never leave if the government don’t get you, you best believe that we humans aren’t the only hunters out there no these creatures are smart and will learn what you smell or look like or even taste like. You will be hunted and found by something wether that be in a day or month or years to come. Something will find you wether that’s a gun or a nightmare. I’ll tell you my first experience as a hunter in the next part for now goodbye be safe and don’t be stupid.\nAnd I suppose good luck haha your gonna fucking need it.",

        "text": "I was so thin that I could’ve folded myself in half. My arms reached to the floor from hunched shoulders. My knuckles dragged against the carpet just feet behind me. The dark circles under my eyes held my tired skin so tightly I thought it might rip, sending my bloodshot eyes cascading to the floor. The teeth in my mouth ached, yellow, rotted, surrounded by perpetually bleeding gums. I set a reminder on my phone to schedule a dentist appointment. \n\nUgliness is something I was no stranger to, I had been ugly since the day I was born. My eyes were too small. The bridge of my nose too wide. My lips were purple, chapped, and uneven. My mom had called me her bundle of joy but I knew she never meant it. In fact, my older sister told me the story of when my mom asked the doctor at my 4-week-old appointment if there was some sort of birth defect she wasn’t aware of. While I was perfectly healthy, I was the ugly duckling. \n\nThis did not change with age. I remained the eyesore throughout elementary school, middle school, and high school. The bullying was so bad that after two years of public schooling, my mom pulled me out and put me in an online program. At home, alone, for most of the days of the week, I learned to conceal my horrific face with food. The kitchen didn’t have a mirror, you see. I ate and ate and ate until my belly bulged and the acid reflux from an over-filled stomach threatened to send all of the precious calories up and out of my throat. I didn’t start to do that on purpose until later.\n\nAt the age of 18, I had to make a decision; I could either stay in my parent’s home and go to college online, or I had to move into the city and do the program at my local college. My introverted nature begged me to stay home. My parents were wary about me leaving the home, wanting to shield me from the humiliation of displaying my unsightly, obese form in public. But, the online school didn’t have a musical arts program. I chose to move into the dormitory two hours from home and attend school in-person for the first time in 11 years. \n\nI am not gifted with musical ability. But, when you’re home for hours upon hours alone, you fill them with hobbies. My dad brought me home a used viola he found online when I was eight. He taught me the basics of reading music and playing, as much as he knew. I took it upon myself to learn more. Mostly I watched tutorials online and learned from the masters of YouTube. After three years, I was quite good. My dad upgraded my viola, and I stuck with it. I loved the way that my long, spindly fingers looked graceful and elegant while holding the bow and manipulating the strings. I loved that people didn’t have to look at me to hear the music I played. \n\nWhile my older sister, Eloise, went to parties, dated boys, attended dances, and cared little for what happened after high school, I bettered my skill. I even auditioned for a scholarship to the college I had chosen and got it. When I moved into the dormitory, my parents made sure that it was one where I could have my own room but a shared common area. As she and my dad finished helping me move my things into the room, she took me by the shoulders and said, \n\n“Life will always be harder for you, Elaine. It will never be easy, or even fair. But, I am proud of you for coming out of your shell and choosing to do this. Make friends who have similar interests, keep your circle small, and don’t ever, ever, let anyone bring you down.”\n\nDespite what my mom had told me, people did in fact bring me down. College was not nearly as bad as my elementary school years, but people were still cruel. They were just a bit more quiet about it. But I heard the whispers. I heard the jokes at my expense. I heard the in-between-the-lines insults that people so boldly said to my face. They assumed my quiet demeanor meant that I was simple, stupid. They thought that when I didn’t retaliate, I was okay with the way I was treated. \n\nAnd so it began. The first year of college I dropped 50 pounds in my first semester. By the time my second year began, I was down 200. I was sitting at a healthy weight of 150, though I had not achieved it through healthy methods. My parents, so proud of their ugly duckling for making an effort, paid for my excess skin to be removed. At the end of my four year degree, I was 99 pounds. \n\nI was still ugly, but at least I wasn’t fat anymore. People treated me better, as if by ridding myself of excess fat I had done them a service. They preferred the skeleton to the ogre. Maybe they thought that my brittle body, my sad little bones, couldn’t handle the same amount of verbal abuse that my meatsuit had. Maybe they could see my organs failing and decided not to tempt fate with their cruel words anymore. \n\nWith my degree in hand, I took a job teaching music at a local high school. This job did not pay enough, so I also started teaching private viola lessons on the side. For the first time in my life, I was not ashamed of myself. I was doing what I loved, I was thin enough to be visually socially acceptable, and I was independent. In teaching my private lessons, I met a young girl named Ruby. \n\nRuby was 11 and had taken piano lessons since she was five. She was exceptionally skilled at the piano, playing pieces such as Debussy’s Serenade for the Doll. When her mom contacted me through an ad I had put up on the local classifieds, she said that Ruby had grown bored of piano and wanted to try a string instrument. I typically taught more advanced players, those who had some experience with the viola, but her mom offered to pay me 1.5 times my rate to teach her daughter. \n\nRuby excelled. After two months, she was playing pieces that my senior students struggled with. It was obvious that she practiced, meticulously, outside of our once-a-week sessions. Even inside of our sessions, she never wanted to chit-chat or speak of anything other than music. She took criticism with ease, she never got frustrated with herself for messing up, and when she performed, she let the music work through her instead of from her. She reminded me much of myself at that age. I respected her, and she respected me. \n\nOne day after our lesson as I was packing up my own instrument, she asked me a question. \n\n“Miss Creek, are you sad?” \n\nShe looked embarrassed at the question. Ruby had not asked me about myself much at all, content to keep our conversations focused on music. \n\nCaught off guard, I waited a moment before responding, “I am happier than I have ever been.”\n\nRuby looked at me, thoughtfully. She had years of wisdom behind her youthful eyes. She went to speak, but stopped herself. \n\n“Why do you ask?” I prodded. \n\nShe shrugged, “I feel bad for you.”\n\nInstantly, my mind knew she was talking about the state of my appearance. My too long arms and fingers. My hunched shoulders. My despicable looking mouth, the lips that never seemed to gain moisture from the products I put on them and teeth that no dentist could fix without ripping them all out and starting over. My eyes, beady and uncomfortable. My hair, too thin and mousy. My skin, scarred from acne and a sickly color.\n\n“I do not let the mirror dictate my happiness,” I replied simply. \n\nI looked at her then, with her full, rosy cheeks. Her soft brown eyes framed by long blond eyelashes. The long, thick blond hair that her mother had tied into a half bun. Her pouty lips, pink and sweet. Her teeth, big and white, though crooked. Braces could fix that in a year or so. Ruby would be as beautiful an adult as she was a child. A pang of jealousy ran through me. \n\n“I mean, why don’t you eat?” Ruby asked. \n\nI was quite taken aback. “I eat,” I said. \n\n“Not enough,” she replied. \n\nI shrugged, “I used to be very large.”\n\n“And now you’re very skinny.”\n\nI felt my eye twitch. “I’m on a special diet now, and it has helped me immensely.”\n\nI left our meeting hastily after that, not wanting the child’s questions to further infiltrate me. Today, as I stare in the mirror, I wonder about my life choices. I wonder if I should have traded honey buns and nutty buddies for my thinness. I pinch the lifeless skin of my cheeks, my fingers urging a blush to sprout. I stare at my sunken stomach, my flat chest, the space between my thighs that used to be clouded with mounds of gluttony. \n\nI decide, as I decided long ago, that my figure is optimal. I avoid my face and trace my bony fingers along the sharp features of my figure. I worship the dedication to my diet, and how my life has changed for the better because of it. I do not let Ruby’s words make me sad because I am happy. I am happy that I am where I am, despite where I have been. \n\nI decide that Ruby will be the next addition to my diet, as my supply of meat in the freezer is running low and I must have at least some calories to sustain myself. I will tell her, as I have told the others, what keeps my body looking so beautiful. I will tell her that her sustenance is vital to my form. I will savor each of her talented fingers, served on a bed of rice with scallions and sauce. And I will thank my dear roommate from college for introducing me to the carnivore diet again when we meet for coffee, our skeletons embracing before we sit and speak of the way our lives are good while ignoring one another’s ugly faces.",

        "text": "I’ll be honest; I squeezed my eyes shut for most of [our journey](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1156ldn/ashes_to_ashes_the_bar_at_the_edge_of_reality/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Good thing too, because my stomach still rolled like I was on a tiny fishing boat in the middle of a stormy ocean, even without looking. I didn’t open them until, at some point that could have been seconds or hours later, I felt Asher release his tight grip on my arm.\n\n“Alright, we’re here. You can stop scrunching up your face now,” he said, sounding amused. “You look constipated.”\n\n“Better than vomiting all over my shoes,” I grumbled, opening my eyes to find Milo doing just that: puking his guts out. Acacia had apparently taken him along on her shadow travels, because she stood next to him looking completely unfazed. \n\nI watched Milo straighten up, his skin tinged blue with nausea. Poor Milo. He’d never shadow traveled before; I hadn’t gotten a chance to warn him to shut his eyes. Sure, I didn’t feel *great* now—my stomach felt like it might still decide to give up its contents with one wrong move—but I was better off than the first time I’d been dragged along with Asher.\n\n“That *sucked,*” said Milo, with great emphasis. “I would like to never do that again. Remind me to take you on a long swim through a tropical storm sometime, return the favor.”\n\n“Remind *me* to leave you behind next time instead,” countered Acacia. “Since you clearly would have preferred that?” She was smirking, her dark eyes twinkling in amusement. \n\n“No, no,” said Milo hastily. “Let’s not make any rash decisions here.”\n\nI grinned as their good-natured argument continued. Now that the nausea was fading, I began to look around. We appeared to be at the very edge of the dark forests, standing at the tree line, with rolling gray plains stretched out ahead of us. The landscape was broken only by occasional dark rocks and even darker trees, dotting the long grass over the hills. And off in the distance, if I squinted, I could make out glimmers of blue and gold on the horizon: a city. The closest to the forests they’d dare to build a Neverland city.\n\nI’d never been on this edge of the forests before. It was certainly more appealing than the icy tundra where I’d met Jacian—though I had no doubt that if we lingered long enough here, we were sure to run into someone or something just as hungry.\n\nEverything that had just happened was still racing around in my head, and without even meaning to, my gaze drifted down to the balled-up napkin I held in my fist. It *had* to be proof that the same murderer who had killed the human priest had killed the little harbinger girl. Which meant it had to be the same murderer who’d killed all the others.\n\nWhich meant that the murderer knew about Griffin’s Edge, and by extension, about me.\n\nAsher nodded at the napkin. “You said something about the human priest you found?”\n\nThat’s right: I had told them about the priest, but not about the napkin. “Yeah,” I said. “There was a napkin just like this one—from Henri’s bar—in his fist. That’s why I thought it was the same killer who’d murdered the inhumans, traveling across dimensions.”\n\nAcacia was staring at it, too, something like dread written across her face, any echoes of laughter from seconds ago long gone. “But we’d never even *heard* of the murders until you told us. No one in Oasis had.”\n\nI think we’d all already put it together, but I had to say it anyway, to make it seem *real.* I swallowed hard. “I know,” I said softly. “And that would mean that *I* brought the murderer to you. I must have.” I waved the napkin for emphasis. “Clearly this was meant for me to find. *Both* times. Maybe the murderer didn’t know about Oasis before, or maybe he just didn’t care enough to come there—I mean, no offense, but a harbinger dying when no one realized you still existed wouldn’t exactly make headlines. But now…he must’ve followed us. Followed *me.*”\n\n“And made it look like *you* killed that girl,” added Milo. “Smart.”\n\nI rolled my eyes. “Yeah, credit where credit is due, I guess.”\n\nMeanwhile, a slow smile was spreading over Asher’s face, almost mischievous. “Don’t you see?” he said excitedly. “This means we’re on the right track! It was a warning. The murderer is scared. He wouldn’t have *come to the dark forests* just to make a point if he wasn’t. No one comes to the dark forests without a really good reason.” He glanced sideways at me. “Well, except for you. All those times you popped up accidentally.”\n\nI waved my hand dismissively. “Old news.”\n\nMilo nudged my shoulder, blue eyes twinkling. “What are we waiting for, then? Let’s scare the pants off this guy. Lead the way into the fog, O Great and Valiant Errand Boy.”\n\nWith another roll of my eyes, I reached out a hand to feel the fabric of reality around us. Beyond the forest’s border, the air moved more easily, the ripples of time and space easier to sense. I stepped forward, following the flow of the invisible fabric, feeling for any threads, any tears—\n\nThere it was. A little to the left, a few steps out of the tree line. I gestured to the slight shimmer in the air. “Found a gap. Let’s go.”\n\nWe went through one-by-one, each holding onto the hand of the person after us, like a chain of little kids on a field trip. I went first, of course, as the resident expert in dimension travel. And only a few seconds later, the four of us were standing in a row along the path in front of Griffin’s Edge.\n\n“*So* much better than your method,” Milo whispered to Asher.\n\nI couldn’t help staring at the bar, at the familiar sign above its door, at the crowds packed wall-to-wall I could make out through the windows. No doubt it was packed with terrified inhumans as it had been for weeks. Maybe even *more* crowded if Sky had gotten the chance to publicize the fact that harbingers were still alive.\n\nMy heart ached to run inside, to check on Uncle Henri, make sure he was okay. And as I continued to stare, Milo’s arm wrapped around my shoulder. “He’s fine,” whispered Milo. \n\nI nodded, blinking back tears that I hadn’t even realized were there. Henri could handle himself. He’d even managed to get us a lead, and I couldn’t risk someone else like Sky—or even the murderer himself, since he’d clearly been to the bar—trying to stop me if I went inside. Not to mention that I couldn’t bring Asher and Acacia in, but leaving them out here in the fog where anyone could find them also seemed like a terrible idea.\n\nNo, I had to follow the arrow on Henri’s scribbled drawing. [Griffin's Edge](https://www.griffinsedgebar.com/) would still be there when or if I came home.\n\nSo, with a deep breath, I turned *away* from the paths for the first time in my life and began to march into the endless expanse of silver fog.\n\nMilo, Asher, and Acacia stayed close as I moved forward. It only took a few seconds before the bar vanished into the shifting fog, leaving us completely surrounded by nothing but thick silver mist. It felt like we were inside the world’s largest, densest cloud.\n\nI didn’t really know where to go from here, but even if I *had,* I don’t think it’d have done me much good. It was impossible to tell which direction was which. I guess we had just had to keep going and hope that eventually, we ran into something. Preferably something that wasn’t carnivorous.\n\n“You really think there’s anything out here?” whispered Milo. His voice seemed to echo in all directions, reverberating through the fog.\n\n“No idea,” I whispered back. \n\n“I kind of like it,” said Asher. “Feels peaceful.”\n\n“Feels creepy,” corrected Milo. “You’re insane.”\n\nAsher shrugged. “I mean, it’s not so different from the dark forests. All looks the same. All one color. But there’s less here that wants to eat me.”\n\n“As far as we know, at least,” Acacia pointed out.\n\nEach word they spoke, even though their voices were quiet, echoed through the fog. So did our footsteps, despite the fact that I couldn’t see any ground—more silver mist surrounded our feet, as if we were walking on smoke. \n\nSuddenly I stopped walking. I felt…weird. It had come out of nowhere; one second I was fine and the next I felt oddly dizzy, like I’d just spun in a circle for too long. The world seemed to tilt around me, and I sank to the ground with a groan.\n\nI heard the others faintly calling my name, but their voices seemed very muffled, very distant, as if I was underwater. Even the hands on my shoulders seemed far away—I knew they were there, but I didn’t really *feel* them. My mind didn’t quite seem connected to my body.\n\nInstead, I found myself staring ahead of us, out into the never-ending fog. I could have sworn I heard something *else* calling my name from somewhere in the mist, an old, layered voice that creaked with time and power. And despite the fact that my friends were right next to me and the voice was no doubt far in the distance, I heard its words with perfect crystalline clarity, as if they were being whispered directly into my ear.\n\n*Ian,* it called. *Ian Griffin…you are so close. Come to me. Find what is yours. Ian…*\n\nIt filled my head, so loud I could barely think, reverberating though every corner of my brain. And yet I felt calm. Its voice seemed to call me to it, to draw me in with a magnetic force I couldn’t break.\n\nThe Ancient One knew who I was, and it was beckoning me to it.\n\nI hadn’t even realized I’d closed my eyes, but I guess I had, because I opened them to find a sparkling silver line leading into the fog. A shimmering thread, thin but bright, as if someone had unwound a glittering ball of yarn to lead the way.\n\nThe dizziness vanished as quickly as it had come, and I slowly got to my feet, never taking my eyes off the silver path. I was certain it led to the Ancient One. It had to.\n\n“Oh thank God, you’re not dying,” said Milo with enormous relief as I straightened up. “What *was* that? Are you okay?”\n\n“Do you see the thread?” My voice was barely a whisper; I hadn’t realized how dry my throat suddenly felt.\n\nMilo slowly turned to follow my gaze, but even when he appeared to be looking directly at it—I saw the glint of silver reflected in his glasses—he shook his head. “Ian, I don’t see anything.”\n\n“Maybe he’s going crazy,” suggested Asher. \n\n“You don’t see it either?”\n\nAcacia and Asher both looked. Considering the worry on their faces instead of shock or awe, I knew the silver thread was invisible to them too before they even said anything. “There’s nothing there,” whispered Acacia hesitantly. “Not for our eyes, anyway.”\n\nI still refused to look away, just in case breaking the line of sight would cause the thread to vanish. “I see a silver line,” I said. “I heard something, too. A voice, calling me. I think it’s the Ancient One.”\n\nAny concern or doubt on Asher’s face was immediately replaced with excitement. “I *knew* it existed! It must want us to find it!”\n\n“Seems like that,” I agreed. “Could’ve done without the dizziness, though.”\n\n“Well, what are we waiting for?” Asher grabbed my arm and pulled me forward with a surprising strength, causing me to stumble and nearly lose my balance. He did not seem to notice. “Lead the way!”\n\n“I *would*, if you’d let go of my arm and—” \n\nI didn’t finish the thought, because suddenly there was a low growling from the fog. Asher and I froze, and he slowly released his grip on my arm to reach for one of the knives in his boot instead. \n\n“Maybe that was a friendly growl,” whispered Milo hopefully. \n\nTurns out, it wasn’t. A moment later, there was another growl, and this one was louder, angrier—and closer. I reached for my lighter carefully—\n\nAnd something exploded out of the fog directly to my left. It happened so fast. All I know is that a large, dark shape burst out of the silver mist at an inhuman speed, sank its teeth into my left arm—and my *God,* did they hurt, I think they hit the bone—and immediately jerked me back the way it had come, so fast and so forcefully that I nearly blacked out in pain as my arm threatened to be torn out of its socket.\n\nI heard Asher, Milo, and Acacia all yell, felt something whistle by—probably Asher’s knife—but they weren’t quick enough. The fog closed around me and my captor immediately; my friends were lost to the endless blanket of silver, and as the footsteps and screams echoed around us, I knew they’d have no way to tell which direction I’d been taken. Tracking us would be impossible.\n\nI tried to fight against the beast dragging me along from its mouth like a chew toy. I was pretty sure it was some kind of dog or wolf, based on the thick dark fur and heavy panting noises it made as it carried me, fangs still deep in my arm. But there wasn’t much fighting I could do. Its mouth alone was nearly as big as my entire body, and like I said before, I was dangerously close to blacking out—*again*—from the pain.\n\nI don’t know how long it ran before stopping and unceremoniously dropping me to the ground, pulling its teeth out of my arm slowly and painfully. I groaned and made no move to get up. However long it had been, I knew I couldn’t hear my friends anymore, not even the echoes of their frantic calls. \n\nBut we were still in the fog. Just endless silver mist. Me, and this monster dog.\n\nBecause I realized for sure now that it *was* a dog. Well, mostly. I squinted through the dark spots dancing in my vision to make out a massive, black wolf-like creature, except that it had crooked antlers on its head, above its pointed ears. Oh, and it had an extra eye in the middle of its forehead: three large amber eyes, all staring at me.\n\nIt growled as I made eye contact. “Sorry,” I muttered, and just looked up above at the swirling fog instead. I wasn’t really sure why I was apologizing to the beast that had just kidnapped me and nearly ripped my arm off. Call it instinct, I guess. I’ve spent a lot of time around inhumans and monsters, after all, and I was pretty sure this dog hadn’t attacked me of its own accord.\n\nFor one, it was clearly from the dark forests. There was no way it would even be here without instruction or force. For another, it wasn’t continuing to attack me. It was sitting over me, keeping up a steady low growl, while its middle eye looked at me and its other two looked off into the fog.\n\nLike it was waiting on someone.\n\nI tried to sit up. The wolf reached out a massive paw and smacked me back onto the ground, knocking the breath out of me. I wheezed as I felt the impact on my shoulder. There was a lot of blood soaking through my sleeve from where its fangs had pierced the skin and muscle and hell, maybe even bone. I was also pretty sure my arm was dislocated.\n\nI groaned again, just in time for the wolf’s ears to perk up and its third eye to join the other two in looking into the fog. Cursing under my breath, I used its distraction to throw myself onto my feet, wincing at the jolts of pain and spots of black dancing across my eyes. But I made it; the wolf merely flicked its ear as I staggered upright and reached for Sgrios with my good hand.\n\nI can’t accurately describe to you the feeling that came over me when the dark figure emerged from the fog. And I know what you’re thinking: *Ian, you’re sure getting a lot of weird feelings lately.* Trust me, I know. I’m not exactly a fan of them either. Here I was, thinking my life couldn’t get weirder than me jumping between dimensions and running errands for drunk dwarves…and promptly getting proven wrong.\n\nHopefully Ian’s Weird Feelings lead to answers soon, but for now all I’ve got for you is the fact that yes, I had another one when I saw the figure. It was a humanoid shape, though I couldn’t make out any features due to the dark clothing and cloak he wore. And when I saw it…well, the best I can relate it to is an overwhelming sense of dread, and yet, somehow, *connection.* Like I knew this person or thing, and like *it* knew *me.*\n\nI raised Sgrios in my good hand, keeping it pointed at my new companion. “Real kind of you to send your dog after me. Great opener. I really enjoy starting new relationships by having my arm dislocated.”\n\nThe figure didn’t say anything. He simply stood there, motionless, and though I could only see the shadows of a face under his cloak, I could feel his eyes on me. “What? Nothing to say?” \n\nUnease prickled through me as we continued to face each other, silence broken only by the wolf’s quiet growls. Something about the presence of this person was oddly familiar—I couldn’t quite put my finger on it, but I *knew* I’d encountered him before. \n\nIt didn’t help that my mind was both dull with pain and attempting to sift through the many potential memories and connections that might be relevant. It felt like my brain was trying to swim through molasses. Nothing was clicking.\n\nNew tactic. “What do you want?” I said. The words, like everything else, echoed. “How are you even out here in this fog? Why did you want *me?* I mean, if you like seafood, Milo’s objectively tastier.” \n\nMy joking tone fell utterly flat. And apparently I’d *really* annoyed it, because there was a pause—and then the figure flung itself forward, pulling out some kind of thin blade from beneath its cloak as it did so. \n\nI cursed and swung Sgrios, trying to keep my balance, but it turns out it’s not so easy to do that with one dislocated arm. The figure avoided my ungraceful knife slashes and crashed into me, sending me flying backwards. I landed *hard* on the invisible ground, immediately wheezing for breath as pain exploded both in my shoulder and my back. \n\nThe figure followed me to the ground, and as it tackled me, as I tried to struggle and get a good stab in with my knife, its hands closed around my throat. \n\nAnd that’s when something finally clicked in my sluggish brain: the dream I’d had when Orion had tried to strangle me. The silver eyes, the attacker who made them vanish—it hadn’t just been a dream. This was the same attacker.\n\nNo idea what that meant. I’d have to figure it out later, because the dark spots in my vision were rapidly expanding as I gasped for breath. One arm wasn’t enough to fight him off me. \n\nWhich left only one option. Gritting my teeth, I threw all my force into rolling over, muffling a scream as my dislocated shoulder took the weight. But it was enough. I’d surprised him, and now *I* pinned him, rolling straight into a thrust of Sgrios into his side.\n\nI tried to get a look at his face, but my element of shock didn’t last long enough. I felt warm liquid ooze over my good hand as I ripped Sgrios from his skin—and that was all. Then he’d thrown me off, and once again I found myself on the ground, silver mist rolling around me, dangerously close to blacking out.\n\nMan, one of these times I’d really like to maintain consciousness for an entire fight. At this rate, it seems like that’s maybe too much to ask.\n\nI didn’t have any fight left. I’d used all my strength on that last maneuver, and my arm felt like it was on fire. I cursed mentally. Even if my attacker didn’t want to kill me, I was sure whatever came next wasn’t going to be fun.\n\nThen, just as I blinked slowly, vision darkening, I saw it. The silver thread had reappeared. One second it wasn’t there, and the next, after one blink, it was back! And the voice came a second later. *Ian,* it whispered, creaking with age, *You are safe now. Come to me.* \n\n“I tried,” I murmured, at the same time that the figure shrieked wordlessly, furiously, and lunged forward after me. \n\nI hadn’t even realized I was moving, but apparently I was, and my attacker didn’t like it. I saw the dark figure and the antlered wolf vanish into the fog, and vaguely noticed that it felt like I was floating, though it was hard to tell, since the mist was moving around me too. But the silver thread seemed to pull me along its length, and the voice whispered to me that I was safe, and that I’d be there soon.\n\nAnd somehow, it made me calm, like its voice was a lullaby I’d known once but forgotten, and I found myself lulled into sleep as it carried me through the silver fog.",

        "text": "Hello Reddit. I want to apologise in advance, as I am an old fart who is bad with computers and my English is not that great. I used both Google Translate and some help of my grandson to write this text. From 1978-1987, I was the observer of the Nightcaller Unit, a secret unit of the fire department of the small village of Vijvergem, Belgium. Even though it was very scary and dangerous, it was probably the most fascinating job I have ever had in my life. And I want to share some stories about this job with you. I will first give you a little bit of a backstory. \n\nI grew up in Vijvergem, a little village near the city of Ypres, Belgium. Just like any other small village in Belgium, Vijvergem had brick houses, a church, some stores and a pub. As a kid, I loved growing up there. In the summer, my friends and I would play in the grain fields, steal corn cobs, dig in the earth for war relics or ride our bicycles to Ypres for ice cream. During the winter, the ponds would freeze over and turn into ice patches on which we ice skated. Vijvergem also has a fascinating history. It was founded in 1919 by Alfred Vandenvijver, a Belgian farmer who decided to build his new farm on top of a former WWI trench system after his old farm got bombed by the Germans. The fields surrounding his new farm turned out to be very fertile, which allowed the farm to bloom and grow into the lovely farming village that I know today. Vijvergem however has a dark tradition. It’s the reason why you can’t find it on any map. We call our tradition ‘Nachtroep’, roughly translated to English as ‘Nightcall’. \n\nWay back in the summer of 1919, when Alfred Vandenvijver first started building his new farm, he began to notice strange things happening around the farm. For example, every couple of days, he would find scorch marks in his grain fields. Sometimes, his cows would go missing, only to be found later that day in a tree or on the roof of one of his buildings. In very rare cases, he found his animals back dead. Apart from those strange occurrences, everything seemed normal in Vijvergem, until 6 June 1925. That is the day of the first attack.\n\nAround midnight, people started reporting strange noises, like growling, hissing and a faint whistling. Some people also noted feeling warm wind and smelling a burning smell. Suddenly, about two hours after the first reports, a human-like creature rose out of the murky water from one of the ponds. This creature, nicknamed ‘Groote Fritz’ (or ‘Big Fritz’ when roughly translated to English) by us, was first sighted that same night by Marie Vanacker and Jef Vandeschelde, a young couple who were abruptly disturbed during a naughty session. Jef, trying to defend Marie, unfortunately became the first of many victims that night. In total, Big Fritz took the lives of 13 people and laid 4 houses in ashes. \n\nThe description of Big Fritz given by Marie is still the most detailed we have to this day. She described him as a human-like creature, about 2 metres in height. His skin is as black as coal and has a ‘molten’ texture. His face, if he even has a face, is hidden by a WWI German gas mask. The filter of the gas mask is smudged with blood and dripping a murky type of slime. He wears a ring-shaped device on his back, which constantly releases a hissing noise. Later reports and observations confirmed this device is a Wechselapparat (or Wex), a WWI German flamethrower.\n\nBig Fritz would appear around once a week at night in an irregular pattern and often from a different pond. There are 12 ponds in total in Vijvergem, so it was very hard to predict from which pond Big Fritz would appear. Most of the time, Big Fritz would walk around aimlessly and do nothing. But, when he noticed a light, he would go towards it and look at it for hours. If there were people around, he would become angry and use the Wex to burn them to death. After 3-4 hours of walking around, he would go back to the pond he came from. \n\nAfter the third attack on 17 June 1925, Alfred Vandenvijver found the ‘Nachtroepers’ (or ‘Nightcaller Unit’ when roughly translated to English), a group of three firefighters whose job was to control both the creature and his destruction. The Unit consisted of three members: the observer, the warden and the extinguisher. The observer sat high in a watchtower. His job was to map out the path Big Fritz took every time he showed up. He also tallied how many houses he burned down. The warden went around and made sure everyone in the village was inside by 1 o’clock sharp. He also made sure all doors and windows of each house were locked and all lights were out, as any source of light attracted Big Fritz. After that, he drove around the village in a car and made sure all doors and windows were kept closed and all lights were kept out throughout the entire night. The extinguisher had probably the most dangerous job of the three. He first had to switch on a bright light in a field far away from the village. Next, he had to follow Big Fritz from a distance and try to extinguish any fires he started. Extinguishers got the highest pay, but often quit the job after only a couple of years, because they were either too traumatised, too wounded or dead.\n\nI myself was the observer of the Nightcaller Unit for 9 long years. I started in 1978, right after the big attack of the 12th of July. It was probably one of the worst attacks I have ever seen in my life. Somehow, Big Fritz managed to burn down the watch tower, which not only killed the observer, but also allowed the fire to spread towards the village. In total, 7 houses burned down and 11 people were killed, including all members of the Nightcaller Unit. The next day, three new Nightcallers were chosen. Me, being 18 years old and dumb, volunteered to become the observer.\n\nMy hands are getting tired from typing, but I would love to tell you some of my stories. I will try to type out a couple of them by next weekend. Thank you for reading and understanding.",
