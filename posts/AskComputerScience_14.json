Is this correct? Curious since I prefer more application stuffs since not great at theory",

A new armor was just released tonight, and the reddit comment thread for the game has a lot of comments griping about clipping.\nSo, what's the deal?  I imagine what's holding back clipping must be a monumental task, or else clipping would've went the way of the dodo already.  \n\nCould we end clipping on say, games with the polygon count of your average Nintendo 64 game?  Is it *practically* unsolvable?  Is it practically unsolvable for only the near future, or is it reasonable to expect clipping is here to stay into the foreseeable eternity?",

But I'm leaving my post because I still want to learn, this error doesn't invalidate my question, and I'll probably get more attention from people hoping to point out my obvious error.*\n\nI actually have 3 questions but I can't fit it into the title.\n\n1. Why doesn't Caps Lock work on number keys? Is there a historic reason? \n\n2. Why doesn't Caps Lock make keys behave the same as Shift+Key? (i.e. this post's title)\n\n3. Why *does* Fn Lock make keys behave the same, unlike Caps Lock? \n\n-----\n\nIt's my understanding that keyboards are layer-based.\n\nSo on a standard QWERTY layout for example, your normal keys send lowercase scan codes and numbers. We could call this *layer 1*. \n\nPressing/holding Shift takes you to *level 2* which has uppercase scan codes and symbols. \n\nSome keyboards, like QWERTZ or ISO have an Alt Graph or Fn key which we could call *layer 3* that has even more symbols or various characters with diacritical marks.\n\nThe Caps Lock key, doesn't so much as make uppercase letters as much as it locks you into layer 2. And for those 3-layer layouts? Well they ~~usually~~ sometimes have an Fn Lock key that locks you into layer 3.\n\nI can't remember the name but there was a LISP-machine keyboard at MIT that had like 5 or 6 layers and a lock key for each, so it's clearly not a logistical issue.\n\nHow do scan codes work?",

Those are the details of the letter itself, even if it has no relevance to the *idea* of the letter 'A'.  Every letter has its own combination of arbitrary lines like this, in the same way that every assembly language instruction has a physical arrangement of logic gates.\n\nCombining letters together into words is like making data structures out of individual assembly instructions.  Combining words into sentences is like using algorithms on data structures to make functions (e.g. a program's search function).\n\nCombining sentences together to make a short story or novel is like combining these functions (e.g. search function, updater, cached lists) into a program.\n\nHow accurate is this analogy?\n\n",

As humanity(in my perception) we have so many scientific problems that consist environmental impacts, particles, neuroscience(we know so less information about our own CPU!), relativity and string theory, fatal diseases and etc.\n\nComputer science and engineering can contribute so much to these subjects, doesn't it?

        "text": "TL/DR : Do I really need a CS degree? If not, what should I study on my own? I'd like to move past programming just for web development.\n\nHello all, \n\nAs the title states, I've been questioning the necessity of a computer science degree. I came to reddit hoping to get some advice/feedback from those of you who probably know way more about this than I do.  Fair warning, a fair bit of 'life history' follows:\n\nI grew up going to public school, got as far as finishing an associates at a local tech school; afterwards, I wasted a few years at university.  I didn't find anything I looked into interesting. I bounced around a few different majors, but besides the usual pre-reqs (math, science, english, history), most of my credits were towards a criminal justice degree. I finally ended up dropping out. I thought college must've not been for me. I'd been deceiving myself that perhaps I'd want to attend law school upon graduating...in hindsight, besides that I could've never actually afforded it, I know I could never have lived with myself as a lawyer either; I was just living to try to make my parents happy at the time.  \n\nFast forward a few years of wandering through life and waiting tables, and now...I've been working in web dev for two years now; web dev is fun and interesting, and it gives me plenty of things to learn...but...I always feel like I know, I want something else. Two years ago, I attended and finished a coding boot camp for front-end web dev, the primary focus was learning JS.  I enjoyed it, and I enjoy my job currently as a front-end dev, but again, I just feel like I want more of something else.  I find a lot of enjoyment in learning about programming concepts like OO, functional, and procedural programming.  I don't really find the whole \"creating a beautiful website/app\" part of web development fun; basically, I think HTML and CSS are boring as hell.\n\nI have a good time when I'm writing Javascript.  I enjoy trying to solve problems  with JS.  Yes, JS was my introduction to programming, I've dabbled a bit with C# and Python as well, but mostly JS.\n\nSince I've started working in tech, I've really come to realize how much you can just learn online.  Looking back on my decision to attend a boot-camp,  I won't say it was a waste of time, but knowing what I do now, it certainly wasn't necessary.  I just grew up thinking \"school\" was where you go to learn stuff.  Basically I grew up with the whole \"go to college or you'll fail at life\" mindset drilled into me, and I've found it less and less applicable the older I get. I wish I would've just learned a trade earlier, but anyways!\n\nSo, more and more I find myself drawn into computer science.  I like it, I like solving problems with code, I like learning about different data structures, coding languages and their specific uses, I like pretending I'm understanding YouTube videos on algorithms, and how we can interact with computers through software (and not just the web).  I like learning about computer hardware too, grant it, not as much as software, but still!  I find artificial intelligence fascinating.  I feel like I grew up with computers  (I'm 28), but I've just been a passive user my whole life.  I remember people writing scripts to change their Myspace, and I  didn't know what the hell they were doing, I just copied and pasted stuff, and now I'm like OOOOOOoooOOOOh!\n\nI'm saving up right now to buy all my parts, so I can build my first PC.  I'm learning about Linux, I've downloaded it on my old laptop and I'm having fun with that.  Up until a few years ago, I was clueless about open source.  I missed the bus man! But I am sprinting after that thing!\n\nSo...now that we're caught up, sorry if the back history was a little much, but I felt it was necessary to understand my current state of viewing things.\n\nLike my title states, those of you who have been doing this for a while, do I/should I go back to university for computer science? Is it really necessary?...I fear I'll have a similar experience as with my bootcamp, and learn later that it was unnecessary, if I had only known where to look, and really trusted that there are actually good resources for learning things online.  Where do I really want to go with this stuff? Can I get beyond making web pages and apps with JS? If so, can I do it without going to college and having to spend bookoo moneys only to finish with more debt than a house? Can I move past just the web industry without going to college? If so, what should I study? Is there a recommended path?  What the heck did you guys really learn in college anyways? Do you really feel it was neccessary for what you do now? Cuz &amp;#37;95 of what I learned in school growing up, serves me zip, zero, zilch as an adult.  I will totally study and bust my ass on my own! The problem is, there is LOADS of info on the web for EVERYTHING...and it's like....I don't actually know, what it is that I don't know!  Or what it is that I need to know...colleges and universities have \"degree paths\".  But seriously, can I do it without college?  It's not that I don't want to go back to college...I'd just prefer not to, if I really don't have to!  And if I really don't have to, I'd appreciate some advice from random internet strangers on where to from here...it's served me well in the past.\n\n  \nThanks :)",

Therefore, my best option would be distance learning at the OU.\n\nThere course is as follows: http://www.open.ac.uk/courses/qualifications/q62\n\nNow, this isn't listed as a Computer Science degree, but an IT and Computing degree, with options of a CompSci or Software Development focus (within the Broad route, there are other routes to choose from, and I am tempted by the Software route).\n\nCan anyone vouch for the quality of this degree? I want to turn my career around and would love to work as a software developer (or in another IT role, but this would be my preference.)\n\nAs an aside from the degree, I am teaching myself Python and a mix of web development technologies.\n\nI would really appreciate any advice on this, including whether you think this is worthwhile, and if you think there's a route or focus listed on there that would likely be the best.",

The definitions tend to be vague and to avoid getting into the territory where they appear to overlap, which seems to often be the case in practice.\n\nFrom what I understand:\n\n• A virus is code that replicates by infecting i.e. injecting itself into host files (data, executables, boot sectors, etc)\n\n• A worm is a standalone software that self-replicates by sending copies of itself over networks (mail, shared folders, open ports, etc)\n\n• A trojan is a standalone software that uses social engineering to masquerade as a legitimate application in order to operate covertly in the background\n\nBut don't most malwares incorporate behaviors from all three types? I mean, take the infamous ILOVEYOU worm from 2000 for instance. It is embedded into a VBS file the user needs to run for ILOVEYOU to start spreading and which then proceeds to inject its code into JPGs and MP3s. Doesn't that mean it also qualifies as a virus? Moreover, it uses social engineering to make people believe it's an actual love letter from a trusted contact. Doesn't that mean it also qualifies as a trojan?",

I would like to read some computer science undergraduate material to make sure I'm not missing any obvious basics, so there is my question. Which courses/topics are impossible for someone who studied CS to not know? In physics there are things I learnt years ago, but would be able to describe straight away without any prior revision, because they are so basic it's impossible not to know them. I'm thinking of something like deriving and solving equations of motion, handling units, basic quantum mechanics and special relativity etc. So what are the corresponding things in computer science? I've heard data structures and algorithms are considered important, but maybe someone can give a bit more insight into that? If you know of some neat online resources, that would be superb. I don't think I have the time to cover a whole full-fledged CS course, but I am willing to spend a couple of weeks for the revision. I know some programming - I have coded in Java/C++ before, these days I mostly use Python for everyday tasks.\n\nThanks a lot!",

I just updated my MacBook Pro to the newest OS, but when I clicked restart to begin the update I got this heinous cartoon face that filled my screen with text below that read \"as long as humans are the ones using it.\" After maybe half a minute it went away and returned to my desktop where the OS update was still waiting for me to install/restart. I then started and completed the update with no issues, and my Sophos antivirus says that nothing is wrong. So far all seems fine. Is my MacBook okay?",

I'm having a hard time figuring out why this is the case for unweighted since if you just use a queue, you are going level by level (and distance), and always doing the smaller levels before the larger ones by definition of the queue. \n\nCould anyone shed some light on this?",

        "text": "I love taking a look at problems that have a definite solution, and figuring them out.  I also love the creative ability that programming lends you, there's no limit to the things you can create once you're capable in a some languages.  The thing is I have very limited experience actually programming myself.\n\nI remember I took a course in high school about a topic I had limited knowledge on, but was extremely interested in.  I ended up completely shutting down and not giving a crap about the class because about half of the students were well-versed in the topic, and the discussions that were had were not those that even remotely catered to beginners.\n\nI'm a bit worried about this with CS.  I know for a fact there will be students who are knowledgeable, and got a head start on things, which is fine, but I'm worried about how the professors will handle them, and the people newer to the subject.  I don't want to be cheated out of having the experience of learning programming in natural, linear progression.\n\nFor this reason, I feel like I'd be better off just teaching myself through online resources.  I've always been a much more efficient learner when I learn things with good resources, and piece things together through the context of my own experiences.  The thing is, I got a scholarship to go to school, and I think it'd be really stupid to throw that away.\n\nI want to ask if my apprehensiveness is justified, but at the same time I realize that CS programs are going to vastly differ from school to school depending on who's teaching them, and running the show.  But if you can, maybe share your experiences so that I can get an idea of how common the type of thing I'm afraid of is, and maybe ways to deal with it.  I want to know that it's worth the trouble if these things are the case.",

Here goes.\n\nSo the game in question is Guild Wars 2. A recurring question on the forums is about the AoE cap. When you do damage, as far as I know the person closest to the center of the AoE gets hit first and so on. Not sure if this point is relevant or not but its worth mentioning. So when you do damage, the factors included are the damagers power, precision, critical damage, weapon strength, and damage increase modifiers. The damage takers factors are armor and damage reduction modifiers.\n\n1. If the AoE cap is lowered (so from 5 people to 20) on a few larger cool down skills, but increased (namely auto attacks which have no cool down, from 5 or 3 to 1 person) on a few lower cool down skills, would this balance out in terms of latency / fps?\n2. If not, how is it possible to lower the AoE cap in a game with many complex animations while still maintaining good server side and user side latency / fps?",
