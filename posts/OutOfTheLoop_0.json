My experience has been that there is a general disdain for award shows like this that were made by rich people for rich people, and seemingly rife with bias. \n\nOver the past week I've seen constant posts reach the top of /r/all commenting on Brendan Frasier ([such as this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/11tgzva/brendan_fraser_and_sonsor_secret_king_of_a/)) of all actors and to a lesser extent Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan. Just non stop picture posts with thousands to tens of thousands of upvotes talking about the most benign stuff like how Brendan's kids look.\n\nIs this astroturfing? Are there bots mass upvoting and commenting on these posts to promote the Oscars? Or am I out of the loop and missing something else?",

But what is the requirements for these small banks to access these funds? It seems like they can just get it to pay their interest and resolve their problems, are they hard to access or have to publicly ask or is this all private?  \n\n\n  \nI read that the top 5 banks won't be using the $2 trillion fund because according to JP morg, they have enough $2-4 trillion for themselves and assuming the other top 4 have $1-2 trillion, that means these small/mid banks is the same as if 1 of the top banks failing. Would this cause a deeper inflation rise? If JPOW lowers the inflation rate, it feels like he will do it for the banks to ease pressure but wouldn't the right thing to do is raise inflation because of this $2 trillion injection?",

I can only find two examples at the moment ([link 1](https://youtu.be/KSXKzPOcYDU?t=4087) and [link 2](https://twitter.com/DennisMillerNFL/status/1589347831441395714?cxt=HHwWhMDQ2dLbv44sAAAA)), but I’m certain I’ve seen people do it in other contexts as well. From context, I feel it’s probably pretty fair to assume that it’s something he said after many of his jokes, but that just punts my question a bit further down the road. If that assumption is correct, why did Miller say “cha-chi” in the first place? Was it just a sort of catchphrase (and if so, why?)? Was he talking to someone whose nickname was “Cha-chi” (and if so, who?)? Is it something else entirely (and if so, what?)? I know this is an extremely old loop out of which to be, but I’m still curious. I’m not nearly old enough to have seen ‘80s SNL, but I still see people talking about Miller sometimes because he continues to commentate on Fox and similar sources, so I assume it’s current enough to count for a submission here.",
