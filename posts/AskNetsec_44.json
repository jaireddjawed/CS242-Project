Well, if that happenes, I don't want the person who got paid to get prosecuted, but also my friend cause I know he would be considered an accessory to the crime. But how would I prove this. He told me this verbally so I don't even have a statement he made digitally. Also, the guy he would hire isn't someone off of the dark net or anything, it's just a friend he knows at his university. Any way, how I can prove he helped ddos me in the event it happens? Thanks\n\nEdit: Now that I thought about it more, our other friend was there and heard my friend say this to me. Would him bearing witness and coming forth about it be enough to prosecute?",

        "text": "I recently got scammed. Lost a lot of money. I want to know how this happened. I hope you can help me with it.\n\nI have most of communication with my lawyer via email. A week ago (Thursday) I received an email from their firm providing details of their bank account I was supposed to wire money to. I was expecting to get this email. Next day I got another email from the same account saying that I need to use their subsidiary bank account as the main one is undergoing end of the year audit. I didn't confirm this was genuine over the phone and I wired the money there (Friday, 1 Dec). Then I sent an email notifying I did the transfer. Only learned about it yesterday when the lawyer texted me they couldn't locate my transfer. I suggested they should check the subsidiary account and learned shortly that they didn't have any...\nI reported it to the cops but I don't have much hope. A week passed between the transfer and me reporting to my bank and the police.\n\nNow the technical details I was able to collect:\nmy account:\n- gmail with 2-step verification\n- had a forgotten imap password set up (deleted that straight away after discovery)\n- checked the list of devices that had access to my account: there are 2 'Mac' entries with one marked as 'Current device'. The second had access on 4 Dec (the earliest the money could get cleared) and used Safari at '4 December, 22:47'\n\nMy lawyer's firm is using Google's G Suite as far as I can tell.\nBoth the original emails have exactly the same From: lawyer@companyname.tld, the Signed by: companyname-tld.20150623.gappssmtp.com\n\nAnother thing is that my lawyer said they didn't receive any email from me for a week. She sent a test one that I replied to and she didn't receive the reply. She said emails from other people were coming this moring.\n\nLike I said, I don't expect to retrieve this money. Even if it was sloppiness on the lawyers' firm part it may not make sense to sue: what is a lot of money for me might be not worth it to a lawyer.\n\nI'd only would like to know how it could potentially happen. Where the breach was, etc.\nI'm happy to provide more details if they're needed.\n\nThank you.",

        "text": "I had $20-30 worth of bitcoin back in 2013 when mining first exploded, where the price was about $1000 per Bitcoin. So, given the recent explosion in Bitcoin price it got me thinking about trying to find my old Bitcoin wallet and see if it has anything left in it. I found my old hard drive and plugged it into my computer to copy the files over. While I had labeled the drive \"ALMOST DEAD\" and it regularly made clicking sounds while plugged in, I managed to copy over my Documents folder from it. On there I found my Bitcoin folder, with a 16GB copy of the blockchain (oh, how times have changed...) and a \"wallet.dat\" file. Awesome! Trying to import it into BitPay brought me to a new issue; I don't remember the password! I tried all of the possibilities that came to my head, and none of them seemed to work.\n\nI poked around a little folder in my old files and found an encrypted TrueCrypt volume. At the time I did like to save my important passwords that I couldn't change in text files, and store those in a TC volume. So there's a reasonable chance that volume contains my wallet decryption password.\n\nSo here's my question; would it be futile to set my computer loose on that volume and try to brute force the password? My knowledge of security at the time wasn't great so I think it's reasonably likely that the volume was encrypted with an 8 character password, *maybe* a 10 character password, that was just alphanumeric. I know that for cracking an MD5 hash that would be a hilariously easy crack, but for a proper hashing strategy, like bcrypt with a cost of 12, that becomes a serious issue very quickly, because calculating one hash takes a long time. I don't know whether there is a \"hash\" function to calculate for trying a password on a TC volume. The volume is 100MB; how long would it take to try one password on that? My computer has a GTX 1070 and i7-6700k with 16GB of RAM; does that help me here? If I can, what tool would I use to automatically try all of the combinations, or is there a simple script I should write?\n\nAlso, would it be better to try to crack the password to the Bitcoin wallet directly? I'm assuming not.\n\nTL;DR: Cracking a 100MB TrueCrypt volume, with a GTX 1070, i7-6700k, and 16GB of RAM, most likely a 8-10 character alphanumeric password. Can I do this? If so, what tool/scripts should I use to implement it?\n\nThanks!",

Ordering the rebuild of a machine which has detected such an infection feels a little heavy handed. There have been recent posts detailing how new samples are gaining persistence (https://betanews.com/2017/12/01/drive-by-cryptomining/) but again, this wouldn't survive a reboot.\n\nI'd be interested to know how others are handling these detection's.

Not really a netsec question, but the netsec users may have experience with this:)\n\nI have two network cards (AWUSO36NH and AWUSO36H) \nconnected to a raspberry pi 3.\n\nWhen I use Wash and view what is in my area, I am seeing that the AWUSO36NH reports signal levels much lower than the 36H. For example, when I point the NIC's antenna towards my own router, I get -50dBm on the 36H vs -76dBm on the 36NH.\nAnother observation: when I set the tx-power to 30dBm and even 33dBm, I don't really see a difference in my observations (36H signals are higher).\n\nIs this expected ...as far as when using Wash? Does this make sense? Is there another application / test that I can do to demonstrate that the sensitivity of the 36NH is better than 36H?\n\nDo I have a faulty 36HN card? Thanks!\n",

Thanks!\n\nEdit: My other reasoning behind this is that it would go a step further than reddit or Twitter. It would expect people to have kept up with news from those sources and further elaborate and discuss them in an instant messaging environment. It would also offer the chance to filter out the sometimes unnecessary content that comes along with other sources. It would be strictly cybersecurity material for the main part of the group.",

From what I understand, cache poisoning happens when the CDN caches responses and serves those responses. In this case, none of the responses will get cached, right? So cache poisoning wouldn't be an issue.",

I have about 20 years in IT and destroyed the CISSP in 2 hours without much trouble.\n\nPentesting is a different beast, however. I ran through Bulldog and Rickdiculous from Vulnhub and did okay, but got tripped up because I simply don't know so many of the tools that Kali offers. I was able to get about half the flags on Rickdiculous and able to get about half way through Bulldog (got a remote shell) - which I'm assuming is pretty terrible since they are beginner VMs.\n\nI've gotten approval to take the official OSCP course, but I want to go into it with a solid foundation so I'm not wasting time and can get the most value. Is it okay that I got stuck and had to look for walk-throughs, or should I go through the Cybrary and CBT Nuggets Kali courses, then tackle the Vulnhub VMs?",
