Each time I have done so to discuss with you some matter that I believe affected the ~~national~~ subreddt's interest. In all the decisions I have made in my ~~public~~ mod life I have always tried to do what was best for the ~~nation~~ sub. \n\n~~Soldiers~~ users of ~~my Old Guard~~ /r/BadHistory: I bid you farewell. \n\nThe period for a new ~~election~~ dictatorial appointment of a ~~citizen~~ user to administer the ~~executive government~~ modteam of the ~~United States~~ /r/BadHistory subreddit being not far distant, ~~and the time actually arrived when your thoughts must be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with that important trust~~ [lol like you get a say in this!], it appears to me proper, especially as it may conduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I should now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline being considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to be made.\n\nI beg you, at the same time, to do me the justice to be assured that this resolution has not been taken without a strict regard to all the considerations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful ~~citizen~~ mod to his ~~country~~ subreddit; and that in withdrawing the tender of service, which silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no diminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful respect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction that the step is compatible with both.\n\nEvery day the increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more, that the shade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied, that, if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my services, they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe, that, while choice and prudence invite me to quit the ~~political~~ badhistory scene, patriotism does not forbid it.\n\nI address you with neither rancor nor bitterness in the fading twilight of ~~life~~ modship, with but one purpose in mind: to serve my ~~country~~ subreddit. The issues are global and so interlocked that to consider the problems of one sector, oblivious to those of another, is but to court disaster for the whole. While ~~Asia~~ shitposting is commonly referred to as the Gateway to ~~Europe~~ misplaced pedantry, it is no less true that ~~Europe~~ misplaced pedantry is the Gateway to ~~Asia~~ shitposting, and the broad influence of the one cannot fail to have its impact upon the other.\n\nThe potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced ~~power~~ shitposting exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable ~~citizenry~~ userbase can compel the proper meshing of the huge ~~industrial and military~~ lighthearted and informative machinery of ~~defense~~ badhistory with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.\n\nLet me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of ~~party~~ shitposting, generally. The alternate domination of ~~one faction~~ shitposter over ~~another~~ pedant, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to ~~party~~ user dissension, which in different ages and ~~countries~~ subreddits has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism.\n\nPromote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a ~~government~~ subreddit gives force to public opinion, it is essential that public opinion should be enlightened. Harmony, liberal intercourse with all ~~nations~~ users, are recommended by policy, humanity, and interest.\n\nI am closing my ~~5~~2 years of ~~military~~ moderator service. When I joined the ~~Army~~ modteam, even before the ~~turn of the century~~ R5 era, it was the fulfillment of all of my boyish hopes and dreams. The world has turned over many times since I took the oath ~~on the plain at West Point~~ in my inbox from /u/reddit, and the hopes and dreams have long since vanished, but I still remember the refrain of one of the most popular barrack ballads of that day which proclaimed most proudly that \"old ~~soldiers~~ moderators never die; they just fade away.\"\n\nToday I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of this earth. I have been in ~~ballparks~~ the subreddit for ~~17~~ 2+ years and have never received anything but kindness and encouragement from you ~~fans~~.\n\nAnd like the old ~~soldier~~ moderator of that ballad, I now close my ~~military~~ BH moderator career and just fade away, an old ~~soldier~~ moderator who tried to do his duty as ~~God~~ volcano gave him the light to see that duty. I intend to write the history of the great achievements we have performed together. Adieu, my friends. Would I could press you all to my heart.",

        "text": "I went to the Alamo today because I figured I couldn't be in Texas and not visit the \"Shrine to Texas Liberty.\" It was interesting, I enjoyed it, and I found the cult-ish atmosphere around the artefacts and names to be fascinating. This post, though, is about one name in particular. While I don't have a picture because the Alamo forbids taking pictures inside, at the back of the main building is a list of all known deaths at the Alamo. It includes famous names like James Bowie, Davie Crockett, and all those, but also one that just says \"___________, John: A black freed man.\" It's not wrong to say that a black man named John died at the Alamo. He was not, however, free, and saying so is a rather fascinating instance of whitewashing the history of the battle. \n\nThere's not much we know about John. We know he appears on the rosters of the dead, and that he was likely one of two black men at the Alamo. The other - Joe - was definitely a slave, belonging to W.B. Travis. When the Mexicans attacked the fort, Joe fought alongside Travis, but after his master fell, Joe hid, emerging only when it became clear he wouldn't be harmed. He helped identify the bodies of Travis, Bowie, and Crockett, then was imprisoned for a bit before escaping. \n\nOur focus, though, is John, the other black man that we know for certain was there. John appears on numerous rosters, implying that he probably was a real person, even if we don't know much else about him. However, according to the [Texas State Historical Association](https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fjobe), he probably worked as a clerk in Francis L. Desaque's store at the Alamo. Desaque arrived at the Alamo before the siege, but was sent out for supplies during the siege itself, leaving John to man the store. I don't know if John took up arms and fought to defend the Alamo - there's really not much known about John at all. However, every record that does exist implies heavily that he was a slave, not a freedman. The freedmen that did interact with the Alamo are well-recorded (relatively speaking), unlike John.\n\nIt seems likely, then, that the Alamo's shrine is wrong in its description of John. The interesting question then becomes why it makes this mistake. Why list John as a free man when it's not definitively known, and certainly probably untrue? The Alamo is hailed as a shrine of Texas liberty, and it's clear throughout the museum that that is what you're meant to take out of it. Can a shrine to liberty necessarily include overt references to slavery? Can it say that some of its \"martyrs\" weren't there voluntarily, thus raising the question of how much liberty was actually be defended?\n\nTo answer this, let's look at some of the reasons Texas was seceding from Mexico and the motivation behind the war. After the Mexican Constitution of 1824, Texas was flooded with immigrants from across the United States and the world (including Germany, which is actually really fascinating), many of which weren't necessarily interested in being part of Mexico so much as the promise of land and wealth. Indeed, despite the Mexican government requiring new immigrants to take a vow of loyalty and convert to Catholicism, many settlers didn't, and didn't much care for Catholics. Many of these immigrants brought slaves with them, and in 1829 when Mexico abolished slavery, these slaveholders nearly rebelled. After Mexico banned further immigration in 1830, the now majority English-speaking Texians saw themselves as persecuted and without representation by a government they didn't like. It's a familiar narrative. In 1832, when Santa Anna overthrew the previous government, leaders such as Stephen Austin saw a chance in reconciliation with the Mexican government, but in actuality, that didn't exist. In 1835, war erupted. \n\nBut let's pause for a moment. The causes of the war are fairly straightforward - taxation without representation, difference of culture, and the abolition of slavery. There were a lot of reasons the Texians weren't happy, and slavery can't be ignored as one of them. To say that the Texas Revolution was fought for liberty is true to a point. It was fought so slaveholders and free Texians could have rights independent of the Mexican government's wishes, with one of those rights being the right to keep and own slaves. A war for utter liberty, this was not.\n\nSo let's look at the Shrine to Texas Liberty and the mythos around it. The Alamo is viewed as a grand moment in Texas and US history, where, despite losing, martyrs to the cause of liberty were made. Once again, though, does it tarnish their reputation and possibly the reputation of the entire battle to know that one of those killed didn't really have a choice in the matter? Or, that he did have a choice on whether or not to fight, but not on whether or not to be there at all? How does slavery interact with the image of the Alamo being a battle for liberty?\n\nPersonally, I suspect the shrine is brushing over the truth that a slave died there, and doing so by labeling John as a free man. We don't usually think of the Texas Revolution as being about slavery, but it partially was, much to the awkwardness of the cries of liberty. To be clear, I'm not meaning to dismiss the Alamo as a battle or its importance. Rather, I just want to point out that John was not, as the Alamo claims, a free man. He was most likely a slave.\n\nSources!\n\nThe [TSHA](https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fjobe), as I mentioned earlier.\n\n[This lovely article](http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/adp/history/1836/blacks/durham.html)\n\nInterestingly, the Alamo's guidebook, which the uninterested curator will let you flip through if you ask enough questions that he doesn't know the answer to. It states pretty clearly that all research shows that John was almost certainly a slave.",

        "text": "(my first submission to r\\/badhistory, hope everything is okay, etc)\n\nI'm visiting with my relatives right now and we somehow ended up sharing the dumbest \"facts\" we've seen on the internet. My aunt remembered an email going around claiming earthworms didn't exist in the western hemisphere before 1492, and that their introduction from European ships caused a massive ecological shift. Even ignoring that worms are millions of years old... what. \n\nAfter doing a bit of research I can guess where the idea came from. Some background: earthworms are indeed native to North America, but the most recent glacial period effectively removed worms from Canada and the Great Lakes region. Worms don't exactly migrate - one source reported \"earthworm populations spread at a rate of about 5 meters (5.5 yards) a year\" - so that region was never resettled by earthworms, and the forest ecology evolved around a relatively slow rate of decomposition\n\nFast forward a few thousand years, and European and Asian earthworms are taking over Canada (and most of North America; most worms you find in the dirt are non-native). This has a huge impact on forest soil (and plants, and things that eat plants, etc), and invasive worm species are still a problem today. \n\nThat leads me to [this page on allaboutworms.com](http://www.allaboutworms.com/are-earthworms-indigenous-to-the-americas). (There really is a web site for everything.) It's mostly correct, except that the glacial period didn't kill all of the worms everywhere:\n\n&gt; Since earthworms weren’t part of the Americas’ ecosystem prior to the arrival of the Europeans, large amounts of leaf litter, which earthworms consume, accumulated. So, when earthworms arrived, they essentially had a backlog of food waiting to be consumed. And consume they did, which had wide-ranging implications for the Americas’ ecosystem. [...]\n\n&gt; Thus, earthworms came from Europe and literally altered the landscape. Interestingly, though, earthworms were probably in the Americas long before the arrival of Europeans. However, they likely died off during the glacial age, when glaciers covered much of the land. Earthworms cannot survive in these conditions, and so it took the arrival of Europeans to reintroduce earthworms to the Americas, and by the time this happened, the ecosystem had evolved in such a way that lots of plants thrived off leaf litter.\n\n&gt; So, once more, earthworms are indigenous to the Americas – they can rightly call this vast land their native home – but they have not been here continuously. The glaciers took them away and the Europeans, for good or ill, brought them back. \n\nThey even say \"the Americas\" instead of Northern North America... I think it's been quite a while since there were any glaciers in Mesoamerica. \n\nWhere did the writer go wrong? The only source mentioned is Mann's *1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created*, which says:\n\n&gt; What is clear is that before the arrival of Europeans, New England and the upper Midwest had no earthworms--they were wiped out in the last Ice Age. Earthworms from the south didn't move north after the glaciers melted because the creatures don't travel long distances.\n\nSo somehow this ended up as worms being wiped off the face of (half of) the earth, and waaaaaay downstream we have Native Americans wondering why the white people have tiny snakes. \n\nSources:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_earthworms_of_North_America\n\nUniversity of Minnesota, Forest Ecology and Worms (http://www.nrri.umn.edu/WORMS/forest/index.html)\n\nNPR: The Trouble with Earthworms (http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9105956)",

But I think [this should suffice...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18th_century)\n\n&gt; Their objective was to create a nation ruled by businessmen. Through propaganda, threats, bribes, murder, and the tightly controlled printing of books, they convinced people in the year 1700 that it was actually the year 1800, that thirteen colonies of the British Empire, controlled primarily by wealthy bankers and landowners, had somehow won a war against the most terrifying military power on the globe and established a country where there were no kings, no popes, no caliphates, and no historical culture except the one they invented in the so-called history books they printed and delivered to schoolhouses across the globe.\n\nOkay uhm where do I even start. Like I can't even begin to understand where to begin with this. I think my favorite part is his claim that the US started printing history books and 'schoolhouses around the globe' started reading it. I also like the amazing Eurocentricism -- that somehow the Chinese were mystically under control by American bankers and thus had no perception of time. \n\n&gt; They knew that in only a few short years, there would be cameras and newspapers and telegraphs and phones and smaller, more affordable printing presses.\n\nYeah the year is 1700 and in only a 'few short years' there would be cameras! And phones! \n\n&gt; They knew the colonial system was on the verge of collapse, so they would be unable to force the native populations of the globe to modify their calendars. The enslavement of Africans couldn’t last much longer, so it was their last chance to dictate unto the helpless and the uneducated what year it really was!\n\nThat's why the subjugation of Africa only took place in the later 1800's, oh shit I mean 1700's, right?\n\nI won't even deal with the rest of his post as it's just conspiratorial rambling and not really history, but I will deal with his comments. As they're even better.\n\n&gt; In 1699, society was organized around religions and local governments, and local governments got their information from the monarchy. If the King said it was Tuesday when everyone knew it was Saturday, that meant it was Tuesday and you had to shut the hell up or get burned alive in a dungeon.  So if the King (forced by the bankers) says it's the year 1800, and the bankers agree, and the lawyers go by what the bankers say, and everyone who disagrees dies of \"typhoid fever\", and all the kids are educated from new textbooks about all the amazing things that happened in the 1700's, then boom! It's now the year 1800 and after two generations no one can even remember that it was a global royalist/banker conspiracy\n\n1. Absolute monarchy, lol\n\n2. Dude what. Where is he getting his history from? The Boltons in Game of Thrones?\n\nBy the way, I like the idea [that somehow Kings were immune to revolution in the 1600's.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glorious_Revolution)\n\n&gt; I just can't, in good conscious, take it on faith that the 18th century happened. I don't believe the old European power structures simply melted away, I don't believe King Louis XIV ruled France for 72 years in an age when the average life expectancy was like 35 years. I don't believe the French Revolution just magically happened after this supposed \"Sun King\" finally died.\n\nUhm...\n\n1. He does realize Louis XIV ruled in the 1600's right? Like he started ruling in 1654? He was born in 1638 for Pete's Sake -- even if we pretend the 18th century didn't exist he still lived *62 friggin years* under this guys' timeline.\n\n2. The average life expectancy wasn't 35 years. That was the average life span. When half your kids are guaranteed to die before they reach puberty that kind of skews averages. If you got past adolescence you could expect a long, happy life however.\n\n3. The French Revolution didn't happen after Louis XIV, aka the 'Sun King', died. It didn't even happen under his successor, Louis XV. It happened under Louix XVI.\n\n&gt;&gt; But how would that account for the annual rebuilding of the Ise Shrines every twenty years? A hundred years of tax records, shipping receipts, chinese astrology(and astronomy) etc. \n\n&gt;&gt; I mean Japan has hundreds(if not more than a thousand) small and mid sized businesses that existed through the 18th century. Who convinced a bunch of hotel and restaurant owners to falsify a hundred years of business records?\n\n&gt; Have you seen all of the business records of medium to small Chinese merchants from the supposed 18th century? Or have you just been TOLD that those records exist? If you find 5 examples of business records from this time period, ask yourself how difficult it would be to fabricate 5 pieces of paper.\n\n&gt; The bottom line is, there is no definitive proof that the 18th century ever happened. It's clearly a small collection of circumstantial evidence bolstered by an outrageous and concerted top-down campaign of misinformation.\n\n&gt; Ask yourself what you really know about 18th century history in China, and what book it came from, and who published that book. Dollars to donuts it was published by a big company owned by a bigger company run by a shadowy board of directors with direct financial lineage to the overlords of the false century.\n\nDirect documentation of this period is 'circumstantial evidence'? \n\n&gt;  I don't believe thirteen disorganized agriculture slave colonies defeated the best military on Earth.\n\nI don't believe that a bunch of illiterate farmers were able to force the largest militaries on Earth, both in the 1980's and 2000's, out of their country through sheer attrition and force of will. Oh wait, it freaking happened. Now imagine it's 200+ years ago and you don't have modern ships, aircraft carriers, and airplanes. Regardless, [Askhistorians R5](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/wrrl3/why_were_the_americans_able_to_win_the/)\n\nThey didn't 'defeat' the British alone. They attrited them and annoyed the piss out of them until the French came and, with their assistance, they proved to be too much of a nuisance to keep a reign on.\n\n&gt; The monarchies of Europe never would have given up their hold on power, but they were outwitted by the bankers. Europe was torn apart by war in the 1600's. The bankers and finance kings stirred 100's of internecine conflicts throughout that century, so that by 1699, the monarchies were barely held together by the loans from these same merchant princes.\n\nUhh...in 1699 the French monarchy had a pretty friggin strong hold on things. The British monarchy had already been subverted by both the English Civil War and the Glorious Revolution. I'm not sure where this is coming from. \n\n&gt; You honestly believe this squid-ink-spaghetti haired Elton John costumed ageless wonder stood astride the civilized world and used his tyrannical power as king to militarily support the birth of a supposed democracy?\n\nWell no, considering he ruled and died about 70 years prior to the American Revolution. It would be Louis XIV who would fund the revolution, two generations later. This guy *really* needs to pick up a book. Any book. Literally a single one.\n\n&gt; You can't prove any of those so-called \"facts\" are true. Go ahead, prove it. I dare you to prove it. I honestly can't take you seriously from an intellectual standpoint, since you literally have no evidence to back up your claims.\n\n&gt; There is literally twice as much evidence for the 17th century than there is for the 18th century, and I can PROVE it. Seriously. Show me any piece of evidence that the 18th century exists and I can show you TWO pieces of evidence that the 17th century exists. There is literally twice as much evidence that I am right.\n\nThe amount of source material has no bearing on the truthfulness of that material itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "[The offending post; notice the 3000+ upvotes.] (https://np.reddit.com/r/creepy/comments/10mkjw/shell_shocked_soldier_1916/c6exfpd?context=1) Some of you may look at the \"two years ago\" and say, \"but Dux, isn't this getting a little excessive?\", to which I would reply, [YOU'RE NOT MY SUPERVISOR!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEwlW5sHQ4Q) \n\nAs I said, this will be a double feature; exhibit A, \"The Shell-shocked soldier\", and exhibit B, \"Long post that got more upvotes than it probably should have, but what else is new.\" To start with exhibit A, this man is constantly described in photo threads across reddit as 'shell-shocked', largely because: A) He's in WWI; B) He's in a Trench; and C) Those 'creepy' eyes. This is an assumption made possible by the fact that the photo has been cropped, and does not provide the wider context. The original is [here.] (http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1xpb9ccsC1qaac0mo1_500.png)\n\nNotice that the soldier in question is in a dressing station, somewhere no doubt to the rear of the battles currently taking place around Flers and Courcelettes, in the third week of September, 1916, on the Somme. He is clearly smiling at the camera while being tended to by a medic, for what seems to be a wound to his limb. As to his eyes, [this /r/historyporn comment on the same photo (same error) by CrossyNZ answers that question.] (https://np.reddit.com/r/HistoryPorn/comments/2r7z5d/shell_shocked_soldier_at_the_battle_of/cndj4x5) Taking all of this into account, there is no compelling reason whatsoever to assume this man is suffering from 'shell-shock'; if I had to guess, this Tommy has probably 'copped a Blighty', and is in for either spending the rest of the war at home, or spending a few days or weeks behind the line. This is merely my inference, but it would seem he has good reason to smile!\n\nBut now for the main event, Exhibit B; what could possibly go wrong (besides everything)?:\n\n&gt; There's a lack of appreciation in this and other comments, I think, for why WWI was so traumatic for soldiers.\n\nSurely a well informed, well written account of life for soldiers in the different armies and fronts of this war will follow?\n\n&gt; There's an ebb and flow over military history between the offense and the defense having the upper hand. In the last major European war before WWI, the Franco-Prussian War, the offense had the edge; Germany won via its decisive and swift march onto Paris, disabling France before it could really even get in the fight. Decades later, however, by the time WWI began, technology had changed; advances in artillery, machine gun, railway systems, fortifications, etc., and even the adaptation of some low-tech stuff like barbed wire, made the defense much more powerful than the offensive technology that existed at the time.\n\n For proof of this 'ebb and flow between defense and offense', he will supply all of one example of this (apparent) discourse. Ignoring of course, that since at least Clausewitz' *On War*, if not before, it had been acknowledged by and large that a defender possessed, at least tactically, some advantages:\n\n&gt; The defender waits for the attack in position, having chosen a suitable area and prepared it; which means he has carefully reconnoitered it, erected solid defenses at some of the most important points, established and opened communications, sited his batteries, fortified some villages, selected covered areas, and so forth. The strength of his front, access to which is barred by one or more parallel trenches or other obstacles or by dominant strong points, makes it possible for him, while the forces at the points of actual contact are destroying each other, to inflict heavy losses on the enemy at low cost to himself as the attack passes through the successive stages of resistance until it reaches the heart of the position. The points of support on which his flanks rest secure him against sudden attacks from several directions. The covered ground on which the defender has taken up his position will make the attacker wary, even timid. It will enable the defender to slow down the general retrograde movement by means of small successful counterattacks as the area of action steadily narrows. In this way the defender can confidently survey the battle as it smolders before his eyes.\n\n\nIndeed, the 'golden ratio' even today was to have 3 attackers for every one defender; infiltrating the position, using superior firepower to drive the foe out, and more likely, out flanking the position. This **was confronted** in the Franco-Prussian War, with some Prussian companies at Gravelotte and St. Privat suffering 60% losses, but these battles **ended in German victory**. He speaks of a 'decisive march on Paris', ignoring the Siege of Metz, and the bloody campaign of Sedan, along with many other clashes before the Prussians and Co. even reached Paris; of course, then there was the Siege of Paris, and the war dragged on into 1871 due to the will of the Republic to resist, so where he gets this idea that the French 'hardly began to fight' is beyond me.\n\nHe of course plays the 'tactics of offense v weapons of defense' card, ignoring that it doesn't make sense. For one thing, artillery was the chief weapon of both defenders and attackers, as were machine guns, especially with the proliferation of Light Machine Guns around 1915. Railway systems enabled armies to mobilize quickly and move supplies over long distances, an advantage clearly demonstrated by the Prussians in the Franco-Prussian War. He also blatantly ignores the mobile fighting on the western front in 1914, and throughout the war on the Eastern Front, and also in the Balkans and Middle East.\n\nOn another note, apparently the Russo-Turkish War and the Balkan Wars didn't happen, or at least weren't 'major'.\n\n&gt; But the mindset that everyone was operating under was still based on that last major war. This was the rationale behind Germany's invasion of France through Belgium- it believed it had to move quickly to disable France, or it would lose a two-sided war against France and Russia. Likewise, the cult of the offensive dominated French thinking; there was a strikingly testosterone-driven belief that a fervent charge of bayonets was enough to overcome any machine gun fire. And let's not even get started on cavalry. This was the first war in history where cavalry was finally and completely rendered obsolete, and the generals did not adapt well, they were still sending cavalry out to be massacred by machine gun fire even by the time the war ended.\n\n[As Nicholas Murray describes in this excellent lecture] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cbq7iu8FrI), armies going to war in 1914 had sought an operational-level way around the tactical difficulties modern firepower posed; the Schlieffen Plan and Plan XVII aimed to hit where they knew their enemies concentration of forces would be weakest. Furthermore, as demonstrated by Jonathan M. House in *The Decisive Attack: A New Look at French Infantry Tactics on the Eve of World War I*, the French like every other European Army emphasized dispersion on the battlefield and the use of massed firepower to suppress the enemy and enable movement. Bayonet attacks were the end of a means, the achievement of 'fire superiority', not the means themselves. As to the 'obsolescence' of cavalry, I have made my views and those of others clear [here.] (https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3k0oza/wwi_centenary_nyt_op_ed_from_one_year_back/cutuh5p)\n\n**To Be Continued**\n\nEDIT: P.S., thank you to whoever gave me Gold!",

        "text": "As we continue to assess the truthfulness of songs by The Highwaymen (Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson, and Johnny Cash), it's time to analyze a song that dealt with an actual historical event.\n\nOn January 28, 1948, a plane chartered by the INS crashed near Los Gatos Canyon in California, killing all 32 people on board.  Four of them (the pilot, co-pilot, stewardess, and guard) were American; 28 were migrant farm workers heading back to Mexico at the end of their *bracero* contract.  Woody Guthrie, living off the land and trainhopping in the heart of New York City, lamented the fact that his copy of the New York Times only referred to the 28 as \"deportees\".  Furious over what he apparently felt was racist treatment by the media, he wrote a poem.  10 years later, Martin Hoffman would set it to music to create the folk song \"Deportee (Plane Crash at Los Gatos)\".  Guthrie's original version, as well as later ones by others like Joan Baez, is angry and pointed.\n\nBut first, a word on the *braceros*.  To make a very long story short, there was a massive wave of deportations that took place in the western American states during the 1930s.  In the aftermath of the Mexican Revolution and the devastating economic fallout, hundreds of thousands of Mexicans made their way into the United States in search of a better life in the 1920s.  As it would happen, the Great Depression was just around the corner, and with a labor crisis looming, Herbert Hoover would blame (among others) Mexican immigrants with undermining the American economy.  This gave rise to demand for the deportations that would come to be known as the Mexican Repatriation.  How many people were sent to Mexico is unknown; estimates range from 500,000 to over two million, including unknown numbers of American citizens who happened to be of Mexican descent.\n\nBut then World War II came along, and the United States was suddenly hit with a labor shortage.  And specifically, a labor shortage in agriculture.  Conscription took farm workers, and for those left behind, why endure backbreaking farm labor in the California summer for pennies when you could endure backbreaking munitions or shipbuilding work for dollars?  Faced with this shortage, an agreement was reached between Mexico and the United States in 1942 that would help both countries.  Mexico would be relieved from needing to provide material support in the American war effort by sending farm workers, and the United States would receive desperately-needed farm workers so no one starved.  The agreement was for five years, but would be revisited and retooled over the coming years and last into the 1960s.\n\nThe program would also lend legitimacy to what had traditionally been a bit underhanded.  After all, hiring illegal immigrants was a great way to get a ton of cheap labor that had no leverage and no recourse.  A potential *bracero*, on the other hand, had to go through a lengthy process just to be considered.  Documents were required, in addition to references from reputable individuals.  Those who could do so would be passed on to a regional station, where a physical and medical exam would be conducted and vaccinations administered if they had not been previously received.  Those who passed would be given a card called a *mica*, which showed that the Mexican government had approved the candidate.  The candidate would then move on to a reception center in the United States, where a more thorough medical and physical exam was conducted, including checking for tuberculosis, venereal disease, chronic illness...and then fumigation with DDT would take place.  (Ah, for the simple days of yesteryear, when extremely powerful chemicals were the answer to everything.)  Those who passed this would then interview directly with contractors; those approved would sign their contract, receive a second *mica* showing American government approval and be taken to the farm as an official *bracero*.  Contracts were for the single year, and upon completion, *braceros* would return to Mexico.\n\nOnce in the United States, many discovered that at the end of the day, despite the official status and the blessings of two governments, not much was different.  The wages may have been higher, but the conditions were still substandard and accusations of mistreatment were common.  So, too, were strikes.  Ernesto Galarza wrote a scathing book in 1956 titled *Strangers In Our Fields*, attacking the entire program as little more than slavery.\n\nThe plane that crashed on January 28, 1948 was flying *braceros* back to Mexico.  The flight plan was simple: fly from Oakland to Burbank, fuel up, and then fly from Burbank to El Centro.  The DC-3 never made it.  There's no delicate way to describe the crash; we'll just say it was horrific, that everyone on board died, and leave it at that.  Local and regional papers covered the tragedy extensively, including a list of the names of everyone on board; Woody Guthrie was way the hell over in New York City and either didn't know or didn't care, so he wrote a poem blasting the perceived callousness or indifference to the tragic event.\n\nFast forward 37 years.  As The Highwaymen were filling the songlist for their initial album, \"Deportee (Plane Crash at Los Gatos)\" was suggested.  And instead of having all four members sing, this one was just Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash, joined by Johnny Rodriguez.  Rodriguez was a young man of just 33 at the time, but had been producing hits since his first album went to #1 on the country charts at age 21.  The preceding years hadn't been as kind to him; he had two hits off 1983's album *For Every Rose*, but the album itself topped out at #30.  To describe his success since 1980 as \"modest\" may be generous; he'd gone from having eighteen top-10 hits from 1973 to 1979 down to just two since.\n\nThe Highwaymen's version was less angry than Guthrie's; many lyrics were the same, but [the last verse](https://www.woodyguthrie.org/Lyrics/Plane_Wreck_At_Los_Gatos.htm) was omitted entirely.  There's also a verse in the middle in which Guthrie speaks with the voice of the *bracero*; this is broken up and used in place of another one of Guthrie's pointed criticisms in The Highwaymen version, in addition to being used in the third person.\n\nThe Highwaymen version [can be heard here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DirliJX14k), complete with a picture of a group of *braceros* boarding what looks like a DC-3 in 1951.\n\nJohnny Cash started off:\n\n&gt;The crops are all in, and the peaches are rotten\n\n&gt;The oranges are all packed in the creosote dumps\n\n&gt;They're flying them back to the Mexican Border\n\n&gt;To save all their money, and wade back again\n\nTo \"wade back again\"; although not every *bracero* came back to the farms in the United States a second or third time, there were plenty who did.  Numbers in each category are unknown.\n\nThe first two lines refers to another one of Guthrie's annoyances: food waste in the fields.  Destroying food crops helped to create artificial shortages, thus ensuring higher prices and economic stability for farmers.  To let a decent percentage of a harvest go to waste, whether by rotting on the tree or the vine or simply to throw it away and let it rot, was common.  At least in the case of soft-fleshed peaches, the fruit could easily be identified from the outside as bad so only the best-looking peaches would move toward the market.  Tough-skinned oranges don't have that, so rendering them inedible was a slightly different process, like being packed in creosote dumps.  This could involve either being tossed into disposal areas lined with creosote-soaked wood, or could involve actually exposing the fruit directly to liquid creosote.\n\nCreosote itself is extracted from several different sources; creosote used in agriculture was likely tar-based.  The stuff smells horrendous and is toxic as well.  And to give an example of how long it can last, earlier this year I was unearthing some old buried railroad ties that were falling apart.  They'd been there for at least 20 years, and I was using a pick to give me a handle of sorts to twist them out of the ground.  I found an intact one and slammed it with the pick, and my wife (who was 100 feet *upwind*) almost immediately yelled, \"What the bloody fuck is that smell?\"  If you've never smelled it, imagine extremely strong astringent mothballs.\n\nAnyway, Rodriguez had the next verse:\n\n&gt;My father's own father, he waded that river\n\n&gt;Others before him have done just the same\n\n&gt;They died in the hills, and they've died in the valley\n\n&gt;Some went to heaven, without any name\n\nAgain, farm work is brutal.  The hours are obscene, the pay is terrible, the conditions poor, and it's not exactly safe.  Guthrie's original line was: \"My father's own father, he waded that river, They took all the money he made in his life; My brothers and sisters come working the fruit trees, And they rode the truck till they took down and died.\"  Despite the reputation of The Highwaymen themselves and of Rodriguez as the standard-bearers of \"outlaw country\", they weren't touching that.\n\nCash, Rodriguez, and Nelson all sing together:\n\n&gt;Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita\n\n&gt;Adios mi amigo, Jesus y Maria\n\n&gt;You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane\n\n&gt;All they will call you will be \"Deportee\"\n\nLocal newspapers reported the entire list of crash victims at the time, and the media reporting on a new memorial caused a [couple of reprints to be made available](http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-deportees-guthrie-20130710-dto-htmlstory.html).\n\nWe see one Maria; her name was Maria Santana Rodriguez.  We see Jesus; he was Jesús Meza Santos.  And there's a Juan as well, that of Juan Valenzuela Ruiz.  But there is no Rosalita.  We only see a Rosalio (Rosalio Padilla Estrada).  \"Rosalio\" is a masculine name derived from \"rosa\", meaning \"rose\".  \"Rosalita\" is a feminine name, roughly translated as \"little rose\".  In short, there is no Rosalita.\n\nHowever, as any guy who's ever been inside of a locker room or spent a lot of time around friends or coworkers can attest to, butchering of names absolutely takes place as a form of mild teasing.  Carl becomes Carol, Stephen becomes Stephanie or simply Steph, Nate becomes Natalie, Michael becomes Michelle, and so on.  So could Rosalita in this case have actually been this type of teasing applied to Rosalio Padilla Estrada?  It's certainly possible.\n\nMoving on.  The next verse had Cash on the first two lines, and Nelson on the second two:\n\n&gt;Some of us are illegal, and others not wanted\n\n&gt;Our work contracts out, and we have to move on\n\n&gt;Six hundred miles to the Mexican Border\n\n&gt;They chase us like rustlers, like outlaws, like thieves\n\nAnd then the same breakdown:\n\n&gt;The sky-plane caught fire, over Los Gatos Canyon\n\n&gt;A fireball, a thunder, it shook all the hills\n\n&gt;Who are all these dear friends, scattered like dry leaves?\n\n&gt;The radio said they were just deportees\n\nI need to stop right here, mostly because that's the last verse and it's followed by the refrain twice more, including a spoken version by Rodriguez in Spanish.\n\nBut it's that last line...which radio said this, Woody?  We've established that California newspapers covered this in great detail, while your copy of the New York Times gave it a passing mention.  And you weren't in California, you were in New York.  I have my doubts that New Yorkers in 1948 were as concerned about Western farming practices and issues related to Mexico as in California.  I'd imagine that it would be tough to find anyone in New York in 1947 or 1948 who could pronounce \"bracero\", let alone explain anything about the program.  And I also know that as far as most New Yorkers are concerned, there are only two types of people in America: New Yorkers and rubes.  Or maybe New Yorkers and bumpkins.  Regardless, we're all barely removed from Jethro Bodine once we exit the Lincoln Tunnel heading west.\n\nNow, you may be wondering where the actual bad history comes in.  After all, Waylon Jennings has already been branded an accomplice to a liar; will all The Highwaymen suffer the same fate?\n\n&gt;Some of us are illegal, and others not wanted\n\n&gt;Our work contracts out, and we have to move on\n\n&gt;Six hundred miles to the Mexican Border\n\n&gt;They chase us like rustlers, like outlaws, like thieves\n\nIt has been said that there were at least one actual illegal on board the plane.  And considering the number of *bracero* strikes that took place during the early years of the program, it's very possible that some were not wanted.  Work contract's out and having to move on...yes, that's part of what the program was built on.  It wasn't a permanent job placement, it was work for a growing and harvest season and then heading back home.  No true bad history yet.\n\nBut it's not 600 miles to the Mexican border by plane no matter how you work it.  To go from Oakland (the original departure point) to El Centro (the final destination) even without the stopover in Burbank is only [512 miles](http://www.travelruler.com/flying-distance/from/Oakland,+CA/to/El+Centro,+CA); it was only [334 miles](http://www.travelruler.com/flying-distance/from/Oakland,+CA/to/Burbank,+CA) to the stop in Burbank.  From near the actual crash site at Los Gatos Canyon near Coalinga to El Centro is only [357 miles](http://www.travelruler.com/flying-distance/from/Coalinga,+CA/to/El+Centro,+CA), and only [178 miles](http://www.travelruler.com/flying-distance/from/Coalinga,+CA/to/Burbank,+CA) to Burbank.  \"Wait,\" you may think, \"but what about from Oakland to El Centro *with* the stopover?\"  Well, it's established that it was 334 miles from Oakland to Burbank.  And from Burbank to El Centro is just [185 miles](http://www.travelruler.com/flying-distance/from/Oakland,+CA/to/Burbank,+CA), making it 519 miles.  That's the longest possible distance, and is still short of 600.\n\n\"Aha!  But how far is it by *bus*?  After all, there was no interstate system!\"  This is true, there wasn't.  We do have [old maps](http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~239573~5511882:Road-Map-of-the-State-of-California) of what the roads and highways looked like at the time, and using the closest approximation of the original likely route [(17 south out of Oakland to 101, all the way to San Diego to 80 east into El Centro)](https://abigpicturewindow.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/bill-hader-fred-armisen-kristen-wiig-snl-the-californians1.png), we arrive with a total of [665 miles](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/32.7672758,-115.546134/Oakland,+CA/@34.8889631,-120.1418741,10z/data=!4m29!4m28!1m20!3m4!1m2!1d-117.0998547!2d32.7210461!3s0x80d953f251633af7:0x4b99ad0e34ce72ee!3m4!1m2!1d-120.1990866!2d34.5640413!3s0x80eeac8f7c6b58b3:0xcb6a7866ccdf0f9b!3m4!1m2!1d-121.344802!2d36.444466!3s0x809269303581339b:0x1692e5650c76857f!3m4!1m2!1d-121.8598596!2d37.349625!3s0x808fcce0f5cf8d73:0x896137eed2c9599b!1m5!1m1!1s0x80857d8b28aaed03:0x71b415d535759367!2m2!1d-122.2711137!2d37.8043637!3e0).   That's well over 600.  But again, it wasn't necessarily from Oakland; the crash was closest to Coalinga.  Well, the Coalinga-to-El Centro route still shows just [563 miles](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/El+Centro,+CA+92243/Coalinga,+CA/@33.3677841,-117.2754048,8z/data=!4m29!4m28!1m20!1m1!1s0x80d760fd0d64f065:0x13fc424de0426ee1!2m2!1d-115.5917918!2d32.7538822!3m4!1m2!1d-117.3250663!2d33.1220296!3s0x80dc72e5750de15d:0xbb571c6a36322f41!3m4!1m2!1d-120.2149621!2d34.4763747!3s0x80eeb26416e36a99:0x7b3cfc34a54ba7c!3m4!1m2!1d-120.694688!2d35.77431!3s0x80ecd2aaa0cdf363:0xd34f2899851788af!1m5!1m1!1s0x809341ffd6834e49:0xd0eb8b14273e7dd0!2m2!1d-120.3601496!2d36.139678!3e0).  But Los Gatos Canyon wasn't at Coalinga, it was outside of.  Yet even with adding the extra distance, it's *still* not 600 miles.  And of course, this also completely ignores the fact that the tragedy was a plane crash and not a bus crash.\n\nSo it wasn't 600 miles to the Mexican border at any point along the way.  There's no way to make it 600 miles, even by changing the mode of transportation and making the driver meander in circles for the better part of an hour.  And who sang the erroneous line?  Willie Nelson, as written by someone who apparently thought that he'd find the Dixie Flyer on a New York City subway line.\n\n**tl;dr - You're not alone, Waylon; Woody Guthrie made a liar of himself and Willie Nelson as well.**\n\nRecommended reading:\n\n[Bracero History Archive](http://braceroarchive.org/)\n\n[Braceros: Migrant Citizens and Transnational Subjects in the Postwar United States and Mexico](https://books.google.com/books/about/Braceros.html?id=NCN2BLWZpIAC) by Deborah Cohen",

He did a bad thing first!\" It's not really context, more an excuse.\n \n\"Racial purification\" isn't exactly correct to talk about given there weren't concentration camps where the end point was the extermination of peoples in the USA at that time. Bringing up context can be good, but I feel like it was presented as contrarian here rather than giving the context of global eugenics programs.\n \n \n#7 Myth - Hitler snubbed Jesse Owens\n \nTechnically correct, Hitler didn't specifically snub Jesse Owens.\n \n(I have this suspicion that he still held racist views though)\n \n \n#6 Myth - Hitler hid gold in Lake Toplitz\n \nYeah he didn't hide gold in that lake. Some Nazis probably did hide stuff as is evident with the whole \"Nazi Gold Train\" story from Poland recently.\n \n \n#5 Myth - All non-Jewish Germans supported Hitler.\n \nWell, yes. I get that this is supposed to be targeting people with low or middling knowledge in WW2 history, that wouldn't know that there was opposition to him.\n \nBut we need to get into nitpicky badhistory territory now. \"However in the 1933 election, which saw Hitler become Chancellor...\"\n \nHitler became Chancellor of Germany in January, before the March 1933 elections. Hitler didn't get into the Chancellorship position directly from an election but from the politics of the late Weimar Germany. I get that its trying to simplify the situation to a general audience but it is an important distinction when understanding Hitler's rise to power.\n\n#4 Myth - Hitler founded the Nazi Party.\n \nHe didn't! However...\n \n\"Hitler joined as a public speaker, and only grudgingly took leadership...\"\n \nGrudgingly took leadership? Knowing he was incredibly powerful in the party, he threatened to quit outright and engineered a situation where he was able to take over the party outright and absolutely.\nhttp://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/riseofhitler/leader.htm\n \nI mean I am curious where they got that idea from, that Hitler just went \"oh well, I guess I'll HAVE to lead the party then, gosh, so lame\", as if he wasn't an ambitious manipulator.\n \n \n#3 Myth - Only Aryans fought for the Nazi Party\n \nNow here, is where when I first saw this video I knew it was destined for badhistory. \"Groups of Indian and Jewish men fought under the Nazi flag...\"\n \nThe Indian Legion did exist, but Jewish men fighting under the Nazi flag? Finland was an independent nation. An independent nation that allied with an abominable state in World War II, but one that did not rule by Nazi decree.\n \nThat Jewish soldiers were in the Finnish Army does not mean the Nazis somehow tolerated Jews. It's really obvious the Nazis did not tolerate Jews.\n \nThey *might* be super pedantic and pointing out that during the War they physically fought underneath the Finnish Airforce who had used a blue swastika from 1918 until 1945, but that's my shtick.\n \nThis could've been a decent point to educate those that didn't know that there were Indian, Bosnian, Spanish or even American contingents of soldiers who fought for the Nazis. Instead they went for a silly interpretation of Finland's role in the war, to say \"Jews fought for the Nazis!!\"\n \n#2 Myth - Only Germans are responsible for the holocaust.\n \nHere they speak of the forgotten holocaust, where half a million **ROMANIANS** were killed by Nazi allies.\n \nNow, I hope you all know this, but Romanians, are not the same as Roma. Roma, or Romani, would be the name given for a group of people who previously would have been known as the currently unacceptable term \"gypsies\". There are quite a lot of Roma in Romania, but they are not the same peoples.\n \nThis is a HUGE MISTAKE, an incredible fuck up. The statistics they've used are almost certainly in my mind cut and pasted from this part of wikipedia for the Civilian and Military casualties for the country of Romania (an ally of Germany through much of the war): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties#Total_deaths for Romanian deaths.\n \nFurther down this same page, if they had used Wikipedia, they'd have seen this important part that actually discusses Roma: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties#Non-Jews_persecuted_and_killed_by_the_Nazis\n \nThere were a variety of victims of concentration camps, active genocide, and in all the victims of WW2. It's important to remember and acknowledge them all, but given videos like this which have not even bothered to understand the difference between ethnic Roma victims of killings and concentration camps, to Romania which was an active participant on the Nazi side of World War II, I doubt videos like this contribute to such recognition.\n \nThis could have been a valid point for their audience, that there were other oft forgotten victims of the Holocaust and of the Nazi atrocities. That also several nationalist groups across Europe participated eagerly in the Holocaust and other genocidal atrocities, like the Independent State of Croatia and their eagerness for ethnic cleansing of more than just Jews and Roma. But this video failed to address that.\n \n \n#1 Myth - All Nazis were monsters\n \nThere's not much to say here is there? Not everyone who was in the administration was a cartoon villain, but unfortunately enough were. That's very possibly why we had the war.\n \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI am not sure these types of history videos are innately a bad thing, they're trying to present history in a somewhat entertaining/infotainment setting, which needs to condense some things down to reach people who otherwise wouldn't be interested.\n \nI don't think this succeeded in making history more available to the masses though. Some of this was technically true, if not obvious, but this fell well below par on some very basic and sensitive issues about the holocaust in World War 2, and basic WW2 history.",

        "text": "&gt;“Get it all on record now – get the films – get the witnesses – because somewhere down the track of history some bastard will get up and say that this never happened.” \n\nThis is the supposed quote that so very many people evoke in claiming that Eisenhower predicted Holocaust denial. This is also, you may notice, sketchy as hell. Typically, when a quote seems to predict something that happened just as the quote said, it's a fake quote. In fact, there is no evidence of this direct quote. It is cited in no books. The first reference to it I could find was a blog post from 2007, and cited Wikipedia which in turn cited an article from the Dominican Republic (which also claimed that the UK no longer taught about The Holocaust.) Even that article states that he only said words *to that effect*; admitting it's a paraphrase.\n\nIs it true that Eisenhower wanted to make the Holocaust undeniable? Yes. But it wasn't because he predicted a conspiracy theory decades later. According to a trustworthy source (Dear General: Eisenhower's Wartime Letters to Marshall), Eisenhower visited the camps firsthand so that he could provide a firsthand account to anyone who chalked up the horrors of the Holocaust to propaganda. That is not even close to what people online claim. Here's the actual quote:\n\n&gt;\"The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty and bestiality were so overpowering as to leave me a bit sick. In one room, where they [there] were piled up twenty or thirty naked men, killed by starvation, George Patton would not even enter. He said that he would get sick if he did so. I made the visit [to Gotha] deliberately, in order to be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to “propaganda.”\n\nNot as soundbite-ready, is it? Beyond the poached paraphrasing, people seem to misunderstand *who* Eisenhower was expecting to deny the Holocaust. When people cite this as a fact today, they seem to be implying that Eisenhower was expecting anti-semites in the future to deny the existence of the Holocaust, and *that's* the reason for the documentation. In fact, though, the footage taken by the Army Signal Corps was used at the Nuremberg Trials to indict the Nazis of war crimes.\n\nTL;DR Eisenhower was expecting the Nazis to deny the Holocaust, not antisemitic conspiracy theorists.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3m75ju/time_chart_the_entire_2000_year_history_of_the/",
        "text": "[Chart in question](http://time.com/4045694/pope-francis-us-visit-history-of-the-pope/)\n\nR5: Comically oversimplified, gives a terribly bad impression of the history of the Papacy. This is not my area of expertise and I fully expect (and welcome) corrections from the rest of BH.\n\nAs a religious topic, a frank exchange of views may be offensive to some. Let me clarify that if you believe that the history of the Church has played out the way it has because of God's will and that modern Catholic doctrine is divinely inspired *I have no problem with that even if I do not believe the same.* My aim here is to discuss the development of the Papacy, not to tar doctrines as \"untrue\" or \"wrong.\"\n\nOkay, so it's a single line with a list of names and a handful of ~~major~~ famous events. There's not a whole lot of place for detail here. However, the naive reader would be terribly misguided if they were to only read this chart. Seriously, I've seen catechism pamphlets that give a better idea.\n\nI'll give a very sketchy overview of two examples of badhistory by omission here - first, the idea that the Bishop of Rome has been comparable to the modern Pope from the very first; second, that there has been an unbroken, incontrovertible line of succession from St. Peter to Pope Francis.\n\n**The Papacy as we understand it did not appear fully formed, but developed over time and continues to evolve**\n\nIf there's three things that distinguish the Bishop of Rome from other Bishops in the Church, those are\n\n\n*Papal Supremacy*\n\nThe doctrine that the Bishop of Rome has authority over the rest of the Bishops. While the modern Church holds that bishops are appointed by the authority of the Pope, this is quite a modern practice. The earliest bishops were chosen by the faithful, by the priests over whom he'd have authority, by secular rulers or simply chosen by the bishop they'd replace. The Investiture Controversy wasn't fully settled until the middle of the 19th Century, which event probably had more to do with secular authorities generally adopting a separation of Church and State rather than the Papacy imposing itself.\n\nThe doctrine of Papal Supremacy is canonically based on a reading of [Matthew 16:17-19](http://www.drbo.org/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=16&amp;l=17-19#x). However, the earliest Bishops of Rome seem to have made no such claim, and authority over the Nicene Church (to which the Bishops of Rome belonged pre-schism) was held by a mix of clerical and temporal powers, importantly the Byzantine Emperors. From 537 to 752 the Bishops of Rome depended on Byzantine Imperial approval for episcopal consecration (selection of bishops) even for parishes directly dependent on the Pope. Constantius II went as far as to exile Pope Liberius (ruled 352-356) from Rome, as happened again to Martin I in 653 and several others. Damasus I (ruled 356 to 384) was named \"Bishop of Bishops\" by the Emperor, which may speak to the authority of the Bishop of Rome, but *also* speaks to the authority of the Emperor over him. The first claimant of Papal supremacy as we understand it seems to have been Innocent I (ruled 401-417), but this was not generally accepted within the Church. From 476 Rome was generally ruled by so-called heretics, occasionally occupied by Byzantine troops who had no interest in undermining Imperial authority, and overshadowed by more important parishes within the Church. Only in 616 did a Catholic inherit the throne to the Kingdom of Lombardy, and the struggle with the Emperors for supremacy within the Church would continue until the Great Schism in 1054.\n\nThis is not to say that the Bishops of Rome did not hold a position of honor among other Bishops. The point here is that for about half of Church history, the Pope was *not* the boss.\n\n\n*Papal Infallibility*\n\nThe doctrine that the Pope may speak infallibly on matters of doctrine. As I showed above, the doctrine of Papal Supremacy developed over a centuries long period. Papal Infallibility did not become official Catholic doctrine until 1870 (First Vatican Council), but this was an acknowledgement of the *status quo* rather than a new idea. The earliest example of someone using the idea of Papal infallibility as an argument to settle a theological dispute may be the case of Peter Olivi in the 13th Century, but this was actually rejected by the Pope John XXII. Nevertheless, the idea that the Pope would be the final arbiter of doctrine in the Church gained ground, enough that several Catholic theologians wrote *against* the idea before Vatican I finally settled the matter.\n\n*Papal Sovereignty*\n\nUniquely among (current) bishops, the Pope is the Head of State of a sovereign nation (the Vatican). This is not a new thing: While the modern Vatican State was created by a decree issued by Benito Mussolini in 1929, the first independent Papal State emerged (more by custom than anything else) sometime in the 7th Century as the Duchy of Rome, and continued until the Papal States were finally lost to Italy in 1870.\n\nNevertheless, we have a period of some 600 years between the birth of the Church and the creation (if that's even the right word) of the Duchy of Rome when the Pope was in no sense a temporal ruler.\n\n\n**LOOK FOR PART II IN THE COMMENTS**",

        "text": "[This little article](https://www.warhistoryonline.com/war-articles/the-last-russian-battlefield-of-wwii-remains-of-russian-and-japanese-soldiers-found-on-shumshu-island.html) on Warhistoryonline appeared as an ad on Facebook today.  As the title says, I'm picking at some pretty low-hanging fruit here, but this must be one of the least factually accurate articles about WWII I've ever read (Nazi moon bases and UFOs aside).\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n&gt;Russia though not fully prepared to take on the military might and readiness of Adolf Hitler, fought back very hard and eventually pushed back the Nazis and defeated them to Berlin. The news of Russian success in Europe was received by the US as a threat since Russians were expected to take part in the Pacific theatre of the war if US failed to bring Japan to its knees.\n\nThe second sentence here is problematic.  Yes, Soviet success in Europe was seen as a threat by the UK, and to a smaller extent, the US.  But that was in the context of Soviet domination over Eastern and Central Europe after the war.  Soviet entry into the war against Japan was formalized as an [express term of the Yalta Conference](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/yalta.asp).  This was something that the US specifically negotiated for, so why would the US now see Soviet participation in the Pacific Theatre as a threat? \n\n&gt;Russian experts have been excavating and looking for the remnants of the **only Russia-Japan combat incident in the Second World War**. So far Russian researches have unearthed the remains of at least 26 soviet and 9 Japanese troops from the ShumshuIsland [sic]. In the battle fought between the Russian troops and Japanese Imperial Army 500 Russians and 250 members of Japanese Army perished, Russia ultimately claimed victory.\n\nNow we get to the most egregious falsehood.  Apparently this island skirmish was the *only Russia-Japan combat incident in the Second World War*.  This completely ignores the entire [Soviet Invasion of Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria#Combatant_forces) in which 1.5 million Soviet troops crushed the 700,000 man Japanese Kwantung Army.  \n\nIn that invasion, the Soviets lost over 12,000 dead while the Japanese allegedly suffered 83,000 fatalities.  This is a far cry from the \"500 Russians and 250 members of Japanese army\" that perished in supposedly the \"*only*\" Russo-Japanese \"combat incident\" of WWII.    \n\n&gt;Japan had the ownership of the Kuril Islands as a result of an 1875 treaty with then Russian Empire. In return Japan abandoned its right over Sakhalin Island that went under Russian control. However Russia maintains that it has actually liberated the Kuril Islands from Japanese occupation, essentially denying the existence of any such treaty.\n\nThis explanation is a gross oversimplification of the legal dispute over the Kuril Islands.  Yes, Japan and the Russian Empire did sign the Treaty of St Petersburg, wherein Russia relinquished their claim over the Kurils in return for Japan relinquishing its claim over Sakhalin.  That being said, the Russo-Japanese War of 1905 resulted in Russia giving up Southern Sakhalin to Japan.  Arguably, this later treaty abrogates at least some of the terms of the Treaty of St Petersburg.  \n\nThat aside, modern disagreements over the Islands' status come from the confusing clusterfuck of treaties that divvied up territories amongst the Allies at the end of WWII.  The agreement at Yalta explicitly stated that the Kuril Islands would be handed over to the USSR.  Of course, there was subsequent disagreement over the Islands between Japan, the US and the USSR at the Treaty of San Francisco in 1951. \n\nEither way, it's incredibly simplistic to paint the situation as one of Russia invading land that it clearly gave away in 1875.  \n\n",

I think it's fairly well recognised that the Japanese have not been as good as (say) the Germans in facing up to war atrocities, but some of the \"facts\" set out here were pretty laughable. I took a few pics (apologies for potato quality but had to be quick as taking photos was not allowed) in [this album](http://imgur.com/a/Nrg5G) - some of my favourites were that:\n\n* Chinese citizens respected and applauded invading Japanese soldiers for their discipline and good behaviour\n* The Korean government was impressed with the fair terms set out in the Japanese annexation treaty\n* Japan spearheaded the drive for racial equality, and we have them to thank for the post-WW2 independence movements\n\nAlso when walking around the museum, I overheard a guy loudly explaining to tourists that the Rape of Nanking (\"the Nanking Incident\") is blown completely out of proportion by the Chinese due to political reasons, and that really the \"citizens\" supposedly killed were cowardly soldiers in disguise. Despite an otherwise amazing trip to Japan, the idea that this version of history with seemingly no repentance seems to be the standard view there left a bit of a bad taste...\n\n**Edit** - additional info/examples on why this is bad history, as requested by mods:\n\n* The museum had a general air of whitewashing the efforts of the Empire of Japan in WW2 and previously (similar to the [textbook controversies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_history_textbook_controversies))\n* For example, in the [Rape of Nanking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanking_Massacre), the account in this museum (one short paragraph tucked away as a small 'aside') completely ignore the very widely accepted occurrences of mass murder and mass rape of civilians\n* The claim that Japan helped spur on independence movements is a stretch at best - indeed [Japanese nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_nationalism) and the perception of Japanese racial superiority was one of the roots of Japanese overseas invasions, which contrasts strongly with the supposed \"advancement of the ideals of racial equality\" that they cite\n* Obviously, Chinese citizens didn't think the Rape of Nanking constituted good behaviour (most of us being brought up to think that rape/murder are bad things...), and similarly Koreans did not respect the terms of a treaty that annexed their country",

I saw [this picture](https://facebook.com/humansofnewyork/photos/pb.102099916530784.-2207520000.1441800777./1072971669443599/?type=1&amp;source=54) posted with the attached quote and immediately suspected it of being wrong.\n\n\"nobody ever got invaded by a grandma\"\n\nAnd because I like a good challenge I thought I'd find how many female heads of state have invaded another's territory after the birth of their first grandchild. I hope this post doesn't violate R2 as although the picture refers to current political leaders the bad history itself is a historical statement. Anyway onto the history...\n\n**Queen Victoria** This was the first female ruler I thought of due to the length of her reign, just recently being surpassed by Elizabeth II. Victoria's first grandchild, [German Khaiser Wilhelm II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor) was born 27 January 1859. After this date the British Empire would invade [Zululand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Zulu_War), [the Ashanti Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Anglo-Ashanti_War#Fourth_Anglo-Ashanti_War), [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Egyptian_War), and [Mahdist Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongola_Expedition). Evidently the main thrust of Great Britain's imperial ambitions in this period was in the African continent.\n\n**Queen Elizabeth II** Sticking with Great Britain the aforementioned Queen Elizabeth, following the birth of her grandson [Prince William, Duke of Cambridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_William,_Duke_of_Cambridge) in 1982, became another \"grandma\" head of state. In the subsequent years of her reign Great Britain has invaded both [Afghanistan in 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001–present)) and [Iraq in 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_invasion_of_Iraq). Clearly having a female head of state with grandchildren didn't stop Great Britain's propensity to invade others.\n\n**Indira Gandhi** This example proves that it is not only monarchical grandmas that are a threat to the territorial sovereignty of other countries. Indira Gandih's first grandchild is current Vice-President of the Indian National Congress, [Rahul Gandhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi), born 19 June 1970. A little over a year later India was at [war with Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971) as a result of interference in the Bangladesh Liberation War. India, as well as securing BangladeshI independence, captured over 15,000 square kilometres of West Pakistani territory, though this would later be cended in the 1972 Simla Agreement.\n\nSo just here we have 3 grandmas weilding differing levels of political power as heads of states that invaded others. I think this proves grandmas must be feared as much as anyone else and we mustn't buy into such constructivist interpretations of history. I'm on my mobile abusing hostel wifi currebtly but surely there are otger bellicose grandmothers throughout history waiting to be discovered.",

I intend to…\n \n… oh wait, you think this looks familiar? You've seen it before? Probably. By my count there have been at least three previous badhistory critiques of the 'masterpost', of which /u/TheZizekiest's was [the most coherent.](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3hncq3/the_repetition_of_meaningless_ideologies_is_no/)\n \nBut I think there's still a few points to nail on why this is just horrendously bad. Given that I've started seeing it referenced elsewhere on Reddit, I've decided to pull out the vodka and tackle this myself. So time for me to take you all on another tour through post-Soviet academic controversies and historiography. Cheer up, Timmy; it'll be fun.\n \nSo what exactly are my problems with the list? Not much. Just it being a thoroughly dishonest presentation of history works to support apologism for a regime responsible for the deaths of millions. No more than that.\n \nI'm not setting out to prove or disprove the 'myths' in question, although I'll provide some context around these, but I want to illustrate how the list has been disingenuously put together. That is, I question the very worth of the masterpost when its presentation of its sources is basically bollox. It:\n \n* Ignores context to misinterpret academic sources\n \n* Presents sources that directly contradict the arguments being made\n \n* Includes some very poor quality sources\n \nI'm going to spare my liver somewhat by restricting myself to the first two 'myths' and the sources used. Most of this deals with historiography but do try to stay awake.\n \n**ANTI-COMMUNIST MYTH NUMBER 1: THE SOVIET UNION MANUFACTURED A FAMINE IN UKRAINE**\n \n*Context*\n\nStraight up: this is an entirely reasonable position. Over the past few decades the debate about the Soviet famines of 1932-33 has, in English literature at least, largely moved away from claims of a 'manufactured' famine. The opening of the archives has failed to support such a assertion and it's near-universally accepted today that the harvest in these years failed. Even the likes of Robert Conquest had backed away from claims of 'genocide'. Consensus remains elusive but claims of deliberate 'terror-famine' can and should be challenged.\n \nWell, that was quick…\n \n…oh wait. There's more?\n \nThe debate about responsibility for the famines has shifted but not gone away. Instead much of the post-Soviet research has situated these mass deaths in the broader context of Soviet agricultural mismanagement and economic gambling. That is, the degree to which Soviet economic policy (ie collectivisation) created the conditions for famine and how the state reacted to this (ie callously). The question becomes whether the Soviet government *intended* to kill millions or merely did so through *gross incompetence* in the pursuit of its industrial programme.\n \nBut, to be clear, few in academia would reject that the Stalinist state was responsible for the deaths of millions via famine. The debate today turns around definitions of genocide and allocation of blame in the absence of intent. Don't expect that one to be settled soon.\n \n*Sources*\n\nSo the debate about the famine deaths is significantly more nuanced than presented in this binary 'myth'. But I'm sure the author of this list didn't know that, right? Well, this is where the problems really start. To the references!\n \nOf their sources, both Davies and Tauger are serious academics who have made valuable contributions to the field. Technically r/communism is correct – both dispute the idea that Stalin 'manufactured' a famine as part of an ideological or anti-Ukrainian drive. *However* both also argue that the famine deaths were ultimately products of Stalinist agricultural policy.\n \nOne of the works referenced, *Years of Hunger* draws out four key reasons for the famines. I've summarised these before, [here,](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/38y4gc/was_the_holodomor_caused_intentionally_or_not_by_the_collectivization_of_ag/crze4kl?context=3) but the important point is that three of these are the products of state policy. Weather was a factor (see below) but Davies and Wheatcroft paint a picture of a Soviet leadership struggling to resolve, via its typical \"ruthless and brutal\" fashion, a crisis unleashed largely by its own manic drive for breakneck industrialisation.\n \nThe fourth factor they note is the weather, something that Tauger places much more emphasis on. Simplifying massively, Tauger argues that farming was collectivised before the famine, farming was collectivised after the famine and therefore something else (ie the weather) must have happened during the famine. This marks Tauger out in a relatively extreme position but it's primarily a difference in emphasis. He still accepts that the famine was \"the result of a failure of economic policy, of the 'revolution from above'\" and that the \"regime was responsible for the deprivation and suffering of the Soviet population in the early 1930s\". (*The 1932 Harvest and Famine of 1933*)\n \n(The third source, Tottle, is little more than a fellow traveller. His, non-academic, work is less concerned with the famine than it is regurgitating conspiracy theories about Hearst propaganda. /u/TheZizekiest has covered Tottle [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3hncq3/the_repetition_of_meaningless_ideologies_is_no/); I feel that this is overly generous. I would put Tottle in the same bucket as Furr *et al* below; my criticisms of them also apply here.)\n\n*Summary*\n\nSo the two academic sources provided agree that there was no deliberate starvation programme but still hold the Soviet state responsible for the economic policies and conditions that gave rise to famine. Yet, knowing this, r/communism still framed the question in a narrow way to omit this entire discussion. Few academics today would argue that the Soviet state 'manufactured' a famine, many would hold that it was nonetheless still responsible for millions of excess famine deaths.\n\nStill a bit woolly? Not sure you've got all the nuances? Don't worry, it gets significantly more straightforward in Part 2, below.\n\n**PART 2 BELOW**",

        "text": "Well, the time has come to once again to subject myself to another documentary. This is another in the Ancient Warrior series and focuses on the Assyrians:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmXYQOzOROg\n\nThis time I have several bottles of imaginary Soju and a medical team on stand-by. Let's begin!\n\n1.06: The narrator describes the Assyrian method as the cruellest. That is very much up for debate. The Assyrians certainly produced propaganda about all the people they conquered and slaughtered, but such brutality (as judged by our morality) was very much an accepted standard of behaviour during the Bronze and Iron ages. Bloody retribution was considered \"civilized\" behaviour. Just look at the law code of Hammurabi:\n\n\"If any one is committing a robbery and is caught, then he shall be put to death.\"\n\n\"If a \"sister of a god\" open a tavern, or enter a tavern to drink, then shall this woman be burned to death.\"\n\n\"If a physician make a large incision with the operating knife, and kill him, or open a tumor with the operating knife, and cut out the eye, his hands shall be cut off.\"\n\nSimilarly, Egyptian Pharoahs proudly proclaimed the people they killed. The Pharoah Merneptah impaled numerous prisoners during his reign. Likewise the Elamite King Siwe-Palar-huhpak prayed that his enemies be impaled, burned and bound. The actions of the Assyrians certainly had precedent. DRINK! \n\n2.55: This really sounds like bad fan-fiction.\n\n3.56: Is it wrong that I wish a similar punishment to those who drive under the speed limit?\n\n5.54: Famers needed a plough-share and a sword? Biblical references aside, a sword would have been too expensive for a farmer. The most common weapon would have been a spear. DRINK!\n\n6.38: \"With each change of seasons, the Empire withered\". If we are still going from the starting point of 1000 BC, this was during the reign of Ashur-Rabi II and the Bronze Age Collapse. Assyria actually endured the Bronze Collapse very well and remained stable. It lost some land to the Aramaens, but quickly recaptured the area. A successful counter-attack and re-conquest could hardly be described as \"withering\", nor could the justification for a slight territorial decline be attributed to soldiers needing to return to their fields. DRINK!\n\n6.47: \"Rebellion Sprouted\". When? Where? Does the narrator refer to the loss of land to the Aramaens? That was an invasion, not a rebellion. DRINK!\n\n6.57: \"A new king took the throne and changed history\". Wait, so Tiglath Piseler came from the future and decided to change the timeline? That is the only way the sentence makes sense. Unless one ascribes to the philosophy that all events are inevitable (Screw you, Determinists!), there is no way Tiglath-Piseler could have changed something that had not happened yet. DRINK!\n\n7.05: Standing army? So previous military tactics involved sitting? Okay, sorry, that was terrible. Besides, Tiglath-Piseler III never actually boasted of creating an army of full-time professionals. At least, I could find no reference to it in any inscriptions. This claim is drawn from references of constant campaigns which would have required such a force. A reasonable deduction to make, but the narrator makes it appear as though Tiglath-Piseler actually said \"I am using soldiers that always fight and drill instead of a seasonal militia\". Never happened. DRINK!\n\n8.25: \"Some carried no weapon at all. Their role was to protect other warriors. They gave cover to archers with shields\". Meanwhile, the reliefs show soldiers covering archers, holding a shield and a spear. Hardly unarmed, are they? DRINK!\n\n9.12: Narrator states that Assyrians campaigned to acquire tools of war. The reasons for conquest are complex, and can range from ideological or religious justification, self-defence or desire for glory. Often the acquisition of wealth was a by-product rather than reason for state-organized warfare. Reducing such actions to \"claiming material goods\" is a gross simplification. DRINK!\n\n9.33: Ebony and Ivory? This is proof that bad music was being made even back then.\n\n10.09: Is it wrong that I just thought of a really racist joke to make?\n\n10.32:  The Assyrians had a really pro-active policy to discourage work-place absenteeism.\n\n12.04: Apparently using boats to transport things was a new innovation in the 7th century BC. I'll let the Egyptians know. DRINK!\n\n13.05: Clumsy four-wheeled carts of Babylonia? The ones who used such carts were Sumerians, around 2600 BC, or around 2000 years BEFORE the time period presently being discussed in the documentary (8th and 7th century BC). Plus Babylon was a completely separate civilization to Sumeria. Proper chariots had been in use since 1700 BC. DRINK!\n\n14.05: Horsemen were not new. They were used on the steppe and Assyrians reliefs show cavalry in use since the 9th century BC. DRINK! \n\n15.26: \"Where the Assyrians could not send their army, they dispatched terror\". This statement is funny if you imagine Terror is the name for their pet Chihuahua.\n\n17.28: \"With it they would pound the weakest point\". Hehehehehehehehehe.\n\n17.29: The displayed image is not actually a battering ram but a form of siege tower that would destabilize and chip away at the wall. Essentially a giant sapping tool. DRINK!\n\n19.30: \"Shielded by Ishtar, Goddess of War.\" Female deities were not standard issue to soldiers. They were difficult to carry. DRINK!\n\n19.50: \"The carnage was unspeakable\". Then he started speaking about it.\n\n21.32: \"Carried them off to Bondage in Assyria\". Fifty Shades of Sennacherib.\n\n21.40: References a fantasy book as a historical source. DRINK!\n\n22.45: \"Civilization flourished as it never had\". Compared to what? Egypt? Babylon? Elam? By which measure? Living standards? Comparative level of wealth? Peace within external borders? Literacy? DRINK!\n\n23.00: Whole Middle-east? So all of Anatolia, Iran and Arabia then? DRINK!\n\nWell, that was an.....experience.

Also, excising the US from Western history because \"we'll teach you that next year\" is bad because the US is the most populous country in Western civilization and has been well-integrated into Western history since the days of [Marie-Joseph de Long First Name du Lafayette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_du_Motier,_Marquis_de_Lafayette), who used his experiences in the US to draft the Declaration of Rights of Man of Citizen in Revolutionary France.

        "text": "https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3kv98g/were_the_central_powers_really_the_bad_guys/cv1qshy?context=1\n\n&gt; All of Europe (involved in the war) is really to blame, from the Governments to the popular masses. Very few people opposed the war, either out of fear of being chastised (or worse), or lack of conviction. After that first year when modern war became a reality to so many millions who thirsted for it, that is when things got messed up.\n\n&gt; Commanders using outdated tactics and modern technology and millions dead, who ever won would not admit their part in this fiasco, so when Germany surrendered they got the blame, mostly because the Austrian-Hungarian empire was gone as were the Turkish empire.\n\nStarting out with some run of the mill WWI badhistory. My [First World War BadHistory Effort Post](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2hietf/first_world_war_effortpost_why_did_they_bother/) is a great place to start if you are interested in the bullshit of this. The whole \"slither to war\" nonsense is debunked thoroughly in just about any academic work after 1962. Fritz Fischer's *German War Aims in the First World War*, Holger Herwig's *Clio Deceived: Patriotic Self-Censorship in Germany after the Great War*, Holger Herwig's other wonderful work *The First World War: Germany and Austria-Hungary, 1914-1918*, Annika Mombauer's work *Diplomatic and Military Documents* and *The Origins of the First World War: Controversies and Consensus* all speak on the origins of the war. These are all great places to start if you are interested in this matter. \n\nThe whole \"war enthusiam\" trite is just that -- trite nonsense. Here's a [spectacular post on the matter](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1rxxqn/war_enthusiasm_in_world_war_1/) over in /r/Askhistorians. It is also worth noting, as is expertly laid out in Robert Doughty's *Pyrrhic Victory: French Strategy and Operations in the Great War*, the 'war enthusiasm' was not some endemic issue even in the political circles. Ultimately, from all the sources I've read, the picture is pretty clear -- yes the military's all wanted the war. If you look at Joffre's, Moltke's, and Hötzendorf's camps you see a bunch of people who all eagerly want war. Shit even Joffre wanted to violate Belgian neutrality first to strike at Germany. *However*, the difference is that the government of France *strictly controlled the ambitions of their generals* thus representing the anti-chauvinist, socialist base they represented. The German and Austro-Hungarian and even Russian governments let their general staffs run wild -- even Willhelm II himself could not stop the Generals from issuing mobilization plans when he had last second cold feet because they actively conspired to disallow him to send out the telegrams to stop it. That's the big thing here we need to keep in mind. Politicians and the people were quite uneasy and even anxious about the war, it's just that some general staffs were allowed to run rampant when given the opportunity.\n\nFuck I'm not even to the actual shittiness yet and I'm already tired.\n\n&gt;&gt; As is the myth of \"outdated tactics\"\n\n&gt; Massed infantry charges into barbed wire, machine gun nests, and artillery supported positions are very much examples of outdated tactics.\n\nThis will be a repeated theme throughout his post. He'll take a fragment of a single sentence out of numerous paragraphs, give a one sentence quip, and call it a day. \n\nMen never mindlessly charged into barbed wire without regard. They used shrapnel from artillery to cut it and then advance teams to cut what remained under covering fire. Once wire was cut the men would then and only then advance from cover.\n\nYes if there is a machine gun nest and you need to take that hill you need to attack the machine gun nest. This was not done by mindlessly bayonet charging a concrete bunker. It was done with flamethrowers, rifle grenades, bombs, mortars, close artillery support, smoke cover, and infiltration tactics with a large covering fire screen. Yes even in 1914 and 1915 bar technological advances like the flamethrower.\nYes men attacked artillery supported positions. They did in WW2 and Korea and Iraq and are doing it now in Ukraine and Syria. Most forces are supported by artillery and machine guns. How is this somehow \"old tactics\" precisely is beyond me.\n\nNo one claims lots of people died or that barbed wire was effective or that artillery killed a lot. We claim, as is fact, that they weren't mindless idiots using line formation firing shoulder to shoulder. If a massed infantry attack is what you qualify as outdated well you're going to have to call Guderian, Rommel, Zhukov, Patton, and Eisenhower a bunch of idiots too.\n\nHis retort:\n\n&gt; So explain the 4 years of 1860s style warfare with 1910s style weapons if they weren't using outdated tactics.\n\nOmfg lol. A broken record. Simple answer: 1860s styled warfare was never used. Something reminiscent of it was used strictly in 1914 and early 1915 but that's it.  Defense in depth with outposts and pillboxes and very fluid infiltration and raid based warfare that took over in 1917 with limited trenches remaining and advanced artillery tactics took over as well. By Spring 1917 the British and French tactical doctrines looked more like 1944 than 1914. By 1915 the French had advanced infiltration and small unit doctrine and the British were using hurricane barrages and infiltration as well by 1916.\n\nHe would reply to these facts:\n\n&gt; Trenches lasted until 1918.\n\nHOW IS THAT A RETORT. AT ALL. There are trenches still in Flanders today, guess trench warfare was used in WWII ;))))) Literally his argument is trenches lasted 4 years. They didn't. By 1917 they were gone along with all remnants of static warfare. \n\n\n&gt; You are putting \"academia\" above historical evidence.\n\nWHAAT. Is this real life.\n\n&gt;&gt; Saying \"this happened\" is not a primary source.\n\n&gt; Saying \"this happened at that time\" is actually a reference to a primary source such as a parade, or a vote for war, or a protest.\n\nWhich parade? Saying they happened isn't a primary source, you must cite a specific one. Which? When? Who showed up? How many?\n\n&gt;&gt; You have some serious disdain for books and historians.\n\n&gt; Just historians who ignore evidence that don't fit their arguments.\n\nOH GOD. IRONY OVERLOAD. \n\n&gt; So you are shouting at me that they spent 4 years, (1914, 1915, 1916, and 1917) with trench warfare (those outdated tactics you denied they used)?\n\nNO. THEY. DID. NOT.\n\nOut of nowhere [Dux comes to the rescue and we get another comment chain full of shit.](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3kv98g/were_the_central_powers_really_the_bad_guys/cv20v1a)\n\n&gt; This does not negate the larger pro war movement. There were anti war protests in world war 2, that does not negate the fact that world war 2 was the only massively popular war in US history.\n\n\"Much larger pro war movement\" [citation needed]\n\n&gt;&gt; This is a tired cliché of the war; while I will not deny that there were unfortunate cases early on in the trench war, and to an extent on the north front of the 1st Day of the Somme, claiming that they represent the norm for the war is ridiculous.\n\n&gt; Then explain why it lasted for 4 years.\n\nHe does realize WWII lasted 6 years, right?\n\n&gt;&gt; Again, you're playing up the old myth of 'War Enthusiasm', and utterly ignoring at least 3 decades of research.\n\n&gt; no amount of research can make historical events go away. These things happened. You have to face them when you write history otherwise the argument is crap.\n\nNo one is saying they didn't happen. We say that he's massively overstating it. \n\n&gt; The Trench warfare on the western front is pretty hard to deny. The battle lines being pretty static because of the very slow adoption of modern tactics is pretty well settled in historical discourse. The why and so-what can be discussed but the fact that the western front was very sluggish is pretty much solid\n\nThe Battle lines were not static for \"old tactics meeting new technology\", you'll be hard pressed to cite some academically reputable work that supports that. Trench warfare was a strategic more than a tactical consequence strictly limited to a particular region in France between 1915 and 1916. The historical consensus, the actual one from actual books I've actually read as an actual historian, is that trench warfare ended in late 1916. Not for tactical but strategic reasons.\n\n&gt; I am arguing that old tactics were used, not the same tactics. You can call it preposterous if you want but then you need to explain why the war was rather static on the western front.\n\n1. New tactics were developed every year by everyone\n\n2. It wasn't static for four years, it was for *two*\n\n3. It was static because of strategic and geographic considerations. The Germans benefited from holding off on the West and thus dug into the most advantageous positions possible in France while they redirected Eastward for the 1915 campaigns in Russia. Meanwhile Britain temporarily abandoned victory in France, seeking victory in the Ottoman Empire instead. The focus was not France in 1915. When 1916 rolled around the stalemate was broken strategically as all sides performed massive offensives (Somme, Verdun, Brusilov) and afterward the static trenches were abandoned en masse for WWII styled defense in depth. \n\n&gt;&gt; Why don't you name some historians? I've cited the front runner experts on this matter below, dozens. Where is this consensus you speak of because it's not there in any of those works.\n\n&gt; Look, This isn't the kind of debate where you gather a bunch of people who agree with you and I gather my side and we vote. I have presented an argument for you to evaluate. You can't seem to think for your self. You need to find others to tell you what is.\n\nThis is too rich. This is amazing. This isn't how academic arguments work by the way.\n\n&gt;&gt; It [massive war enthusiasm] was NOT a historical event; it was a myth created by politicians and pacifists at the time and afterwards to explain why they failed to prevent (or in the case of Austria and Germany, aided and abetted) the outbreak of the war.\n\n&gt; It actually existed.\n\nAnd he continues to plug his ears.\n\n&gt;&gt; Besides WWI of course\n\n&gt; World War 1 was not massively popular. It was heavily protested. Half the war supporters in the US wanted to side with Germany.\n\n[citation needed] \n\n&gt;&gt; You claim that this was because of generals spamming men into machine guns and barbed wire. You have clearly read NOTHING, repeat, NOTHING on the military history of the war that has been published since at least THE 1980s\n\n&gt; Watching movies and reading primary sources about generals spamming soldiers into the enemy cannot be undone by people writing how it didn't happen.\n\nHe's citing movies...over academic sources..\n\nI'm done.

        "text": "As a former Knoxville resident, I can attest that we are usually happy to see any mention of our city in the media at all.  Unfortunately, one of our claims to fame, the Simpsons episode \"Bart on the Road\" (Season 7, episode 20) is mistaken about the history of one of our most notable monuments, the Sunsphere.\n\nKnoxville, as you probably don't know, is a city in the eastern portion of Tennessee that is known for its pair of giant orange balls, the [Women's Basketball Hall of Fame](http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Giant-Basketball-on-Womens-Basketball-Hall-of-Fame.jpg) and the aforementioned [Sunsphere](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5181/5609008485_28b1326474_b.jpg) (and also a college football team and rather nice national park, but that's not what we are here to talk about).\n\nIn \"Bart on the Road,\" using a faked driver's license Bart, Milhouse, Nelson, and Martin get a car and go on a road trip.  The decide to head to Knoxville to see the World's Fair, mentioned as housing a giant motorized Hungarian Rubik's cube (this is accurate-read about it [here](http://drknox.metropulse.com/2010/10/29/where_is_knoxvilles_ever-puzzl/)) and the Sunsphere.  \n\nOn the way in they pass a welcome to Tennessee sign, with the motto \"Tennesseein' is Tennebelievin'\", although unfortunately the actual welcome signs just say \"Tennessee Welcomes You\".  Shortly afterward we are provided with an [overhead view](http://imgur.com/GWol9P8) of the World's Fair Park circa 1996.  While I have to admit the image captures the general \"feel\" of the place in the mid 90's (kind of run-down and scruffy), it's an inaccurate description once you get into the details.   For comparison, [here's](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/ilz0rk8wivdap1qly8ox.jpg) a map from the fair's heyday, and here's a [more recent picture](http://www.lightfinds.us/images/large/KnoxvilleAerial_2011Nov06_PaulHassell-25-L.jpg).  Note that the Sunsphere has never been out by itself, instead it's adjacent to buildings and a large bridge.  There's also no sign of the [Tennessee Amphitheater](http://worldsfairpark.org/worlds-fair-amphitheater.html), one of the few World's Fair buildings to still be in use in 1996.  Also I can personally attest that the water was inexplicably dyed a dark greenish blue at the time.  The oddly sloped building adjacent to the water in the Simpsons image is the US pavilion, which was demolished in 1991.  It would have not been present in 1996 when Bart came to visit.\n\nBart &amp; co.  then meet a man standing in front of a wig shop. He tells them the World's fair ended in 1982, 14 years before their visit.  This is correct.  In fact, the Knoxville World's Fair was the last successful fair held in the USA (a fair two years later in New Orleans was the last fair in the USA, but declared bankruptcy midway through and suffered low attendance).  Knoxville's fair netted a total of only [$57](http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB298EEC7336255&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM) in profit, but managed to attract 11 million visitors, an excellent showing.  Unfortunately, after the fair was over, the park largely fell into disrepair until it was finally fixed up in the 00's.\n\nAnd now we come to the bad Wig history.  Because the Sunsphere was never called the Wigsphere, and never housed any wigs (aside from any that might have been worn by visitors).  It also never fell over thanks to to a rock thrown by Nelson, obviously.  During the fair, the Sunsphere housed an observation deck and restaurant.  It was occasionally mooted through the 80's and 90's as a potential office space or restaurant, but continued to be mostly vacant, and there was no wig shop in the area nearby it.  In the late 90's the observation deck level was re-opened, still with the displays from the original fair.  The other levels were unused and closed off (but, ah, not very _securely_ closed off) and were definitely empty of wigs or much of anything else.  In the late 00's and early 10's the place was finally remodeled and now hosts an [observation deck and bar/lounge](http://www.worldsfairpark.org/worlds-fair-sunsphere.html). \n\nLater in the episode, Lisa states that Knoxville is adjacent to Oak Ridge Tennessee, \"birthplace of the nuclear bomb\", and points it out on a wall map.  The bombs weren't actually _assembled_ in Oak Ridge, but the uranium and plutonium used for them [was refined there](http://www.atomicheritage.org/location/oak-ridge-tn).  So if not the birthplace, it was probably the gestation place for the atomic bomb (The story of Oak Ridge's secret city is a pretty interesting read).  Oak Ridge didn't contain any nuclear _power_ plants, and most of the nuclear production facilities were closed by 1996, but it probably still reasonably counts as a \"nuclear site\", explaining why it is on Homer's map.  Incidentally, the location Lisa points to on the map is accurate for Oak Ridge, but the map is missing markers for several nuclear power plant sites in TN.  \n\nSo in conclusion, the Sunsphere was never full of anything as exciting or interesting as wigs in the mid 90's.",

        "text": "Let's take a trip back to 1976, as well as to 1979, 1985, 1933, the spring of '25, some unknown point in the past, and some point in the future.  In other words, it's time to take a look at the song \"Highwayman\", written by Jimmy Webb in 1976.\n\nAlthough released on his own album *El Mirage* in 1977, and later by Glen Campbell in 1979 on *Highwayman*, it rose to prominence when released as a single by the supergroup The Highwaymen in 1985.  Consisting of a motley collection of Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, and Kris Kristofferson, this would be the initial single by the group that took their name from the song.\n\nFor Cash and Kristofferson, it was a chance to make an impact on the music charts that hadn't been too kind to them recently.  Cash was over a decade past his heyday; except for the novelty \"One Piece At A Time\" and a remake of the legendary \"(Ghost) Riders in the Sky\", he hadn't made an impact in the charts since his 1971 album *Any Old Wind That Blows*.  Kristofferson's last album was released four years prior and produced no songs that charted at all, continuing a line of duds for him.  His prime years, like Cash's, had been in the early 1970s.  *Jesus Was a Capricorn*, released in November 1972, had topped the charts and achieved Gold certification; since then there had been nothing of note.\n\nNelson and Jennings, on the other hand, were riding a wave of success at the time.  In the preceding decade, Nelson had 10 #1 singles plus 11 more than cracked the top 10.  Jennings had 9 #1 singles and 12 more in the top 10.  Although all four men were born within five years of each other, the supergroup would represent an odd fusion of two performers at the top and two who were thought to be well past their musical prime.\n\nAll they needed was a hit song that fit perfectly...\n\nEnter Webb's \"Highwayman\".  [Four verses, four stories](https://play.google.com/music/preview/Tazwz6zeqddoshnmpel75syw3na?lyrics=1&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=search&amp;utm_campaign=lyrics&amp;pcampaignid=kp-lyrics).  No chorus at all, just four verses that each told the story of someone who had lived, met their end, and yet was still around in a different form.  And since it was 1985, an [overwrought music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFkcAH-m9W0) would have to accompany it.\n\nWillie Nelson led off as the highwayman, a real unpleasant fellow who pillaged the stagecoach roads and met his end when \"the bastards hung me in the spring of '25\".  This was a most logical choice; although Nelson's distinctive voice didn't sound like that of a feared bandit, it did sound like someone whose run of success would draw a casual listener in to hear the rest of the song.\n\nKristofferson was up next, as a sailor born upon the tide.  But despite his lifetime of experience on the sea, he too would perish when \"the yards broke off (and) they said that I got killed\".  Worth noting is that the written lyric says that this particular individual \"sailed a schooner 'round the Horn to Mexico\", while the line actually in the song is \"'round the Horn of Mexico\".\n\nAnd then we reach Waylon Jennings, the hapless dam builder.  At \"A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado, I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below\".  Hoover Dam was originally known as Boulder Dam, which is in fact on the Colorado.  The naming controversy is a side story in itself, and it wasn't until 1947 (a decade after completion) that it became officially, 100% known as Hoover Dam.\n\nAnyway, so the character played by Jennings fell into the wet concrete below.  And worse than that, \"They buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound\".  That's gotta be a terrible fate...working on the great Hoover/Boulder Dam, then slipping and falling into wet concrete and being entombed there.\n\nOfficially speaking, 96 people died during the construction of the great dam.  According to the [United States Bureau of Reclamation](http://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/history/essays/fatal.html), [1931 alone](http://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/history/essays/fat1931.html) saw sixteen men die from heat-related episodes, two from drowning, seven from blasting operations, six from falling rocks or rock slides, three from other accidents, and eleven from natural causes.  Combined with two men who drowned while surveying the land nine and ten years prior, 47 would die before the end of the first year of construction.  However, none of these were from accidents involving concrete.\n\n[1932](http://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/history/essays/fat1932.html) would see deaths continue.  Two men drowned, two died in blasting accidents, five died from falling rock or rock slides, five died from falling from canyon walls, six were struck by heavy equipment, four died in truck accidents, and three filed under \"miscellaneous\" (two electrocutions, and one who was crushed).  Still nothing involving concrete.\n\nFast forward to [1933](http://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/history/essays/fat1933.html).  Seven men would die in accidental falls, three in explosions, one would be electrocuted, five would be \"struck by falling material\", and six would be struck by trucks or heavy equipment.  Two stand out, however.  Under \"accidental falls\", July 19 shows that a John M. Nelson died at a place listed as \"concrete form\".  And under \"struck by falling material\", we see a W.A. Jameson who is listed as having died in a slide of concrete and debris in the center of the dam slot.\n\n[1934](http://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/history/essays/fat1934.html) would be no more kind to the workers; six more would die in falls, two more electrocuted, one would die in an elevator accident, seven would be struck by machinery or falling equipment, and four more would be struck by falling material.\n\n[1935](http://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/history/essays/fat1935.html) was the last year of construction on the great dam.  But before it was completed, four more men would die in accidental falls, one in a cableway accident, and six from being struck by various things that one would generally not like to be struck with.\n\nDue to issues with the way that the data is compiled, the \"official\" death toll is either 96 or 100, or 112, 138, or 213, or any of a number of others.  But there's really only one thing that needs cleared up: Did Waylon Jennings provide the voice for someone who died by slipping and falling into wet concrete?  And if so, was he buried there?  Or is the line ambiguous enough to mean something else?\n\nAnd this takes us back first to Kristofferson's sailor, where the line sung is different from the official written lyric.  With Jennings' dam builder, there is no such ambiguity: the line sung is the same as the one written.  \"Fell *into* the wet concrete below\".  Did it happen?\n\nJohn Nelson died July 19 1933 by falling onto or into a concrete form.  Because building a dam of this size was unheard of, the Bureau of Reclamation's engineers decided to be conservative.  Wet concrete can generate an incredible amount of heat, so it was decided that the concrete forms and the resulting blocks would be small.  This would allow them to be poured, cured (a three-day process), and then packed along the perimeter to create a solid structure.  Imagine, if you will, a cinder block wall.  Take cinder blocks, pack the gaps in between them, and voila!  A heavy stable wall.  The same idea was used for Hoover.  Use the concrete forms to create individual blocks, cure them, arrange them, and pack the gaps between them after they're laid.  Mr. Nelson may have fallen onto a curing concrete block, which goes with neither Webb's lyric nor Jennings' line.  Or perhaps he fell *into* the concrete as it was poured.\n\nBut there's a problem with that.  This is an enormous concrete structure, and things like \"stability\" and \"structural integrity\" aren't merely suggestions.  A body is nowhere near as dense or stable as cured concrete and would have significantly weakened the concrete that it ended up in.  The best case scenario would be for it to be completely encased within the concrete, and when the curing concrete shrank it would have a smaller air pocket around the body.  But this would still weaken the concrete dramatically, and since engineers and workers were watching this specific process closely, it seems unlikely that Nelson is the one that Jennings references.  Nelson's place of death is simply listed as \"concrete form\"; it's also possible that he fell and died in the immediate vicinity of the concrete forms, and the place was listed as that simply to establish proximity.\n\nSo the only other one to have died in a concrete-related accident is W.A. Jameson, who is listed as \"struck by falling material\" in the form of wet concrete.  This seems a far cry from the lyric about slipping and falling into wet concrete.\n\nIn Joseph E. Stevens' book *Hoover Dam: An American Adventure*, the accident that caused Jameson's death is described.  An accident above caused over 100 tons of wet concrete to slid \"like a lava flow\".\n\n&gt;Jameson and W.H. Hammond happened to be walking through the slot on a scaffold, carrying an eighteen-foot timber on their shoulders, when the avalanche began.  Hammond heard the crashing, ripping sound, dropped the timber, and scrambled back just in time to see the concrete flash by, inches in front of his face.  A second later he was on his knees with a severely sprained back, peering over the edge of the shattered scaffold, his sense of relief dissolving into horror as he realized that Jameson had been swept to his death one hundred feet below\n&gt;\n&gt;After the rain of debris had subsided, searchers rushed to the bottom of the slot to retrieve the body...It was 3:30 in the morning when the digging began; at 7:30 the following night the shattered corpse of Jameson was finally recovered.  He was the only man ever buried in Hoover Dam, and he was interred for just sixteen hours.\n\nJameson is apparently the only person to have died in an accident involving wet concrete during construction of the dam.  But it came in an avalanche from above, not from slipping and falling into it as Webb (and Jennings) would have us believe.  And rather than being buried within the dam, his body was successfully extracted after sixteen hours of digging.  This would also refute the idea that the lyric could have referred to Nelson, as bodies, concrete, and structural integrity don't mix despite what Jimmy Webb may have us believe.\n\nAnd although he was temporarily buried there, Jameson's final resting place would be [in his hometown of Rock Hill, SC](https://web.archive.org/web/20130325193547/http://nsla.nevadaculture.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=663&amp;Itemid=418).\n\n**tl;dr - Jimmy Webb is a liar, and Waylon Jennings his accomplice** \n\nBonus!  In the video, Johnny Cash's starship captain appears to be flying a Northop F-5.  With a maximum speed of 1,060 MPH and a maximum fuel capacity of 677 gallons (plus a possibility of another 825 gallons in external tanks), it seems unlikely that he could explore the universe at all, let alone reach the other side.",

        "text": "*Scéal na Gaeilge* was a two part documentary on Ireland's Irish language public service broadcaster, TG4 (I'm using the past tense here because the entire program is no longer available online, so we'll have to work with fragments of youtube clipst). The program's subject was the history of the Irish language, and its intended audience was no doubt a younger demographic judging by its [weird animations](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/LmcFKD3bBgs/maxresdefault.jpg) and constant pop-culture references. Being a historian of early medieval Ireland and an enthusiast of the Irish language, I was naturally drawn to the program and watched it despite the gross animation, and was totally shocked at the incredible amount of bad history included in the show's script! \n\nLet's start with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcbpjjbrG5Y) clip at the introduction to the show. For those of you who do not speak Irish (YES IT'S IRISH NOT 'GAELIC' STOP THAT SHIT AMERICA), our dear host speaks about Ireland's first human inhabitants. Standing in front of Newgrange, he asks: \"Cén teanga a raibh siad?\" - which language did they speak, these people who built the dolmens and Dún Aonghasa? [Could it have been Irish, or a kind of Irish???](http://i.imgur.com/Bc88W01.gif) Though this video ends there, the host is dead serious about his question; the show continues, in true Ancient Aliens fashion, to posit that it *could be possible* that the very first humans to arrive on Ireland spoke the Irish language, citing the *Lebor Gabála Érenn* (an early medieval mythical cycle about the waves of invasion of Ireland by pagan gods and supernatural beings until humanity's arrival) as evidence. This is of course DEAD WRONG. Ireland was first inhabited some 9000 years ago during the Mesolithic by hunter-gatherers, who were then displaced by neolithic farmers who built those fancy megalithic structures shown before. The Celtic language from which Irish derived only came to Ireland during the Iron Age, some 6500 years after the island's initial human colonization. \n\n[This clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmcFKD3bBgs) implies that the early medieval Irish colonized Scotland \"with the bible in one hand and the sword in the other\", starting the eternal conflict between the Irish and English languages. The premise is naturally absurd and even absurder because the chronology is completely wrong. The Irish began colonizing parts of western Scotland (or Pictland), Wales and Cornwall BEFORE their conversion to Christianity, and this colonization was probably the reason why the Irish were so receptive of Patrick's evangelization - there were already Christians in Ireland, probably because of their contact with the Christian Britons! \n\nSecondly, the Irish and newly arrived Angles and Saxons never conflicted in Britain (though annals record Saxons making viking-like raids in Ireland itself), the two being on opposite sides of the island. There is no evidence of some epic and immortal enmity between the two peoples in early medieval sources; especially after their conversion to Christianity, the Saxons were viewed neutrally as just another neighbouring people who could be allied with or made war on. Nationalism wasn't a thing in the middle ages so we can't expect historical peoples to have viewed foreign neighbours as anything different than neighbours of their own culture and language. Interestingly, Saxon kings were important enough that their deeds and deaths were recorded in Irish annals, especially in the Annals of Ulster which contains 54 references to them before 1200, with entries like this for their most illustrious rulers:\n\n&gt;U 939.6: Athelstan, king of the Saxons, pillar of the dignity of the western world, died an untroubled death.\n\nSo claiming that the Irish hated the English since the early middle ages is bullshit. What's also bullshit is the video's claim that Irish Christians spread their faith by the sword. Irish missionaries did not ride into battle like the conquistadors of the New World; they instead set up monastic settlements at places like Lindisfarne as bases for a peaceful campaign of evangelization and joined efforts with the Gregorian mission which began earlier, in 596. It's a boring history, [*but it's historically accurate*](https://cdn.pbrd.co/images/7onZeCh.gif).\n\nThose are the only clips I want to deal with, it's 10am and I don't wanna lapse into drinking before my seminar.\n",

        "text": "So, [this article](http://www.vox.com/2015/9/9/9275611/victorian-era-life) about reenactors  gone full smugness has been mentioned in one of the discussion threads already I believe but I really felt the need to return to it because of the view of history these people posit.\n\n\nI am not an expert on the Victorian Era and someone who is can probably make a lot more out of it than I can (besides noting the irony that people who want to live like in Victorian Times write about it on the internet) but one thing in it really caught my attention:\n\n\n&gt;There is a universe of difference between a book or magazine article about the Victorian era and one actually written in the period. Modern commentaries on the past can get appallingly like the game \"telephone\": One person misinterprets something, the next exaggerates it, a third twists it to serve an agenda, and so on. Going back to the original sources is the only way to learn the truth.\n\n\nThese two sentences not only discard basically all modern history scholarship en gros, they also constitute one of the most blatant examples of bad history, or rather bad historiography, I've recently seen.\n\n\nWhile most historians will agree that there is indeed a vast difference between books and articles written in the Victorian Era compared to books and articles written about the Victorian Era as well as that going back to the original sources is a good idea, the real problem here lies in the assertion that they are the only way to learn the \"truth\" resp. that there is such a thing as one \"truth\" when it comes to historical scholarship.\n\n\nThe search for the one and only historical truth, i.e. the \"how it really was\" as Ranke has written, stands in the beginning of - at least German - historical scholarship in the 19th century. It has been left behind for good reason. Modern historiography in the aftermath of post-modern philosophy, the cultural turn,  White's metahistory, and memory studies will agree that there is no such thing as one historical \"truth\". Beyond the basic facts (e.g. Queen Victoria ruled from June 20, 1837 to January 22, 1901), the sources we as historians have provide us with a narrative from a certain perspective (e.g. Engels' book The Condition of the Working Class describes Engels' perception of the lives of a portion of the English proletariat in 1845) and thus require critique and interpretation. To stay with the example of Engels: A person who was actually employed in Manchester in a factory at that point in time might describe his or her situation different from how Engels describes or draw different conclusions. Or a person writing about the conditions of the working class in another city might write differently about those. And all these taken together and interpreted can be fashioned into a narrative with explanatory intention and potential. Of course, how good your explanation and interpretation is will depend on the content and scientific-ness of it but that is why there are debates about certain subjects that can't just be resolved by taking a look at the primary sources.\n\n\nThat's why history is done by historians in an academic fashion and not by trying to live the lives of historical subjects to the smallest detail possible. This strive for authenticity does not necessitate accuracy or \"truth\". Living in Victorian clothes and with Victorian appliances doesn't make you Victorian, among others for the reason that nobody is able to unlearn modern discourse and recreate Victorian discourse that way.\n\n\n\"The past is a foreign country; they do things differently here\", as L.P. Hartley writes and Tony Judt confirms. And just like with foreign countries, adopting what you perceive as an authentic lifestyle is hardly enough to understand and fully grasp its culture etc.\n\n\nThat now we all now, what we knew before: Two hipsters in Washington state who pretend to live like it is 1880 have no idea about history.\n\n\nSources:\n\n\n- Appleby, Joyce, Lynn Hunt &amp; Margaret Jacob, Telling the Truth About History.\n\n- Spalding, Roger &amp; Christopher Parker, Historiography: An Introduction, 2008\n\n- Tosh, John.

        "text": "Amazing Grace is the amazingly mediocre film about William Wilberforce and the end of the slave trade by Britain. The film starts in 1796 before flashing back 15 years to 1782 during the debate over ending the american revolutionary war which establishes the duke of Clarence (future William IV) as an antagonist of Wilberforce. During a card game in the next scene Clarence, when he's running low on chips/money tries to add \"his ******\" to the pot causing Wilberforce to leave disgusted.\n\n\nDo you see the problem?\n\nBecause of the context clues of Parliament's debate there is no doubt we are on the British mainland in 1782 and a man is being held as a house slave. Somerset v Stewart decided by Lord Mansfield (who is the subject of a future badhistory post about the film Belle) in *1772* declared that slavery was not a part of English common law and thus absent a future act of Parliament any slave on English soil was a free man. Thus Clarence had no legal right to try and sell his slave/carriage driver to Wilberforce. \n\ntl;dr 1782 comes after 1772. \n\n\n\n\n&gt; The state of slavery is of such a nature that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political, but only by positive law, which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasions, and time itself from whence it was created, is erased from memory. It is so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it, but positive law. Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from the decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the black must be discharged\n\n\nfor simplicity's sake I decided just to use wikipedia as my main source instead of digging around for a book about the anti slavery movements to produce these basic dates. \n\n****************\nfirst badhistory post so any tips are appreciated.\n\nedit: title really should be \"Amazing Grace: how sweet the *sound of a* magical re institution of slavery in the UK post Somerset *that saved a wretch like me from film badhistory.\"* Mea culpa\n\nedit: i may be showing my lack of a full grasp of history of the slave trade in britain as the comments indicate.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3l1cqk/what_was_the_status_of_slaves_and_free_blacks_in/\n\nmy attempt to crowdsource a better answer",

        "text": "Guess who's back? Back again? Dux' is back; tell a friend!\n\nSubject of interest today, [this HistoryPorn thread from 5 months back.] (https://np.reddit.com/r/HistoryPorn/comments/2zt26p/trench_warfare_photo_taken_by_an_official_british/?)\n\nI should first note that the title of this post, and indeed much of the 'gist' of the argument, is drawn from *Britain's Two World Wars Against Germany: Myth, Memory, and the Distortions of Hindsight*, by British Military Historian Brian Bond. Cambridge University Press has some samples from the book on line, and for those interested, historian (and WWII veteran) John Grigg [wrote a similar article] (http://www.unz.org/Pub/Encounter-1990mar-00021), which is among Bond's sources. The book is also the topic of an excellent lecture given by Professor Bond, [brought to you courtesy of the Western Front Association.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UktHISqUsVc)\n\nNow as I'm sure that many of you are aware of, based on previous bad history posts (see Foch's 20 year truce quote and that execrable article from the Huffington Post), it's bad enough that people have a habit of lumping the two wars together, lazily, as a 'Thirty Years War'. Yet, when it comes to morality and the human experience in both conflicts, the two wars are overwhelmingly placed in two different categories: WWI is the futile, meaningless bloodbath, WWII is the crusade for democracy. Or, as British Military Historian John Bourne neatly sums up the British public view:\n\n&gt; The First World War was not really about anything, or not anything important; the Second World War was about national survival at home and the defeat of a vile tyranny abroad. The First World War was hopelessly mismanaged by incompetent generals ... compared with the Second World War generals who understood technology and fought wars of manoeuver that avoided heavy casualties.\n\nIt must be said emphatically that Bourne does not subscribe to this view, but is summing up briefly how your average Briton probably sees it. Based on the HistoryPorn thread in question, I'd say he's vindicated:\n\n&gt; For some reason WWI hits me a lot harder than WWII. The meaningless killings, people sent into the meatgrinder, the pictures of soldiers whose faces are torn apart by grenades. It was hell on earth.\n\nFollowed by:\n\n&gt; Me too...I'm a huge WW2 buff but I have trouble reading about WW1. They had basically the same weapons as WW2, but with the tactics from colonial times, resulting in just endless pointless slaughter. They invented machine guns, but just had armed men run at them, the same tactic dating back to the Mongol Invasion. It's just appalling and depressing to realize your species did this. There's no upside, no Liberation pictures, no bad guys like Hitler. Just people killing each other endlessly.\n\nAnd:\n\n&gt; Also, except maybe for the American troops, there was no real victory. Four years of butchery was capped with an armistice, and hindsight means we know another massive war is just around the corner (you know, after the most lethal pandemic of modern times coupled with desperate poverty for much of the world).\n\nFollowed up by:\n\n&gt; Honestly I wonder what the world would be like if the Germans would have managed to win in the first few years. No Nazi party, no tens of millions of deaths in two terrible wars and countless historical and cultural sites/artifacts saved.. I don't know about you but I would gladly trade for a slightly more German world if it would prevent those things.\n\nWhere to even start; with regards to meaningless, what defines 'meaning' for these people? The British were fighting to defend the Empire, whose security would be drastically undermined were the Central Powers, Imperial Germany in particular, to be victorious. The French had been invaded, and were faced with an enemy bent on their submission, who also happened to be parked on top of their major center of industry and coal/iron ore, as well as hundreds of thousands of French citizens. The Belgians were fighting to liberate their country, and soon so were the Serbs and Montenegrins. What about the Poles and the Czechs, or the peoples of the Baltic states in 1918? Heck, even the Germans, Austrians, Hungarians and Turks? So because modern sensibilities (or ignorance) can find no apparent meaning in these struggles, it invalidates them entirely?!\n\nAnd wasn't the Eastern Front in WWII a meatgrinder? How about the war on the Partisans in Yugoslavia? Wouldn't Normandy count as a meat grinder, considering casualty rates there were equal to if not slightly higher than at 3rd Ypres ('Passchendaele') in 1917? Or how about the fact that the death rate per division/division equivalents engaged per day was 99 in Normandy, compared to 113 on the Somme in 1916? What about the Hurtgen Forest, which American GIs called the 'Death Factory' and 'the Green Hell'? What about the Bulge, Okinawa and Guadalcanal, **the 2nd, 3rd and 5th deadliest battles in American History?**\n\nAs to 'running at machine guns', this is a cliché of the Great War that rarely, if ever, happened. Considering the Allied advances in the Balkans, northern Italy, and Belgium-Eastern France in 1918, I can assure you, there are in fact 'liberation pics'. \n\nAs to the world being better off under Germany, this is laughable. Despite Niall Ferguson's provocative statements in *The Pity of War*, the September Programme is **not** a blueprint for a 'European Union', it is a blueprint for German economic, military, and political hegemony on the continent. It envisioned the elimination of all continental threats to the Reich, Autarky to provide immunity from Blockade, and ultimately to allow Germany to challenge Britain for World Power status. As John Rohl sums it up (though I'd moderate the tone and qualify some assertions):\n\n&gt; The seizure of Antwerp and the Channel ports, the settlement of German veterans as farmers along the coast facing Dover, the reduction of France to a dependent satrap without an army and without coal, the entire continent from the Atlantic to the Black Sea, from Finland to Malta, united in a German Mitteleuropa, a ring of German satellite states from Estonia to the Caucasus, a railway line that was to stretch via Baghdad to Egypt and the Persian Gulf, agents on their way to revolutionize the world of Islam and ensure, as the Kaiser put it on 30 July 1914, that ‘England shall at least lose India’, German warships and U-boats in Brest and Bordeaux, Madeira, the Azores and the Cape Verde islands, the Belgian Congo in German hands—in such a world, proud Great Britain would have become an insignificant and impoverished island in the Atlantic. Far from being a ‘false war’, as Niall Ferguson has claimed, the First World War was, just like the Second, for Britain too a fight for life or death.\n\n**Continued**",

Lets pick a place and a Saturday and all go there. I have a few ideas already, but let's see what people who want to go think about it. \n\n- In Washington DC : \n\nOne of the Smithsonian museums. I'd say National Museum of American History, but there are some other semi-historical ones there but more focused as well. Natural History is also cool. ANd since they're free we could go to a lot of them. \n\nThe Mall and Memorials around it. Only problem with that is the Mall has been torn up and won't be back to normal till Next year. \n\n- Virginia \n\nManassas National Battlefield. First battle field of the Civil War. There might even be bad history present in the displays there. \n\nHarper's Ferry. Site of John Brown's raid. Also it's a nice little town and going late enough in September means the leaves will be turning so the drive there will look nice too. \n\nWilliamsburg. First capital of Virginia. Rather large site. Lots of 'Ye Olde iPhone Shoppee' as I remember. \n\nAlexandria. Lots of very old houses and yuppies. A nice place to walk, assuming you can find parking (assuming you need parking)\n\nJamestown. First permanent English settlement. I've actually never been there, so might be interesting. \n\nYorktown. Last major battle in the US war of independence. Also someplace I've never visited. \n\n - Maryland \n\nAntietam. Bloodiest single day battle of the Civil War. It was really interesting when I was there last, which was more than 20 years ago. \n\nBaltimore. So there's Fort McHenry (never been) and the Inner Harbor. The Inner Harbor doesn't seem to be so much historical as other places though.\n\nIn general I'm in favor of either Washington DC or someplace close to it. If anyone doesn't have a car or feel like driving they can always Metro/MARC/VRE(lol) to the District. Someplace like Manassas or Antietam means if you don't have a car you're sitting out no matter what. \n\nAnyhow opinions and interest in comments. K thx bye. ",

        "text": "This bleeds into current events but these statements by a former elected governor and two-time Presidential candidate are just so much awful bad history I can focus on that for a depression sandwich.\n\nThe two-fer Dred Scott bad history is:\n\n* [A comment last week about how Lincoln ignored the Dred Scott Decision in some analogy I'm too lazy to cross-post to badpolitics](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/27/mike-huckabee-conservatives-can-ignore-gay-marriag/)\n\n* [A comment on Thursday this week that the Dred Scott decision was still the law of the land](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/253292-huckabee-says-dred-scott-still-law-of-land)\n\n/r/badlegaladvice discusses the legal aspects of the latter link [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/badlegaladvice/comments/3kgp4g/huckabee_you_dont_have_to_follow_obergefell/).\n\nSo explanation I guess:\n\n* Lincoln the candidate (albeit during the Lincoln-Douglas debates for Senate) acknowledged and offered some very deep insights on the decision despite his disagreements:\n\n\n&gt; We believe, as much as Judge Douglas, (perhaps more) in obedience to, and respect for the judicial department of government. We think its decisions on Constitutional questions, when fully settled, should control, not only the particular cases decided, but the general policy of the country, subject to be disturbed only by amendments of the Constitution as provided in that instrument itself. More than this would be revolution. **But we think the Dred Scott decision is erroneous. We know the court that made it, has often over-ruled its own decisions, and we shall do what we can to have it to over-rule this. We offer no resistance to it.**\n\n&gt; Chief Justice Taney, in his opinion in the Dred Scott case, admits that the language of the Declaration is broad enough to include the whole human family, but he and Judge Douglas argue that the authors of that instrument did not intend to include negroes, by the fact that they did not at once, actually place them on an equality with the whites. Now this grave argument comes to just nothing at all, by the other fact, that they did not at once, or ever afterwards, actually place all white people on an equality with one or another. And this is the staple argument of both the Chief Justice and the Senator, for doing this obvious violence to the plain unmistakable language of the Declaration. I think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include all men, but they did not intend to declare all men equal in all respects. They did not mean to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity. They defined with tolerable distinctness, in what respects they did consider all men created equal-equal in “certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” This they said, and this meant. \n\n[Source](http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/speech-on-the-dred-scott-decision/) (The rest of the speech is actually a very good short read if you're interested.)\n\nTo give context to the latter statement by Huckabee, he is corrected by the host that the 13th Amendment repealed the Dred Scott decision.  (It was actually the 14th.)  The host, Michael Medved, also quotes from another of the Lincoln-Douglas debates: ‘*we must respect this decision as the will of the court but I think it was wrongly decided and now we must overcome it*.’\n\n* Lincoln the President did pass a law in June 1862 outlawing slavery in current and future US territories in contravention of the second part of the decision (Whether the government can pass a law similar to a previous one the Court has ruled unconstitutional is a whole 'nother legal thicket although Chief Justice Taney who had pushed the original decision through remained in his role with no opposition to either measure right up to his death in office in 1864.)\n* As his [famous quote](http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/greeley.htm) indicates, Lincoln's chief and initial goal was preservation of the Union not abolition.\n* ~~Slavery~~ The decision's implications was not legally dealt with in Confederate states until the Emancipation Proclamation and not in Union border states well after that in 1866 legislation followed by the 14th Amendment. (Edit: There were policies before 1863 where the Union Army might \"confiscate\" the slaves of a Confederate slaveowner but it was still not abolition.)\n* **The Dred Scott decision was formally overridden by a Constitutional Amendment; there is no part of it that is the law of the land in any shape or form**\n\nMost constitutional law and historical scholarship views the decision as a \"teachable moment\" in law or history nearly unanimous in condemning it but also echoing Lincoln's sentiments that it would be abided by (at least until circumstance of Civil War changed that).\n\nAnd yet the sad thing is that Huckabee could have been at least partially right if his statements were instead that:\n\n* Chief Justice Taney, who pushed through the Dred Scott Decision, *was* ignored by Lincoln over the suspension of *habeaus corpus* and died in office.\n\n* The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 which is somewhat related to Taney's comments about blacks having \"*no rights which the white man was bound to respect*.\" **was** ignored by private citizens and government officials in the North and West before the Civil War and obviously during.\n\nI've been lurking here for a while after posting more frequently last year but qualified individuals, regardless of ideology or whether their comment was off the cuff, should not get high school level points of American history this repeatedly wrong.  Even implying that the Dred Scott decision is some vestigial law like some unenforced local law about not being able to walk ducks on a leash after 1 PM is off the mark to say nothing of arguing it's still in force by the Supreme Court.\n\ntl;dr **When you read something on Wikipedia on your phone, scroll to the bottom or click on some keywords before you keep throwing it into a frigging conversation.**",

A variation, “Irish need not apply,” turned up at least 7 times, and there were other examples, from “No Irishman need apply” to “Irishmen need not apply,” to the simple, brutal “No Irish.”\n\nThey also gave an example of a [row of ads](http://imgur.com/sksivlk) showing the prevalence ads specifying which kind of volcano to worship or whatever.",

        "text": "[The article in question, with cesspit comments section to boot!] (http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/29/opinion/adam-hochschild-why-world-war-i-was-such-a-blood-bath.html?ref=opinion&amp;_r=2)\n\nThe article in question, written by *King Leopold's Ghost* author Adam Hochschild, is titled \"Colonial Folly, European Suicide: Why World War I Was Such a Blood Bath\". Drawing much of it's material from his (execrable) book *To End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion, 1914-1918*, he claims to have the answer to why WWI saw so much carnage and destruction. In short, **STUPID GENERALS ARE STUPID**. \n\n&gt; We think of the First World War as having its causes in Europe, where the greatest bloodshed and destruction would take place. But several of the **illusions** that propelled the major powers so swiftly into war had their roots in far corners of the world.\n\nThe idea that these 'illusions' lead to mass slaughter, and that these 'illusions' were as widespread and dominant as Mr. Hochschild would have the reader believe is, as shall be seen, tenuous at best.\n\n&gt; The biggest illusion, of course, was that victory would be quick and easy. “You will be home,” Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany told his troops, “before the leaves have fallen from the trees.” The German campaign plan called for knocking France out of the war in 42 days. The Allies were not quite so arrogant, but were confident of triumph in months, not years.\n\nThe first 'illusion' that he touches on is the old canard that Europeans young and old were drinking the 'short war' koolaid, hence the Kaiser's 'before the leaves fall' comment and the 'Schlieffen Plan'. I've answered questions about this before on AskHistorians, such as [here] (https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3jpuv5/is_there_any_evidence_at_all_that_anyone_involved/) and [here] (https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/3bl50d/was_there_any_way_that_europeans_in_1914_could/). Hew Strachan covers the issue in *The First World War, Volume One: To Arms!*, and Holger Herwig and Stuart Hallifax have written articles about it referring to the German and British cases specifically (should be on Google). Opinions, surprise surprise, varied over how long a war might last. Discussions in London, Berlin, Paris, St. Petersburg and Vienna indicated a war might be as long as 1-3, even 4 years, or when time limits were not given, talk of a 'People's war' or a 'world war' was had, implying a difficult struggle ahead. The Schlieffen Plan itself only referred to a war with France, and even then there was scepticism over whether or not it would 'land a knock out blow'. After that, if Russia didn't withdraw and knowing the abysmal state of the Austro-Hungarian forces even before the war, a war as long as a year was definitely on the table, especially if Britain was involved. \n\n&gt; A second illusion of those who marched proudly into battle in 1914 was that they would be shooting at the enemy, but that he would not be shooting back, or at least not effectively.\n\nWhy they believed the enemy 'wouldn't shoot back' (spoiler: this was not a belief) is explained as follows:\n\n&gt; How else to explain that most soldiers on both sides had no metal helmets?\n\nHelmets are not designed to protect against aimed rifle fire, although they can protect at long ranges and against ricochet. The three main helmets of WWI, the French 'Adrian', the British 'Brodie Hat' and the German *stahlhelm*, of which the former two were fully in service by the end of 1915 and well before the *stahlhelm* (débuting at Verdun in February 1916), were all designed to protect against shrapnel and shell fragments, which they did.\n\n&gt; And that millions of French infantrymen, as well as the Austro-Hungarian cavalry, wore combat uniforms of brilliant red and blue?\n\nWhile some military conservatism was at work here, the presence of these uniforms had more to do with budgetary constraints preventing the French and AH armies from modernizing their uniforms. Hochschild also neglects to note that the *Bleu Horizon* camouflage uniform had already been ordered as a replacement by the French in 1914, but was delayed until 1915. But, clearly, things like 'facts' shouldn't get in the way of a 'good story'. &lt;insert sarcasm here&gt;\n\n&gt; As the war began, troops from both sides advanced over open ground en masse, as if they were not facing repeating rifles and machine guns: bayonet charges by the French, and ranks of young Germans walking, arms linked, toward astonished British soldiers.\n\nAs the war began, most armies had been trained and indoctrinated (where doctrine existed) based on the lessons of the Franco-Prussian War. This emphasized fighting in loose order, closer to skirmishers in the Napoleonic Wars, and utilizing their artillery, rifle fire, and ultimately machine guns, to attain 'fire superiority' over the enemy. Bayonet charges, and training, were largely to induce the soldiers to press their advantage in battle and 'close for the kill'. Desperate bayonet charges by the French, although they did take place during the Battles of the Frontiers in August, were just that: desperate. Undertaken by units whose officers had been killed and injured, faced by German units that **had** attained fire superiority, they are treated here as standard practice because screw context, right?\n\nThe 'Germans marching in lock step' myth comes largely from the uncritical reading of unreliable, first hand British accounts of the First Battle of Ypres. This uncritical reading is, sadly or perhaps inevitably, a common flaw in *To End All Wars*.\n\n&gt; The British would make plenty of similar suicidal advances of their own in the years ahead\n\nHochschild covers one such 'suicidal charge', the First Day of the Somme, in his book, which lends some of his account to Joe Saco's depiction in *The Great War: July 1st, 1916, The First Day of the Battle of the Somme*. For this Shill for Big Tommy's take on those events, see [here] (https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/32t8bn/world_war_i_question_largescale_offensives_like/) and [here] (https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3bx08q/the_disastrous_battle_of_the_somme_or_when_i/)\n\n**To Be Continued**",

The eight hour day was first advocated by socialist Robert Owen in 1817 with the famous slogan \"Eight hours' labour, Eight hours' recreation, Eight hours' rest.\" The eight hour day was adopted by some companies before Ford was born. It became more popular in the years prior to Ford's policy. The United Mine Workers won an eight hour day in 1898 and the Adamson Act of 1916 gave railroad workers the 8 hour day in order to prevent a nation-wide strike. Ford's move certainly influenced business policy, but the 8/40 standard wasn't standardized until the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.\n\nEdit: Included text of meme:\n\n&gt;Unions did not create...\n\n&gt;*Weekends\n\n&gt;*8-hour work days\n\n&gt;*A \"living wage\" (Doubled worker's pay from $2.34/hr to $5/hr\n\n&gt;*Five day, 40 hour work weeks\n\n&gt;Henry Ford did in 1926 to attract better workers from his competitors for his automobile plant.

        "text": "So [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/3jw1bl/time_humans_and_technology_the_fatal_error_of/) is just full of badhistory all around.  On the one hand we have OP, who is making a complaint I actually agree with: namely that the thousands of years of medevial stasis you see in a lot of fantasy novels is kind of silly.    The problem is that instead of framing it around the fact that societies inevitably change over time, he frames it as \"humans are on an inevitable march toward \"progress\" that looks a lot like modern society.\" mixed in with a lot of technorapturism\n\n&gt;In less than 2000 years since steel was in wide spread use in Meatspace, humans are landing constructs on other planets without using magic, and exploring them. Humans are unraveling the base properties of the universe and manipulating them using beams of particles moving effectively at light speed. Humans have walked on the surface of an object in the void. Humans have invited machine telepathy, which allows me to share this message with all who attune to this 'channel'. Our best experts predict that by 2060 we will hit the tech point of being able to create artificial intelligence that is more intelligent than we are. I will live long enough to see the creation of synthetic life. I will see our species create a new form of life. Without any magic. At all.\n\nAs other people point out in the thread, though, just because the modern world is approaching things from a sort of industrial/scientific revolution point of view, doesn't mean that's inevitably going to happen with any group of people in any particular timespan.  I mean humans were around for quite a while before we invented spaceflight and digital watches and cat videos on youtube.  You could write a multi-thousand year epic in China or Italy or Egypt or wherever based entirely on real-life history and never include anything similar, if you picked the right timespan.  \n\nBut the people arguing against him fall hard into the trap of \"nothing whatsoever happened during the middle ages\".  Like these comments\n\n&gt;The dark ages are a prime example of nothing happening for a long period of time. Nothing changed. Europe did not advance technologically. It wasn't until the Crusades and the influx of ancient Roman and Greek and Middle Eastern ideas that Europe got chugging again. In fact there are still civilizations in Indonesia and the Amazon rain forest that have not advanced for thousand of years. Today, and you can find articles all over the internet about them.\n\nand\n\n&gt;For the first million years, humans made no technological progress. They made very little for the next ten thousand. \n\nThings were still happening in both of these time periods.  (Western) Europe was improving or importing all sorts of technologies during the post Roman period, though other things did fall out of use for some time (particularly the sorts of things that were needed by large centralized states).  And almost all we know about the periods from 1 million to 10000 years ago are technological changes in the form of tools we find left behind--granted it was slow change, but it was change.  Humans began using aquatic resources and _fire_, and moved out of Africa.  In the 10,000 years after that they perfected numerous types of agriculture and metalworking, building, etc.  \n\n",

Throughout the game you can find pieces of [totem poles](http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/until-dawn/4/40/Totem_list.png) as well as a couple examples of the full size version. The game describes them as native artifacts but there is a problem with that. The game is set in the Rocky Mountains of western Alberta. In fact they specifically name the setting as Cree territory. But the Cree did not make totem poles. Such works were exclusively a style of the coastal peoples of the northwest like the Haida, the Tlingit, and the Kwakwaka'wakw. Indeed you can see that the [Cree artstyle](https://www.google.ca/search?q=cree+art&amp;hl=en-CA&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=705&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMI0IrkmIjjxwIVQjKICh2dUAHR) is rather distinct from the style of the totem poles. Totems are believed to have originated as carved support poles for the massive western style longhouses built buy the coastal first nations. Structures that would have been uncommon among the western Cree. The point is the game shows these poles hundreds of kilometres from where they should be, and built by people who never historically made totem poles.\nSources\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totem_pole",

        "text": "https://np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/3jssgo/black_friend_just_sent_me_this_picture_with_the/cusbp36?context=1\n\nAs the title suggests, I'm going to ignore the squabbling about the symbolism of the flag, largely because it's part of the moratorium, but also because I'm personally tired of it.\n\n&gt;Follow the money, the people most willing to do away with slavery were coincidentally the people profiting from it the least. The people least willing to do away with the scourge of slavery were the people profiting from it the most.\n\nNot bad history, more of a \"No shit!\" scenario. Of course, others were directly or indirectly 'profiting' from slavery, yet still held anti-slavery views.\n\n&gt;It's hard to give the north credit for ending slavery when they had far, far less to lose economically from its abolishment.\n\nAlso not so much bad history as just bad reasoning. Why on earth does that make it more difficult to credit the Northern abolitionist/anti-slavery factions?\n\n&gt; To say \"the South were traitors\" ignores that it was--granted, horrifically--just doing what human beings have been predictably doing since the beginning of time, which is protecting their own way of life...\n\n...via committing treason, which is constitutionally defined as making war against the United States (or aiding those making war against the United States).\n\n&gt;but emancipation was political expediency, not a humanitarian act for humanity's sake.\n\nI'm not sure if he's specifically referring to emancipation, but given the context it seems to be that he's referring to abolitionism in general, using 'emancipation' and 'abolition' interchangeably. In which case, what? So we're going to erase all the humanitarian pleas made by both abolitionists and anti-slavery advocates alike? How does one even go about reading John Brown's speech, made in response to his conviction, as a non-humanitarian political argument:\n\n&gt;&gt;I see a book kissed here which I suppose to be the Bible, or at least the New Testament. That teaches me that all things whatsoever I would that men should do to me, I should do even so to them. It teaches me, further, to \"remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them.\" I endeavored to act up to that instruction. I say, I am yet too young to understand that God is any respecter of persons. I believe that to have interfered as I have done as I have always freely admitted I have done in behalf of His despised poor, was not wrong, but right. Now, if it is deemed necessary that I should forfeit my life for the furtherance of the ends of justice, and mingle my blood further with the blood of my children and with the blood of millions in this slave country whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel, and unjust enactments, I submit; so let it be done!\n\nThat and other statements made by him as well as others, such as William Lloyd Garrison, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and so many others... It makes no sense to reinterpret their countless philosophical and religious criticisms of slavery as somehow secondary to whatever political schemings they're supposed to have been up to.\n\nEven if he's referring to the specific policy of emancipation following Lincoln's order, then I don't see how it being of political or military expediency would somehow denigrate its significance, particularly considering Lincoln's long history of professing his personal hatred of slavery through moral appeals.\n\nThe rest of this person's argument is pretty much reducing the relevant to pithy clichés and arguing against common perceptions in pretty vague, pointless ways, so I'll skip over it.\n\n &gt;Whites were slaves too, not just blacks. It's funny how revisionist history leaves that out.\n\nUgh. I know we've been over this countless times, so this part shouldn't require much explanation. The simple truth is that the Irish were largely subjected to indentured servitude and, later, dangerous and backbreaking work for meager wages. It isn't mine or any reasonable person's intention to downplay the suffering that caused. However, these are fundamentally distinguishable from chattel slavery, which treated its victims as property and afforded them virtually no legal rights whatever, which can't be said of poor wage laborers or indentured servants.\n\n&gt;The equivalent of 6,000,000 Americans in 2015 died in the war. It was America's holocaust of its own men.\n\nI agree with the spirit of this person's comment, but to describe it as a \"holocaust of [the United States'] own men\" is a bit over the top as a comparison.\n\n&gt;Common misconception that the Civil War was mainly about slavery.\n\nNope. As has been explained here so many times, this is nonsense. Explanations can be found [in our wiki](https://np.reddit.com/r/badhistory/wiki/good_history#wiki_the_civil_war.2C_and_the_confederacy) or by simply searching this sub for 'civil war' in the top right corner.\n\nThis same person continues:\n\n&gt;Lets see, the South's tendency to prefer state rights over federal rights and the South's perception of unfair taxation? \n\nTaxation was not a listed grievance in the four declarations of immediate causes for secession, save for a brief mention in Georgia's (which still ties the issue to slavery). Moreover, the southern commitment to states' rights is true, albeit commonly misunderstood among Lost Causers and the like. It's disingenuous to translate \"states' rights\" to \"anti-federal,\" at least with respect to the Southern wing of the Democratic Party, to whom states' rights essentially meant protecting state institutions (mostly slavery) via the exercise of federal power if necessary. And as I've described here and elsewhere several times, even if we look back to the origin of this brand of states' rights rhetoric (going back to the 1820s and 1830s), it's still inseparable from the growing sectionalism caused by the slavery issue. One must keep in mind that this is the period of the Mißouri Compromise and the Nullification Crisis, which very clearly had much to do with slavery. The NC less relates to slavery at the surface, but the S. Carolina coastal elite did essentially exploit the 1828 tariff as a means of rallying the cotton planters behind their cause. Essentially, they saw the writing on the wall as slavery became increasingly geographically confined, and forced a crisis to address their growing concern. Calhoun himself viewed it as a necessary measure for keeping northern power in check; failing that, he indicated that southerners would be \"reduced to wretchedness\" by being stripped of their \"domestick institutions\" by \"colonization and other schemes.\" I'll look into finding this particular letter, as I know I've quoted it here before, but I know it and a better analysis of this crisis can be found both in Ellis' *Union at Risk* and Freehling's *Prelude to the Civil War*.\n\n[Edit^1]\n\nWe find out later on that this person wrote their argument while drunk, which isn't too surprising. That said, I wrote [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1mbgl0/what_historical_figure_has_the_most_undeserved/cc96uwc) while drunk. While embarrassingly combative and somewhat shallow in its analysis, I still managed to get things more or less correct *and* cite actual primary sources while getting my point across.\n\nSomeone else further down notes:\n\n&gt;Well, when the main difference (in most peoples' minds) between the two sides in the civil war was slavery - which is effectively racism\n\nAnother replies:\n\n&gt;it's not only the difference in people's minds, it was literally the cause of the war\n\nI don't see how that follows. Northerners were by and large racist, or believed in the inferiority of non-white races and that this should manifest in law. Granted, there was a lot more diversity than that. For one, Lincoln made several appeals to the racial inferiority of blacks, while in 1859 is reported to have made statements indicating he would be permissive of interracial marriage (reportedly: \"If a white man wants to marry a negro woman, let him do it—if the negro woman can stand it\") and made numerous appeals to the principle outlined in the Dec. of Ind. that \"all men are created equal.\" Certain abolitionists believed in total equality, others did believed in legal but not social equality. However, the principal division of opinion leading up to the war was whether slavery was to be confined geographically, permitted in new territories, or forcibly expanded. The war wasn't fought over whether it's ok to be a racist, unless your source is Michael Scott.\n\nAnd that's about all there is of the bad history, the rest seems to be flag stuff.\n\n1. Calhoun's statement, with some analysis, can also be found [here.](https://books.google.com/books?id=rRUBAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=calhoun+%22colonization+and+other+schemes%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Mnz-WJXXfE&amp;sig=rEf3EegB2aySlHmvAHBRcc9T2p0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAGoVChMI-6n974rjxwIVQT0-Ch2a_gjz#v=onepage&amp;q=calhoun%20%22colonization%20and%20other%20schemes%22&amp;f=false)",

        "text": "[Link to the book's amazon](http://www.amazon.com/The-Sistine-Secrets-Michelangelos-Forbidden/dp/006146905X)\n\nSo I strode into my local city's library today. It's a familiar place that I know well. Teenage Asian girls mob the teen center on the first floor, that Same Homeless Guy has his usual seat on the second floor with his 15-year old laptop and his trusty 2-liter bottle of what is, if the label is to be believed, Pepsi. Old people suck up the bandwidth streaming their HDTV shows, young people don't put their fucking books back, and I return to here to study as I usually do-- which is to say I'm going to stare blankly at my Computer Algorithms book for a few minutes before setting it aside and ganking some noob feeders in League with 300 ping while Mr. Caldwell over here sucks up all of the internets watching eight straight episodes of House of Cards in 2160p/120fps.\n\nBut today, something was different. Something was... off. Peeking just slightly further off the row of bookshelfs, a stripe of red and black caught my eye today. It was a book. A black book, with red lettering. Dark, insidious, Satan visited me to compel me to pick it up and read it. *Come,* it whispered. *Open my pages and I shall teach you all I know and you will know Good and Evil.*\n\nI reached for the book involuntarily. \n\n*\"The Sistine Secrets: Michelangelo's Forbidden Messages in the Heart of the Vatican\"*\n\nMay God help us all. I dove in.\n\n**The SISTINE SECRETS: MICHELANGELO'S FORBIDDEN MESSAGES in the HEART of the VATICAN**\n\n*Written by Benjamin \"heh i'm a ribbai\" Blech and Roy \"Sign Language Extraordiner, Playwright Phenomenor, Art History Destroyer\" Doliner*\n\n**The Book Jacket**\n\n&gt;\"*The Sistine Secrets* tell the fascinating story of how Michelangelo embedded messages of brotherhood, tolerance, and freethinking in his painting to encourage \"fellow travellers\" to challenge the repressive Roman Catholic Church at the time.\"\n\nYou know it's bad when I haven't even opened up the book yet and already this is starting to sound like a cross between bad Assassin's Creed fanfiction and Dan \"Fuck History, Yo\" Brown. \n\n\n**Chapter One: Why the floor makes the Sistine Chapel a secret Jewilluminati headquarters even before Michelangelo made it so**\n\nThere is too much damn truth in here for me to dictate, so let me summarize the first few \"flows\" of logic, if you're feeling generous enough to call them that. I and the rest of the world would call these leaps so wide, they put Jesse Owens to shame. The general idea is that even the mosaics of the floors of many chapels at the time housed mystical and spiritual message along with their aesthetic beauty. They give the chapels an artistic flow, add movement to the religious space to guide the eye and let viewers the feel the living blessing that is God. \n\nAnd on top of all of that, all of these mosaic are actually mystic Jewish secret messages.\n\n\n\n&gt;Philo of Alexandria was a Jewish philosopher who lived from 25 BC to 50AD. He taught the Kabbalah, the mystical Jewish traditions that surround the Torah.\n\n\n.\n\n\n&gt;Philo lived in Alexandria.\n\n\n.\n\n\n&gt;There is a mosaic decorum known as Cosmatesque, a typical medieval decorative stonework popularized by a Roman family know as the Cosmati in the early 1200s. \n\n\n.\n\n&gt;It has a latin name known as Opus Alexandrium.\n\n\n.\n\n\n&gt;If you ignore the possibility that this style's name simply came from the city of Alexandria of which many buildings certainly housed the superset style of Opus Alexandrium, Opus Sectile, or that Pope Alexander VI might have simply popularized it and people later gave it his namesake, then obviously Alexandrium = Philo of Alexandria. \n\n\n.\n\n\n&gt; The Sistine Chapel's mosaic floor was sort of made in the Cosmatesque Style.\n\n\n.\n\n\n&gt; Jewilluminati confirmed.\n\n\nThis... this is their point number one. Try not to faint from the TRUTH flooding into your mind right now, because here comes knowledge blast, Point Two:\n\n\n&gt;Cosmatesque ocassionally uses circles, triangles, fours and lines. \n\n.\n\n&gt;The Kabbalah also uses circles, triangles, fours and lines. Or in their own words:\n\n\n&gt;\"Within Cosmatesque is a wide array of mystical symbols (lol): Spheres of the Tree of Life (circles), the pathways of the soul (lines), the four layers of the Universe (2spoopy) and the triangles of Philo of Alexandra (fucking lol)\"\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Jewilluminati con-*fucking*-firmed, from the mouth of the instigators themselves.\n\n\n\nTherefore, according to our authors here, the only reasonable conclusion is that the purpose of the Sistine Chapel floor is not *only* to stop His Holiness and his assembled cardinals from plunging hundreds of miles to their fiery molten death at the earth's core, but also as a \"Kabbalitic Meditation Device\", because there once lived a Jewish Philosopher who lived in Alexandria a millenium and a half ago, and the Cosmati mosaic artists who originally designed the mosaics of their namesakes weren't original enough to come up with their own shapes and themes which the Jewish Kabbalah had already claimed, the taken shapes and themes being circles, triangles and the number four. Q.E.D.\n\nLet's see. What else is there? Oh, the floor has a couple of hexagrams. As in, one panel of hexgrams where the incense is burned. One panel of Stars of David.\n\n✡                ✡✡✡         ✡\n\n✡             ✡         ✡      ✡\n\ntoo spooky\n\n✡             ✡         ✡      ✡\n\n✡✡✡           ✡✡✡          ✡✡✡           \n\nMan, these guys are on a *roll* here, and this is only chapter 1! What else is there? Oh, so these guys are trying to say that the artists that Lorenzo di Medici sent to paint the Sistine Chapel wall fresco purposefully laid anti-papal messages within them as a backhanded insult in revenge for Pope Sixtus IV's involvement in the infamous Pazzi conspiracy, in which Lorenzo \"the Magnificant\" di Medici, the defacto ruler of Florence and his brother were targeted for assassination. Giuliano di Medici, Lorenzo's brother was killed, and on the conspirators side, an Archbishop who was tried to assist the coup was also killed in the ensuing attempt, sparking a two-year war between Florence and the Papal States.\n\nAnd what is the reason our super-author tag team give here for Pope Sixtus' rudeness to the Medici family? \n\n&gt;\"Sixtus wanted to seize control of freethinking Florence and its great wealth so that he could take over all of central Italy. (13)\"\n\nWhat the fucking fuck. Shameless crony, ~~sexual deviant~~ victim of completely unfounded propaganda (clearly) and poor statesman Sixtus IV may have been, but scheming universal conquerer he was not. Maybe these two confused Palatine Hill (as in, the pope on) with Palpatine (as in, Emperor of the Galactic Empire)? The names sound similar, I know, but the important thing to remember here is that the repressive leader of a widepread, insidious empire whose hill he lived on is spelled with one less P, while Emperor Palpatine was made up by George Lucas.\n\nAlso, I love this implication that Pope Sidious here wanted to crush the free-thinking Florentines because of their ideological deviancy, being freethinking proto-jewish-atheists no doubt, never mind that this is the same Florence that twenty years later would transform into a virtual theocracy under the leadership of the apocalyptic prophet Savonarola, or that if these sneaky Vatican wanted money for ~~world~~ Italian conquest so badly they could have just leveraged their control over managing the alum mines, an essential dye for the very lucrative textiles indutry and the monopoly of which brought in staggering amounts of money, rather than conquering an entire city-state.\n\nOk, ok, but their other point is valid. There was no lost love between Florence (where after the Pazzi's assassination attempt, a pro-Medici lynch mob hung an Archbishop out a window) and the Papal States (who had helped the Pazzi family try to instigate a coup upon the Medici). So what are these snubs painted by the Florentine artists sent to design the Sistine Chapel wall fresco, anyways?\n\n1) A dog.\n\nTheir first point is, Cosimo Rosselli, one of four artists sent to paint the frescos and one of three Florentines sent to do so, painted a dog in each of the panels he was assigned.\n \nI'm fucking done for today. My head hurts. Next time, Benjamin \"Rebbi, Rabbe, Rabbi\" Blech and Roy \"High Score is 278 in Bowlinger\" Doliner will be guiding us through their reasoning as to how Michelangelo spent his days in the Palazzo Medici learning  the secret pagan Jewish arts to become a Hebrew sorceror so he could hide the 5 pieces of Exodia underneath the *boun fresco* plaster until a worthy Duelist came to release their seals and defeat Zorc Necrophades. \n\nOr more likely, something even more ridiculous.

There is a lot wrong with this comment, so I'll mainly handle the specifically Roman aspects:\n\n&gt;You can thank the Romans for wiping out most of tribalism in Europe. What Caesar did to Gaul could really be called genocide, with some casualty estimates going into the millions.\n\nDid Rome in fact end tribalism in Europe? Tribal, as we all know, is a rather vague and generally unhelpful term, but I'll be charitable and interpret it as \"sub national identity tied operating *within* ethnicity bound and justified by familial ties\". It is a bit of a clunker but covers most of the bases in uses. So did the Romans smash tribalism in Europe?\n\nNo, of course. In fact, they formalized and solidified these identities by tying them to imperial administration and tax regimes. The identities of the Roman empire should be thought of in archepalegic terms: there was the overarching cultural and political identity of \"Roman\", but this was a privileged identity not fully granted to everyone. But the actual empire itself was made up of countless islands of other identities that were often formalized through administrative practice: in the east, these would usually be the *polis* identities (Athens, Sparta, Ephesus, etc). In the West these were usually tied to the *civitas* or \"community\", often translated as \"tribe\". So if you look at the inscriptions in Britain, you will see people who address themselves as \"Marcus of the *Dobunni*\" or \"Tiberius of the *Atrebates*\". These were the pre-Roman tribal affiliations and they survived in Roman administration. And, indeed, upon the collapse of Roman administration in Britain these identities reasserted themselves, or at least so goes [one interpretation of belt fitting designs](http://www.archaeology.co.uk/articles/features/britannia-a-failed-state.htm).\n\nI suppose I may as well deal with this:\n\n&gt;Even after the fall of the Roman Empire, tribalism didn't reassert itself because the barbarians that took over often just slotted into Roman institutions minus the emperor. The most successful successor states to Rome were those that copied the empire the best.\n\nTrue *to a point*. The successor states did indeed try to largely inhabit the old institutional structure of the empire (although not entirely--the \"Germanness\" of the German states is subject to reams of debate). However, they were largely unable to, increasingly less so as time went on. Roman administration, particularly in its late form, required an enormous tax base and an elite that was loyal, at least in practice, to the imperial center. There is a world of difference from the European elite of 400 CE and those of 600 CE. While the former, to settle a dispute, might forge a document or two to get their enemy executed, the latter was much more likely to raise a band of men to burn down their opponent's house. And so by the time you get to, sat, 1200 the elite in, say, Burgundy feel more Burgundian than French.\n\nNo all this sort of doesn't deal wit the fact that central point is kind of silly--why is it \"tribalism\" when a Sunni fights a Shia, but not when a Serbian fights a Croatian? Regardless, just so we all know, the central point of the post is silly and wrong, which probably means that the whole post is silly and wrong.\n\nI have limited internet so I can't do much follow up, but for sources:\n\nMartin Millet's *Romanization of Britain* for the first bit, Chris Whickam's *Inheritance of Rome* for the second bit.",

As it turns out the TIL post is referencing a 1916 petition by Nebraska residents asking for such an amendment as described by the post. I had not considered any non-official \"amendments\" that weren't actually put before the legislature/from a member of Congress.** Time to hang my head in shame. I hope you can all forgive me, the similarities between the two proposals was such that it seemed like someone had been misinterpreting and messed up the facts related to the Ludlow Amendment.\n\n~~So, I am sure we have all seen this claim thrown about across the internet since time immemorial. As a quick rundown, as the title claims, in 1916 a nameless amendment was put forth by a nameless person that would have required the population of the US to vote on whether or not the US should go to war (edit: and if they voted yes they would have to join the military). Simple as that.~~\n\n~~Rule 5 time! Only problem is, that statement is only partially true. By partially true I mean the only thing it gets right is that there was an amendment that kind of proposed this.~~\n\n~~Chiefly, while the proposed amendment would have put any declaration of war to a national referendum, it did not require those who voted yes to serve in the military. The general idea was that those who fought should have a say.~~\n\n~~Secondly, the amendment was not proposed in 1916. Instead, it was put forth a few times by Senator Louis Ludlow (D-Indiana, 1929-1949) from 1935-1940. As you can guess, the amendment was called the Ludlow Amendment.~~\n\n~~I won't comment on how sensible such a thing is because it isn't my job to editorialize and it really doesn't have a place when strictly speaking of historical fact vs. popular historical myth~~",

        "text": "[Part 1: Introductions and Lesser Carolina](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/3j6ia8/the_civil_war_shall_rise_again_part_1_of/)\n\n**Mississippi**\n\n[The MissIPeePee ordinance of secession](http://gen.1starnet.com/civilwar/msord.htm), like the ordinance from Lesser Carolina, is nice and also terrible. For one thing, it's conveniently short. You could read the whole thing while brushing your teeth if you wanted. It also gives zero reason for them wanting to secede. It's just seven paragraphs of \"we want to secede, we voted, we're seceding\". That's it. \n\nLater issued was the *[A Declaration of the Immediate Causes which Induce and Justify the Secession of the State of Mississippi from the Federal Union](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_missec.asp)*, which goes into their complaints. \n\nThe second paragraph is as follows, emphasis mine:\n\n&gt; **Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world.** Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin.\n\nI already feel like declaring this one a thorough check mark for the column of \"it was about slavery\", but that would be too easy, and I have a lot of time to kill. Also, holy shit is this amazingly insane. None but the black race can sustain the tropical climate? lolwut? Did the people behind this document seriously never realize that Native Americans and Hispanics live and work *in the same fucking climate* just fine? Also, it's interesting to see just how far back /r/panichistory can go, considering the author(s) of this document all but said \"banning slavery will destroy civilization\". \n\nMost of the rest of the document is essentially a series of bullet-points, with Bullet Point 1 saying that they will establish a grave threat to slavery has always existed. BP2 claims that there was a threat to slavery before the adoption of the Constitution. I assume this references what became known as the Three-Fifths Compromise, in which the North argued that non-voting non-citizen property should not be counted towards population totals for the purpose of Congressional seats, and the South argued that their material interest (to us this documents words) should be included because... reasons, I guess. Also, the Three-Fifths Compromise left the slave states with more of what they wanted than the Free States. \n\nThe bullet point then goes on to mention the Northwest Ordinance, which banned slavery in the Northwest Territory. I'm trying to only reference sources I physically have access to, and since I do not have physical access to a book that provides a good counter-argument, I'll let this slide and say \"yes, this was a slight against slavery\".\n\nBP3 is essentially complaining that when the Louisiana purchase was made, Congress voted to split the territory up in such a way as to maintain a balance of free and slave states. This strikes me as rather odd of them. This point seems, frankly, to be that any attempt made to balance slave and free states is automatically an attack against slavery. The weird counter-argument, I guess, would be that any attempt to maintain a balance between slave and free states is an attack against abolition? That's a weird train of logic.\n\nBoth of these points also seem to be missing a minor quibble: Slave states had to have voted in favor of these actions for them to have happened. A big thing with the way states were made from territories was to maintain a balance in Congress and Senate of free states and slave states, such that neither group could pass a law either strictly in favor or opposed to slavery. Which means that for things like the Northwest Ordinance to have happened, then congressmen from slave states had to have voted in favor of them. It's weird to say that there's some abolitionist conspiracy (as these points seem to be claiming) to ban slavery when people who own states are voting with them.\n\nBP4 says that Texas was \"dismembered\" and all of the territory acquired from Mexico was \"seized\". [There was a lot of territory that the Republic of Texas claimed, that didn't end in the State of Texas](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/09/Republic_of_Texas_labeled.svg/2000px-Republic_of_Texas_labeled.svg.png), but most of what they claimed wasn't there's to take, [being part of Mexico](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Mapa_Mexico_1836.PNG). In terms of what actually happened to Texas between statehood in Mexico to statehood in the US, is it got a lot bigger. \n\nFrom the Mexican-American War [the US gained what were or would become California (free), Texas (slave), the New Mexico territory (slave, became New Mexico and Arizona), and the Utah Territory (free, became Utah and Nevada)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War#Treaty_of_Guadalupe_Hidalgo). There were other bits in there too (some of the territory became Kansas and Oklahoma, for example), but the majority of the territory was split between slave and free states and territories. Notice how we're maintaining that whole balance? This, again, seems to be taking any attempt at balancing power as an attack on slavery.\n\nI have little idea what BP5 is talking about. On the high seas, I got nothing, and in the territories is flat out wrong, considering the New Mexico Territory was a slave territory. In *some* of the territories, sure. But again, that was about balancing power. Same with BP6, apparently *limiting* the number of slave states to match the number of free states is an attack against slavery. It's also interesting that they were concerned about lack of ability to expand, kind of a tacit admission of the argument I see every now and then that slavery was becoming a white elephant, only sustainable by the selling of slaves, and not by the actual return on their labor.\n\nBP8, about nullifying the Fugitive Slave Act is comical. As I mentioned in the post about Lesser Carolina, slave states were giving slaves their freedom, too, and the Dred Scott Decision prevented any more slaves from being freed by being in free states. This is a complete non-issue as far as I'm concerned\n\nBP9 and 10 I'm not sure about. It's been awhile since I've thoroughly studied the climate about slavery in free-states, but I'm pretty sure there was little actual desire for full social and political equality for blacks, which is what these points are claiming. I know the Quakers and John Brown certainly did, and I'm sure there were plenty of others too, but I'm pretty the popular sentiment was mostly opposed to full equality for blacks. Considering the stuff former slave states did to keep blacks from voting wasn't actually banned for almost a hundred years, it does seem like there was little interest in the antebellum to provide full legal rights to black Americans.\n\nBP11 can be essentially summed up as \"we don't like people in a democracy getting together to coordinate political action that we don't like\".\n\nBP13 is trying to wrap up everyone who agrees with abolition as agreeing with John Brown, and his raid on Harper's Ferry. I know there are some people who called him a glorious martyr, but there were others who said that his actions were insane, and another who called the raid foolhardy, referring to Harper's Ferry as a \"perfect steel trap\". There's also the very easy argument I could make that the British in the 1780's probably didn't have a very high opinion of Nathanael Greene\n\nBP14 and 15 suffer from \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\", because saying that the feds or free states have somehow threatened the security of the slave states is nonsense, same with any claim about ruining agriculture.\n\nBP16 and 17 are both rather paranoid comments about how the anti-slave sentiment is unrelenting and has \"unhallowed schemes\" to \"destroy the last expectation of living together\". An interesting discussion could be had about if it should be OK for a political demographic that is largely regionally bound and locked out of the political process is justified in seceding. You could, but that would be inappropriate. Before Lincolns 1861 election probably the only anti-slave President was John Quincy Adams, who was out of office in 1829. Thirty two years before Lincoln was president. Every in between (and most of the presidents before JQA) were either slave owners, or \"Doughfaces\", northerners who supported slavery. [The pro-slavery Democratic party had about 60% of Senate seats at the beginning of the 36th Congress and 36% of Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/36th_United_States_Congress#Party_summary). But if you include the Anti-Lecompton Democrats and the Independent Democrats, the numbers go to 42%. And this is while having the Opposition Party (about half of which were slave owners or joined the CSA) and the American Party have a number of seats. In the current US Congress, for comparison, the Senate is 46% Democrat and the House is 43% Democrat. The only reason the South/slave owners/the Democrats were locked out of the political process is because a good number of them decided to secede.\n\nEdit: Martin Van Buren had anti-slave sentiments, and voted in anti-slave ways before and after his term as President, but seemed to be mum during his actual term.\n\nBP12 is actually interesting: \n\n&gt; It seeks not to elevate or to support the slave, but to destroy his present condition without providing a better.\n\nIs this true? I'm having a hard time thinking of something that was proposed before the Civil War about what to do with freed slaves, which would have left them with no money, no housing, not transportation, and with the vast majority having no option other than start working the field for their former master, but without whips. I mean, getting rid of the whips is a hell of an improvement, but it would turn them from slaves to what would probably end up being a class of serfs. I don't know, it feels wrong to admit that a group of racist-even-for-their-times slave holders who decided to secede from the US and then invade US territory were right, but this does actually seem like a fairly valid criticism of abolitionists.\n\nRegardless, the jist is that MissIPeePee whole arguments were about slavery, and were badpolitics that don't seem firmly routed in the political reality of their time.",

Sykes-Picot probably wasn't the best idea in the world and the map lines were drawn pretty straight.  It's far far far from the worst possible partition of the former Ottoman territories, though.  **inline edit** My problem with this post (and any mention of Sykes-Picot as proof of regional destabilization) is that it's pretty clear second opinion bias.  I'm glad that people know enough history to be aware of the agreement but it's trotted out too often as a single point of failure.\n\nI'll be upfront and honest.  I have no books left on this subject so everything will be Wiki links or things I can find via Google that support my rantings.  This isn't going to be the most coherent post ever with bulletproof logic backed by plenty of sources since I've thrown it together during coffee breaks today.  I'm going to make plenty of assumptions based off of other knowledge with the goal of showing how much of a geopolitical/ethinc/whatever mess Iraq was.  I'm focusing on Iraq because it's a bit sexier due to the Safavids and also because trying to historically justify \"Syria\" on a map is pretty damned easy.\n\n**First, a map of the Ottoman provinces:**\nhttp://www.houshamadyan.org/uploads/pics/Mapa_osmanian_empire_22_02.jpg\n\n**Second, a table of provinces showing cities within the provinces:**\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_the_Ottoman_Empire#/media/File:Table_of_Ottoman_Administrative_Divisions_1905_%28Tableau_des_circonscriptions_administratives%29.png\n\n**Third, a map of Mosul, Baghdad, and Basra provinces superimposed on modern Iraqi borders:**\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/staticarchive/642484137f22ddb60524f0f5eb92017b22ffe23a.gif\n\n**Fourth, Mamluk Iraq:**\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ottoman_Iraq_%281900%29.svg\n\n**Fifth, Iraq ethno-religious groups:**\n\nhttp://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/images/iraq-ethnic-map2.jpg\n\n**Sixth, Iraqi Tribal Map:**\n\nhttp://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/images/tribes.jpg\n\nIf I had the inclination I'm sure I could do an overlay, but I don't.  I'm lazy and still irritated by years of this and you'll have to do it mentally.\n\nAccording to \"smart\" people the proper way to divide Iraq instead of by the Sykes-Picot \"arbitrary lines\" is by tribal and ethnic lines.  This is outline in the following article:\n\nhttp://www.globalresearch.ca/plans-for-redrawing-the-middle-east-the-project-for-a-new-middle-east/3882\n\n**TLDR of article:**  \"While the Middle East has far more problems than dysfunctional borders alone — from cultural stagnation through scandalous inequality to deadly religious extremism — the greatest taboo in striving to understand the region’s comprehensive failure isn’t Islam, but the awful-but-sacrosanct international boundaries worshipped by our own diplomats.\"\n\nThe problem is that the Middle East was a total shit show of everything in the early 20th century.  Nomadic tribes made up a decent bulk of the land area up until forced modernization occurred after WW1, when the whole concept of \"nation\" started to be important in the Middle East.  You know, the word that the Arabs spent a lot of time trying to figure out back when they suddenly stopped being controlled by an overarching Islamic temporal and spiritual authority (the Ottoman Empire) that had spent zero time and money on Arabs, instead focusing on Turkey.  If you want me to get into this I'll be more than happy to in comments, but for now I'll proceed under this assumption.\n\n(On forced agrarian settlement, see Page 3 of this article: http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/81928.pdf)\n\nYes, Iraq was split into three administrative provinces for ease of control.  The problem is that those provinces weren't based on ethnic boundries but commercial centers.  Back in the day there was this other empire in the area called the Safavids.  The Safavids had Shia Islam as their state religion while the Ottomans had Sunni Islam.  Conversion to Shia was mandatory in areas it could be enforced.  These two empires butted heads for a very very long time.  Safavid borders, at their max extended well into modern Iraq. Then the Afghans beat the pants off the Safavids, Ottomans capitalized on it.  By the time the Zand dynasty rolled around in 1750 our rough modern Iraq/Iran borders were in existance.\n\n**Reference Maps of Safavid Empire:**\n\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/The_maximum_extent_of_the_Safavid_Empire_under_Shah_Abbas_I.png\n\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Map_Safavid_persia.png\n\nWhat does all this mean about borders and how does it affect current Iraq?  Well for starters that was only in 1750.  250ish years ago, slightly more time than the US has been around.  More importantly for 150 of those years, the Ottomans really didn't care about the Mesopotamian backwater.  To give an idea of how much importance the Ottomans placed on Baghdad the 1885 Ottoman census gave population figures to a degree of accuracy ranging from \"approximite\" to \"merely conjectural\" (Wiki cite here, the original source specifies \"Arabia\" but I'm using it because I like the way it sounds.  Again, if you've got issues on my treatment of this subject and want me to spend more time on how exactly the Ottomans neglected non-Turkish areas that's another post.\n\nSadly, the majority of my post is a bunch of maps trying to show the absolute chaos of the region by any standards.  There were no clear cut deliniations within the region by geographic, tribal, cultural, religious, or anything.  Drawing straight lines on a map is about the only thing that could have been done to any degree of accuracy.  Benefit was that central control from Baghdad meant that no single \"province\" could (officially) dominate trade within the region.  Mosul (important because of pre-canal trade routes)/Baghdad (control of rivers)/Basra(control of port).  The Mamluk Iraqi Dynasty gave also gave a bit of credence to the concept that the three provinces could be centrally ruled from Baghdad since that was pretty recent.  All in all I'm sure they spent probably a day or two in briefings about how messed the region was, someone said \"I hate you all!\" while grabbing a ruler and just started drawing some lines so they could get out of the room.\n\nHind-sight and post-WW1 regional developments mean that there's a bunch of second guessing going on of how things should have been done coupled with anti-Imperialist leanings.  The European mandates got given up pretty quickly once the powers realized that it just wasn't worth the headache and really just filled a temporary power vacuum.  Yes, there was fighting involved, but the new Arab nations grabbed their future firmly with both hands to run with it as best they could (see: Pan-Arabism, Baathism.)  The down side is that it didn't work out the way they thought and is still in the process of working things out.  \n\n**TLDR; Western meddling hasn't helped the region but I'm not convinced (and neither should you be) that Sykes-Picot and European involvement was the silver bullet that killed hope for regional stability.**\n\nedit: forgot to np it, some formatting",

        "text": "Good evening. Please have a seat.\n\nAs you may have noticed it is no longer today, which means technically, it's tomorrow, and the moratorium against discussion of the US Civil War is no longer in affect (effect? I don't know, English is hard y'all). But enough referencing *MASH*, this is something I've been building up and building up in my mind for awhile now. I realize that a fabulous job has already been done of most of this, I just want to do a more thorough and crushing job of debunking the \"state's rights\" myth. My desire for writing this is twofold:\n\n1. Have a reference for myself, so that the next time some idiot tries to defend the Most Glorious and Honorable CSA, I have a handy way to tell them to go fuck themselves. \n\n2. Most of the actual arguments the confederates presented are nonsense, and I feel like pointing out how wrong they are.\n\n3. This really pisses me off, and this seemed like the best way to vent about my hatred of confederate apologists.\n\nThis is going to be a big project, where I'm going to pretty much just pick through each of the Ordinance's of Secession that each state issued, the CSA's actual constitution, speeches by Jefferson Davis and CSA Vice President Alexander Stephens, the Battle of Fort Sumter, slavery in the South, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the history of the \"Confederate Flag\" along with the \"part of our heritage\" nonsense, and whatever else comes to my mind about the US Civil War until I'm banned, this goes back on moratorium, or I get bored. Probably that third one, but my second reason for doing this seems like it might get me banned. We'll see.\n\nLet me start by mentioning that of the 11 states that seceded, they all issued some kind of ordinance of secession, but most of them don't give many reasons for seceding. Instead, four states (South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi and Texas) issued documents called \"Declarations of Causes\", that essentially amended their OoS to give reasons for their secession.\n\nAnd onto where it all began: South Carolina. Or, as I'll be calling it to amuse myself, Lesser Carolina.\n\n**Lesser Carolina**\n\nTheir official deceleration of secession, [An Ordinance to dissolve the Union between the State of South Carolina and other States](http://www.teachingushistory.org/lessons/Ordinance.htm) gives pretty much no justification for secession, just kind of saying \"we're doing it. We're doing the thing\". However, the state of Lesser Carolina later issued the [Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_scarsec.asp). Which, interestingly enough, lists some form of the word \"slave\" 18 times. \n\nParagraph 1:\n\n&gt; The people of the State of South Carolina, in Convention assembled, on the 26th day of April, A.D., 1852, declared that the frequent violations of the Constitution of the United States, by the Federal Government, and its encroachments upon the reserved rights of the States, fully justified this State in then withdrawing from the Federal Union; but in deference to the opinions and wishes of the other slaveholding States, she forbore at that time to exercise this right. Since that time, these encroachments have continued to increase, and further forbearance ceases to be a virtue.\n\nBasically \"The Feds have encroached upon our rights as a state, and we've held off because other slave states didn't want us to\". The first paragraph somewhat justifies the state's rights' argument, but it also specifically aligns Lesser Carolina's interests with slavery, and fails to mention *what* the Federal government did to encroach on state's rights.\n\nThe following 11 paragraphs are essentially a brief history of the US political history, from the US Declaration of Independence (zero references to slavery, btw), to the creation of the Articles of Confederate, to the creation and passing of the Constitution. \n\nParagraph 5 is of interest, ending with the line:\n\n&gt; ...in the first Article [of the Articles of Confederation] \"that each State retains its sovereignty, freedom and independence, and every power, jurisdiction and right which is not, by this Confederation, expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled.\"\n\nI'm not sure what the purpose of this line is, tbh. It seems like they just decided to reference a legal document as justification for secession, knowing that the legal document was no longer in any kind of effect. I've been told that there was a Supreme Court case where the AOC were used as some kind of reference (along with the Federalist Papers) to try to express the intent of the Founding Fathers, but I'm not sure if that's true or when it happened relative to secession. Either way, it's an odd thing to do.\n\nThe next 2 paragraphs are outlying their argument for why they believe secession is legal, namely that the Constitution is an opt-in thing, and that other states and the federal government have been violating the rights, and that they believe this gives them the right to secede. I could (hypothetically) get into whether or not they did have the legal right to secede, but that seems more like something for /r/badlegaladvice, especially I'm not a lawyer versed in 19th Century Constitutional Law.\n\nThe next paragraph (P15) is the first actual attempt to list what their complaints are, and is followed by two more (P16-17) that essentially echo the point:\n\n&gt; The Constitution of the United States, in its fourth Article, provides as follows: \"No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.\"\n\nOh hey, look, it's about slavery. \n\nThe next paragraph (P18) is kind of comical for reasons related to recent politics:\n\n&gt; The General Government, as the common agent, passed laws to carry into effect these stipulations of the States. For many years these laws were executed. But an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, and the laws of the General Government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution. The States of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa, have enacted laws which either nullify the Acts of Congress or render useless any attempt to execute them. In many of these States the fugitive is discharged from service or labor claimed, and in none of them has the State Government complied with the stipulation made in the Constitution. The State of New Jersey, at an early day, passed a law in conformity with her constitutional obligation; but the current of anti-slavery feeling has led her more recently to enact laws which render inoperative the remedies provided by her own law and by the laws of Congress. In the State of New York even the right of transit for a slave has been denied by her tribunals; and the States of Ohio and Iowa have refused to surrender to justice fugitives charged with murder, and with inciting servile insurrection in the State of Virginia. Thus the constituted compact has been deliberately broken and disregarded by the non-slaveholding States, and the consequence follows that South Carolina is released from her obligation.\n\nBasically \"We're seceding because the Constitution says we can have slaves, but non-slave states are refusing to return escaped slaves because those states don't allow slavery\". This seems like a reference to events like the *Dred Scott Decision*, where slaves brought into free states would sue for their freedom on the grounds that they could not be a slave there.\n\nThe background to the *Dred Scott Decision*, four years prior to secession, is that Dred Scott was born a slave in a slave state, and sold to an Army surgeon who was later stationed in slave-free Wisconsin. The owner of Dred Scott rented out Scott's labor (violating various state and federal laws restricting slavery in the territory), and later married Scott in an actual legal ceremony. The wedding ceremony is worth bringing up because slave weddings were not treated as having any legal authority, but Scott was married by a judge in an actual ceremony. When Scott's owner was stationed in Louisiana, this happened (to quote Wikipedia on the decision, source is [this article from the Chicago-Kent Law Review](http://scholarship.kentlaw.iit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3570&amp;context=cklawreview)):\n\n&gt; Before the end of the year, the Army reassigned Emerson to Fort Jesup in Louisiana. There Emerson married Eliza Irene Sanford in February 1838. Emerson sent for Scott and Harriet, who proceeded to Louisiana to serve their master and his wife. While en route to Louisiana, Scott's daughter Eliza was born on a steamboat underway along the Mississippi River between Illinois and what would become Iowa. Because Eliza was born in free territory, she was technically born as a free person under both federal and state laws. Upon entering Louisiana, the Scotts could have sued for their freedom, but did not. Finkelman suggests that in all likelihood, the Scotts would have been granted their freedom by a Louisiana court, as it had respected laws of free states that slaveholders forfeited their right to slaves if they brought them in for extended periods. This had been Louisiana state precedent for more than 20 years.\n\nAfter the death of Scott's owner, the Scott family was inherited by his widow, who rented out their labor for three years. In 1846 Scott attempted to purchase the freedom of his family, but his new owner refused. Scott then sued for freedom on the grounds that his and his wife's residence in free territories for a number years made them free, and that his daughter (being born in a free state) was born free. \n\nThe first decision (in 1847) was held in Missouri (a slave state), which had actually allowed a dozen slaves to be freed on the grounds that they had lived in slave free states (same source as above). Scott lost his case on the technicality that he couldn't prove he was, in fact, a slave. In 1850 a second attempt was made after a series of events delayed the trial. This time, the jury found in favor of the Scotts, after Scott was able to prove he was a slave. His owner appealed to the state Supreme Court (despite having moved to free-state Massachusetts), who found in favor of the widow. The court's decision was basically \"shut up slave, you should have done this while you were in a free state, instead of waiting 10 years\". Scott appealed to Federal Court, which upheld the Missouri Supreme Court's decision.\n\nNow, there were incidents of free-states granting freedom to slaves on the grounds that slavery is outlawed in the state, but the *Dred Scott Decision* made those court cases and laws null. Additionally, in 1859 (two years after *Dred Scott*) *Ableman v. Booth* concluded that state courts cannot issue rulings that contradict federal court interpretation of federal law. The *Ableman* ruling regarded (basically) Wisconsin not wanting to enforce the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850.\n\nAfter this point, I cannot find anything about states or federal governments allowing slaves that have lived in free-states to be free themselves.\n\nSo, it seems like Lesser Carolina's position didn't have any basis in reality at the time of secession. If they had tried to secede in the 1840s, they'd have had some kind of standing, but it seems like they really didn't.\n\nIt's also worth bringing up the hypocrisy of demanding state's rights to keep slaves, by attempting to subvert another state's rights to ban slavery. \n\nReturning to Lesser Carolina, P19 goes back to references to the Constitution. P20-P25 basically affirms that their issues with the other states are about slavery. The final two paragraphs (P26 and P27) are pretty much just \"and now we're leaving\". \n\nNotice how literally the only complaint Lesser Carolina has is \"We want our slaves, other states have been doing things that interfere with our 'right' to have slaves, and we believe that the new government is going to 'declare war' on slavery\". \n\nYes, they mention state's rights, but it's states rights to have slaves. Period. End of discussion. For Lesser Carolina, their *entire complaint* that they felt worth mentioning in their ordinance of secession is \"slavery\". The USDOI was basically a list of 27 different issues the colonies had with the British crown, but Lesser Carolina's was just \"we want slaves\".",

        "text": "I've been meaning to write this post for a while, but have always stopped myself. You see, it's one thing to affectionately look at things that I like but I know are light bad history, like Harry Potter or Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It's another to go digging into the story of someone I admire and realise that the story I was told is mostly a lie. I'm aware that's what studying history is about - learning about the past - but sometimes, I prefer the fantasy that I've been told. \n\nWhich brings me to Evita, one of my favourite movies, my favourite musical, and my always-cheer-me-up remedy. Because nothing gets me feeling like myself again quite like a fascist Cinderella story. \n\nExcept the problem is that Evita doesn't paint an entirely accurate picture of Eva Peron. In the small piles of biographies that focus on her rather than her husband, or the few articles that talk about the film, there are as many perspectives as there are words. She's a mystery, and one that everyone has their own bias about. Even her two autobiographies - one of which was probably ghost-written, the other dictated - paint different pictures of her life and her aspirations. The truth about Eva Peron is a tricky thing. But, however uncertain the truth about her is, it does seem abundantly clear that \"Evita\" is not the truth about Eva Peron. \n\nBut I should start. Perhaps [Antonio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CHdWDepZHI) will be so kind as to lead us off?\n\nThe most immediate problem with Evita as a musical is what it's based on. The 1976 concept album and later 1978 musical both used Mary Main's 1952 book \"The Woman with the Whip,\" a book which relied on anti-Peronist sources, and which, by the author's own admission, has been mostly debunked. The claims we're used to about Eva Peron - that she was money-grubbing, a whore, and only interested in sleeping her way to the top - come from this book, as do the accusations that the money from La Fundacion Eva Peron was funneled into secret Swiss bank accounts. It was a vicious, anti-Peronist book, and, understandably, it caught on and became the dominating narrative of Eva's life. Other books were published, but with the premier and success of the musical, those stories fell by the wayside, paling beside the story of this fascist seductress. \n\nIt doesn't help, either, when deciphering the truth about Eva Peron that so much of the story is impossible to know. As Joseph Page puts it, the sum total of the evidence we have for Eva's life is: \n\n&gt; a limited collection of primary and secondary sources: photographs and documentary film footage, one motion picture in its entirety and portions of another, texts and audio tapes of her speeches, a few letters written in her own hand, several books in her name, and a plethora of published and recorded testimonials by, or second-hand accounts attributed to, individuals who had or claimed they had personal contact with her.\n\nAs I said, it's difficult to get an accurate picture of her life. This doesn't mean people haven't tried, though. Page, for instance, is an excellent biographer of both Eva and Juan, and the Fraser-Navarro biography has also given a more rounded perspective. However, with all this research, what remains true is that the picture that's painted depends on what one accepts as valid and what's not. Is Eva's autobiography at all an accurate picture of her life? What about *Mi Mesaje?* Not to mention that all of this is not helped by an even greater lack of English-language sources. What the lack of information means, though, is that Evita remains the common idea of Eva Peron's life, and it's rather vicious in the picture it paints of her.\n\nSo who then was this Santa Evita? The film correctly states that she was the illegitimate child of Juan Duarte and his employee, Juana Ibarguren. Duarte had a total of five children with Ibarguren, something that was not at all uncommon for a wealthy planter in 1910s/1920s Argentina. Eva herself was born in 1919, the youngest child. Her father died when she was seven, and while the film would have you believe that even then she was a rebel, in actuality, she was a perfectly normal seven year old. What's more interesting is Ibarguren and her attitude towards life. The way the film portrays Eva's early life might be more accurately attributed to Ibarguren and her relationship with the world around her. For instance, while Ibarguren and her family were not supposed to be at Duarte's funeral, Ibarguren ensured that they did, and that they got to follow the funeral procession. Indeed, one explanation for how Eva ended up in Buenos Aires is that her mother decided that that was the place for her to be, and that she had a future there as an actress, rather than just in marrying a middle class fellow. However, Eva's life was thoroughly marked by her illegitimacy and the stain that conferred on her social standing, and she would continue to allow her perception of how she was viewed to inform her decisions, sometimes dramatically. The film includes none of this.\n\nHowever, I mentioned Eva going to Buenos Aires. In 1935, Eva went to Buenos Aires, though the exact circumstances of that aren't entirely clear. Andrew Lloyd Webber presents the idea that [Eva seduced tango singer, Augustin Magaldi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWLSychTU4Y), but this is unlikely for a few reasons, not the least of which is that it's not clear Magaldi was in Eva's town at the time she left for Buenos Aires. If Eva traveled with Magaldi - a fact biographers disagree on - then it was with his wife as well, and as a friend and assistant rather than an illicit mistress. The source of the idea that Eva was Magaldi's mistress comes from Jorge Luis Borges, who is also one of the primary sources of the idea that Eva then survived [through prostitution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuIG3fXC-HU) when she arrived in Buenos Aires. This is also completely untrue. Eva was the standard image of a starving actor - sleeping on friend's couching, bumming ramen out of the pantry, and skipping from one friend to the next so as not to annoy any one in particular in an effort to stay in all their good graces. Tango happened, though. Buenos Aires in the 1930s was a golden age for tango.\n\nEva got her first acting part in late 1935, and went on to be photographed for magazines. Here, she didn't push the boundaries of what was acceptable, showing enough skin to be sexy, but not too much. After her rise to power, her detractors would use these pictures to claim she was a whore, but once again, they were nothing uncommon. In 1937, she had her first radio drama and major film, and fan exposure increased. By 1943, she was a major star in Argentine radio dramas. She was climbing her way up the social ladder, but through skill and sheer luck rather than sexing it up with everyone. \n\nIn 1943, she met [Juan Peron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYWWcjWoG7A) at a benefit for victims of an earthquake in San Juan, and the two of them hit it off right away for a variety of reasons. Eva, of course, was highly charismatic and attractive, but more than that, both she and Peron shared the common background of being illegitimate children. Each wanted to stick it to society, and that desire to thumb noses likely informed Peron's decision to live with Eva. Equally, Eva did use Peron's influence to further her film career, using his influence over the Government Press Office to get herself larger and larger roles.\n\nHowever, it's inaccurate to say that Eva's ultimate goal was political power, or that she had been searching for a man like Peron. Throughout her childhood and youth, acting had been her primary interest, and was her reason for going to Buenos Aires in the first place. While I don't think she regretted getting involved in Argentine politics, that doesn't mean it was her ultimate goal. Indeed, the fact that she retained soap opera script writers as her speech writers is a testament to what she ultimately wanted - a chance to show herself to the world and gain legitimacy. \n\nIt's in 1944, though, that the most interesting ideas about her own political alignment begin. Peron, undeniably, had some sympathy for the Axis, having served as a military attache in Italy and having a huge admiration for Mussolini. Likely, some of this fascist sympathy was stuck to Eva as well, whether it was true or not. Once again, though, Eva's interest in politics prior to becoming first lady - and even afterwards - is questionable. \n\nFor instance, one key scene in the musical is the [October 17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQtpbqwR4Us) protest. What's interesting here is that both Peronists and anti-Peronists tell the same story, namely that Eva was heavily involved in pushing for Peron's presidency and securing Peron's release after his arrest by the government. In actuality, they're all wrong, but for different reasons. For the anti-Peronists, saying Eva was the driving force behind Peron belittled the man and portrayed Eva as a manipulative fox who would do anything for political power. For the Peronists, Eva's involvement was indicative of her devotion to Peron and the working class of Argentina. In actuality, the protest that secured Peron's release was the result of labour leaders rallying the people and getting them to protest. Eva had nothing to do with it. Even during Peron's presidential campaign, she stayed in the background. This might have partly been due to her ineptness at the niceties of high society. On the evening of Peron's inaugural dinner, for instance, she sat next to the cardinal of Buenos Aires with a dress that left one shoulder bare, a serious faux pas. \n\nI've emphasised so far that Eva had no real interest in politics, but that changed dramatically once Peron took office. Here the musical becomes more accurate in depicting Eva and her political clout. Enfranchisement for women, for example, became one of her key fights, with many of her speeches focusing on calling for women's rights. For the most part, however, she shared her husband's views, and helped him with day-to-day managerial duties in Argentina. However, once again, politics were not her ultimate goal - acceptance was. The film [states otherwise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IW6boyPEjg), but once again, that stain of illegitimacy stuck with her and informed her decisions. When Franco invited her to visit Spain, she saw it as an opportunity to be like the Argentine upper class and seized on it. This would be the [Rainbow Tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZ47jpn8YW4).\n\nBut let's pause here for a moment, because the Rainbow Tour offers a rare glimpse into Eva's views about her life and where she was in 1947. The film offers the unambiguous view that [Eva was in it for the political power and that she fell in love with Peron along the way.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06F7wOGEUcI) Her life, though, is a bit more interesting. In a letter published in *El ultimo Peron* by Esteban Peicovich written just before she leaves for Spain, Eva writes to Peron about how sad she is to leave him and how much she loves him. She makes clear her devotion to him and his cause. She also tells him to disregard rumours about her childhood, but doesn't specify what those rumours might be. Regardless, it's a telling insight into her feelings - she did love Peron, and she did still seek acceptance first and foremost. Politics and wealth were secondary considerations at best. If anything, she was incredibly insecure about her position, and felt that, like all material things, it was bound to slip away soon.\n\nRegardless of what Eva's intentions were when she set off, the Rainbow Tour was an incredible success, with her gaining international fame and much more domestic political clout. She once again rallied for women to gain the vote, and this time, it was granted. She became much more involved in Argentine politics, and in 1948, founded the Foundacion Eva Peron. Her detractors - [and Antonio Banderas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tpvxsJAZPk) - saw it as a front for more embezzlement from the government, but for Eva, it was a fulfilment of her promise to do her best for her descamisados. \n\nThroughout Peron's presidency, she had tried to maintain a good relationship with the working class, holding sessions where she would meet with workers to discuss issues and help as best she could. While this materialised partly in her resolving labour disputes, it also materialised in the great social charity that was the Eva Peron Foundation. \n\nIt's also worth considering what the relationship between Peron and Eva was at this point. As I said, she adored the man, but, unlike [the story the film tells](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYYyLBYAd8w), the question of whether or not he was reliant on her for his power is a very questionable one. Certainly she relied on him - and there are theories that this is partly why she fawned over him, but personally, I think that's too cynical - but if he relied on her is something else. Eva was very good at interacting with crowds and stirring people's passions, and certainly, it's partly thanks to her that Peron maintained good relations with the Argentine working class. However, Peron didn't need her to build those relationships in the first place. His connections would have been there regardless of whether or not he'd had Eva's help. It's likely that she did help, but whether she was the one who kept him where he was? Unlikely. \n\nIf anything, it's possible that Eva hurt Peron. Ignoring Peron's sexual proclivities - he had a thing for teenage girls both before and after Eva - Eva was extremely unpopular with the military and clergy, both of whom saw her as a dangerous outsider. Her illegitimacy, obviously, made a big difference to the clergy, as did her former work as an actress. The military, too, saw her as particularly repugnant, especially in the light of the 1951 elections. She wasn't trustworthy, and this undoubtedly had an impact on the stability of Peron's presidency. Indeed, the military's unrest after the 1951 election probably had a rather large impact on Peron's presidency.\n\nHowever, by 1951, Eva Peron was dying of uterine cancer. In the film, it looks like it came completely by surprise, but in fact, Eva had had health problems throughout her adult life, and was told in no uncertain terms that she would be fine if she had a hysterectomy. She refused, and died of cancer on 26 July, 1952. Many in the country mourned - some celebrated. \n\nBut the question remains - who was Santa Evita? Why all this sobbing hysterical sorrow? Quite simply, rather than the power mad succubus portrayed in the film, Eva Peron was just a girl in the right place at the perfect time. She found a gap, and she filled it. One thing we'll say for her, though - no one else could fill it like she could. \n\nSources!\n\n\"Mi Mensaje,\" Eva's deathbed autobiography, which has alternately been called a hoax and real.

        "text": "As context for this post, Wal Mart recently decided to stop selling AR-15 rifles, and the New York Times did an [editorial piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/opinion/walmart-decides-to-drop-sale-of-ar-15-assault-rifles.html?_r=0) about it. Said editorial begins with the following paragraph:\n\n&gt;A generation ago, the American gun industry came up with a devilish new campaign to bolster declining sales — militarizing the civilian firearms market with lightly adapted versions of potent battlefield weapons like the M-16 rifle. Renamed the AR-15, this semiautomatic assault rifle has come to haunt society in the hands of criminals and the deranged, who regularly kill innocent people in high-powered mass shootings.\n\nI don't want to get into the politics of gun control, nor will I discuss my own opinions on it. However, as a historian, I *would* like to point out the numerous problems with this retelling of the development and subsequent civilian sales of the AR-15 rifle.\n\nFirst of all, let's get the big one out of the way: calling the decision to sell ARs to the public \"devilish\" is a little obvious. It's not wrong to have a bias (in either journalism OR history IMO), but sort of just tossing out an adjective like devilish to describe a sales push without really backing up *why* you feel that way is a bit excessive. (Sure there's some discussion of modern mass shootings, but if you're discussing civilian sales \"a generation ago,\" I'm not sure that applies.)\n\nThat, however, is kind of forgivable, since this is an editorial and the author or authors are trying to prove a point. The bigger problem here, from a historical standpoint, is the claim that the AR-15 started life as the M16 military rifle and that civilian ownership spawned from this. In reality, the history of the AR is a bit more nuanced.\n\nNYT is technically correct in that the AR-15 was first marketed to militaries, including the United States military, but as CJ Chivers notes in his history of the AK-47 *the Gun*, which also traces the development of the AR platform, the M16 most certainly did not precede the AR-15, nor was the AR-15 \"adapted\" from the M16, as the NYT states. In fact, the complete opposite is true: the M16 adopted in 1963 is actually an adaptation of the AR-15. Compare the New York Times' assertion that the M16 was \"renamed the AR-15\" and sold to civilians with Chivers, who notes in *the Gun* that the AR-15 \"was renamed the M-16\" by the US military (page 292).\n\nSo the NYT is way off base by claiming that the AR-15 is a \"lightly adapted\" version of the M16. Actually the M16 is an adapted (and not lightly) version of the AR-15! But what about claims that the AR was a military weapon first and a weapon sold to civilians later?\n\nWell I'm sure you're shocked, but that's not quite the case either. While the AR-15 was marketed to militaries in the 50s, and even saw light service in East Asia (see *Military Small Arms of the 20th Century, 7th Edition* by Ian Hogg, page 291), the AR met a lot of resistance from old-school military leaders who didn't like its small chambering (again, Chivers discusses this at length in *the Gun,* specifically pages 276-292.) As a result, it did not see widespread usage or adoption until 1963 (as the M16). (Chivers, page 292). Civilian sales of the AR also began in 1963 - the same year. As [this](http://www.npr.org/2013/06/24/194228925/why-the-ar-15-is-more-than-just-a-gun) NPR article notes: \"AR-15 rifles were sold to the public as early as the 1960s.\" In fact, [here's](https://books.google.com/books?id=4CUDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA171&amp;dq=AR-15&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c4sjUce2BuHU0gHtyIDgCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) a Popular Science article from 1963 talking about the commercially available and civilian AR-15. While there's a grain of truth in what NYT is saying about marketing using the tag about it being a \"military style\" rifle, their implication that this was done as a sinister way to bolster poor sales seems questionable considering the Army had just bought a bunch of them and adopted it as the M16. In fact, the marketing of the times clearly seems to indicate that you should buy  this rifle *because* it was selling to the US military. That the rifle was released to civilians the same year it was adopted by the United States military would seem to lend credence to the idea of the two rifles being sold simultaneously, not, as NYT is insinuating, as a cynical sales tactic following poor sales of the weapon.\n\nOf course, it is possible that NYT is referring to slow sales of the AR-15 in the 80s, but since the AR-15 was clearly being marketed and sold in 1963, the idea that firearms manufacturers \"renamed\" the M16 and sold it as the AR-15 to boost sales during that era doesn't really hold water, since the AR-15 had already been on the civilian market for 20 years at that point. \n\nThere are more factual errors in the article, particularly in terms of the mechanics and terminology of firearms, but they don't fall under the umbrella of bad history and are R2-breaking, so I will not be discussing them. My main point with this post is not to start a thread about gun control but simply to detail how the NYT is perpetrating bad history in their analysis of the development of the AR-15 rifle and the history of civilian ownership of the weapon. (A lot of this stuff is on Wikipedia, so it wouldn't have been hard to check.) I can't say whether this is deliberate misrepresentation of history or simply bad fact-checking, but it is bad history any way you look at it.\n\nMain sources:\n\nThe Gun, C.J.

Here is the full text from the end of [chapter one.](http://www.scuc.txed.net/webpages/cbaker/files/chapter%201%20new%20world%20beginnings.pdf)\n\n&gt; The misdeeds of the Spanish in the New World obscured their substantial achievements and helped give birth to the “Black Legend.” This false concept held that the conquerors merely tortured and butchered the Indians (“killing for Christ”), stole their gold, infected them with smallpox, and left little but misery behind. The Spanish invaders did indeed kill, enslave, and infect countless natives, but they also erected a colossal empire, sprawling from California and Florida to Tierra del Fuego. They grafted their culture, laws, religion, and language onto a wide array of native societies, laying the foundations for a score of Spanish-speaking nations\n\nWhile I think the claim that creating a massive empire and injecting Spanish culture into native societies somehow doesn't actually contribute to the \"Black Legend\", that won't be our focus today. We going to focus on this description of the Spanish empire: \n\n&gt; they also erected a colossal empire, sprawling from California and Florida to Tierra del Fuego.\n\nYes, the text is correct about California and Florida, both of which were colonized by the Spanish. Tierra del Fuego, however, was not colonized by the Spanish at all. Yes, the region was explored during the 1520s by Magellan, but colonizers didn't not establish interest in the region until [they found gold in 1879](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tierra_del_Fuego_gold_rush), and by then, the colonizers were Chile and Argentina. Since Spain never colonized Tierra del Fuego, it is ridiculous to claim that their empire spread so far, and even the image on the [*very same page* recognizes that.](http://imgur.com/MCLuJsB) I guess saying the empire spread to Tierra del Fuego sounded cooler, but it gives an inaccurate representation of colonial power in southern South America.",

Their euphoric suggestions are wrong for several reasons and I hope I can begin to articulate them somewhat effectively,\n\n- Nobody suggests that Muhammad had prefabricated texts that he was bringing to his followers from time to time.  The most that has been argued (by actual academics, not armchair commentators) is that his thoughts were *inspired* by knowledge of Judeo-Christian teachings.\n\n- It is well known (regardless of whether you believe he was being inspired or not) that he would give these verses to his followers orally. Ready made written Arabic pages (of a uniquely Islamic form) for him to deliver to his followers piecemeal over 2 decades,, whaaaaa?\n\n- The discovery of the text itself is added evidence to the view that the Quran was written down very early on and is remarkably consistent with the modern canon (that's what was so darn kool about it) suggesting that the text may have been preserved as earnestly as Muslims claim (the article is fair enough to cite as much).\n\n- The texts found in particular (even I was able to read them directly when they first came out, even though Arabic writing was more [Abjad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad)y back then) are from the end of [Mary and Taha] (http://tanzil.net/#trans/en.sahih/19:77). These chapters in particular are clearly articulating teachings that deviate from Judeo-Christian thought. So not only did he have pre-fabricated texts, they were fine tuned for his new religious teachings?\n\n- Uthman (third Caliph) commissioned the final formal canonization of the Quran but AbuBakr (the first Caliph) had done it before him (although just a copy or two), and the Muslims before that were writing it down too so the text (only a couple of pages) being earlier than Uthman would just be a kool confirmation of the existing view (among both Historians and Muslims) and nothing new. There's nothing controversial about it being older than Uthman's reported Quran.\n\n- The quote being quoted from the article is itself quoted from Tom Holland, the guy who wrote a book called \"In the Shadow of the Sword\". You can imagine the [sensationalist angles and bad history] (http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/04/in-shadow-of-sword-tom-holland) he was doing when documenting the origins of Islam.\n\n- Another commenters suggestion that this is just early evidence (needing more work) and that the paper could well have been formed earlier than the current writing on it, is FAAAAAAR more reasonable than these guys' crackpot theories.\n\nYou might think I'm going into some bad-history myself but I'm sure we can agree that the basic idea these guys are euphorically upvoting DrBoomkin for is so ridiculous for so many reasons.",

        "text": "[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUmp67YDlHY&amp;feature=youtu.be) was on the front page a little while ago. It tells the story of a morbidly obese man flashing back through his life and remembering all the moments when he should have been more active. What I'm interested in, though, is [this moment](http://i.imgur.com/p8SVXzO.png) where he's rocking out to what I'm pretty sure is a video iPod in 1996. Either he's Dudley Dursley and is able to magically obtain technology, or he has a time machine, or the video is inaccurate. I'm going to go with the last option.\n\nThe development of iPods and the rise of mp3s over CDs as a preferred music medium is actually pretty interesting story. In 1994, CDs had exploded on to the market, giving people an easy way to access music that was less of a hassle than tapes, and more versatile. However, the way data was encoded to a CD left it vulnerable to being ripped, and by 1994, music was being ripped from CDs and reburned to be sold at flea markets and by other means, leading to huge leaks in unreleased music and popular albums. It was incredibly easy to do, and the record industry saw it as a serious threat to their profits. In an effort to stop the leaks and tamp down on copies, they strengthened security at CD manufacturing plants.\n\nOne man - Bennie Glover - worked at one of these plants in North Carolina. Initially, he smuggled CDs out of the factory and reburned them, but with the arrival of high speed internet in 1996, more possibilities became available. Aided by chatrooms, Glover found a market for ripped music files rather than CDs themselves. The development of mp3 as a file type that compressed audio to a manageable size, too, meant that music could be even more readily shared. In 1996, Compress Da Audio became the first dedicated music piracy group, and Glover became its primary source of files. \n\nIn 1998, Napster arrived on the scene as a one-stop source for music files. More importantly, Napster turned what had been a small problem for the music industry into a major one. Suddenly, music downloads weren't restricted to chatrooms, but rather, were accessible to everyone and their grandmother. Albums ceased to be marketable just on their lack of availability, and instead, became harder to sell given that the music was already available online. \n\nWhat this meant was that a huge number of mp3s were collected on people's computers as the files became more and more available. The market hadn't yet developed a way to access those files readily, and the record industry remained focused on trying to make CDs work by cracking down on smugglers and downloaders alike. In 2001, Napster was shut down, but by then, the floodgates had been opened, and other sites like Limewire and Kazaa quickly took its place. By 2003, record industry profits had fallen 15%, a testament to the effectiveness of mp3s, and the desire to have music on demand. \n\nIn 2001, Apple responded to the increased number of mp3s by releasing the iPod, a digital portable music player that could fit 1000 songs. It came in white and only worked with Macs. In 2002, Apple released a Windows-compatible iPod (once again, only in white), but it wasn't until the release of iTunes in 2003 that iPod sales really began to surge. The first black iPod (an iPod mini) became available in 2004, and the iPod in the video was released in 2005, at which point mp3 players had solidly cemented themselves as a more popular way of listening to music. Piracy had reformed the music industry. \n\nRegardless, though, the first black iPod wasn't available until 2004, and the clip in the video comes from 1996. There's simply no way the fellow could have been listening to a black iPod in 96, partly because they hadn't been developed, but also because demand for mp3 players wasn't anywhere close to what it would be even a decade later. The video tries to depict this fellow's life, but either he's hallucinating, or he lived a lie. A terrible musical lie.\n\nSources!\n\nDid you know Apple has an iPod timeline with pictures? [I like the pictures](https://www.apple.com/pr/products/ipodhistory/).\n\n[This](http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2015/07/06/witt-how-music-got-free) and [this](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/04/27/the-man-who-broke-the-music-business) are both fantastic articles about Glover and his impact on music piracy. I highly recommend reading about him if you're interested.\n\nAlso, what would you even put on an iPod in 1996? [These](http://www.bobborst.com/popculture/top-100-songs-of-the-year/?year=1996) were the top songs of 1996, and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiBYM6g8Tck) was the number one song of the year. *What was wrong with 1996?*",

        "text": "I've recently been re-reading the Harry Potter series for the first time since they came out. Everything was going swell, until I reached this *grievous error* on page 25 of Goblet of Fire.\n\nHarry is writing to Sirius Black about the goings-on at the house of his magic-racist relatives, the Dursleys, where Harry's obese cousin Dudley is cheating on his diet:\n\n&gt; *My Aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his room yesterday. They told him they'd have to cut his pocket money if he keeps doing it, so he got really angry and chucked his PlayStation out of the window.*\n\nNow, you might ask, what's the issue here? The problem is that there is no way Dudley could have had a PlayStation to chuck out the window, even if he had the proverbial \"uncle that works at ~~Nintendo~~ Sony\". \n\nAccording to the author herself, [Harry was born July 31, 1980](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Harry_Potter), which would place the beginning of Book 4 squarely in August of 1994. The first iteration of the PlayStation would not be released by Sony until [December 3rd of that year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console\\)), and even then it was only available in Japan. In fact, it wouldn't reach stores in the United Kingdom until over a year after the event Harry describes, on Semptember 29, 1995. \n\nClearly, J. K. Rowling did insufficient research on the history of mid-90's game console releases. Either that, or perhaps her description of Dudley Dursley as being a Muggle wasn't entirely true - since acquiring a device that wouldn't be available for months in Japan, and over a year in his own country, is nothing short of magic.",
