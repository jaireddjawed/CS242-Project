I know plenty of people go from having good, mutual conversations both people like, to becoming friends who reach out to each other, while plenty of others have similar connections and it carries no momentum for the other person to reach out or bring things up.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismTranslated/comments/117k1k6/restrictive_repetitive_behaviors_with_no_social/",
        "text": "  \n\nHi All,\n\nI’ve posted about this topic here before, so please forgive me.\n\nI’ve come to the conclusion that I have the restricted repetitive behaviors but not the social deficits. So with the RRB, you need two of them, and I’ve had all four throughout my life. But I don’t have the social symptoms. \n\nYou may say that I do have the social symptoms but mask them. I know that’s not the case because I understand social situations intuitively rather than analytically, and can intuitively produce appropriate, complex responses, particularly in situations where I don’t want to hurt someone’s feelings. I have always been someone to drop hints for fear of being too direct, and if anything, I think other people (allistic) should get the hints I’ve dropped when they don’t.\n\nThe thing is: the restrictive repetitive behaviors have affected me socially, and I have struggled with social isolation because of the RRBS including special interests, rather than social deficits themselves. I’ve never had a lack of social understanding. I do struggle socially because of lack of emotional regulation, but it’s not a matter of not knowing what to do. It’s that my emotions get the better of me. Most social “rules” make sense to me intuitively, like thanking someone when they give you a gift even if you don’t like it because it’s the thought that counts. If someone’s wrong about something, you always want to tell them what they were right about and if you must tell them they’re wrong (they will be making a decision based on it that will have an impact), you can do it in a nice way. “I always thought that it was X. Can you explain why it’s Z. I’m a bit confused” and hope maybe they’ll figure out they were wrong on their own, and make it look like you’re actually confused. Or if they don’t, “Hmm. Let me Google that” and find another source that proves them wrong that you can discover with them “together” (even if you knew they were wrong the whole time). But the Googling thing won’t work if it's something you should know more about than them, like if it’s what you’re studying in graduate school. Like if you said you’re studying astronomy and the other person asked, “Oh is that horroscopes” (confusing with astronomy), it wouldn’t make sense to say, “Oh really. I thought that was astrology but let me Google it” because if you’re studying it, you should know what it is and being confused is not believable. In this case, a more direct approach would be needed. But if it happened to me, I wouldn’t have to analyze all these things in my head and calculate them. It’s not like when someone is wrong, I have to think “Hmm. Is this a ‘let me Google that’ situation? Why or why not?” I instantly know what to do without even thinking about it. I also instantly can intuit that the more confident they are in their incorrect knowledge, the more gentle you should be in correcting them. But again, I’ve never had that realization until just now putting into words what I already knew intuitively. The only reason I’m analyzing it here in this post is because I just got on this train of thought and it’s interesting to analyze the social rules that I know intuitively and imagine other people who have to analyze these situations constantly. That’s how I know I’m not autistic.\n\nI’ve never been confused about talking to friends differently than you talk to teachers or bosses, or that you don’t answer the whole truth to “How are you”, common things I hear from autistic people. No one taught me those things. They’re obvious and intuitive.\n\nLet me give you a recent concrete example from a few days ago. I’ll disguise some details to protect my identity.\n\nImagine my mom usually makes pizza for me on Friday nights. The other day, she said she couldn’t do it because she was tired. I told her it was no problem. (At this point, an allistic person reading the story knows from the context that “the other day” must have been a Friday, whereas an autistic person might not. End of tangent). \n\nI decide to get my pizza at a restaurant, which I will drive to on Friday night. I say, “I’m going to get my work done early to anticipate delays with the pizza. You always have to fight through rush hour traffic on Friday evening.”\n\nMy mom responds, “Are you complaining?”\n\nI respond, “No. I actually enjoy being out and seeing all the cars on Friday afternoon. It makes me feel more connected to the community.”\n\nMy mom says, “No. Are you complaining that I’m not cooking you a pizza tonight?”\n\nI respond, “No.”\n\nAll of this was done completely intuitively. The only reason I analyzed it after the fact was because I’ve been obsessing about whether I have autism and thinking, “If I were autistic, I wouldn’t have been able to do that.\n\nDo what?\n\nI wanted to make it seem like I wasn’t upset about her not making the pizza? And what better way to do that than deliberately misinterpret ‘Are you complaining?’ to mean that I was complaining about rush hour traffic in general rather than her making me fight through traffic by not making the pizza and making me go to the restaurant instead? When I answer in a way that suggests I viewed her question as about something completely different than her not making pizza, it shows her that being upset at her for not making pizza is not even on my mind, which translates emphatically to ‘Not only am I not complaining about it; I’m not even thinking about it. In fact, it’s so far from my mind that when you asked me if I’m complaining about it, I didn’t even think that’s what you meant.”\n\nBut the key is: I did all the analysis AFTER I’d already pulled off the deception in an intuitive way. \n\nHave I convinced you all that I just didn’t “learn to mask so well that I don’t even know it”? That that’s not my experience? I don’t know. I am also “allistic” enough to know that while this post makes sense to me, it likely will not make sense to most others reading. That’s intuitive. I just know when something won’t make sense to people; I don’t have a list of characteristics in my head (longer than 5 personal anecdotes and people won’t get it, as a bad but workable example). Yet I post anyway in the hope that some people will understand.\n\nOCD (confidently self-diagnosed) explains the negative RRBs but not the special interests that make me feel good but are extremely socially unacceptable so I can’t share them freely. ADHD does not fit me either.\n\nI wish there were a condition for just the RRBs (restricted repetitive behaviors) because I identify so much with autistic people. I am just curious: Does anyone else experience this? Thank you.",

        "text": "Changes in routine of a friendship causes difficulty for someone with autism?\n\nI'm learning more and more about autism and I've recently learned that a change of routine in any part of your life can be a hard adjustment to make. I noticed that one of my friendships took a left turn when our routine changed. Routine such as talking everyday and then when she got in a relationship and took on a job, it dwindled down to once a week, to eventually once every 10 days. I've talked to other people about this and they said that talking to people less when you get in a relationship (because that's how the creation of the American nuclear family works) and when you work more (this is obvious to me now) does dwindle down the talking. I've read about autistic people having a hard time maintaining friendships too, specifically with neurotypicals. I wonder if my reason, not liking a change of routine, has been the same reason for other autistic people's friendships failing. Aside from feeling abandoned after our friendship changed, I simply just did not like the change. It aggravated me and made me uncomfortable. I tried the best to not show it though.I feel awful because she did try to reassure me that she was not abandoning me at first, though towards the end she admitted that she was avoiding me intentionally. There were some other things that seemed like a trait of autism that contributed to the failure of the relationship, for example one time around a few months after we stopped talking everyday and instead spoke every week or so, I would spam message simply out of excitement because I had so much to tell her and I wanted to spurt it all out. Us not seeing each other in person anymore or texting as much played a part in my excitement because I really began to miss her and wish that I could talk to her to tell her more things like life updates. She did admit that my spamming made her uneasy and for me to tone it down, it was hard because I didn't know how to turn down my excitement like that. Basically during the second half of our friendship when she admitted these things, I became a little distant and started to heavily mask. Simply not liking change, not reacting well to it, and then being too overwhelming when excited are a few things that contributed to our downfall. The last thing that I will mention, that I just learned about what special interests are and I now know what mine are. I notice now as I look back, that I would not shut up about my special interests and idk if she got annoyed about those things. My special interests consist of history (lives of dead writers and royals), the occult, and sociology. These were also things that I got excited about which kinda overwhelmed her. I don't have anyone who has autism to talk to so this is why I ask if your neurodivergence has also been a key factor in the detriment of your social life and close relationships. Especially when dealing with neurotypicals.",

And only because the school I went to had called in a counselor to screen me and she highly suggested my mom take me to the clinic she works with for further testing. Looking back I think she suspected I was autistic. But my family had a bad opinion of that clinic and instead took me to my mom's psychiatrist who ran her own private practice. At the first visit she saw me fidgeting a lot, unable to keep my hands still and told me to stop fidgeting so much and sit on my hands if I couldn't stop.\n\nNow I have a first grader and her school informed me that they feel much of her math/reading issues are more of an attention issue. She can't stay focused on one thing for more than 5 seconds at a time. She constantly has to be redirected back to her work. They want to have someone come in and sit in class with her to help keep her focused. She's being evaluated for speech therapy, something I went through for 7 years of my school life as well. And they mentioned her sound sensity, something She's had since she was a baby. I'm light and sound sensitive. They say she has strong signs if adhd and possibly something more.\n\nSo she will be evaluated on Monday. I can't help being emotional every time I think about it. I don't want her to struggle like I did, but I'm told she has a strong genetic disposition for it. \n\nTo protect her I will stick with my self-diagnosis and not inform those around me.

        "text": "I have been reading Unmasking Autism really slowly (for context, I am generally a fast reader and finish books in about 3 days) because literally everything Devon says is relatable to me.  I also have a nervous breakdown in grad school.  I also started questioning whether my \"ADHD\" was really undiagnosed autism.  \n\nIt has been about a month since I started the book (waiting to get it back from Libby), and I am realizing that I dissociated three times that I remember.\n\nOnce when I felt \"the need\" to get up and speak up in front of everyone, completely unplanned, to ask a question to the lecturer.  No one else was getting up to ask a question (the Q and A was over skype), and as perpetual people pleaser, I took it upon myself to represent everyone.\n\nHUGE MISTAKE!  I butchered it.  I hadn't memorized what I wanted to say.  Just word vomit!  And I am sure everyone noticed and cringed.  I hadn't talked to anyone about me being autistic that year, because like I said, I was just beginning to think about the possibility.  I was well brainwashed in my ADHD diagnosis too, so whenever anyone asked if I was okay, I just said I \"had ADHD\".  Thanks medical establishment.\n\nOne other similar situation.\n\nBut there was another situation that was completely different.  I was just sitting down with two classmates, both women, shooting the shit, and then one of them got REALLY angry and yelled at me about how I was treating my girlfriend.  They were all mutual friends, for context, and I was treating her badly.  A combination of heavy masking around her and too much drinking, etc.  I just froze in response.  I didn't really connect her yelling to how I was treating my girlfriend (now wife).  She was using vague language, \"men are pigs\", etc., but looking me dead in the eyes.\n\nFor context, I am fairly good at eye contact when I am calm.  Don't feel bad if you aren't.  This is an artifact of being raised believing that you have a completely different disorder than you in fact have.  \n\nAnyway, just dead cold eye contact and yelling over nowhere.  To be clear, she wasn't really yelling, because we were in the campus coffee shop.  But her elevation to anger was really abrupt and I wasn't ready for it.  I just froze.  And both of them got really embarrassed and jumped up and left.  \n\nTo be fair, I should have known not to sit down with them had I been thinking about what I was doing, because like I said, they were friends with my girlfriend.\n\nNow that I think about it, a little bit of empathy, admitting that I treated her wrong may have gone a long way to getting me out of dissociation.  That was all they really wanted from me, really.  Agreeing with them that what I had done, was doing, sucked, and what was I going to do about it.\n\nAnyway.  Dissociation sucks.  What do you do about it?  How do you get out of dissociation?\n\nThings I do\n\n* I try not to personalize the situation\n* I try to take the other person's point of view into account.  See things from their perspective.  This helps me build a bridge with this person, and it reminds me, that they aren't an enemy.  They aren't trying to hurt me.  They have feelings/boundaries I have crossed, and they are letting me know.  I don't need to shut down.\n* I close my eyes.  I may even start talking while my eyes are closed.  I will sometimes rub my temple at the same time, to calm the other person down/make it look less weird.  This gets me out of fight/flight mode because I can't see the other person.  By talking, I help calm down the other person.\n* I realize that freezing/dissociating is as scary for the other person as it is for me.  I try to remember that at the time.\n* Mini loving kindness meditation.  I pray/meditate for the other person's happiness.  This immediately stops me from thinking about them as an enemy or threat.  They are a real or potential friend.  We are just disagreeing about something.\n\nThanks",

Just don't tolerate negative thoughts, ever.  Don't tolerate negative thoughts about yourself, about other people, about your surroundings.\n\nJust don't complain and don't beat yourself up about anything.\n\nBecause honestly, especially as an autistic person, I can tell you that people respond to that hesitation, that negativity, far more than to the difficulty with social skills and functioning itself.\n\nSo if I eliminate that negativity, I can stop myself from dissociating, I can stop putting myself in that position, I can stop questioning everything everyone does.  I can stop beating myself up over the past, and even what is going on now.  The mistakes I made.\n\nIt seriously is a game changer!",

And I'm doing it without any emotional support from those around me. I'm mourning the loss of my mom, after coming out to her as both non-binary and autistic, she threw my vulnerabilities in my face yet again (it's a pattern) and I've made the difficult call to sever ties completely after years of consideration. \n\nSo yes. I'm feeling sorry for myself now. And I don't GAF who judges me for it. I've been working so hard to drag myself out of severe mental health collapse and it wasn't until I took autism self-assessments that I finally have an answer that makes sense for why nothing has helped the fundamental challenges I have.  I'm going to wallow in it for a while. I'm going to cry rivers and then bathe in the tears. I'm going to write sad and angry posts and I'm going to seek out others who get it and I'm not going to shut up because as soon as I do, it's going to eat me and I'm going to lose my life. I'm writing, venting, pounding walls and screaming into the void (figuratively) to save my life (literally). I don't want or expect pity or sympathy. I'm seeking understanding and mutual support. The only responses that matter are from those who know the trenches. \n\nAnd if you are going through the hard stuff too, and if anyone is telling you to just get over it, tell them to f*** off, because you aren't getting over it, you're going through it, and that's far more courageous and important and healing than going around it.",

        "text": "So in the near future I will go through an evaluation of autism and ADHD. However, I don't really feel like I fit either diagnosis, yet nothing else seems to fit more.\nHere are my main issues:\n\n* I'm sort of a perfectionist, but the perfectionism lacks a goal. I can only start many projects at certain times, like a certain day or hour. Straying won't cause panic or anxiety, but can be very uncomfortable.\nIt should be noted that I likely had undiagnosed OCD as a kid, so that may have something to do with it. However, the perfectionism and the current compulsions don't feel uncomfortable doing, it only feels that way when it doesn't turn out right.\nI also had tics when I was young, like clearing my throat or repeating words.\n\n* I pace a lot, usually as a result of being stimulated by a subject or when thinking. I only do this when I'm alone.\n\n* I love looking at pictures of people and may do so for multiple hours a day. Usually combined with listening to music and pacing. My yearbooks are completely destroyed lmao\n\n\n* I used to have sensory issues concerning noise and touch when I was young, but I have lost them almost completely now. However, when I'm at home and I try to eat with my family, it almost hurts physically to be there, mostly due to the talking. This doesn't seem to happen elsewhere though.\n\n* I no longer seem to have any real difficulties socialising, and I don't think I'm masking. I even feel that I'm quite good at socialising, even if I still struggle at making friends.\nWhen I was in my teens, however, I did have trouble making friends and acting like a normal person. I was very oblivious to the fact that I made people uncomfortable and often infodumped on people.\nI did okay-ish when I was a kid. I only had a few friends and usually had a peripheral role in relationships. I apparently didn't seek out friends in my early childhood and only talked about my interests.\n\n* My special interests aren't really that intense, but they can often be very specific and lack any real purpose, meaning that they're often useless in greater context of the field.\n\n* I often struggle with verbal instructions and tend to lose focus when I'm not spoken to directly, making listening in school a pain sometimes.\n\n* I was bad at anything requiring physical effort when I was younger, so I struggled with sports at school. I never learnt to tie and was late at learning to swim.\n\n* I cry easily and may even go mute over minor things, though I've got better at this as I've grown older. I'm 21 now.",

I am not afraid to ask deeper questions: why did you choose to study the subject you are doing?, what are your passions in life, what are major goals do you have\n   * at first people may look at you funny, but if you persist and show that you are actually serious and are interested in the answer, they will usually answer the question, and the change in demeanor is pretty amazing.  You see a change in their posture and they just relax completely.  People like \"being seen\" and it just completely melts and relaxes them.\n   * If this is someone who knows I am married, or back in grad school, knew my girlfriend, I would immediately relax them by telling them that I am not interested in them that way, I just want to get to know them, or I just see them as a friend.  That also helped them open up, once they saw I wasn't trying to use them or anything, I was just genuinely curious\n* Third, I bring it back to a shallower level again: I will ask them how they are doing, but show that I actually care, stuff like that.  You will be amazed at how if you show actual concern for people, how they will accept you, regardless of your autism\n\nIt is good stuff.\n\nWhat do you do?",

        "text": "Academic texts reiterate over and over that autism is characterised by challenges with social communication and that individuals with ASD have a tendency to perform repetitive behaviours. \n\nMore recent research seems to incorporate the sensorial differences associated with ASD. \n\nMost ASD assessments focus on these aspects - social functioning, repetitive behaviours and sensorial differences. \n\nMany people who have been diagnosed with ASD list a plethora of symptoms beyond the classic presentations that they have learned are associated with their ASD-specific neurodivergence. These symptoms are more subtle and as, I understand it, are often masking attempts.\n\nWhere is the research that lists these less conventional set of symptoms that mental health professionals are using to diagnose ASD? \n\nPlease note, I am not negating these less classic symptoms of ASD, but I feel like there must be research findings I have not been able to locate that describes them, and I am asking for help to find that research.\n\nThank you 😊",

        "text": "I was at a session with my therapist recently and she mentioned how quickly I spoke and how it was sometimes hard to keep up with. This got me thinking about my speech patterns in general. \n\nWhen I’m excited or engaged about a topic I will talk very rapidly and for a long time, so it’s hard for someone to get a word in edgewise. It’s more like I’m talking to myself than really anyone when I’m in this mode, I pay only a little attention to the other persons answers, and am more focused on getting all of my thoughts out as soon as possible. I do like having earnest discussions where I reply more directly to what the other person is saying, but they have to sort of take on the same speech patterns and maintain my energy? If that makes sense. It’s also hard for me to stop when I’m talking about something I’m interested in, and the other person will have to shut me down a few times. \n\nOn the other hand, when I’m in a situation where I’m not particularly knowledgeable or interested in the topic (often a group setting), I spend all of my time trying to absorb as much information as I can and figure out an appropriate way to add to the conversation. This leads to me being silent for a while and occasionally blurting out a comment after the moment has passed- which is always awkward, so I usually just don’t speak at all. The people around me are very aware of this and will sometimes comment on how I never talk to them. If I’m put on the spot I’ll say something completely inappropriate for the situation (ex: someone tells me about their test score, I’ll respond “yes”) in my panic. \n\nI know everyone switches up the way they interact in different situations, but the difference here was so notable I was thinking about it. I’d love to be able to talk in my rambling and fast paced way in any situation, but I know it’s not considered socially acceptable. I was just wondering if this is a thing anyone on the spectrum can relate to?",

I talked to my doctor about it, but they seemed confused that it was light and not hard pressure that bothered me. But they said if it’s never been a big issue then I should be fine. It’s never been too much of an issue, because I can just scratch it and adjust my shirt, and I’ll be fine. But recently it’s been more difficult to deal with, because now I work a full-time job, and as I’m rushing out the door in the morning, I don’t think about if my shirt will be comfortable enough. I’ve been working at this job for a little more than a month now, but for some reason, this has been more uncomfortable the past couple of days. At my job, I’m just sitting in the same position, so I can’t adjust my shirt in a way that’s comfortable, and it’s not like I can just go home and change my shirt. I don’t know how to describe it other than unbearable, feeling like I have to scratch it and adjust my shirt to where nothing is touching that spot on my chest. Working for so long without being able to do anything about it is starting to drive me a little crazy, and I feel like this isn’t a normal issue for people. I’ve thought that maybe I’ve had autism for other reasons, but I’ve never had any hypersensitivity to touch (other than I can feel every particle poking under me when I’m trying to sleep), and it’s just that spot for some reason.

My body can scream at me that it’s in pain and undernourished or my bladder can go completely offline until the task is complete at which point I nearly faint or nearly piss my pants. It can be a task I enjoy like gaming or something stressful like budgeting. On top of that, I have to make them more complicated than most people. **I add steps and do tons of research which makes the task take that much longer.** It’s happened with the most inconsequential asinine things like making a spreadsheet to breakdown and compare my ancestry by ancient tribe and region based on percentages from 5 different sites. Literally doesn’t matter but I can’t stop until it’s done or I’m paralyzed.\n\n*For example*: Monday/Tuesday. It started with me needing early spring weather appropriate clothes, so I was online shopping and paranoid that the clothes would sell out even though I logically knew that new items would replace them on the off chance they did. I can’t just buy clothes, I have to take screenshots and reverse image search them on Amazon, Google, and other shopping apps to see if I can find cheaper dupes or the item is being sold secondhand. I also have to remove the background of each item, edit it, and then try it on virtually on a cut out of myself like a paper doll because I’m worried about buying something that won’t look good or match what I already own which means that I’ll have wasted money and still be clothesless (even if there’s free returns). For every item. And then I did it for shoes but couldn’t buy the clothes until I made sure that I was confident that the shoes I chose would match most clothes. So in doing this, I ended up pulling an all nighter and also forgot to take my meds. Really really bad idea for someone with neuro/autonomic dysfunction. So while at an appointment after hour 26-ish of being awake, I was twitching, barely able to walk, vomiting, and unable to open my eyes even with sunglasses without the light causing intense pain and more muscle twitches/spasms. But looking back while miserable, I still cannot say that I would’ve been able to bring myself to just pause, sleep, and worry about the shopping later or just have clicked Pay Now without all the extra steps. \n\nSo I’ve known I do this but **because the consequences were so severe this time, I’ve realized this is not just an odd habit but a functional problem** and I tried looking up to see if it has to do with autism (and in turn find some coping techniques) but came up with nothing. So now I ask the masses: **Does anyone experience this hyperfixation on completing a task or intense overcomplication of tasks and is it related to an autistic trait?**",

If she is an arm's length away, put your hand on her waist or back and gently guide her back towards you, so she is six inches to a foot away from you.  The closer the better.\n* Try to position her directly in front of you.  Not to the side.\n* Do NOT ask her if you can kiss her!!!  Alarm bells will go off in her head, especially if she has been sending you signals all night that she wants you too.  DO ask parallel questions: \"Your skin looks so smooth, can I touch your face?\"  Alternatively, you can rephrase questions as statements: \"I really want to kiss you.\"  \"Your lips look tasty.\"  This gets the message across without making you look like a socially inept buffoon.\n* End the date with a hug.  Honestly, assuming the date is going well THIS IS WHAT SHE WANTS YOU TO DO.  So, if you are walking with her, put your arm around her and pull her tight to you.  Then when you get to her house, dorm room, whatever, pull her into a hug and look down at her.\n* Feel free to gaze into her eyes.  Seriously, women think it is romantic, sensual, and hot.  But don't hesitate to long.\n* Just go for it.  Assuming she is letting you hold her, she is looking up at you, she is pretty much saying, \"kiss me now.\"  She is probably also staring at your lips from time to time, and getting REALLY close to you.\n* Aim for her nose.  Don't try to aim for her lips.  It is too small of a target, you are way too nervous, and dude, YOU HAVE AUTISM, which means your coordination leaves a lot to be desired.  Aim for her nose, and then as you go toward her face shift your face diagonally.  You will hit the target almost every time.\n* Just respond to whatever she does.  Self explanatory.\n\nThere you go.  There are some tips for kissing!",

I constantly question the accuracy of sed diagnosis(I’ve had since I was 4). I had an IEP in school, motor skill problems, all of that plus problems with social skills, stimming, etc. I think a lot of my self doubt comes from only relatively minor sensory issues and lack of meltdowns(don’t really remember any as an adult). In fact I’m not even sure what I’m about to describe can be considered a shutdown… especially since I also have anxiety disorders. But here it goes I guess.\n\nIn 2020 I got super super stressed like lots of people. When the moments I got super stressed from prolonged anxiety happened doing anything other than doom scrolling for reassurance about my source of anxiety was absolutely daunting. It took so so so much effort to do much anything else. I conversed far less with my wife too because the idea of talking just felt like too much. I felt like if I did talk I’d either snap at my wife or start crying. This was an on and off thing for months. I had good days and bad days. I’m still not sure I can even consider this a shutdown though… again so much self doubt",

        "text": "\nI am afraid of other people thinking that I am trying to communicate something that I’m not. For my whole life (I’m 22F), people have accused me of being “checked out” (mute due to stress), “rude”/“having an attitude” (not having an awareness of my voice tone or echoing someone’s tone that I didn’t realize was rude), “shy”/“antisocial”(not understanding how to make friends with NT kids), “moody” (coke-bottling from masking all day). I hate when others get something incorrect about me, and I feel like it’s even dangerous sometimes. Last year, a professor was correcting me on something, and he kept coming back to that thing even though he’d already made himself clear, and I was like, “I’m sorry, am I sending some kind of signal that i’m not aware of?” I thought he thought I wasn’t listening so he felt the need to repeat himself. Basically, I always think it’s my fault if people misunderstand me or communicate in a way that’s unexpected/unplanned. \n\nThe worst version of this is being mistaken for flirting or being suggestive. I got my first false accusation of flirting when I was about 12, when my uncle’s then-wife pulled me aside and accused me of “being affectionate with him the way his wife would be.” I actually cried because I was being accused of something I had no knowledge of. I still to this day don’t know what she was on about, but she is no longer in my family’s life because she’s not the nicest or most stable person. When I was 16, I managed to catch the ire of my 27-year-old coworker’s GF, despite the fact that I had no romantic feelings toward the guy and the age gap was disgustingly wide. I’m a friendly, affectionate person, and I get scared that some guy is going to try to kiss me because he “thought I wanted it” or be like “I have a GF” when all I wanted was a friendship.",

My autistic friends have thought so too. Now that I’m being myself and have done some reevaluating- I’m realizing many things:\n\n1) I don’t have a single neurotypical friend, literally every person I’ve been close to and felt understood by has either had adhd or been autistic\n2) After researching what autism looks like in women and young girls- it’s literally my childhood, on paper.

I know deep down it’s the right word, but I’d never want to infringe on the community (I’ve been seeing a lot of discourse about others who self diagnose getting a lot of hate for it).\n\nWould it be valid to call myself autistic before I can afford my diagnosis?",

        "text": "I've come to the conclusion over the years that after relating to several types of people, most of the time unavoidably so, the ones I have more trouble dealing with/understanding are the walking contradiction types, hypocritically throwing stones only at those they perceive as criticizable and weak, while frailly taking refuge in their houses of glass.\nOne might argue: \"Well, surely dealing with someone who behaves in an openly aggressive way all the time must be harder to deal with\". While I agree that the overly agressive, sometimes sociopathic, types scare me more, if i'm forced to be with one, I find comfort in the fact that their behavior seems more predictably chaotic to me than that of others. I mean this in the sense that \"what you see is what you get\", so you kind of know what to expect when dealing with very mean people.\nThe same with overly nice people. Maybe sometimes they're \"too much\", but i'm prepared to expect that over niceness, that ends up being suffocating at times.\nAlso, I find it easier to excuse myself from openly rude people, as their visible meanness gives everyone a sort of \"excuse\" to avoid them, if one is allowed to do so.\nMy issues lie in the moral high ground types, those who assume they have it aaall figured out, with their condescending unsolicited advice. Those that tend to judge others (never themselves), while calling it \"constructive criticism\". \nIt's difficult to me because sometimes I just can't  resist the urge of bursting out and calling out all their hypocrisies, one by one, only to be clapped back with an avoidant: \"Why so serious?\" as if losing control were a definite sign you lost the argument.\nWhile I now understand that the best way to deal with these complicated types is getting as far away as possible, sometimes it's not something you can do in the near future (for example, my older brother, who ended up marrying a narcissist, after being betrayed by his best friend since 5 with his ex, and never being open about this trauma). In my case, the reason explaining this might be a perception that, deep down, I know they're so frail that putting them down feels unfair. It's so easy that it feels like cheating at the social \"game\" (something that would take more \"effort\" with an openly meaner person). It's also the reason why i've never picked (nor felt the urge to pick) on, so called, \"easy targets\" because, as much as other people see them as weak or easy to abuse, I consider them the strongest ones out there.\n\nTLDR: I don't know how to deal with hypocritical people, and tend to over or under react.

        "text": "Hello all, low needs masking autistic man here.  I'm now 36 and graduate school was 10 YEARS AGO!!!  GAH, I'M GETTING OLD!!!\n\nAnyway, my own opinion, just tell your peers, acquaintances, and friends that you are autistic in university.  \n\nI DIDN'T, and it sent me down a horrible spiral.  I barely finished my Master's by the skin on my teeth, I finished the year having burned all of my bridges, with no close friends, and now as a man going on into his 40s I feel that immense loneliness.\n\nI know it is a cliche', but honestly undergrad and grad are some of the best years of your life!  These are the years between full adulthood and adolescence that determine who you are, who you will become, and the relationships that will sustain you through marriage, raising kids, everything.\n\nThese are the people who you will need to lean on.  And I have no one.  It is just my wife, my 3 year old, and me.\n\nAnd it becomes unbearable sometimes.  I have thought about making a new Facebook sometimes because the loneliness seems unbearable.  \n\nSo, yeah that is my recommendation.  Just tell people.  Because they will come to their own conclusions if you don't when they see your quirks.  They will spend vile rumors that maybe you're on drugs, or partying too much (I was, but it was BECAUSE of my unaccepted autism).\n\nHonestly, TELL PEOPLE!\n\nIt will make your behavior so much easier to understand and empathize with.  The people who care will stick around.  The ones who don't won't.\n\nThat is life.  But if you don't tell anyone, everyone loses.  Mostly you.\n\nThat's my 2 cents.",

I'm pretty sure I'm autistic but I also live with anxiety and depression and I haven't sorted through whats my mental illness and what's asd.  I've been thinking on and off for about 5yrs now that I might be on the spectrum but the one time I brought it up to a therapist they were very dismissive and shot me down (they were also very disrespectful in other ways and I didn't go back to her anyways).  That experience has made me really hesitant to bring it up again.\n\nI'm trying to find a therapist with experience in asd to help me sort through what's anxiety/depression and what might be asd and trying to get officially evaluated.  The wait time for an evaluation at a local clinic is about 2yrs 😤. I feel really nervous about claiming that label without a professional diagnosis even though I know all the reasons self diagnosis is just as valid.",

        "text": "Hi all I'm so pleased to have found this subreddit!\n\nI wanted to ask about autistic black and white thinking / stubbornness and if the following scenarios would be an example of this, another autistic trait or not even autistic at all.\n\nI get irrational (angry?) &amp; stubborn if someone does something without me (especially when we had said we would do it together)\n or if someone has a life experience or knowledge of something that I don't.\n\nI'm on the waiting list for an official ASD diagnosis but have been diagnosed by a psychiatrist (it's a paperwork exercise at this point!)\n\n\n(I suspect low self esteem and my perceptions of myself as 'uncool' and the one with the knowledge as 'cool' plays into this thing and a lifetime of not knowing why I react the way I do to things so never doing those things myself)\n\n\n\nFor example a new game was released and my friend and I ordered the game together. they started by watching the intro without me without telling me they had even opened the box. Even though they stopped after the intro so I could 'catch up' they thought that's what we meant when we said we'd play together (I had been explicit about the plan its the second time this had happened!). The whole point was to experience it for the first time together. I haven't been able to play the game at all since it ruined the 'magic' for me. I guess since the situation didn't play out how I imagined it would in my head. \n\nAnother example is  my partner going on an overnight train without me. Neither of us had been on one before and had talked about wanting to do it together. He went away with a friend on the train before we had a chance to book and now I flat out refuse to go on that train (trains are a special interest of mine which makes this one harder for me to comprehend my stubbornness over it!) Why can't I just go on the train? (I know if I were to go now even without him I'd just be bitter and not enjoy it myself)\n\nI'm also this way about things where I might not have even known that person when they did something. for example my partner has been to various countries more recently than myself this was before we met and i now refuse to go to those places since it's an experience he's had that I haven't. I'm just not able to explain the reasons behind it? \n\nIn a similar vein I can't stand to not know something other people do. Things like reading up on birth stories or other life events I'd never even be able to go through myself!",

        "text": "Hello, \n\nI hope this is the right place to post this, I read the subreddit description and I think people here may be able to help. \n\nMy friend has been really taking advantage of me lately in so many unexpected ways that I do not understand the motivations behind. I have always thought this friend has a good heart and that's why I'm looking for an explanation outside of \"they're just a selfish asshole\". This is honestly coming from a place of confusion and compassion. \n\n*Reasons that make me wonder if they are on the spectrum:* \n\n\\- There are so many instances I could describe but **what it all seems to come down to is that it seems that my friend does not have common sense and they do not understand how to treat people without being explicitly told what is right and what is wrong.** \n\n\\- They also do not seem to be affected when they have wronged someone and that person has expressed it. They say something like \"I didn't know, moving forward I will not \\*then they regurgitate what the person just said\\*\". But if there is something fun to distract them they immediately  go back to that thing fully cheery as if nothing happened. \n\n\\- They also have some other tendencies and traits that I think could point to autism, such as: \n\n\\- They seem to mimic other people so they can fit in. \n\n\\- They seem to have pre-selected and consistent responses when talking to someone, but their responses don't always actually fit the conversation naturally. \n\n\\- They don't seem to be able to read a room or vibe. \n\n*Reasons I can think of why they may not be on the spectrum:* \n\n\\- They do not seem to have ever suspected it for themselves \n\n\\- They're extremely social, always making plans with people and filling every moment they can with social interaction \n\n\\- They can hold eye contact (actually very intense unblinking eye contact)",

Without noticing he will start stimming with his hand… it’s usually when he is thinking about something. He will just go silent and start moving his hand in that motion. His brother with downs also stims like this so I was just assuming maybe he learned it from growing up watching it. Does anyone else notice things like this with their family members/friends? I also do might do certain things from growing up with my siblings, but do not notice it. I was thinking about asking my partner about it but did not want to offend him. Thoughts?",
