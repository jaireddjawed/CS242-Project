They let you resit the exams during summer, so my whole summer got ruined as I watched everybody who passed turn up.\n\nResit day comes, I smoke the main exam and get a 63%. However, the university decides to fail me on the OSCE. I say fail me because the feedback they gave was complete bullshit, all I had to do was pass 1 more station and I would be fine. They completely ruined my future and my life and got away with it while im sitting here broken beyond repair.\n\nThis all happened in September last year. Im currently repeating the year and its driving me absolutely nuts. Since the results day I havent been at ease, I wake up miserable and sleep miserable knowing my reality. I watch all my previous colleagues go to their duties while it tears me apart since im not with them, and I never will be again.\n\nI'm currently crying my eyes out as im typing this.

        "text": "To give context to this situation, I’m a medical intern covering ER rotation for this month. I was stationed to cover the visual triage area for Respiratory emergencies and fast track with 1 other ER physician and a consultant covering the resuscitation area. The golden rule, as explained to me by the consultant was that any typical chest pain patients must be prioritized over any other non respi urgent case, and will need an immediate ECG to rule out STEMI and other cardiac emergencies. And i must report all cases i’m handling to our team leader unless it’s a STEMI, in which case i have to immediately inform the team to begin STEMI protocol then shift the patients to a tertiary hospital for PCI. \n\nA few days ago, at approx 9am i saw a patient who is ESRD and wheelchair bound complaining of typical chest pain since 7am. I knew that time is of the essence, since she also gave history of previous STEMI 1 year ago. So i asked the nurse to do an immediate ECG while i went to call the consultant. Unfortunately at the same time a code blue was being announced in resus, and when i got there the consultant was performing CPR and trying to resuscitate a patient. \n\nTensions were high inside and I was called to perform CPR as the consultant was getting tired, so i spent the next 3 to 5 minutes performing CPR until i swapped with someone else. I explained the situation to the consultant afterwards and told him that i’d go check the ECG then inform him afterwards. so i went back to check the ECG and yep, it was a STEMI. I called the ER physician and explained the situation to him, then we shifted the patient to the respiratory resus unit and immediately started her on STEMI protocol and afterwards sent her with EMS to be treated in a tertiary hospital.\n\nI was quite relieved after she was taken by the EMS to be treated in a tertiary hospital. She had told me that she had been neglected by her family for years and that she was living alone with a care taker. She had asked me if i would bring her food after her treatment is done as she hasn’t had anything to eat that day. \n\nAbout 4 hours later at 1pm i was approached by the consultant and was told this: “hey, do you remember the STEMI patient we had earlier? Apparently she died 10 minutes after PCI”. \n\nI was devastated. I know that i’ve only known this woman for 15 minutes, but i can’t help but feel guilty. I can’t sleep. I keep replaying the entire scenario in my head, trying to think of different ways i could have approached this, the same scenario, if i could have been a bit faster, or taken a different approach, she might have been still here.",

        "text": "Hey, I'm a European med student. Currently going through a lot because I can't manage to pass my tests; 4th year med student.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just can't see how I'm supposed to study medicine. I have a lot of trouble with understanding stuff, and at the same time I can't remember anything whatsoever.\n\nI tried Ankifying all the books we have to work on, but I don't have this overall vision of chapters so it's hard to understand stuff while doing practice questions. But at the same time, I can't study without Anki because I can't see myself studying without Anki, everytime I try working without Anki my brain tells me \"you're not gonna remember anything anyway since you didn't make anki cards, why even bother studying? :)\", and then I lose all motivation and end up not doing anything or not be focused.\n\nAlso, I have a big fog in my brain, don't know if that's because I'm overloaded with med school or burnt out but yeah I'm super lost...\n\nif anyone has tips I'll gladly take some, thanks.",

However, there are days where I have severe pain flares that I can’t avoid. I applied 22-23 cycle and have been very blessed to have a fair amount of acceptances, and will be starting med school in the summer. As it is now starting to feel real, I am a bit nervous about how faculty and professors will view this. I was able to hold my own in college pretty well and I think I have a better grasp on pain management even more so now. (Becoming a physician is the only thing I want to do, and I can’t imagine doing anything else, so I’m not going to let pain stop me.) Is anyone struggling with chronic pain that is in med school or practicing that could give some advice? Thank you :)",

My family is in Europe and I’d like to go home to see them every month at least. I have even considered just moving there but can’t justify it with the low salaries of European physicians. I will obviously have to suck it up during residency, but I wanted to ask you all what you think options for remote work are post-residency, and which specialties are the best pathways in reaching them? Decent compensation is a must for me after devoting my 20’s to pre-med and med school. \n\nCurrently my goal is EM as it seems to offer both good compensation and a good number of days off at 12hr schedule hospitals. I’m also open to work outside of medicine, as long as it offers me the ability to work virtually or travel often.",

What started with a laparoscopic procedure turned into an open appendectomy due to an infected appendix.  Apologies if this is not worded correctly.\n\nAfter the procedure, when the doctor came in to check on me, he was always with a group of other folks. I wasn't there long but it happened each time.  I thought it was strange, group of folks surrounding the bed and I had to somehow keep my modesty in check and show them  my belly.    \nWere they medical students and/or residents?  \n\nThanks again and if anyone has any questions about programming or what not let me know, but please wait until May as that's when I graduate and I'm sure I will be an expert then.

I could be wrong but I believe he does this numerous times throughout the year as I think I have worked a few of them.\n\nAfter the party we were finishing up (myself and 3 male co-workers) and a guy who attended the party came up and asked my name and if I wanted to go get a drink. LOL. WHAT.... My co-workers the lovely fellows that they are, told him we were going somewhere near by to have coffee. They asked him to join us. He did along with a few others. He’s a very nice guy, a medical student in Pennsylvania graduating in May. He stayed a few extra days and we met for coffee/lunch a couple of times before he went back to school.\n\nWe have kept in touch, speak on the phone daily (I hate texting so he is out of luck there) and he has plans to come visit mid-February. I really don’t have much experience dating (almost none as I’m quite shy) and really don’t want to get involved in any kind of long distance thing.\n\n**I am staying here in this city as I have a job lined up and will be starting in July.**\n\nHe told me if he “matches” he will most likely move here.\n\nCan someone explain a few things:\n\nIs it normal for someone who is a senior in medical school to have a lot of free time from January until graduation?\n\nWhat are rankings?\n\nWhat is a match or match day?\n\nWhat exactly is an intern and/or resident?\n\nI’m just a computer nerd and I have no clue about the medical field whatsoever.\n\nThanks!",
