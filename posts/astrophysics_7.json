        "text": "Hey everyone, question for you all.\n\nSkip to tl;dr if you dont want to read the backstory and just want to go to the question.\n\nHere in The Netherlands when you are in highschool you have to do a project called a PWS to end your highschool with. I do VWO (the highest of the 3 difficulty levels of highschool) and I am in my last year, which means as a VWO’er i have to spend 80 hours on my PWS. The PWS has to be about what you want to study in university, which in my case is Astrophysics.\n\nWhat I want to do for my PWS is measure the redshift of certain galaxies, and plot them out. From the plot I want to derive the Hubble’s constant to calculate how old the universe is. Reference video: https://youtu.be/wuPJ2R3n7kc\nHowever, isnt this too difficult for me to do? (I have good grades in maths and physics, so I have the theoretical knowledge), however do you think this is practically possible? \nI have my own telescope, and i can go to a public telescope to do the measuring/photographing of the galaxies. Also i can get help from an astrophysics professor I know closely, but I don’t want to bother him too much as it is MY graduation project.\n\nTL;DR Do you think it is possible to derive the Hubble’s constant from measurements of galaxies that I did on my own?\n\nI hope someone can give their insight in this situation!\n",

        "text": "This may be more of a particle physics question more than astrophysics, but I'll ask it here anyway: Could dark matter possibly be composed of clumps of theoretical gravitons floating through space? If gravitons are real, here's what we know about them now: The graviton is a massless (because gravity propagates at the speed of light), spin-2 (for stress-energy tensor reasons I don't quite understand) boson. Because the particle is massless, it would be undetectable through normal means, much like dark matter is. Certain interactions between large groups of undetectable gravitons could also create gravitational waves, such as merging black holes and binary stars that have already been detected to produce them. An irregular distribution of gravitons could cause the effects of dark matter that we see today, like galaxy shapes not matching mathematical predictions using classical mechanics. \n\nAnother, much more hypothetical, question: Could there be an analogous \"anti-graviton\" that contributes towards universal expansion as per Hubble?\n\nSome backstory for those interested: I'm about to enter my senior year in high school and am interested in studying astrophysics in college. I also struggle with mild/moderate depressive disorder and often have bouts of extreme self-doubt (as I'm sure we all do). I feel like I lack achievement in life and want to possibly write a semi-academic paper on the first theory I proposed (using citations and the like but still keeping some tongue-in-cheek NDT-esque writing). I want to ask the community whether this is a solid enough theory to write about. Thanks in advance and sorry for the long post if you happened to read it all.",

I didn’t know if it involved the escape velocity equation or orbital velocity equation but I realized the orbital velocity is for circles. The orbital velocity for an ellipse, that I found, was the Vis-Visa equation and I assumed the distance, r, from the two objects was at perilune.

Here is where I need some help: I would like to use this data (mutual inclinations between the orbital planes of planets) to test if my theory distinguishes between Rayleigh distributed data i.e if it's Rayleigh distributed it will pick it up, and other distributions.

I want to make sure i'm understanding it as it seems like a really long complicated process..**\n\nSo, I understand that inside a main sequence star, the helium byproduct of hydrogen fusion in the core becomes the core as the star begins to die.\n\n***Is this because helium is denser than hydrogen and gravity is pushing everything inside a star toward the core? or is there no more hydrogen left only \"helium ash\" that take up all the space in the core?***\n\nThe increasing density of the core causes the core to contract. Denser core means more gravitational force on the core making the core smaller and hotter(because more compact gas gets hotter) until it decreases to the maximum smallness allowed by the electrons in the core(Red Giant Phase) This gas compression causes high enough temperature for helium fusion to produce carbon (triple-alpha process) at the core. A secondary byproduct of the newfound temperature increase is hydrogen outside of the core is now able to undergo fusion and forms a hydrogen elemental layer or hydrogen shell around the hot new helium core.\n\nThis cycle continues (without the core continuing the shrink due to electron degeneracy) progressively fusing the newer byproducts Carbon, Oxygen etc. forming more elemental layers (this is allowed by the ever-increasing temperature of the core). In low mass stars this process stops at carbon and eventually gravity can no longer contain the outer layers of the star causing the star to eject it's elemental layers into space (planetary nebula).\n\nFor heavier stars which are either born with huge mass or gain it from another star like binary stars (heavy enough to surpass the mass threshold aka Chandrasekhar limit) this progressive fusion of heavier and heavier elements continues until it gets to iron which does not produce enough energy through fusion to meet the force of gravity on the star causing the star to implode and create a supernova or neutron star or black hole.\n\n***What is the reason that in a smaller mass star gravity can't hold in the layers together, but in a higher mass star it can? I'm guessing its because the lower mass star is hotter outside the core (more energy = more force(energy) produced than gravitational force). If not, then I don't understand why this happens in the low mass star and not the high mass one.***",

        "text": "I started having anxiety attacks about 5 years ago. The past several months have got so bad I started on Lexapro. My first one was trigged by watching a guy jump into a pool on TV. I suddenly felt like I was him falling but couldn't shake that feeling.\n\nI would try to rationalize it by telling myself I am grounded and not falling. Then that led to my mind wandering worse... \"Well how am I safe when I am on a planet that is held in orbit by a force that isn't something we can see/touch in a normal way.\" I would then reason that away with the reassurance that even if something did happen that sure we would float toward or away from the sun which would be the end of life but we would never fall down because there isn't an up and down outside of our realm of gravity.\n\nThat reasoning seems to calm me until my brain kicks in again... \"How am I truly still when I am on a planet that is spinning around at 1,000 mph. Stillness is an illusion that doesn't exist.\" That I can not seem to reason away no matter how much I try to understand how the speed is only relative to the huge size of the earth and how since it is smooth it is not even noticed. That one is really the worst.\n\nThe thought of a bunch of buildings or people somewhere being too heavy for the earth seems to bother me too. I keep trying to go back to reasoning that we can't fall if that was even the case. I also try to think about how small that area still is compared to the huge planet. How there are areas of land \"heavier\" with no issue. How the dirt removed to create that building probably weighed more than the area is now. How the earth has shifted over time to account for that. How we are a closed ecosystem and nothing is here now that wasn't already here.\n\nAnother random worry seems to be things moving or spinning. From fans to rivers, heck even my dryer or AC... I seem to very illogically think that something moving or maybe everything like that moving so much could impact the earth some how. I quickly try to reason with myself again about how small even all those things are compared to the huge earth is. How those things no matter how fast or many could change anything about the planet. My mind then starts thinking about bigger things like drilling, fracking, volcanos, earthquakes, geysers, even particle accelerators. Mainly the particle accelerator.\n\nThe idea that the earth or everything could just collapse on itself pops in my head every now and then too. Somewhat related to the previous line of thought but sometimes just on it's own.\n\nLast woe is about the universe expanding... does this mean we are expanding too?\n\nI appreciate you all taking the time to read this. I hope some of you can maybe add some more educated reasoning for me to draw from. This isn't an everyday thing or necessarily all these things at once thing. Facts seem to calm me down more than anything eventually. I am also now seeing a doctor and like I said already being treated with Lexapro. Thank you.",

I started thinking after watching a video on Reddit of a guy swimming in a whirlpool (Yes he did get sucked in and died). I started thinking about the universe and how Hubble observed us moving further away from other galaxies \"proving\" expansion. What if Hubble was right but for the wrong reason? Not expansion but retraction. I think about two fish at equal distance swimming at the same rate torwards the center of the whirlpool, as the first fish gets closer to the center it would begin moving a little faster. Now it knows it's moving torwards a whirlpool because it has reference points but let's say it's at night and both fish are wearing a small LED headlamp. The first fish looks back and all it knows is that he is now further away from the other fish. It could assume it is being pushed rather than pulled. Everything in the universe is falling into something else so why assume it is any different at the macro level? What if the universe wasn't created by a big bang at all but is created by the flow of radiation (Hawking radiation) from the center of our universe condensing at the end of the radiations decay creating the edge of the universe by forming and condensing into the particles that form new gasses and such to create new galaxies? What if this just happens forever? Continually recycling galaxies into the center to create new radiation to form new galaxies? Anyway it's just a thought I had. I'm no genius I just want someone to tell me my theory is dumb with a reason why. Thanks! \n\nP.S.Also I can't spell for shit and my grammar sucks. ",

        "text": "Hey Guys!\nFirst, sorry! English is not my mother tongue AND i am not from this field of knowledge at all. So please have mercy with me in case im using some word wrong.\n\nSecond, my question is a 100% fictive. Take my example as given and dont try to explain me why this wouldnt work to begin with ^_^\n  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo i guess most of you watched the movie Interstellar. There is this one situation where they are approaching this one planet which is pretty close to a blackwhole. For those who didnt watch. There is a planet pretty close to a blackwhole. Being on that planet would dilate time drastically. \n\nSituation: You have one group of people right outside of the zone of impact from that field of gravity and one group on this planet. Lets say 1 minute on this planet is the same as 1 hour on the transport unit. Both groups have a device with them which let them see the other group pretty clear (e.g you can see the shape of the body from the people on the planet)\n\nQuestion. Since time is dilated by gravity what happens to what they see. They are looking at each other while they are moving. Is the movement for the one group slower than for the other? Or is it as i would watch someone running here on earht?\n\n\nI am really sorry if i didnt express myself to a level where you can understand what i mean =( At least I hope you do understand ^_^\n\nCheers",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/astrophysics/comments/8kzflj/working_on_a_science_fiction_novel_but_i_want_it/",
        "text": "Over the past couple years I've been very disappointed by science fiction. While there are full realism stories like \"The Martian\" and ridiculous \\(fantasy masquerading as science fiction\\) stories like \"Guardians of the Galaxy,\" there appears to be no happy medium. So I've decided to give it a shot myself in an attempt to write something fun, touching and not throw reason out in the window in the process. Unfortunately my mathematics are trash, so I require some assistance. Everyone who helps will be credited if I finish this project.\n\nThe story is set around one solar system and interstellar travel is beyond their technological capabilities, so warp drive and hyper space are no issue. I need to figure out habitable zones, distances between planets and whether the type of planets I've suggested are reasonable to coexist with each other. If you're interested, please go through the following list and tear things things apart. Also suggest ways that ideas can be achieved in other more realistic ways if you can.\n\nPlanet A: Muspel.\n\nThe most uncontroversial pick on the list. A small, rocky planet similar to our Mercury. Not really a big player in the story, but it would be helpful to know if mining resources from such planets is plausible with the right equipment. I'm guessing no, because of the heat from proximity to the sun. I MAY create special silicon based life on said planet later down the road, but that's just a thought.\n\nPlanet B: Oswara.\n\nA planet right on the edge of the habitable zone in the direction of the sun. Gotta have a desert planet is scifi LOL, so this is mine. It's mostly arid and sandy, but has an unexpectedly large FRESH water ocean. Maybe from a relatively recent comet impact, does that make sense? Or because of specialized life forms that eat up all the minerals in the water. Anyway, the coast is the only green part of the planet and is actually a prime farming location from which large quantities of food are grown and shipped to other colonies. There is life across most the desert expanse, but it's weird. A type of animal has actually evolved to photosynthesize and comes up from sand burrows during just the right times of day, when the sun isn't too strong or weak. Like living cactuses! These animals form the backbone of the desert ecosystem, much like our plankton but bigger. Larger animals exist to eat them, even larger animals eat those and so on. There's also a race of intelligent bug \"elves\" that live like communal insects.\n\nPlanet C: La'Bruen.\n\nNot a Jupiter, not a hot Jupiter... a WARM Jupiter. A small gas giant that exists within the habitable zone, and therefore has   \\(of course\\) FLOATING CITIES! But these are enclosed floating cities, because I don't think a gas giant composed of oxygen is very realistic. At least you only need a breathing mask and not a space suit to perform repairs. I need to know if warm Jupiters are possible, what kind of gas it could be made from and what color it would be. Also, it has three moons that I haven't developed yet. Cool suggestions for those are appreciated!\n\nPlanet D: The Shattered Ring\n\nIt isn't a planet at all, well not anymore. It's a strangely close asteroid belt, \\(like the Kuiper Belt sorta\\) and a home for asteroid miners, merchants and most importantly... SPACE PIRATES! The main characters of my story. Is it possible to have an asteroid belt relatively close to the Star? Would a large planet exploding cause that? If not, what WOULD cause an asteroid belt to form closer than the Kuiper.\n\nPlanet E: Baltiar\n\nPast the asteroid belt is a rocky super earth rich with valuable metals. A LONG LONG time ago, people were sent as colonists to mine those resources. Unfortunately the gravity of Baltiar is much stronger than we're used to, thanks to it being dense and large. So the first colonists almost all died! However, the strongest ones managed to survive and breed with others, creating a new race of stronger more durable people who have mined Baltiar for generations. What's the limit of additional gravity that people could adapt to? 1.5x? 2x? The surface of the planet is very rocky and uneven. I'm not an expert in plate tectonics, but I want them to be very active and push up mountains all over the place. The ground level is uneven, with many deep crevasses and some monsters to add more tension.  So the colonists live in habitat domes atop mountain plateaus and ride elevators down the sides to mine for short periods before returning. \n\nPlanet F: UNKNOWN.\n\nDoesn't have name yet, either because I'm lazy or because nobody in my story knows about it yet. \\*C O U G H\\* It's much further away from the others and is cold, but not so cold people can't venture there in reasonably protective suits. I want it to be a snow planet that houses an ancient malevolent AI from ages past.\n\nThe most important thing I need help with in relation to the planets is figuring out how far apart they are, so I can figure out the time it would take to travel between them.\n\nSome final details:\n\nStar Type: Yellow dwarf! I don't want to have issues with tidal locking.\n\nStarship fuel: Liquid hydrogen from mining icy bodies and splitting the water through electrolysis. The electricity is solar of course. I also need to figure out the speed at which travel will be possible. I want this solar system to replicate the relative size of the earth to medieval people, Star Ships being the equivalent of sailing ships and almost nobody pondering the question of going beyond the known world.\n\nRadiation Protection: Hydrogen again? In the form strategically placed water storage on ships, or specialized armor? Need suggestions on this one.\n\nBone degeneration/artificial gravity: Simulated gravity through the spinning of ship sections. I had an idea for larger ships having rotating living spaces INSIDE of them for added protection, so that all time off duty can be spent with normal gravity.\n\nWeapons: Ballistic!\n\nLasers, Plasma and other such scifi staples don't really seem realistic to me. I could be wrong though, if anyone as an idea for cool, realistic scifi weapons that would be great. Ship to ship combat will be all about blowing holes in your opponents engines so that boarding procedures can begin.\n\nThat's all I can think of right now! I may add more later. Please destroy my ideas so I can restructure them. \\&lt;3",
