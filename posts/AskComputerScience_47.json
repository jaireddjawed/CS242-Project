So that leaves either the odd or even check. But why would it make a difference? As far as I can tell, using an odd or even check is simply a matter of convention or preference.\n\nCan anyone shed some light on this subject?",

I'm supposed to determine how many mailboxes a 16-bit binary LMC can have, given that it has the same op codes as the regular model (in binary). I know that the op codes will be four bits in length (9 = 1001), but I can't figure out the number of mailboxes.

But if the data counts as part of the 16 bits, then I have no clue what the answer might be.\n\nIf anyone could help me sort out my confusion, I'd greatly appreciate it.\n\nAlso, I wasn't sure if this is an /r/askProgramming or /r/askComputerScience question, so I'm asking it here and there.",

        "text": "I just posted this on StackOverflow, but it looks like it's quickly on it's way to being closed.\n\n\"I've spent hours trying to get even a brief introduction on creating a mouse sharing network, searching for the \"How To's?\" and \"How do they work?\" All I've come up with is endless pages pointing to [Synergy](http://synergy-foss.org) and [Share Mouse](http://www.keyboard-and-mouse-sharing.com).\n\nOne reason for my trouble is likely that I'm not familiar with the appropriate jargon to get me to the right places. The best I've gotten is that they usually (or always?) use a virtual KVM desktop, but beyond that I've hit a wall.\n\nI am trying to set up the sharing between a Windows PC and Mac Pro. The two systems share multiple screens, and different screens can be dynamically allocated to either system, on an as-needed basis.\n\nI would like to try to roll my own mouse sharing software (along with file, etc), but with a few extra caveats over the current options available:\n\n* #####BOTH systems can immediately take the roll of server (or share the load at all times)\n\n    Currently, mouse sharing software assigns one system as a server, and the rest as clients. I won't always be using both systems, and might shut one off at a moment's notice (or kick the power cord, or whatever). With current mouse sharing, if the server gets shut off, then the clients are all without keyboard and mouse.\n\n    For my own software, I'd like to maintain uninterrupted functionality at all times.\n\n* #####No WiFi -&gt; Connection exclusively through a hard link (cable)\n\n    Again, current options can allow some finagling to allow crossover cables to be used between the systems. This has the drawback that only one system is truly connected to the internet, and the other is piggybacking off of it.\n\n    For my own, I would like both systems to have ethernet modem connections at all times (again, in the case that I'm using one or the other, or maybe one is down). The particular connection is not a huge concern - I'm happy to connect the two through a crossover cable, or USB, or thunderbolt or whatever.\n\n    An additional reason for the hard link between the two is speed. I don't want any lag between the two screens when the cursor crosses over, and I would like to have the most optimized environment for sharing clipboard and drag/drop files. WiFi is undesirable, and I'm sure not all connection options are created equal.\n\n* #####No Virtual Machines (If possible...)\n\n    In the interest of not including more than is absolutely necessary, I was wondering if there can be a more direct protocol created between the two systems, opposed to having to mount a virtual environment, and pass everything through that? This goes back to speed - I can't imagine that a virtual environment would be anywhere near as quick as a direct system-to-system protocol.\n\nMy reason for wanting to roll my own is to get the exact functionality I seek - with nothing more and nothing less - as well as to improve my coding prowess. Whether or not this is the case, I also feel like I have a safer setup when the two systems are not sharing the same internet connection or communicating through WiFi; hard links are reassuring, and I have more control on what can be permitted through the connection.\n\nI'm sorry that I don't have any code to include in this, but I honestly don't know the first place to begin. There doesn't seem to be a lot of readily available resources on the topic, and my ignorance with this kind of coding/integration is a major handicap.\n\nAny pointers, topics to look into, existing similar project and so on, are all welcome. I'll take anything I can get.",

Predicting will get more than 4.0 this trimester. But my overall will still remain poop. Already took the SAT and got about 970 (Literally did not try and guessed mostly on the math section). Going to take it again. My mom said she will kick me out if I don't get around 1400. I am lazy and don't study much. (I feel like if I actually studied I could been around 5% of my class right now). Going to take it about 2 more times.\nNow the real question. I am researching colleges, and want to major in Computer Science (am taking a computer science course in senior year right now). I honestly don't know if i like this field or not, but I like a lifestyle where I can do work at home and do something else in free time, like working out and family time and other crap, and still earn a lot of money, (figured CS would fit me).

I want to transfer into Universities after CC, but don't know where. And I also don't know which is the best CC for CS field in TX. And also I cannot afford to be in debt, since my parents are in debt :/  \nI want to move out of home after Graduating High School, and live out. I promise you I am motivated at first and want to be the best at everything I can, and learn everything, but am lazy and get demotivated really quick. \nSo my main question is what should I know before majoring in CS. What ever information possible. I feel like I am failing in life and really need help. I am a ambitious person but get demotivated. And did I mention my parents always fight, and it is really stressful for me. I want to live as a happy person, but don't see any options. \nAny feedback will be terrific. I don't want to regret anything in my life so any feedback will be taken seriously.\nThank you :]",

Essentially, I'll be working with a couple of graduate students on their Masters' project, which will involve breaking down an IoT system (not sure what yet), and studying it's security mechanisms/finding vulnerabilities.  It sounds like a great way to learn and gain some experience; that being said, these students are well-ahead of me in terms of their knowledge in the field.  \nBottom line: how can I, with my limited experience, be more of an asset to the team, rather than a detriment?  And are there any good resources that I need to see before meeting up with them again to ensure that I can effectively contribute?",

I can, however, still open the same original file on my computer before I submitted it.

        "text": " Hello all, \n\n(and apologies to mobile reddit users, if the powers like 2^3 = 8 don't show up right).\n\nI was looking through the drill exercises of the third chapter of [the book by Manber](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Creative-Udi-Manber/dp/0201120372) and found the following problem difficult. Let me first regurgitate **the problem**.\n\n&gt; Prove, by using [the theorem below], that: n*(log of n to base 3)^5 = Big_O(n^1.2 ).\n\n[Per tradition, I'll refer to *g*(n) as it is usually presented in other texts, i.e. the estimated run time represented by *f*(n) = Big_O(*g*(n)). I'll also write the log of n to a base b as \"log_b(n)\".]\n\nThe **theorem** mentioned is this: \n&gt; For all *c* &gt; 0, all *a* &gt; 1, and all monotonically increasing *f*(n), (*f*(n))^c = Big_O(a^*f*(n) ). In other words, an exponential function grows faster than does a polynomial function.\n\nJust to remind the reader, taking log of n to any base (greater than one) results in Big_O(n). Additionally, one can add a couple of different *f*(n)'s and the complexity class of the sum is equal to the addition of the respective *g*(n)'s; multiplication works out to the same effect.\n\n**Major events in my attempt**: I tried working the problem backwards and forwards, but wasn't sure if either approach brought forth any reasonable fruit. Working a bit forwards, one can see that n * (log_3(n))^5 = (n^1/5 * log_3(n))^5. However, after making additional calculations based directly off of the above theorem, I got to a *g*(n) of 3^n^1/5 * n.\n\nAfter some frustrating repeats of working forwards, I then worked backwards from the given *g*(n) of n^1.2 . You can decompose this to n^1/5 * n, which can come from multiplying the complexity classes of the functions n^1/5 and n *or* log_b(n), in particular with b = 3. However, per the theorem, raising the product of n^1/5 and log_3(n) to the fifth power would bring me back to the *g*(n) from the above paragraph.\n\n**Conclusion**: I'm at a loss, at this point. I feel like I'm missing something, like the fact that a quadratic *f*(n) is not just in Big_O(n^2 ), but also in Big_O(n^3 ), and that I can reduce the time complexity by \"just\" replacing the 3^n^1/5 term with n^.2, but that just feels artificial.\n\nPlease help me, and even if you can't help and have read this far, thanks for taking the time to read through this post, which might be hard to read. If it's too dense, I'll re-iterate in the comments.",

Primarily I work in R, but have decent python and bash experience.\n\nI'd like to transition from data analysis to software development. My question is what path would be best to do so? I've considered going back for a BS in computer science, attempting to get into a computer science masters program, or just focusing on teaching myself new languages. \n\nAny input on what the best course of action would be is appreciated!",

        "text": "Hi,\nI'm in my second year of college and currently looking for summer internships. Right now I'm applying to two major types of jobs:\n1. The deam jobs: Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon... The one's that everyone has heard of, the jobs that you can find by searching \"top computer science jobs\" and that I have very very very little shot of actually getting.\n2. Local jobs. CS jobs in my hometown and in my college town that I think I have a good shot of getting. I had one of these internships last summer, and while I did gain a lot of valuable experience, I would like to do something better for this summer.\nSo my question is this: What is the middle tier? Where do I find the jobs that aren't the Google-tier jobs, but that the Google-tier jobs will want to see on my resume come next year when I'm looking for internships again? Obviously nobody is going to advertise themselves as mid-tier, so I'm wondering if anybody has been in a similar place to where I am now, and has any suggestions for searching.\n\nThanks so much!",

I know I want to major in computer science but I feel like I'm so far behind in terms of programming knowledge I'll never be qualified for an internship position. \n\nThis semester I'm taking my first programming class and am actively enjoying it however the programs I'm writing are very basic such as a Fahrenheit to Celsius converter in Java or printing in JOptionPanes (I realize this is truly beginner stuff, yet this is the extent of my knowledge)\n\nI'd like to get an internship this summer but I have no special qualifications of CS knowledge other than a 4.0 GPA. Between 15 credits of classes and 30 hours of work a week I struggle just to stay on top of my classes. Never mind learning how to program on the side and working on personal projects. \n\nHow can I best prepare myself? I am a true beginner and like an idiot when I can't even write a simple program and people in my class have coded video games already and know about four languages?",
