I.e., you create a new account and they credit your account with say $200 in free bets. \n\nYou can do this across several of the different apps, it wouldn’t surprise me if you could get up to a grand in credit between all the apps.\n\nAfter creating your new accounts and claiming the promotions, just bet all of your funds on both sides of the same matchup. \n\nIdeally you would like an even matchup between two opponents where one isn’t heavily favored. \n\nBet both sides with you free bets, you’re guaranteed to win back roughly half of your “free bet” money.\n\nAfter that, you can just take the money and run. \n\nI hit all the apps for a couple hundred bucks each back in college, helped me close out my senior year. \n\nIt may take some effort in creating an account, but as long as you aren’t a defer age gambler it quite literally is free money.",

It's such a weird question, most people are like \"what the hell are you talking about, are you okay?\", and Google seems to think it's only caused by cancer, burns, and allergies. It's not.\n\nFrom what I can tell, it's caused by the saliva glands in the roof of your mouth being at rest for an extended period of time and suddenly being sent into overdrive, often caused by dry and sugary foods like bread, cake, and donuts.\n\nSome people say drinking water before or during the pain will lessen it.\n\nSome people think the pain only occurs when you are dehydrated already.\n\nThe only 100% solution I've found is to use orajel. It completely numbs the pain and you can continue living your life and eating your captain crunch just like the majority of the planet who thinks you're crazy and/or terminally ill.",

What confuses me is that i've been feeling very heartbroken, probably the most heartbroken i've been. \n\nThe reason i'm confused about this is that it wasn't even that great or special when we dated. I didn't feel too physically attracted to her, sex/kissing wasn't good, we never had any deep or meaningful conversations, and there wasn't any real romance. Neither was it super exciting and there wasn't a real spark, we also never laughed out loud or had any really special moments. We were in contact everyday all day long tho so i do think i got really attatched and i liked her as a person. \n\nIt was mostly just very comfortable with her and all the feel good chemicals from cuddling and intimacy. As well as talking to her all day long. When she ended things i did have a very strong feeling about not wanting to lose her and feeling more attracted to her. I wonder if this even about her or if i am just missing something else? Maybe it wouldn't have worked out with her anyways?",

And the good news is it takes NO EFFORT at all, simply \n\nGoogle “how to take a screenshot on (device)” and bookmark that, or memorize the keyboard shortcut.\n\nIt takes almost no space on your device, and it may save your financial or legal life someday by PROVING what was promised or confirmed by a bank, bill collector, or other type of business that “forgets” or makes an expensive “mistake”.",

        "text": "Most home routers have a built-in VPN server which you can enable. This allows you to connect to your home network from anywhere and use services like Netflix as if you were at home. This will also bypass the requirement to check in from your home network once a month when it is implemented. Because it's using a residential IP and not a data center like a commercial VPN, Netflix cannot detect it.\n\nHere are instructions for the most popular router brands:\n\nNetgear: [https://kb.netgear.com/23854/How-do-I-use-the-VPN-service-on-my-Nighthawk-router-with-my-Windows-client](https://kb.netgear.com/23854/How-do-I-use-the-VPN-service-on-my-Nighthawk-router-with-my-Windows-client)\n\nAsus: [https://www.asus.com/support/FAQ/1008713/](https://www.asus.com/support/FAQ/1008713/)\n\nTP-Link: [https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/1544/](https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/faq/1544/)\n\nTo connect to the server you will need to download the OpenVPN client on your phone/laptop:\n\n[https://openvpn.net/vpn-client/](https://openvpn.net/vpn-client/)\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the speed of the VPN will be limited by the upload speed of your home network. Most cable internet connections have very limited upload speed, but it should be enough to stream video. If you have a fiber connection it will be much faster.",

In my case, this leads to extremly long program runtimes, extreme water consumption and finally explains why the clothes sometimes smelled a bit weird: The washing agent was constantly thinned by new water coming in and thus the clothes don't get cleaned correctly.   \n\n\nHow to spot the Problem: In my case, I noticed that even while pumping water off, new water was still coming in. If you shut down your washing machine (or even turn off the power), the water flow should stop immediately (as the valve is kept open by the coil) - which didn't happen for me. In this case, you'll need to shut off your main valve, and drain the machine manually... Now I am waiting for a replacement valve and hope that it fixes the issues.",
