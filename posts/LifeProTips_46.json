        "text": "I talk every day to workers who have been screwed over by their employers and are looking for justice. One of the most common obstacles they run into is a lack of good documentation or a paper trail.  \n\n\nIn a legal context evidence is king. Your feelings and experiences may be valid, but if you are accusing your employer of wrongdoing the burden of proof is on YOU. If you don't have evidence to prove your claims law firms won't work with you and judges won't care.  \n\n\nMany employers know this. They know a lack of evidence protects them from legal action, and will suggest methods of communication that don't produce a written record. Have you ever been texting your boss or HR about an issue when they asked \"do you mind if i called you about this? it would be easier to talk.\" RED FLAG. Information given or promises made over the phone or in person don't produce a written record, and without hard evidence it may as well never have happened.  \n\n\nThe solution? If you're having issues with your employment, insist on communicating through email. Email is the gold standard of paper trails. An email chain says exactly who said what at what time to whom, and provides extremely little wiggle room. They can be easily produced and are easy to organize by subject, correspondents, and timeline. If you use a work email, make sure to make these emails accessible to you, \\*\\*\\*even if you are suddenly no longer employer and your access to that work email is gone!\\*\\*\\*  \n\n\nTexts and messages through teams or slack are okay, but aren't quite as easy to manage, organize, and produce, may be harder to visually show when and to whom they were sent, and will be difficult to access if your employment suddenly ends. Protect yourself by making a paper trail; insist on discussing issues about your employment over email and make those emails accessible no matter what happens to your employment!",

It was going good and then suddenly her ex came back who she was with for 6 years and said he wants her back, basically confessing his love to her. She said she's confused and probably wants to give it a try with him again (she's still not back with him as far as i know) But obviously we couldn't keep dating in this situation. \n\nThe weird thing is i'm completely broken by it, can't really sleep, intense heartache and i think about her all day. I don't understand why. The time in which we dated wasn't even that exciting. We had no deep conversations, intimacy wasn't that good and there was no real spark, it was just comfortable. We talked and met up a lot, we were in contact all day long. For some reason after she broke up with me due to the situation with her ex, i wanted her 10 times more. I suddenly saw her in a different way and it made me super attracted to her. I see her so rose-colored now and really on a pedestal, i don't think it's even realistic. In my mind i feel like i lost the love of my life. How does this happen?",

The two jobs i got that were meant to be my escape from that industry ended up not being what I hoped.\n\nOne was a union job that, while it was a good career with good benefits, would have meant I was stuck where I live now which is not what I wanted. It was also extremely unfulfilling and bored me to insanity. I worked there for about 3 years. \n\nThe second career jobv was with GEICO as an auto damage adjuster. I lasted about 9 months until the job started to affect me physically and mentally. I gained A TON of weight. I had no energy for anything else. I started feeling tension in my chest and neck. I was always out of breath even while laying in bed. I even gained a nervous tick that made me blink and swallow uncontrollably. I felt for my health I needed to leave asap.\n\nProblem is, I moved out from home in September and I have a rent bill over my head. While I have money saved up its dissappearing month by month quickly. \n\nI have an associates degree in liberal arts. (Useless). And the only skill I really have is serving tables because I've done it for so long. So i feel I'm going to have to go back to serving tables again which is the last thing I wanted. \n\nI feel my only option is to get a serving job and go back to school for my associates to earn a degree. I was thinking in IT because i enjoy computers. My gf is in the process of becoming an LPN. She's 30 as well. We want to have kids and start a family \n\nI just feel like I'm on a timer. I need to rush to figure something out if I'm going to raise a family. I just don't know what path to take and its extremely overwhelming. Any input or advice would be great. Thanks in advanced. \n\nTLDR: Im about to turn 30 and i have little direction in my life.",

Iâ€™m guessing he lost track of which screen he was actually sharing, but his message was seen by everyone in the meeting. You can hear my bossâ€™s tone change immediately, after she saw the message.\n\nI feel bad for my coworker. The only thing I did for the rest of the meeting was pretend that nothing happened, but everyone knew what had transpired. Iâ€™m just wondering if there could have been anything else I should have done in this situation, and if I should be concerned since he sent the message to me.",

The more expensive ones generally aren't any better other than materials. Installing them is very easy, and even if you don't have the tools, your neighbor probably does. It's one of the few things you can change out at a rental and improve your life dramatically, just toss the old shower head in one of the drawers and reinstall before you leave. Guests will appreciate it, dating partners will appreciate it. Who doesn't love a good shower?\n\nAlso, if you have an airbnb or a guest bathroom with a bad shower head, shame on you. Go buy a nice shower head for your guests.",

        "text": "I'm in a situation where I don't know what to do. I have a very complicated dynamic in my current job due to my relatively new boss. In the past I had a good relationship with my manager and we respected each other. But then I got a new boss about 8 months ago things changed drastically and from the beginning she's kept me at arms length. From our interaction it seems she's being Machiavellian in that she sees me as apart of the old regime and because of that she does not want to let me shine. She barely delegates any work to me and so my days are extremely light. In 8 months I've probably had about 40 hours of work. But there's a benefit to that since I work from home (I'm the only one in my group that got approved for this to further keep me at arms length) as I get to accomplish all kinds of personal tasks and if I wanted I could watch movies or play video games all day. However there's a flip side to that coin in that if there are ever layoffs, even though I'm the most qualified I know I would be the first to go. \n\nNow I've always believed that if you know what you're worth, then go out and get what you're worth and find a place that values you. But in our current economy it feels like the market could collapse any day and I would be sacrificing 10 years of tenure to roll the dice on something new. When I was younger this would be a no brainer, but now I have people who depend on me and bills that I am solely responsible for so it makes this decision much more difficult. \n\nWhat do you recommend in this situation?\n\nTL;DR: I am currently in a job where I work from home with complete autonomy, but a boss who doesn't value me. Should I stay and enjoy the perks or walk away and roll the dice somewhere else even though I am the sole breadwinner. \n\nP.S.: Because I am apart of a team that's assigned to work on a consent decree  I can't simply apply out. I either have to wait until the government signs off on the work we do or get approval from 3 levels up (which is not going to happen).",
