She was really warm and encouraging, and said she would absolutely reach out more. We even made tentative plans to see a particular musical together. Fast forward a month, I haven't heard from her since. And this morning I noticed on Instagram that she went to that specific musical with another cohortmate, which hurt.\n\nI feel like I'm back in high school again. Has anyone else found it this difficult to make friends in grad school? My social life has essentially boiled down to staying home with my partner every night.

This program is a non-traditional weekend format meaning that all the classes would be held Fri, Sat, and Sun which would allow me the opportunity to work at my current job. The class size is much smaller with about 25-30 students.\n\nSchool B is 113k of just tuition. \n\nOne of the biggest issues of the physical therapy profession is the debt : income ratio.

TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nHi all, I\u2019m looking for some advice. I started grad school planning to pursue a straight PhD but switched to a masters program in a different but related field. My original plan was to continue into the PhD in the new field after defending my masters.\n\nI have two advisors, one of which pays me and the other helps me with everything else. However, after I defend my masters, the advisor that pays me and I are going our separate ways for several reasons (we are mismatched in advisor and advisee styles, and this particular advisor is often absent, and has some, interesting, communication styles, and this is difficult for me to deal with currently).\n\nMy co-advisor accepted several new students into the lab group this semester and is overwhelmed and doesn\u2019t think they can handle having any additional students full time right now, but they have told me that things can change so there is still a possibility I could work with them as a full advisor in the future, but I might have to wait until another student graduates.\n\nAnother advisor that I could potentially work with on similar work that I do now says they may have room in their group and has some proposals for funding in mind they want to submit, but they will be on sabbatical next year so I would need to talk to them after they return.\n\nThere are other options, but they do very different research so I would need to work hard to convince them that I could be an asset to their research interests.\n\nSo, right now, I don\u2019t have an advisor for a PhD and may need to wait a year before I have some options. That, my rapidly disintegrating mental health, and some comments my soon to be ex-advisor made are making me consider taking a year off or just casually taking the one class next semester I\u2019d like to take (it\u2019s only offered once every two years and I\u2019d rather not wait another couple years).\n\nLong story short on the mental health: I have some residual trauma from an abusive situation I was in for a year in undergrad that is being exacerbated by some of the toxicity in academia, and also I am dealing with frequent and intense panic attacks that are starting to ruin my life :( so taking a year off and focusing on therapy could help with this.\n\nAs for the s comments my advisor made: they mentioned that I am not independent enough of a researcher and that I am operating at the level of an upper class undergraduate instead of a graduate student. I obviously don\u2019t want this, but am unsure of how to progress to the level that I need to be at. Are there any skills or things I could focus on this next year that would get me to this next level by the time I have options for advisors again so I can start off on the right foot? I reached out to my advisor with this question and asked for clarification about what they meant because I was too shocked in the moment when they said this to ask, but I haven\u2019t heard back and am not sure I\u2019ll get a reply.\n\nTL;DR \ndon\u2019t have an advisor for PhD, but may have several options in a year, so I am considering taking a light year to focus on therapy and skill development. Soon to be ex-advisor says I am not independent enough of a researcher and am operating at the level of an upper level undergraduate instead of a graduate student, and I obviously don\u2019t want this. Have not gotten any clarification from them about what they meant or how to improve, so I\u2019m wondering what skills I can work on over the next year so I can be at the PhD level when I can start talking to potential advisors and submitting research proposals.\n(I\u2019m lucky enough to be married and in a situation where I can afford to take a light year without pay or with a part time job, so that is only a slight worry)","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678458408.0},{"title":"UMich or Columbia?","author":"Relevant-Wrangler792","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GradSchool\/comments\/11o1ior\/umich_or_columbia\/","text":"I posted a similar question here yesterday but I just admitted into Columbia GSAP this morning and Columbia and UMich are now my top contenders.

A solid 3-7 years of (maybe) being funded with a living stipend (perhaps) that would leave me barely breaking even with living expenses and definitely incapable of paying back student loans. I guess the best path would've been going straight from BS to PhD, but COVID-19 in the middle of my undergraduate years cancelled a couple of research opportunities that I would've taken advantage of otherwise; thus, I wouldn't be as strong of a candidate for PhD programs. \n\nI will be the first in my family to attend graduate school, if we can find a way to afford it.

This, along with things that I could\u2019ve done better as well. \n\nI don\u2019t see a pathway to publishing before I leave for my internship in 2.5 months, and we both agreed that spending time TAing without having clear goals set for my research will just end with me wasting more time. \n\nI am going to look for another lab to join, because I still really want to finish, but I feel like the odds of getting into a new lab, given that I have been pretty unsuccessful in this one, are slim. As I said, I still would ideally finish my degree because I love my field, but I have concluded that staying in this lab is not a good way forward in general. \n\nOther than that, it is looking like there\u2019s a high chance I will need to find a job. I have a MS in computer science, and I had a fairly successful internship last summer (they offered for me to return this summer, which I\u2019m doing, but they don\u2019t have any open full time roles due to the economic downturn). \n\nMy obvious dilemma is that I have a huge hole in my resume, and not much to show for my time as a PhD student, since everything I\u2019ve done with my advisor has been kind of unsuccessful in one way or another. I also feel like I\u2019m pretty knowledgeable about my field (multi-agent reinforcement learning), but that I don\u2019t have a lot of concrete achievements to back it up yet. Additionally, I feel like this is a niche field that doesn\u2019t offer much in industry besides pure research jobs. On top of all this, I feel like I\u2019ve forgotten a lot of the generalist knowledge I had from my MS. In summary, I feel like I\u2019m very specialized in a particular field but don\u2019t have the credentials of an expert. \n\nI\u2019m really just looking for advice on the steps I should take to start looking for a job. My target would be at least by September, since I have my internship coming up and enough savings to last until then.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678208889.0},{"title":"I just defended my Thesis.","author":"mojitron420","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GradSchool\/comments\/11kgz20\/i_just_defended_my_thesis\/","text":"Never thought this day would come, but I finally presented my defense for my MS Thesis.

I had 3 case studies, and my \"guiding question\" was a little vague - \"to understand how is the state of... [these things of] museums\" I'd say what it was but it would give me away. So it wasn't very specific, but it was a goal. The teacher didn't complain about it. \n\nI have conclusions, but none are groundbreaking. I only have 3 case studies which I mean, it's a master's. I couldn't gather more and compare all of the case studies. It was a qualitative study rather than quantitative. But the goal was to sort of represent how things are with all museums in the whole country - but of course I stated that 3 case studies wouldn't show how they are nationally but they would give us a peek into it, for further studies to go deeper. \n\nI don't know if I'm making sense.\n\nAnyway, I have some findings, I do. But I feel like they are kind of disjointed little things. Kind of like: they could be better, but I guess they could also be worse; one of the case studies was worse than the others but the people I interviewed didn't seem to care (but the people I interviewed unofficially for pilot tests DID care, which is conflicting since I'm not putting it there because it's not official ugh).\n\nI don't have a magical statement that wraps things up assertively, nicely and in a useful way.

I recently got admitted into a MSc program for CS at the same institution where I completed my undergrad. This is all well and good, but I just received a group email from my supervisor regarding allowances for travel expenses when presenting conference papers. Maybe I'm just ignorant, but I was unaware that I might be expected to travel as part of my academic duties prior to this interaction. \n\nThe problem arises from the fact that I cannot, due to a variety of personal circumstances, travel long distances or be away from home for extended periods. This is partially due to my own medical issues, as both the symptoms of my condition and the nature of my prescribed medications make travel extremely difficult. Moreover, I am the sole caretaker for an elderly relative who cannot be left alone for extended periods of time. I am listed as having a disability on my school's records, but the nature of my condition is such that nobody would know I have a problem unless I explicitly tell them. For obvious reasons, I am reluctant to make my medical history public; thus, nobody outside of the administration knows the exact nature of my disability.\n\nThis brings me to my question: how much of an issue is this likely to be? I suppose I could just opt not to submit to conference papers, but this might be challenging in CS and close many doors to me. Alternatively, I might be able to arrange a remote presentation or have a co-author present on my behalf, but this comes with its own issues. I'm also uncertain about how I should proceed with my supervisor. I haven't said anything thus far, as I don't particularly want to discuss my medical history and familial circumstances with someone I don't know very well. Is it necessary for me to discuss this with my supervisor? If so, how much detail should I give? I don't want to get in trouble for blindsiding anyone with this, but I also don't want to sacrifice my privacy or overwhelm them with too much information.","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1678129965.0},{"title":"I am currently working on a project for my grad program and I am in dire need of more participants.

Unsure if I used the right flair, didn't know what to put it under. My grad school plans have been wonky recently. I was originally planning to stay at my home University for my MS since I found an advisor I really like with a funded research project. I also got into the University of Michigan as an MS student (the place I wanted to end up going to for my PhD later). However, my original advisor is moving to Reno and while at my home university I did find an alternate advisor, there's NO funding whatsoever, not even a TAship. I figure it's not worth it to stay in a program with an advisor that wasn't my first choice and doesn't feel like is right for me anymore. So my two main options are going to UNR with the original advisor (she said she'd be happy to still take me on there and we are currently discussing the program\/funding) or the University of Michigan. If I go to UNR with her, I'd probably talk with her about applying as a PhD since it's a long move and I believe the right step for me career-wise (I live in Texas so \\~27 hour move!) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, the program I really want to end up in is the University of Michigan. I know I applied and accepted as an MS student, but lately, I've been reevaluating my career goals and of course finances. Is it possible, once accepted and attending, to be able to switch to the PhD track? I know this is contingent on the department and advisor, but I want to know if anyone has ever done anything similar. The department is having its visit day on the 31st and I'll be able to discuss with my advisor more there about her research group and everything too. I hope this makes sense since it's been super stressful for me lately and just wanted some possible insight!

I apologize in advance for the lengthy post!\n\nFor some context, I just graduated from university a semester early in December, and I'm now working full-time as a Research Associate for a well-known neuroscience institute in the US with very accomplished PIs. My plan throughout college was to go to medical school (I took all the required classes, did all the activities, was in research for 3 years, got 1 publication, etc...) but now I'm having doubts about whether I actually want to get my MD. I've taken the MCAT twice, and my most recent score is fine, but not great (I think I'd have some trouble getting into MD schools given that I'm ORM). I've taken some time to really think about if I want to retake it again before this upcoming cycle, but I just have no motivation whatsoever.\n\nOver the past 2 weeks, I've tried to draft my PS for med school apps, but I'm realizing I don't actually have a straightforward answer as to why I want to be a doctor\/go to medical school. It seems like I'm trying to force an answer to align with what adcoms are looking for in a future doctor, and now I'm worried I haven't really given med school serious thought. It just seemed like the go-to path for an undergrad like me who loves neuroscience and the brain. I should also add that I kinda skimped out on clinical volunteering in undergrad -- I got clinical experience through other activities aside from being a medical assistant in the hospital or being an EMT, and thinking about doing those things doesn't really excite me.\n\nI've shadowed psychiatrists, a neuroradiologist, and a neurologist, and while they were all rewarding experiences, I started asking myself if I'd get bored of the routine\/monotony of seeing patients every day. I also should note that every single one of these doctors told me \"it wasn't too late to change my mind\" about med school, and while I thought they were joking, I am now wondering why each doctor made the same comment. Some people really like the stability and predictability of being a practicing physician, but idk I feel like I would get bored easily.\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\n**About me:**\n\n\\- I love writing, the brain, neuroscience, passionate about mental health\/illnesses, also interested in criminal justice (thought I wanted to go to law school my first year of college lol)\n\n\\- comfortable being around people, I like being social and giving presentations gives me some anxiety but I'm able to do them fine\n\n\\- terrible at memorizing facts (this worries me if I were to go to med school), especially memorizing things I'm genuinely not interested in\n\n\\- bad at bio (I find some things interesting, but I don't really understand the bigger picture sometimes)\n\n\\- my undergrad research was in an autism lab, and my honors thesis was also about this population but using neuroimaging techniques\/fMRI scans and data (I LOVED working on this project and got the highest distinction after review)\n\n**Reasons FOR MD:**\n\n\\- job stability, very good pay\n\n\\- neuroradiology\/neurology could be interesting specialties\n\n\\- be able to prescribe medicine (idk if I really care about doing this tho?)\n\n**Concerns about MD:**\n\n\\- lot of debt and so many years of schooling including residency and fellowships... also I don't think I'm going to succeed if I have to memorize and recall things I'm not really interested in\n\n\\- dealing with patients every day would wear me out I think\n\n\\- idk if I really see myself directly helping people every day\n\n**Reasons FOR PhD:**\n\n\\- I'll get to work on what I know I'm passionate about and be intellectually curious\n\n\\- be at the forefront of science -- a step ahead of just prescribing patients medicine\/drugs -- helping future individuals indirectly rather than providing immediate care as a physician\n\n\\- not as much schooling\/time, also won't really be in debt (hopefully)\n\n\\- working in my job right now I'm seeing firsthand how well-connected neuroscientists are, and the community is really spectacular. I love how PIs collaborate with each other across the world and each one of them kinda has a \"brand\". Idk if this is a good\/correct way to think about this, but being a great neuroscientist is appealing to me because I'll be well-known for my hard work and papers, whereas being a great doctor kinda makes me well-known in my community for helping people? (Don't mean to offend anyone I'm just thinking through my values and how I find myself being fulfilled)\n\n\\- eventually will get to speak at conferences and I can see myself being really proud of my work and discoveries and wanting to speak about them\n\n**Concerns about PhD:**\n\n\\- job security? Maybe I don't want to be a professor for the rest of my life? I know some people go into consulting, I could see myself maybe going into biotech, but how likely is this? Maybe starting a company?\n\n\\- pay isn't that great? Although one of my thesis mentors who has a PhD makes close to $400k...but not sure how\n\n\\- will this degree actually be worth it? I've heard\/read mixed things\n\n\\- worried maybe I'll get bored of the *process* of research (not that I'll get bored of neuro interests, but grant writing, admin things like that)\n\nAgain, sorry for the lengthy post but I really wanted to give the full picture here. I'm really conflicted and not sure what to do... I also am just now starting my gap year and I don't know if I want to take another one.

However, the position is already creating obstacles in my ability to pursue other work on top.\n\nIn my original contract, it simply said I needed permission to do off-campus employment, but I would do 20-hours a week for my assistantship. At the time, I accepted- about a month ago. \n\nI now have an internship opportunity that is 20 hours a week. As according to my university contract, I asked for permission as appropriate and was approved. Then I accepted my internship. However, my university then came to me with some random form that now says all students employed by the university work 20hours for the university, and can only work 10 hours maximum (total of 30 hours a week) outside of the university. This is a new stipulation that was not communicated to be so I'm very sour. Of course it affects me accepting the assistantship, which was more for money than experience while my internship is for experience. \n\nI contested, but the university just kept saying they cannot change policy, do anything about it, and that there's no one further I could talk to (I talked to a dean, hr). They kind of screwed me over last minute in terms of not allowing me to make an informed decision, as well as falsely giving me approval for my internship.\n\nI am wondering if I should just lie and do my internship without telling them the fact that I'm doing 20 hours instead of 10 hours.

The PI and other staff are all great to work with. I know that I could get along for 5+ years. The lab is larger with several post docs and supporting staff.

This university is in the mountains, on the same side of the country as my family. The mountains and outdoor areas near by make the lifestyle ideal for me. The lab I\u2019m interested in is very new.

This lab is small, so I would be responsible for more support\/admin on my own projects.

I initially set out to embark on a post-bachelor's degree in accounting.  However, I quickly learned accounting was not something that I wanted to do.

I couldn't care less about bank management or financial regulations, etc.  The only thing I found remotely interesting was the focus on present values and future values of money in the first course.  FWIW, I have a 4.0 GPA in the program so far, so it's not as if I'm struggling academically.\n\nI'm afraid to quit for a multitude of reasons.  For one, I feel like it'll make me a failure at yet a 2nd program.  Secondly, I've been using this degree as a crutch, deluding myself into thinking that it's going to open up infinite, lucrative possibilities after I'm done.

Comment in question is at the bottom. \n\nRecently my PI made an extremely questionable comment to the PhD student in our lab. Some background: this is her first year; she is international, traveling here (US) from India. PI has seemed to dislike her from the beginning and seemed harder on her than anyone else in the lab. I can provide some specific examples if people think it\u2019s relevant. But, the most recent issue at hand, is a matter concerning plagiarism. The student was drafting a lit review, which our PI always has us do in our first year to gather our thoughts about our chosen topic. PI arranged weekly meetings where this student was to present her progress on the review. The first step she was instructed to do was just create a bulleted outline of useful information. The student ended up copying and pasting a lot of things from papers and gov websites into this bulleted list (with citations, but definitely copied and pasted). She then composed roughly 2-3 pages where she used this info, changing words here and there but definitely not sufficiently. Internal and end citations present. She emailed both of these documents to PI, and PI thought the words didn\u2019t sound like her own (this can be obvious since English is obviously not her first language). PI asked the student in person if she plagiarized. Student said no- she definitely has a misguided idea of what constitutes plagiarism. She genuinely believed she did nothing wrong because she included citations and changed some words. PI ran the paper through a plagiarism checker and of course it flagged pretty high for plagiarism (about 70%). Long story short, PI immediately reported the student for academic misconduct and dismissed her as a student, all in the matter of about three days. She did not even wait for the initiation of the university\u2019s investigation. \n\n**Anyway, here is the comment in question: after dismissing the student, student asked PI if there was any other path forward for them besides complete dismissal. PI responded \u201cI am in a difficult position. I have spoken to many other professors on this to get feedback. Most of the white men actually said I was being way too gentle. I see no other path forward.\u201d\n\nThis conversation is recorded (we are in a one party consent state) and I have listened to the recording in its entirety. How the heck would you interpret this comment which came out of left field?? Is she insinuating that the only reason a non white professor would disagree with her on this is because the professor was showing solidarity or something against a fellow non white person?? I really can\u2019t see what else this means.\n\nPI is a white woman if it is relevant to you.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1677638787.0},{"title":"Physics Grad School: How much should I be concerned about this, am I overthinking?","author":"zPrimeCoupling","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GradSchool\/comments\/11fftfd\/physics_grad_school_how_much_should_i_be\/","text":"I am weighing between two schools primarily.\n\nNumber 1 has twice as many faculty and students. \n\nNumber 1 has a cross training program in which I could get computer science training and even extra qualifications.

Long story short, she had a sexual misconduct complaint filed against her with the EOC at her university.

Because it was filed and investigated after she graduated, she has been told that nothing will go on her disciplinary record since she's no longer affiliated with the university.

(My gf is innocent and someone basically brought up a ton of false allegations against her, some of which she has evidence to prove her innocence.

I'm in the US for context.\n\nI did a plus-one BS\/master's at a different, similarly well ranked school. I loved the research I was doing with my MS advisor. It was interesting and definitely something I could see myself continuing to research. I also got along really well with the professor.\n\nWhen I was applying to PhD programs, I had faculty interviews with two professors at this school, Alex and Bob (pseudonyms), where I presented the research I had been doing. The two profs were both interested in advising me, and were assigned to be co-mentors, with Bob as the \"main\" mentor. Advisor decisions are not binding in year one.\n\nBob and I did not end up working well together, at all. He was dead set on an incredibly niche research area that I wasn't at all interested in, and our working styles did not click. Within just six weeks, we ended up having a major argument that resulted in us quietly severing professional ties. Alex became my primary mentor.\n\nAlex was much easier to work with and did research that was slightly more interesting, but still not anything close to what I discussed during the interview or what I highlighted as collaboration opportunities. I proposed some of those ideas again, and he told me very bluntly that they were nonviable in terms of funding and publication worthiness, and suggested some other work that I was wholly uninterested in doing.\n\nI'm beginning to think that the profs here saw that I was talented in a specific low-volume area and poached me to work on *their* research projects with my skills, and misrepresented what kinds of projects we could do during the interview phase. I'm frustrated because I got the impression across both interviews that my research experience would be similar to the awesome things I was doing during my masters.\n\nI spoke with the associate dean of the department and I'm currently struggling to find a new lab\/advisor during admission season (yikes) and with a niche skillset that is not really transferable (yikes 2). I have a fellowship through the end of December of this year but I have nothing secured beyond that. We're supposed to have an advisor by the 1 year mark and an accepted publication by the 2 year mark, and I haven't even begun research yet after a semester and a half.\n\nWhat the heck should I do? I'm seriously debating dropping out of the program when the fellowship dries up if I'm not in a place where I'm doing research I'm happy with. But even with a masters in CS I have no work experience and can't actually program very well since I am more on the math side, so the prospect of quitting and trying to force my way into industry at a disadvantage without stable income is terrifying.

This sent me in a different direction towards the MSW which I wholeheartedly love. \n\nIt\u2019s my second year of grad school within this program and I\u2019m estimated to finish in December of 2023. While going to grad school I have no choice but to work full time. I was lucky enough to be able to do my internship at my worksite. This worked out so well until I realized that I\u2019m still dealing with a narcissistic boss with possible borderline personality disorder. \n\nWhen I first started there, I was thrust into an investigation regarding this boss because people had made comments about how inappropriate she was and the derogatory comments she would make about people. I had heard her say these things and confirmed with HR. Many people have left because of her. The result of that whole experience was she probably got a slap on the wrist at best. The executive director loves her (for whatever reason) and she will remain. Okay that\u2019s fine. \n\nThis job was flexible for school and worked out well for that.

Sad situation but those were valid reasons. \n\nAnyways, my boss makes a huge deal of this situation, blaming school of the reason I didn\u2019t know. She then gets HR involved. HR originally is like I\u2019m going to investigate this clients death. Once I speak to HR it starts out about the death of the client to you aren\u2019t doing your job and now I think your a fraud and unethical and HR is going to investigate you and your entire program! I was backed into a corner. \n\nI\u2019ve been waiting a week for this bs investigation to be done with. Normally, I would have quit because my boss is toxic to work with.

Things have been a bit stressful but so far manageable.\n\nAt the end of last week my professor decided to schedule an online midterm from March 1-2 (we have a 48 hour window to take the exam). But in some weird twist of fate i happen to have a field test demo for my work during this time and  it can\u2019t be pushed back since it has been on the calendar for about a month now. The 2 are in conflict.\n\nI emailed my professor asking if I could take the exam on a later day due to this conflict and  for some more information on the exam, and his response was that I should talk to my manager about dropping this course because other activities are in conflict with it and I should consider putting in the the effort of the other students.\n\nLuckily my manager allowed me to spend the 2nd taking the exam so provided the weather doesn\u2019t go to shit I\u2019ll still have a day to take the exam.\n\nThat being said: Is it common for professors to be this unreasonable in a graduate program? Or is his response completely valid? I\u2019m more worried for a time where I can\u2019t get out of a conflict like this\n\nI guess ultimately my issue wasn\u2019t that the professor didn\u2019t allow me to make up the exam (as I can understand how that might be unfair and I was thankfully able to find a work around). My issue is that his response comes off as a rude. Not only did he not answer any of my questions about the exam information, but he\u2019s effective implying that his class takes priority over everything else and that I\u2019m putting in less effort (which I\u2019m not, with the exception of the past 3-4 lectures I\u2019ve been attending class, studying and doing the homework).

It is a program that lasts for 2 years however, I may have rushed into enrolling myself in one. Honestly, I received a lot of pressure from family members, friends, etc. It was almost expected of me to eventually do this so...I did. I found a program that seemed useful for the future and enrolled myself in it. The problem came when I realized that I did not like it at all. At first, I tried to ignore it by telling myself that I was just still burned out after graduating college and getting my BC degree, but then I realized that this feeling of misery was just a growing story. I did not enjoy any of the subjects, one of our teachers was bullying us for anything and when the exam sessions came, I was dreading studying and not in the way that all students do, but rather, I was simply not willing to work hard for it, because I couldn't help but feeling like I didn't want to be there and that I was making a mistake. Once again, I decided to keep going however I reached my wits' end last week when I realized that I no longer wanted to dedicate myself to this program and that this program is just not doing me any good. Frankly speaking, it didn't help that our teachers straight up told us that this degree would not be enough to work in the required field and that someone without a degree but official national testing, would be able to secure a job a lot easier than we would (for those who wonder, it's about translation\/ and the job of a translator) so.. putting all of this together, I decided to quit and pursue something else. I decided to go towards a career path that fits me much better and if I somehow wanted to further my education, to do it when I find a program that I have an actual interest in honestly..it felt like I was doing the right thing, the pressure was suddenly off, I was feeling good for the first time in months and I was secure with this decision until a few days ago when guilt kicked in and..well the thought of my parents being disappointed in me..so I would like to ask. Am I doing the wrong thing? People who went through a similar change of mind, what did you do?

(Roughly 60k per year in income worth of taxes)\n* Addition to my previous point, unlike my other choices, my employer has a special deal w\/ JHU where tuition is 10% off, so I'll actually have to pay the taxes for about 54k worth of additional annual income.\n\nI've highlighted my above reasons as to why JHU is my top choice. However, after looking around, I've heard that a lot of online grad programs are \"cash cow\" programs; they will admit nearly anyone in order to generate easy tuition revenue. My main concern as I've read a few times, is that these students in these programs may not get as much attention and resources as traditional students. A few comments here suggested that JHU's AAP program may be one of these programs. Wanted to know if the JHU's applied math online program is similar in this way too. If so, I may consider a different first choice.\n\nGraduates from these alleged \"cash cow\" online programs, how were your experiences? Were they much less selective? Did you get treated just as well as on-site students? Anyone with experience with the applied and computational math online program at JHU, can you give an insight on this?\n\nWhen JHU advertises this program as \"part-time, online, engineering for professionals program\", is this a red flag to look out for? Curious b\/c there's not too much discussion online on this specific JHU program.\n\nEDIT: One red flag may be that the prerequisites are not too strenuous: Multivariable calc, one advanced math course, and knowledge of a programming language. The application process for this program is not too difficult: A short 350-450 word statement of purpose, transcripts, and resume. Nothing else is required; the GRE and letters of recommendations are not required. The application process for the in-person counterpart is much more strenuous however.","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1677386118.0},{"title":"Social anxiety in graduate school","author":"brownie20","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GradSchool\/comments\/11bo44o\/social_anxiety_in_graduate_school\/","text":"Does anyone here have tips on helping with social anxiety?

She stuck to the deadline even when the TA was sick, had a meeting at midnight, and sent a bunch of urging emails.  All of three the tutors left her after a year. She used to make a student wait for hours since she forget about the meeting. There also has been a student under her supervisor filing a formal complaint. Honestly, I literally mentally collapsed when hearing that. It's totally opposite to what I saw about her. She is my role model, but it breaks down after those stories. I used to talk with her PhD students but I haven't heard anything like that (or they didn't tell me).\n\nI'm not sure how I feel right now. I learned a lot from her and actually going to have a paper as one of her co-authors (for the context, it very hard to have a paper published as an undergraduate in my field, so it's such an honor).

I am nearly done with my two-year program, and I was told by my advisor that I could complete my last seven credits over the summer, which is ideal since I won't be working at that time, but only if my grades were good as students typically only take 3 credits at a time.

There are several other students in the same boat who were all also told they could complete their degrees over the summer, but we are just now being told that we actually can't complete our degrees this summer, not because the classes aren't being offered, but basically because we're not supposed to take the 7 remaining credits all at once. They are not prerequisites. It's more of a procedural\/bureaucratic issue.\n\nI want to advocate for myself and put pressure on the university to let me finish those classes this summer. Not taking those classes will cost me money in delayed pay raises, and working full time while going to school and raising an infant has been detrimental to my physical and mental health.

Because I didn\u2019t have the time or energy or care to fucking read the damn syllabus and now I have a lot of catch up to do. My professors are terrible teachers. I haven\u2019t been able to pursue my hobbies.

However, I haven't started the thesis. I have done a lot of background research, and I wrote a proposal draft, but it needs a ton of revisions. I am also working full-time. \n\nThe problem is, I was originally on the non-thesis track. This is because my end goal isn't to work in academia. I want to be either a tech artist, or a theme park designer, and do digital art + writing novels + coding my own video games as a side gig. Nonetheless, I had to switch tracks at the last minute. \n\nMy lab couldn't fund me, because it's a very popular lab (3D Computer Graphics), so I didn't do any research for the first two years. Instead, I was just working part-time as a web developer. I switched to the thesis track last minute for 2 reasons:\n\n1) My advisor basically said that doing a thesis and research was an expectation for his students. (I made the mistake of not talking to him much earlier in my academic career.)\n\n2) I got hired full-time as a tech artist, my dream career, at my goal company. I didn't expect to get hired before even finishing school, but I did. The thesis track meant that there was 2 less classes to take, so I foolishly thought that this would be the easier option! \n\nNow, I am totally overwhelmed. I need the 40-hour weeks because I am out of cash and I need the benefits -- my university's insurance is really bad. Plus, it's my dream job, and I'd like to stay here for a very long time. I consider this job more important than school, as it was my end goal, though I still want to finish my M.S. \n\nBut add 15-20 hours per week of thesis work on top of that, and I'm just burned out. I started doing background research for the thesis in Fall 2022. Thought I could finish by this spring. I was wrong. My research area is computational fluid simulation, because I love watching water and learning about how it behaves. But this requires a strong understanding of physics and differential equations. I only have a math minor -- thus, this is very challenging for me. It took me a long time to complete my background research and proposal draft. As a result, I probably will have to extend to a fourth year. \n\nAll I want to do after working 9 AM - 6 PM is write novels and make art. I want to be creative, but I just end up coding and researching from 7 PM to bedtime, and every morning before work, and each weekend. Plus 8 hours of code per day at work. I love coding, don't get me wrong, and I love my research area, but this has totally drained my soul. \n\nOn one hand, I already have my dream job, and even though I love what I study, I am exhausted and miserable...so why continue? But on the other hand, I've been working hard for 3 years, and I want this degree. Plus, I know my company was excited when hiring me, knowing that I was working on an MS and supposedly close to completion. \n\nIf I continue and finish this degree, I think I have to dial back the intensity, and give myself time to be creative. I do exercise daily and sleep a reasonable amount, but even so, I'm out of gas. If I stick it out, how can I get through this?

Others thought it was near perfect and only needed grammatical adjustments.  \n\n\nI had contacted advisors in all of the schools I applied to, except one where I was told it was not necessary. I had demonstrated leadership experience beyond school having founded, lead or being a part of different social impact projects.  \n\n\nSo you can imagine my surprise when the rejections started rolling in.

I remember how surreal it felt getting on calls with would-be advisors to gently break the news that I would not be coming to their school.  \n\n\nI just want to say to someone struggling with rejection, that sometimes it\u2019s really not you.

Specifically, I am interested in the intersection of criminology (substance use mostly, but also want to explore other areas of crim in the future) and spatial sociology (Geographic Information Systems\/mapping mostly). I am also slightly interested in health disparities as well, but not as much as the other things I mentioned. I have found very few departments that have faculty that specialize in both of these areas, usually only one or the other. I do plan on applying to the few departments I found where there are faculty members in both areas, but I also will apply to my current program.\n\nIf I ended up staying in this current department, where I will receive my masters, and it is the same university where I got my bachelors (different degree program and department), how frowned upon would this be in the future? I'm mostly interested in staying in research. I'd prefer to stay in academia for the long-term, but I know that tenured positions are more competitive in every passing year, so I'm also open to working in applied fields as well.

This is a grad school decision post, but I think it's a little more nuanced than Rule 12)\n\nI feel like I\u2019m having a bit of a grad school decision crisis. I\u2019m looking for some general advice and also just venting. This will almost surely be a really long post.\n\nI\u2019m in an engineering field that requires an MS for most industry roles, but PhD\u2019s aren\u2019t uncommon. It\u2019s debatable if the opportunity cost of a PhD is worth it, but either an MS or a PhD would probably be fine for industry. However, academia is an equally alluring path to me. I\u2019ve had several academic mentors tell me that I\u2019d be a good fit for academia in my field, and they see me going far in it should I want to. Granted, I\u2019m not sure how true this is, but it\u2019s encouraging to say the least, and these are people I do generally really trust.\n\nSo here are my two options that I\u2019m having panic attacks over:\n\n**School A**: A PhD on the other side of the country with a faculty member that I can really only describe as a 100% match for my research interests. Based on our discussions, this faculty member would be an incredible mentor and I\u2019d have considerable autonomy to study pretty much exactly what I want. It\u2019s a dream PhD program in that sense. I could see myself using this as an excellent springboard for academia, and likely industry as well. \n\n**School B**: A MS program at a local school with a verbal understanding that I could continue on to a PhD if I want. It would be a strong advising network in an industry-relevant thesis, but it\u2019s not really as good of a fit as the other program. (But not a bad fit either). My funding is more rigid in what exactly I work on as a thesis, but it has the flexibility to stop at a MS if I want to.\n\nComplicating matters more, I have a partner in a PhD program no where near School A. My partner understands and would respect any decision I make, but 5 years is just\u2026 a lot. It seems like School B might be a safer, risk-averse option due to the flexibility\/proximity, but School A is honestly just a perfect PhD match, so I\u2019m struggling a lot here. Being in engineering with the dichotomy between academia\/industry is also tough. Any thoughts from anyone in a similar position would be welcome.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1676907387.0},{"title":"Swithching PhD program","author":"teaandmadeleine","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GradSchool\/comments\/116uttg\/swithching_phd_program\/","text":"I'm a 2nd year student in a 5-years-phd program of a not so good uni.

I was low-functioning and unhealthy from 17 to 19, high-functioning with unhealthy coping skills from 19 to 21, had 6 months of terrifyingly intense depression, and in the three years since I've been slowly but steadily getting better. I'm taking care of myself, I can work an average of 2 hours (undirected) to 6 hours (with supervision) per day. I have friends, a job, and solid people skills most of the time. On the other hand, while I'm usually functional, sometimes I'm really really not. In almost every job I've had I either got fired or was headed in that direction either because I couldn't do the work in an episode or I turned into an asshole over time. The main problem was that these were menial service jobs, and I hated them and hated myself for not doing better. I'd like to think that that wouldn't happen at something I cared about, but I don't know for sure.\n\n**Why I applied:** I had a very close friend who was applying to grad schools and was tired of me whining about how stuck I was. She offered to help me apply, and apparently I did a pretty good job.  I didn't think I would. I thought maybe it'd be motivated to get a programming job (my previous intended path), I didn't care about money for application fees, and it was better than doing nothing. I genuinely TRULY did not think I'd get in anywhere good because I've spent the majority of the last three years lying in bed and my total GPA was 2.97.\n\nBut I did. I got into a really good program. Top 10 in its field.\n\n**Why I want to go:** Because I've spent the last three years doing nothing, and this is a chance to do something. Because it's a field that's really interesting to me, and the best way to be successful is to do something you like with a lot of perseverance. Because I didn't think I could apply, then I didn't think I could get in, and now I don't think I can go.\n\n**Why I'm scared:** Because the average debt for a 2 years master's program is $80,000. I do not have the money to make it much less than that. If I'm REALLY good and REALLY smart with assistantships and whatnot maybe I could get it down to $40,000, less if I only eat rice and beans. But frankly, I'm usually not that good. I have a nightmare that goes like this: I go through grad school, I do my best, but mental illness does its thing and I drop out or get kicked out or can't hold a job after. Then I'm left back where I started with $80k in debt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI really want to go, but I've failed at a lot of things and this is something with consequences.\n\nWhat do you guys think? I'm open to any suggestions, including deferments, etc.\n\nThanks so much for your time.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1676783127.0},{"title":"I passed my qualifying exam","author":"pfftyeah","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GradSchool\/comments\/115eu72\/i_passed_my_qualifying_exam\/","text":"That's it.

I am also worried about having a very dreadful conversation with her because she thinks that I am going to immediately start my student teaching after I pass my Mtels.
