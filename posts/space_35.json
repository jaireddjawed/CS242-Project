I've been thinking about this occasionally due to the war and the nuclear threats and now again due to these news about \"unidentified objects\" (although that's not exactly the same use case) so I thought maybe I can just ask people who are more familiar with these kind of things here.",

        "text": "This year, a revolution took place above our heads in space, as a result of which military conflicts are changing drastically. From now on it will be even wilder, more blatant, more unpredictable, more science fiction.\n\n**What happened so far**\n\nHumanity has had functioning satellites for 60 years. Until a short while ago, commercial and military communication satellites were mostly one-offs, sometimes small series, built by highly specialized manufacturing companies in years of manual work. Typical unit prices were in the hundreds of millions of dollars, including the cost of launching the tons of hardware into orbit.\n\nCharges for Internet and voice telephony over the systems of previous top dogs such as Inmarsat , Intelsat , Thuraya and Viasat are geared toward users who don't have to look too hard at the money - i.e., militaries, governments, oil and mining industries and large nongovernmental organizations. The militaries of the larger space nations have their own systems, but they operate on the same principles and often with very similar satellite hardware as their commercial equivalents.\n\nAnd all of these systems - with one exception, which we'll look at in a moment - operate with a few satellites in geostationary orbit at about 36,000 kilometers above the equator. There they \"stand\" - as seen from Earth - always in the same place in the sky, able to illuminate large areas with their radio signal and communicate there with relatively expensive terminals. Data and calls are transmitted via the satellite to a small handful of ground stations, from where they are fed into the terrestrial fiber optic network. While the market for such services is not small in absolute terms, it is more of a niche business compared to the revenues of typical telecommunications companies that offer mobile communications and Internet lines.\n\n**Vulnerable single pieces**\n\nFrom a military perspective, communications via large geostationary satellites has one key advantage - availability in many otherwise underserved areas of the Earth's surface, including the oceans - and a long list of disadvantages.\n\nThe three most important: the available bandwidth is rather limited, the antenna must point at least roughly in the direction of the satellite, and the few handfuls of satellites are priority targets for the respective adversary in the event of a major war.\n\nAll states with significant space programs have tested anti-satellite weapons. The visible, successful tests have been directed against satellites orbiting in low orbits. However, there is ample evidence that methods for disrupting or destroying geostationary systems are also being planned and built. There are enough launches with classified payloads into geostationary orbits or nearby orbits that it is plausible that malicious (sub)satellites are among them. In the event of war, these could approach enemy satellites to destroy them or, more likely, cause them to spin or electromagnetically jam.\n\nModern major power armies are barely functional without satellites. (We'll just leave out GPS, Galileo and similar navigation systems here, that would be going too far). The prospect of losing significant parts of the ability to communicate with one's own units right at the beginning of a conflict is a major headache for strategists. During Russia's attack on Ukraine, a geostationary satellite system used by the Ukrainian army for its communications was flattened by a digital attack right at the beginning.\n\n**Instructive failure: Iridium**\n\nThere is one major exception to the principle of communication via a few satellites, the Iridium system. Iridium works on the basis of dozens of orbiters that fly only about 781 kilometers high and communicate with each other in space of radio. Calls and data are relayed from satellite to satellite until the connection between the ground station and the telephone is established. However, Iridium was conceived, built and launched at a commercially and technically maximally inopportune time, around the turn of the millennium.\n\nOn Earth, cellular networks were springing up in population centers at the time, and high-speed data connections were becoming increasingly important. With system costs of over $5 billion, the market for Iridium was far too small for the per-minute prices that could be achieved. Data rates were paltry, and so the company went bankrupt, nearly taking its parent company Motorola down with it. In the end, the U.S. government bought the system from the bankruptcy estate for a token amount. The military, by far the largest customer, ensured continued operation. The Iridium story is told in epic breadth in the very readable book Eccentric Orbits.\n\nBut what Iridium had proven, despite its commercial failure and woefully inadequate data bandwidth, was a principle that dampened the military's worries about a decapitation strike against communications satellites. Many small satellites communicating with each other in space are much more difficult and expensive to destroy than a few large ones. Small satellites in low orbits are much faster and cheaper to replace than the geostationary one-offs.\n\nAfter the bankruptcy of Iridium, it became relatively quiet for quite a while about the previously announced projects for so-called mega-constellations. From time to time, big plans were announced in the press, a few very daring investors tried their luck, but the big breakthrough failed to materialize for cost reasons.\n\n**A new game – Starlink**\n\nUntil the venture capital-funded startup SpaceX appeared on the scene with the Starlink system and completely changed the rules of the game.\n\nThe feasibility of a commercially viable mega-constellation depends essentially on five factors:\n\n* Low launch costs into orbit.\n* Low costs for manufacturing and operating the satellites.\n* High data bandwidth with low latency.\n* Usefulness to a solvent military.\n* Cheap, uncomplicated terminals.\n\nThe technological leap that SpaceX used to dramatically drive down launch costs was the reusability of the Falcon9 rockets. While competitors have to build and pay for a new rocket every launch (which then burns up or sinks into the ocean), SpaceX now gets over a dozen launches per booster (with some refurbishing, of course). Combined with relatively low development costs (half of which were borne by the government), this results in dramatically reduced prices per kilogram of payload weight and a launch cadence that was previously impossible.\n\nConsequently, SpaceX launches more rockets per year than all of its remaining competition; boosters that have been launched so many times as to potentially increase the likelihood of launch failures are used to launch Starlink satellites. Their loss, due to their relatively low cost, is easier to absorb and insure in case of doubt than that of an expensive customer satellite.\n\nWith the Starship, which is currently still under development, even drastically reduced launch costs will be possible.\n\nThe second significant breakthrough realized by SpaceX for Starlink is the assembly line production of satellites. The technical details are only partially known, but what is apparent points to an approach that takes modern industrial electronics mass production as its model, viewing the individual satellite as a wear part where appropriate. If the reported cost of well under $500,000 each is accurate (other figures are much lower again), the Starlink orbiters would be at one-hundredth the price of conventional low-orbit satellites with similar performance parameters.\n\nThe price drop due to series production is also seen in other manufacturers, for example for smaller constellations of photo satellites, but not in this dimension. The low price and high production output of well over 100 satellites per month - combined with the low cost per launch, where up to 60 of the relatively small satellites are launched at a time - makes a mega-constellation with several thousand sats possible at all. At the time of publication of this column, there are already over 3000 Starlink satellites in orbit.\n\nThe current generation of Starlink sats contains laser links, each of which allows satellites in orbit (i.e., flying behind each other in a single orbit) to communicate with each other at high bandwidth and very low latency. The speed of light in space is higher than in terrestrial optical fibers. Data packets from a terminal on the ground are radioed to a sat in line of sight, from which they are passed along the laser chain in orbit until they arrive at a sat that is within range of a ground station. There they are radioed to the ground and forwarded by the ground station to the Internet. If a sat sees the terminal and a ground station at the same time, the data is radioed directly to the ground station via the sat.\n\nTo somehow get an intuitive picture of how large and complex Starlink is, it is recommended to spend a few minutes with a simulation that shows the satellites on their orbits, the laser links between them and the radio links to the ground stations.\n\n**The beginning of SkyNet**\n\nSo what makes the Starlink system so interesting for the military? Besides the usual communication requirements, it's the ability to remotely control large swarms of drones in the air, on water, and on land with low latency and good reliability. With the low delays for data transmission made possible by the low orbit and laser links, controlling a boat or flying object remotely is not a problem. The necessary space and power requirements - the Starlink antenna is slightly larger than a sheet of A3 paper and consumes about 50 watts of power - are feasible on a variety of medium and large military drone models. We're not talking about the small quadcopters often seen in the press in Ukraine frontline operations, but slightly larger devices that can fly or float for long periods.\n\nThe Ukrainian military has shown where it is headed with attacks on Russian naval bases with unmanned bomb boats that quite obviously carry a Starlink antenna on their tail.\n\nThe fact that military use was at the center of planning considerations for Starlink from the beginning and is not a random \"the street finds its uses\" phenomenon is often glossed over. The cross-financing of SpaceX development costs by the U.S. government via subsidies, investments and launch contracts is already a clear indication. But as soon as the first small batch of Sats was in orbit, an intensive, well-funded test program began to test and optimize its suitability for the military.\n\nFrom the U.S. Air Force's perspective, Starlink is a dream come true. At last, a robust way to control drones around the world without much effort, and transmit their surveillance video streams live and without delay to the situation center on the other side of the world, that is hardly vulnerable to enemy attack.\n\nSomewhat surprising, however, was the massive use of Starlink by Ukrainian ground forces and government agencies following the Russian attack. The thousands of Starlink terminals delivered to Ukraine through a variety of channels after the war began enable a form of \"networked warfare\" that had not previously existed for small armies. Virtually every unit in the Ukrainian army has a robust, hard-to-interfere-with Internet connection through Starlink, which in turn enables tactics such as quadcopter livebiler transmission and artillery targeting apps.\n\nThe importance of Starlink to Ukrainian defense became clear when problems arose during the recent recaptures of Russian-occupied territory. Contrary to the uninformed gossip reported in the press that Elon Musk had made a deal with Putin and would shut down Starlink for Ukraine, the reality on the ground was much more exciting.\n\nFrom what I was told by people on the ground, the unavailability on the front lines was not malice on Starlink's part, but a side effect of the surprisingly rapid successful advance of the Ukrainians. The Starlink terminals contain a GPS receiver, which the antenna uses to determine its position and then uses so-called geofencing to decide whether or not it will work in that area. To prevent Russian occupiers from simply using Starlink devices in their turn, the territories they hold are closed to Starlink.\n\nNow, however, the Ukrainians had advanced so quickly that the new borders and frontlines could not yet be accounted for in the geofence settings. The Ukrainian units had simply advanced into territory still closed to Starlink, and unaware of the processes and technical delays, the soldiers naturally suspected the worst. (As far as I was told, there have been no such problems since.) The misdiagnosis was then compounded by the usual distortions of social media, press writing off each other, and hyperventilating \"experts\" because at the same time Starlink was trying to extort more money from Western governments for Ukraine to use the system.\n\nIn early December, the tests and the rather unplanned use in Ukraine turned into a concrete SpaceX offer for the military: Starshield.\n\nTo correctly interpret the sparse information on the website, you need all the context explained above. What SpaceX has in mind with Starshield will completely transform the military use of space. In practical terms, Western militaries will be offered the entirety of SpaceX's and Starlink's capabilities in a highly customizable package:\n\nCheap satellites that can be rapidly manufactured in large numbers and, depending on the model, can also take high-resolution images and video from orbit, intercept radio signals (SIGINT) and use radar to detect objects on the ground (SAR). Inexpensive launch of very large numbers of these satellites, which may be difficult to distinguish from normal Starlink satellites.\n\nIntegration into the existing Starlink communications system with extra encryption for data transmission, including laser links and ground stations, to get drone data, satellite images, intercepted radio signals and radar data to receivers on the ground in virtually real time.\n\nFor military operations, this represents a fundamental paradigm shift. While it is currently still possible to find gaps, such as in satellite imagery or SAR coverage, by closely monitoring the spy satellites of opposing powers and exploit them for unobserved action, this will be virtually impossible in the future.\n\nA spy mega-constellation that covers the relevant parts of the planet around the clock can probably be obtained for the same price as one or two of the large reconnaissance satellites cost just a few years ago, due to the cost reduction at SpaceX. The maximum possible resolution is probably not quite as high, but that is more than compensated for by the permanent coverage provided by the large number of sats and the integration of optical, radar and radio reconnaissance and real-time transmission, if necessary, directly to units in the field.\n\n**Be faster than the enemy**\n\nOn a technical level, Starlink/Starshield operates its sats completely differently than previous providers. Instead of treating them as individual precious uniques, the thousands of orbiters are seen more like servers in a cloud data center. There are weekly software updates of all components, and if a few satellites fail, that's not a big problem for now, because there are still a few thousand others. The dynamic nature of software development also means that changes can be made very quickly - across the entire fleet. During the Ukraine war, there was at least one update to render ineffective Russian jammers that had been interfering with Starlink signals. It's probably been an ongoing silent battle between nerds on both sides ever since.\n\nAn extremely rapid succession of new attack methods and defenses directed against them has been \"normal\" in the field of electronic warfare for a very long time. Until now, however, such a round in the virtual arms race lasted months rather than days. The acceleration of the cycle for defenders created by the way the Starlink satellites operate is a significant advantage for Western militaries in future conflicts.\n\nHowever, more dynamic software cycles may also pose a risk for software-based attacks against infrastructure. SpaceX really needs to get a good handle on its processes and securing its internal networks here to avoid risking a total failure like Viasat. What is known about the software, hardware, architecture, design principles and handling of reported security vulnerabilities indicates an above-average level of security (which is of course no guarantee).\n\nOf course, China is watching developments very closely. To make clear the considerations to which the elimination of the usefulness of targeting individual U.S. satellites in the event of a Taiwan war leads, simulations for clearing entire orbits with nuclear weapons have been published. The idea is to use a nuclear detonation at the upper boundary of the atmosphere to accelerate the gas particles still there upward, where they form a radioactive cloud at the orbit altitude relevant to Starlink. Satellites that fly into this cloud would be gassed or destroyed. After a while, the cloud dissipates. That the so uncontrollable satellites would finally trigger a Kessler syndrome seems not improbable.\n\nStarlink and Starshield are at the beginning of a series of trends that will change low-Earth orbits forever. The military opportunities presented by cheap launches and satellites are significant and just beginning. It certainly won't make the times we live in more peaceful or safer, but it will definitely make them even more \"interesting.\"\n\nhttps://steadyhq.com/en/realitatsabzweig/posts/e3aa3613-eb2c-4b6b-94f9-e6af27b9c153",

However everything I find specifies that mass increases as you 'approach the speed of light'. I have calculated that you would reach around 750000m/s if you were to travel to Mars. Is this close enough to the speed of light that I would have to consider the relativistic effects of velocity, or am I still within the constraints of traditional mechanics, or is it dependent on the mass of the objects? I'm struggling a bit and can't find a clear answer, any help would be appreciated.",

I have also attempted to search up any other sightings that people might have had yesterday and thus far none are reported. If you want to direct me to other subreddits, I really wouldn't be opposed.\n\nWhat I saw occurred in Phoenix, AZ over the SR-51 southbound, just after Exit 7 for Northern Ave @ approximately 9pm. It was a streak that actually came in relatively low and very fast (an actual blur) from directly overhead then somewhat \"fizzled out\" from sight while seeming to tumble out of its flightpath. Mind you, when I say it \"tumbled\" I mean it rushed over me and did a helical spiral or \"barrel roll\" then disappeared from view. The light from it was something of a soft yellow like you might see from an incandescent lightbulb. It was not blinding bright, but more of a glow. Suffice to say this made other drivers that noticed let off the gas for a few moments to take in what just happened.\n\nDoes this sound like a meteorite to anyone?",

When one of the brighter points just disappeared. I thought I was looking at a star, but unsure if maybe it was a meteorite/comet or not even questioning a plane. To my eye it wasn’t moving and didn’t have any aviation light patterns. Any star gazers or observers know/have any idea what it could have been. From my memory now 10 minutes on,  I’m certain it was a stable light source, didn’t seem to flicker to burn bright, but just seem to very rapidly, within a second pull inwards to a point and dissapear. It was crazy. \n\n\nTldr; aid in ID a space phenomena I witnessed.",

        "text": "So I've been wondering how good is the potential of orange dwarf stare in holding complex life around its planet or a moon.\n\nSo from the research I've done it seems red dwarves have less potential to be a host of complex life than orange dwarves the reason being red dwarf star bombard their tidally locked planets with a lot of radiation and the due that planets probably won't have large oceans like earth which are important factor for the emergence of life.\n\nSo just how better are orange dwarf stars than red ones do thier planets have high percentage of water like earth and how much uv lights will the planet get compared to earth can you see potential for life around orange dwarf.\n\nAlso there these stars called brown dwarves which are considered the coldest stars they are constantly cooling but can complex life emerge around a brown dwarf?",
