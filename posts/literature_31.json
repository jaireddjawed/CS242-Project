        "text": "In the 5th chapter of Portrait, Stephen begins to refer to his soul in a feminine context. Later in the chapter, Stephen claims that 3 things are needed for beauty in art: Integritas, Consonantia, and Claritas (Wholeness, Harmony, and Radiance) *edit* or rather, Aquinas claims that and Stephen agrees. Is it a coincidence that Joyce attributes the soul in feminine terms, and also defines beauty with 3 Latin words of female gender classifications? I don't know much about gender in Latin vocabulary.\n\nI am having some contradictory thoughts on the topic: Throughout Chapter 1, the binary nature of childhood is explicit: On/off, hot/cold, dead/alive, in/out. In fact, it seems that Stephen's entire childhood is expressed in binary terms. Later, in Chapter 4, Stephen defines religion in binary terms as well - You either have Grace, or you do not. You are either a Virgin, or you are not, Good/Evil, heaven/hell, etc. However, during the 'bird girl' epiphany, Stephen abandons the binary perspective for one significantly more gradient, which I understood as Stephen escaping the binary, restrictive nature of the Church.\n\nIn Chapter 5, Stephen's world view has expanded and matured. He no longer thinks of things in a binary, duelist way - except that Stephen's soul, and the souls of others are expressed in feminine terms. Then shortly after, he defines beauty in art in such feminine vocabulary. Does anyone have any thoughts or insight on these topics? (for sake of this discussion, lets treat Gender as a binary concept - as I believe that's how Joyce described it). \n\nI'm also having trouble internalizing what Joyce is trying to say about the duelist, binary nature of his world. It's clear that Church and State can be reduced to a binary foundation - like virginity, one is either a patriot, or they are not. My biggest question is this: How does masculinity and femininity relate to the binary, duelist world that Joyce paints for the Church and the State? Is this binary nature of the universe something that is inescapable, even for Stephen? Are there any publications specifically about Joyce's binary descriptors in Portrait that I could read? If this is simply too broad a topic for discussion, lets restrict it to just the 1st question I raised about the female Latin words used and Stephen's description of his soul in feminine terms. \n\nSorry for the long post. Cheers everyone, I hope this is a good conversation topic for some of you",

        "text": "First of all, I've read [the poem](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/50579/the-ladys-dressing-room). I must admit, that whatever is its meaning and intention, it is masterful crafted and at the end, pretty funny, with its satirical use of hyperbole, metaphores and description of human bodily exertion. I won't lie, it was a fun read.   \n&amp;nbsp;       \n\nThe synopsis is that Strephon sneaks into his lover Celia's room. At first, he likens Celia to a Goddess (notice the stereotypical classical Greek names), but then he finds all her dirt cosmetic products, vividly described in the most grotesque language possible. The climex is when he finds and peers into her crapper, which is described like Pandora's box.     \nThe last few verses describe how thereafter, Strephon can't look at a beautiful woman without being reminded that they are human amd gross too.        \n&amp;nbsp;        \n\nAfter reading, I delved into various interpretations. First of all, there's the feminist reading: the poem is meant to criticize \"womanly vanity\" and display woman as crooks that use various ointments to achieve an illusion of beauty.       \nAnother reading views it as mostly mocking Strephon and his initial naiveté, as he views Celia as a goddesses, but in truth, she's only human like him. In that reading Strephon signifies society and how it views the ideal woman, and Celia signifies women, who are just human like man, and all the same gross.        \n&amp;nbsp;        \n\nI believe that it's a combination of the two. It's probable that Swift was misogynist, as it was the 18th century after all and so, I think it was in part a misoganyistic attack on \"female vanity\". But I think he also wanted to satirize how in art and back in the time, woman were viewed in an idealizing eye.       \nIt sort of reminds me that copypasta where the guy was so horrified to discover his girlfriend was shitting that he kicked her out and vowed never to be with a woman that shits.       \nWhat do you guys think?",
