        "text": "Hello guys,\n\nI am trying to build an automatic current sensing power switch, to command a shop-vac.\n\nWoodworker John Heisz has posted an article about a simple design here : https://ibuildit.ca/projects/automatic-load-sensing-switch/\n\nHe feeds a 1.5V AC signal from a few diodes on the mains into a transformer that increases that voltage so it can be used to drive a relay.\n\nI tried and failed to build this. I think my issues may come from the fact that I am in Europe with 240V mains and hence the primary windings of my transformers have a higher resistance than the equivalent transformers you can find in the US or Canada. The voltage on the output of the transformer dramatically drops once I connect the (very small) relay.\n\nMy question is, what kind of characteristics should one try to find in a transformer to build that kind of circuit ?\n\nThanks.",

So basically the idea is to charge and discharge this capacitor inside the snubber circuit to track the triangle reference current, but the thing is that I don't know why there's too much voltage across this capacitor. If I'm correct, the snubber will always see the difference between 12-pulse rectifier output voltage and HVDC Link voltage, and this difference should be a bit closer than 1 million volts.\n\nAny comment on this would be appreciated!",

So we bought a huddlecam joystick to control the cameras with. We assumed that we could dasiy chain the cameras to the joystick using rs232 because the joystick had a port for that and the cameras both have in and out ports. However we can only control the primary camera. We have a rs232 cable running from the joystick to the 1st camera and going into the in port, then a cable coming out of the out port to the next camera's in port. I have seen posts on other forms saying it is not possible to daisy chain rs232. So why do my cameras have in and out ports? Do you know of any way it is possible for us to control both cameras separately? Any help would be much appreciated.\n\nEdit: The joystick has selectors for cam1 - cam4, so it can control multiple cameras.\n\nCamera models:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BI79TM8/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_r532AbGP1QWYJ\nJoystick model: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01K32H3B8/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_j632AbE44V679\n\nPs.

Is the flat band diagram the diagram as soon as we bring our metal and semiconductor material together. Is that a snapshot of the moment they touch? And is the equilibrium band diagram after diffusion occurs? I am confused by the two in general and don't know what they tell us. Here is what they will look like from googling:\n\n[Pic 1](https://imgur.com/Zn31DP7)\n\n[Pic 2](https://imgur.com/pEGfncr)\n\nI know how to find ФF, but that doesn't really help much with understanding these diagrams...\n\nAlso, how can we tell what regime the diagram will be in from the given information?

How can we say anything about the regions without an applied voltage?",

IE. If I have a very large common \"library\" but projectx/ only uses the counter it would only build the counter part of it and not everything? If then projecty/ needs the counter and a hex -&gt; 7seg \"entity\" then it would compile the 7seg \"component\" and find that the counter was already compiled and so it wouldn't need to compile it again.\n\nAny suggestions would be great.\n\nedit: Solved\n\nso first we set up the libs using vlib and vmap.

In the reference design they show a schematic (http://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/tidraz7 ), but I am not sure if I can just replace the IC in the reference design with the BQ51050B. Would anyone know if this is what they intend for me to do? Also, if I were to call them is there a good way to go about having these questions answered?\n\nThe secondary issue is that I am using EagleCAD to make the board, and although element14 provides some Texas Instruments Libraries, the provided libraries do not include the BQ51050B. In light of that, I was wondering if there are any simpler ways to incorporate this wireless charging IC short of just manually creating a new device in Eagle.\n\nI know that's a lot of information, but I'd really appreciate your help!\n\nThank you!\n\n",

This chip has a configurable HFPLL, HFLNA, HFPAD integrated inside the IC to mix an X band signal down to an IF in the frequency range of a typical SDR. Here is the datasheet and Reference Manual: https://github.com/myriadrf/LMS8001-docs\n\n\nThe second option would be to design the RF chain myself and use discrete components. Something like the following: http://www.analog.com/en/technical-articles/small-form-factor-satcom-solutions.html Here, the ADI engineers suggest using components like the HMC751, HMC292ALC3B, HMC1131, HMC1040, HMC641 and others. An RF engineer would design these into a circuit with matching networks, carefully laid out RF signal paths, and possibly a microcontroller to turn components on, or do RF switching / bypassing. Something along the lines of the front end card in the following video: http://www.analog.com/en/education/education-library/videos/5236120764001.html\n\nI'm looking for advice on how to make a qualitative judgement on the performance of each approach. I know about intermodulation products, OIP3, IIP3, 1-db compression point, noise figure, gain, etc.., but I don't feel like I can really look at the datasheets of the LMS8001a vs the individual ADI components and have a solid understanding of the strengths and limitations of each approach. I have a good bit of experience with the AD9361, I know that those RFICs are doing all these same steps internally, but the signals I've worked with have always been close enough to the \"DSP textbook\" signals that it has never been a primary concern.  \n\nHow would you go about examining the LMS8001a vs. the custom ADI solution? What would you look for? What are the advantages/limitations of each. How would you aggregate individual components' metrics into a some sort of system-wide performance?\n",

The problem is for sure with the motherboard since i tried different rams, cpus, psu, gpus and it also persists even when i remove everything from the motherboard. With my cheap no brand multimeter i performed some continuity tests on all capacitors and found 6 that would beep, i don't really trust the meter so i switched to ohm measurement and while good caps would go down and then slowly go up in resistance, those 6 stayed at 0. How likely is it that 6 polymer capacitors would short circuit at the same time?

If I go to U of U I would try to get stationed at Hill AFB. I think the closest things to my planned degree at Hill would be cable and antenna systems 3D1X7 (so I can work with RF--I have a ham radio license), electrical systems 3E0X1, anything cyber 3D0X4, 9S100, avionics, etc. Would any of these be a good route to put me in an engineering career working with spacecraft?\n\nI think space systems operations 1C6X1 might be a better fit for me compared to the other jobs. I think that it would get my foot in the door of working for a defense contractor in the space industry which is my ultimate goal for after school. Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure that wouldn't be an option at Hill AFB which is why I'd try for a 1C6 job at Buckley and go to school at CU Boulder.\n\nMy ASVAB is not a limiting factor for jobs, and I'm willing to take the EDPT if 9S1/3D0 would be good fits for me.\n\nSorry for the military jargon in this post, but I'm hoping that any enlisted or prior service people can help me out!

Any suggestions on how to rectify this? \n\nNote: I used 47k resistor nstead of trimpot set to 47k\nMy [circuit](https://drive.google.com/a/illinois.edu/file/d/1B8c13oQ7729ZDvpwaOUn68_K-QzhzHPr/view?usp=drivesdk)",

I want to be able to build something that will be on par or better than a GoPro with regard to video quality. \n\nDoes anyone know of any books, videos or projects that they can point me to to reference &amp; learn more? \n\nI am less concerned with size (minaturization) of the finished video camera and more interested in learning how to improve the quality of the video being captured.\n\nThanks for any leads all!",
