One of the engravings I want is a knock knock joke (I know it sounds kinda stupid, but it's a pretty decent pun in danish, and most people get something funny engraved on the inside of their cap), and this is where my problem occurs. For some reason, the website where the caps are designed, won't allow me to insert the apostrophe in \"who's\". This wouldn't be a problem, since I can just write \"who is\" instead, right? Wrong, because it exceeds the character limit. \n\nHere's my question: Would it be best to write \"Whos\", \"Who s\" or something completely else? Any advice would be extremely helpful!

Are there certain circumstances you would use one version while using another version in other circumstances? \n\nWhile most news organizations have been using \"Dr. Ford,\" the New York Times seems to prefer \"Dr. Blasey\" or \"Christine Blasey Ford.\"  [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/23/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-christine-blasey-ford-testify.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/23/us/politics/brett-kavanaugh-christine-blasey-ford-testify.html)\n\nI'd appreciate any light you could shed on the appropriate rules for referring to married women especially when their educational level entitles them to honorific titles.

However, if both X and Y happen, should they do the action?\n\nIf the word \"either\" was present before I mention X then it would be clear that the instruction is referring to one and not to both events. That would seem to indicate that the lack of the word \"either\" implies that it could be either or both of X and Y.\n\nOn the other hand, people often feel the need to elaborate upon the word \"or\" alone, with the phrase \"and/or\". \"And/or\" is not generally used in formal publications, but its common use seems to indicate that the word \"or\" by itself precludes both events from occurring. Therefore, the action in the instruction would not be performed if both X and Y occur.",
