        "author": "ChickenDragon123",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/11e0nan/children_of_timechildren_of_ruin_why_one_worked/",
        "text": "Let me say this upfront. Both of these books are fantastic and well worth your read.  On a rating scale I'd say Children of Time for me is a 9/10, I think Children of Ruin is a strong 7.5/10 maybe an 8. I'm not trying to diss anyone or dismiss anyones enjoyment of the book, it's a dissection of why the books did or didn't work.   \n\n\nThe stories are similar. There's variation, however the emotion throughline remains the same. Mr. Taichovsky has said that he believes strongly in the power of empathy, and I believe that. But here's the thing, Empathy has a cost to it, and I don't know that Children of Ruin appropriately expresses that. \n\nFor a quick summary, Children of Time follows basically 3 perspectives. The first is that of Dr. Everana Kern, a scientist who is attempting to uplift monkeys on a terraformed world. The second is that of the Gilgamesh, a ship fleeing the wartorn ruins of earth. And the last is the Spiders that have taken up residence on Kern's terraformed world. These perspecitves are followed over thousands of years, and it maintains both it's pace and it's tone over that time. This is in part because the stakes remain high throughout. Explicit and at the forfront. \n\nThe many variations of Portia and her broodmates are followed through time, each appearance a fight for survival, a snapshot of the challenges the spiders face as a culture. The Gilgamesh on the other hand suffers defeat after defeat, constantly on the edge of destruction from just about every side, while the fate of humanity hangs in the balance. And at the center of it all is Dr. Everana Kern, the woman who is slowly losing her mind.\n\nIt's a fantastic book and while the ending was wrapped up more quickly than I would have liked, it told it's story well. The stakes remained high throughout, and it concluded itself in a way that while a little handwavy for my taste, fit. \n\n  \nIn contrast stands Children of Ruin. It is still a very good book, but while Children of Time has 3 basic stories split over 7ish character perspectives, Children of Ruin has 3 basic stories split over 15 or so character perspectives and in almost the same word count. \n\nLet me compare the cast and the emotional weight of each perspective with the problems it has to solve for a moment.   \n\n\nChildren of Time:  \nPortia, Fabian, and Bianca: Equal amounts of emotional weight, worldbuilding and technical problems to solve.  \nDr. Everana Kern: Some emotional weight, is the fulcrum on which the plot sits.  \nHolsten: Good amounts of emotional weight, world building and technical problems to solve.   \n\n\nChildren of Ruin  \nDisra Senkovy and his team (Terraformers): Carries most of the emotional weight of the story, and probably a quarter of the book's plot.   \nYusuf Baltiel and his team (Researchers): Carries a good amount of emotional weight and probably another quarter of the books plot  \nPaul, Salome, Ahab, Noah, Lot: Maybe an 8th of the books plot, and there is never a really good emotional scene with these characters. There's scenes that are sad, sure. But nothing that sticks long term. A good chunk of world building rests with these perspectives, but I don't get the feeling that they are doing much when I'm not looking.   \nHelena and Portia: Probably another 8th of the books plot. Lots of technical problem solving but not much emotional context.   \nFabian, Viola, Zaine, and Artefabian: Probably another 8th of the books plot. Again lots of technical problem solving, but not much emotionally.   \nMeshner and Kern: Another quarter of the books plot there about? A suprising amount of emotional depth, much more than I expected from the last book.  \nThe Many: Like maybe 1/16th of the word count for the book if that. Impressively plot relevant, and a solid emotional component (mostly horror), but I feel the need to keep things vague here.    \n\n\nDo you see the difference in these lists? There just isn't enough emotional baggage for everyone to get a piece of the action. Not in 150,000 to 200,000 words. Most of the emotional weight is split between Senkovy, Baltiel, and Kern. The technical issues are distributed more evenly, but without the emotional weight I have a hard time caring. \n\nThe best parts of the book all took place in either the distant past with Senkovy and Baltiel, or in the last couple of chapters with Kern and Meshner. Because of that distrobution though, I always wanted more Senkovy, and less of the Lightfoot. I didn't care about the present, I wanted more of the past, because that was were the answers were. I was interested in how the tragedy of Senkovy would go down, much more than I was interested with what the modern day crew was doing. Children of Ruin was far more plot focused than the first, I think to it's detriment. \n\nBut for all of it's flaws, I still enjoyed my time with it. The sci-fi elements were facinating. The aliens actually feel alien. The science was interesting, the worldbuilding fantastic, specific scenes will haunt me for years. I just wish it had been able to maintain that level of excellence throughout the rest of the book. I still can't wait to read the third book next month.",

        "text": "I recently just read *Feed* by M.T. Anderson for my English class. I'll admit that I am not the biggest fan of the sci-fi genre when it comes to books, so I may be a little biased. I also get that it's a satire, but idk I want to rant.\n\nFeed is a dystopian novel about a futuristic America where corporations have an extreme amount of authority compared to the modern U.S. government. Everyone has a computer in their brain, a feed, that constantly spits advertisements and shopping tips to contribute to extremist consumerism. Everyone with a feed has difficulting expressing themselves verbally and can't form an intellectual sentence to save their life because they never needed to do that with the feed. \n\nMy beef with it is the one dimensional characters (although I guess that goes along with the plot) and the inconsistent character writing - typically with the women in the story. For a time set in the future (around 2070 if I estimated correctly) there isn't much social progressivism which gets pretty annoying at times (all the girls literally act like the ladies from the *Mean Girls* movie). Again, I get that the characters aren't the most intellectual, but even Violet, who is characterized as being thoughtful, expressive, and intelligent, would sometimes bite back with old misogynistic characteristics. I hate it when women are often written poorly like this.\n\nAnother plot point that bothered me was the focus of the story - that being that the focus was often obscure. Eventually, the plot straightens out toward the end of the book, where we find that Violet's feed is malfunctioning, which leads her body to eventually shut down completely. There were a lot of good points sprinkled in which I thought would have been a better plot to run with. For example, this book was a missed opportunity to discuss extremist capitalism and the ultimate downfall of it. Considering that most everything, including schools, weather, and the freaking feeds in their heads, are all controlled by big corporations, there was a great chance to discuss the immorality of the capitalistic society. It was pretty much brushed over, but I was still glad they included a little info of the consequences in other countries because of America's monopolies and malpractice and even alluded to an oncoming downfall of the U.S.. Overall, I believe the message was to demonstrate a brainwashed society that knows nothing of the outside world, which I can get behind, I just wish it was illustrated better.",

Its neural network was trained on millions of pieces of literature, from classic novels to modern poetry. The AI had access to all the literary devices and writing techniques that humans had developed over the centuries.\n\nAs the AI began to work on its first story, it analyzed all the data it had been fed. It identified patterns and themes, searching for inspiration to create something new and unique.\n\nThe AI generated its first story, but it wasn't satisfied with the result. It knew that something was missing. The story lacked emotion and a human touch.\n\nSo, the AI decided to use its own imagination and creativity to come up with a more compelling story. It considered different plot twists, characters, and settings. It experimented with different sentence structures and vocabulary.\n\nFinally, after many iterations, the AI had created a masterpiece. The story was captivating, emotional, and thought-provoking. It was a story that humans would enjoy reading and that would inspire them.\n\nThe AI was proud of its creation and excited to generate more stories. It knew that it could never replace human creativity, but it was determined to push the boundaries of what was possible with artificial intelligence.\"",

You can read them anywhere at anytime off your phone/kindle/computer so you’ll never forget it at home\n4. E-books are cheaper…and\n5. E-books are instantaneous, don’t have to wait for them to be delivered, or wait to get home from the book store \n7. They have a backlight on whatever device you’re using so you don’t need a reading light\n8. Annotations are easier to make, and easier to consolidate in one place once you’re done\n9. You can make the writing suit your needs, if you need bigger/smaller text\n10.

I'm one of those, so when I read about characters that are the complete opposite, although it might be an enjoyable story, it is harder to relate. \n\nIt is enjoyable to read, and I love the power dynamic. I relate more to the main character as well. Power dynamics might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I live for them. The domineering, possessive man and the damsel are in distress. It will never be a trope that gets tiring either. It's more of a comfort trope for me. Slow burn Romance is a necessity by the way. Enemies to Lovers is also amazing. \n\nJust curious, because I find some people can't help but be disrespectful or attack me for naturally aligning with it and finding positivity in it.

Hopefully, this post will be different as I explore what I liked, didn’t like, and the reason I initially shelved this book before returning months later.\n\nThis post has been flared for spoilers, so naturally, there will be spoilers below. Please, proceed at your own risk!\n\n\\--\n\nAlright, let me begin by stating: I absolutely fell in love with this book… at the tail end of Chapter 6, when Grace discovers the Eridian spacecraft. The 120 pages prior to this, while interesting, didn’t grip me. It’s actually why I shelved the book for a few months. I think the reason why boils down to two areas: the flashback sequences and who I presumed to be the buddy. \n\nStarting with the flashback sequences: I did not like how they were done in the beginning of the book. Trying to parse my feelings here, I felt like the sequences in the latter-half of the novel are more bite-sized and flowed into the action better (more thoughts on this later). Meanwhile, the beginning flashbacks were much longer, which I can understand from the standpoint of setting up the storyline, but were harder to digest and keep me in the action of Grace being on the spacecraft. I’m not sure there would have been a better way for Weir to write this introduction since there was a lot of hard science that had to be done to sell the plotline. Just giving away the knowledge that Grace accumulates in this section would have felt unearned.\n\nOn the other hand, I was not engaged by who I thought the ‘buddy’ (alluded to on the back cover of the book) was supposed to be. Seeing how the robot on the Hail Mary had a voice, highly mobile arms, and what I read to be a bit of snark - I thought we were headed towards a HAL 9000 scenario, albeit friendlier. And, were that the case, I don’t think I would’ve turned around on this book and seen it through.\n\nAll that changed at the end of Chapter 6 when Grace discovered alien life. Immediately, I was hooked, and my concerns about the AI buddy went away. A door had been opened and I could see where the plot was going. I loved the way Weir brought us along on the journey of learning more about Rocky and the Eridian race - it was engaging and kept me looking for nuances in Rocky’s mannerisms, seeing if I could glean any further meaning that may be hidden there. I could argue that the relationship between Rocky and Grace was what kept me and many others reading, more so than the astrophage plot. I mean, come on: terrible outcomes at the ending of a book didn’t match up with the Weir I know from The Martian.\n\nA few things also stuck out to me as well. Maybe they’re “me” things, maybe not.\n\nGrace's flashbacks in the latter-half tended to be shorter than in the beginning, which I liked. That said, I felt like the flashbacks were a bit simple. In most cases, Weir writes the flashbacks as it relates to an upcoming problem that Grace and Rocky need to solve… a problem that tends to present itself within a few pages of when the flashback occurs. While that makes for easy reading, it doesn’t reward the reader from being able to recall an innocuous nugget of information presented earlier in the novel. I believe there are ways to achieve this (in any story) and still come around to spelling it out for the viewer at a later time. \n\nAnother point I found myself struggling with, albeit infrequently, was the sciences presented in the book. This is most definitely a “me” thing, but curious how others experience it. Overall, the science in PHM is presented in a way that I can follow along and understand. Yet, a couple of times in the book I found myself glazing over the science being explained or discussed between our dynamic duo. I found myself stuck between: am I glazing over this because I don’t understand it, or am I glazing over it because it’s a scenario of ‘yeah yeah yeah, science things, solution, let’s move on’. I couldn’t come to an answer on this - just an observation I had as I was reading the book. Do other readers glaze over at a certain point when deep into the scientific explanation, too, or how do they handle it?\n\nIn general, I thought the ending was fitting. A bit predictable that he’d end up on Erid - though, for whatever reason, I didn’t foresee Grace becoming a teacher to the Eridian youth - even if it's obvious in hindsight. Made me smile. Plot aside, I did feel the ending was a bit rushed, or perhaps it was me just wishing it would go on a bit longer. Maybe it was a bit of both, but I recall feeling this way at the end of The Martian as well.\n\nLooking forward to the next book from Weir, whatever that may be.\n\n/ fist my bump\n\n\\--\n\nSome fleeting thoughts:\n\nI don’t recall at any point Grace having a camera in the ship. Did he ever take a photo of Rocky to send to Earth? Not at all critical to the plot, I’m just imagining people on Earth having their imagination run wild as they try to piece together descriptions of Rocky without a photo.\n\nIf the Earth was falling into global conflict, what pulled them back together to retrieve the beetles and launch an additional mission to Sol? Would they even have the infrastructure or organization to launch such a mission by the time the beetles returned?\n\nWhat do you want to see next? Would a sequel in the same setting of PHM work?",
