        "text": "Hi urban planners and enthusiasts alike, \nI have some concerns about my city, pertaining to inadequate roads, bus lines, bus shelters, bike lanes, etc. and I want to share some of these concerns/questions however i do not want to be overbearing or disrespectful about it.\n\nI'm not a urban planner myself, however i recognize that someone emailing elaborate questions or requesting updates about  upcoming systems may be annoying.\n\nMy question is if this is okay. My city provides contact about the different departments, and the people in charge, so i will not just contact 1 person, i just want to make sure that this is an okay thing to do. I really want to be more involved with my city, as we devleop a massive issue with urban sprawl however there is a system to these things and I don't want to annoy any employees. \n\nAny input would be greatly appreciated! And thank you for the work that you do!!",

It is going to cost us upwards of $40,000 to complete ourselves, as well as push move-in back two months OR the town is \"allowing\" us to escrow upwards of $60,000 for them to complete the sidewalk at a future date.  Are sidewalk in the town's easement and right-of-way the financial responsibility of their citizens?  Is that not what taxes are for?  Which of my 3 children don't get to go to college because we are required to fork over astronomical sums of money?  The kicker is that the town is installing sidewalks all around town anyway.  We have lived on our lot for 7 years.  Any suggestions/advice/thoughts are appreciated!!  Feeling very stuck and resentful of the town I've lived in for almost 40 years.",

        "text": "From a young age, I felt passionately about geography, mapping, and spatial studies and, in turn, felt that urban planning was the best career option for me. I received a Bachelor's Degree in Economics/Urban Planning 2 years ago and now work for an infrastructure consultancy in the United States working in the exact field I studied. \n\nLooking to my post-graduate future, I always had this thought that getting a master's in urban planning is the inevitable next step, and while I've already applied to programs nationwide (currently waiting to hear back), I'm now wondering if I'm making the right decision by pursuing this particular degree. I'm still growing in my current role and feel as though leaving the industry for 2 years may not open many doors for me. In a similar vein, I *already* studied planning as an undergraduate, so any further coursework (while I am sure beneficial) may be duplicative/repetitive. \n\nFinally, I wonder if a long-term career in planning is lucrative in the very expensive metropolitan area that I plan to live in moving forward. As such, sometimes I question if I should make a slight career pivot toward management/strategy consulting (or something more business or economics focused) as the skillsets overlap, and I often feel disillusioned by the policies that protract the planning process. \n\nAfter all, I am not certain of the exact facet of urban planning I would be studying should I move forward with a master's degree. I have myriad interests, from transportation economics to housing/community development, and it may be too earlier to coalesce on a single field of study as a master's student. I appreciate any advice on these convoluted musings.",

I would not mind this IF I can use transit to commute. It sounds like a cool alternative to living AND working in a city that you love. Sometimes it's hard to find a job you love in the city you love. If cities and adjacent business districts were planned to have this feature, I see it having a highly positive impact on traffic, mental health, physical health, etc.\n\nIt is worth clarifying that if I have to drive a car to work, the deal's off. Why? I don't want to buy/maintain a car, and I would like to avoid traffic, reduce emissions, etc. Taking transit is the main reason I enjoy living in a city. Traffic in and out of a city would ruin the whole thing. I would rather bartend and live in the city.\n\nSo it has to be commuted by rail. SF has Caltrain, but you have to live close to the station. Similar in Boston with some of the suburbs, but car vs train is &lt;1hr vs 2hrs+. \n\nWhat I would now like to know is whether this is a normal difference in commute time (car vs. rail) for a \"competitive\" transit system. Do people do this, and do they enjoy it? A two-hour commute sounds pretty awful, but I want to live in a city, and until it is more common for businesses (in my industry) to be located in walkable cities, I feel like this is my only option if I have to work somewhere located outside of a city.\n\nSo if you have a moment to fill me in on what life is like in this situation, I would love to hear about it. If you only have a second, then please answer the poll. Thanks!\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/115f6vp)",

If I were to describe such a place to a planning audience, I'd say something like 'legacy cities in weak markets with good bones and relatively robust, existing pedestrian connectivity, yet in which the origins and destinations between land uses, fear of crime, and/or perceptions of walking as inherently inferior result in a failure to consider nonmotorized travel as viable for any trips, thereby suppressing the latent population of walkers'. But I need a way to describe such locales for a non-planning nerd audience. \n\nWhen I was out on such a walk today in the community I plan for and thought about how to distill this particular environment down to a word or two, George Carlin's ghost popped into my head and said the word 'Son - we call that place America'. That's the smart assed answer and well, it's not wrong. But if you had to distill down how such places feel to inhabit and move through, what word(s) would you use that capture it accurately? I ask because this is a typology I keep seeing again and again in places I've lived in and planned for yet have never seen it succinctly described.",

What’s the best way to focus my search? \n\nFor context, I am about to graduate with my MUP (USA) with a focus on economic development. I worked in real estate relocation for ~5 years (I am licensed) before going back to grad school so I’m a non-traditional student in some sense, and have some semi-relevant work experience. I’m hoping for role that’s fairly general so I can learn as much as possible. For example, Planning Analyst at Kimley-Horn is very intriguing but they don’t have an opening in a location that works for me right now. \n\nBut since I’ve never worked in planning and I don’t necessarily know all the players, I’m feeling a little lost. My university job board / advisors focus almost exclusively on municipal planning, so they haven’t been much help truthfully. \n\nI’d ask more specific questions but I don’t know what I don’t know! Any tips would be greatly appreciated and I’m happy to provide more information.",

And it's not like they're lacking the funds, since the microtransit funds were freed up. We've already made public comment and even the council seems to be generally on our side. What more can we do to get the city staff to support better transit?\n\nSide notes: The bus goes along a corridor with roughly 10000 ppl / sq mi (3500 / sq km) and the city has roughly 330000 people total, projected to grow to 400000 by 2030.",

        "text": "In the urban planning world, what lessons do you think we can learn from this tragic and horrific earthquake?  Seems like we kind of forgot about the destructive power of earthquakes, on the west coast of the US.  Do we know how safe / resilient some of the major cities on/near fault lines are? \n\nReports seem to suggest a combination of poor building codes, no enforcement of existing codes, and population density have led to the high death toll (over 36,000 and counting). \n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-the-earthquake-in-turkey-was-so-damaging-and-deadly/ \n\n&gt;Why was this earthquake particularly damaging?\n\n&gt;The number one factor is building quality. It just trumps everything else. Building quality is controlled by a building code and the enforcement of that code. Turkey went through the terrible 1999 Izmit earthquake, which killed [more than 15,000] people, so Turkey had modern building codes within a few years of that earthquake. So then you say, “Well, given that, why do buildings fail? Are these buildings older than 20 years ago? Or were the buildings built in a manner that was not properly reinforced?”\n\n&gt;After that Izmit earthquake in 1999, I was there. We were inspecting a factory. You build a strong building with reinforced concrete, which is the standard building material the world over. What you do is: You have rebar—you have these steel rods that are inside the columns and beams. And you concentrate the strength and the density of those at any corners, any junctions, because that’s where the earthquake stress is going to be concentrated.\n\n&gt;So we were inside this failed manufacturing plant, and I could see there was a big crack at one of these joints—big enough that I could get my hand in to see how many reinforcing rods were in there. I put my hand in, and I pulled out a hunk of Styrofoam. The world would be a safer place if concrete was translucent. This is the problem: it’s too easy to cheat.\n\n&gt;I don’t know if the buildings that fell [in the recent quake] are older buildings or poorer buildings, so I’m not accusing anybody of anything. But this is the problem worldwide, not just in Turkey.\n\n&gt;What other things would you like people to be aware of with the risk of earthquakes?\n\n&gt;I think it’s a reminder. I think what’s happened over the past five years is: people willed themselves to believe that earthquakes don’t occur anymore, and it’s now just floods and wildfires. So that’s definitely the view in California. It’s kind of willful blindness. It’s understandable, because it’s been a long time in California [since a major earthquake]. So this is a reminder of what can happen in a very San Andreas–like setting, that big earthquakes do happen. This is our future. And the difference between a relatively harmless earthquake and a disaster is how well we build our buildings and how well we prepare.",

        "text": "I want to go back to school, I don't have a bachelor's yet, and the two fields I'm thinking of are landscape architecture and urban planning. I know that I just need a bachelors with landscape architecture (and eventually licensing) but with urban planning I need a master's and it will be tough to pick the right bachelor's since there is no specific bachelor's for urban planning.\n\nIn urban planning I would be interested in transportation planning. In landscape architecture I would be open to residential design, public space design, and historical preservation. I like the planning of space, I like to know where roads and railroads go, I have interest in public transportation. I'm often on Google Maps, looking at where everything is and the fastest route to go from point A to point B and what roads and bridges to take, I find it interesting.\n\nHowever I also like nature. I've always loved the outdoors, from the beaches and forests to my own backyard. I love parks, I like art, I appreciate space when I'm in it and soak it all in. I used to draw a lot, not as much now but I'd be willing to do it again. I like it that urban planning is more \"big picture\" than landscape architecture, but I also don't like politics (even though I'm knowledgeable about it) and I enjoy it when I do things creative (I've done writing, acting classes, drawing.) I just like open space in general and how we use it and can influence it, which is why I'm torn as to which to choose.\n\nI don't have any rosy pictures of both professions, I know that they can be tough office jobs, but I was thinking that either would be the careers I'd be most interested in.",
