They would instead, be seeing dinosaurs. \n\nIf this has any credibility, than I’m assuming.\nIt’s because the time it takes for visuals to travel through space has been so warped and manipulated, that the distance between two points of focus. Is simply too far and separated.\n\nMy question is, if this is true, than that means (because in space everything is constantly moving and expanding) that if we were able to somehow discover a Habitable planet. \nThan before anyone could ever get a real good view and study it, let alone travel to it.\nThat planet is essentially no where even close in hindsight. That we’re looking at planets that are not even in that same location upon discovery, and essentially making it yet another obstacle to jump over if we ever tried to get from point to point. Or in this case planet to planet.",

When you throw a ball in the air, it comes back to earth once it reaches a its peek. So when the big bang explosion happens eventually there's a peek and the matter starts coming back together. Once all the matter in the universe is collected at a single point it becomes so dense that it explodes like a supernova. And that would be the big bang. The big bang will play on loop forever. And sense the matter all comes together it destoys all possible life over and over as it keeps evolving after each big bang. Humanity can only last for so long before there is no matter left for survival. But that's just a theory :)",

By pooling our resources, sharing our knowledge, and working together towards a common purpose, we can overcome the challenges of space exploration and create a brighter future for ourselves and our descendants.\n\nWe envision a future where the Solar System is a place where all people, regardless of their nationality or background, can thrive and live fulfilling lives. A future where we work together to protect our home planet, Earth, and extend our reach beyond it to other celestial bodies. A future where our pursuit of knowledge and understanding leads to discoveries that benefit all of humanity.\n\nTo achieve this vision, we advocate for the following principles:\n\nCooperation: We believe that cooperation is the key to achieving a united Solar System. By working together, we can pool our resources and expertise to achieve greater things than we ever could alone. We call for international collaboration in space exploration and development, as well as the sharing of knowledge and technologies for the benefit of all.\n\nSustainability: We believe that our actions in space must be sustainable and responsible. We must take care to preserve the environments of other celestial bodies, and ensure that our activities do not harm the delicate balance of our Solar System. We call for the development of sustainable space technologies, and for responsible stewardship of our shared resources.\n\nInclusivity: We believe that space exploration and development should be open to all people, regardless of their background or nationality. We call for the creation of an inclusive and diverse space community, where all people have equal opportunities to participate and contribute.\n\nInnovation: We believe that innovation is the key to unlocking the full potential of space exploration and development. We call for the support and encouragement of cutting-edge research and development in space technologies, as well as the exploration of new ideas and approaches to space exploration and development.\n\nPeace: We believe that the exploration and development of space should be done in the spirit of peace and cooperation. We call for the promotion of peaceful relations between nations and for the use of space as a tool for international cooperation and understanding.\n\nWe, the Stellarists, believe that a united Solar System is not only possible, but necessary for the survival and prosperity of humanity. We call upon all people who share this vision to join us in working towards a brighter future for ourselves and for generations to come.",
