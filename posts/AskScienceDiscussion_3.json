        "text": "This one was tough to form in a question, but here is some context to explain. \n\nI have a sweet tooth, but I try to avoid sugar as much as I can. To combat this through my life, I've taken to eating frozen yogurt (particularly the one with fruit on the bottom) and frozen juice boxes. Hit my sweet craving, but it is much better for me than a bowl of ice cream or a freezie/popsicle/frozen sugar. When I do freeze the juice box or yogurt, there are two distinct ways it will freeze. 1. It will for into \"crystals\" like [this](https://imgur.com/a/sza1GYj). I don't like it when my stuff freezes like this (textural, does absolutely nothing to the taste). Or 2. It will freeze more uniform. I don't have a picture, unfortunately. But I relate it to when water gets really cold, and then you smack it, and it turns to ice. That but more frozen solid. It's like the ice crystals are so small that it scapes out (best way to eat something frozen unless you can literally chomp on it) smoothly. It's almost like frozen slush. Frezzies will usually do this within the same tube. Part of it chews like big ol ice chunks inside your mouth and then other parts will chew off like slush with basically no ice cristalys (or so small that they scrape/chew like slush. Is there a way I can freeze my goodies to ensure that I'll get the freeze that I want? Sorry for any confusion in the title or body. This was tough to put into question form and make it make sense without knowing any scientific terminology to help me explain. Thanks all!",

I partially blame social media and I know I shouldn’t believe everything I read.. but sometimes it is really frightening. So my question is when it comes to things that are considered toxic or carcinogenic, when is reason to worry? For instance, I once saw a video about VOCS and other things on rugs, mattresses, comforters, etc. and I just got a new rug and as I was opening it, inhaled a huge wiff of some sort of smell. Almost smelled like a hardware store or dusty. It got me thinking about harmful chemicals or carcinogens in the factory or store. Is this something to worry about? I just want the facts I guess so I don’t fall into all of the media hype.",

For the bio scientists that read the manga, the twins had a older sister named Tesla that was the first plant ‘born’ on the ship and was subjected to a variety of harsh experiments before succumbing to injuries. If this happened in real world where a plant gave birth to a humanoid plant that matures quickly in under a year, according to whatever ethic laws that exist, could you continue experimenting on the subject as if it’s just a regular plant or would you have to now treat it as a human and have to conduct the experiments in a ethical manner that doesn’t cause any Ill harm to the subject?",

I am a science teacher working in a STEM - inclined high school. This means we are training students to be scientists in the future. We have a very advanced science curriculum and kids have been taking research subjects since Grade 7.\n\nI am kinda new to the assignment(it is my second year) and I teach research and some biology classes. My idea of research is not limited to product innovation. I have a degree in biology and have worked with thesis involving a little bit of bioinformatics before becoming a teacher, so I am a big fan of in-silico studies as well. However, my co teachers hate those. They think proper science should always have tangible and easily accessible significance and results and I am going nuts tryna convince them that not all research should be like that. It kinda frustrates me that the research they do is only limited to those who can win contests like ISEF, and care less about actually doing science (answering curiosities, publishing papers, etc). \n\nSo how do you convince them that mere analysis of data, with no tangible results , is still a proper research and not shallower than any other they have done before?",

        "text": "I get annoyed sometimes when people ask why we evolved X, Y, or Z, and how people find ways to justify the evolution of certain traits. There’s no point in justifying because there’s no way to know—because we didn’t really evolve with the intent to become this way. This is not a “giraffes grew larger necks to reach taller trees” argument—it’s more nuanced.\n\nI think a lot of our changes were incidental and had no effect. Sure, certain changes like opposable thumbs and bigger brains were super important. But a lot of things—and I might say most things—just developed incidentally and had no little to no effect. It’s even possible something that was developed 1.2 million years ago before point X did not become advantageous until point X, if that makes sense.\n\nA good example is eye color. Some say certain eye colors see better in certain conditions. Others say certain eye colors are protective for certain environments. There’s so many possibilities that you can’t really pin down a “reason” for any change, you just know that it happened.\n\nYou also can’t pin down that a certain change was advantageous at a certain point in time. It could have been just a random but insignificant change. We can evolve without necessarily adapting to the environment.\n\nPoint is, it’s all random. It’s nice to speculate, but we shouldn’t develop surefire theories as to why something evolved a certain way. It could have happened randomly with no reason to it at all. Rant over lol.",

No more moon. Doesn't really matter how it goes poof, just that it does. One moment we have a moon, the next we don't.\n\nTides change, I know that, but I'm not sure how it would exactly happen: from what I can tell, they'd be diminished, but I don't know how that would affect coastal regions, or the view from orbit. Nights would be darker, yeah, but there's some knock-on effects that I can't exactly find on my own. This would, of course, have massive social and ecological ramifications. Depending on the matter of the (for a lack of a better and more scientific term) \"poof\"ening, such as some mining experiment or other random thing causing it to break apart/shatter, there would probably be debris but I assume most of it wouldn't land on earth (though the ones that do would probably be really, really bad for wherever they land on).\n\nNow, if this isn't the best spot to ask, let me know; it's kind of a hard thing that I can't easily find answers for on my own because of a lack of knowledge on my end.

        "text": "(This is a very speculative question. Just wanted to put that out there)\n\nWarp drives function by contorting space in a way that it propels you faster than light, or at least, it propels whatever space your ship is occupying ([here's the visualization of it from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive#/media/File:Alcubierre.png)). However, since it is space that is moving and not you, technically you don't have any velocity of your own. If you did have any velocity, then you would move through your portion of space until you hit the edge of the warp bubble, which, due to how extremely warped space is at that boundary, would likely result in your ship getting completely destroyed (similar to how black holes shred object that pass into their Roche limit). Once your arrive at your destination, it can be assumed that you would come to a complete stop, since technically you were not moving in the first place. But that's when regular physics take hold, and if you were in the gravity well of any large object, you would simply just plummet straight towards the surface. So in order to avoid crashing into the object, you of course want to enter orbit. But you can't enter orbit because you can't have any velocity in the warp bubble. So how do you safely gain enough velocity in order to orbit, without destroying your ship? Do you just fire your conventional engines at full blast the moment you arrive? Or can you use the warp drive to gain any \"actual\" velocity?",

However, this barrier only isolates those spermatocytes and mature sperm cells from the rest of the body, while the spermatogonia stem cells are still located outside of the blood-testis barrier, that they are not protected by it like the mature sperm cells. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/evi4cgm.jpg\n\nBut from some histo pictures, we can see that there are a layer of peritubular myoid cells which formed the Tunica Propia membrane that surrounds the outer most of the seminiferous tubules right next to those spermatogonia stem cells. Does this membrane also present function that acts as tight-junctions or a secondary barrier that is similar to the blood-testis-barrier inside the tubules, which blocks and filters certain molecules from the outside tissues diffusing into the spermatogonia stem cells? \n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/azVRlkTZmO8",

I'm more curious about the effects this would have on wind, storm systems, precipitation, etc. I would imagine eventually the water cycle would stop due to no evaporation, but that would probably take a while to happen.\n\nWith no sunlight warming one side of the planet , how long would it take for the wind to actually die out altogether? And what are the consequences of not having any wind?\n\nAlso, what would happen to the land near hot springs/geysers? Would that be a potential \"safe zone\" due to rising geothermal heat or would the water eventually just freeze as well?",

        "text": "Okay, so this incident happened with me like 20 minutes ago, My Generator got started by itself in the middle of the night😶😐...\nLet me give you some context, I'm a simple guy from India, My parents have a flour mill, which is like 45 years old and my father also started a tile shop 5 years back or so, and it was growing well, but then came the lockdown, and it wasn't that bad for us, then lockdown passed and my father was thinking of closing the Flour mill, as the ROI is bad, means my father was paying for the flour mill's electricity bills with his tile shop, and he was okay with that, but now he wants to expand his tile shop(by the way, both of the shops are side by side) as there was many issues with my workers in the mill, and also I did told you about the ROI... Now, this was the context, not very scientific for a science discussion sub, but here comes the important part, I don't live in my house now, as I moved to another city for my studies, and sometimes like in festivals, I do come home..., One day, this was like 4 weeks back, I was not home, and my parents and my brother went to visit relatives, they went out in the evening, after closing both the shops, and came back in the morning, and when they came back, my worker and my neighbours as well told me that my generator got started by itself, it got started like 5 in the morning and continue to run by itself for two hours, until one of my two workers came to work and stopped it, also, there was almost no field in the generator, yes, you heard it correct, then as I'm not from a very big town, so my father also started thinking that this might be some case with spirits and ghost and other stuff...., Now do I believe in spirits, yes and no both...., because, they won't do something so pointless to show themselves, or if there is some other reason I'm not getting, then tell me directly, I don't know how, just directly, okay...., So my parents prayed and then just let it go, Also I forgot to mention, this is the first time it happened in the 45+ years of my shop...., Now, fast forward to February, I came home because of my exams and also my father went out because of some business work, I'm here for the last 10 days now, and nothing of that sort happened..., Until today, today, my father came back from his business trip, and the day was all good, I don't remember even a single thing wierd, about anything, then it got Evening, then we closed, then night and my father and mother went to sleep, I was awake with my brother and we were discussing something about Nikola Tesla's Inventions, then after 12 I told him to sleep as he got schools, and I was awake, at 12:42 my father got a call in his smartphone, but he missed that as he was asleep, and I heard that but I didn't wanted to wake him up like who calls in the middle of the night -_- right, then I went to washroom and guess what, I could hear my generator in my mill was running, I quickly washed my hands, and went back to see my father, he was awake, and told me that one of the neighbour called him telling him that the generator was running, then I told him yes, I heard it too, we got in a kind of hurry and rushed through the main door, went out reached my mill, open the door, and we saw, that the generator was running, just simply...., We didn't ran it the whole day, no wait, from the last 7 days, we weren't running it, my mill was completely running on electric motor, and now it was running by itself, there's even a switch given to turn it on and off and of course it was turned off, we got in the building, checked everything, every door, every window, and every corner of the building, there was nothing or no one, then my neighbour, who called also came, he told us that the generator started making noises at like 12:30 by itself, not loud by it started, then after 5 minutes, you can clearly hear it, and yes, when I went to my bathroom, I did heard it...., Then my father again prayed to our ancestors, and turned off the generator, and also disconnected the main wire, which were connected with the batteries, and then we closed our main doors of the shop and went back to our houses...., Now, what I think is there has to be some sort of electric-circuit based issue, I don't know what exactly is that but as the neighbour told us, it didn't started in one flick, it started slowly and steadily...., I'm here for any queries you might wanna ask, thanks for reading...",

They can do whatever they want with the classroom and have an outdoor area to use as well. Does anyone have experience with this or have any ideas? Sorry if wrong sub.",

        "text": "So, an [Ionocraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion-propelled_aircraft) is an aircraft that uses ion thruster as a propulsion system, but I'm more specifically referring to an [atmospheric ion thruster](https://youtu.be/01F8V5IhB5k).\n\nIf I understood it correctly about how the ionocraft works, it uses a positve side and a negative side in an open circuit, so the static/ionised air gases are attracted from one end to another, making the ionic wind.  \nAnd because of that, these ionocraft need to exponentially increase the surface area of the ion thruster.\n\nThe problem with this is that it needs a lot of voltage, kilovolts in fact. Although it uses extremely low amperage, it is still kinda hard to maintain 20,000 volts. [This guy](https://youtu.be/5HL1tiWEDls) made an iononocraft at home and it literally blew half of the electronics in his house due to the static electricity generated by his ionocraft.\n\n# Anyway, to the question:\n\nIf one were to insert an air ionizing gun and pass this ionised air through electromagnetic coils, would it be more efficient or have a better performance than the ion thruster?\n\nPlasma is said to be ionised gas, and since the air is being ionised, maybe you could accelerate it through electromagnetic coils?\n\nOr the way the ionocraft already works it **already** employs the electromagnetism generated by the current in order to help it propel the aircraft forward?",

        "text": "I'm curious about how the scientific community would decide on what to call stars if we only discovered them today.  This assumes that for the entire history of mankind, the night sky was only a black dark abyss and we only recently discovered stars using technology to peer through this \"shroud.\"  This assumes we always had the sun and called it the sun, and only recognize after discovering \"stars\" that the sun is a \"star.\"\n\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\n&gt;The word \"star\" ultimately derives from the [Proto-Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European) root \"h₂stḗr\" also meaning star, but further analyzable as h₂eh₁s- (\"to burn\", also the source of the word \"ash\") + -tēr (agentive suffix). \n\nSo the root word of \"star\" implies burning, which was a misunderstanding we can forgive for our ancient ancestors who had no concept of nuclear fusion.\n\nAssuming this new discovery of \"stars,\" would scientists call them \"distant suns?\"  Assuming they already understand that the sun fuses elements, would that impact how \"stars\" are named?  Would they be called \"fusors?\"\n\nI'm curious to hear all speculations from the scientific and lay communities about how stars would be named if discovered today.",

        "text": "Recently I've been talking to people involved in archaeology and forensics about the sex of skeletons and how it's determined. I'm not really sure how much this falls under biology but I hope it's okay to post here.\n\nAnyway, I feel confused from reading peer reviewed articles that seem to contradict each other. For example, I've read from one source that sex determination through osteological methods has around a 99% accuracy rate. I'll link the article here:\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15567621/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwimmprPg4P9AhXlnFwKHUhjDn8QFnoECA4QAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw2aR-BCydCC9y9xafpP0xU9\n\nSome of the people I talked to in those fields thought this was a very accurate result. On the other hand, however, many other people in the same fields have told me that sexing skeletons is on more of a scale, and that there's rarely definite male or definite female skeletons, and many lean more towards one sex or the other or are intermediate. I was also told that even identifying sex by the pelvis can be tricky as there are four different kinds of pelvises. My mother was actually talking about this before, that she couldn't naturally give birth (I'm adopted), because she has an android pelvis, and she's six feet tall, so I honestly wonder, if people saw x-ray shots of her if they would be more likely to identify her as male.\n\nI read about skeletons that were identified as one sex but we're later reexamined as the other. I also read about Julie Doe, who forensics teams I initially thought to be a pregnant woman until DNA testing showed that she was actually a trans woman, so I'm not sure if this suggests that HRT for transitioning can make certain changes to bone structure?\n\nAnyway, I'll wrap this up here, I hope it's okay to post on this sub and was wondering is there anyone in similar fields who would be able to give some input? Any feedback is appreciated.",
