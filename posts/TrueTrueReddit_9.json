        "text": "It's a rather fun idea and I wanted to run it by others. The idea is that during, let's say Saturday, for 1 minute after ~8:00pm and ~9:00pm, users would need to play an account-specific randomized mini-game. The mini-game would be streamed ala Gaikai/OnLive and couldn't be successfully finished with high latencies. Additionally, only the parts of the world currently experiencing those times could play. Because users couldn't play more than 1 mini-games at once, they would only be able to authenticate one account for voting.\n\nThe problem I see is that, especially nearer to the poles, there might be so little distance/latency that users could spoof their latency levels and authenticate multiple accounts. Up to eight I suppose. I'm curious if anyone can think of a way around that? Perhaps user clients could be required to respond to pings from randomized distributed computers to truly determine their locations and, therefore, determine whether they are in joining the correct time-zone group?",
