        "text": "Public opinion have fortunately transformed marijuana laws, gay rights, and other social issues. Health care remains a disaster, but it's at least a topic of discussion, because everyday citizens are complaining about it. I could go on. \n\nHowever, I don't see similar fanfare dedicated towards zoning law reform. Reversing the effects of sprawl and car-focused land use is attainable.  Suburban retrofit could make stale suburbs a lively community. Rather than getting in my car, I could take a walk down my neighborhood, and visit a cafe/art studio/record store etc. built out of a former home. Ostensibly, the most intolerant conservative would sooner support traditional mixed zoning developments over the rights of two men getting married and high. However, rigid zoning laws don't allow for the kind of development patterns we salivate over. Afaik, this is the biggest obstacle standing in the way. \n\nThis is not a hot-button issue. No candidate is going to make headlines about his or her position on zoning law reform. It's not on most peoples' minds, but once I go on an extended tangent about how suburbia isn't ideal, most people, regardless of political persuasion, agree with me. The argument that these would create hip, diverse, and walkable neighborhoods appeals to liberals. The argument that people-centric planning is more fiscally productive (coupled with the visual reminders that traditional main streets give off of the old-school Norman Rockwell Americana) appeal to MAGA conservatives. \n\nIt seems like at some fundamental level, most Americans know that something is off about suburbia, even if they lack the awareness that planning nerds have accrued. How can we make this the focus of national attention? How can we make this one aspect of America great again? If the cultural attitudes towards once taboo social issues can shift, so to can this. Do we badger local and state representatives? Do we go door-to-door like urbanist missionaries? ",

When planning for curbside space usage (parklets, food trucks, etc.), how is the surrounding traffic taken into account. Obviously the posted speeds are known, but is assuming the posted speeds are followed part of the plan? What element does the \"actual\" speed of traffic play in a plan?\n\nFor example, if a quiet residential street has a 30 km/hr limit, which you consider safe for a certain activity, does your anecdotal knowledge that cars often exceed this speed on this section of street play a part in the plan? Is it safe to assume the posted speeds are respected for all related plans? What measures could be taken to consider speeders in the plan? ",

        "text": "Hi, my name is John and I am a resident of Dickinson, Tx. Last year hurricane Harvey devastated our small town in the bay area of Houston.  Over 85% of our homes in the city were inundated with flood waters from the surround area. This was not storm surge. The current state of our storm drainage systems and bayous is not capable of handling even minor storms. I am currently trying to get volunteers and others together to plan out and try to get some of these problems solved. FEMA was supposed to give the city money to dredge bayous and get the system up to snuff. Unfortunately though the money was granted they refuse to release it to the city. Our city mayor stated that there is only 10 employees that work to make our drainage system flow. A day ago half an inch of rain hit our area and flooded some more homes because of the state of the system. Surrounding cities such as League City continued to release water into several bayous that were already over their banks. Several local news stations have come out, but nothing has been getting done.\n\n* The advice I am looking for is what can individuals do in conjunction with city works to get things done?\n* What will the city let us do to help and what won't they? (we are at high probability of flooding again)\n* Where can I help financial help once I have the volunteers together?\n* What all can we do without the city just to get things done?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the page I started to have some sort of home page for our group. \n\n[http://dickinsontexasbayougroup.blogspot.com/2018/09/dickinson-texas-bayou-group.html](http://dickinsontexasbayougroup.blogspot.com/2018/09/dickinson-texas-bayou-group.html) \n\nI have a group on the Nextdoor app.\n\nI started a facebook page, but I have to create an account first since I didn't have one. facebook has since locked me out claiming suspicious usage. I uploaded a picture and used my phone number and im still not able to access the page. To be honest if facebook continues to hinder me I'm going to blame them as well for hindering resources to get things done.  \n",

They want to request speed humps to the city but that can take a long time and is unlikely to happen. The road also has a pretty steep downhill section that I know would not be good for speed humps. I was also thinking we could do some guerrilla pavement markings and just solve our own problem at least temporarily. Any thoughts? The road is one-way and only about 22 feet wide with parking on right side. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Both in my current city, Austin, and home state of Connecticut, bike trails are popular for recreation, but many of them seem to me to be rarely used for everyday transportation. \n\nTake the East Coast Greenway, which is near and dear to my heart - just a cool idea. Connecticut has been spending millions (keep in mind the state has been struggling financially for some time) to finish up the portion running through the state, often bankrolling whole sections when municipalities prove unwilling or unable to pay any of the costs. \n\nThere are stretches that run through New Haven that are very useful for urban commuting, but well over 70% of the trail goes through suburban and rural landscapes. You can go for dozens of miles at some points and barely see an accessible storefront or office. It's mostly just trees and the backs of suburban houses. It's pretty and a nice ride, but the only people you see on these stretches are lyrca clad old men out for exercise - not people traveling for utility. \n\nYet if you ask the governor and the state DOT commissioner, they cite how great of a transportation resource they are. \n\nIn Austin, there are some extremely popular and useful trails, but even here, tons of money goes to build trails that have little in the way of dense population, or work and retail destinations along them. The \"walnut creek trail\" is one such. \n\nSo my question is, is there much utility value for these trails? It seems like there are desperately need protected bike lanes that should have far higher priority. \n\nAll of Connecticut's cities have one protected bike lane among them, and Austin has huge stretches of dangerous lanes that really need protected lanes. \n\nWhy are we building these things when there is so much need for safe lanes in dangerous places? Is it just because it's an easier lift, politically, go pave a trail through the woods than to get people to give up road space?\n\n",

Our focus is on watersheds and water systems, and me and my teammate have decided we want to build around the concept of daylighting. Kate Orff's Louisville corridor project and Philadelphia's Green Streets handbook are two of our early inspirations, but I could definitely use more resources on multi-modal transportation design, or any early input. We got the project today, and there's a lot more to it than just the street redesign (a park space, a nature learning center, and a downtown plaza, all connected via these streets), but we wanted to get a jump on things early and really get off on the right foot, as neither of us have much experience with streetscaping/design. This is in a rapidly urbanizing area with a large research university (right up against the street in the picture). \n\n[An example of part of the main thoroughfare.](https://imgur.com/a/Ird9wY7) Thanks in advance!

And wow this really does create the food desert situation that you read about. I can understand how the economics of small stores make many unprofitable and moderate size stores + parking lot easily takes the majority of a city block, which can be hard to find an open plot of land and buying out existing businesses/homes would be prohibitive.\n\nWhat I don't understand though is why don't we see grocery stores with other businesses on top. That would double up the use/income. The issue I see is that all of that business takes even more parking. However this is mitigated in high density areas where fewer parking spaces may be required.\n\nAny thoughts on the grocery store situation?

Although many of the well-known graduate schools for planning have seemingly robust environmental and land use planning concentrations, I’d like to go somewhere with professors and research tied particularly to the climate-planning nexus. \n\nSo, I’d love to hear from those currently in the field or studying to be a planner about which university programs you believe to be leaders in the field — in the US or abroad.

The existing streetcar is just a small loop running in mixed traffic, so you'd need to add at least a second parallel track to accommodate suburban light rail lines linking via the existing streetcar track.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.) It runs in mixed traffic. So, in addition to needing a parallel line, so the loop can become part of a longer bi-directional LRT line -- rather than a useless loop -- you'd probably need to end the mixed-traffic running, which the city of Atlanta has told Marta it will not allow. (Ideally, you'd have a tunnel under downtown to avoid the lights.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, you basically have a light rail proposal crossing the entirety of Atlanta from SW to NE that actual transit planners at Marta believe can be built reusing the ridiculous Atlanta Streetcar tracks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is just madness. Where do they hire the people who think these ideas up? The logic of this proposal seems to be: \"Oh, we have tracks, so a train can run on the tracks.\" It's utter madness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
