She is warm, funny, and has provided great guidance as I learn the intricacies of this role and parts of her (specialized) role on our team.\n\nSo, understandably, it comes off as a little sting every time she drops “per our conversation” whenever something is brought up. I have my SOPs, my notes, my reminders everywhere. I am not repeatedly asking how to do things. It just makes me feel uncomfortable that she is seemingly covering her ass for everything. She has to cover her ass - she’s a manager, been there done that. But it comes up constantly.  I have an insane task list different from her responsibilities, and if I have not addressed one issue immediately she will send me an email with a reminder with “per x email” or “per our conversation”. It is in such contrast to her personality and the workflow of the organization.\n\nHow do I shake this off? How do I get ahead of this? Have you ever been in this situation? I have worked under a SEVERE micromanager, so I can handle this but just want help understanding how to digest it when she drops that phrase!",

        "text": "I’ve been in a loving relationship with my boyfriend for over 3 years now and we’ve been living together for 2 years. Since living together, I’ve gotten way more “comfortable”, I don’t do my hair as much, I rarely wear makeup, and I rarely dress up.  My days usually consist of me getting off of work (I work from home), rushing to straighten up and shower before my boyfriend gets home so that we can go find something to eat and sit on the couch and watch tv. \n\nWe have a good relationship but I sometimes feel like I am losing myself in my relationship. I don’t prioritize myself as much anymore. I’ve also noticed that I’ve been letting myself go more. Since we started dating, I’ve put on maybe 40 lbs and it has been extremely hard to get this weight off of me. This isn’t an excuse but I often times find myself eating like my boyfriend who can eat whatever he wants without gaining a pound. \nWe do so much together and while I LOVE doing things with him, I don’t want to become too codependent on him. For example, there will be times whenever I’m so hungry whenever I off work (I get off at 4, he gets off at 5 and doesn’t make it home until 5:30). I will wait until he gets home to eat so that we can eat together. This might sound minor but it’s definitely something that I’m starting to notice. \n\nI don’t want to lose myself in my relationship and I don’t want my boyfriend to get sick of me (which he has never insinuated). For those of you who have been here before, what have you done to combat this feeling? \nAny tips/words of advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",

        "text": "\n\nLast week  I quit my very high paying job at the world’s biggest online retailer. I joined this company two years ago, despite all the negative press it gets because of its toxic culture.   my options were limited because of my work visa so I took this job on they might be high risk, and high rewards in store .also my priority back then was to leave my prior employer who was a complete psychopath. For two years in this company,  I was thriving despite the toxic leadership because I had a good manager who acted as a barrier. My manager left 2 months ago and then life  just became hell here. I was working all the time and it felt super counterproductive because the new manager just didn’t know how to run this team. The leadership (my managers manager, and the  3 managers above ) loved public courts of shame, where my work was criticized and shamed in live review meetings for the past several weeks. I realize that I’ve seen this happen to other people at this company before and while I knew it was bad, I didn’t know how much it affects your psychology till i experienced it first hand. Imagine being afraid while you are awake and also being afraid while you are asleep. I used to get dreams about these review meetings where I was defending my work. \n\nSome good things resulted because of this job, or rather the circumstances it put me in. It made me move cities where I met my soulmate, and now we are happily married. I got this company’s brand name on my résumé, and a skill set that will open up more doors. Life as a single woman in my old city, and having no friends (cuz people moved away during pandemic or just got stranger ) made me feel really stuck two years ago. Since I started this job, two years have gone by fast and life has kept me very busy. This also helped me overcome my depression because for me free time resulted in more depression spirals. \n\nI have the privilege to quit because of a supportive partner. I’m going to take some downtime for a few months. \nNext time I start a job, I’m not going to have visa limitations, and I’m going to pick a company that is kind to its people and tough  on its business, rather than other way around. \n\nThe sense of relief I have surpassed  any prior good news. \n\nIt’s crazy how much unhappiness and misery bad jobs or bad bosses bring into our lives. I literally feel reborn again as a free individual. \n\nWhy I am sharing this ? Some good lessons here that might help others \n - calculated risks sometimes pay off. Accept the new challenge even if you have just one good thing working in your favor. Even if you don’t succeed , it’s a going stepping stone to open the world to limitless possibilities",

She is so sweet but every conversation is her trying to diagnose a random issue or fix something for me that I haven’t asked help for. A couple of examples from recent. I was saying how my 2 year old gets restless for long car rides and she said that he could have this random undiagnosed medical issue. Another example: we moved from a large city to the suburbs a couple of years ago and my husband still misses the city energy. She told me he should do this, this, or this…I finally said, it’s okay for him to miss the city.\n\nI love my friend. She has a very kind soul but I find this so exhausting.

I’m always polite and cheerful and say good morning and thank you.  \n\nBut I’m not getting into my personal life. For context I was with my boyfriend for 6 months before anyone at work even knew I was dating someone. I just keep my professional and personal life very separate.\n\nThis coworker is more on the social side and tries hard to be with me in particular. \n\nHe started probing by asking if I lived close to work and despite my vague answers started getting more direct … example below for context:\n\nHim: So do you have to commute far?\n\nMe: not really, I live pretty close by\n\nHim: oh do you live in the area? X town?\n\nMe: yes.\n\nHim: In an apartment complex or house? I’m in a rental and the cost is so expensive!\n\nMe: No, I own.\n\nHim: oh that’s great, do you live alone?\n\nMe (now lying bc I’m getting uncomfortable): my boyfriend lives with me.\n\nHim: oh, did you buy the home together? \n\nMe: no it’s mine. \n\nHim: oh wow! That’s an accomplishment at your age! How did you manage to do that?!\n\nMe (now mumbling and feeling awkward): I just saved as much as I could…thanks… well I’ll see you around.\n\nIn 5 minutes this guy got out of me where I live, that I own, who I live with….it’s like he’s not getting the hint that I’m private and there more vague I am the harder he tries to pry. It’s honestly none of his business my financials or who I live with.\n\nAfter a few more of these types of interaction I started being very curt with him. He would also call my desk with non work related questions to which I started just giving “I don’t really know” answers. \n\nI think he finally got the message bc now everytime we speak he sounds like his dog is dying. His tone is melancholy and sad yet I REFUSE to open that door about “what’s wrong” bc I know nothing is really wrong and it’s probably me being short.\n\nThe thing is he’s bright and cheerful BUT NORMAL with everyone else (we share an  office area and I’m the only one he would really pry with) everyone else gets the vague “how was your weekend? Good? Good” normal chit chat. Then I feel bad that there’s this weirdness with me. \n\nThis guy is married with a family. I just can’t help but feel it’s inappropriate that he asks me personal questions. And it’s nothing personal against him I just keep work…work.  \n\nI guess I’m a “I’m here to work not make friends” type but again I’m polite to everyone. I smile and am known as one of the more willing to be helpful in the department as it pertains to work. \n\nSo what is his deal? Am I overreacting? Everytime he answers me with that “I’m so depressed I’m near tears” tone I start to feel like a b*tch. And then I get angry that maybe this is manipulation to guilt trip me? Then I’m like is this how people get close to one another at work? If he was a woman would I feel different?\n\ninput and perspective welcome….",

I am ready to move up and to have more responsibility.We unfortunately have a hiring freeze at the minute and from speaking to my manager, there are no new roles expected within the next year. I'm also completing further study, and that will finish this time next year (another reason why I haven't started to look for a new job just yet).\n\nI'm also keen to meet someone, and while active on dating apps etc., it feels like there is very few eligible men where I'm currently living (have recently moved to a larger city!!). \n\nThese are two big areas of my life where I feel like I don't have much control over, despite trying to do as much as I can and I feel like as a result I am in 'waiting energy' and am not very inspired by what I'm doing.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice of what might have worked for them in the past when in a similar mindset/life experience?",

This news has been devastating for the whole family of course, and my partner has been hit especially hard as he is very close to his father. Jakob is a loner and an introvert, while he shares almost everything with me, he's not one to express his emotions and his face is pretty unreadable. I can usually guess how he's feeling by body language and gut feeling. The problem is, I feel woefully unprepared for this role as a partner. I don't know how to deal with such news, and I don't know the right way to support him. His father is in the very early stages, so we're all hopeful but the next few weeks/months are going to be stressful. I've told him that all he needs to focus on is work and his health, and I'll take over all household chores and responsibilities. Other than that, I don't know what to do. If anyone has any experience with this, please let me know. I want to do everything in my power to be there for him.",

It’s the best school district in the state here. The area is also more in align with my values and the community is close knit. It’s kindof a dream little area for apartment living and prices are comparable (even cheaper) compared to where I currently am. \n\nHowever, it is an expensive area for real estate and if I move over there, I don’t want to move districts again so I’d honestly probably stay in the apartments there for many years and/or be able to afford to rent a townhouse later. But to buy, that will likely never happen.\n\nHowever, will I ever be able to buy? I could probably try in 2024 or 2025 but it would be outskirts or places I wouldn’t *really* want to be as far as school districts or just in general.\n\nAlso looking at the economy and all the absolute garbage dumpster fires that keep occurring, would buying even be feasible for me at all then with everything happening? Do I want to even do that? Is it time to let that pipe dream go? \n\nApartment living is cheaper and less of a risk and I can keep more in savings anyway in the long run. I’d rather rent than be in a place or area I don’t love. \n\nI guess I’m having trouble with weighing pros and cons here and trouble thinking about the future vs now and what I should choose for myself and my son.\n\nWorst case scenario, we hate the area and move back here to these same apartments.\n\nI’m pigeon holed anyway as far as apartments because a 2/2 will be about $1700 and townhomes/homes rent for about $2000+ here. \n\nI’m not sure what my fears are, mostly just being in a new area and in a new apartment complex. What if it sucks, what if I have regret, what if I hate it?\n\nI’ve worked really hard to stabilize us here but moving there would be a step up for my sons education and future and community/friendships.\n\nThe community has a little movie theatre, a 72 acre preserve with trails, a cafe, several restaurants, and an area for shows/events, etc. \n\nOverall, I feel like flying in over that way but my fears/concerns of making the wrong choice we keeping me here glued and stuck. \n\nHelp!",

        "text": "My (34F) recent ex husband (33M) and I decided to call it quits 4 weeks ago. We were together for 10 years and married for 4.5 years. He attended schooling throughout the summers of 2018 to 2022 to get his dream job. During that time I would look after our home and dogs. We had talked about having a family one day, but I wasn't willing to start a family/go through the process of pregnancy alone while he was away so frequently. Not to mention how busy he is with all his other extra curricular activities hockey, volunteer job etc. He promised he would have time for me after all of his schooling and we would have lots of time to spend together to get our relationship back on track. He had been struggling with his mental health in the fall of 2021, told me he didn't want to live and things would be better off if he was unalived. He started to see a therapist of his own shortly after, and we also started couples therapy in the spring of 2022. Throughout attending couples therapy all of last year and truly putting an effort on my end, listening to his needs and wants etc. He continued to put no effort himself. He would say he wanted things like physical affection, yet I always made a point to try and he wouldn't give any in return, he was a stiff board with no affection towards me. Told me he wanted to have sex, ok...so I initiated, but he never initiated himself, not even once in over a year. He said he physically cannot initiate sex with me because he had been \"shut down\" too many times in the past (before we tried therapy). When he says \"shut down\"...his attempts to initiate sex would be asking me if I wanted to \"get it in\"...and that didn't really make me excited, or I'd legitimately just not be in the mood for sex. He stopped sleeping in our marital bed back in 2021, and blamed it on the fact that he didn’t want to sleep with his CPAP (he snores) but I never told him to not sleep with me. And as a matter of fact, during couples therapy I kept encouraging him to sleep with me in our bedroom so we could have \"pillow talk\" and get our connection back. He never followed through. \n\nThe straw that broke the camels back was the fact that he continues to tell me that he wants to have a baby but his actions have shown me he isn't willing to put the work and effort into \"us\" first and foremost. I need to feel secure, supported and loved. I've been so incredibly angry and bitter about it all. I was so patient with him while he went to school for his dream job, and now it's as if I was just expected to child rear for him and nothing more. I feel discarded and I'm struggling to deal with all the emotions of it. Hoping the awesome people of reddit have good advice, words of encouragement and support",

I carried a lot of hurt and worries with me, not knowing if I’ll ever trust a man again. When I arrived here I knew no one. I decided to give the apps a go, tried it for a week and met someone whom I kept close as a friend. He thought me how to trust again, and he provided a gentleness and kindness. Well, I fell for him and I became vulnerable.I was able to be apart of his community and meet his friends. We dated for a few months , but things ended a month ago. I’ve been in a lot of pain. Why? He meant a lot to me, he was the first person to tell me he wanted to marry me. I lost all my friends. Now I have a fibroid and I need surgery and I have no one to support me. I work full time and volunteer and do things for myself. What do I have forward to look towards? I wish I didn’t feel so much pain from losing him. When things ended we weren’t so nice to each other but we met up in person this weekend. He apologized to me and wanted to remain friends. He set some boundaries about texting which I’m fine with. I even dry heaved and almost vomited when we spoke I was so upset. But what really got to me was that he felt like I depended on him . I mean, I have a history of not depending on anyone for fear of getting hurt, and when I learned he was safe , I naturally leaned on him. We actually leaned on each other for support. Now I have to act like I don’t know him, and he wants me to show up to our friend events but I don’t have it in my heart to. \n\n\nI’m so freaking hurt. I feel alone, I have surgery coming up and I’m heart broken. All I can imagine is him having a good time with our friends. I bring so much to relationships and I have a huge heart. 1 year of living here and things didn’t go as planned. All I can think about are the “supposed to bes”",

I wasn’t going out every night or anything, but I did have friends that I would do things with\n\nOver time, though, I realized that there are SO many things I want to do.  I see these people at the bar or at occasional concerts… but I want to do painting classes, parks, I want to go on walks/hikes.  I want to go to the beach, go to the pool… I want to go to Disneyworld, and I’ve recently made it a point that I want to go to New Orleans.\n\nAnd yet none of my friends want to do those things.  I don’t understand - I thought these were common interests, or at least semi-common interests.  And yet the people I know, don’t give a shit about those things.\n\nThey just want to drink.  And I don’t drink much myself, I drink socially.  But they drink a little toooo much.  These are people mostly in their 30’s and 40’s, and I truly like them… but too many times have we made plans, gotten excited about doing something, only for people to get drunk and people have to go.  We could have done SO much more and seen SO many cool things, but now the day is gone because people drank too much, too early.\n\nOn top of that, COVID changed a lot of my social structure.  Most of them paired off, or had to find work elsewhere and move away\n\nI have one friend that I see most often and, while he is a great friend, his interests do not align with mine.  I also don’t like that we look like a couple to other people.  plus, we have had a situationship in the past that, I feel, was to my detriment *and* his detriment.  I want to meet friends… and guys, too.  But I can’t do that with him around.  \n\nSo I feel like I’m in a real social rut.  Has anyone else found themselves here?",

I have “vague” and non-vague physical symptoms that the medical community likes to dismiss and shove off to psych, but I know that’s not the issue.  I keep getting symptom treatments that aren’t effective.  My primary care doc of the last 10+ years is going through some difficult family and career stuff, and hasn’t been able to be appropriately responsive. No one is taking ownership for helping me get my body and my life back. How do I find that care? Google search just shows me names 🤷🏻‍♀️ I’m PNW America based.\n———\nCW: descriptions of body symptoms.\n\nI am physically falling apart on what feels like multiple levels.  I’ve been telling providers at frequent drs appointments for 9 months now and the most response I’ve gotten is a couple blood panels, which showed a ferriton of 10 (too low, good level is around 100).  They recommended an iron supplement.  It has barely helped. I get lots of comments about “could be xyz, have you tried abc?” And then either the abc is something I’m already doing, can’t do, or helps but doesn’t help *enough*\n\nI wake up most days more tired and exhausted than when I went to sleep, disoriented, achy and in pain. My joints hurt every day. A typical for me workout now leaves me feeling like I did a workout that was 4x as hard or long or big than what I actually did.  My ADHD symptoms have gone from mild-moderate (all my life) to life ruiningly  bad - my career is in the pits, my financial credit is under threat, and I’m incredibly socially isolated (down from a thriving social life the previous year). My digestive system is so fucked up - I spend half my days bloated and distended to the point of pain and even after making the switch to a mostly FODMAP-safe diet I still can barely eat without my GI track punishing me. I can eat chocolate (🙄) without bloating so I end up eating it all freaking day, which feels super disgusting in a different way.  I’m gaining weight so I’m told nothing is wrong with my GI, it’s just “functional” problems.  I get bloated if I eat healthy carbs, but nauseous if I eat anything fatty, and if I don’t take a bunch of anti-nausea medication right away, I might end up having a really scary episode of GI pain and vomiting - folks who have witnessed it freak out and start talking about if they should take me to the ER.  Plus a whole bunch of other symptoms. I’m having really weird discomfort under my left rib and the only way to relieve it is to hang upside down or to physically scoop and lift my ribs up and away from my body: this “makes space” for whatever is wrong to expand. I can’t think through the sense of “wrongness”. \n\nThe weird thing is that despite my body feeling like something I am trapped in and having to endure, my mental health is kinda ok. I’m not depressed or sad or hopeless, except for when I think about how hard it is to get anyone to understand how much my body is breaking apart and ruining my life :/  I’m on medical leave, but my Dr is treating it like a “break from work” instead of doing tests or making referrals. Just keeps saying “this too shall pass”.\n\nMy primary care doc has been my go to person, and he has done so much to help my life, but he was unfortunately unavailable the second half of 2022 when my symptoms started/worsened, and currently has very limited resources for testing and non-drug treatment.  He’s not really getting it, despite several appointments with him where I detail all these problems, and at this point I don’t think he will.  The NP’s that I’ve seen this year have been worse, they clearly didn’t have comfort managing the complexity of symptoms I’m struggling with.  \n\nSo who do I see? If you can, if you have any knowledge to share or have been though this before, please help.",

I've decided that my lack of clothing is really holding me back, so I'm working on putting together a capsule wardrobe.

I was raised to believe that women who spent large amounts of money on clothes or were interested in fashion were shallow. Does anyone else suffer from this kind of guilt?\n\nEven though I have spent quite a lot of money so far, it has been in classic pieces, many of which I have dreamed of owning for YEARS and intend to own for years.

I’m the grand scale of things, I’m relatively inexperienced—I’ve had one real relationship (3 years) that ended in 2019 and I haven’t had more than a couple of dates with anyone since then until now. I’ve noticed in the wake of my breakup I’ve developed some avoidant behaviors that I think are rooted in a fear of being vulnerable to a breakup again and I often get into my own head overthinking stuff.\n\nEverything with this new guy is great except I don’t know if I’m attracted to him or not. It seems weird not to know, but how I feel in this situation is different than any other guy I’ve ever gone on dates with. Usually either I have that immediate “spark” or some physical reaction to a guy I’m attracted to, but if the attraction isn’t there even the thought of physical intimacy causes me to tense up and I won’t even attempt it. With this guy I’m experiencing neither of these things and I don’t know what it means. I do like having sex with him, but I also get none of the fluttery feelings I usually get. Every time we hang out there’s an element of “oh right, that’s what you look like,” but maybe that’s because I’m not good with faces and it’s still a new relationship? \n\nI’m worried that this is just my avoidant tendencies rearing up because this is really the first time in years I’ve had a true potential for a relationship, but I also know physical attraction is important in a relationship and I want to understand how I’m feeling sooner rather than later.",

        "text": "I have two very close friends from childhood and over the past 3 years during the pandemic we’ve all become a tight knit friend group. We have all known each other since childhood but up until this point we were friends with each other separately— so we didn’t really talk or plan activities as a group before now.\n\nOne of these friends and I are travel buddies and plan destination trips together. The other friend does not travel as much and we only recently started doing some trips together.\n\nMy question is:\n\nBefore the pandemic my travel friend and I planned a big trip to Australia which we weren’t able to take until now. I feel a little weird now that we didn’t mention it to the other friend, but these are plans we made years ago and are finally pulling the trigger on. I also am pretty sure the other friend is not in a position financially or lifestyle wise to take a trip like this but we never asked. I don’t even think she’d want to do this kind of trip but again I never asked her. Now that we are all so much closer it feels weird to not mention it but im not sure how to bring it up tactfully. I can see that she might feel left out and if so I would want to give her the space for that but make it known that now that we’re more of a closer group we could plan these kinds of trips together next time. Or maybe we’re just insensitive aholes for not thinking of her when we decided to take the trip…",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I am a 30F based in UK and constantly feel like my life is somewhat falling apart and it's making me so upset that I end up in tears every few days. This is going to be a long post so I can cover everything and hopefully get some perspective or advice. Please don't be critical, I have received a lot of unwanted criticism and refrained from talking to family members about my issues because they assume it takes no work to fix things.\n\nTo start off, finances in my life is the only thing I feel is quite strong and healthy because I prioritised that in my 20s so I think that's in a good place. I want to work on my health quite a lot and lose the 10lbs I've gained from the pandemic, I was dealing with severe facial eczema but went to the doctors to get that looked at and has improved a lot which I'm proud of.\n\nThose are the health-related issues, next is career. I've got a degree in Biology and worked in scientific publishing since graduating, I feel so bored however in this role and lately it's bothering me a lot. I'm quite ambitious and tried to get a management position which I got rejected for and then changed directions last year and self-taught front end development (html, css, javascript and react). I ended up loving it and wanted to apply this year except we've gone into a recession and it's getting so much more difficult to keep up hope that it's worth it.\n\nThis is probably the biggest area of concern because I feel stuck in my current place. I think I could get a job that pays £7-10k more aiming for a more senior role (I'm on £35k right now which I'm not happy with but remote role is a big plus for me). I'm so stuck on what to do. I'm not sure whether to wait and go for coding roles once I've finished things up and got my portfolio ready (this is also going to be exhausting and I'm expecting a lot of rejection) or shall I apply for senior roles in my career path to have that change that I really need? (where does that leave coding too). I feel incredibly stuck.",

There was hostility from his side, and me trying to please him in his emotional outbursts to keep the peace at home. In the end I withdrew more and more emotionally. Over the years the passion/sex disappeared and then slowly the love as well. Attempts from me to go to marriage counselling were blocked off by him and then not further pursued by me either. \n\nI always thought if we give it enough time surely the love will come back. Once I’m back at work, once we have help in the household, once we spend more time together, once the kids are a bit older, once the pandemic is over. But it didn’t. We live like room mates.  \n\nIn the past weeks I realised I have a crush on someone else. This suddenly made me understand how very unhappy I am in this relationship. A few weeks ago I spoke for the first time about separating (not about having a crush). My husband is devastated. He says he still loves me. Now he agreed to go to counselling. He’s working on himself and I can see all the effort he’s putting into this. But my emotions are gone. He says he wants to try to save the marriage and if we separate it’s because of me giving up. He says everyone will end up unhappy after the separation I am initiating. He’s willing to work on the relationship and on himself. And that we should give it a few more years. He says if it ends it’s my fault. \n\nI don’t know if the love will come back. And I have to say very honestly I don’t have the Energy to work on this. I’m fed up. Even if he made a 180 I don’t think I’ll love him again. And I feel terrible about it. I feel guilty for having these emotions for another man. I feel terrible for being out of energy with this relationship. I feel terrible for putting everyone through this. I feel terrible for putting my kids through this. I feel terrible for initiating the break up. I feel terrible for putting my own happiness before everyone else’s. \n\nLong story short, how can I find the energy to try to safe this marriage? How long should I give it? I’m scared of the emotional burden I put on my children. Scared of the financial burden. Scared of everything that comes after.",

But I’m now confronted with serious low self esteem. It’s not that I didn’t have it before but this traumatic event pushed me over the edge. SO, I decide it’s time to never feel so shit about myself, life and LOOKS ever again. \n\nI don’t have an hourglass body, I’m decent looking I guess but I’m not a “bombshell”, I have much weight to lose and I’m super reserved. I am working on my weight my eating better, keeping up with grooming etc., but I still feel like shit and most days want to stay in bed or die to be honest. I still feel like I’m not the “trophy” and I have massive complex about being publicly validated (SA trauma, childhood trauma and people acting like they can’t be seen with me in public). I’m a good and kind person and that didn’t help me at all with family, men or friends. It actually screwed me over. My looks or lack thereof didn’t help too. \n\nSo, I know this is a process but given the journey ahead may be long. Does anyone have any tips for me? For me the only end goal is to look in the mirror and feel and look like queen. I can never let anyone break me down to this level again. No fucking way. Help!",

I later was pissed of course when I realized I may date someone who did that when I’m just your friend or I don’t know you heck yeah stupid things/human moments are all love like you idiot come here. This was not my intention at all. We at least said hello. \n\n2nd scenario: Different guy who I have no interest in I just stared. This was a car dealership. The guys there proceeded to be complete f boys towards me. I never even spoke to him at all not even a hello. \n\nTo me I don’t think either of them are truly redeemable without prayer as in there isn’t enough gifts in the world or sweet words to ever make me forgive you so dude #2 is super out like yeah no I just stared at you anyways. First dude: He then had the nerve to yell at me after I caught him doing something stupid like whoooaa wtf?!?!?! I’m a realll stubborn m/f when I want to be so when I say dude you’re done there isn’t sh— you can do to fix it. Personally, I mean it. Second dude had absolutely no reason to even go that far. First one okay maybe in his mind he was legitimately mad 😡 and that was an honest reaction. I’m still pissed you’re still sh— but, both are only human. That’s the problem I think. What people can provide isn’t what I want. Respect is. Love is. You cannot have true real love without respect tho even amongst friends.\n\nQuestion: Am I being too rigid by saying you can even buy me a $60,000 car (not that anyone would) I still am not going to be able to forgive you. To me that feels like you’re trying to buy me off. It’s arbitrary. I don’t even want to forgive first dude if I’m being honest like I just want you to go and never speak to you again. That’s normal me. First dude he won’t accept that thing is I know myself like dude once you’re there nothing can bring you back except prayer really. \n\n@ the gym sauna feels amazing today like a box of love ❤️ joys of it being cold out",

Have a totally awesome dog. And generally, have a nice life. But my god, we are kind of miserable. So fucking stressed and feel stuck in the rat race and bored and kind of like is this all there is?!\n\nBut most importantly, we are both acutely aware that something is off - we’re not living a life authentic to who we are. \n\nBefore we buy a house and possibly (but as of now, not likely) consider kids - we want to figure out how to get on the right track. Is it where we live, or what we’re doing? Likely both.\n\nBut to reset &amp; gain some clarity, we’ve lightly decided we want to just fuck offf for a bit. SO the current dream percolating would be:\n\nQuit our jobs 1 year from now. Then, starting next May - drive across the country with our dog, rent airbnbs in key cities along the way (NOLA, Austin, Denver). Rent a campervan and explore the Utah national parks. Then finish in Tahoe and work and live and South Lake Tahoe for the summer. Summer jobs and/or freelance if I can get it. \n\nWe’d ideally save about $100k before we leave (which is doable) and spent only a small chunk of that on the trip, have cushion for a down payment on a house and some left over?!\n\nI have a working list of questions, considerations, and logistics to figure out for both getting there and returning but the second we thought of it, it kinda felt right. \n\nSo what do you think? Totally crazy, or just crazy enough?",
