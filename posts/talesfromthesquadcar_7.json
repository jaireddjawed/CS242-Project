        "text": "*Disclaimer: I posted this as a response in an AskReddit thread and realized that it would be a good story for this sub.*\n\nThis was about a year ago. I was driving along the freeway around early evening and spotted a van parked on the shoulder. So I pulled up behind it and threw on my rear emergency lights to check on the vehicle. As I was positioning my cruiser behind the van, I noted that the van was newer and in good condition and the window tint on the rear of the vehicle made it too dark to see inside.\n\nI get out and start my approach and I can see the driver in the side view mirror. He's a young Hispanic male dressed in business casual attire texting on a cell phone and it looks like he's alone. Ok cool, he probably just pulled over to send a text. I'll just make sure he isn't having vehicle problems and thank him for not texting while driving. It's getting dark out and we're in a remote area of the freeway where nothing is around except trees. I make it up to the driver's window and he is completely oblivious to my presence, so I knock on the window lightly to get his attention.\n\nI've startled people before and usually they just jump a little. This guy goes into full freak-out mode. He lets out a blood curdling scream, throwing his cell phone into the passenger seat while clutching his chest and staring at me wide-eyed with fear. As soon as the uniform registers in his head he immediately begins laughing hysterically. He's laughing so hard he can barely breathe and talking is out of the question. I'm standing there wondering what is wrong with this guy.\n\nHe rolls down the window and he's able to calm down enough to say something. The first words he says to me are \"I have a dead body in the back.\"\nWhat the fuck.\n\nI blurt out \"You have a dead body in your van?!\" while I glance over his shoulder and I can now see a body bag that appears to be full in the rear of the van.\nHe clarifies \"Oh no, its okay. I'm a funeral home director.\" I tell him that he should probably lead with that instead of the dead body statement in the future.\n\nHe then tells me why he freaked out so bad. He explains that he is transporting this body to another funeral home for the family of the deceased. The family happens to be superstitious and had been texting him non-stop asking if their loved one was going to come back as a spirit and haunt their house. Finally, he decided to pull over in a quiet spot and read the text messages. As he is parked on the side of the road alone with the dead guy, he starts to send a reply to reassure the family that he'd been in the business a long time and they had nothing to fear from the dead haunting the living and then I knock on the window.\n\nWe both had a good chuckle about it.",

        "text": "So I'm actually a locksmith who goes around unlocking people's cars or houses for them when they accidentally lock their keys inside. I have actually had many officers call in. I've lost count how many police vehicles I've had to unlock over the years.  Maybe 20? In fact we don't even charge for cops and in return usually we'll get a warning for speeding instead of a ticket. \n\nAnyway one night really stood out. Got a call to unlock a cop car in a very notoriously sketchy neighborhood in my city. I'm driving there but 20 minutes later it cancels before i even arrived.  Didn't say why. So I went in to the next call, no big deal. \n\n2 hours later I get a call for the very same car, same person, same address. That's weird. \n\nSo I go back there again and when I arrive I see two squad cars. One of them is running with all of its lights on lighting up the entire neighborhood and parked next to this house with a shit ton of crack heads standing on the lawn completely **not** minding their own business and two officers who looked really scared. \n\nSo I go to unlock the car that's running with all the lights on,  and while I'm doing so the two officers inform me that this car had been sitting like this and he's been locked out fir over two hours. Apparently it was never supposed to cancel and whoever called it in was a dumb shit.\n\nAlso apparently this house was the biggest crack house in the entire city. And the guy was so frightened because he was out numbered by all these crack heads like 25 to one. And he's just been standing out here for two fucking hours.  The other guy came as back up and was just laughing at him making fun of him. \"Stupid rookies\"\n\nNo shit went down. I got the car open and we all got out. Definitely the most unique situation I've had in 6 years though. ",

After this ride along, he offered to write me a recommendation letter to the Sgt. in charge of hiring.  \n\n2330. We're patrolling for DUI's. As we drive down O Street, a Silver Honda Accord is coming to a stop at the yellow soon-to-be red light. Immediately after coming to a full stop, the vehicle just floors it hitting the red light in one of the busiest intersections in the city. Having exceeding his daily dose of stupidity from drivers, he responds with \"WHAT THE SHIT!\" as we respond to the obvious violation.  \n\"Dispatch, Code 6\" \"ABC 123, silver honda accord, 2 occupants\" \"Received\"  \nI've never seen anyone pull over so fast. As we approach the car, I'm on the passenger side, FTO's on the opposite. I'm close enough to hear what's happening, standing slightly before the rear window near the trunk. All I hear is a series of \"What?\" as the FTO leans in closer to the window. After the 4th \"What?\", the FTO asks him what language he speaks, and then looks at me and asks \"Do you speak Kurdish?\" \"Yes\" I reply nervously. He waves me over and as I look inside, I see 2 guys with eyes as wide as owls and are trembling because they're scared shitless. I tell them to relax and calm down. \nAfter we get their info and check them out, they drove off with a warning and I went home with a recommendation letter.",

I just want to give everyone a friendly reminder that just because your comfortable in your position, regardless of your 6 months in or 25 years in, never let your guard down and never become complacent.\n\nI don't want to go into detail because it could give away my identity and I really don't want flake from work, but we had an Officer get attacked this week, first time in years an Officer in our facility got attacked. Just doing his/her job, opened the door and got sucker punched and then kicked while he/she was down.\n\nThis can happen to any of us, Correctional Officers, if your a housing unit officer and your face to face with your inmates all day like us, no cage or tower, just you and a desk 12 hours a day, get out of your seat while inmates are close, always keep a safe distance and never stop watching their hands and your back. Just because your well liked in the unit, or your comfortable, or whatever, doesn't mean it can't happen to you, your not superman/woman. During the holiday seasons most of all, these guys can't go home to their families, they are emotional and unpredictable most of the time anyway. \n\nTo those of you on patrol, be careful and always keep that eagle vision going, never stop watching your back, you never know when and where it will happen.\n\nBe safe everybody and happy holidays.

All conversation in the chopper ceased.   \n\"Dispatch to K9\"  \nNo response.  \n\"Dispatch to K9, 10-4 check.\"  \n...  \n\"Dispatch to K9 or any units with him, please respond.\"  \nI have never felt so helpless.   \n\n*Two hours earlier*   \n\n\"S.O. Unit, is your mic secure?\"   \nGreg looked at me.  \"God *dammit!*\"  Whenever dispatch asked that, only bad news could follow.  It wasn't even two hours in shift yet and we initiated a pullover for someone with two brake lights out.   \n \n\"10-4, go ahead\"     \n\n\"Subject is wanted out of a neighboring county for failure to pay child support.  We're checking on extradition - standby.\"  \n\nI laughed.  \"It's just our luck to arrest a guy by 9AM.\"   \nOf course, the warrant was confirmed and we took him in.  Greg was mumbling about it the entire time.  \"It's all your fault, you know.\"  \n\nMy mouth hung open.  \"How is this my fault?\" \n \n\"You saw the brake lights out.\"  This was just the latest round of Greg jokingly blaming me for everything.  The previous day it was my fault it rained.  But the fact remained that he usually was a little more proactive when I rode with him.  We seemed to get into a lot more trouble than usual.  \n\nThat fact was evident when his sergeant called.  \"A pullover and an arrest by 9am?  *Who are you?*\"  \n\"It's my reserve's fault.  He's making me work, Sarge!\"  \n\n\"Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'll throw you a bone.  Head over to aviation and take a break from the road for a while.  We have a slot open for orientation.  \"   \n\nAnd that we did. We arrived at the hanger where our agency kept our three helicopters.  While we were excited for a small break after our arrest, we were expecting a simple classroom and slideshow presentation.  We were quite surprised when one of the pilots threw us some headphones and told us to get on board.  \n\n5 minutes into our flight, we received two separate alarm calls indicating bank holdup.  We hovered over the first one, which already had some units responded.  After a few minutes circling around, we realized it was a false alarm.  Then dispatch pipped up.  \n\n\"Hold traffic on channel one for units responding to bank hold up.  Be advised, this is not a false alarm.  I repeat, not a false alarm.\"   \n\nWithout any conversation, I felt the helicopter jerk as we hauled ass to the other side of town.  \n\n\"P.D. Unit to Dispatch, I have a vehicle description. Silver sedan, full size.  White male in the passenger seat was holding another white male hostage at gunpoint.  They robbed the bank through the drive thru.  Chopper 1, please advise.\"  \n\nA carjacking and bank robbery.  Shit just got real.   \n\nWe circled around the area of the bank, trying to guess where the vehicle went.  None of us had any luck finding it.  Then we got another update from dispatch.  \n\n\"All units, be advised of a possible related carjacking at the CVS down the street.  White sedan with a tan roof.  Last seen headed down Main St.\"   \n\nWe flew over there.  Before we even got on scene, Dispatch pipped up again.  \"Be advised, 911 call from carjacking victim.  Suspect bailed at the train tracks crossing Main St.  Chopper 1 and all units, please respond.  Suspect confirmed armed.\"   \n\n\"Sargent to K9 unit, report on scene.\"  \n\nThe Sargent of K9 ended up responding on scene.  We stationed over head in circling patterns while K9 and 3 other deputies went into the wooded area below us.   \n\n\"Chopper 1 to K9, we are right overhead you, though the foilage is too thick to see anything.  Break.  Dispatch, I advise sending a unit to the horse ranch North of the woods.  There is also an elementary school on the eastern boarder.\"   \n\n\"Lieutenant to dispatch.  Order the school on lockdown.\"   \n\nAll we could do is keep circling.  The trees were so thick we couldn't even see our K9, much less the armed subject they were after.  Then we heard the Lieutenant's voice on the radio.  What he said made my heart stop.   \n\n\"Shots fired.\" The supervisor's voice dropped like a hammer on the radio. All conversation in the chopper ceased.  \n\"Dispatch to K9\"  \nNo response.   \n\"Dispatch to K9, 10-4 check\"  \n...  \n\"Dispatch to K9 or any units with him, please respond.\"   \n\nI have never felt so helpless.   Both Greg and I clicked on our headsets, imploring our pilot to find a place to land.  My hand found my sidearm as I was mentally preparing myself to jump out the chopper as soon as the skids hit the field we were starting to descend towards.  I couldn't breath.  We could see a multitude of cars rushing down the rail road tracks.  Then the radio clicked again.   \n\n\"K9 to all units, shots fired confirmed.  Suspect opened fire.  We're okay, suspect is injured.  Standby, I have to check on the dog.\"   \n\nAs relieved as I was to hear none of our officers were hit, my mind flashed back to a few years ago when our agency had a K9 killed on a track similar to this one.  I prayed for it's safety.   \n\nWe ascended again and got a good view of the tracks, where 4 vehicles with the reds and blues waited.  I smiled as I saw a dog jumping up and down on his owner.  He was okay.   \n\n\"All units, suspect is in custody.  We are awaiting transport to the hospital.\"    \n\nWith Greg and I's services needed back on the ground to cover for the units that would be on scene for the rest of the day, the chopper landed and we went back 10-8.   \n\nGreg looked at the clock as we pulled out of the airport.  \"For fuck's sake, it isn't even noon.\"   \n\nThe suspect was bit twice, shot twice (one center mass, one in the knee) and even tased.  Bastard was wearing a ballistic vest that saved his life.  He ended up confessing to a multitude of bank robberies in various states.  No officers were injured, the furry ones included.",

        "text": "“Honestly? I don’t give a crap what happens. I just want to get out of here.” Biggs had his arms crossed and was leaning away from the prosecutor who had just asked him his preference for the outcome of the weed case we were being held hostage on. \n\n“Well, the reason I ask is this guy has a terrible record. This is his fourth possession charge in a year and his priors for robbery, distribution, and the gun stuff would go a long way towards the judge throwing the book at him.” The prosecutor, Jim, seemed put off by our lack of enthusiasm in this case.\n\n“Listen,” I started. “We had to work until four o’clock this morning. We’re due back in three hours. We’ve been here since nine. Honestly, either a plea deal or a continuance would go a long way towards insuring we can grab a little down time before our next ten hours. We’ll grab this guy when we see him next time on the street. He’s always dirty.” While it was true our job as “Repeat Offender” detectives was to get long jail terms for exactly the type of guy awaiting his verdict before the judge, the louder truth at the moment was that we were dog tired. The amount of time we spent in criminal court on these petty marijuana cases was definitely starting to wear us thin. Besides, the judge “throwing the book” at the offender would most likely result in a fine and under a year in jail – not exactly the decade long terms we were aiming for. \n\n“Ok. I’ll talk to his attorney and see what he’s agreeable to. You’re basically saying you don’t want to go to trial, right?”\n\n“Right.” Biggs and I said simultaneously. Jim stalked off in search of the opposing lawyer. \n\n“You owe me a Coke.” Biggs said.\n\n“What?” \n\n“You know. Jinx, you owe me a Coke.” \n\n“What are you talking about?” I reached into the threadbare pocket of my old, cheap suit, fishing for my phone. \n\n“If two people say the same thing at the same time, it’s ‘Jinx, you owe me a coke’.” He was a little taken aback by my naivety. \n\n“No.” Was all I replied and he chuckled before fishing out his own phone. \n\nI hadn’t missed any pressing matters judging by the lack of messages on my phone. I sighed and leaned back onto the uncomfortable sofa in the crowded hallway. Biggs pulled the same maneuver a few seconds later and we alternatively let out frustrated sighs. A child having a meltdown provided some temporary entertainment but otherwise time seemed to crawl. Every time I checked the clock on my phone I was hopeful for the passage of enough time to harken the end to our torture. Amazingly, time flowed in one to two minute intervals no matter what my perception of its passing would otherwise indicate. I sighed again, not looking forward to the long evening ahead. \n\nJim showed up eventually, red faced and out of breath. “So, I talked with the attorney.” He trailed off. \n\n“And?” Biggs asked. \n\n“And he says he’s ok with a plea but we can’t come to terms with the recommended sentence.”\n\nI leaned back and exhaled my annoyance. \n\n“I know, I know. I just think nine months in jail with six suspended and a five hundred dollar fine is more than appropriate.” Jim continued. Biggs rolled his eyes. \n\n“And I think six months with five suspended is better.” The defense attorney had been passing by and apparently overheard Jim.\n\n“It’s his fourth charge on the same offense! Within a year!” Jim turned back to his adversary. \n\n“It’s just weed!” The defense attorney countered. Biggs and I nodded in unison with his argument. \n\n“Yes, but clearly the system isn’t teaching him to follow the rules. The only way to assure that happens is to remove him from temptation for a while.” Jim was clearly still fresh in his career, not yet jaded with a lack of faith in the “system.”\n\n“Oh, and I’m sure he’ll follow through with rehab.” The defense attorney added sarcastically. \n\n“Better for him to be in jail for those three months and not on the outside robbing people for weed money.” \n\nThe defense attorney’s brow furrowed with scorn and confusion. “Have you ever smoked weed? Robbing people for weed money? I’d be surprised if he left the Xbox and Cheetos for anything when he’s baked.”\n\nI shot Biggs a glance and realized he was also trying to stifle a smile. \n\n“How about you talk to your client and come back with a better excuse than just ‘I don’t want to even try to offer this plea.’ That’s your job. Mine is to decide what’s best for the state.” Jim turned his back on the defense attorney as conspicuously as possible and rolled his eyes. \n\nThe defense attorney lingered a moment, glaring at Jim with burning contempt. He swiveled on his heel to depart but stopped mid-stride and turned back. “Or, we can try things a different way.” He growled. For a moment, I thought I was going to have to break up a fight in the courthouse – an occurrence not unheard of but usually not between attorneys.\n\n“Yes?” Jim replied with annoyance, pretending to search through the papers in his hands for something and keeping his back to the defense attorney. \n\n“I can get my guy to buy a plea, even the bullshit one you’re offering. He’s ripe to just get on with his life and is used to doing jail time. For me to do so in good conscience, however, I feel like we need to at least come to an agreement. Since we can’t talk it out like reasonable adults, I propose we do something a little less… refined.”\n\nJim looked up from his papers with an angry and confused glare. “What? Just get to the point.”\n\n“Arm wrestle me.”\n\nJim scoffed. “What? Arm wrestle. Like, you versus me?” \n\n“Yeah. You win, I get him to plea to nine months. I win, he gets six.”\n\nJim shifted his weight in discomfort and looked up and down the courthouse hall, seeing if anyone else was hearing what he was still unsure had just been proposed. “Arm wrestling?”\n\n“Yeah. It’s pretty simple. These two will be our judges and witnesses. We go into one of the interview rooms. You versus me, mano a mano. Winner take all.” \n\nI looked over to Biggs again and saw he was no longer able to control the smirk spreading across his face. I felt the same. Whatever was about to happen was sure to be epic. \n\nJim sighed and turned back to the defense attorney. “Yeah?”\n\n“Yeah.” Confidence oozed from the attorney’s pores. \n\n“Biggs, EMR, let’s go.” Jim stalked to the closest interview room, a few feet away and knocked on the door before entering. Biggs and I scrambled to catch up, giggling like school yard kids about to see a fist fight. The defense attorney lingered behind a moment, making a ritual of placing his briefcase on the couch, folding his sports coat carefully on top, unbuttoning his sleeves, and then rolling them up behind his elbows. He cracked his fingers and smiled as he entered the door I was holding for him. \n\nJim was in the corner, untying his tie before shrugging off his suit jacket and hanging it on the coat rack. “Don’t worry boys,” The defense attorney assured me and Biggs. “This will all be over in a minute.”\n\nJim rolled his shoulders and I noticed the muscles swelling under the sateen dress shirt. He twisted his neck and an audible crack was heard by us all. The defense attorney, still inflated with bravado, seemed to sink in his chair just a little. With his back still to us, Jim unbuttoned his shirt and placed it on the coat rack as well. Above the collar of his wife beater, an Irish flag tattoo with something written in Gaelic was visible. Jim stretched his arms across his chest, one by one, then turned to us silent witnesses. Biggs and I weren’t in the same place as the defense attorney so we openly guffawed. Jim didn’t seem like that kind of guy.\n\n“What?” He asked. “I work out.”\n\nThe defense attorney cleared his throat and tore his gaze from Jim as he set up his elbow on the table. \n\n“Make sure no one comes in.” Jim ordered. I complied without hesitation. \n\nJim got comfortable in his seat then placed his elbow on the table as well. He forcibly exhaled as he gripped the defense attorney’s hand. I noticed the attorney’s eyes widen slightly but he made no other indication he was doubting himself. \n\n“Biggs, can you start us?” Jim asked. His stony gaze was burrowing into his opponent’s forehead. \n\n“Yes!” Biggs answered with a little too much enthusiasm. He gripped both men’s hands, asked if they were ready, and then said “GO!” as he released them. \n\n_____________________\n\n\n“I understand the defendant has agreed to a plea?” The judge asked from his podium. \n\nBiggs and I were in the designated officer pew. The defendant stood next to his brooding attorney to our left. \n\n“Yes your honor.” Jim answered. \"And the state recommends a sentence of not less than nine months in jail, not more than six of those months suspended.”\n\n“And sir,” The judge continued, addressing the accused now. “Your lawyer has explained to you what a plea entails? That you will most likely receive some sort of jail time as part of your sentence.”\n\n“Yes yer highness.” The defendant hesitantly spoke into the microphone in front of him. \n\n“Very well. I find the defendant guilty, impose a jail term of nine months, six suspended as per the state’s recommendation. Also, I’ll impose a five hundred dollar fine, none of which is suspended. You are remanded to the custody of the sheriffs. Next case, state versus Jones. Is Mr. Jones here?” \n\nJim first glanced to the defense attorney, who was doing his best to ignore him, then to me and Biggs. He nodded knowingly to us, then turned back to the judge. “The state has a recommendation in this case as well, your honor.”\n",

        "text": "When I went in for my polygraph (those things are ridiculous witch-hunt tech from the dark ages of mysticism and Scientology, but I digress) for a federal law enforcement agency, I had been in the hiring process for almost two years. All my eggs were in this single basket by that point. I was working two jobs, my wife had a job, and we were still so far below the poverty line that we couldn't see it on a cloudless day. I had nearly been fired just for taking the time needed for interviews, tests,  and the like. The night before my polygraph, my wife told me she was pregnant with our second child.\n\nNo pressure.\n\nIt was over eight hours straight of interrogation, with no food and only a single bathroom break where the \"interviewer\" escorted me and even waited for me inside the bathroom, outside of the stall.  By the end of it I was emotionally broken. On my face was the expression of a man who had failed everything and everyone he held dear. \n\nHe flat out told me that I was lying on a question (have you ever commited a serious crime that you were never caught for) about 5 hours in, and most of the rest of the time consisted of him berating me for being a lier and grilling me again and again. \"What did you do?\" \"Have you ever commited a serious crime?\" \"Stop lying to me.\" \"Tell me what you did!\" This guy was nasty, snapping at me repeatedly and treating me like garbage half the time.\n\nThat was it. Done. I was trying to figure out how to break it to my wife that I had failed her, our daughter, and now our unborn child. How many more years would we be trying to survive on foodstamps and choosing which bills didn't get paid that month? Was I doomed to work 70 hour weeks with no benefits for the rest of my life? *It's over. It's all over. Everything that I have aspired to be for years is going down the drain. I've failed them.*\n\nAll because of this garbage voodoo machine.  The current applicant failure rate for the poly was about 48%. It was literally a coin toss and I'd lost everything over it. The sense of loss was overpowering.\n\n\"Okay, Mr. Letum, we are going to go over this question one final time, and then we'll call it a day.\" His voice rings with a restrained calm. \"You have *got* to tell me the truth this time. Ready? Now. Have you *ever* commited a serious crime? Even if you were never caught?\"\n\n(Pained, and a bit sharply) \"No!\"\n\n(With perceptible irritation) \"You have to answer the question calmy, Sanctus, or it throws the machine off.\"\n\n*Breathes* \"No. . .\"\n\n\". . . Fine. Have it your way then.\"\nHe slams his papers on the table, and begins typing up on the computer. Five minutes of silence go by. I'm still plugged into that damned machine, trying to figure out what to tell my wife. My head falls into my hands. \n\nFinally, he addresses me. Business like.\n\n\"Alright, Mr. Letum. We're done here. You know that I have to send this to a second agent for review, so the official determination technically can't been made yet. If you hear anything from our department in the next two weeks, that means you failed, and you will be ineligible to reapply. \n\nHonestly though, I wouldn't worry about it if I were you. I've been doing these for almost ten years, and frankly. This is one of the smoothest polygraphs I've ever administered. You should be fine.\"\n\nAnd that right there, ladies and gentlemen, is the exact moment when I nearly DID commit a serious crime.",

        "text": "All of the following occurred during a single 12-hour shift. \n\nThis was back when The Fast and the Furious movie series was big, and street racing was a big problem. We were given overtime money to work weekend nights, primarily for the purpose of finding street racers, taking their cars, and taking the drivers to jail. If you drove any sort of sports car in a certain area of the city, you were getting stopped. \n\nWe weren't the only ones on shift. That night we had about 10 of our own State Police units, approximately 20 of the local police, and 5 or so Sheriff's Deputies. The state was getting tired of all the mayhem and deaths the various car crashes were causing, and they wanted to let the public know.\n\nBefore each weekend, we'd head out to dinner as a shift. Shift started at 6PM, but the action rarely happened before 10. We were on our way to the usual spot when I checked a random license plate on a parked car using my computer (my partner, Johnson, was driving). It came back stolen.\n\nWe always confirm stolen plates over the radio since our computer has older information than what Dispatch has. I sent it over the air, and all I got was static back. We had new radios that \"fixed a lot of the problems of the old ones,\" except for getting significantly worse reception. I used my phone to call Dispatch instead. Dispatch advised me it was coming back clear, and provided an address for the owner exactly where we were at. The dispatcher expressed her relief over the phone, \"Oh thank goodness. We're 5 minutes into shift and I was afraid this was an indicator of what tonight would be like.\" The same dispatcher worked the weekend before, which we nearly called the National Guard for, but that's another story.\n\nJohnson and I continued back on towards dinner when we got a call of a crash with limited details. People were calling it in, saying someone on the freeway spun out and crashed into the center divide. We were an overtime unit, so that wasn't our call to look into. A nearby beat unit headed that way, but the Sergeant told us to check as well. An ambulance was on the way to it, so we wanted to be safe rather than sorry.\n\nFive minutes later, the beat unit couldn't find it, the ambulance couldn't find it, and the tow truck couldn't find it, so we canceled our response. This type of thing happens more than you'd think; people who are drunk or have no license crash into a wall, then just keep driving.\n\nWe finally made it to dinner. After eating, we headed out to, as a more senior officer put it, \"Ruin some people's night.\" It started out slow, just like normal. We stopped a bunch of people for broken headlights and taillights, seeing if anyone might've had a few drinks too many. All verbal warnings, no drunks yet.\n\nAn hour into cruising around, Johnson got himself lost. We rolled down a street and I ran another plate on a beat-up taxi cab. It stuck out, being parked in a residential area. Stolen. Who steals a taxi? This time dispatch confirmed it was stolen, so we rolled a tow truck and got it back to the owner. By some coincidence (or not), we heard a report of a man with a gun on his roof at that same address a day later.\n\nOnce we cleared from the stolen car, we spotted an Oldsmobile with a burnt out headlight and pulled a quick u-turn to make a new friend. Once we were behind it, we spotted his registration was years expired. If you're dealing with State Police, that's a guaranteed way to get a ticket. You don't get to drive on the roads and not pay for them. Since I recovered the taxi, it was Johnson's turn get some paperwork. After contacting the driver, Johnson came back to me. \"Should I tow it?\" I told him, \"It's been expired for *three years.* Yeah, you should tow it.\" The legal limit is only a few months. If we didn't tow it, the Sergeant wouldn't be too happy.\n\nI started filling out the tow form for Johnson while he contacted another one of our happy customers. I watched the driver open the trunk to reveal enough junk to fill a small bedroom. After some complaining and arguing, the driver unloaded what he could. Not happy with our level of service, the driver pulled out a camera, filmed us, and got our name and ID numbers. \"Officer, what's your name?\" He asked me first. \"Officer 2BlueZebras, ID 1234.\" I pulled my jacket so he could clearly see my name tag and badge. I feel bad taking someone's car when their registration is only a few months past due, which is why I don't do it. But when they're pushing more than 5x what the law allows, you're not going to get sympathy from me. That's no longer an honest mistake.\n\nA little while later one of our units put out a pursuit. Older model Accord, no license plates. We hauled ass trying to get there, when he put out that the Accord had crashed and the driver fled on foot. A couple seconds later he came back over the air, panting, \"One in custody, all clear.\" We showed up 10 seconds later to find 3 more of our units and 10 of the local PD on scene. No concern about backup tonight. The Accord came back stolen, and the driver was still in high school. Bright future for him.\n\nWe heard over the radio a pack of 50 to 100 cars was seen outside the city. Nothing further at that time, but I didn't think that'd be the end of it.\n\nOur K-9 unit came out over the air with another pursuit. Large man on a Harley motorcycle. About 10 seconds later it was cancelled as he sped off through a narrow corridor and the patrol car couldn't follow.\n\nNot long afterwards we rolled by a Ford van that seemed out of place. Stolen. Johnson took the paperwork on that one. We happened to park behind a Civic while we waited for the tow to show up. Once the tow arrived, he asked, \"Is it the Honda?\" Johnson shot back, \"Nope, for once, it isn't.\" All it takes to steal a Civic is a screw driver, and the thieves are well aware.\n\nWe got another call on that pack of cars outside the city, 10 minutes out. 50 to 100 cars racing and doing burnouts. The Sergeant requested we head up that way, so we did. Halfway there the first unit says they're all gone, unknown direction. One of the units who stayed in the city reported they knew where they went, since they were looking at them back in the city. We headed back in a hurry, but they were all scattered by the time we showed up.\n\nMoments later the Sheriff put out a pursuit on the freeway, chasing a yellow truck with no plates and they wanted us to take over. They don't chase, but we do. Johnson and I were set up at the perfect spot. We merged on and spotted a Deputy with his Christmas lights all lit up...but didn't see any yellow truck. He exited, we followed, and he shut his lights down. That left us wondering...what just happened?\n\nAnother State Police unit had been around the corner at the exit, handling a prisoner. I found out a day later that the truck roared by him, as he jumped out of the way and watched the truck get air-born over some railroad tracks. \n\nThe night was coming to a close, and it was pretty much a bust for catching any street racers. But after doing this for weeks, it suggested our presence was working.\n\nJohnson and I headed up the highway to see if we could find any late night drunk drivers to get off the road. We were cruising over a bridge, doing about 80mph in the fast lane, about to head out of our area and turn around when I heard the wwwwoooooooOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMmmmmmmmmm Doppler effect from a vehicle quickly gaining on us, then passing us. I looked to the slow lane and saw a black sportbike blow by at around 120mph. I let out a, \"Whoa!\" and pointed to it, which caught Johnson's attention. He punched the gas to the floor and I grabbed the mic to let Dispatch know we were about to be in a pursuit.\n\nI stopped, and held the mic in my hand while I considered our options. Johnson looked at me, \"What do we do?\" I put the mic down, as I watched the motorcycle continue on, weaving in and out of cars. I replied, \"Nothing.\" He gave me a surprised look, \"Nothing?\" I explained, \"Yep. Look at that, he's gone already. We'd be out of area, and the other area would have no time to get into position. Let him go.\"\n\nThirty seconds later we heard a broadcast over the radio for some of the other units, \"Outside units, return back to your area per the neighboring Sergeant. They're short and dealing with a fatal collision.\" Johnson gave me a look like we may have just seen a dead man riding. I pulled up the collision and it was involving cars only, no motorcycles, and no where near our biker friend.\n\nAbout a minute later we were back over the bridge, in our area, when a call came out. \"Beat Unit 1, we have reports of a van into the right side wall at 120th Street. It's currently blocking the far right lanes. Ambulance and fire are responding.\" I looked at Johnson, \"We should probably go to that. Dispatch, show City Unit 2 en route.\" We were currently so far away we weren't even at the numbered streets yet, so it was going to be a long response time.\n\nBy the time we showed up, another unit was on scene setting up flares, as was an ambulance and fire. I decided I'd take the paperwork on this, and contacted the driver, who was on the right shoulder, next to her obliterated van. The paramedics were talking to her, and getting her to sign a form saying she didn't need any medical treatment. I got out my typical first statement, \"Are you injured?\" She replied, \"No, I'm okay.\" The smell of alcohol hit me like a freight train. Not a big surprise considering she crashed on a straight, empty freeway. The paramedic whispered to me, \"I think she might have been drinking.\" I thanked Captain Obvious for his observation.\n\nI went through the tests, which were completely unnecessary from a standpoint of her being completely wasted, but legally necessary for when she fought her charges in court. She walked away from a major collision without a scratch, but once the handcuffs went on she turned into a crying mess. That may sound cold, but I've arrested plenty of people who maintain their composure. \n\nWhile at the crash scene, another unit stopped a guy who drove through the flares. He was also arrested for being drunk. A minute later, someone else crashed into a group of cars that was slowing for the crash scene. Also drunk. The existence of alcohol is unfortunate job security.\n\nI called my drunk driver's husband at her request so he'd know where she was. I explained she was in a crash, uninjured, but under arrest, and she'd be able to call him in a few hours. He was alright with that, or as alright as anyone could be. We did the required chemical tests, and she returned more than double the legal limit. No matter how long I do this job, how people think they can drive like that will never make sense to me. They can't stand up, but they're apparently fine to operate heavy machinery.\n\nOne of the other units found a drunk driver and passed him off to us for transport to the jail. Both prisoners spoke the same second language, so they kept each other company. The gentleman not in the crash had two priors arrests for the same thing, and generally didn't care about the consequences of what he'd done.\n\nWe finally got to the jail and dropped them off, but not without the female constantly complaining about how it was taking too long. She didn't understand why it was such a big deal when no one ever got hurt. At this point I was on over over-time, over my 12 hour scheduled shift.\n\nJohnson and I drove back in silence, just straight tired. All to do it again the next day.",

        "text": "So I feel like I owe you guys a more exciting story, since you guys stuck through my first one. \n\nThis happened a few years back, when I was considerably more foolhardy. At the time I was spending a couple hours a day, five or six days a week doing MMA, and I thought I was hot shit. This was the summer I broke both my hands and had entirely unrealistic notions about my ability to take care of myself. I had no fear. If I could break my knuckles, I could surely punch hard enough to break other people's bones, right? So obviously, I could take care of myself. As a result, I made some decisions then that I would never make now. \n\nI don't remember how I met him, it might have been at a club or online. I don't actually remember his name anymore, but from henceforth he shall be referred to as Adam. Either way, I definitely did not know him well enough to drive 45 minutes to the bonfire he was having. He lived with what I would find out to be his amazingly sweet foster family in a semi-finished room above the garage. When I got there, he and a couple other guys were having beers and had clearly imbibed in a variety of other illicit substances. With what I can only describe as an utter lack of self preservation, I merrily accepted the hard cider I was offered and introduced myself. We will refer to his friends as Cheech and Chong. \n\nWell the three of them had gotten so stoned the bonfire idea must have gone out the window at some point, and it quickly became clear Adam had a couple pill prescriptions he was crushing and snorting. I kept to my cider. There was the usual party banter, some drinking games, and then someone - I think it was Cheech - mentioned fishing. In the middle of the night. Well hell, why not.\n\nApparently Adam lived near a pond, and his neighbor had a canoe he let the neighborhood kids borrow. So we grabbed ourselves a couple back up beers, the tacklebox and fishing poles and trundled off down across the cool august grass snickering the whole way. We manage to get ourselves loaded up into the canoe without capsizing the thing (a miracle, really) and carried on the drunken bantering. We didn't catch a damn thing of course, because I'm sure every fish, frog and mosquito in a two mile radius was acutely aware of our presence.  \n\nI learned a little bit more about Adam. Apparently, he recently returned home from the west coast, where he had been treated for a shrapnel injury at a VA hospital. He was about my age, with striking blue eyes and a wide, infectious grin. I've also never met someone so singularly focused on getting into trouble. He was the real life embodiment of a 22 year old Calvin, minus the stuffed tiger. It had been he who had suggested the midnight fishing expedition, if that wasn't already obvious. I also learned he had taken up massage therapy. At this point dumbshit CookieMonsterFarts was drunk, floating on a pond under the moon, getting a shoulder rub with three people she barely knew, miles from home, and feeling pretty damn smug about her entirely reckless decision making. \n\nAt this point, I would like to apologize to all the daughters of TFTSC readers who just had their curfews moved up. \n\nAnyway, I digress. Somehow we made it back to Adams house without drowning or angering any neighbors. Chong went home, and Adam, Cheech and I managed to get spare air mattresses inflated and passed out.\n\nThe next morning was a brilliant, sunny August day and the hangover was equally memorable. Not to be discouraged, Adam decided we had to make a second attempt at fishing, or at least go swimming, this time at a lake nearby. Cheech and Adam decided to get stoned and take some of the pills Adam had. It was clear to me by this point Adam perpetually existed in a state of intoxication in some form or another, so this was business as usual for him. Cheech, however, was not as seasoned. I offered to drive.\n\nAdams next idea was to stop at the liquor store. I waited in the car, watching him saunter back across the lot like a hawk. As fool hardy as I was, it had become abundantly clear I was going to have to be the voice of reason. He had a bag of nips, and made an attempt to casually plop down in the front passenger seat with the bag in his cargo pants pocket. Cheech is still in the back seat, giggling now and again but otherwise being pretty quiet. I insist Adam puts the liquor in the trunk until we get to the lake. After a few flirtatious attempts to get me to reconsider and testy insistence on my part, I finally got him to put the booze in the trunk. We head out.\n\nMaybe ten minutes go by before I catch Adam downing a nip. Goddamnit.\n\nI pulled over and refused to start the car again until he emptied all his pockets of nips into the trunk. \n\nAnother ten minutes. Adam had found my bikini top and had put it on, and was taking selfies. Cheech was looking a little bug eyed. It was then that I started to question what I got myself into. \n\nWe continued on the scenic country roads, Adam giving directions as we went. We were getting closer, the woods were thickening and pickup trucks with kayaks in the back and other lake type traffic was passing us. Despite the rough start, the day looked promising. \n\nThe road became narrower and the pavement became less well maintained. My little late 90's civic forged on dutifully, the leaky exhaust growling like an indignant lion that just inhaled helium. Pavement gave way to dirt, but Adam assured me this was in fact the correct way. I was doing maybe 35-40 miles an hour down this dirt road, impatient to get to the lake and get these boys out of my car. We are certainly seeing a lot of park traffic, so it seemed like we were getting closer. We passed a park ranger in a 4x4. My poor, faithful civic was bouncing off potholes in the dirt. I asked again if he's sure this is the right way, and Adam insists it is. Cheech was now giggling wildly, but I was not paying much attention to what he was saying, as I was focused on the increasingly overgrown road.\n\nA few more minutes go by and I noticed the park ranger behind me. I slow to a stop. I prepare my documents and roll down my window, shooting Adam an accusatory look. \n\n\"What the fuck are you doing going 40 mph down a hiking trail?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, what?\" \n\nThe park ranger explains he saw us take a turn down the trail a ways back and he followed to tell me the trail was foot traffic only. I apologized and explained I wasn't from the area and was following my friends directions. Adam, meanwhile, was back in his shirt looking very somber and respectful, nodding in commiseration, and adding little \"Yes, Sir\"s here and there corroborating what I was explaining. At this point, I was acutely aware that Cheech was not in the car, but rather the moon, and bouncing down a hiking trail hadn't helped any. I begin to pray the park ranger doesn't notice Cheech. It occured to me I was past questioning what I got myself into, and firmly in flying-by-the-seat-of-my-pants territory. \n\nI do an 80 point turn and followed the park ranger back up the trail, much slower this time. I pull out my gps and managed to get us to the lake with a combination of firm questioning and google. (The beach didn't have an address I could just type in) \n\nCheech seems to have gotten his sea legs under him and has perked up by the time we got changed and down to the water.  The kayaks were all rented out, so we swam in the swimming area for a bit. It is then that Adam has another idea. He explained that up a ways, there is a rope swing he and his friends used to always jump from. We all take off swimming along the shore, away from the netted off swimming area, toward the large oak tree with the rope hanging from it. We were treading water looking up at this way too short rope, trying to figure out how to reach it, when a police boat pulls up.\n\n\"I'm going to have to ask you to get out of the water, there's no swimming outside of the designated swimming area.\"\n\nYou've got to be fucking kidding me. \n\nninja edit: a word\n",

        "text": "I am going to preface this by saying I don't have a very exciting story, but I love this subreddit so I want to do my part in keeping it active by contributing content. \n\nLast night I was invited by my friends to go dancing in my old hometown. I've had my share of encounters with the department over the years, and every officer I've had the opportunity (or misfortune) to interact with has been impeccably polite, fair, and has really reinforced my perception that they genuinely care about the town. Given that the surrounding cities have a reputation for looking for the tiniest potential infraction to ticket, allegedly to meet quotas, and are known for being kind of unforgiving hardasses, it's something that makes me proud of the town I grew up in. This story happened just last night, and combined with the cumulative interactions I've had, it's a good illustration of how they interact with the community. The brilliant part about it was the officer said all of two sentences to me. \n\nNow to set the scene a little bit, I am a college age female and incorrigible motorhead. My car in of itself could be considered Touble, if you know what you're looking at. I keep it stock looking and as subtle as I can, but there are still tell-tale signs here and there that it isn't just a people-mover; it sits aggressively on stock wheels, the otherwise immaculate white paint has a touch of tire smoke residue around the rear wells, and the de-badged trunk gives it a humble yet implicit \"*I have something to be humble about*\" look. When I'm not commuting to and from class, I track it on the weekends, and I try to resist the temptation to romp on it at every light and drift every corner. \n\nWith that being said, every time I pass a cop, I get butterflies. There's always that fevered moment as I check to make sure I wasn't going faster than I thought I was, or that I had removed the blue tape numbers from my side panels, or I didn't take off from that green light with a bit too much gusto back there. Maybe it's just being around my knuckleheaded friends, or the fact that street racing is such a problem in my state (which escalated to the state police using two impounded *sick* 3000GT VR4s to catch a bunch of street racers in the most badass sting ever, but that's a story for another time). I know that speed trap is to keep me in check, not the soccer mom behind me on the way to get groceries. \n\nSo we show up, a small convoy of bmw 3 series' and mustangs, park and hurry across the cold parking lot and into the noisy club. I'm teetering around on 5 inch glorified stilts and freezing my ass off in a mini dress. My friend, this pocket-sized marine biology major, is razzing me about not wearing flats. \n\n\"Guys don't like the tall girls as much. They like to feel big and strong. Here, you have to move your booty if you want to get the guys,\" she's insistent. I'm alternating skeptical looks between her and the sea of screen-printed button ups and sweaty foreheads. My drink tastes like cola flavored nail polish remover. \n\nWe find a corner of the dance floor and spend the night dancing like demented monkeys. I don't order a second plastic cup of nail polish remover, but my friend does, becoming more assertive in her attempts to play Night at the Roxbury Matchmaker. By the time last call rolls around and we are herded out into the cool night air, my legs are noodles and my ears are ringing. I am exhausted, cold, and my head feels like a fishbowl. \n\nLo and behold, the parking lot is awash in flashing blue light. There must be six or seven cruisers outside of this club, in the parking lot. Radios bark out across the cold night air and officers are standing around. I catch a wave of exhausted anxiety as I look for the reason behind so many units in the lot. However, if anything had happened it was handled, and now the officers were looking to intercept potential drunk drivers before they pulled out of the lot and redirect them to the idling cabs.\n\nI pick my way through the rows of cars, my knees traitorously wobbling, knowing full well I had multiple officers watching myself and the people around me for signs of intoxication. Such as stumbling. Then I see it, there - a row over under a street lamp - my lovely racecar blocked in by a cruiser. Now I'm thinking, *what if I ask them to move the cruiser and flat out tell me no, you're stumbling all over? what if my tired legs go all noodley on the clutch and I stall out in front of all these people?* Stalling my car in front of witnesses is my greatest daily fear, as any and all credibility as a car girl seems to out the window the second you stall. This social anxiety is intensified one hundred-fold by the audience of drunk frat-bros (yo) and police officers. Hell, I am already mortified my sadistic, inhumane footwear is going to cause me to trip and eat pavement, all of which was going to bring me under mortifying scrutiny. \n\nI am a shy girl. I once got a C on an oral presentation because I got such bad stage fright when the computer died in the middle of the slide show. Instead of continuing reading off my note cards, I turned sheet white, and then green, and without a word sat down. Public embarrassment is my kryptonite. I would rather take the subpar grade than continue to flounder in front of all those people.  \n\nAnyway, I hobble closer to my car and cast a questioning, if not flagrantly pleading look at the closest officer. I'm pretty sure I look like a mildly retarded, new born giraffe that was now inexplicably about to attempt a conversation. I ask him if everything was okay, partially out of concern, partially to make sure I didn't inadvertently stumble through a crime scene or otherwise embarrass myself.  \n\n\"Yeah everything is fine. Just making sure everyone gets home safe,\" the officers voice is firm, but kind. The cruiser moves so I can get to my car. Just like that, my social anxiety was squelched.\n\nI make it to my car and pry off the evil homages to Chinese foot binding. I feel much less noodly and more grounded now that I'm out of the shoes. I manage to back out smoothly and navigate around a pair of dropped sunglasses without crushing them, all without stalling or making any sloppy shifts. My friends make it off safe, and no one gets into any trouble. I drive home, thoroughly pleased with myself.\n\nIt was a tiny, likely insignificant interaction for the officer, but his and his colleague's demeanor collectively was one that conveyed that all important sense of community. They could have set up a check point around the corner up the street and nabbed the same people they redirected to the idling cabs. It would have served the same end, in terms of keeping DUI's off the road. But mostly, it was 2am, cold as a yetti's ballsack, and I'm sure the officer didn't want to be standing around babysitting a bunch of sweaty, smelly 20 somethings in various states of undress and intoxication. He could have come off bored, or tired, or curt, or anything reflective of how the situation must have felt working then, and no one would have faulted him. Instead he was nice, and reassuring. I'm still skeptical about why all the cruisers were swarmed there in the first place, as it was highly atypical for my hometown. Even if something sketchy was up, he did a very good job of conveying a sense of security, and it wasn't unnoticed or unappreciated. \n\nAnyway, that was my story. It doesn't have nearly the action of most of the other stuff on here, but I tried to make it fun. Thanks for reading :)\n\n",

        "text": "One day, two of my cousins (let's call them Billy and Sam) and I were chilling at Billy's house. We then decided to get some coffee, and since it was late at night, we knew his mom wouldn't let us out, so we made up an excuse to leave the house, which we did.\n\nAfter getting coffee, Billy decided to go meet up with some of his friends, who were chilling near a parking garage. Since we were with him, we also went as well. When we got to the garage, Billy got out of the car to talk to his friends, and came back in the car a while later with something interesting to tell us. He told us that one of the guys who were there were planning on going to the valley, and burning their car. They were going to tell the police that their car had been stolen, and the reason they burned it was to get some insurance money. Though illegal, this seemed pretty exciting for Sam and I, so we decided to go with them. After a few minutes, everyone got in their cars, and made their way to the valley.\n\nOnce we were down in the valley, we noticed some of the cars turning back. We found out that, coincidentally, there were cops in the valley, so they obviously couldn't go through with the plan. We decided to make our way back home.\n\nAs we were approaching the local high school, Billy got a call from one of his friends, that he was in the valley, running from the police, and he told us to pick him up from the school. So, we pulled into the parking lot, and we saw him running out of the valley, and into the car. He told Billy to drop him off home. As we pulled out of the parking lot, we noticed a police cruiser following us. This made Billy nervous, but his friend told him he'd watch out for them, and to keep driving. We later lost the cops, and drove on. As we neared Billy's friend's building, we noticed the police behind us again, and Billy pulled into the building, and stopped to let his friend out. His friend told us that it was the wrong building, but the cops were on our tail, and we didn't have time, so he just got out there. After he got out, Billy drove on to make a turn, and leave the premises. At this point, it's just us three in the car. As Billy made the turn, we see a huge, white SUV stop in front of us, and about 5-7 detectives got out, and with guns in their hands, they yelled, \"Everyone in the car, put your F***ing hands out the window!\"\n\nOur hearts dropped. We did as the cops told us. More cruisers came to the scene. \"Passenger in the back (me),\" said the cop, \"put your hands out all the way!\" My arms were already out so much, that my sides were against the door. They then yelled at Billy, \"driver, slowly takes the keys out of the ignition, and drop them on the ground!\" Billy did exactly that. \"Driver, slowly, open the door, and come out with your hands on your head, and get on your knees,\" said the cops. Billy did as told. The cop said the same thing to Sam, to which Sam complied. Then it was my turn. The cops came to the car door, opened it, and with a gun pointing at me, I had to slowly get out of the car, and get on my knees. Another cop then came, and cuffed me. With my hands behind my back, and me still on my knees, I was told to lay flat on the ground. Seeing as I couldn't use my hands to support me, I was forced to literally drop onto the ground (try it out yourself; it's actually pretty hard to do so without hurting yourself). The cop then picked me up, and walked me towards the cruiser. He then asked me for ID, and my relationship to the other two guys. I told him my wallet was in my pockets, so he got it out. I had turned 18 just that year, which was good news, because otherwise, my parents would have been called, and all hell would've broken loose. After asking us a few questions, like where we were (we said we just came from having coffee. He sat us down on the curb, a few metres away from each other.\n\nAfter a while, Billy's friend, probably feeling bad, came back, and told the officers what had happened. He too was cuffed, and sat on the curb. The police then searched our car, and finding nothing in the car, nor any info about us (criminal history, etc.), we were uncuffed, and told to go home right away. Billy's friend wasn't so lucky, and he was taken to jail.\n\nWe then went back to my house, and acted like we didn't just get cuffed, and chased by cops. We promised each other that we wouldn't tell anyone any of this for at least a few years. So, naturally, we told our cousins the following year during a cottage trip. They were surprised, but kinda laughed it off, since we didn't get into any trouble.\n\nThis is one of our most well-known memories, and it'll probably be with us forever since it was a pretty big deal for us.\n\nTL;DR: Told my aunt that two of my cousins and I were going for coffee. Someone my cousin knew decided to burn his car in the valley for insurance money. Got to the valley, and cops were there. Picked up cousin's friend who was being chased by cops, then later, cops stopped us, and arrested us.",

I feel sorry for those fire ants that I puked on. As the next barrage came up I heard a car pull up behind mine. I managed to straighten myself up and saw that it was a deputy. He had his lights on and came towards me. I had my hands on my hips waiting to see what hole it was going to come out of next.\n\n\"Everything ok?\" He asked me.\n\nI turned my head to reply but when I did the rest of my lunch decided to make its exit stage front. I tilted my head down as he was about 6 feet away and I knew I could reach him if I wasn't careful.\n\nHe took a step back and said \"I guess not. Do you need an ambulance?\"\n\nI shook my head and told him \"I only live 5 more minutes away. I think that's it for what's in my stomach.\"\n\n\"Is there anyone else home?\" He asked.\n\n\"My dad should be. But he's leaving for work in about 15 minutes.\"\n\n\"Let's get you home.\"\n\nHe followed me home and once I got home I thanked him for that. He thanked me for not getting anything on him. For the next few hours I stayed in my bath tub on all fours.",

What's going on?\" She replied, \"I'm not sure. I think I may have gotten a flat tire. It sounded like I hit something a few towns ago, and my car slowly started to lose power until I pulled off here.\" \n\nI went to check it out for her. The tires looked good, so I had her pop the hood. I'm not a mechanic, but I've worked on my own cars, and I've been known to change a tire or wiggle some battery wires to help someone in need.\n\nAs I walked from the front of the car, I could see something sticking out of the front that looked like it didn't belong. I opened the hood, looked down, and discovered the problem. It was one of those moments where I was expecting to see nothing, and suddenly realized how lucky this woman was (or unlucky).\n\nThe object protruding from the front of the car was a piece of steel, about 5 inches thick and 5 feet long, shaped like a large blade. The object in question had hit her car in the front, gone through the radiator, through the *engine block*, and stopped at the firewall.\n\nI closed the hood and did a little 1-second zen moment to chill out. The realization that this woman was very close to being deceased was abundantly clear to myself, but apparently not to her.\n\nI walked back up to her. \"Ma'am, unfortunately it looks like something hit your car, and it's probably not going to be drive-able without some repair. I'll get a tow truck for you.\" She replied, \"Oh really? That's too bad. It's brand new, too, and it's my first new car.\"\n\nThe tow truck arrived and she was on her way, none the wiser.",

        "text": "So I'd just been out of the country for a month, went to work straight back and had been eating OT like it was candy.  Certain things had fallen to the wayside in my free world life.\n\nMainly my stupid inspection/registration sticker.  And the fact that I needed 4 new tires.  This is my excuse and I'm sticking to it.\n\nSo I'm headed back home, I'd joked about not coming in to work tomorrow because one of my tires might blow. A block from my house I see him.  Oh well if he's going to get me he's going to get me.\n\nWelp he gets me.  Nope forgot my license on the bathroom counter, just changed insurance Allright let's try and pull it up on my phone.  Brief thoughts of sending a snap chat but he ended up turning off his lights too soon.  I am obviously ill prepared for this getting pulled over thing.\n\nSo the officer walks up to my window.  \"I pulled you over because your break light isn't working.\"  Fuck, forgot about that...\n\nHonesty is always the best policy... \"shit, again?\"\n\n\"And it looks like your registration is out.\"\n\n\"Yes sir, on the 15th I'm handling up on that.\"\n\n\"Right, license and insurance?\"  And here we go.\n\n\"I don't have my license on me\" mhm that look says he doesn't believe me \"and I literally just changed my insurance last week I'm pulling it up on my phone right now\"\n\n\"But you do have a license?\"\n\n\"Yes sir\"\n\nSo he takes my sisters license, writes my name down and heads back to his car and I finish pulling up my insurance while my sister nags on me about not having my license on me.  Damnit I had cleaned out my car shit, I'm sorry.\n\nComes back.  \"You sure you have a license?  Its not suspended?\"\n\nO.O \"yes sir, I just forgot it because we can't carry anything inside\" I'm still in my uniform.  \"It's sitting on my bathroom cabinet, it's right down the road.\"\n\n\"Because I'm not pulling anything up under your name.\"\n\n\"Uh... I've got one and it should be valid.  I mean I just got pulled over a couple of months ago with it.  Uhm, I've got my state ID\"  and I usually don't show it but at this point I'm like why am I not coming up?  So I show it, and it's also at this point I realize my work ID has had at hard life.  It's broken a lil, bent and my nose is chipping off.  Once again... I'm not prepared for this shit.\n\n\"But you do have an actual drivers license?\"\n\n\"Of course, hey my number is XXXXXX.\"\n\n\"Allright\" and he heads back to my car.\n\nAnd now I'm like fuck, am I going to get arrested.  Jesus I can't afford these tickets... oh shit is my car going to get impounded? WHY'S MY LICENSE NOT PULLING UP.\n\nMy sister continues to nag me.\n\nHe comes back up.  Oh thank god he found me and now has warnings!  Hey warnings yay!  I thought for sure there'd be a ticket for being troublesome.\n\nDrive off, pull into my driveway a block away.  He drives by then zooms off as he sees me hobbling to my house.  And I call my Sgt. because now that I'm not arrested and still have my car I've got this amazing idea to prank my Lt.\n\nAt some point during this ordeal I'd had thoughts of I really shouldn't have fucked with my Lt. about not coming in the next day.\n\nTell the Sgt. what happened she gets a good laugh and agrees to the prank.  She texts him that I've been arrested.  It goes something like this.\n\n\"Hey Xer's sister just called me and said Xer has been pulled over and arrested!\"\n\n\"FUCK!  Is she getting out?  Fuck I've got to call the warden asap.  God damnit.\"\n\n\"Lol nah she just got pulled over she's not arrested\"\n\n\"God damnit I was eating dinner and trying to figure out how I'd come up with bail money for her\"\n\nApparently he threw his fork with his pork roast in it across the kitchen.\n\nThings I learnt.  Just leave my license jn the car, don't forget your break light is out, and my lt thinks it's plausible that I could possibly get arrested.\n\nTLDR; Pulling me over is a pain in the ass, I'm not prepared for anything, fuck it ruin my lts night.",

        "text": "Well, there I was, pulled over. I had caught, then passed a county sheriff’s car on a straight stretch of road. He probably watched me close on him at 20+ mph over the speed limit on a clear day. While I waited for him to approach, every potential excuse seemed inadequate. How does one do that to a well-marked cruiser as if one had not a care in the world? I was puzzled myself.\n\nThe background: My wife and I were on the return leg to Maryland of our two-week, two-wheeled tour of the Mid-West. My Kawasaki Nomad cruiser had performed flawlessly. It could purr all day at 80 and never break a sweat. We usually avoid the super slabs, so the long flat stretches with minimal traffic in the upper Mid-west – Fargo was our turnaround spot (because we both like the movie) – occasionally resulted in a “Woah! I better slow down some” when I noticed the speedometer.\n\nTwo wheels on a scenic, straight, light-traffic road can seduce a mind to relax. The purring engine. A beast that can easily maintain a lane with no hands (Don’t tell the wife). Rare intersections. Nothing will catch me from behind, and I can see for miles ahead. This kind of riding requires minimal, mental resources. The mind can also solve a life mystery or guess how far ahead that distinguishable landmark is or wonder where the vacation days went so fast. \n\nWe had left St. Paul that morning, heading east on a road across the top of Wisconsin, Rte. 28. I remember seeing campers and RVs and SUVs laden with gear that indicated Rte. 28 played a significant role in the tourist industry. We used to camp, my mind remembered. Free from its normal commuting-on-I270-hyper-vigilance, my mind revisited past camping highlights, many of which brought smiles to my face as we ground down the miles toward that big bridge at the top of Michigan.\n\nYou know how irritating it is to get stuck behind some yahoo on a 2-lane when you can’t pass? A yahoo who never looks at the rear view and says, “Hmm, there’s a lot of vehicles following me and none ahead of me. Maybe I’m holding up traffic. Well, even though I will adamantly assert that the posted limit is the TOP speed allowed, I’ll pull over so my followers pass. Then, I'll continue on.” Those drivers were not a problem on Rte. 28 that day.\n\nWe were cruising smoothly, easily over-taking and passing slower vehicles. The road was straight, flat, and had little on-coming traffic. I would casually move into the west bound lane, roll past the turtle, then ease back into the east bound lane, frequently giving a friendly “howdy / thank you” wave. Almost auto-pilot.\n\nUntil I noticed that the latest car that I had easily closed upon and was in the act of passing had some writing on its side. When I arrived at his left rear quarter panel, I could read the writing. It said “[some county] Sheriff’s Department.” My mind snapped into hyper-vigilance, and I let off my throttle. Unfortunately, my inertia rolled me up even with the driver’s window. I surmised that the officer had probably noticed me by this time, and that pulling in behind him was pointless. I throttled up to complete the pass, alerted the just-passed driver with my turn signal that I intended to return to the east bound lane (I didn’t want to surprise him, after all, me being such a courteous and safe driver), returned to the east bound lane, and slowed to what I thought the speed limit might be.\n\nHe lit me up, and I pulled over. I accepted my fate and was simultaneously pondering how much this was going to cost and how the conversation was going to go, preparing how to say that my insurance card and registration were in my saddlebags, and wondering how did I NOT RECOGNIZE A FULLY-MARKED COP CAR!? (In over four decades of driving, I’ve only had one moving violation – and that was in a small neighboring town, driving my wife’s car on a downhill stretch, leaving town, well-beyond all the houses and right before the speed limit returns to rural speed. I didn’t argue that one, because I’ve been lucky (and skilled) so many other times.)\n\nIt took him a while to get out. He had a young deputy in tow, probably in training. They took tactical positions toward my rear on either side of the bike. Short story, he was stern until we proved who we were. Then he lightened up, said that there was not going to be a ticket, and that he stopped us mainly to warn about deer on this stretch of Rte. 28. The previous day, a motorcyclist died after hitting one. We talked bikes, and he said that when he retired next year, he and his wife were taking his Harley down to the Southwest. \n\nHere’s why I think I didn’t recognize a fully-emblazoned patrol car. As I approached from far behind, I interpreted his light-bar to be an empty roof rack, and stereotyped him as another vacationer poking along at normal speeds. My mind then returned to whatever it was enjoying, diverting only the resources needed to conduct a safe pass -- like it had been doing for hours that day. Then I saw the writing on the wall.\n",

I live in a college town and some of the cops here can be real dicks, although I have to say if I had to deal with drunk undergrads every day I might not be so nice either. My friend had the opportunity to interact with a cop here in town that was great. \n\nIt was the middle of winter and in the Midwest that means snowy, icy roads. My friend A is driving home from my house and gets in an accident. It was actually pretty bad and she is really lucky she was not injured. The drivers side of the car hit a pole about five inches behind the drivers seat and folded the car in half. \n\nAnyway, she climbs up out of this snowy ditch with her purse and finds that a local cop had seen the accident and pulled over to make sure she was okay. She climbs into the car and slowly a nose comes pressing forwards from the back seat. She turns around and there is a police dog sitting right behind her sniffing at her. It is at this point that A remembers the big bag of weed in her purse. \n\nI'm not sure what the dog was doing to alert the cop but he looks at her, looks at the dog and then says \"Is there anything you would like to run and put back in your car?\" She hops out and sticks her purse back in her car and then the cop made sure she didn't need to go to the hospital and waited with her until her mom came to pick her up. \n\nIts a small thing but I think it was really decent of the officer she dealt with to not make an already crappy situation worse for her by throwing in a drug charge.

        "text": "“Hey man. You, uh… you busy?”\n\nI’ve worked this job long enough to know that A: Ron didn’t really care to know if I was busy or not, and B: If I wasn’t busy before, I was about to be. \n\n“No, Ron, not at all. What’s up?” I minimized the Word document I had been typing away at and prepared myself for the mental onslaught that was a conversation with Ron. \n\n“So, I think I got an easy one. I got a series of bank robberies. The guy hit, like, a bunch of times. He hit yesterday, as a matter of fact. Anyway, I identified him and got warrants. Like, ten of them. The dude hit a lot of places. And now with the warrants, I want to get him locked up ASAP, because, y’know, he is a serial bank robber and will probably hit again, y’know? This dude is prolific. And, like I said, I’ve got warrants – a bunch of them.” Ron worked a conversation as someone else would sweep a dusty floor. Each sentence overlapped slightly with the previous one to make sure nothing was accidently left behind before he moved on to the next. It was infuriating. I decided proactive measures were necessary in order to insure my sanity. \n\n“So you want me to track him down? No problem! Just send me a copy of the warrant and I’ll get on it. I’d call a bank robber a priority.”\n\n“Great, great. I’ll send them over. I mean; there are a lot of warrants, y’know? Because the dude hit a lot of places. Yesterday, his pro-“\n\n“The more the merrier!” I gritted my teeth and positioned my finger over the “End Call” button on my phone.\n\n“Ok, great, great… Well, I’ll let you go. I’ll send that stuff pronto. Don’t worry about that. It’ll be a large file because there are so many but it will be right on its way. I’ll include the Probation Officer’s information too – the one who can track his ankle bracelet. Thanks!” CLICK!!\n\nI pondered over that last line and why Ron hadn’t thought it necessary to inform me of that information twelve times over earlier on in the conversation. I quickly got over it though, and returned to my report, awaiting the forthcoming email. \n\nA few minutes later my attention was drawn to the Outlook pop-up indicating Ron had followed through with my request. I opened it and read his message – Ron was always much more succinct with the written word: \n    \n    EMR, Thanks for taking this case. Attached are seven warrants for robbery and there are more I can get after we have him in custody and depending on his demeanor during the interview. Also, here is the contact information for the target’s P.O. – Ms. Jones. She can pull up his location at will from her desk but I’d give her a heads up when you plan on tracking him down as she’s pretty busy herself. You can thank me later for this easy softball! – Ron. \n\n\nI saved the attached warrants and had to admit, it did seem like this was going to be an easy one. The rest of my afternoon was taken up with running background on the bad guy and wrapping up reports. Before heading home, I contacted Ms. Jones and told her my plans for finding her charge – Mr. Pratchet – the next day. \n\n“Well, he’s not at his registered address, that’s for sure.” She told me. “He’s been on my naughty list for about three weeks now, not answering calls and clearly hasn’t updated his address. I’ve been thinking about violating him but I’d like to hear his excuse first.” It seemed to take an act of Congress to violate ones probation, and I for one believed it had more to do with all the red tape and bureaucracy involved in getting it done than it did with giving the probation-ee the opportunity to “have a chance to say their piece.” \n\n“Oh, well, could you forward me the address where you think he could be staying?” I had several potential addresses for Pratchet thanks to my research but had already come up with an inkling of doubt as all the utilities seemed to have not been updated in months. \n\n“I’ll forward you a screen shot, but it’s a fairly wide circle – these GPS bracelets aren’t very accurate. It looks like an apartment complex out in Townsburgh, but the radius covers about five buildings.” I stifled the urge to let out an audible moan. Townsburgh was notorious for their small town police politics but big time ego. I didn’t look forward to my courtesy phone call informing them I’d be on their turf and knew I would have to side step the issue of having their Tackleberry-like units assist me. \n\n“Great, thanks for the info. I plan on devoting my whole day tomorrow to tracking Pratchet down. Are you available to run his location for me?”\n\n“Oh sure, after court in the morning. I should be done around eleven barring something crazy. You know how court goes.” I did. We said our goodbyes and I left the office for the night. \n\nThe next morning, I found myself commuting to Towsburgh instead of my normal office. I figured if I had an early start, I might catch my bandit sleeping and be able to tail him while the rest of my team caught up with us to perform the take-down. My phone rang through the car’s Bluetooth system and I answered without seeing who was calling. \n\n“You get him yet?” It was Ron. \n\n“Uh, no.” I looked at the clock to mask sure I wasn’t missing something. “It’s barely seven. I haven’t even made it to where I think he’s living yet.”\n\n“Oh.” Ron sounded disappointed. “I thought maybe you would have worked over night to get him. He’s hit, like, a lot of places. I just want him arrested ASAP, y’know?” \n\n“Yeah. Yeah, I do.” I massaged my nasal bridge for a minute, wondering how to escape the call. “I’m working on it all day today though, promise.”\n\n“Cool, cool. I mean, I’m just worried he’ll hit again, y’know?” \n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“Since he has already hit a ton of times.”\n\n“Yeah. I agree.”\n\nThere was some silence. \n\n“So, anyway… You going to his house?” Ron’s persistence with the unwanted conversation made me want to sob. \n\n“Yeah, I guess. Seems like it will be an apartment in Townsburgh. I’m heading there to see if I can spot him and, if not, to talk to management to see what the deal is. By the way,” I suddenly realized I actually had a use for Ron’s omnipresence via my car's speakers, “Do you know of any cars belonging to him? I couldn’t find anything in DMV or in the other databases.”\n\n“Oh, well, maybe? I mean, he hit a lot of places.” Lord, kill me know. “There were a couple of them though where a tan Kia four door was seen. No tag or anything, but since there were so many places hit and it popped up a few times, maybe he’s driving it?”\n\n“Ok, sounds good. Thanks for the info Ron!” I sped up my words to imply I had to go. \n\n“Oh, ok. You sound busy. I’ll let you know if I find anything else. Call me if you get anything too? Just, because, y’know, I want this guy caught.”\n\n“OK, Bye.” The speakers popped as his presence departed my vehicle. I breathed a sigh of relief and pulled into the parking lot of the apartment complex. I compared my location to the overhead map and realized I’d have no way of surveying the whole thing from a stationary position: the radius covered buildings spanning a courtyard and multiple parking areas. I chose a spot where I could see one of the entrances to a building in the circle and waited for something to catch my attention. \n\nHours passed. Once the clock ticked past eleven, I tried contacting Ms. Jones. Her phone rang through to voicemail though, so I had to come up with an alternate plan. I eventually tried the rental office (“Never seen him.”) and had retreated back to my car when my phone rang once more. Excited it might be the P.O. returning my call, I glanced at the caller ID. Nope: Ron. \n\n“Hey man. No luck yet.” I tried to predictively preempt the conversation. \n\nRon seemed confused by my greeting. “Oh, hey. Yeah – just calling to check in. Y’know, this guy has-“\n\n“Hit a lot of places. I know. And you’re very concerned he’ll hit again today. Well, I can’t’ get through to the P.O. and I’m not psychic, soooo…” I let my last word linger long enough to imply I was out of proactive options. If Ron was going to hound me, at least he could rack his brain for viable investigative leads. \n\nHe sighed into the phone. “Ok. I’d just hate for him to hit again.” I pulled the phone from my ear and weighed the pros and cons of putting my fist through my windshield. \n\n“Well, I’ll call you if I get anything.” I squinted my eyes hard in lieu of causing grievous injury to both my car and hand. \n\n“You check his place of work?” Ron offered. \n\n“His what? No, I couldn’t find anything about where he works. Dude is a ghost on social media, doesn’t have any official state licenses in the database…” \n\n“Oh, yeah. I forgot to tell you. I was so worried about him hitting again, y’know – since he’s hit so many times – that I called his sister. She said he works in computers. Like, repairs and stuff. Could that help?” \n\n“Does she know a company? Because if not, it’s not very helpful.” Why the hell did he even ask me to work the case if he was going to keep meddling in it? I was incensed to say the least. \n\n“No, just computers; thought you may have found something on that.” He sighed again. \n\nI considered telling him off and heading back to my other dozen or so cases waiting me in the office but knew this one was a priority. “Nope! I don’t generally tip off family members that I’m looking for their fugitive brother if I can avoid it!” I thought that would get the message across without going category five on him. He did feed me a decent case, after all. \n\n“Ok, you’re right. Well, call me if you find anything. I’ll call you if he hits again!” He laughed.\n\n“Oh, he’s hit so often I’m really worried about that.” The sarcasm oozed from my throat but I didn’t care.\n\n“Yeah, absolutely. I mean, he hit so many places!” \n\n“I’ll talk to you later!” I hung up. I knew I shouldn’t let it get to me but it was hard being micromanaged via phone. \n\nAlmost immediately after I hung up, the phone rang again. The rage was still hot behind my eyes as I beheld the caller ID, almost hopeful Ron was calling back so I could Hulk out. I calmed quickly once I recognized the number as belonging to the probation office. \n\n“Ms. Jones, hey! How are you”\n\n“Oh, fine. Court was a bit more trying than usual.”\n\n“Yeah, I hear you.” I decided to cut to the chase. “Any news on Mr. Pratchet?” \n\n“Well, he didn’t spend the night at the apartments, that’s for sure.”\n\nI collapsed into me seat. A whole morning wasted. “Dang.” Was all I could come up with. \n\n“But: he’s been mobile all morning. He’s over in Cityville right now, at the intersection of Main and Oak. But, again, I don’t have a good enough ping to say where exactly.”\n\nI pondered my options. “But you think by the historicals that he’ll eventually make his way back here?”\n\n“Judging by the last month of GPS data, I’d bet on it.”\n\n“Ok, great. I’m here now so I guess I’ll just set up camp and see if he shows up. By the way – do you have any information on a job for him?” Probation usually has the best information seeing as employment is sometimes a condition of release. \n\n“No, nothing specific. I think he freelances with computers, under the table stuff. I know he keeps odd hours but not any office or anything. It’s not one of his conditions so I have never really asked other than to fill out the basic paperwork.”\n\n“Bummer, worth a shot though I guess. Thanks for the call and let me know if he moves anywhere with a better signal.”\n\nShe agreed and hung up. Cityville was about an hour drive away at that time of day. Without a clear address, it wasn’t worth it for me to go chasing a wild goose. I called one of my team members and pulled a favor to have him come join me in the lot. “I don’t have a ton to go on, Stan, but I’ll send along a picture and possible car.”\n\nThe waiting and watching continued. When my phone rang some time later, I was hoping it was Ms. Jones with an update. It wasn’t. “Ron! Nothing new on my end. I’ve got Stan en route to help out though so I think we’ll get him eventually.”\n\n“Oh, cool, yeah. Do you think you could break off and go to Cityville? Corner of Main and Oak?” \n\n“Ah. You spoke with Ms. Jones.”\n\n“Yeah, yeah. She said he’s over there. Y’know, there’s a bank there too, right down the street. And he hit a bunch of banks.”\n\n“Did Ms. Jones say she had a specific address?” I was going to try and let him reach the same conclusion I had. \n\n“Well, no, but, y’know, you could just look for him.” \n\n“I,” I had to pause to not bite my tongue off. “I think I’ll stay here. This is where he comes back to every night, this is where I’ll find him.”\n\n“Ok, yeah. You’re the fugitive guy. I’d just hate-” I physically separated myself from my phone to avoid hearing the conclusion to his sentence. \n\n“Ok Ron!” I yelled across the car. “I’ll call with any updates!”\n\nStan arrived a few minutes later and I saw him cruising the lot in the direction I had asked him to get situated in. I told him over the side-band channel that I’d call Ms. Jones for an update once he was set then dialed the phone a minute later. Ms. Jones answered on the second ring. \n\n“I was just about to call you.” She said.\n\n“Oh? Is he moving?”\n\n“Yes, back your way. The problem is his battery is extremely low. It will only be on about ten minutes longer and he’s at least thirty minutes from home.”\n\nBad luck, but at least I had an inkling things were moving in my direction once again. “Ok, that’s cool. Definitely moving fast?” \n\n“Yep! In a car or something. Every ping is a mile or so from the one before it. At least he’s not robbing another bank, right?”\n\n“You’ve been talking to Ron, haven’t you?” \n\n“Yeah, he calls a lot. Seems like a real worrywart.”\n\n“You don’t know the half of it.” I thanked her and hung up before updating Stan over the radio.\n\nAll there was left to do was wait. \n\nHalf an hour after the phone call, a tan Kia pulled up to a building across from me. I yanked my binoculars from the passenger seat and trained them on the driver’s door. Pratchet exited. \n\n“Stan – target just pulled up on my side. Tan Kia with tags Alpha Bravo Charlie six five three. Hold your spot and I’ll let you know when he’s inside so you can reposition over here.”\n\nPratchet stretched his back and looked around the parking lot. I was a good two hundred yards away but the lot was less than half full. I felt as though he lingered on my car for an extra beat before starting his walk up the steps and into the apartment building. \n\n“He’s in. Come on over and set up on the south side. You’ll see the car when you pull by.”\n\nStan crept by and found an inconspicuous spot down the parking lot from our target. I was busy drafting the email asking for assistance but after that was sent, had to deal with the nervous anticipation. I figured I would be able to tolerate Ron if it provided me something to do. He answered just before voicemail picked up.\n\n“Hullo?” He grunted. \n\n“Ron! Your guy just pulled up. We don’t have the numbers to hit his place yet but he’s in there.” \n\n“The robber guy?” I don’t know who else he would have assumed I could have been talking about. \n\n“Yeah, Pratchet. The guy who has hit a ton of times… Pratchet?”\n\n“Oh, yeah, ok. Cool.” \n\nFrankly, I had been expecting more of a reaction. “Well, he’s still inside but hopefully I can get some guys here soon. I’ll call you when we have him in custody?”\n\n“Sure, ok. I’ll call Towsburgh PD and let them know you have him.” \n\n“Ok. Wait – I don’t have him yet. Just saw him. I should have him in a few.”\n\n“Yeah, yeah. Ok. I’ll let them know.” He hung up on me. The whole conversation seemed much more subdued than I was used to. \n\nPratchet came out the front of the building again. He walked slowly to his car and opened the rear door. He leaned in and fiddled with something for a few minutes. Stan made sure I was aware of the movement via radio and we both watched him. He had a better view of the interior but was unable to determine what Pratchet was doing. When he exited the car again, he slung a bag up on his shoulder. He then scanned the parking lot again and I once again felt as though he lingered on my car for an extra moment before he walked back inside. \n\n“You think he made you?” Stan asked on the radio.\n\n“Don’t see how. I’m nowhere near him and my car is off. He’s squirrelly though, that’s for sure.”\n\n“If he exits on foot and walks away, want to take him?” \n\n“I think we’ll have to.” I replied. It was bad tactics but it was the better option when compared with him getting away. \n\nMinutes passed with no movement and without the arrival of more backup. Apparently they all took the same route from the office and hit heavy traffic due to a pile-up on the freeway. \n\nSuddenly the door to Pratchet’s building flung open. He walked out slowly, this time dressed in different clothing and with a ball cap pulled low over his eyes. \n\n“Here’s our boy.” I told Stan. \n\nPratchet walked down the stairs and stood at the base of them for a few minutes while he looked around. I ducked in my seat even though I knew he wouldn’t be able to see me thanks to my distance and window tint. \n\n“Looks like he’s about to run.” Stan theorized.\n\n“Yeah. This could get a little crazy. Be ready.”\n\nPratchet slowly turned and walked in Stan’s direction, still scanning the parking lot as he went. “I’m going to hold for now. Let me know if you need me to reposition for visual if he gets too far.” I told Stan. Damn, where were the other guys. \n\nPratchet perked up and gazed past my car towards the entrance to the complex. A marked Townsburgh PD cruiser pulled in slowly, the cop scanning building numbers as he drove in Pratchet’s direction. “Marked car!” I called out on the radio. \n\nPratchet picked up his pace and hunched his shoulders to avoid being seen. The cruiser pulled in front of me. I decided to make the most of my impromptu backup. I pulled out and rolled down my window. “I need to get that guy!” I pointed down the street at Pratchet and the cop gave me a confused look in reply. “Come on!” I flashed him my badge and gunned it down the road. \n\n“He swung down that alley, can’t see him!” Stan called out. He began pulling out of his space and I noticed the cruiser still parked where I had tried to recruit him. \n\n“You take the alley, I’ll try to cut him off!” I pulled past Stan and threw my car into park. I pulled a vest on and jumped out into the parking lot. The cop had crept a few yards in my direction and I waved him to follow before booking it down behind some buildings. The roar of his Crown Victoria indicated he finally caught on but I was in too big a rush to wait for him to catch up. \n\nThe building I was running behind ended just short of a high privacy fence that spanned the length of the common area opening up to my left. I heard Stan’s voice echoing off the buildings as he screamed, “STOP! POLICE!” I slowed to a trot as I neared the end of the building and just shy of the gap created by the fence. I glanced back over my shoulder and saw the uniformed officer strolling in my direction. I first drew my handgun, but on second thought, holstered it up in favor of my Taser. I had the element of surprise on my side if I had played my cards right. I flipped the switch on the side of the less-than-lethal weapon and indexed back off the building. Stan’s commands to stop echoed around once again. Slowly, I walked backwards with the Taser leveled at what I assumed would be Pratchet’s chest level and I canted my body while edging to the left, “pieing off” the unknown area. The edge of an AC unit came into view, then, a step later, I saw Pratchet: crouched against the wall of the building and paying attention only to the alley from which he had just come from. The same alley Stan was about to come down. I realized I probably made the wrong choice when I opted for the Taser after all. \n\nI crept forward, the laser sight from the Taser bouncing up and down the man’s back, and closed the gap to well within the distance needed for a good deployment. “Move and I swear to God you’re going to regret it.” I’m not sure if I came off Clint Eastwood-esque, or if my voice was quaking like a mid-puberty teen but my order had the desired effect. Pratchet raised his hands and resisted the urge to turn and face me. It seemed like minutes before the uniform caught up to me but once he did, he picked up on my need for him to assist. \n\n“Holy crap, is this the guy?” He asked. \n\n“Yeah.” I said without looking away from Pratchet. “Cuffs would be good.”\n\nThe uniformed officer pulled a pair from his belt and crept forward as I edged to his left, Taser still trained on his torso. He stole a glance at me as I formed my tactical L and the officer grabbed a wrist. \n\n“Shit. Just a Taser?” Was his first reaction, then: “Why are you all arresting me?”\n\n“Why’d you run?” I asked, holstering up my bad choice. It was always better to answer a perp’s question with a question. \n\n“I’m jogging.”\n\nPratchet was transported to Towsburgh headquarters for interview. I needed to figure out how things went to hell so fast. My first guess proved correct: Ron had something to do with it.\n\nThe uniformed cop was very apologetic. “Sorry, man. I was told by dispatch you guys had grabbed him and I needed to transport.”\n\n“Nope. We were still about five guys short of an entry team.”\n\n“Aw, man. That’s why I didn’t know what the hell you were talking about. I wasn’t supposed to be looking for a fugitive, just taxiing one.” I told him it wasn’t his fault and thanked him for the eventual assistance. \n\nIt turns out: Ron called a detective with Townsburgh after my last call to him. It gets a little foggy thereafter with what was said exactly, but the bottom line was that the detective took the conversation to mean he needed to send one of his guys to the vague location where we had been set up to assist a whole task force worth of personnel after apprehending a bank robber. There enters the marked car and ensuing foot pursuit. Stan saw Pratchet head down the alley but had the foresight to hold up before barreling head long around the corner after him. He had stayed just on the other side and heard me give my commands. Pratchet said he never made my car, just felt “something was wrong.” He wouldn’t admit involvement in any criminal enterprise though, so he kept up the whole “jogging” charade, even though it doesn’t really make sense to jog when you feel like “something is wrong.” Oh well, criminals, right? \n\nThe reason he was so hard to track down was he had moved in with some naïve older woman. The two had met two months earlier and had been on a fast-forward romance ending in him moving in. The Kia was hers, as was the lease to the apartment and all the spending money Pratchet could ask for. There was no real explanation for his crime wave save the fact he enjoyed the work. \n\nRon ended up admitting guilt in the miscommunication. When I made it back to the office the next day, I learned the Townsville chief and mayor were none too happy with the “danger we put the officer as well as the community in.” I kindly nudged Ron in the direction of fielding those calls. I hope neither of them ended up punching their fists through their windshields. \n",

        "text": "I posted this on TIFU, and they mentioned to post it here as well!\n\nThis happened last weekend, but I just got around to posting it:\nI am currently a college student majoring in Criminal Justice. In the town that my school sits in, the police department offers college students to fill out a \"Ride-along\" form, and join an officer in their daily patrol shift, 8 hours. There is no limit on how many you can do.\n\nAnyways, this being my 4th time with the department, things were going pretty smooth. 6 hours into the shift, and nothing major has happened; just simple calls.\n\nAt around 9pm, we stop at a local gas station so the officer can use the restroom. He told me he would be right back, and left me with the car running, keys in the ignition. At this point, I didn't realize it. Normally, police officers have a button next to the key slot that they press, which keeps the car running, but they can take their keys with them.\n\nSo because I was thirsty, I unlocked my door, stepped out of the car, and then locked it. Because I didn't want my door to be unlocked while none of us were in the car. That's when the fuck up happened.\n\nI was in line waiting to buy my Redbull, when the officer comes around the corner, telling me we have to go. He just got dispatched for a bar fight happening up the street, which is a code 3 response, lights and sirens. I quickly set my Redbull down, and run out of the gas station with him.\n\nHe gets to his door, and pulls on the handle, and nothing happens.\n\nHe shouts to me, \"Yo, did you lock the car?!\"\n\nI quickly respond with, \"Yeah, you have the keys, right?\"\n\nThen he goes, \"No MAN! They're in the fucking ignition!\"\n\nWith my face in disbelief that I locked him out of his own squad car, he radios in to dispatch, \"Dispatch, negative on that call. I'm locked out of my squad. Can you send an unit to help.\"\n\nIt was an awkward night after that.",

        "text": "I was visiting some relatives in Colorado, and was running late headed to pick up my little brother. Now, I have a bit of a lead foot at the best of times, but in my late teens when this story takes place, it was even more pronounced. I pulled off of one country highway and onto another, and started making my way through the crowd of drivers going much slower than I'd like. All of a sudden, flashing blues in my rear view.\n \nI pulled over, and the officer asked for the usual papers. I asked what I had done wrong, knowing full well I was doing 20 or so above the posted limit, and he indicated it was in fact my speed.\n\n\"Really, I thought I was just following traffic,\" I lied.\n\n\"You were weaving in and out of traffic.\"\n\nSo much for that trick told to me by the cops who frequented the gas station I worked at.\n\nHe went back to his car, and was there for a really long time. Never a good thing, but I didn't see a second unit pull up, so I was fairly confident I would escape this with just a ticket. Maybe 20 minutes later, so much for making up time via judicious use of the gas pedal, he came back up.\n\n\"What is your name?\" he asked.\n\n\"/u/thefoolofemmaus.\"\n\n\"Has that always been your name?\"\n\n\"To the best of my knowledge,\" I said.\n\n\"That's not the name that comes up when I run this license. The name that comes up is… hang on.\" He leaned into his shoulder mic and asked for the name.\n\n\"[Horrible mispronunciation of my mother's name],\" came the response. She does have a very oddly spelled name.\n\n\"Yeah, that's my mom,\" I confirmed.\n\n\"OK, when you get back to Missouri, you need to get that fixed,\" He started. It was then I noticed he didn't have a clipboard, so I wasn't going to be written a ticket, so there was no way I was ever going to try and get this corrected.\n\n\"Will do,\" I lied.\n\n\"Next, you need to get rid of that beer.\"\n\nThis confused me, because at the time I didn't drink at all.\n\n\"You mean my can of Arizona Iced Tea?\" I asked indicating the brand on the can that in his defense, did look a lot like a tallboy.\n\n\"Sorry about that,\" he offered. \"Lastly, what are those?\"\n\nI once again felt my blood go cold, because he had pointed to the nunchaku I kept near the gearshift. You see, I live in the free state of Missouri where you can carry whatever blunt force weapon you like in your car, but in Colorado unless you are headed to or from a martial arts class, they are forbidden. I thought quickly, and summoned my extensive experience lying to authority figures.\n\n\"What, my keychain?\" I asked.\n\n\"Your keychain?\"\n\n\"Yeah, after the fourth or fifth time I lost my keys, I got the biggest keychain I could find. Damn thing slaps my leg when I am driving, so I take it off, but as soon as I get out of the car I hook it back onto this carabineer.\"\n\nHe thought for a second. I've always suspected he was recalling his previous accusation about the iced tea, and didn't want to run into some big reveal about how it wasn't what it seemed.\n\n\"That's a martial arts weapon,\" He said finally.\n\n\"I wouldn't know anything about that,\" I said thankful I didn't have any insignia from the dojo I taught at anywhere on me.\n\nHe had me put them in my trunk, shook my hand, and pulled away. Looking back, I realize that he let me off either out of pity or an extreme aversion to the paperwork this would have caused, but at the time it felt like an amazing victory.\n",

        "text": "This happened one of my first nights working graveyard shift, on a Saturday night. We received a call of a driver, possibly drunk, driving at 30mph on the freeway and weaving in and out of his lane.\n\nAnother unit from out of the area was already on scene, and when my partner and I arrived on scene they gave us a run-down of the situation. \n\n\"We balanced him out, and he's not drunk. When we found him he was doing about 30 in the slow lane, but he pulled over when we lit him up. He's saying he wants to drive away, but we took his keys and his license. If you want to call roadside assistance and say he broke down, that's no problem by me. Whatever you need to do. You guys can do the re-eval.\"\n\nThe other officer was hinting that the only way to get this guy home safely was to tow his vehicle home. Roadside assistance doesn't show up unless you're broken down. A re-eval is an immediate revocation of a person's drivers license based on an officer's observation that the person is unsafe to drive, and needs to take a driver's test again.\n\nMy partner, Johnson, went up and contacted the driver while I stayed back and provided cover. Johnson walked back to me after a brief conversation. \"It's just some old guy. He says he's fine, he's just going to drive the 40 miles home, and he's getting mad that we took his license and his keys. He has a son but doesn't want to give me his phone number.\" Johnson wanted to call the son so we could have him pick up his dad.\n\nI started doing some detective-level work by opening up the Yellow Pages app and trying to find a number for his son. I went over the air to dispatch to try and do the same. Johnson re-approached the driver. A minute later he came back with a number in hand, which matched the one I was able to find.\n\nJohnson called the son while I watched the driver. Johnson was able to get ahold of the son, \"Hey, we're with your dad, on the side of the freeway...and you need to come pick him up.\" That was when the driver decided to get out of his car.\n\nAbout 3am, on the side of a freeway with traffic occasionally buzzing us at 80mph, with an elderly male who didn't seem to know exactly what was going on.\n\nMy first reaction, \"Sir! Please get back in your car.\" He stopped with the door open, halfway into the slow lane. \"Sir, please return to your car for me.\" He started walking towards me as I started walking towards him. My concern was him unwittingly walking into a lane of traffic, or us getting taken out by one of my city's numerous drunks.\n\nHe was upset, and wasn't exactly sure what was going on, and kept complaining about not getting a ticket, or maybe getting a ticket, and he wanted to leave. I explained it wasn't safe for him to drive, and his son was on the way to pick him up, and he needed to wait in his car. He wasn't happy, but did as I asked.\n\nJohnson finished the phone call, and we returned to our car to wait for the son to show up.\n\nTen minutes passed, and we saw the map light in the car turn on while the driver fidgeted around. He then turned the light off. A few seconds later he got out of the car again, and my partner and I ran out to keep him out of traffic. We had another discussion about staying in the car, his son was on the way, and we all returned to our vehicles. Over the course of the next hour this happened again and again, like clockwork, almost every ten minutes. He'd get out, we'd get out, we'd say get in your car, he'd say let me leave, and then we'd all get back in our cars to wait. \n\nAbout halfway through this fiasco, the driver did his usual routine of getting out, arguing with us...but this time he declared, \"I have to go pee pee.\" Johnson replied, \"....what?\" The driver said again, \"I have to go pee pee!\" Johnson told him, \"Just...hold it.\" The driver wasn't having any of it. He walked to the front right of his car and said, \"Here, right here is good.\" My partner started to object with some enthusiasm, while I was holding back laughter. \"Sir, SIR, no, sir, do not go pee right there.\" \n\nThe driver unzipped his pants and proceeded to go...pee pee. Johnson looked back at me and whispered, \"Is this happening right now? Is this some sort of prank?\" The driver finished and returned to his car without another complaint.\n\nA few minutes later the son showed up with a friend, and we released the car and the dad to him.\n\nJohnson and I both returned to our car. He muttered to me, \"We're never telling anyone about this.\"",

        "text": "“SmugBuster! You’re driving.” My Sergeant caught me off guard as I was gazing around the station wondering why the number of cops on shift had more than doubled from our usual Friday night of 3 cars with 2 officers each to 5 cars with 3.\n\n“Huh? Sorry Sarge?” \n\n“I said you’re driving. Get your gear and meet me at the car.” He turned his back to me, picked up his duty bag and started walking to the back door. He had about 15 years on the job and was a great cop but recent events had left him a bit salty.\n\n“Oh, sure thing Sarge!” I was trying to hide my excitement but probably failing miserably. I had been on the job about 8 months and had just been certified to drive code red. This was my first shift driving with my new qualification and I was itching to show the world how good I was behind the wheel.\n\nI met up with him at the car and completed the vehicle check before getting in the driver’s seat. I set about adjusting the mirrors and seat when the he piped up.\n\n“Two things. One, in the car you call me Jerry. Second, don’t bloody crash or you’ll be in the Rodeo’s for the rest of your life.” An avid Holden fan Jerry was one of the few supervisors that looked after the relatively new but overdue for a service Commodore.\n\n“I wouldn’t dream of it Sarge, I’d never hear the end of it.” I was just happy to be in a sedan rather than a caged truck for once.\n\n“Hey Jerry. Why are there so many of us on tonight?”\n\n“It’s the start of summer. Alcohol plus heat equals a shit fight for us.”\n\nSure enough as the night progressed urgent job after job came over the radio. My first five or so red runs went without a hitch and Jerry had started to trust my driving ability. \n\nAbout 10pm we were at Jerry’s favourite pie shop standing out the front by the car, hot engine still ticking furiously from the punishment I had already put it through during the first part of the shift. \n\nAbout halfway through my pie a double beeper came over the radio. An assault in progress on the other side of the command, usually a ten minute drive under lights and siren.\n\n“Sydney 14 red in five” Jerry answered the call.\n\n“Five? You reckon?” I looked at him with an eyebrow raised.\n\n“What? You don’t think you can do it?” He cracked a smile.\n\n“I can bloody do it but I don’t think the car can.”\n\nJerry started laughing as we got in. “Sure, it’ll be the cars fault then.”\n\nI hit the alert button activating the lights and siren, chucked a u-turn over 4 lanes and gunned it bringing the V6 back to life.\n\nThe main road was the most direct route to the job but heavy traffic was still causing an issue. Jerry was navigating and decided we should take a back way. Less traffic but a lot more corners. \n\nAbout four minutes into the drive I noticed something with the car. “The brakes are feeling a bit soft Jerry, I reckon I’ll take it a bit easy the rest of the way.” \n\n“Bullshit. They do that sometimes, it’s normal, not a problem.” Jerry usually drove this car so I took his word for it.\n\nI pushed on driving hard, engine screaming at me to stop, brakes squealing in protest at every corner.\n\nWe were approaching a corner I’ve taken hundreds of times before. A decent right hand turn down a light slope. There was a corner similar to this at driver training and I cruised through that one with ease. I approached the corner at about 120km/h but knew I had to get down to around 70 to get around safely. I hit the brakes and heard them squeal but nothing else happened. \n\n“What the fuck are you doing?!” I hear from the passenger seat.\n\n“Brakes are out!” I pushed my brake foot to the floor and managed to get to about 100km/h. I wrestled the steering wheel to right lock but the tyres couldn’t get a grip on the road. We were understeering heading straight for the safety barrier.\n\nBANG!! Both airbags exploded and scared the crap out of me. It felt like I had been punched in the face by a brick wall. There was powder everywhere, my duty bag had made its way from the back seat to the front, and I could smell burning.  \n\nWe bounced off the safety barrier and skidded sideways across the lane and hit a concrete refuge island where we came to rest.\n\n“Shit! Are you okay Jerry.” I managed to mumble trying to regain my senses.\n\n“Fuck that hurt… yeah I’m good.” \n\nWithin 30 seconds another car crew responding to the same job came across us. They said they didn’t see the crash but heard the brake squeal and smash over their siren.\n\n“What’s that burning smell? Tony is the car on fire?” I was still in a daze.\n\n“Nah mate. It’s just the airbags.” Tony was no stranger to crashed police vehicles having crashed three in the relatively short time I had been there.\n\n“What did I tell you at the start of the shift SmugBuster? What did I bloody say? I said DON’T. CRASH. THE. CAR.” My investigative training told me Jerry wasn’t pleased.\n\n“Yeah… sorry Sarge.”\n\nWe got out of the car and surveyed the damage. Brakes were glowing orange, their way of saying “I told you so.” The car was a write off. Heavy front end damage with scrapes and dents up the left side of the car. \n\nWe both got taken to hospital for a check over and were both released that night with minimal injuries.\n\nIt was ruled as a vehicle fault accident but that didn’t matter to Jerry. True to his word whenever he was my shift supervisor he made sure I was working the caged trucks until he transferred about a year later. I don’t think he ever forgave me because the car that replaced his beloved Commodore was a Ford.\n",

It was drilled into our heads at school that police officers would ALWAYS be working in pairs, and if you are approached by a single officer, yell for help.\n\nWell, around the time I started driving, my family moved to just outside of Vancouver, where the police work alone. The first time I was ever pulled over, I could see that the RCMP officer behind me was by himself. I did not have a cell phone, so I kept on driving, legally, but with the officer having lights and sirens going behind me. I'm not sure how long I kept going, it seemed like forever at the time, but was probably less than 5 minutes.\n\nI drove to the police station. Left my car on the street running, and ran inside, telling the officer at the front desk there was a fake cop following me. Well...the 'fake' cop walked in after me...I don't remember what he said, but in the end I explained what had happened and we all had a good laugh.",

        "text": "I arrived to check-on at 0630.  Being a reserve, I'm obviously  not required to go to check on, but I was there anyway so I joined in.   \nAmong mutterings of \"who the hell is that guy?\" and \"what a poor, poor dedicated soul,\" I sat there while the shift supervisors listed road closures, upcoming events, etc.  Then the shift lieutenant had an announcement.    \n  \n\"Everybody congratulate John, who made it to detective.  He has two days left.\"  John was a intense, but good, deputy to have.  I rode along with him a couple times and enjoyed every time.  Unlike some of the other guys, he actually let me get on the radio and come in contact with people.  This day, though, I'd be riding along with one of his shift partners (we'll call him Chris).  \n  \nIt was call after call, interspersed with some pull-over's and traffic accidents.  A few hours before the end of shift, we overhear John ask for K9 on the radio during his traffic stop.  Chris and I realize we are right down the street, so we show up as back-up.  \n  \nJohn had evidently pulled over a rental vehicle for running a stopped school bus.  As soon as I stepped out of the car, I realized why he wanted to call the K9 over.  You could smell the \"green leafy substance\" from 100 feet away.   \n  \nIn my state, smell is usually enough for a search, but we wanted to make sure we had enough probable cause.  John took his time writing the ticket.  Luckily, the K9 showed up as he's slowly explaining how to take the ticket to court.  \n  \nJohn had her step out of the car.  She had to be at least seven feet tall.  Chris and I look at each other in shock.  I think both of us were hoping she wouldn't fight.  \n  \nThe K9 does its thing and gets a positive hit on the vehicle.  The excited dog got his toy as a reward, and trotted around us and even looked at the suspect with excitement like \"I DID A THING! BE PROUD!\"  John handcuffs and Mirandizes her while Chris and I get our search gloves on.   \n  \nThe rental car was jam packed with stuff, including a stereo system and 5 or 6 roller-board suitcases.  Oh yeah, and a felony amount of marijuana and narcotics.  Our 7 foot tall Amazonian was officially arrested.   \n  \nNow came the chore of what to do with the rental car.  John took the suitcases and some other stuff while we put the speakers and stereo in our cage.  It took a full half hour to empty and inventory the contents of the vehicle.  We also got a good chuckle when we saw the rental company's sticker reminding the customer of the \"$200 smoking fee.\"   \n  \nThe tow truck got the rental and we left to drop off the stereo at the office.  That's when the call volume started up again.  \n\n*thunkTHUNK thunkTHUNK* The speakers in the back seat was starting to drive Chris crazy.  They'd bang at every stop and every acceleration.  Chris kept swearing.  I kept laughing.  Finally, he pulls over and I buckle the speakers in.  We did eventually make it to the office.     \n  \nJohn had to stay 2 hours after shift to inventory the suitcases and draft the probable cause paperwork.  After he was finally done, he called Chris.   \n\"You won't believe what was in all these suitcases.\"  John sounded annoyed at best.  \"Dildos and chains.  All dildos and chains.\"   \n  \nWe theorized that this was God's last prank on John before he joined up with the big boys.  ",

        "text": "*State Trooper. All radio traffic translated into normal English.*\n\nI was working day shift on a major freeway when I got a call of a disabled motorist needing help. These come in 10 times a day, and it's usually people with a flat tire or out of gas.\n\nDispatch puts it out, \"Unit 5, we've got a call of an elderly male on a scooter on the side of the freeway.\" I copy, \"Show me en route.\"\n\nI start heading that way. Traffic was heavy but flowing pretty well, around 65mph, and I'm getting closer to where the call was put out. Dispatch updated me while I was on my way, \"Unit 5, we're getting a couple more calls on this, putting him in the same area.\" I acknowledge it and move to the slow lane. This part of the freeway didn't have a breakdown/emergency lane, so it's not a good place to be stuck.\n\nI always try to imagine the scenario before I get to it so I have a plan in place. I was imagining a man in his 70's standing next to his scooter, likely out of gas. Scooters usually don't have fuel gauges anyway. I was about half a mile away from where the call came out and getting ready to slow down.\n\nSuddenly, the car in front of me swerved to the left. I waited a second to see if it was a text-message swerve or a \"dodge an obstacle\" swerve. I quickly see it was the latter. \"Oh, shit!\" I immediately saw an elderly male, not on a scooter, but on a power wheel-chair, driving the wrong way in the slow lane, against traffic that was going 65mph. I slammed on my brakes, hit my lights, and put out some radio traffic, \"Dispatch, I'm on scene, and he appears to be travelling the wrong way on a, uh..wheel chair. I'll advise further.\"\n\nI got out of my car and contacted the gentleman. \"Good morning, sir. What in the world are you doing?\" He informed me, \"I'm heading to the other exit that way.\" He pointed to where I came from. I replied, \"No, you're not. Turn around and go back to the other exit. I'm going to follow you off with my lights on.\"\n\nSo I chilled in my patrol car, cruising at a solid 5mph behind this gentleman, being what amounts to a human shield as cars whizzed by us at freeway speeds. While in my car, I had some time to comment on the insanity of the situation into my car's dashcam. I'm uncomfortably aware of the fact that the most likely thing to kill me is a traffic collision.\n\nWe reached the off ramp and I got out to talk to him again. His story was that he's homeless, and normally hangs out at the nearby gas station, but a couple guys were picking on him. In order to get away, he thought the freeway was the best route. I let him know that if people were harassing him, he could always call the police the help him out. He wouldn't give up the identity of the people messing with him, and by his demeanor it seemed he didn't want me to push the issue.\n\nI asked him where he'd be headed next. \"There's another spot I usually hang out at down the road so I'll head over there. And I won't take the freeway this time.\"\n\nI stopped on the off-ramp for a minute to process what had just happened, and an unmarked Secret Service Agent pulled alongside me. \"Hey, did you get that call about the guy in the wheel chair from us?\" I let him know, \"Not specifically from you, but we got a few calls on it.\" He replied, \"I saw him as I was heading south and had to do a double-take. I could not believe what I was seeing. Glad you got him off.\" The agent drove off.\n\n\"Dispatch, the gentleman in the wheel chair was verballed off the freeway and advised not to go back on. I'm available for the next call.\"\n\n",

        "text": "....It was almost the end of watch, 2125hrs Oct. 16, 2012; I (926/FTO) had just taken a report on station and had just sat down at my desk to 'FIB', fill-in-blanks, before I could go home. My partner, Kelly (927/K-9) had just walked in followed by our shift super, Scott (919/SGT/K-9/SRT), it was normal for our crew to cram a days worth of reports into ten minutes and listen to some music. Funny, now that I think about it, as we sat at our desks, we each had to pick a song and had to listen to the whole song, even if we hated it, one of those 'things you do'. We'd been together for 8 years, so, we're family then co-workers, rookies take note.\n\n    At 2130, our radios came to life, 'dispatch, crews, report of a shooting, [address] multiple victims, will advise further', at the mention of 'shooting', we headed for the door. Keys in hand. No words were spoken. Focus is totally on radio traffic.\n\n     27, 26 and 19, in that order left HQ. Overhead lights, on. Siren, on. I could hear, in the background, surrounding agencies telling their dispatchers 'clear the air for Lakes traffic'. 19 ordered 'clear the air', it goes without saying, but, you still have to.\n\n    We had to head east, first, then north. We were advised we had 'multiple victims, an active shooter, possible home invasion and small children'.\n\nAfter years of working together, you anticipate, not assume, what your partners next move will be. I anticipated 19 would have attempted to contact our chief, 900, in order to activate SRT. I was asking dispatch for vehicle, clothing, suspect(s) and weapon descriptions. 27 was leading us. \n\nWhen we were about a half mile away, overheads, off. Siren, off. The bad guy(s) knew we had to be coming, no sense announcing our arrival. Our address was a multi family housing area, one way in or out. On our left, the apartment complex, two story buildings. Further on, the town homes. We were going to the town homes.\n\nThe town homes consisted of several buildings. Each building had five, two story, units. As we turned into the first, of two entrances, for the town homes, our headlights lit on a man, standing between the first and second units, in the shadows. In front of each unit, the parking lot, each unit was allotted two spaces. We parked, lights and engines off. Weapons drawn. \n\n The man was bleeding from the head and chest. He advised us that some guy knocked on his door, when he opened the door the guy opened fire. I told 27 to stay with him and to have an ambulance come and get this guy to the hospital. \n\nMy assigned cruiser was in the body shop, that's another long story, so, my shotgun/rifle was in the arms room at HQ. I had my duty weapon, a Sig Sauer 226 .40 and a flashlight. 19, fortunately, had his duty weapon and his rifle, plus, he's the Captain of SRT.\n\nAs we were passing the second unit, on our immediate right. Some residents were standing on their porch wondering 'what's going on'.\n\n\"Please, get back inside\", us.\n\n\"But, I thou......\"\n\n\"Get the fuck back inside and lock the doors.\"\n\nOk.\n\nDispatch advised that the possible shooter was wearing a blue hoodie, jeans. Possibly driving a blue or green van. \n\nAs we passed the second building, the sidewalk curved to the right and passed building three. The fifth unit, screen door opened. A man wearing a blue hoodie (hoodie up), jeans, walked from the last unit and to a waiting blue or green, Ford F-150 extended cab. In vapor lights, it is difficult to determine vehicle color. But, a van or truck?\n\n     The drivers door was open. Engine running. Headlights, on, pointed towards the opened residence door. Cab light, on. The man we saw was technically blind. We stopped in between the second and third town home and stepped off the sidewalk.\n\nVeterans know this, rookies, listen up. We saw the man standing, facing into the cab, face blocked by the hoodie. But, his shoulders were moving. What does that mean, well, said bad guy, might be changing the diaper of an infant. Making a sandwich. Writing a letter. Reading the bible. Point is, he's probably not up to any good, but, just because you're on a traffic stop with one or five people in the car, if their heads are not moving, that doesn't mean they're NOT doing nothing. Watch their shoulders. You know they're waiting and watching for you. If their shoulders are dipping and moving as well, you may have an entirely new threat.\n\nWe shined our flashlights on the man and verbally ordered him to show his hands. He immediately looked up. He stopped doing whatever he was doing. Then, put his head down again and continued doing whatever he was doing. As we continued to verbally order the guy to cease what he was doing, he would frequently look up to possibly see if we were advancing. Since, we had no idea what he was doing, we weren't going to walk up to him.\n\nAfter what seemed like minutes, but, was seconds, the man stops all movement and appeared to 'deflate'. Head down, shoulders not moving. Nothing. \n\nThen, in a moment, he 'reinflates'. Takes a deep breath. Brings his left hand up. A black handgun. He yells, something. Just screams. His hand and arm clear the extended cab. Muzzle flash. I still see it when I close my eyes. \n\nI, think, I returned fire. I saw my hand jump. Remember bringing my sights back down to find the guy, my hand jumps again. His muzzle looks to be the size of a train tunnel. He is moving from our right to left. I am suddenly skidding across the parking lot. Not sure how I got there. \n\nI can hear a very distinct 'thwack'. I think I hear rounds hitting the car behind me. 'Thwack'. The parking lot ends. A curb. About five yards of grass. Then pond.\n\n He is sliding, face first, on the grass. He didn't clear the curb? It's three inches high. He stops sliding. His head comes up off the grass. Finds my flashlight. His left hand, still, holding the handgun, comes up from the grass.\n\n19 had shot him in the right knee and chest. That explained why he fell.\n\nI yelled, 'gun, gun, gun'. My hand jumps, twice. The face, shrouded by the blue hoodie, jerks back, twice, and falls down. His left hand drops. No movement. Nothing.\n\nI say aloud, to 19, 'I think I just shot that fucker'.\n\n'Me too', he says back.\n\n19 got him in the shoulder. \n\nHe had two .40 caliber wounds. One between his eyes. One below his right eye.\n\nThe ME described the shot between his eyes as the 'money shot'.\n\n'Reloading'. I drop the magazine from my weapon. Ejected a live round from the chamber. I thought my ammunition was faulty. Bad. Removed a fresh mag from my duty belt, tapped it against my thigh. Hard. And slide it into my handgun. I rack a live round into the chamber. I am still sitting on the ground. My legs are stretched out before me, facing the immobile body. Thirty-five feet away.\n\nI discover later it is a common occurrence during a fire fight for person to not hear his weapon being discharged. Your mind tells your body what senses you need for survival. Mostly, sight. Also, I thought I was invisible, sitting in the middle of the parking lot. No cover. When BCI came to interview me, they couldn't find any vehicles that'd been struck by bullets. What I heard were the rounds passing close to my head.\n\nI stand up. Weapon trained on the non-moving body. 19 and I approach the body, dividing our attention between the body and the opened door where the man had exited. I could hear the sounds of someone yelling or moaning. It is very, very bright out for some reason. \n\n27 comes from behind us, out of the dark, between building two and three. I remember her asking if we were ok. Yes. The man she'd been watching was a 'load and go'.\n\n737, an officer from a neighboring agency, followed behind 27. He had his rifle up and ready. 19 asked 37 to standby the body. \n\nWe still had to clear the pickup truck and the town home, on the end. We approached the truck. A box of ammunition was opened on the drivers seat. Rounds were all over the seat. The floor. Beer cans, still sweating, passenger side. A black handgun case. Floor. \n\nClear.\n\n19 and I make our way to the door. A man can be heard yelling for help. The front door had been knocked to the floor, hinges broken. Door frame shattered. The man is lying face down, arms in front of him. Lots of blood. To the left is a stairway. To the right, a livingroom. 19 covers the stairway. \n\nI tell the man on the floor help is coming. I jump over him and continue right, an open dining room. On the floor I see the body of a small child. I pass. I have to clear the kitchen. Blood everywhere. The sliding glass door is open. I close and lock the door. Blood on the drawn blinds. I tell 19 I have a child, gunshot wounds to the head.\n\nThe three year-old boy is lying on his right side. On the left side of his head, above the ear, are two symmetrically round holes. The skin had been blown away. The white of the bone was whiter than anything I had ever seen. These shots were close. Very close. I see another wound in the arm, a defensive wound. 27 joins my side. I try to tell dispatch to send Life Flight. Send everyone. Anyone. She rolls the child towards his back, blood starts pumping out of the head wounds. A bright, bright red. She is a trained EMT. 19 says we need to get upstairs, fast.\n\n    I jump across Mark, the man on the floor and touch 19's shoulder, we proceed up. Directly across the hall, a bathroom. I clear it. Closet. Cleared. First bedroom on the right, a five year-old girl. Scrunched into a corner. Television on. She is very afraid. I check under her bed and in her closest. Clear. I hold a finger to my lips, universal sign, be quiet. She nods her head yes. I clear the next bedroom. Under the bed. Closet. Clear. Last bedroom on the left, a little boy and his dog are on the bed, watching cartoons.\n\n     Part of me wonders if the children are dead and I'm making them 'live' because I don't want to see anymore dead or dying children. They're alive. I bring the girl into the bedroom with the boy and dog. I'm kneeling on the floor, handgun out of their view, but, in my hand. 27 and I explain some man was mad and shot off some fireworks. 19 gave us the all clear to bring the children down to the Suburban parked in front. We cover their heads with blankets from the beds.\n\n     When I exit, I am shocked. I see more police cruisers and fire trucks. Everywhere. SRT guys moving in formation, clearing the grounds. We put the kids in the waiting Suburban. And breathe. 37 is still standing over the dead body. He is a large guy, people don't talk to him. I see a line of medics and fire fighters extending from the neighbors front door and down the sidewalk.\n\nDispatch, '19, lady in the next apartment, refusing to leave until she is able to see he grandchildren'. 'Clear'.\n\n19 takes the girl. I carry the boy. We have to walk the gauntlet of medics. Some are crying. They reach out to touch us as we pass. Inside, crazy motion. Everyone trying to blend into the wall. As we set the children down, people give us hugs and just stare at us. Weird. We leave but are accosted outside, again.\n\nEveryone is 'thanking us'. People are openly crying. The BCI agent arrives and gets a front row pass up to the circus. She gives us a great big hug, as we are all friends. She takes our weapons. Checks our uniforms. My radio was 'broke'. Shot. Held together by the metal clip. GRT, gunshot residue test. Several people came and asked how many rounds I had. I didn't know.\n\n900 shows up, first gives us hugs. I let those two talk, alone. Deputies from as far as Michigan, Lucas, Wood, Ottawa, Hancock county deputies, state troopers from, everywhere. Detectives. SRT squad members, guarding doorways. People I've never met come to shake my hand. Firefighters, from, well, far away.\n\nI can't lift my left leg. For some reason, it's, very sore. My radio, held together by the metal clip. Shot. Knocked me down. I have to be carried to an ambulance. My uniform pants leg cut away. A large purple contusion in the outline of my radio.\n\nAs we are leaving, with our trooper escort, I see the scope of emergency vehicles. I am almost in tears. And can't talk. \n\nOnce at St Charles, there is twenty people standing there, waiting. For me. They wheel me in. The attending doc is a former Pittsburgh officer, anything you want, ask. \n\nA couple percosets? \n\nYou got it.\n\n     Fifteen minutes later, not feeling any pain. The number of people in my little room is a record. 'What happened?' 'Tell us, please. About the child.' \n\n'Where is the boy?', I ask.\n\n'He was transferred to St. V.'\n\nJorge III fights for his life for 45 minutes. He was a strong little boy.\n\nBCI investigators come read me my rights, they needed to interview me.\n\nAt the hospital, I am informed that the boy, three year-old, Jorge III, was the son of the shooter. A person came forward, while all the officers were searching the area, and tells them, that the boy's mother, Amber, lives in the apartment complex. 200 yards away.\n\nWhen they get no response at her door, SRT breaches. Amber is found, shot to death. Lying on the kitchen floor. Shot five times.\n\nAccording to a 'concerned neighbor', she heard what sounded like 'gun shots and screaming', but, dismissed it because she'd repeatedly called the police and didn't want to bother. After checking previous records, the 'concerned neighbor' called to report 'loud sex' coming from that apartment. \n\nBut, gun shots and screaming? Can't be bothered? \n\nWhat was pieced together, later, Amber had recently broken up with Jorge II, the father of their three year-old son. After failed attempts to reconcile, Amber moves on. She has recently started 'talking' to, Steve, the man who had stopped us as we were pulling into the parking lot. \n\nJorge II texts Amber to say he wants to come over and discuss Halloween times. He then goes to Bass Pro and, legally, purchases a brand new Ruger Buck Mark .22 and about 500 rounds of ammunition. Drives across the street and purchases some beer. Then drives to Ambers.\n\nHe shoots Amber, again five times. He then takes their son, Jorge III, to Steves.\n\nSteve had just sat down and was eating a salad in the livingroom, when someone knocked on the door. When he opened the door, he is shot. Steve, who is living there with his mother, Janet, her boyfriend, Mark, and Steves two children. Steve does all he can to try and hold the door closed. \n\nJorge, unable to open the door, goes to the front window and starts shooting through the window, striking Janet and Mark. Steve, panicking, runs out the rear sliding glass door. Jorge gains entry, after Mark is struck and falls down. Steve loses his left eye. Jorge makes statements that since 'Steve took his family away' he's going to take 'Steves family'. He then shoots and kills his own son. Janet, shot in the arm and back, also escapes out the back, runs 15 feet to the neighbors and takes shelter. She uses the neighbors phone to call 9-1-1.\n\nIt is thought that Jorge would have killed whoever was left in the residence had he not encountered us in the parking lot. He had obviously been reloading magazines for his new handgun when we ordered him to show his hands. But, again, you never know.\n\nSeveral people who came forward and 'saw everything', claimed 19 and I shot the little boy and somehow dragged him into the residence. They recanted everything when confronted with forensic evidence and Janet's statement. She saw Jorge kill his son.\n\nI am not sorry for shooting Jorge, he was shooting at me. I am still in counseling, every two weeks I visit my therapist. Telling this story is known as 'immersion therapy', reliving the traumatic event helps a person control what happened.\n\nHad there not been 200 hundred people standing outside the residence, I probably would've walked over to Jorge and shot him again. Steve, Janet, Mark and the two children, survived. \n\nAmber and Jorge III were buried together. I've visited their grave several times. I feel bad for her, if the media seeking neighbor, hadn't agreed to be interviewed and told the world she heard the gunshots and 'a woman screaming for help', but, didn't 'want to get involved', maybe it would've ended differently.\n\nI am discharged from the hospital at 0545hrs. A huge bruise on my left hip. A .22 round, fired from twenty to thirty feet, has enough foot pounds of force to knock a 6'5\", 230lb man to the ground. A three year-old boy, with still developing bone structure, didn't stand a chance. I don't complain, though. \n\nWe are ordered to be back at HQ for a mandatory crisis counseling session. I am still wired. I enter through the back entrance and am talking with 19 &amp; 27, when we are told to go next door. When we enter there is probably 100 people, fire fighters, medics, doctors, law enforcement. The room goes silent. The three of us sit, backs against the wall. The counseling consisted of us being told we are eligible for counseling. What.\n\nSome of the medics are still crying. Everyone is looking, openly, at us. As we are dismissed, everyone has to shake our hand. We don't feel like heroes.\n\nI worked through another holiday season of suicides. Then, on January 13th, I walked out and never looked back. I went to Texas and Florida. Bought a Harley. \n\nI feel bad for my brothers and sisters still fighting the fight in a fucked up world. For those who blame the police for their own troubles, fuck off. If you've never had to fire a gun for survival, do not tell a person what he or she should've done differently. \n\nI've listened to other officers describe how they've worked so many years without firing their weapon. I wish I could say the same.\n",

        "text": "So, during my time as an FTO, I had the pleasure of showing a new hire/trainee how to complete the paperwork for a Code-18 (deceased person) instead of just explaining it, while we sat around on station. The department I worked for was an A-Z, meaning we conducted most of our investigations, to a point, before calling for our detective or BCI. It was the beginning of our shift, 2p-10p, a bright sunny Sunday afternoon, when dispatch advised of a 'possible Code-18' at a residence in one of the villages we patrolled. Enroute to the scene, I asked my trainee, \"so, have you seen any dead bodies before?\" He says, \"yeah, I've been to two funerals.\" Thinking he was messing with me, I looked at him, he was serious. Okay. As we arrive, we parked behind an ambulance that had arrived shortly before we did, the driver, a former police officer, claimed, 'it's definitely a Code-18'. We could smell the decomposing body two doors away coming from the opened garage door, where another unit had made entry prior to our arrival while conducting a 'check the welfare' of person or persons, I told him we'd handle it since the trainee needed the experience. I used eucalyptus and rubbed the inside of a paper mask, my trainee said he 'was fine'. Getting better and better. When we make it inside, the homeowner is definitely deceased and had been for some time. A large puddle of bodily fluids had expanded from the body and surrounded the body where he laid, head against front door, feet resting on the bottom step of the stairs that led up to the second floor. At this time, my trainee, was fixed on the body, I said, 'look, we need to check the other doors and windows, on this floor, second floor and in the basement', the a/c was on, which probably kept the body in better condition. I opened the basement door, which was directly under the stairs that led up to the second floor, shining my flashlight I could see, and hear, the drip-drip-drip, of the body fluids that had leaked through the floor. I told my trainee, 'hey, bring the camera, you need to get this', he could barely move. Once we determined no forced entry was made, I opened the windows and sliding glass door on the first level. We needed to search the upstairs, meaning we had to jump over the body and all of the fluids leaking out. The trainee made it, first, I actually slipped and would have ended up on my a** in, that. My trainee saved me by grabbing my duty belt, I owed him. We determined the homeowner had gotten out of the shower, upstairs, suffered a fatal medical event, fell down the stairs and ended up where he was found. After speaking to the ME, who telephonically signed off on the body, at this time, we also were able to transmit video and pics of deceased, medications, drugs, death scene, etc., he then made the decision to send the body to the morgue, his office, or the funeral home. After calling for the 'next available' body removal, one of our local funeral homes, we secured the residence and waited outside. My trainee is white and very quiet. I was explaining to him that once they start moving his body, the stench will reach a level you'll never be able to describe. The funeral home van arrives, I have them back into the back yard, out of view of all the neighbors who'd gathered out front. Upon seeing the body, they get p****d because we 'didn't tell them they needed squeegees', I explained, 'I didn't call you, ladies.' As they laid the body bags, multiple, beside the body, I advised they needed to roll the body 'slowly' so I could take pics of the front of the body, he was lying face first. The ladies, used to this, in booties, started 'peeling' him, right to left, off the floor, his face stuck to front door and floor, the ladies, we're talking about watching the race and having company over, but, as they were talking, they would suddenly break into these dry heaves, so it sounded like, 'yeah, I was in the middle of (heave, heave, heave, heave) making Rob chilli, he was watching (heave, heave, heave) the race, my dad just (heave, heave, heave) got there when they (heave, heave, heave) called'. 'I know', said the other, '(heave, heave) my daughter came (heave) home for the (heave, heave, heave) weekend. She wants me (heave, heave, heave, heave) to do her laundry (heave, heave)'hahahaha. My trainee, who'd been standing behind me, while I was taking pictures, was nowhere to be seen. The suction of his skin peeling off, the new stench watching, what was once a human being, scraped, little by little, off the floor of a happy home, he was outside, back yard, holding on to a grill, losing his breakfast. Feeling bad for him, I had the medics give him a once over and sent him home. I'd honestly had never seen a live human look so pale. I've never told him before, but, me, trying to be the 'I've seen a lot' kind of person, almost lost it myself. I retired Jan '13 and we still talk about that day, it always starts, 'so, have you ever seen a dead body before', he says, now, 'more than two!'",

Right before inspections I order all inmates to stand outside of their cell silently and ready and I make the following announcement, which are to be followed directly and zero tolerance. \"Gentleman, everyone needs to be standing outside of their cells silently. Remember, no talking or entering your cells during inspection. There is to be absolutely nothing underneath of your mattresses, nothing on the privacy walls, nothing on your windowsills, nothing on stored on your sinks except 2 bars of soap, all property placed away inside of your totes, bunks made with both sheets and both blankets. If you have any wet laundry that needs to be dried, it just be hung from the back of your bunk or laid out on top of your totes.Jumpers buttoned up and your armbands on, if you do not have an armband make sure you have the pink copy of the request form for your replacement\". I give everyone a 60 second chance to go in and fix any discrepancies by the way before I start.\n\nThese rules are to be followed with zero tolerance, after inspections we allow toilet paper on the privacy wall and cups and 1 book out on the bunk. But for inspection, zero tolerance.\n\nSo I get to a cell and order him to lift his mattress and I notice a small washcloth under his mat, no big deal but it's still a failed inspection meaning he will be locked down the entire shift (ending at 1800 or 6PM). He just lost it, \"come on! It was an accident! I didn't know! Please don't lock me down! Come on please!!\" I informed him, \"we have a zero tolerance policy during inspections, no warnings, that's why we make the speech, we treat all individuals the same, no exceptions.\" Now I wish I could, but I could face possible punishment for letting anything slide.\n\nHe just started balling his eyes out, sobbing, I get bad but, I couldn't do anything about it.",

        "text": "For a while I worked at a crappy retail job, selling high-end electronics to high-end people. This in itself wasn’t such a bad thing, however occasionally we would get some unusual suspects in the store, and naturally I was the closest thing we had to a loss prevention team. Company policy prevents us from chasing people. I however, don’t care for company policy.   It had been fruitless the previous 2 chases. We had coordinated with Mall Security but they left the grounds before Security could get a tail on them. Happily this was a different occasion. At the time the discount table was sitting about 30 feet from the door, and at the absolute INSISTENCE of my jackass general manager, we had put all of our “Open Box” laptops out. There was about $5k in merchandise just sitting on a table, unprotected. \n\nSo I had taken the opportunity to position myself in such a way where I could clearly see the table, while still patrolling my sales area. It was late in the day, the overcast sky hiding the true time, I watched a white male, black hair, 5’10”ish, tan jacket, blue jeans, black beanie, enter the store. He seemed out of place, he didn’t have the deer in the headlights look a lot of people get when they walked into our store. There was a lot of stuff to look at, and naturally as humans, we needed to know where to go. He just kind of knew. He walked to a computer and began playing with it, not usual but the amount of head checks he made put him on my short list. I radioed for my metalhead manager, Mark, to take up a position between him and the door, and had one of our computer specialists intercept him. Grill him to see if he was here for the right reasons. Thieves don’t like attention. Sure as shine he skittered off and left the store in the next 2 minutes. Little high fives for everyone and then back to work. \n\nAs I was getting ready to go to lunch 45 minutes later, tan jacket walks back in, does one head check. Dashes to the table, hugs as many laptops as he can hold and then sprints for the door. We have 30 feet to catch him and I am on the wrong end of the store to do so. I make a break from the back room door and sprint towards the front door. He makes it to the door before either of us, and gets his arm caught up in the goofy metal rungs as he tries to push through the door, which rips not one, but two of his five laptops from his grip. Metalhead Mark and a rabid Rainy shortly behind him. He has a 50 foot head start on us and is jumping into the back of a dark blue BMW that is parked RIGHT outside. Rather than skittering off across the parking lot perpendicularly, it turns, facing the still exposed license plates to us. I am in the parking lot at a full sprint, on the radio, “732-XLR, X-ray, Lima, Romeo.” A blue minivan pull in behind him and I lose sight of his plate. As we head back into the store, he turns right, heading eastbound on 25th ST. I have my cellphone out and call the police. \n\nI divulge the details of what happen as I pick up the dropped laptops from the middle of the street. The dispatcher says she will put out the details. Less than a minute later I get a call. \n\n“Hi! It’s Officer Santiago, City PD. What was the vehicle description again?”\n\n“It was a dark coloured BMW 7-series, 732-XLR” \n\n“Oh, good. I am behind him now. Let me call you back.” I am awestruck, 3 minutes. It took them 3 minutes to find this guy. Why wasn’t City PD this fast all the time? I go to lunch, awaiting the call. \n\n30 minutes later, I get a phone call from Officer Santiago.\n\n“So, we got him. And the laptops, and some cameras, and his wife, and the whole thing is just peachy.” I had to ask him.\n\n“Cool, so. How did you get him?”\n\n“Let me head over to the store.” \n\nAbout 5 minutes later, the blue minivan pulls up, and outsteps a fully uniformed City PD motor officer. *Oh.* As we sit down and take the report, he explains. \n\n“Well, I was coming to your store in the motor unit’s rainy day van to see if you guys could help with this Universal Remote we got for the station. Cause right now it only turns on the TV and we want it to turn on everything. As I pulled up I saw you guys all running out of the store and thought ‘Oh that looks like something.’ and just followed the car until you called.”  \n\nPure. Luck.\n\nIt was all pure luck. Pure luck that this guy was so stupid and so oblivious in just the wrong place where he is getting deported for it now. I sat there and just appreciated the moment. It was a sweet one, so many uncaught thieves, but we got one. And what a sweet fruit justice is.\n\nIt also happened to be pure luck that Officer Santiago’s partner had given me a speeding ticket just 2 weeks prior, on my way to work. He got a laugh out of that, I still got a $150 fine.  :/   \n\nTL;DR: Thief steals laptops handicapped manager put on a table by the door, Loss Prevention Agent Door makes a stop for 2 laptops, and the worst getaway driver in the world combined with one helping of stupid luck means our thief catches cuffs.

Lt sighed and scrunched his face in frustration.\n\n“Because the commander says he’s the guy.” He rolled his eyes as he doubled down on the same argument he had made a moment earlier but Biggs, George and I were dubious.\n\n“But, don’t you think we should have some say into who is going to be the fourth man? I mean, we’re the ones who have to work with the guy every day.

I know he might be goofy-“\n\n“Is goofy; I’ve worked midnights with him.” George took a turn to speak up. “If the dude’s not thumping his bible at us sinners, he’s searching a car on ‘plain smell.’ Dum-dum strikes out two out of three times.

You know how to do the job: if he doesn’t play along, we’ll save it as ammo to shit-can him whenever the commander asks how things are going.”\n\nWe all nodded and came to the same conclusion Lt had prior to breaking the news: we were stuck with him until we could articulate a reason to get rid of him.\n\n“Have fun training him, George.” Biggs leaned back and rested his hand on woven fingers.\n\n“No chance.” George laughed. “This is all you.” The two of them bickered like siblings even though Biggs had been George’s FTO on the street.\n\n“Actually, EMR is the senior guy. I’m sticking Morris with him.” Lt clapped his hands. “I’ll be at my desk!” His voice trailed back into our office as he made his escape before I could comprehend the bombshell. My jaw hung open as I looked to Biggs and George. They paused a beat then erupted in laughter.\n\n“My day’s looking better!” George announced as he swung his chair back to his computer.\n\n“Dude.” I appealed to Biggs. He only shrugged and smiled.\n\n“Lt’s the boss!” He too turned to his computer and began typing.\nI just shook my head. Frigging Morris.\n\n“So, what’s the plan tonight?” Morris had been in the office when I arrived. Apparently he had been there for a couple hours judging by how far along the décor on his desk had progressed. This was the third time he had asked me what our plan was since I had sat down at my own desk. I took a deep breath before turning to answer. Morris was waiting with puppy dog eyes. I was very annoyed.\n\n“Dude, I have no idea. I need to knock out two reports from last week so Lt gets off my ass before I even think about getting into anything new.”\n\n“Oh, right. Cool. I’ll just be over here, at my desk.” He slowly turned away, his face turned down as though I had just taken away his favorite chew toy. I went back to my report and prayed George and Biggs would make it in soon to provide a new master for Morris to hound. I ignored the several bored sighs coming from behind me and wrapped up the narrative of my report. The door creaked open and Biggs swept in.\n\n“Stupid DA tossed my case without even talking to me first!” He threw his gym bag in the direction of his desk and pulled open the fridge to grab a bottle of water. He took a huge gulp and stopped mid-swallow. He had seen Morris’ desk: macaroni glued on construction paper, crayon scribbles that might have been a four legged animal of some variety, Einstein and Link from Zelda bobble heads, and a new reading lamp that was totally unnecessary in our harsh fluorescent lighting adorned the formerly vacant area. Morris beamed at Biggs and rocked a little in his seat with an eager-to-please energy.\n\n“Morris.” Biggs said, flat and without emotion.\n\n“Biggs! Looking forward to combating evil with you!” Morris gushed.\n\n“Yeah. You’re partnered with EMR.” He pulled his chair out but didn’t break his gaze from the arts and crafts.\n\n“Oh, I know. He’s knocking out some reports.” I pretended to be busy at my computer to avoid the awkwardness happening behind me. “He hasn’t told me what we’re doing tonight.”\n\n“You guys can figure that out.” He turned to me. “EMR: George and I might have a lead on Chino.”\n\nI swung around in my chair. “Really? How?”\n\n“Remember that girl that was hanging around his place? Apparently they’re shacking up down the road. She finally updated her DMV and I swung by her house after court and Mr. Recidivist was out front smoking.”\n\n“Damn. Good find. We haven’t seen him in months.”\n\n“Who is Chino?” Morris finally asked.\n\n“Really? Haven’t you seen all of the top offender posters and flyers we’ve been passing around? He’s our number one target ever since we nailed Shahad.” Biggs’ eyes rolled so hard it looked as though they might pop out of their sockets.\n\n“Oh. So Chino is Jim Chiang?” Morris had pulled up one of our Top Offender flyers and was examining it.\n\n“Yeah, it says his alias right underneath.” Biggs turned his back to Morris again. To me he said, “When George gets in, we’re heading over there to watch the place.”\n\n“What am I doing?” George slid into the office and closed the door behind him.\n\n“Got a lead on Chino. We’re going to tail him tonight.”\n\n“Cool.” Being the previous rookie, George was usually up for anything Biggs requested.\n\n“I could just call my informant.” Morris offered.\n\n“Your informant?” I asked.\n\n“Yeah. On my temp in narcotics I used him to buy off of Chiang, like, four times. I just didn’t realize you guys wanted to lock him up so bad.” Morris was still staring at the paper. We were all staring at Morris.\n\n“You mean you’ve got enough in the tank to charge him already? Why… why haven’t you gotten warrants yet?” It seemed as though Biggs was in a strange emotional zone of half awe and half anger. Morris looked up and was taken aback by all of our gazes.\n\n“What? Oh, warrants? I just never went and got them, I guess.” \n\nThere was a moment of silence in the office where I’m fairly certain each of us pondered some different aspect of Morris’s revelation.\n\nI can only speak to my own observation of the situation but I feel it encompassed a good chunk of the underlying ridiculousness. Biggs’s face was slowly retracting into itself, his brow furrowing deeper than I had ever seen, eyes squinting in confusion, and mouth in a steep frown. He looked like he might cry. Morris avoided our glares by going back to studying the Top Offender flyer, looking up occasionally but retreating back to the safety of its concealment when he realized we were still staring. George was doing the same as me – bouncing back and forth between the other two and reveling in the awkwardness. While our whole team was invested in the case against Chino, Biggs was the most committed. He was also taking the news from our most recent addition the hardest. The answer to our predicament had arrived in the form of the human equivalent of a slightly mentally handicapped, overweight golden retriever.\n\nAfter several seconds of silence and studying every pixel of the flyer, Morris finally looked up from his paper fortress of solitude.\n\n “So, what are we doing tonight?” With nothing else to add I guess he reverted to his old standby.\n\n“YOU, are getting warrants. WE ALL are going to lock up Chino.” Biggs swung his chair around from standoff with Morris. “I’m going to start the search warrant now; we’ll fill in the rest after we get this asshole in cuffs.” Biggs was predicting a productive evening.\n\nAfter way too much time, Morris finally returned with the warrants for distribution of marijuana in hand. Biggs greeted him with the same lack of warmth he had exhibited earlier, but I knew he was eager to get things under way. His half-authored search warrant had been combed over by all of us in turn and well-illustrated Chino’s illustrious criminal history as well as made many valid arguments as to why the fruits of a signed search warrant would ultimately benefit the community as a whole. Now all we needed was some actual probable cause and something to look for we’d be cooking with gas.\n\nIt was still light out when we set up on Chino’s girlfriend’s house. The initial forecast looked grim. “Suzie’s car’s not here.” Biggs aired over the radio.\n\n“Well, let’s give it a few anyways; maybe she just took off to the store.” I countered. Morris shifted in the passenger seat nervously.\n\n“Why don’t we just go knock?” He asked.\n\n“Don’t want to play our cards too early. We’re tucked in pretty decently: if he pulls up we’ll see him before he sees us. If he’s home, dude smokes like a chimney – he’ll be out sparking up in no time. Just relax.” I peered through binoculars and tried to see into the windows lining the front of the home.\n\nAfter a couple hours, Biggs had a new plan. “Why don’t we just go knock?”\n\nMorris tried to suppress his smile. “You cover the back.” I told him, helping him in his endeavor.\n\nOur knock was answered by a middle aged middle-eastern male. “What?” He said through the storm door.\n\n“Hi, sir. We’re the police! We just have a quick question. Is Chi- I mean, is Jim Chiang here?” Biggs asked.\n\n“Chino? No, I kick him and my daughter out of here. They come back, they know I call you guys. I don’t let anyone sell the drugs in my house.” He crossed his arms across his chest. “Anything else?”\nThe disappointment was clear on Biggs’s face. “Well, do you know where they went?” He asked.\n\n“His family house, I guess. I don’t care.” The man went to close the door but Biggs caught him just before it shut.\n\n“Wait! Did he leave anything behind?”\n\nThe man hesitated a moment, the opened the door again. “He say his safe too heavy. It’s in the back.” He swung open the storm door and we entered. The house reeked of mildew and cat piss and the carpet looked like it hadn’t seen a vacuum since it was installed with the home’s construction in the 60’s. The man introduced himself as Ali and escorted us back to Chino’s former room. The stink of weed smacked us in the face as we crossed the threshold. The only items in the room were the aforementioned safe – tucked into the bare closet, door slightly open – and a yellow stained mattress on the floor. George made small talk with Ali in the hall while Biggs bent down to check the safe. It was mostly empty save for a few papers on the top shelf.\n\n“Oh well.” I turned to leave.\n\n“Oh well nothing. Check this!” Biggs was smiling ear to ear, showing off his discovery like a proud parent. He held up an owner’s manual for a gun – an MP5 .22 clone. Biggs brought his treasure to Ali in the hallway, still chatting with George, and held it up. “Have you seen him with this gun?”\n\nHe studied the black and white photo for a moment, and then nodded his head in the affirmative. “He take it out today, first thing.”\n\n“And you said he was kicked out for selling drugs in your house?” Biggs continued.\n\n“Yeah. He kept a big bag of marijuana in the room. Sell every night, all night long – people coming, people going. This place stink!”\n\n“And you saw all this in person?” Biggs set the trap.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nThere was a pause before Biggs sprung. “Do you want Chino to go to jail and leave your daughter alone?”\n\nA few hours later we had tracked down Chino’s parent’s house – a swanky Townhouse outside our patrol area but still within our department’s jurisdiction. Biggs had added all the information from Suzie’s dad and rounded out the search warrant to include looking for drugs and guns and all the related accouterments as well as for Chino himself. If we had a positive ID on him at the home – enough to support he would be found inside on executing the search warrant – no court official would bat an eye at signing the search warrant. I was again sitting next to Morris in our unmarked car, and he was staring to get the nervous jitters.\n\n“I’ve got to pee.”\n\n“Dude, you just went twenty minutes ago before we got here. Can’t you hold it?” I was starting to wonder if maybe in place of a clueless cop I had been partnered with a old woman with incontinence issues.\n\n“No, really. I’m about to piss my pants. This happens when I play hide and seek too, you know what I’m talking about?”\n\nI blinked at him a few times and wondered how recently he had played hide and seek. “Well, here’s a big gulp cup. It’s either that or roll over to those trees and be one with nature.”\n\nMorris took the cup as I turned back to the binoculars. He slowly placed it on the ground and then reached for the door handle. I ignored him as he exited and walked to the evergreen trees we were parked next to. A second later the door opened and a wide eyed Morris was torn between tucking away his manhood and regaling me with his discovery.\n\n“He’s there! In the gazebo on the other side of the trees! Smoking weed right now!!” He was out of breath and rasping so as not to be heard.\n\n“Crap, he must’ve gone out the back door. Biggs,” I keyed up the radio. “Chino’s here at the gazebo. Go get that paper signed, we’ll hold down the fort until you get back.” Biggs’ unmarked, parked down the street on the other side of the town house, came to life in reply to my traffic. He gave a “thumbs up” as he tore out of the neighborhood in the direction of the judicial complex.\n\n“You.” I turned to Morris. “Keep an eye on those trees and make sure Chino doesn’t squirt out the other way. We can’t lose him now but we should try and take him in the house if we want to match him to whatever we find in there. If he walks, we grab him.”\n\nMorris just nodded back and turned his attention to the trees again.\n“Did you pee at least?”\n\nMorris glanced down at his crotch with concern. “Do we have napkins in here?”\n\nChino went back into the house a few minutes later, and a few minutes after that Biggs returned with reinforcements. He gave the word over the radio and we all disembarked our cruisers and made our way to the house. With people watching the back, we knocked on the front door. Chino’s mom answered and was confused by the battalion that greeted her. “Yes?”\n\n“Evening ma’am. We have a search warrant. Is your son here?” Biggs led the way.\n\n“Yes, up in his room, why? What is this about?” She stepped back and let us in. Several of us made our way quietly up the stairs while Lt occupied the mom in the foyer. There was only one door closed and the unmistakable smell of burning marijuana crept out from under it. Biggs gave the sign to move and tried the knob. The door swung open and there he was – in a pair of boxers with a blunt hanging from his lips, sorting clothing out of his suitcase and putting it into a dresser. Suzie was on the bed, topless and surprised. She scrambled to cover herself as we challenged Chino to show us his hands and surrender. After he was cuffed, we dressed him, told him he had warrants for his arrest, and also a search warrant for his house. He took the news in stride, even challenging us a bit.\n\n“Good for you assholes. You ain’t gonna find nothin’ but this blunt. I’ll be back out tomorrow.”\n\nSuzie cursed us from the bed as Biggs handed her a robe. “You all keep harassing us. We ain’t even do nothin’!”\n\nWe moved Chino and Suzie downstairs once they were decent and sat them on the couch where Chino’s mom and Dad stared at them with the anger of a thousand castrated bulls. Biggs asked Chino’s parents, “Is all his property upstairs? We don’t want to destroy your place but we need to make sure we get anything illegal out of here for everyone’s good.”\n\n“It’s all in my room.” Chino piped up. Chino’s mom’s reaction gave a different answer.\n\n“Well?” Biggs asked her again.\n\n“He’s got a box in the garage.” She turned, defeated by the fact she knew her son brought something into her house and was trying to have her lie about it.\n\nMorris and I made our way to the garage. He picked one side of the cluttered floor while I took the other. I prayed inwardly that I could win this bout, would find the gun and show Morris that this team knew how to get things done.\n\n“Found a gun!” He chirped up before I was even done with my first box. I looked to him with a little disappointment as he held the semi-auto handgun up with two gloved fingers as though it was road kill. He was far too happy for my liking.\n\nAfter the dust settled, we decompressed at the station. Chino had been booked on several new felony charges (he had a pound of weed and a few dozen ecstasy pills stashed away in an empty Jordans shoe box in his closet and we found paperwork with his name in the same box as the gun) and was looking down the barrel of a decade plus in jail. Morris took off early since he had come in early to set up his desk. We finished the reports and packaging of the evidence and finally had a moment of peace before turning it in for the night.\n\n“How’d his first day go?” Lt came in and spun a chair into the middle of the room. He knew we would pick up who he was referring to.\n\nWe all looked around, no one wanting to be the first to admit maybe we had been wrong.\n\n“Ok, I guess.” Biggs finally said.\n\n“He gave the info we needed to get rid of Chino, right?” Lt needled, not content with the half-hearted compliment.\n\n“Yeah,” I said. “He also pissed all over the Impala.”\n\nLt looked confused. Biggs and George smiled. “Guess he’s got some rookie cleaning duty tomorrow!”\n\nWe were a tough crowd to break into.",

        "text": "Someone asked if I had more stories and naturally. I have more stories. Most of them don’t fall under TFTSC, but I figured this one was as close as I have gotten since my carjacking.  At the time I was an Uber driver, using it as a way to familiarise myself with the areas I wanted to potentially work in. While I awaited my drug usage history to get to more “acceptable” timeframes, I worked into the night. I was also getting involved with a pre-medical team that works large events and had cut my teeth a fair amount as a drug recognition specialist, working with people on a plethora of party, psychoactive and other drugs. Helping with OD’s, trip sitting, people management. \n\nSo I am not exactly a stranger to people on bad trips, I also know the extent of the laws surrounding the Good Samaritan law and protective custody.  Basically, I am that kid that experimented a lot, learned a lot, and quit while I was still ahead and am using my experience to hopefully help other people in need. But rarely do I get these calls when I am not wearing my credentials. \n\nI was sat at home after a short but sweet night of Ubing. I sat in my pajamas, convincing myself to go to bed. This had failed for the previous hour and a half of sitting there idly, watching the screen change colours. I knew I should be in bed, I had a brunch the next morning, but why am I still sitting here? I have brunch reservations at 11:20AM the next morning an hour away. \n\n The phone rang. It was one of my stoner friends Nate. He was whispering, a sign something was abnormal.  \n\n“HEY RAINN. I UH…. I COULD USE YOUR HELP WITH SOMETHING.” My brow quirked in the kitchen, his voice was full of a stoned urgency, whispered but loudly. He could have just talked.\n\n“Yeah? What’s up?” \n\n“Well you know how there was that festival tonight?” \n\n“Yeah, I only picked people up from it tonight.” I said, one sentence recapping my night.\n\n“Well… We were on out way back and… Well.. Josh got out of the car. And he’s on a roof.” \n\n“What do you mean he is on a roof?” I stopped typing. \n\n“Like he is on. A roof.”\n\n“Like the roof of the new house?” \n\n“No dude. Like a random persons roof.” \n\n“Oh fuck.” I went silent as I recounted a conversation I had over instant message with Josh just hours before. He was making no sense, seeming to ride the logic of his mind and his mind only, everything was a really big deal. LSD for sure. I continued.\n\n“Well what is he on?” \n\n“1 Drop of Acid on a sugar cube.” \n\n“Thought so. What neighbourhood am I going too? Can you get me an address?” \n\n“Yeah. I’ll text it to you. We are on Lake Sandwich Road between Citysville and Burbtown.”\n\n“Okay I should be about 20 minutes out, I am coming from South Burbtown near Nice Hill. Cross our fingers the cops don’t get called.”\n\nThe only reason I was going was because I was a sober person who knew the involved party personally. And if cops showed up I felt like I could speak enough cop to make them feel like we were doing what we could just as well as they could. Without literally breaking my friends mind, and making him act erratic and crazier than he already was. He was a really good kid, and he didn’t deserve what he would have got if they came and arrested him or took him into protective custody. Or so I thought. The part of town he was in was famous for being slow at night. Between Citysville and Burbtown they shared a dispatch centre with neighbouring Slowland and Richville because that’s how slow their individual dispatch was. If they showed up, there was no way my friend wasn’t getting arrested. \n\nI gathered my necessities and hopped in the car. I got the address on the way and was there 15 minutes later. As I pulled up I see two of my friends on the side of the road. I park up and approach them.  \n\n“Hey Nate, Travis.” I still can’t see Josh. Travis was another one of my good friends, he was the younger brother of one of my friends in High School so we’ve known each other a long time. He looks at me with the eyes of a high kid.  \n\n“What are you guys on?” \n\n“I’m on acid too.” Nate spit out.\n\n“I got sassy molassy.” Travis says. \n\n“Alright cool. Where is he?” They both pointed to the roof behind me. I spun around and saw a figure on the roof. *Oh.*\n\n“Hey Josh.” I say friendly enough. He sees me and climbs farther up the roof. I am not about to go up there to try to get him. I am going to see if my presence is enough to make him come down. Playing the friendly approach.\n\nHe is only a figure on the roof, but I can see his exposed arms in the light a little, his pale skin showing in the night just barely. This is one of the most conservative, anti crazy stuff kids I have ever known, and he is on someones roof scantily clad on a cold fall night. Uncommunicative. *Oh boy.*  I try to get more details out of them, \n\n“What was his behavioural pattern before he ended up there?”\n\n“Well. We were driving back from Svens after dropping them off after the show.” \nI groaned. Sven had a habit of being the worst friend ever when he was dating a girl. He was 8 months into a relationship and he hadn’t talked to me in 3 months.  \n\n“You guys saw Sven?” \n\n“Yeah we did dabs at his place.”  I was on thin ice with Sven, I get over it.\n\n“Okay, and how did you end up here?”\n\n“Well we were being followed. So we just kept making turns.” While this doesn’t make sense to me, it seems to make sense to them.\n\n“Okay.” He continued. “Well as we realized we didn’t know where we were, Josh just got out while we were going kinda slow.” \n\n“Wow, damn. And then he climbed up there?”\n\n“Not before trying to throw a chair through their window.”\n\n“Did you guys stop him?”\n\n“Yeah but then he climbed up the roof.”\n\n“Ah. As so here we are.”\n\nI hear a crashing come from somewhere behind the house. *What the fuck was that?*  \n\nOut of a thicket of bushes comes Josh. He is wearing some kind of tanktop, and really short shorts. Suggestive, but not unlike him. \n\n“Hey guys! I need to go home.”\nAs he gets closer to me, I smell something. *Human shit.*\n \nHe is completely naked, and covered in his own shit, wearing a shit tank top made of shit, his hands are covered in shit and he is just acting like it's a Friday night. He comes at me with a purpose, I side step, not about to get poopy. He then makes a move to get INTO my car, covered in his own shit. Almost like a video game character. Completely focused on getting into the car. \n\n*Fuck that shit. He is about to take my car. Or at least get in my car, and cover it with shit.*  I am not about to let that shit happen, I’ve been carjacked once already and at least he wasn’t covered in shit. I wasn’t about to let it happen again, more so because he was covered in shit, and I would have to have my car cleaned to get the shit smell out so I could work for Uber.  \n\nNope.jpg.\n\n I wrap an elbow around his neck, and get an arm on his bicep and wrench him from the car, he grabs on with superhuman strength to the frame of the door. I pinch my elbow shut around his air way and wrench him harder, this time with a better stance. He pops free, and I pin myself against the car so he can’t kick or elbow me without hitting my car first. And so his poopy side stays away from me as much as possible.\n\n “JOSH. JOSH.” I say sternly. “Are you with me Josh?”\n\n“Yeah I am here.”\n\n“Hey buddy, it’s Rainy. Do you know why I am here?” I start, calm as a school nurse. \n\n“No.”\n\n“I drove out here in my pyjamas because I am worried about your physical safety, I am worried about your mental health, and I don’t want to let you cause harm to yourself or anyone else okay?”\n\n“Okay.”\n\n“But I need someone who I can work with, can you work with me?” \n\n“Yeah. Does this mean you will let go of me?” He said, almost childishly.\n\n“Yes I will let go of you. But I need you to work with me, ready?”\n\nI let go of him. He doesn’t act crazy. We have someone we can work with.\n\n“So Josh, what did you do with your clothes?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“Okay thats fine, how does cleaning off and taking a nice warm shower sound?”\n\n“Sounds really good. *I need to go home.*” His change in tone scares me, but I’ll take it.\n\n“Alright buddy, lets go.”\n\nTravis, Nate and the naked chode-showing Josh all walk towards Travis’ car. I run back to my car, close up the window and lock it. Hoping to return to grab it in time to get sleep for my brunch.\n\nAs I return to the car an unlock it. I sit in the driver seat, the only really sober driver here and we start to go the less than a mile to the house. \n\n “Hey man since it doesn’t matter anyways, can you **crash the car into someones house** so I can take a shower there?” He said it completely serious, on the edge of an order almost. I was sitting next to a drug-induced psychopath. \n\n“No man, I can’t do that. That’d ruin Travis’ car. Your house isn’t far from here anyway.” \n\nWe get to the house, we go inside. We act like it’s cool. I dish out orders to the people at the house. We have now added Cleo, Rick and Caleb to the party. I tell them, his housemates to secure his keys so he can’t drive anywhere if he slips out of the house. \n\n\"Everyone secure their keys and hide them. He tried to take my car, he will try to take yours too.” Everyone nods like they understand the importance of keeping someone in this state of mind from crashing their car through a house. \n\nI deputize Travis and Cleo to watch him closely. Keep track of him. Nate and I begin the long walk back to my car.  \nAbout half way to the car, I get a call from Travis. “Yeah?” I answer, almost sure this has no good news.\n\n“So we might have lost him?” \n\n**“MIGHT HAVE? THERE IS NO MIGHT HAVE EITHER YOU DID OR YOU DIDN’T.”**\n\n“We lost him.” \n\n“How?” \n\n“Well we were downstairs, he said he was just chilling and taking a bath and we went upstairs and he was gone, so is his car. He must have snuck out.”\n\n I am dumbfounded. It seems I am the only person in this group of people who can actually fucking do anything without entirely fucking up. The two things I told people to do where the two things that were going to keep him relatively close to home and be a lower risk to the public, if they had kept track of him, he wouldn’t have had time to find his keys or sneak out. If they had his keys he wouldn’t be able to take a 2 ton weapon. And if they hadn’t been completely inept at understanding what “Keep track of” meant, we wouldn’t fucking be here! He literally walked out the front door unopposed.\n \n Nate and I run the remaining half-mile to the car and race back into the neighbourhood he took off from. He must have gone a different way because we were on the main roads out of the neighbourhood the whole time.  We redouble our efforts, double our people, check twice as many streets and still nothing. Happily no wreckage either. It’s 4:30 in the morning by the time we call off our search. \n\nNo Josh, no car, no news. We smoke a kajillion weeds and at some point we realise we know someone who has gotten “[Schwifty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1188GO4p1E)” and we die of laughter from the reference. I go home at 6AM, get surprisingly good sleep and wake up the next morning and go to brunch none the wiser. \n\nMeanwhile back at the house Josh has returned, confused and in a surreal state.  \n\n“Did last night happen?”  According to him, he thought that everything was a simulation, and that nothing mattered. He felt true freedom within his mind for the first time, which apparently means stripping nakies, smearing shit on himself, jumping off of a roof batman style and ruining someones gutters, throwing his and Nates wallets into the darkness and then driving his car 20 miles south in a bad trip after sneaking out of the least difficult house to sneak out of ever.  He was guilt ridden and embarassed. I however was happily enjoying a delicious seafood brunch on the waterfront, full of ham, crepes, crab and $3 mimosas. \n\n**TL;DR: Good people have bad trips, and can become very shitty friends. Literally.**",

        "text": "Growing up, my dad always appreciated old classic cars. He's a big guy, 6'4 and easily clearing 280 pounds, so most modern day vehicles simply weren't comfortable for him. Big, classic American cars on the other hand... Those were his thing. He ended up with quite a few of them, and when it came time for my parents to move out of town, I ended up being given one by my dad. \n\n\nThe car I had my eye on since I was 16 was what I fondly referred to as \"the pimp-mobile\". A big, black 1988 Cadillac Eldorado, gloriously adorned with silver chrome wheels and trim. All-black leather interior, and beautiful oak-trim on the dash and steering wheel. The pimp-mobile was my noble steed, and took me from point A to point B in glorious style. (Pics: http://imgur.com/a/eog7T)\n\n\nThere were several memorable incidents I have in my time driving this car, but the one which stands out the most to me was when an officer stopped me in the middle of the night as I was leaving the east side of town. Like almost all of my weird stories, it involves food...\n\n\nThe smell of green curry wafted gently through the car, and my stomach growled eagerly. *This was what it was all about*, I thought with a smile. *The true reason why I kept a closing-shift job downtown... CURRY.*\n\n\nI lived, at the time, some twelve miles north of downtown. All of the good restaurants closed up at 9:30 on the dot, when I typically began to crave something spicy and delicious. I guess I could make this stuff at home, but with (Thai Restaurant) open late and just an eight minute drive from the mall, why would I?\n\n\nThus, my current state. 10:20 PM, curry carefully stowed behind my seat, and the sounds of Earth, Wind and Fire serenading me through a spankin' bass system as I glided my land-yacht down the main drag of the east side as I made my way to the freeway. \n\n\nAs I caught a whiff of jasmine rice, my stomach growled eagerly. I bit my lip, considering the wisdom of trying to drink scalding hot curry on the 101 freeway. *Probably not the best idea...*\n\n\nI glided around the roundabout, and floored it on the on ramp. No sooner than I hit the gas, I saw a car change from the far left lane to get directly behind me. I scowled, knowing what was likely about to happen. Nobody ever willingly gets behind my car unless they're following me somewhere, it simply rode low and slow. Sure enough, one minute hardly had passed before the blindingly bright blueberries and cherries lit up behind me. \n\n\n*Sh!t... My roti better not get cold.*\n\nSignal right, pull over at the next off ramp at the officers instructions, park car, dome light on. Check, check, check, and check. Then I saw not one, but both officers exit the vehicle and approach with their hands hovering a bit closer to their holsters than I would like. \n\n\nAs the officer came to my window, a hideously bright light flashed into my car and I winced at the assault on my retinas. Taking this to be my cue, I rolled down the window a crack, letting in the crisp night air (and letting out the tantalizing scent of Thai food), only to be met with the usual: \n\n\n\"License, registration, proof of insurance please.\"\n\n\nI nodded, \"It's in my glovebox. Is it okay if I...?\" trailing off as I noticed the other officer thoroughly engrossed with shining his light in my backseat through the windows. \n\n\nI must have made a face, because the first officer seemed quite uninterested by my paperwork in lieu of interrogating me. \n\n\n\"It says here that this car is registered to a Mr. (Pops) (Last Name). Is that your...\"\n\n\n\"My father,\" I filled in. \"He is letting me drive the car while I save up to buy my own.\"\n\n\nThe officer nodded. Curious cop, as I had now dubbed him, seemed quite interested in the plastic bag tucked behind my seat. \n\n\n\"What's in the bag?\" he asked. \n\n\nAs if awaiting an academy award nomination, my stomach let loose an embarrassingly loud series of growls. I blushed, and looked at him forlornly. \n\n\n\"Well, it was a hot dinner. Now it's more like a lukewarm one.\"\n\n\nThat got me a snort of a chuckle. \n\n\n\"I figured as much. Smells good.\"\n\n\nI gazed up at the first officer, willing my eyes to transmit every ounce of the hunger-born desperation I felt to eat my curry meal. It apparent had some effect, as the officer's next words were: \"Do you know why I stopped you?\"\n\n\nI shook my head. \"Nope.\"\n\n\nThe officer vaguely waved his hand toward the trunk region of my car. \"Left taillight is out. I'm writing you a fixit ticket.\"\n\n\n\"Oh. Okay...\" \n\n\nThe officer wrote the ticket, passed it to me for my signature and gave me my copy. He then looked me in the eye, and uttered the words I had been half-expecting to hear this whole time. \n\n\n\"Your dad has a nice car... You uh--you 're not *quite* what I expected to find in this thing.\"\n\n\nI suppressed a laugh. \n\n\n\"I get that reaction a lot, can't imagine why.\" I quipped. Curious cop snorted and suddenly seemed busy with nothing, and the first officer's lips twitched imperceptibly. \n\n\n\"Well drive safe and take this thing to the shop first thing before you go anywhere else tomorrow, okay?\"\n\n\n\"Alright.\" \n\n\nWith that, the two officers walked back to the squad car, and I turned the music back on. Profiling is a real thing, but I guess sometimes it can be really misleading. Nobody ever expects to find a wide-eyed white girl behind the wheel of a monster old pimpmobile!\n\n\n ",

        "text": "I have been sitting on this one for a while now. Partly because the responsible parties hadn’t been tried yet and mostly because I was lazy. I am trying to channel my inner u/El_Mono_Rojo but I don’t know how well I will do. \n\nOnce upon a time, I bought a fully functioning ex-police car from a dealer in Orange County. I don’t know the details entirely, but I ended up with a police car, that still had a lightbar on it, and the sun damaged black and white paint with the lettering still barely visible in the undamaged parts of the clear coat. (Of course I don’t know this cause I bought it at night. NEVER BUY A CAR AT NIGHT.) This is just the last of many fun tales I have had in this car, but for the most part this is the best.  \n\nMy friends had invited me to a Friendsgiving in a less than peachy part of town. I actually spent a good deal at my grandmothers growing up less than half a mile from where this all took place, so I felt comfortable in an otherwise sketchy neighbourhood, plus it was only 6PM. After all, I was driving an old Crown Vic, now devoid of lights, but still very black and white. I am 22 years old, 6’2” have blue spikey Tumblr hair and generally don’t get bothered by people.  As I pull up outside the house I notice all the parking up the street is completely taken. I have nowhere to park my land boat and have to use the cul-de-sac at the end of the right branch of the street and loop back to check the left branch. It too, was all parked up, except for a spot at the end where the street stopped. Rather than park there, I figured I would park outside the development, and walk in.  \n\nNow I have to paint a picture here of the arena. There is a main road that runs north to south, we will call this 2nd Ave. Off of it is an west east running street that is only about 50 feet long this will be 10th Street. To the west of 2nd Ave is the development road 1st Ave. It’s a cul-de-sac at both ends. The right arm (north) has a left hand turn in it, the left arm (to the south) is a straight shot with no house at the end, just a bunch of blackberry bushes. Both roads are less than a 1/4 mile long. \n\nNow that you are completely confused and don’t care at all. I drove out of the development North onto 2nd Ave. I flipped a U-turn and parked up on the NW corner of 2nd Ave &amp; 10th Street. As I am sitting there, there is just this very strange tension in the air. I see a black Camaro turn right onto 10th Street, I notice it has a California tag, just like my crown vic. I get out of the car after letting it pass me, and begin to grab my casserole, beers and tortilla chips. As I set my things on the trunk I notice a black male, maybe 5’8”, wearing a red jacket and a black hat has come from around the corner of the fence on 10th Street.  Something doesn’t sit right with me, he wasn’t phased, he didn’t twitch or react they way people usually do. He speaks up. \n\n“Hey man, sick car. Where’d you get that?” This was a conversation I have had before, but this time something is very wrong. He didn’t have to spend anytime registering the cop car, he just knew about it. I would have seen him on foot if he was just a random passerby, seeing as I just went through the neighbourhood he came from. I try to carry the conversation warmly and greet him. \n\n“Heh yeah man, I snagged this down in Cali.” \n\nHe smiled and said “Oh yeah, how much did it run you?” \n\t\nI thought about it for a second and didn’t care to divulge entirely. “Eh, it was a few grand.” \n\t\nHe nods and says, “Alright now give me the keys.” Producing a Glock 30, .45ACP pistol out of his right jacket pocket. \n\nMy brain slams into fight or flight. Time slows, *way* down. I look at the gun, look at him, look at his posture, look at his body language, I look at his grip on the gun. I study this clown as fast as I can. \n\t\n“No.” I tell him flatly. I have a lot of firearms training, and I know when someone knows how to use a gun. You can read it off them. You can see it in their movements, their actions. He didn’t have any of those right. Hell he was standing 3 feet from me. If he was 15 feet away and pointed the gun at me he would have driven off in my car. But this was amateur hour. \n\n“No.” Seemed to surprise him. He hadn’t expected resistance, *What does I do now?* Well naturally wave the gun around more. \n\t\n“I’m serious.” He says gesturing with the gun. While he does this he gives me one big tell on his bluff. He rotates the gun in his grip at the wrist. I know not to do that, he should too. \n\t\n“So am I.” I said just as flatly as before, unfazed.\n\tIn my head I have decided to strike, but his body positioning doesn’t allow for the disarm I have practiced. He has the gun tight to his body, next to his jacket pocket still. I need to get the gun out of battery and turn it into the biggest liability he has ever held in his hand. I am already dumped on adrenaline. *This is the guy that makes me have to get background checked when I buy guns. This is the guy that uses firearms like keys to honest peoples things, honest peoples livelihoods.* I was pissed. But I was ready.  \n\nHe is at a stump zone. I haven’t been outright rude or threatening to him and he isn’t getting what he wants out of me. He starts to dig through my pockets. He reaches into my right pocket, which is full of slightly warm air and some lint, but nothing else. As he reaches into my left pocket where my wallet and keys are, he is searching with his left hand which means his body is all crossed up. His right hand has the gun, and I am completely out of the line of fire. All the lights in my head that were yellow, flip green. \n\nI let go the bag full of tortilla chips in my right hand and come up low, behind his line of sight, hand already balled into a fist. My left hand snaps up with a practiced fury and grabs the slide of the glock. A drill I have practiced many times, but this one had to count. I feel the ejection port and the sights in against my hand and pull against the back of the gun, I feel the slide move as my right fist hits him in the side of the head, I follow through. I bellow at the top of my lungs, (a frightening 105dba of screaming tranny.) \n\n**“NOT LIKE THIS MOTHERFUCKER!”** And I hit him again, hard.  \nI have spent thousand and thousands of hours practicing all of these things to look good on a screen or on stage, and there we always fake it. Pull the punches, fake the hits. I have never once in my life been in a situation where I am in the right by putting a hurting on someone. I realised this as I was landing my fourth hit against his head. I probably never really will get this opportunity again. But more importantly, I need to get this gun. We tangle down 2nd Ave towards 10th. By the time he trips up over the curb and spills into the intersection, I am somewhere in the double digits as far a punches go all to the head and neck. I have fully started my psychological warfare campaign. I am screaming at the top of my lungs drill sergeant status. \t\n\n**“I AM GOING TO FUCKING KILL YOU.”** The guy that was calmly talking to you 15 seconds ago about the car you were trying to steal is now fighting you very effectively and screaming about how they are going to murder you for making the mistake of trying to take from them.  \n\nHe is flat on the pavement in the intersection, and we become untangled. I stay up, but slide past him on the cold concrete and the contents of my pockets go flying across the intersection. I go back to kick him but he lands an upward kick to my torso and scrambles up. As I recover and turn back to charge at him again, trying to keep under the 7ft rule. He spins around and pistol-whips me. Dazing me, and knocking me to the ground this time. He too, tries to kick me. \n\nIt was here, why I understand now why video game action sequences seem to be so slow. I was just sitting there in my own head, playing DrivingRainn: The Game. I am watching his basketball shoe scream toward my head in super slow motion, probably 1/10 real speed. If I move too fast, he can correct, if I move too late, he connects. *Wait, wait, wait… NOW.* I duck under his kick, compress my arms like a spring and as his foot clears my head, pop up literally right behind him as his spins 180˚ to turn and run westbound on 10th Street. I am up like a spider monkey behind him, still landing punches against his head. It’s about now I notice he is screaming something.\n\t\n“HIT HIM! HIT HIM! HIT HIM!” He screams in a panic. But to who? I notice the black Camaro, cali tags, sitting in the intersection of 1st Ave and 10th Street pointed towards us. I hear the car begin to move as he suddenly pulls another 180˚ to run eastbound 10th Street on the south side of the street. I am now screaming something like. \n\n**“OOOH A CAR, COME BACK HERE MOTHERFUCKER.”** And I mean it. My hasty plan looks like this. Stay as close to the gunman as possible so his friend can’t just rek me, cause he would hit his homie too. I will jump on the hood, like I have practiced before, and roll off the side. Get back to dealing with the gunman as fast as possible. It goes pretty much to plan, except I went rolling off to one side of the car, while our gunman went to the other and jumped just a fraction of a second late. I land on my feet after rolling off the hood, the car stops. \n\nIt's right here I wish I had a gun. I would have the drop on our gunman and a clean shot. I slam my fist agains the passenger window and the car gets spooked driving out from between us. Leaving gun man, for the first time, farther than 7 feet from me. I charge him.\n\n**“COME HERE.”** And he begins to raise the gun, I actually feel like he might have a shot, I sidestep and he fires one round into the pavement. I feel something against my leg. He looks at me like a man stuck in a cage with a wild animal. \n\t\n“WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU. ARE YOU CRAZY?!” He screams at me, genuinely confused.\n\t\n“Looks like it.” I said back, calm as ever again.\n\t\n“All this over a fucking car?!” He points\n\t\n“All this over a fucking car.” I smile, extending my arms out in a \"yeah you made this happen\" gesture.\n\t\n“Man I shoulda capped you.” He says grabbing my wallet off the ground and limping back to the car.  \t\n\t\n“Maybe you should have.” I stop myself. I haven’t ever talked trash about *anything*, and I don’t know why I decided to start now, but I wasn’t about to get ventilated over it. *Shut up.* \t\n\t\n“I shoulda capped you, I shoulda capped you, I shoulda capped you…” He gets in the car and drives off, V6 roaring into the night. I stand in the dramatic single light of the intersection of 2nd ave and 10th. I let out a warriors cry. I have just successfully completed the **stupidest** fucking thing I have ever done in real life.\n\nExhale.\n\nI am a buzz of electricity, I check my leg to make sure I don’t have a new leg piercing I can’t feel under the adrenaline, my head hurts from the pistol whip and my leg is tweaked a little from the car. I grab my beers, casserole and chips and walk to the door. I pound the door hard with purpose. My friend opens the door. \n“Hey!” She says, nonchalant as ever, for now blissfully unaware of my last minute and a half. \n\n“Hey did you hear anything?” I ask her, already knowing the answer.\n\t\n“Yeah I heard a boom, what was that?”\n\t\n“Oh you know that was just me getting shot at.” I drop on her. The blood in her face drains and she looks at me like a crazy person. \n\t\n“WHAT?!” The 30+ person party drops silent.\n\nOne 911 call later, a skeptical Sheriff’s deputy is standing at the door. I give him my information and I realise I don’t have my wallet. I don’t have my ID, or my keys, or anything. As the second cop shows up, he parks on 10th Street. Both cops are facing outwards from the development. We walk though the crime scene. We find my keys, lighter, and contents of my pocket strewn about 10th street, but no wallet. And no spare key in said wallet. We find the shell casing and as we are finishing up, he asks if I have any evidence I might have gotten off of him. I go back to my car and find that the hat, was actually a facemask. And he could have easily robbed me like a professional if he hadn’t been such a half ass. I hand it off to them. \n\t\n“It’s amateur hour man. I can’t believe it.” Cop 2 takes the mask and Cop 1 gives me a fist bump, \n“And nice job on kicking that guys ass first.”\n\nNo more than 10 seconds later. Cop 1 speaks up.\n\n“BLACK CAMARO! BLACK CAMARO!” I listen, *V8 or V6?* \n\n**V6.**\n\t\n**“IT’S THEM IT’S THEM!”** \nI look up into the intersection just in time to see my black and white race past, headlights out. The first thought through my head is just the calmest sounding. \n\n*He’s not going to find the headlights.*\n\nNot “OMG THEY STOLE MY CAR”, not “ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME”, Just “He’s not going to find the headlights”. When I bought the car, I spent 5 minutes looking for the headlights on the car. The switch wasn’t there. Not where I expected. They are on the dash, hard left almost at the edge of the dash, hidden more or less under the spotlight handle. \n\nHe had maybe 10 seconds to find it, and didn’t. And was racing through one of the darkest neighbourhoods with no lights. Having just put exhaust on it, I can actually hear my car bouncing off the rev limiter in 1st, he had cranked the gear selector down in the darkness and was going 40MPH, but no faster as he churns the steering wheel around the off camber, 90˚ turn onto 9th Street. \nThis intersection drops about 1 story and is blind, off camber and dark as my sense of self-worth.  At that point, it was so far beyond my control. \n\nThe cops are throwing paperwork into their cars and jumping in as fast as possible. They take off chasing after them, this was the shit they signed up for. Hell this was the stuff I wanna sign up for. There is a moment of faux silence. I can hear the cops respective V8’s making merry with the gearing, and the sudden sound of screeching tires lets me know my car is making the right hand turn it simply won’t make. If he was well trained, and knew where he was going, he might make that corner at 30MPH, and that’s a big might. He is 10MPH overspeed into the corner in a 4,000 pound nope-mobile. The ass of the car swings tail happy, out to the left and then the right. The first two screeches let me know he isn’t about to get away. The third screech seals the letter. The ominous sound of suspension compressing gives me a fraction of a second to think it all worked out and my car was fine. \n\nThe loudest crash I have ever heard from 100 yards away permeates the night.  I hear the sounds of sirens race into the night. I look at the bewildered family standing across the street, having just offloaded from their minivan, and exclaim excitedly. “THEY STOLE MY CAR! THEY WERE DUMB ENOUGH TO COME BACK… AND STEAL MY CAR!” I run inside, excited for some reason.  \nCop 1 jumps out of his car just around the corner from where my car had disappeared into the darkness. He sprints full speed across the front yard and as he is about to cross the first yard, out from between the houses comes the dazed getaway car driver from before, he had stolen the car. The cop said to me 2 hours later as we took the report and I quote. \n&gt;“Well, I was at a full sprint, in the grass. I couldn’t have stopped if I wanted too, I couldn’t have turned, blinked, thought, farted or done anything other than blindside into him at full speed. I hit him so hard my back still hurts.” \n\nThe thief ends up in cuffs, gasping for air against the freezing lawn.\n\nCop 2 chases the black Camaro down the street, onto the next avenue and onto the feeder for the interstate. He gets off at the next exit, turns right onto Lander Ave and races back towards the crime scene. I am standing inside looking out the window. My friends have give me a beer and I hear something coming. I watch the Black Camaro travel down 10th street westbound, BACK into the neighbourhood that started this whole thing and then turn left, down the dead end towards the blackberry bushes. This time I know something he doesn’t, he punches it. Hard. Foot to floor screaming V6. He shot off the end of the road like a Duke’s of Hazard stunt, vaulting the car 7 feet in the air and 40 feet into the thick blackberries. \n\nEight police cars come flooding into the street, another half dozen fill the area. The gunman crawls from the wreckage and through 40 feet of thick blackberries at gunpoint to a waiting set of cuffs. He has crashed less than 100 yards from his friend. You could see the first crash site from the embankment he drove off of. It turns out they had robbed 6 other people since 7AM, after stealing the car from someone at a bar. I was the last of their crime spree and they were high on crime and trying to pay for a PCP habit.\n\n I exhale, at last at ease. I spend the evening with friends and eventually I get called out to the tow truck to go see my car. My baby is sitting 8ft down an embankment, having crashed through a solid wooden fence (nbd), a row boat (nbd), another solid fence (still nbd), and into a parked motorboat (okay kind of a bd). Airbags aren’t deployed, and the car starts fine. After a recovery, the next morning I find out my car isn’t covered for theft and I need to replace the windshield, left mirror, spotlight and every body panel on the left side, under my own expense because my mother would rather save $5/mo rather than have full coverage on my car. I throw my phone *THROUGH* a wall when I find this out. I am also now out a phone. Great.  \n\nIt doesn’t hit me until maybe 4 days later what I did fully. I brought a casserole, beer and tortilla chips to a gunfight and didn’t die. I used my brain, my training and my observational skills to take a bad situation and make it worse to the point it got better. I also get extremely lucky and rolled really high skill checks. (I play a lot of D&amp;D.)  I severed every fingernail on both hands during the scuffle, I left them jagged and uneven, sharp and annoying until I had finally got my concealed carry license. I have thought on the issue long and hard, and came to the realisation I don’t want to kill anyone. I will kill the man threatening my life, but the second he is no longer in that role in my life. I don’t want to kill the gunman that pulled on me, I have no spite, no revenge, no knife to sink. I don’t want to kill the driver of the car that hit me. I don’t want to ruin anyones life, day or train of thought even. But next time, I am not going to be the action hero. I am going to be the coward. And I think I am okay with that. \n\n**TL;DR: Bought a old cop car, dude tries to carjack me, I bring beer and a casserole to a gunfight and didn't die. Got hit by a car and called a crazy person by the guy trying to carjack me.**\n\nEdit: TL;DR and some mistakes. *You get a comma, and YOU get a comma. Everybody gets commas!*",

        "text": "Ok, this may be my last post here. Don't have many more dealings with the police.  It's been fun.\n\nSo, let's travel back in time to my early twenties. After college, and before moving in with my girlfriend, who is now my wife. So I was like 22 or 23. I was a First or second year apprentice. I made shit money. Terrible. The only reason I had a place was because I got a house in a terrible neighbourhood and did all the maintenance on it.  Hell, the lawn cutting would have been $100 a pop it was so big, and shovelling the driveway in the winter took me like two hours at least.  But it was a shitty, shitty neighbourhood in the inner suburbs.\n  \n  So naturally, I spent as much time as possible away from it.  My buddy took me out on a Friday night, and we ended up leaving the bar, getting a pizza, and I crashed on his couch.  I think he needed me the next day for an Ikea run or something. We ended up spending the day together, than coming back to my hood for wings at a bar near my place. After dinner, he buggers off and I walk home.\n\nAnd, after being gone for more than 24 hours, the back door had been kicked in. Fuck me.  The worst part was, I didn't own shit worth stealing.  My computer was like 6 years old, my tv was a CRT, and I didn't even own a DVD player back then because they were still expensive.\n\n  But I had a liquor cabinet, and that's what they hit. I found an empty bottle of 15 year old scotch (gift from aforementioned wealthy friend) on the floor in the spare room I liked to read in.  But no glass. Fucking savages. If you're gonna pilfer a $90 bottle of Glenfiddich. At least use a glass, you damn philistine. Don't chug it out of the bottle like a bottle of Thunderbird!\n\nSo I called the cops, and the landlord. Landlord said he'd have a guy come by first thing in the A.M. to fix the door.  Then sat down and waited for the cops. And waited, and waited. I eventually grabbed a blanket and a baseball bat and slept against the door.  After like 4 hours, the cops finally showed up.  And after all that waiting, who do they send? A 115 pound blonde chick and a 5'4 inch Asian dude who was build more like Leslie Chow than Bolo Yeung. Yeah, I felt safe and reassured.  Since nothing got stolen but booze, they didn't give a shit. Just gave me a piece of paper with some numbers on it for a case number etc.  I needed it for the landlord.  I ended up staying up all night until the landlord's guy came by in the morning to fix the door.  I couldn't sleep with the door not being able to close.  But it gets fixed, and that's the end of that.\n\nThis is where it gets fun. A week later, my buddy had come by with pizza and beer to watch the game.  Halfway through the second period, he gets a phone call from his alarm company, saying something was up at his house and the cops were being dispatched.  We jumped in his car and hauled ass to his place.  He lived in a wealthy suburb of the city farther out of town.  So he dealt with Regional cops, not city like I did.  We got to his house in twenty minutes, and there is already a cruiser sitting in his driveway!  It's parked at a funny angle, looks like it roared in and is sitting on the curb.   We pull in, and a cop gets out of the passenger side. This guy is big.  Like 6'3\", 220. Big solid dude.  He chit chats with my buddy for a second getting the \"who are you?\" questions taken care of.  Buddy eventually gets to ask what's going on.\n\n\"Well, we checked the perimeter of the house, and there's no signs of a break in. No broken windows, do busted doors. We talked to the alarm company, and they said it was an internal alarm.  Do you have pets?\"\n\nMy buddy sheepishly admits that, yeah, he has a pair of cats in the house that have free range of the place.  Maybe the alarm company has to lower the sensitivity of the motion sensors.\n\nCop gives him the biggest \"no-shit, numbnuts\" look.  He's a little ticked that the call was a waste of time. Tells buddy that he will be getting a bill for the false alarm. Buddy has no problem with it. Hell, at least he gets a response, right?\n\n\"Ok, well, we're done here.  My partner is just on the phone, and he needs to sign off on the paperwork after you do.\"\n\n\"No problem officer.\"\n\nThe other cop is in the cruiser. You can see the domelight for where we parked.  Other cop yells at him.\n\n\"Hey Mike, you wanna get off the phone so we can get going?\"\n\nThen Mike gets out of the car.  I look at mike, and immediately lose my mind laughing my ass off.  Buddy gets the \"What in the every loving fuck are you doing?\" look on his face. Cop talking to my buddy doesn't look pleased with me either.\n\nMike, is quite simply, the largest human being I have ever seen with my own eyes.  He was like 6'8\" or something, and over three bills, easy. The reason the Cruiser looked like it was parked funny, was because Mike was so goddamn big the suspension couldn't take his weight.  Picture the incredible hulk wearing body armour and a gunbelt.  If Kevin Nash was a 35 year old cop, this is what he would have looked like.\n\nMike finally get's up to the car, leans in and scowls at me \"is something funny happening that I don't know about?\"\n\nI can barely hold it together at this point I'm laughing so hard. I finally manage to calm down a bit and have to admit that\n\n \"I'm sorry officer. I got robbed last week in (my neighbourhood) I waited 4 hours for the local cops to send out a 115 pound blonde and a Chinese midget. Some rich Italian's cat falls off the couch and they send out the biggest fucking cops I've ever seen, who show up before we do!\"\n\nBuddy corroborates the story, and I get sympathy from the cops. \"You live where?\" and \"you waited how long after you got robbed?\"  They're now chuckling at my reaction to seeing Mike.  His partner, who is definitely a big guy himself, is looking at Mike, and then holding his hand in the air at about shirt pocket height.\n\nHe then chuckles, and says, \"No wonder you started laughing.  You had to wait four hours for what they sent, and he gets Conan the Officer because his cat sets off the alarm.  Have a good one guys.\"",

        "text": "I realize I forgot to tell one story I mentioned, I was looking back at my submissions to this sub, and realized I forgot about it. This is about the time the cops REALLY fucked up in their information.\n\nMy wife and I were sleeping in. You get to do that before you have kids.\n\n  Anyway, as an aside before we get really involved in the story, at the time this happened, my father in law was in the middle of a really bitter divorce. His ex-wife had spun every lie and accusation she could think of. She accused him of domestic violence, took out his guns and put them all over the house, ruined his finances, all before lunch when he was at work.  He moved in with us at the time so my wife could act as his surety, after the small-town redneck cops in his town kicked the shit out of him and arrested him.  But anyway, his ex wife had sent over some divorce documents where she is willing to return some stolen documents (That she has previously denied having) in exchange for the house. So, via her lawyer, she had admitted to theft, and committed extortion. Probably the worst written legal document of all time.  I had actually had to tell my FIL to hold onto those documents. The lawyer, realizing how stupid she was, had come to the house the day before AND ASKED FOR THEM BACK. When I refused, she stated that they were confidential documents between her and her client, and my FIL had no right to possess them (Really? After you mailed them to him? Really dumb lawyer)  This is a key point of the story.\n\nMoving on. My wife and I were sleeping in. Her Father had gone to work.  Then we get this big angry knocking at the door. BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG. Then some asshole just starts LEANING on my doorbell.  (Dude, WTF? I'm up. Even though It's 8 a.m. on a Sunday.)  I throw on some clothes and answer the door. Lo and behold, it's two sizeable members of the local constabulary.  With guns, and tasers and scowls.\n\nAt this point, I'm quite confused. I have no clue what they want.  I open the door, and they lean into me to try and get me to back up. I don't.\n\n\"We want to talk to you.\"\n\n \"Uh-huh. About what?\"\n\n\"Some stolen property.\"\n\nI immediately think about the legal documents from yesterday. I think this crazy lawyer actually called the cops and said we stole something she mailed to us.\n\n\"Do you mean the legal documents? They aren't stolen, she mailed them to us.\"\n\n\"Legal documents? We're talking about what you got last night.\"\n\nLast night? I got a bottle of cheap wine and a crappy movie from Blockbuster. (Long time ago) \"You just lost me. What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"The stolen property. From last night. We know you have it. We talked to your sister.\"\n\nNow I know something is up. My sister lives 400 km away, in a very high position in a Cabinet Minister's office for the Federal Government.\n\n\"Guys, you're looking in the wrong spot. My sister lives in (other city) for the Minister of (Government Department). What the fuck are you talking about.\"\n\nA normal cop would think for three seconds, and maybe try verifying my claim. No, these idiots doubled down, and tried to badmouth my sister?  They fucking push me inside my house. **AND START LOOKING AROUND.**\n\n\"So you're saying your sister works for the Government in the (Department) Ministry? Why are you lying to us? Your sister's a thief. We know. Look, if you just give us the stolen property back, we won't arrest you.\" \n\nSeriously? Who the fuck is dumb enough to fall for that? \"If you give us the evidence, we won't arrest you?  This is where I copped serious attitude. I gotta admit. \n\n\"My sister doesn't work for the (Department) *Ministry*, She works for the (Department) *Minister*. She's the really educated person who tells the idiot Politician what to say.  You guys got the wrong guy. I want you to get the fuck out of my house.\"\n\nOne cop is walking around my house. In his big shitkicker boots on my damn carpet.  The other gets on his phone, and says \"I'm gonna call my C.I. See what he has to say.\"\n\nI'm not gonna touch these idiots, I know they're baiting me to try and push them out of my house. At this point, my wife is coming downstairs in a bathrobe asking what's going on. Even I don't know.  Then I overhear the guy on the phone, and it starts to click.\n\n\"Yeah. We're at the house talking to him right now.  He says he doesn't have it. Yeah, we're at (Address). Wait, what?  No, he's like 5'10\". Big guy. No, He's not bald.\"\n\nThen it clicks. They're looking for my neighbour.  They got the wrong fucking house.  This is gonna be fun.  By now, they've been talking for me for like 15 minutes. I've made coffee they're been here for so long.  Another cruiser is in front of my house, and now an unmarked is pulling up, and a Plainclothes cop is coming up the steps.  That's a lot of cops for some stolen shit. I decide to fuck around.\n\n\"Morning, Detective. Care for a cup of coffee?\"\n\nHe doesn't respond to me, but goes straight over to the cop still illegally searching for whatever the fuck it is that's stolen. Seeing as he's riffed through my wife's purse, I think it's a ladies wallet, or credit cards or something.\n\n\"Why's he so chipper?\"\n\n\"Uh.\"\n\nNow I pipe up with a smile. \"Because you got the wrong house and these numbskulls won't admit it. You want a coffee or no?\"\n\nLong Pause.....\n\nDetective: (To me) \"Sure.\" (To cop number 2) \"Seriously?\"\n\nCop #2: \"I don't know. (Cop #1)'s C.I. told us it was this house.\"\n\nDetective: \"And how long do you have to be a cop before you figure out the difference between lying and not knowing what the fuck you're talking about?\"\n\nAt this point, I smile, and sit down on the couch with a coffee.  \"You know Detective, if Cop #1 is nice to me, I might tell you where the only bald scumbag in the neighbourhood lives. You know, the one who's about 5'7\" and 140 lbs.\"\n\nThen you can see the gears turn in Cop #1's head.  His expression goes from \"I'm gonna intimidate you into confessing\" to \"What?\" to \"Oh shit\" in about five seconds of thinking.\n\nThe best he could come up with was \"What??\" \n\nI stand up. \"Here's what's happened so far. You got a Rat that said he knows a guy with some stolen shit. He gave you an address, and a description.  So you go to the address. The guy who answers the door doesn't match the description by three inches, 100 pounds, and a haircut.  So instead of thinking \"oops, wrong guy\", you push past me, illegally search the house, and just hope to find something to cover up your fuckup, after you insult my sister and call me a liar.  That about right?\"\n\nThe detective is looking at me, waiting patiently with an \"are you fucing kidding me\" look on his face, and then he looks over at the two uniforms. Cop #2 just kinda shrugs, and cop #1 has a deer in headlights look.\n\n\"Instead of just thinking \"oops\", you guys doubled down, and violated a few Charter rights. That was kinda stupid. I mean the smart thing would have been to sit in a car up the street, and wait for a guy who matched the description around here, and see where he goes.  Because you might have seen a guy who is about 5'7\" 140, and bald, with a criminal record. He lives across the street at (House Number). His name is (Name) and he's probably gone now, from the fact that there's now three police cars parked outside on the street.\"\n\nThe detective just looks at the other two guys, and says \"Out. Now.\" Then he turns around and reaches into his coat. He hands me a business card.\n\n\"That's my card. If you wanna make a complaint, bring this.\n\n\"Probably not gonna make a complaint because that was fucking fun.  You don't get to call a cop a dumbass and get away from it very often. Just tear a strip off Cop #1.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah, that's gonna get done regardless.  Then just keep the card, I owe you a favour.\"\n\nStill got the card pinned to a corkboard over my computer.  I heard the detective go up one side of Cop #1 and down the other. Gunnery Sgt. Hartman would have been proud. \n\n  I think I might have another story or two, but not many.  Actually, I just remembered one.  I'll post it later. \n\nLook for [Witness] What are you laughing at?",

        "text": "Please excuse any grammatical errors. I typed this out on mobile and though I tried to edit it, a few probably got through. (I'm also not a great writer)\n\nI'm sorry if this isn't the right sort of story for this sub, I'm more of a lurker but this happened this morning and I think it's important to recognise LEOs doing their best to protect and serve.\n\nA bit of back ground.\n\nI'm a reserve Firefighter and a paid Motorcycle Response Medic. I live in a stunning country but one with more than its fair share of problems. A huge income disparity, rampant crime and high unemployment are just some of the issues we face. The most noticable result of this on first responders is to desensitise us, we become jaded so quickly that it's easy to lose sight of why we serve, while this is in a sense a coping mechanism if left unchecked it becomes an insidious influence. Reducing our ability to effectively and compassionately perform our duties. In addition our national police have have a terrible reputation for being unmotivated and uncaring, sometimes this is true but I've found that many officers are toiling away unrecognised to help the people they signed up to protect.\n\n\nAnyway enough rambling and onto the story. \n\nThis morning I was just about done patrolling my stretch of the freeway, I cover about 40-50km most of which is a dual carriageway with 4 lanes in each direction. Between riding and working the few wrecks I'd found I hadn't been able to take the load off for a few hours and I was really looking forward to a cup of coffee and reddit. My back's been given me trouble too, a lasting reminder of my two close calls last year.\n\nI usually stop at the same service station every morning, a huge affair with upwards of 12 pumps and a coffee shop feeding the masses on their way to and from work. I've become friendly with the manager and usually when he sees me we sit and chat for a while but today was different. The moment he saw me he waved me over.\n\n&gt; CFB thank God,  one of our customers thinks she saw a dead body on the way to the off ramp. I took a walk up and can't see anything but I can't go too far or I'll be on the freeway.\n\n\nAs you would probably expect, dead body calls are unpleasant. Unpleasant and long. It was with the image of my coffee and a cushioned seat fading into the ether that I radioed through to dispatch.\n\n&gt; Control for Motor 1, bystander reports of a query code on *Large Highway* before *Ramp*. I'm heading back up against traffic to check. Updates when I have more.\n\n&gt; Copied Motor 1.\n\n\nPopping my lights on I headed back up the shoulder and onto the freeway. I was riding slowly, keeping a wary eye on the grass of the embankment and the gutter. It's a strange feeling looking for a body, in the years that I've been working I've done it a few times but I don't think I'll ever get used to it.\n\nI passed the 500m mark and stopped, I hadn't seen anything and I was trying to decide whether I should continue against traffic or turn around and head back towards the ramp. Perhaps I'd ridden past it,  and it would be more visible from the other direction. Just as I was about to flip my visor down I noticed a red lump on the grass about 200m from my position.  \"Shit\", I thought, \"That looks like a body.\"\n\nA few seconds later I pulled up next to a huddled figure partially covered by a red blanket. It was only around 09h30 but temps were already pushing through 30° Celcius. Dismounting I reached for the mic on my radio, usual procedure would be to start additional units in my direction while I did a primary survey and figured out what was going on. Playing my finger on the transmit key I paused, was that a breath?She shuddered, groaned and rolled over. \n\nA few seconds later and my heart was slowly returning to some semblance of a normal rhythm and I was no longer in danger of wetting myself. While I had been having my little moment she had shakily pulled herself into a semi-seated position. Casting an eye over her I noticed a few details, the wool knit cap, the multitude of open sores on her arms and shoulders. Dirt caked her arms and legs as she stared at the ground. \n\n&gt; Dispatch Motor 1. Contact made, 1x female transient. Appears confused, possibly malnourished. Standby for further.\n\n&gt; Received\n\nI knew then that I wasn't getting an ambulance, none were available. Usual story for that time of day over here.\n\n\nWhile I was wondering what the hell I was going to do I noticed a car pull up. The doors opened and out climbed two enormous officers. Nodding at me they walked over, hands gripping their bulletproof vests and firearms strapped to their thighs. \n\n&gt; What's up? Saw your lights.\n\nI filled them in on what I knew, expecting them to head back to their car and back on patrol. Considering our violent crime rate I wouldn't have blamed them. They have more important things to do.\n\nI admit to being shocked when, without missing a beat one officer knelt besides her, firmly but gently trying to talk to her. The other was talking into his radio, he came over to me...\n\n&gt; Victim support services can help. They have an office at our station and can find her a place of safety, get her cleaned up and fed. Only problem is the lady in charge is in a meeting so we're going to be waiting for a while until they get going.\n\nI nodded, it was boiling hot by now and my uniform was doing its best to turn into an oven. \n\nI looked at her, realising that she wouldn't appreciate a stranger poking and prodding her right now.\n\n&gt; I don't want to assess her while she's so skittish, might just upset her enough to ruin any chance we have, she looks hungry. Let me try find some food and water for her.\n\nThe officer I was talking to nodded and agreed to stay with her while I was gone.\n\nI climbed back  onto my bike and headed into the service station. A quick word with the manager and I was back with a loaf of wholewheat bread and a bottle of water. I placed them in front of her and backed away. She tore into that bread, I would find out later her last meal had been a handful of potato crisps the day before.\n\nA while after she'd eaten half the loaf I decided to try talk to her, by this point a bunch more police cars had arrived, including a ranking officer. She was more receptive to my questions and I managed to get permission to check a few vital signs. Luckily nothing was hugely out of the ordinary although her blood sugar was a little high, presumably from the bread she'd been wolfing down.\n\nI walked over to where the officers were standing, explained to them that medically she wasn't in such a state that would require hospitalisation. They agreed with me that taking her to a state medical facility would tie up resources and she'd end up back on the street before sundown. \n\nIt was then that I realised what caliber of men these were. They asked if I was done checking her over, to which I replied that I was. Within a few moments they had lifted this dirty, wretched little old lady to her feet and helped her to their vehicle. This wasn't a transport car,  it had no rubberised seats and they no gloves but they didn't flinch. \n\n&gt; She'll be more comfortable at the station, we can wait with her there for VSS. I'll explain to the social workers what we know and make sure they find her a better place to spend the weekend. Next week they'll be able to help more completely.\n\nAs they pulled away I was reminded of the story about the man throwing stranded starfish back into the water. You'll never save everyone, but to those you can it will mean the world.\n\nI don't know if she'll be okay, perhaps it's too late for her. The life of a street person, of drink, drugs and poverty is not an easy one to leave and maybe she'll be back on the streets soon. But thanks to those officers she'll have a chance. \n\n",

(I've since been informed other GABA receptor antagonists can have similar effects, but it's mostly booze and benzos that I've seen in the field.)\n\nProperly treated and in a round the clock facility safeish detox is possible. But what you are usually used to finding is some poor bastard seizing in a gutter crying out in pain, voiding his bowls, and screaming his joints are on fire.\n\nWell, in one of my early days, I got one of these, but it was anything but the normal rounds. The guy was living in a $5mil house with a personal boat ramp to the private yacht, that was impossible to get in to. I won't even speculate the price for all of that combo.\nWe found him in half rigor hugged around a small bathroom toilet, and had to try and forcefully drag him out. His friends said he was taking a few days off to get clean after a bad breakup, but for alcohol and benzos to get that bad it was more than a dalliance.\nThe only thing I could keep thinking about as I walked around this mansion was that \"If I had this much money, I could be happy for life.\" It was a rude awakening when that high roller money train ended up with his unwashed hairy head collapsed half in the toilet, naked from the waist up, orange puke up the wall, and with shit seeping through your flannel underwear on to what I could only assume was really expensive amazonian hardwood.\nHe didn't make it. Acute DTs complicated by chronic diazepam abuse.\n\nSometimes it's the street junkie, sometimes it's the guy you see at the town hall meeting every month.\n",

        "text": "A couple of nights ago, last Thursday to be exact, I decided that I should try to get into shape. Yes, round is a shape, but not a shape I wish to be. I talked a couple of friends into going to a Planet Fitness not far from where we had been hanging out. Mind you, we just got done bowling in a league, so it's around 11:30 pm. \n\nWe get done pumping iron and running our brains out at about 1:30 in the morning. What's the first thing five young guys think of after working out? Food. It's 1:30 am and not much is open right now. I throw out the idea of IHOP, mainly because I really want some pancakes. I mean, who doesn't love pancakes!?! The only way to get to the IHOP, however, is through a not-so-good area. \n\nThe five of us decide that it's easier to take two car, three people in one and two in the other, rather than all squeeze into one. And since I'm the only other one in the group who has a licence and a car, I take one of my friends, no big deal. As we drive to the IHOP, we pass through the not-so-good area, which has a speed limit of 25 MPH. Law abiding me does just that. We continue though the area and arrive at a bridge at the end of the main road we are on. After merging onto the bridge, it's about a quarter mile until the end. The bridge is straight and rather flat, so I decided that the 25 MPH speed limit is too slow for me, so I do roughly 40.\n\nI arrive at the end of the bridge and am met with a friendly green light, which allows me to make my left turn. Whilst making the left, I see some headlights nearing my rear view mirror and a fairly rapid speed. They were the unmistakable headlight of a Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor. Uh oh, looks like the locals are gonna nab me for speeding. \n\nWe make the turn and sure enough, the police cruiser turns the area into a dance floor, flashing red and blue. Thus is the end of my driving forever. Mom, dad, I'm sorry I shamed you!!! \n\nI swiftly, and safely pull to the right and, and take a deep sigh. I look to my friend B in the passenger seat and already knowing the answer, ask, \"You have it with you, don't you?\" \n\nB replies, \"As always, but don't worry, it'll go smoothly.\" \n\nThe officer approaches my window and I can already feel his judging gaze as I slowly crank my manual windows down, grunting every now and the  from having just worked out. \n \n\"Morning Officer,\" I greet the lawman, in hopes some lighthearted humour will loosen some of the tension I'm the air. \n\n\"What are you guys up to this late at night?\" asked the Officer who was clad in his Kevlar vest lined with AR-15 magazines and a teaser. \n\n\"Just heading to IHOP after the gym to get some nutrition, sir.\" I reply. While waiting for his retort, I hear my plate information come over the radio. \n\n\"Are you the owner of the car,\" asked the officer, \"and do you have a valid license?\" \n\n\"I am not the owner of the car, but I did purchase it. And yes, I do have a license.\" I said. \n\nI hand him my license and he quickly glances at it before looking back at myself. \n\n\"Do either of you have any weapons in the car I should know about?\" inquires the policeman. \n\nI look at B and sigh, \"He has a gun with all the licenses and permits, and I have a pocket knife in my pocket.\" \n\nThe officer leans into the car and looks at B. \n\n\"It's in a holster in my waistband and my permit is in my wallet if you want to see it, sir\" states B. \n\nThe officer stands back up and completely changed his demeanor, which caught both B and I off guard. \n\n\"So what gym are you coming from?\" asked the cop. \n\n\"Uh, Planet Fitness, sir.\" I stammer, still not understanding where the sudden change in mood came from. \n\nThe officer looks at myself and B, \"You guys need to get a real fuckin' gym,\" he says with a chuckle. \n\nB and I are nervously laughing when he returns my license and explains why he stopped us. \n\n\"I saw a couple of white guys driving though here, an area known for drugs, and it seemed kind of out of place,\" said the copper, \"I figured I'd stop and see what was up!\" \n\nPuzzled, I ask, \"Did I do anything wrong?\" \n\n\"You were speeding a bit, but I don't usually run traffic, so I don't really care.\" chuckled the officer. \n\n\"So I'm not getting a ticket? \" I nervously ask. \n\n\" Fuck no! \" exclaimed the policeman,\" It's too late for me to be doing that, plus you guys made me laugh and we're very friendly and cooperative! Be safe tonight guys!\" \n\nAs he walked back to his patrol car, B and I looked at each other completely dumbfounded at how he didn't care about the weapons at all, or my speeding. \n\nNeedless to say, the officer was one of the friendliest I've ever met, and trusted us more than I feel any other would have. He didn't really even give a verbal warning! I really wish I would've caught his name so I could be called his station and complimented him on how friendly and polite he was! \n\n\nHi /r/TalesFromTheSquadCar! This is my second post here and I really hope you guys enjoyed it! Sorry if the formatting sucks, I typed the entire thing on mobile. And sorry if it isn't the smoothest read or that we'll written, I'm not much good at this kind of stuff. But anyways, I hope you guys enjoyed my little tale from the suspect car!",

As I went over the crest of the hill Holes in the Floor of Heaven started playing. My Mom passed away in January and this stupid song always make me cry. At this point I felt like I had control over my anxiety but this time it hit me hard. I pulled over trying to get a hold of myself.\n\nI didn't notice the sheriff's deputy that was behind me. When I pulled over he turned on his lights and behind me. Once I saw the lights I wiped away my tears thinking \"Fucking shit. I can't let him see me crying like this.\" I got my insurance out and waited for him to come to my window. Only it wasn't a male deputy. It was a woman.\n\nShe asked me \"Sir is everything alright? I saw you pull over in a hurry and just wanted to check on you.\" She shines her flashlight on me and around my car.\n\nI sniffled trying to get the snot back in my nose. \"Yes ma'am. I just heard a song on the radio and it made me lose it so I wanted to pull over. I'm sorry for this I'll be on my way.\"\n\nShe gave me a puzzled look and asked \"What song was it?\"\n\n\"Holes in the floor of Heaven.\"\n\n\"If you don't mind me asking, who passed away?\"\n\nI was pulled back by this. I told her that it was my mom and how I thought I was over it.\n\nShe looked me in the eyes and said \"I lost my dad a few years ago. We may feel like we are over the hurdles of grief, but sometimes one comes back up that we can't see coming. It's ok though. These moments are reminders of how much we loved them.\"\n\nAfter that she asked if I needed something to wipe my eyes with. I told her no. I stash napkins like a squirrel with nuts because of my allergies. She laughed and told me that she would wait behind me until I was ready to go. I thanked her and once she was back in her squad car I drive away.",

        "text": "I guess you could say that this really was a \"suspect\" call.\n\nAt the time of this story, I was 19 years old and home alone house-sitting in my quiet suburban neighborhood, with my parents halfway across the state. With that being said, it's Friday night, the house is quiet, and I am in my pajamas having just finished a long evening of culinary debauchery. The trash bin is overflowing, and the smell of Chinese takeout wafts through the house, lending an \"odeur\" most pungent. \n\nI sighed, glancing at the clock: 1:40 AM. Too late to consider going out. More than late enough for me to be tired, and ready for bed. I consider leaving the trash until morning, but as another wave of MSG-Garlic washes over me, I know this isn't an option. The trash has to go out now, or I'll have to spend the whole day at home airing out the house tomorrow before my parents arrive.\n\nI trudge into the kitchen, and tie the bag up before hefting it out of the bin and stepping out the side door to the trash bins. With a grimace, I determine that the bag is leaking slightly, onto my bare feet. Ugh.\n\n\nI fail to notice the door swinging shut behind me, until I hear the one sound I did *not* want to hear at a quarter to 2 in the morning: the click of the door latching.\n\n\n*No way...* \n\n\nI toss the trashbag into the barrel, and return to the side door, hopefully twisting the handle. No luck - locked. \n\n\n*Of COURSE I locked it behind me.*\n\n\nI gingerly trod across the gravel as I slip out into my front yard, triggering the automatic lights. Recalling my latching the deadbolt after the Chinese food was delivered, I cast a prayer to the gods of poor security and begin scrounging under flowerpots, hoping that my mother still has a house-key stashed somewhere. Of course, this is not the case -- there had been a string of burglaries in the past few weeks and the neighborhood watch had advised against this very such thing. Mother clearly took this advice to heart.\n\n\n*What a freaking mess*.\n\n\nI glared at the offending home, and wandered onto the other side yard. Then, I saw it - salvation. The small ladder I had left on the side of the house last week after hanging new flower planters. If I could climb on top of it, I could just barely hoist myself onto the roof and drop down into the atrium in the center of the house! The atrium which was currently unlocked, a breeze entering the house with only a screen door open providing a barrier against the mosquitoes. \n\nThere was just one problem: the ladder was four feet too short, and the gravel it was quite unstable. My first attempt lead to some sketchy shifting, and my second attempt resulted in me quite nearly falling off the ladder entirely. \n\n\nCould I ask someone to help me hold it? I considered knocking on my neighbor's door, but recalling that she was both elderly and quite deaf, realized that was likely not an option. I would call a friend, but my cellphone was inside.\n\n\nWell, just one thing to do then. I scowled, and began the three block walk - barefoot - to the small sheriff's station in the adjacent shopping center.\n\n\nFifteen minutes and one very skeptical sounding dispatch later, I sat on the curb watching the sheriff pull up the shopping center. He rolled down the window, and looked at me with barely concealed amusement. \n\n\n\"So just to be clear,\" he stated, \"you want me to hold the ladder while you climb onto your roof and jump into the atrium of your house?\"\n\nI nodded, blushing as I realized how thoroughly ridiculous this whole ordeal was. Here I sat in fuzzy pajamas and barefoot, with my hair in a white-girl topknot, forlornly asking a sheriff for assistance breaking into (ostensibly) my own home.\n\n\"Are you *sure* the atrium is unlocked?\"\n\nI nodded again. He gave me a nod, barely hiding a smirk, and let me ride the few blocks back to my house with him. We arrived, and I showed him to the sideyard where my ladder leaned against the garage wall. \n\n\n\"Are you sure you don't want me to do this?\" he asked again.\n\n\n\"No, it's fine. My house is kindof a mess right now anyways... I can bring you my ID once I'm inside so you know I'm not some horribly stupid burglar,\" I said, remembering the laundry I had stacked on the table right next to atrium. I had no inclination of letting him see my colorful assortment of thongs and mismatched socks.\n\n\nHe sighed, and nodded. \"Alright, but be careful. I don't want you to hurt yourself jumping down inside.\"\n\n\nI smiled wanly. \"I won't, there's a ladder inside the atrium. Sometimes I tan on the roof.\"\n\n\nHe shifted uncomfortably and gestured toward the ladder. \"Right, well then, uh...\"\n\n\nI nodded, and began the climb. With someone holding it rather than simply leaning against the garage, it was an easy climb and I soon was tiptoeing across my roof before dropping into the atrium. I opened the sliding screen door, and grabbed my wallet from my purse before popping over to the front door.\n\n\n\"Here you go,\" I said, passing him my state ID. He glanced at it, noting the address was the same as this house, before passing it back to me.\n\n\n\"Do you want a soda or something?\" \n\n\n\"No,\" he said, turning for the car. \"Thanks though... I've got a coffee.\"\n\n\nHe almost made it to the car before I heard the chuckle escape him.  \n\n\n\n",

        "text": "There's transports and then there's THE transport as it's came to be known. \n\nAt my prison transporting prisoners to the hospital to waste tax payers money is a routine occurrence. \"My chest hurts\" equals a guaranteed trip to the hospital, usually via ambulance, to stare at the nurses and be treated like a good boy that made bad decisions while the CO's are treated like Prison Guards that get off on beating poor innocent criminals. \n\nSo when my sergeant call's me over the radio, \"COseg, you're going on a run. Come to the armory.\" I'm not entirely surprised but this is my first run so I'm a little nervous. I get to the armory with my transporting car and he tells me that the inmate \"claims\" to have been throwing up blood. \n\nThe word Claims is important to this story. See, to me claims means nobody else has seen it and it's most likely bull. The inmate probably just wants to go on a transport to get out of the prison. After I get my equipment I ask who I'll be transporting with and I'm told \"David\".\n\nAwesome I thought David is cool, is in super good shape, and smart so we won't look like crap bags out in public. But who show's up? Not David, instead it's Ted. Ted is the exact opposite of David, he looks like he belongs to the guys from \"The Hills Have Eyes\" he's in awful shape and is the one co-worker that can piss me off quicker than any other. \n\nSo more than a little depressed Ted and myself start transporting the inmate towards the hospital. No more than a mile from the prison I hear vomiting from the back seat. It was at this moment that I made the worse decision possible, I looked back to see what was happening. \n\nThere sits the inmate vomiting blood all over the back seat. Less than a foot from my head and with only a cage in between us. I don't mean vomiting like a cat with a hairball. I mean sorority girl after two six packs of wine coolers. Complete projectile vomit all over the back seat. [Exorcist style.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QjrBjdb2T8)\n\nThey had given the inmate a bag to vomit in...but TED had shackled him so tightly to his stomach he couldn't actually get the bag to his mouth so instead it was going all over the floorboard and the back seat. I could hear it splashing off the divider like a water hose had been opened. It was the singularly most disgusting thing I had experienced. \n\nWe eventually got him to the hospital, he didn't die on our watch. The moral of the story? I don't even know.  \n   ",

        "text": "Sorry it's been a while. I had the third part of the Chino/Shahad story 90% completed when I had a laptop SNAFU. I'm still trying to recover what I had written versus starting over again. Here's another one that I had fleshed out to hold you over until I get things squared away. - &lt;3 EMR\n\n______________________\n\n“Everyone has their areas,” Sarge flipped through the clipboard that held the daily blotter to be read through during roll call, “and we have our special assignments covered. I think that’s it.” He looked up as we began to shift in our seats, knowing we were about to be released, and gave a sly grin. “Almost forgot. Everyone, congratulate Ned. As of today, he’s officially pulled the pin.”\n\nWe all looked back to Ned, positioned in the back of roll call in his customary seat in the corner – a spot reserved for the saltier members of our squad, of whom Ned was definitely the saltiest. He gave a Miss America wave complete with goofy grin and we all returned a golf clap. “You all better watch out. I’ve definitely pulled the pin.” \n\nI’m not sure the term is used with frequency in other parts, but “pulling the pin” on my department means a guy had met the length necessary in his employment to retire at full merit. In my case, it’s a soft twenty five years (leave accrual varies and counts towards your tenure). When you “pull the pin,” it’s as if you’re holding onto an armed hand grenade. You know you can leave at a moment’s notice with little repercussion and are able to strut around the brass, tempting them to be the one to finally push you over the edge and toss your grenade in their direction. \n\nNed, having led a rather tumultuous career, had a particular dislike for the higher ranking officers in the department. If a boss hadn’t screwed him over from some assignment or by denying him a promotion or merit raise over the years, they were too green to be in a position where they held authority over him. He was great to have around as a younger cop because he didn’t care what people would think of the sometimes rash things he would spout off about – usually things we all thought, but didn’t have the cajones to say.  \n\n“Before you blow away your career, just promise me you’ll make sure you’ve got a good reason, ok?” Sarge pleaded. \n\n“Bah! Of course. Who’ll be here to show these green sons of bitches the ropes if I just up and bailed on you guys, huh?” \n\n“With that: go relieve the midnight guys!” Sarge rolled his chair back and everyone else stood and stretched their backs, made small talk, or gathered around Ned offering congratulations. \n\nThe day went by uneventfully. I had been assigned to the area nearest the station – a terrible byproduct of the threats made against my life for being aggressive with the gangs and drug dealers in the barrio – and had suffered the consequences for it. I was down a few walk-in domestic disputes, some lost passport reports, a returned runaway and the pièce de résistance : a “suspicious event” involving threats made against the president by an obviously schizophrenic old lady. \n\nI had tucked my cruiser in behind a quiet church and had all the various forms I would need for my reports spread out across my lap and the passenger seat. Right after a long draw of Diet Coke from my Big Gulp, my computer made a quick ping followed immediately by the dispatcher piping up on the radio. I was about to be sent to another call. \n\n“6-Bravo-40, start for a missing person report. Caller says his daughter took off running from his vehicle. She’s a twenty three year old female white, known drug user. Caller states she is probably en route to the city to purchase more drugs. 1540 hours.”\n\nI stared at the clock on my car radio in disbelief. 1540. Evening shift roll call had started two hours ago and still I was being sent to this can of worms. I reluctantly shifted my paperwork off my lap and into a not so neat pile on the passenger seat and began my trip to the caller’s location.\n\n“Sorry to bug you.” The balding, middle aged man in the Members Only jacket approached me in the parking lot of the shopping center where his daughter had bailed on him. As I was shutting the cruiser door behind me he added, “I know Stacey’s an adult but I don’t feel good unless I make a record of it somewhere, y’know?”\n\nI pulled out my notebook and began with the questions. “So she’s done this before?”\n\n“Yeah. It seems like once a week now.”\n\n“When was the last time she fled?” \n\n“About…” He thought on it a moment, “six days ago? She just showed up this morning and I was trying to get her to rehab. We stopped here to get cigarettes and she just took off running.” \n\n“Did she say where she went last time?” \n\n“No, but I assume it was somewhere to get dope. I think she’s high right now. I know she does a lot of cocaine but think maybe she moved on to heroin recently. She’s generally more open with her mom.”\n\nI scratched away his answers in my notebook and sighed. Usually, missing adults weren’t a big deal – they’re adults after all. With this case though, I felt Sarge might need a quick update before I just took off to write yet another report. I dialed him up and he answered on the second ring. \n\n“Where is all your paper?” \n\n“On my passenger seat. More importantly, where is evenings and why am I stuck here with this missing adult report?” \n\nHe sighed into the receiver and I could picture him unhinging his jaw in annoyance. “No one has relived you? I told Lt Smith in the hallway you had a lot to do and to send one of his guys.”\n\n“Nope, still flying this one solo!” I glanced at the reporting party who was pacing the parking lot. \n\n“I’ll get someone there. Anything else?”\n\n“Well, yeah. This thing seems like it’s pretty routine but I wanted to bounce it off you before I cleared. She’s an adult, but also a drug addict. Dad here thinks she high right now on coke or heroin. She probably took off for a bus to the city to score some more.”\n\nAnother sigh of annoyance. “Well, put a lookout for her over the air and once an evening unit arrives, make them take the paper. The run sheet says you’re down seven and I want to get out of here on time.”\n\n“10-4 sergeant sir!” I gave a mock verbal salute over the phone and he hung up on me. \n\n“Ok, sir? I’m going to need a little more information on Stacey and then we’ll be done here.”  I walked back over to the dad and flipped to a new page – easier to rip out a clean one to hand off to my relief than try and copy the vitals onto a new sheet later. \n\nI took down her height, weight, hair, eyes, tattoos, clothing description and the direction she had taken off in. I then proceeded to interrupt radio traffic long enough to get out the gist of it as well as ask for an ETA for my relief. \n\n“10-4 on lookout, 6-Bravo-40, and 4-Charlie-30 is en route to you.”\n\nI smiled and gave silent thanks to the paperwork Gods. Then the radio piped back to life.\n\n“Commander12, I’m direct on the lookout, start K9 and helicopter.” The wind left my sails. I scrambled for my phone and began dialing but midway through a call came in. It was Sarge, the target of my scramble a moment before.\n\n“What the hell?” He muttered when I answered. \n\n“Dude! I don’t know. Why did the commander pipe up?” \n\n“I guess he’s bored? Dammit! I’m not even half way done with our paperwork and now I’ve got to come handle this.”\n\n“Why? Sounds like the commander is handling it.”\n\n“Yeah, but you don’t know this SOB like I do. I know if I don’t show up he’ll bring it up in the next supervisor meeting.” He sighed once more, apparently his favored exclamation of the afternoon, and continued. “I’m coming. Let me know if Lt Smith or one of his evening guys beats me there.”\n\nI closed my phone and turned once more to the dad. He smiled back at me. “We all set?” He asked.\n\n“Not really, no. Apparently the supervisors are very concerned over this one. They’re on their way now.”\n\nHe looked confused. “Why?”\n\nI was at a loss for words. “It’s… looked upon as a very… serious matter?” \n\n“Usually when she runs it’s just a report. I don’t need you all wasting your time here. She’s a grown woman; she can make her own decisions.” \n\n“Oh, absolutely – you’re correct. It’s just… the station commander decided this is a high risk situation I guess.”\n\n“Well, I’m sorry for tying you up.” He looked like he meant it. \n\nSoon the cavalry arrived. The first to lead the charge was Sarge. He motioned me to his cruiser. “Does she have a cell phone? Friends in the area?”\n\n“No and no. They were just passing through to go to rehab. They live on the other side of the county.”\n\n“Crap.” \n\nThe helicopter circled overhead and chimed up on the radio. “Air one in the area, who’s our ground contact?”\n\nThe dispatcher answered. “Air one, ground contact is 6-Bravo-40. Time lapse now is about forty five minutes.”\n\n“Air one, 10-4, we’ll be looking.”\n\n“You’re the ground contact?” Sarge asked incredulously. \n\n“I guess: there’s no one else here yet.” He looked around the parking lot in disbelief. \n\n“How? I came from the damn station myself! How’d I beat evenings?” \n\nI just shrugged. \n\n“Is that helicopter for us?” The dad asked, walking over to Sarge’s cruiser as well. \n\n“Yes sir, we’re doing everything we can to find your daughter. Rest assured: she’ll be ok.” Sarge donned his official ‘talking to the public’ voice. \n\n“Oh, this is too much. I just wanted to make a report.” The man watched the helo circle with a look of angst.\n\nAnother cruiser pulled up – an unmarked Impala, glistening clean and dark tinted windows. The commander had arrived. He stepped out of his car as Sarge did the same. \n\n“Sargeant McAllister,” He shook Sarge’s hand then turned to me. “EMR. I was just heading home when I heard this. Everything going ok?”\n\nIt took me a minute to realize I was supposed to answer. “Oh, uh, yeah. Yes, everything is… good.” I looked to Sarge who took the opportunity to roll his eyes.\n\n“I would’ve thought we’d have more troops down here. Where is everybody?” The commander looked around the almost vacant lot. \n\nI started to pipe up, thinking I might try a Ned impersonation and call out the lazy good-for-nothing evening shift for leaving me hanging but Sarge butted in. “It’s just us, commander. The missing person is an adult after all.” \n\nThe commander was still looking around for more people to boss around. “True, but she’s a drug addict and high. She’s a danger to herself and the community.” He didn’t say it to either of us in particular but more as a statement of fact with which we were not supposed to argue. \n\nSarge nodded along but his expression screamed “THIS IS BULLSHIT!”\n\n“Sir. Is this your daughter we’re looking for?” Commander called out to the dad. \n\n“Yes, Stacey is my daughter. But you guys can call all this off. I just wanted to report it, not put you through any trouble.”\n\n“Nonsense! That’s what we’re here for. To serve and protect.” It seemed like the commander was running for office or something. If there had been a baby there, he’d have snatched it from its mother’s arms and covered it in some PR approved kisses. \n\nFinally the first evening unit arrived and I almost sprinted to the car to hand off my notes like a baton in a relay race. The window rolled down and I was not happy with what was behind door number one. Roy, all smiles and eagerness beamed at me. “Where do you need me?”\n\n“Here. You stay here. This mess is your mess now.” I handed him the notes and his face convulsed into an expression of shock. \n\n“I was just told to come help. This isn’t my area.”\n\n“Yeah, well I’m down seven and it’s after four o’clock. Here you go!” The note page floated slowly through Roy’s window and onto his lap. \n\n“Where’s everyone else?” Roy called as I walked away. \n\n“You’re it!” I yelled back. Sarge nodded to me as we made eye contact, recognizing my attempt to escape and approving of it.\n\n“EMR!”\n\nI froze. The commander had called to me. Slowly I turned to see what he needed, hoping for a miracle and that he would happily wave me away.\n\n“Go ahead and ask for more units, have daywork clear the station and start this way so we can coordinate a grid search.”\n\nI nodded back and cursed under my breath. All my buddies would soon be doing the same in my direction, albeit in a much louder fashion. Sarge put his palm over his face.\n\n“6-Bravo-40, could you have the daywork units clear the station and start my way? We need to start a search.”\n\n“10-4 6-Bravo-40. All daywork units, start for 6-Bravo-40’s location, Elm and Main, to begin a search.” If I had been one of them, I’d be cursing me too. Less than an hour to quitting time and a whole squad was being held over to locate a missing adult whose own father didn’t want any effort to go into locating her. I couldn’t do anything but wait and prepare myself for the dirty looks that were about to be cast in my direction. \n\nFifteen minutes later and my whole squad as well as two other evening units and a K9 handler had arrived. Sarge called an impromptu powwow for his guys and I joined in, dodging a couple angry jabs of elbows. \n\n“Guys.” He began in a hushed tone, “This is all on the commander, not EMR, promise. I saw the whole thing.” There were sighs heard around the circle but some reluctant ‘I’m sorry’ glances towards me as well.\n\n“Here’s the deal. We put on a show for the commander, and then we split. We’ll knock out our paper tomorrow. Deal?”\n\nA few guys muttered in the affirmative but Ned threw his hand in the air as though he was a six year old math prodigy in a calculus class. \n\n“Ned?”\n\n“I need to roll now. My daughter is in the state finals for basketball and her mom is working late.”\n\n“Ok, see you tomorrow.” Sarge turned back to us. “Just double up in cars and we’ll start combing the area.” We began to break up as Ned pulled out of the lot.\n\n“Where’s Ned going?” The commander asked Sarge.\n\n“He’s got a thing with his daughter.” Sarge replied.\n\n“No. Tell him to come back.”\n\nSarge looked like he had been slapped. “What? Call him back?”\n\n“You heard me. Call him back. We need all the help we can get on this one.” I was wondering if the commander had confused this missing adult case with the battle of Normandy somehow.\n\nSage reluctantly pulled his mic from his shoulder and switched to the operational channel. “Ned. Could you roll back here real quick?” \n\n“Really? Ok.” An annoyed Ned replied.\n\nHe pulled in a moment later and a group of us stood at just the right distance to avoid the frag damage from the explosion we were about to witness. \n\n“What’s up?” Ned asked Sarge who was standing as close to the commander as he could. He wasn’t Nostradamus, but he had an idea of what was about to go down. Sarge shrugged a bit and looked to the commander, deferring the bearing of bad news to the one who made the call.\n\n“You need to stay. Help find this woman.” The commander said in a lofty tone. \n\n“No, I need to go home and drive my little girl to the state final.” Ned replied in a not yet angry tone.\n\n“No. I’m your commander. You need to stay and find this woman.” The commander got a little louder now, drawing the attention of the woman’s father who had been shaking his head at the dog and pony show that had somehow manifested around him. \n\n“Whoa! No, it’s ok, really. If you have people that need to do something else, anything else, feel free. I don’t want to tie you all up. It was never my intention. Stacey will turn up. She always does.” He waved his hands to add emphasis and tried to shoo Ned away.\n\nNed took a few steps back towards his cruiser but was stopped. “Ned!” The commander yelled. “You’re staying. That’s an order.”\n\nNed’s back arched and his fists clenched towards his chest. He looked as though he was about to go super saiyan. \n\n“Holy shit.” Biggs muttered next to me. Devon began a nervous chuckle. \n\nSlowly, Ned turned to face the commander. He rolled his head on his neck, a la Bruce Lee, and sneered back at the commander. \n\n“Are you doing this as punishment for something?” Ned growled.\n\n“No. This is your duty. I don’t care if you have twenty five years on or twenty five days, an order is an order.” The commander sounded confident but clearly was a bit unsettled by the rancor emanating off Ned’s person like gamma radiation. He took a half step away and broke eye contact. Ned spat on the ground and walked away from his car. \n\nSarge and the commander looked at each other once Ned had stopped shooting eye laser beams in their direction. “Good,” the commander said. “Let’s get started.” He pulled out a map and began circling areas, divvying up assignments to our groups of two. One of the K9 handlers pulled him aside and talked things over with the girl’s dad. Then the commander was side tracked by the evening supervisor, asking him several questions he would have known the answer to had he been there on time. A few minutes passed and we were summarily dismissed to out assignments.\n\n“Uh guys?” Roy called back to the crowd of officers. “Who has my cruiser?” Sure enough, Roy’s car was missing. We glanced around, thinking someone had pulled off a decent prank, but didn’t see it anywhere. \n\n“And where’s Ned?” The commander asked. \n\nBefore we could find him, we heard a car horn blaring from the travel lanes of the road in front of us. A white Ford Bronco – a twin to OJ Simpson’s infamous ride – crested the hill. The daywork guys all recognized it immediately as Ned’s personal car. The covert chuckles began soon after. \n\nNed leaned on his horn again as he approached, stopping at a red light some twenty yards away and smashing the wheel to the beat of “Shave and a Haircut.”\n\n“He did it.” Sarge whispered, awe struck. “He tossed the grenade.”\n\nThe light turned green and Ned’s Bronco revved up. The commander, still confused, tried to figure out who the lunatic driver was. I noticed Devon to my left, back straight and right hand cocked to his brow in full salute. It felt natural to copy the gesture. Soon, everyone but the small contingent of evenings officers and the commander was standing in silent reverence, full military salutes on display. \n\nNed’s driver’s window rolled down. His left arm shot out with a raised fist. The commander realized what was happening and began yelling. “Hey! HEY! NED YOU GET BACK HERE NOW!”\n\nNed’s middle finger rose. His Bronco turned a corner, in the direction of the setting sun. Nick whistled taps. We never saw that glorious bastard again.\n",

        "text": "It was slow for a Saturday night, and the other gas station automaton and I weren't bothering to pretend to do any work yet. Friday and Saturday nights were considered busy enough to warrant having another clerk in for a few hours to do all the cleaning, but the time allotted to do the cleaning was far more than was actually needed.\n\nAn officer, Thumper, was sitting on one of the counters out of sight of a camera, kicking his legs like a little kid (he jumped down any time a customer came in, and you couldn't see him from the door). Thumper had taken over the zone our gas station was in after Turbo moved to days, and it had taken a few months to adapt. He was the complete opposite of Turbo, almost seeming like a huge stick in the mud at first. Luckily, it just took a while to figure out his sense of humor, and get him to open up a little.\n\nThe town, city, whatever you want to call it, isn't large. It takes 10-20 minutes to get through it, end to end. The zones the police cover, then, are right next to each other, and it's real easy to hop into someone else's zone and not worry about it. As such, it wasn't uncommon for Oz, the officer from a zone over, to appear in the gas station when Thumper was around. I think the two started around the same time, and had become pretty good friends working together, often arranging times to meet up at our gas station. Oz was a sort of mix between Turbo and Thumper, and also really cool and fun to hang out with.\n\nThis is how it came to be that the other register monkey and I were trying to convince Thumper to screw with Oz. Now, he refused to call something fake over the radio, something I completely understand. However, each officer had department issued nextell's, and he agreed to a bit of fun.\n\nThe nextell chirped. “Oz! Oz!”\n\n“What's up?”\n\n“You doing anything?”\n\n“Driving around. What's up?”\n\n“I need some help over here.”\n\n“Where are you at?”\n\n“4th street. Wow! That thing is huge!”\n\n“What's going on? Where on 4th?”\n\n“Up near the gas station! Hurry!”\n\n“On my way! What's going on?”\n\n“Holy hell, that thing's big! It's heading towards me.”\n\n“What the fuck is going on? Do I need to run sirens?!”\n\n“Dude, there's a dinosaur walking down the road. It's huge!”\n\nAt this point, there was several seconds of silence. Finally, the nextell chirped. “What?”\n“A dinosaur. Like, a T-rex. It's marching right up 4th street.”\n\n“Right.”\n\nAfter that, no matter how much Thumper tried, describing the dinosaur, telling him it was coming right for him, all that good stuff, Oz refused to respond.\n\nAbout a minute later, Oz came marching into the gas station, confusion and exasperation covering his face, announcing himself as he opened the door with a “What the hell are you all smoking?” None of us could respond, our laughter precluding any sort of response. It took a solid 2 minutes before we could really respond, as he wouldn't shut up about how confused he had been and it just fueled our laughter.",

        "text": "My phone slid along the chipped blue speckled counter, coming to a rest under the lottery machine. A car had just pulled up outside the gas station, and management was harping on us about customers not seeing our phones at all.\n\nThree guys, maybe 18 years old each, came into the store and immediately, silently split up, ignoring my standard greeting. I didn't recognize any of them, which wasn't too unusual, but their behavior was making the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. The half-circle register island sat centrally located on the wall opposite the entrance to the gas station. One of the men was loitering, looking at a stand of snacks directly in front of my register, glancing around.\n\nThe other two had gone in opposite directions, but seemed to be more interested in looking around around the store for other people rather than looking at what we had to offer. The one who'd gone to my left was more obvious than the other, goose necking and stretching to, seeming to check for anyone else in the store. I was definitely starting to get a bad feeling from the three.\n\nThe other had gone behind our coffee island to come around by the fountain machines by my right. It seemed to me he was making a pretense of considering our fountain flavors, more just standing there than doing any actual considering.\n\nTo be fair, I'd never been robbed. Our gas station hadn't been robbed in over 10 years, though that record was broken one night when my relief was working, in a terrifying style. But, the only other all night gas station in town, maybe 2, 3 miles down the road, and in a much worse part of town to be in at night, was robbed monthly. But, with their behavior, I was starting to run through what to say and how to act should a robbery come to pass, and paying as much attention to physical detail as I could, to be able to give a good description. It wasn't too hard, as the 3 seemed to be content to loiter and look at the same items for at least a minute, having taken another minute just to get to where they were going, walking with what I now call the inmate shuffle. Probably trying to build up their courage or waiting for some sign.\n\nAnd then, my budding fears were laid to rest. A marked patrol car, glorious in it's reflected day-glow writing, black and white coloring, and the recognizable from a distance light setup resting on the roof of the car pulled up alongside the car outside. An officer I didn't recognize climbed out, stretching and moving slow, obviously tired and cramped from having sat in his car for a while. He made his way slowly into the gas station.\n\nHe looked around as he came in, taking in the 3 guys, and gave me a questioning look. I guess something seemed off to him as well. I grinned, happier to see him than I usually was to see the cops in the store; and believe me, I loved having them in the store. We had maybe a minute to BS before the 3 guys decided they had found what they wanted, and walked out with, if I recall correctly, a single drink. The three had spent probably 3 to 5 minutes loitering, and walked out with a single fountain drink. They'd been in my direct sight for most of the stay, and I'm pretty sure they hadn't had an opportunity to stuff anything in their pockets, furthering my suspicion of their original intents.\n\nAfter they left, he asked me what was going on, and I explained. He nodded, used the restroom (his original reason for stopping, as he was pretty far out of his area), grabbed a fountain and stuck around for about 20 minutes to be sure they didn't come back right away. He let the cop for my area know what was going on, and I noticed a definite increase in the amount of times he rolled by the street outside the gas station for a few nights.\n\nSo, thanks guys and gals. Not sure if a robbery was prevented, but I certainly feel like it was. Hopefully a gas station clerk in each of your areas has a foiled robbery story floating around in their heads, and they remembered to say thanks to you guys.",

        "text": "Overnight gas station attendant. Turbo is what I will be calling the officer in charge of the area the gas station sat in.\n\nTurbo walked into the gas station, posting up to the side of my register island. He glanced around the store, then looked at me. “Fuck it.”\n\n“Uh, OK.” Turbo was in early tonight, but I didn't really mind.\n\n“It's Friday, man, and my last night on overnights.”\n\n“Oh. Well, grats man.” I liked Turbo, so it'd kind of suck if his replacement wasn't as cool as he was. Turbo and I shared a macabre sense of humor, so it was easy to BS with him throughout the night. On a good slow night, he'd spend an hour or two keeping me company.\n\n“Yeah. I've been waiting. But, fuck it. I'm not writing any tickets tonight unless I really, actually have to.”\n\n“Oh, hell yeah. Take it easy man. Just stand there, scare the ghetto rats when they come in for their swishers.” He chuckled because it was true. We passed a good hour and a half BS'ing and messing with the people coming in to buy their cigars. The local ghetto housing complex was just down the hill from the gas station, and the people from that housing complex made up a good amount of my customers, as they needed their cigars to roll their blunts.\n\nThe front of the store is all glass, so you can see people walking up. You could see the moment the realization that a cop was in the store would cut through the fog of drugs and alcohol, as the person stumbling along would suddenly stop, look at the cop car, then glance inside to Turbo standing beside my register. He'd waggle his eyebrows at them, and about half the time, they'd turn around and walk off.\n\nOthers would come in and ask for their swisher, flashing their ID without being asked and talking in hushed tones while the stench of pot rolled off of them. Turbo would banter with the customer, usually making exaggerated sniffing noises while asking them about their purchases, how they could stand the taste of the cigars, didn't it fall out too easily to be any good.  A few he'd ask if they smelled something skunky, and would joke with me he'd have to get animal control out to find the animal if it was so bad we could smell it inside. Overall, it was a great night, and we were having plenty of laughs.\n\nThe piece de resistance of the night came probably about 130, though. Turbo was hanging out still when a car pulled up outside, and 2 guys, probably about 18-20, got out and mosied into the store.\n\n“Good evening, welcome to gas station.” The two stopped just inside the door, and one elbowed the other in the side.\n\n“Hey, uh. Hey.”\n\n“How can I help you?”\n\nA shit eating grin covered the face of the one who had just elbowed his buddy. “Hey man, you got any donuts?” Oh shit. I just about lost it, because I knew this was going to be awesome. \n\n“Yeah, of course.” I pointed to the fresh donut case Turbo was standing right in front of, and they might not have seen. “Fresh donuts right here. Mini donuts are over there.” As I finished talking, Turbo took over. First, he stood up straight and tall, adding a few inches as he'd been slouching beside the register. A scowl, as if he'd just found out someone had shot his dog, dropped down over his face, and his hands came to rest on the top of his vest, pulling it up and allowing him to roll his shoulders menacingly.\n\n“That a cop joke?”\n\nThe grin fell from the idiot's face, followed immediately by the color from both their faces. The one who'd asked the question could now barely talk, stammering out his responses. “N-n-no, sir. Not at all. We, uh, we really wanted donuts.” \n\nTurbo took a small step towards the two, dropping his voice. “You sure?”\n\n“Yes sir! We wanted donuts!”\n\n“We'll see.” The two came into the store, off to the side with the mini donuts. Turbo flashed me a grin with a quiet promise to be back, and headed for the door to the store. I was cracking up, but trying to stay professional, as Turbo stepped out to their car and took down their license and tag info to run it.\n\nThe two idiots are wandering the store, looking at snacks, unaware that the cop they just made fun of is running their car, when our overnight traffic cop pulls into the lot. He doesn't come in as often as turbo, but this is about his normal time to swing by and “not accept” the fountain drink I “don't offer” the officers working nights. Turbo flagged him down, and the two stood outside, talking. I'm assuming from the nod inside that Turbo was telling Traffic about the two.\n\nIt's only when flashlights flare to life outside, and Turbo and Traffic are walking around the car, looking for stuff in plain view, that the two idiots notice that the cops have doubled. The one who hadn't opened his mouth earlier starts freaking out. Even across the store, I can hear him almost crying. “They're looking in my car, man. They're looking in my car! Oh, god. Oh god!” The other guys trying to get him to relax.\n\nThey ask me again where the donuts are, and come up to the register with 5 packs of mini donuts, assuring me they wanted donuts even before coming into the store. While their backs are turned to the outside, paying for the donuts and cigarettes, two more cops come walking up from the side of the store. I found out later they'd been parked on the edge of the lot, working on reports and BS'ing, and had wandered over to see what Turbo and Traffic were up to.\n\nThe whiny idiot almost fell over when he realized the cops had doubled again and they'd have to walk through the group to get to his car. Once outside the group of cops maneuvered to sort of surround the two, and they all talked for about 5 minutes. When they finally left, the two late comers went back to their car while Turbo and Traffic came back into the store. Turbo was almost crying from laughing, because their had been a baton in the back seat, and they'd given the two all sorts of shit about it.\n\nI missed having Turbo around, but his replacement turned out to be just as cool, so more power to him for getting the shift he wanted.",

        "text": "*State Trooper. All radio traffic translated into normal english.*\n\nBeing a State Trooper, I deal with crashes all day long. Most are minor with no injuries. This day wasn't as simple.\n\nI was at one end of the area my office covers, just finishing up a crash between three big rigs and a sedan that was in a sandwich you didn't want to be in. It was towards the end of the shift, and we usually only get one bad call like that a day. I was headed back to the office to do the paperwork. \n\nThen another call came out, \"Dispatch to Unit 5, we've got reports of a motorcycle down. There's an ambulance en route.\" Motorcycle down means 9/10 times, there's an injury. Unit 5 replied that he was on his way, but he was pretty far away. He had just helped out at my scene, and the two crashes were at opposite ends of the area.\n\n\"Dispatch to any other units, please advise if you can assist Unit 5.\" No reply. I chimed in, \"2BlueZebras, I can be en route, but it'll take me a while if anyone is closer.\" Dispatch asked again, \"2BlueZebras, I copy. Any other unit available?\" Radio silence. \"2BlueZebras, show me en route.\"\n\nThis happened to be during the peak hours of rush hour in a big city. Without lights and sirens, it'd take me about an hour to get there. I started heading that way, driving at a brisk pace and using the shoulder to get by a lot of traffic, but not going full emergency lights. A lot of these crashes result in minor injuries and don't merit driving like a maniac to get to someone who has no more than a scratch.\n\nThe radio came on again, \"Helo1 to dispatch, we're on your radio frequency. We've got eyes on the crash. It looks like there's some bystanders near the rider. The rider is on the ground and not moving.\" Dispatch did their typical echo, \"Helo1 I copy, rider down and not moving.\"\n\nThat was my cue to get there a little faster. I turn on all the lights and my siren and get to moving. I went on shoulder, off shoulder, city streets, highway, and every which way I knew to get there as quickly as possible. My thoughts were serious injury, possibly dying, every second counts.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later I'm about halfway there. \"Unit 5 to dispatch, I'm on scene.\" \"Dispatch to Unit 5, I copy. Please advise the extent of injuries when available.\" I'm still driving pretty quick, waiting for an update. A minute or so later dispatch asks, \"Unit 5, any update?\" No reply. \"Unit 5?\" No reply. If you're not replying to dispatch, it's usually because you're extremely busy doing something more important. Something like CPR.\n\nI stepped my response up a bit. About 1/4 mile out, on city streets, I came across an ambulance with its lights and sirens on. Good chance they were going where I was, so I dropped in behind them. As we approached the freeway, they were paused at an intersection. They started going left, which I knew to be the wrong way. I went around, and they fell in behind me. When seconds matter, it pays to know the area better than Google Maps. What would've taken an hour in traffic took me 10 minutes.\n\nI was approaching the scene to see a firetruck blocking one lane completely, obstructing my view. Still no update from Unit 5. \"Dispatch, I'm on scene.\" Dispatch acknowledged and asked, \"Please advise the extent of injuries when you can.\"\n\nI got out of my car and jogged up to the fire truck, expecting to see a yellow fatal tarp or Unit 5 doing CPR compressions. As I turned the corner I saw the firefighters with Unit 5 and the rider. I asked, \"How's he doing?\" The firefighter looked at me and replied, \"Pretty good, actually.\"\n\nI let out a big exhale. \"2BlueZebras to Dispatch, minor injuries.\" I walked back to my car to begin the paperwork.",

The reason I stopped you is for your speed. I need to see your driver's license, registration, and insurance.\" The driver started retrieving it all. \n\nI'm always curious what excuse people will come up with, so I asked him, \"Were you aware of how fast your were going?\" He replied, \"The speedometer said 65.\" I laughed at the blatant lie, \"65? Sure. I paced you at 80.\" He replied, \"Well, the speedometer only goes to 65.\" \n\nThat was a new one. I hadn't considered that the vehicle could exceed the speedometer. I let him know, \"The speedometer may only go to 65, but the truck goes at least 80.\"\n\nAll his paperwork checked out, and he was let go with a warning.",

We were the first to arrive and we made contact with the call reporter, which ended up being a young college couple.

Our callers made sure we knew they didn't touch anything and our crime scene was secure.  A good drizzle was on and off, making sure we were just chilly enough to need a jacket, which I didn't bring.  \nFinally the FTO came out (leaving the recruit to continue searching), patted down the male party of the callers and asked him to show her where the body was.  \nAnother few minutes go by when I hear on the radio that everyone was coming out.  We point flashlights towards the woods to make sure they're going the right direction.  \nUpon emerging, the FTO thanked the callers for their times and sent them out.

For non US folks, party stores can be a generic brand or a chain of stores that sells nothing but helium balloons, crepe paper, and party themed plates and forks and knives etc.\n\nThey would also sell canisters of helium for the parties which were meant for balloon animals.

Dragon Patrol was a patrol shift where the MP (in this case it was me) had a ride-along of a SFC (Sergeant First Class) to a 1LT (First Lieutenant), and just patrolled a certain AO (Area of Operation). If we caught someone doing something bad that happened to be in the same brigade as us, then we would tell them to stop it and leave. Unless it was too serious and I had to intervene as an MP. Whoever we caught would better hope I didn’t have to intervene, otherwise it is a lot worse than dealing with your leadership.\n\nAnyway, I was working this patrol shift and the person who was supposed to ride with me ended up not showing up. So I had a decision, stay there and become an extra patrol shift so assist the actual patrols around post (a roaming patrol), or leave. Well I love the law enforcement portion of my job and sometimes we rarely get to do it so I decided to stay. \n\nI was driving west down Apennines Drive, which is a one way, when I hear a call over the radio, “Any patrol closer to Trooper Gate please be in route to that location. A call came in from the gas station right outside the gate on Washington Street stating that a Bravo Foxtrot (black female) got into the trunk of a vehicle and is headed on post. The vehicle description is a Nissan Maxima with XXXX plates”. \n\n“Riley this is 4-4, show me in route to trooper gate to stop the vehicle”, “Roger 4-4, can any other patrol assist?”  Trooper Gate is about 6 miles from where I was from, and I’m sure there was another patrol closer, but I was eager for something. I hauled up to about 45 MPH and headed that way. “Riley this is 3-9, I’m in route to assist 4-4.” 4-4 was the K9 unit on for the mid shift. \n\nAfter a few minutes I finally get there and K9 already has the vehicle stopped in the PX parking lot right inside Trooper Gate. I turn on my lights, and get out of the vehicle. We are talking to the driver and the K9 patrol was in the process of having him admit that there was someone in the trunk of the car. Finally we tell him to just open up the trunk of the vehicle, and as we are watching to see who comes out, the legs of a younger teenager emerges.\n\nFast forward through all the boring parts I am arresting the driver for disobeying a Lawful order by the commanding general. I tell him the basics, “separate your feet until I tell you to stop. Okay stop. Please lean forward at the waist.” I shit you not, he hump the front of the patrol vehicle. This time I tell him to lean forward at the waist while he is still standing up and slightly pushing on his back to tell him to lean forward. He humps the patrol vehicle again. This time I tell him again, and shove him forward on the hood of the vehicle and place him in handcuffs. \n\nI take him back to station and do all the paperwork on the guy. The teenager in the backseat turned out to be 16 years old, forgot her DoD ID at home (she lives on post) and just so happened to be the daughter of two First Sergeants. The best part about the whole night was that I was in the room while MPI (Military Police Investigations) calls the parents about what their daughter did that night. I also got off at 4am instead of 6am. \n\nThe next day I hear that the teenager was charged with criminal trespassing. Not sure if it went all the way through. ",

        "text": "I've told this story a number of times in person and online, so if a bit of it tickles your memory, this is the first time I have ever told the entire story online, and the first time here.\n\nThere was a lot of politics going on within my first jurisdiction. Through a county ballot measure they had replaced the independent county coroner of 30+ years (and the independent office that went back over 120 years) with the deputy sheriff and merged the offices in to one. \n\nI'm sure many of you are aware of the patchwork mess that is the elected coroner, justice of the peace, medical examiner, etc. It is a nightmare in the US.\n\nI was personally upset over this issue because I believe that while forensics and LEOs should cooperate, there always should be a very distinct line between our respective offices and responsibilities, to keep us both honest. This instance was a baldfaced power move to make everyone accountable to one person in particular. More importantly, the new boss was a bit of a pompous ass who looked vaguely like Seth Macfarlane.\n\nI quit the office in protest along with most of the staff and got a new job. It didn't help that we all knew the new sheriff/coroner got his job from rampant nepotism, and couldn't tell a myocardial infarction from his rectum. He really had no idea what he was getting in to, and the one time I interacted with him previously on a scene was during a hanging suicide. He tried to micromanage the whole thing by telling us to do basically the opposite of everything in a standard forensics textbook. He also was very reluctant to step through the door to even look at the body. I guess he didn't want to muss up his JCPenny loafers with shit and piss. \n\n It has been a number of years since, so I can't comment about how things turned out, but at the time it was bad enough that my new Sgt was on the guys speed dial so he could ask him what he should do, while my Sgt was in a jurisdiction almost 2 hrs south. His phone was ringing off the hook, and he bitched to me about my old boss constantly. \n\nWell, my final job as an autopsy tech there was after I had officially quit and moved to the new jurisdiction. It turned out that the new boss had pissed off our forensic pathologist  and another sawbones enough that they both quit too, so the new deputy sheriff/coroner **called me on my day off, after I had quit several months before, at 3am, while I was three sheets to the wind, at a party**(hey downvoting friend, the guy was a really incompetent inconsiderate asshole, I didn't even work for him any more for several months and lived almost 200 miles away and he assumed it was totally cool for me to come in at 6am when it was 3:30am) and asked me to assist with two autopsies in a few hours. Fuck it, I was broke. Sure, I'll do it.\n\nI negotiated $100/hr as my base pay. It sounds like a lot, but a standard autopsy takes maybe .75 or 1.0 hours. It was also a bit shy of 4 hours drive time round trip for this job if I floored it.  So I drove up and met up with the new crew knowing that there were at least two autopsies on the schedule for the day.\n\nWell, this was a mistake. \n\nThe thing about our jurisdiction was that we did not have a central morgue, so we contracted out with a number of funeral homes to allow us to store the bodies in their freezers and perform the autopsy in their mortuary with (mostly) their gear.\n\nThe first we pulled out of the two body fridge was a horribly skinny woman who had died of a heroin OD after she went on methadone trying to get clean and went back to the good stuff.\n\nThe new forensic pathologist was a bit of an asshole, and he chased me around the autopsy suite with her disembodied vagina/labia/uterus trying to scare me. While I found that really fucked up and crass, I had seen worse and I knew he was trying to haze me. I was also a bit too tired to care.\n\nAll in all it looked like very minimal decomp and pretty straightforward, but everything smelled far more horrible than would be expected. We did a basic autopsy and it went fairly quickly. \n\nWell, like I said, we only had a two body fridge at this facility. It turned out that our second body in the cooler was just south of 400lbs, and had been found after 6 days in a bad motel room with the heat cranked to max, so both the lady before him and obviously himself were pretty...bad in terms of smell.\n\nWe finally managed to maneuver this guy on to the gurney, and get him set up on the table. His gut was distended heavily with gas and he was marbled with green/purple/yellow patches all over. Every time we shifted him he oozed clear/yellow liquid from places that I'd rather forget. \n\nThe doc went in to make the initial Y incision to open up the chest cavity, and it sounded like a wet balloon with the air being pinched out as the gas escaped through his chest cavity. The pressure of the escaping gas was enough to lightly coat all of us and the ceiling in rotting gore, and the liquefied fat poured over the gurney and turned the autopsy suite floor in to an ice skating rink. The next several hours were trying to stay upright while using a scalpel on greased tile. \n\nWe were all in full biohaz gear at this point and were dry heaving from the smell. I took a small break out to the loading dock to have a smoke and eat a McD's quarter pounder. I was hungover, tired, and sick to my stomach. \n\nRemember that this was primarily a funeral home.\n\nWell, there I was smoking a cig and eating a burger with gore splattered whites when the entire extended family of an old lady who was laid out in the same room with these two at the funeral home walks around for a viewing/wake on the wrong end of the building. \n\nThey weren't supposed to ever be there. Entirely wrong side of the funeral home. \n\nMy Spanish is pretty rusty, and none of them spoke a lick of English, but through basic phrases and gesticulating I think I was able to communicate that I had nothing to do with their grannies embalming and situation, and that they should go to the main reception area. The look in their eyes was nothing but pure horror when they saw me.\n\n I never did get paid for that days work due to some bureaucratic nonsense and county budget cuts. \n\nThe skinny girl heroin OD took maybe 30/45 minutes, the leaking decomp guy was a 3 hour job. \n\nWhat's $330 with interest over 8 years?",

I am a lead generator, that person who stands by a display and tries to get you to buy a new bath tub, furnace, or generator...you get the idea. I wear a different color apron than the employees so it should be super obvious that I don't work there. This job is stupid boring so I spend most of my day helping customers find things in the store. The store has a phone app so it's pretty easy.    \nSo a few days ago I was wandering around the store when I asked this older woman if she needed help finding anything, lets call her OCB for Old Cranky Bitch. Everything went pretty normally she needed construction adhesive, I knew where they were, I took her there. Then it took a strange turn.    \nOCB: \"It needs to work on concrete\"    \nMe: \"Well X brand and Y brand both say they work on concrete. What is your project?\"    \nOCB: \"I'm repairing a garden gnome.\"    \nMe: \"oh ok that's pretty heavy let me get a (hardware store) employee to help you out.\"\nOCB: \"YOU DON'T WORK HERE????\"    \nMe: \"No ma'am I work for (company) but I can get you an employee that would know more\"    \nOCB: \"THIS IS FRAUD!!! YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO SELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T NEED!!! WHO DO YOU WORK FOR???\"    \nMe: \"(Company) ma'am, we are a heating and cooling company\"    \n[more questions, expletives, I don't really remember exactly what she said]        \nOCB: \"THIS IS FRAUD!!! I AM CALLING THE POLICE\"    \nAt this point I just told her that it wasn't necessary, she insisted, so I found the store manager, explained to him what happened, he tried to talk to her, she continued to freak out and actually called the police.    \nThe police came and interviewed everyone, no arrests were made, no citations given, and after OCB stormed off, we all had a good laugh about it after. I live in a pretty small town so the sheriffs knew us both, I used to watch one of the reporting officers kids. She never did end up buying the construction adhesive.    \nTl;Dr: I got the police called on me for helping a woman find a product, in a store that I don't technically work for.",

        "text": "I was driving on the freeway, with my commanding officer (CO) in the passenger seat. We're required to do ride alongs with them every few months so they can see how we act on duty. \n\nIt was early in the morning and we were on our way to coffee, after having checked that my area was clear of anyone needing help. I was about to exit, so I was in the slow lane doing about 65, when an all black sedan blew by me, easily doing 80.\n\nI moved into position behind him and made a stop. I contacted the driver and told him that I stopped him for his speed, and he was smiling as I said this. He decided he wasn't going to argue. \"Yeah man I know, I was going pretty quick, what happened was that I was trying to get away from this other car. I was in the fast lane doing 70 and this guy was tailgating me, so I sped up to 75 and I saw him in my mirror getting all aggressive and making hand motions. Then he pulled up along side me and was banging his dash.\" The driver started banging on his dash to demonstrate. \"So I decided to just get out of there.\" I acknowledged his story, and he provided me an ID with his registration and insurance. Normally when people hand me an ID when I asked for a license, it's because they don't have a license. \n\nI headed back to my car and my CO asks, \"He pretty mad in there? I saw him banging the dash.\" I explained he was telling me his story of why he was speeding, but otherwise it was pretty calm. I checked the driver's ID, and it came back as with a valid license, which always confuses me. I ended up writing him a ticket for his speed. \n\nI walked back up to the driver and asked why he handed me an ID when he had a valid license. \"Well you see, man, I let my buddy borrow my license for...\" He trailed off when he realized where he was going. I interjected, \"You should probably stop with this story before you get into more trouble.\" He agreed, and went on to say, \"Man, I just want to say thank you. I'm on parole, I've got a little bit of weed on me (which I smelled but ignored), and a few years ago I used to hate you guys. But I'm out now, I'm older, I've got a good job, and I really appreciate what you do. You totally could've been a dick but you were cool.\" He offered his hand to shake, which I accepted. He signed the ticket and was on his way. \n\nI walked back to my CO again to leave, and he asked, \"Happy customer?\" I replied, \"Yeah, he actually was.\" My CO commented, \"Appreciate those when you can. They're pretty rare.\"\n\nMaybe, maybe not. I get hand shakes and thank you's on a daily basis.",

        "text": "*State Trooper. All radio transmissions translated into normal English*\n\nDispatch calls me, \"2BlueZebras, we're getting calls of a vehicle blocking the fast lane, possibly involved in a crash into the center divider.\" I give the standard reply, \"Show me en route.\"\n\nThis call came out during rush hour traffic. Where I work, these come out pretty often. And more often than not, the vehicle is gone by the time I get there. Usually it's a drunk person who lost control and took off, or a blown out tire. So I roll over there not expecting to find much.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, I rolled onto the scene to find the vehicle still blocking the fast lane, with traffic backing up around us. \"Dispatch, I'm on scene, and we are blocking the fast lane.\" I exit my car to see if this was a crash, if anyone is hurt, if the car is driveable, and figure out if we're waiting for a tow truck or I'm pushing this car.\n\nI walk up and approach the driver, who I quickly assess to be crying hysterically. She's probably no older than 20, tiny, and freaked out.\n\n\"Good afternoon, ma'am. Are you hurt at all?\" She shakes her head no. \"Were you involved in a crash?\" She shakes her head again, and in between sobs gets out, \"No, it just died on me when I was driving. I try to start it but it keeps dying.\" She turned the key to demonstrate that it was, in fact, not working. I walked up to the front of the car to confirm that there wasn't any damage.\n\nAt this point I go through my mental checklist:\n\n1. Not injured, no ambulance needed.\n\n2. Not crashed, no damage to the vehicle. It should roll just fine.\n\n3. I've got 4 lanes of traffic to get across since there's no center divider. The shoulder is my only option.\n\n4. Hysterical driver, do I want her driving this, even if she's only steering it to the shoulder? Or should we sit tight for a tow truck that's 20 minutes out? Let's find out...\n\n\"Alright ma'am, here's what's going to happen. I'm going to use my car to push yours over to the shoulder. I'll use my lights, traffic will stop, and we'll get you into a better spot. Do you think you're up for driving it if I'm just pushing you?\" She's getting a little bit more composed at this point and tells me, \"Yeah, I can do that.\"\n\nSo that's what we do. I get into my car and go over my speaker, \"Alright, here we go. Turn your wheels to the right. We're going to the shoulder.\" I hit all my lights and blip my siren a few times so cars in the lanes over get the idea they need to stop. As I'm doing this, I see a few big rigs in the lane to my right who're blocking the lanes with their hazards on so we can get across. It makes me appreciate all those times I've cut big rig drivers a break.\n\nI end up pushing her to the shoulder, and I make contact again, \"How are you feeling?\" Still a few sobs as she's wiping the tears from her eyes, but she gets out, \"Much better now that we're over here.\" I figure out she's got a tow truck on its way, and I've called one as well. I let her know, \"I'll wait in my car behind you until the tow truck arrives. We're a lot safer on the shoulder.\"\n\nA few minutes later the tow truck driver shows up. We all exit our vehicle to figure out what we're doing. The driver decides she wants her car towed to a repair shop. As we're standing there, she tells me, \"Thank you, I really appreciate what you did.\" Then she does a little lean forward onto her toes like she's going to give me a hug. I instinctively lean back to indicate that it wouldn't be a good idea. Out-of-context pictures from drivers passing by is something I don't need. She got the message. \"Not a problem, ma'am. That's what we do.\" I hopped back into my car while the tow truck driver started hooking up the car.\n\n\"Dispatch, roadway is clear, I'm available for the next call.\"",

        "text": "As many of you know, I was injured a while back, and my road to recovery is apparently [more like this](http://cdn.eso.org/images/screen/2009_nature_0006.jpg) than [it is this](http://www.doctorhousingbubble.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/cul-de-sac.png).  It also appears that it might be a [closer to this](http://www.uncommonphotography.net/wp-content/gallery/blog-dead-end/dsc_8451.jpg).  All this self-pity about possibly cutting my career short after 12 years in got me thinking back on what I've done, the calls I've taken, and the lives I've affected one way or the other.  And I thought back to a time that I was really glad I didn't give up.\n\nI remember seeing the call on my screen.  A welfare check.  A woman out of state hadn't been able to get a hold of her mother in a while.  Wanted us to go check on her.  This type of call is fairly common.  I've even seen calls like \"Wife can't reach husband for 2 hours, wants PD to go check on him.\" Like, geez, lady.  Give the man some breathing room.  But I digress.\n\nOn that day, I didn't take that call.  But I do remember reading it.  Another officer took the call.  Went to the home, got no response, and closed it.\n\nAbout 4 or 5 days went by when the call was back.  Same address, same details.  Go check on my mom because I'm out of state.  Sometimes I wonder how it is that people care enough to check, but not enough to fly out themselves.  Or care enough to have an emergency contact person near their parent that they can reach out to.\n\nThis time I got the call.  I went to the house.  Nice house.  Good neighborhood.  Backed up to a man-made lake.  I do the usual....check for a lot of mail in the box, a stack of newspapers in the driveway, or other signs that no one has entered or exited in quite some time.  I see no such evidence.  I ring on the door bell.  No one answers.  I ring again.  No answer.  I knock loudly, and announce myself as an officer.  Still no one comes to the door.  I leave.  I call the RP and she doesn't answer either.  I close the call out.\n\nTwo days later, the same call is on the screen.  Same RP.  This time I decide to call her first.  The adult daughter tells me that her mother is estranged from most of her family.  She is the only one who keeps in contact with her, and speculating, even that relationship sounds tense.  She hasn't heard from her mother in about 3 months, and it is now becoming concerning to her.  Again, I'm always curious what makes people decide that after months of not talking to a family member, today is the day that I'm officially concerned enough to call the police.  She tells me that she heard from a neighbor that the power was turned off, and she's not even sure if her mother still lives there, or if she perhaps went elsewhere.  \n\nI respond back to the house.  Everything looks the same.  I ring....ring....knock.....knock and announce.....no answer. I walk around the house, and all the blinds are drawn.  I try to look for signs of life (like light or a TV or movement of shadows) or signs of death (like several generation of flies, dead in the windowsill). I find neither. I walk into the side yard, and then the back.  \n\nWalking across the paver patio, I see that one side of the sliding door isn't covered with blinds.  I walk closer and look inside.  It's very dark, and I can't see much.  I turn on my flashlight and press it to the glass.  The beam doesn't seem as intense as it usually does, which I found odd enough to remember but not odd enough to deduce any further.  Inside there are many boxes stacked up. I also see pet carriers.  Oh, and feces.  Lots of feces.  There are dog turds all over. As I've got my face pressed up against the glass to fight the glare of the afternoon sun, movement not only catches my eyes, but scares the crap out of me.  It's a dog.  A little white dog.  I think it's a Bichon Frise?  It's small, and white, and puffy...like Buffalo Bill had in Silence of the Lambs.\n\nSo I start thinking.  Did the old lady move out and abandon her dogs?  Or did the she die, and the dogs have been eating her (a situation that is not foreign to me...at all).  I now find myself concerned for this dog that appears to be confined to a home, since all the dog shit is inside and not in the yard.  Does it have water?  Is it suffering?  Is it eating mom's face and feet to sustain itself?\n\nI call my sergeant.  I give him the details and he agrees that I have exigent circumstances to check the welfare of the lady and the dog, and gives me the go ahead to force entry.  I have no one with a key anywhere around, so it's gonna be a door kick.  Now, I've read the stories of people getting scared, and/or cops getting shot when forcing entry.  So I knock and announce for several minutes whenever I'm gonna do it.  Once the door is open I'll knock and announce again, so my voice carries in to the home.  Then as I move from room to room, I keep saying \"Officer ForensicUnit, Police Department, I'm here to check on you.  Can you hear me?\"\n\nAnd so, I started my ritual.  I rang the doorbell another half dozen times.  I knocked as loudly as I could.  I knocked loudly and announced myself.  And I ended with “This is the _________ Police Department.  I’m going to kick the door now, to come inside.”  I take a step back, plant my left leg firmly, and start to bring my right leg up and forward….as the door opens.  I have to catch myself from kicking the open space or falling over, as my brain is quickly trying to OODA loop and SARA model what the fuck is going on here.\n\nThere’s a woman.  An old woman.  She looks [somewhat like this]( http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_H-VU2YdQWA/UXnltvXSRHI/AAAAAAAABQ8/_BGHwAO2AXI/s1600/madammim.jpg), but thinner, and pastier.  She’s clad in a light purple mumu (moomoo?) that’s hanging off of her.  But that’s not what I notice.  In fact, I’m amazed I even saw the woman at all. What I noticed was that I just got slammed by a wall of ammonia and shit, so thick it coated my tongue.  Being that I was ready to kick in the door, I had my flashlight in my hand.  I shined it in the house and now saw what was causing it to fail earlier.  The ammonia from the urine, and whatever evaporates from feces was so thick, it was particulates in the air.  Particulates so dense, it cut the light beam down as it tried to penetrate though the home.  \n\nNow folks, I’ve been to some homes that smelled like cat piss.  I have.  I’ve been to apartments where people get a dog (usually college aged girls) and they decide that walking them is too much effort, so they give the dog a bed room and that dog shits and pisses in there any time it wants to.  And sometimes they take it for a walk or to the bark park, and if it poops in the room they pick up most of it, but still…the bedroom is a bathroom. I’ve been there. I’ve been to the crazy cat lady’s home who has 19 cats and 5 litter boxes.  And even with 5 fucking boxes, a couple of those unappreciative assholes still piss on her hallway carpet.  I’ve been there.  I’ve been there, hated it, gagged, tried not to puke, and breathed through my nose.  This was absolutely not even comparable to those homes.  This was as absolute tsunami wall of piss shit body odor vapor that came out of the home and knocked me backward.  I’ll never forget it, and hope to never experience it again.  \n\nAs I regained my focus and composure, I address the woman.  Typing this now, I believe I got her name from her daughter. I’ll call her Sara.  I asked “Are you Sara?”  She told me she was.  I told her that her daughter and I have been awfully worried about her.  She told me she was fine.  I knew this not to be true.  I said something about her daughter calling me, and she scoffed, telling me that her daughter must not come around to check on her too often.  She told me she just wanted to be left alone.  She said she only opened the door because I said I was going to kick it.  She kept trying to go back inside, and I kept trying to keep her there with me. I asked about her dogs.  She told me she had 14.  “Could I see them?” I inquired?  That, regrettably, got me in the home, but thankfully, allowed me to see what was inside. \n\nAs I breached the threshold, what I believed at the time to be the most overwhelming odor ever intensified.  It now burned my eyes.  I couldn’t breathe.  I had trouble seeing.  I asked to turn on a light, but she told me the power was off.  In Sara’s bedroom I found 14 Bichon Frise dogs in a wire pen.  She had several adults. She breeds them.  Used to show them.  Used to get awards.  One of her female got pregnant and had puppies.  Not all of them survived. But now she has 14 left.  She can’t let them outback because there are no walls between neighbors.  She’s trying to take care of them.  But with no income, and the water and power being shut off it’s getting harder.  I literally cannot breathe.  I have to get out.  We walk back to the front entrance.  \n\n\nI asked about the water situation.  How’s she getting by?  Sara tells me that she goes to the neighbors every other day or so and uses a hose to fill up a 5 gallon bucket.  She uses that bucket to pour water in the toilet to flush it.  “At least someone’s poop is leaving the house,” I think to myself.  She has some food left, and her neighbors have given her some as well. She doesn’t like charity, but times have been hard recently.  She wants to get back in to breeding and showing so she can earn some money.\n\nIt’s clear to me that Sara has lost complete grip on reality.  She denies any help I offer.  Doesn’t even want the Fire Department to come check her out.  I call anyway.  \n\nWhen they show up, I explain everything to the captain.  They tend to her while I call the daughter back.  I tell her that I found her mother.  She’s relieved.  Then I tell her the state of her home, her living conditions, and her mind.  She has no means to help she tells me.  She can’t come to my state. She knows no one locally. She offers me no solution.  It still upsets me.  My boss is already on his way over.  This was several years ago, when mental health issues were hard for officers to deal with.  Not emotionally, logistically. She needed to be evaluated, but she didn’t want to go talk to anyone.  The volumes of paperwork I would need to fill out to commit her spoke repeatedly of the intent to harm self or others.  This didn’t exist.  She was a sweet, peaceful, old lady who wanted to be left alone.  Sadly, back in those days, if we couldn’t find a mental health solution we would look for a criminal one.  At least it would buy us time to get intervention somehow.  Occupying a home that doesn’t have electricity or water service was actually illegal. So I had the option of arresting her for that.  But really?  That didn’t sound or feel right.  \n\nI made several phone calls.  They don’t make for great story telling, so it’s not paragraphs…but they did take quite a while. I eventually found out that I could have her committed for being acutely and permanently disabled.  That meant that she was obviously not able to care for herself, and never would be.  That fit the bill exactly. Now, how to get her to Psych?\n\nI returned to speak with Sara.  No, she didn’t want to go anywhere.  She didn’t want to talk to anyone either.  We had already made a big enough fuss.  The neighbors were already looking at the scene of emergency vehicles outside her home.  This was all just too much.  Sara just wanted to go back inside to tend to her dogs. I told Sara I was worried about her.  Told her how she looked thin, and not healthy. I asked her if I could please take her to a doctor. If she wasn’t healthy, who would care for the dogs? She needed to be looked at.  \n\n\nShe finally relented.  I took the opportunity before she changed her mind.  All the laws, policies, case laws, and paper work backed me up.  I could physically detain her to transport her to Psych, and use reasonable force to do so.  But I didn’t want to even think about getting to that point.  I walked Sara to my car, and opened the back door for her.  She stepped in, still wearing her sagging purple mumu.\n\nWe drove downtown and I walked in to Psych with her.  I handed her over to a nice young nurse and filled out the paperwork.  Staff and clients turned their nose at me when they passed.  I stunk.  I knew it.  I could smell it.  Fuck, I could taste it.  It was on me, my clothes, my hair, my skin.  I filled out the papers, describing the conditions I found Sara in, and the conversations that we had.  Acutely and permanently disabled is hard to prove. The state doesn’t want to be used as a dumping grounds for the elderly.  Nor do they want greedy relatives using it to get rid of able bodied grandparents of sound mind.  I was very detailed in my descriptions.\n\nWhen I was finished, I returned to the home.  As I entered the neighborhood, I had my windows down to air out my car.  I realized that I could smell the odor again as I got within 2 blocks of the home. I pulled up to find that the Fire Department had placed a large ventilation fan in the doorway. They took a reading while I was gone.  I can’t remember the specific chemical they tested for, but it was at unsafe levels.  The kind of levels that required them to wear SCBA’s to enter, by policy.  \n\nWe aired out the home, called a local rescue we work with to foster the dogs while Sara got things resolved, locked up the home, and left.\n\nBut I think of Sara.  Even 12 years later.  Sara is one of those cases where officers did no wrong in walking away the first couple of times.  You have to weigh what you have against what you can do.  If it hadn’t been for that one loose dog, I might have walked away again.  But luckily persistence paid off.  And Sara got out of that home alive. I don’t know what happened to Sara in the long term.  I believe she was placed in a state assisted living facility and was on court ordered medication. But when I think back over my 12 year career, there a couple of times that I know I had a direct impact on someone’s life. This is one of those cases.  And thinking back on it makes me happy.\n",

        "text": "I was 21 years old.  I had graduated from college with a degree in Evidence Technology 2 weeks ago on a Friday, and started the following Monday at my new job. I was a Crime Scene Tech.  Right away we were sent through an in house, two week crime scene school.  It covered everything from fingerprinting, to photographing. We were one of the first agencies in the country to use digital photography.  We had 2.35 megapixel cameras and we thought we were hot shit.  It covered static dust print lifting, evidence collection, chemical processing, and…dead bodies.  \n\nI was 21 years old.  I didn’t have a ton of life experience.  I didn’t serve in the military.  I didn’t grow up in the rough inner city.  And I certainly had never seen a dead body.  In fact, during a previous interview with the medical examiner’s office for a position of Body Transport, I was asked about that very subject: “What are you going to do if you reach in to a bath tub to pull out a decomp and his arms come off in your hands.  Can you handle that?”  “Well, I can’t honestly answer you because I’ve never been in that position.  But I can tell you this is what I want to do and I think I’m prepared.”  I had read every non-fiction forensic book I could find.  I bought old FBI field manuals on crime scene processing at book sales.  I read true crime, forensic anthropology, and forensic entomology.  And while the internet was young in 2001, I had seen images and videos of dead bodies.  Just never in person.  And then that day came.\nI was 21 years old.  I was nervous.  We packed in to our car and drove down to the medical examiners’ office.  Today was the day we’d watch autopsies, and learn how to photograph them and collect evidence.  It was also the day I’d see my first dead body.  At the time, our ME’s office was a small building under an overpass. It was non-descript.  I wouldn’t have even known what it was if I drove past the week prior.  We walk in and immediately there’s something palpable in the air. I’m not sure what.  Chemicals?  Humidity?  Cleaning products?  It’s something.  Something that makes me feel uneasy.\nBack then, you walked right in to the autopsy suite.  The 4 of us, 3 trainees an one trainer, walk in.  The room is not that large.  It has very plain square 3 or 4 inch tile on the floor.  There are two large metal tables.  But they aren’t really tables, in the traditional sense.  They have raised rounded edges, and a drop on the far end that appears to exist to collect fluids.  There’s a scale, like you’d find in the produce section, hanging next to each table.  I see a book shelf on one wall that has jars of items in liquid, books, and paperwork.  There’s a large walk in cooler door that I recognize form my days in culinary school.  And there’s a very heavy smell in the air.  \nThen it started.  The doctor walked in and suited up.  Followed by an assistant or two.  They walk to the cooler, enter, and re-emerge with a gurney on wheels.  The gurney is carrying a large white body bag.  The bag has letters and numbers written in Sharpie marker, and a unique plastic locking tag on the zipper.  The heavy bag is hoisted on to the table.  The doctor grabs a clip board, verifies the number on the bag and on the lock.  The lock is then broke, and the bag is opened.  \nThere he is. He’s lying on his back, mouth partially agape.  He’s wearing a plaid button up shirt, and dirty greyish colored jeans.  He’s covered in quite a bit of blood.  Apparently he’s been shot, and those shots ended his life.  And the process begins.  Photographs are being taken.  Clothing is removed. It’s all very impersonal.  He’s eventually lying there, naked, in front of me.  The doctor starts examining the wounds.  They are measured and documented.  The doctor grabs his instruments and cuts a deep Y in to the chest.  This is insane.  I’ve never seen flesh cut like this without the owner reacting.  I remember seeing fat from inside a body for the first time.  It was so incredibly yellow.  A deep yellow that’s almost orange, but not quite.  It was billowy, like popcorn or cotton, but gelatinous at the same time.  \n\nThe chest is cut open. The ribs are split and moved aside.  The iron like smell of raw flesh is in the air.  Later in my life I’ll recognize this smell when I harvest my first deer.  The odor inside of the body cavity is apparently common amongst species.  The doctor examines the wounds from the inside and out. Trajectory rods are placed through the wounds, and again, more pictures are taken.  I’m not moving much.  Then organs are cut out, examined, weighed, samples cut off and placed in small jars, and then placed in a white garbage bag.  A plain, white garbage bag, like I have in my kitchen.  The heart, the lungs, the liver, and so on.  \nAnd then it happens.  The stryker saw comes out.  This odd little contraption vibrates more than it does slice.  It actually cuts the skull without cutting the skin.  And it’s the weirdest think I’ve witnessed to date.  The skullcap is cut, and then the scalp is cut off.  The top of his head is now gone.  With no particular concern at all, the tech reaches in and pulls out the brain.  Let me stop here to tell you that standing over a person, looking at them from the top, from head to toe, and seeing their face and the inside of their skull without a brain at the same time, is now the weirdest thing I’ve witnessed to date, and still makes me feel uncomfortable when I remember it.   \nAt the end of it all, the garbage bag full of organs is tied in a crude knot, placed in the now empty chest cavity, and the incision in the chest is quickly stitched up.  The body is rinsed off, sealed back in a body bag with a plastic lock, and placed in the cooler. The whole process seems to have taken less than 30 minutes.  It was impersonal, sterile, and uncaring.  It’s not what I’m used to with things concerning the dead.  I watch as they repeat the process two more times.  Now I realize it isn’t an event as much as a process.  These guys are a mechanics at a lube shop.  The bodies aren’t people, they are bodies.  It’s impersonal because it needs to be.  But to someone so young, it’s still disturbing. There’s no ceremony.  Just procedure.  \nA new tech comes on shift for the 4th body, and he thinks he’s hilarious.  When the stomach comes out, he closely examines the contents to determine the last thing the person ate.  He stops closer offering to show me what’s in her stomach, which almost makes me show him what’s inside mine.  He gets great joy out of this.  As he moves his way through the organs he cuts out the appendix.  From memory, it’s small.  Smaller than I’d imagined.  And it somewhat resembles an earthworm.  The tech places it on his finger, and takes a few energetic steps toward me, hand outstretched.  I stutter step backwards, as his speed increases.  He ends chasing me around the 2nd table a time or two, all while laughing his ass off. I’m not nearly as amused. \n5 bodies later I’ve seen all I need to see that day.  5 sparkless bodies, treated like the shells they were.  Sliced open, cut apart, dissected, and stuffed back in to bags.  It was an eye opening day for me.  Little did I know it would be the first 5 of over 300 bodies that I’d come in to contact with throughout my career. Some things in law enforcement are a bit of a trial by fire, and this was one of them. I still have a photograph of myself that coworker took as we left. I’m standing, one foot on the ground and the other on the building wall behind me.  I have  cigarette in my mouth, one hand on my forehead.  And If I were a dank meamea, it would say “I’ve seen some shit.”\nBodies got easier to deal with after that.  It served to get my jitters out.  \n",

        "text": "“So, just to make sure I have the timeline correct, let me run over my notes with you, ok?” \n\nThe girls sniffed and wiped her eyes with the mascara stained tissue clutched in her bruised hand. “Ok.” She muttered. \n\n“He came to your apartment last night for dinner. You were talking about work and he became enraged when you brought up a male friend. He accused you of cheating, grabbed your wrists, dragged you into the bedroom and shut the door. He refused to let you out and hit you when you got up off the bed – closed fist to the face.” I glanced at the girl’s still swollen cheek to confirm my notes further. “Then you both eventually went to sleep: you on the bed, him in front of the door. You woke up early, around four AM and noticed he had rolled away from the door while passed out. You had to sneak away and escaped to the lobby where you called and woke up your sister who came and picked you up. You didn’t call then police initially because you were scared but called now because you have to work tonight and are worried he’s still in there and you need to change out of your pajamas. Does that sound about right?\n\nThe girl stifled a sob and dabbed at more tears. “Yes. That’s how it happened. Will you help me get my stuff?” \n\nI looked to Biggs, avoiding the temptation to smile in this serious situation but trying to make sure he knew I understood how lucky we were.\n\n“Shahad has never done anything like this before. He seems different now.” The girl blew her nose in a clear portion of tissue and shook her head in disbelief.\n\nWe made our way to her apartment but found no sign of Shahad. In fact, this call – which we poached from an area unit once we realized who the caller was referring to – was the first time we had heard from him since the ill-fated day of the failed traffic stop weeks earlier. After clearing the residence and giving the victim some privacy to change, Biggs and I talked with hushed tones, strategizing our next move.\n\n“So, we’ve got her on board with prosecuting but what warrants do we seek?” I asked. \n\n“We’ve got abduction and assault at a minimum but we can hit the code books later to see if there’s anything else.” Biggs answered. I contemplated any other way for us to drop the hammer on Shahad, still at the top of the leader board for our “most wanted recidivist” list. I came up blank.\n\n“Well, it’s a start. Maybe he’ll get stupid in jail and call her, violating the protective order.”\n\n“Yeah, but that still won’t give us a reason to drop a search warrant on his place. You know he has a ton of dope and guns in there.” Biggs was clearly coming up short in the creative charges bid as well.\n\n“True. Plus, you know how this is going to work out – boyfriend, girlfriend – no chance we get this pushed through to conviction.” The pessimist in me was winning over and my formerly giddy attitude with our luck had taken a downturn with it. \n\n“I’m ready. Thanks so much for helping.” The girl came out of her room dressed in her hostess outfit. She worked in an upscale steak house a few blocks away and had been there for some time. It was comforting to at least know our victim had some stability in her life in case we needed to track her down for court. \n\n“Not a problem.” Biggs replied. “We’re going to get warrants for Shahad and will be in touch when we find him. Be sure to keep our numbers handy in case he shows up at your work or lets you know where he’s located, ok?”\n\n“I will.” She smiled for the first time since we had met and we made our way to the elevator. \n\n“Do you know of Shahad carrying a weapon? Gun maybe? Any drug use that you know of?” I asked in lieu of small talk on the way down to the lobby. \n\n“No. No weapons that I’ve seen. It’s possible he has some though: he won’t allow me to go into his room at his dad’s apartment. I know he smokes a lot of pot, but I’m not sure if he does anything else.” \n\n“No steroids? Have you seen any syringes or anything at his place?” I was digging hard for anything to get into that apartment. \n\nA look of realization crested the girl’s face. “Do you think he’s ‘roid raging? That’s why he hit me? He has been going to the gym a lot more lately.” She trailed off and seemed lost in thought. I shrugged to Biggs. “No, though. I haven’t seen any needles either.”\n\nWe said our goodbyes and after swearing out warrants for him, spent the rest of the shift seeking out Shahad. We had no luck. \n\n“We’ll get him tomorrow.” Biggs assured me as we logged off for the night. \n\n______\n\n\nThe next afternoon, while heading into work, my phone buzzed. It was Biggs who was, presumably, heading in to work as well. \n\n“EMR. I’m behind Shahad.”\n\n“What? Are you already logged on?” \n\n“No, in my personal car heading in. Dummy cut me off and I recognized him immediately. We’re on Oak, heading west and passing Third Street. Think you can get someone to stop this guy?” \n\nI was only a block from the station so I agreed and kept him on the line while I hurriedly logged on to a computer and pulled up the GPS map showing where all the logged on units were located. “Good news and bad news. There’s a unit who is in-service just ahead of you.”\n\n“Call him, quick!”\n\n“Wait though. Bad news: it’s Roy.” Both of us sighed at the same time. Roy was a transfer from a smaller department. There, he had been a standout – one of the brightest stars in that dim universe. In our department, however, he just came off as a clueless know-it-all. He was nice enough, as a person, but to trust him with any serious police work was asking for disappointment.\n\n“Well,” Biggs began, resigned to his fate, “Call him up. I’m stopped at Seventh, still heading West on Oak.”\n\nI disconnected and rang up Roy. “EMR! What’s up man!”\n\n“Hey Roy. Here’s the deal. I see you’re on Oak. Biggs is heading in and is behind a car he thinks has a wanted subject, Shahad Mohammed, in it. The guy’s the real deal – might be armed, deals drugs, steroid user. You think you could stop him?” \n\n“Shyeah! Of course I can! I know Shabad from way back.”\n\n“It’s ‘Shahad,’ not ‘Shabad.”\n\n“Yeah, I know. I was testing you.” \n\n“Oh. OK. He’s in a black BMW, Biggs is in his Explorer. I’m going to call him. I’ll tell him to stand by once you get the car stopped in case things break bad and I’ll be dressing out ASAP to come assist too.”\n\n“No worries. I’ll have this guy in five minutes!” Roy was already patting himself on the back, a bad sign for our prospects of locking up Shahad.\n\nI hung up and called Biggs back. “He’s direct and en route to you. Listen: when he gets him stopped, be close in case the shit hits the fan. I’m getting dressed now and will tear out of here as soon as I can.”\n\n“Yeah, yeah. Of course. We’re still West-bound and I think I see Roy’s cruiser. Gotta go!”\n\nI dressed out and ran to my cruiser. As soon as I fired it up, I heard Roy mark out on a traffic stop. I headed in his direction.\n\nI arrived five minutes later to find Roy in his car, filling out paperwork. There was no sign of Shahad’s BMW. \n\n“Where is he?” I asked at his window, startling him from his summons. \n\n“Who? Abdul?” Roy asked.\n\n“No. Shahad. Did you get him stopped?” Biggs came trotting over to join us. \n\n“I stopped the car, yeah, but that wasn’t Shahad. That was some dude named Abdul. Abdul El’Shawarneeramann…” Roy couldn’t pronounce the last name.\n\n“No way man.” Biggs spat. “I saw him! It was definitely Shahad. I had to pass you guys so he wouldn’t see my car but that was him.”\n\n“Well, the guy I wrote for the dead brake light isn’t named Shahad. He had a license and everything.” Roy produced a carbon copy of the summons for us to look over. All the information was different than Shahad’s.\n\nI thanked Roy and followed Biggs back to the station. He was usually dead on with his identification of bad guys – a useful skill in our line of work – and I was confused that he would have mistaken someone else for Shahad. He thought as much too.\n\n“I know it was him.” He began pulling up mug shots as soon as we were in our office. “Call Roy and see if he can come in.” \n\nA few minutes later, Roy knocked at our door. “Fellas!”\n\n“Roy: who is this?” Biggs held up a freshly printed picture.\n\n“Abdul El’shamalamaran…” He still couldn’t get the name out.\n\n“No. This,” Biggs spun in his chair and pointed to his computer screen, still open to Shahad’s jail profile but displaying a different picture of him, “Is Shahad Mohammed.”\n\nRoy leaned in and examined the two pictures. “Ehhh, I don’t know. Their noses look different.”\n\n“No, it’s the same guy.” A flourish of key strokes and the screen was filled with different pictures of Shahad from his various arrests. \n\n“Oh.” Roy said when he saw the printed picture next to the picture of the guy with the “wrong nose.”\n\nBiggs rubbed his temples in aggravation.\n\n“Whoa.” I said, clarity suddenly dawning on me. “This could be amazing. Roy! You have that summons?” Roy retrieved it from the clipboard tucked under his arm. “Look!” I pointed to the signature line and the crude scribble that meant to serve as acknowledgment from whoever Abdul was. “He signed the different name!”\n\nBiggs caught up with me. “Forgery! Holy crap. And think about all the laws he broke by having the fake ID… this is it!”\n\n“Huh?” Asked Roy.\n\n“We can get into his apartment with a search warrant looking for the fake ID and signed summons!” I exclaimed.\n\n“So?” Roy asked.\n\n“So?” Biggs replied. “SO? We’re going to nail this guy!”\n\nRoy still looked confused but nodded his head as though he was on our same wave length.\n\nAfter a few hours research and pulling some strings, we tracked down Abdul. He was a real person with a valid license (unlike Shahad’s revoked one) who had ties to Shahad’s apartment complex. A check with our DMV contact concluded the most recent re-issue of Abdul’s license had a very different picture of the person identified by the card. We were knocking on Abdul’s door, Roy in tow and all three of us bubbling with optimism.\n\nAbdul answered and was surprised to be greeted by the police. He allowed us in and we explained the traffic stop Roy had conducted and all of the negative consequences that were about to rain down upon him for it.\n\n“Well, if he said he was you but isn’t, what makes you think he’ll show up to court for the ticket? Let alone pay the fine? You’re looking down the barrel of a suspended license at a minimum; a ton of DMV related crimes on the other side of things.” I explained. \n\nAbdul was silent a moment. A sincere look of worry creased his brow and he slowly fell back into the over-stuffed sofa he was sitting on. “Look.” He finally said. “I’m scared of this dude. I owed him for a QP and couldn’t come up with the cash. He said if I told DMV I lost my license he’d take that as payment.”\n\n“So he jumped in and took the picture when they called your name?” \n\n“Yeah. I didn’t think it would work but it did. I was just happy that dude wasn’t going to be waiving his gun around me anymore.”\n\n“What kind of gun?” Biggs asked, leaning in and a sly smile spreading across his face.\n\n_______\n\n“POLICE WITH A SEARCH WARRANT!” The burly SWAT operator in the front of the line yelled then counted quietly to twenty. “POLICE! WITH A WARRANT! OPEN THE DOOR!” \n\nAfter a few seconds of pause, the number two man in the stack rounded the first and grabbed a ram. He blew the door open on his first attempt. Biggs and I were the last to enter, after the first group had given the all clear.Shahad had been coming out of the bathroom when they apprehended him. He was seated on a kitchen chair, bound with flex cuffs and scowling at anyone that dared look in his direction.\n\n“Y’all muthafuckas gonna be hearin’ from my lawyer.” He cursed at us.\n\n“Weed in the toilet!” One of the SWAT guys yelled from a bathroom. \n\n“I guess you’ll be hearing from our lawyer too.” Biggs told Shahad. \n\nThe search was fruitful. We found a little under a pound of marijuana hidden in an economy sized whey protein container, empty bottles of anabolic steroids and several syringes, the remains of what was once a large amount of cocaine, and the pièce de résistance – a loaded .38 revolver. \n\nShahad was a convicted felon so we knew we had him by the proverbial gonads for merely possessing the gun. What we found after booking him and putting our heads to a more permanent and creative solution was that he was still only a conditional permanent resident of the US, having immigrated with his parents at the age of ten. The family had been fighting to become permanent residents for years but, thanks to our wonderful immigration system and combined with Shahad’s lawlessness, had been hampered in their efforts. \n\nThe day after his arrest, we called an agent we knew with ICE who happily took up the case. Shahad was put on an ankle bracelet and bounced around several local and federal jails while his future was being decided. We were able to get several felony convictions out of our investigation (for the gun and drug stuff – the girlfriend case was promptly tossed) and ICE deemed him “deportable.” The only hitch in the plan was the reluctance of Shahad’s home country with accepting his re-entry to their wonderful Middle-Eastern haven. Due to the hold up, Shahad was released on federal bond pending the resolution of the red tape strewn mess and his ultimate deportation. \n\nHis probation officer had the foresight to let Biggs and I know Shahad’s status and on his second day of freedom, I think it would be safe to say we were the last two people he wanted seeing him pass a dime bag to a cooperating informant from across the parking lot of his father’s apartment. He was promptly thrown back in jail and these days he is likely picking sand out of his teeth in a hut in the middle of a desert somewhere. \n",

It was day shift in the ghetto part of town and everyone was getting Baker Acted.    \n\n*A Baker Act is a State specific act for mentally ill people that allows involuntary institutionalization for people that present a danger to themselves or others, but did not commit any specific crime.*  \n\nThen we got a call for service, agency specific.  Momma's son is disrespectful.  Great, another person who wants us to parent their damn kid.    \n\nThen we find out the son is 21 years old.  Perfect.   \n\nWe roll up on scene and immediately notice that the window screen, as well as a cooking pot, is on the ground in front of the house.  I have one foot out the squad car when the woman rushes out of the house switching between screaming at her son and screaming at us.  My partner tells me to handle the guy inside while he handled the screaming mother.  All I could understand was something along the lines of \"HE ATE ALL MY FOOD AND TRIED TO BREAK IN THE HOUSE\"   \nI make contact with the 21 year old inside.  He tosses an empty box of Klondike bars across the room and complains that \"he's tired of his mom and her bullshit blaming.  Other people live in this house and they eat too.\"  Plus he buys all the groceries and even gives his mom money for drugs.  Momma is claiming he tried to break in, he's claiming that Momma damaged her own house and threw the pot.  Okay.  \n   \nEventually the son calms down and we can actually talk to him.  The woman outside has not though.  We realize that the son had been staying there 2 weeks but has a home in a neighboring town.   Finally, we get it boiled down.  Momma wants him out.  He wants his money back.  We switch them and Momma goes inside with my partner and I stay outside with the 21 year old.  He gets so angry he smashes his phone on the ground.  \nBy this time, we got one more unit as backup in case shit hit the fan, but they're not physically aggressive towards us or even each other.   \nKid starts cussing up a storm outside.  Looking for a way to solve the situation, we go to the neighbors to see if they heard him (trying to get him on disturbance).  Of course they play dumb.  At this point, we can't do anything.  We spend a few minutes laughing at the fact that all of this drama started over Klondike Bars then leave.    \n\n*Oh, but it's not over*   \n\nAbout 45 minutes later, we overhear radio traffic from city (we have a consolidated dispatch) that a woman felt in danger from her son at the same exact address we were just at.  We realize that since we couldn't kick him out, she tried the other agency.  We have the responding officer call us and we explain what happened.  No threat to either side, but the mom may be mentally ill (since she never actually calmed down and even collapsed crying at one point).  They laugh and say they'll probably be there in 20 minutes since there was a backlog in city.    \n10 minutes later she's calling the city back asking for internal affairs because of the response time.   \nAnother 5 minutes and she called back and threatened to take a lot of pills because of her \"emotional frustration.\"  The officer who was almost there responded \"Well that solves our problems.\"    \n\nWhat would this woman do for a Klondike bar?  Get Baker Acted, apparently.",

        "text": "So this happened to some of my buddies. They ship glitter for use in their fairy themed booths at Renaissance festivals around the states. They have a large white van and were traveling down Arizona.\n\nThey get stopped by border patrol, who pulls them over and asks them what they are transporting. The driver, being a smart ass, says \" fairy paraphernalia\". This of course gets their van searched.\nThe cops find all these vacuum plastic bricks in the van. \n\nNow I bet you don't know, but the way glitter is transported in bulk is in vacuum plastic bricks. Looks exactly like bricks of drugs from TV or movies. The cop grabs one and asks the driver what this is. The driver (still being a smart ass) says \"I'd like to exercise my right to remain silent\"\nSo the cop pulls out a pocket knife to open the brick. The driver says \"officer, I wouldn't do that if I were you\".\n\nI bet you don't know that when you vacuum pack a powder and then break the seal by puncturing it... it explodes...\n\nThe officer stabs the brick, which causes 5 pounds of glitter to explode all over him. The officer's partner busts out laughing and says to his partner \"oh no, you're not getting in my squad car like that\"\nSo if you're ever driving down I-10 in Arizona near the border.

        "text": "As part of my internship with a sheriff's office, I had to spend time with deputies in every job function, so real estate, writ service, warrant service, firearm permits, all of it.  One of the more exciting duties is \"saturation patrol.\"  Saturation patrol is, basically, get about 10 deputies, get a stack of old warrants, and hit the most violent and drug-infested parts of the county from 2200 - 0400.  Fun will be had by all.  You better believe all the interns were eagerly awaiting their saturation patrol night.  \n\nWhen my turn finally came, I spent the morning in court (*joy*) and in the afternoon had lunch with another intern and his family.  We then got the bus back into the city and got ready for our ride along.  We were met by the sergeant who would be leading tonight's exercises and a box of old vests.  Sarge fitted us (\"Well, better than nothing, right?\") and assigned us our cars.  Myself and the intern from earlier were placed in one car with a deputy and his partner.  \n\nThe night started out pretty slow, until another car called us for backup.  While attempting to serve an old arrest warrant, they found drugs in the house, and a few of the occupants were going to be arrested for obstruction, possession, etc.  Kids are crying, neighbors watching, the works.  My intern bro elected to go with one of the other cars and observe the booking process - he regrets that decision to this day.  \n\nAfter a while, we're back on the road, and it's approaching midnight.  The deputies are getting bored.  We're rolling down the main drag in a not-so-great neighborhood when I spot a Trailblazer pulling up next to us with no lights on.  Remember: It's midnight and the street is intermittently lit.  So I alert one of the deputies.  When we stop at a red light next to the SUV, the deputy rolls his window down, and motions to the driver.  \"Hey buddy, turn you-\"\n\nThe driver takes off through the intersection.  Hilarity ensues.  \"Holy hell,\" I think, \"did he really just do that?\"  Woop Woop, here we go right behind him.  As he turns down the side streets, the deputy in the passenger seat is having trouble getting the street names to call in.  I do what anyone with a GPS in their pocket and a data plan would do - I pull out my phone and start reading off the streets.  As we get further and further into this shithole neighborhood, I keep thinking, \"[Intern bro] is never gonna believe this!\"  \n\nNot the most exciting pursuit - the Trailblazer was barely speeding, even slowing down at intersections, but I was 19 years old, on only my second serious ride along.  So actually, it was exciting as shit for me.  The SUV finally pulls to a stop about a block away from the main street in front of a house.  Driver immediately jumps out and starts approaching the car, shouting,  \"The fuck you want??\"  Big dude.  6'5, built like Bowser.  Both deputies are out of the car before I even process what's happening with guns out.  \"HANDS AGAINST THE CAR.\"  Dude is angry, not stupid, so he complies.  Tunnel vision goes away and I realize that the entire street is lit up with blue and red lights.  Another deputy, a city cop, cop from the next municipality over, even transit police showed up.  It was cool as hell.  \n\nAfter the guy is in cuffs, a woman emerges from the house and starts barking at the deputies, \"What that fucker do this time?\"  \n\n\"He sped through a stop light after we tried to tell him to turn his lights on.  Do you know this man?\"\n\n\"That dumb motherfucker is my boyfri- **EX**boyfriend.  You wanna search his shit?  He's got weed n'shit in here.\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am, thank you.\"  ",

        "text": "I held up my credentials and started my spiel. “Hi. I’m officer EMR and this is officer Biggs. Do you think we could use your bedroom?”\n\nThe man in the door regarded me with a confused glare. Birds tweeted in the background in the few seconds of silence before he answered - his wheezing breath the only other punctuation to the strange situation. I realized he may need a gentle prod of clarification before he made up his mind.\n\n“Oh, it’s for surveillance. On your neighbor. He’s a drug dealer.” I rocked on my heels a bit while Biggs kept an eye out to make sure our target wasn’t noticing our presence. We had parked our unmarked car down the street, but our bosses weren’t allowing us to operate in a plain clothes capacity yet. We were definitely out of place in the July heat with our hoodies covering our uniform shirts. \n\nThe man’s expression finally broke into acceptance. “Sure, whatever. As long as you promise to lock up that sonuvabitch.” The piston on the screen door creaked as he shoved it open, beckoning us to enter. The man – a mid-fifties middle-Eastern gentleman – was wearing slacks and a slightly yellowed wife-beater. Biggs and I entered his living room and nodded a hello towards the two women inside. On the television, a man in some form of religious attire was talking to a large group in a foreign language. A hookah stood on the coffee table and the brown stained ceiling was testament to its frequent use. A couch and some prayer rugs rounded out the décor. \n\n“These are cops. They’re going to lock up that sonuvabitch next door.” The man barked to the women as introduction. He lumbered past us muttering, “Come, come.” We followed. \n\nBiggs, in the lead, glanced back at me and raised his eyebrows before gazing back in the direction of the living room. I knew he was trying to convey to me “did you see the girl? She’s hot…” but I just rolled my eyes and flicked my wrist in a ‘hurry-up’ gesture. The last thing we needed was to have the owner of our surveillance post becoming irate at us for flirting with his precious princess. \n\nWe were ushered into a room facing our targets home – a plainly decorated spare bedroom with a bare mattress and dusty dresser. The man pointed to the window. “Good?” He asked.\n\n“Perfect!” I replied. “Thank you so much for the assistance. Hopefully we’ll have this guy locked up and out of here for a good long time.”\n\n“Sonuvabitch come out every day! Selling, selling, selling-” he made a flinging motion as though the bags of dope our target dealt in were actually Frisbees, “- like I no know what he do! Too many car on the road! Too much trash!” The veins on his neck slowly faded back into his skin while he wheezed his way back to catching his breath. \n\n“Well… hopefully we catch him?” Biggs shot me a nervous glance and we both hoped that would ease the man’s anger a bit.\n\n“Yes, yes.” He sighed and walked out, shaking his head and muttering to himself in his language. \n\n“Guess we have a cooperator in this guy, huh?” I asked Biggs. \n\n“Maybe he’ll allow us to stay for dinner.” He pulled a desk chair over and leveled his binoculars out the window towards Chino’s house. “This is a perfect spot.”\n\nI agreed and took in the view. We were catty-corner from Chino’s and could see the front door, the entire driveway and carport on one side, and the roadway leading up the residence. We had a limitied view of both directions of the cross street, just enough to see the direction a car would turn. Cars pulling up to Chino’s would show off their plates from a mile away and if the amount of sales the homeowner had hinted at were going to go down tonight, we’d have more than enough probable cause for a search warrant on the joint. \n\nChino had long been on our radar as a repeat offender. He was one of the first cases we provided to our bosses as a perfect example of a person responsible for a disproportionate amount of crime and thus, a perfect target for our specialized repeat offender team. \n\nA former small time gang member, he had risen through the ranks due to his fondness of guns and violence. He eventually outgrew his crew of cronies and branched off on his own to start a narcotic enterprise. Rumors were rampant concerning his wares, sales tactics, and continued violence but patrol was never able to get him in a situation more compromising than driving without a license. Our foothold in his next-door neighbor’s house would hopefully provide the scalpel with which to cut his cancerous presence from the community. \n\n“Tea?” Biggs and I both were startled by the offer and turned to see the homeowner’s daughter standing in the doorway. She was probably in her early twenties, attractive and fit, and just Biggs’ type. I looked to him before answering and saw the attempt-at-suave smirk on his face. \n\n“I’m fine, thanks. Sorry for intruding in your house.”\n\n“Oh no, it’s no problem. My dad is very upset with the way things are right now. Thank you both for helping.”\n\n“Anything for a pretty lady.” Biggs was spooning it out thick. I rolled my eyes. \n\nThe girl smiled. “Just let me know if you need anything. I’ll be in the kitchen.”\n\nI took the binoculars from Biggs and took a turn staring at the house. Once the girl’s footsteps faded out of hearing, I whispered, “Really? You can’t control yourself at least until we get this numb-nuts dirty?”\n\nBiggs chuckled. “Whatever.” \n\nThe sun was quickly dropping towards the horizon when we finally had some action. Chino had exited the door in the sally port and lit up a cigarette. He kept scanning up and down the street, clearly expecting someone to roll up any minute.\n\n“I’m going to call Ellis and make sure he’s ready to stop whoever is paying a visit.” Biggs told me. Our plan was to gather intelligence on Chino’s operation – how he sold, what time of day, how frequently – then provide tag information on the buyer’s car to a nearby patrol unit who would follow them until he got a traffic charge to pull them over on. He could go about the traffic stop as though it were routine but, knowing that we had most likely just watched a drug deal go down, have the K9 start early in the process to do a walk-around while the ticket was being filled out. K9 hit, search the car, find the drugs, more charges all around and, most importantly, another nail in Chino’s coffin. \n\n“Yeah man, he’s outside now smoking a cig.” Biggs was telling Ellis. “Just make sure you mark out on something so you’re not tied up when this thing blows up, ok? We’re basically handing you a free felony case.”\n\nBiggs hung up and requested the binoculars for his turn. Chino was still pacing in the driveway. Footsteps came scampering up the hallway and the homeowner’s daughter came running in. \n\n“He’s in the driveway!” She hissed, giddy with excitement and shouldering next to Biggs and I to get a good look. Biggs leaned behind her and looked over at me, nodding his head in a “not bad” manner. I let loose a deep sigh.\n\n“You think he’s going to sell something?” The girl whispered. \n\n“Probably; he looks nervous as hell.” Biggs’ voice had dropped a noticeable octave and he replied without taking the binos from his eyes.\n\n“Ooooh, I hope we get him.” She whisper-squealed. So now it was ‘we.’ Biggs must’ve been glowing inside.\n\nThe radio on my belt piped up. “6alpha21, self-dispatched to an accident: Elm and Main. No injuries reported, 1852 hours.”\n\n“What. The. F-“ Biggs started.\n\n“I thought you told him to mark out so he’d be available!” Brian had taken it upon himself to clean up his pending cue. I was a bit upset at this.\n\n“I did! He said he understood. He was thankful even!!” Biggs was a bit more upset than I.\n\n“Look! A car!” The girl was unperturbed by the news and had been more vigilant than either of the ‘professionals’ in the room. \n\n“Oh crap!” Biggs scrambled to get the binos up. “Tag is… victor alpha 234 charlie.” \n\nI opened my computer to run the tag for a DMV return but was stopped by Biggs before I hit send. \n\n“Wait. I know that car!” Biggs said, still studying the scene from the binoculars. I crept forward to have a better look. The vehicle, a late nineties black BMW, did look vaguely familiar. \n\n“Is that…?”\n\n“Shahad.” Biggs answered. \n\nShahad was the number two most wanted on our list of repeat offenders. He was a steroid user, cocaine and marijuana dealer, gun nut, and all around asshole. He had even somehow figured out a way to land himself on the terrorist watch list. We knew he was a player and had him slated for special attention following the Chino case. The fact the two were meeting blew my mind. Shahad lived miles away and we hadn’t known of any link between them. \n\nShahad backed into the driveway and popped the trunk. He got out, all smiles, and gave Chino a warm handshake and “bro-hug.’\n\n“Fuck this, I’m calling Ellis.” Biggs handed the binos to the girl and flipped out his phone. “Dude! What are you doing!! Chino’s still outside!”\n\nThere was a pause while he listened. \n\n“That’s not what I meant by mark out on something.” He gritted his teeth. “I don’t care if it was pending! No injuries – no rush! This is the big time, man! Oh, oh, and guess who just pulled up.” Pause. “Shahad!” Another pause. “No, Shahad. The steroid guy, with the guns and BMW. You know…” Biggs sighed into the handset. “No! Shahad! He’s a big deal, trust me.”\n\nThe rest of our station wasn’t as nerdy with the recidivist statistics as Biggs and I were. The girl lowered the binoculars and stared at Biggs as he continued on the phone.\n\n“Well, hurry the hell up, ok? He could be taking off any minute.” He glanced outside. “No, they’re still just talking. Shahad might start a pursuit if he’s holding, dude. That’s worth it, right?” Biggs looked at me with obvious exasperation. “Just… hurry.” He hung up.\n\n“He coming?” I asked. Shahad was leaning on his car now, relaxed and engaged in small talk. \n\n“No. He said he was just handing out the information exchange forms. He’s worried about getting yelled at for letting things sit in pending. This is gonna be big!” We watched for a few moments and I ran Shahad’s tag to verify the goldmine we had stumbled upon. Sure enough it was him.\n\nBiggs requested the binoculars back from the girl who returned them with reluctance. “Dude, they’re walking to the trunk.”\n\nI peeked out the window and sure enough, the duo was done with the small talk and looked to be moving on to the business portion of the visit. Shahad opened the trunk and was all smiles as he gestured to the contents. He waved his hand like a Price is Right model and stepped back to allow Chino to take in the contents with slack-jawed amazement. We couldn’t see what was inside but knew it had to be good to impress Chino to such a degree. \n\n“He’d better hurry.” Biggs urged while still gazing at the two criminals. \n\nChino looked to Shahad and said something that made them both laugh. Shahad gestured with his hands, spreading them at arm’s length and nodding his head to accentuate whatever he was saying. Chino shook his head in amazement and looked back to the trunk. He then put his hand out and slapped a complicated combination of high fives. Shahad then got a little more serious and started counting things off on his fingers. Chino nodded along, seemingly nonplussed by the negotiations. He held up a finger then hustled into the house again, leaving Shahad behind to spark a Newport. \n\n“Dude, I’m taking notes. Have you seen anything specific yet? I can’t see in that stupid trunk!” My stomach was in knots with anticipation. I knew we were on to something big. \n\n“Nothing yet, but whatever it is, we’re about to see a deal go down.”\n\nThe girl bounced between Biggs and me with nervous energy.\n\nA few minutes passed and Chino exited again, this time carrying a shoebox. Biggs, ever the observant one, yelled, “Shoebox!”\n\nChino approached Shahad and opened up the lid. Shahad made a half shrug and waved his hand in a “so-so” manner. Chino looked upset and closed the box before tucking it under his arm, took a step back and gave an inquisitive look while asking a question. Shahad pondered a moment and then answered, causing Chino to inhale sharply and look to the sky for guidance. He paced around in a circle for a minute then returned to Shahad and said something before once again retreating into the home. \n\nBiggs put down the binoculars and fiddled with the window locks. We were about fifty yards from the duo but apparently the lack of audio accompanying our shady show was getting to him.\n\n“I think my dad painted the windows shut. He’s not a very good painter.” The girl trailed off, seemingly embarrassed. \n\n“No… problem…” Biggs was putting a lot of effort into unlocking the clasp but had no luck and eventually admitted defeat. “We don’t need to hear anyway.”\n\nThere were a few beats of silence which the girl took as her cue to exit. Biggs pulled out his phone again and cursed at it. “He’d better be done and heading our way.”\n\n“It’s only been ten minutes or so.” I replied. \n\n“Yeah, but… felony!” I knew the prospect of a good case and arrest would have motivated Biggs but wasn’t so sure about Ellis. \n\nWe waited and watched Shahad smoke several more cigarettes, flicking the filters into the street as he finished. Chino finally reemerged and made his way to Shahad with a cocky strut. He opened the box for Shahad to examine and was rewarded with a smile. Shahad reached out a hand and the two shook, sealing the deal. Biggs grabbed his buzzing phone.\n\n“Get here, now.” He skipped the niceties. “What? Well, leave and come back!” He covered the handset and turned to me. “He says one of the drivers can’t find their insurance information.”\n\n“Tell him to call the guy later! This is going down!”\n\n“Dude, dude. Listen: Chino just made a deal with Shahad. He’s giving him a shoe box of… something. And Shahad is going to give Chino something out of his trunk. Stop what you’re doing, get over here, and get an awesome case. You have to.” He listened then hung up without saying anything. He raised the binoculars and breathed deeply. \n\n“So? Is he coming?” I asked.\n\n“He said he’ll be a minute.”\n\nShahad moved to the trunk and reached in. He was sorting something, moving items around just out of our sights. Chino still held on to the shoe box but seemed relaxed as he lit another cigarette. After a few moments, Shahad emerged with a black duffel bag and walked back to Chino. The two exchanged the potentially felonious vessels and smiled. There was more small talk during which I could feel my heart beating like a humming bird’s after a trip to Willy Wonka’s. \n\nShahad moved to his passenger side and opened the door, depositing the box inside before returning to Chino. Biggs’ phone buzzed. \n\n“You clear?” His eyes widened. “Get here. Now. Victor alpha 234 charlie on a black BMW two door, middle eastern male driving.”\n\nChino and Shahad concluded their meeting with another complicated hand maneuver and Chino turned to go inside his home. Shahad sparked one last cigarette as he ambled back to his car. Brian was only two blocks away. Shahad’s car started and began to pull out of the driveway. Biggs grabbed the radio, flipped to a side-band channel, and gave Ellis the update.\n\n“Ellis: he’s heading… East. East on Oak Street.” \n\n“10-4, I’m one off.” Ellis replied. \n\n“Oh, we got this, we got this.” Biggs urged. The car pulled past our vantage just as we saw the cruiser crest the hill in the other direction. “Get him, get him.” Biggs rasped. \n\nThe cruiser passed us and a moment later Chino exited the house to smoke. We watched as he wandered about, relaxed and content. \n\n“He should have him stopped. Why isn’t he marking out?” I asked, not taking my eyes off Chino. \n\n“Don’t know, man.” Biggs was stone faced. \n\n“Biggs, EMR, you copy?”\n\nBiggs swept the radio to his mouth. “Yeah. You get him?” \n\n“Uhhh… I think I see him.”\n\n“Pull him then. We have Carroll. We saw a deal.”\n\n“I’ll see if I can find a reason.” Ellis replied. \n\nBiggs deflated a bit. He looked to me with confusion. “Does he not know about Carroll stops?” \n\nI shrugged a reply. Fourth amendment intricacies were often unexplored by the rank and file patrol officers. \n\n“Biggs.” Ellis came back. \n\n“Go ahead.” \n\n“I… I lost him.” \n\nThe radio slowly dropped from Biggs’ mouth and a look of disgust creased his face. \n\n“I’ll be back at the accident if you need anything.”\n\nI shook my head in amazement and watched Chino flick his butt into the street. Biggs sat down on the bed. \n\n“Well?” The girl asked from the door.\n\n“About that tea…” I answered. \n",

        "text": "So you've read a few of my stories by now and know that I'm still new but I'm getting the hang of things, having issues here and there, but nothing major just, newbie stuff I guess.\n\nSo the reality of my job finally hit me, what am I dealing with, who am I dealing with, who exactly are these people, what will you do in the situations that arise in your position?\n\nI had to go home, take a deep breath and sit down.\n\nSo here it is. \n\nIt's night shift, it's quiet and fairly easy going. Me and my FTO are sitting in the cluster and we had just finished med call when we get an intercom from my pod which isn't unusual as inmates often call out to us for minor stuff. We get a call and they say, \"I need help, he needs help.\" So we cut the lights on and I go running in and look into the cell and see an inmate stiff as a board, shaking and foaming at the mouth. I called the medical code and responding staff and medical come running in within 60 seconds and they do their thing. I find out that he was completely unresponsive, not breathing ect. They get him to medical and get him up and running again. I find out from someone he could have died. I mean, if the cell mate hadn't have known would I have seen all that happening in a poorly lit dark cell? Would he have survived if we didn't know what was going on? \n\nThis really struck home for me, I know it may not be the most exciting medical story but it really brought the reality of the situation to me of my position. It dawned on me that these guys in here don't have their family to notice when things aren't right, we are 911 to them.\n\nAnother situation, violent inmate.\n\nWe are getting inmates ready to head somewhere for the day when evidently one of the inmates didn't like it. He starts getting loud, throwing his hands around, stepping forward toward the large desk. One of the officers with us handled him very well and talked him down, but I've never seen someone flip their switch like that. It could have become a very bad situation, we could have had to arrest him. But he talked him down and calmed him down. \n\nI'm not sure how I would have handled that situation if I was alone. I mean I haven't had that type of training yet, but I mean, what could have happened?\n\nI mean, I talk to these inmates everyday, I converse with them, we laugh together and joke around. But when it comes down to the end of the day they are in there for a reason and I guess I never realized exactly who I was dealing with or thought about it. It's been something I've been thinking a lot about.\n\nI'm gonna love my job, I'm gonna stay with it, but I feel like this is something anyone in these types of jobs deal with.\n\nThanks for reading.",

        "text": "I'm pretty fresh out the academy (4 months) and I've switched to a new Training Officer each month. This month is my first month of morning watch and I'm still learning how to perfect my spot light skills. \n\nWell at the beginning of the month my TO was telling me everything he expects of me and how strict he is and if he hears my keys jiggle when we're walking up to houses he's going to go insane... you know, all that tactical stuff! So the last thing he says before we leave the station is to pre position my spot light so it will be in the general area of the drivers head in front of us when we do a traffic stop. He told me that every rookie he's ever had, has \"shined that god damn fucking light\" in his eyes while he was driving and he doesn't understand why we always do that. So I laughed (in my head of course) because I could picture a rookie on his first day just lighting up my TO while fumbling around with the spotlight. I told myself I would never be THAT dumb to literally turn the spot light all the way inside our window and shine it at him.  I've made sure to preposition my spot light every day, as soon as we get in the car. It's become a routine that I'll probably never break. \n\nNow let's fast forward to last night...\n\nI'm getting pretty comfortable with this TO and he's starting to loosen up and crack little jokes every now and then. We have good conversations throughout the night while we try to stay awake. So last night we backed up a few other units on a stolen vehicle following. Once we get the suspects in custody I see all the training officers standing around our patrol car talking and laughing while me and my fellow rookies are handling all the paperwork and phone calls. After about 10 minutes we get another call to respond code 3 to an over turned car. It's about 3am, it's very dark and no ones on the road so we got there in a few minutes. But for some reason we couldn't find the over turned car. So my TO flips on his spot light and starts shining it around to check the street signs and make sure we're in the right area. I wanted to help out, so I flipped on my \"pre-positioned\" spot light and bam! The whole car lights up and the spot light is literally right in my TO's eyes. Someone must have turned my spotlight to face inside the car while we were at the stolen vehicle call. I hurry up and switch it off, hoping that he didn't notice the brightest light in the world in his eyes but the damage was done. He stopped the car, and I can honestly say I've never heard anyone curse that much in my entire life. I just ruined his eyes. We parked the car and for 10 minutes straight he was rubbing his eyes and yelling something about how \"you God damn rookies always do this shit! No other TO's have this fucking problem. It's only me! How fucking hard is it to shine the light anywhere else in this world except in my eyes?!?!\" I didn't know what to say. I knew that was a rhetorical question so I just stayed silent and looked straight ahead. I couldn't believe I shined the light in his eyes. I told myself I would never do that and those other rookies must have been idiots. But now I was that idiot. All I could do was apologize and hope that he would be able to see that it was an accident. He didn't say a word to me for the rest of the night. Five hours of complete silence to finish off the shift. \n\nAnd to make things worse, it was the end of the week for us so he completed my weekly ratings at the station before we went home. I didn't get a chance to read it but I'm hoping he doesn't put my little spot light incident in there! ",

        "text": "So we get a call from dispatch letting us know that we have one of our frequent flyer drunks coming in and he's being combative as usual. On this particular evening it's just me and one other officer working the intake desk, but we've dealt with this guy before so no big deal. I hear the Sally port gates opening, so I send the other officer out to meet the arresting officers and to determine if we're going to have to force this guy out of the car. A few seconds later I see my officer walking in with the new inmate. That's a good sign, maybe we won't have to put him in the restraint chair for once. I go through our usual spiel asking about any contraband on their person or anything of the sort, he's being a smartass but is still answering my questions. I then proceed to take his cuffs off and have him spread his feet and place his hands on the counter in front of him. The regular body pat down didn't turn up anything, so I move to his feet. Nothing out of the ordinary here either, so I move to take his cowboy hat off. I get his hat off and as I'm about to stick my hand into it, I spot something round and black in the leather headlining of his hat. Damnit, this clown has black tar heroin on him. I'm about to reach in to grab it when all of a sudden I see the black ball move and I see a flash of red on it. Fuck this, it's a black widow. It was only after I recognized it as a spider that I saw the webs in the hat. (Just for some extra information, I've been bitten by three Brown recluse spiders and I am now terrified of any spiders I see.) I just let out a yell and started banging the hat against the floor trying to get the spider to fall out so that I could kill it with extreme prejudice. One of the arresting officers heard me and pulled out his ASP thinking that I had gotten into a scuffle with the inmate. The inmate was too drunk to realize what was going on and just started yelling at me for abusing his hat. The officer looked confused when he finally reached me and saw what was going on, so I told him about the black widow. He apparently also hates spiders because he managed to knock the spider out of the hat and then proceeded to beat the life out of it with his ASP. I threw in a few curb stomps for good measure. So this is why I now exercise my Sergeant powers and make my officers do the searches now.",

        "text": "In my short time riding shotgun with the fine men and women of law enforcement, I've gathered a bit of a stigma. I'm a bad lack charm. Not that bad shit happens when I'm out on a ride, but invariably by the end of the shift my officer will have apologized more than once for the lack of action on the shift, especially since I always take full graveyards. I'm content to live this way, sitting for 8 or 9 hours for a 20-minute incident that may or may not have made it onto COPS. I feel as though that's representative of the job I want to spend my career doing, and midnights while I'm still young. A fine gentlemen I met one evening, however, gave me reason to question this logic ever so slightly, as well as to educate me, a beer-swilling-liquor-sipping college student, about the art and dedication to true drinking habits.\n\nHaving spent another dead hour with Scotts (see [Bitch Can Have It, Straight Up] (https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheSquadCar/comments/3e1en0/ridealong_bitch_can_have_it_straight_up/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link), the bored pair of us cruised through a neighboring sector that housed some subsidized housing we'd already been through more than once that night. While at times she was quiet and reserved, she still had some girlish youth just below the surface of her personality - a trait that frequently revealed itself in 3AM Bruno Mars singalongs on the radio. It was in the midst of the 3rd or 4th rendition of the same floaty pop track that the radio burst in with quick static. \n\n\"215 to Dispatch.\" \"215, go ahead.\"\n\"I have a vehicle that I'm trying to catch up to, currently southbound on Morris, we're paralleling on Davis. Speeds estimated 50 miles per hour.\"\n\nScotts immediately slapped the radio dial and jammed the gas. \"You got your belt on?\" I hadn't taken it off except for my one piss break of the night so far, and I proudly patted my safety gear. \"Dispatch, 212, show us assisting. Approaching westbound at intersection of Morris and River.\" Dispatch acknowledged her outburst. Unfamiliar with the area, I asked what the big problem was. \"Is it residential? Through a projects, lots of pedestrians? What's bad, aside from he's running?\" Scotts came back, as she pounded the Interceptor through a pothole-laden intersection at full clip, \"It's resi, but nice. By now (it was about 0330) it'll be deserted, probably. Big issue, Morris is one way, and that way is northbound. Our guy-\" She was cut short as she swerved between two pickups -\" - as you may have head, is not northbound. This is the problem.\" Scotts got to a light and took a careening right - I got a glimpse of the sign for Morris St.\n\nAbout a block up the street the radio came through again - \"215, show me out with that southbound traffic. Got him stopped.\" Scotts exhaled and began using the brake pedal at stop signs. They were't what I would call liberal applications, so I continued to  call \"Clear right\" like before when we had run code to false alarm shooting earlier that night. We arrived to find a facefull of headlights, pointed the wrong way down a fairly sizeable street - large enough to support two-way traffic. A quick look around told me that we were, in fact, still on one-way Morris, and the suspect was indeed facing the wrong direction.\n\nThe gentleman, a mid-60's African American, was seated at the wheel, retreiving his paperwork. Car 215's occupants lingered at the rear. The passenger, the precinct's one FTO, was having a smoke in the cover position off the back corner. I'd talked to him at roll call - he was the only one there who came from a similar place as me, knew my high school and such. He'd arrived to his shift in a lowered Hummer H2 with chrome wheels. A character for sure. The driver was the rook. The only other female contingent of the shift, she was more gruff than Scotts, maybe due to the added stress of learning the job. Boot was keeping a closer eye on the uncle from the BBQ (you know the kind I mean) and Hometown stood to the rear enjoying his Marlboro. Scotts and I took up a position in between the noses of her cruiser and Uncle's Caddy.\n\nUncle eventually produced a license and some other piece of paper that caused Boot to query FTO Hometown as to its authenticity. As the pairing debated, Scotts piped up with the old favorite line, \"So what's going on tonight, bud?\" It was at this exact moment that any hope that this poor man had of going home evaporated instantly. \"Wweeeeellllll......\" he began, \".......I'sa picking up some things from the church, finna take 'em home, gotta get them set up for the party Thrussday. Thursday. Scuse me.\" Uh-oh, I immediately think to myself. Boozer behind the wheel. He's going home with a new set of bracelets. I looked over at Scotts, still intent on Uncle BBQ. \"My partner said you were going the wrong way down the road, pretty good clip. That true?\" The man quizzically looked around. \"Sure, I was going a little fast, but it's nighttime, ain't nobody out here this streets?\" His statement ended in the cadence of a question. \"You're right,\" said Scotts, \"but Morris is one-way and you went the wrong way down it.\" The color drained from Uncle BBQ's face. \"Aw, oh, now that....sheeeeit. I didn't mean for that to happen....aw hell....\" he began to mumble, perhaps finally realizing the gravity of the situation.\n\nBoot and Hometown returned from their car. \"Who's the car registered to?\" asked Boot. After a long pause, Uncle BBQ responded \"Well, it's technically the church on paper, but I'm the pastor, and I get to say how I use it, so it's kinda mine.\" He chuckled at this for some reason, perhaps finding humor in the odd arrangement. The FTO popped his door. \"Step on out, man.\" He said. \"Walk to the back.\" Uncle BBQ reached inside and retrieved a cane, upon which he relied heavily to make it the 5 or so feet to the truck of the Cadillac. Boot chimed back in. \"Anything to drink tonight, sir?\" We all braced for the form-reply 'two drinks, I swear!', but this guy surprised us. Uncle BBQ took about 2 or 3 minutes to charge up his answer. It started as a low hum, followed by a pursed-lip *mmmm*, and a long exhale. Written, it would likeley resemble this - \n\nHAmmmmm..................mmm....m.m.m.......*mmmmmmmmmmmm*......\"Well...........if I'm honest.............\"\n\n\"Won djrink.\"\n\nThe poor guy couldn't have made more of a hash of either word. To boot, he didn't even try to sidle the standard 2-drink number in there. He went full-on, bald-faced, going-for-gold with his lie. I admired his conviction to his story, as it clearly ran extremely deep.\n\n\"Officceerrs........................I swear to you. Won djrink.\"\n\nUp until this point, I'd never heard the word 'drink' with a soft 'j' sound, and I assumed neither had Scotts, because when we made eye contact, it was all we could do to not go \"This dude is fucking pounded.\" Boot stepped up and started to explain the field sobriety tests to the very jovial and cooperative Uncle BBQ, and FTO Hometown came over to talk shop.\n\n\"What's the dish?\" asked Scotts. Around another Marlboro, Hometown regaled us. \"Boot's driving. See the guy go across in front of us on a cross street at maybe 30, whatever. We're bored, slide in behind to run his plate. He sees us turn in behind him, like 3 blocks, and he dips a right, straight onto Morris. Idiot.\" Scotts and Hometown laugh as Boot starts her pen test. \"We blue-lighted and called it, tried to catch up on Davis. Saw through some buildings that he was slowing down, so we popped over and got in behind him half a block before right here. Once we were behind him he shut it right down. Kinda weird.\" He punctuated the ending with a long drag. \"Could he have been tossing something out the window,\" I added, trying to be helpful, while really suggesting more headache. Hometown shook his head. \"No way. Seeing him now, the guy is way too gone to come up with that plan.\"\n\nIn the background, Boot was giving our inebriated Uncle the heel-toe walk. Even if the stripe was a foot wide, this guy was going to tank the test and he knew it. He begun to just ask to be cuffed and taken to jail, but still vehemently defended his one drink tally. Hometown turned to him after one such outburst and asked for consent to search, which Uncle BBQ was happy to provide. It didn't take long for him to unearth what to this day was the largest bottle of gin I had ever seen.\n\nNow, look. I go to college. I've been to frats and ragers. I've been inside the ABC store with my dad. You ever watch a car race, and the guy that wins gets the world's biggest freaking champagne to dump on his buddies? This was nothing compared to those. If you've ever made homebrew and seen a full-size carboy, this thing was at least twice as big. It took Scotts and the FTO to get it out of the backseat. The top third or so had been consumed, but that could have easily been a liter of raw spirit. Uncle BBQ began to laugh. \"I done said one, I ain't said how beeeeg! E-ha-ha-ha-haaa!\" Boot quickly Mirandized him and put him in the back of the car. Our motley crew loaded up and headed over to the jail, to dispose of our bevved up customer.\n\nUpon arrival, Uncle BBQ was able to walk all the way through booking and all the essential areas with no assistance. This feat, as we would soon discover, was truly incredible, becuse while he'd blown a mere 0.20 in the field, his blood number in lockup was an astonishing 0.22 half an hour later. How he could even form sentences was beyond most of the jail staff, let alone him still having the ability to walk in a coherent fashion. Even the FTO was impressed.\n\nFrom that day on, my roomate has venerated Uncle BBQ as the god of drinking, and aspires to be like him on his Friday benders. Only I know that that man can never truly be surpassed.",

        "text": "So there I am, working night shift (1800-0600) on a particularly hectic night. I'm in the control room when I hear our 2 female dorms exchanging some words through the doors. I make my way over to see what's going on because I hate for people to be yelling in the jail, it makes it hard to hear other things going on. I get to the cells and see 2 females yelling at each other about some guy on the outside. I tell them both to cool it or I was going to write them both up for causing a disturbance. They settled down after a few minutes and sulk back to their bunks. All is good in the hood for now, so I make my way back to the control room. After about 5 minutes in the control room, our inmate intercom goes off and I see it's one of the females calling. Long story short, the other female inmate that she was arguing with had just flashed a shank at her through the window on the cell door and told her that she was saving it for her. Shit, now I have to go and do a shakedown. I get 4 female officers and 1 male officer to go with me to perform the shakedown because this particular female inmate is violent towards everyone. We get to the cell and see that it's being flooded. Fuck, she somehow found out that we were going to shake her down, cell extraction time. I know the inmate won't come out because she doesn't like being told what to do. I give her the 3 commands to come out and cuff up, but like I suspected, she refuses and responds with \"Come and get me motherfuckers!\" Well, she asked for it. I stack up in front of the door with the capture shield and the female officers stacked up behind me. I radio for the door to be opened and the first thing I feel is hot water splashing off of my shield (She filled up some shampoo bottles with boiling water and was trying to bounce them off of the ceiling so that it could fall on us and burn us). I then see a 2nd bottle flying our way and I just think \"Screw this, I'm not about to get burned\" I rush her with the shield and pin her between the bunk and the wall. The female officers right behind me grab a hold of her and proceed to take her down, so I move out of their way. After about 10 seconds I see that they're struggling to get her into restraints, so I jump in to help. We're in about 3 inches of water and having a hard time holding onto her because she had shampoo all over her. We eventually get her secured and have to carry her out kicking and screaming into our detox cell all while being yelled at by other female inmates saying that I hit her like a man and that I shouldn't have gotten her with the shield. Once she's secured into the detox cell, I make my way into her cell and end up finding a razor blade, a sharpened toothbrush, and a commissary spork that had been turned into a slashing weapon. This wasn't the first time I had dealt with this female, and she always puts up a good fight.",

        "text": "This is going to be 3 different stories that all happened within the last couple of days.\n\nSo I am currently serving on night shift (1745 - 0600). You'd think that it would be fairly easy, and it is since final lockdown is at 2300, but obviously we still get issues.\n\n~ Wednesday Morning - 0430 ~\n\nI am serving breakfast trays to the inmates, it's early as fuck and everyone is moving slow/groggy and pretty much everyone is irritable because I had just woke them up by activating their in cell intercom and saying, \"Trays are here! You getting up for food?\" \n\nNow for breakfast on this fine morning they had a biscuit, a hard boiled egg, an apple and some grits (I think). Nobody really liked this since it wasn't a whole lot of food but oh well, you eat what you get. Well towards the end I ran out of apples since they come in a box, and like 10 of them were soft and rotten. So I let the last 8 inmates know that, \"Hey, I gotta call out to the kitchen for apples it's gonna be a few minutes before I get some down here\". Well apples show up and the last inmate got a smallish Apple that had a single, tiny spot on it, be thought that the apple was rotten to the core and was basically going to kill him.\n\nI saw nothing wrong with it, so I didn't call out for a replacement because well, there's no reason to. He got really mad and threw the apple against the wall, and then into the trashcan. He yelled a little bit and I told him to go back to his cell and he didn't like that so he yelled some more before slamming his cell door behind him. End of Report\n\nThe same morning, like I mentioned a lot of inmates were upset that there wasn't a lot of food. Well, I had one inmate yelling at me, \"Would you eat this for breakfast?! A single egg and some bread?! Huh?! Would you?! What are you going to eat when you get home?!\" Over and over and over before I finally finished serving, everything done and was able to cut the lights and walk out of the pod. Same guy also told me I was going to hell, and that I need to repent, that this job is gonna put me in hell because I was doing the devils work! All because he got in trouble for being on the phone when he wasn't supposed to be while a Cpl. was in the pod. Neither of them got into trouble (for the first part, 2nd guy got locked down for delaying and hindering a security operation) since it was so late in the shift and I honestly didn't feel like doing anymore paperwork. \n\n~ Thursday - 2030 ~\n\nI am locking down my bottle tier (we have 2 tiers) due to it being the end of their rotation and the way I lockdown is as followed:\n\n- Everyone lines up at their doors.\n- I open every other door on one side so nobody can pass contraband between cells, then I do the other side.\n\nWell I open 1, 3, 5 and 7. I see on my security panel that 5 was still open, I activated their in cell intercom and ordered them to secure their door. Well as they were shutting it, it looked like their door was just about closed so I opened cell 2, 4 and 6. Well right when I did this cell 5 opened their door and inmate from cell 6 passed something between the cells and they secured their door.\n\nSo I walk over after letting top tier out on rotation, I asked them what they passed and cell 5 said, \"Just a pencil man\" I ordered him to give it to me, he got upset but did anyway because he understood that once you pass and item from one inmate to another it then becomes contraband. Cell 6 on the other hand stood their and argued with me over the lockdown I had just issued both of them (ending on next shift at 1200, meaning they can't come out of their cell until 1200 the next day except for food). Saying I was being unfair and unreasonable because \"it was just a pencil\". \n\nWell needless to say all 4 inmates filed grievances on me, and all 4 got returned basically saying, \"don't break the rules, don't get in trouble\"\n\nYou know what they say about jail guards, if they hate you, your doing your job right!\n\nI love my job.\n",

I don’t care who your dad is; this is how you train rookies.” \n\nI sat behind the wheel of the cruiser, lips pursed and eyes wide in an effort to portray the ideal expression of “I’m respectfully intimidated” and “I relent to your superior cop-ness.” We hadn’t even made it out of the parking lot but already, my new FTO was playing up to his reputation of being a hard-ass. \n\n“Now, pull outta the lot, find a shady spot, and let’s go over your mental map of the area.” I suppressed a sigh and did as I was told. “Mental Mapping” was something I had quickly mastered with my first FTO, mostly because I knew it was his pet peeve. Maybe I’d be able to show Smitty I was at least one or two levels above pond scum on his hierarchy of respect. \n\n“You’re at Pine Tree 7-11 and get dispatched to a robbery in progress at the Cross-Street Market on Oak. How do you get there?”\n\n“Major roads or side roads?” I asked.\n\nSmitty made a noise through his teeth. “tsssk… You tell me, hot-shot.” His tongue clucked the “t’s” in hot-shot and I felt the bite of regret. I mentally pictured a layer of greenish goo laughing down at me. \n\n“Ok. Well, I’d go lights and sirens, obviously, so major roads would probably be best. Pine south to 1st Street west, 1st to Main Street north for a block, then left on Elm, right on Oak, Market will be on my…” I was having a hard time remembering which side of the street the Market was on if I was approaching from the south. I had locked up a dozen drunken idiots outside the fluorescent glowing bastion of cheap liquor and could even smell the piss stale malt liquor that seemed to sweat from the parking lot in front of it but for the life of me, I couldn’t remember if it was on the left or right.\n\n“Right?” I hazarded. \n\n“Well, at least you learned something on Midnights.” Smitty replied and scratched a note into his training log. \n\nThe radio broke the silence. “6Bravo40, start for a report of a stolen vehicle, 12505 Spring Street, unit 100. Caller states her vehicle was parked in the lot overnight and she can’t find it now. Tow file is negative for lat/long but caller is unable to provide tag information.” \n\nSmitty’s hand shot to the mike and he clicked the button on the side before the dispatched unit even had the opportunity to reply. “20Bravo20, we’ll take that: I’ve got a rookie.”\n\n“20Bravo20 10-4, oh-seven ten hours.” The dispatcher sounded bored. \n\n“You heard the lady, let’s go!” Smitty clicked on his seat belt and looked out the windshield with a smirk. I hadn’t been listening to the address as the report was far from my assigned area. \n\n“Ok. Spring, right?” \n\n“You tell me.” He shook his head and looked out the passenger window. “tsssssk.”\n\nAfter an awkward exchange with the bored dispatcher and a lengthy trip through morning rush hour, I finally pulled us into the address of the stolen vehicle report – an office park nestled in the commercial district. \n\nA short, skinny Asian female in a micro mini skirt stood on five inch heels on a sidewalk in front of the address. Her gravity defying and enhanced chest was on display like two Boar’s Head turkeys in a deli case and she scrunched her shoulders up and tilted her head to one side in an overly flirtatious manner as Smitty and I exited the cruiser. \n\n“Ma’am.” Smitty touched his eye brow with his forefinger and had a smirk on his face. He blatantly stared at the goods on display and his lack of introduction prompted me to take the lead. \n\n“I’m officer EMR, did you call about a stolen car?”\n\n“Oh, yes, thank you for helping me. I parked it here,” she pointed to the parking space she was standing near, “last night before my boyfriend and I went to the club.” She nodded in the direction of her boyfriend who was pacing back and forth fifty yards away, puffing on cigarettes in his best imitation of industrial revolution London. “Now, it’s not here!” She exaggeratedly pouted. \n\n“Do you have the tag information?” I asked, glancing in Smitty’s direction and becoming more uncomfortable with his sudden change in demeanor. He continued to stare and smirk.\n\n“Umm...” The girl looked to her boyfriend, still emitting noxious clouds. “No. Do you need it?” \n\n“Yeah, that’s kind of important. How about you give me the make and model until we figure that out?”\n\n“It’s white!”\n\n“White is the color, but I‘ll write that down. Was it a Ford? Chevy? Honda?”\n\n“Oh, I don’t know.” She glanced at her boyfriend again for assistance. He was rolling his head in an agitated circle and seemed to be intentionally ignoring her. “It’s white and has two doors and one of those things in the middle.” She made a fist off to her side and moved it around.\n\n“You mean it was a manual transmission?” I asked. Smitty was still lost in some creepy corner of his mind and was missing his cue to step in and assist me. \n\n“Yes? I don’t know… I’m not a car girl.” She giggled and batted her eyes at Smitty, seemingly in a move to avoid my further questioning. Smitty continued his coy smirk and raised an eyebrow back.\n\n“Can I talk to your boyfriend?” I asked, breaking up the flirt-fest.\n\n“What? No. He doesn’t want to… he can’t… he only speaks Korean.” The girl’s façade dropped like the curtain in a peep show and seemed to rouse Smitty from his horny daze. \n\n“We got translators we can call, y’know.” He spat at me. I pretended it was news to me but pulled out my phone to dial the number for our Language Line account. \n\n“He’s very shy!” The girl called to me as I crossed the parking lot. Her boyfriend saw me coming and shifted his weight from foot to foot in clear annoyance. He stubbed out his cigarette as I entered the code for my agency and requested a Korean interpreter on my phone. \n\n“Hi, this is officer EMR of the Cityburg Police and I’m out with a male who may have information I need to take his girlfriend’s stolen vehicle report. First off, could you ask him if he knows the tag number?” I passed him the phone with a friendly smile and he begrudgingly held it up to his ear. A moment later he mumbled something and handed it back.\n\n“He just said ‘he does.’ Would you like me to ask him what it is?” The interpreter asked me.\n\n“Yes, please.” I passed the phone back and was coming to the realization this interaction was going to test my tolerance for annoyance.\n\nThe man mumbled something again and handed me back the phone. He then took out another cigarette and lit it while glaring in the direction of his girlfriend. Smitty’s eyes were still affixed on her plunging neckline while making small talk.\n\n“He said, ‘H-Y-U-N-G 1.’ Do you need anything else?” \n\n“Yes please. Could you ask him if there was anything else unusual last night and for his information for my report? Thanks.” I passed the hot potato to the eye-rolling man. Another couple mumbles and he handed it back.\n\n“He said, ‘no, nothing’ and that his name is Hyung Lee. Do you need anything else?” I shot a skeptical glance at the man. \n\n“Yeah, actually. Can you ask him if the car is his or his girlfriend’s? I’ll find out when I run the tag but I’d like to hear it from, him.”\n\nI passed the phone to the man but instead of mumbling into it, he mumbled at me. “It’s my car man. Can’t you just give me a case number?” He blew a puff of smoke in my direction and crossed his arms, the lit cigarette still dangling from his barely parting lips. \n\n“Oh! You speak English now!” I took the phone back from him and thanked the interpreter before hanging up. “So, why’d your girl call us out if it’s your car?”\n\n“I don’t know. My car’s not here though, so will you give me a case number or not?” \n\n“Well, we need to make sure it’s actually stolen first.” I took some more information of the vehicle for my notes and returned to Smitty. \n\n“Your boyfriend speaks English! It’s a miracle!” I told the girl \n\nShe pouted a bit, pretending to be confused. “He has a thick accent though, right?” \n\n“I understood him. Why didn’t you tell me the car was his when we first started?”\n\n“Huh?” She squeaked. Her eyes widened and she glanced at Hyung again. \n\n“Never mind.” I turned to Smitty. “I got the tag. I’m going to run it and see if the tow file pops anything else.”\n\nHe nodded and looked back at the girl. His smitten smirk had mutated into a disappointed scowl and judging by the dip in the girl’s head as he growled at her, I assume he was berating her for lying to us. \n\nI ran the tag but still didn’t get a tow hit. I looked from the girl in her club attire and impractical heels and then over to Hyung, still doing his best to rid the world of clean air and realized something.\n\n“Hey, Hyung!” I yelled across the parking lot. “How’d you guys get here this morning?” \n\nHis hand slowly lowered to his side, the cigarette pinched between two fingers, and he just returned a shrug. \n\n“Ma’am? Do you remember how you got here?” I addressed the girl, not expecting an answer but from my new vantage, I noticed something I hadn’t seen before. I walked past her as she stuttered out some excuse about a taxi or bus or something and made my way to a wrought iron railing that ran in front of the office building. The ornate fixture had been torn from the ground and mangled into a gnarled knot of metal. Streaks of white paint tarnished the otherwise black-painted surface and tire tracks were still visible in the lingering dew. I waved Hyung over as I approached Smitty and the girl.\n\n“So. Who was driving when you hit the railing?” I pointed to the damaged fencing but kept my eyes on the two complainants. \n\n“What?” The girl squeaked again.\n\n“The railing? With the white paint on it? The one that was run into by a car that left those tire tracks?”\n\nThe girl’s face maintained a look of confusion but her body tensed, her arms drew into her chest and her face lost its color. Hyung just looked away and shook his head. \n\n“You guys gonna answer the man? You’re real close to getting some new accessories slapped on your wrists y’know.” Smitty’s fists were resting on his hips and his neck craned forward, leveling his laser stare over the dubious duo.\n\n“Whatever man. Do what you’re gonna do.” Hyung muttered. \n\nSmitty pulled out a pair of cuffs from his belt and began running the band through the locking mechanism making a metallic, ratcheting sound while continuing to glare. \n\n“I’ll be back in a second.” I told him. I walked away from the tension of the group and made my way around the corner of the building. The lot continued, lined with nearly identical buildings (other than the lack of mangled railing) and was vacant. Vacant, that is, other than the white Acura two door with fresh front end damage parked at the bottom of the hill. I verified the tag and returned to the silent gathering. I requested and was granted the girl’s identification and went back to the cruiser. I exited a few pen strokes later. \n\n“Ma’am; this is a summons for obstruction of justice. You’ll need to sign here and I’ll give you a copy. Your court date will be in approximately thirty days.” I passed her my clipboard with the ticket attached. She snatched it away and glared at me and Smitty as she signed. She then passed it back and said something that sounded like an angry comment towards Hyung in Korean. \n\n“Now, I’ve got a second summons here for hit and run. I’ve left the name field blank. If I don’t get something to put in there, we may need to sort this thing out in front of a judge: all three of us.” I pointed to the girl and Hyung then to my own chest. \n\n“Fuck you, Hyung!” The girl squealed. “He said he was still too drunk to drive this morning so he made me do it. I can’t drive…” Words failed her but she flailed a fist around in the approximate area a manual transmission shifter would be. “RRRARGH! Put my name down. This is it though, Hyung. I’m through! No more lying for you!!”\n\nHe contemptuously spit on the ground but refused to look in her direction. I completed the summons then consulted my pocket code book and pulled another summons to fill out too. \n\n“What! What else are you writing me for?!?” The girls whined. \n\nI held up a finger, indicating she needed to give me a moment. I then passed her the clipboard. “Sign that top one for the hit and run, then I’ll take the clipboard back, thanks.”\n\nShe scratched her name again; I ripped out her two copies, and then turned to Hyung. “Sir; this is a summons for spitting in a public area. It is a pre-payable offense but if you wish to appear in court, your court date will be approximately thirty days from now.” I passed him the clipboard and he regarded it as though it was a photo of his conception – with disgust and confusion.\n\n“Whaaa! Spit?!? I spit all the time!” \n\n“Well, when you do it in front of a cop, you run the risk of being charged for it.” The clipboard hovered at his belly level and the fire burning behind his eyes made me feel a bit warmer somehow. He then snatched it from my hand and put the pen to paper, making a mark I assumed was his signature. His now ex-girlfriend stifled a laugh behind her tiny hand.\n\n“I’ll be in touch with the property management and pass along your information for insurance purposes. They’ll be in touch to repair their fence.” With that I spun on my heel and got back in the cruiser. The other three lingered a moment. Smitty was the first to break away, hopping in the seat next to me and keeping tabs on the girl as she sauntered away in the opposite direction of Hyung’s car. Hyung stood and watched her as well, then studied his summons before turning to make his way back to his car. \n\nI looked to Smitty. “Are we good?”\n\nHe looked back to me with a huge grin plastered on his face. “She’s single now!” Clearly there were things more important in life than rookies solving crimes.\n",

        "text": "** I posted this to /r/IDontWorkHereLady and they suggested I post it here since you guys would like it. **\nI will try to keep this as short as possible. I don't think it's a traditional type of story but it definitely seems to fit.\n\nI am a 911 dispatcher for a mid sized Mountain US Police dept. Part of the training is to do a ride along with both the fire and police departments since we all dispatch for both. I did my fire ridealong (most intensely boring 24 hours of my life, and I am an EMT and got to do some patient care) with no odd events. My PD ridealong came a month and a half later when I started training dispatching PD.\n\nI had no previous law enforcement experience whatsoever. I am not a law enforcement type. I am a friggen dispatcher, 40 and starting to pudge around the middle. The first four hours was a wonderful learning experience. lots of great calls, nothing really bang bang but some interesting ones.\n\nWe get a call halfway through to go to a fight between two drunk women in front of a Safeway. We get there from less than 3 blocks away and there they are, 2 drunk chicks pulling hair and scratching each other while 2 guys are starting to get chippy with each other about ten feet away, I think their boyfriends.\n\nMy officer's cover unit shows up just as the guys start to throw punches, so they go right for them since the girls were stopped and circling each other. The girls never even saw us arrive. When the one closest to me (standing idly by the patrol car I arrived in) sees the cops go try to break up the guys fighting, she BOLTS, I mean like a gazelle with pepper spray up her ass. She takes off towards the projects (which are right behind me) and runs, full force, without ever even seeing me straight into my chest and arms. I am not a tough guy or a cop type, like I said, but I am six foot eight and 245. Proof available if you think I am full of shit (I only say that because I want you guys to believe this, because this shit HAPPENED). She fell like a sack of beans and I sort of smothered her and yelled at Gary if I should keep holding her. The officers got her detained, turns out she had several warrants and the whole event became a kind of urban legend to tell the newbies in dispatch before ridealongs over the next couple of years.\n\nFast forward 2 years and I do another ridealong, again with Gary (our families have become really close and our kids are the same age). I try to do ridealongs every six months just for the fun and keeping the relationships I have good with the officers.\n\nOur first call of the night - FIRST CALL- was for a shoplifter with a disturbance at Albertson's. Some girl tried to steal, was contacted by loss prevention and started to fight with them. As we pull up in front of the store with the passenger side of the car to the curb, I hop out wanting to see the tussle.\n\nI hear a loud bang and see a woman run into the half open automatic door. She had gone too fast into it and mashed her face into it. She squeezed out through the opening and ran, full force, once again into my chest and open arms. Again, I swallowed her up and just sort of laid on top of her until Gary could cuff her.\n\nIt didn't dawn on me, but Gary recognized her right away. He ran her ID and confirmed it. Same EXACT female ran straight into the exact same non cop and was again detained on several warrants for theft from merchant, burglary and contempt.\n\nHappened last week and I still can't believe it.",

        "text": "Get a 911 call for very loud music on a main street (lanes of traffic each direction), when I show up there is a full blown setup for a party of some sort, except there are a few issues.  There was a full sized grill taking up a street side parking spot, there were two long folding tables, placed end to end with chairs that are literally in the lane of traffic, and there is a DJ that has two speakers about the size of truck tires blasting \"music\" which I could hear from several blocks away.  I literally had to plug my ears as I walked up and yelled at the DJ (not because I was angry, but because I could not hear myself talk) to turn it off.  \n\nRight away a middle-aged black male came out of a home on the block near the party setup and began to yell at, \"what the hell you doin here? We allowed to do all dis!\"\n\nI knew right away that this was going to require a gentle touch, so the convo went something like this:\n\n* *What kind of party is this, sir?*\n* Trunk party.\n* *Ok, the music has to be turned down because we are getting calls from blocks away for it, if your neighbors across the street can hear it, then it is too loud.*\n* yeah, music turned down, no problem.\n* *Do you have any permits for what you are doing?*\n* we don't need no permits, listen offissa, do I need to call your captain to get you out of here?\n* *You can do as you please, but as of right this moment, you need to turn the music down, move the chairs, tables and grill out of the street, all of that posses a clear safety concern.*\n* If I call your lieutenant do you think he'll be happy that you are here barking orders at me.\n\n**At this point, I was speaking as calmly as possible and there were a few others persons there helping setup the party whom I have arrested before for various things.**\n\n* *Sir, you can call whoever you believe you need to, I have a supervisor coming here right to talk to you.*\n* Good! Ahhhhriaight then, I don't need to be talkin to you, you can't make no decisions worth anything, so get on.\n* *Ok sir, please start moving the tables, chairs and grill, and please make sure the music is down.*\n* whatever cop.\n\n**A few minutes later my direct supervisor shows up, we don't exchange words at all, he goes up to the talk to the same guy, who proceeds to have the following convo:**\n\n* Listen sarge, you need to educate yo offissa's, this guy told me he was going to shut me down, told me this ain't happenin and told me that he wasn't gettin me any supervisors and that he was the law.\n* *Ok, sir, you need to start moving these chairs, tables and grill, all of this posses a safety concern for your guests and patrons, what time is this going to be over?*\n* It'll be over when it'll be over! You know I told him to call a supervisor and he refused!  Told me he doesn't have to!  Doesn't he know I am a community leader that works with your bosses?  I'll call the captain right this moment and get him reassigned!\n\n**during this exchange, the locals decided to start saying nonsense, one guy started calling me a rookie, even though I arrested him well over 10 years ago for narcotics, guess he forgot.**\n\n**Sgt finished up and they started doing what he/I told them to do in the beginning, I asked who that guy was and I was told he comes to the meetings constantly and complains about the dumbest things, things that we cannot even remotely do anything about (trash, realestate issues, etc) and that I should disregard the entire thing since he's words are about as hollow as it gets.**\n\nThe issue I saw here is a larger one, the fact that this \"community leader\" only wanted to drop names of people he thought would make me flinch or allow him to do things he was otherwise not allowed to do, which were clearly unsafe, paints a very clear picture of the distrust and manipulation that occurs on the *community* end of the police-community relationship.  \n\nI was told that he only shows up to these meetings in order to get names, business cards, phone numbers and then try to bully officer's on the street in order to get what he wants - essentially get away with illegal activity, or get preferential treatment for doing something which others in the community would be unable to do lawfully.  \n\nI was told to keep track of the situation since it was in my AO, unfortunately I got busy with other happenings and was unable to go back to the party to see if how it worked out.

        "text": "Ok, so this is a collection of stories from our medical isolation unit. This is where we keep the suicidal, the contagious and the inmates that are too crazy to be kept in general population.\n\n\nInmate #1 was off his rocker, an Indian man that snapped while in custody. He would growl like an animal, run around his cell naked for days at a time and would often become violent during the few occasions that we needed to open his cell door. Well one night I was posted to cover his suicide watch. That basically means I sat in front of his door watching him for eight hours making sure he didn’t commit any self-harm. Minutes after I sat down he began to vigorously paw at himself. Being the good C/O I am I had to sit there and watch him jump up and down masturbating less than two feet away from me. With an excited squeal he came all over the window right in front of my face. To make things worse he drew pictures and smeared it all over the window, I his captive audience. The next few weeks after that he would hoot and hump the window whenever I would walk near his cell.\n\nInmate #2 was just as crazy but at least he could speak English and in moments of clarity he would typically respond to our commands. Well one day he was acting up again and I was called to assist. So a few other officers, my Lt. and I showed up and the Lt. started trying to talk to him. Almost immediately the inmate screamed “Fuck you Lt. Cumface!”. He rolled on his back, flung his feet over his head and started blowing himself in front of God and everybody. It was as awkward but no one was able to look away.\n\nInmate #3 isn’t as funny as the other two. He assaulted an officer and was put into seg. He did so bad in there the doctor’s ordered him to med iso, where he was off and on suicide watch over the next few months until he got transferred to a mental hospital for the criminally insane. One day he was ordered back onto suicide watch and he refused to dress out and put on the suicide smock. It is basically a thick tear resistant blanket with holes cut into it for him to wear while everything else is removed from the cell. He continued to refuse and became aggressive so we laid him down on the floor of his cell and used medical scissors to remove his clothing. The only reason I am telling this story is that that was the day it wasn’t weird anymore. Forcing a man to the ground and cutting off his clothes isn’t a normal workplace activity, I remember thinking “This should feel a lot weirder”. But it was the day that it shifted to yep just another day at work.\n\nInmate #4 wasn’t in med iso at first. I was doing a health and welfare check along the upper tier when the inmate stopped me. “Hey C/O check this out.” Curious I walked over to his bunk and he started telling me about popping a pimple on his penis. When I asked him why I should care, he grew frustrated and pulled his pants down. Hanging from his crotch was bloody mangled hamburger of a mess. Somehow he had gotten the idea to give himself a piercing with a pencil and it had gotten infected. The “pimple” had been an abscess and he almost tore his manhood in half. The strangest part was how calm he was, I was freaking out more than him.\n\nSo that’s all for now but if you want to hear more let me know, something crazy happens every day back in Med Iso.\n",

        "text": "So yesterday (Thursday), I got a call at my desk to send out an inmate to video visitation (which is no more than 10ft across the cluster from my pod). So I absent mindlessly sent him without a pat down. That was my first mistake. So about 30 minutes later I hear the first door open and he comes into the box, door closes and I see he has some papers in his front jumper pocket. \n\nNow mind you, he walked past 2 other officers to get back plus the officer who supervises the video visitation room. So I don't think anything of it.\n\nAbout 3 minutes later I get a call from the officer in the cluster and he has me send the inmate back out, so I send him out and about another 5 minutes he calls back and this was our conversation.\n\nOfc - Be completely honest, did you pat him down when you sent him over to the video visitation?\n\nMe - Uh, no I didn't. I did it without thinking.\n\nOfc - Well now we have a massive problem, while he was over in visitation he was called down to medical. Well a nurse just called and said he may have a weapon on him. 1st Sgt. Is out here patting him down now, they found a shank in another inmates front pocket and it looks like they may have found one in his pocket as well.\n\nMe - Oh ... Fuck ... Um, shit ...\n\nOfc - Exactly, do you understand the severity of the situation right now? \n\nMe - ...... Yeah\n\nOfc - I'm not sure how this will play out but it's not good I'll get back to you *hang up*\n\nNow at this point I'm like screaming fuck over and over in my head but trying to keep a straight face so my inmates don't see me stressing.\n\nAbout an hour passes and the inmate comes back into then pod, straight faced, I pat him down good this time and found nothing so I sent him straight to his cell.\n\nDuring lunch I went back out to the cluster and all I saw was like 6 officers in the cluster laughing as hard as they could at me.\n\nEvidently, this is a prank the FTOs play on their trainees when they fuck something up, they get a well behaved inmate to play along.\n\nTL;DR My FTO is an ass hole who caught me not patting down an inmate, got inmate to play along to a sick, SICK joke.\n\nEdit: just to clarify I'm not butt hurt over it, I had a good laugh but yes it was a great lesson learned. I will never make that mistake again, and I'm glad this happened as a joke instead of someone getting seriously injured or worse due to my negligence",

Whatever’s easiest for you will be great.”\n\n“Were those tones?” She asked. \n\n“Um… yeah, why?”\n\n“You suddenly got distracted.” She sighed. “Well, I’ll come up with something and keep a plate warm for you. I’m assuming now you’ll be home late?”\n\nThe dispatcher came across the radio a moment later. “3Alpha60, 5Bravo10, 5Bravo11, 2Charlie30, start for the 300 hundred block of Hampton Place for a stabbing.

Does that sound good?” She was suddenly chipper again. \n\n“Yeah, you know I love me some dumplings!”\n\n“Do you also love running code while talking to your wife about dinner?”\n\n“What? No, I… I’m just going to swing by and-”\n\n“I know, I know. Go do your job, love. I’ll see you whenever you get home. Catch a bad guy for me!”\n\nI told her I loved her back and hung up, finding it much easier to weave through traffic with my now singular distraction of “not being obliterated by another distracted driver.”\n\nA couple minutes later I pulled past the idling fire engine and ambulance and into the neighborhood where the call came in. I was the third officer on scene and noticed the shift supervisor hopping out of his car just ahead of me. \n\n“Why is fugitive here?” He asked by way of greeting. I had worked with him in the past and he was never known for his social etiquette. \n\n“Just in the neighborhood and figured you might need the language assistance.” The neighborhood was primarily Central American immigrants and I knew the squad working only had one Spanish speaker. \n\n“Good call.” He replied, scanning the neighborhood and the gaggle of onlookers. Cops weren’t an unusual sight, but the now five cop cars that had arrived with lights and sirens blaring were. The presence of the idling fire apparatus only further piqued their interest. \n\n“Should we go take a look?” He asked as he started off without me in the direction of the call. I followed behind and we were greeted at the door to the second floor apartment by a rookie. His face was without color and his hand was shaking almost as much as his voice as he gripped his radio microphone, obviously about to give an update out over the radio. Instead, he told his boss directly. \n\n“I… he’s… dead?” he reported. The Lt slouched a bit and let out a long sigh. I knew it was more for the amount of headache that was about to rain down upon him than it was for the loss of life. \n\n“Step aside, let me have a look.” The Lt entered the apartment and I still tagged behind him. The rookie nodded to me with an inquisitive look, perplexed by my presence on the still active scene.\n\nNick was taking notes over the body which was sprawled on the floor with a still slowly expanding pool of blood underneath. There were obvious signs of a struggle – bloody hand prints on the white walls, broken beer bottles that had tumbled onto the floor, flipped chairs and a butterfly knife on the floor, opened wide and stained red with blood. The victim had been sliced across his neck – the wound so deep and open it appeared to be another mouth, toothless and lower than the real deal. His lifeless eyes stared into the kitchen and over the former contents of his veins, now creeping across the linoleum. \n\n“Nick?” The Lt asked.\n\n“We got the caller in one of the cruiser’s out front. He’s drunk as all hell and not speaking much English. What I could get was he came in and found this place like it is now. Not much more to go on.” Nick checked his watch and scribbled on his note pad again. \n\n“Charlie1. Start helo and keep K9 rolling. I’m going to need more units for scene control. Alert the watch commander we have a good homicide. Send in rescue to confirm he’s dead.” He sighed again after addressing his radio. “You mind getting some more outa the caller?” He asked me. \n\n“Not a problem!” I jumped over the bloody footprint on the foyer tile I had missed coming in and headed back outside. The rookie was out front, breathing the fresh air and looking like he was in shock. \n\n “First murder?”\n\n“Yeah.” He replied breathily. \n\n“They get easier. Where’s the caller guy?” He pointed to an idling cruiser and I made my way down to it as more cars came screeching up. “Mind if I have a chat with your fare?” I asked the driver.\n\n“Have at it. He’s freaking out though, can’t stay in one language.” He rolled down the window and I introduced myself. The overwhelming stench of old beer and body odor erupted out the window and the caller, Miguel, introduced himself as well. He was wide-eyed and fidgety, and I had to ask him the same question a few times before he could maintain a long enough attention span to answer. \n\n“Did I see anyone? No, no. Just Chepe.”\n\n“Who’s Chepe?”\n\n“The dead guy.”\n\n“How do you know he’s dead?”\n\n“He looked dead. And El Guapo said he killed him.”\n\n“What? Who’s El Guapo?” \n\n“The guy that ran out of the apartment.” \n\n“You said you didn’t see anyone.”\n\n“I did. Chepe, the dead guy.”\n\n“But when did El Guapo run out of the apartment?”\n\n“When I opened the door.”\n\n“So, you saw him too, right?”\n\n“Yeah?” Miguel was somehow more confused than I was. \n\n“Ok, let me get this correct: you opened the door, El Guapo says he killed Chepe, he takes off running, you call police. Right?”\n\n“Well, then Flaco said he’d kill me too so I ran.”\n\n“Who’s Flaco?”\n\n“The guy in the apartment.” \n\n“I thought that was El Guapo?”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“They’re the same guy?” \n\n“No.”\n\nI had to step away for a minute to rub my temples for some reason. \n\n“Ok. So, Guapo says he killed Chepe, Flaco says he’ll kill you. What were they wearing and where did they go?”\n\n“Clothes and outside.” Miguel’s eyes darted about in agitation. \n\n“Good lord.” I grabbed my radio. “Foxtrot7 with an update. We have two outstanding, presumably Hispanic males, more to follow on description and direction of travel.”\n\n“Now Miguel,” I began again. “This is very important. Describe for me the clothing they were wearing. What did they look like?” Miguel proceeded to give a vague description of the two suspects, the only remarkable aspect of each being Flaco was skinny (really??) and Guapo had a beard and bright yellow tennis shoes. I gave the lookout over the radio and met with the Lt again. \n\n“Thanks for getting the info out. How’s the caller seem?”\n\n“Drunk and maybe a little stupid.”\n\n“I’ll be sure to pass that along to homicide whenever they decide to show up. I’m sure it’s nothing new for them.” The cruiser with Miguel pulled away and the Lt turned and began barking orders for guys to put up police lines and begin a crime scene log. I stood around for a few minutes, not really having a task and looking out of place in my tactical gear. Eventually, a couple friendly faces from investigations arrived. \n\n“EMR! They call you in for this BS too?” Biggs had been transferred to investigations shortly after I was. He explained homicide was short on bodies and he had been called out to help with the canvass and scene control. He brought Steve with him, a former coworker of mine from property crimes who had vaulted to the big time as well. He was also a Spanish speaker. \n\n“What’s the plan?” I asked Biggs. \n\n“Well, I guess we wait for crime scene to do their thing and wing it from there. Mikey is at the station, re-interviewing that Miguel guy. He’s lead, we’re just support.”\n\n“Should we talk to them?” I suggested, motioning towards the crowd of onlookers that had gathered along the plastic barrier of police tape that had been erected. \n\n“That’s all you two.” Biggs replied, and Steve’s annoyed glare at me didn’t go unnoticed. \n\n“What? I want to be productive at least.”\n\nOver the next hour or four we talked to dozens of onlookers. Many of the potential witnesses would turn and walk away once they realized we were heading their way but there were a few who were helpful. We learned there really were two guys going by Flaco and Guapo, and that both hailed from Honduras. Another said he saw the two jogging towards a shopping center just before police arrived. Still another informed us the apartment where the event occurred was supposed to be vacant but the property management was too intimidated by the dynamic duo to actually kick them out. All this info was passed to Mikey who had wrapped up his preliminary interview with Miguel. \n\n“Well, do we have a name for our guys?” He asked, not content with the plethora of information we had already gifted him. \n\n“Working on it.” Biggs called from the desktop computer of the major incident bus that had arrived some time earlier. We were all eating pizza, provided by our eager-to-please supervisors from investigations, and had stumbled onto several recent calls in the area concerning two guys who vaguely matched the description of our suspects. \n\n“We found a call for a suspicious injury from a couple weeks ago. The caller told 9-1-1 his friend fell and cut his head but medics made a note it appeared he had instead been sliced by something. No one would change their story so they ran the call as medical only. The guy with the cut was ID’d as Jose Membrano. He was popped last week for lewd acts in front of our murder building. His booking photo,” I pulled out a printed-off copy and handed it to Mikey, “shows Mr. Skin-and-bones here he has stitches in his forehead. This is a week after the medical call.”\n\n“Damn!” Mikey seemed impressed but it was hard to be sure.\n\n“Running the caller’s number from the medical call returns a guy named Edilberto Gomez Galvez. He called 9-1-1 another time a few weeks prior to the medical to report an assault. He was named the victim in that case. He also has a rap sheet and here’s his mug shot from the most recent visit to our five starred accommodations.” I handed another photo to Mikey, this one depicting a guy with a beard. He examined it closely. “You think we’re close?” \n“One way to find out.” He stomped out of the bus and over to his cruiser. “Miguel’s back at the station still. I’ll call you in a few.”\n\nSteve took a massive bite from a slice of pepperoni. He smiled with chipmunk stuffed cheeks and said “Settle in boys, it’s gonna be a long ride.”\n\nMy phone buzzed a while later as I was perusing more calls for service in the vicinity. “Mikey! What do you got?”\n\n“Beard guy is Guapo, Stitches is Flaco. Miguel picked them, no hesitation.” He explained further that Miguel had come off his story a bit more as well, providing enough for him to justify calling and waking up a prosecutor who approved swearing out murder warrants. “Paper is en route, EMR. I’m handing you the baton. Don’t fuck this up.”\n\nThe gravity of the case hit me. I had worked big-time stuff before but it would be the first time everything rested on my shoulders. I was the fugitive investigator and I officially had some fugitives to find. \n\n“We got a phone for Guapo, right?”\n\nAn hour later and my investigation had progressed. I had requested a ping on the cell phone and had assembled a group to assist me in tracking my guys. Guapo, it seemed, was not smart enough to turn off his phone and it worked in our favor. \n\n“Latest ping came back and our guy is stationary. I have him narrowed down to this sixteen meter circle.” I pointed to the map display on the monitor of the bus that now didn’t seem so extravagant. “I’d like my four K9 guys to partner up, two by two. You’ll be the primary approach teams. Me, Biggs, and Steve will hang out on this street over here in case they get flushed and you can’t get a clean release on them. The rest of you I’d like to set up on Maple to the North, and Elm to the South. We’ll have the helicopter come back and cover the whole thing.”\n\nEveryone was nodding and I made a quick mental double check assuring I hadn’t forgotten anything. “Questions?” I asked.\n\nEveryone shook their heads no and we set off. \n\nThe circle was centered in a drainage culvert next to a church off a busy road. Biggs, Steve and I crept into our position with our headlights off and exited our cruiser just as the helicopter began circling overhead. \n\n“Air one to K9 officers. We have you in the FLIR. No unusual heat sources yet.” \n\n“K9Alpha, direct.” \n\nMy group began creeping towards a privacy fence that butted up against the culvert. Steve’s eyes were wide with excitement and he rasped, “Let’s wait here so we can see if anybody runs.” I nodded and scanned the area. Trash was piled next to the large storm drain in the middle of the field, gathered up in the last storm and deposited unceremoniously when it wouldn’t go down the drain. There was a row of tall evergreens between the culvert and the church which was lit with yellow, ground mounted landscaping lights. Off to our right we saw one team approaching the culvert, dog in the lead and the handler without the leash wearing his NVG’s. A shadow slowly rose to our left, silhouetted against the church’s brick wall. It seemed to crouch and was very interested in the K9 team’s approach. \n\n“Dude.” Biggs whispered, his eyes glued on the shadow. \n\n“Is that them?” I asked, knowing there was no way to tell for sure. The helicopter battered the air overhead on another circle but didn’t call out any new heat sources. The shadow began retreating away from the K9 team who had finally noticed what we had seen. \n\n“Hey!” The guy in NVG’s yelled, and they picked up their pace. \n\nSteve, Biggs and I exchanged glances and made the same decision. We all jumped the fence and began crossing the culvert. \n\nThe shadow stopped and a voice called out. “It’s us!”\n\nIt was the second K9 team. I would later find out their predetermined approach had been hampered by a fence we hadn’t accounted for. They had to take another route to get to the culvert and weren’t sure where they were as they rounded the building, hence their apprehensive crouching. \n\n“Shit!” The first K9 handler cursed, and began pulling his dog back. The dog took its attention from other team, glanced in our direction, then seemed to notice something else. Its nose shot down to the ground and it began pulling its lead with a new fervor. \n\n“I’m on something.” Hissed the handler and the second team fell in line. My trio stood frozen in the middle of the drainage field. The guy with the NVG’s flipped them up from his eyes and his counterpart in the second group did the same as the first pulled out a giant Mag Light. He shone its laser-like beam ahead and under the evergreens. A bright flash of yellow darted under one.\n\n“POLICE SHOW US YOUR HANDS!” He yelled at the foot, but got no response. \n\n“COME OUT NOW OR WE’RE SENDING IN THE DOG!” Still no answer. \n\n“Air one, looks like K9 is on a target hiding under a bush.”\n\n“I SAID, COME OUT NOW OR YOU’LL BE BIT!” The dogs were well trained, whimpering and pulling on their leashes but not barking. \n\nSteve piped up with a hoarse voice. “Eh-hem, POLICIA! SALGA CON LAS MANOS ARRIBAS!”\n\n“Good thinking.” I croaked.\n\n“Thanks.” He whispered back.\n\nThe yellow shoes popped back out and then a bearded face appeared, eyes shielded from the bright light by a dirty palm. He stood slowly and raised his hands while Mag Light officer leveled his weapon at him. “GET DOWN ON YOUR STOMACH, HANDS TO YOUR SIDES!” \n\nThe man seemed to have learned English in an instant and complied without hesitation. He was pounced on by the two dog-less officers who cuffed him and dragged him away. \n\n“Anyone else with you?” One asked as they came closer to us.\n\nThe man nodded yes and the two handlers with dogs still trained on the bush were provided the information. One gave surrender orders again but still had no reply. He began creeping forward, dog straining as hard as he could to get there and bite something, and stopped just short of the tree. Biggs and I had moved closer to help as Steve began talking with Guapo. \n\n“LAST WARNING. I’M GOING TO SEND IN THE DOG!” His voice echoed off the church walls and rose above the helicopter’s din. \n\nHe looked back at us for a split second as if to say, ‘Here goes nothing,’ and let loose some of the long leash he had been holding balled up in his fist. The dog darted forward and began happily smelling everything it could put its nose on. His handler dispensed disapproving noises when the dog tried to eat some old nachos and lapped at a pool of Modelo Negro. Suddenly it gave its full interest back to the bush and lunged forward. Squeals of pain rose in the air and the dog backed out in bouncing jerks, tail wagging like crazy and a dirty leg gripped in his jaws. He dragged the screaming Flaco a good six feet before he decided to listen to his handler and let go. Flaco rolled over without even being asked, sobbing and loudly praying to “Dios.” Biggs cuffed him and we limped him out to the street.\n\n“Air one, two in custody. Well done guys.” \n\nMickey met us at a cruiser. “You sure this is them?” They were much dirtier than their mug shots. \n\n“I think you homicide guys would call that a clue.” I said while shining my flashlight on the blood smeared all over Guapo’s button down shirt and jeans.\n\n“Huh.” Mickey grunted. “I guess you fugitive guys would be better at catching guys if you had dogs.”\n\nI had no witty reply but did have my two suspects. It was good enough for the moment. \n",
