        "text": "So we have some flying cars in development now from Uber and slovakian company Aeromobil's flying car that simulaneously changes from a car to a plane.\n\n[https://www.aeromobil.com/](https://www.aeromobil.com/)\n\nSci-fi fans are probably having the time of their lives right now, but something about flying cars just really boggles me, and I hope its not just me.\n\nAre flying cars really as practical as they seem?\n\nNow before any flying car fanboys come roasting me on the comments section I want you guys to hear me out for a second. Now, ive always had been skeptical on the mass development of flying cars, We have Elon Musk saying on how they would be noisy and how one car flying over you would give you anxiety as if its about to guillotine you.\n\nNow here is why i'm skeptical about flying cars\n\n* **How in the world of nowhere will they ever be affordable -** Now even to the ordinary middle class person? I mean, they got to be expensive as all hell, We got fancy cars like Lamborghini and Ferrari who are not even flying cars being already as expensive as they are. Even electric cars are already expensive.\n* **Flying cars are too unsafe compared to land cars -** When we talk about flying, the accidents can be more deadly than on lands because of gravity. Even worse, if flying cars become mainstream, then the number of deaths per accident will increase significantly. Flying cars also don’t have the same braking ability as land cars. I don’t there will be such thing as traffic jam on air. People have enough trouble driving within the lines in a two dimensional world of freeway and street traffic. Think about adding a third dimension to that, where there are no landmarks or control signs. Cars would drop on people’s houses and heads, weather would be a significantly bigger factor and now we have to fly around buildings a well.\n* **Who could even fly one?** \\- I mean, come on guys. Even flying a plane is already gonna take pilot course that last for years. Even trainee pilots have to take time to fly a biplane on a test course. Oh, and then there are also small matters like having to obtain an expensive pilots license to operate one, and then also having either your own runway in the backyard, or easy access to an airport for takeoffs and landings. Flying cars will never be anything more than oddities and playthings for the wealthy.\n* **Breaking down means falling out of the sky** \\- How about if you break down or have an accident? When you are in an aircraft gravity plays a huge role in the outcome of a crash where at least on the ground when an accident takes place or your car breaks down you are already on the ground and ready to solve the problem in front of you. In the air you may not have a vehicle anymore when a break down occurs, instead you just might be parachuting to the ground and no longer have a ride to your destination, and certainly no one is going to be able to come to a stop and help you either.\n* **Noise Generation** \\- Now as also what Elon Musk has said, Noise also becomes a factor. Flying cars with today’s tech aren’t going to be quiet and they would take a lot of room to take off and land. Without vtol, you would still have to land somewhere and transfer to your destination. Not convenient.\n* **Fixes** \\- And lastly what I want to point out is fixes. With a flying car, Its gonna be different compared to land ones. There would have to be flap maintenance, different set of engines etc. Hell, Even our traditional cars can already give us enough headaches as it is; cars that can fly won't be different, and may possibly be worse.\n\nSo these are the points I want to make, Now I'm not trying to steer anyone out of the possibility that chitty chitty bang bang would be real, But as all science person knows, \"***Reality is Stranger than Fiction***\", things might not always go as they look like. Now I want to hear anyone else's thoughts about this.",

        "text": "Hi, I don't really know if this post fits this subreddit (as it is purely hypothetical), so any other subreddit suggestion will be taken into account.  Those are two thoughts that I have been carrying for a long time and I don't know if they already exist.\n\nThe first one is that if we want to calculate each interaction of each particle in the universe, we would need (at least) a number of \"computational elements\" as big as the number of particles in the universe. For example, if in the future we could perform logical operations (as addition, substraction...) with one single particle, we would need all the existing particles to calculate the behavior of the entire universe.\n\nThe second one, which is related to the previous, is: Supposing that we can make a computer that doesn't occupy the entire universe, and we want to calculate how the universe evolved from the begging to know, and maybe predict how it will be in the future (I will comment that at the end of the post). It starts the simulation from the big bang, the evolution of the universe, how the solar system formed, the evolution of human civilization and it reaches a point in which it has to calculate itself calculating the evolution of the entire universe (as it is an object in the universe which modifies its future state). Furthermore, if we give it enough time, it will be calculating itself, calculating itself, calculating itself... And you can keep adding an arbitrary number of \"calculation layers\".\n\nI hope those paradoxes can be understood (as they are random thoughts hahaha). About the second one I have to say that it relies on a deterministic view of the universe (which I like, but that may be not correct if quantum physics are truly random), and it may not be possible to predict the future state of a system knowing its initial state independently of the computational power available.",

This reaction is an internal force that oppose to the gravity and eventually will collapse causing the death of the black hole.\n\nDepending on what the black hole \"ate\" the process would be slower or faster so that if the singularity has a lot of iron in itself it would take longer than if there were more hydrogen, and based on how fast the reaction is, the black hole will die releasing a lot of quarks. (there is also the chance that the speed of the reaction doesn't change based on how many particles and atom has the black hole eaten)\n\nThe black hole would die when the speed of the reaction would get greater than the amount of subatomic-particles coming to the singularity. this would happen when nothing is moving in space anymore or when \"not many\" particles are going towards the event horizon.\n\nby\" not many\" i mean less than what a singularity can separate in the same time (the time would be measured on the surface of the singularity).\n\nSo once a black hole died, i think that with the explosion and the release of subatomic-particles, the quarks will create hydrogen again so that star can form and so another \"universe\" begins.\n\nAlthough due to many black holes existing and not knowing how they interact with each other i just thought that they would get together to form a bigger one or explode like if both would die.\n\nso this brings me to thing that our universe is a region of space where a black hole died and that there are many other region like this that we can't see because they are way too far from us.\n\nI like to think that all of this hypothetical black holes will eventually be part of one big black hole that once it would die it would reset the cycle. I also like to think that this might have already append, maybe once, maybe a billion times or maybe this is the first time it happens. who knows?\n\nI am 16 years old so I don't have nor enough mathematical nor physical knowledge to say that all of this might be possible, so just take this as it is: a thought of mine.",

But that isn’t why I’m asking this question.\n\nMy question is how this forced personality change affect a person psychologically? I can’t imagine it would be healthy to reconcile a lifetime of living in a manner opposite to your current personality. What kind of psychiatric disorders could result from such a split?\n\nFurther, some of these plot devices can change things other than just alignment. A bold fool (high Charisma, low Wisdom) could be cursed to be pathologically shy, but gain wisdom. A sage could find himself unable to recall most of his knowledge or apply basic philosophy after having his intelligence drained. An adventurer can come across a host of perils which would result in his mental structure being completely subverted until he may not feel like the same person.\n\nI don’t think (at least I hope) there are too many real world occurrences of this, but I’m hoping to learn as much as I can about some parallels. It would certainly make for a more interesting recurring villain if I have a better grasp of how his fall to darkness would affect his personality.",

For the sake of argument, let's say 78 during the day is acceptable but the house should be no higher than 73 during the evening and night. It's about 70 outside at night and 90 during the day. The Sun broadsides about two-thirds of the building during the day, which means some heat continues coming through the walls after it's set.\n\nI remember from university physics that heat exchange happens more rapidly when the temperature difference is higher, which is why you need to model it with differential equations. I also know that most of the heat in a house is retained by the solid objects and not the air.\n\nIs it more efficient to:\n\n* Leave the thermostat set to 73 all the time?\n* Set the thermostat to 73 at 5 PM and then up to 78 at 6 AM?\n* Something else?\n\nIn the first case, the AC will run in short spurts throughout the day to fight the daytime heat. In the second case, it will run less often during the day, but also will run for one very long stretch during the evening. However, the outdoor temperature in the evening is lower, so the AC would have to fight a bit less.",

He showed how they would only observe “slices” of that being as the being transited their plane of perception.  If an Apple descended through their 2D space, they would see something that appeared to be continually in changing in size and motion, even though the Apple is unchanged.   Is there a good way to show that our perception of space time is an accurate view?   If we apply the Sagan thought experiment, could it not be that all space is permanent and unchanging, and what we observe as the passing of time is simply our view of “slices” of a higher dimensional object.  In other words, a 4D person would see your entire journey from the moment you got in your car to when you arrived at your destination as a single static observation, but because you can only see time as it descends through our 3D space, you perceive only those “slices” in that moment, with past slices being memories and future slices being predictions?   If this were true, would it not also help explain some perplexing observations, such as why gravity appears so weak?  If gravity is a 4D force while the other fundamental forces operate so locally as they can primarily be expressed in 3D, 2D or even 1D space, we would “perceive” those forces as exerting themselves more strongly in our 3D space (x, y, z, now) where gravity is being diluted in the 4D space (x, y, z, forever).  I don’t know how to calculate this, but if one calculated the force of gravity in any given moment and then calculated it out over the entirety of the life of the mass generating that force, does gravity start to look on par or perhaps even stronger than the other physical forces?  For example, if the sun creates 1U of gravity per second but 1x10e20U of electromagnetism per second in our 3D space start to look like 1x10e100U of both gravity and electromagnetism if seen in 4D space?",

I guess there are plenty of complex issues in creating pixels at this level, but assuming it is possible let me elaborate the question.\n\nIf electrons of this atomic pixels could be excited such that they emit photons of visible light exactly as how photons are reflected by a mirror, could that just this display indistinguishable from a mirror to an observer?\n\nI've read that at atomic scale, mirror atoms (made of silver) reflect/re-emit in all directions, but due to constructive and destructive interference with neighboring atoms, we could see photons only in shortest path. This gives true 3D perception to observer as it creates a virtual image behind the mirror. \n\nSo, I wondering if this  phenomenon of mirror at atomic scale is replicated (or mimicked) by a display screen, then does it exhibit all the visual cues (like binocular and motion parallax, accommodation, convergence cues etc) required for true 3D display like a mirror (or a full color dynamic 3D holography)?\n\n\n",

Living organisms have a great tendency to *self-preserve*: whether that means avoid danger (attack predators or run from predators), seek survival (obtain resources to maintain and/or extend life), and/or preserve fragments of self (reproduce and pass genes forward through time and hope we never die out).\n\nHow does the interactions between elementary particles in turn affect protons, neutrons, and electrons to in turn affect atoms and their properties to in turn effect the making of large variety of molecules to in turn effect even larger varieties of atomic and molecular combinations to in turn 'create' a self-aware organism that has, in-grained, the property above?\n\nHow does such an irrelevant yet intricate and complicated property of *self preservation* come from such simple interactions such as charge attraction and repulsion, hydrophobic molecules, etc, (just to name a few) ?\n\nThis IS an example of the emergence property, so perhaps my question is: how does the property come about in this specific case?\n\nIs this a consequence of both Darwinian evolution and survivorship bias? i.e. only molecular interactions which are successful, and form consciousness, survives to be noted by us conscious beings? I guess my question isn't very specific and has a lot of undefined terminology, like consciousness. I'd just like to know if any light has been shed on the topic. I have left the flair empty since I believe my question encapsulates almost all sciences. lol apparently I have to pick one.\n\nAlso, if this is the wrong sub, please inform me, I can repost elsewhere.",
