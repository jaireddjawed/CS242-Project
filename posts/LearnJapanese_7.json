I’m level four of wani kani, and was wondering at what level should I read that book or any other book in general?\n\nAnd should i still try to push through the book? I know I won’t fully understand *everything* my first go, but just want to make sure I’m not wasting my time…\n\nAlso if there’s any good ways to quickly learn grammar (i do well with grasping it and will research more if confused) please send through. I’ve been using tofugu, cure dolly, tae kim for grammar, but they seem rather slowish. I feel like I can get it a lot quicker.",

But I've noticed that there is A LOT of vocab to learn in the 「文字・語彙」section in the textbook and on their videos they only cover the practice question vocab. \n\nCan someone who also studies through nihongo no mori share with me how you go about these lessons? Do you study all the vocab from the textbook? how do you do it? I've been struggling to find time to create so many flashcards as there isn't any context to them I have to research every single one of them, and then I have to find time to revise them and also study grammar, and kanji... \n\nI'd be eternally grateful if you could share your experience with me,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!",

This fall I intend to head to Japan and start studying Japanese, and I wondered if there were any similar programs that people were aware of over there?\n\nI had initially been planning to apply to the Waseda program, but looking more closely, it looks like class sizes are *much* larger than what I'm doing now, which I worry will mean much slower progress (at least for me).\n\nA few additional details about me:\n\n* Unlike Chinese, which I started from zero, my Japanese level is a bit of a jumbled mess. After having traveled over there extensively, my listening and reading ability aren't horrible, but my speaking absolutely sucks, and my study has all be self-driven. In addition, I'm going have the unusual situation of having a decent, but not native-chinese-speaker level of kanji/漢字 knowledge. Given that mess of my current state of japanese, it would be nice to have a program that had some level of flexibility/personalization in its curriculum.\n* I really, really like Tokyo, but obviously am also willing to live elsewhere for the purposes of a good program (as evidenced by the fact that I've been living in Taiwan for the past year, which is definitely not Tokyo)\n* I graduately from college long ago, so programs exclusively for current undergrads unfortunately don't work.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "I've been trying to study this, and it has made much sense for me.\nI under the general difference of は (topic marker) and が (subject marker)\nBut there's been so much conflicting information.\nI'd really appreciate someone to help me clear up some misconceptions or anything.\n\nSo, firstly I keep seeing that を+potential verb form is grammatically incorrect, but I'm also seeing a lot of people saying that it's either interchangeable, not as commonly used compared to が, or there's a small difference. Which is it?\nMy interpretation was that it provides a somewhat neutral statement, like that you can do something, but there's no information extended onto it. But then I read that が provides the neutral statement.\n\nSecondly, with が, I understand it marks the subject. And in this situation, it provides exhaustive listing, except I don't really know what that means. So I understand that if I said ジョンさんが英語を話せる, this would be a situation where を is used, and it labels John as the subject, who is the one who can speak English, apart from anyone else. But again, how would this be grammatically correct if I can't use を?\nThough if it was like \"ジョンさんは何言語を話せるか\" and he responded with \"日本語が話せる\", it would mean he can only speak English, opposed to other languages, right? Is this exhaustive listing?\nBut if this is the case, how can it be used in a neutral statement? How is が compared to を with potential form?\n\nAnd は confuses me a lot. I understand it's use is for comparison, so if I said something like \"りんごは食べられる\", I thought it meant that specifically I eat the apple, but I can't do much else to it. such as cooking or growing them?? But I read that this is wrong, and it expresses that it's I can only eat apples, and not anything else. But I thought that was the function of が？\nAnd I understand I can't use は twice in a sentence, so I can't say 私はりんごは食べられる, would I have to swap that は to a が or を ??\nIn what situations would I use は ?\n\nI'd appreciate any help! This is something I keep making mistakes with, and I've tried searching for answers, but I keep finding conflicting information, or it's just not understandable.",

        "text": "Hello! A few months ago, I made the decision to begin learning Japanese and here's how it's going.\n\nI wholeheartedly admit I rushed into it without much of a game plan and forked down as many of the basics as I could with a lot of enthusiasm. I've manged to learn Hiragana and Katakana, I have around 125 Kanji under my belt (that I can recall the meaning and at least one reading of off the top of my head at least) and I've got a VERY rudimentary understanding of basic grammer and sentences structure (as well as some basic vocab). \n\nUp until now, repetition-based apps have been the backbones of my learning journey.\n\nKanji study and Duolingo are the two I've gone back to the most. (And yes, I know Duolingo has a lot of problems with its grammer but more than anything its bite-sized exercises helped me a lot when learning Katakana and Hiragana and typing on a Japanese keyboard, so for that I'd like to keep it around.) \n\nJust recently I started using the website and app JapanesePod101. Repetition-based learning is great, but when it comes to speaking and forming sentences, nothing helps me more then actually understanding the rules of the language and why the vocab is formulated in the way it is. For that reason JP101 has quickly become my favorite outlets for learning the language so far.\n\nWith those very basics out of the way, I've officially hit the \"conscious incompetence\" stage of learning. There's so much to move forward with from where I am now that I'm not sure what the best course of action should be. Should I continue memorizing kanji and their readings, should I look more into vocab and grammer, or should I continue to do a little bit of both alongside eachother?\n\nI know for a fact I need more structure in my studying and have been debating looking into official online courses, I'm just not sure where to start. I've never pursued any kind of education online, so venting different resources to find the ones worth spending time and money on are also somewhat of a daunting task.\n\nThat's why I'm asking advice. I'm sure I've made a lot of mistakes with how I've handled teaching myself up until now, but I'd like to start learning seriously!",

        "text": "I know this may be hard to read for some, but hear me out. \n\nI know a lot of people here are big advocates for immersion when learning Japanese. Immersion is a valuable learning tool, especially in middle to late stages of the learning process when you understand at least 50% of the content.\n\nBut I keep seeing a trend here where people advocate for immersion at the begging stages where learners have almost no vocabulary or basic grammar under their belt. \nThere's something that may be learned here if there are no English subtitles, and you can pick up most of what is being said. But to use this correctly requires effort on the listener to actively pay attention to every word said. \n\nStudying is hard, and requires effort. Watching anime does not. \nI've been a lurker here for a while and a leaner for several years. I've watched some trends come and go, but one thing that made me write this is a little self study I did. \n\nI went back on the subreddits history and found everyone advocating for full immersion in posts and comments for those just starting. 85% of those posters seem to have given up their learning journey 2 months-1 year in. I also checked those arguing against it and their retention rate seems to be in the 40-60% rate. \n\nI'm just asking everyone who may be immersing themselves in material they don't understand without English translation and subtitles, could your time be better spent elsewhere, and are you using this to procrastinate real learning? \n\nTLDR:\nWatching anime you completely don't understand is probably a waste of time of you are passing it off as study time. And it would be much more beneficial to learn some of the vocabulary and grammar used in the anime before watching to get true value out of the content.",

        "text": "I've spent the last few months cramming the meanings of kanji, even as my reading (pronounciation, grammar, etc.) lags behind. To me, it helps with acquisition being able to glance at a sentence and get the gist of what it's saying, even if I can't actually say it aloud.\n\nRecently I encountered に因る, and recognised its similarity in meaning to による as a grammatical construct. When I looked it up I was pleasantly surprised to learn it's actually the same thing, but it's usually written as kana. On the opposite point, I was looking up the etymology of なぜ and was very interested to find it can be written as 何故, because the kanji meaning for it is very literal. \n\nI've encountered a few dozen others like this; 為る, 此れ, or even 之 as a more literal の. I find them fascinating because it helps make grammar feel more procedural and structural, rather than just a pairing of phonemes—like in the case of \"-なくてならない\" construct, where recognising '成らない' as a unit of meaning allowed me to connect it to the meaning of that kanji, rather than just a seemingly-disconnected 'な'. Kanji compounds like 此方 demonstrate their meaning very literally—whereas こちら relies on already knowing the word and pairing it to a phonetic meaning.\n\nIt may seem like a dumb request, but I'd love it if people could provide some of their favourite examples of grammar like this! Also I'm likely to start myself down a very deep rabbit-hole by asking this—but were most structures like auxilary verbs and adverbs traditionally kanji?",

What I am doing to study kanji is using the Kanji Study app and learning the 80 elementary 1 kanji. I write the kanji on a notebook six times and each time I write it I also write its 音読み (in カタカナ) and 訓読み (in ひらがな). Then I move on to the next kanji. I study around 5 kanji a day this way. Once I'm done with the 5 kanji I write them all one time again (with 音 and 訓 included). The next day I write the 5 kanji I learned the day before and then I continue with writing 6 times the next 5 new kanji, following with writing all of them in a sequence one time with the readings and everything. I got 35 kanji down this way. I intend to continue until I finish kanji number 80. Once I've the first 80 kanji down, I would begin to write and learn vocabulary from the sample vocabulary given by Kanji Study for each kanji. Once I'm done with the vocabulary with each kanji I would continue to study elementary 2 kanji and so forth. Is this method any good? What would you recomend to add to this method and what resources should I get for kanji study)\n\nI intend to get Genki, for grammar and vocabulary but I'm not sure if it's worth it. Would you recommend Genki for grammar and vocabulary?\n\nWhat other resources would you recomend?\nI'm going step by step little by little trying to master N5 at the moment.\n\nThank you for all your responses in advance. I would really appreciate your input.",

        "text": "\n\nI’m open to discussion on this, as I’m sure there’s plenty of you out there who will totally disagree with me on this, but this is something that’s really helped me. \n\nIn my opinion, developing good listening skills is the hardest part of learning Japanese, and one that I’d frequently neglected up until fairly recently (about 6 months ago I had a change in approach). It’s something you have to do a metric **** ton of to see any tangible progress, and that seeming lack of progress (and frequently understanding almost 0% of something you’re listening to) can be hugely demotivating. I stopped watching TV, dramas etc for a loooong time because I always felt like I was wasting my time on the ‘wrong content for my level’ without any idea of what the ‘right’ or ‘level appropriate’ content should be.\n\n But the barrier for me has always been my mindset, and the not the actual difficulty of the stuff I’m consuming. I’d watch a drama with arbitrary goals in my head like, ‘understand 30%’ of the dialogue, or ‘get the gist of the story’, and then feel like id wasted my time or ‘failed’ if It didn’t pan out the way I’d hoped. I’d lose motivation, and stop practicing. And stopping is the worst thing you can do. \n\nSo what’s changed? Well, I don’t set goals anymore for listening, or at least I set goals that are impossible not to attain. Whenever I sit down to watch something new, my goal is, “watch this thing and see how much understand”. The goal is simply participating in the listening activity itself, and taking a note of what I could understand. The goal is to simply “enjoy” watching TV or JDrama, and change to something else if I don’t enjoy it. I’ve taken the pressure off, am watching a couple of hours of TV every day, and I’m really starting to see progress again. It’s been transformative for me: I’ve gone from only watching subbed drama (Jp subs) to not needing them at all. \n\nThe point im trying to make is that, as with any skill, if you want to get better at something, then you have to ‘do’ it. You have to practice. And if setting goals (realistic or no) gets in the way of you ‘doing’ what it is that you need to do, then stop setting those goals.",

Back then, we just used MIA's free anki add-ons and pitch accent would be smoothly implemented into your cards, with color code and all (which is what I want).\n\nBut then, the MIA program split into refold and Migaku, and Migaku is basically a paid service.. which I'm interested in, except the pitch accent stuff I got for free previously. Luckily, for a couple years I don't Migaku really bothered to crack down on people still using this anki add-on without being a member of their service, I after doing some RTK stuff (again) for a while I got back into adding a sentence once again, then it said:\n\n\"Anki is not connected to the Browser Extension.\"\n\nI even downloaded this so called browser extension and quickly realized that their free plan gave crap. It was only like seven days to use even anything. I'm not sure if the internet at my workplace (I've been doing this at my workplace) is funking something up, or if I'm missing something, or did Migaku really just crack down on users like me?\n\nIf so that kinda sucks bc I only care about the color-coded pitch accent on my sentence cards. Other than that, I don't care for their service; respectfully I don't feel like I need it. I'll go and download a different pitch accent add-on if I have to (probably without my ever-so-valued color codedness) but I wanted to ask before I do that.",

I'm still learning new grammar, but I'm trying to make it a smaller part of my routine so that I don't burn out. Before, focused grammar / anki study was 90% of my study time. Now, each day I'm doing a small amount of Skinkanzen master grammar, Tango N3 Anki deck, and Wanikani. The rest of my study time (at least half) I'm spending on reading. I estimate that I'm probably reading around 4000-8000 characters a day and I'm looking to increase that substantially. \n\nCan I get by if I spend 90% of my study time reading instead of drilling grammar / Anki? If I come across a word or grammar construct I don't know, I'm only stopping to look it up if I feel the word is important to know or if the grammar construct is coming up repeatedly.  I'm not sure If I'm not doing enough or if I'm doing this right. What does everyone else do? Should I be looking up everything?",
