        "text": "[363 days ago](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/us/womens-march.html) thousands of people took to the streets of DC in the event I'll be referring to as *Women's March 2017*. On the [about page of the website](https://www.womensmarch.com/mission/), organizers of the march cited a few things they wished to accomplish with their demonstration, known as their *Unity Principles*.\n\n[The things they targeted as issues they wanted to combat were issues regarding](https://www.womensmarch.com/mission/): \n\nReproductive Rights,\n\nLGBTQIA Rights,\n\nWorker's Rights,\n\nCivil Rights,\n\nDisability Rights,\n\nImmigrant Rights,\n\nEnding Violence and,\n\nEnvironmental Justice.\n\nNow it's almost exactly a year later, and a [second demonstration is now underway](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/us/womens-march.html), which leads me into my question.\n\n**In the year between this current demonstration and its previous one, have advancements been made in achieving the goals of the first march?** Even if it's not complete irradication of these issues, how have things changed regarding these topics? Have policies been made in the past year, on both the federal and state levels throughout the United States, with the goal of combating one or more of these problems and what has the effect of such policies been?\n\nThank you for your time.",

With all these subscribers we're putting out the call to bring a few more good mods on board.\n\nHere's what the job entails:\n\nFirst, you need to have *time*. /r/NeutralPolitics is a heavily moderated subreddit that requires mods to check in every day. Some days there won't be much to do, but others you'll have to spend up to an hour reading posts and messaging people. For our regulars, that's probably close to their participation pattern anyway, but applicants should understand that there's a time commitment involved.\n\nSecond, you need to be familiar with the [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/index) and understand the type of community we're trying to build. It's kind of like a garden: left unattended, some of the plants will creep around and get unruly, but if you stay on top of it, it's a really neat place to hang out.\n\nMods read all submissions, and we're making an effort to read all comments as well. Roughly 70% of submissions to /r/NeutralPolitics get removed by a mod for not conforming to the guidelines. In each of those cases, the mod who removes the post will message the OP explaining why the post was removed and or work with them to craft an acceptable post.\n\nComments that don't conform to the guidelines are also removed, though they're more difficult to pick out than submissions. In order to help new users acclimate to our standards of discourse, we are refocusing our efforts to maintain moderator presence in the comments, so you'll be expected to reply to some of those as well.  \n\nOther responsibilities include:\n\n* Message an OP asking him to modify his submission.\n* Take note of problem users and bring them to the attention of other mods.\n* If you have a question about a post, submit it to other mods for review.\n* Join discussions with other mods about ways to improve the subreddit.\n* And of course, participate in the sub as a normal user.\n\nIf you're interested in becoming a mod in /r/NeutralPolitics, [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralPolitics) with a brief explanation of why you want to join the team and why you would be a good fit and also include your stance on avocado toast. Do not tell us your political leaning, any application that includes that information will automatically be dropped.\n\nAlso, we would like to take this time to answer questions and take feedback from users, so let's talk!\n",

[Maine produced this report](http://www.maine.gov/economist/docs/TANF%20Report%20Final%205-25-17.pdf) after instituting work requirements for food stamp recipients who were fit for work and found significant growth in incomes and decreases in joblessness. [The state of Kansas produced this report](https://thefga.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/PowerOfWork-KansasWelfareReform.pdf) which produced similar findings after instituting work requirements. \n\nHowever, [The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities produced this report](https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/work-requirements-dont-cut-poverty-evidence-shows) which found that, while joblessness decreases initially, the effects may not persist. \n\nI think another fair question to be asked in this discussion is, how should we measure the effectiveness of our welfare programs? Is it the number of people which we are able to enroll, or is it better measured by the enrolee's likelihood of finding a job which more than accounts for the welfare they were receiving?",

        "text": "The 2017 Federal Election in Germany saw [major losses for the CDU/CSU and and the SPD, while minor political parties such as the FDP and AfD made significant gains](https://www.economist.com/blogs/kaffeeklatsch/2017/09/first-results). After receiving the [lowest share of the vote since the Second World War](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-24/merkel-wins-fourth-term-as-main-parties-suffer-historic-setbacks), the SPD lead by Martin Schulz decided to [go into opposition and not renew its 4 year assosiaction with the CDU/CSU](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-24/merkel-wins-fourth-term-as-main-parties-suffer-historic-setbacks).\n\nThis has lead to talks these past few days wherin high ranking officials from both parties came together to strike a new deal in order to effectively form a government, though there has been serious backlash from within the SPD leading to citizens and high ranking party officials [voicing their doubts on the German news service, Tagesschau.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2yrPCiaV8M)\n\n\nI don't know how these talks will turn out, I'm not a fortune teller, but in hearing and reading this news I realized I really didn't know what would happen if the talks fell through and a coalition (whether the Grand Coalition or the Jamaica Coalition) wasn't formed. I'm not familiar with the Grundgesetz, and I don't know what is and isn't possible within the German government, which leads me to my questions:\n\n**What happens in the German government if no party can form a majority?** Are minority governments possible given German law? I can't find anything references the formation of a minority government since German reunification, so I assume there hasn't been one. Am I correct in assuming there hasn't been one though? And if that's the case, was it because such a thing was unnecessary or impossible?\n\n**Furthermore, if the existence of minority governments is possible in the German system, what are they like?** Do they share similarities with other nations' minority governments, such as in the United Kingdom or the Netherlands, or are German minority governments unlike all others?\n\nThanks for your time.",

        "text": "There seems to be a lot of contradictory evidence on this question.  In pursuit of objectivity I'd like to pose it to /r/neutralpolitics.\n\nOn the side of \"there is no sentencing disparity\", I found an article [here](https://www.dailywire.com/news/4847/6-leftist-myths-about-criminal-justice-system-get-ben-shapiro) that makes the following claims:\n\n&gt;**The Criminal Justice System Does Not Overprosecute Blacks.** For literally decades, studies have demonstrated that there is statistical parity between crime reports and arrests. Unless witnesses in the black community – predominantly the victims of black crime – are somehow racist against blacks, cops are arresting people who are guilty of crimes.\n\n&gt;**The Criminal Justice System Does Not Sentence Blacks Disproportionately Longer.**...studies have actually shown a slightly lower chance of prosecution and slightly lower sentences for black convicts...“A 1994 Justice Department survey of felony cases from the country’s 75 largest urban areas discovered that blacks actually had a lower chance of prosecution following a felony than whites did and that they were less likely to be found guilty at trial. Following conviction, blacks were more likely to receive prison sentences, however – an outcome that reflected the gravity of their offenses as well as their criminal records.”\n\nI couldn't find a source for \"there is parity between crime reports and crime rates\", but if that is true it seems to lend itself to the conclusion being that the higher arrest rate of blacks is due to their higher crime rate, rather than due to prejudice on the part of police officers.  While a counterargument might be that the crime reports are disproportionately done by white members of majority black communities, or by white police officers, this also doesn't take into account the fact that black members of the community or black police officers may also have a bias against black people in that regard, and that this implicitly assumes from the start that white officers and community members have this bias.\n\nI did find [the source](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fssc94.pdf) for the second claim, but I couldn't validate the \"and outcome that reflected the gravity of their offenses as well as their criminal records\" claim.  I couldn't find much information on this one reading the report, but a number of other sources mention this report so I'm inclined to believe it's true.  However I'd like more information.\n\nOn the other side, I have [this slate article](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/crime/2015/08/racial_disparities_in_the_criminal_justice_system_eight_charts_illustrating.html) which makes a few other claims.\n\n&gt;**Black Americans are more likely to have their cars searched.**\n\nIt gives [this source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/09/you-really-can-get-pulled-over-for-driving-while-black-federal-statistics-show/?utm_term=.783daadc09c6).  The counterargument is that black people simply speed more than white people.  I couldn't find evidence for this however, but I'm not sure this is certain evidence of racial bias among police officers.\n\n&gt;**Black Americans are more likely to serve longer sentences than white Americans for the same offense.**\n\n[It uses this source](http://c-6rtwjumjzx7877x24jhtstrnhx78x2ezghx2ehf.g00.slate.com/g00/3_c-6bbb.x78qfyj.htr_/c-6RTWJUMJZX77x24myyux78x3ax2fx2fjhtstrnhx78.zgh.hfx2fknqjx78x2f7568x2f50x2fuik_ufujw_rfwny-wjmfan-wfhnfq-inx78ufwnyd-kjijwfq-hwnrnsfq.uik_$/$/$/$/$?i10c.ua=1).  It's quite long, and I'm not sure if it takes into account prior convictions, which is a potential counterargument.  Furthermore it seems to contradict the second piece of evidence on the other side.  This is the big piece of evidence that I'm confused about, and am not sure which side to believe.\n\nBoth of these articles are biased in some way, but I think taking these 2 claims from each of them provides a good starting point for the conversation.  Is there a disparity in sentencing, incarceration, policing, arrests, etc between blacks and whites that can't otherwise be explained by the difference in crime rates?  Does racial prejudice factor into it?\n",

Growing populations, along with growing agricultural water usage (which already makes up [80% of used US fresh water](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-practices-management/irrigation-water-use/)) and supply issues [stemming from global warming](http://www.climatehotmap.org/global-warming-effects/water-supply.html). Overall, demand is expected to increase 50% globally between 2000 and 2050, [mainly](http://www.globalwaterforum.org/2012/05/21/water-outlook-to-2050-the-oecd-calls-for-early-and-strategic-action/) from manufacturing but from domestic and commercial sources as well.\n\nSome regions have already been swamped by water problems: the American state of California has been going through [record drought conditions](https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/californias-drought/) in recent years, while Australia endured a nearly [decade-long drought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000s_Australian_drought) at the beginning of the millenium. Additionally,many areas that were historically densely populated have been enduring [desertification](http://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.355.aspx.pdf), in some cases a long term trend exacerbated by human exploitation and climate change. This in turn has threatened existing populations, and at least some scholars believe that desertification may be a [long term cause](http://blogs.worldbank.org/arabvoices/climate-change-conflict-mena) of chronic conflict in regions like the Middle East. \n\nMany regions have already begun demand-side policies to address the issue: for example, has managed to reduce aggregate residential water use [by half](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-australia-can-teach-the-world-about-surviving-drought/) since their great drought. Other nations have addressed the supply side, some [turning to desalination](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/israel-proves-the-desalination-era-is-here/) while others have engaged in massive [water transfer schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South%E2%80%93North_Water_Transfer_Project) from more to less wet parts of their nation. \n\nWater scarcity seems to be [especially acute](https://publish.illinois.edu/sswpolicy/2015/09/18/the-water-scarcity-in-developing-countries-effects-on-women-and-children/) in developing nations unable to afford many solutions developed nations have implemented. This combined with massively growing populations in these regions suggests that problems may soon emerge.\n\n---\n\n**How big a problem is fresh water scarcity in the world today? What solutions are best for it, if any? What are the pros and cons of desalination, water transfer schemes, demand-side solutions etc?**",
