        "text": "They're episodes of TV and they're all rated 9.9, so does it rank them by the tenth (ex. 9.9s are going to be randomly ordered) or have a secret hundreds place not visible (ex. 9.97 vs 9.94). I would have thought the latter, but on my desktop vs. the IMDB app the order changes for those with tied scores. For example, the highest rated anime episode of all time on my phone is Attack on Titan's \"Hero\" at 9.9 and position 1. On my desktop, its Attack on Titan's \"Midnight Sun\" at 9.9 and position 1. There are 9 episodes rated 9.9 and the order is all different between the two platforms. However, the same 9 episodes are in the top 9 overall on both mobile and desktop. Once you go to #10 which is a 9.8, it gets even more disordered though because there are like 30 episodes with that score, and on the phone an episode might be #11 of all time with 9.8, but the same episode have a dozen more 9.8 episodes above it putting it at #23.",

        "text": "Hi,\n\nI just got to watch it (it released recently in my country) and I have to say I don't understand the complaints. I see that it's getting an average of 2.5\\* out of 5 on most websites and the critics always say that the acting of the boy is not realistic and some scenes are over the top.\n\nI don't want to focus on myself on this post but I actually relate to Nicholas' mental state. \n\nI'm going to spoil a little bit now: \n\nWhen someone goes through a depression, it will not be full of exaggerated reactions. For example, when Nicholas is begging for his parents to take him home at the hospital, it was a very good representation of depression because he gives them what they want (a son who understands his mistakes and that he has learned his lesson) for a chance to be able to go home and finally free himself from the world (death). \n\nThe lack of purpose in life is a real issue and I thought the movie treated the subject very well without adressing it directly. Nicholas doesn't want to go to school but not out of laziness; it's just tasteless for him. Everything is: you're smiling but you don't feel anything. You try to imagine your future (kids, wife, work) but it doesn't excite you. \n\nPersonally, I'm atheist so it was very hard for me up until my 20s to find a purpose in life. I wanted to experience life, but I kept thinking about how pointless it was because you're gonna die anyway so whether it's tomorrow or in 80 years, the end result is the same. Now I'm way better and all I needed was perspective but there are kids (and adults) like Nicholas out there who are struggling to express this feeling they have towards their daily life and I thought the behavior was On point. \n\nAnd about the other characters I really enjoyed Jackman's performance and how powerless the parents felt about their kid. The ending is heartbreaking and by the way I don't think that the director's intention was to trick the audience into thinking the kid didn't kill himself: to me it was very clear that Hugh Jackman was imagining how life could've/should've been for his son so in my experience while watching the movie I was already feeling his sadness through this beautiful moment.",

Rewatch in Bruges and 7 psychopaths all the time, they never get old. But I couldn’t get into this movie at all, fell asleep idk how many times trying to watch it. When I finally finished it I was like, wait that’s it? That’s the whole thing? No clever dialogue or crazy situations for the main characters to navigate, it’s literally just about two miserable, stubborn old guys arguing and being petty during the 1920s in Ireland. The plot is literally “I don’t want to be friends with you anymore” and the other guy is like “why not were best friends?” And the first guy goes “I don’t need a reason, stop talking to me”. That’s the whole plot of the movie for over two hours. It’s depressing, bleak, boring, predictable, none of the good qualities that his others films I’ve seen have, but this is the one that gets all the awards and nominations. What did I miss? I watched it twice. If you watched that movie and liked it I would like to know why",

Napoleon Dynamite made me cry when I re-watched it a couple of weeks ago. I keep coming back to it in my mind trying to figure out why. I can only remember legitimately crying 4 times as an adult, and this was one of them. It's the first time that I've cried during or after watching a movie.\n\nI've been watching at least one movie per day recently, mostly just because I'm not super into any video games right now so I'm doing that with my free time instead. Movies that I have seen at the top of \"films that made me cry\" threads and lists which did not make me cry include Grave of the Fireflies, Requiem for a Dream, Everything Everywhere All At Once, Atonement, The Impossible... And honestly, it's hard to not to feel like there's something wrong with me at this point. Those are all movies that *should* make you cry.\n\nMy best guess as to why Napoleon Dynamite made me cry was because I'm lonely as hell and have never really felt normal, so to see a few 'weird' kids form genuine connections and find genuine happiness is something that I apparently find very touching, because it's something I've always wanted and never had... Side note, I also teared up pretty significantly white watching Room a couple months back but didn't full-on cry.\n\nHave any of you guys ever felt similar to this? I hope that my post doesn't sound too self-defeating, because I think that watching movies is helping me learn how to feel, and I'm just trying to consciously help that process along.",

I left the screening of Creed 3 very impressed with the film. It was a great cap to the trilogy. \n\nThe best part of this film was the relationship between Adonis and Damien. You can feel the tension between the two whenever they share the screen, whether it’s intimate, talking scenes or in the ring. Jonathan Majors’ character really gives off Mike Tyson vibes in how intimidating and brutal he is. \n\nMichael B. Jordan really does a good job in his directorial debut. The action is well done too. A lot of familiar beats to past Rocky films but they work and MBJ adds some of his own flair, especially during the fights. \n\nSince this is the first film without Sylvester Stallone in the franchise, I was wondering if his presence would be missed. For me, I didn’t really think about him at all. He is certainly mentioned, but this is now Adonis’ story and the mantle has truly been passed on. \n\nOverall, everything about this movie, while familiar at times, was well made. All the actors brought their ‘A’ game.",

Plus, their dynamic made a bit more sense… her being in the same industry, etc.\n\nThis just seemed like an excuse for Cruise to have someone to play off who was female.",

Im a Bob Dylan fan, so the roots Greenwich movement made some fine music in my opinion, and the folk tradition certainly gave the Coens plenty to crib from, but the songs here hit it out of the park, even the dopey bubblegum \"Please Mr. President,\" all these years later will find its way into a goofy moment when I sing a little. It's a catchy tune. \n\nI'm not much of a musical guy, and these are traditional musicals in a modified package, two films I really enjoy, and its enhanced by the handling of rich original songs (or original performances in Llweyn's case) all throughout the soundtrack.",

        "text": "This might sound like an obvious question, but I think I've pretty much lost the distinction in the last five years.\n\nYou could argue that a TV show continues its story from one episode to the next, but so do movie sequels.\n\nYou could argue that a TV show is more frequent, but with some seasons now taking two year breaks, that's almost as long as some movie franchises.\n\nYou could argue that movies have higher budgets than a TV show, but look at Game of Thrones, or Rings of Power. These days everything is just as cinematic.\n\nYou could argue that a movie is longer, but referring back to Game of Thrones, the last episode was 78 minutes long.\n\nThe big one for me is where it's first screened. In a cinema, or on a television? However, when the likes of Netflix and Amazon are producing their own movies all the time, even that arguement falls away.\n\nSo where's the distinction these days? What makes a movie a movie? I don't think I know sometimes!",

        "text": "I have seen the movie dozens of times over the years. I could basically recite the whole thing from memory probably.\n\nNow we know that most of the film takes place in an pretty much empty warehouse that was the prearranged meeting place for after the robbery. I had never given much thought to the warehouse before, I mean there is a lot of other stuff to focus on during the movie and I guess I never really considered what this place actually was. Rewatching the film again recently I for the first time started picking up on things in the background that pretty clearly show where they actually are... Which is in a closed down funeral home.\n\nThere is a hearse under a cover parked near the warehouse door (Mr Blonde is sitting on top of it as Nice guy Eddie arrives) and there are what looks like unused coffins near it too.\n\nAlso the scene where Mr White and Mr Pink step into the other room to discuss what to do with Orange and if there is a potential rat in the crew, I always in the past figured they were in a bathroom or laundry room or something, I never really questioned it much.\n\nBut when rewatching on this occasion I noticed that it was not a bathroom or laundry at all... It is an embalming room. There are several bottles of formaldehyde on the bench, some sort of medical machine in the middle of the room that I somehow never noticed before, white coats hanging on a hook outside the door\n\nLastly the ramp in the main space that Mr Orange is laying on through most of the film is now in hindsight properly for wheeling coffins up and down.\n\n\nSo am I just slow for taking so long to pick up on all this? Is it actually a well known thing they were in a funeral home? Have any of you ever noticed this or known about it all along? I am curious if it is an obvious thing for everyone watching or if it is something that people don't pick up on.",
