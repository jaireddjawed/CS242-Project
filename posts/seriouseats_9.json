Reduce heat to medium and simmer until most of the cider has been absorbed and apples are easily smashed with a fork, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove pan from heat, cool 5 minutes, then process¬† in food processor until pur√©ed, 60 to 90 seconds, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed. Measure out 1 cup apple mixture (if you have less than 1 cup apple mixture, add additional milk to reach 1 cup). Stir apple mixture into milk, set aside. \n\nCould I reduce the cider then add some applesauce to replicate this? Maybe a couple drops of lemon juice to get the tartness that might be missing? Any other ideas on what I could do here? I'd prefer to just make it this afternoon and be done with it instead of trying to go to the store just to get 2 apples. \n\nThanks for the help",

        "text": "Hey gang! Have a question about the method for Kenji‚Äôs best chili ever‚Ä¶\n\nFirst of all - amazing recipe. Genius adaptations to bring such an intense depth of flavor. I learned a ton about cooking just from this recipe alone when I first made it as written years ago.\n\nSince then, due to a crazy busy work schedule I haven‚Äôt made chili too often; and every time I did I took the route of using pre-ground chili powder to save time. Tonight I decided to revisit the full method of the recipe, but used a plant-based meat alternative to adapt it for my vegetarian husband I made a half batch only (since it‚Äôs just the 2 of us), and my dried peppers were 1 Ancho, 1 Pasilla, 1 Mulato, 1 Guajillo.\n\nIt looks and tastes really good. Depth of flavor is there. But both times that I‚Äôve made the recipe as written, I‚Äôve noticed some heavy bitter notes, which aren‚Äôt there when I use the pre-ground chili pepper. I do enjoy bitter flavors, but this may be 1-2 notches too much even for my liking‚Ä¶\n\nWondering if pulverizing the seeds along with chilies may be the culprit for this?\n\nI learned not to de-seed my Mexican chilies from my Mexican roommate who never did when she made salsas (and they were the best!). So I had it in my head keeping all the chili seeds is the authentic way to do it‚Ä¶\n\nHave you experienced the same when making this recipe? Do you keep the seeds for the chili paste? Perhaps there is another reason my chili is leaning bitter? \n\nTLDR: When I make this recipe I use the full peppers minus the stem for the chili paste. Is the inclusion of seeds making my chili more bitter?",

        "text": "Hey team, \n\nI‚Äôm looking at Kenji‚Äôs [foolproof pan pizza recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/foolproof-pan-pizza-recipe). Since I started making Neapolitan pizzas the folks over at r/Neapolitanpizza put me onto this app called PizzApp. It asks for your percentages for hydration, salt, and fat, and asks for how long and at what temp you‚Äôll be proofing your dough, then it gives you the amount in grams you need of each ingredient including yeast. The yeast amount changes as you fiddle with ratios and proofing times etc. \n\nWhen I plug in the amounts suggested in Kenji‚Äôs recipe including the proofing time of 8-12 hours at my local room temperature the yeast the app suggests is far far lower than the yeast Kenji suggests. \n\nKenji‚Äôs recipe suggests 4g of instant yeast, whereas the app suggests 0.43g (for an 8 hour room temp proof - even less for 24 hours). Even changing the room temp to much lower (to reflect US room temp) it never gets anywhere near suggesting 4g of yeast. \n\nI‚Äôve used the app for [this recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/basic-pizza-dough-for-high-temperature-outdoor-pizza-ovens-5211302) for Neapolitan dough and found the same issue. I ignored the recipe yeast amount and used the app amount and the dough was amazing. \n\nJust wondering if anyone knows why these amounts would vary so widely..?",

        "text": "SE's Split Pea recipe is quick and easy enough, but, if you're like me and like to play in the lab - Err, I mean, kitchen - you might wanna try the long way. \n\nHere's how I went about it, and some cool things I discovered along the way:\n\nFirst of all, you'll want your ham hocks and juice, and some cubes from the leftovers from Thanksgiving, Christmas, whatever holiday you just made a ham for.\n\nI saw the juices in the roasting pan when it came out, and immediately knew I'd want to use it for split pea later. So, after carving up the ham, I took out the hock, and poured the juices into a bag, and into the freezer it went. \n\nA little over a week later, it's cold, snowing, and we're done with turkey hash, and ready for a new flavor.\n\nSplit pea it is! \n\nEverything I had in the bag, went into the Instant Pot, along with about 5 more cups of water (I eyeballed the juice amount; not incredibly accurate, but this is soup, not baking. It's pretty hard to screw it up.) \n\nSet it to high pressure for an hour, then grab your leftover ham and start cubin'! \n\nSet that aside, get your mirapoix. \n\nAll your leftover fatty pieces from the cuts, go ahead and toss those into a sauce pot with a little butter, or olive oil (why not both?) with a couple leftover sprigs of Rosemary. \n\nLet that render on medium high heat. Pull your still fatty pieces out. Anything crispy, a little leftover meat on it, leave it. Shouldn't affect your soup too much. \n\nStill got time on your ham broth? That's cool. Do a little cleanup, have a drink. \n\nI had some leftover Thyme that needed using up, too, so I took the opportunity to schuck it into the mirapoix. \n\nGo ahead and throw your cubed ham pieces in the sauce pot, get a little maillard going on for extra flavor. Stir it around a little bit, don't let it get TOO roasty. \n\nHopefully your homemade ham broth is far enough along that you can pop it, and open it up. Do that, now. \n\nGrab your ladle, and get a few scoops of your hot broth and add them to the sauce pot. Turn the heat down to low-ish, and add your mirapoix and Thyme. \n\nNext, grab a fine mesh strainer and some tongs and start picking out the skin and bones from your broth. Like me, you probably don't know pig anatomy as well as one should, if they truly love pork and pork products, so, you might be surprised at the amount of little bones you're gonna find in your fresh, hot, hammy swamp water. \n\nPull yourself out a little taste of the broth into a ramikan or other small vessel. Blow a few times to cool it off. \n\nHave a lil sip. \n\nHaha, right? It's like drinking a ham, and, boy, is it tasty! \"Why haven't I done this before??\" you ask yourself, as you take to Reddit to share your experience. \n\nNow, you think you might have a little dilemma : Surely, there's no such thing as too much ham, but, as you look at your unbalanced proportions, you think that COULD be a possibility, here. \n\nNay, (oink?) my friend, you're gonna be just fine. I got you, just press on. \n\nAdd your bag (1lb) of dried split peas, after you've rinsed and sorted them to your satisfaction. \n\nYou should still have enough liquid in the pot to soften your peas, but maybe transfer back another ladle full from your saucepot, if you think you need it. \n\nSwirl with your ladle to make sure the peas haven't clumped, pop the top back on your IP, and set it for another 15-20mins. \n\nHere's where it gets fun - when you've bled the pressure off, and your peas are soft, grab your stick blender and have at it, right in the pot. \n\nSee? Too much ham. . .  What? No, now you've got your smooth soup, AND nicely blended flavor bits. \n\nThis is what I like to call, \"winning\".\n\nAt this time, toss a Bay leaf or two into the pot, add your ham cubes and mirapoix from saucepot, and give it a stir. \n\nSet the IP for another 10mins or so to help meld all the flavors together. While that's going, do some final cleanup, toss your rolls into the oven to get warm, and prepare for service!\n\nLong way around? Yeah, absolutely. Worth it? I think so. \n\nLet me know in the comments if this was entertaining, useful, whatever!",
