This one should just be useful for college-level Biology majors and continue to be useful for the basics after specializing. What do you constantly need to look up for problems or homework in college?\n\nHere's what I'm thinking so far:\n\n* Cell cycle diagram\n* DNA to RNA pairing reference\n* Kingdoms and classifications name reference\n* Metric prefixes\n* Pressure and temperature conversions\n* Population statistics equations?\n* Hardy-Weinberg equation\n* Checkerboard scale ruler for imaging samples\n\nAre any of these too simple for college?

        "text": "So, hypothesis #1. Could slight artery wall deposits actually prevent aneurysm ruptures by reinforcing the strength of the arteries? Could the slight deposit buildup also block the aneurysm if it's of the saccular variety? I understand that significant deposits actually cause aneurysms.\n\nHypothesis #2. Saccular aneurysms are bulges in the blood vessels. Thus, would it be incorrect to assume that they have less flow through them compared to the rest of the blood vessel, or/and that blood flow would be more turbulent within them? If so, could we take advantage of this by injecting proteins or even parasites that would slowly accumulate in these cavities, and then inject an agent that would attack these particles and cause clotting within the aneurysms? Alternatively, if there is less/more turbulent bloodflow through saccular aneurysms, there may be less oxygenation in them. Could we use this to somehow induce clotting?",

The kidney regulates fluid balance through the RAAS-system starts through the decrease in blood pressure recognized by the juxtaglomerular apparatus which releases renin and begins the process\n\n**At high fluid:** Volume receptors in the atria of the heart and sense when the filling of the heart increases. ANP is released which inhibits aldosterone and ADH. Thus, we don't reabsorb as much water and sodium, so the blood volume drops and thus the blood pressure.\n\n**At low salt levels:** When osmolarity is increased osmosis receptors in hypothalamus shrink - which stimulates the release of ADH.\n\n**At high salt levels:** When osmolarity decreases in the blood osmosis receptors in hypothalamus swell, and send out signals that decreases ADH.",
