This planet has been in a cycle of war and for centuries, with one side fighting to bring humanity together under a single banner, and the rest fighting to retain their power. The former, a Federation, initially had been succeeding in their conquest. The latter recognized this threat and formed an alliance, known as the Colonial Separatists, and began a long process of pushing the Federation back to their original borders. A mission in the frozen desert of the northern hemisphere had discovered a derelict ancient structure, which contained a life form. This being calls itself the Xir, and agreed to assist the humans that released it from stasis with their war. This marked the beginning of the end of this war, and this is where the story begins.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Processing img pnqoekd73d2a1...*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The Xir](https://preview.redd.it/bd1sg9ta3d2a1.png?width=1422&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d8faa207f712da79a2eae719d93af9f6decf608)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Locus](https://preview.redd.it/tj9twspd3d2a1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6862d8f1d59cc7413bff17cf0e82a53b2a4c4ac3)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Federation Humans \\(Left 4\\) and human clones, created by the Xir \\(right 2\\)](https://preview.redd.it/hw3mlxug3d2a1.png?width=3000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=053ec01cb6339870d183f9bffce8c554fc41c8a1)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Former Colonial Separatist scientist \\(Right\\) and her bioweapon.](https://preview.redd.it/jwyzwzil3d2a1.png?width=3000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78d1914f5de09ee743f52b6edd1c2205cde9beb2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The creations of the Xir \\(Tallest 4th from left is the Xir\\)](https://preview.redd.it/tawb18rq3d2a1.png?width=9300&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3a5a7ef70c492b34b1efdc8e78cb5d344a20415)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[+1](https://preview.redd.it/ujyfm8kv3d2a1.png?width=1700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73b8b90a340c025ae5780002864fdfb48fae092a)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Helmet\\/weapon concepts](https://preview.redd.it/mkpopui04d2a1.png?width=1685&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c867144c074b7e4ad3569f80150202e269fc0e9)\n\n  \nThat is all I have to present for now.

Nolan’s Batman trilogy for instance is clearly not sci-fi and closer to noir than any other classic genre. A movie like Guardians on the other hand is clearly sci-fi. I’m interested in the more ambiguous films like Thor (outer space origins but inspired by norse mythology so more fantasy than scifi?), Superman (also alien origins but other than that pretty standard superhero type), Watchmen/Iron Man/Captain America (heavy science/technology elements that explain the heros’ superpowers but no space/intergalactic elements, etc. I’m no expert in either genre so I’m mainly curious to hear the opinions from long time sci-fi fans as to which superhero movies/franchises you would consider the most sci-fi and also what your favorite movies from this genre overlap are.",

        "text": " November 26th, 2022 \n\n“Hi, this is the mummified corpse floating outside the Orion spaceship.  I can’t tell you how curious I am about who you are!  Did Orion just die in lunar orbit and you’re some kind of space salvage person in the distant future?  Are you some kind of explorer and Artemis I has become one of those lost ships of the golden age of discovery?  Did NASA put together a salvage mission and you’re an astronaut?  \n\nDid NASA ever end up going public with the fact that one Alex Whelm stowed away aboard Artemis I and died while trying to repair a faulty sensor causing a computer crash.  Because if you’re reading this - that’s exactly what happened.\n\nOn the off chance it’s still the early 2000’s when you find this, I’d like to ask a favor.  There’s this girl back in Florida, Jessica Hargrave.  Could you let her know what happened to me?  Let her know I’m sorry that I never really valued how she was trying to help me grow as a person, but that she did make me a better man and I can see that now.  Let her know I love her, and she was in my thoughts until the end.\n\nAlso, let NASA know their repair instructions sucked!”\n\nYou’d think I would have written a goodbye note back on Earth before I left.  I probably should have, this is crazy dangerous and was always going to be.  Fact of the matter though, it didn’t even occur to me until I stepped into the airlock, and then writing a quick note seemed like a great excuse to avoid going out.\n\nInventory:  You remember that little emergency tool kit?  I got that and put it into the thigh pocket on my flight suit.  Then I imagined being out in space, opening the case, and all the tools bursting out and floating away in different directions.  So, I opened it inside Orion’s cabin, and that’s exactly what happened.  Thus, I put a different tool in a different pocket until my flight suit was basically full.  The wire cutters went into my right thigh pocket, an adjustable wrench went into my left thigh pocket, the mini-flashlight went into my left forearm pocket, and so on.  \n\nFor extra fun, I couldn’t find any rope.  Rope?  You ask.  Yeah, rope.  See a space suit has little thrusters to let you move around.  Puff, puff, puff, and you drift over to the other side of Orion.  Puff, puff, pull, and you park yourself within hand distance of hatch 17.  Puff, puff, puff, you fly back to the airlock safe and sound.  A flight suit on the other hand lacks these things, and so the second you drift away from Orion by more than your arm’s length, you’re lost in space and will die.  Thus, tying oneself to the ship would be a good idea - if I had rope.  That might have been what one of those plastic ballast cubes were replacing.  \n\nActually, if we’re going to start getting raw about things, how about the fact that the damn space suits are still not ready despite being in development since forever.  That’s right folks, NASA is having a heck of a time buying space suits.  Not bitter.  \n\nYou’re probably curious about my legs, since I don’t have the rubber pressure pieces for them, am I just going out into space with bare legs?  That would be a bad idea.  \n\nIt probably wouldn’t kill me.  But it could well kill my legs, and I use my legs a lot.  \n\nHowever, my legs are pretty undemanding all things considered.  They don’t breathe and I don’t even really need to move them around much.  The only real danger that space presents to them is a pressure difference.  So, I’ve wrapped both my legs, and feet, tightly with duct tape.  Thankfully the rubber pressure bladder underwear is easier to get on this time, and I’ve put about thirty loops of duct tape at the interface point with my legs so that it hopefully won’t leak too much.\n\nThe only other thing I’ve got with me is the leg sized air tank from the emergency atmospheric controls.  I removed it and attached it to my flight suit’s air intake at my thigh.  The valves are compatible, and the tank has a regulator on its valve.  Yes, NASA does do a lot of things right.\n\nI was complaining before about the airlock controls.  That was also a bit unjust of me.  They aren’t that complicated - if you’re a scientist - and I did figure them out.  \n\nSo, time to do something stupid!  I get into the airlock, seal the inner door, and start to depressurize the airlock.  When pressure’s at about 50% the regulator on the tank opens automatically and starts to replace the air being lost through the ill fitting rubber pieces, with frigid air from the emergency tank.   I immediately stop the decompression.  Thankfully there’s a big “abort” button that’s easy to push.  \n\nI spend a few minutes feeling stupid.  PV=nRT.  Idiot PV equals idiot nRT.\n\nThe issue is this.  When compressed gas expands, such as when it is being released from a high pressure tank into a flight suit, its temperature drops.  Which means as soon as that vent on my suit opened, I got a blast of pretty chilly air.\n\nThe problem is that this isn’t a “temperature” thing, it’s an energy thing.  That probably doesn’t make much sense.  Let me explain.  Let’s say it’s a cool day and you’re sitting out on a patio feeling cold.  The cold air washes over you and sucks a bit of energy from your body.  You pull your limbs in, you tighten up your collar, you put on a hat, you do what you can to reduce the energy you’re losing to the air.  You have a temperature problem and you can mitigate it by insulating yourself from that temperature difference.\n\nThat’s a bit like being poor and owing the bank some money.  There are transaction charges, interest, and you can’t afford to do the things you want to do.  It sucks.  But you cut back as much as you can and it’s a long, slow, suck that will make you miserable for months or years.  \n\nYou’re probably thinking the air flowing through my suit is like that.  A cool breeze on a patio.  A bank loan.  A temperature problem and I could put on a sweater.\n\nNo.  I’ve got an energy problem.  This is like being in debt to Tony Soprano and he wants his fucking money.  That’s the expanding gas from a pressure vessel.  It demands a certain amount of energy to expand, and it gets colder, and colder, and colder, in order to strip that energy from the space it is expanding into.  I’m a nice, balmy 98.6 degrees?  It blows in at a chilly 50 - fuck you, where’s my money.  I get cold and drop to 95 degrees?  Fuck you, where’s my money?  It blows in at a frigid 30.  I start going into hypothermia?  Fuck you, where’s my money?  It blows in at 0.  It will rip energy out of my body to expand and all the sweaters in the world won’t help.  I might make it a few minutes, but not long.\n\nSo…  How to borrow money from Tony Soprano and live to tell the tale?\n\nThe obvious solution is to borrow a tiny amount of money.  The less you borrow, the less the vig kills you.  I assume vig means interest.  I actually don’t know though.  Not a good idea to use slang you’re not sure of, but whatever, I’m about to die.  \n\nMy flight suit is losing air through the rubber joints in the bladder, if I can stop that then I won’t have to borrow as much from Tony.  \n\nThe obvious solution involves the glue NASA has onboard to patch leaks in the hull.  If I put some of that onto the rubber where it overlaps I can lock it in place, even if it’s not a perfect seal, it would improve things.  You ever seen the Wizard of Oz where Dorothy is oiling the Tin Man and freeing up his joints?  Well I’d be doing the opposite.  The more glue I use, the less I can move.  Plus, once I glue this together how do I get it off?  \n\nJust cut the flight suit off?  Ok, but that makes leaving Orion a one shot thing.  I’m in space and it would be nice to have a backup if I need it.\n\nHow about more duct tape?  How much pressure can a piece of duct tape really hold?  Let’s use my life to find out!\n\nThe trick is putting the duct tape on the inside of the joints.  Takes some doing, but I get there eventually.\n\nAttempt 2.  This time it’s a lot better.  I get to 70% vacuum before the valve opens, and then it’s an open - close - open - close kind of situation.  The air’s cold.  But I can probably make it a few minutes.  After all, I just have to cut a cable.\n\nHowever, around the same time I’m thinking about a win on that front, my toes start to hurt - a lot.  The duct tape on my legs seems to be doing its job, and even my feet feel ok, but my toes are screaming.  Sorry piggies…\n\nI get a bit of luck when the outer airlock hatch opens.  Just outside the hatch, on the exterior of Orion, is a panel with four spooled cables.  I clip one onto a harness point on my flight suit, and I’m off.  I have about the same range of motion as your ninety year old grandfather, but so long as I go slowly, I make progress.\n\nFor the first few minutes I’m actually glad for the cold air.  I’m sweating.  Between my air tank seeming to have a mind of its own and insisting that I hug it against my body, constantly feeling like I’m drifting away from Orion and going to die in space, and my toes insisting that some madman with a vice is trying to crush them, it’s a pretty stressful experience.  \n\nFortunately for me, panel 17 has a simple hand operated latch to open - which I do.  \n\nUnfortunately for me, panel 17 opens into a mysterious world of wires.  I’d been imagining a nice, slick, clean layout with maybe, maybe, a half a dozen different wire bundles.  Actually, I was really hoping there would be exactly five bundles so I could be sure it was the middle one I needed.  Oh my god, I was thinking of Star Trek.  Every time they open a hatch in engineering it’s so clean and organized and nice, and that’s what I’d been thinking of.  I’m an aerospace engineer and I was taking design tips from Star Trek.\n\nThere have to be at least thirty damn bundles running through this thing, and now that I’m not moving, the air blowing into my suit is freezing cold.   \n\nI’m going to need my hands, and my left is busy holding me onto Orion, so I let go of the air tank.  I’m tethered to it by the air feed anyways…  Nope.  I grab it back.  I’d just had a visions of it slowly twisting and somehow unclasping itself from the vent in my thigh and then happily spinning off into space while I asphyxiate.  Ok…  I sandwich it between my legs.  The pen light is a life saver and I start at the top of the mess.  It turns out the cable bundles are clearly labeled (thanks NASA), and it only takes a few minutes to find the third.  The problem is that cable bundle 3 has at least thirty different wires, and three of them are potentially red and gold.\n\nIf I were naming them, I’d say ‘Sunflower - Crimson’, ‘School Bus - Rust’, and ‘Post-it - Brick’. So what to do?  I could cut all three, but that seems needlessly risky.  This is a decision that’s being made while arctic-cold air is blasting me in the face, and the madman is turning the toe crusher’s screws.\n\nI’m going with School Bus.  If it doesn’t work, and I need to come back out and cut another one, then so be it.  Pen away, wire cutters out, snip, then fold up the ends of the wires so they’re not in the way, tuck the bundle of cables back as best I can, close the hatch, and bob’s your uncle.  \n\nI’m giving some serious thought to the problem of whether I should close my eyes to try and warm them up, or if they might freeze shut if I do that.  The air coming into the suit is insanely cold and I’m getting brain freeze just from the air keeping me alive.  I try not to blink.  \n\nOnce the airlock’s pressurized I pop my helmet and spend a few minutes crying.  My eyes hurt something fierce.  It takes an hour to get the flight suit off and when I strip the duct tape from my legs I take every strand of hair with them.  Why women do this voluntarily…  \n\nMy toes are purple, throbbing, and I can’t move them.  It’s hard not to look at them and imagine them turning black and dead.  If I had to amputate them, the flight suit’s survival kit has a knife in it…  I throw up imagining that. Pro-tip: don’t throw up in space!  I’ll be smelling it for days.\n\nI really should try to reboot the computer, but everything hurts.  I think I strained my back moving myself around on the space walk, my toes are on fire, my head feels like someone took a hammer to it, and my eye balls are cold against my skull in their sockets.  I’m going to bed.\n\nHey, here’s a funny question: if I cut the wrong wire and I need to fix it, how the heck am I going to do that?  Good thoughts to have as you’re drifting off to sleep.  But that’s a life-or-death problem for tomorrow.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI’m Nathan H.

Hopefully with all the future movies (i imagine we’ll cap Denis’s vision off with Messiah and then have a new director of directors for Children, GE, Heretics and Chapterhouse) and tv shows (Sisterhood, Prelude, Legends) it can rival the Star Wars EU.

        "text": "Hey there r/scifi! It is with great pride that I inform you that the final book of the UNSEC Space Trilogy (and the ninth book to bear my name), *Starforge* ([click for cover](https://maxviking.files.wordpress.com/2022/08/starforge-cover.png?w=640)), releases next Tuesday, November 29th! This is the de-facto end of the trilogy that began with *Colony* (2016) and continued in *Jungle* (2019). There's no surprise fourth book, no \"wait for the next installment.\" After six years of reader theories, this is the de facto conclusion to the saga.\n\nAs such, the entire trilogy is on sale this weekend, and you can get both the prior books and pre-order *Starforge* for less than $15, which is a pretty sweet deal. You can click [this link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C9HPCG2) to go right the series page on Amazon, or ...\n\nIf you're the curious type, you can check out free previews of *[Colony](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B01MDSRRFQ&amp;preview=newtab&amp;linkCode=kpe&amp;ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_zg6BzbREGQC47)* and *[Jungle](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B07ZXLT6FP)* at those respective links, and some chapter previews of *Starforge* on my site—but be warned, there are *massive* spoilers even in the opening chapters of each book for the one previous, so if you'd like the mysteries of each book to remain unrevealed, I'd recommend starting with book one. But here are the links if you remain unconvinced: [Chapter 1](https://maxonwriting.com/2022/10/15/starforge-preview-chapter-1-excerpt/), [Chapter 2](https://maxonwriting.com/2022/10/22/starforge-preview-chapter-2-excerpts/), and [Chapter 3](https://maxonwriting.com/2022/10/29/starforge-preview-chapter-3-excerpts/).\n\nYou can also check out a [pre-release reviewer's thoughts on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5096630955?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1), though again be warned of spoilers for the first two books.\n\nIt's been a long journey, but at last it's come to an end. Synopsis for the final book below (with yes, a few spoilers, so I'll black it out)\n\n&gt; &gt;!Mankind stands on the edge of a precipice. The All sweep across colony worlds, consuming everything in their path. Earth has recalled her fleets to Sol, abandoning its charges. Pisces, her independence won, now stands alone as a foe unlike any other threatens from the dark. It is not a question of if the All will attack, but when.!&lt;\n\n&gt; &gt;!Reunited at last, Jake, Anna, and Sweets again find their skills called upon, this time by the new leadership of Pisces. A desperate plan has been conceived, an all-or-nothing long shot out into the darkness of unexplored space to find a means of reactivating the artificial world beneath their feet. If Pisces' weapons can be brought online there remains a chance that the relentless force of the All can be stopped before it extinguishes the light of mankind forever.!&lt;\n\n&gt; &gt;!If. Threats move against them from all sides. The All has set its own plans in motion, determined to finish the work it began so long ago. UNSEC and Earth plot from the shadows, uncompromising under Eidre's vision of a unified empire with Sol at the center, and willing to do anything to bring Pisces back into the fold—even burn it to ashes.!&lt;\n\n&gt; &gt;!The Trio's final journey has begun ... and it's an adventure unlike anything you've ever read before.&lt;!\n\nEnjoy!",

        "text": "November 25th, 2022\n\nThere’s opportunity in crisis.  Never do two stupid things at the same time.  Haste can make any crisis worse.  Indecision is worse than wrong decision.  The right tool for the right job.  There isn’t anything duct tape can’t fix.\n\nThe thing about sayings is that you can usually find two completely contradictory ones for any situation - save and except for leading horses to water and pulling cows up trees, those two are just great.  \n\nPoint is, you technically could look at my situation as a good thing.  Somehow, in my button mashing, I’d managed to turn off Orion.  And as we all know, the best way to fix a frozen computer is to turn it off and on again.  I’d inadvertently turned it off - along with everything else for that matter.  Really, at this point, I just need to find an ‘on’ button, and that should be relatively easy… right?\n\nIt gets even better from there.  The frozen computer checklist is 50 pages long and involves doing things all the hell over the Orion capsule.  Probably it’s about diagnosing the problem and fixing it gently instead of just doing a giant power off/on switch flip (which can’t be great for Orion).\n\nThe power restart checklist is only one page long and all of the buttons for it seem like they are on a single console, and all pretty obviously labeled.  That’s nice.\n\nWhat’s less nice is that the computer freeze checklist involved a lot of little, anonymous, unassuming buttons.  Sure, they were buttons on a spaceship and each one had the potential to kill me in slow and painful ways.  But if there was a “blow the ship up” switch you’d figure NASA would have put it behind a plastic cover, and made it red and foreboding…  \n\nAll the switches on the powerup checklist look exactly as foreboding as that.  Plastic protective covers over them, red and yellow caution paint around them, and a very “push this at the wrong moment and everyone dies,” feel to them.  \n\nI eat a Skor bar.  500 calories a day is a crappy diet and if I’m going to die, I’d like to do it feeling less hungry.\n\nI feel like if this were a proper space drama there would be something I need to do before I do this.  Like move ballast around the ship or rig up some kind of contraption to keep an airlock closed because the reboot cycle automatically opens it.  \n\nMy problem here is that I literally don’t know how any of this stuff actually works, so I’m just a slightly well educated button masher with poor decision making skills.  Well, no point to being a button masher who’s afraid to mash buttons.\n\n“Main Breaker - Reset,” I don’t die.\n\n“Main battery - On,” I don’t die.\n\n“Power Dis. - Auto,” I don’t die.\n\nThree minutes of not dying later and I flip the plastic cover open on a red button labeled “master power”, and say, “On!”\n\nThe Orion’s cabin lights flicker and come on.  The computers start to hum!  The LCD screens burst alive with lines of code cascading over them!  I was less excited the first time I saw boobs.  \n\nWhen the boot up finishes, the displays flip back to the same screens they had been frozen on, this time numbers slowly ticking away.  I’m reaching for the radio when a dialog box pops up on the display in front of me - and the screen freezes like that.\n\n“Error: Comms Frequency Format” The popup box is labeled.  \n\nThe contents read: \n\n“Freq. Invalid: Alex:Faulty\\_ARC-5sensor\\_must\\_be\\_disconnected&gt;&gt;EVA&gt;PANEL17&gt;CABL\\_BUNDL3&gt;CUT\\_GOLD+RED\\_WIRE&gt;RESTART”. \n\nI try the radio.  Dead.  The computer’s back in a deep freeze and I’m looking at that error message, reading it again, and again, and again.\n\nI need another chocolate bar.  Actually, I need a bourbon, but a chocolate bar is all I’ve got.\n\nIt takes me four hours to be sure of what NASA’s asking me to do.  Why so long?  Because I really, really, really, really, want to be wrong about my first impression of that message.  I’m just not.\n\nQuestion: What’s wrong with the ship?  Answer: The ARC-5 sensor is faulty.  It must be feeding data into the computer that’s unexpected and causing a freeze.  Let’s ignore how frustrating it is that NASA’s software is doing that.\n\nSolution:  Disconnect the ARC-5 sensor.  Sounds simple enough.  What is the ARC-5 sensor and should one want to disconnect it, where would one go?\n\nAmong the hundreds of index pages in the emergency manual I found two entries for the ARC-5 sensor.  Both entries are for checklists relating to Orion’s lunar altimeters.  Ok, so it’s some kind of sensor that measures how far Orion is from the moon.  Which would explain why this issue popped up in lunar orbit.  \n\nSo how to disconnect it?  Thus begins the real fun of NASA’s message.  \n\nYou ever wonder whether it’s actually you who’s wrong and everyone else that’s right?  Maybe aluminum really should be pronounced alu-min-ium.  Maybe vehicle really should be pronounced Vee-hickle.  Because, as much as I try, I literally can’t pronounce the phrase extra-vehicular-activity without saying it as extra-Vee-hick-u-lar-activity.\n\nEVA.  NASA wants me, the untrained button masher, to go out into space, alone, and tinker with their multi-billion dollar spaceship.  I want to put that in context for you, because it kind of sounds semi-reasonable when you just say it.  I mean here I am, in space, and when you’re in space, at some point, you’re going to put on a space suit and do something outside the ship, it’s almost expected, like going to Nevada and visiting the grand canyon.\n\nBut NASA literally spends years training astronauts for this.  Just putting on a space suit is a two man - three hour - job that is practiced again and again and again, because it is so easy to get wrong.  \n\nI also do not have a space suit.  I have a flight suit (not its official name, but the space suit is the white one, and the flight suit is the orange one).  One might think they are similar, except for the color, but they are not.  \n\nLet’s say you want to spend the next five hours floating around in space in a space suit.  Here’s what that suit needs to do.  First of all, it has to hold pressure.  It isn’t enough to just have extra air because if it leaks, those leaks are going to push the astronaut around, so it can’t do that.  \n\nSecond it needs to deliver “air” to the astronaut.  You’re probably thinking oxygen.  But oxygen isn’t air.  Air is a mixture of mostly nitrogen, a dash of oxygen, and a very, very, small percentage of CO2.  Too much oxygen and not enough nitrogen?  That’s actually toxic over the long haul, and explosive.  Not enough oxygen?  Ironically that hold your breath feeling comes from the body detecting too much CO2, not a lack of oxygen.  You won’t notice it if you’re running low on oxygen, you’ll just start to get giddy, euphoric, and then… sleepy.  Dead sleepy.\n\nBut that’s an easy problem, really just making sure two valves get twisted in the right ways, compared to the much bigger problem of CO2.  Too much CO2 and, well it’s the plastic bag over your head experience.  Anyways, in a space suit there are filters that absorb the CO2.  The only other alternative is to flush out perfectly good oxygen and nitrogen just because they’re mixed in with the CO2.\n\nA space suit has a complex nitrogen, oxygen, and CO2 filter life support system.\n\nSpace is also super hot and super cold without there being a lot of good ways to cool stuff down.  Space suits have internal water systems to keep the astronaut at a comfortable temperature, and even then it’s not easy.  \n\nThere’s also the whole “suit” part of things.  People imagine clothing that an astronaut can put on and take off.  Really though, you should be thinking mini-space ship.  The ISS uses Russian space suits that are popular because they are the only ones in existence that can be put on, or taken off, by one person.  They accomplish this by literally having a metal hatch on the back of the suit that you climb in and out of.  From crotch to top of the head, the entire back is just metal hatch.  Other space suits rely on segments with pressure seals and you kind of assemble the suit around a person.\n\nA flight suit does absolutely none of that stuff.  You’re only supposed to wear it in the Orion, and then while you’re strapped into your chair, and instead of all those systems I just talked about the flight suit plugs into Orion and it’s Orion’s systems that handle all that stuff.  \n\nIt’s also not airtight.  The hell you say.  No, seriously.\n\nIf, and only if, you’re wearing a flight suit that was specifically fitted for you (and you haven’t been on a crash diet and losing weight like crazy), and you’re in a seated position taking advantage of the pressure from being strapped into your seat, then a layer inside the suit made up of overlapping rubber segments will hold a very low pressure seal (and leak moderately while doing so).  But you’re plugged into Orion and have all the air in the world so why worry?  The pressure the flight suit holds is equivalent to 30,000 feet on earth, or less than half of what you’d get on a beach.\n\nNext problem…  I kind of threw away some of those rubber segments back on Earth.  Moonikin’s feet were smaller than mine, and my thighs were a lot bigger than its.  So the custom made segments just didn’t fit and I tossed them.  \n\nNext. I literally don’t even know how to work the airlock.  I went and looked.  It doesn’t have any buttons that say either “close” or “open”.  So thanks for that NASA.\n\nSo, EVA, to panel 17.  The emergency operations manual, which I’m really starting to think of as a bible at this point, does have a sketch of Orion’s external panels, and there is a panel 17.  It’s on the other side of the ship from the airlock, but it exists.  \n\nNow once I open that panel - and by the way I have no idea if it’s riveted, screwed, or just latched, shut - I have to find a cable bundle 3.    \n\nQuestion:  Do you think that when I open the panel and see a bunch of bundles of cables, there will be some kind of label to tell me which is number 3?  Do you think NASA intends me to find a diagram of panel 17 hidden somewhere inside this, literally, 7,482 page emergency manual before I go out there to try this?  Or do you think I’m supposed to go out there and it’s the third bundle from the left, or the top which I’m supposed to work on?  Because I’ve got no idea.\n\nI can imagine the engineering classes of the future, “so there Alex was, wondering what he should do next, all the while not realizing that the answer was right there in the emergency manual if he’d just thought to look up…”  Look up what?  \n\nI’m too angry to even read a book.  \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI’m Nathan H.

Vortexes, Maglev technology, the Cosmos and NASA’s experiments utilizing them. \n\n  According to recollection, the cover of the book as far as it’s visual appearance, wavers between a hardback reddish brown colored cover with Modern man and Neanderthal man kneeling down to an alien which is passing them light - Had a drawing of an indigenous shaman holding out their hand to someone else who had their had open to receive it In his hand was like a flame. This book was owned, read, and lost back in the 90’s. It would be absolutely phenomenal if you all could help me find it or any sources close too it ! Thank you so much! \n\nTLDR: looking for a book from the 90’s for my mentor Titled “Cosmic keys of life” about a A former NASA engineer and his notes on various technologies /other phenomena .

The actual travel in it involves instant teleportation jumps through real space, and the dragons live in real space, they are beings that inhabit the space between stars, meaning if you went far enough from any regular star with regular space flight you could find one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I heard the movie blackhole from 1979 did it first which seems like it might be right, except I watched that movie and I can't tell if the probe itself is going through hell or not, or if the act of hyperspace makes the occupants just hallucinate hell. The depiction of the probe travelling through hyperspace is completely separate from the hellish depictions after the probes occupants fall unconscious. \n\nI get the feeling that the writers intention was for the characters to hallucinate a hellish place more than it was for the probe to physically travel through space-hell, but I'm unsure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I got put on to Approaching Centauri comic by Moebius from 1977.\n\nI think this one is by far the closest in depiction, but again I'm not sure if the space ship is physically travelling through space hell.\n\nWhat makes it more confusing is that two different copies have different wordings\n\nThis one says \"You were thrown outside the time space continuum!\" during warp travel... which suggests to me that the ship is travelling in one dimension for hyper space, and the pilot is 'projected' into another hellish dimension, therefor the space ship is not physically travelling through space-hell itself.\n\n[https://orano.tumblr.com/post/95665574744/snakebomb-approaching-centauri-philippe](https://orano.tumblr.com/post/95665574744/snakebomb-approaching-centauri-philippe)\n\nbut then theres another version of this comic which has different text, its says \"You must have projected right outside the contnuum!\" \n\nIs continuum short hand for the space time continuum in scifi? or does it mean something else here? can a ships shields be called a continuum and he was just projected a few miles outside the ship, or something?\n\n[https://rottenoak.tumblr.com/post/46689381409/approaching-centauri-philippe-druillet-and](https://rottenoak.tumblr.com/post/46689381409/approaching-centauri-philippe-druillet-and)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nif anyone can get a clearer answer, or knows some other example than this pls share",

What I would give to live in a place like that!! Also, the drones!! Best drones I've seen in any sci-fi movie!!\n\nI watched it again and had some doubts about the timeline, couldn't find any answers on the \"explained\" videos on YT. May be someone can enlighten me :)\n\nSo, when the survivor (Julia) is rescued and Jack brings her back to the station, Vika says it has been 60 years since the war began. In the flashbacks (when Jack listens to the flight recording), he apparently ejects the sleeping pods before being sucked into the Tet, and the pods were supposed to be programmed to return back to Earth. The Jack and Vika clones are created by the Tet after they are sucked into it and sent down to Earth to capture it. \n\nBut what actually happens is that the Scav beacon only brings down the sleep pods in present time and which makes me question the timeline. \n\n1. Has it really been 60 years since the Tet arrived like Vika says?\n2. If it hasn't been 60 years, then was the Tet able to churn out clones that quickly?\n3. If it has been 60 years, then why did the sleep pods not come down to Earth earlier as programmed? Because the Tet seems to be in Earth's orbit so it shouldn't take the pods so long to descend.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/z3slqp/eight_recommended_lovecraftian_scifi_and_fantasy/",
        "text": "[https://unitedfederationofcharles.blogspot.com/2022/11/eight-recommended-lovecraftian-books.html](https://unitedfederationofcharles.blogspot.com/2022/11/eight-recommended-lovecraftian-books.html)\n\nHoward Phillips Lovecraft remains one of the more controversial writers of the 20th century. A fantasy and science fiction visionary, he helped create a whole new concept of horror with his weird fiction concepts. The Great Old Ones, Necronomicon, Nyarlathotep, and creatures like the Deep Ones have resonated with generations of readers. He was also personally kind of a dick with racial beliefs extreme even by his time (so much so that Robert E. Howard told him to dial it the fuck down) as well as politics we can safely say were \"questionable.\"\n\nNevertheless, his perhaps most admirable quality as a writer was the fact that he was never afraid to let alone else play with his toys. An early advocate of what we'd now call \"open source\" writing, he happily shared concepts and ideas with his fellow writers. There's a reason so many unnameable horrors and weird gods appear in Robert E. Howard's work. Also, he and Robert Bloch of Psycho fame took turns killing each other off in their stories. Howard Phillips would be delighted at the longevity of his creations and the fact that he has entertained thousands of people through things like the Call of Cthulhu tabletop games or Re-Animator movies.\n\nSpeaking as the author of the Cthulhu Armageddon books as well as participant in such anthologies as Tales of the Al-Azif and Tales of Yog-Sothoth, I thought I would share some of my favorite post-Lovecraftian fiction created by writers willing to play around with HPL's concepts.\n\n**8.** ***The Trials of Obed Marsh*** **by Matthew Davenport**\n\nObed Marsh remains one of HPL's more fascinating characters despite the fact he never appears on screen. A sea captain, he sold the entirety of his community's souls and future to the Deep Ones in exchange for gold as well as fish. However, in any time there is economic despair, it becomes understandable when you might be willing to make a deal with the (Sea) Devil. Matthew Davenport is also the author of the Pulpy fun Andrew Doran novels but this remains my favorite of works.\n\n**7.** ***The Atrocity Archives*** **by Charles Stross**\n\nCombing the absolute horror of the Great Old Ones with the mundanity of being a British civil servant, even one that just happens to be a field agent and spy. The Laundry is a fantastic book that is somehow humorous, terrifying, and philosophical all at once. Bob Howard is a great character and is the only man in the world who can stand against the forces of darkness through the power of mathematics. Except, really, he knows he's eventually going to lose and he's mostly just trying to delay CASE NIGHTMARE GREEN for a few years at best.\n\n**6.** ***14*** **by Peter Clines**\n\nPeter Clines and I were notably both coming up in Permuted Press when that company got bought out by people who subsequently began printing Oliver North and other Far Right authors. Abandoning ship, both of us found better deals. I was overwhelmed by how much I loved his Ex-Heroes books where superheroes fought zombies. They had their flaws but got better each book until they were cancelled. 14 is even better as our protagonists are staying at a surreal apartment building where the mysteries of what its purpose as well as horrors is an onion to unpeal.\n\n**5.** ***The Elder Ice*** **by David Hambling**\n\nDespite the popularity of the Call of Cthulhu games, there's a surprising lack of Lovecraftian detective fiction out there. You'd think the company would have been marketing books like TSR had been fantasy in the Eighties and Nineties. The Harry Stubbs series, starting with the Elder Ice, is as close to it as I've found. A WW1 British boxer, he is always coming within a hair's breadth of destruction at the Mythos' hands but avoids enough of it to keep his sanity and life. For the most part.\n\n**4.** ***The Burrowers Beneath*** **by Brian Lumley**\n\nThe Titus Crow series is one of the biggest influences in my writing career because it is such an incredibly batshit crazy series. A Sherlock Holmes and Watsonian pair of occultists, Titus Crow and his assistant Henri de Marigny start with a war against a new Great Old One sending monstrous sandworm-esque monsters around the world to hunt them. Then it goes from there. I love this book and think its the Masks of Nyaralthotep literary equivalent I always needed. I recommend the audiobook over the Kindle because Tor refuses to release the rights to the series back to Brian Lumley or get him a decent cover.\n\n**3.** ***The Ballad of Black Tom*** **by Victor Lavalle**\n\nVictor LaValle has a complicated relationship with HPL, being a man of color who loved the writings of the author but felt excluded by his world. Adapting The Horror of Red Hook, Victor LaValle tells the story of a (not very good) jazz musician who finds himself immersed in a complicated occult conspiracy with the police, an eccentric millionaire, plus unlimited power to a man who might be able to overthrow a corrupt power structure.\n\n**2.** ***Lovecraft Country*** **by Matt Ruff**\n\nProbably the most famous book on this, Lovecraft Country has already been adapted into a series by HBO that (sadly) only lasted one season. The story of a family of motorist guide writers who find themselves invited to a millionaire occultist's home only to become involved in a series of fascinating encounters with the supernaturals. The book is, in my opinion,better than the series as well as significantly lighter. Which is impressive given how dark the book can be at times.\n\n**1.** ***The Litany of Earth*** **by Ruthanna Emrys**\n\nThe top recommendation here is by Tor reviewer, Ruthanna Emrys. An interesting interpretation of HPL's world from a reversed position. Basically, the Deep Ones and their human families were put in internment camps as of The Shadow of Innsmouth but released after WW2. Aphra Marsh is one of the few survivors and is struggling to reintegrate into American society. Dealing with a cult of white people who have misinterpreted her people's religion, it sets up the excellent Innsmouth Legacy books. It is available for free on the Tor site: [https://www.tor.com/2014/05/14/the-litany-of-earth-ruthanna-emrys/](https://www.tor.com/2014/05/14/the-litany-of-earth-ruthanna-emrys/)",
