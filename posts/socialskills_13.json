        "text": "Idk if this is common in other countries, but being an introvert in my country is really hard. I've literally heard students gossiping about me behind my back.\n\nI'm 17m in highschool. In my country, 5th - 10th grade is middle school and 11th &amp; 12th is highschool. Each year ends in May &amp; I'm in 12th. At the start of my highschool, I hoped that I would meet someone I knew in middle school but I was the only student from my class (one class has 50 students. There are 7 classes for a standard for middle school.) so, I wasn't able to make new friends quickly (There are 150 students in my year in highschool). But it was okay cause I tried to not bother anyone and focus on my studies. But there were students from same middle school but different class and they knew I'm an introvert. And I think that's when everything started.\n\nEven in 8th - 10th in middle school, I was known as the quiet kid but I never really got angry or fought with anyone. In highschool, I used to sit alone on front bench, pay attention to teachers, leave alone on bicycle, I was nice around teachers. But I was satisfied with the life. But then after like first semester of 11th grade, people used to come to me and ask, \"Why don't u talk with someone ?\" &amp; \"What happened? Why are u always so quiet?\" And I used to react with just a smile and go away cause I can understand y they're asking. \n\nBut people then started talking behind me (yes, I heard them talking), used tricks to make me confuse, small things to scare me, making fun of me and laughing while looking at me. Now that's too much. Like WTF? Someone punctured my bicycle twice in a year (I know someone did it cause when I asked the mechanic, he checked the tube &amp; tyre in front of me) I live like 7km away from my highschool so it was a big problem for me. Ofc there were good people too but for some reason, I didn't get along with them well when I tried.\n\nI was always like, \"nah it's okay I'm going to go out of here in some months anyways\" but I felt it more when I went to a Study Seminar in February in a local theatre...\n\nSo, I saw that the seminar is going to happen in newspaper, and I thought it might be something worthwhile and it's in my area so it won't be a problem. I went there with a scooter and I saw a group of students in my highschool there (3girls 2boys). It was like 30min before seminar So I went there and spoke with them a little. But apparently, they had no interest in the seminar and they were just there for like a hangout or something. There was another big group of girls (15-20) not from our highschool who were taking selfies and photos. And these guys &amp; girls in my group were talking about how stupid they are for taking selfies when it's a study seminar. I understand they're talking like that cause, maybe they thought those girls are irritating... So I didn't know what to say And, I thought it's better to be quiet than speaking about something that I don't know.\n\nThey were talking and I found that they've made a big social media group of all students in my year who live in my area. And the admin was the one who literally lives in an apartment building besides me. But I understand that I never approached anyone so they thought maybe I would reject if they ask me. But later they started taking selfies and snap &amp; insta (I don't use any of those) so to relieve tension, I offered them to take their photos, I tried to smile, tried to be friendly but the seminar started so I went in alone and they came in little late. I sat a little away from them cause I wasn't with them but I saw them staring at me. After the seminar, I tried to talk to them but they fuckin ignored me. I thought it was my time to leave and I did.\n\nThere never were any people around my age in my society. And that guy that lives in the apartment building besides me, he  moved there couple of years ago. Tbh, that guy is a genius. He is one of the top of all the highschool. I always looked up to him he is like my living idol lol.\n\nI was just thinking for next two days. I didn't study, I didn't eat well... I thought, \"Is this normal?\"\n\nI started questioning and doubting myself. Did I do something rude? Is it alright to not be able to know what others are doing? Did I miss a chance to make friends? Was this my last apportunity? Have I been doing the wrong thing for last couple of years? Is it a good thing or a bad thing that I'm not friends with them?\n\nI just don't know what to do. I got two months left of this year. Maybe If I pass, I'll go to university.",

        "text": "I would consider myself a pretty social gal, have been since a kid. But I’ve only started  noticing the past few years what *truly* contributes to making a conversation, non awkward, interesting, and fulfilling. These are my top factors! With strangers, different age groups, etc.\n\n1: ***remaining eye contact*** when in close proximity, far proximity. It sounds like such a basic factor in a conversation. But surprisingly, I note whoever I talk to is a eye contact-person. I feel as the other person is so much more engaged, &amp; vice versa when we are making eye contact. It’s more easier said than done for some people, but with more practice &amp; mental note when talking to people to remain eye contact, you will find it so much easier &amp; better when you talk to people!\n\n2: ***always let the other person finish talking.*** cutting off someone is always extremely irritating, even without realizing. Let them finish speaking first before you do, &amp; if you do cut them off by accident, *do not* just continue speaking, apologize &amp; say smt along the lines of.. “oh I’m sorry, you go ahead haha.” One of my biggest pet peeves is when people continuously cut me off, as generally other people feel the same.\n\n3: ***a 50/50 conversation*** is very important. No one likes a self centered person. Listening to someone talk about themselves during an entire conversation that doesn’t have to with them is draining af. Incorporate your perspectives &amp; ideas when the other person insinuates your turn—&amp; vice versa. Unless a conversation is based upon either party entirely, always try to chime in 50/50 effort. Engage, but also be engaging.\n\n3a: ***ask questions.*** part of being 50/50. Asking questions in a conversation to keep it flowing is key. If the other person is not being 50/50 and asking you questions back as well, not necessarily your fault, but you’re likely not gonna get the most fulfilling conversation unless you’re more intrigued on talking about solely them. \n**Bad conversation Ex:** *p1:* “how was your weekend?” *p2:* “My weekend was good.” (No follow up question to the other person at all.) this typically runs the conversation dry!\n**good ex:** *p1:* “how was your weekend?” *p2:* “my weekend was pretty good! how about you?” *p1:* “mine was also pretty well, thanks!* *p2:* “that’s good to hear, what’d you do?” Following with a question to the other person continues the conversation &amp; leaves openings for other potential topics !\n\nthese are main top fundamental factors in a solid conversation. A solid conversation does not have to be long, but as long as both parties are visibility comfortable, I take that as a good sign the conversation went well! Hope this helps anybody! &lt;3",

        "text": "Sorry this is going to be a long post. Here I'll use the names Sammy (the allistic) and Vicky (the autistic) in these 2 examples.\n\nWhen we comment somebody's weight gain behind someone's back (it shouldnt be happening in either case i know!):\n\nAllistic treatment: ....\"hahahaha I think so too..must have been all the cocktails she drank over the holidays (they all smile with each other)\"! * The \"weight gain\" person doesn't find out so the \"allist\" is respected and life goes on as normal.\n\nAutistic treatment: \"Yeah SO Vicky... That WAS NOT a very nice thing to say Vicky\"! * the \" weight gain\" person finds out and confronts Vicky. Vicky is then accused of starting the fight and is further isolated.\n\nWhen someone comments on our weight gain in front of us:\n\nAllistic treatment: the 3rd person in the room turns around, smiles with Sammy and says in a friendly manner \"oh it doesn't matter he always does that to everybody\". The 3rd person nods head side to side and continues to smile with Sammy to show some form of sympathy. Sammy feels secure and well liked.\n\nAutistic treatment: Nobody steps in to defend Vicky immediately. Once weight gain commenter becomes absent Vicky asks why those comments were made about her and why nobody defended her. The reply she gets \"well Vicky he was right... you have been eating a lot lately so don't mind his comments... he's saying it for YOUR benefit OK Vicky?\" Vicky goes from feeling bad to worse.\n\nCommenting on anybody weight gain like in the examples above is NOT right but notice the stark difference in treatment allistics and autistics get? It seems allistics are MUCH more respected and protected while autistics are humiliated and isolated. I know not all autistics are treated as bad as this (and good for them!) but a lot of us still are and it makes us feel like 3rd class people to be honest!\n\nHow shall we cope with being treated like s*** and all without feeling a great sense of anger and injustice?",

I know it's a two-way street but I can't remember the last time someone reached out to me. And I feel like it's hard to make friends outside of a very stable work or school setting where you're consistently around the same people for long periods.\n\nI am even starting to feel salty that my gf has so many friends and groups around her (she's obviously been here much longer than I have, and I get it takes time, but it's still frustrating for some reason). But even if she only sees said friends once in a blue moon, I am feeling extremely envious of sheer fact that she knows so many people.\n\nI'm obviously doing something wrong, and I am desperate to figure out what that might be, whether it's an external mistake I'm making in the social world or an internal mistake that I'm making with how I view myself. Just feel hopeless and frustrated and would love some insight. Thanks.",

Being in the house is just way too depressing because of the state of my life right now and I just need to fill my time to not lose my mind. I always see people on social media talk about taking yourself out and how fun and good for you that can be. I love all types of nights out but I’ve never done it alone. I want to go to a comedy show on Saturday by myself and get dolled up and feel good about myself and have a drink or two, but I’m so self conscious about potential stares and being hyper aware about the fact that I’m alone. I always hear that no one cares or pays attention, is that really true even for things typically meant to be done with others? What’s your experience? Any advice",

I do now, but knowing what it means does nothing to help me. I take what most people tell me at face value. They tell me they are okay? Then I accept that, and it turns out they weren't okay at all. If they say they are okay, and I ask them are they sure, do they need anything or want to talk about it, then I'm too pushy or reading into it too much. I have a hard time telling when people aren't being straight forward.\n\nToday my fiancé asked me to talk to someone for them. So I did. Then a bit afterwards they said \"But not today, I'd rather it be tomorrow because I'm tired now and it's late.\" But I had already talked to the person they wanted me to talk to. So now, I am being told to learn to \"read the room\" better because I should have known they didn't want to talk to that person right now, even though *they* asked me to to do so.\n\nI just don't understand how I'm expected to read people's minds. They say it should be obvious or come naturally if I'm paying attention, but it just doesn't. No matter how much I pay attention it doesn't help. So people think I don't care or that I'm not putting in effort because of it. I've been like this all my life, and I don't get why people can't just be straight forward with me. How am I supposed to learn to \"read the room\" better? It just feels like no matter how hard I try I always get it wrong.",

But something happened at college the other day I don’t really know how to feel about it, I think i may have made a potential friend?\n\nI arrived at college early to do some homework and as I was arriving this girl I sit near in class was walking in the building at the same time. To my surprise she said hi to me and started talking to me. I was honestly caught really off guard and didn’t know what to do but I was just trying to be friendly back. She asked me if I had done the reading for class, to which I explained that I hadn’t and that’s why I arrived early. She said she didn’t do it either and that’s why she’s early too, then offered me a copy of the reading that she had printed. I already had the reading on my laptop but I accepted just to be polite. Then we sat at tables next to each other and did the reading.\n\nAfter we finished we started talking about it and I got up and moved to her table so it would be easier to talk, we just discussed it and talked about class a bit. Then somehow we started talking about other stuff and it turns out we have a lot in common (same major, similar hobbies/interests, both commuters etc). We ended up exchanging discords so we could exchange Switch friend codes later, she said she would like to play together sometime. We probably talked for at least half an hour and were actually almost late to class because we got so caught up talking lol. It was really fun and I laughed a lot more than I have in a long time.\n\nAfter class we walked out together and when we were saying bye she said something like “I’m glad we talked, we have so much in common.” \n\nI felt really happy after all this and as soon as I got home I sent her my switch friend code on discord and she sent me hers. This whole thing was a completely new experience for me. I kind of want to message her to ask if she would like to hang out before class again on monday to play together, but I’m afraid of coming across the wrong way. I don’t want her to think I “like” her or something. And I haven’t heard from her since exchanging friend codes thursday evening. \n\nDid i make a friend?\n\nThanks!",

(i never thought about the 13F girl sexually) \n\nI actually don't know what I wanted to hear from posting this, I'm more worried about being friends with her cause she trusts me a lot and I'm a male teenager.",

        "text": "I am 18 with no friends. I know I am still young and have long road ahead, but I still cannot shake the feeling that I will forever be alone. To my knowledge I have always been the goody or ditsy friend, but I have never had any close friends except one. All my friendships are nothing past acquaintance status because they never last. I am aware of my issues and maybe toxic traits but some things I feel like I am unable to fix. I have always been a little awkward and never knew how to fit in, so with that I absorbed a bit of everyone’s personality to be liked but, that only went so far. I always had trouble with small talk and starting conversations. I either never know how to properly end it or what to say. If I do not have a topic in mind I wont have nothing to give. I try asking them about themselves or leaning the conversation towards them but it doesn’t go far. I only have a few hobbies which is drawing and music so continuing a conversation isn’t as easy. I did have potential friendships but since I don’t have a car, hanging out is limited. I also forgot to mention that I am black. This might be offensive but I never could fit with other black folks either because even when I tried It never lasted. I gravitated towards the wrong crowds because in my young mind being disrespectful and rude was cool and lot of the kids I hung out with were I guess ghetto. Well years later I decided I would change that and I did. Except I not only tried to change myself as a person but I tried to act like entirely different or I guess you could say, “white”. Well this whole facade has been going on since 2019. On top of this, I have an incredibly low self esteem. It all stems from past events and I guess anxiety. I feel like alien amongst peers and overthink my response to everything. I accepted that I will probably never have any friends or a relationship but sometimes I still feel alone. Even when I do manage to make friends here and there I always get exhausted of the constant contact eventually I want a break. Sometimes I feel like I’m not smart enough especially when I have a lighter tone when I am around people I don’t really know. I also feel like I come off as intimidating because of my resting face. With the tone of my voice added, I feel like people may not take me serious and I feel like I less respected.",

It seems like I can see someone struggling with something physically, and feel nothing. Or someone in a wheelchair obviously exerting themselves to get up a ramp, and kind of feel sorry for them but not help them out of a seemingly-abstract anxiety. Sometimes I have to remind myself of my principles to actually help someone.\n\nI've been told off for this several times. Most of all I just want to be more compassionate. What are some things I can do to get better at this? Besides of course just taking more seriously, which I'm doing. Thanks for reading.",

This is the first time you're hearing about it and they've been sorta talking about it all after noon. \n\nLater on in the evening, you're watching TV with friend X in my room, having a good conversation. Friend X mentioned that friend Y just wanted the OG group going, which was why I wasn't invited and is bummed as he isnt able to go due to finances. (Out of country festivals are insanely expensive. Especially with flights right now) he was being kind to the situation since he noticed I was excluded. Which I respected. \nWe continue on regular conversation when friend W walks in and starts talking to friend X about details of Disney land and which destinations they should go to, since friend X has been there before. \n\nFriend W keeps talking about this trip for maybe a good 15 minutes while I sat in silence.\n\nFor some background, I had my birthday this December, rented an over priced party bus and planned a whole night with all our friends, including friends W, X, Y, Z - asking for nothing in return except them to show up. They did. \n\nFriend W, Z and I are roommates.\n\nSo my question is, Is friend W being rude? Or pulling a power move by interrupting me and friend X while hanging out? Or is he just excited about this trip?",

She’s told me several times that I’m wasting my life away at home and that I need to get some friends and enjoy my life. I get annoyed when she says things like that because it’s hard to even find purpose in my life. I get constant judgement from her and she called me lame today for not being as social as her, she said I’ll live my whole life with social anxiety and no social skills and die alone. Which is not even close to the truth, I have social skills and absolutely no issues talking to anyone. I just prefer to be alone which is not a big fucking deal , I have friends I talk to almost daily and just because I don’t leave my house doesn’t mean I don’t have friends.

I wanted to share a deeply personal story about my struggles with self-consciousness and how it motivated me to make a positive change in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrowing up, I lost several teeth as a teenager and had to get crowns. This experience made it incredibly difficult for me to show my teeth, and I felt incredibly self-conscious about my smile. I avoided taking pictures and felt like my smile was holding me back from social interactions and opportunities in life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI vividly remember feeling anxious and constantly thinking about how to hide my teeth when speaking, laughing, or even communicating on video calls. This insecurity affected my confidence and prevented me from fully expressing myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was not until I made the decision to take action and transform preventative dental care that I was able to overcome my smile insecurities. I left my job as a chief aerospace engineer and used my background in engineering and AI to make preventive dental care free and accessible to all people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy goal was to ensure that no young person would have to go through the same struggles that I faced and be limited by their smile. I wanted to create a world where everyone could have access to quality dental care and feel confident in their smiles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThrough this journey, I learned the importance of dental care and how it can impact our lives. Taking care of our teeth not only improves our physical health but also our mental health and self-esteem. I am now proud of my smile and feel confident expressing myself in social situations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope that my story inspires others to take action and make positive changes in their lives. We all have the power to transform our insecurities into opportunities for growth and change. Let's work together to create a world where everyone has access to quality dental care and can feel confident in their smile.",

The last time I got one, I think, was when I was a young teen. I've only received them from men of 40+, a lot older then I was. I always looked younger than my actual age.\nI always assumed this happened to me on accident. I was a thin girl and my weak hand got crushed by this strong man hand by mistake. Or maybe they thought to compensate for my weak grip on their hand by squeezing harder.\nBut I just find it hard to imagine squeezing someone's hand so hard during a shake that you actually hurt them in the process. \n\nWhat do you think is more likely? Crushing a young girls hand by mistake, or could it be some weird creepy power move?\n\nDoes anyone else have experienced this?",

I’m sure any amount of activity does boost your reach. But the last thing I want is to encourage an IG stalker who takes this as an opportunity to thirsty comment every time I post. Or worse, tries to find me IRL.\n\nMy other route is to block people and delete comments like this as they happen. I’ve done it before, but I’m not sure if that’s overkill and a waste of my time. Maybe most of these people would just forget about it and move on after one comment anyway?",

        "text": "Hi! So to introduce myself I’m a 20 yo guy from western France. I’m studying history at university. I’m writing this post because I often feel lonely despite having some people around me. I feel like I have a pretty empty social life and I feel I made mistakes in previous years.\n\nThe thing is, I don't think I have terrible social skills, I’m not that shy, I can talk in public and my friends find me pretty funny. I don’t have the impression I’m boring either, I like to talk about a lot of subjects. I honestly have no clue what the problem is and what to start with.\n\nI have a few friends, about 4 or 5. I really enjoy it when I see them, but we never talk outside of going out. They pretty much never answer my messages, but when I see them in person they tell me how happy they are to see me, which I find quite weird. I know some of them are pretty busy with their work but still. I don’t know if I can call them “close friends” as we see each other once every ½ months, and never talk outside of that. On top of that, most of these friends are old friendships, I didn’t make any friends in the last 3 years. Would you say that’s normal? I’m “friendly” with a lot of people at the uni, but nothing close to a friendship. I feel like I annoy people if I try too much to be friends with them, and most people already have a friend group. I try to be nice to people around me in general, especially if they’re friendly too, I listen to what they talk about, what interests them, etc. All my friends are often busy seeing other friends, and I feel like I’m a secondary friend to everyone. That makes me very sad and I often want to cry when I think about that.\n\nWhen I think about things that can turn down some people about me, I know I can be really honest sometimes with people I don’t know that much, even when that would not be socially acceptable, and I might seem rude to some people. I also tend to talk a lot about things I like and I sometimes don’t know if the person I'm talking to is genuinely interested or just polite.\n\nI feel like I’m wasting my youth and that I’m going to regret it in future years. I have the impression that all of that happened naturally and gradually for people around me over the years, during high school and such. But I don’t know what to start with, do you have any idea?\n\nI saw a therapist for \\~2 years but that didn’t help a lot about relationships in general. I also take some light antidepressants.\n\nI feel like I’m not really legitimate posting here as my situation is not terrible and just seems like whining.\n\nThanks for reading, tell me if you think I missed important information, Leo.",

        "text": "for context, I'm not good socially and I don't have many friends. \n\nalso, we'll call this individual R.\n\nyesterday we were in a groupchat and messing around. he sends me a gif of a guy saying, \"who fucking asked? not me. is this a classroom? I don't see a teacher. dumbass. the fuck?\"\n\nI think this is pretty funny, so I message him back privately on whatsapp.\n\n\"fuck you bitch go to hell\"  \n\"zero respect for women smh my head\"\n\nfor context, earlier, we were talking about black history month and women's history month, and joking about how we couldn't insult each other in those months (he's black and I'm a girl obv)\n\nand then he later messages me on two different platforms.\n\non instagram: \"this is wild\" with a screenshot of the mssages\n\non whatsapp: \"woooooow it was just for laughs\".\n\nI respond, \"I'm sorry I was just joking\". he says, \"if you say so\".\n\nwhat I assume happened was that \"go to hell\" is actually way more offensive than I thought it was. we tell each other \"fuck you\" as a joke, and I didn't think this was much worse. once before, I told him to go to hell and he responded with \"that's wild\". I don't even know what \"that's wild\" means.\n\nwe message back and forth for a little longer, and I can see that he's left me on read overnight. in the past two months we've been texting, he has never left me on read.\n\nhere's something else: a week earlier, R confessed to me that he liked me. and I rejected him via a really awkward phone call. but he said he still wanted to be friends with me.\n\noverall this is kind of complicaed and sort of petty. but I'm still thinking about it nonetheless. should I apologize? I didn't realize how offensive I was being until this morning when I was thinking about it. I don't even know what's so bad about \"go to hell\". and also, it would be incredibly awkward because just had a serious talk with him barely a week ago. I wish I wasn't like this. I wish I could catch social cues and know how to be funny without hurting people.",

        "text": "As the title says. \n\nI’ve realized in almost all facets of my life, I am slightly judgmental of people. I’m at the gym and there’s someone else there? He’s jacked? Damn, he’ll probably be an ass to me for no reason, so if he gets in the way of the machine I want to use, I’m just not going to use the machine as to not “bother” him.\n\nTurns out, dude is really nice. He straight up comes up to me and tells me “let me know if I’m in your way”. \n\nI feel like this isn’t fair to these people. All these things I’m afraid of don’t even ever happen. I’m judging these people before they even say a word to me. And it makes me afraid of interacting with them. \n\nI also think a part of it comes from me comparing myself to people a lot. I’ll compare myself in a way that either makes them “better” than me, or vice versa. \n\nI know there was never malicious intent behind it, but my mom would compare me to other kids growing up, usually putting me in a positive light. This has resulted in me often doing the same thing to myself as an adult, but also comparing myself to others in a negative way….\n\nAny advice for overcoming this? I feel like this is something that makes it harder for me to make friends tbh",
