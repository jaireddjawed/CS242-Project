We had a group of friends over for dinner and there were mixed results about which of the two batches was preferred. Personally, in a blind taste test I couldn't really tell the difference. \n\nFor this recipe, does the slow cooking make the difference in tomato quality negligible? Or should we have been able to taste a difference (pretty new to cooking)? Given the price difference I'm pretty happy with the results produced by the giant Costco can of tomatoes but am wondering if we should give it another try using San Marzano tomatoes.\n\nAnyone else try this recipe? Thoughts appreciated!",

Now I make ramen as often as I can, making my own variations of from-scratch ramen and fortifying instant packets. \n\nThe one thing that stands in the way of my goal of making great ramen is the damn six minute egg. \n\nI've tried it at a rolling boil and at 190 degrees as suggested by Kenji and I still have about a 90% failure rate. \n\nI use large eggs (used to use Jumbos) and always try to get the freshest possible. I bring the water to a boil and lower in the egg (generally room temp egg). I then quench in an ice bath afterwards and peel underwater. Sometimes I do the put-it-in-tupperware-and-water-and-shake method. \n\nMy peel always starts well but once I get past halfway the egg always seems to....slide apart like it's undercooked. The white can't hold it's shape and the yolk tumbles out into the sink, where it explodes. \n\nI live at 700 feet above sea level...if that matters. \n\nWhat am I doing wrong? Is it just undercooked? My success increases if I go to seven minutes...but it's called a six minute egg. If I cooked for 5:45 like Kenji says, I don't think I'd even be able to start the peel.  Any advice?\n\nThanks in advance",

The rapid boil acts quickly to emulsify things if the gelatin level is appropriate. Which means the cooking can start at a simmer, and build up later! So you can actually start this the night before, keep things at a safe, low temp during the night, and then crank it up to high heat the next day, with the same results.\n\nSo why not go back to the pressure cooker. After 2 hours in the pressure cooker, I got the clear pork broth that Kenji got in his original recipe, but boiling it wouldn't emulsify the broth all the way.\n\nI tried using the immersion blender and holy crap that did the trick super quickly. I got my creamy tonkotsu broth almost instantly!\n\n**tl;dr**  \nFor 2 hour tonkotsu ramen broth, follow [this](http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/02/how-to-make-tonkotsu-ramen-broth-at-home-recipe.html) recipe but  \n1) use a pressure cooker for 2 hours instead  \n2) use an immersion blender on the broth right after",

Did I do something wrong? I'd really like to make the smashed burgers in the future but the smoke was a bit much for it to be a regular thing. I did have my range fan on but I live in a rental so it's not vented to the outside, just blows it back towards the rest of the kitchen. My process was as follows:\n\nI used a heavy bottomed stainless steel pan. Heated on high for 2 minutes, as directed. Had 4oz balls on ground beef. Salt and peppered. Placed one round ball at a time in the center of the pan, used two spatulas to smash down. Waited until the top started to turn pink-ish, flipped over, placed cheese on top, waited about 60 more seconds, and removed from the pan. The crust was incredible and the cheese was perfectly melty. \n\nAny way to make these again without smoking up the entire house?",

        "text": "So this is a true story that I wanted to share on how Serious Eats pulled through for my wife &amp; I while travelling from MS to VA this past summer.\n\nMy wife, on rare occasion, gets heartburn flareups. When she does, she usually relies on [Blenheim](http://www.blenheimgingerale.com/) Ginger Ale to ease the symptoms. Unfortunately, this past summer, a flareup occurred at the worst possible time.\n\nAs I mentioned, we were traveling back to VA from MS and we're on the road pretty early. While in western AL, approaching Birmingham, she's telling me her heartburn is getting worse. So, after finding that Blenheim isn't distributed anywhere nearby, I then Google something like, \"Alabama local ginger ale\" and surprisingly to me, there was this [article](http://drinks.seriouseats.com/2012/01/soda-buffalo-rock-ginger-ale-rocks-my-sinuses.html) Kenji posted about [Buffalo Rock](http://www.buffalorock.com/) doing wonders to the sinuses.\n\nBeing a big fan of Serious Eats and telling my wife about the past successes of their recipes in our kitchen, I mentioned we should seek this brand out. We swing into a Publix shortly after they had opened and picked up a 12-pack at half the cost of a 6-pack of Blenheims.\n\nLong story short, she was successfully on the road to recovery that day.\n\nThanks Serious Eats!",

        "text": "I'm just learning to bake bread and I've been working with [Jim Lahey's No Knead Bread](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11376-no-knead-bread). I may move to [the food lab's no knead recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/06/better-no-knead-bread-recipe.html), but have a few problems / questions first. \n\nProblems:\n\n*  The dough sticks to everything. I'm convinced it would give teflon a run for its money. I floured the bejeezus out of a towel to do the final proof, but the wet dough absorbed the flour and glued itself to the towel. I used an oiled bowl for the final proof, but the oil kind of burned in the oven. \n\n* I'm not getting any oven spring. The dough goes in and comes out at roughly the same size. I'm not sure if this is related to the dough being a soggy mess, or if I need to preheat my dutch oven longer.\n\n* The bread comes out too dense and a little doughy seeming.\n\nPossible causes / difference:\n\n* The bread dough is somewhere between 80 and 100% hydration. It's ~382g water and 360g flour if the flour density [here](http://www.cuisinivity.com/guide/measurement.php) is to be believed, or 450g flour if the serious eats no knead recipe [here](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/06/better-no-knead-bread-recipe.html) is to be believed (don't have a food scale at the moment). The food lab recipe is 70% hydration, a bit lower and maybe less sticky? This could also help with the density and doughiness maybe?\n\n* The food lab recipe more than doubles the amount of yeast. Maybe this will help create more gas and get more oven spring?\n\n* I'll try to let the dutch oven heat for an hour like the food lab recipe says. I'm currently heating it for a half hour and it is blazing hot, but maybe not all the way through.\n\nAny other ideas? ",

It got only about 8 hours of rise. It turned out great! The crust was firm, crispy, held up well, and flavorful. I even posted about it here about how foolproof the recipe actually was!\n\nSecond try, I used bread flour, but still was using active dry yeast (still didn't realize). Still tasted pretty good like good grain, got a little bit more rise time, but for the end result the crust underneath the pizza was not holding up. \n\nThird try I had the right flour, the right yeast (finally), and the full 24 hr + 2 rise time. I thought it'd be the best! It tasted overwhelmingly yeasty and while the outer edge of crust was full, flaky, and crispy, the inner part of the pizza did not hold up in any way. It did not crisp at all even with a brief time on the stove burner and almost seemed saturated with fluid and dissolved. I also expected the dough to have a really high volume but it shrunk down to nothing and I only got one pizza out of it instead of two.\n\nAll three times, I used the same kind of dry mozzarella cheese and sauce. All three times, the dough did not rise as much as described in the recipe, though was biggest on the last try.\n\nSo...any ideas? What am I missing here? Did my third try become overproofed? Was my original totally-wrong pizza dough just a different beast and I don't like the actual intended results? ",

Pineapples always had a rather high inedible:edible ratio so this technique seemed perfect. \n\nTo make it, just cut the tops and bottoms off and discard. Then, skin and core the pineapple and cut the skin and core into 1/2 inch pieces. Toss with 1/2 lb of sugar and keep tossing every hour or so until all the sugar is dissolved, then strain through a sieve.\n\nWhat you get as a result is this amazingly tasty pineapple syrup. It's got all of the aromatic, floral notes of pineapple with none of the acidity of pineapple juice and it adds a really great pineapple aroma to any drink you mix with it. I'm excited to play around with it some more, especially in the context of cocktails. \n\nIf you get any fresh pineapples, definitely try making this syrup!",

I did batches with and without pulling them apart for rough edges and they turned out exactly the same. What happened?!",
