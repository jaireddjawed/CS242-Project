It was extremely realistic, not a thing was out of place. There were a couple beings (I didn't have a good view of their faces, so I'm assuming they were just normal dudes) sitting around a cauldron, stirring, as another one begins pouring something in. Then one says, \"Oh, we're just mixing you up another dream, go back to sleep.\"\n\nIt was one of the strangest experiences ever. It truly felt as if I had woken up and caught them, but I was so tired I just went back to sleep as directed.",

        "text": "So this happened 3 years ago when I was in my first year of college. \n\nIt was during the final exams time for that semester and since my college is insane they packed all of the exams one after another. \n\nBut the three most difficult and most demanding exams were packed in one day. Somewhere in the middle of the January. \n\nI was working for those exams for 50h straight without sleep. Not a bit. \nThe most insane thing I did in my life. But these 3 exams are considered like a bottleneck of my university of Architecture. If you cant survive the first semester then you are better off dropping out. It gets easier in the following years. \n\nAnyway after I was done there with defending my projects and leaving them for a review I went home and stopped by a local cooked food shop. \n\nThere I was waiting for the food to be prepared for me to take it home and eat. \nAnd while I was waiting I started drifting away.. I had a feeling that I am fucked because the tiredness started kicking in fast and I could barely hold myself in check.\n\n30 minutes later I arrived at home and ate the cooked peas with chicken in about 10minutes and I fell asleep at the floor beside a running electrical heater. \n\nThats when it happened. \n\nIn some middle wake sleep I started panicking because a thought emerged somehow that this is it. It was like, this is it. You had your time here and now its up. \n\nThought was something a long the lines of:\n\"You are about to wake up in the real reality because all of this, all.of your life was just a dream\". Or something like that. \n\nThe panic I felt was unbelievable and while I was waking up I had tried with whole of my being not to let myself go to wherever it felt that I would go. \n\nThat single moment when I was waking up from that terrible thought lasted for what it seemed like 10minutes. \n\nMy brain was fighting between not waking up from this reality and doing so. Or at least thats how it felt like. \n\nI could barely breathe and I was sweating a lot. \n\nThere are hardly words to describe what I felt because what I wrote can't really give you a 100% insight in what was going on in my head at those moments but you get the picture. \n\nIts safe to say that I will never stay awake for such a long period of time ever again. \n\nI couldn't sleep anymore after that so I stayed awake untill the evening when I fell asleep and slept for the next 15h with normal dreams and etc. ",

I'll just be sitting there and I'll suddenly realise this moment seems familiar, then I realise this moment has felt familiar before. Before I know it, I'm going through a little meta moment, and I get distracted by how weird but cool this is, and I'll forget what I was doing.

One day I was chilling in the family room and I had a bunch of crystals/stones in my hand (rose quartz, smoky quartz, and the red carnelian pebble). I was standing up to study them in my hand and two of the crystals fell (I think it was the rose quartz and definitely the tiny red carnelian). My eyes followed the red carnelian pebble to the floor and out of some magic movie, the damn thing was no where to be found. Like I *saw* it fall with my own two eyes as it bounced on to the floor one time and, ***poof***, it was gone! I checked ***everywhere*** twice just to make sure. Mind you this happened sometime in March of this year and from time to time I'll check again in the room just to make sure I'm not crazy. What the hell is this pebbles deal???? Did it fall into a portal I don't know about (half-joking)???? Can anyone offer me some insight to what they think happened???? Thanks in advance!!!",

        "text": "About a year ago I was google researching cool abandoned places to explore in the area I lived in. It’s pretty rural where I live so I was surprised and very interested when I came across an abandoned hospital that was in the next county over. I spent a couple of hours reading about it, it’s supposed hauntings, looking at pictures, and watching videos of people exploring it. This hospital was a lot different than what a normal hospital looks like, it was only one story and was basically a giant rectangle, it was really long but not super wide, I found it weird because I’d never seen hospitals constructed like that. I really wanted to go but couldn’t find anybody willing to go with me and I’m too chicken to go by myself so I saved a link to my notes about it and pretty much forgot about it until I met somebody who said they’d be down to explore it. \n\nSo the next chance I got I went to the link I’d saved on my phone where I’d first seen it mentioned, but I couldn’t find it. That in itself wasn’t super strange because it hadn’t been mentioned in the article but in the comment section. I figured the comment chain had been deleted or maybe I’d saved the wrong link. I remembered that it had a rather distinctive name (first name, initial, last name, HOSPITAL) and I remembered the county that it had been in so I googled abandoned hospital in anywhere USA and pretty quickly found a hospital that had the right name, I looked at the google images and confirmed that it was the same place I’d been thinking of, the only problem was that it was no longer abandoned. I figured that maybe I was mistaken and spent several more hours trying to find any other hospital but I kept on getting led back to the first hospital, I couldn’t find any of the abandoned pictures and videos that I’d watched a year before. \n\nI figured that maybe it had been reopened in the past year so I called the hospital to ask for details and was eventually transferred to the building historian (or something like that) and she told me that to her knowledge this hospital had been in operation since it was built. Now this is where it really gets weird, I asked the historian if she knew of any other abandoned hospitals in the area that I might be getting confused with and she told me that she knew of none, but that she had received a few calls from people asking the same exact thing as me over the past several months. \n\nI’ve spent probably around ten hours searching the internet for the hospital I’d originally seen and can find no trace of it, I’ve also asked the friends who I’d tried and failed to convince to go explore it with me and most of them remembered me talking to them about it. At this point I really have no idea what to think about this whole thing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr: about a year ago I spent hours researching an abandoned hospital that I wanted to go explore but never was able to. A few months ago somebody wanted to go and when I went back to research it so I could plan a trip I found the hospital easily enough, but it’s apparently never been abandoned. I couldn’t find any of the websites/pictures/videos talking about it and exploring it. I called the hospital and was transferred to some kind of building historian who told me that it had never been abandoned and that she knew of no other abandoned hospitals in the area, she then told me that there had been a couple of other callers asking the same thing",

        "text": "Not sure if this is a proper glitch but it's bugged me ever since it happened. \n\nA while back, freshman year of college, me and my friends were out walking around campus one night. Just for the picture of it, the school is kind of tucked away in some woods in West Virginia with a river running right next to it. Only about 3500 students.  There is a pretty decent sized bridge built across it run with street lights on each side, and it happened that the light we were standing next to was out. \n\nAnyway, we were walking across the bridge when I stopped and happened to look over the edge and into the dark river below. Off in the distance I saw a very bright light, probably half a mile down the river, pointed right at us. It almost looked like a boat traveling on the water with the light in the front. I looked away to say something to a friend, and when I looked back not 3 seconds later it vanished. Almost as soon as it went out, the street light that was out next to us came on. \n\nI know it seems like a coincidence but ever since then, when I drive or walk past street lights that are out, they turn on almost immediately as I pass them, every time. I decided to film it once with a light that I passed everyday, and it didn't want to cooperate. As soon as I shut the camera off it came on.\n\nI don't know how to explain it. It has happened too many times for it to be a coincidence. I thought it could have been some kind of supernatural thing, but looking through this sub, I think it could have been a glitch. ",

        "text": "So, this is a story that still trips the fuck out of my mom, dad, and me (or at least it did with my dad until he died...). To sum it up, we literally saw a McDonald's vanish in the blink of an eye as we were driving to it. There's no other way to put it. This happened years ago after my parents were done filing their taxes. In front of the tax place there was a McDonald's very directly in front in the same parking lot. We had agreed upon dining there, so we got into our car and we were driving towards it. As we were driving to it, it literally... teleported. Vanished. I don't know how to put it. My mom started getting really scared, and we pulled up to the parking lot where it should have been. It was gone. My dad was in incredible disbelief, attempting to rationalize what had just happened, and we decided to search everywhere all up and down the street for it. Nothing. My dad even brought up a question. What the hell happened to the people inside? And yes, it literally vanished in front of my eyes. It was an incredibly weird experience. Nothing even close has ever happened since then. \n\nSo to put me and my family's thoughts at rest, what the hell actually happened that day? Was it really a \"glitch\", or were we just collectively hallucinating the mcdonalds? And no, we weren't on drugs!\n\nEdit: typo",

        "text": "So this happened to me quite a few years ago but it’s been on my mind ever since as the strangest thing ever. I lived in a very small apartment with my then boyfriend, now husband. Neither of us was the tidiest of people so it wasn’t unusual for the floors to be strewn with whatever. One morning, in a hurry to get to work, I’m looking for my hairbrush. That hairbrush had a plastic, bright red, and I mean bright red back. I look everywhere, which doesn’t take that long in a small space. Nope, can’t find it. Over the next couple of days, we both look for it in all the places I might not have looked for it to start with, places that would be just a crazy place to put a hairbrush. Nothing. By then, we are accepting that the hairbrush is definitely not in the apartment. Has it perhaps fallen in the bin from the countertop? Has a friend who’s stayed over taken it by mistake? It’s gone, that’s all we’re sure of.  Then one day, as I come back from work, I open the front door and there, in plain view, on the floor of the living room, is the bright red hairbrush. Not only was it impossible to miss, but there’s no way that brush had been there the whole time, we’d have walked on it even if we’d gone blind. I remember my blood turning cold, but then thought my husband had found it and put it well in evidence somewhere I couldn’t possibly miss it as some sort of a joke, or to make sure I knew it’d been found so I wouldn’t keep looking. He swore (blind, haha) that he hadn’t found it. ",

She started flicking through them and I remember seeing her eyes widen before she started telling me this story.\n\nWhen she was younger (I think 21-23) she had a dream of a little boy playing around in a very small back garden, he had blond curly hair, a slightly upturned nose, and had two moles on his cheek. When she woke up she immediately started drawing what she could remember. Now admittedly I don't have blond curly hair. But she showed me the picture alongside a picture of me when I was around 3 or 4. The hair was different, but the face was almost identical, and I got almost all my looks from my dad, who she didn't meet until 5 years after the drawing.\n\nThe parts that were spot on however, my nose is slightly upturned, and although my face is covered in freckles, I have/had two very distinct freckles, larger than the rest on my left cheek, in the exact places she drew them. Just to add to this, the garden she dreamt of was also the back garden of the house we had moved into when I was 4 years old, a full 10 years after the drawing, putting me at the same age as the boy playing in the same garden.\n\nThe only part off was the hair, however my older brother (who looks nothing like the drawing or me, and has a different dad) is blond.",

It only dawned on me when my shift was over, and I thought, \"Why did I see her two times in my direction when she was initially sitting facing the cafe entrance?\" \n\n\n2. The neck tattoo.\n\nWhen my shift ended, I took my usual train southbound to my bedroom community. On the train ride, a girl sat in front of me with blonde hair tied up in a bun. I was looking at her hair roots pulled up from the back of her neck that were revealing some brown, and I figured well, blonde isn't her natural color. I took my view away to switch some songs on my phone. When I looked back up, there was a tattoo on her neck. I would have sworn to have seen it as it was a bare neck before and now there was a quote from The Bell Jar. \"I am, I am, I am.\" \n\nBoth of these glitches happened last Saturday. ",

It's a Private Caller. My Mom picks up the phone and says, \"Hello?\" and hears a little giggle, followed by a little girl asking \"Is your refrigerator running?\" Mom says \"no, is yours?\" but the little girl just sticks to the original \"Then you better go catch it!\" line, giggles, and hangs up.\n\nWe're all pretty confused at the insane coincidence, as we've never had a prank call here as long as anyone can recall.",

Everyone in my house was asleep, it was pitch black inside my house with no interior lights on other than my computer that I usually leave on. I walked through the house to put my phone on charge and was about to get into bed. I saw that my daughter was asleep in her cot in her room, as I walked past it to enter mine. I saw my wife asleep on the bed, her phone was charging on my usual phone charger so I walked around the bed to use the other one. I plugged my phone in and placed it down on the nightstand/bed-side table. Then the strangest thing happened I don't remember walking out of the room but there I was standing next to my wife at the computer desk with my daughter still awake, all the lights were on and it was only 7pm. I closed my eyes and all I could see was black with a backwards number 4. Which makes sense to tie in that I gained 4 hours of time. (reverse 4, reverse 4 hours) I was so shocked by this I started shaking and my wife thinks I'm crazy. I know this happened to me. I hope someone here can relate to my experience and help me try and understand what happened.\n\nSorry this isn't a long story to tell I just felt that I need to tell someone and try and find some answers... \n\nThanks\n\n- TBLC",

        "text": "I'm a very vivid and lucid dreamer in general, and I have the apparently odd ability to remember dreams without aid or writing them down. They just stay. I've dreamed of buildings and places I've never been to and then visited them in real life later on plenty of times, but this is the only occurance of interacting with and then meeting a real person I've ever had. \n\nMy very first relationship began in high school with a boy I had known for years. Let's call him Jay. He was sweet enough, but somewhere around our junior year, when our relationship matured, he became very aggressive and early stages of serious abuse started rearing their heads. \n\nNear the end of our relationship, and senior year of school, I had a strange dream. What stood out was the color, everything was in a yellow haze. I somehow knew it was evening and I was in a home I had never been to. (It was not Jay's house.)\n\n I rounded the corner of a separating wall from the living room to the kitchen of the house and a guy was standing there. I felt warm and joyful and love towards him so strong that I didn't hesitate to run up and hug him. In the dream I placed my hands on his shoulders and said, \"Jay, why are you so tall?\" The dream figure was a solid head taller than me while Jay in reality was only an inch taller than me. I then took note of his long, curly, dark hair and realized something was wrong. I said, \"Why is your hair so long?\" Jay's was a simple short swooped cut. Just as dream self realized it wasn't Jay, the figure laughed warmly and I awoke feeling calm. \n\nPerhaps it sounds like a scary dream, and writing it now it DOES sound spooky. But all I know is I felt a strange relief that I hadn't experienced in the years with Jay. Not a month or so later I was at church when a new family began attending. They had two daughter and two sons, the eldest of which was a tall guy about my age with the curly dark hair that came down to his shoulders. I felt an immediate attachment to him despite not having realized it was him yet. \n\nA few months passed within which Jay and I broke up and \"Mack\" and I started dating. The first time I visited his family in their home I had to hold back the shock, as soon as I saw their kitchen I knew it was the same from the dream and I realized it WAS Mack who I had hugged and made laugh. When I told him about the dream later on, he admitted a strange bit of information too. One of the first guitars he was ever given he named \"Laura\"... my name.\n\nAs an added bonus I found a Mayfield Dairy key chain in high school and kept it on my purse because I thought it was funny. And it was was his father receiving a job with Mayfield Dairy that had moved their family to where we are now.",

        "text": "So this happened around 10 years \\- me and my graduating university class of \\(mostly\\) neckbeard electro. engineers went on an unlikely Cancun spring break trip yearning for the legendary \"girls gone wild\" atmosphere from our collective teen conscience \\(in case you're wondering, yes, expectations were surprisingly met here and there\\). As I mentioned, destination Cancun was unlikely since we are from Portugal and graduation trips are usually to the south of Spain where you get the dubious privilege of experiencing British middle\\-aged men gone wild instead. However, since we made some extra money on the side from selling hard liquor and shots in student parties, we managed to make it to more exotic pastures.\n\nTo the point of the story, however \\- most of our time in Cancun was spent strolling around the beach half\\-drunk, half\\-nauseated on watered\\-down/almost radioactive Margaritas, chatting up and taking pictures with some sweet random spring break chicks \\- in short, materializing our internet\\-warped teen dreams and ambitions. After 1 week of this, we pack our stuff, get on the plane back home and call it a mild success given our initial odds as out of the loop Europeans.\n\nFast forward 4 months the same year, I get a Couchsurfing request from two Canadian girls. For whoever doesn't know Couchsurfing, think a backpacker\\-oriented, I\\-just\\-need\\-a\\-roof\\-and\\-maybe\\-a\\-couch\\-please\\-but\\-maybe\\-we\\-should\\-also\\-hang\\-out AirBnB for free. They stayed for one week at my place and it was an absolute riot, they were great chicks, we got a long really well, and we ended up staying in touch as good friends.\n\nAgain, a couple of months later, I'm reminiscing with a friend about our trip to Cancun and going through the pictures when suddenly, going through one particular picture, my brain forks into an alternate reality: one of my new girl friends had actually been a random spring break chick posing with my half\\-drunk friend at some point. That blew me away and in hindsight feels like a glitch in the simulation. Seriously, what are the odds?\n\nOh yeah, Inb4 cynics claim she stalked me for 10.000 km \\- that's impossible, I'm pretty sure I'm not worth a 100 meter stalk.\n\nAlso, I got the pics with her in Cancun and Lisbon. Not posting because I haven't bothered asking her for permission \\(yet\\). I doubt it, but if this somehow gets attention, I might asked her.",

        "text": "I used to, like many children, get up early on Sunday mornings and watch children's television. Recently, I had a flash of nostalgia and wanted to look up the intros all my favourite shows from the early 90's so I searched for them in YouTube.\n\nI found The Fruities, The Biskitts, A Pup Named Scooby Doo to name just a few but there's one I can't find any trace of. It was called 'The Cockadoos' and it was an American/Canadian cartoon about a cockerel who lived in a hen shed on a farm with his family \\(The Cockadoos\\) and would spend every episode trying to be famous. I asked my mum if she remembers this and she said yes but it was a bit naughty for a children's TV show because they used to say, \"clucking heck!\" and \"cluck you!\" My sister even recalls one scene where the mother \\(who always wore a yellow, frilly apron\\) put a frying pan on the floor and sat on it. You just saw her cartoon face staining and then there was a crack sound. She put the pan on the cooker which now had a cracked open egg in it and said, \"Kids, breakfast is almost ready.\"\n\nI presumed it must have been taken off air as my sister said it only aired about three or four mornings then we couldn't find it anymore when we scrolled through the channels.\n\nHowever, me and my sister both remembered the catchy theme song and began singing it together. Then we remembered something else really strange. The main character \\- whose name I can't remember \\- was, on one particular episode, trying to make himself famous and was doing different wacky things to become a celebrity on the net, which seemed kind of strange as children of the early 90s wouldn't have been able to relate to jokes about the internet.\n\nHowever the craziest thing is this: In one scene I remember in detail that the main character recorded himself and some of the other animals catapulting themselves into the air in crash helmets. The cow \\(who I think was called Bella or Bulla\\) then uploaded it onto the computer to a site called 'MooTube' which was continually referenced throughout the episode.\n\nI said that at the time we must have been too young to realise this was a play on the word YouTube but while I was saying this, my sister just interrupted me and said, \"YouTube didn't exist back then.\" I thought she was denying my memory at first but she said that she remembers it too but that it was impossible. I even recall that every time they checked to see how many \"hits\" they had, a big picture would appear on their computer screen of a red rectangle with a white hoof print inside \\- obviously a reference to the YouTube red and white play icon.\n\nShe told me that YouTube wasn't invented until the early 2000s. I denied this saying it must have been because they wouldn't have referenced it otherwise, but we investigated further and discovered that YouTube was actually invented in 2005, about ten years after we remembered seeing this show.\n\nI speculated whether we were older and were mixing it up with a similar show but my sister, who would have been 10 or 11 at the time \\(I was 6 or 7\\) was sure it was at our first house which we left when I was 7. To be honest, I only remember watching it in that house too so it had to be 1994 to 1996 \\('93 at a push but I don't think I'd have been that young\\).\n\nConfused as hell, we began trying to hunt down this show. We searched everywhere and even tried emailing the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 because we couldn't recall which network it was from \\- we only had the five main channels back then. We haven't heard back from any of them yet, but it was only about a week ago so we'll wait and see. My sister reckons they won't know what we're talking about, but I think surely it must be in their archives. Can a show just disappear without any record?\n\nLiterally there's no trace of this show on the internet. No one knows what we're talking about. No one we know outside our household even vaguely remembers it. My sister said to me last night that given the MooTube reference, maybe it hasn't been invented yet and we were watching something from the future. I laughed at first. We both did. But now I'm wondering. I don't ever remember it being announced by presenters or featured in the 'up next' line up. We just used to flick through until we found it. What if there was a signal to the future to our old, boxy Panasonic. Honestly, I'm freaked out and I have chills now whenever I think about it.\n\nIf you know the show I'm talking about it's called The Cockadoo's. The animation was a lot like Two Stupid Dogs  but a bit more ropey and exaggerated. It was a chicken, his mum, dad, sister \\(a chick\\), and grandmother and friends on the farm \\(a pig, cow and possibly some others\\).\n\nPlease let me know so I can investigate further and maybe put it to bed.",
