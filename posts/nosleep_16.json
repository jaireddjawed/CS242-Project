How are you supposed to stare down your own impending doom? There is no blueprint for how you could or should react, no answer for how you should live the life remaining. When I awoke the next morning, I was determined to finally return to the motel office. If I truly had been marked for death, I needed to take Martina’s advice and toughen up. No more living in fear.  \n\nIt was hard to be in there; I’m not going to lie. All around me, it felt as though Martina would walk through the door any minute, coming back in from a cigarette break. Each blue pen, each piece of yellowed paper, the tobacco-scented rolodex, each was a tactile reminder of my friend and mentor. I needed to move forward, I needed to turn back the tide against the malignancy rising in the entities of this property. Even if the ending had already been revealed to me. Just because I would die, does not mean that I would fail.\n\nMartina had been very careful not to leave any other indication of the property’s “unique” qualities beyond the terse notebook I had already been consulting. The desk drawers were filled with manila folders of receipts from nearly every purchase for the last fifty years. *Who will sit here when I’m gone?* I pushed the thought out of my mind.\n\nSomeone had pressed the doorbell to the motel reception area. I sighed. \n\n“We’re closed!” I shouted as I emerged from the office. The was a woman at the door, eyes red-rimmed, clearly very upset. “I’m sorry, ma’am, we’re closed for renovations.”\n\n“Wait, please!” She thrust a gloved hand into the crack of the door and pried it open further. “I’m so sorry to bother you. I just need some help. Do you mind if I come in?” I let her pass. She seemed to breathe easier indoors. With a shaking hand, she unfolded a few sheets of paper from her jacket pocket.\n\n“I’m looking for my husband. He was camping with his friends at the campground down the street a few days ago and no one has seen them since. Their campsite was in disarray, police think they had a fight.”\n\n“I assume you filed a missing person’s report.”\n\n“Of course! Police don’t seem too bothered though. What kind of wife would I be if I wasn’t out here handing out fliers?”\n\n“I’m really sorry to hear that.  I’ll definitely take one.”\n\nShe handed me a piece of flimsy paper with a man’s picture printed on the front in black and white. He was probably in his late 30s, smiling with his arm around a person who had been cropped out of the photo. At the bottom, the woman had typed: \n\n*Aaron Quinn, Age: 38, height: 6’1, weight: 200lbs*\n\n*Last seen wearing jeans, sweatshirt, and green LL Bean coat*\n\nMy face flushed and I felt the bile race into my throat. \n\n“Any other defining characteristics?” I said, trying to hide my alarm.\n\n“Mole on his right arm. Oh, and he would have his initials written in black marker on the tags of all his clothing. In case you find him and…he can’t…” She trailed off, distressed by the thought her husband would need to be identified rather than spoken with.\n\n“It’s okay. I’ll keep my eyes open, for sure. Good luck.” I gently guided her out of my motel.  My head was spinning. I reassured myself that the coat was just a coincidence. *Popular brand, popular color*, I repeated like a lame mantra. I decided to refocus myself on organizing the desk drawers.\n\nIn the deepest drawer, underneath decades worth of Martina’s meticulously-kept receipts, I found a small, composition book with a faded blue cloth cover, considerably older than anything else. On the inside was the name of my great-grandfather, John Calnon, written with a beautiful hand. Underneath was written the year 1923*.* Inside was a journal of sorts, not too detailed, just a few thoughts he must have jotted down here and there, reminders about chores and other mundane things. A line stood out to me.\n\n*Met with Allaire again today.* *He showed Ellen and I some options for the gable trim.* *Ellen seemed very taken with the ideas.* *We’ll have to see about the cost.* \n\nI turned the page to find the back of a photograph with the inscription “John, Ellen and René, May 1923.” I flipped it over and tears began to fall down my cheeks. \n\nI calmly closed the book, opened the gun safe, and sat waiting for sunset.\n\n\\++\n\nHis car pulled in after dark. I waived to him from the reception area, gesturing for him to come inside the motel. He smiled and it took a considerable effort for me to hide my anguish.\n\n“How are you holding up?” he asked.\n\n“I’ve been better,” I said, truthfully. “I thought we could chat in the office. I also found some old things that might interest you.”\n\n“Sounds good.”\n\n“Here, let me take your coat.” \n\nHe chuckled and took it off, handing it to me.\n\n“Nice service,” he joked. I laughed woodenly. \n\nAs I followed him inside the office, I took a glance down at the coat tag. As I had dreaded but expected, in neat black marker were the initials “A.Q.” Stifling the urge to vomit, I sat across from him behind the desk, in Martina’s maroon swivel chair. I draped the coat over the desk and with a subtle tap confirmed the loaded gun was resting next to my leg. \n\n“I had the most interesting visitor today, René.”\n\n“Oh yeah?”\n\n“Her name was Quinn. Didn’t catch her first name, but she was looking for her husband, Aaron. Does that ring a bell?”\n\nHis expression didn’t change. He raised his eyebrows and shook his head.\n\n“He was last seen at the campground down the street. In fact, the other guys he was with are missing too. Happened the same night that Martina died. You see, I have a hypothesis.  The thing that killed Martina, also got to these unfortunate men. And Mrs. Quinn also told me another interesting fact. She said that each item of clothing her husband wore that night was monogramed in black marker.” I picked up the coat on the desk and flipped the tag out for him to see. \n\nInitially, his face was blank, absorbing this information passively. Then, he stood and picked up the coat and a look of great sorrow crossed his face. He traced the marker with his finger and nodded, dejectedly.\n\n“Yes,” he said quietly. “This belonged to him.”\n\n“And how did you happen to …acquire his coat,” I spat, trying to control the rage welling inside of me.\n\n“Nora.”\n\n“I have something else I found that would interest you.” I threw the photograph I had found in my great-grandfather’s journal. He caught it with frightening ease. \n\n“Ellen and John,” he whispered sadly.\n\n“And who else? Who else? Shut up and tell me the truth, damnit!” I cried, picking up the gun and aiming it at him. He sighed and placed the photograph gently down at the corner of the desk. Though his hair and clothing were different, the man with my great-grandparents was unmistakably the same who stood before me.\n\n“You are right. I have not been entirely truthful. I never received a call from your Martina. I was imprisoned in Cottage 7 for nearly a century before something stirred me. The next thing I knew I was lying on the ground of the camp site, naked but whole, the bodies of these men scattered beside me. I know what I have done, but I—”\n\nI pulled the trigger. He flew back against the wall, a hole blown through his chest. He slumped to the floor. I lowered the gun to the ground, hands shaking, tears streaming down my face. I went around the front of the desk to find him gasping, blood pouring out of his mouth. His face had subtly changed, his eyes seemed brighter, and in his mouth, his canines had elongated into fangs. But that was not all.\n\nThe gaping wound had begun to heal, knitting itself together with alarming speed. He groaned and rolled on to his back, lifting himself into a seated position. His outstretched hand reached the thermos attached to his backpack and he took a long, long draught, the contents spilling down the side of his mouth in one neat rivulet. When he had finished, the wound had completely ceased to exist.\n\nHe stood and faced me and I was surprised he didn’t seem angry at all. Just mildly annoyed. I know I should have run away, but I didn’t. Maybe being marked for death has made me a bit too reckless.\n\n“You deserved that,” I said.\n\n“That and worse,” he said.\n\n“What are you?”\n\n“I’m sure you have a guess.”\n\n“There’s *blood* in that fucking thermos, isn’t there.”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nI didn’t know what to say. My anger had somewhat ebbed, but I was still deeply wounded. I needed to understand. I gestured to the chair.\n\n“Explain yourself.”\n\n“It’s a very long story.”\n\n“We have all night.”\n\n“Very well.”\n\nI settled into Martina’s chair. He sat across from me, fangs receded, the bloody hole in his shirt and the blood on his face the only evidence of his true nature. \n\n“I want you to comprehend what happened that terrible night, so I will begin there, though this story stretches back long before then. As I said before, I was imprisoned underneath the floorboards of Cottage 7.”\n\n“Sounds like for good reason.”\n\nHe scowled. “Undoubtedly the only subject on which you and my jailer would agree.”\n\n“How can someone imprison a … a…vampire.” The word sounded unspeakably stupid, but I knew no other.\n\n“If we are weakened, deprived of blood, we can be entombed for centuries, our bodies desiccating. In my case, I was punished for daring to oppose the wicked thing that the spirits here call the Mistress. But more on her later. \n\nAt first, I suffered immensely. Imagine being buried alive, but never actually succumbing to death. Eventually my consciousness drifted away into some suspended state, but I am not sure. I am still trying to process it. On that night, I suddenly felt myself hurtling through a darkened tunnel, as though something had summoned me to re-enter the world. I heard noises, words, but I didn’t understand. I was still in the tunnel, you see. Whatever my body had done was animated not by my consciousness, but by the dark force that makes us what we are. \n\nAs I said before, when I first opened my eyes, I was in that campground. That was the first time I was back in control of my body. I opened and closed my hands in wonder. Then I saw the carnage I had wrought in that wretched, animalistic state. I took what I needed from the bodies and buried them. I wandered the next few days, learning, absorbing, trying to comprehend a very different world. A name echoed in my mind, *Martina*. I felt that she was associated with the cottages somehow. On the night you found me, I had returned to understand what had happened. There was a light on in Cottage 7, so I went to investigate. That much was true.”\n\n“And yet everything else was a lie,” I said bitterly.\n\n“No!” he said shaking his head, voice raised. “No. Not all. In life, I was a carpenter and master woodworker. After I had been made into… this” he gestured disgustedly at his body. “I would still practice my craft. It was my only joy. After a long time, I met Ellen and John, your great-grandparents. They wanted to build this place, but to be honest, they had no idea what they were doing.  I did it for them.”\n\n“You? You built the cottages?”\n\n“I did. At first, they thought it odd that I only came at night, but my work was quick and of high-quality. The benefit of having centuries of experience.”\n\n“And I supposed you were ‘flexible’ in your pricing.”\n\n“I don’t really need money.” He smiled wanly.\n\n“Did you figure it out?”\n\n“Figure what out?”\n\n“Why on that night, of all nights in the past century did you wake up? Was it because of what we did? We pulled up the floorboards.”\n\n“I am not sure. It was as though something snapped its fingers and tore me back into existence. For good or for ill, I do not know. But, Nora, I promise you, I did not mean to hurt your Martina. When you told me she had died, I knew in that moment that I had been responsible. I am horrified.”\n\n“Were you ever going to tell me?” I asked, quietly.\n\n“Eventually. Yes. What was I supposed to do? Show up and introduce myself as the undead monster beneath your floors?”\n\nI shook my head.\n\n“Listen, I know that things…can’t be the same between us,” he said softly. “Though it pains me greatly to admit it. But I know what is playing with you here. My old enemy. I can help you. I can be your ally. You don’t have to be alone in this.”\n\nAt those words, my head shot up and I remembered the spirits in the flames. *Ne te laisse pas seule…* My mind was still reeling from his revelations. I should hate him for what he did to Martina. But I couldn’t. How could I blame him for reacting out of brute instinct? I wasn’t sure. Martina wasn’t the kind of person to hold grudges. Just then the lights flickered in the office. René and I looked around, but there was no indication that anything had touched the switch.\n\nI noticed on the desk, at least a foot away from where he had put it down, was the photograph of John, Ellen, and René, centered right before me. They were smiling together in front of a recently completed cottage, arms around each other in friendship. *Did you do this, Martina?* \n\n“You’re right,” I said quietly. “I don’t want to be alone.”\n\n“Then I will lay bare to you the story of my past. Not to garner your pity, but for you to understand what you are dealing with. Shall we walk outside? I need to uhhh…” He shook his empty thermos. “I have more in my truck.”\n\n“Fine.” I cringed.\n\nWe exited the motel and he began to rummage through the glove compartment.\n\n“Where are you getting the blood? Or do I not want to know?”\n\n“In the past century, you humans have gotten adept at blood transfusions. Easy takings from the local hospital.”\n\n“So no killing necessary?”\n\nHe chuckled.\n\n“Well, I wouldn’t go *that* far. But do not fear. There are plenty of vile individuals that the world would do better without.”\n\nHe emerged with a full thermos, ready to talk. The night was clear and almost unseasonably warm. He drank from the thermos and I noticed a subtle shift in the color of his face, a soft pink rose to his cheeks. He appeared more…alive. I shuddered.  We stopped at the bench and he sat. With a sigh I sat beside him.\n\n“Back here again?” I asked coldly.\n\n“I remember when John surprised Ellen with this bench.” He was smiling. “They were good people, your great-grandparents. Kind, honest folk. Friends to all. Even the likes of me.”\n\n“I’m tolerating you for their sake.”\n\n“Good,” he grinned. “I am grateful for that.”\n\n“Can you get on with this story you’ve been promising me?”\n\n“Yes.” He turned to me, jaw clenched, as though preparing himself for something unpleasant. \n\n“I first met the Witch nearly three hundred years ago.”\n\n[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wine_Dark_Sea_1239/)",

        "text": "Humans are scared of paranormal activities, not because they happen at night or we are alone (which is usually the case), but because some things cannot be explained, even by the wittiest of minds. Although people think these happen at certain places at certain times, my experience will make you rethink about such sayings. I think, it doesn't matter where you are, or at what time you are there, some things are bound to happen. This is famously called Murphy's law.\n\nWithout further ado, I will go forth with my narrative. So, it was a winter dawn and three of my college friends Dinesh, Raj and Vipul had agreed to go to Dinesh's native place in Konkan (it is a coastal region which spans across the western coast of Maharashtra and Goa). I do not remember the exact location of the village, but it is somewhere near Chiplun. This was almost a decade ago, so Chiplun itself was a very remote location.\n\nSo, as I was saying, it was quite chilly at dawn and as the sea was relatively calm, we had decided to go fishing. Since we four had almost no experience, Dinesh's uncle Janardhan decided to accompany us. Now, there were us five, going for a fishing expedition.\n\nThe beach was just a few metres behind Dinesh's property, so they used to keep the boat in their yard itself. Uncle prepped the fishing nets, the buckets and what was left for us was to drag the boat towards the shore.\n\nWe tied two ropes to the stern and pulled the boat towards the water. The sun wasn't still up but we could discern water from land. Finally, we were in the water headed for the deep blue. The land kept getting smaller and smaller and eventually, the only thing except for the sea which we could see was a distant lighthouse. \n\nUncle cut the engines and anchored the boat to the sea bed and gently entered the water with his scuba equipment. He had a long rope, one end bound around his chest while the other end in the boat with us. He had told us to keep tugging each minute. After this, he went underwater to set up the fishing nets.\n\nNow, the sun was behind our backs, the water glistening under its light. A minute passed and we gave our first tug. Uncle tugged back. \n\nWe kept repeating this ritual for sometime. Since we could see the buoys of the fishing net floating above the water, we stopped tugging, partly because of reassurance and partly due to boredom.\n\nBut, an hour passed by and uncle had still not returned. So, I tugged. No response from uncle. I tugged thrice, still no response. We looked at each other and decided to pull uncle out of the water.\n\nWhat followed was spine-chilling. Uncle was not there, but there was still a knot at the end of the rope!!! So, I decided to dive and inspect, but to no avail.\n\nIf we returned home like this, I didn't know what the elders would infer from this. So we searched the surrounding waters. But realising our limited maritime experience, we thought wise to return ashore. On the way, we informed the coast guard about the incident.\n\nWe were on the beach, dragging the boat towards Dinesh's yard when Dinesh stood dead in his own tracks.\n\n\"What happened?\", I asked.\n\nWithout answering my question, he dashed towards the lighthouse and ascended the stairs. At the top was uncle, crawled into a ball, dry as a bone and staring perplexed at us. He had caught a very high fever.\n\nEventually, uncle recovered but scores of questions raced my mind like: \"How did he disappear?\", \"How did he end up dry, in a lighthouse miles away from the fishing spot?\", etc.\n\nAt midnight when everyone was asleep, we asked Dinesh why he hurried off towards the lighthouse. He told us, \"A few years back when we were in college, uncle's father (Dinesh's grandfather) died during fishing   the same spot where uncle had disappeared and when uncle used to return from fishing, as he used to haul the boat up the beach, he always heard grandfather luring him towards the lighthouse.\" \n\nI still try to get a grip to the logic behind this incident. I would like to know about some theories since Dinesh's relatives refrain from taking up this topic ever again.",

        "text": "I’m a trained counselor who has helped countless drug addicts and alcoholics come back from the brink of death. I believe fully in Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous and the twelve-step program. The full acceptance of these steps and the meaning that comes from believing in a higher power has created literal miracles in front of my eyes. \n\nI have seen homeless alcoholics who were months away from dying, shaking wretches of people with jaundiced eyes and wet-brain, but after a year of AA and sobriety, they were some of the most confident, happy and spiritual people I had ever known. They would give you the shirt off their back, and they constantly volunteered to save others from the brink of death. Some of them became staples of their community, devoted church members and deacons entrusted with large sums of money, and not one of them I knew ever betrayed the trust the community had in them after their recovery. AA and NA gave their lives meaning and, over time, sometimes gave them almost total inner peace.\n\nBut during the recession caused by the global Covid pandemic, I lost my job. I became desperate and applied to hundreds of jobs, absolutely anything related to counseling or helping addicts. Then one day, I got a call.\n\n“Hello, may I please speak to Jonathon?” the deep male voice said on the other end of the line. \n\n“Speaking,” I said.\n\n“Hi there, Jonathon, my name is Winston. I work for a company that is seeking highly qualified counselors such as yourself. Would you be interested in coming in for an interview?” he asked. While I was fairly desperate, I also knew that I had to ask the most important question for any potential job.\n\n“How much is the starting pay, if you don’t mind me asking?” I said bluntly. Winston chuckled slightly.\n\n“$80,000 a year,” he said. I smiled inwardly, excited about the new prospect. Most of the drug and alcohol counselors around New England made far less than that, despite the fact that the job required a college degree and years of schooling. We made plans to meet, and I went in for the interview and was hired on the spot. I was to begin immediately.\n\nWinston was a mountain of a man, at least 6’ 6” with a shaved head and tattoos all over his body. His muscles look like they had been sculpted out of marble. But he was also quite nice, smiling and laughing all the time as he showed me around the counseling building. As we neared the end of the tour, he brought me to a room in the basement where a sign had been posted on the door that said, “Meeting in progress. Come in.”\n\nHe pushed the door open slowly, and I saw a room composed of all men, most of them white. They sat in chairs that faced a podium at the front. A man was speaking there.\n\n“Thanks to this program, I’ve been clean for six months now,” he said sheepishly. He was a small man with huge glasses, balding brown hair and a pudgy belly. “I never thought it was possible, but with the grace of God and the help from all of you, I’ve done the impossible. I’ve stopped killing people… women. \n\n“I barely even get the craving anymore, and when I do, I call my sponsor, and he is there before I know it, taking the gun or knife out of my hands and talking me down before I can go through with it. It really helps, because *I* know *he* knows what it’s like. All the anger, the rage, the feelings of being so small… he’s been there before, and having someone who knows what it feels like- really, it is a miracle. Growing up, if I ever talked about my feelings, my dad, he would beat me, put me in the hospital… even broke my nose a couple times. Another time, when I was seven, he put me in a coma for a week, fractured my skull in two places… So I learned quickly to never talk about my feelings, never cry or complain. I just bottled everything up inside until it exploded.” Nods of agreement and solidarity passed through the room. Winston led me over to a chair in the back of the room and had me sit down.\n\nI thought about what the man had said. It seemed ludicrous. Was he really talking about killing people to a group of fellow addicts? I had no idea what to think. I had heard confessions in AA from people who had hit pedestrians with their cars and left the scene without stopping, due to them being drunk and afraid to go to prison, but this sounded totally different. The man finished his story, and the apparent leader of the group, a tall black man with a shaved head, got up in front of the group.\n\n“OK, thank you for sharing, Douglas,” the black man said to Douglas, the pudgy man with the huge glasses. Douglas went and sat down. I looked at the nametag on the black man’s shirt. It read, “Hi! My name is: King.” King reached into a cloth bag next to the podium, pulling out some round circular coins that I recognized instantly as sobriety chips.\n\n“And as usual, at the end of every meeting, we like to hand out chips that recognize people’s lengths of sobriety,” King said in a deep baritone, smiling widely, his face friendly and unassuming. “For Leon, we have a *ten year sobriety chip*!” King yelled, and everyone in the room stood up, applauding. A nondescript, elderly white man got up from the center of the room, smiling sheepishly as he went to the front, shaking King’s hand and taking his token. “For Douglas, we have a six month sobriety chip.” The pudgy man got back up and went to the front of the room, taking the chip and sitting back down. \n\n“And last, but not least, for Anton, we have a twenty-four hour chip.” A white man with a goatee got up and grabbed his chip. “The first twenty-four hours are always the hardest, as we all know,” King said, and the room murmured in agreement. “One day at a time, though. That’s all we can do.” The meeting ended with a serenity prayer (*Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change…)*, and everyone began to disperse. I turned to Winston.\n\n“Um, I’m confused,” I said, and he laughed, a deep, rich sound that echoed across the room.\n\n“This is a newer group,” he said, “a twelve-step program for those addicted to murder, serial killing, spree killing… anything like that. We have found that, like with drugs and alcohol, prison doesn’t really help reform these poor addicts. They don’t get any of the professional or psychological help they need while incarcerated. So we started a group here instead.”\n\n“So, these guys, they actually kill people?” I asked, horrified. He nodded.\n\n“Well, they used to,” he said. “Some of them have been in recovery for decades. Some of them are brand new at it. And this is what we hired you for- to work with these men, to help save lives, and to keep them on the straight and narrow.” He nodded, as if to himself. “It won’t be an easy job, surely, but that’s why you’re getting paid more than other counselors in the area. I’m sure you’re up for a challenge, right?” I had to think about it. I really didn’t know if I was up for a challenge of this caliber. But then again, what other job prospects did I have? I needed the money to pay my rent, otherwise my seventeen-year-old daughter and I could end up on the streets. Sighing, I nodded.\n\n“OK, yeah, I’m up for it,” I agreed.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nBlood covered the floor of the room in front of me. I looked from Leon, with his white hair and wrinkled face, to the barely-recognizable mass of blood and organs on the floor.\n\n“I’m sorry, Mr. Jonathon,” he said, crying into his hands, “I relapsed. I don’t know what happened. I was totally fine one minute, then this idiot came out of nowhere, cutting me off in traffic and flipping me off for no reason. I had to slam on my brakes to avoid hitting him. I followed him, really just to ask for an apology, but instead he started swearing at me and calling me all these horrible names and I just… kind of… blacked out.” Tears ran down his cheeks. I walked over to him, taking the bloody knife from his right hand carefully. He let it go without a fight. \n\n“It’s OK, Leon,” I said, patting him on his thin shoulder. “Relapsing is a part of the healing process. All we can do is try to figure out what went wrong this time, so we can work harder next time to prevent this from happening again.”\n\n“Ten years of sobriety, down the drain!” he screamed, falling to his knees, getting blood all over his blue jeans. I sighed, backing up to the entrance of the room, and called Winston.\n\n“Yeah, I might need a little more help here, on the basement level of the counseling building,” I said. “Leon had a relapse, and he’s in a really bad state. Do you know who his sponsor is?”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nAfter cleaning up the scene, I was talking to King and Winston about Leon.\n\n“Why did he bring his victim here, to the counseling building, do you think?” I asked. They shrugged.\n\n“This is where they’re comfortable,” King said, shrugging. “This is where they have friends and can talk openly. Maybe they just instinctively come back here during times of struggle. I really don’t know.” Just then, my phone started ringing. I looked down to see the name of my daughter on the screen: Becky. I went out into the hallway and answered it.\n\n“Hi Becky, what’s up? I’m at work right now,” I said. She sighed.\n\n“Dad, do you know a guy named Douglas?” she asked. A chill ran down my back.\n\n“Yes, why do you ask?” I said, my voice rising in pitch. I could feel my heart speeding up in my chest. Something felt very wrong about this phone call.\n\n“Um, well… he’s here, asking for you,” she said. I gasped.\n\n“Becky, get far away from him,” I said quickly. “Call the police. Get the gun out of the cabinet in my room, lock the door, and *stay there* until the cops arrive. Got it?” But someone else responded.\n\n“Hi, Jonathon,” a male voice said through the cell phone. “You have a *very pretty* daughter, by the way. I think I’ll enjoy this.”\n\n“Get away from my daughter, you sack of shit!” I screamed into the phone. Douglas laughed. Then I heard a gunshot and the line went dead. I started sprinting through the building, towards the parking lot outside. My house was only a five-minute drive from the counseling building, and I prayed I could get there in time.\n\n“Please, God, let her still be alive!” I wailed, running as fast as I could.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI ran into the house, seeing a trail of blood leading from the living room to the basement. I gasped in horror. Visions of Becky’s dead body, shoved into a barrel or cut into pieces with a chainsaw, flipped through my mind in rapid succession. I followed the trail of blood to the basement where the light was on. And what I saw there stunned me to no end.\n\nBecky stood over the dead body of Douglas. She was cutting off his head with a bandsaw, whistling to herself, an angelic smile on her smooth, placid face. There was a drain in the basement floor, and she let the blood flow down it as she cut the body into pieces, throwing each piece into a plastic barrel.\n\n“Becky, my God, what are you *doing*?” I yelled. She turned around, a look of happiness and bliss in her eyes.\n\n“Just something I enjoy doing, daddy,” she said, smiling widely. “He’s not my first, you know. You had nothing to fear. Once I saw this loser sneaking around in our backyard, scoping out the house, I just went to your room and grabbed your gun, hiding it in my hoodie. He thought he was so smart, but really, he was the easiest kill I’ve ever had.” She laughed. I quickly walked over to her, embracing her in a hug.\n\n“I’m just glad you’re alive,” I said, tears beginning to drip down my face, my vision turning blurry as a wave of emotions overtook me.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe next week, I was heading to work, Becky in the passenger seat. She was complaining, as teenagers often do.\n\n“I don’t see why I have to do these stupid groups!” she yelled at me. I sighed.\n\n“Look, you have an addiction problem,” I said to her. “I know you don’t know it yet. Teenagers never realize it. Hell, even adults are often in denial about their problems, Becky. I just want you to go talk to these people, see if you can’t relate to what they’re saying. You said you’ve killed, what, four people already?” She nodded glumly. “I’m just worried about you, sweetie. I don’t want this addiction to take over your whole life. You’re far too smart for that. You could go to college, be a doctor or an engineer or anything you want, but not if you let this addiction ruin your life!” She let out a grunt of exasperation.\n\n“Fine, I’ll go,” she said. “Will you be there with me, though?”\n\n“Always,” I said.",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the school bell rang through the corridors on a late Friday afternoon, the dread of the school week finally came to an end. Awaiting in its place, a weekend long of tutoring and trips to the learning center. On a usual Friday, I would be stopping by the cha chaan teng on my way home and enjoying a night of chinese dramas on TVB, but not today. Today was anything but usual. \n\nRight as I was about to leave the classroom, Ms Yip, the homeroom teacher, stopped me dead in my tracks. Her eyes filled with rage and nostrils flaring, I knew my evening was ruined before she even uttered a word. \n\n“Cheung Long Jiang! Where do you think you’re going?” she exclaimed arrogantly.  \n “Back home, Miss. Is there a problem?”  \n “Don’t try to act innocent. I just received a note saying that you were the one who vandalised \n\nthe prayer room. What have you got to say for yourself?”  \n “Me? Vandalising the prayer room? You have to be kidding. Just because I socked your son in \n\nthe face for harassing me does not mean you can just falsely accuse me.” My blood was boiling by the second. \n\n“Don’t make such preposterous claims, I have the note on my table, you can stop by my office after you’re done with detention tonight. I’ve already contacted your parents, they know you won’t be home until midnight. Maybe after this you will begin to respect the rules of the school.” A smirk appeared on her face as she left me there in pure bewilderment and exasperation. \n\nThe hours passed by slowly as the evening light gradually lengthened the shadows of the rusting tables and chairs. The sound of the engines of the school buses faded into the distance. Soon, I was abandoned by the school day, and left to be engulfed by the darkness at twilight. I sat at my table. The resentment towards Ms Yip subsided as I tried to make the best of this situation by studying for my DSE exams. The noise of cicadas drowned the room, accompanied by the sound of the light bulbs flickering above me. In a weird way, it was quite peaceful. But just as I started to enjoy myself, it began. Knocking. Three loud knocks on the classroom door. The hair on the back of my neck jolted upwards, I quickly glanced up and my heart skipped a beat as I saw, nothing. Not a single soul by the door, only the dimly lit hallway was in my sight. \n\nIt took me a while to gather my thoughts, but when I snapped back to reality, I came to the logical conclusion that the long school week had taken a toll on me and my mind was playing tricks on me. It’s not like this was the first time. I swiftly returned to my focused state. Knock. Knock. Knock. There it was again. This time I was sure I wasn’t hallucinating as each knock gradually became louder. Adrenaline pumping through my veins, I ran out into the hallway, hoping to catch whichever idiot was playing this sick joke on me. Alas, once again, there was no one, just an empty hallway with a single light flickering at the end of it. I was dumbfounded. Was I really under that much pressure from the DSE exams? Perplexed, I stared straight down the hallway for the longest time. Emptiness. Flicker. Suddenly, the silhouette of a man of a similar height to myself flashed before my eyes. As abruptly as he appeared. Flicker. He was gone. My heart pounded in my chest at the speed of a ping pong ball at the height of a match. Although my legs were shaking, sensibility told me to go back into the classroom and lock myself in. \n\nAs I was planning on what to do, I noticed just how awfully quiet everything was. The cicadas seemed to have retreated for the night, I glanced out the window out of curiosity, half expecting something was going to pop out like they do in horror movies, but nothing. Out of the blue, a surge of uneasiness washed over me, like something didn’t feel quite right. Something was missing. I stared at the window until my eyes began to hurt. I focused hard on the darkness that seemed to have eaten up the world. I couldn’t put my finger on it. The deathly silence was interrupted by the buzzing of the classroom lights, and as my focus shifted from the outside to the reflections on the window, that’s when it hit me. ‘Where was my reflection?’ Before I could even begin to think, Bang! I passed out. \n\nAs I gradually regained my consciousness, I noticed I was no longer in school. A rush of relief filled me when I heard the familiar voice of my mother comforting me. Apparently a prisoner had escaped from a nearby prison, and the police had found him near the school. I just happened to be an unlucky victim in the wrong place at the wrong time. Thanks to Ms Yip. \n\nReassured, I got out of bed and jumped right into the shower. As I was showering, the events of the previous night suddenly popped into my mind, the obscureness of not being able to see my reflection replaying over and over again. I quickly dismissed those thoughts and attributed them to a lack of rest. But that’s when I heard, knock, knock, knock. I slowly turned the shower off as my legs turned limp and my heart dropped. I stepped out of the shower in front of the mirror, water dripping down from my hair. I looked into the mirror and saw my own reflection smiling at me. The only thing was, I wasn’t smiling.",

        "text": "\nHey guys, my name is Abel or atleast that is what people always call me. I dont like to socialize with people around me.\n\nI do have some friends and they are kind to me. One day people at school started talking about this Battle Ground mobile game series. This is because of it new in game season.\n\nMy phone is kinda crappy and playing intense game like that might cause it to explode. So, I browse the internet to find second hand phone.\n\nI want to buy new phone but Im out of budget to say in the first place. So I take my shot into the second hand market.\n\nAfter browsing for a while I saw a phone. LG v35, and it is a good condition. It is a clearance stock sale and the seller stated that the phone is relatively good beside he never reset it yet.\n\nThat's mean I need to reset the phone myself. So the phone are about 40 dollar so I bought it. Around a week later the phone arrived.\n\nI charge it full and browse inside it. It seems like this phone old owner is an office lady. Last picture taken is around one year ago. It had some picture and apps but this phone still had around 80gb storage left so I said to myself. \"Well some picture woulndt bother me. Besides, this girl is kinda cute\"\n\nI honestly admired the girl, shee looks cute and energetic. Atleast from her video and picture. She also have media social account but I will not go into detail to protect her privacy.\n\nAfter all of that I manage to set the phone to my regional simcard setting. It is a bit of work but I god?t it done.\n\nSuddenly a pop out come. 「In order to fully guarantee your safety, au disaster alert need to ignore your location privacy」\n\nI look at it and I click yes, I said to myself \"Well this is just my secondary phone, I'll just used it tto pplay games\"\n\nEverything went normal for couples of weeks. One night when Im at the libary, my phone buzz brutally. The LG phone. I pick it up and there is a pop up saying\n\n[You are is a dangerous area, follow the following instruction to guarantee your safety.]\n\n\nI look the phone for a bit and after that I heard a heavy object crash on the first floor of the libary, I peak from the second floor and saw something that might haunted me forever.\n\nA creature with a long hair and limb is eating the librarian. This is so sudden for me, Im glad that I didnt scream as my natural reaction. I look at the creature and my phone buzz again.\n\n[Go the the third floor and use the emergency stair to get out of the building. Dont make any loud sound]\n\nI dash my way to the third floor qith the tip of my feet to avoind any noise.\n\nOnce I arrived at the emergency stair. I heard something rushing towards me. The emergency alert system started to give me warning.\n\n[Run as fast as you can to the parking lot]\n\nI do as instructed and when I arrived. The phine started to give instruction again.\n\n[To the Ford fiesta car, the door is not locked]\n\nI dash my way, open the door and slammed it.\n\n[Lock the door and laid down at the back seat]\n\nAgain I do as instructed.\n\nI heard something outside the car. I didnt dare to peak, slowly I began to fall asleep.\n\nBefore dawn, the LG phone ring. I pick it up, and a voice talk to me.\n\n\"Hello, nice to meet you\"\n\nFrom her voice, I knew. It is the previous owner. We had some conversation even thou we barely understand each other.\n\nShe allow me to keep her picture in exchange of some of my picture, she want to be friend. Im delighted and happy.\n\nI almost forgot about that night case.\n\nI snapback to reality and no one is outside. When I get out just then I saw police car. And a smal crowd outside the libary. \n\nI knew what happen so Im not that shocked. When I get to the edge of the crowd, I saw it. This cant be real.\n\nA women with office clothing on. Staring at me from the other side if the road. The previous owner, it cant be. She is in Japan.\n\n\nSuddenly.... my phone buzz again........\n.....",

        "author": "SubstantialBite788",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1165n35/my_dad_hit_me/",
        "text": "  \n\nMy dad hit me when I didn’t perform well in baseball. He was smart. He would make me take off my shirt, ball up his fist, and just waylay my back and sides. The older I got, the harder he hit. No one ever noticed because none of my bruises were visible. I made damn sure I didn’t show any pain. In school, I walked proud and tall. I gave no hint of the tremendous pain I was feeling. \n\nWhen I turned thirteen, my dad became obsessed with boxing. He put me in a gym with a boxing club. It wasn’t expensive. He just had to pay for my hand wraps, but the rest of the money came from us would-be boxers getting out on the street and basically begging for money. I hated it and most of the people hated us in turn. They would ask what charity we were collecting for, and when we would tell them its for the Jackson Boxing Club, they would get angry and roll up their windows. One woman told me, “If you want to box, use your own money.” I got admit, I agreed with her. Besides, I didn’t want to box. I was decent. I had a pretty good defense and I could land some punches, but I had no power. All my matches went the distance and I could only score with my punches, never cause any real damage. \n\nMy dad recognized my weakness. Hell, he always recognized my weaknesses. In his mind, I would find that power if only I had more endurance. He thought that I was strong in the early rounds but lost my power in the later rounds. My trainer thought otherwise. \n\n“Larry needs to work the bag. It’s technique, not endurance.”\n\n“What the fuck do you know? That’s why you are working in a rinky dink gym. You didn’t know how to fight when you were a professional and you sure as hell don’t know how to fight now.”\n\nThis is my dad talking to a former professional boxer. He always insisted that he was only paying the Jackson gym for its facilities and equipment, not for the advice of a loser has-been. Of course, he wasn’t paying anything. My dad always imagined himself as an expert, no matter his level of experience. He never played any sports as a kid. I guess he was compensating for his own failures by pushing me to succeed, and he pushed relentlessly.\n\n“Larry, success is painful, but worth it. Worth every bit of it. I wish my dad would have pushed me more. You’ll thank me one day when you are sitting on top of that mountain.”\n\nSo, the running regimen began. I had to get up every morning at three in the morning, before school. We would drive over the bridge across Percy Priest Lake. He would park on the shoulder of the road and make me run to the state park, which was closed before sunrise. The gates were always shut and chained with a lock. I was trespassing, but my dad insisted on me running every day before school. He was convinced that the early schedule and the rigorous running would instill in me a discipline advantageous to developing the mindset of a professional boxer. I had to run about a mile to the hiking trail. The trail was not a round trip. It was four miles one way. When I got to the end, I would turn around and head back the way I came. I had to do it within a certain time limit, or I was punished- fists to the back, his favorite style of punishment, and now, with my boxing career in full force, an extra way to toughen me up against body shots. He would always say, “Boxers always underestimate the body shot,” like he was some damn expert. \n\nJuly fifth was a day I will never forget. For once my dad bought some fireworks for the Fourth of July and he didn’t make me run that day. It was a great day, but the next morning he felt guilty, like he had slipped in his duties as a trainer, and he felt we needed to start extra early. He woke me up at one in the morning.\n\n“Get up boy. It’s time to run.”\n\n“But dad, I haven’t had much sleep. I’m tired. Can’t I have one more hour of sleep.” He grabbed the skin of my thigh and squeezed hard. It felt like he had grabbed me with some pliers and mashed down on the handle. I yelped in pain. \n\n“Get up now. I won’t tell you again!”\n\nI got up, took and shower, and put on my clothes. We drove across the bridge and parked the car. \n\n“You need to beat your normal time or else I’m going to beat your ass. Larry, you can’t improve if you keep doing the same old thing. You’ve got to push beyond your previous goals. If you don’t, you’ll stagnate and never get better.”\n\nI sometimes wished my dad was a drunk, then I could almost excuse some of the things he did to me as a child. He didn’t drink though. He wasn’t a religious man. It wasn’t about moral scruples. It was all about discipline for him, being a winner. Doing those things made you weak. \n\nI got out of the car and immediately started running. I would run harder than normal until I got out of his sight. I was going to save my energy for the final stretch. I thought that if I could keep my normal pace, then I would be alright. I could gain time on the front and back end. When I got to the gate, I slowed down a bit, feeling relieved that he was no longer able to see me. I hated running. I was terrible at it. My dad just had this belief that if I worked hard enough, I would be a champion, but it just wasn’t in the cards. Yet, I did enjoy the hiking trail. It felt like an escape. Once I got to the trail head and started along that dirt path, I would enter an imaginary world where I was an adult and free from my father’s control. I would talk to myself, cussing my dad, telling him he was a loser and an idiot. I would get all my anger out. That trail, those dark foreboding trees, the early morning chill, were agitating forces, provoking me to release all my hate and anger. The forest was whispering in my ear that it wasn’t a sin to hate your dad; he deserved it. \n\nI got to the end of the trail. I felt like I had a good pace going, so I stopped and stretched a bit. I heard some fireworks in the distance, and some laughter. It was a group of friends, something I longed for. They had snuck into the park like me, but instead of punishing their bodies for a career that never was going to be, they were having fun. I almost thought of finding them, but I had a task, and I didn’t want my dad to make a scene. \n\nI took off down the path, and about half-way through I heard some screaming. I could sense an agonizing fear, beyond any kind of normal surprise or discomfort. They were fearing for their lives, that fact was easily discernable. There is no mistaking that kind of scream. It was qualitatively different, a degree of fear I hope to never experience again. I stopped and listened, trying with much difficulty to slow down my breathing. All was silent. \n\nI didn’t think it a good idea to run. In fact, I got off the trail and hid in the brush for a while. I don’t know how much time I spent there but I wanted to make sure that whatever happened was finished. And then I heard some footsteps, or more appropriately someone dragging their feet across the trail, as if they were too weak to pick up their legs and walk with any effort. I was in a bend of the trail. Out from behind some trees came a shadow of a person barely able to move, limping with one leg, and dragging the other. There was a new moon, but visibility was opaque with the thick cover of trees. I heard him groaning and praying to himself. \n\n“God, Jesus, I’m sorry. Help me. Protect me from this demon. Please. Please, I’m not ready to die.”\n\nWhoever he was he hobbled into the brush on the opposite side of the trail from me. I think he decided it was best to hide like me, but he was hysterical. My feelings were ambivalent. I felt angry that he was hiding in the same place that I was, and worse, he wouldn’t shut up. He was mumbling and whispering to himself, invoking the lord God almighty for an intervention, a miracle and release from his diabolical suffering. His prayers really were poetic. \n\nI heard more footsteps, but these were healthy and strong, predatory. \n\n“Where are you little poodle? What an inferior species you are? Poodle. Poodle. I’m going to tear you apart.”\n\nIt was a metallic low shrill voice. I saw the silhouette emerge from behind the trees. At that point, somehow, someway, the moonlight shone upon the ghastly figure like a spotlight, enveloping the actor in ray of solitary light. He had long black hair. He had a grisly smile on his face, with sharp teeth, and blood all over his face. He was pale white, wearing a flannel shirt and blue jeans. He had his hands raised up to his chest and I could see that his fingernails were long and sharp, they too soaked in blood and flesh. His eyes were iridescent, shining with all the colors of the rainbow. Sometimes though, I detected a feminine quality in him, as if he was possessed by something and controlled by a sinister spirit. When he talked again, I heard more than one voice- one male, and one female. \n\n“Little poodle. Don’t hide. Don’t run. It’s over. I’ll make it quick. I promise, but you must die.”\n\n“I renounce you in the name of Jesus Christ,” he yelled.\n\n“There you are poodle! I’m so hungry.”\n\nThis monstrous being grabbed the holy petitioner by the arm and bit down hard into his forearm and ripped out muscle and flesh. The victim screamed in pain, and I did my best to keep quiet and not reveal myself. I couldn’t make out much, but I could see that the monster was chewing its food and preparing to take another bite. It did bite again, and again, and again, until the forearm had been severed from the elbow. Blood was spilling onto the underbrush and the victim had passed out and fell to the ground. I could hear the chewing and crunching of human flesh. I was sick to my stomach, and I could feel the vomit pushing up through my throat. I swallowed hard, tasting the acid and the hot dogs from the night before.\n\n“Come on poodle. I will eat you somewhere else. This spot too cold, too chill for me.”\n\nThe monster grabbed the victim by his other arm and dragged him up the path. I waited for a while until I thought that enough time had passed that the monster was far enough away for me to make my escape. I got a good distance, coming across a glade, and there in the middle, next to a tree, was a human leg. There was a shoe to the side, apart from the foot, while the sock, although still on the foot, was torn. The exposed foot was missing toes and there were obvious bite marks. I picked up my pace. Adrenaline and fear coursed through my body. My hands sweated profusely, as I tightened by fists, and swung my harms harder, hoping to move myself quicker through the murderous forest. The early morning sun was peeking through the trees, revealing the massacre that had transpired across the idyllic setting. Blood, body parts, and discarded clothing slung about the trail. It had been a bigger party than I had realized. Plenty of food for the monster to eat. \n\nI took a look behind me to see if I was followed, turned my head, and then felt my nose explode with pain, crushed into my face. My father had grown impatient, came down the trail, and punched me in the nose. I fell to my back, almost losing consciousness. \n\n“Boy, this half-ass effort ain’t gonna cut it. You’re gonna run after school today to make up for this piss poor performance.”\n\n“Dad, there’s a monster in the woods. It killed a bunch of people. We got to get out of here!” He walked over and kicked me in my side, causing me to piss myself. \n\n“Get up. I’m not putting up with this shit. You want to be a failure? You want to lose?”\n\nI heard a screech, and I knew that now the monster was aware of our presence. More food. More to eat.\n\n“What the hell was that?” \n\n“I told you dammit. There’s a monster out here.” I pushed myself up off of the ground and grabbed my dad by the arm. I started running and pulling him along. I heard growling and heavy breathing. \n\n“More poodles. More poodles to eat. Yes, inferior species is good for the belly!”\n\nI looked back and there was the monster running on all fours, like a hungry, desperate wolf. His eyes were wide, glowing purple, and then flashing red. I let go of my dad’s arm and ran as fast as I could. I heard a thump and then my dad yell, “Help! Larry, don’t leave me.” I didn’t slow down and ran towards the trail head. I stepped on a persimmon, and it exploded beneath my foot, squirting out fruit and seed. At the beginning of the trail was a persimmon tree. It was a personal tradition that when I had finished my run across the hiking trail, I would always pick up a persimmon and squeeze it in my hand. I don’t know why. I guess it was a way to symbolize my accomplishment. Not only had I beat the trail, but I had proven my dad wrong, each and every time. This time the persimmon was destroyed by a different will and with a different purpose, one more mysterious and heinous than I could ever imagine. I hated my dad, but I never wished him dead. I turned and saw the monster dragging him into the woods. My dad looked unresponsive, maybe he had resigned himself to his fate. Maybe he decided that he didn’t really deserve to live. Maybe, he felt guilty for the monster he had become.",

Pitch black welcomed us, our chemlights barely able to function as we made our way in. We were no longer in a hallway, that much I could tell. There was a feeling of a vast emptiness as we spread out. I skirted along the wall to the left, creeping slowly. I was only about thirty feet in when I heard something.\n\n***“Ca… You… Er… E,”*** Snippets of Trevor’s voice crackled in my headset. I stopped in my tracks. ***“Wade, did you hear-”***\n\n***“I did. We must be on the other edge of the house. See if you can get a better signal.”***\n\nI pushed forward a few more yards as the static slowly started to fade.\n\n***“Whiskey two come in! Paige! Anyone!”*** Trevor sounded manic. Searching out into the ether. Desperate for a response from his team.\n\nI wasted no time. ***“This is Whiskey five online. How copy?”***\n\n***“Kid? Thank god!”*** I could almost hear the weight lifting off his shoulders. ***“Where the hell are ya? Been trying to hail you for an hour.”***\n\n***“Got separated from Paige and Eric. Wade’s with me but I gotta tell ya, it’s FUBAR as a motherfucker in here. We need assistance.”***\n\n***“Where’s the Orchid Whiskey Five?”*** Shay’s gruff voice cut through the static before Trevor got a chance to respond.\n\nThis question took me back. I mean I know the Orchid takes a precedent but still. ***“Location unknown at this time. If we have another team we can find paige and-”***\n\n***“Negative.”*** He shot back before I could even finish. ***“Whiskey Five be advised, mission parameters have been adjusted. You will find and retrieve the Orchid. Linking up with Whiskey and Delta will be a secondary priority.”***\n\nI felt a twinge of anger beginning to bubble up in my throat. *“****On whose orders sir?”***\n\n***“On mine rookie. Don’t make me repeat myself.”*** \n\nI heard the squeaking of plastic as I dug my palm into the rifle grip. ***“This wasn’t part of the original brief-”***\n\n***“I don’t give a shit what it’s a part of!”*** He shouted back over the comm channel loud enough to make my ear ring. ***“My op, my orders. There are enough brain cells left in that inbred cesspit you call a skull to follow orders isn’t there?!’***\n\n***“That’s enough!”*** Trevor shouted out. The channel went quiet for a moment leaving only the quiet hum of radio static.\n\n***“Listen Kid,”*** He came back a moment later. ***“I don’t like it anymore than you do but my hands are tied.”***\n\nI looked back over to Wade. His face was building with anger at the disrespect. \n\n***“It’s not your fault Trevor. I understand. What can you give me?”*** \n\nHe let out a sigh and thought for a moment. ***“If you can give me a minute I’ll get the power rerouted. Should be easier to maneuver when you're not bumping into shit, eh?”***\n\n***“If that’s what you can give me I’ll take it.”*** I said solemnly. \n\n***“Roger. Standby.”*** With that the line went dead again.\n\n***“Don’t hold it against him.”*** Wade said, after a moment to break the silence. ***“He just doesn’t want to see us riding the bench again like these past few months.”***\n\n***“It’s not him I’m angry at.”*** I shot back. ***“It’s that knock off Wolverine up there with him.”*** \n\nHe let out a small chuckle. ***“You’re not the only one.”***\n\nWe stood there and waited for what felt like an eternity. I listened for anything I could. Eventually, I started to hear something. Something organic. Squelching and churning. Like fluid being pushed through a tube. \n\n*‘What the h-’* \n\n***“Kid? You there?”*** Trevor’s voice came back, breaking me from my thoughts.\n\n***“Yeah. Go ahead.”***\n\n***“Roger. Bringing powergrid online in 3… 2…1,”*** The light’s flickered before settling and illuminating the space. The fluorescent buzzing, drowning out the sound. I was blinded for a moment, having to shield my face and wait for my eyes to adjust. What I saw when they did made me want to claw them out.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nWe had found Delta. Well, what was left of them anyways. Their lifeless bodies were twenty feet above us lashed to the rafters by large, white vines. Stems protruded from their husks, implanted into their bodies. A massive, organic tube was jammed into their mouths pumping out fluids in a loud, sickly, squelch. It swayed gently, clinging to the skin covered skeletons. They looked like they had been dead for decades. But there was no doubt, from the ripped clothing they had on, to the emblazoned D that clung to a scrap of fabric on their shoulders, it was them.\n\nI struggled to keep the vomit in the back of my throat from bursting forth as Wade threw caution to the wind, ripping off his mask and puking on the floor. I wasted no time in trying to get through to Trevor.\n\n***“Whiskey Five to Whiskey One, we got a problem, a big fucking problem!”*** I shouted into the headset.\n\n***“What’s going on Kid?”*** Trevor’s concerned voice came over as I looked over and watched Wade quickly wipe his mouth putting his mask back on with shaking hands.\n\n***“Delta is dead.”*** I said matter of factly. ***“I’m looking at the bodies now, the fucking plant is draining them of… well I don’t know what it’s doing but they’re gone man!”***\n\nShay cut back over once again in a calm, calloused, tone echoing through the static. *“****Leave the bodies, finish the mission.”***\n\n*“But-”*\n\n*“****Do what you're told, rookie. They’re useless now.”*** The line went dead as I let out a frustrated scream.\n\n***“I hate to keep up the bad news.”*** Wade said after I threw my voice out. ***“But a thought just occurred to me.”*** \n\nI looked over at him as my mind reached the same conclusion. ***“If that’s Delta, then who’s with Pai-”***\n\nA shot rang out to the east as Wade and I took off. We ran through door after door, paying no mind to the walls, once beset by dark and beautiful wood, now covered in a mass of white, pustulous vines. The hallways had turned into a hellish jungle. Where carpet had been hours before, a damp earthen floor had taken over. The air felt hot and sticky on my skin, causing my clothes to stick to my body. I didn’t care. I just needed to reach them in time. \n\nWade charged forward and drove his shoulder into what was now a rotted mass of planks opening us up into the foyer. We saw them, Paige and Eric backed against a wall, draped in vines that were slowly snaking their way down to them. Looming before them, cackling in an unnatural and nearly manic droll, stood a group of creatures. They may have at one point been human, but that was no longer the case. The figures before me now were emaciated, deformed, and hungry. Their mismatched limbs were protruding from every part of their Lovecraftian mass. The monsters’ skin had been peeled back, exposing the white bone that now spiked itself throughout their bodies. Not one of them had eyes. Just differing amounts of pitch black slits that dotted their now deformed heads. Each one jerked back and forth in the same puppet-like fashion as Raul did in the picture, lashing out at them, taunting them. Drinking in their fear.\n\nI didn’t hesitate. My body functioned on instinct as I raised my rifle and watched the torrent of bullets rip them to shreds. Wade followed my lead as the room began to fill with the sounds of gunfire, and the stench of carbon.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nIt took a moment for the dust to settle. I had my finger still pressed down on the trigger, even \n\nthough I had run dry two minutes ago. Finally, I saw Paige. She sprinted to me and embraced me in a tight hug. I felt the tears that were running down her cheeks, coat my neck, as Eric walked up behind her, his rifle slung across his shoulders. \n\n***“Man, I gotta tell ya. Your timing is impeccable.”*** Eric said as he let out a massive sigh. \n\nWade and I let out a soft chuckle as I looked down at Paige. She finally let go and looked back at me, wiping her eyes.\n\n***“We tried to wait. These… things. We thought they were Delta. They started to change. If you guys hadn’t shown up… I don’t know-”*** She trailed off as I gave her an understanding nod. \n\nShe took a moment to herself as she fiddled with her earpiece. \n\n***“Whiskey One, this is Whiskey Two how copy?”*** \n\n***“I’m here Paige. Are you okay? Where’s Eric?”*** Trevor came back over the radio, speaking ecstatically. \n\n***“Right here Doc. Thanks to Markus here. We need an Exfil.”*** \n\n***“Yeah, about that.”*** Trevor’s voice deflated as he explained the situation.\n\nLivid was an understatement to Paige’s emotions after Trevor finished filling her in. I couldn’t even keep up with the Spanish she was using but I knew enough to know that Shay would be on her shitlist til the day he died. \n\n***\"Goddammit!\"*** She shouted as her boot went through an abomination's skull. I think she just needed to break something. To feel like she had some sort of control. After a moment, she caught herself and found her composure, exhaling a deep sigh as she looked at the lot of us.\n\n***“We gotta find this thing.”*** She said, grabbing her rifle and checking the ammunition. **”*****If it’s grown large enough to start affecting such a large area, we can assume it will need to be in an equally large space. It’s not like it can grow legs or anything.”***\n\n***“Well-”*** Eric began as he chambered another round. ***“I mean we don’t know that it can’t.”***\n\nWe stood there for a few minutes, each of us silently thinking about our next move.\n\n***“What about the basement?”*** I said. ***“Think about it. It’s still a plant after all. You can’t just put it in a vase like a bouquet of roses. It needs a place to lay down roots.”***\n\nEveryone turned and nodded to each other in agreement. If only we had known at that time what was waiting for us down there, we would have left and turned this place into fucking ash.\n\nThe first thing I noticed upon entering the basement was the smell. Even with my mask pumping filtered air into my lungs, I still picked up that sickly sweet smell. Like butterscotch and bubblegum boiled in a vat of maple syrup, courtesy of the green pustules coating the walls, pumping out a dense green mist. \n\n***“Holy hell,”*** Eric said, while trying to stifle a wheeze, ***“Smells like a warehouse full of Old Spice in here.”*** \n\n***“Try breathing in through your mouth.”*** Paige responded quietly. Seemed like she was still trying to maintain her professionalism even after everything that had happened. ***“The scent won’t be as overpowering.”*** \n\n***“10-4 Cap. I’ll be the best mouth breather here.”*** Eric chuckled to himself as my foot hit solid ground. \n\n***“Think I hit the bottom”*** I radioed back as I felt Wade's presence behind me. The air was thicker here. Almost heavy. Like I felt its weight more than the vest and rifle I was carrying.  The fact the only light showing was from the plants covering the wall to my left made it even harder for me to get my bearings.  \n\n***“Whiskey One this is Five”*** I said, continuing to scan the room, struggling to make my eyes adjust. \n\n***“Loud and clear Five.”*** Trevor’s gravelly voice crackled back ***“Send it.”*** \n\n***“We’ve reached the basement, no power though. Care to help out?”*** \n\n***“No can do Kid. Nothing in the blueprints of wiring running down there. You’re in the dark now.”***\n\n*‘Of fucking course we are’* I thought as I reached for the light on my rifle. \n\n*“I’d ask you not to do that.”* A voice came from everywhere and nowhere at once. *“Bright light hurts my eyes.”* It was a woman’s voice. Calm and soothing, like a mother trying to comfort a crying baby. \n\nNo one said a word. I felt the air grow thicker on my shoulders. Like some invisible force was holding me down, preventing me from moving. It wasn’t fear this time that kept me in place. It was exhaustion. I didn’t WANT to move. I just wanted to stand and rest. To close my eyes for a moment. \n\n*“Allow me to help you child. To light your path into my heart.”* The voice called out to us again. I could feel the weight lift for a moment with the words she spoke. All my cares and worries, gone in an instant as the walls began to move. This low, undulating sound gurgled throughout the room as glowing plants pushed themselves out from the walls and floor. Not all at once but in rows. Two rows, a pathway.\n\nMy feet moved on their own. I didn’t so much walk as I shuffled, following this path of bioluminescent plants to wherever they took me. Wherever that voice came from. I knew that I just needed to be in her presence. To be embraced by something so loving. I exited that room and made my way through a long hallway, its walls painted as if by the brush of a gardener, as flowers bloomed from every crack and seam.\n\nEventually I came to the end of my search. My rest and respite was on the other side of this giant oak door. It stood easily eight feet tall, carved from wood so ancient I could feel her reach out to me through the very fibers from which it was crafted.\n\n*“Come to me my child, come and take your final form away from this fleshy shell.”* I obeyed, and opened the door. Beyond that threshold could only be described as heaven. A bright light bathed over me, warming me to my core. I felt… clean. All the blood and grime coating me beforehand was gone. The sweat that had dripped off my forehead vanished. I was as pure as the woman who stood in front of me. She was the vision of beauty, wrapped in a white floral gown, with long dark hair that went to her waist, a smile that made me melt, accented by a dimple on her right cheek.  \n\nShe opened her arms wide, beckoning me to embrace her, white petals falling from her hands. I did everything I could to make my way to her. As tired as I was, dammit I would crawl if I had to. My hands reached out to her. I was speechless. I mean, I could have used a million words to describe her, but the only one that fit was, perfection.\n\nI finally reached her. Reached out for her. Just hoping to have so much as a glancing touch. She reached out with her slender pale hand, caressing my face. I felt that warmth that had touched my soul radiate from her fingertips. It was an overwhelming bliss.  \n*“You’re so tired, so pained by this rotted world. I think you’ve suffered enough don’t you?”*\n\nI nodded, my mouth dry and mute. My hands began to go limp as I felt the grip of my rifle starting to slip.\n\n*“I can give you rest.”* She cooed softly. *“Whatever it is your heart desires. You simply need to let me in.”*\n\nI started to nod. To say yes and accept her offer. Finally be able to close my eyes, my mind. I deserved this. But… that’s not what escaped my lips.\n\n***“M-My Friends..”*** I managed to say in a low, monotone, droll after some serious effort. \n\nShe began to giggle. No, that wasn’t quite right. She was laughing. Laughing as if she had just been told a terrible joke. There was nothing soft and comforting. What I had said seemed so ridiculous it amused her.\n\n*“Forget them.”* She said after finally calming herself.  *“ They shall serve me in… other ways.”*\n\nWith that, she slowly slid her fingers down my cheek, grabbing my chin and turning it to look behind me. I saw what she meant. \n\nPast the beauty, past the shimmering light, and an aura of warmth and love, stood an open doorway. A doorway back to the world of grime and pain I had just left. Beyond that doorway, stood three bodies, writhing, and struggling against a sea of dark green vines that had lashed them to the wall. The plants pulsed and shifted oddly. Wriggling at erratic speed as they struggled to pin down the rest of the team. More like tentacles than actual plants.\n\n*“Look at them.”* The woman’s voice rang out again. Just as soft as the first time I heard it, but somehow wrong. Like another voice was speaking in tandem with hers. A low, guttural, almost demonic tone, that slid in under her honeyed words. *“Merely food for my children. Either too stupid, or invalid to accept my gifts.”*\n\nI saw them writhing in agony. Eric using his rifle to try to press the floral mass off of him. Wade, grabbing and tearing whatever he could in half. His mask was cracked and ripped nearly off his face. Paige I could barely see. Only the top of her head was visible while she struggled against the weight. They looked exhausted. Three tiny specs in an ocean of green. Wade’s eyes met mine as the woman spoke again. \n\n*“Those who fail to evolve need not worry about rest. They will rest eternally as those unremembered.”* \n\nI heard that undertone again. This time only louder. In fact, her voice was the only thing I heard as I looked on, watching my team be crushed. I locked in on Wade again, his eyes meeting mine, and… I could’ve sworn I saw his mouth move.   \n*“Do not weep for them.”* The voice was more devil than darling now. A black abyss of malice and hate.\n\nI caught Wade’s mouth moving again and focused intently, trying to read his lips as they strained in the forced silence. One word. Offset.\n\n*“They were never special.”* The demon’s guttural voice echoed in my mind, as my body shivered, like a snake slid its tongue up my neck.\n\nOffset. To combat by distraction. Often using an embarrassing or outlandish memory that can’t be corrupted. I tried to search my brain through the fog that had taken over it. I found nothing. All my thoughts felt gray and foggy. Clouds obscuring my very being. I had to look for something. Something to reach out to and pull reality to me.   \n*“They were never like Raul.”*\n\nI found my answer as I tried to get my body to move. My left hand felt like it was stuck in mud as I slowly forced it down my right arm. My eyes remained locked on Wade’s silhouette as it began to be consumed by the mass. I was running on faith as my hand gripped my pinky, pulling it to its furthest point, twinges of pain coursing through my mind. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.\n\n*“They were never like you.”*\n\nThe next sound I heard was my finger breaking at the joint. The one after that was a gut wrenching scream escaping my own lips. My eyes opened and I turned.\n\nThe thing before me was no longer a beautiful woman. Her long dark hair became a matted greasy mess that stuck to a sickly green and twisted body. The joints hung in odd angles, protruding through the skin. Her once angelic face now took the form of starfish, budding flowers overgrowing out through white bone, a large black hole sat in the center, oozing out a sickly green slime. No longer did I hear the dulcet tones of a mother. Only alien like clicking and popping  that escaped from somewhere at no set cadence. \n\nIt looked at me for just a moment, jerking its head to the side in confusion. \n\nIt only took another moment for me to draw my pistol and put a round through its face.\n\nThe creature recoiled in agony, sending out a pained screech that nearly burst my eardrums. I fought through the pain and fired again. The second shot sent it sprawling to the ground. I rushed forward, trying to ignore my useless hand, as I planted a boot on its chest. \n\n***“You’re not a god.”*** I said quietly, through gritted teeth. ***“Just a weed with legs.”*** \n\nThe creature roared and shot its face towards me, opening and closing with a gross suckling sound. The only thing it latched onto were the bullets that erupted from the chamber, as I emptied the mag.\n\nIt had stopped moving after the third shot. The other five made sure it stayed still. \n\nI looked around, waving the gun smoke away from my mask, trying to find my bearings once again. The bioluminesce that once lit the room slowly began to fade. All the vines that infested the walls started to wilt and grow limp. That’s when it hit me. \n\n***“Fuck!”*** I turned and sprinted back towards the doorway. Hoping beyond hope I still had time.   \n\n\n***“Shit shit shit shit shit. Guys! Can you hear me?!”*** I reached the wall covered in dying vines, frantically pulling at them with my good hand. I didn’t have to dig too long before a large dark hand shot through the pile, then another. They came together and tugged at a massive clump, ripping them out with a sickening sucking sound. The massive body of Wade shot through its confinement, gasping for breath, before turning and grabbing at the vines next to him. \n\n***“Don’t just stand there man.”*** He shouted, gasping for breath. ***“Help me get the others.”***\n\nIt took a few minutes but we managed to claw our way through, dragging a near unconscious Eric and a definitely unconscious Paige from the tangled mass. \n\n***“We should be good to lay em down.”*** I said, as I sat Paige’s limp body on the dirt, letting out a sharp yelp of pain caused by my finger glancing her kit.\n\n***“What the hell happened?***” Wade asked, as he dropped Eric’s body to the ground with a heavy thud. A low groan slowly came from him that Wade ignored as he walked over and grabbed my hand. \n\nI sucked in hard through my teeth and jerked away. ***“Ahh! Fuck man! I slept on it wrong. What do you think?!”***\n\n***“Stop flinching.”*** He said, reaching out and pulling my arm into his vice-like grip. “***You’re useless until we get this fixed.”***\n\n***“You’re one to talk…”*** I muttered under my breath.\n\n***“What was that?”*** He looked up at me, cocking an eyebrow. \n\n***“Oh nothing. But we need to find Raul and grab the flower. We can take care of this later.”***\n\nHe cocked his head to the side to give me a ‘really bro?’ look, until his attention was focused elsewhere. He released his grip and stepped past me. \n\n***“Found him.”*** \n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nRaul Delgado was dead. For how long I’m not sure. But his bone white body, trapped against a stone chair by vine-like chains, told me that he had been for some time.\n\n***“Jesus Christ.”*** I said under my breath as Wade searched him. He looked as he did in the picture. Same cocoon like head. Same lattice like bone around his body. Like a weird modern piece of art.\n\n***“Dude’s been dead for months.”*** Wade said, wiping the grime and dirt on the side of his pants. He stood up quickly and thumbed his communicator over to the OP channel.   \n***“Whiskey Three to One, how copy?”***\n\nWe listened to static for a moment before Trevor came over the other side.  \n\n***“Read you loud and clear Three. Send it.”***\n\n***“Found Delgado, not breathing but we got him here in the basement.”***\n\nShay’s voice quickly cut through the other line. ***“The flower, Three, did you find the flower?”***\n\nWade’s eye cut to the lifeless mass of the starfish plant on the ground and let out a heavy sigh.\n\n***“Yeah… We found it. Gonna need a trash bag for it though.”***\n\n***“What the hell do you mean, Three?”*** Shay sounded livid as he spat out over the comm link.\n\n***“I MEAN, that Markus filled it with enough lead to start a pencil factory.”***\n\nThere was a long pause on the radio. I was waiting to hear Shay rip me a new one. Instead, Trevor’s mountain man twang came over.\n\n***“Mission Statement accepted Whiskey Three, Sanitation team en route. Do you require medical attention?”*** \n\n***“Affirmative. And Trevor… be a doll and send a few stretchers would you?”***\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nWhen I left Delgado’s compound, I had to fight the urge to rip my mask off and breathe the fresh air. We stayed for a while with Eric and Paige, waiting for the medics to arrive, and even longer for them to set my finger back and splint it. It only took seeing our sanitation squads scurrying around maskless for me to give in. I quickly unstrapped my mask, breathing heavily through my nose and closing my eyes… I think that was why I didn’t see Shay’s fist as it connected with my temple. \n\n*“You insubordinate piece of trash.”* \n\nThe force of the blow sent me hard against the wall of the house. I was able to duck just in time as another fist made contact with the siding, cracking it nearly in half.\n\n*“When I give an order, you fucking follow it! This is why Delta died. You and the rest of your shitbag team.”*\n\nI stood up and took a stance. I wasn’t sure if I could take him, in this condition, but I could take enough. I braced myself as he lunged forward. The blow never came. In the blink of an eye, Trevor and Wade had him pinned against the wall, him straining and turning even more red with anger.\n\n*“What the hell is your problem?!”* Trevor bellowed. *“How dare you touch him!”*  \nShay eventually broke free. He was breathing heavily as he stood and pointed a finger my way.  \n\n*“Do you have any idea the amount of money that Orchid could have carried? All for this little shit to waste.”*\n\n*“Need I remind you…”* Trevor began, *“That was the result of immediate reaction on my team's part. I’m not going to lose another one because you’re seeing dollar signs.”* \n\n*“Oh yeah?”* Shay puffed his chest out and stepped in front of Trevor. They stood nose to nose, neither man taking their eyes off the other. *“Wasn’t that hard for you in Oslo was it?”*\n\nI felt the heat coming from Trevor as he balled his fist. *“You really gonna blame Oslo on me?”*\n\n*“You were the Op Lead, you tell me.”*\n\n*“You got some set of balls saying that…”*  \n*“Why is it that when men get into fights, the subject of testicles always comes up?”* Kate’s soft dulcet tones cut through, causing all us to turn. She was standing there with the rest of her team, ghillie suit hanging loosely off of her slender frame, rifle slung across her back. \n\n*“This doesn’t concern you Watanabe.”* Shay said, his eyes turning back to Trevor. *“Grab your shit and prep for exfil.”*\n\n*“On the contrary…”* she spoke as she elegantly strode to where Shay stood. *“I’d like to think anything related to merc on merc violence would be in the front of any TL’s mind.”* She grabbed him forcefully and spun him to face her. *“Wouldn’t you agree, Shay? After all… friendly fire is a hell of a way to go.”*\n\nThe gorilla of a man growled, replying with a sneer. *“Yeah, you would know all about that, wouldn't you doll face?”*\n\nThere was a collective hush and intake of air as she giggled softly and leaned to meet his face, her lips inches from him. \n\n*“I know enough to know you can’t prove a thing. But if the rumors ARE true, then I would know exactly where to bury the bodies wouldn’t I?”* \n\nThat was enough for Shay to stay quiet. He stormed off grumbling something about corporate, and margins. Kate blew him a kiss and laughed again before turning to Trevor, Wade, and me. \n\n*“Appreciate the help Kate.”* Trevor spoke first, breaking the silence. *“Things were looking hairy for a second there.”*\n\nShe waved her hand dismissively. *“Think nothing of it. He’s an ass and all talk. Mostly anyway. Try to actually stay out of trouble yeah?”* She smiled and laughed again, turning and walking back to her team as they loaded into SUVs that were taking us back to the city. *“Dead men are a pretty big turn off for me!”* She yelled out, not looking back as the door shut behind her.\n\n*“I think I’m in love.”* I said after a few moments. The laughter from Wade and Trevor was so loud it masked the sound of the tires from our transport as they pulled up beside us. \n\nWade shook his head, still chuckling as he grabbed my rifle and his. *“Dead man walking.”* \n\n*“Yeah Kid…”* Trevor spoke after seeing the vehicle carrying Eric and Paige off. *“You’ll have a better time surviving on missions than with her. Trust me.”*\n\n*“Oh?”* I asked as I climbed into the passenger seat. *“And how would you know?”*\n\n*“Story for another time kid.”* Trevor grunted as he shut his door. *“Story for another time. Let’s just grab some rest. Gotta report bright and early for an ass chewing tomorrow.”*\n\nHe didn’t have to tell me twice. I was already slumped against the window, quickly falling asleep. It had been a long ass night.",

        "text": "I couldn't believe my luck when I stumbled upon the perfect apartment in the city. I had just moved to a new city for work and was struggling to find a decent place to live. But then, I found it - a spacious apartment with a great view, and the rent was incredibly cheap. At first, I thought it was too good to be true, but I signed the lease anyway. Little did I know that I was about to become a prisoner in my own home.\n\nAt first, it was just small things - objects moving on their own, doors creaking open, and strange noises coming from the walls. I dismissed them as my imagination playing tricks on me, but the unease I felt kept growing stronger with each passing day. It was like a constant presence was lingering around me, and I couldn't shake it off.\n\nOne day, while exploring the apartment, I stumbled upon a small room hidden behind a loose shelf in the living room. The room was musty and dark, but there was something about it that drew me in. It was like a magnetic force was pulling me towards it. As soon as I stepped into the room, I knew that something was not right. The air was thick and heavy, and I could hear whispers all around me. I tried to leave, but the door had locked itself from the outside. I was trapped.\n\nThat's when I saw it - a strange symbol etched into the wall. It was like some kind of ritualistic marking, but I didn't know much about that kind of thing. As soon as I saw it, the symbol started to glow, and it was like a portal opening up in front of me. I could see glimpses of another world beyond it. I closed my eyes and hoped it would go away.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes again, the room was back to normal. The symbol was gone, and the whispers had stopped. But I knew that something had changed. It was like a switch had been flipped, and I was now living in a world where the paranormal was a reality.\n\nThe activity became more frequent, and it was impossible to ignore. I could feel the entity lurking around me, even when it wasn't visible to my eyes. It was like a shadow that was always following me, and I couldn't shake it off. The fear that I felt was overwhelming, and it was slowly eating away at me.\n\nI tried everything to get rid of it - sage, prayers, even calling in a priest. But nothing worked. The more I tried to fight it, the stronger it became. It was like it was feeding off my fear, and it was getting stronger by the day. I was living in constant fear, always lurking around the corner of my eye, I can sometimes feel its faint breath on the back of my neck and I felt like I was going crazy.\n\nI started to see the entity more frequently, and it was always in the form of a shadow. It was like a black mass that was moving around me, and I could feel its presence even when I couldn't see it. It was like it was toying with me, and it was enjoying it.\n\nOne night, I woke up to find the entity standing at the foot of my bed. It was like a black mass, and it was pulsating with a strange energy. I could feel its breath on the back of my neck, and I could feel its eyes on me. I tried to scream, but no sound came out. It was like the entity had taken away my voice.\n\nAfter that night, I knew that I had to leave the apartment. It was like the entity was now a part of me, and I couldn't escape it. I tried to leave, but it was like it was following me. I could sense its presence wherever I went, and I knew that it was not going to leave me alone. I'm now living in a constant state of fear, and I don't know how much longer I can take it.\n\nAs the weeks passed, I became increasingly paranoid and anxious. The entity seemed to be growing more powerful and its presence was becoming more intense. The slightest creak or bump in the night would send me into a panic, and I found myself staying up late into the night, trying to avoid sleep and the nightmares it would bring.\n\nOne day, I decided to do some research on the apartment building. I dug through old newspaper archives and talked to some of the building's longtime residents. That's when I discovered the truth about my apartment. It turned out that the building had a dark history, with rumors of strange rituals and disappearances dating back to the early 1900s. I also found out that previous tenants had experienced similar paranormal activity in the apartment, with some even claiming to have seen apparitions and heard voices. But not as serious as this.\n\nAt that point, I knew that I had to take action. I couldn't continue living in constant fear, and I couldn't let the entity control my life any longer. I started to research exorcisms and contacted a few experts in the field. But I wasn't satisfied with any of them. They all seemed like conmen trying to make a quick buck out of someone's misery. But one day when I shared my situation at work one of my colleagues from India told me he knows a powerful tantric practitioner who has helped their community in the matter of paranormal. As usual I was very skeptic, but I was also desperate. So took his contact details.\n\nThe guy was a digital ghost and it was a task and a half to just get ahold of him. It wasn't easy, but eventually, I found his place but then it took a whole lot of pleading and begging to make him willing to help me as he repeatedly tried to get me to leave. He was also the first person to not ask for any money but instead he had a list of demands and items. When I was about to leave he gave a pair of white clothes that appeared to be some kind of elongate pajama or a closed robe all the while chastising me for my carelessness and complaining about money he's losing because of me and something about his boss at work at which point he switched to speaking in his Indian language and I left.\n\nI got back and contacted my friend from work and showed him the list as I could not make the head or tail of it except for a few items like coconut, lemons, eggs. I decided to stay in a motel for the day while my friend did the shopping. It was sundown by the time he returned, he had bought some weird stuff like some kind of powders, of different colors, a bunch of dry wood, twigs and leaves, etc. We left for my apartment and when we reached the guy called and told me to have a cold shower and wear the clothes he gave me. I did as he instructed. \n\nHe had arrived by the time I was out of the shower and was already in that room chanting something inside a circular design he made using the colored powders, with a fire burning in the middle of it inside a metallic container. He had place lemons all over the floor and had kept 3 eggs in front of him with some kind of yellow and red powder on the shells. When I entered the room he gestured me to sit on a wooden plate cross legged. After me and my friend put in a lot of effort to get me to sit cross legged, I had decided with great conviction that I will take yoga classes from then on. Then he bound a reddish thread around my wrists and asked me to wear an amulet tied to a necklace made from black thread and marked my forehead with something that looked like talc and then a red powder and then a black stuff that felt like burnt engine oil but smelled like soil after it had rained a little. \n\nThen he started the ritual by placing a small brass idol inside a plate in front of him and started to chant something while pouring water and other liquids on the idol using a small weird shaped copper spoon that looked like an artefact. The ritual was a grueling and terrifying process, I felt sharp pain in different parts of my body and every time I felt like *that was it* for me. But I continued to follow his instructions no matter what, put stuff into the fire whenever he told me to, squashed some lemons, threw some over my head towards the back where the symbols were. He placed the three eggs in a weird earthen container wrapped in some kind of wide leaf. He stopped chanting for a while and kept staring at them for a couple of minutes, even me and my friend were doing the same.And them we heard them cracking, and a blood like liquid started flowing out from inside the wrapped leaves. Then he rubbed his hands a clapped twice really loud like a couple of gunshots, I shook in terror from the noise. \n\nHe then calmly got up holding the container full of that blood like liquid, took a small dried twig with branches dipped it in the container. He gestured me to stay put and not move. He walked behind me and started drizzling the wall with the etched symbols with that red liquid. He came back and doused a lit camphor in to the container while chanting something, suddenly, the liquid set it self ablaze and burned with bright blue flames with such ferocity  like it was coming from a blowtorch. Then it stopped burning abruptly and when I looked back, the container had a clear water like liquid inside it instead of the blood colored one and also the quantity seemed to have halved. The eggs and leaves had disappeared.\n\nHe scooped some of that with his copper spoon and poured it into the fire. A thick white smoke started coming from it. He handed me an earthen pot with some kind of marking around its neck. There was a chunk of black substance inside it that looked like charcoal. Then all the pain in my body disappeared abruptly. I though for a second, was that it, the ritual was done? But then came the sharpest pain in my chest as if my heart was being pierced with a hot iron knife, the pain was so excrucuating, I had my mouth wide open but my vocal cords felt so wound tight that I could barely make a sound. Then I started  to feel really really nauseous and light headed, he gestured me to puke into the container.\n\nI followed through and puked out about a fist full worth dark slimy goop into the clay pot and when I looked carefully it had strands of a substance that glowed with a bright blue hue. He immediately put a lid on the pot and took it from my hand. That was the moment when I felt like a weight had been lifted off my chest, I felt a breeze of calmness and bliss emanating from inside me. I knew I had been release from the clutches of evil. I just looked at my friend with a smile of gratitude and he  smiled back in acknowledgement. Meanwhile the tantrik was rigorously winding the clay pot with a lot of read thread sealing it shut until every bit of the pot was covered in thread and then some on top of it. He then placed the pot in a red piece of cloth and wrapped it with it and bound it tightly. He was putting so much force in to the knot that I was worried he might crush the pot inside.\n\nHe said it was over. Then he got up to walk out. Before he left he told me to keep wearing the amulet and thread around my wrists. Gave me couple of spare ones in case I lost the ones I had and gave me the address of a temple where I can get them bound. He gave me a small card with a photo of some deity and some incantation looking things in the back and a little bit of red powder wrapped in a small piece of paper he tore from the news paper and instructed to always keep them on me either in my purse or backpack. He then pointed to my door, and said \"Don't come back more than three time, you leave house and find new. Until then stay his house, very good food\" as he pointed at my friend, we both laughed sheepishly. I tried to give him some money, he profoundly refused and instead told me \"You too curious. Don't. Vet bad habit. Stop\" \n\nAnd then he gave me a visiting card. It was for a landscaping company. I should have kept my mouth shut, but I said I wasn't rich enough to own a house yet, which duly prompted him to shame me by comparing me to some rich people of my age that he knows of and told me if I don't work harder then no one will marry me, he swore up and down about how good their service was and asked me to refer them if anybody I knew needed landscaping done. We said our goodbye, my friend timidly said his relatives were coming to his house after the guy left, I laughed and told him I wasn't actually gonna move in to his house, he laughed meekly in response. \n\nI grabbed everything important to me put it all in a large box and moved out. A couple of hours later my friend came back with enough food to feed an entire village for a month. I really had to have him sit down and explain to him that I had zero intentions of moving with him nor I felt bad about it. Even though he told me  I could come back three times, one time was already too many for me.  So I moved all of it to my motel room. A couple of hours later my friend came back with enough food to feed an entire village for a month. I really had to have him sit down and explain to him that I had zero intentions of moving with him nor I felt bad about it. The next day I had a moving company move my stuff into storage. I left that room and the stuff inside untouched.\n\nI moved out of the motel soon after that and never looked back my old apartment again. But the experience left a lasting impression on me. I realized that there are things in this world that we can't explain, and that sometimes we have to confront our fears head-on in order to overcome them.\n\nNow, I'm more cautious about the places I choose to live, and I always make sure to research the history of a building before I move in. I still have nightmares about the entity and the small room, but I know that I'm stronger for having faced them. They also stop if I keep that photo and paper sachet under my pillow, so I've made a habit of that before I go to sleep.\n\nIf you ever find yourself in a similar situation, don't hesitate to reach out for help. There are people out there who can assist you, no matter how terrifying the situation may seem. And remember, sometimes the scariest things are the ones that we can't see.",

        "text": "“Come to us.”\n\n\nThe hands were reaching from the ceiling.\n\n\n“It’s not fair.”\n\n\nI can feel them under my feet too.\n\n\n“We miss you.”\n\n\nAnd on the walls.\n\n“I’m sorry…I really am sorry, I didn’t want this. I did not want any of this. It was never my intention…”\n\nI woke up sweaty in my bed. My phone was ringing with a familiar ringtone, I sat up and picked up the call.\n\n“Hey…you can’t still sleep?” The other person on the side, my best friend asked.\n\n\n“Hey Anthony…yeah I can’t sleep, it’s the same nightmare again.” I replied, holding back my tears.\n\n\n“You’ve been having nightmares every day since we got out of the hospital. It has been 2 months since then. Is the therapy not working?” He was concerned for me, I can tell it.\n\n“I think it helped somewhat but it’s just I keep getting this nightmare. I don’t know…I feel guilty.” I wasn’t able to hold it off this time, tears started to drop “I miss them a lot.”\n\n“...Don’t feel guilty. If anything I should be the one feeling guilty. I did nothing and you were the one who saved me. If it weren't for you, I’d be... with them. It's also been on my mind, that’s why I keep waking up in the middle of the night.” I know he was also feeling sad.\n\n“Want me to come over?” I asked.\n\n“That would be great. Thank Don.”\n\nI hung up and as I looked up I saw something moving away from the door frame, but it was just too dark for me to make out what it was. I was sure it was just a hallucination, after all, I got a lot of those since the accident.\n\nI quickly changed into my casual clothes and immediately left for Anthony’s place.\n\nOn my way to his place, I recalled the accident that happened just a few months ago that left all of my friends dead. It was supposed to be a happy end-of-the-year trip, but everything went wrong when the bus swirled off the road and into the forest below. Anthony sustained a minor injury but my injuries were not that much worse. I’ve been known for having great strength so I was able to hold onto one of the seats for a while with one hand while holding Anthony’s hand with the other. It didn’t last long because when the bus hit the ground, it knocked both of us back and we both fell on top of our friends’ lifeless bodies. The faces of people we all knew so well, now the last thing I remembered about them was their faces.\n\nAfter driving for a bit, I finally arrived at his place. But before I clicked the doorbell, I felt someone, something watching me, and there was more than one. I looked to the window where Anthony’s room should be and I saw countless pairs of eyes staring right at me, they were pulsating and twitching around like they were silently judging me. And as if on cue, they all closed at once, making the window look normal again.\n\nEver since I got out of the hospital, I got nonstop hallucinations and nightmares. My therapist told me it was my PTSD or survivor’s guilt. But for some reason, I feel like it was something different, something that is right in front of me but I just can't point out what it is.\n\nThe door opened.\n\n“Hey...” Anthony opened the door “Get in, it’s kind of cold out here.”\n\n“Thanks.” I walked inside his house where he lives alone.\n\nAfter the accident, we both decided to get away from the people around us to get some time alone, we didn't want to feel sympathy from people who don’t know what happened and how it felt like. Although therapy was a must. Both of our parents forced us into therapy to treat whatever effect it might have left us. I rented out a room in an old apartment and Anthony lived in his uncle’s home, who now stayed over at his parent’s house.\n\n“Thanks for coming over. It gets kind of lonely. And talking to other people who didn’t experience it you know how it feels.” Anthony looked at the floor and said.\n\n“Yeah…it does get kinda old. Come on, let’s go to sleep, it’s not close to morning yet. Besides no need to thank me, being here might help me get a good sleep for the first time in months too.” I smiled slightly.\n\n\nHe guided me to his room and when I first entered it, there was a slight chill running down my spine, like someone was breathing down my neck. But at the same time, I can feel a heavy amount of sorrow in the room. I stayed silent, trying to ignore it.\n\n\nI looked at Anthony who was at the lockers grabbing a spare pillow and blanket.\n\n“Hey, you can take the bed. I’ll be fine on the floor.” I expressed.\n\n“It’s fine, I’m glad you’re here so you can take the bed as a thank.”\n\n“No, it is a good thing for me too. If I ever have a nightmare I would know that you are here so it’s an even a bigger thing you are doing for me.”\n\nHe stayed silent for a while then sighed “If that’s what you want then I guess I can’t stop you.”\n\nAfter I got my blanket and pillow, I lay on the floor and Anthony hopped on the bed. We both didn’t speak to each other but we both knew that deep down we were happy because the other person is there.\n\nI was the first one to speak.\n\n“Remember when we first met?” \n\n“I do. It’s one of the highlights in my life up until now.”\n\n“You were the quiet kid, never really stood out. Honestly, I didn’t even notice you for the first few months. I think I talked to you first because one of the teachers said you could use some friends.” \n\n“And you were the opposite of me, the one who is outgoing and easy to make friends with. I never expected to talk with anyone because no one ever talked to me when I was at my old schools.”\n\nI laughed a small bit “Although I can talk with anyone, you were really hard for me to make friends. It was because you didn't even talk much. That's why I asked everyone else to talk with you.”\n\n“...I’m sorry...everyone did so much for me yet I didn't open up until our very last year. I'm grateful because of you and because of them. I really wish I was a better person, I really love everyone.”\n\n“...Me too...I can still remember Sarah’s voice telling me how I was funny every time I said a joke.”\n\nI continued mentioning our old friends and before I realized it, Anthony already fell asleep. And not long after, I did too.\n\nAs I close my eyes, someone whispered into my ears “You’re funny.” and placed their hands over my eyes and mouth. I tried to scream but I couldn't, I tried to struggle my way out but it was no use too, hands were all over my body, holding me down and sinking me into the floor.\n\nI woke up sweaty on the floor. It was another nightmare but this time, it was more real than any other nightmares I had. Am I going insane? \n\nA new day has begun and all I want is for it all to stop soon.",

        "text": "[With Aaron gone](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/114ckwe/i_had_a_house_that_eats_the_dead_i_wasnt_the/), money quickly became an issue. Looking over my finances, the banker was incredulous that I’d ever gotten a mortgage. After all, I was just a single mom with no discernable income. \n\n“Two pieces of advice,” he told me. “First, get a job. Any job. Second, either sell that house or start renting out rooms. Otherwise, this bank will end up auctioning it to the highest bidder.”\n\nThe job part was hard. I’d been three years into a degree when I married Aaron, and I’d never exactly finished school thanks to Derek coming along. Plus, even with two kids in school, finding any place that would let me get off by 2:30 for school pickups would be just about impossible.\n\nRenting out a room also had its challenges, but they seemed more manageable. \n\nThe house had a spare bedroom with an ensuite bathroom on the ground floor near the back. It was fairly separate from the rest of the living quarters. I figured it would be easy enough to rent out for a few nights at a time. I had a locked door installed in the connecting hallway, such that the room was completely isolated from the rest of the residence.\n\nThen, I simply put up a listing with a price that seemed obscenely high. I was fully booked within hours.\n\nMaybe I’d been naive, thinking that the house had a new energy now, one that would attract the right kind of people. I couldn’t have been more wrong. \n\nThe first guest claimed to be a dentist in town for a convention, but nothing added up. First, I’d never seen a dentist with dirty fingernails before. Second, his suitcase stunk like death, though he’d clearly doused whatever was inside with a generous spritz of bad cologne.\n\nWithin five seconds of meeting him, I was reconsidering the entire enterprise. As I handed him the keys to the back unit, he couldn’t take my eyes off my chest.\n\n“What a lovely sweater,” he said softly. “Real wool. You can always tell the real thing.”\n\nIt was one of the few pieces of clothing the house hadn’t eaten.\n\n“Thanks,” I said, trying to drop the key in his hand without touching him. “Enjoy your stay.”\n\n“Oh, I’m sure I will,” he said. “The house is a true specimen. A true specimen indeed.”\n\nThe man took his time settling into his room. I couldn’t see what he was up to, but I could certainly here him knocking around. Occasionally, he laughed out of nowhere. I hoped he was on the phone to a funny friend, but it seemed more likely he was lost in thought, contemplating something dark. I wondered how it would feel to go to sleep that night, knowing he shared a roof with my children.\n\nThen, around dinner time, the man left. I waited until his car pulled away and then entered his room. Of course, I knew I shouldn’t, but I couldn’t resist. Strangely, he hadn’t unpacked at all. The bed was still made, even the toilet paper was still neatly folded with a triangle at the end. The only evidence that he was there at all was his suitcase sitting unopened on the folding luggage rack.\n\nAt that point, I figured I’d come that far. I had to know what was inside. Quick as I could, I strode over to the suitcase and opened it. I gagged as it sprung open, the odor of death washing over me. I had become so used to the house’s unnatural cleanliness, that the suitcase’s contents hit me harder than I could have expected:\n\nInside were dead animals, all crammed together like melted marshmallows, filling every square inch of the suitcase. No breed or species had been ignored. I saw a small dog, a squirrel, a dead lizard, even a possum. \n\nThis wasn’t the work of some careful taxidermist. The animals were still bloody, some crawling with maggots. Others were so rotted that they almost seemed to blur together with their neighbors, making it impossible to tell where one ended and the next began.\n\n“You’re not eating them,” I whispered to the house. “Why? Trying to avoid revealing yourself to him?”\n\nThe house didn’t answer. I didn’t have to. I could sense its fear.\n\nI’m not sure how long I stood there looking at the mess, but at some point, I heard keys jangling at the exterior door. Perhaps he’d forgotten something. \n\nI closed the suitcase as quick as I could, hurrying to reset the clasps. Panic surged through me as I imagined other suitcases, filled with me, with Derek, with Grace, our bodies severed and mingled like the animals.\n\nFinally, I got the clasp back in place. \n\nJust as the exterior door opened, I speedwalked back to inside door of the main house and quietly closed it behind me. I was breathing so hard by that point I thought I was going to pass out. As I reached the living room, I bumped into Grace, who looked at me with scared eyes.\n\n“Is there a bad man staying with us?” she asked.\n\n“Yes,” I answered.\n\n“Are you going to make him go away?”\n\nI put my head in my hands. “I don’t know.”\n\nThat night, the man’s snores filled the house. They were almost inhumanly loud, as if a hibernating bear had taken up residence downstairs. \n\nAfter I put the kids to sleep, I stepped out onto the front porch. For the first time in almost a decade, I craved cigarettes. There on the porch sat Pamela’s urn. I still hadn’t mustered the courage to bring it inside the house. Maybe I never would. After making Carter disappear, I’d promised myself I’d never feed it another person. \n\nOf course, I’d already broken that promise once.\n\n“What am I supposed to do?” I asked the urn. “Grab a knife from the kitchen. Sneak into his room and stab it in his throat. What if I miss? Is it my job to erase every creep who sleeps here?”\n\nThe urn said nothing. I lingered for a while there, watching the clear, uncaring stars. Then I went to sleep.\n\nThe next morning, I awoke to the sound of screaming. Out on the street, my neighbor Roopa was standing over some kind of bloody carcass in the street. When I ran out to her, a chill ran through me. It was her beloved calico cat, Otto, minus his head.\n\n“Who would do this?” she asked through tears. “What kind of person would do this?”\n\n“When did this happen?” I asked.\n\nShe shook her head. “It must have been early this morning. I didn’t let him out until at least midnight.”\n\nI managed to hold in my sobs until I reached the house, but I broke the minute I walked inside. Derek was right there, and he ran up, throwing his arms around me.\n\n“What happened?” he asked. “What happened?”\n\n“I need you and Claire to go stay with Aunt Amy for a little while,” I said. “Everything will be okay. But there’s something I need to take care of.”\n\nA few hours later, I saw the man walking to his car. His suitcase seemed just a little bit heavier as he wheeled it to his car. He gave me a small wave.\n\n“How did you enjoy your stay?” I asked quietly.\n\n“Oh, better than I could have imagined,” he said. “I’ll certainly be telling all of my friends and acquaintances about it.”\n\nFor a second, I turned, ready to retreat, to let him leave. But something in me couldn’t let that happen.\n\n“One last thing,” I said after a few seconds. “We should do a final walkthrough together. Just to make sure there were no damages–or anything that would incur an additional cleaning fee.”\n\n“Is that part of the regular procedure?” he asked, curious.\n\n“I can do it myself if you like,” I said. “If you’re eager to get on the road, that is.”\n\nThe man took one more look at the house and smiled.\n\n“I wouldn’t mind a few more minutes inside,” he said.\n\nAn hour later, I sat on the stairs to the basement, watching the hot spot devour the last of the man’s body. Next to him lay his obscene suitcase, now licked free of its contents. The next time I saw Roopa, she’d have no recollection Otto had ever existed. The same was true for the rest of the pets’ owners. I hoped that was a kindness.\n\nThe man hadn’t put up much of a fight, ultimately. I’d asked him to bend down to examine an imaginary stain. Then I’d plunged a kitchen knife in his back. I hadn’t hesitated for a moment. It had been easy.\n\nPerhaps Pamela’s letter had inspired me. And maybe that had been the point all along. Some people needed to be put down, erased. Maybe that’s why places like this house existed. Maybe death wasn’t enough for the worst people in the world.\n\nPamela had done enough now. I saw that. She had sent the letter and set me on my course. And if she, too, wanted to join the erased, who was I to stop her?\n\nBefore I could reconsider, I grabbed her ashes from the front porch and took them inside, fling them all through the house. The glittered in the air like falling snow, disappearing before they even hit the floor, slurped into the gray void that was the house’s stomach.\n\nAnd for the first time, I saw the house for what it truly was. Not evil unto itself at all, but a vortex for evil, a wasp trap filled with some kind of irresistible nectar. \n\nAll it had ever needed was some kind of poison inside.\n\nAnd as I watched the last of Pamela’s ashes fade into nothing, I knew I would never let another evil man leave my house alive again. \n\n[I would be the poison.](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarymaxx/comments/zwo5o8/welcome_to_the_world_of_scarymaxx/)",

        "text": "\n\tI'm not sure how far this thing has spread. If you're reading this, close your windows, shut off any displays you have, and honestly, once you're done here, get the hell off of the internet. It is not worth the risk. I'm one of the lucky ones.\n\tThe day started normal. I had the graveyard shift at the corner store. My shift ended at around 7:30 a.m. and I waited a little longer for the next guy to arrive. He didn't show up so I just left. It's the weekend, so parents with good jobs and all the kids off from school were in the streets, doing their thing. I was walking across the street from an electronics store, one of those classic looking ones with the T.V.s in the window. Anyways, the clock hit 8 and all hell broke loose. Suddenly all the T.V.s in that store, probably all the T.V.s across the country based on what happened, lit up with this... image. Can't get that shit out of my head, but I guess that's the point.\n\tIt was a man, I guess. Just staring. But he didn't have a nose. And his eyes and his mouth were a little bigger, just enough to have something be noticeably off. And his smile. It was a sickeningly wide grin full with white teeth. He just stood there on a grey background, staring out of all those monitors. I don't know if it was a video or just a picture, but he didn't move. It was only there for a few seconds. I froze in total fear, but other than that I was fine, unlike those around me. Everyone that saw it started having their faces contort. They yelled in sharp pain before they froze in perfect posture while they grumbled and had their faces rearranged. They all started to look like that guy on T.V. Everyone who saw them turned, and the people who saw those people turned, and so on and so on. Sharp, panicked screams cut off instantly and gave rise to a dumb, frozen statue with an ugly alien grin. Goes without saying anyone driving a car lost control. I dove into an alley and watched the carnage unfold. \n\tThe ones that turned seemed to try to find people that didn't yet and stare at them. It spread like wildfire. My heart was beating a million times a minute and I couldn't control my breath. It was that same fear you feel in a nightmare, the one that takes over your whole body and makes your head feel distant and frozen. I felt in a sort of primal danger. I stopped watching and hid behind a dumpster, eyes shut and hyperventilating.\n\tI hid there in that alleyway for what seemed like ages. I kept hearing distant screams, screeching brakes, rumbling explosions. Pretty sure I heard a plane or two falling out of the sky, and some useless emergency alerts from an unfortunate person's phone. Once I had gathered the courage, or moreso the want to progress my nightmare until I hopefully woke up, I peeked out from behind the dumpster I had called my home for the past ten minutes. Before I even moved, I felt like I was being watched.\n\tDown the alley and across the street, there was just one of them. Staring straight at me, smiling like an idiot. It's big eyes were relaxed but contorted from the giant, toothy smile plastered on it's face. I froze and my hair rose like a cat. Why wasn't I turning? Was it going to happen soon?\n\tWe just kept staring at eachother, our contest framed by smoking cars and broken spouting water pipes. I knew it knew I was there. I felt that gaze in my soul. It blinked, oddly enough, but that didn't really make it any more friendly looking.\n\tThen it kept blinking. Faster, and faster, and faster. It's face twitched slightly, the smile not affected in the slightest. Then it twitched more, and more, and more, and then its body twitched, and then it started grumbling, and its body twitched even more, and then it started screaming, and then it was running at me on all fours. Still smiling.\n\tI screamed in response and ran like hell. I turned into a back alley behind some apartments and kept running, looking for any sort of place to head into. Not afraid to say how fucking afraid I was of this thing. I'm pretty sure I soiled my pants twelve times over knowing this thing was on my tail.\n\tI kept hearing it screaming behind me. It sounded angry, and only loosely human. I'm pretty sure the tears in my eyes were the reason I didn't see the brick wall I had just corned myself in front of.\n\tI whipped around and fell to the ground, backing up against the wall. That thing was still galloping towards me. It was as if some sort of inhuman thing was controlling a human body. It had no idea how to use it.\n\tBy this point I was sobbing and wailing out loud. It slowed on it's approach and stumbled towards me before straightening into an erect position. Then it stared again, hoping to turn me into one of itself.\n\tI think I was doing one of those sobbing smiles, the ones where you're obviously not happy but your mouth, at the very least, resembles a smile on the surface. I guess that's what saved me. It kinda just turned around and walked off all robotic like, making sure to get in one last stare but before turning back down the alley into the main street. I was still there sobbing, wondering what the hell just happened.\n\tSo that's how all this shit started. I somehow got back to my apartment unscathed and charged my phone back to life while the world fell apart around me. My phone read 8:30 am. Only half an hour had passed since that smile came on screen. I wanted to write this in a hurry as a warning / last mark on earth, especially since, knowing the nature of humans, I bet that smile made it onto the internet - accidentally or deliberately.\n\tI live in a small city out in the midwest, so maybe it might take a day or two to really start spreading, or maybe the government did this all as a test run and we're in a controlled space, or maybe I'm stuck in a hellish nightmare-- anyways. Get the hell off the internet or browse carefully. I'm lucky to be \"immune\" I guess. Maybe smiling back at those things will save you if you aren't, but I'd say just avoid seeing them all together, immune or not. That face haunts me every time I close my eyes.\n\tSo again, close your windows, shut off any displays you have, and get off the internet. You never know when or where you'll see that picture. And if you still happen to encounter one of those things without departing into a nightmare reality, just smile.",

        "text": "\n\n  Lights flash and I feel the music pound through my entire body. Exhilaration courses through my veins and I look over to see my friends with their eyes closed living and soaking up every moment. I hadn’t planned on it being this much fun. \n I was a little nervous about going out clubbing for the first time but they assured me it’d be worth it, never expected them to be so right! \n  The crowd swings and sways to every beat and the alcohol in my blood is starting to hit me like a semi. I decide to let lose too. I hold on to my buddies and jump to every boom with them. I see them laugh and couldn’t quite make out what they say but I know they’re having fun. I am too. Kenneth grabs my arm and lugs me over to the bar, maybe this is the one too many. Oh well. We wait and grab the bartenders attention and get a couple more shots of whatever “Alien Nipple” is. Who cares? Good name, good drink when you’re already 5 in the hole. \n\nGulp \n\nThe first few sips of 6 go down a little easier than they probably should. I finish it in record time because I see George on the floor ready for round two of what we certainly think is decent dancing. \n\nA new song kicks up, the bass slams every inch of my mind as continue to lose touch of the here and now and float into obscurity. \nMagical. Astounding. Thrilling. The crowd a blurred mass of drunks and dopes. All of us here looking for the same release of blissful nothingness. The next song feels even better than the last and I spin while dropping whatever part of me feels hot. Okay. Maybe cutting back, I open my eyes and… crap. Where’d they go? “GEORGE? LOST YOU?” I try to yell over what was never going to be drowned out with my flawed voice. “Ran outside for some air” I think. “I’d actually like the same” so I head in the direction of the exit. Look back to see if they were just caught in the crowd. \n\nBump. \n\n“Sorry man” I saw him say. \n\n“You’re good” I mumble \n\nContinue my journey out. \n\nCold waves sweep over my drunken skin as I hit the cities electric night air. \n\nNot seeing my buddies though. My addled mind thinks “hey we were going to another scene, maybe they just forgot to grab me before heading out… I think it’s this way?” \n\nTrudging through the muddled sidewalk I notice a half stride that for some reason felt eerily similar to mine. I look back and he turns away looking to probably anything else of interest, I’m the creep for looking back at him after all. “Keep going” my sullied brain says. Nothings off. But paranoia ended up slapping me hard. “Was he following me?” That little thought I decided to just keep at bay. Just walking a little faster to where my friends may be. I notice that other pace pick up too. “Should’ve stayed in the club. Why’d I just decide to head out?” Woulda shoulda coulda of a tipsy head. Felt paranoia decide to play a solo on nerve endings. I bolt in the direction back towards the club and… shit. He’s definitely running after me. Why doesn’t anyone else think this is weird? I panic as I’m sprinting back towards the lit club entrance. Felt a couple more steps smash the pavement behind me. Looking for a way to lose my newly found admirer I run into an alley that looked like I could find something to hide in or behind to lose this madman. Dead end. Nothing to leap over. Nothing to hide in. No one to call over for help. Just a few stories of brick, mortar and my inner voices screaming at me to get away. I feel another smashing step behind me and turn to confront this creep. I see a mask moving but can’t make out the words without seeing his lips. Obviously they don’t know I can’t hear whatever these ghost threats are. I feel the cold edge sink into my side and I think about how I wish my voice could reach the passerby’s in the faint light outside the alley. I wish I hadn’t taken another step into that club.",

        "text": "Perhaps you’ve heard of me.  For privacy reasons, I won’t tell you my name, but you can rest assured I am who I claim to be.\n\nMy life has been one of privilege and success, though it has come at a cost.  Don’t cry for me, just know that the glitz and glamour of Hollywood is an elaborate charade, a gilded turd.  Behind the tuxedos and champagne, beneath the sports cars and awards, and hidden beyond the crawling eye of ceaseless criticism, one may find the real Hollywood.  Show business is a business, and make no mistake: the only rule is you can do whatever you want, as long as your product is profitable.  At least, that used to be the only rule.\n\nI pride myself on being something of a renaissance man, but my acting is not rooted in some silly “method formula” that only serves to drive the cast and crew crazy.  Don’t get me wrong, when the camera is rolling, I will go all-out.  I’ll put myself in incredible discomfort for realism, but when the action is cut, I’m the kind of guy you’d enjoy having a beer with.  Provided, of course, you could get the elevator to take you to my floor at the resort, past the security checkpoint, and then into one of my private suites.  \n\nOver the years, I’ve learned it’s important to have one suite for entertaining, and one for my personal space.  Some people simply will not leave once they get past that final door, as if they think they’ll never get another chance to be this close to me again.  They’ll pitch their tired ideas of a tepid meet-cute romance or self-aware sendup of some cliche.  Honestly, it’s exhausting – most of the time I don’t get the appeal, so I tell them to contact my agent to vet the proposal (which all but ensures I will never hear from them or about their sad little premise).  Eventually, I slip out and over to my personal suite for some time to myself.\n\nI don’t let a lot of people into my personal space.  My assistant, my agent, my stylist, my publicist, my trainer, my masseuse, my head of security, and most importantly, my attorney (who makes the others sign airtight NDAs).  Occasionally, my doctor will make a house call if I need a medication delivery or adjustment.  Or my therapist, when the pills won’t cut it.  What I’m getting at is these people who get private access to me are the ones I’m paying, who provide a service the public can’t see.  The public, the unwashed masses who hand over their money for entertainment.  A brief reprieve from their desperately meaningless lives.  They can’t see it takes an entire retinue to bring their favorite performers to the screen.  Part of the appeal is not knowing how the sausage is made, which means they get to think they’re only one lucky break away from becoming famous themselves, having their own meet-cute with me at a cafe in Burbank, getting a deal with a top producer for a blockbuster action flick.  Retinue is French, by the way.  I learned that for one of my roles.\n\nThe public is fickle, moreso these days.  Their voices are brought together and amplified by social media.  It’s amazing the pressure they can bring.  Sometimes a show gets brought back from the dust bin, or a fading franchise gets a sequel greenlit.  And sometimes, the public can do something bad, like force studios to change or pull shows that are “insensitive” or “hurtful”.  Even worse, they can ruin someone’s career.  That’s the fear most celebrities have these days, of being canceled over some nonsense like making a funny racially-themed joke (without even necessarily being a racist) or not fully supporting the woke mob’s *cause du jour*.  The outrage machine moves on eventually, and as long as one keeps bringing in the box office returns, anything’s absolved.  Or so I thought.\n\nYou see, that’s where the trouble began.  The public, who know nothing about how hard it is to do what I do, have decided to make an issue out of my choice of companionship.  I’m a busy man.  I don’t have time for a family, and I’m not ready to settle down.  I refuse to apologize for enjoying the vitality of beautiful girls whose energy and ambition match my own.  If it should happen that sometimes those relationships don’t work out past a certain point, can I really be blamed for seeking out a new love interest?  Honestly, it’s baffling.  In my performances, I share the screen with a new actress for every film.  How is my private life so different?\n\nMy agent and my publicist, the bastards.  They teamed up on me, and forced me to agree to date a woman that would hopefully put the rabble rousers to rest.  I spoke in broad strokes about the qualities I’d be most interested in for a partner, which endowments were most crucial.  They brainstormed on a list, and came back to me a few days later with a series of photos (including recent headshots) and brief biographies that I didn’t bother reading.  I looked through the photos and picked one I could tolerate for a few months.  They arranged to have her discreetly delivered to my private suite for a test drive before I’d have to be seen with her in public.  Never lease a car without a test drive.  Trust me, I know from experience.\n\nMy attorney worked with hers on the contract.  We signed, and set the date for a Wednesday evening.  It was during principal photography for one of my upcoming projects, so the plan was to have her secreted through the loading dock and into the resort, then brought to my floor via the service elevators.  That way, the paparazzi would have no clue she was there.  When the test drive was over, she’d be brought out the same way.  My security team would make sure the closed-circuit cameras were turned off in and around the resort, and they’d clear both her entrance and egress.  If everything went swimmingly, we’d officially meet at a charity event in a few weeks.  Then we’d date for a while, do a few red carpet events, and in between, I’d get to see if her carpet matched the drapes.  That’s a bit of artistic license as the next contract would also stipulate she maintain hardwood floors.  Waxed and polished, smooth as glass.\n\nOn the day she was to be brought to me, I was pretty wound up from filming an intense scene, so when I got to my suite, I took a French shower and popped a couple of benzos, which I washed down with a bit of bubbly.  I was waiting in the bedroom when I heard a perfunctory knock on the door.  As she entered the living space, I gave her some time to get uncomfortable before I stepped into the room.  \n\nI wish I had never opened the door.  I was facing some sort of grotesque monster, an undead creature brought back from the decay of the crypt.  This had to be a prank courtesy of practical effects and prosthetics.  It had to be.  Despite my depleted energy and drugged state, my heart raced as my mind flooded with fear.  What was this unsightly unliving corpse, this mummy from beyond the grave?  Could it be real?\n\nI tried to force myself to run back to the bedroom, but I was frozen with terror.  The monster flashed a hideous grin while reaching behind itself to throw the latch and lock us inside.  Alone.  Together.  I struggled to breathe.\n\n“Hello, [Redacted].  I’ve wanted to meet you for years.  Are you as excited as I am?”  Every word it spoke was coughed through its ancient mouth, and while its outer coat of makeup was flawlessly applied, I could see well enough it was covering a patchwork of atrocious flesh, rotted and wrinkled.  I fought the urge to vomit.  Despite being known as a suspected atheist, I prayed to wake from this nightmare.\n\n“What’s the matter, hon?  Tongue tied?  I wasn’t sure I’d be your type, but I didn’t expect to leave you speechless.”  The creature walked toward me in some mockery of seduction, swaying hips that were disgustingly wider than the photos had implied.  Sweet Jesus, let that be padding for the prank.  I couldn’t imagine caressing those emulsified bags of spoiled cottage cheese.\n\nMy knees buckled and I grabbed the table to steady myself.  The monster rushed toward me and I caught a whiff of nostalgic revulsion.  When it died, the priests must have perfumed the corpse with an ancient bottle from Jean Paul Gaultier.  It touched me lightly on the shoulder, and I found myself almost reaching for the resort telephone to beg for help.  I sobbed lightly as I realized I was trapped.  Nobody could know it was here, nobody could hear my desperation.  This was irrevocable, contractual.  I had to find a way to survive the next several hours.\n\nIt steered me toward the settee.  I was powerless to resist, crippled with terror and on the verge of fainting.  I thought it would kill me then to steal my life essence and prolong its unnatural existence.  Instead, it talked, which was somehow worse.  I could barely bring myself to listen, even as it discussed my craft.\n\n“I know you hear this all the time, but I absolutely loved you in *[Redacted]*.  My parents wouldn’t let me watch it in the theaters, but one of my friends in middle school got a copy of it and we would watch it when I slept over.  We watched it so much we wore out the tape player.  You were absolutely fabulous, every girl’s dream.”  It was sitting next to me, almost touching me with those dreadful fingers.  Despite my terror, I couldn’t help myself.  I spoke to it.\n\n“What do you mean, tape player?” I asked.\n\n“Don’t be silly, sugar.  You know, how we used to watch movies before DVDs.”  Middle school.  VHS.  Oh, God!  I started doing the math in my head.  This was impossible, no reanimated corpse could possibly survive that long without some sort of supernatural intervention.  I realized it intended to snuff me out that very night, but it was toying with me, extending the suspense for a cheap thrill.\n\n“You know,” it said, “thanks to streaming services, I don’t keep any video players in our family room.”  I realized what it was about to say, and I knew it was now or never to launch my escape.  If I could lock myself in the bedroom without it clawing its way in, I could ride out the evening with a chair blocking the door and my hand cradling the telephone, just in case.  I would dial 911 if I had to, fake a medical emergency.  Fake?  What fake?  This was a real emergency.\n\nIt smiled and laughed, a cackling caw befitting its deepened crow’s feet.  It touched my shoulder in a replica of playful flirtation.  “My kids don’t even know what a DVD is.”\n\nI screamed, and I jumped to rush toward the bedroom, but I tripped over the edge of the davenport and lost consciousness when I hit the floor.\n\nI awoke in my bed some time later.  The monster was nowhere in sight.  My assistant had let herself into the suite and brought over my coffee, which I sipped while trying to recall the rest of the night’s events.\n\nTo my horror, I looked over and saw a depressed creasing of the sheets on the other side of the bed.  My assistant raised an eyebrow at me while passing a phone.  It was my publicist on the other end, and he was positively beaming.\n\n“Great work, old sport.  I knew you could do it!  Let’s hammer out the details for the official meeting this morning.  I know I don’t have to tell you this, but you really needed this thing to get airborne.  I’m glad you powered through and left her satisfied.”\n\nI put the phone down in a daze and washed my face in the bathroom sink.  When I looked up, I was jolted with the realization I had noticeably aged.  That undead bitch had stolen some of my lifeforce, and now I was supposed to commit to a public relationship with it?\n\nI don’t think I’m going to survive this.

I don't drink booze to more than a light buzz most of the time and have only blacked out oncez early in my teens, I dont really meas with weed, and avoid hallucinogens. \n\nDeserts are inherently kinda otherwordly places, even if you call one home. Dunes in particular are very odd. I know of only a few places where you can find them in my part of the world. The northernmost are the Kilpecker Dunes in the Red Desert of southern Wyoming, then to the south, Great Sand Dunes National Park in Colorado, and further south yet are the dunes in White Sands National Park. Maybe there are others, but these are the ones I've been to, many times. They are some of the few places where i feel reasonably comfortable practicing firecraft in dry seasons, they are an amazing place to learn about what you can and cant do without, and to practice more esoteric bushcraft and survival skills. These three locations are also, by amazing coincidence, where these stories take place. I'll start here with the one I've been to the most. \n\nI grew up in a high desert. They are unforgiving by their very nature, but if you can take what they throw at you they are full of a surprising amount of life and beauty. The forests and mountains may be my sanctuary, but I fear in my heart that I am ultimately a desert creature, and the dry wind that steals away warmth and moisture also calls me home. I love the desert and the winds that allow nothing spare. I love the rocky creek beds where the bones of the fish that once gave them life blew into dust centuries ago. I love the rocky outcrops rotted away to globular non-forms by wind and ice. The desert is my home. \n\nMuch like any other home, once you get used to its little tells, a sense of a place forms within you. You know when you're alone in it, when a cherished knickknack has been moved, a foor left open. Sometimes the echoes of a missing familiar sound can whisper a warning, a slight sense of offness.\n\nSometimes though, they can scream.\n\nThe dunes of the Red Desert are not easy to get to, and depending on which part you are in, entry can be of dubious legality.  I, of course, *of course,* would never advise going where you aren't allowed, and certainly never have in my hastier, less cautious youth. No sir.\n\nI had been many times, and I tried to avoid camping or tooling around out there in the same spot. Alcohol was usually hauled out, water always was, and usually some lightweight means of defending oneself, but there isnt exaclty a plethora of prey animals to feed a huge predatory population, so its not really all that necessary. Somewhere around a decade ago, maybe more, maybe less, I took something of an on-again, off-again girlfriend of mine out to the red dunes, hopefully for a a night of fun, if not outright debauchery. The pretense, which she later happily confirmed was pretense for her as well, was that we were there to practice air-based water collecting techniques and fire craft. I've never been much of a smooth talker, but what can I say, hope springs eternal. \n\nI wont use any real names, but I'll refer to her by the trait I most associate with her, so let's call her Grace.\n\nIt was a drive and a half, but eventually we got there, and in relative comfort. Like many young women in the mountain west, parental worries of their daughters being stranded somewhere by buying them overbuilt SUV's with AWD and enough creature comforts to make you feel like you never left home at all. As they have the gas efficiency of a derrick fire, and Grace was nothing if not practical, she had yanked out half the seats and turned the inside into huge cargo space, including a secondary gas tank. I understand that this is not necessarily safe if done by an amateur and is typically outside of the cab in a truck bed, but whatever. Not my vehicle. Anyway, this was good, as we burned a lot of gas to get out there, and the AWD was very handy.\n\nWe got there around the hottest part of the day, which in the early fall isnt so bad, and hiked out to where we wanted to set up camp. I had on occasion read about then before, and decided to attempt a travois with a couple of poles i had brought for the purpose. For the time expenditure of around 20 minutes of set up and the purpose of dragging shit along the sand, I gotta say, not bad. I was able to haul all of out bullshit out by myself around three, three and a half miles from where we parked. The dunes cover a truly huge space, and my favorite parts are of course the hardest to get to, as they tend to be the farthest from the atvers. I dont have an issue with them necessarily, but I like the dunes best when its quiet enough to hear them sing. I dont understand it well enough to explain it, youll have to look it up. They are what are known as living dunes, and they make a noise folks call singing. \n\nOf course, as a younger man trying, in a self-awarely stupid fashion, to impress my date with my muscles and trying to maintain a lively conversation without revealing how winded I was (don't judge, walking on shifting sands is *hard*) I wasnt listening for the singing of sand, but trying to catch what Grace was saying over the wind. This story isnt about that part anyway, but I can say, even with something of a bittersweet taste in my mouth now, that it was a pleasant time with a person I once loved, and I wouldnt have traded it for the world. \n\nWe set up our camp in the nook between a few dunes, erecting a virginal handmade tent of Grace's design and manufacture with some difficulty and goodnatured swearing. It was pretty cool, a kimd of low wedge designed to be erected in high wind zones and remain warm. It had a dead air space built in, which was a pretty neat feature to my mind. Along with it, we discovered why a dakota fire pit doesnt work well on shifting sands which should have been obvious if either of us thought about it for more than a half second, and thoroughly chastised by the cruel dictates of basic physics, dug a regular fire pit like folks with functioning frontal lobes. We set up a few frames which held elevated tarps with stones in the middle over half buried buckets to attempt to collect dew as well. I showed her the basics, and Grace lit her first friction fire with a willow bow drill, a cottonwood baseboard and yucca stalk spindle (this is my go to combo in the western steppe, btw) in only a few tries.\n\nAs the predusk lightshow that decends every evening, known to the natives as \"Golden Hour\" (probably to everybody for all I know) rolled across the dunes and mountains of the red desert like so much maple syrup over harsh and unusually topographically variable pancakes, Grace and I were letting some stew cook over the fire while I showed her how to process yucca for fiber. \n\nWe had a very pleasant evening characterized by not enough stew and too much whiskey, and a song I wrote (very much not for her, except in the fact that it very much was) accompanied by one of those horrible little broom shaped traveling guitars. As is the way of the fortunes of all young dipshits trying to impress women who they should know have them dead to rights already, the B string broke halfway through. If you can't make the object of your affection swoon, making them laugh their asses off isnt a bad consolation prize. \n\nWe ended the night wrapped in a blanket by the fire, watching the moon rise and the stars do their gentle revolving dance around Polaris until I carried her, snoring like band saw, into her sleeping bag. I settled into mine and let the sound of the wind and the singing dunes carry me to sleep. \n\nAs an aside, folks who might still benefit from this advice: take time to remind yourself to remember moments like these as they happen. \nThey are gifts, and they should be treasured as such.\n\nI rested comfortably for a while, maybe an hour or two, before the whiskey reminded me of the debt I now owed it and I went to relieve myself.\n\nI was immediately taken aback by two things. One was the ludicrous brightness of the moon. Despite the residing in the \"Red\" Desert, the Kilpecker Dunes are infact a kind of creamy tan color, and on nights with a full moon, you might find darker conditions under a storm cloud in the middle of the day. The light seemed like it was pulsing a little, which I assume was probably more to do with dehydration and booze than the actual light sources. \n\nThe second thing, I noticed was the calm. Its almost always windy in Wyoming. It just is. I grew up there, walking to school in steady 40 mph winds. Calm does happen, but its usually a relative calm, like only 8 mph winds. This was still. Waking up to the calm is like waking up in a strange room you dont remember falling asleep in. Not inherently bad, per se, but disquieting and alien in a small but pervasive way.  I climbed up a nearby dune, because if I have to urinate, I may as well do so from a great height (the men reading this will understand) and because I wanted a good view of the surrounding area under its unusually well illuminated conditions. The only sound was my footsteps, my breath and the gentle hum of the dunes themselves. Not even an owl to be heard.\n\nAs i got to the top, a mountain came into view. Actually, several did.This isnt an unusal experience in the Rockies, as visibility can often be hundreds of miles in clear conditions and farther feom elevation. What was of note was that above the ones to the north of me there were flashes and flickers of light. Thunderstorm up north was my first thought, which would have been the safe bet. But I saw no clouds past them. I then noticed the ghostly colors of the lights and realized I was watching the Aurora Borealis, which i was hitherto unaware could be seen from that far South. I took a moment to relax and enjoy it, before scanning around me to see what other sights the moon would show me. \n\nIt was then that I spotted, down below me in a flatter area, what appeared to be many numerous 4 legged creatures. Cows, sheep, antelope, hell, even deer or elk wouldnt be that strange. I honestly couldnt tell you what they were, only that where were probably more than 20 and less than 50, more about that in a moment. But in the middle, I swore I saw an old school I-shit-you-not covered wagon. Not the pioneer kind, but the blockier, fully roofed shepherds hut on wheels that dotted Wyoming like freckles a hundred and twenty years ago. Folks think it was the cattle that built the West, but Wyoming first and foremost was built on sheep. However, whatever I was seeing, it was all back lit by the moon, so they were casting shadows from the side facing me. \n\nNow, I'll be honest with y'all, i don't have the absolutely clearest vision. It's not bad, better with glasses, but I don't usually bring them with me to throw a leak in the middle of the night.\n\nSo when I say the movement of these critters and the wagon looked strange, almost flickery, I expect you to take it with a grain of salt. I expect you to say it had something to do with the aurora or my eyes being tired, and those are all legit.\n\nThankfully I have really good hearing and olfactory perception. What my mediocre vision doesnt explain is why I was looking at something probably less than a mile away and I couldn't hear it on a still night. Wagons are noisy. They creak worse than boats, even when new. Livestock are noisy, and I'd find it odd to see a group that size with no bells around their necks. Nothing. Silence. \n\nFurthermore, why would you try to travel by night? It was bright, sure, but its not like thats a common practice, at least not according to anything I've ever heard. You want your critters together and easily defended from predators, thats what I understand. \n\nI watched them for a while, moving slowly across the ground almost like they were underwater. Slow enough I broke off a yucca stock and stuck it into the ground to mark the progress. Slow, but it was there. I stayed up there, watching the lights and the procession of shadows for a long time. \n\nEventually, I decided to whistle at them, the two fingers in the mouth super loud angry dad whistle. I heard it echo back at me, and then nothing. I yelled a loud, \"Hello!\" at them as well. Echo and nothing, again. Huh. No change in pace, no lights. I started to think the progress my be the moon moving across the sky and not whatever I thought it was. \n\n\nSo, I decided to go grab my binoculars, and try to wake up Grace to at least see the lights. It was a little treacherous descending but i made it in one piece. Camp was as i had left it, and i relaxed a little. I opened the tent flap and dug around a little, found my nocs but my attmepts to rouse my lady friend were unsuccessful. She was not having it. Not at all. She rolled over and went back to sleep, and chastised, I went back up to the top of the dune.\n\nIt took me a little longer this time, I was definitely feeling the climb by the time I got to the crest again.\n\nIt looked like a little progress had been made, according to my yucca stalk markers. Curious as hell I decided to use the binoculars to try to make out what I was looking at. \n\nI couldnt find the shadows in the binoculars. There are two possible influences on that, one being these were old binoculars and they had been stuck in maximum zoom since i had gotten them. The other would be it was in the wee hours of the morning and I had, several hours earlier imbibed some booze. \n\nBut try and try again, nothing. I couldnt get eyes on the critters or the wagon. Couldnt hear them, couldnt get a long distance look at them. What was I to do? \n\nI said fuck it, and went back to bed. Whatever i was looking at wasn't hurting me, it was just curious, and I had grown drowzy and cold lying on the cold sand.\n\nI narked the direction with one of the stalk segments, slid down the dune on my ass, and crawled back into the tent. \n\nAs I lay there, waiting for sleep in the warm and dark, I heard that gentle dune noise again, and the wind pick back up. My lullaby. Just as I was drifting off, though, I thought I heard a whistle echo across the sands but from very far away. I put it doen to my ears playing tricks on me, and when I next opened my eyes it was morning. \n\nProblem was, I was sitting next to the still crackling fire, not in the tent, and Grace was leaning against me as we sat wrapped in a blanket. \n\nI know, I know. \"Fuck you, this was just a dream, you dick!?\" I can hear you just fine. \n\nThere are a few problems with that hypothesis, though. One was, I put out the fire before going to bed. Im camping in a giant ashtray with a shovel in hand, it was effortless to put out and I remembered doing so very clearly. Another was that I was wearing shoes, which I hadmt done to go relieve myself and I hadnt done since we started the fire the night before, since I wanted a better grip on my baseboard to show Grace how to light a fire with a stick and bow. I have monkey feet, judge away. \n\nHere's another: I could see my footsteps up the dune and the trail from my impromptu derriere-sledding session. \n\nOokaaay. I woke Grace up, and she said that she thought we had slept in the tent. I concurred, and we sat there bleerily blinking at a fire we didn't remember building. I asked her to start the coffee, and climbed back up the dune, this time with my compass and my binoculars. My yucca fragments were there, and I got a heading, scoping out where I thought they were the night before. Still didnt see anything that would have made sense, so I headed back down once more on the Asscheek Express, and talked to my girlfriend about what I had seen. \n\nShe wasnt particularly freaked out by any of it, confidently told me i was still asleep or sleepwalking when I saw lights and the bizarre caravan. She was a little concerned by the lost time and not remembering getting up, but I think, to her credit as a reasonable person, she thought I was winding her up. I wasnt offended. \n\nI was, however, racked by curiosity. What the hell had happened? Im not a sleep walker as far as I know, and  I as I am now, writing this, have lost time before out in the wilderness but never before this incident. Was it just weird shadows? Had I been asleep? My markers were there, so I had been pretty lucid for a somnambulist. \n\nOne simple test I thought of would confirm or deny it. I decidd to throw on my boots and hike over to where I thought the trail should be by my best guess, while I let Grace do her morning routines. \n\nA short, brisk walk later, and i found nothing. No prints of any kind. This part wasn't as sandy as some others, so prints wouldnt have been everywhere, but there were none. Likelihood of sleep and booze fueled hallucinations increasing.  \n\nI did a fiarly thourpugh aearch of a few hundred yards in several directions, leabing my water bottle as a guide for where I thought it should be. No prints.\n\nI didnt give up. I trust my senses most of the time, and I'm stubborn. Also, I wasnt seeing anything that, given the angle of the moon, should have cast a shadow like that. Scrub, low brush. No trees, no boulders.\n\nI kept looking, first along the route I  thiught they would have cone from. No prints again. Something di catch my eye though. In a less sandy patch, I saw a long stretch of depressed clay. A rut, I realized, and some mild depressions in the rock here and there. A rut from a wheel made of something harder than modern tires, with a less gentle suspension. Now that I was looking for it, I saw more here and there. Headed to bisect the dunes, from one grassland to the next.\n\nJust an old, old trail from long ago. \n\nI don't know what any of that was. I easnt of sober or clear mind, although I was far from blackout drunk or sleep deprived. Grace got angry at me after a certain point of talking about it, so i stopped bringing it up. We finished out our outing. Our water collectors were successful in that they collected dew and unsuccessful in that it was about a cup and a half from the three of them together. We made a bolo out of some rocks and yucca cordage (premade, its a process and what we had made while we were there was minimal and strictly as a tutorial), we practiced atlatl skils, ruined some perfectly good flint in the attempt to make a pair of blades. We shared many good meals together. Still, overall, a very pleasant trip.\n\n After another couple of uneventful nights we headed home. I hadn't discussed it with anyone since really. I have no good explanation. \n\nI have however been out there again, and while I've never seen anything like that again, twice in my recollection I whistled at the top of the dunes before going to bed, and later that night, I was sure I heard one back. Probably just another camper. \n\nProbably.",

        "text": "Monday, February 6th 2023\n\nMy heart is beating. Am I really alive? Am I just a shell? Maybe I am just a real life zombie. If not, what else can explain all that emptiness? Something is broken inside me or rather something is missing.\n\nNothing enlightens my soul, not even that thing called love. Does it really exist? At least, there is a thrill I always wished I had the courage to try.\n\nAlone among over 7 billion people, I sat in a night club drowning my misery in a glass of whiskey. Soon, the impulses arose again, and I decided to leave at around 2 am before committing the worst.\n\nLet me just focus on the floor as I walk, let me not be tempted and just go home, I thought. However, as the saying goes, if you do not want to go to something, then that something comes to you.\n\n\"You should come and see that.\" The man said, standing in front of a tuck shop wall.\n\n\"What?\" I replied, puzzled and looking around, not sure he was talking to me.\n\n\"Come and see for yourself.\" The man spoke with his low and deep voice.\n\nI carefully approached and stood next to him, expecting to see something that would finally ignite something positive in my empty soul. The moment I saw what he stood there contemplating, I regretted approaching.\n\nFor various reasons ranging from advertising to announcement, many posters covered the wall, but the man had his entire attention captured by the ones displaying missing persons.\n\n\"Fascinating right? Three women in three weeks, or one per week.\" The man said with so much admiration that I looked at him with confusion.\n\n\"Fascinating? I said, watching him turn to me, his hair hidden in a beanie and his eyes hidden behind sunglasses during a winter night.\n\n\"No. You see this can work with everyone out there, but not with me.\" He said, still smiling. \"I don't need eyes to see, but I can see it in your eyes. Let it out my friend, let it out and free yourself.\"\n\nI did not say a word and started walking away. He just stood there watching me leave and smiling at me like the nutcase he is. What was I even doing outside? After all, I had classes to attend at college later.\n\n***\n\nMorning found me looking at the ceiling, something I had been doing for hours, my soul still tormented by last night's strange encounter. I was torn between good and evil as a raging battle ripped my soul apart.\n\n\"Should I finally give in to the temptation? Should I do it or not?\" I whispered. I ultimately chose to let my heart decide. I chose to let my heart guide me and tell me what to do. I decided to give in to the impulses.\n\nNo school today, I thought when I finally left my bed. First, let me get the material I needed. In no time, I found myself speeding through the shelves of a supermarket, powered by a long time forgotten feeling.\n\nSomething had just been launched, like a machine or rocket I could no longer stop no matter what.\n\nTuesday, February 7th 2023\n\nAs a second step, I spent literally a whole day monitoring an abandoned candy factory where I hoped that I would enjoy maximum privacy to create my first masterpiece.\n\nWednesday, February 8th 2023\n\nThe careful selection had to be the third step. I logged on the campus website to retrieve the complete list of students currently registered to the institution, and spent long hours looking for the ideal candidate despite already having her name in mind. Obviously, I ended up choosing her.\n\nThursday, February 9th 2023\n\nI intended to launch a three day observation period before action. I even considered making it several weeks long, but I could no longer hold myself as the impulses grew stronger by the minute. I needed to do it, and it had to be the day after.\n\nFriday, February 10th 2023\n\nToday is the day, I thought, while driving to the campus at around 3 pm. For a reason only her knew, she never agreed to be given a lift to her address and preferred the long walk to the bus station.\n\nHer usual behavior bore no consequences for my plan. I parked on the roadside and waited, just like a hunter ready to make a deadly move on its prey.\n\nAt around 5 pm, she appeared in the rear view mirror. Hazel, with her brown hair, glasses and headset. Not the social butterfly, always alone and minding her own business. I could not ask for someone better.\n\nFrom the glove box, I retrieved a chemistry book, a subject I knew we both study currently. I waited for her to walk next to the car before talking to her.\n\n\"Hazel?\" I called after rolling the window down.\n\n\"Austin?\" She replied with her very soft voice after removing her headset.\n\n\"Hey! How you doing? It's been a while.\" I said, getting out of the car, still holding the book.\n\n\"Yeah I mean, you've not been there for like, the whole week?\"\n\n\"Yeah I wasn't feeling good at all and there's this first chapter I really don't get.\" I said, showing her the book.\n\n\"Oh that? Relax dude it's only like the second week of the semester.\" She said between a few chuckles.\n\n\"Yeah but, I got all that pressure from my parents so, I really need some help.\"\n\n\"Okay so have you—\"\n\n\"Can you help me? Please?\" I cut her short, knowing she was about to direct me to the teacher.\n\n\"The Thing's that I really— can't right now I have to—\"\n\n\"No, no, no, not like right now but even on Monday during a break? If you don't mind? Please.\"\n\n\"Well, yeah cool. On Monday.\"\n\n\"Oh thank you so much.\"\n\n\"Okay so see—\"\n\n\"Do you— mind if I drop you off?\" I proposed, but she kept quiet, thinking and hesitating. \"Not at your home, like just there by the bus station? At least?\"\n\n\"Bus station, yeah. That's cool. Thanks.\"\n\nHazel walked to the passenger side and I prepared for the decisive next move. She got in and started looking for the seat belt, while I reached out for something behind her seat.\n\n\"So what were you doing around here if—\" She tried saying when I suddenly put my hand on her mouth and injected her in the neck with the content of the syringe I retrieved seconds earlier.\n\nI then seized her right arm to prevent her from opening the door and waited less than 5 seconds for the powerful sedative to kick in. I released my grip on her and she just looked at me completely terrified, slowly fainting while trying to say something:\n\n\"Please don't let— he will k— he will— he will—\"\n\n***\n\nThere was no going back from that. I had to do what I had to do. After the little adrenalin rush from the action in the car, I had driven to the abandoned candy factory where the real deal was set to happen.\n\nHands and feet tied, Hazel lied unconscious on a table, while I prepared every tool I needed to let my impulses finally run wild and free on that innocent soul.\n\n\"Amateur.\" I heard from a deep male voice echoing in the silence of the factory.\n\n\"Who's there?\" I asked, looking around with my nail gun already in hand. \"Who the fuck is—\" I stopped when I saw Hazel sitting on the table with her eyes still closed.\n\n\"I have to admit that I'm very, very disappointed in you Austin. A nail gun? Really?\" I heard the deep male voice say, however, it was coming from Hazel's mouth and it sounded very familiar.\n\n\"What? What the—\"\n\n\"Grown-up things aren't for brats. Kiddo.\" She said, using a herculean force to tear the buff tape and free her hands and feet at the same time.\n\nI shot her with the nail gun but she caught the projectile with her hand while her eyes were still shut. I tried a second, then a third and a fourth time, yet she was able to catch all the nails, no matter the distance.\n\n\"I told you Austin, I don't need eyes to see.\" She spoke.\n\nThe words rang a loud bell in my mind. I had already heard it before, the previous Monday, from that strange man after the nightclub. Still, I could not comprehend why Hazel spoke like him.\n\nHazel then dropped all the nails she caught except for one that she yeeted straight to my thigh. It tore through the flesh and exited on the other side. I fell on the floor screaming in pain, turned and started crawling away from a prey that turned into a hunter.\n\nShe sauntered behind me, her eyes still closed, but following me calmly. I had no idea what to do for something so unexpected and crawled helplessly not knowing if each effort made would be the last.\n\n\"Quite unexpected, right? Well, Hazel and I share this little body. She's in charge when she's awake and I'm in charge when she sleeps. Only five hours a day, but with what you gave her, I think I'll have extra hours today. The disguise though, that's the part I don't like.\" He, she or whoever that freaking demon was, explained.\n\n\"HELP! HEEELP!\" I shouted in despair.\n\n\"I could see you all this time you know. She can't because she's so gullible but me... During classes, at the library, you kept on just watching her. That's when I knew what was burning inside of you.\"\n\n\"Who are you? What are you?\" I asked, when I reached a wall with no further way to escape the assailant.\n\n\"Me? Well, you can call me Twin or just T if you want. It doesn't really matter anyway, you're about to die.\"\n\nI pulled out my pocket knife as my last mean of defense. Twin just seized my forearm and broke the bones like dry branches. I screamed in pain but stopped when he seized my neck and lifted me above him. That girl, that person was really demon possessed and too strong. It was the end.\n\n\"I thought you were worth it, but you're just a kid. I could have done a fourth girl this week but instead I had to handle this? This is my turf by the way, back off!\" Twin said.\n\n\"Please, please,...\" I painfully repeated.\n\n\"So pathetic! You lucky Hazel just convinced me to let you live.\" Twin said and dropped me on the floor. \"Get up! I'm in a good mood today. Let me have a ride with your little baby out there.\" He added.\n\n***\n\nTwin drove skilfully, eyes still completely shut and humming a tune while doing so. I saw the bliss on Hazel's face, Twin was having the time of his life, maybe even doing it for the first time.\n\nIn pain and absolute shame, I was seated next to him, crying silently. The setting sun in the horizon looked like a door full of light I was advancing towards.\n\nWhatever was broken inside me seemed to have vanished after flirting with death. Why was I trying to ruin my life? How killing would have fixed my soul? It would have only destroyed me further.\n\nMy redemption did not lie in the death of another soul.\n\n\"That was a blast!\" Twin said after suddenly parking. He opened the car door and spoke before he exited. \"Remember kiddo. This is my turf. If you wanna play, play somewhere else.\" He added.\n\nI sped off to safety as soon as Hazel was out of my car and did not even look back at her. To this day, I am still recovering from the wounds and from the shock.\n\nNevertheless, I found the courage to work on myself and fight for a better life by doing things that are right. One of those things is to find a way to get Hazel/Twin in jail for what She/He did, demon possessed or not.\n\nWho knows? Instead of killing, maybe I am meant to catch the killers. All I know is that a second chance has been given to me, and I intend to use it wisely and to the fullest.",

        "text": "The darkness in my room was absolute, and I couldn't help but feel like I was being watched. I had always been a little afraid of the dark, but tonight it felt like something was different. The air was thick and oppressive, and I could hear the sound of my own breathing echoing in the stillness.\n\nI tried to tell myself that I was being ridiculous, that there was nothing to be afraid of. But the feeling persisted, and I found myself reaching for my phone, wanting to break the silence with some mindless scrolling.\n\nAs I reached for the phone on my nightstand, I noticed something strange in the shadows. It was a faint, flickering light, and it seemed to be getting closer. At first, I thought it was just my eyes playing tricks on me, but as the light grew brighter, I realized that it was something far more sinister.\n\nI could feel my heart racing as the light approached my bed, illuminating the face of a figure that seemed to materialize out of nowhere. It was a woman, but there was something off about her, something that made my skin crawl.\n\nShe was wearing a long, flowing dress, and her hair hung in wild tangles around her face. But it was her eyes that really terrified me. They were dark and empty, like there was nothing behind them but an endless void.\n\nI tried to scream, but no sound came out. I was paralyzed with fear, unable to move or even breathe. The woman just stood there, staring at me with those empty eyes, as the flickering light bathed us both in an eerie glow.\n\nAnd then, just as suddenly as she had appeared, she was gone. The darkness rushed back in, and I was left alone with my thoughts.\n\nI didn't sleep at all that night. I lay in bed, shaking with fear, unable to shake the feeling that I was being watched. The next morning, I tried to tell myself that it was just a dream, that it couldn't have been real.\n\nBut as the days went on, I started to notice other strange things happening around me. Objects would move without explanation, and I would catch glimpses of that woman out of the corner of my eye.\n\nI tried to ignore it, to convince myself that it was just my imagination running wild. But as the incidents grew more frequent and more terrifying, I knew that something was seriously wrong.\n\nAnd then, one night, she appeared again. This time, she was standing right next to my bed, her face mere inches from mine. I could feel her breath on my skin, and I knew that I was in mortal danger.\n\nBut then something strange happened. The woman reached out and touched my hand, and in that moment, I felt a surge of warmth wash over me. It was as if all the fear and terror that had been gripping me for so long suddenly melted away.\n\nI looked into her eyes, and this time, they weren't empty. They were filled with a depth of emotion that I couldn't quite understand, a mix of sorrow and regret that seemed to weigh heavily on her.\n\nAs I reached out to touch her face, her features began to shift and contort in a grotesque manner. Her eyes became hollow and dark, and her skin turned a sickly shade of gray. I tried to pull away, but her grip on my hand was tight, unyielding.\n\nI felt a chill run down my spine as her voice echoed through the darkness, a low, guttural sound that seemed to come from deep within her. She spoke of the things that lurked in the shadows, the beings that fed on fear and terror, the skin walkers that haunted the night.\n\nIn that moment, I realized that the warmth I had felt was not kindness or compassion, but something much darker. The woman in the darkness was not a benevolent spirit, but a malevolent force that fed on the fear of others.\n\nI struggled to free myself from her grip, but it was no use. I was trapped in her embrace, at the mercy of her whims. And as the night wore on, I felt myself slipping deeper and deeper into a state of terror and despair.\n\nThe hours pass by, and I lose all sense of time. It feels as if I've been trapped in this cycle of fear forever, and I begin to wonder if I'll ever escape.\n\nBut then, something unexpected happens. The woman's grip on my hand loosens for a moment, and I seize the opportunity to pull away. I stumble backward, gasping for air, my heart racing.\n\nI fumble in my pocket for my phone and quickly type out a message, hoping that someone will see it and come to my rescue. I hit the send button, and the message disappears into the ether.",

        "text": "\"I noticed it when it came inside, I don't know how, I don't know what it is, but I know exactly when it came in.  \n\nI was in bed with her, she was already asleep. I was reading when I heard it—the window on the next room over, sliding open. It caught my attention, and I knew exactly what it was. I told myself that I was being silly, that it was just one of the cats. I don't know if I was being lazy or if I was already afraid by then, but I didn't get up to check. I don't know if it would've made a difference if I did, but I can't stop blaming myself for not checking that goddamned window.\n\nThe next day, I checked the entire house, and there was nothing out of place—the cats were fine, and even the window was closed. So I forgot about it. At least for a little while, I forgot about the clear and distinct sound of the newly lubricated windows sliding open.\n\nThe cats felt its presence before we did. They used to be loving animals, always cuddling up to us. Then they started acting up, looking stressed, on edge. As soon as the sun would set, they'd try to flee the house: they even succeeded a couple of times, giving me the impossible task of finding two black cats, in tall grass, at night. \n\nThey started to wander the house at night, scratching doors, meowing, jumping on top of furniture. During the day they would sleep; I believe from exhaustion from being so active at night. And I swear, sometimes I think that the tiny furballs were having nightmares, kicking, hissing, jumping awake. Poor little things, I should've known by then, but I rationalized it away as stress from adapting to the new house.\n\nShe was affected next. She'd already noticed the cats' odd behavior, and their escape attempts were stressing her out, but her mood kept getting even worse.\nShe would snap at minor things, like running out of tomato paste, or if the eggs went bad.\n\nHer sleep also became troubled—she would toss, turn, huff, sweat bullets. Every night seemed like torment to her. It got so bad that she would be constantly sore, with stiff muscles, and even bruises.\n\nShe was becoming angry, cold, distant, even hateful. We started arguing every day about the smallest things, it seemed she'd get mad just from the sound of my breathing. Arguments became shouting matches. \n\nWeeks later she had dark circles under her eyes, she looked pale, depleted, exhausted.\nI feel guilty typing this, but I felt relieved when I found her. I couldn’t take watching the love of my life withering away like that.\n\nShe was lying in bed, her face frozen in a perfect little smile, cheeks still rosy. She looked so peaceful, happy even; she looked like she finally had some decent sleep. That is, if you ignored the dark brownish-red stains on the white sheets. She had slit her wrists with my shaving razor.",

        "text": "The Johnson family had just moved into their new home, a beautiful, remodeled home with a grand entrance and a sprawling lawn. They were excited to start their new life, and they spent weeks unpacking and decorating. But there was something strange about the house that they couldn't quite put their finger on.\n\nIt started with a door. The first time they noticed it was in the hallway. It was an old wooden door with intricate carvings, and they assumed it led to a storage space or a closet. They tried to open the door but, found that the handle was missing. They left the door alone and continued to unpack figuring, they would investigate it in the morning. \n\nThe next day, the door was gone. There was no sign of it in the hallway or anywhere else in the house. They searched the entire place, but there was no trace of the door. Tired and exhausted they shrugged it off thinking they may have been imagining the door with no handle after all it the placing didn’t make sense.\n\nBut then the door started appearing and disappearing at random places around the house. Sometimes it would be in the living room, other times in the master bedroom. And every time they tried to open it, the handle would be gone. The family was starting to become scared and concerned about the door. \n\nOne day, they were sitting in the living room when the door appeared in front of them. This time it was open. Inside they could see a dark, shadowy space beyond. They hesitated for a moment, but then curiosity got the better of them. They stepped through the door and what they found on the other side was beyond anything they could have imagined.\n\nThe room was dark and foreboding, and they could hear strange cries coming from the distance. The walls were made of flesh, and strange, writhing tendrils snaked through the space. They tried to step back through the door, but to their horror it was gone. \n\nThey stumbled through the pulsating fleshy room, calling out for help, but no one answered. The whispers grew louder, and the shadows seemed to be closing in on them. And then, they saw it. The door. It was back, just as suddenly as it had disappeared. They rushed towards it, desperate to escape.\n\nBut when they stepped through the door, they realized they were in a similar area which looked like the inside of a living being. The air was thick with the stench of decay. The door disappeared as the flesh surrounding the walls consumed it. They tried to run, but the walls seemed to be trapping them, pushing them forward. The Johnsons realized they were inside a creature, the house like an angler fish with its light had lured them with the door. \n\nAs they wandered through the living, breathing nightmare, they heard a voice. It was the voice of a person who claimed was owner of the house, a man who had disappeared without a trace just a few months ago. He explained how the house was ancient, it had been at the same locations for thousands of years. The exterior changes but the house is always the same. In the past there was a group that worshipped the house and it fed of human sacrifices. Now the house has evolved to feed itself. \n\nThe Johnsons knew they had to find a way out, moving forward they left the previous owner and kept moving forward. As they reached a dead end, they noticed the bodies absorbed by the house. Their bodies stuck inside of the walls, their eyes moving but their bodies standing still, only their cries could be heard. \n\nThe walls started to constrict, the Johnsons screamed in terror, as the house started to consume them, absorbing their life force until they too became part of the walls. From the corner of their eye, they noticed a door come out of the house’s fleshy walls.  The door standing still waiting for its next victim.",

        "text": " I’m not gonna make this too long because I seriously need advice, fast.  \nFor context: I’ve had pretty bad insomnia on and off since high school (I’m in my late 20s now). I’ve tried everything from melatonin to prescription sleeping pills and, at best, they made me drowsy. The only thing that helps me drift off is leaving the TV on all night.  \nBefore anyone says I’m just making my insomnia worse, I’m aware that this is not a good long-term solution; something about the bluish light of the screen screwing with your circadian rhythm. But it really has been the only thing that can knock me out.  \nI normally keep the volume low because late-night commercials are fucking loud and the whole point is to fall asleep. Last night I guess I fell out pretty early (before 10, I think) so the volume was still audible. Then I heard my name.  \nThis startled me awake for two reasons: one, I live alone; and, two, once my brain quit being fuzzy I realized there was a news report on the television. About me.  \nIf you’ve ever seen yourself on TV then you know it’s kind of exhilarating and surreal; one of the few instances in life when you’re in this weirdly objective position of watching yourself being yourself. There’s probably a word for that feeling. I’m too rattled to look it up right now.  \nI don’t watch the news much because I’m already depressed, thanks, but I know my local station’s call sign. This was not that. And it wasn’t the call sign of any other station I could find, either.  \nFrom the outset things seemed ordinary: there was the set, the desk, the fancy backdrop, the anchor… and a picture of me, with my date of birth and date of death beneath it. The death date was set a week into the future, meaning I’m supposed to die next Friday.  \nI can’t describe to you guys the awful, sick feeling I got in my stomach, like I was on a roller coaster (which I hate anyway) and the car just kept going up and up towards the first drop without ever reaching it. There’s nowhere to go and no one around to stop the ride and ask if you’re okay. You’re just trapped and terrified with that sick feeling churning inside you.  \nI didn’t think it could get any worse - until the anchor started talking.  \n“\\[My Name\\] will be found deceased next Friday evening at approximately 5:45pm. Cause of death–” That’s all I remember, or all I care to remember, before my cold-sweat, panic-attack-imminent ass jumped the fuck out of bed and turned the TV off.  \nI’m at a loss, guys. My brain has been spinning trying to come up with an explanation while simultaneously not wanting to think about it for too long or I’ll have another panic attack.  \nIs someone going to hurt me, and is it someone I know or a random intruder? Am I going to die in an accident? (I had a girls’ night scheduled next Friday at 7 that I had to cancel because I’m too scared to leave my apartment or see anyone… and now I’m worried I’ll die at home. Jesus Christ.)  \nI wish I could lie to myself and write this off as a bad dream, but it’s affected my waking hours so drastically that I know I won’t get any sleep for the next week. I’ll be damned if I leave my TV on ever again.  \nAny advice? I need all the help I can get before Friday.  \nThanks.",

        "text": "A sylvan highway, a mess with slush, snow burdened trees loomed like ancient things judging me for my carelessness. The man that I’d hit with my van was nowhere to be found. \n\n“Where are you?!” No response came, just the whisper of the breeze through the evergreens. “We have to get you to a hospital!” moments passed again with nothing. \n\nI leaned my shoulder against the sturdy oak that was now the gravestone for my 1992 Dodge Caravan. I looked at the wreck, as I ran my hand through my hair. Steam still rose from the crushed in hood, a sweet warm smell permeated the air. I stood there, watched the coolant trickle from the radiator. My mind had stalled, all while the severity of my situation cascaded into my stomach and settled as hot coals. \n\n“This is really bad.” There's an end to this. Quit wasting time and start walking. An abrupt jolt of conviction gave a resolution that invigorated my listless legs. \n\n“The road map!” I snatched it up from the dash where it had flown from my hands after the accident. We were suddenly back to the initial dilemma. Where the hell was I?\n\nWas it the stress, did I hit my head? Questions arose as the map seemed to always be on the wrong page. I couldn’t find where I was in West Virginia. Knowing that I was on Highway 119, my index finger tried to follow the roads that were bigger than the rest on the page, my eyes strained with the effort. The highway that I was stranded on wasn’t in here, is it *this edition* or? Flipping back to the inner cover, there it was, front and center  “Printed in 1950” (it was 2002). \n\n“What a cheap prick!” I tossed the map like a frisbee at the passenger door. Who runs a fucking gas station by a major state highway, and doesn’t keep their stock of road maps up-to-date? A cheap prick, that’s who! Hand balled into a fist, I leaned back to punch the side of the van; visions of a broken hand made it to my muscles before committing to the swing. That’ll fix this, I thought, go ahead break your fucking hand. My arms fell in defeat. \n\nLet’s think this through. I paced back-and-forth, rubbing the back of my neck. *Roads,* new ones can be put in anywhere, anytime; but towns and cities, those, not so much. Wasn’t there a sign somewhere some miles back, something someone said at the gas station before I got on the road?\n\nHarper’s Ferry, that was it, to the East! I sprung into action and ripped off a chunk of a cardboard moving box from the back of my van and wrote in bold black marker: *Headed East. Harper’s Ferry. Need help.* I then affixed it between a wiper blade and the windshield,  grabbed my Coat, what was left of a bottle of water, put the sun behind me and began to walk. My shadow was growing long, the winter sun was near to setting. Orange and reds swirled in the dark blue of the sky. There wasn’t a town in sight. This was becoming dire, a stupid idea to walk, and why has no one driven by yet? And why are there no birds, don’t birds get more vocal just before the sun goes down? Especially in the middle of fucking nowhere!\n\nIn that moment, a wave of something, embarrassment or maybe fear, washed through me. I checked over my shoulder, to make certain that my frustration was just that, *mine*. It had been so long since I had last seen another vehicle while on the road. I needed help and didn’t want to blow any chance I had as a desperate hitchhiker by raving to myself like I was bat-shit crazy. A sip from my water bottle brought me some comfort. I trudged on, occasionally I would steal a glance of the sun set.\n\nIt wasn’t until night fell that I'd seen the twinkle of lights through the trees. The largest lights were orange and blue and higher than the rest. Without the sun's warmth, the cold was invading my modest layers. I was relieved to see light at the end of the tunnel.  \n\nAs I approached the small booth-style gas station, it began to sleet. The cold air of night produced a fog that gathered around the lights, streaks of silver fell through the glowing orbs and crashed to the mirror of pavement below. My mind started to drift to my cold hands hugging a mug of hot coffee with a heavy blanket draped over my shoulders while sitting on the trunk of a police cruiser. For better or worse, I’d breathe in the steam as I waited for the police to fix everything.\n\nI shook my mind of its reverie and peered into the milky, streaked glass of the station. There were lights on inside, maybe not all of them, but enough to discern the dark shapes within. Under the canopy that sheltered two vintage gas-pumps, I tried a door on the right side of the square building. I pushed, it did not open. I  pulled, it did not open. It responded with an indifferent thump of the bolt colliding with the striker plate. I gave the glass on the door a few harsh knocks with the underside of my fist. Nothing stirred inside. \n\nI made a loop around the building and searched for an alternative entrance. “Hello?!” my voice broke through the tranquility, not so much as an echo returned to my ears. Naturally, my savior being a sleepy little town that *rolls up the sidewalks* at… what time was it even? It couldn’t be much past 7:00 pm.  \n\nI left the cover of the canopy to find that the road split. The short streets that ended in sharp angles didn’t help visibility, nor did the old trees that filtered the moonlight. Straight ahead, old brick buildings lined one side of the street and a dense forest occluded the other. Through the forest was a large winding lake down a precipitous incline.\n\nThere were three buildings with glass fronts: a hardware store, a florist's studio, and a little hole-in-the-wall coffee shop. All of which were closed, their interiors dark. Gray dunes spanned one third of the way up the glass facades, vague shapes protruding.  My eyes strained to focus, the gray and black tones washed out details. I was about to get a closer look, when out of the corner of my eye there was a spasm of light.. There, under a street light, stood a man in simple clothing. Shadows concealed his face, yet I could feel his eyes on me.\n\n“H-hey! I-I need help!” I stammered. No sooner, he turned and disappeared around the corner of a street. \n\n“Stop!” I shouted as I ran after him. “I need help!” The buildings and trees to my sides seemed to narrow as I advanced down the street. An electronics store burst into life as I turned the corner. The window display of televisions and radios all broadcasted static and a wet, rushing white noise. \n\nI crossed a street into a small parking lot, crowned in a thicket of trees.  The man was closer this time, poised below a manic street light and beside a sign that read beach. “My van is wrecked! I hit someone on my way here. I need to use a phone.” The street light went dark for a moment, then re-illuminated; the man was gone. The blood drained from my face as every hair on my body stood with the current of unease.\n\n“What is happening? People don’t just disappear, they can’t.” The thoughts in my head began to race. Everything that happened up to this point came in as raw white vibrance. \n\n“Come on!” I steeled myself, “Don’t panic, you’re tired, blood sugar’s low, you need water!” I fumbled through my coat for the bottle of water. I drank, to wash the acrid sting of bile that rose from my throat.  \n\nMy mind calmed enough to piece together thoughts. Maybe this is a tourist town, if it’s off season that would explain why there aren’t people around. This revelation calmed my anxiety.  You’re stressed, and hallucinating, calm down. The warmth of breath in my hands over my face was a comfort, like hiding from monsters under a blanket. I hadn’t noticed that I covered my face and let my hands fall.\n\nThe world came back into focus. My tired legs wobbled with each stride towards the stairs leading to the beach. I glared down into the long throat of darkness and my leg hesitated, as though rusted, to take the first step into the crooked mouth. \n\nLandings were placed after dozens of stairs, where thick wooden poles aimed cones of sodium light that began to pulsate on-and-off, on-and-off. Each step took with apprehension, breaths became deep, slow, and staccato. The man appeared again, on a landing ahead as the light above him throbbed with sickly yellow haze. The next moment he was gone. I did not call out to him.\n\nMy vision vignetted with the pulsating lights. When my nerve allowed a glance up from the stairs, I could see a structure in the water silhouetted by the full moon behind it. The moon light twinkled on its ninety degree edges. I looked back to my feet. Another step down, then another, and another still. \n\nThe toe of my shoe was the first to touch the sand. I stepped onto the beach, sinking passed my ankles; with each step plumes of dust belched out from the wet top layer. Under the thick skin was light and airy sand. I shuffled forward and, below my feet, ridged things clacked and rattled. \n\nA colossal square gate stood in the water near the beach. What is this place? A horizontal rod of staticky white light erupted from the center of the structure. Other shapes rose from the water beside it. The light illuminated a gray beach with black gnarled trees that bent in, branches reached. The haze closed in, the world was so small. I shook my head frantically to clear it of disorientation, the light pushed away the dark, I raised a hand to shield my eyes. Flashes of my life exploded in jarring rhythmic beats. \n\nI was right in front of the gate now. I gasped for air and thrashed my body, my movements were in wet cement, shocks of energy jerked through my limbs. As my body turned, there was the man, his mouth screamed but there was no sound. His eyes, wild and scared. There were others with him, leaned in. \n\nWhite.",

        "text": "I know it sounds crazy. Believe me, at first, I myself didn’t want to accept it. After the recent events, I have come to the conclusion that the neighbor’s dog, if you can even call it a dog, has been stalking me since I’ve moved into my apartment. \n\nI’ve run into the neighbor walking Shaggy, his 4 year old barbet, while going on jogs, and I didn’t question anything at first. Shaggy seemed super friendly and was super cordial to my doberman whenever I bring her on my runs. I hadn’t noticed it at first, but the more time I spent in the apartment, it became more apparent.\n\nThe first incident with Shaggy was after I had come back from a run and wanted to shower before making myself dinner. I walked out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel, when out of the corner of my eyes, I saw Shaggy next to the window of his apartment staring at me through a small gap in my curtains. His paws were outstretched as if he were standing. His eyes looked more beady than usual, and his gaze never left my stature. I called to him in the highest pitch my voice could make, but he didn’t budge. Unnerved, I closed and locked the window and closed the curtain completely, but I could still feel his eyes on me.\n\nAnother incident happened while I was walking home from the gym with my dog. I had my headphones on and was just trying to enjoy the serenity of solitude, when my dog started growling and getting territorial. Naturally, I looked behind me in case I was being followed. When I turned back, I was met with Shaggy, but he looked different from when I first met him. His fur was a bit darker and covered most of his face. His eyes were still partially visible, and they looked like a human’s eyes, as if there was a person inside him. Shaggy’s facial expression hardened like he was trying to squint his eyes. My dog grew more aggressive each second of being there. I tried to calm her down, but there was nothing I could do. From his apartment building, the neighbor shouted down for Shaggy. The dog looked up, then back to me, huffed, and started walking up the stairs and into the neighbor’s house. Since this incident, everywhere I go, I see Shaggy’s human-like face peeking at me from around corners. \n\nI don’t know for sure why Shaggy’s doing this, but I’m pretty certain he isn’t actually a dog. I’ve tried to get in contact with the apartment owners, as well as the past residents of my specific apartment. I heard they left suddenly with no explanation, so I’ve done my digging and have sent them emails asking for more information. I’m very distraught and have been debating whether to get the police involved. I’ll update as soon as I get a response from the previous residents, or if I have another encounter with Shaggy.",

I stayed with her every chance I got, and I was honestly more inclined to share my problems with her than with my parents. I always knew I was welcome in her home, and we never stopped having that kind of relationship.\n\nLife and school and adulthood are beasts any way you look at it, but not least because they take your time away from people and things you care for greatly. Nana and I never became emotionally distant, but I didn't get to stay with her much form junior-high onward. By junior year of high school, I'd only see her once or twice a week. By freshman year of college, I only saw her once or twice a month.\n\nI didn't realize late in my junior year that I hadn't visited her in six months, then one day the phone rang and they told me that she'd had a stroke and was comatose. I went home, but she never woke up and she passed away about a week later.\n\nI was extremely upset, but my grandmother had always taught me that death is a natural part of life. She said that she wanted me to have only good memories of her life and our time together, and so her  being gone felt more like her going home to another and a better life. I helped my family clean out her house, and then I had to return to campus to finish out the year.\n\nFast forward one year, and I was getting ready to graduate. \n\nIt's important to note that I wasn't in a good place personally. I had been dating the same girl since sophomore year (a girl I thought I was going to marry, to be honest), but we went through a pretty hideous breakup (she dumped me) over the course of my last semester. To make things worse, I had become disillusioned with my career choice (Biology major). As I said, I got into a pretty serious relationship during the third semester of college, and I think that that masked the boredom I was feeling with my coursework. I mean, I was planning on getting married and settling down almost as soon as I graduated. I had intended to go to graduate school followed by a teaching position, but once I was single again I realized that (without a spouse and maybe children to immediately support) I was suddenly a guy with a degree in something that I honestly had grown sick of. \n\nI finally broke down and told my folks this, and they responded in a very supportive way. They offered me my grandmother's house (which they now owned) to live in until I figures out what to do with myself. I happily accepted, and I packed my dorm room into two boxes and sped off after exams.\n\nWhen I arrived, everything looked just as it had been left. My folks had brought in a maid to keep the place clear of dust and pests, but no one had lived here in a long time. I took my things in and unpacked as soon as I arrived, and by the time I put my suitcase away it was almost dark outside. My mom had stocked the fridge, so I put together a small meal, showered, and got ready for bed.\n\nI  couldn't really sleep with everything that was on my mind, so I decided to make tea and try to calm down. I was sipping away in a very comfortable armchair, and I guess I dozed off. \n\nI woke up suddenly, and I instantly knew that someone had me by shoulders - shaking me. In the dim light of the one lamp I'd left on, I saw a form that (at first) I assumed was my mother. The voice sounded like hers if a bit distant, but I was 97% asleep. In my punch-drunk state, I stood up awkwardly. The person in front of me let go and began tugging at my arm and talking about how it would all come right soon and saying that \"family always makes things better\". I assumed that my mom had let herself in (I hadn't told them that I was arriving that day and I forgot to call them when I did) and was telling me to go lay down and rest.  \n\nAbout that time, the sleepiness in my eyes wore off and I started to be able to see details of the person who'd woken me up. \n\nIt was Nana, plain as day in her Sunday print dress and with her trifocals resting on the end of her nose. I got that unbearable goose-bump chill that paralyses you in nightmares and I started to back away. I couldn't move very fast, and I had one of those moments where you realize that you're dreaming. Strange thing is I didn't wake up, the image of my grandmother and the hallway behind her just faded to black.\n\nI *actually* woke up at about 5:30 the next morning - in the bed. I wasn't sure how I'd gotten there and the dream from the previous night was still fresh in my head. I assumed that stress and fatigue had caused me to have some kind of nightmare, and I wrote the whole experience off as such.\n\nCut to that Friday morning, five days after I arrived at Nana's house. I hadn't had anymore dreams, but at about 10:00, someone starts knocking on the door - rather furiously. I open the door, and it's my ex girlfriend (Hailee). She was crying, and while I stood there looking all confused she just threw her arms around me and held on like I'd just rescued her from being lost in a desert. \n\nI sat her down and, when she'd stopped crying, she started to tell me why she'd come (all the way from Tennessee where we'd been going to school- Vanderbuilt).\n\nShe told me that starting on Monday night (the night after I'd had the dream about Nana-her exams bled into the week after mine), she'd had this recurring dream where she saw me crying. She told me that a woman's voice kept telling her every time she had this dream that she was making a mistake. It apparently had a deep effect on her, because she said she couldn't stand not being with me and that my parents had told her where to find me. \n\nI didn't really think about it at the time because I was so glad to have her back, but in later years something came out that really unnerves me. The voice in Hailee's dream was telling her that she had to come back to me because \"snuffles\" loved her and that she'd never be happy if she didn't put things back the way they should be. She was seeing an image of me while being told this, and given what had happened she just inferred that the dream voice was talking about me and didn't think anything of the  name.\n\nI was a huge Sesame Street fan as a little kid, and I loved to watch the show on Saturday mornings (I always spent Friday night at Nana's). My favorite character was Snuffleupagus, and so my grandmother's secret nickname for me was Snuffles. No one ever heard her call me that, and I never told anybody about it.",

        "text": "drawn to the idea of unlocking hidden powers and secrets that lay beyond the veil of reality. She spent long hours poring over ancient texts, scouring the internet for forums and discussion groups, and seeking out other practitioners who shared her passion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer search led her to a coven of like-minded individuals who shared her thirst for knowledge and power. They would gather in secret locations, their faces obscured by masks and hoods, to perform rituals and incantations that called upon forces beyond the physical world. They experimented with spells, potions, and other mystical objects, often using blood and other bodily fluids to amplify their effects.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs time passed, the coven became bolder and more reckless in their pursuit of power. They delved into darker and more dangerous forms of magic, exploring the boundaries of what was possible. They called upon demons and malevolent spirits, and used their power to manipulate and control others.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLily was swept up in the rush of power, feeling as though she had tapped into something beyond herself. She felt invincible, as though nothing could touch her. But her euphoria was short-lived. As the coven delved deeper into the darkness, they began to experience strange and terrifying phenomena. Shadows seemed to move on their own, objects would fly across the room, and they heard whispers in the darkness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne night, they attempted to summon a powerful demon, hoping to gain even greater control and influence over the world. The creature they called forth was unlike anything they had ever seen. Its eyes glowed with a sinister red light, and its voice was like a thousand voices screaming at once. It was a being of pure malevolence and hatred, and it hungered for the souls of the living.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe demon tore through the coven members like they were made of paper, leaving Lily as the only survivor. The pain of losing her friends was overwhelming, and she was left with a sense of guilt and shame that haunted her for years to come.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLily tried to leave the world of the occult behind, but it seemed to follow her wherever she went. She saw signs and symbols in everyday objects, and strange occurrences happened around her. She began to hear the demon's voice in her dreams, and it seemed to be calling to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day, Lily received a visit from the leader of the coven. The woman explained that they had sensed a dark force gathering, something even more malevolent and powerful than the demon they had unleashed. The coven needed her help to stop it, but the task would be dangerous and potentially deadly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite her misgivings, Lily agreed to help. She was desperate to make amends for the mistakes she had made, and to use her knowledge for good. The coven trained her in new spells and incantations, teaching her to harness the light as well as the darkness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe day of reckoning arrived, and the coven faced off against the dark force. The battle was fierce and terrifying, with creatures of darkness and shadow attacking them from all sides. The coven fought bravely, but they were outnumbered and outmatched.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLily knew what she had to do. She stepped forward, calling upon all the light within her. She focused all of her energy and chanted the demon's true name, hoping to banish the darkness once and for all. But as she did so, she realized that the demon had left a part of itself within her, a seed of darkness that had taken root in her soul.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe creature howled in pain as its power was stripped away, and it was banished to its realm\n\nDespite her fear, Jane couldn't help but be curious about the strange noises coming from her attic. It was as if something were calling out to her, tempting her to investigate further.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next night, the noises started up again, but this time they were accompanied by a cold draft that seemed to come from the direction of the attic. Jane felt a chill run down her spine and her heart raced in her chest as she listened to the strange sounds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDespite her fear, she decided to investigate. Slowly, she made her way up the creaky staircase, her eyes scanning the darkened hallway for any signs of movement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs she reached the top of the stairs, she saw a faint light coming from beneath the attic door. Her heart raced as she reached out to turn the handle, her hand shaking with fear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs she pushed the door open, she was met with an icy blast of wind, and she could hear a low, guttural growl coming from the darkness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the dim light, she saw a figure huddled in the corner of the attic, its eyes gleaming with an otherworldly light. Jane's heart was pounding in her chest as she stepped closer, and she realized with horror that the creature was not of this world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts skin was pale and sickly, and it was covered in sores and open wounds. Its eyes were black as pitch, and it seemed to be breathing in short, ragged gasps.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs she stepped closer, the creature let out a bloodcurdling scream, and Jane could feel the darkness closing in around her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn that moment, she knew that she had made a terrible mistake. She had opened a door to a world that should have remained closed, and she was now trapped in a nightmare that would never end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe tried to back away, but her feet were rooted to the spot. The creature seemed to be drawing her in, its eyes holding her in a trance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn that moment, Jane knew that she was lost. The creature had claimed her soul, and she would never be the same again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom that day on, strange things began to happen in the house. Doors would open and close on their own, and footsteps could be heard echoing through the hallways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJane knew that she was being haunted by the creature from the attic, and she knew that she would never be able to escape its clutches.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the days passed, Jane's mind began to unravel. She started to see visions of the creature everywhere she went, and its voice whispered in her ear as she slept.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, unable to take it any longer, Jane made the decision to end it all. She went up to the attic one final time, her heart racing in her chest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs she reached the top of the stairs, she could feel the presence of the creature all around her, its cold breath on her neck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn that moment, Jane knew that there was no escape. She had opened a door to a world of darkness, and she would never be free.\n\nLily's heart was racing as she tried to remember the incantation for the protection spell. She could hear the demon's voice growing louder and more insistent in her mind, telling her to stop fighting and join it in the darkness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut she pushed the voice aside, and with shaking hands, she began to recite the spell. The words felt heavy and clumsy on her tongue, but she forced herself to keep going, pouring all of her energy and willpower into the incantation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs she finished the final word, she felt a surge of power emanating from the stone. It pulsed with a bright light that seemed to fill the cavern and drive back the darkness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe demon let out a blood-curdling scream as the light engulfed it, and Lily shielded her eyes from the blinding glare. When the light dissipated, she cautiously lowered her hands and looked around.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe demon was gone, but the cave was in ruins. The stone had crumbled to dust, and the walls were blackened and charred. The air was thick with the smell of sulfur and smoke.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLily stumbled back, her head spinning with exhaustion and adrenaline. She couldn't believe she had survived, and she was overwhelmed with relief and gratitude.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs she made her way back up to the surface, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching her. She heard whispers in the darkness and felt cold breath on her neck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen she finally emerged from the cave, she collapsed on the ground, gasping for air. She knew she would never be the same again, and that the experience would haunt her for the rest of her life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYears went by, and Lily tried to put the experience behind her. She tried to live a normal life, but she was never able to shake the feeling that something was following her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe would wake up in the middle of the night, sweating and shaking, as she relived the terror of the cave. She would see shadows moving in the corners of her vision, and hear whispers in the silence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then, one night, as she was falling asleep, she heard the voice again. It was the same voice that had spoken to her in the cave, low and insistent, urging her to come back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLily sat up in bed, her heart racing. She knew she couldn't ignore the voice, that she had to face her fear and confront the darkness once again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe got up and dressed quickly, packing a bag with everything she would need. She knew she had to return to the cave, to face the demon once and for all, and to put an end to the nightmares that had plagued her for so long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs she drove through the night, she felt a sense of dread and anticipation building within her. She knew that the demon would be waiting for her, and that she might not come back alive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut she was determined to face her fear, to take back the power that had been taken from her, and to finally put an end to the darkness that had haunted her for so long.\n\nAs they gathered in the clearing, Lily's heart raced with anticipation and fear. She had never attempted anything like this before, and she was keenly aware of the risk they were taking. The other members of the coven seemed similarly nervous, though they tried to hide it behind an air of excitement and bravado.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs they began to chant, Lily could feel the energy in the air shift. It was like the very fabric of reality was thinning, and she could sense a presence on the other side. The chanting grew louder and more frenzied, until Lily was almost overwhelmed by the force of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then, with a suddenness that was almost shocking, something shifted. The air seemed to tremble, and a figure appeared before them. It was dark and twisted, with jagged horns and glowing eyes. Its breath was hot and fetid, and Lily could feel the heat of it on her skin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe demon spoke in a language that was ancient and alien, and Lily could barely make out the words. But she knew they were in danger, and she could feel the demon's power surging around them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the demon advanced, the coven members tried to fight back. They used spells and incantations they had practiced for months, calling upon the elements and the spirits of the dead. But the demon seemed to be immune to their attacks, and it only grew stronger with each passing moment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLily realized with horror that they were outmatched. They had delved too deep into the darkness, and they had summoned something they could not control. And as the demon reached out to grab her, she knew that this was the end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then, with a suddenness that was almost miraculous, Lily felt something stir within her. It was like a light had been switched on, and she could feel the energy of the earth and the sky flowing through her. She reached deep within herself, calling upon all the light and power she could muster.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith a cry of pure energy, she unleashed a torrent of light that blasted through the demon's defenses. The creature howled in pain, and its form began to warp and twist. And then, with a final burst of light, the demon was banished to its realm.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe coven was stunned, and Lily herself was shaking with the intensity of the experience. She had tapped into something deep within herself, something she had never known existed. But she could also sense the toll it had taken on her, and she knew that the darkness would always be waiting, just beyond the edge of the light.\n\nThe figure turned to her, its eyes now locked onto hers. They were pools of darkness, and she could feel a chill run down her spine as she met its gaze.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe demon's voice echoed through her mind, like a thousand voices screaming at once. It spoke of things she couldn't comprehend, of horrors beyond her imagination. Lily felt her mind start to unravel, and she realized that she was no match for the demon's power.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe felt a hand on her shoulder, and she turned to see the coven leader standing behind her. The woman's face was etched with lines of worry, but there was a steely determination in her eyes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Focus, Lily,\" the coven leader said. \"Remember everything we've taught you. You have the power to banish this demon back to its realm.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLily nodded, steeling herself against the onslaught of the demon's voice. She closed her eyes and focused on the incantation, the words coming to her as if from a place beyond herself. She felt the power of the coven flowing through her, and she knew that they were all with her in spirit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith a fierce cry, Lily opened her eyes and released the incantation. The demon howled in rage as its power was stripped away, and it began to fade from view. Lily felt a sense of relief wash over her as the demon disappeared, but she knew that the battle was far from over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe coven members regrouped, their faces tense with anticipation. They knew that they had only bought themselves some time, that the demon would eventually return with a vengeance. But for now, they were safe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe group spent the next few days recovering from their injuries and preparing for the next battle. Lily felt a sense of belonging with the coven, of finally finding a place where she fit in. She realized that she had been searching for this group her whole life, and that they were the only ones who truly understood her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut she also knew that there were dark forces out there that were beyond her understanding, and that there were beings like the demon that were too powerful for humans to control. She vowed to use her knowledge for good, to fight against the forces of darkness and protect the world from their wrath.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs she left the coven and made her way back to her apartment, Lily felt a sense of foreboding wash over her. She knew that the battle was far from over, that there were still many dangers out there that threatened the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut for now, she felt a sense of hope. She knew that she had found her true purpose, and that she would do everything in her power to protect the world from the darkness that lay just beyond the edge of human understanding.\n\nAs the night wore on, the winds grew stronger, and the trees outside bent and creaked under the force of the gale. Lily could hear the sound of branches scraping against the windowpanes, and she pulled the covers tighter around herself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut despite her fear, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. She tried to tell herself that it was just her imagination, that there was no one there, but the feeling persisted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly, there was a loud crash from downstairs. Lily's heart leaped into her throat, and she held her breath, listening for any other sounds. But there was only silence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe slowly got out of bed, her heart pounding in her chest, and made her way to the bedroom door. She paused for a moment, listening for any sounds, but all she could hear was the howling wind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTaking a deep breath, she opened the door and stepped out into the hallway. The darkness was oppressive, and she could barely make out the shapes of the furniture in the dim light. She cautiously made her way down the stairs, her eyes scanning the darkness for any signs of movement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen she reached the bottom of the stairs, she could see that the front door was wide open, and the wind was blowing rain and leaves into the foyer. A cold gust of wind blew past her, and she shivered, realizing that she was standing in the middle of the room, exposed and vulnerable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly, she heard a sound behind her, and she spun around, her heart racing. There, standing in the shadows, was a figure. It was tall and thin, with long, bony fingers and a face that seemed to be made of darkness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLily wanted to scream, but no sound would come out. She tried to move, but her body felt heavy, as though she was frozen in place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe figure took a step toward her, and Lily could see that its eyes were glowing with a malevolent red light. She could feel the darkness radiating from it, like a cold wind blowing across her skin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe tried to back away, but her feet wouldn't move. The figure continued to advance, its fingers reaching out to grab her. Lily could feel its icy touch on her skin, and she knew that she was lost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then, as suddenly as it had appeared, the figure disappeared. The wind died down, and the rain stopped, and Lily was left standing alone in the foyer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe didn't know how long she stood there, trembling with fear, before she finally found the strength to move. She stumbled out of the house and ran into the street, where she collapsed, sobbing and shaking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom that day on, Lily never went back to the house. She tried to forget what had happened, but the memory of the figure in the shadows haunted her for the rest of her life. And she knew that the darkness was always there, waiting for its next victim to summon it forth.\n\nLily tried to shake off the feeling of dread that had settled over her, but it lingered like a heavy weight on her shoulders. She knew that something was wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs the night wore on, the coven gathered around a fire and began to perform their ritual. They called upon the spirits of the dead, hoping to communicate with loved ones who had passed beyond the veil.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt first, everything seemed to be going well. The flames of the fire burned brightly, and the air was filled with the scent of burning herbs. But then, something shifted. The flames flickered and died down, and the air grew thick and heavy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLily felt a sense of unease as she looked around at the other members of the coven. They all seemed to be in a trance-like state, and their eyes were glazed over. She tried to shake them out of it, but they didn't respond.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly, a low growling sound echoed through the clearing. It was like nothing Lily had ever heard before, and it sent a shiver down her spine. The growling grew louder and more menacing, and Lily realized that it was coming from the woods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe turned to look, and what she saw made her blood run cold. A group of dark figures emerged from the trees, moving slowly and deliberately towards them. They were covered in dirt and grime, and their faces were twisted in rage and malice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLily tried to run, but it was too late. The figures were upon them, and they began to attack the coven members. Lily watched in horror as her friends were torn apart by the frenzied mob, their bodies left broken and lifeless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs she stumbled through the woods, trying to escape, Lily realized that she had been set up. The coven had known what was coming, and they had used her as a sacrifice to appease the dark forces they had been meddling with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom that day on, Lily lived a life of solitude and regret. She knew that the world was filled with dark forces and malevolent spirits, and that some things were better left alone. But she couldn't shake the feeling that there was still more to the story, that there was a deeper and more sinister truth lurking in the shadows.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe spent years studying and researching, trying to unravel the mysteries of the occult and the dark forces that threatened the world. And in the end, she knew that there was only one way to protect the world from the darkness that lurked just beyond the veil: to face it head on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLily gathered a small group of like-minded individuals around her, and together they dedicated their lives to battling the forces of darkness. They fought against demons and spirits, using their knowledge of the occult to harness the light and defeat the darkness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut even as they worked to protect the world, Lily knew that the darkness would always be there, waiting for its chance to strike. She knew that the price of power was high, and that there were some things that were better left alone. But she also knew that she could never turn her back on the battle, for as long as there were those who would seek to summon the darkness, there would always be a need for those who would fight against it.\n\nLily watched as the demon let out one final, earth-shattering roar before it was banished back to its realm. The sky above began to clear, and the dark storm clouds dissipated into nothingness. She looked around at the aftermath of the battle, and felt a wave of sadness wash over her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany of the coven members had been killed in the fight, and Lily herself was badly injured. She knew that the consequences of dabbling in the occult were grave, and she had learned that power was not something to be taken lightly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut as she watched the survivors pick themselves up, she knew that she had made the right choice. She had used her knowledge of the occult to protect the world from the forces of darkness, and she had come out on the other side, wiser and stronger.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom that day on, Lily continued to live a solitary life, using her knowledge to fight against the dark forces that threatened the world. She knew that the dangers of the occult were very real, and that there were still beings of darkness and shadow out there, waiting to be summoned by those foolish enough to try.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut Lily had learned her lesson, and she vowed never to delve too deeply into the darkness again. She knew that the balance between light and dark was a delicate one, and that it was up to those who had knowledge of the occult to maintain that balance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd as she walked away from the battlefield, she felt a sense of peace wash over her. She knew that the world would always be threatened by darkness, but she also knew that she had the power to fight it. And for Lily, that was enough.",

        "text": "I haven’t slept in days and I don’t know what else to do so I’m writing my story on Reddit. My name is James Carter. You see, I’m a big fan of the show Family Guy. I’ve seen every episode multiple times so when I saw a odd looking family guy vhs at a yard sale I was intrigued. It wasn’t an episode that I recognized and I’ve been to tons of yardsales prowling for family guy vhs and dvds and such. I figured it must’ve been some kinda lost episode. I’d heard of those so I went to the man in charge of the yard sale and asked about the vhs. “You don’t want to buy that” he told me “it’s not a good episode”. I like most episodes of family guy so I persisted with the transaction. I asked how much it cost and he told me “you don’t pay for this episode with money”. That was kinda mysterious but I took the tape and went on my way. In hindsight that was a blunder…\n\nWhen I got back home I popped the episode in to my vhs player that I have for watching vhs tapes. It seemed like a regular episode at first. The theme song was as catchy as ever and I enjoyed listening to it but I thought that Lois maybe winked a little while saying “violence in movies” but I dismissed it. It’s crazy what your eyes can miss when you don’t want to see. The episode started off regular. Peter tried almond milk for the first time then became vegan. I don’t remember the plot of the episode that well because of what happened during the first cutaway gag. Peter walked into the kitchen of his home and caught his family eating meat. Then he said “I ought to kill you guys for eating meat. Like that time I killed James Carter” then he looked into the camera with realistic looking eyes. Then the cutaway started and I couldn’t believe my eyes. Peter was beating up me but it wasn’t me. It was a family guy character that looked like me though and he had the same name. It freaked me out a little so I unplugged the TV. The episode was still playing though. Peter was still beating me up on the screen and eventually I was killed and Peter was laughing. Then the screen went dark. \n\nAt first I couldn’t move. How could family guy know my name and image? This had to be some kind of prank. But then, I heard a slightly off key version of Surfin Bird playing from the other room but when I went to investigate I couldn’t find the source of the music. The song eventually stopped and things have been normal. Well almost normal… every time I close my eyes I can hear Peter’s laughing hehehehehehehe. I’ll try to keep you guys updated if anything else unusual happens but I’m freaked out rn. I’m not sure but I think the laughing gets louder every time I close my eyes",

To my knowledge off and on for the first six-seven and continuously for the last 17 months and still are. I hear voices that constantly speaking to me in a sentient manner, they change at will, i.e. sounding like a man or woman, as well as fictional characters. They've instructed me to do complex tasks, taking a train to another state, rejoining the military, to get a job and which job I was allowed to have. They can manipulate the nerve endings in my body. Doing so in conjunction with taunts and threats, creating sensations of touch, pain, etc. Being able to simulate the feeling of being shocked, cut, pinched, raped, in various areas of my body. They can create the sensation of smell in my mind, I smell things not present where I am, they force images into my mind constantly and manipulate my dreams, as in my dreams are vivid and complex to the point I'm not properly rested, i wake up tired and in pain. I dream things I never dreamed before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   I believe it works through radio/microwaves, possibly submitted from a device to satellite than sent out through 5G towers. No one believes me, and people from my old unit, who I know are involved deny it, even though one dropped me hints that it was true. I'm still being tortured/psychologically abused/sexually assaulted to this day. All I'm able to do is resist what they tell me to do and try to spread awareness of it. I don't expect anyone to be able to help or save me through Reddit, it just a means to spread awareness and information. r/Artificial_Telepathy is where I've accumulated all I'm able to find on the subject. Please visit and share the information, join if you like. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   I have posted a more concise, and condensed version of this on Reddit, it contained less because I knew less.

I do not have any head related trauma nor been to the doctor for such.\n\n\n\n\n\n   I am only trying to tell as many people as possible that this is real, and has been going on for decades. It is hell it is an invisible prison, it's no contact torture and abuse. It is a complete invasion and rape of the mind and body.

        "text": "I am so scared, I don’t know what to do. To start with, let me just say I loved my wife, Serena. I loved her for nearly 12 years but two years ago we grew apart and in that time, I met someone else. Katy walked into my life on a particularly cold February day, with her long dark hair and her beautiful green eyes. She was new at the office where I worked as a computer engineer. I think it was her laugh that really did it for me. That proper throw-your-head-back, really-means-it kind of laugh, you know? We started meeting up in the cafe downstairs for lunch, at first accidentally and then all the time. We had so much in common. We loved the same PC games. We both enjoyed action movies and true crime, and we both came from big families. Katy was a widow and had lost her husband young. There was a vulnerability to her that I wanted to protect.\n \nTruly, I should have felt more guilty. But I didn’t. Serena, my petite blonde, no nonsense wife could not be more different from Katy and she really didn’t feel like the woman I married anymore. She was so distant and cold now. I can’t even remember why she changed and what happened, I just knew that my marriage was over. When Katy and I kissed at the office Christmas party, I knew that it was time I told my wife everything.\n \nBut when I finally worked up the courage to tell her that evening on the walk home, steeling myself for a terrible confrontation, I found Serena sitting at the kitchen table, her face in her hands, weeping over an open letter. I asked her what was wrong and she simply gestured to the letter. I lifted it up to read it and my mouth went dry. Breast cancer. Stage 3. I couldn’t tell my wife I was leaving her now. It would utterly destroy her. \n \nSo I did what I had to do. I told Katy about Serena’s diagnosis and she was heartbroken but understanding when I told her that we needed to break up.\n \nI supported Serena through immunotherapy and took over all cooking duties and cleaning duties. We ate the healthiest of meals, and I tried my very best to be the most supportive husband I could be but cancer was rough on Serena. She lost the spark in her eyes and grew gaunt, unable to keep any of the food down. When we returned to the doctor, he told us she was now at stage 4. This meant a course of deeply aggressive chemo. That night, I held Serena as she sobbed and told me she wasn’t sure she would make it through this.\n \nAnd then she asked me to help her die. \n\nI was stunned, unable to believe I had heard her right.\n\nI’ll never forget how she lifted her now gaunt face, looked me in the eyes and said, “Daniel. I want you to help me die. Please.”\n\nI was horrified. “I…I can’t do that.” I told her, the words barely making sense, I was so gobsmacked.\n\nBut she pleaded and pleaded. Finally, we made a pact. That if the cancer became too much for her to handle, I would give her the entire bottle of sleeping pills the doctor had assigned for her crushed up in her favourite ice cream. Even now, I feel numb just thinking about it.\n \nSerena however, knew exactly what she wanted and seemed very sure about it. Two weeks went by without us talking about it again, but honestly, fuck cancer. I have never watched a healthy human being deteriorate so fast. Finally, when the Doctor told us that the cancer had metastasised and moved to her lungs, she asked me to do the deed.\n \nSo that night, I bought her favourite ice cream and numbly crushed the pills up. Then I carried it up to her. She ate the ice cream slowly. My brave, clever wife who I had not appreciated in time was the most dignified woman when it came to death. Quietly, she smiled, thanked me and closed her eyes for the last time.\n \nI waited until the rattle in her chest stopped. And her breathing slowed to a halt. She looked peaceful for the first time in a long, long time. I knew she was gone.\n \nI walked downstairs to the living room and sat down on the sofa. Then I bawled my eyes out like a small child.\n \n*\n \nThe next day, I awoke still on the couch, a dull, cold realisation of what had happened the previous night. But then…I smelled coffee and bacon. I heard the sound system in the kitchen blasting with a cheerful pop song.\n\n“What the fuck?” \n\nI was immediately on my feet and I headed into the kitchen, heart racing. \n\nAnd there, happily humming to herself, was Serena.\n \nNot the Serena I left upstairs. Gaunt and hollowed out by illness. But my Serena. The Serena of before. \n\nShe smiled at me in a way she hadn’t for years. “’Morning, my darling. Here we go, bacon and eggs sunny side up.” She pushed a plate on the kitchen island in my direction and placed a cup of coffee before me.\n \nWhat the ever loving fuck was going on? I watched my dead wife cook up a storm and act like everything was completely fine. Like she hadn’t died last night. \n\n“Serena, what-”\n\nShe lifted her cup of coffee and took a big sip, eyes closing as though it was the most delicious thing she had ever tasted. “I know, my love.” She said, “I would be surprised too.”\n \n“You died last night.” I stated the obvious, I know but it was also the truth. She had been dead.\n \nShe nodded. “Yes, yes I know. And I was. Very dead. But that had to happen, you see because how else would I come back to life?”\n\nI did not like the sound of her bright voice suddenly. Something in the air felt…off. Something about all of this felt like the kind of decay you cannot see, just under a gleaming surface.\n \n“Don’t you see darling,” she told me casually, taking a bite of her toast. “I fell in love. I had to stay.”\n \nThis hit me like a ton of bricks and made me take a step back. “You…you what?”\n \n“Now, now, Daniel.” She said, wagging the piece of toast at me, “You aren’t the only one who is allowed to have fun. I thought this was a marriage of equals?“\n \nMy voice was now hoarse, even to my own ears, “I don’t know what you’re-”\n \n“DON’T FUCKING LIE TO ME!” she suddenly shouted, throwing her plate at me. I ducked just in time and flinched as it shattered.\n \n“Serena, please calm down…” I was trying so hard to keep my composure but it was getting harder and harder as I watched her. It struck me then that her movements were very odd. Sudden and strange.\n \nIt clicked into place when she reached for her coffee again. It was like…this was the first time she was wearing her body.\n\nI took a step back. “What is going on here.” I could hear the tremors of fear in my voice.\n \n“What’s going on, Daniel, is that I know about your tawdry little affair. In fact,” she smiled, horribly, a bit too wide. “I have known since the beginning. So I prayed to the darkness. I prayed to any terrible thing that was listening, and that was when he came to me. My own God of pain.”\n\nHer voice which had been Serena’s so far began to shift a little. Something about it felt like it was cracking. And then I heard it. A slow inhuman growl escaped her throat. Her eyes bulged. “Don’t you want to meet him, Daniel? The love of my life?”\n \nHer skin looked like it was ripping at the seams. Her mouth split open and a huge tongue and fangs fell out. “He really wants to meet you.”\n \nBefore I could scream, shout, run, anything, the thing that was wearing my wifes skin had filled our kitchen.\n \nIt was at least seven feet talk, its mouth more like a gash, too many fangs and that too long tongue. It’s body, oh God, its body was that of a rotting old man, buried long enough ago that the vile smell of decay filled the room. Its eyes were voids. Nothing inside them but eternal darkness. And the most terrifying thing of all was that it was looking at me…\n \n…and grinning.\n \nI stumbled backward turning to run but before I could, the thing reached out and grasped my left arm. I tried to snatch my arm back but before I could, I felt a sharp pain, like my arm was on fire and when I looked down, it was…\n \nMy arm…my arm looked like it belonged to an old man.  It had withered with just a single touch from that thing. I wrenched my arm out of its grip and ran to the door, only to find it locked. I pounded it on it hoping, praying the neighbours, SOMEONE would hear me, it was morning and someone would-\n \nI heard the cold, low chuckle behind me and my blood froze. Without even thinking, I turned and ran past it for the stairs, I could hear its slow shuddering footsteps behind me as I rushed up the stairs to the bedroom, throwing myself inside. Quickly I locked the door behind me and then ran to the window to get out. It didn’t budge so I tried to throw a window against the glass.\n \nIt. Wouldn’t. Break.\n \nA soft persistent knocking began on the door.\nI threw myself against the glass of the window and started banging on it. Downstairs my neighbour Greg was mowing his lawn. \n\nI shouted his name as loudly as I could and for a second he looked up. Relief flooded through me as I screamed “HELP ME!”\n \nBut Greg just frowned up as though…he couldn’t see me.\n \nI screamed louder, “GREG!!” as the knocking grew more persistent. “HELP ME!”\n \nBut he had already looked away and was back to mowing his lawn. I bashed those windows and yelled until my throat grew hoarse and finally, my knees gave way and I slumped to the floor.\n\nI’ve been here ever since. The day is slowly turning to twilight.\n\nOutside, the thing keeps knocking on the door. I can hear it shuffling softly back and forth.\n \nA voice that was once my wife’s but is now rotting and decayed filters into this slowly darkening bedroom.\n\n“Daniel, won’t you come out and play?”",

        "text": "It wasn't too long after moving into this house that I began to notice something strange. You see, a few months ago, I was offered a position with the company I work for as the new general manager of a branch opening up in a somewhat remote area of West Virginia. It might not sound that appealing to some of you, but a general manager's salary in Appalachia goes a lot further than a general employee's salary does in downtown Chicago. My one-bedroom apartment in Illinois was costing me more than three times the cost of the mortgage on my three-bedroom house here in Harper's Ferry. Regardless, I didn't have any personal ties keeping me in Chicago that were holding me back. No wife, no kids, no family in the area. I had been feeling a little claustrophobic being caught up in the rat race of the big city, and the idea of relocating to somewhere quieter with more space to myself sounded refreshing. Not to mention the nice promotion and salary increase that I was getting out of the deal.\n\nThe house isn't a mansion or anything, just a little two-story house on a small plot of land. There are other houses around, but they're quite spaced out a bit along a winding gravel back road that I live on. My nearest neighbors are the ones directly across from me, or at least, their driveway is directly across from mine. Their house actually sits back off the road quite a way, and I could just barely make out the shape of it past the trees that line their side of the street. They had come over to greet me on the day that I moved in, a sweet elderly couple with adult children that lived out of state. Both of them are retired and wanted to settle down somewhere that they could enjoy the peace and quiet of the mountains. And let me tell you, it is plenty quiet out here. Aside from the occasional car driving down the road or pack of roaming dogs meandering around, for the most part, there is almost no noise pollution whatsoever.\n\nMy first night here, after I had unloaded the rest of the boxes from my pickup truck, I just stood on my front porch and took a deep breath of the fresh mountain air. The only sound I could hear was the sound of the light wind rustling through the leaves high above me in the hundreds of trees surrounding the road in my property. I had never experienced something so peaceful and quiet living in the city, not even living in the suburbs as a kid with my parents decades ago. But there was also an unsettling quality to it. I guess for a city boy like me, the idea of the nearest person being at least half a mile away from you had put me on edge a bit. There's a comfort in knowing that if you needed help, you could just run outside your apartment and bang on your neighbor's door, or if you needed emergency services, there would probably be a station within a few city blocks of your location. The thought that if something happened to me, no one would likely find out about it for weeks always sat stewing in the back of my mind.\n\nI made a mental note at the time that I wanted to get a dog or a cat to keep me company. Now that I owned my place, I wasn't bound to the restrictions of pet deposits or leash laws anymore. I figured that it would be nice to have a little fluffy creature waiting for me when I got home from work every evening, or at least it would certainly break up the solitude of living by myself out in the countryside. Regardless, I settled in pretty quickly and was beginning to adjust to my new way of life faster than I first intended to. The opening of my job's new location went smoothly, and I was getting along pretty well with my new co-workers.\n\n(I put the rest of the story in the comment section.)",

        "author": "A_Vespertine",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/115s0wm/trolley_problems/",
        "text": "I stumbled out of an unlit hallway, recalling nothing of how I arrived there, just as I had countless times before. As always, my most recent memory was of my last ride on the trolley, vivid enough that a lingering, phantom agony still pervaded my once again whole and healthy body.\n\nThe old trolley station was now depressingly familiar to me. It was made almost entirely from mottled grey bricks, unevenly eroded by the slow trickle of leaking, fetid sewer water along their surface. Harsh yet faint incandescent bulbs caged against the walls and ceiling provided the only source of illumination, other than the garish backlight of an automated drink dispenser; our only source of sustenance, should we desire any.\n\nAt the edge of the rusted old tracks was a single iron bench, the kind they deliberately make uncomfortable so that the homeless won’t sleep on it. It was long enough to hold five people, and there were already four upon it. Since I was the last one needed to fill up the bench, I knew that the trolley would be coming soon.\n\nI recognized the man nearest to me, a heavy-set and dark-skinned man by the name of Gregory, as we had ridden together before. He was doing his best to remain stoic, but I could tell by the slight tremble of the coffee in his hand that he was dreading the oncoming trolley as much as I was. At the other end of the bench was a dishevelled middle-aged woman quietly sobbing to herself, and next to her was a younger woman who seemed more confused than frightened; almost certainly a first-timer.\n\nIn the middle of the bench sat a preteen girl with dark black eyes and wavy dark hair pulled back in a half-ponytail, wearing a red and white velvet dress, knee-high white socks and shiny, buckle-up shoes. It wasn’t just her age or her well-groomed appearance that set her apart from the rest of us, but the fact that she was happily swinging her legs and sipping at her hot chocolate as she waited for the trolley. She even gave me an enthusiastic wave as I approached the bench.\n\n“Hey, Max. Good to see you’re still keeping it together,” Gregory greeted me, raising his coffee cup slightly in a commiserative toast. “Ladies, this is Max. I’ve ridden with him before a few times. Max, this young lady next to me is Sara, and that there’s Desiree. The woman at the end isn’t talking though, and she’s got every right not to. We’ve got a kid with us today, which might boost our odds of being the surviving trolley. On the other hand, we’ve got a newcomer, and the committee will probably think she needs to pay her dues.”\n\n“Ah… hello there, Sara,” I said to the girl in the softest tone I could. “Is this your first time here?”\n\n“Nope. I’ve ridden the trolley lots of times!” she replied with an enthusiastic grin. I gave Gregory a bemused and horrified grimace, to which he merely shrugged in response.\n\n“Ah, hi. I’m sorry, but I still don’t understand what the hell is going on here,” Desiree interjected. “I must have gone into the wrong station, but when I tried to go back, I just ended up back here. It doesn’t make any sense.”\n\n“The only way out of here is on the trolley,” I explained to her patiently. “Passengers only come in through the hallways, not out. The trolley never comes until there are enough people to fill the bench, which varies each time. Never miss the trolley. If the trolley leaves and you’re not on it, the lights go out and you’re stranded here in pitch darkness. Then you’ll start hearing things. Whispers at first, but they get louder. They talk about you, but never to you, not even when they’re standing right in front of you. First, they’ll talk about how horrible you are and all the terrible things you’ve done, all your worst sins and secrets. Then they start talking about all the horrible things they’ll do to you as punishment once they finally find you. It’s such a bizarre and unnatural form of torment that you’re sure you must be in hell. Then the lights come back on, and…”\n\nThe older woman broke out into anguished wails, and I couldn’t bring myself to finish. I hope I didn’t need to finish.\n\n“Okay, you people are messing with me, right? This is some kind of hidden camera show or something?” Desiree asked in disbelief.\n\n“They’re in the tunnels too, but at least then you can escape for as long as you can see the light,” Gregory added, not bothering to try to debunk her skepticism.\n\n“And don’t think you can get out of riding the trolley by throwing yourself in front of it, either. Trying to take the easy way out will only make it harder on yourself,” Sara warned with an insidious smirk.\n\nBefore Desiree could ask her to clarify what she meant, we heard the god-awful screeching of the trolley as it pulled itself along its rusty cables, and saw its cyclopean, incandescent headlight in the gloom of the tunnel.\n\n“It’s here! Trolley’s here! Trolley’s here! Trolley’s here!” Sara screamed, excitedly bouncing up and down on the bench.\n\nSparks flew off both the overhead cables and the tracks as the trolley screeched itself to a stop in front of us, its flaking crimson paint hardly distinguishable from the rust underneath. The number five was just barely legible on its side. The doors slid open, and the woman at the end of the bench immediately raced through them, and the giggling young girl skipped along after her. With a heavy sigh, Gregory rose from the bench and trudged along after them. I patted him on the back as I followed, standing in the doorway as I waited for Desiree.\n\n“I understand why you’re skeptical, and why you wouldn’t necessarily want to board a death trap of a trolley with two strange men, an obviously disturbed woman and a possibly psychotic little girl, but the trolley really is the only way out of here,” I implored her. “If you stay, you’re going to find out the hard way why none of us would ever risk missing it again.”\n\nShe seemed to deliberate for a moment between the risks of being alone at the station or being trapped on the trolley with us, grudgingly settling on the latter. She hopped onto the trolley, and the instant I stepped out of the doors, they snapped shut. The blood-red interior was in slightly better condition than the exterior, the space above the windows plastered with ads for things I’d never heard of like *CODE NIGHTMARE REGENT RED* energy drink, *Satin Stag Cigarettes*, and *Stygian’s Classic Pizzeria*.\n\n“Buckle up, and be sure you’re able to hold onto something,” I advised Desiree as I sat across the aisle from Gregory. The older woman had curled up into a fetal position at the back, and Sara had claimed the front seat for herself.\n\n“Wait, what? What’s going to happen?” Desiree asked, the alarm obvious in her cracking voice. Before I could answer, the trolley’s speaker system crackled to life.\n\n“Good evening, passengers, and thank you once again for choosing *Gedanken Express* – turning philosophical thought experiments into real-life atrocities for far too long,” a soothingly smooth male voice announced in an old-fashioned cadence, exhaling like he was smoking a cigarette. “I’ll be your conductor for this evening, and for anyone who hasn’t boarded their trolley yet, this is last call. That’s right, newbie on Platform Three, I’m talking to you. You’re sure you don’t want to get on now? No? That’s fine. That just means a previous trolley-dodger gets your ticket for next time. I’m sure they’ll be thrilled.”\n\nWith a loud pneumatic hiss, the trolley began slowly chugging down the track and into the tunnel.\n\n“For anyone riding *Gedanken Express* for the first time today, or any of our regulars in need of a refresher, there are ten trolleys on the tracks, each with a varying number of passengers,” the Conductor explained. “Every one of our passengers has had both their Kantian and Utilitarian moral value quantified by the infallible experts on our award-winning Ethics Committee. And if you take issue with your ranking, tough cookies. You’re not an award-winning ethicist, now are you? Actually, I can see we do have an ethicist on tonight’s roster. That’s part of what makes this so fun! While half the trolleys are ‘controls’ filled with random people, the other half are filled with passengers deliberately chosen to confound the system. Tonight, for example, I can see that Trolley Number Nine is filled with genetically identical clones of Adolf Hitler, but none of whom have any actual history of violence or extremism. Don’t ask me where we got them; that’s not my department.\n\n“At multiple junctures along your journey, I will be required to choose which trolley must be sacrificed to ensure the survival of the others, until there’s only one trolley left. I can base my decision on each trolley’s net moral value, either Kantian or Utilitarian, or average moral value, or which individual is most or least deserving of surviving, or maybe none of the above. But I will tell you this; when in doubt, I pull the lever, since that’s usually the correct answer to a trolley problem.\n\n“Please keep in mind that while this isn’t a social experiment per se, any attempt by passengers to sway the odds in their favour or take out the competition will result in me making *ad hoc* deductions to their moral scores, decreasing their overall chance of survival. I realize these experiments can be stressful, but keep in mind that you’re doing it for science. Or philosophy, rather; which is just as important as science, I’m pretty sure. Try to be good sports about it, and remember that even if you don’t make it, there’s always next time.”\n\n“Wait, how is there a next time? He’s going to kill us, isn’t he?” Desiree demanded.\n\n“Then he brings us back. Don’t ask us how,” Gregory explained. “We just stumble back onto the trolley platform like it never happened, just so that we can do it all over again.”\n\n“Over and over and over again!” Sara cheered, bouncing in her seat as the woman in the back sobbed to herself.\n\nWe emerged from the tunnel out of the side of an impossibly tall stone wall, out across a vast wilderness of sharp rocks and ragged gullies far below. We were held aloft solely by a pair of steel cables strung up by wobbly wooden poles, racing alongside several other trollies to either side of us.\n\n“What the hell?” Desiree asked as she peered out across the unfamiliar landscape, no doubt at a loss as to where we were or how we had gotten here.\n\n“Isn’t it cool? It’s just like we’re flying, except if the cable snaps we’ll fall to an instant fiery death!” Sara exclaimed. “Hey, can anyone see the Hitler clones? I want to see the Hitler clones!”\n\n“I find it best not to look at the other trolleys,” I replied, though I was speaking more to Desiree than to Sara.\n\n“Same,” Gregory nodded.\n\n“Sorry passengers, but it looks like we’ve already run into our first trolley problem,” the Conductor informed us. “Seems like there’s not enough power for all of us. That’s funny, since it’s more of an engineering problem than a moral one. I’m just going to have to ditch the heaviest trolley; moral worth of its occupants be damned. Trolley Number Seven; you’re out. And before anyone there goes fat-shaming anyone, it has nothing to do with the passengers. Even completely empty, Seven’s just a big old clunker. Nothing but bad luck. Such a tragedy.”\n\nWe heard the distinctive sound of a mechanical lever being pulled, and Trolley Number Seven plummeted down to the sinister land below, smashing open upon the murderous rocks.\n\n“Don’t worry folks; even if they didn’t all die on impact, the local wildlife will make quick work of them,” the Conductor assured us. “And now that they can’t hear us, I’ll admit that I did pick the trolley with the most fat people to maximize the amount of food the scavengers would get. On a related note, if anyone here familiar with trolley problems is wondering, you can’t actually stop a runaway trolley by pushing a fat person in front of it. Believe me, we’ve tried!\n\n“Anyway, now that we have plenty of power, we can afford to speed things up a bit. Everyone hold on tight, now.”\n\nWe were all thrown back in our seats as the trolleys suddenly shot forward, the cables weaving around rocky outcroppings and other obstacles almost like a rollercoaster, a resemblance that only the ever-effervescent Sara seemed to appreciate.\n\n“Folks, if you’ll be so kind as to look out to your right, you’ll see *Gedanken Express’s* pride and joy; our very own Euthanasia Coaster,” the Conductor bragged. “A five hundred meter drop – the tallest in the world – followed by seven progressively smaller inversions subjects passengers to a full minute of ten gees, which invariably proves fatal. It’s the ride of a lifetime, if you’ll pardon the pun, but there’s one little problem; no one’s riding it! Why, this is going to be terrible for the economy! I’m afraid one of you is going to have to go for a spin to drum up some business! Since it’s a Euthanasia Coaster, I suppose I should send the trolley with either the lowest quality of life or shortest life expectancy to keep up appearances… but since it is the most humane death on offer tonight, maybe it should go to the trolley that deserves to suffer the least? Decisions, decisions.”\n\n“The Euthanasia Coaster is awesome!  Everyone should get a chance to go on it!” Sara opined. “I think the trolley with the fewest people that have already ridden the coaster should be the one to ride it.”\n\n“Passengers… one of you just made a very thoughtful suggestion, and I think I like it,” the Conductor proclaimed with glee. “No one on Trolley Number Four has ever been on the Euthanasia Coaster before, and there’s a first time for everything. Enjoy the ride while it lasts!”\n\nAnother lever was pulled, and Trolley Number Four was diverted to the dazzling and monstrous roller coaster looming on the horizon.\n\n“No need for the rest of you to feel left out though. We’ve got plenty of chills, thrills, and kills left in store!” the Conductor promised. “If you look straight ahead, you’ll see that we’re just about to run out of cable. That’s okay, because you’re all carrying enough momentum to make it across the gap to the tracks on the other side. The bad news is that there are eight trolleys left, but only seven tracks across the gap. One of you isn’t going to make it. Which one should it be now? I could just pick the trolley with the fewest passengers, but if I play that card now it might just make for harder choices down the line. Yes, yes, I can hear you shouting ‘Hitler Trolley’, Number Three. Hmmm, what’s it called when you base someone’s moral worth solely on their genetic heritage? You know what? For your unabashed bigotry, I’m making an *ad hoc* deduction to your score. Trolley Number Three is off the rails!”\n\nA lever was pulled, and almost immediately we ran out of cable and were sent arcing through the air. Despite what the Conductor had said, there were in fact eight sets of tracks, but Number Three’s had a large metal barrier erected in front of it that read *‘Out of Order’*. Trolley Number Three crashed right into the barrier in a fiery explosion, and that was the last the rest of us saw of it as we sped along down our respective tracks.\n\n“They also could have just shared a set of rails with one of us,” Gregory muttered.\n\n“That’s not really in the spirit of ‘trolley problems’,” Sara chastised him.\n\nThough I knew the worst was yet to come, I couldn't help but feel a bit relieved that we were on solid ground again. All the remaining trolleys continued chugging along down the winding tracks, which took us into a foreboding-looking pine forest.\n\n“Oh oh. Don’t look now, passengers, but I think we’re being followed,” the Conductor informed us. Despite his warning, we all looked out the rear window and saw a single handcar barrelling down the tracks, its two-man team furiously working the pump to catch up with us. “Bandits! In a manually-powered handcar! They’ll overtake us for sure! We surely can’t trust them to pick the most morally acceptable trolley to raid, so we’ll have to let one fall behind so the rest of us can escape! I’m torn between picking the trolley with the best chance of defending itself and the one least likely to offer any resistance at all. It’s just two bandits, after all. If you don’t fight back and give them what they want, they might not hurt anybody. But maybe they’d rather not leave any witnesses, and standing your ground is the only just way to deal with scofflaws like these. What do you say, Trolley Number Eight? Do you big strong gents think you can handle these nare-do-wells, or would you rather I let some kiddies and old women beg for mercy? Eh? What’s that? No, of course, *you* can’t try begging for mercy, you coward! Time to grow a pair, Trolley Number Eight!”\n\nWith another pull of a lever, Trolley Number Eight began to slow down. Within seconds, the bandits had boarded it from the rear, and they were still close enough that we could clearly hear each bandit rapidly empty their revolvers into the passengers before they ever had a chance to land a blow themselves.\n\n“Ah well. You know what they say. God made all men, but Samuel Colt made all men equal,” the Conductor quipped in a tone that implied he thought he was being very profound. “At least they didn’t die for nothing. Those bandits will never catch us now. With them behind us, we can focus on what’s ahead of us, like that railway crossing. Wow, that highway looks pretty busy. Shouldn’t the crossing lights have come on by now? Everyone just hold on a minute, please. I need to check something. Well, isn’t this just the worst of luck; the railway crossing lights are out! I don’t think those motorists are going to see us coming in time. I’m going to have to send one of you ahead into oncoming traffic. One train wreck should be enough to bring traffic to a halt, and the rest of us can just breeze on by. So, who’s it going to be?”\n\n“This is insane. Does anyone ever make it to the end?” Desiree asked, her gaze transfixed on the torrent of vehicles running perpendicular to us, a collision both imminent and unavoidable.\n\n“There’s no way to know. I run into at least one new passenger every few rides, so they’re regularly bringing new people on,” Gregory replied without raising his head, his hands gripping the seat in front of him as he braced for the worst. “Whether that means they’re letting people go or just collecting us like bottle caps, I couldn’t tell you. But I’ve never met anyone who claimed to have made it to the end and got put back on a trolley, so there’s that small bit of hope.”\n\n“Passengers, I’m going to be upfront with you. On paper, this is a pretty straightforward trolley problem, and I should just send the trolley with either the fewest people or the lowest net moral value into traffic,” the Conductor said. “However, I’m getting a little tired of the actual ethicist in Trolley Number Ten thinking he’s better than me and telling me what to do! Here’s a lesson for you, Number Ten; moralizing at the person holding your life in their hands is never the right choice!”\n\nThe Conductor pulled another lever, and Trolley Number Ten shot ahead of the rest of us. The instant it made it to the highway, it was t-boned by a transport truck and plowed right off the tracks. The car behind the truck slammed on its brakes and caused a multi-vehicle pile-up. The truck itself started careening sideways, slamming into several other vehicles before skidding to a halt, its massive tank of oil exploding into a raging inferno upon impact. To either side of the tracks, there was nothing but wailing and bloodied bodies trying to claw their way out of flaming and mangled wreckage, but the tracks themselves were now safe for us to cross.\n\n“So beautiful!” Sara gushed as she gleefully gawked out at the carnage as we rode by, the sanguine firelight reflecting in her wonderstruck eyes.\n\n“I think that little accident killed more motorists than trolley passengers. I bet they’re regretting not taking the trolley now!” the Conductor mocked them. “Hopefully the next time we put them back on a platform, they’ll make better choices.\n\n“Well passengers, that’s five trolley problems down. That means there are just four more to go. By making it this far, you’ve proven to be more morally valuable than average! You should be very proud! And hopeful! Even if you don’t make it out this time, the odds are in your favour that you’ll make it sooner rather than later.”\n\n“Don’t let him get your hopes up, Desiree. I’ve made it to the halfway point more often than not, and I’ve lost count of how many trolley rides I’ve been on,” I cautioned her.\n\n“Passengers, I don’t want to alarm you, but I’ve just received a message from the Ethics Committee,” the Conductor said in a hushed tone. “It seems that bombs have been planted aboard each trolley by *terrorists* – not real ideological or ethnocentric extremists, though. More like the kind you’d see in an eighties movie. Anyway, the only way for them to figure out how to disarm them is for me to intentionally set one of them off. Don’t ask me how, though. I’m not an explosives expert – just an enthusiast! Oh, these trolley problems are getting tougher now, aren’t they? I just said that you were all of above-average moral value. None of you really seem to deserve to live or die more than anyone else here. In that case, I guess the only ethical choice is to pick a trolley at random, since killing some of you is better than letting all of you die. However…”\n\nThe Conductor pulled a lever, and Trolley Number Nine exploded, bouncing off the tracks slightly before capsizing altogether.\n\n“And boom goes the dynamite! I just killed five Hitlers!” he boasted. “I know, I know, that’s a little hypocritical because of what I said earlier, but come on! In what moral dilemma is killing five Hitlers the wrong choice? Besides, ‘killed five Hitlers’ will look great on my CV – as long as I don’t go into too many details. I’m going to update that now, actually.”\n\n“Have any of ever tried just breaking the door and jumping out?” Desiree demanded, her head rapidly swivelling between all the windows in the hopes of getting some early warning of the next horror we would be facing.\n\n“It’s not easy, unless the trolley problem requires us to go outside,” Gregory explained. “But even when you make it out, and survive the jump, you never make it for long out there. It’s not just the trolleys that are unnatural, it’s this whole place. Even if you get off the tracks, there’s no escape. And if you become a trolley-dodger, they’ll put you on the motorway or worse until there’s a spare ticket for you. The only hope is making it to the end of the line.”\n\nDesiree looked like she wanted to object, but didn’t know what to say. The surreal horror of a situation was difficult to process, and I don’t fault her one bit for not knowing how to react. If anything, she was doing better than I did my first ride. She turned back towards the front window, a bewildered and terrified expression overtaking her when she saw what was next for us.\n\n“What the hell is that?” she demanded, pointing to the shark-finned, SS-emblazoned airship hovering in the distance.\n\n“Yes! Nazi Zeppelin! Nazi Zeppelin! Nazi Zeppelin! We made it to the Nazi Zeppelin!” Sara cheered, bouncing in her seat again.\n\n“Hey again, passengers. I’m… genuinely sorry for this one. I know these trolley problems tend to get a little more absurd the longer they go on for,” the Conductor said in a tone that sounded, if not apologetic, then at least sorry it was happening to him. I heard some ice clinking, and I presumed he was taking a drink of something alcoholic. “Ahh. Let me just try to read the nonsense the Ethics Committee gave me for this one. So, the SS Command is not happy that I killed their Hitler clones, despite their refusal to participate in any Nazi atrocities, and now they’ve come to avenge their loss. Just goes to show that even making the most ethical choices can have negative consequences if they piss off unethical people. The Zeppelin’s going to blitzkrieg us as we drive under them, and because when all you have are trolleys everything looks like a trolley problem, I’m supposed to elevate one of the tracks into a ramp to send one of you flying into it, destroying it Hindenburg-style. So, yeah – apparently Heinrich Himmler is on that thing. The memo in front of me doesn’t explicitly mention time travel, but I can only assume this is a time travelling trolley problem. I’m not sure if I’m only supposed to be considering the impact of destroying a trolley or all the ramifications throughout the timeline here. So… I’m legitimately pulling a lever at random this time. No matter what trolley I pick, Himmler goes up in flames. And a one, and a two, and a five, and a six!”\n\nA lever was pulled, the track in front of Trolley Number Six rose up on a forty-five-degree angle, and *Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture* began playing over the speakers. The trolley went sailing through the air and collided straight with the Zeppelin, causing the hydrogen-filled balloon to ignite and engulf the entire airship in flames. The burning wreck rapidly descended to the ground, frantic screaming and angry German expletives still audible over the roaring fire and classical music, and we were just able to make it to the other side before it crashed.\n\n“Oh, the humanity!” the Conductor lamented theatrically. “Okay, despite my reservations about the set-up, that was admittedly pretty amazing. It was a good enough spectacle to sacrifice a random trolley for, at any rate. Rot in pieces, Heinrich. Rot in pieces.”\n\n“Wow! Four explosions, two of them pretty big ones, and we got to see the Nazi Zeppelin! This is such a good trolley ride!” Sara gushed.\n\n“What the hell is the matter with that kid?” Desiree whispered to me.\n\n“Never seen her before,” I whispered back. “But… there are worse coping strategies than that, I suppose.”\n\n“All right passengers, listen closely now. This penultimate trolley problem gets a little complicated,” the Conductor announced. “Three other trolleys on a set of tracks perpendicular to us left their station at precisely 3:43 PM Mountain Standard Time. Each is transporting live human organs for medical transplantation and is thus travelling at maximum speed and will not slow down for any reason. The slowest trolley is moving at seventy-three percent the speed of the fastest trolley, which is moving at a hundred-and-twelve percent the speed of the middle trolley. The fastest trolley is carrying the organs with the shortest shelf-life, and the slowest trolley the longest. However, the shelf-life of the organs does not necessarily correlate with their moral or economic value or that of their intended recipients. We also need to factor in the carbon footprint of each trolley and the potential labour rights violations of the railroad –”\n\n“Bear!” Desiree screamed.\n\nI looked out the front window and saw an enormous Kodiak bear charging down the tracks, growling furiously at us. As we whizzed past, it took a swipe at Trolley Number One, knocking it clean off the tracks. The bear immediately pounced upon it and clawed it open like a tin can, savagely mauling its occupants as they screamed and struggled to escape.\n\n“Huh. That wasn’t a trolley problem, passengers. That was just a random bear attack,” the Conductor informed us. “I guess that no matter how much you try to control for every variable, some things are just outside of anyone’s ability to predict or control for. Also, them bears are mighty strong when they’re hungry, ain’t they? In any event, the loss of Trolley Number One renders that whole trolley problem moot, so I guess that means it’s time to pick a winner! I mean, survivor.”\n\nWe rounded a bend, and in the distance ahead of us we could see a tunnel built into the side of a mountain, its entrance obstructed by some fallen boulders.\n\n“There it is, passengers; the way out,” the Conductor told us. “Unfortunately, there’s been an avalanche. The first trolley to hit it should be enough to clear the tracks, but it will surely be derailed in the process. It seems cruel that you both should make it within sight of the exit but only one gets to go through it. Trolley Number Two is ahead of Number Five, but I can change that with the pull of a lever, and you all know my policy on pulling levers!”\n\n“Haven’t made it this far since my first ride. The bastard likes to get the newbies’ hopes up, that’s for sure,” Gregory said.\n\n“If I don’t see you again Desiree, remember to never miss a trolley,” I stressed to her. “I know that dying over and over again is Hell, but what waits for you on those platforms isn’t any better.”\n\nShe looked at me with horrified, tear-filled eyes, and we all just waited for the sound of the lever being pulled that would signal our end.\n\nBut it never came. Trolley Number Two stayed in the lead and crashed into the boulders, clearing them from the tracks before toppling off itself. We rode right by it, disappearing into the blackness of the tunnel before us.\n\n“What?” the woman at the back of the bus croaked, the first thing I had ever heard her say.\n\n“And we have a winner!” the Conductor proclaimed, though I think were all still more incredulous than relieved at making it to the end. “I know I said that I always pull the lever, but today the Head of the Ethics Committee wanted to ride to the end. Remember passengers, the true answer to any trolley problem you may face is whatever the boss says it is.”\n\nDesiree understandably looked at me and Gregory with suspicion, but we both knew that neither of us could have been the one behind the trolley system. Technically, I suppose it could have been Desiree, or even the woman in the back, but Gregory and I didn’t even entertain that thought for an instant. We both looked straight ahead to the person sitting in the front seat, the only person the Conductor had ever listened to, the only person we had ever seen enjoy the trolley ride, and the only one of us who didn’t seem surprised by what was happening now.\n\nBefore we could decide how to react to this revelation, the trolley emerged from the tunnel at what looked like a train station in the real world.\n\n“We’re out,” Gregory murmured, a tear rolling down his cheek. “We’re actually out.”\n\n“That’s right passengers, and thank you for riding the *Gedanken Express*!” the Conductor said as the trolley slowed to a stop. “You made a real contribution to the field of moral philosophy and you should be very proud. While your phone plans may have lapsed, all your devices should be fully charged and capable of making emergency calls. Any changes to the timeline you may notice are most likely the result of me killing Heinrich Himmler. Let's hope that was worth it. Please exit the trolley in an orderly fashion, and have a pleasant evening. We hope you’ll ride with us again someday.”\n\nWith that foreboding farewell, the trolley came to a full stop and the doors slid open. The woman in the back immediately bolted through them, screaming and weeping as she ran across the platform. Gregory was next, followed by Desiree, neither wanting to miss their chance at escape. I was last, but as soon as I had one foot on the platform and one hand on the door, I paused. I looked at the front of the trolley, where Sara was still sitting, still smiling. I felt rage boiling up inside me, and as much as I wanted to get as far away from her as possible, some part of me demanded justice for everything I and every other passenger had been through.\n\n“Why?” I demanded, the word coming out as a barely intelligible guttural growl. It didn’t matter to me then that she was a little girl, or had taken the form of a little girl; I wanted to smash her skull against the window until there was nothing recognizably human left.\n\n“I like it when people die,” she replied in the same innocent tone of voice she’d had the entire trolley ride. “My senses are much better than yours, so I experience the fear and pain of every death in every trolley in magnificent detail. And not just the trolleys; I have other playsets besides this one. But I don’t like *killing* people, because then I can’t play with them anymore. So, I bring them back, good as new, and I get to watch them die all over again. I know it hurts you, but it makes me far happier, so everything's right in the end. I'm what philosophers call a Utility Monster, and that is my professional conclusion as the Head of the Ethics Committee. And I'm still nice to people, sometimes. My favourites get promoted from playthings to playmates and get to live forever with me, but the rest I usually just let go when they get too worn out from dying so much. It wouldn't be right to keep them after they stopped making me happy. Catch and release, you could say. I’ve watched you die enough now, so you’re free to go. Honest. Thank you for making me so happy.”\n\n“Well, aren’t you a *darling*,” I hissed under my breath, seething as my desperate need for freedom and safety clashed with my apoplectic desire for revenge.\n\nAnd then, she laughed. She just started laughing as if I had inadvertently made some hilarious joke or pun, and it was the sound of that laughter that finally made me run. It invoked some kind of primordial fear in me, and I knew there was no sense in attacking her. Her small form was brimming with otherworldly and unholy powers, and there was nothing I could do to oppose her, so I ran. I ran out of that trolley and back into the world I belong in, never to set foot in a train station again for as long [as](https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/) [I](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/) [live](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVespersBell/).",

        "text": " \n\nThe atmosphere was thick with an ominous energy, and I could feel an unexplainable sense of dread that was growing with each step I took closer. The once-grand building loomed over me, its walls covered in ivy and its windows boarded up. As I pushed my way through the overgrown garden and up to the entrance, I noticed that the air was thick with a musty, damp scent that made my skin crawl.\n\nAs I made my way through the first few rooms, I saw that the place was indeed grand, with high ceilings, intricate moldings, and beautiful antique furniture that had been left to decay. The hallways were dimly lit, with flickering candles casting long shadows on the walls. I could hear strange noises coming from one of the rooms, like a faint whisper that seemed to be calling out to me.\n\nI followed the whispers to a dark room, where a group of people were gathered in a circle, chanting in an unknown language. In the center of the room, there was a strange, otherworldly creature. It was a mass of writhing tentacles, with glowing eyes that seemed to penetrate my very soul. It spoke to me in a language that was both familiar and alien, promising me knowledge beyond my wildest dreams.\n\nI was fascinated and repulsed by the creature, but I couldn't look away. It beckoned me closer, and I felt a strange pull towards it. As I stared into its eyes, I felt my mind being pulled into a non-Euclidean space, where the laws of physics and geometry no longer applied. It was like being sucked into a vortex of impossible shapes and colors, where my mind was stretched to its limits.\n\nAs I struggled to maintain my sanity, I realized that the creature was not alone. There were other creatures, lurking in the shadows, watching me with their glowing eyes. They were ancient, beyond human comprehension, and they hungered for knowledge and power.\n\nThe creatures made me an offer, promising me unimaginable knowledge and power in exchange for my allegiance. I knew it was a dangerous bargain, but I was also drawn to the promise of knowledge and power. I hesitated for a moment, unsure of what to do, and that was when I saw her.\n\nShe was beautiful, with long dark hair and deep brown eyes that sparkled in the dim light. She was dressed in a white gown, and she seemed to be looking directly at me. I felt a strange connection to her, as if I had known her for years.\n\nAs I stared at her, the creatures began to close in, their tentacles reaching out towards me. I realized that I had to make a choice. I could either join the creatures and gain untold knowledge and power, or I could resist them and risk being consumed by their eldritch energies.\n\nI took a step back, away from the creatures, and reached out towards the girl. As I touched her hand, I felt a surge of power flow through me, and the creatures recoiled in horror. It was as if the girl had the power to banish them with a single touch.\n\nShe smiled at me, and I knew that I had made the right choice. Together, we walked out of the mansion, leaving the creatures behind. As we stepped out into the sunlight, I felt a sense of relief wash over me. I knew that I had narrowly avoided a fate worse than death, and that I owed everything to the girl who had saved me.\n\nBut as we walked away from the mansion, I couldn't shake the feeling that something",

        "text": "  \n\nTo be honest, I’m not sure if writing this is a good idea. \n\nIt’s been close to four months since everything happened, and at times, it still feels like a bad dream, one I need to shake off and forget. But I know that if I don’t at least try to tell the truth now, I’ll regret it for the rest of my life, however short it may be. I can’t fit the full account into one cohesive segment, thanks to the word limits of this site, so I’ll just have to try and get it all out there one day at a time. I doubt anyone will believe me, but I’m used to that by now.\n\nIt all started last October, when I still worked as a tour guide for the New Wilderness Wildlife Reserve. I’d stayed late to help clean up in the kitchens, after volunteering to work concessions in place of a girl who came down with the flu. With the last of the guests gone for the night, I stood at the big industrial-grade sink and wiped the last of the dishes dry, before lugging the stack of clean plates, bowls, and cups toward their rightful places on the stainless-steel shelves. Both of my feet hurt from standing on them all day, and a small knot had formed in the small of my back, but still, I smiled.\n\n*Never thought I’d be happy to scrub salad bowls.*\n\nMy second year at New Wilderness had been amazing, and I couldn’t wait to come back next season. Everything about the little park was perfect, from the adorable animals, friendly coworkers, and surprisingly healthy food to the picturesque rural Ohio landscape. Since my first interview in the year prior, I’d done some tours on the regular safari buses, as well as odd jobs around the facility, without discovering a single thing that made me want to quit. Even kitchen duty at the hilltop café turned out to be way more fun than I’d expected. I’d learned to bake bread from scratch, and Casandra, my 40-year-old supervisor who knew every knife, pot, and pan like the back of her hand, praised my culinary talent to the skies.\n\n“See you later Maddie.” Casandra shouted over the stove exhaust fans with her usual happy-go-lucky cheer as I walked out the door to the door to the parking lot. “Good job today. You were a big help.”\n\n“Thanks. Have a good night, Casandra.” I chirped back and let myself give out a contented sigh.\n\n*I love my job.*\n\nIn the darkened parking lot, a cool breeze brushed past my face. It promised to be a beautiful fall night, the wind blowing in from the west, the stars twinkling into view as the last of the sunlight faded, and a crescent moon beamed down from above. Few cars were left atop the ridge where the visitor center stood. My own little blue sedan, its paint chipped and peeling, waited for me, and I silently hoped it would start. Dad had been having issues with its starter, but it hadn’t acted up in a few days.\n\n*Here’s to hoping that record holds.*\n\nI unlocked my car door to climb in and caught sight of a familiar black SUV pulling up the hill, the words *Park Ranger* stickered to the side.\n\nMy pulse jumped, the smile on my face melted into a grimace, and a twinge of nervousness knifed through my chest. It could be Randy, I told myself, or Danial, or Phillis, any of the other night guards. It didn’t have to be *him* just because I was here.\n\nThe SUV rolled through the parking lot, and the driver spotted me, his casual grin unmistakable.\n\n*Oh no.*\n\nHot embarrassment flooded through my cheeks at the lanky silhouette who put the SUV in park and climbed out to saunter over to me. The night had been going so well, and it didn’t have to end like this. After all, he wasn’t within voice range yet. If I wanted to, I could pretend not to see him, jump into my car, hide my face, and floor it for home. He wouldn’t know for sure that I didn’t have somewhere important to be, and I could avoid the awkward conversation, maybe even put it off for another five-month winter-season.\n\nYet despite my brain begging me to leave, I stayed, and put on what I hoped to be a friendly smile to hide my anxiety.\n\nFrom four feet away, Mark hooked his thumbs into his jacket pockets, and rested one hip against my car’s front fender. “Hey stranger. Long time no see. How’ve you been?”\n\nMark Petric and I had met during my first year at the reserve’s Carnivore Cove in between breaks on our tour bus routes. He was nice, smart yet easy to talk to, and he never seemed uninterested in anything I had to say. As it turned out, it was his first year too, and like me, he had already fallen in love with New Wilderness. Despite being surrounded by strangers, Mark went out of his way to include people into the conversation who wouldn’t have stood a chance on their own, told self-deprecating jokes to draw fire away from anyone who felt singled out, and in general played the part of a peacekeeper between difficult personalities when tensions flared. He always acted with unfailing kindness toward me, and I considered him to be a good friend. We exchanged contact information, and I enjoyed having someone to chat with in between sessions of Skyrim in my after-work hours.\n\nThen, three months later Mark texted me, and asked me to dinner. To be honest, I’d seen it coming, could tell by how often he’d messaged me, how happy he was whenever I responded. A few other guys at previous jobs had also shown interest in me, and while Mark was *definitely* better mannered than them, it was still obvious. I knew it was a scenario that other girls at New Wilderness would have welcomed with glee, but for me, a knot formed in my gut the moment I saw his dinner invitation pop up on my phone.\n\nI had sat on my bed, put my head in my hands, and fought waves of nausea, because in that moment, I knew that I didn’t have feelings for him, not the slightest romantic spark. Mark was my friend, one I really enjoyed spending time with, and I didn’t want to lose our friendship. But I couldn’t leave that text unanswered forever.\n\nSo, I did what I knew was right. I let him down as easy as I possibly could.\n\nMark took it really well, said he still wanted to stay friends, and we even talked some more after, though eventually the conversations died out due to my lack of enthusiastic replies. Though relieved to have it over with, I felt awful for weeks afterward, knowing that my rejection had hurt him deeply. He was a great guy, but I just couldn’t bear the thought of going out with Mark, only to have to dump him later when I still didn’t feel any different, and see that pain etch itself over his face.\n\nPerhaps that’s why, when Mark announced his engagement to another girl at the beginning of this year, a little of the guilt lifted from my shoulders. He’d been a bundle of giddy smiles when I’d overheard him talking to one of the other tour guides about his fiancé, and I wanted to be happy for him.\n\nI *wanted* to, anyway.\n\n“I’m fine.” I bobbed my head like a doll on an old truck dashboard, wishing I could dig the shame from my chest like an unwanted parasite, and stomp it on the ground. “You?”\n\nMark’s cocoa brown eyes seemed to see right through my nervous façade, and he made an apologetic half-smile. “I’m good. You in a hurry? I don’t want to keep you.”\n\nThose last few words stung more than I expected them to, and I almost winced. Part of the reason I couldn’t be relieved, happy, or calm around Mark Petric was because even though I still thought of him as nothing more than a friend, deep inside my selfish heart, I’d felt sick the moment he said the word ‘engaged’. One of my big goals was to find the love of my life, settle down with him, and have lots of kids in a nice cottage in the countryside. I’d confessed as much during our early conversations, before Mark revealed his feelings for me. While him moving on was a big relief, something inside me panicked at the thought that I may have thrown away my one chance to find the happiness I’d been dreaming of. That selfish despair left me plagued with shame every time I thought of him, because I still saw Mark as a friend, yet felt a hollow sadness at him finding someone else.\n\n*No Mark, you definitely don’t want to keep me.*\n\n“Maddie?” His soft voice broke me from my ashen thoughts.\n\nI looked up to find Mark staring with sympathetic eyes.\n\n“Look, I just wanted to say hi. Did I make this weird?”\n\nWishing I had an invisibility cloak, I shook my head, conscious of how my frizzy auburn ponytail swished against my neck. “I’m just tired. I was in the kitchens all day today. My feet feel like they’re on fire.”\n\nHis warm grin returned, and Mark threw me a wink. “Making more of those amazing cupcakes?”\n\nOf course he remembered my strawberry upside-down cupcakes. I’d made them for one company picnic, and Mark complimented me to no end for it. Everyone had liked them, but looking back, it left a bittersweet taste in my mouth at the way Mark had tried my cupcakes first out of all the other delicious desserts there.\n\n“Homemade bread.” I leaned against my card door, grateful for its support to hide my shaking hands. “The cupcakes are for special occasions.”\n\nSilence reigned between us, broken only the groaning wind that creaked through the distant trees. It seemed as though even the weather could see into my guilty heart and growled at me in judgment. I couldn’t raise my eyes to Mark’s, a sudden jolt of embarrassing memory coursing through me at the thing’s he’d said last year, and how they hurt to think about now.\n\n*You’re really talented.*\n\n*You’re coming back next year, right?*\n\n*You’re one in a million, Madison Cromwell.*\n\n“Cool.” Mark shuffled his feet and rubbed the back of his neck. “Well . . . it was good to see you. Drive safe, Maddie.”\n\nI couldn’t hide my flinch this time, and realized I’d effectively shut down the conversation by not talking more. “You don’t have to . . . I mean . . .”\n\n“No, it’s fine, I have to lock up the sign-in office anyway.” He held up his hands in friendly disengagement, but I could sense the wounds behind Mark’s expression. I’d rejected him, he’d gotten over me, and now I was ghosting him in person like some toxic social media troll.\n\n*I should have just driven away.*\n\nMy mouth opened, though I had no idea what I was going to say, since my self-hating musings blocked any constructive sentences.\n\n*Boom.*\n\nMark and I both almost jumped out of our skins, and I glanced up to see the sky above roil with pitch black clouds, flickers of lightning snaking in between. The weather hadn’t called for rain, much less what looked to be a thunderstorm of seismic proportions. Inky black clouds smothered the stars, a colder, harsher breeze caught the wind, and I shivered under my green ripstop jacket. It was as if some gargantuan black beast had sprung out of nowhere and devoured the beautiful night from before.\n\n“Whoa.” I blurted at a few icy raindrops that began to plink down around me. “Where did that come from?”\n\nMark didn’t speak, and I swiveled my head to repeat my question.\n\nThe question faded from my mind, and instead, I felt my skin crawl.\n\nHis dark eyes were fixed on the sky, and I saw something in Mark’s gaze that I’d never seen before; deep, abysmal fear.\n\n“Mark?” I rasped out, wondering if I should call my dad and ask him to come get me with his big four-wheel drive truck.\n\nMark’s jaw worked, and his adam’s apple floated up and down with each nervous swallow. “Which way do you usually go home?”\n\nAcidic worry wriggled through my veins, and I pointed in the same direction as where the storm originated. “I take High Road onto Bethesda Ridge, and straight from there to 142.”\n\n“Don’t tonight.” His tone turned cold and sharp, like a man who stood face to face with something he either hated or feared. “Go back to Collingswood and take 85 to the interstate. It’s not safe any other way.”\n\nMark had served six years in the army before coming to New Wilderness, and to see him this rigid, coiled like a spring, made me temporarily forget about my internal pity-party over our unfortunate past.\n\n“Okay, I’ll go that way.”\n\nHe caught my eye and placed a white-knuckled hand on the open driver’s door. “Do not take shortcuts, do not try to go the old route. You do *not* stop, not for anything, or anyone. If worst comes to worst, you backtrack here, and lock yourself inside the Administration Building.”\n\n*He acts like there’s a tornado coming.*\n\n“Okay.” I squeaked, unable to muster much else. Mark’s sternness frightened me.\n\n“I mean it, Maddie. I don’t care who they are, what they do, do *not* stop, not for a soul. Period.”\n\nA long bolt of silvery lightning streaked through the air, and the resounding *boom* that echoed off it shook the ground beneath my feet. I’d grown up in town a half hour north of the park, and had never seen a storm like this, even in tornado season. Something about how fast the clouds gobbled up the sky, the way the lightning shrieked with venomous glee, gave the storm an almost sentient quality, like it waited for us to venture out onto the long gravel roads that surrounded the isolated reserve so it could pounce.\n\n“What’s going on?” I finally managed to meet his eyes, raw fear overpowering my façade. “Mark, is everything okay?”\n\nHe walked around the open car door and placed both hands on my shoulders in a gentle touch that sent pangs of guilt rippling deep into my chest.\n\nMark tried to smile, but another lightning strike lit up his thin face, and I saw the lines there, the desperation, like a man with no cards left in a losing poker game. “Go home, Maddie. As fast as you can. And if you see a road sign for a Tauerpin Road, spelled T-A-U-E-R-P-I-N, do *not* take it. Do you understand me?”\n\n*Not really.*\n\nMy mind whirled with a thousand confused questions, but the way Mark held me by my shoulders, gave me a small squeeze as though we were saying goodbye forever made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. What was going on? I had never seen him get this way about a storm, and not once in the dozens of times I’d driven around New Wilderness had I ever seen a sign for Tauerpin Road. I wanted to believe Mark was messing with me, perhaps getting a form of warped revenge for my rejection, but the storm swamped the night sky above us, and turned the pleasant mid fall evening into a dark, rainy hellscape.\n\nI slid into my driver’s seat and exhaled in thanks the moment my car’s decrepit engine roared to life.\n\nMark leaned through the open car window to be face level with me one last time. “Remember, do not take Tauerpin Road. Not for any reason. Turn around and come back if you have to.”\n\nGripping my cracked steering wheel, I forced myself to hold his gaze, even though it made my jumbled emotions do somersaults in my head. “You’re going to be okay, right?”\n\nThrough the murky darkness, that same bright smile split the night, though a morose gleam overshadowed Mark’s usually cheerful eyes. “I’ll be fine. Text me when you get home, okay? Just so I know you’re not stuck out there.”\n\nWith that, he jogged away to his SUV, casting furtive glances at the storm overhead, as the rain started to pour down around him. Part of me wanted to run after Mark, to hop into the passenger’s seat next to him and refuse to leave until he told me what was happening, but I knew I couldn’t do that. Dad and Mom were waiting on me, the storm was getting worse by the second, and I didn’t want to make Mark worry. Nor did I want to give him any wrong ideas about my feelings toward him.\n\n*Especially not now. He’s finally happy, everything is back to normal, sort of. He’s got some lucky girl, and I have my friend back. That’s all that matters.*\n\nThe road home became a long ebony ribbon of shallow potholes, which my little car rattled over one-by-one with a malcontent rumble. Wind roared outside my rain-streaked windows, and I could feel the power of the storm pushing my car with each heavy gust. Rivulets of water turned the windshield into an optical illusion, my vision ahead smeared and hazy, the ragged wiper blades running at full speed. All the ditches brimmed with muddy runoff water, streams flowed over the gravel roadway, and more water surged down from the surrounding banks. Thunder crackled like a warzone right over my head, and even though I sat in my nice, dry car, I still hunched over every time a boom went off in reflex, like a wild animal. Lightning bolts lit up the night sky in flash-bulb eruptions, making everything seem to move in slow motion.\n\n*Whump*.\n\nI screamed and yanked hard on the steering wheel.\n\nAll four tires skipped over the wet gravel in an uncontrolled slide, and the vehicle careened toward the nearest ditch.\n\nMy heart stopped in my chest, I mashed the brake pedal to the floor, and the hunk of rouge metal ground to a stop, mere inches from flying off the road.\n\n“Holy cow.” I breathed, my arms and legs shaking, too stunned to be angry, or afraid.\n\nA huge telephone pole lay across the road, completely blocking it, and another lay further down the tarmac in the same fashion, both fried black by the powerful lightning. Their long gray cables snaked over the wet pavement in between them, a deadly labyrinth of runaway voltage that would zap me if I tried to walk across, not that I would even think of being that stupid.\n\nSlumping back in the seat, I closed my eyes, and focused on slowing my heartrate. I’d come a few microseconds from smashing headfirst into the pole, and if I had, there would be no way of getting myself out of such a mess.\n\n“I need to turn around.” I tried to talk myself into a calmer state as the rain hammered on my tiny blue sedan, my adrenaline at all-time highs. “Can’t go that way. Maybe I can find a side road and . . .”\n\nA sliver of jade green caught my eye, and the thought left my mind.\n\nOn the other side of the road a lone, dented road sign stood in the weeds and briars, its white borders rusted, the green of the sign faded to near illegibility. But even from where I sat, there was no mistaking the words that glared back at me in the yellowish beam of my headlights.\n\n*Tauerpin Road.*\n\nAn ice-cold shiver ran down my spine, goosebumps scattered over my arms beneath my jacket, and I gulped back a gasp. I hadn’t deviated from the route Mark had told me to take. I had followed his instructions to the letter, and I’d taken this way a few times before, always in the daytime.\n\nNever, not once, had I seen this sign.\n\nBeyond the glow of my headlights, I could discern a narrow gravel road that stretched far off into the darkness between the trees, peppered with rain so that it almost appeared jet black in the night. Unlike most of the roads in this area, this one seemed to be arrow straight, like a deep gullet of shadows that threatened to swallow me whole.\n\n*Nope.*\n\nI shook myself out of my stupor and reached for the gear shift knob. I’d never thought of myself as the prettiest, fastest, or even smartest girl in town, but I knew enough to stay away from sketchy areas, and this one beat them all. Blocked road or not, with the way Mark talked about it, there was no way I was taking my car down there. I’d head back, park in front of the Administration Building and wait for the storm to blow over. Even if I had to be stranded at New Wilderness for the night, I figured it would be way safer than driving on roads with trees and telephone poles blown down all over the place.\n\n*Clank*.\n\nMy bumper hit something, and the back of my head smacked off my headrest.\n\nI blinked at myself in my rearview mirror with confusion. What had I hit? Nothing sat in the road behind me, no other vehicles, nothing but wet roadway and . . .\n\n“Seriously?”\n\nMy eyes stared into my mirror with disbelief. A third telephone pole draped across the road, cutting me off from my one and only escape route. It was impossible, simply impossible that lightning had struck all three in a perfect row, but there it was. I couldn’t drive around it, the ground outside of the gravel road had turned to muck, and the ditches were practically medieval moats. Moving the hefty poles by myself was out of the question, and my little car didn’t have the guts to drag or push them out of the way. I couldn’t walk, not in this storm, with the wind bringing the temperature down to a nasty 40 degrees at minimum. Besides, my town lay another thirty miles to the north, and the road ahead was covered in downed electrical wires. Even if I tip-toed around them, I’d be stumbling along the dark road, by myself, wearing thin khaki work pants and a lightweight jacket that would never turn the rain. Flagging down a car would require one coming by, and with how bad this storm was, I didn’t figure that would happen any time soon.\n\nI pulled my phone out and tapped the screen. My heart sank at the empty triangle in the upper right-hand corner, a little x through the bottom of it.\n\n*No service. Of course, I’ve got no service. Dad’s gonna freak.*\n\nSwallowing the dryness that attempted to choke me, I put the car into park, and sighed. I’d just have to wait here until the storm passed. At least I had protection from the elements, and a barrier between myself and the menacing night. I could sleep till morning, run my heater, and play some music to keep boredom away. Maybe if Mark got concerned, he’d track me down, and give me a ride back to New Wilderness. Come to think of it, Dad would eventually come out to search for me too, and between the two of them, there was no way they could miss me. All I had to do was sit tight, and I’d be out of this jam by sunup.\n\nSatisfied with my plan, I clicked my seat back into a slight recline and started to scroll through the pictures on my phone, reliving all the fond memories I’d made this year. One by one, they glided past my gaze to reflect on the glass window beside me, a ticker-tape parade of sunshine and fun.\n\nMe petting a giraffe in the giraffe barn. Me, my best friend Kendra Smith, and a few other girls washing windows at the rental cabins. Me and several others at the company picnic, where our goofy team had taken third place in a karaoke competition.\n\n*Right after they gave us our trophy, Mark complimented my singing, and Kendra said I should date him, literally within earshot of the poor guy.*\n\nCringing at how the memory stabbed at my guilt-ridden heart, I reached to turn on the radio as a distraction from the uncomfortable reality of my choices.\n\nSomething moved in the corner of my eye.\n\nI sat bolt upright and snapped my head around to the left.\n\nNot far away on the other side of the road, stood Kendra. \n\nHer khaki pants and short brown braid were dripping, her lips tinged a shade of light blue from the horrid wind. Kendra’s drenched black uniform shirt stuck to her slender frame, moving in jerky rhythm with each breath, and she hugged her arms around herself in a desperate attempt to ward off the cold.\n\nI stared, confused. How was she here? I hadn’t seen any other cars pull up, no lights or horns. In fact, I couldn’t see Kendra’s green Kia anywhere. Had she foolishly decided to walk for help instead of staying in her own car?\n\n*She must have left around the same time and got stranded too.*\n\nSeeing me staring, Kendra made a sheepish smile.\n\n“Kendra.” I waved at her from behind the glass of my driver’s door. “Kendra, hop in. Come on, it’s warmer in here.”\n\nThe rain pounded on the car roof harder, and Kendra hunched against the watery onslaught, as though each drop was an ice pick to her exposed skin. She pointed to her ear and mouthed a reply.\n\n*Can’t hear you.*\n\nIt occurred to me that, with the dull roar of the rain, there was no way she could hear me from inside my locked car, all the way across the road.\n\nInstead, I beckoned her closer, made blatant motions and half-shouted with exaggerated movements. “Come here. Kendra, come here.”\n\nKendra just shook harder with a fresh gust of cold and waved for me to come to her, like she had some intimate secret she didn’t want to shout in front of the lonely, dark trees.\n\n*You’ve got to be kidding me. Whatever it is, you can tell me in the car. Ugh, I better not get pneumonia for some stupid gossip, Kendra.*\n\nFrustrated, but still concerned, I slid my hand toward my door handle.\n\nLightning peeled through the sky, and in the dark trees behind Kendra, I glimpsed movement.\n\nSeconds slowed to what felt like hours, and I blinked up at the thing that hid in the forest in mute panic. It was tall, easily the same height as the surrounding pines, with a thin body that resembled a gnarled tree trunk without leaves or branches. In the spasmodic light of the storm, I couldn’t see its face, just a rounded, bulbous head wreathed in shadow, and spindly arms that hung to where it’s knees would have risen to.\n\nMy mouth fell open in shock, and I pointed a trembling finger, unable to so much as shout a warning.\n\nKendra turned, just in time for a huge gray hand with four fingers to shoot out of the tree line and snatch her up like a ragdoll.\n\nHer head whipped around, Kendra’s mouth fell open in a terrified scream, one that I heard even inside my car.\n\n*Oh no . . .*\n\nKendra’s shriek cut off the second the massive gray arm jerked back into the trees, and another deep rumble of thunder echoed through the night, almost reminding me of throaty laughter.\n\n“Kendra!”\n\nMy clumsy fingers fumbled with the door handle, my heart racing a million miles a minute. Without a second thought about the cold, I lunged out the open door and snagged my foot on the loose seatbelt to fall face-first in the wet gravel. Pain stung in my right palm, but I pushed myself up and dashed toward the road junction, past the battered sign for Tauerpin Road.\n\nWind slashed at my face, pulled my hair from its ponytail, and cold rain drained down the back of my jacket with sadistic glee. Muddy gravel squelched under my tennis shoes, and shadows closed in around me as I outran the golden beams of my car’s headlights. Both lungs burned with the moisture-filled air, and I squinted against the inky darkness.\n\n*Wham.*\n\nI flew headlong into the rough stones of the road, my shins flaring with pain. Little sharp bits of rock stuck into my bare hands, and I gritted my teeth to choke back a string of expletives. “Oww, son of a . . .”\n\nSitting up, I picked at my hands to dislodge the pesky rocks and ran careful fingers over my legs. They were sore, but I hadn’t fallen hard enough to break or sprain anything. I decided that I must have tripped over a fallen tree branch in the dark, my own hands barely visible before my dirt-smeared face.\n\nBlind as a bat in the dark, I groped for my phone.\n\n*Oh Madison, you idiot.*\n\nI remembered too late that my phone sat in my car’s center console, still on the picture of me and my teammates at the company picnic. Ten clammy fingers searched the pockets of my thin jacket frantically, but all I could find was the crinkled wrapper of a candy bar I’d eaten earlier today.\n\nMy panic began to mount even more, until my thumb bumped something smooth, and cool to the touch.\n\n“Mee-maw, you’re the best.” I chuckled, and pulled out the little red penlight my grandma had gotten me for a Christmas stocking stuffer.\n\nIt clicked on with a comforting bright blue glow, though the thin beam didn’t let me see very far around me. Looking back the way I’d come, I spotted a downed tree branch, and rubbed my shins again in spite. Man, that had hurt.\n\nLightning illuminated the road for a split second, and it occurred to me that I couldn’t see my car from where I sat. In fact, I couldn’t even make out the aura of my car’s headlights. It was as if they’d fallen off the face of the earth.\n\n*How far did I run? I’m still on the road, and it was, like, thirty seconds. I left it running . . . maybe the battery died?*\n\nBut that didn’t make any sense. My dad taught me enough about cars to know that if the engine was running, it should be charging the battery with the alternator. Besides, my car’s battery was only a year old, I remembered paying for a new one last year. So where did the lights go?\n\nAn uneasy sensation rippled through my stomach, and I rubbed at my arms for heat. All around, the trees swayed in the high wind, lighting slithered across the sky, followed by waves of cannon-like thunder. My toes were going numb in my soggy sneakers, and I swallowed a bitter lump of regret. Whatever grabbed Kendra could be anywhere, and outside of my little car, in the pounding rain, I felt as exposed as if I had come to work naked.\n\nMy mind flashed back to the little revolver my father had bought for me a month ago, one he’d insisted I carry everywhere, only for me to roll my eyes and leave it in my nightstand drawer. Dad had always been protective, particularly since I was the eldest daughter, and I’d chafed at how he’d made me text him every time I came and went from work. Sitting on the wet ground, my shins throbbing, with nothing but my tiny penlight to ward off the darkness, I cursed myself for all the times I’d shrugged him off as being too paranoid.\n\n*Dad, I wish you were here.*\n\n*Crunch, crunch, crunch.*\n\nI spun around at the sound of shoes on loose stones, and the beam of my flashlight landed on a familiar khaki-wearing figure.\n\nShocked, I stood up. “Kendra?”\n\nShe stopped several yards away, far enough that the weak beam of my penlight couldn’t fully reveal her features. Something in the pit of my guts churned, like I’d eaten spoiled food, and I took a cautious step forward.\n\n“Kendra? Jeez, you okay? I saw that thing grab you, what was . . .”\n\nMy limbs froze, and the words died in my throat at a sudden realization.\n\nEvery morning, I checked the work roster to see where I’d be working, and who I’d be working with. Mainly I wanted to know ahead of time if I was working with any newcomers, so I could know their names, but ever since the incident with Mark, I also did it to be sure I had fair warning if he’d be anywhere nearby. Kendra and I were really close, and she always texted me whenever we were set to work together, usually a long string of happy emojis.\n\nI was certain she hadn’t been on the roster at all today.\n\nMy heart thudded against my ribs, and both hands turned slick with sweat.\n\nIn the faint glow of my light, I could just begin to make out the contours of Kendra’s pale face.\n\nShe was smiling. \n\nWide. \n\nFar too wide.\n\nI took a step back.\n\nKendra lunged forward, letting out a croaking screech that rang in my ears.\n\nReacting too slow, I raised my arms to protect myself, and locked eyes with her.\n\nKendra’s eyes were a flood of off-white, as if they’d rolled into the back of her head, and her mouth hung open in a gape that couldn’t be normal for how wide it was. Her teeth were squared-off and stubby, almost like they’d been carved in some weird woodcraft festival, and yet she grinned in a stiff way that made my blood run cold.\n\nLike a rabid dog, she hurled herself into me, and we both went flying to the ground.\n\nI would have screamed, but the blow knocked the wind out of me, Kendra straddling my chest and pinning me with her weight. Desperate to escape, I squirmed to prevent her manic fingers from reaching my face, as she seemed intent on clawing my eyes out. Her skin was cold as ice, and surprisingly hard, dense like a chair leg. My feeble jabs didn’t seem to have any impact, and it felt like I was punching a wall. All the while, Kendra’s bizarre jaws snapped inches from my face, her fetid breath blasting me with the stench of rot.\n\nShe grabbed both my wrists with her vice-like grip, and I felt my energy slipping away, my strength gone, sapped by unforgiving fear.\n\n*No, no, no . . .*\n\nGaining the upper hand, she held down my arms, and I couldn’t stop the panic, sobbing and writhing in the mud. Something in the way Kendra grinned at me in malicious, animalistic joy, told me that my fate would not only be painful, but slow, and that death should be the least of my worries.\n\nMy mind flashed to my dad’s smile, my mom’s warm hugs, to my sister and brother, and my own cozy room covered in movie posters and Skyrim art. I wanted nothing more than to see them again, to get back in my car and drive home, to wake up from this horrible nightmare I’d somehow fallen into. In the last few moments, I pictured Mark’s soft brown eyes, his debonair smile, and the way he’d warned me with fear heavy in his voice.\n\n*Text me when you get home, okay?*\n\nI squeezed my eyes shut and turned my face to the muck as Kendra’s lukewarm breath hissed in my ear, ready for her to rip into me like a juicy steak.\n\n*Whack.*\n\nThe crack of wood-on-wood pierced the air above my face, and Kendra wrenched backward, something coarse and wet spattering over my face.\n\nAt last I screamed, still paralyzed by fear, afraid to open my eyes.\n\nKendra’s bulk slid off me, and more footsteps bounded up next to my head. A few more loud *cracks* echoed, as if a two-by-four had been smashed against a wall repeatedly.\n\nSomething grabbed the back of my jacket collar, and started to pull me down the road, oblivious to my frightened hyperventilation. Thunder roared, and even through my closed eyelids, I could see a monstrous shadow framed against the bright lightning nearby, standing over the road.\n\n*It’s got me.*\n\nMy arms came back to life, and I thrashed, kicked, and screamed with all my might, like my mother had told me to do if someone ever tried to drag me into their van. I wanted to go home, wanted to live, and even if it meant biting and clawing my way out, I would do it.\n\nWhatever had hold of my jacket let go, and my eyes flew open so I could make a run for it.\n\n“*Stop*.” A hand clamped over my mouth, while an arm wound around my chest to yank me off the road, and deep into the murky brush. “You want to get us both killed?”\n\n*Wait, what?*\n\nBoth legs went limp the instant that voice jerked me from my panic. Could it be?\n\n“Marmmm?” I murmured into the calloused hand over my mouth.\n\nMy captor tensed, and more whispered words tickled my right ear. “Stay still. It’s close.”\n\nI didn’t have time to protest.\n\nOn the opposite side of the road, a tall, lumbering figure moved through the trees in long, slow strides, its head swaying slowly back and forth, as if searching for something. Each step the being took made the ground shake, small tremors moving up from the mud into my chest, as if a steel mill were right beside me. One hand swung freely at its side, like a person out for a walk, while the other held on to a long mass of what looked like black strands draped over its pebble-gray shoulder, attached to a load that I couldn’t see from where I sat. I still couldn’t make out its face, so high up and shrouded in darkness was it, and while it had arms, legs, and a body like a person, I somehow knew in the depths of my frightened mind that this thing was far from natural.\n\nThe massive creature wandered on down the road, letting out long, loud bellows at random intervals that sounded kind of like beluga whale calls, the eerie siren song making my head swim.\n\nAs soon as it trailed out of sight, a dark form shifted in from of me, and a newfound panic rose in my throat at the shove of someone pushing me hard against a rock so I couldn’t wriggle free.\n\nRed light filled my field of vision, and I slammed my eyes shut in confusion at the glow that hovered over my face. The hand left my mouth at last, only to return with the cold sensation of a knife blade pressed to my neck.\n\nAgain, a low voice hissed through the dark. “Say your name.”\n\n*What did I do, I don’t understand, what did I do to deserve this?*\n\nI choked down a whimper and tried to stay calm. “Please, I just—”\n\n“I said *say your name*.” The shadow with Mark’s voice snarled in a vicious tone I’d never heard him take with anyone before.\n\nMy skin prickled, and I had never felt more helpless than in that moment. I had always trusted Mark, and never in my wildest nightmares would I have thought of him hurting me. Now I was at his mercy, and I thought with bitter remorse of my rejection, and how he might seek vengeance for it.\n\n“Madison.” I squeaked, praying it was really him, and that somehow, he’d let me go. “Mark, please don’t—”\n\n“What kind of cupcakes do you make?” The knife didn’t move, and I felt it brush my skin as I swallowed nervously.\n\n“S-Strawberry. Strawberry upside-down.”\n\nThere was a long, terrifying pause.\n\nThe knife left my throat, and the figure pulled me up from the cold rock he had me pinned to.\n\nTwo arms wove around me, and held me close, so close that I could smell the mint aftershave on his neck and burned cordite on his gray jacket. He tucked the open folds of his coat around my shoulders to surround me in warmth, his dry uniform shirt soaking up some of the rainwater from mine. The harshness vanished like melted snow, and a tenderness radiated through his embrace that made everything seem a little less dark.\n\n“What are you doing here, Maddie?”\n\nAt the sound of my name, I wound my hands up in the cloth of Mark’s shirt and pressed my face to his collar in relief. “My car . . . my car, I got stuck . . . Kendra . . .”\n\n“Yeah, I know.” Mark rubbed my back between both tense shoulder blades, his touch comforting. “It wasn’t her.”\n\nWith my face buried into his cozy jacket lapels, I fought tears that brimmed in my eyes, too afraid to be embarrassed. “What’s going on?”\n\nAnother roll of thunder growled overhead, and somewhere off in the woods, a shriek echoed into the night.\n\n“We have to go.” Mark slid his arms under my armpits and hauled me to my feet. “It’s not safe here.”\n\nBut I clung to him, refused to let go, too cold and scared to leave the heated sanctuary of his coat. “What’s going on, Mark? What was that thing? Why did Kendra . . . why did she . . .”\n\nMark clicked his flashlight on and held it so I could see his face.\n\nIn the red beam, Mark’s brown eyes appeared black, his face grim, and there were scratches on his right cheek as if someone had dug their fingernails into his skin. “Maddie, I need you to trust me, alright? I’ll explain once we have some breathing room. Now come on.”\n\nEvery instinct I had wanted to refuse, to beg him to run with me back to my waiting car, so I speed home to my warm house. I just wanted this nightmare to end, yet something primal inside my guts told me that I wouldn’t get ten feet without Mark. Like it or not, I needed him, and he seemed bound and determined to plunge deeper into the forests surrounding that cursed road.\n\nAnother cold gust of wind raked its cruel tendrils over my face, and I shivered. “Okay.”\n\nMark grabbed my hand, and without a word, led me deeper into the darkness.\n\nMy shoes slid on the mud, thorns stuck into my thin coat, and the rain continued to sap me of whatever body heat I had left. Still, I never let go of his hand, for fear this strange labyrinth would swallow him like it had my old beater and leave me at the mercy of whatever other apparitions were out there. My fate was sealed now, my survival intwined with Mark’s, and I followed him blindly through the abyss, hoping with every step that he had some plan to get me out of Tauerpin Road.\n\n*To be continued . . .*",

        "text": "There is an old wives’ tale in our town, a small place with no more than 400 people, which will remain unnamed for my safety and the safety of those I love. The tale has been slightly changed many times over the years, but the general gist has always been the same; that there were two schools in our town in the year 1895. By 1912, only one remained. It wasn’t demolished, nor closed, but disappeared one morning, along with everyone inside it. A few weeks later it appeared again, upside down in the middle of a field, looking as though it had aged a hundred years. A few brave townsfolk went inside, including my great-grandfather, or, at least, that’s the way I was told. Nobody came out, and the school disappeared again after a few hours, never reappearing again. Everyone who was inside, all one hundred and fifty students and around forty faculty, were never heard or seen again.  \n\nA good story, most of us thought, but we were told by many that what really happened was the school burnt down. A tragedy, but nothing as supernatural as a teleporting school. Lives were lost, and as time passed, memories of those events became distorted, and became the tale we know today. I liked to believe that there was some sort of supernatural phenomenon that took place, but it was a wives’ tale, and that was that. A legend, like the boogieman, or bigfoot, nothing more.\n\nYesterday, my family received a letter stapled to a large box, about four feet tall and just as wide. It was delivered by a friend that worked at a construction company in town, and noticed that the box had our last name on it when clearing out an old house that was to be demolished next week. My parents had no idea why there would be a box with our name on it, especially one this old, so they excitedly pulled the box into our garage and began to sift through it.\n\nMost of it was old clothes and a few small cases of jewelry that my mother was excited about, and a few pieces of war memorabilia scattered throughout. They quickly realized that all of these objects must have belonged to our grandfather, given their age. At the very bottom, was a long case that bore a gold lock on the side, with a similarly ornate gold key tied to it by a small red ribbon. The key fit snugly into the lock, but the case was stuck for a few tries before finally opening.\n\nIt was a long, golden kaleidoscope, engraved with markings so small and intricate it was almost impossible to see every bit of detail. For a few moments my family said nothing, eyes fixed on the glittering object. \n\n“What a find!” My dad said, delicately removing the object from the box. “Didn’t know your father was such a collector.”\n\n“Me neither, honestly.” My mother replied, watching as my father put the lens to his eye.\n\nHe looked through it for a few seconds, then yanked it away from his face in surprise.\n\n“Dammit! Son of a bitch got me.” My dad exclaimed, thrusting it into my mother’s hands. “Must be some shard or notch in the eyepiece. How does it look?”\n\nMy mom and I leaned forward, examining his eye. There was a small knick on his eyelid, and blood was dripping steadily down his face. \n\n“Face cuts bleed a bunch, but it doesn’t look bad.” I said, as my mom gave me the kaleidoscope, ushering my father back into the house. \n\n“Put it away! We’ll get it looked at by an expert, but no more until we get it fixed.” She called out from the doorway. \n\n“Sure!” I called back, eying the kaleidoscope. I pressed my thumb against the eyepiece to feel for anything sharp, but it was smooth to the touch. It didn’t seem dangerous, and there was something incredibly alluring about the way it glittered in the light; but I wasn’t about to take any chances, so I stowed it back into its case and went inside.\n\nThat night I woke up to the sound of my father sobbing in the bathroom, my mother softly comforting him as he wept. Making my way quietly towards them, I saw his reflection in the bathroom mirror; the cut on his eye was purple and brown, like a bruise, and it was swollen to at least three times its size. \n\n“It’s OK, honey.” My mom said, gesturing for me to go back to my room. “We just need to go to the hospital for a bit, it looks like the cut got a little infected.”\n\n“Alright. Feel better, Dad.” \n\n“Thanks, kid. Don’t worry about me.” He said, but the pain in his voice was unmistakable. \n\nI listened as they pulled out of the driveway, then went downstairs to the kitchen to grab a snack. The green glow of the digital clock blinked at me as I ate. It was 1 AM, and I already knew school was going to be a struggle tomorrow. A few minutes passed as I chewed mindlessly; until I began to hear a small noise coming from downstairs. I slowly made my way down the steps as the noise got louder. \n\nIt sounded like a small animal caught in the garage, which has happened a few times before; once, during a storm, a squirrel tried to run into our house for shelter. My father got to it first, and kicked it right back into the storm. I prepared myself to see some sort of rodent, but the noise abruptly stopped as I opened the door. I found myself standing there, staring at the large box of things my grandfather left behind, illuminated by the lightbulb on a string we have tenuously hanging from the ceiling. \n\nAll of a sudden I had an urge to open the box, so I did. It was almost as if I was watching myself from above, gently sifting through the objects and clothes until in my hand was that oblong case containing the kaleidoscope. It was humming, vibrating the case ever so slightly as my fingers fumbled with the latch. I knew what had happened to my father, but I couldn’t help it; as if ushered by an invisible force, the kaleidoscope was in my hands. The metal was warm to the touch, now expanding and condensing rhythmically almost as if it was breathing.\n\nI think I may have tried to put it away, lock it up back in the case and walk back to my bedroom. I think I may have tried to do that, but the slow rhythm of the kaleidoscope lulled me into slowly pressing the eyepiece to my face, just as my father had done. \n\nAt first, it was all black. Nervously, I lifted my other hand and spun the end. Colors began to swirl; red, purple, and blue danced in front of my eye, until the colors began to come together, forming shapes. After a few moments I realized I was looking at a doctor, in some sort of hospital room. My body tensed as the kaleidoscope began vibrating again, and the images began to focus even more, until I recognized the person I was looking at. \n\nIt was my mother, sitting beside the doctor as he spoke. I couldn’t hear anything, but I knew from the looks on their faces that it was serious. They were leading her out of the room as the doctor held up a mirror, and staring back at me was my father’s swollen face, his eye considerably blacker, leaking a green and yellow pus slowly down his cheek.\n\nSomehow, I was looking through my father’s eyes, or, eye, by the looks of the swelling. It was like I was playing a first person video game, but I had no control over the character. I could only watch as the doctor spoke, soundless, my father’s face in the mirror getting more frustrated as the conversation continued. After a few moments the kaleidoscope began to hum again, and the colors returned, splintering my vision.\n\n*That’s enough of this for tonight.* I thought. *I must be hallucinating. It’s 2 in the morning. I just need some sleep.*\n\nI gently removed the kaleidoscope from my eye, but as I did, I realized my vision was splintered into fractals, slowly turning, like I never took the instrument off of my eye. Stumbling forward, I managed to find my way up the garage stairs, to the bathroom, tripping several times on my way up. It was like trying to drive with my windshield shattered.\n\nStumbling into the bathroom, I looked in the mirror- from what I could see, my eye was blood red, so deep you could barely tell what color my eye actually was. Suddenly my world began to swirl, and the shattered pieces started to melt together into one pulsing mass of black, purple and red. It was like watching a bruised, bloody heart, beating its last, sad breath. All at once, a cacophony of sounds slammed into my ears- people screaming, moaning, and the shattering of glass.\n\nI managed to take one more step before stumbling to the floor, passing out on the cold floor of my bathroom. I woke up a few hours later and looked in the mirror. No red in my eye; in fact, it looked a bit brighter than usual. I’m typing this just before going to school, and my Dad is still at the hospital. I just hope everyone ends up being ok.\n\nI’ll go see him after school, if he’s not already back by then.",

        "text": "“Can you hear it yet?”\n\nThe blonde woman stared at me with a look of urgency on her face.\n\n\"Can you hear it yet?\" She asked, her head tilted ever so slightly up to meet my eyeline.\n\n\"I don't understand.\" I replied, but the woman’s face showed no acknowledgment of the fact I'd even spoken.\n\n\"Can you hear it yet?\" She repeated for the third and final time.\n\nAnd then I woke up, sweating and screaming.\n\n\\-----\n\nRobin was making herself coffee when I came downstairs but she looked concerned.\n\n\"Bad dreams?\" She asked.\n\nI didn't know how to reply.\n\n\"I don't know. I guess.\" I said after a pause.\n\n\"You guess? I could hear you from down here you know.\"\n\nI shrugged.\n\n\"It's just one of those things, you know? Nothing scary was actually happening but somehow in the dream it seemed like the scariest thing in the world. It was just a woman say-\"\n\nSuddenly a realisation hit me out of nowhere.\n\n\"It was Anna! The woman in my dream, it was Anna!\"\n\nRobin turned around brusquely to make a cup of coffee for me as I played the dream through my head again.\n\n\"It's so strange. I haven't thought about Anna in forever and then she just pops up in the worst nightmare I've had in years. And that I didn't recognise her in the dream at all, even though she was right in front of me.\"\n\nRobin passed me the coffee and shrugged.\n\n\"I guess dreams are just weird like that. Look, I have to pop into work for a couple of hours so I-\"\n\n\"Huh? Since when?\"\n\nNot everyone would be able to look annoyed at an interruption and apologetic for disappearing simultaneously, but that is one of my wife's many skills. She continued to use this skill at full force as she answered me.\n\n\"Something came up. I won't be long, okay?\"\n\nRobin's job didn't have excessively unreasonable hours and did pay very well but one of its major downsides was that she would sometimes get called in at weird times, including weekends or days she was supposed to have off. Considering how long she had worked at the company and the fact that her job wasn't anything where lives were at stake (she was an actuary at a local firm) I didn't understand why she always just went along with these demands and so it could sometimes be a source of friction between us.\n\nI let it go.\n\n\"Do you need anything doing whilst you're out?\" I asked her.\n\nRobin looked at our fruit bowl, a place where our promises of health go to die.\n\n\"You could always bake some of your banana bread.\" She said hopefully. \"I mean, it doesn't *need* to happen. But, maybe if you're bored?\"\n\nI looked at the increasingly sorry looking bananas.\n\n\"Hm, I don't know.” I said as I assessed them optimistically. “They're still good. We might eat them.\"\n\nShe didn't believe me, which is fine because I didn't either.\n\n\"Okay, sure. Anyway, I have to run.\"\n\n\\-----\n\nI love music, I always have. But I think that was maybe the first day of my life that I *needed* to listen to music instead of just wanting to. My general tastes in music are incredibly varied but I usually have one particular type of music I prefer at any one time. Sure, I might listen to classic rock one evening, smooth jazz another and showtunes the evening after that but I don't usually blend the whole lot together in a single hour’s worth of listening.\n\nThat day was different though. I listened to the first five seconds of maybe twenty songs before settling on one and skipped away from that one half way through. I was looking for something, desperately seeking it even, but I didn't know what. Anna's face loomed in the back of my mind as I searched and it was driving me almost crazy. I spent hours searching through songs, my ears examining every note in minute detail. Whatever was looking for, I didn’t find it and eventually I shut the music off in defeat, more upset than made and kind of sense to me.\n\n\"It's still stuck in my head.\" I told Robin over dinner.\n\n\"Hmm?\"\n\n\"Anna saying 'Can you hear it yet?' It's weird. I feel like she's trying to tell me something.\"\n\nRobin put down her fork and looked at me, concerned.\n\n\"I think you're overthinking it. You were in a band together, surely she must have said things like that to you all of the time.\"\n\n\"I was in a band?\"\n\nRobin looked suddenly alarmed, like a kid with their hand in the cookie jar or a married man with his dick in a mistress. Only for a moment though, then the expression disappeared as quickly as it had surfaced.\n\n\"I don't remember that.” I pressed. “Why don't I remember that?\"\n\nRobin shrugged.\n\n\"I don't know, maybe because it was a while ago? Maybe because most of us forget or try to forget half of the stuff we did in college?\"\n\nAs I frowned and tried to remember this band she pressed on.\n\n\"Hell, I used to be a backing dancer for one of the more popular bands at my college. They weren't even a big deal to anyone who didn't go there but I followed them around to all of their gigs, grinning like a lunatic and shaking my ass to the beat. It makes me cringe just thinking about it, can you even imagine?\"\n\nI grinned.\n\n\"Hmm... imagine you shaking your ass? I don't know, I'm not sure I can manage it. Maybe I need a demonstration?\"\n\nShe rolled her eyes but it was done in good humour. I almost forgot the earlier parts of the conversation until I lay in bed that night.\n\n\\-----\n\nI don’t usually have problems falling asleep but last night’s bad dreams were causing me to struggle to drift off so I went back downstairs and continued to listen to music on my headphones. At first I thought I was skipping between them at random but then I realised that I was following the exact same pattern over and over with only the last song being different each time. It was almost trancelike and I reached the conclusion that I must be even more exhausted than I’d thought. I headed back upstairs to bed and settled down.\n\n“*Don’t you... try to pretend. It’s my feeling, we’ll win in the end-”* a sultry female vocalist sang as I stood in an unfamiliar club.\n\nThe backing instruments were quite different from those which usually accompany this song but it was pleasant nonetheless. I wandered around, weaving my way between faceless dancers as I tried to find the stage. Once I found it though, I was frozen in complete terror.\n\nThis song doesn’t usually have any place for a violin but the existence of a violinist alone wasn’t any cause for surprise. After all, I’d been able to hear each of the instruments long before I’d seen any of the musicians on the stage. The fact that *I* was the violinist was far more alarming. The fact that Anna was singing the vocals filled me with the same panicked dread as the last dream she’d featured in. I wanted to run but instead I just continued watching her as she finally noticed me and locked her eyes with mine.\n\n“*Don’t you… forget about me…”*\n\nI woke up shaking and suddenly, just like I had the night before. I think I must have been screaming again because Robin ran up the stairs and looked at me with concern.\n\n“What were you dreaming about?” she asked.\n\n*Don’t tell her.*\n\nThe thought was unprompted and inexplicable. It was a little embarrassing that I had gotten into such a state purely from a dream about a college friend singing but this was my wife we were talking about - we’d seen each other sick and drunk before now. I knew she was scared of craneflies and she’d comforted me when breaking my favourite mug had literally reduced me to tears. Being as effected as I was by my nightmares would have been an embarrassing thing to share with most people but was no reason for me to even have to think about whether it would be okay to talk to her it. But despite all of that, I chose to lie.\n\n“It might be the horror film from the other night. I’m usually fine with horror but those mind controlling aliens really got to me, haha.”\n\nThe laugh didn’t sound genuine to my ears but she seemed to accept it. She nodded as if it all made sense now.\n\n“Well, I was just on my way out. See you later.”\n\nI smiled at Robin as she picked up her bag and headed out of the door but my smile fell away the moment she’d actually left. Adrenaline was coursing through me and on top of that was the guilt that I felt this desperate urge to hide my fears from the woman I loved. Even though she hadn’t noticed that anything was wrong I still wanted top make it up to her. After I had showered and gotten ready I noticed the bananas on the counter and remembered what she’d said yesterday. Maybe baking some banana bread would clear my conscience.\n\nWe didn’t have all of the ingredients so I headed off to the store, walking rather than driving in the hopes that it’d help clear my head. Usually I listen to music on even the shortest walks but today I left my headphones at home, mildly disturbed by the frantic nature with which I’d been listening to music yesterday. Maybe if I hadn’t, the noise of a group of people leaving the cinema at once wouldn’t have caught my attention. There was nothing unusual about it, just people leaving a showing, and the cinema was on the opposite side of the road so the sight of people filing out was unlikely to have caught my attention. As it was though, I looked across. And I saw Robin.\n\nRobin had said she was going to work. The cinema wasn’t close to her office and even if it was, nothing that she’d said about her job previously had led me to believe that they’d be comfortable with her taking film long breaks for no reason. In fact unless it was an incredibly short film it was likely she’d told me that she was going to work and then come straight here. She wasn’t looking across the road but I ducked into a nearby stationary store anyway, my heart pounding.\n\nWas Robin cheating on me? She didn’t talk to anyone the entire time I watched her walk away and didn’t seem part of any particular group but she could have met someone inside and left separately. Had she lost her job and was trying to hide it from me? She honestly didn’t seem like the sort of person to neglect to tell me something like that but no theory I could come up with for her pretending to go to work so that she could watch a movie made any kind of sense.\n\nThere was a second hand electronics store on the way on the way to the store and it was at this point that I did something alarmingly out of character. I went inside and asked the bored salesperson behind the desk something stupid.\n\n“Do you sell things that can track cars?”\n\n“Like a GPS tracker? Sure.” he said and walked me over to a selection of small objects in the back corner.\n\nI looked at them with confusion.\n\n“What’s the difference?” I asked.\n\n“Well, those ones are airtags,” he said as he pointed at some small circular keyrings, “so it only works near iphones and if your husband has an iPhone then it will alert him to the fact you’ve put one in his car. Or you know, whoever. These other ones are a few different prices and none of the ones we have in right now will alert his phone and the differences in prices are mostly due to reliability and battery life. I’d go with that one personally.”\n\nI looked at the tracker he was pointing at. It was the second most expensive one in the store so he could be showing me an overpriced piece of junk in the safe assumption I didn’t know any better but given I didn’t have a clue I went with his recommendation.\n\n“Is this really legal?” I asked as we walked back to the desk.\n\n“Legal to sell. As for using it then I suppose it depends what you do with it, like software that tracks what someone does on their phone and all that. It’s perfectly legal for you and your husband to decide that you want a tracker on his car so you can find him easily if he’s in an accident and doesn’t come home. It’s legal to install software on your kid’s phone so if they accidentally see something they shouldn’t have then you’ll know about it. If you’re being sneaky about those things then, I don’t know.”\n\nMy face flushed with shame the second I put the tracker in my bag. Three days ago I’d have done anything for my wife. Now I was figuring out how best to stalk her.\n\nPutting the tracker on Robin’s car wasn’t nearly as difficult as I’d expected. She generally showers after work and the tracker only needed to be affixed to the underside of the car with a magnet. My heart was racing the entire time I did it but Robin had no reason to suspect me. I felt a wave of guilt as soon as I’d done it and a second one when she noticed the banana bread and told me how wonderful I was for making it.\n\nIf I had installed the tracker and it hadn’t showed anything suspicious then I wouldn’t be writing this. If it had merely showed that she was cheating then maybe I’d have been writing *something* but I wouldn’t be posting it here. But the truth turned out to be far more complicated than an affair and the evidence which prompted that realisation didn’t actually come from the tracker at all.\n\nI don’t know the passcode to my wife’s phone. Some partners might see this as concerning but she’s never asked me the code to mine either so I’d always been under the impression that we were both just fine with giving each other a little personal space. I still don’t know the code and given everything I know now I have every reason to believe that it was probably fairly random and secure. However, despite everything I just said, I was able to get into her phone fairly easily.\n\nMy wife sleeps with her eyes open. It isn’t every single night and I’ve never told her about it because it’s just never come up. But that night I saw her open, unseeing eyes and decided to see if I could use her face like that to unlock her phone. It worked straight away and I made a beeline for texts under the name of – Shelley Emmerson. I was dreading sexts. How did it end up being worse than that?\n\nRobin: She’s started talking about Anna. Do I need to bring her in?\n\nShelley: What is she saying exactly?\n\nRobin: No specifics about the project, just that she’s had dreams about her and Anna. She knows that they were in a band together but nothing else has come up in conversation. The dreams with Anna in are nightmares, I don’t know if that matters.\n\nShelley: I see. For now, just continue to observe. We already knew that her time at university wasn’t entirely scrubbed clean and it didn’t need to be to remove all knowledge of the project. A gap where years of her life should’ve been would have been too suspicious anyway. Along as nothing gets worse, this is an acceptable amount of memory.\n\nRobin: Understood.\n\nShelley: If she remembers any additional details then let me know asap. And if she mentions a single detail about the project then that means that the initial wipe didn’t work so relying on a second one is far too risky. So if she recalls anything like that then there’s no point bringing her in. Just eliminate her.\n\nOn reading the last text I dropped the phone and let out a strangled squeak. My eyes darted towards my sleeping wife as she stirred but thankfully I hadn’t managed to wake her. I locked the phone and put it back exactly where I’d found it as I lay back down in bed, terrified beyond belief.\n\n*Just eliminate her.*\n\nWhat the hell had I gotten myself caught up in? And what even was ‘the project’?",

        "text": "Marty was obsessed with lizards. No, not dinosaurs, not dragons, just those tiny, four-legged, slithering things.\n\nI don’t know when or why it started. One day, out of nowhere, lizards were all he talked about.\n\nMarty was an odd kid, one who didn’t seem to fit in, and who was always interested in the most random things. He was also big, tall, almost too tall for his age. At the same time, however, he was a bit slow, shy and reserved. You could’ve called him a gentle giant, if he wouldn’t have been a fourteen-year-old boy.\n\nI thought this lizard thing would be over soon enough. Marty was always quick to get excited about something, but after only a couple of weeks, he’d have moved on.\n\nThis lizard thing was different. He didn’t just like them; he grew obsessed with them.\n\nWe’d have to do a presentation in class and could choose our own topic? Lizards. We’d each put together our own little website during IT class? Marty’s would be about lizards. Even on Halloween, he turned up in a life-sized lizard costume.\n\nIt was the worst during biology class. He’d constantly annoy our teacher, Mrs. Grantle, with questions about lizards and would likewise uh and ah whenever they were mentioned.\n\nGrowing up, Marty and I were pretty close. He lived down the street from me and we hung out a lot. I liked him well enough, but even when we were little, I could tell he was different. \n\nThat might have been the reason his parents got him anything he asked for. His family was very well-off and Marty’s room was filled to the brim with all sorts of toys. He also owned a giant TV and pretty much any video game console you could think of.\n\nAfter the lizard things started, however, his room transformed into a bona fide lizard sanctuary. Gone were the posters of superheroes, now replaced by ones of lizards. His bookshelf, once filled with comic books, was now stacked with books on lizards. He even owned a giant terrarium populated by almost a dozen of them.\n\nThe most annoying part was that he talked about nothing else anymore. I’d mention a cool new movie I’d seen, and he’d tell me about some dumb lizard movie. If we talked about superheroes, he’d bring up some obscure lizard character I’d never heard about.\n\nI told him countless times to knock it off with the dumb lizard stuff, but he never did. Eventually, I just stopped hanging out.\n\nWhile I didn’t remember how this obsession came to be, I remember when the bullying started.\n\nUntil this point, Marty had been ignored by everyone. He just sat in the back of the class, quiet, and busying himself with whatever he was currently interested in. He was pretty much invisible.\n\nThe lizard thing, however, and his irritating behavior soon put him on everyone’s radar.\n\nOne day, he even brought one of his lizards to school, and when I saw it, I knew something was about to happen.\n\nHe’d put the lizard in a tiny box, which he hid during class, but always brought out during breaks. There, in the back, he’d play with it and show it off to those few classmates who hadn’t tired of his lizard stick yet.\n\nOne of them was Stevie. Everyone knew he couldn't care less about lizards. As he stood there, next to Marty, I could hear the sarcasm in his voice as he asked questions and said how cool Marty’s lizard was. Stevie was making fun of him, but Marty was completely oblivious to it.\n\nDuring a later break, when Marty went to the bathroom, Stevie put his plan into motion. He snatched the lizard from Marty’s bag and swiftly hid it in someone else’s, a girl named Cindy.\n\nWhen Marty returned, he noticed his lizard was gone and began searching for it everywhere. No one said a word, of course, not even those who’d seen what Stevie had done. For a while, Marty darted across the room in a panic, trying desperately to find it. When the bell rang, however, our teacher entered the room and commanded Marty to return to his seat. As he sat there, his face was one of misery, and I could tell he was close to tears.\n\nOnly a few minutes later, someone screamed. It was Cindy, and right there on her arm was Marty’s lizard.\n\n“Larry!” Marty called out.\n\nBefore he could do anything, Cindy brushed the lizard off her arm, and, in disgust, trampled it.\n\nMarty lost it completely, rushed over and started laying into her for ‘killing his friend.’\n\nIt took the combined might of our teacher and three classmates to drag Marty of her. By then, Cindy was crying, had a bleeding nose, and a painfully swollen eye.\n\nMarty got in a lot of trouble for that. He was sent to the principal, got suspended for an entire week, and his parents had to come over for a serious talk. By this point, many of the teachers had noticed Marty’s weird obsession, and not a few of them had grown concerned over it.\n\nWhen Marty returned to school, everyone had heard about the incident, about Lizard Boy’s freak-out, as they referred to him.\n\nI knew it was Stevie who’d spread the story and came up with the name, and from this day onward, he made it a sport to tease Marty.\n\nWhat started out as name-calling and silly jokes soon turned into full on bullying.\n\nPeople would dump dead lizards into Marty’s backpack. He’d get beaten up after school. At one point, he was even forced to come to school in his stupid lizard costume and crawl through the hallways on all fours.\n\nIt was nasty. Yet Marty never stopped talking about lizards. I just didn’t get it.\n\nOne day, on my way home, I walked up to him.\n\n“Why don’t you just stop it with the lizard stuff already?” I asked.\n\nMarty turned around, and for a few seconds, he just stared at me with wide eyes, as if I’d insulted him. Then he beamed at me.\n\n“No way, Andy, lizards are just way too cool!” he answered.\n\n“See, that’s why everyone’s making fun of you!”\n\n“I don’t really mind.”\n\n“You don’t mind being bullied or beaten up?”\n\nFor a second, I could see his smile waver. Then it returned, and whatever thought had come to his mind vanished again.\n\n“Hey, Andy, you want to see something super cool?”\n\n“What is it?”\n\nI was about to ask him if this was about lizards again, but before I could, he leaned in close, bringing up his face in front of mine. His expression was serious, conspiratorial even.\n\n“If I show you, you’ve got to promise me not to tell anyone!”\n\nI sighed, but then nodded. To be honest, I felt bad for him.\n\n“Yeah, sure, Marty,” I mumbled.\n\n“All right, but we got to go somewhere first!”\n\nWith that, Marty turned around and hurried to the nearby grocery store. Not knowing what else to do, I set out after him.\n\nOnce I was inside, I saw Marty rush through the aisles, using his heavy frame to push other customers aside. Here and there, I heard curses, or someone calling after him to watch it, but Marty was indifferent to it all. When I’d caught up to him, I found him standing in front of the meat aisle. For a few moments, he studied the various packages before he picked on and headed for the counter.\n\n“Why are you getting-?” I started, but didn’t get to finish the question.\n\nMarty stared at me with wide eyes, and put a finger over his lips, as if whatever he was doing was a secret.\n\nOnce we’d left the store, he didn’t head home. Instead, he turned in a different direction.\n\n“Come on, Andy,” he whispered to me.\n\n“Where are we even going?”\n\nOnce more, he shushed me. As we walked on, he tried his best to hide his heavy frame, trying not to be seen. His eyes darted here and there, watching his surroundings until we’d made it to a building at the edge of town. When Marty saw no one was around, he dashed towards a path that led to the forest next to our town.\n\n“Hey, Marty, just tell me where we’re going!”\n\n“It’s somewhere super cool!”\n\n“Yeah, but what is it? Why’d you get the meat? Is it for a cat or something?”\n\nI reasoned he might have befriended a stray, or maybe a bunch of them, and had gotten the meat for them.\n\n“Not, it’s for the lizards!” he finally answered in an almost giddy voice.\n\nI stopped and stared at him. Of course, this was about freaking lizards.\n\n“Are you serious?”\n\nHe began nodding vehemently, his face full of enthusiasm.\n\n“Yeah! Don’t you want to see them? They are, like, super cool! I found this nest out in the forest, and they look awesome! Their colors change all the time, and they are different from any other lizards. It’s like a new species or something. Come on, Andy, I bet they are hungry already and there’s probably even more of them now! I wonder if there’s even bigger ones, you know? That would be so freaking cool!”\n\n“I should’ve known this was about lizards again.”\n\n“Well, yeah, but they aren’t just-“\n\n“No, Marty, I don’t care! I don’t give a shit about your stupid lizards!”\n\nWith that, I turned around and stormed off. I couldn’t believe it, but to be honest, I shouldn’t have expected anything else.\n\nAfter that day, I really had enough of Marty, and soon I joined into the various jokes about him.\n\n“Yeah, he’s probably part lizard himself,” I said to one of my friends, Tommy, as we stood in front of our lockers a few days later.\n\n“I bet his parents are reptilians! That’s why they got so much money,” Tommy added.\n\nWe both started laughing. \n\n“You know what he told me the other day? He said he’d found this weird lizard nest in the forest and-“\n\n“What’s that about a lizard nest?”\n\nIt was Stevie, with his friend Connor in tow. In an instant, they pushed Tommy aside and cornered me.\n\n“Oh, eh, hey Stevie,” I mumbled. “Lizard Boy told me he found this nest out in the forest and went to feed them or something.”\n\nStevie’s face distorted into a grin.\n\n“You hear that?” he asked, turning to Connor.\n\n“Bet he isn’t just feeding them though,” Connor brought out, laughing. “He’s a lizard lover, after all.”\n\nI sighed. As much as I was sick of Marty’s shit, I couldn’t stand the two of them.\n\n“So, where is it?”\n\n“No clue, somewhere in the forest, I guess.”\n\nWith that, I tried to push myself past them, but Stevie pulled me back instantly.\n\n“Yeah, but he showed it to you, right?”\n\n“No, he did not. I didn’t want to see his stupid lizards.”\n\n“You sticking up for Lizard Boy?” Connor barked at me.\n\n“What? No, I-“\n\n“Yeah, are you a lizard, too, Andy?” Stevie laid into me.\n\n“Fuck off,” I yelled at him, which promptly landed me in a headlock.\n\n“You know, Andy,” Stevie started. “Ever since Lizard Boy’s been skipping out on us, we’ve gotten really bored. Maybe we’ll start hanging out with you instead. How about that?”\n\n“Fine! I’ll show you where he entered the stupid forest, but I swear, I’ve got no idea where the stupid nest is! I think he always goes there right after school, so if you wait for him-“\n\n“Oh no, Andy, you’re coming, too. In case you’re lying to us.”\n\n“Yeah, to make sure you aren’t a lizard,” Connor added, laughing.\n\nAnd so, once classes had ended, I found the two of them already waiting for me.\n\n“There he is! Are you excited about our little lizard hunt, Andy?”\n\nOnce more, I sighed, but gave him a nod, not wanting to end up in another headlock.\n\nMarty was already gone, and had snuck out of school via the back entrance, like he so often did these days. He was probably on his way to the store already.\n\nInstead of leading Stevie and Connor there, however, I showed them the path from which Marty had entered the forest. For long minutes, we lay in wait, hidden between the bushes, but Marty was nowhere to be seen. I could tell Stevie was growing restless, angry even.\n\n“Where the hell is he? If you’re lying to us, I’m going to beat the shit out of you, Andy!”\n\n“I don’t know. Maybe he’s still at the store. Or maybe he’s not coming today. How the hell’d I know?”\n\nRight away, Connor slapped me across the back of the head. I cursed in pain and glared at him.\n\n“What’s that? You want to pick a fight?”\n\n“Shut up, idiots! There he is!” Stevie suddenly whispered.\n\nHe was right.\n\nJust like the day before, Marty hurried down the street, his eyes darting here and there, trying his best to stay hidden behind buildings. Then he’d made it to the dirt path and went on his way into the forest. As he walked past us, I saw how giddy with excitement he was.\n\nFor a while longer, we sat there. Then we set out after him, carefully not to be seen.\n\nWe walked for what must’ve been almost half an hour before he stopped in front of a small rock formation. For long seconds, he just stood there, but then he found what he’d been looking for: a small gap between the rocks. We watched as he approached it, and then, grunting, pushed himself through.\n\nWhen we’d reached the gap as well, we saw how he approached some sort of crevice. He put down his backpack and then set down as well. He rummaged through his backpack before he pulled out a pack of meat. Then he opened it and threw piece after piece down the crevice.\n\n“You’ve gotten really hungry, haven’t you?” Marty asked, giggling.\n\nRight away, Stevie pushed me forward, motioning for the gap. Once I was through, he and Connor followed.\n\n“Well, what do we have here?” Stevie brought out in a sing-song voice with a big grin on his face. “If it isn’t little Lizard Boy!”\n\nMarty froze. Then, slowly, he turned around, his eyes wide with fear.\n\nHe opened his mouth to say something, but closed it again when he saw me standing behind Stevie and Connor. I could see the shock on his face at my betrayal.\n\nI instantly looked away and shuffled around as Stevie and Connor approached him.\n\n“We’ve missed you, Lizard Boy. Why didn’t you tell us about this place? I mean, we’re friends, aren’t we?”\n\n“What do you want, Stevie?” Marty asked in a meek voice.\n\n“What was that? Why don’t you speak up Lizard Boy?” Stevie yelled at him.\n\n“Yeah, speak up, you stupid lizard!” Connor added.\n\n“Stop screaming, you’re scaring them!” Marty suddenly brought out, in a voice much louder than anyone would’ve expected.\n\nThis outburst landed him a punch from Stevie, and he went down.\n\n“Now let’s have a look at those stupid lizards,” Stevie said, pushing himself past Marty.\n\nWhen he reached the crevice, however, an expression of disgust came over his face.\n\n“The hell are those?” he spat.\n\n“Leave them alone!” Marty called out, trying to get up.\n\nBy now, however, Connor had reached him and pushed him down again, restraining him.\n\nStevie still hadn’t moved, and driven by curiosity, I stepped up to the crevice as well.\n\nWhat I saw down there were lizards, all right, but they were much bigger than those I’d seen in Marty’s terrarium.\n\nThey were strange whitish things, but I could see their scales shimmer in the light, their color slightly shifting as if they were cheap imitations of chameleons. Their heads, too, looked different. It was their eyes, I realized after a brief moment. They were in the wrong place, not at the side, but at the front of their heads. The strangest thing about them, however, was the way they moved. They weren’t so much slithering over the ground, but crawling.\n\nI watched in fascination as one of them reached a chunk of meat. Instead of biting into it, it tore at it with one of its clawed feet. Feet that almost resembled miniature hands.\n\nI shivered as I stared at the creatures down there. What the hell had Marty found out here?\n\n“Those things are disgusting,” Stevie finally said.\n\nI didn’t like him. Hell, I hated him for dragging me out here, but he had a point.\n\n“They not disgusting! They are awesome!” Marty blurted out.\n\nStevie turned around, now grinning again.\n\n“Oh, you think so, Lizard Boy? Then why don’t you go down there and play with them?”\n\n“I can’t! They’ll get scared and run away and never come back!”\n\n“Is that so?” Stevie asked, getting a hold of Marty’s backpack.\n\n“Well, that’s too bad. I guess you can’t get this back then.”\n\nWith that, he threw Marty’s backpack down into the crevice. The lizards scattered and fled back to a cave at the end of the crevice, watching the backpack wearily. Then they slowly approached it.\n\n“No, why’d you do that?” Marty called out. “If they smell humans, they might hide and never come out again!”\n\n“What are you going to do about it, Lizard Boy?”\n\nIn an onset of anger, Marty freed himself from Connor, pushed him aside, and rushed Stevie. Before Stevie could react, Marty threw himself at him, and with surprising strength, pushed him away from the crevice and the lizards below. Stevie stumbled back a few steps before he tripped and crashed to the floor. I could hear him curse up in pain.\n\n“You shouldn’t have done that, Lizard Boy,” he spat as he pushed himself back up.\n\nStevie was furious now, and I could see the mad grin on his face. In an instant, he was back in front of Marty and began laying down on him. Marty raised his arms to protect himself from Stevie’s onslaught, but I saw him backing away. He took one step, then another, and finally tripped over a rock.\n\nMarty tumbled backward, lost his footing, and a moment later, he was gone.\n\nEverything was quiet. The only audible sound was that of the lizards below us.\n\nThen I heard a thump as Marty landed right between them. The strangest of sounds reached my ears. It sounded almost like a dull ‘uff,’ but also entirely different.\n\nWith weak, shaking legs, all three of us stepped forward. Marty lay on the ground, down in the crevice, not moving.\n\nSuddenly, his eyes fluttered open, and he stared up at us with a pleading expression, which was quickly replaced by rage. He moved, was about to push himself up, but then he fell down again. His eyes fall shut, his face went limp, and I watched as a small trickle of blood ran from his mouth.\n\n“Fuck!” Stevie brought out.\n\nThen he and Connor turned around, dashed towards the gap, and were gone a second later.\n\n“M-Marty?” I called out.\n\nNo answer. His eyes didn’t flutter open. He didn’t move. All I saw were those strange lizards which began circling him.\n\nAs I stared at him down there, panic washed over me. Oh god, he was dead. Marty was dead. He’d fallen and now...\n\nNot knowing what else to do, I ran. I was scared, confused, but most of all, I felt guilty.\n\nI thought about telling someone, to call for help. Yet I was the one who’d brought Stevie there. I was the one responsible. It was my fault. It was all my fault!\n\nThe moment I’d made it home, I locked myself in my room. I was out of it, shaking, couldn’t sit still. I tried to tell myself Marty was all right. It wasn’t that big a fall. Sure, he’d probably gotten hurt, but it wasn’t like he’d die from something like that!\n\nWhen my parents called me down for dinner, I just sat there, at the table, not moving. I ate nothing, I couldn’t. After only a few minutes, I got up and went back to my room, ignoring my parents as they called after me.\n\nI didn’t sleep that night. I just lay in bed as Marty’s fall replayed in front of my eyes. Once more, I saw him staring up at us, saw his pleading expression, his anger, and then the blood trickling from his mouth.\n\nStill, I told myself, he was probably all right, he had to be.\n\nAll those thoughts were crushed when Marty’s seat remained empty the next day.\n\nAfter school, I found myself cornered by Stevie and Connor. They, too, were out of it. But then Stevie threatened me.\n\n“You keep your mouth shut Andy, or I swear...”\n\nI saw him reach into his pocket, saw the switchblade he was hiding there.\n\n“I promise, Stevie, I won’t say anything!”\n\n“Good, and anyway, we’d just tell everyone it was you who pushed him!”\n\nWith that, the two of them left me behind, more scared than ever.\n\nThe day after, Marty didn’t show up either. By the third day, our teacher told us Marty had gone missing. She appealed to us to come forward if we knew where he might have gone or what might have happened to him.\n\nWhen I heard this, I looked up, but noticed Stevie staring me down. And so, I didn’t say a thing, never did.\n\nA few days later, Stevie approached me again and pushed me against my locker. He was angry, but I also noticed how tired and restless he looked.\n\n“Was it you!?”\n\n“No, I swear, I didn’t say a thing! Why’d you think-“\n\n“What? No, not that! I’m talking about last night! You were at my window, weren’t you? Making these weird sounds, scratching over the class and acting like some freaking lizard!”\n\nBefore I could say anything, he pushed me against the locker once more, this time harder.\n\n“Admit it, Andy! Tell me it was you, for fuck’s sake!”\n\n“No! Why’d I...? What the hell are you even talking about?”\n\nFor a few more seconds, he seemed to probe me, but then let me go and stormed off. As he did, I could hear him curse under his breath.\n\nI just stared after him. What the hell was he talking about? Then I thought about Marty, about his hateful expression.\n\nWhat if he’d been okay after all, but hadn’t gone home? What if he’d stayed there in the forest with these weird lizards and was now coming after Stevie? No, coming after all three of us.\n\nI told myself I was being stupid. If he’d been okay, he’d just gone home. It was freaking Marty we were talking about!\n\nBut then, about a week after Marty’s fall, Stevie didn’t show up to school.\n\nIt was Connor who told me what had happened. The night before, Stevie had sent him a message, telling him that someone had been stalking his house for the past few days. Eventually, when he saw a figure standing at his window, he’d had enough. He wrote he was going to finish Lizard Boy for good. It was the last thing anyone ever heard from him.\n\n“What if it really is freaking Lizard Boy?” Connor asked. “What if he’s really come back and-?”\n\n“We’re talking about Marty here!” I countered.\n\n“Yeah, but then, who else could it be? Why’d they come after Stevie? No one else knows what we did!”\n\nI just stared at him, not sure what to say.\n\n“Fucking hell,” Connor spat at me, and hurried away.\n\nThree days later, Connor was gone, too. His story, however, was different. He hadn’t just vanished. Apparently, someone had broken into his room in the middle of the night. When his parents were awoken by the noise, they stormed into his room. They found the window destroyed, the room in a state of utter chaos. Yet no hint of Connor or the intruder remained.\n\nAt this point, the disappearances caused an uproar in town. Three kids had gone missing, had presumably been kidnapped.\n\nSchool was cancelled, a state of emergency was declared, and curfews were enacted.\n\nThey question all of us. Yet somehow, I didn’t come clean. I couldn’t I was too scared to say anything, to admit what we’d done. I felt guilty. If I’d said something earlier, but now...\n\nBefore long, a search was started. First by the police, but soon, many of the townspeople joined in. They found nothing.\n\nI grew detached during these days, reclusive and retreated to my room. I was riddled with guilt, but more so, I was afraid. What if it really was Marty? What if he’d really come for them, and was now coming for me as well?\n\nBy this point, my fear had grown irrational and had transformed him into some sort of lizard hybrid. In my mind, he was a slithering, scaly monstrosity, just waiting for me to be alone so he could come and drag me away.\n\nBefore long, more people went missing. Two more kids were snatched from their homes, as they referred to it. Two kids, who, like me, had taken part in tormenting Marty. Then it was our biology teacher, Mrs. Grantle.\n\nEventually, even the search parties weren’t safe from Marty’s wrath. One day, eleven men set out in another search of the forest. Amongst them the fathers of Stevie and Connor. Come evening, only seven of them returned. The rest should stay missing.\n\nTonight, as so many times before, I lay in bed, not able to sleep. It was long past midnight when I heard something from outside. I told myself it was just the wind, repeated it over and over again. Yet the lie didn’t work. The sounds were too loud, almost like footsteps echoing from below my second-story window.\n\nOh god, I thought, it was Marty. He’d finally come for me!\n\nAt first, I wanted to hide, but then I went up to the window. Maybe, just maybe, I could reconcile with him, apologize and tell him to stop this crazy revenge of his.\n\n“Marty, I’m sorry, I didn’t-“ I called out, half-crying.\n\nThen my voice trailed off. In the dim light of the room, I could see a figure below my window. It stared up at me with cold, reptilian eyes.\n\nYet whoever or whatever this figure was, it was much too big for even Marty, much too scaly. Its skin was strangely white, but then, it seemed to change, to adapt to the dim light from my window.\n\nI saw clawed, scaly hands, and a long reptilian head. The creature opened its mouth, releasing a screech before it began scaling the wall.\n\nI screamed and scrambled back from the window. At that moment, lights went on all over the house. I heard the creature hiss, heard it let go of the wall, and watched as it slithered away into the darkness of the night.\n\nI just sat there, on the floor, staring out the window in sheer and utter horror. When parents came into the room, asking me what was wrong, what had happened, I wasn’t able to say anything.\n\nMarty’s words as he spoke to the strange lizards in the forest reverberated inside my mind.\n\n“You’ve gotten so hungry, haven’t you?”\n\nAnd then, another thing he’d said came to my mind.\n\n“I wonder if there’s even bigger ones, you know? That would be so freaking cool!”\n\nOh god, I realized. I had it all wrong. It wasn’t Marty, it never had been.\n\nI don’t know what Marty had discovered out there. I don’t know what those things are, but I know they aren’t just lizards.\n\nAfter Marty fell, after he’d died, they’d gotten their first taste and they must’ve realized there’s more of us.\n\nAnd now, they are coming for us, [for all of us.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=UpdateMeBot&amp;subject=Subscribe&amp;message=SubscribeMe!%20%2Fr%2Fnosleep%20%2Fu%2FRehnWriter)\n\n[YT](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXKQbQnB1k_FTnTMyNudIFA/)\n\n[WS](https://rehnwriter.com/)",

        "text": "\nThe title is self - explanatory, and to be honest with you, I’m sure that most people who work in call centres feel the same way, most of the time that they come in. But last week, I genuinely wish I had stayed in bed and called in sick, not like the other times when I just didn’t ‘feel’ like being at work.\n\n \n\nIn my job, like most call centres, there was a strict ‘no hang up’ policy. In some call centres, if someone was being strange or the call was not progressing productively, you could hang up with no repercussions, but in mine, you had to stay on the call. The only exception was if they were swearing at you personally, or if they were being racist, sexist etc. Basically, you could have someone screaming and shouting at you for 45 minutes and if they didn’t say anything that would warrant a call termination, you had to suck it up and deal with it. This is the rule that unravelled my life.\n\n \n\nLast week, my day started as normal, i.e. calls would come in, I’d take details from them, I’d fix their issues/argue with them about it or just transfer them to the correct department etc, but there was a call that came in that felt… strange. Maybe it was the breathing on the other end of the line, or the general feeling of dread that seemed to emanate from the phone, but to put it simply, before words were exchanged, I knew that I didn’t want to take this call. I took a deep breath, and because its, you know, my job, I started to talk.\n\n \n\n“Good morning, you’re through to Ryan, how can I help today?” I hesitantly said, hoping that the call would cut out.\n\n \n\n“Life is strange, don’t you think?” a voice said, sounding like air was being forced through a small hole.\n\n \n\nUsually, when callers didn’t let me know what the problem was after I asked, or when they engaged in pleasantries by asking me how I was, I’d ask again to push the conversation on, but the first thing this man said to me threw me off track.\n\n \n\n“Uhh... how so?” I asked, knowing that life is strange but weirdly wanting to know what his answer was, and more importantly, why those were his first words to me.\n\n \n\n“Well, there’s 30 people in your call centre, so to put it into numbers, there was a 1/30 chance that I would get you. If your colleague, Jack, didn’t ask that person if there was anything else that they could help them with, or if the lady talking to Sarah accepted that they weren’t going to get paid tomorrow due to a clerical error, their calls would have finished before I called and my call would have gone through to them, or any of your other 27 colleagues. Look at Michael, he’s even playing games on his phone!”\n\n \n\nI was so confused. Was this a prank? Was this a bored QA officer who was throwing me a curve ball to see how I would react to a weird call? I didn’t know the reason, and to be frank, I didn’t care anymore. I just wanted this guy off my line. I thought I would try the old ‘Is there anything else I can help with, or is that all today?’ as 9 times out of 10, callers hung on the ‘is that all’ and said ‘no, that’s all’, saving me extra time on the call, but this guy was the 1 time out of 10 as he chuckled lightly and let me know that this call wasn’t going to end so easily.\n\n \n\n“Ryan” he said, dragging my name out with a ‘tsk tsk tsk’, “We haven’t even started yet.”\n\n \n\nThere was a subtle feeling of heaviness that slowly but surely started to snake up my body, and it made me squirm in my seat a bit. I rarely transferred calls to my manager, because I could confidently deal with most of the calls I received and I knew that they were busy dealing with managerial things, but I really didn’t care if I failed QA for this call by transferring it.\n\n \n\n“I’m going to put you on hold, if that’s ok?” I said, my finger hovering over the hold button, waiting for confirmation so that I could press that magical button and speak to my manager, but it was to no avail.\n\n \n\n“You can try my dear boy, but it won’t work” the airy voice chuckled.\n\n \n\nFeeling rebellious, and a bit scared at this point. I quickly pressed the hold button, but instead of hearing the beautiful tranquillity of silence, which the hold button was created for, I heard the chuckle again. The first time I heard it, it was strange, the 2nd time it was a bit eerie, and now it was downright creepy.\n\n \n\n“They never listen” the caller chuckled, forcing the feeling of heaviness further up my body, becoming heavier as it went.\n\n \n\nI silently asked myself ‘What the hell have I got myself into?’, and as if he was a mind reader, he answered with “You don’t want to know my dear boy, but you’re going to find out.”\n\n \n\nUtterly giving up with the call, I ripped my headset off and turned to tell my manager, but what I saw wasn’t what I expected to see. Tommy was at his computer, as I expected him to be, but it was like he was a statue. He looked greyish, and when I called out to him, he didn’t answer. I thought he was a part of this strange call, like some call centre banter between management and QA so I strode around to him and went to speak to him properly.\n\n \n\n“Tommy?” I asked, hoping that he would burst into laughter and tell me it was all a joke, but all I got was silence and a blank stare. I nudged him, and it was like he was made of stone.\n\n \n\n“Tommy?” I asked again, hoping that he was playing the long game, and seeing how far he could push this, but then I looked at his eyes.\n\n \n\nHis eyes were glazed over and grey, to the point where it was like he had grey snooker balls in his eye sockets inside of eyeballs. The sight of that forced a little scream from my lips, and as I looked around for anyone that could help, I realised something that nearly floored me. Everyone was like this. As I looked around the call centre, all I could see were these grey – eyed statues, sat upright in their chairs, staring straight ahead.\n\n \n\nI was going crazy. I must have been. My mind started to race, and I thought about all the things that happened throughout the day before that call came in. Was it something I ate, or was it something I drank? Was I even here, or was this an extremely long and drawn-out dream? I pinched myself, and it hurt. I suddenly realised that I was stood in the middle of the call centre, not knowing what was going on, and the 2nd thing I realised was the silence. I’ve heard the term ‘the silence was deafening’ before and I thought that it was an oxymoron, but in that moment, I knew exactly what it meant. The silence was so intense that I could hear the synapses in my brain firing.\n\n \n\nI decided that my job wasn’t worth being in this situation (what is?) and I went to leave without a single care, but for reasons unbeknownst to me, I couldn’t leave. It was like there was something in front of me that was stopping me, but I couldn’t see it nor feel myself walking into it. My legs would just stop working whenever I tried to take a step towards the door, but they would work walking towards the sides of the room or the back.\n\n \n\nAlmost inaudibly, there was a sound that I could just about pick up on if I strained my ears, and the sound got louder the closer I got to my desk. It was coming from my phone. It was laughter. The laughter was starting to echo and reverberate around my head, and a voice from deep within the confines of my mind whispered “look around.”\n\n \n\nI looked around, and that feeling of heaviness completely enveloped me and turned into an ice cold vice because the first thing I noticed was that instead of looking straight ahead, everyone in the call centre was now looking at me. Silently and blindly, they stared at me, and in that moment, I knew two things. I didn’t want them to stand up, and secondly, they wanted me to go back to my phone. Taking a deep gulp from the soles of my feet, I walked towards my desk and sat down.\n\n \n\nPicking up my headset and putting it on my head felt like I was lifting a car, because whilst my body was responding to my brain’s instructions, my brain was simultaneously trying to override itself to protect me. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, I got the headset back into place and waited for the voice to speak.\n\n \n\n“My dear boy, you didn’t expect your day to turn out like this did you?” the voice asked, his voice a nice change from the laughter that was bouncing around my head moments ago.\n\n \n\n“No, I… Uhh...” came out of my mouth with difficulty, as if my mouth was sewn shut and I was forcing my lips to move.\n\n \n\n“I bet you’re wondering why I picked you, right?” the voice asked me. Answering his question, he continued. “I didn’t pick you. The reason why its you who has this call and not blonde Mia, or Andy three rows down from you is because you answered. James’ call finished a second after you answered, a second was the difference between James having this call and you. Ask me the question that’s on your tongue.”\n\n \n\n“Who… What are you?” I probed, my mouth as dry as sandpaper.\n\n \n\nThe voice chuckled again. “There it is. I’m Dread. Nice to meet you Ryan.”\n\n \n\nI thought it was just a surname but based on everything that happened since I took the call, I knew that there was more to the name than what I hoped. It dawned on me that this wasn’t a person that I was talking to. It was a thing.\n\n \n\n“I can hear your brain whirring my dear boy” he chuckled, “so I’ll put you out of your misery and let you know who, sorry, what I am. As I said, I’m Dread. I am the physical embodiment, so to speak, of according to Google, anticipation with great apprehension or fear.” He laughed at that. Not a chuckle, or the (it seemed like) mocking laughter that felt like bowling balls being thrown around my brain earlier. This was genuine laughter, as if he found it funny that humans were trying to comprehend him, and worse than that, come to a shared definition of what dread was.\n\n \n\n“I’ve already explained why I’m talking to you dear Ryan, but I guess the overarching question that needs to be answered is why I called, right? And the answer is, quite simply, I don’t like people being happy. I don’t like people not dreading things. And if they do dread things, like coming to work for example, I want them to dread it more. It may sound, how do you young people say it? Savage? But this is my essence. This is what I am. I am Dread. Do you think the God of War believes that ‘the pen is mightier than the sword?’ Do you think that water can be anything but wet? Dread is me and I am Dread.\n\n \n\n“I’m sick and tired of baby showers, Instagram, Onlyfans, and all the things in the world that make people happy. When people are happy, they’re not dreading things, and when they’re not dreading things, I must rear my head. Even when they are dreading things, they’re not dreading it enough for my liking. I’m that feeling in your gut when you have to break up with someone. I’m that fear when you have to ‘come out’ to your parents. Think about all the scary or unpleasant etc situations in your life and specifically, think about how it made you feel. That. Feeling. Is. Me!”\n\n \n\nAs a complete aside to all of this, I was a heavy drug user in my earlier years. All the things you could think of, and all the things you haven’t heard of, went up my nose, down my throat and in my veins, yet none of it compared to how I felt now, listening to this soliloquy worming its way into my brain. I felt like I was having an out of body experience, but I was rooted to my chair, as if there were thick chains keeping me in place. I simultaneously felt hot and cold, tired and awake, sick and healthy, hungry and full, thirsty and hydrated. I felt like I was drowning in cement. Basically, I was messed up in a way that I’d never been before. And I didn’t know how to stop it.\n\n \n\n“It wasn’t personal today my dear boy, no one got married over the weekend, no one won the lottery etc, I just wanted to spread dread to someone. It’s like the parable of the scorpion and the turtle, have you heard it? It’s a lovely little story. A scorpion asks a turtle to take him across the river, and the turtle feels a sense of dread, you see how my essence is everywhere? And the reason why he feels dread is because its a scorpion, and as we know, scorpions sting. The turtle says no based on that, because he doesn’t want to get stung, but the scorpion protests with solid logic, and tells the turtle that it would be pointless stinging him because if he does, the turtle will get injured, and they would both drown when the turtle can’t support itself or the scorpion.”\n\n \n\n“Concrete logic, right? Well, the turtle thought so too and decided to offer his back to his new companion and off they went across the water. Halfway across, the turtle started to feel like he was being stabbed, and his body started to seize up. Instinctively knowing what had happened, he painfully turned around and looked at the scorpion with wide eyes and an even wider mouth and the look said it all. ‘Why did you do that?’ the turtle asked dejectedly, as he started to sink into the river. ‘It is because it is my nature’ the scorpion replied, gurgling as the water started to fill his mouth. In that story, I am the scorpion my dear Ryan.”\n\n \n\nHe laughed again, but this time, there was a bit of an edge in his laugh that I hadn’t heard before. There is no rhyme or reason why I am, I just am my dear boy.” He told me, making it as clear as possible to me as he could. “I’ve told you why I got through to you, I’ve told you why I called, but the crux of all of this, and the reason why we’re having this conversation, is simply because I want my presence to be known. I don’t actually wish you any harm my dear boy.”\n\n \n\nThroughout everything he was saying, I was utterly frightened to say anything because I didn’t want to run the risk of interrupting him or offending him by not letting him say what he wanted to say. Whilst my mouth felt like it was clamped shut, I didn’t dare try to open it. With the last sentence though, it was like he was giving me an invitation to speak.\n\n \n\n“Uhh… what do… uh what do you mean?” I asked, my voice quivering like I was asking a bully to leave me alone.\n\n \n\nHe laughed at this, sounding like a foghorn on a ship. “I’m not a monster my dear Ryan. Sure, I like it when people feel dread, but I don’t want anyone to feel physical pain. That’s not my job, and to be honest, as I’m sure you already know, you don’t want to meet those guys. I’m all about the emotional pain, the things you have to say or do but don’t want to etc. And basically, my dear boy, at the end of an interesting, albeit long conversation, I just wanted you to know that. I wanted you to know that I am still here, and that I will never go away. You may not see me, or even feel me, but rest be assured, I will be there. Look at what I’ve done to your colleagues. Turn around and look at them.”\n\n \n\nI didn’t have to turn that far, because I slightly turned to my right and I saw a torso. Instead of stopping, I decided to turn my head a bit further and I saw more torsos. It was like a car crash, because I didn’t want to look, but I had to. Looking up, I nearly fainted when I saw what was happening. My colleagues had surrounded me and blocked me in, so close that I had no idea how I didn’t feel their presence sooner. They were stood at the side and behind me, like a mob, all staring at down at me with their grey eyes. I don’t know how or when or why it happened, but it had, and I felt like an avalanche had collapsed on me. Even though no words were said in regards to it, I knew that he had made them do it, just like he had made them go grey eyed and statuesque, and creepily look at me earlier. I quickly turned back and silently prayed that he didn’t do anything more with my colleagues, because with how close they were to me, anything else wouldn’t have ended well for me.\n\n \n\n“I have power like you will never know my dear boy, but there was something about you which made me restrain myself today. Today was just a taste. And that is all it will be today. Thank you for an interesting call, and as I said, I will be around. I just wanted to put the frighteners on you today. And I’m sure you’ll say I succeeded. Goodbye my dear boy.”\n\n \n\nThe call cut out, and it was like I had been deaf my whole life and heard for the first time because the call centre roared to life. It was like my life was a tv show that was paused and the viewer had just pressed play. I could hear the calls, I could hear the hum of the printer, and I could hear my colleagues laughing in the break room. I rubbed my eyes a few times and looked at the time. It was 12:15. I took that call at 12:15.\n\n \n\nI slowly turned around and saw Tommy, and upon seeing me, he laughed at me. “Have you been showering here or something?” I suddenly became aware of my body again and I realised that I was covered in sweat, from head to toe. Whilst the call centre was back to normal, I couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was very off. Not wanting to be in this place any longer, I told Tommy I was feeling sick and left in a hurry.\n\n \n\nWhat was the reason for me telling this story you ask? The reason why is because I haven’t forgotten that call. I haven’t been back to work since I left, and I’m not going to go back. I am not going to put myself in a position where it could happen again. I’ve turned my phone off and it’s stayed off since I left that day because I was frightened that he would call me again on my personal number. I haven’t left my house or had any contact with the outside world for a week. I’ve been trying to wrap my head around the whole ordeal, and I still don’t have any answers that I’ve understood nor accepted.\n\n \n\nAs much as I’ve wanted him to, he hasn’t forgotten about the call either. I’ve just received an email from an unknown source. With my hands being pulled towards my mouse by an invisible force, I begrudgingly opened my email inbox and looked at the screen defeated. Tears are falling from my eyes right now as I’m reading the subject box – ‘Hi my dear boy. Did you miss me?’ I’ve tried to turn my laptop off but the glare from the screen is still lighting up my dark bedroom. I’ve thrown my laptop at the wall and it has re-appeared in my lap. From my wardrobe came a light chuckle.\n\n \n\n“Told you I’d be around didn’t I, my dear boy. You didn’t think it would be so soon, did you? As I told you last time, there’s just something about you.” a voice said from the darkness at the end of my bedroom, reminding me that this wasn’t and would never be over.",

        "text": "  \n\nI’m running. \n\nI haven’t heard any screams for at least a minute by now. I haven’t heard anything besides my own panicked breathing and my boots stomping through dried leaves and sticks.\n\nI hear a loud crack as my foot sinks into the darkness of the forest floor, like when your foot falls through the empty space of where you thought the last stair was. I hope to God that noise was a large branch but only the forest knows how the nights been. Excruciating pain shoots through my shin and calf like lightning as I put weight on it. That was no branch. I have to stop. I’m alone now. I left her there. I had to. \n\nIn a panic, I stumble over the roots and leaves trying to hold myself up by hanging onto a tree... My chest heaves as my heart threatens to burst at any moment. My throat stings from hyperventilating. My jaw is clenched and my whole body is shaking like a leaf. I can’t stop grinding my teeth from the pain. My eyes burn from the sweat and are sealed tight from the strain of just trying to slow my breathing. I’m making too much noise. I can’t think about my leg right now. It’s so dark, I can barely see the mud all over my dirty jeans. I’m too scared of running my hand down my leg and finding sharp bone protruding from the skin. \n\nI bury my face into the dry, unforgiving bark of the tree. \n\n“FUUCK!” I cry to myself.\n\n“What do I do?! What do I do?! What do I do?! What do I do?!” as the terror finally sets in. \n\nTears force their way down my face. Adrenaline is the only thing keeping me conscious. I’m in shock and I know it. Trembling. The searing pain in my throat only intensifies with every breath, as I panic-cry into this tree. The bark scraping its way through my forehead. \n\n“EZRAAAAAAA! HELP ME!!! EZRAAAHHHHUHHHH! AHHHHHHHH!!!” \n\nThe sound jolts me back to life.\n\n“That’s not her! It can’t be her. No... There’s no way… “I think. Confused. \n\n…\n\n“…I fucking left her there. Oh, fuck fuck fuck…” I cry to myself.\n\n“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry… FUCK! Oh God... oh God please! I’m sorry…” I continue rambling to myself as tears fill my eyes again.\n\nTrying to stand up straighter, my leg brushes the tree and I feel the lightning again. It feels like the only thing keeping my leg together are my pants. I flex my toes and ankle. Movement. Pain.\n\n“EZRAAAA!!! HELP ME!!!” the gargled voice speaks again from somewhere behind me. \n\nThe air is still. \n\nIt’s using her voice. A cruel reminder and a clever deception to guilt any unsuspecting prey.\n\nI can feel my heart racing, sending pulses through me. I can hear my heart beating in my ear like a drum. \n\nBUH-BUM. BUH-BUM. BUH-BUM. \n\n“EZRAAA!!!” the voice booms through the woods even closer than just a second ago.\n\nThe closer the voice gets, the more you hear how wrong it is. The white noise of a TV with no signal. The sound of a million voices screeching in pain. Steak knives being forced across a glass plate. A spoon banging against your teeth when you eat too fast. Nails dragging along a chalkboard. \n\n…and Amaya. My Amaya. Her voice. Distorted and drowned out by the others as it fails to claw its way to the surface. \n\nI bang my head against the tree as the final memories of my wife flash through my mind. The sound of her garbled last cries for help as that thing ripped into her with nails and teeth sharper then blades. Grabbing her abdomen in one long boney hand. Gripping her in its clutches and rag dolling her body in its jaws like a shark in a frenzy. Tearing at her blood drenched clothes like wet pieces of paper as it pulled and broke her into pieces. Towering over her crimson lifeless corpse. It’s over in an instant. Staring at the massacre of my wife. Staring at this thing as it stands, hunched over the bits and pieces of her. Dark grey skin stretched over mangled bone. Long sharp vertebrae poking through its back to make a nightmare strip of railroad spikes. Long arms that stretch toward the ground and drag through the dirt. Folds of different colored skin and tufts of hair and fur cover most of the exposed chunks of meat and ribcage.\n\nThe sound of crunching bones and wet flesh being torn to shreds like a pack of starving wolves ravaging the carcass of their latest kill. \n\nMy Amaya. The haunting image of her shattered remains. The top half of her body cast aside, arm and face pointed in my direction. Blood slithering out of her nose and mouth. \n\nHer beautiful eyes gazing at me… her lifeless eyes looking through me.\n\nI can’t gather my senses. My hand reaches to the back of my head where my fingers clumsily prod at a gash bloody hair. My back dragging up against tree that had become my front row view of the nightmare before me. The snap of a twig as I get to my feet. \n\nI glance up. The creature rips it head around, looking at me over its shoulder with two different colored eyes. Drooping facial skin that’s barely holding together. What’s left of Amaya’s thigh dangling from its insidiously fanged maw. I quiver in fear as it looms over the remains of the woman I loved, with eyes locked on me. We stare at each other for what feels like eternity. Terror gripping me. \n\nIt turns back to finish the meal. I now see that even hunched over, squatting with misshapen legs, it is a behemoth of a creature. \n\nMy fear is renewed as the crunching sounds like bone and slopping sounds of meat being ripped apart fill the air. I make minor movements, backing away from this horrific scene as if my presence is still undiscovered. I turn away and begin to run. I’m running faster than ever before.\n\n“EZRAAAAAAA!!!” the voice wails, snapping me back to the present.\n\nMy eyes flash open. I push off the tree in my last attempt to make it out of this hell.\n\nThe adrenaline runs like a river of ice through my body and every hair on my body stands tall. Dry tears make clear streaks of skin through the valley of dirt that is my face. My sad one-legged hops turn to skips as pain is the least of my concerns. Lightning strikes with every skip, but my leg is still in one piece. Unsure of how much weight it can bear before it snaps, I know I have to risk it. Methodical skipping turns to all out sprinting as my fight or flight takes control. \n\nI can hear something behind me as I continue blindly through the darkness. With every stride, I can feel the fracture in my shin threatening to give way. Like a hammer striking an anvil. The sounds of my boots striking the ground begins to fade as the thuds of that thing closes the distance.\n\n“EZRAAAA!!!” it cries.\n\nWhat at first sounded like a giant stomping after me, became the sound of cracking branches and splintering wood above me. The sound of countless sticks and twigs cracking like fireworks all around me. Like Chinese New Year in my back yard. \n\nA light in the darkness. Barely a glimmer. Flickering faintly.\n\nIt’s the reservation. If I can just make it there… maybe. Just maybe.\n\n“EZRAAAA!!! HELP MEEE!!! AHHHHHHHH!” the screams turn into thunderous roars on the back of my neck.\n\nI’m running.",

        "text": " \n\nThe old, abandoned asylum on the edge of town had always been a source of fear for the locals. The building had stood empty for decades, ever since the patients and staff disappeared without a trace.\n\nBut one day, a group of teenagers decided to sneak into the asylum to see what was inside. They made their way through the dark corridors, their flashlights illuminating the peeling paint and cobwebs that covered everything.\n\nAs they explored deeper into the building, they heard strange sounds coming from the walls. The rustling of papers and the scraping of metal against concrete. But when they looked closer, they couldn't find the source of the noise.\n\nThe air grew colder as they made their way to the basement. The stairs creaked beneath their feet, and the flickering lights cast eerie shadows on the walls. But when they reached the bottom, they found something that made their blood run cold.\n\nThere was a room at the end of the corridor that was unlike any other in the building. The walls were covered in strange symbols, and the air was thick with the smell of decay. And in the center of the room, there was a figure that seemed to be made of shadows.\n\nThe figure didn't move or speak, but the teenagers knew it was watching them. They tried to run, but the doors wouldn't budge. The figure slowly began to move toward them, its form growing larger and more terrifying with each passing second.\n\nThe teenagers screamed as the figure engulfed them in darkness. When the authorities finally found their bodies, they were twisted and contorted into unnatural positions, with looks of terror frozen on their faces.\n\nTo this day, the haunted asylum remains empty, and no one dares to venture inside. But sometimes, on a quiet night, the residents of the nearby town claim they can still hear the sound of screams coming from the building.  \n\n\n As they reached the edge of the forest, they saw a small cabin in the distance, barely visible through the dense fog. They had no other choice but to approach the cabin and seek refuge.\n\nAs they got closer, they could see that the cabin was old and run-down. The windows were boarded up, and the door was barely hanging on its hinges. They hesitated for a moment before knocking on the door, but no one answered.\n\nThey decided to enter anyway and were immediately hit by the smell of mildew and rot. The inside of the cabin was dark and musty, and the only light came from the flickering candles that lined the walls.\n\nAs they made their way further into the cabin, they could feel a sense of unease growing within them. They could hear strange noises coming from the shadows, and every creak of the old wooden floors made their hearts skip a beat.\n\nAs they turned a corner, they saw a figure standing in the shadows. It was a tall, gaunt man with sunken eyes and a crooked smile. He was staring at them with a hunger in his eyes, as if he was sizing them up for something.\n\nThey tried to run, but their legs wouldn't move. It was as if the figure had some sort of power over them. As he drew closer, they could see that he was covered in a thick layer of mold and rotting flesh. The stench was overwhelming, and they could feel their stomachs turn.\n\nHe spoke to them in a low, raspy voice, and his words seemed to echo through the cabin. He told them that they had stumbled upon his home, and that they were now his prisoners. He told them that he would use them for his dark rituals, and that he would feast upon their souls.\n\nAs he reached out to grab them, they managed to break free of his spell and run out of the cabin. They didn't stop running until they were far away from that cursed place.\n\nThey never spoke of that night again, but the memory of the ghostly figure in the cabin haunted them for the rest of their lives. They knew that they had narrowly escaped a fate worse than death, and that they would never forget the horror that they had experienced.",

        "text": "As I looked into the mirrors, tiny black worms seemed to swarm and wriggle behind my pupils. I could barely see the shape of these alien creatures, but their movement was definitely discernible, even far back in my eyeball..\n\n“Ah!” I screamed, grabbing at my face. The flickering fluorescent lights of the mall bathroom strobed through my fingers. Then I felt it: something deep in my guts, thrashing. I doubled over in pain for a moment before collapsing onto the disgustingly dirty marble floors while yelling at the top of my lungs. My vision started to turn gray. I saw my shirt start to bow outwards as *something* ripped its way out of my belly. There was a burning pain as a slimy black worm, as thin as a pencil but many feet long, ripped through my skin and the fabric of my T-shirt. Its body was covered in gore and blood. Warm streams began to soak into my white shirt and run down my belly and chest from the wound. I lay there, staring in horror at the alien abomination as it turned its miniature face to look back at me.\n\nMiniature black eyes stood on stalks, coming off the top of its head. Its mouth opened with a hiss, its lamprey-like mouth showing hundreds of tiny, spike-like teeth as it stood straight up in the air, part of it still inside my belly, looking like a tiny cobra coming out of a basket controlled by an invisible snake charmer. Except instead of a basket, it was my *body.*\n\nI screamed and screamed as I passed out, hearing footsteps running towards me from other parts of the mall before my vision turned black.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nEarlier that day, I had hiked the highest mountain in the state, taking in the endless forests that extended to every horizon and breathing in the fresh spring air. Everything felt just perfect. The endorphins from the intense hiking gave me a sense of inner peace, and I breathed in deep, smelling the flowers and pine trees all around me as the last traces of winter faded under the hopeful warmth of the spring sun. My girlfriend stood next to me on top of the mountain, her blonde hair flowing in the soft breeze.\n\n“This was a good idea,” I said to her, smiling. She nodded.\n\n“It always is, Alex. I love this place,” Anastasia said in her barely discernible Russian accent. “Ever since I moved to the USA as a kid, this has been one of my favorite spots. My family used to come up here to camp all the time.” I looked at my watch, and signaled that it was time to start heading back. We left the fire watchtower, slowly descending the steep steps, and returned to the main trail. The sun had started to descend into twilight.\n\nAs we neared the parking lot, I saw something up ahead on the trail that hadn’t been there on our way up. At first, I had no idea what I was looking at, until Anastasia started to shriek, her hands on her cheeks as she looked ahead in horror. Her blue eyes were wide and staring. I looked from her to the pile of red on the trail, uncomprehending. And yet as I inched closer, understanding started to come to me.\n\nIt was a body. A human body. It looked like it had been ripped apart from the inside. The face was still intact, and I recognized that it was an old Asian woman. Her eyes were looking up blankly at the dying light of the sky. Her belly and chest, though, were totally unrecognizable. The organs had all been eaten away, and now the only thing remaining was a pulpy, bloody mess. The ribs stood straight up, as if something in the center of her body had eaten what it wanted and then, when it decided it felt full, simply pushed its way out of her solar plexus, ripping open the muscle, tendons and skin on its way out.\n\n“What the fuck?” I said. Anastasia still stood behind me, hyperventilating and yelling in incomprehensible gasps. “Anastasia, call the police!” In my panic, I had forgotten that we had no cell service all the way out here. This state park was at least a six mile drive in through dirt roads, and cell phone service only reached the very outer perimeter of the park, not all the way up here in the mountains. Anastasia tried anyway, but rapidly shook her head when she saw the lack of bars.\n\n“OK, OK,” I said, trying to calm myself, “just think.” I backed away from the pile of gore on the trail, hugging Anastasia. She cried into my shoulder.\n\n“We need to get back to the car,” I said, trying to sound much more confident than I actually felt. “We need to drive out of here as fast as we can and call the police.” Then another thought came to me- what if whatever had done that to this poor woman was still here? I pushed Anastasia back away from my shoulder and looked around suspiciously. Suddenly, I felt watched.\n\n“I think we need to go, *now*,” I whispered to Anastasia. My tone seemed to sober her up. Nodding, we clasped hands and began walking towards the car, going around the body and trying not to look at it. I heard rustling and furtive slithering behind me as we left, but I never turned around to look. I didn’t want to see what was there.\n\nOnce we were in the dirt parking lot, I saw my little blue sedan was the only car still left in the park at this hour. I felt a lot better now that we were out of the forest. Anastasia looked a lot better, too. She heaved a deep sigh as I unlocked the car and we both got in. I put on my seatbelt, and Anastasia looked over at me from the passenger seat.\n\n“What do you think that was back there?” she asked. I shrugged.\n\n“Baby, I have no idea,” I said. “I’m just glad we’re out of that place. I have been hiking my entire life, and I have never seen *anything* like that.” I had seen some animal bodies and gore, of course, such as a doe with its throat ripped out on the side of a trail, or the random leg of a buck on the train tracks. Where the rest of its body had gone, I had no idea. I had never figured it out. Maybe the passing train had just sliced off its leg and pushed the rest of the body forward towards a bridge with deep water running underneath further down the tracks, but it had seemed very weird to me at the time.\n\nNothing compared to that old woman, though. Just thinking about it sent chills up my spine. Shuddering, I instinctively reached into my center console and pulled out a bottle of papaya supplement. The pills from this tropical fruit were not only delicious, but they really helped my stomach issues. I used to have constant constipation and bloating, and a naturopath had recommended taking chewable papaya supplements dozens of times throughout the day. I had tried it, and it had worked wonders. Now I eat them every chance I get and barely had any gastrointestinal issues since I started. Putting the small bottle of pills in my pocket, I started the car and we drove off down the dirt road.\n\nOnce we were at the edge of the park, Anastasia called the police on her cell phone, telling the dispatcher everything we had seen. The dispatcher took down our names and phone numbers, in case they needed to ask us any more questions, before proceeding to assure us that both park rangers and police officers were on their way to the body.\n\nAlready, the shock was wearing off, and I realized I was ravenously hungry. There were no fast-food places this far out in the middle of the mountains, but there was a gas station. Anastasia and I stopped at it, my stomach grumbling. I took a couple more papaya pills before we entered the building.\n\nWe walked around, looking at all the junk food and sodas lining each shelf of the place. Anastasia walked over to the open cooler.\n\n“Oh, look, they have sushi!” she said excitedly. I looked down at the plastic-wrapped container, rolled-up balls of white rice and fish surrounded by a thin, black covering. We each grabbed one before getting some Gatorades and returning to the car.\n\nI was hungrier than I had been in a long time. Hiking up steep hills for hours on an empty stomach wasn’t conducive to a clear mind. Opening up the container, I sniffed at the sushi suspiciously. It smelled totally fine. I opened up the soy sauce and began to dip each piece in it, eating the entire tray within a couple minutes, then chugging two Gatorades to finish it off. I felt so much better, and I could tell Anastasia did too.\n\n“That was actually pretty good for gas station food,” Anastasia said, looking over at me. I nodded. “I think that must have been trout.”\n\n“I have absolutely no idea,” I admitted, starting the car. We still had a while to go to get back to the city where we shared an apartment, and Anastasia wanted to stop at the mall on the way before it closed and look for some new books and clothes. I put on an audiobook. We always listened to the same audiobook on long roadtrips, and right now we were listening to “Rainbow Six” by Tom Clancy. Anastasia shook her head in disgust at the evil characters in the book.\n\n“Who would create a virus just to kill nearly everyone on the Earth?” she said, scowling. I shrugged.\n\n“Terrorists, I guess,” I said. “There will always be evil people out there. You have no idea what they’re capable of.”\n\nWe reached the mall twenty minutes later. The parking lot was nearly empty, which was expected for this time of night. It was closing in an hour, and most of the people had already done their shopping and returned home long ago.\n\nMy stomach was doing flips, and I groaned. I could tell Anastasia wasn’t feeling too good either.\n\n“I think something is wrong with my stomach,” I said, grabbing it and bending over slightly to try to relieve the cramping. “I wonder if that sushi was bad or something.” I grabbed the bottle of papaya pills and popped a couple more. They always seemed to help when my stomach hurt or when I had gas or constipation. I offered them to Anastasia, but she shook her head at me.\n\n“I don’t take pills, ever,” she said. “Unless they’re prescribed by a doctor. I think you pop too many of those things. How do you know they won’t make you sick?” I shrugged.\n\n“Suit yourself,” I said. “But these are just fruit enzymes and healthy chemicals. I can’t imagine how they would possibly hurt you.”\n\n“Even vitamins can hurt you if you take too many,” she responded. “I’ve heard of people dying from taking too much vitamin A or other supplements.” Anastasia straightened her back, sighing. “I think the feeling is passing. My stomach feels slightly better. Let’s go and do this before the stores all close.”\n\nWe walked into the mall, the smell of perfumes and pretzels and air conditioning mixing into that characteristic mall smell, and immediately headed towards the bookstore. I wanted to grab some new books to read, maybe some HP Lovecraft or Stephen King that I hadn’t read yet, but as soon as we got to the entrance of the bookstore, Anastasia began to double over in pain.\n\n“Oh God,” she said, “I *really* don’t feel good now.” I grabbed her hand and began to drag her towards the bathrooms. Her face was covered in a sheen of sweat, her eyes wide and staring into the distance. She looked like she barely knew where she was. And as we reached the middle of the bathroom hallway, she grew much, much worse.\n\nShe bent over and spewed a fountain of blood onto the marble floors. More blood began to roll down her face from her eyes, crimson tears that smeared her mascara and make-up. Her mouth was opened in a horrified silent scream, and then she collapsed onto the floor, seizing and kicking wildly, her eyes shooting open and then half-closing with each spasm that rocked her body.\n\n“Anastasia!” I screamed. I pulled my phone out of my pocket and called 911. As soon as the dispatcher answered, I began to yell into the phone. “We need help at \\[REDACTED\\] mall immediately, in the bathroom hallway next to the bookstore. My girlfriend, she’s sick. She’s throwing up blood and she’s having a seizure and I think she might be dying! Please hurry!” Then my stomach began to tighten and twist, and I ran to the bathroom, dropping my phone on the way. I was worried about Anastasia, but I needed to use the bathroom *now*. And there was realistically nothing I could do for her anyway. I didn’t have any medical training. I didn’t even know CPR. All I could do was hope the ambulance and paramedics arrived fast.\n\nI ran into the bathroom, flinging open the stall and sitting down on the toilet. A rush of blood flowed out of me. In horror, I stared into the water of the toilet, which was now covered with pink, foamy, bloody stool. I felt like I would throw up, but I managed to keep it down. I cleaned myself up and hurriedly went to the sink to wash my hands, so that I could get back out and stay with Anastasia while waiting for the ambulance to arrive.\n\nBut as I looked up in the mirror, I saw something moving behind my eyeballs. They looked like little worms…\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI woke up in the hospital an indeterminate time later. I didn’t know if a couple hours had passed or a couple months. I had no time reference and was totally confused. Then a rush of horrifying memories came flooding back to me. I shot up in bed, looking around frantically.\n\nA man in a black suit with black sunglasses sat in the chair next to my bed, playing on his smartphone. As he saw me sit up, he looked up from his phone.\n\n“Oh, good, you’re awake,” he said in a deep voice, his face deadpan and emotionless.\n\n“What…” I began, but he waved his hand at my protesting word, shooing it away like a fly.\n\n“I’m Agent Bowman,” he said. Looking at the reflection of his dark sunglasses, I almost felt like I was looking at a mannequin.\n\n“An agent from where?” I asked. He shook his head.\n\n“Nowhere you have ever heard of, that’s for sure. I’m from a classified agency unknown to the general public. We deal with little issues like you and your girlfriend had at the mall…”\n\n“My girlfriend! Is she alive?” I asked, hopeful. He put his head down.\n\n“Look, I’m sorry to be the one to tell you, but…” That was all the answer I needed. I put my face in my hands and started crying hysterically. He got up, putting a hand on my shoulder. “Listen, Alex, even you are lucky to be alive. You have been in an induced coma for the past week. They have been giving you extremely high doses of anti-parasitic agents intravenously. You had to have three surgeries to get all those *things* out of you. And even then, the doctors weren’t hopeful. But you pulled through.” He pulled out the bottle of papaya pills I kept in my car from a briefcase at his feet. They were in a plastic bag marked “Evidence”.\n\n“My pills!” I exclaimed. He nodded.\n\n“These are the only reason you’re still alive,” he said. “Whatever those things were, apparently the enzymes and chemicals in papaya are deadly to them. You were taking such high doses that you apparently were able to slow down their growth long enough for us to get you the medical treatment necessary to save you. But your girlfriend never took these pills. She had passed away by the time the ambulance arrived. And apparently those things had all crawled out of her, moving off in every direction. We have quarantined the mall and the surrounding area, and my agency is hopeful we can get all of them.”\n\n“And what if you don’t?” I asked, a creeping sensation of dread rising up my back. He simply shook his head, refusing to answer the question.\n\n“OK, but what were they?” I continued, looking up at him, tears still drying on my face. He shrugged.\n\n“Nothing we have ever seen before, that’s for sure,” he said. “We captured some of the smaller ones and sequenced their DNA. They’re totally unrelated to any known parasite or worm on Earth. We don’t know where they came from, to be totally honest. Maybe they were bioengineered by some terrorist group, maybe they fell down from outer space and someone found the eggs and decided to contaminate some local foods with them. We are putting every agent at our disposal towards tracking down those answers.” I looked at the bag with the papaya pills in them, still in shock from the news.\n\nThe supplements I took had saved my life.",

        "text": "I had always been intrigued by the abandoned mansion at the end of my street. The old, decrepit building stood as a reminder of a time long forgotten, and I often found myself staring at its windows, imagining what secrets lay hidden within.\n\nOne day, I decided to explore the mansion. I crept up the overgrown path, the rustling of leaves underfoot echoing in the eerie silence. As I pushed open the front door, a musty smell filled my nostrils, and I shuddered at the dampness that hung in the air.\n\nAs I stepped inside, a sense of foreboding washed over me. The once-grand entrance hall was now empty, except for a flickering candle that cast eerie shadows across the walls. I moved through the darkened rooms, my heart pounding in my chest, feeling as though I was being watched.\n\nSuddenly, I heard a creaking sound, like someone walking on the floorboards. I froze, listening intently as the footsteps grew louder and closer. I turned to flee, but something grabbed my ankle, sending me crashing to the ground.\n\nPetrified, I looked up to see a figure standing over me. It was a woman, dressed in a tattered wedding gown, her hair matted and tangled. She had a ghostly pallor, and her eyes glowed with an otherworldly light.\n\nShe spoke, her voice a whisper, and I shuddered at the sound. \"You shouldn't be here,\" she said, \"this is my home now.\"\n\nI tried to run, but my legs refused to obey me. The woman advanced, and I could feel her icy breath on my face. I closed my eyes, waiting for the end to come.\n\nWhen I opened them again, I was lying on the street outside the mansion, with no memory of how I got there. But I knew one thing for sure – I would never venture into that haunted house again.\n\n\nDays went by, and the memory of my encounter with the ghostly woman in the mansion began to fade. I tried to convince myself that it had just been a vivid nightmare, brought on by my overactive imagination.\n\nBut I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. Strange noises in the night, unexplained shadows darting across the room - I felt like I was being watched, no matter where I went.\n\nOne night, as I was getting ready for bed, I heard a soft whisper in my ear. It was a woman\n\nnetwork error\n's voice, the same one that had spoken to me in the mansion. \"Don't forget about me,\" she whispered, \"I'm still here.\"\n\nI spun around, but there was no one there. My heart was racing, and I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck standing up. I tried to convince myself that it was just my mind playing tricks on me, but deep down, I knew that something was terribly wrong.\n\nAs the days went on, the presence in my house grew stronger. Doors would slam shut on their own, objects would move without explanation, and I would wake up in the middle of the night to find the ghostly woman standing at the foot of my bed.\n\nI knew that I needed to do something before it was too late. I did some research and discovered that the mansion on my street had once belonged to a wealthy family. The wife had died tragically, and her ghost was said to haunt the property to this day.\n\nI decided to visit the mansion once more, armed with the knowledge I had gained. This time, I came prepared with a sage bundle and a rosary. As I entered the mansion, I could feel the woman's presence growing stronger, but I pushed through my fear and began to cleanse the house.\n\nAs I made my way through the rooms, I could feel the energy shifting. The air grew lighter, and the oppressive feeling that had plagued the house for so long began to lift.\n\nFinally, I made my way to the room where the woman's spirit was said to linger. I could feel her presence there, watching me. I spoke to her, telling her that it was time for her to move on, that she didn't belong in this world any longer.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, she was gone. The feeling of dread and oppression lifted, and I knew that the mansion was no longer haunted.\n\nAs I made my way back to my own house, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. I had faced my fears and conquered them. But I knew that I would never forget the ghostly woman who had haunted both my dreams and my reality, and I would always wonder what secrets had caused her to linger in the world of the living for so long.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/115dqxi/my_childhood_best_friend_was_a_maple_tree_my/",
        "text": "Have you ever recalled a memory differently from when you remembered it before?\n\n[This is a drawing made by 7 year old me](https://imgur.com/a/saMDRLl), taken from a childhood journal which my mom discovered buried in her so-called “memory box” – and let me tell you, this uncovered some deep and buried memories.\n\nThe drawing in question is of me and my best friend at the time. Yeah, I know, being friends with a tree is questionable and most would chalk it up to an imaginary friend, but reading the journal opened the floodgate to those locked-away memories. I remember that tree the same as I always did, but recently the memories of *what* we did together have started to change, somehow.\n\nI was always a quiet kid, preferring to keep to himself, while the other kids in the neighbourhood would be out playing and having a good time. It never really bothered me though, my toys and crayons were all I needed. I was bullied in school a little, but I never understood why I was bullied for the things I got bullied for. My fiery ginger hair, freckles… I just didn’t really get why the other kids saw those features in the way they did.\n\nWhile I had a few friends who I seldom met up with, my best friend by far was the maple tree in my backyard. We would chat, sometimes for hours, while I admired her vibrant red and orange, five-pronged leaves.\n\nI say ‘her’ because the voice that spoke to me from within the hole in its trunk was that of a young woman, though she never told me her name – maybe she was too hesitant to tell me, or perhaps she didn’t have one. I never really felt the need to know anyway, we shared a strong enough connection as it was. Still, I gave her a name of my own, Maple.\n\nI remember she would tell me the most beautiful stories my small mind could possibly imagine. They were entrancing, and I would just sit there and listen, all the infantile worries washing away.\n\nShe’d ask me how my day went, and I’d tell her.\n\nShe’d ask if I wanted to play a game, and I’d agree without hesitation.\n\nAnd when it started to get dark, and my parents would call me in for bedtime, I never wanted to leave her presence. She was a friend, mother and sister all in one.\n\nMy dad would frequently tell me how the tree was blessed, or minor variations of such. He told me that she was a Sugar Maple, not a Red Maple as he and my mother had thought when they first viewed the house; the fact that her strikingly coloured leaves never once fell, not during Fall, not during Winter, was a marvel in and of itself.\n\nShe was the most constant of constants in my childhood, and I wouldn’t have changed that for the world.\n\nBut sometimes, after she’d been telling me wondrous stories of love, happiness and adventure, she would tell me she didn’t have the energy to tell another, and would ask me to bring her something to eat.\n\n“Why?” I would always ask, “you’re a tree. Other trees don’t eat food!”\n\nIn response, she would say,\n\n“because I am not like the other trees. I am special, you know that. How do you think I’m able to have these leaves, all year round, so you can look at me out of your window on cold winter days, and sit in their shade on hot summer afternoons?”\n\nWho was I to question it. She was right, I was grateful for her constant presence, one of my three cornerstones along with my parents. So, without her telling me what to bring, I’d go and fetch fruit, honey, berries, birdseed, you name it, and feed it to her, into the hole in her trunk.\n\nI distinctly remember that after I fed her, she would tell the most beautiful stories of all. So beautiful that without fail, my cheeks would be wet with tears of happiness throughout. It’s too long ago to remember the stories in much detail, though. I wish I could have, at least, before those memories started to change.\n\nI never knew why, but the town grew a subdued resentment for me and my family over time. Kids at school would avoid me, and neighbours would shun any attempt from my parents to make conversation. It hurt me, deep inside, but Maple always had a way to make all of it just… go away.\n\nThat’s why when my parents told me we were moving house, I wailed and cried, tears of sorrow at the notion of never again being able to see my best friend in the whole wide world. I doubted the new owners would let me go and talk to the tree in their garden.\n\nEven then, she soothed my soul, saying “don’t worry Joey, we will see each other again. Don’t be sad because we’re parting, be happy because we met!” But, I could tell she felt the same way, to some extent, her voice tinged with lament.\n\nI moved on after a while. I never forgot about her, but I learned to live in her stead.\n\nBut, recently, after reviving those joyous memories, I noticed that they’d… started to change. Not in any significant way, not at first. I would think back to certain days I could still recall in sufficient detail, but each time would be slightly different.\n\nInstead of apples, I’d bring her red berries.\n\nInstead of honey, I’d bring her milk.\n\nIt’s such a bizarre feeling, recalling a memory that you know was different the last time you thought about it, over and over again.\n\nAfter some months, the changes had become much more significant. Sometimes I’d remember having a friend over, who’d sit with me while we listened to her tales, and other times I recall her talking to forest critters who climbed on her elegant branches and circled around her trunk in excitement.\n\nThe differences made me start to question my own mind, if I could even trust my memories at all… if the voice in the tree had even existed in the first place.\n\nThis feeling never really left me, and it reached a point where it interfered with my daily life, phasing out in the middle of conversations, forgetting grocery items and things I needed to do during the day.\n\nSo, I decided I would drive back to my childhood home in hopes to reconcile my memories, using the three day holiday I’d reserved from work. My beat-up Chevy was as reliable as always during the 8 hour drive to reunite with my long-lost friend – or to instead learn that it was indeed my imagination.\n\nMy hopes were dampened when I finally passed the town’s welcome sign, age made apparent by the partial covering of green stains and cracked paint. The place wasn’t abandoned, but it may as well have been. Many houses I passed appeared to be derelict, unused for years, birthing a sombre dread in my gut.\n\nThank the stars for satnav, I honestly don’t think I would’ve been able to find my old house with how unrecognisable the town had become. But I made it without a wrong turn, and immediately recognised my street halfway through turning onto it.\n\nThe sight of my abandoned childhood home stirred an emotion in me I didn’t know existed. Rotten woodwork framed its features, and its dirtied window panels gave me the impression of a dead body, eyes glazed over. No longer could I see into the heart of what I once knew, standing in front of this overgrown grave of memories passed.\n\nThe door was locked tight, as was the side-door to the garden. This dilemma was easily solved by a bit of strained climbing, though. I walked down the house-side alley with morbid anticipation of what I would see when I emerged into the yard.\n\nAlready I could see the terrible state of it, brambles and nettles exploding from the earth and swallowing up those plants unfortunate enough to be in their way.\n\nI came round the corner and was temporarily relieved upon not seeing the withered husk I’d expected. The tree was still alive, but it looked tired, old… starved. The sight of its frail branches and its beige and yellow leaves tainted those childhood memories with a bitter sorrow.\n\nYet, despite its wizened state, I couldn’t help but still admire its beauty.\n\nI worked my way around the hostile thorns and spiteful nettles, and was surprised to emerge into a relatively clear area around the maple. I took out my phone and snapped a picture of it in its entirety, then put it away and made my way over.\n\nTo my disappointment, nothing I did helped me to correct my ever-changing memories. I stared up at the leaves, felt the bark, smelled the aura… nothing. Nothing could bring my mind to settle on what really happened.\n\nFinding myself standing at its front, I was about to speak in hopes it would have some effect, but before a syllable could escape my lips, something shot out of the gaping hole and wrapped around my body.\n\nI lost balance and fell hard on my back, before I felt the grass beneath start to slide away from me, and I was dragged up and into the tree. I was yanked violently into the hollow, and my forehead smacked the upper rim with such force that I immediately felt warm blood trickle down my face.\n\nWeightlessness was my existence for a fleeting period, until my fall was broken by a hard, bumpy surface. The impact winded me, and pain flared up in my lower back.\n\nI lay there for a moment, struggling to regain control of my lungs and gritting my teeth from the zaps of pain rattling my spine. I was definitely confused from the head trauma, but I wasn’t hallucinating. Above me was a dome composed of gnarled roots with a small hole at its very top, where light leaked through and provided a dim illumination.\n\nI pushed myself up once, then dropped back down, my body still recovering. My second attempt was a success though, and I scrambled to find my phone. Luckily, it was still in my pocket, but the screen had splintered apart in one corner so that the electronics were exposed.\n\nI fumbled with it clumsily until I opened the toolbar and found the flashlight. I switched it on, and looked up at my surroundings.\n\nI almost dropped the phone and cracked it even further when a dry skull stared back at me, nestled on top of a heap of bones. I stumbled backward, only to land ass-first in yet another totem of remains.\n\nI couldn’t move. Utterly paralysed in the most mind-numbing fear I had ever experienced. The skull that gazed vacantly down at me was a human skull. A small, mottled, human skull.\n\nIt goes without saying I purged my stomach after absorbing the situation. I looked around frantically, for something that could help me get out of this hellhole, but all I saw were twisted roots, coiling and intertwining up the dome-shaped chamber. I’d say it was about 30 feet at least, and considering how the walls arched inward, there was no way I could climb up and into the opening at the top, especially in my current state.\n\nThe sound of something sliding jolted me out of my investigation and I froze up. It took some time to determine which direction the noise came from, but it was quick to once again make its presence known. I turned around to find myself staring into one of a few dark tunnels which grew away from the base of the chamber, like great, hollow roots.\n\nI heard it again, closer, followed by a soft thump, like something had come to rest.\n\n“J- Jo… ey?”\n\nMy eyes widened in terrified recognition.\n\nUnmistakeable. It was her.\n\nMy childhood friend, my muse, my cross-species sister. She was real.\n\nBut she sounded weak. Frail, like the shaky voice of an elderly woman, yet still sounding young at the same time. She spoke again.\n\n“I- I’m sorry… I thought you were someone here to hurt me. I never thought you’d come back.”\n\nHer voice broke with those last words, a sadness that begot joy. Still, I remained silent, completely overwhelmed with emotions. Stuttered consonants and vowels came out of my mouth as I struggled for the words to address her.\n\n“You- I- I didn’t know if you were real. I, uh… I’m sorry. My memory’s been cloudy lately.”\n\n“That’s okay Joey. I’m just glad you’re here, I’m- I’m so happy to see you!”\n\nI paused for a moment, reminding myself of the fact I had fallen into a literal boneyard. Clarity struck me and I realised the small opening above must have led to the hollow tree trunk. My emotions were ping-ponging between abject horror and deep-rooted comfort.\n\n“Me too, yeah, I… what are all- all these bones, Maple?”\n\n“Don’t worry about them, Joey. They are all my friends. What matters now is that we are together once more, and no one will ever bring us apart, never, ever again!”\n\nI inhaled sharply at that, and held that breath for longer than necessary.\n\n“Maple, wh- what do you mean? You’re gonna help me leave, right?”\n\nSilence entailed my question. A long and thoughtful silence. I wasn’t even sure if she was there anymore, until her shuddered breaths pierced through the darkness, and she said,\n\n“I don’t know how to do that. I’m sorry.”\n\nThat cold feeling of adrenaline travelled from my scalp to my toes in that moment. Maple had essentially sealed my fate, because of a simple mistake. All because I couldn’t speak fast enough above the ground.\n\nI didn’t reply, so I just sat there instead, trying to acclimatise myself to the countless remains who I shared the room with, smelling like the remnants of old, dusty death; how I imagined a centuries-old tomb would smell when it is inevitably reopened.\n\nMaple shared my feeling and held her tongue as well.\n\nFor what must have been a day, I didn’t speak once. The memories continued to crumble, revealing the truth underneath. Maple never asked me to bring the foods I remember bringing her, no, she only asked that I invited friends over, so she could spread her stories of wisdom and wonder. But… I still couldn’t envision the whole truth. That was yet to come.\n\nAfter another day or two, I’m not really sure since my phone had long since died, the groaning of my stomach grew loud enough to make me jump. Maple must have heard too, because, wordlessly, a thin, twig-like structure emerged from between the roots and moved closer to me.\n\nAt first, I twisted my head away, not trusting this wooden snake in front of me. But it stopped, and remained motionless, waiting for me to do something.\n\n“Drink, Joey.”\n\nAnd so I did. What other choice did I have? I could’ve tried eating the fibrous bark, but I had a feeling that wouldn’t sit so well with Maple. I brought my lips to the straw-like twig and began to suckle.\n\nThe taste… god, I’d have rather gnawed off the dried remains of skin and flesh left on the bones down there, but each and every one was stripped perfectly clean. It tasted bitter, and it stuck to the roof of my mouth and the back of my throat. A revolting cocktail that tasted like turpentine, with a strong coppery flavour mixed in.\n\n“Don’t you worry, little Joey. I’ll take care of you as long as I live.”\n\nShe never told me any more stories. Perhaps she simply didn’t have the energy, given that she was sharing some vital part of her with me, so that I wouldn’t starve or die of dehydration.\n\nWhen it came time to relieve myself, I wasn’t really sure what to do. I mean, I was *inside* Maple, so I didn’t really feel comfortable at first. She didn’t seem to mind when I took a piss though, seeing how quickly the liquid got absorbed by the roots.\n\nThe only thing she asked was that if I needed a crap, to do it at the mouth of one of the root tunnels. I complied, but was a little shocked to see an appendage whip out from the darkness and steal away the steaming hot pile, followed by a disgusting squishing sound. That’s how it went every time, so I got used to it after a while. She was too fast for me to make out many details, but the only way I can describe the things that sprung out of the darkness is like the dry and torn shed skin of a snake.\n\nOther than the bone-cairns and roots, there wasn’t much else to look at. There were some boulder-sized rocks that emerged slightly from underneath the floor, and some other smaller loose stones, but that was about it.\n\nAfter steeling myself, I explored the oversized stacks of remains, seeing if I could find anything else other than dry, hollow bones. There were some scraps of old clothing, unsurprisingly, and a couple of old possessions which had certainly not withstood the test of time, including a worn leather satchel, fragments of oxidised jewellery and what appeared to be a weathered pamphlet, the words and pictures of which had long since faded.\n\nFeeling disheartened at the lack of, well, anything useful whatsoever, I saw a small, tube-like object glint from somewhere underneath tangled femurs and ribs. I reached in with a grimace and pulled it out, to see it was an old ballpoint pen. One that looked fancy but was probably cheap.\n\nThat wasn’t what drew me in about this pen, though. There was a paper sticker wrapped around it, on which was written in nigh-indiscernible ink:\n\n*Jamie Kilpe*\n\nSome letters were gone, but I remembered that name well enough to understand… Jamie was one of my few real friends back then, helping me with homework when I couldn’t understand the questions, among other things.\n\nI didn’t bother thinking it over, I knew as soon as I saw that name. I knew that somewhere, under these cursed piles, laid my friend. Missing and despaired over, then forgotten. The whole time, he was under the grass of my yard, right beneath where Maple and I talked with such joy and compassion.\n\nAnd with the physical discovery, came the cognitive. It came back to me so clearly, it was as if that was how I’d always remembered it. Visions of Jamie’s little body, hoisted up into the air, bones being stripped of flesh and blood by countless branch-like appendages. Marrow, scraped out from the insides of his bones, all while he was alive. Not even a droplet remained when Maple was finished, every last one sucked up into those little straws.\n\nFear evolved into horrified anger, and I shouted,\n\n“What the FUCK Maple? You’re a fucking MONSTER! How could you do those things!?! What did you do to my memory??”\n\nShe took a moment to respond, and said,\n\n“Joey! No curse words please! That wasn’t very nice.”\n\n“YOU ATE MY FRIEND YOU-”\n\n“Please, listen, I must do these things so I can live. They become a part of me. In this way, they never truly die, because I will always remember them and cherish what they gave to me.”\n\nI already felt the churning in my stomach as she said that, and yet again a steaming jet of vomit erupted from my throat. That’s why it had tasted coppery, masked by the bitter sap.\n\n“Y- you, no, hah, you… you made me eat what’s left of all these people?”\n\n“As well as my own blood, yes. I have nothing else to give you, Joey. Please understand I am no evil being. To feed you is to weaken myself, and shorten my life.”\n\nI didn’t bother to reply, and simply collapsed in a shaky mess of snot and tears. Disgust, hatred, utter misery.\n\nAll my life consisted of now, would be drinking a vile mixture of blood, flesh and sap, fuelling a miserable existence motivated purely by that loathsome survival instinct.\n\nI rarely spoke with Maple after that, though she sometimes made attempts. I couldn’t bear to even think about her. Without anything else to do, I took up doing the only thing I could to keep myself from going completely insane: carving.\n\nI used a small rock to smash and splinter the old bones on top of a boulder in the floor, then scraped them against the stone to sand and sharpen them. I never really thought I had the hand or eye for craftmanship, but with nothing else to do, I compulsively carved, shaped and built various different tools and objects.\n\nI used fibrous, strand-like roots to bind them together, or to wrap around handles for an easier grip. I also used the sap fluid as glue, siphoning it into a broken cranium and allowing it to evaporate and become thicker and stickier.\n\nI turned a rib into a rudimentary knife, winding the fibers around its handle and sharpening it on the boulder. I used a small animal bone and a canine from what seemed to be the skull of a domestic cat, scraping out a divet and using the sap to glue the tooth inside, to make a smaller, scalpel-like blade.\n\nWith these, I built sculptures.\n\nA pelvic bone turned into a butterfly, sporting finely carved patterns.\n\nFinger bones glued together as antlers, driven into the top of a skull, with teeth glued into its vacant eye sockets.\n\nYet another skull, that of a child with an enlarged cranium, binding together vertebrae and attaching them to its underside to birth an octopus.\n\nEven attempted scrimshaw to an extent, though with bone instead of ivory, polishing shoulder blades with rags that were once clothes and pushing the sap into the fine etchings, scraping any away that dried on the surface. I’d carve my memories, in hopes it would prevent me losing them as the days, weeks, and months went by.\n\nAs time passed, Maple seemed less and less able to just keep quiet, and her kind, loving demeanour faded too. Her voice, from the dark, would say things like,\n\n“Why did you have to leave me, Joseph? Did you want me to wither away?”\n\nor,\n\n“I’m hungry… so, so hungry... it hurts.”\n\nAll the while her voice coming closer, louder, deeper.\n\nI was so scared. The one who I’d thought to be inseparable from as a kid had morphed into a depraved monster who couldn’t or wouldn’t even acknowledge the things they’d done.\n\nThat is until one day, after likely months, maybe a year – time turned to a fluid in that place – I heard the most peculiar sounds. Something other than the coarse scraping of bone on rock, or Maple’s sickly, wasting voice. It came from somewhere above me, loud crashes and thuds, rumbling and crunching.\n\nI had no idea what was going on, but simply hearing something else brought a hope I never thought was again possible. My senses heightened and adrenaline pumped through my muscles.\n\nMaybe Maple could sense this, I don’t know, but she started sobbing then. Pained, subdued cries and hics which occasionally gave way to less-than-human noises.\n\n“I love you Joey. Please don’t leave, please, please, I don’t want to die here all alone, please Joey…”\n\nStill, I ignored her and set my ears to maximum awareness. There was definitely something going on above, but I couldn’t make out anything distinct.\n\nAnd then, I heard a whirring, no, buzzing, much louder than the rest. I smelled something vaguely crude and oily, before the sound suddenly grew much louder, and clouds of sawdust poured down onto my head.\n\nAt the same time, I heard Maple – no, I wouldn’t have referred to her as that anymore, because the most unholy shriek echoed throughout the dark tunnels around me, screams of anguished pain and desperate pleas. Even in imitation, a human voice box couldn’t produce those sounds.\n\nThe voice made me realise what I had to do, and I shouted at the top of my lungs,\n\n“HELP! HELP ME! I’M DOWN HERE, FUCK, PLEASE HELP ME!!”\n\nLight poured in from the top of the chamber as a loud splintering vibrated throughout the roots, followed by a booming thud from above. The voice spat, screamed and howled unrelentingly, as I stared up through the hole above. Sawdust coated my eyeballs, but I didn’t care, because peering down at me from above were the helmeted heads of two men.\n\n“Holy shi- don’t worry son, we’re gonna get you out of there! Mack, go get a rope. Yeah, a rope! GO!”\n\nMack was quick to return, and they dropped the length of rope down into the chamber. No hesitation, I wrapped my fingers tightly around it, and they began to hoist me up. It was then that the voice, barely maintaining the last resemblance of Maple, cried its last words.\n\n“Y- you’re leaving me again? Why? I thought you loved me, I thought you cared, no, no, please, don’t leave me all alone! Not again!”\n\nHalfway up, a twisted root shot out from the wall nearest me and coiled tightly around my right leg. I pulled desperately but it wouldn’t budge. I kept yanking, it felt like my hip would dislocate but I kept going.\n\nMy movements revealed to me that something was moving around in my pocket. My hand shot in and pulled out… my bone knife. Oh, my bone knife. With animalistic ferocity I slashed and sawed away at my wooden constrictor. My muscles burned, but I didn’t care.\n\nWith a roar I severed the root entirely, and it flopped back down into the pit below. I felt myself rising, up and up, like I was finally going to heaven, and the blinding light that greeted me almost made me think as such.\n\nOn my way out, I witnessed the chamber shrivel and rot away, dirt pouring in and filling the chamber like a tipped hourglass. The appendages of that awful thing finally started to reveal themselves, shedding the cloak of dark, but I didn’t want to know. I never want to know. All I saw was shredded, translucent skin, and organic, jutting spikes, leaking an orange fluid from where they sprung.\n\nMy retinas burned, and it took a good minute or two for them to adjust and allow me to see anything other than dazzling whiteness. I made out vague silhouettes above, crowding around me, and the only other thing I can recall are the words, “burn it, burn it, burn it”, unaware they were my own. Then, as the adrenaline lost its course, I blacked out from near total exhaustion.\n\nAfter what I later came to learn was a full 24 hours, my crusty eyelids slowly parted and the sleep fell away as dust. My mom was sitting in an armchair next to my hospital bed, and exploded in tears of relief and happiness when she saw me awake. My dad was on a business trip but I was told he had dropped everything to fly back and see me.\n\nApparently, I had been missing for 11 months, and since I hadn’t told anyone of my plans to revisit my childhood home, there wasn’t much of anything for the police to go on. I’d only been found because the neighbourhood was commissioned to be torn down to make way for a new development, which the dying sugar maple would have obstructed.\n\nI was interviewed, and I told the truth for the most part, but I never told them about Maple, or the true nature of that tree. I said they’d find the skeletal remains of dozens of people and animals buried under the garden, but they didn’t end up finding anything at all. The only evidence would have been my bone knife, which I had dropped on my way out.\n\nComing up empty-handed, they brushed off my insistence as psychosis or delirium as a result of being trapped down there, isolated for so long. Maybe the bones are still there, just buried too deep. Or, maybe… no, I don’t want to consider that. She’s gone. I watched her die.\n\nBut, just in case, if you ever come to learn of a red-leafed tree which never loses a single leaf – stay well away from it. Cut it down and burn it, regardless of property laws.\n\nAnd don’t ever allow yourself to be befriended by it.",

After meeting the [priest](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/yy23d5/i_have_a_friend_who_goes_grave_robbing_and_he/), I had to keep driving.\n\nFor fuck's sake, I was going to crash. I just knew it. I was being followed, not by a car, not by a person, heck, I was even alone in the car, I was being fucking followed by a presence, Death itself shall I say, fucking shit, all I could think was fear, fear, *fear.* The horizon was darkening and the street lights turned on. And this terror had taken over me. I would run out of gas and the thing would fucking get me.\n\nAhead of me, trees. Behind me, trees... The road was long and wide. Where was I going?\n\nSuddenly, I hit the brakes. Something was blocking the road. *Oh, shit.*\n\nIt was close to midnight and I knew it couldn't be good.\n\nThe night was dark, but not dark enough to conceal. The silhouette again. It stood up, and walked closer, in a nightmarish, ritualic dance. It was a ghastly figure: hollow eyes, long arms and legs, unnatural and, yet, it was comical. It was trying to walk like a human. The creature was, though, horrifying: it looked like a bunch of shadows and skin thrown together. It 'walked' to my window and stared at me. This is how death looks like, I told myself. It's going to take me.\n\nThen, it left. It walked back into the woods.\n\nI thought I had died of fear, but apparently I hadn't. Sweat was dripping down my face, mixed with tears.\n\nI took my phone and searched through my contacts frantically. My hands were trembling so hard, I accidentally called my aunt. *Shit.* I hung out quickly and kept searching.\n\n*Jade S.*\n\n*Jean from comms*\n\n*Jem*\n\n*Jenna.* That's it. It rang for a while, before she picked up.\n\n'Dan?'\n\n'Yeah, hi! Um, I'm sorry.'\n\n'What's wrong?'\n\n'I need your help. Do you happen to still talk to that guy you knew, the rituals antique kinda guy? You know, the one with the weird voodoo tables and shit?'\n\nA short pause. 'What?'\n\n*For fuck's sake.* 'That Kevin guy. Come on.'\n\n'Kelvin, yeah, um, why? What could you possibly need from him? Are you suddenly into all that, or what?' she laughed.\n\n'Nah, I just need to talk to him. There's this creepy guy at work who won't leave me alone because I promised to help him find some antique seller. I don't know.'\n\n'Oh, okay. Yeah, I can give you his number tomorrow.'\n\n'Can't you do it now?'\n\n'All right. The guy must be really stalking you.'\n\n*You have no idea.*\n\nI called the Kelvin guy immediately. He didn't pick up. It was way over 1AM. Called him until he answered.\n\n'Who is this?'\n\n'Hi, is this Kelvin? The ritual antique guy?'\n\n'Literally no one calls me that. Why?'\n\n'I *really* need to talk to you.'\n\nPause. 'Okay, are you gonna sell me something?'\n\n'I actually need your dark ass knowledge.'\n\n'What? You want me to do what, dude? Are you drunk?'\n\n'Listen, you need to help me. My friend sells souls and he fucked with the wrong thing and now some shit is chasing me and I think it's death. I have kids, man. I ain't dealing with all that.'\n\n'Yeah, you're drunk. I don't know who gave you this number-'\n\n'I know about the processes. Rupture, Wandering, I know all that. Please.'\n\nI heard a long sigh. 'Fine. We can meet tomorrow, if you really want to. I'll text you.'\n\nThe next day, here I was, in this crusty diner, waiting to meet this Kelvin. He walked in and I suddenly realized why he chose such a career: the guy looked like a loser.\n\nI explained everything to him. He stood silent for a while, then spoke.\n\n'I know people like Theo. He thinks that just because he knows how to read a ritual book he can tame a demon. Demons aren't like us. They aren't fair. There are no terms and conditions to a transaction that is happening outside our sphere. Our world. He probably already sold his soul and he doesn't know it. The poor guy is gonna end up killing a bunch of people and then himself in a few years, because that's when the possession fully unveils. And what did he even get, because of this? Some money? A nice girl? Not worth it.'\n\n'What was the thing that was following me?'\n\nHe narrowed his eyes. 'Um, that could've been Theo in his demon form. Probably. He said he wanted you to be his anchor? That's code for *I'm gonna try to use you in another ritual to regain my humanity, but I'm gonna kill you and probably the both of us will be doomed.*'\n\nWell, that didn't sound good.\n\n'So, what do I do? He won't leave me alone. I thought that was death.'\n\n'Bullshit. Death follows people who died and can't go. Death is pretty harmless if it gets to do its job in peace.'\n\n'What do I *do,* man?'\n\n'You need to kill him before the demon takes over.'\n\nKill my friend?\n\n'I am not a murderer.'\n\n'Either that or have your family and yourself die by his hands. You pick.'\n\nThis was crazy. 'Fuck. How do I... how do I even do this?'\n\nKelvin, then, took out a book from his bag and talked me through one of the craziest things I had ever heard. Not only did I have to kill him, I also had to perform this ritual to make sure the demon wouldn't enter me. I needed salt, wax, matches, rope, and a knife.\n\n'Listen. Kill him however you want. Poison him, for all I care. Just make sure he dies. Then, take the wax and melt it in his palm and left ear. Tie him to a stable thing, a tree. Circle him with salt. Read from this, and then cut the rope and bury your friend. Nothing will happen to you. Shit like this happens all the time, believe me.'\n\nI'm not gonna lie, Kelvin didn't look impressed by the story. How often do people play with this stuff?\n\nThat night, I had sent my wife and kids away and returned to the house. I called Theo and told him I'd help him. My heart was heavy, but I was going to do what needed to be done.\n\nHe arrived just like in the first night he had visited me. 'I'm so glad you can help me. You are a real friend.'\n\n'Anything for you.' I said. Fucking demon, I thought, I won't let you take my life and soul.\n\n'Let me make you some tea.'\n\nTheo accepted. He sat down at the kitchen table, in silence. As I was boiling the water, I saw the creature's reflection in the window. It stood behind him, still. I had to be brave.\n\nI then poured a cup. Enough poison to kill a horse. Gave it to him.\n\nTheo smiled, but his eyes were hollow.\n\nThen he drank it.\n\nThat's it. I had killed my friend.\n\nI went to the living room, leaving him in the kitchen. He would soon start to choke, go through all those stupid stages that I didn't wanna see. I would soon hear him scream.\n\nNothing. Minutes passed. I waited twenty fucking minutes. Then I heard footsteps and turned.\n\nI froze. Theo was standing in the doorway, like a lost, fragile boy. His lips were trembling and his eyes were wide. He held his horrified stare at me. He was alive.\n\n'What happened, Dan? Aren't you going to help me?'\n\n'Did you like your tea?' I asked, trembling. *What the fuck?*\n\nTheo smiled. 'Yeah...? A bit tasteless. Did you... put something in it?'\n\nI didn't fucking understand. I took his hand and felt his pulse, and that's when it hit me.\n\n*Nothing.*\n\nYou can't kill something that's already dead.\n\nThe glassy eyes, peculiar way of acting, pale face... The creature had been, in fact, Death, following Theo. Suddenly, it all made sense.\n\n'What did you say uh, you felt that night? The third being?'\n\n'I told you, Dan. Still and old. Not a soul, not a demon.'\n\n'Could that be death?'\n\nHe paused. He looked lost. 'You think Death came for my work?'\n\n'Theo, Death didn't come for them. You are a good merchant. A... good... *businessman.*'\n\nI could not believe it. Suddenly, it made sense.\n\n'Theo, you died.'\n\nI watched as my friend opened his mouth to speak, then closed it. He frowned. 'No. You're lying. I can't be.'\n\n'How'd you get here?'\n\n'I *drove* here.'\n\n'Which car did you take?'\n\nAll he did was stare, disoriented. He scratched his head, took a few steps back. 'I don't understand. You're fucking with me.'\n\n'When you felt the presence, did you finish the transaction?'\n\n'No, I, uh. I don't think so. I couldn't.'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'I don't *fucking* know, Dan! Something intervened!'\n\n'You lost your physical fucking form. You were no longer tied to your body, because you fucked with some voodoo shit too powerful for you and you died on the spot. The presence you felt was Death, wanting to take you. However, due to some stupid magic or because of whoever demon took you under its care, 'cause of the souls you sold it, you managed to remain here. You are being kept alive by this demon because it needs you here. And after it's done with you, it's probably gonna take your soul too.'\n\nHis eyes were full of tears. 'Nah, man, you're wrong. See, I did some good, *good,'* he spit out the words, '*research.* I am GOOD at what I do. I can't die. I'm not possessed by anything.'\n\n'Didn't you say yourself that you feel weird? You're fucking dead.'\n\nHe frowned again. 'You're crazy.'\n\nI felt about to scream. The clock was ticking. 'You are dead.'\n\n'Fucking *prove* it!' he cried.\n\n'*YOU are dead, because I fucking poisoned the tea, and you didn't die, which means you were already GONE!\"*\n\nTheodore stared at me. Confusion washed over his face, them anger. Betrayal. His lip trembled. Hands shaking. 'You tried to kill me?'\n\n'I did. And look where that got me. You need to go. Accept it. You died.'\n\n'Fuck no.'\n\n'Yeah? Well, tell that to the thing that has been standing behind you for the past 10 minutes.'\n\nI had never seen someone so still, so afraid. He slowly turned around and faced the creature that had been terrorizing me. He didn't even scream.\n\nHe understood. Suddenly, I thought I sensed something else in his look. Was it relief?\n\n'So I'll leave.'\n\n'Yeah. I'm sorry.'\n\n'What will happen to my soul?'\n\nProbably already owned by a demon, I thought. That's what you get for playing with shit you don't understand. 'You'll be fine.'\n\n'You think?'\n\n'Yeah.'\n\n'Okay. Dan?'\n\n'Yeah?'\n\n'I need you to get the fuck away from here.'\n\nWhat?\n\n'Why?'\n\nTheo sighed. 'I'm gonna let myself go, but it's gonna be ugly. If whatever demon wants to take me, you need to run.'\n\nI could barely speak, so I whispered. 'Okay.'\n\n'They're gonna fight over me. I worked with plenty of them. I don't know when I'm gonna be at peace, *if* I will. But get out. Don't come back to this house, ever. Don't sell it. I cursed it.'\n\nI took a few steps back, to the front door.\n\n'Thanks, Dan.'\n\n'For what?'\n\n'For being my anchor. I needed you to help me understand.'\n\n'You're welcome.'\n\nAnd that's when I closed the door behind me and ran. Ran as fast as I could. I haven't seen Theodore since. I haven't returned to my former house.\n\nIt's been years. Nothing peculiar has followed. I'm good.\n\nI still can't watch any horror movies because of that. I managed to get out mostly because of luck.\n\nPlease, if your grave robber friend knocks on your door late at night, don't answer. It's no good.",

        "text": "A little backstory,\nMe and my friends belive in a lot of folklore creatures. Skinwalkers, Bigfoot, Etc.\nWe decided to go hunting for some creatures, and that's where it all starts.\n\n•February 18. 2018\n\nThe five of us went out to the woods looking for any kind of weird creatures. We were prepared for basically anything. We had shotguns, 9mm pistols, one of us even had night vision goggles. It was around 11pm when we began the hunt. At first it went as you'd expect it. Talking, making jokes, drinking some coke. We didn't expect anything to happen, but after around 2 hours of looking, we heard a kind of noise. Not a noise that you'd tipically hear in the woods. It was like a scream, a non-human scream. It came from far away, but you could hear it like it came from right next to you. We all shivered and shit our pants. Mike (my best friend) asked \"Are we sure about this shit? Cuz im kinda starting to shit my pants.\" Aaron (another friend of mine) sayed \"Yeah I'm kinda scared too.\" But we decide to ignore that and continue. I wish we hadn't. Four of us went first while are other friend, Josh stayed back. After a while we noticed that Josh was missing. We looked for him everywhere, but we had no luck. We called the police and the next day, the \"Forever Lasting Search\" begun.\n\n\n•February 19. 2018.\n\nThe search began, but nothing. We thought he was found when someone blew their whistle. We ran there as fast as we could. They found a shirt, a sock and a shotgun. We knew they belonged to Josh. He had the exact same clothes and shotgun that layed there. We feared the worst. But after 3 months of searching. Nothing was found.\n\n\n•May 12. 2018.\n\nThe four of us get a call from the police department. We thought that he has been found. All they told us on the phone was we need to get down to the police department. When we got there, we were greeted by the chief of the police department. He told us that Josh is probably dead by now and they have to call off the search. We were sad, but knew that they did the right thing. Did I say we? I meant my three friends. I couldn't accept that they just gave up on him. So I wanted to search for him by myself.\n\n\n•January 15. 2023.\n\nFor the past years, I've been saving up my money for equipment. I've bought a fully automatic rifle, a sniper rifle, night vision goggles, body armour, anything you can imagine. I went out to thoose same woods looking for Josh. After about 30 minutes of searching, I heard that same scream that i did 5 years ago. I went towards it. All of a sudden i saw a head pop out from behind a tree. I didn't even hesitate to shoot at it. At least one bullet must have hit it, because it let out a screamand ran away. That same scream. I was shocked but followed it and what i saw next shook me for life. I didn't have to follow it for long, only for 4-5 minutes. It walked jumped down from a tree while holding something. Then I realised. It was Josh. It was holding Josh. At least what remained of him. It threw him at me, and ran away. I took a look at Josh's body. He was covered in blood. But it was like he was saying something. Whispering. I couldn't quite understand at first but then I realised. He sayed \"Run.\" Next thing I know, that something screamed again. I ran away, but tripped on a rock and lost my concicusness.\n\n\n•The hospital room\n\n I woke up in a hospital room with my left leg missing. I heard a voice say \"Oh good, you're awake\". It was the doctor. He sayed screams were heard from the woods so they send police officers to check it out. They found me, missing a left leg. I looked at my body and saw scratches and bite marks all over me. I asked him what all that was about. He sayed he did not know. So here I am in a hospital room, writing, hoping that someone belives me. And as for Josh, they recovered his body too. At least his head. Nothing else was to be found. And it remains a mistery, that what was the thing that killed Josh and almost killed me.",

        "text": "Hey, everyone. It's been a while since I uploaded here.  For those of you wondering who I am, call me Zane. To give a brief rundown, I work as a research assistant to a man named Dean. We’re employed by a specific government branch that deals with the supernatural. Last time I talked about my first mission with him involving a town’s vampire problem which I’ll link [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/qjwp3f/im_a_research_assistant_with_some_stories_to_tell/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCertain events have been keeping me busy these past couple of years, namely, we’ve been investigating these odd videos. Now, we’re no strangers to these kinds of things. You’d be surprised how common cursed videos are, to varying degrees. Not every one of them is like The Ring. Some will just give you really shitty luck after you watch them which may result in your death if it’s bad enough.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, the tapes we’ve been studying aren’t actually cursed. At least, they aren’t in a direct sense. From what we’ve seen, though some contents of them are hazardous in certain circumstances. Of all places, they were discovered at my old foster home. A quick aside, the one I grew up in put heavy emphasis on education.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI actually excelled above the other kids I lived with. In fact, that’s why Dean decided to adopt me. It’s also how a lot of people end up working in our branch. In fact, we have a lot of people working for those institutions in order to find new recruits. I can’t say I approve, but someone has to deal with all the weird stuff. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean there are independent paranormal investigators. A few I’m friends with and they’ve even helped us on occasion. I can see the appeal of being one sometimes. However, I prefer the job stability our branch provides. Anyway, back to the tapes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of our recruiters working as a caretaker at my old foster home is friends with Dean. Her name is Stella and she told him the tapes arrived in an unmarked vanilla envelope with the only marking being that they were numbered. The odd thing is the house has a door camera and yet when the footage was reviewed nobody was shown placing the envelope on the mat. While someone could have simply tampered with the camera beforehand, the timestamp was never interrupted. This was the first indicator that the tapes are paranormal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt’s not unheard of for cursed objects to mysteriously appear to people. In such cases, we have a protocol. We have prisoners look at them. Again, I know that’s not exactly ethical, but we’d be losing people left and right to these kinds of things otherwise. Stella sent the tapes over to the sector Dean and I work at. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe prisoner who viewed them isn’t in any physical danger. Mental is another story since they weren’t as exposed to these kinds of things as we are. They’re in the psych ward and I sincerely hope they get better. Knowing we were dealing with a legit threat, we decided to watch the tapes ourselves. I’ll do my best to transcribe them beginning with the first one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\[The date shown at the beginning of the video is June 8th, 1986\\]**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDean and Stella believe the footage was most likely filmed on an 8mm camcorder due to the quality as well as the date. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The ones in the video are a family of four known as the Stantons. The names of each member are as follows, Harvey, the dad. Frances, the mother, Gwen, their daughter, and lastly, Randy, their son. Gwen seems to be in her early teens or at least a preteen while her brother is a few years younger. In addition to them, some extended family members and friends can be seen. Prior to any footage being shown, there is speaking.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Harvey:** “It’s on, but nothing is showing up on the tv. I think I hooked it up wrong.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Frances:** “Gwen!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “Yeah?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrances: “Can you come down and help your dad out? He’s having trouble.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Footsteps are audible as Gwen descends the stairs. The noise of tampering can be heard followed by the footage coming to life. Harvey smiles at the camera and then focuses it on his wife and daughter.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Harvey:** “You did it, Gwen. This’ll be perfect for tonight. Frances, when did Connie say she’d be dropping off Randy?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Frances:** “I think she said eight, but her and Nate are going to be helping us shop for presents. Gwen, we’ll need you to watch Randy and Jason while we’re out.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Gwen’s expression becomes confused.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “Wait. I was supposed to spend the night at Luella’s, remember?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Harvey:** “Shit, that’s right.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Frances:** “No cussing in front of the kids!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Harvey:** “Sorry.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “I can't watch them. Stacey and I have been planning this for months!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Frances:** “Well, renting this camera cost us a lot. You can see her next year.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “I wanted to see her tonight!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Frances:** “Don’t raise your voice at me!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*An argument ensues between the two. Eventually, Gwen is forced to comply. Her mother tells her to go wait in the car.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Frances:** “Have you been filming this the whole time?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Harvey:** “I forgot the camera was still on.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Frances:** “Turn it off.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The footage ceases. It resumes this time during Randy’s party. Gwen isn’t shown. At first, it was thought she was the one filming. However, after further review, she can be seen in the back.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*This is where things get odd. The birthday party goes as normal except for one part where the camera instead focuses on Gwen slipping away from the party. Based on her body language, she seemed upset. The camera refocuses on the party and then Happy Birthday is sung to Randy. He blows out his candles and begins tearing into his presents.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*It should be noted that during this the one holding the camera is never addressed or even acknowledged. That is except in one instance. The film stops again. When it cuts back, this time it shows Gwen crying in her room. There’s a noise similar to that of a cicada.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*She seems to hear it and looks in the direction of the camera, but not at it. The sound repeats except more loudly. The creaking of her door opening can be heard. The POV switches this time to her perspective. There is a wispy pink trail leading out of her room.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*She follows it and it leads downstairs.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI should mention it was at this point did I really start worrying. The stuff up until then was strange, sure. However, none of it made us feel as if there was a real sense of danger. The whole time I wished Gwen would ignore the trail and go back to her room. No such luck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*It ends in front of the living room TV. It turns itself on.  What’s shown on the screen makes her gasp. Describing it is difficult given the limited resolution of cameras back then. From what can be observed, its shape is similar to that of a cobra-shaped cloud and is a more vibrant pink color to the trail.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Its eyes stand out, being ruby red, and emit a light that is believed to cause hypnosis. This entity is capable of human speech. However, it seems only able to do so through electronics and possibly reflective surfaces. The evidence for this is that it communicates through the speakers of whatever device it’s currently operating through. For example, it spoke to Gwen and its voice was the same as tv static.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Entity**: “Don’t be afraid, child.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “Who?... What?...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Entity:** “I have many names. You may call me Ludus.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “What are you?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “It’s not what I am, child. It’s what I can offer.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “No, this can’t be real.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a moment, we thought she would turn away. We wanted her to. I got this urge to scream at her not to trust that thing. I knew there would be no point, though It would’ve done as much good as yelling at a character in a horror movie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “I can bring her back.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Gwen Stops.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “What are you talking about?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “You miss her, don’t you?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “How do you know about that?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “I know a lot. You two were close, weren’t you?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ludus vanishes from the screen and pink light bursts from it. The setting changes again. This time it appears to be a kindergarten classroom based on the layout. Pink and red hearts cover the walls, indicating that this took place during Valentine’s day. The board has the name Mrs. Preston on it and the teacher herself is seated at her desk in front of it.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Accompanying the heart decorations are cutouts of pterodactyls.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, we realized we were viewing a memory of Gwen’s.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Mrs. Preston gets up and walks in front of the class.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Mrs. Preston:** “Happy Valentine’s day, everyone. We have a lot to do today, but before we begin I have a little surprise for you. We have a new student.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*She calls out in the direction of her door.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Mrs. Preston:** “You can come in now!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*A girl enters the room. Shyly, she glances around at her new classmates.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Mrs. Preston**: “I know you’re nervous, but we’re all friends here. Why don’t you introduce yourself?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Girl**: “Um…My name is Luella .”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Mrs. Preston:** “Good, now what do you say to Luella, class?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Class In Unison**: “It’s nice to meet you, Luella!”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Mrs. Preston:** “Very nice, everyone. Now, Luella, why don’t you go have a seat and get to know everyone? We’re doing crafts today.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The pov follows Luella walking, revealing a table where the students are all seated. Each person has a sticker of their name in front of them. Directly in front of the pov is the name Gwen. The seat across from it is empty. Luella sits in it.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Mrs. Preston begins passing out construction paper, safety scissors, glitter, glue, and crayons.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Mrs. Preston:** “What we’re going to do is make Valentine’s cards.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*She instructs the class to draw hearts on the constitution paper in front of them. Gwen’s focus shifts to Luella who seems to be struggling.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “Do you need some help?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Luella stares at her.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGwen: “Mrs. Preston says I’m a really good artist. I can help you if you want.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Stacey remains silent but hands her the construction paper she was drawing on. The heart illustrated on it is green.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “Is this your favorite color?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Luella nods.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “Mine too! What else do you like?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Luella responds this time.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “Animals.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “LIke cats and dogs?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “Yeah, and birds and hamsters.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “I do too! Let’s put them on our cards.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Gwen proceeds to fold her construction paper in half in order to create a card, She then doodles stick figure versions of various. Luella observes her and does the same,  In the background, Mrs. Preston can be heard checking on the other students. Eventually, she gets to Gwen and Luella.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Mrs. Preston:** “How are things coming along? Are you doing good, Luella ?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “Good, Gwen has been helping me.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Mrs, Preston turns her attention to Gwen.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Mrs. Preston:** “That’s sweet of you, Gwen. Thank you so much for helping her feel welcome.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Gwen looks at Mrs. Preston.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “You’re welcome. I like her.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Mrs. Preston:** “That makes me happy to hear.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Mrs, Preston calls fir everyone’s attention.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Mrs, Preston:** “Since everyone is nearly done, I have a surprise.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Mrs. Preston goes to her desk and gets a bowl of candy from it. The class gets excited.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Mrs. Preston:** “Alright, settle down now. Remember to mind your manners. Now, I want you all to think of something nice to write down. It could be about one person or even the entire class. Then after you’ve written it down I want you to give the card you made to someone, but the person who gets it can’t open it until I say so.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Gwen turns back to Luella. The message she writes on her card is “Wanna play with me after school?”.  She closes her card and Luella does the same. They exchange. Mrs. Preston passes out candy to her students and then permits them to open their cards.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Written in the card Gwen received from Luella is the word “yes”. She glances at her and for the first time in their conversation, she smiles. The footage jumps forward in time. Based on the change in their heights the estimated time passed is somewhere between five and six years. Where they are is inside a house.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “Where’s your mom and dad?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLuella: “Out.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “Again? Weren’t they out  Friday?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “They work a lot. They deserve to have fun.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “It just seems like they’re gone a lot.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella frowns.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “Can we not talk about this right now?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “Okay, so you said over the phone you wanted to show me something?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Luella smiles nervously and tells Gwen to follow her. They go up to her room.  They get to her bed. Then Luella turns to Gwen.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “Before I show you this, can I ask you something?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “Sure, you can ask me anything.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “We’ve known each other for a while so what do you think of me?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “What do I think of you? I mean you know I like you.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** ”I know, but…Do you…like me?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “Oh…I never thought you’d feel the same way.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Luella tears up and smiles. Gwen takes her hands in hers and they kiss.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I can certainly appreciate a tender moment, all I could feel while we watched this play ot was dread because we knew there could only be one reason this was shown. Watching a character you admire die is one thing. When it’s someone real it’s that much worse. I can only hope that somehow if we can stop Ludus that’ll bring peace to its victims.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Luella pulls away, blushing. Gwen clears her throat.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “So uh what exactly did you want to show me?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “Oh, right, hold on.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Luella bends down and reaches under her bed, pulling out some artwork. It’s of her and Gwen standing in a field of roses while facing each other and smiling. The star-filled night sky is accompanied by a meteor shower. A heart is drawn on the moon.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “Luella, this is so…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “I know, corny, right?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “No, I think it’s amazing. How long did this take?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “I”m happy you think so. I worked on it off and on this past week. I didn’t want anyone to see it because well, you know.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “Yeah, I don’t get why people are so judgemental. Would you mind if I took it home?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Luella grins.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “That’s why I made it.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Gwen takes the drawing and places it in her backpack. The footage jumps forward in time, showing the pair doing nearly everything together. In every class they share, they are sitting right next to each other. Sometimes they get in trouble for talking while the teacher is.  They always have matching outfits.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Their favorites are green shirts usually with some kind of design on the front. It stops, showing them in the woods this time and sitting under a tree.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “I don’t think anyone will be bothering us here. Did you bring it?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The view pans down to Gwen’s backpack. As she goes to unzip it, a bandage is visible around her right hand. Concerned, Luella notices this and grabs it to take a closer inspection.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Luella:* “What happened to you?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Gwen doesn’t answer. Luella studies her face.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “It was Byron again. Wasn’t it?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “He grabbed me on my way home, but I managed to get a good hit on him and escape.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “But your hand.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “It’s fine. At least I managed to get some payback. He’s a lot more thick-skulled than we thought, though.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*They share a laugh at Byron’s expense.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “What if he finds us here?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “I doubt he’d want people to know he got beat by a girl. Now, can I show you what I brought?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Luella nods. Gwen unzips her backpack and from it pulls out The Exorcist by William Peter Blatty. They open it and begin reading. The footage cuts to the sun setting. It jumps forward again.* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The view is blurry as if submerged in water. A finger wipes it away and Gwen speaks with a slight sniffle to her voice.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** \"Does he have to?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** \"I'm sorry, but my dad says the job is important.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** \"You have my number. Promise you'll call often.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Luella smiles as tears are streaming down her face.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** \"I will and we still have family living around here, so maybe it won't be long before we can see each other again.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** \"I'd like that. If this weekend is when you move then let's make sure it's a good one.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The video shows them spending time together skating, at the arcade, at the movies, and lastly stargazing at night while sharing some food.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “I’m going to miss this.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “Me too. I hope we can see each other again soon.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*They hug and then start the walk back to Luella’s home while holding hands.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “So tragic it couldn’t last.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat voice after spending so much time watching something pleasant was akin to waking up from a deep sleep to find a rabid wolf leering over you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*What’s shown next is a local news report. The date is June 10, 1986. The anchor is a woman by the name of Aimee Cole.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Aimee:** “Good evening, I’m Aimee Cole. Tonight’s top story is a tragic event. A young girl was found dead in the woods near Silver Oak Middle School.  Police suspect foul play. Although, the investigation is still ongoing. We’ll be sure to give updates as we receive them.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Gwen’s voice becomes audible. However, she isn’t shown during this.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen**: “That’s where we were supposed to….No, it can’t be.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Breaking News is what’s seen next. The date is a week later. Aimee is back on the screen.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Aimee:** “Following up on the report last week, the girl has been identified as twelve-year-old Luella Nolan. Police have arrested fourteen-year-old Byron Roberts on charges of her murder.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*There is only darkness for a brief period and then Ludus abruptly appears on the living room TV screen again.  Gwen is breathing heavily. When she speaks again she can’t manage anything louder than a whisper.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “Why? Why would you show me that? What was the point of making me lose her all over again?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:**  “To give you a second chance.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “How?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “I want to play a game with you, child.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “A game? Why?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “That isn’t something you need to know. What you should is the prize if you win.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “And what would that be?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “I can bring her back.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Gwen breathes in.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “What?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “I can bring her back for you.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Gwen considers this.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “How do I know this won’t be some kind of trick?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “A game once begun can not be interrupted. The rules once agreed upon are binding. Should you win, she will be revived in perfect health, albeit slightly older than when you last saw her. Do you accept? The game will be a test of pain. You are. of course, free to walk away and pretend this never happened. I’ll give you a moment to decide.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “I don't need one. I accept your challenge. I’ll bring Luella back.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ludus sounds slightly amused.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “I admire your spirit.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Something begins coming out of the tv screen. It’s as if pink static has somehow taken a solid humanoid shape.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was wrong. Whatever it is I can only describe it as unnatural and every fiber of my being screamed that fact at me while we watched it. I wondered if this was the point that broke the prisoner. Did he make it any further? Because it gets so much worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ludus snaps its fingers. A small red arrow made of light appears in the air.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “This is simply a marker. Now, pay close attention. I do not enjoy repeating myself.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “I’m listening.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “Once the game starts, the object before us will begin moving. Whoever’s turn it is must tell it to stop. Whoever it touches the most loses and we can not move from our spots.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “Okay, so to win I just have to get it to hit you more than me?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “That is one way to win, not that I’ve ever lost. Let the game begin. You can have the first play.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*At that moment the arrow moves all on its own. It moves quickly, bouncing around the living room.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “Stop.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The arrow freezes and so do she and Ludus. A barbed chain shoots out in the direction the arrow was coming from. It pierces through Ludus’s hand and takes off the ring finger of Gwen’s right hand. She screams.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “What the fuck?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Although the wound is fresh, there is no bleeding.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “I told you this game was about pain. Didn’t I?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “But you aren’t feeling any. You’re cheating.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “Oh, I am. I’ve just learned to embrace it.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was when we knew the true danger of this creature. I wish I could have helped somehow. Unfortunately, I was merely a spectator to the horrifying game that unfolded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “And I’ll show you something else. My turn.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The arrow moves again. Instead of saying stop, it declares something else.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “Hand for a hand.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*This time a chain takes off a hand from it and Gwen. She howls in agony. Ludus chuckles.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus**: “You can choose what body part to target on your opponent if you give up one of yours. What you pick just has to be of equal or lesser importance. Oh, and the brain and heart are instant win areas. It’s your turn, Gwen.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on the edge of our seats, hoping for some way that she could overcome this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The footage shows Gwen’s vision doubles from the pain.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “Fainting counts as a forfeit. If so, then I suppose the winner is…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “My turn…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The face on the form Ludus took shifts slightly almost as if it is smiling. The arrow moves and  Gwen screams out her next words.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “Leg for a leg.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The chain slices a leg off each of them. Gwen moans in pain instead of yelling. Presumably, she tried to prepare herself for it.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus: “**Only one thing can make people take such drastic actions. Unfortunately, it won’t be enough for you to win. My turn.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The arrow bounces around.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “Stop.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*This time it takes off both of Gwen’s arms. She falls back, screaming, The view shows her arms severed just above the elbow.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was chilling to see. Why would it do this? What does it have to gain from it? Is it pure sadism or something more? Part of me still can’t believe she kept going even after that. It should be obvious why, though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGwen forces herself back up into a sitting position. Although she is able to continue, the pain has once again impacted her vision. When she speaks, her voice is a lot weaker.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “My turn…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*When she commands the arrow to stop it misses them both. Ludus laughs.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “What a shame, girl. It seems the reunification you so desire won’t be happening, My turn.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The footage is blurry, but Ludus can still be heard.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “Leg for a leg.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy heart sank when it said this. We knew her fate was sealed. However, she did manage to surprise us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*The resulting pain she receives is so immense she is unable to scream. With the last of her strength, she takes her last turn and shrieks out her final words.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Gwen:** “Heart for a heart.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Ludus:** “What?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Ludus sounds surprised in its response. Its body lurches forward as the chain pierces it through its back. A heart is visible on it and right when the chain reaches Gwen, the video ends.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince watching the video we’ve done some investigating. Thanks to the news report shown as well as several surnames provided, we were able to locate Gwen’s town. We managed to track down friends and family of hers and discovered something surprising. Luella is alive. She works as a teacher at Silver Oak and we approached her for an interview, she was thankfully cooperative.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**\\[The following is a transcripted interview with Luella Nolan in her classroom. It was conducted by agent Stella Andersen\\]**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stella:** “Thank you for doing this, Ms. Nolan. I promise to try and get through these questions as quickly as possible.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “No need for the formalities.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stella:** “Alright then, Luella. What can you tell me about…?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “When I was kidnapped?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stella:** “You were kidnapped?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “Yes, I’m surprised you weren’t aware of that since you wanted to speak with me.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stella:** “If it makes you uncomfortable, you don’t have to go into detail. I just need a name if you can give one.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “There isn’t much to say about it. Some random creep pulled me into his car and drove off. He didn’t get far. Someone saw him and reported right away and the police managed to block him off before he could get to a highway. Luckily, he gave himself up without any trouble. It was horrible at the time, sure, but I’ve made peace with the incident.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stella:** “I’m glad for you.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella: “**Thank you.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stella:** “Now can you tell me about a girl you knew by the name of Gwen Stanton?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “The Stantons? I knew them years ago, but as far as I know, they only ever had one kid, a son. I never got any chance to interact with them before they moved.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stella:** “Wait, they moved?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “That’s right. It was when I was about to start high school.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stella:** “Did your family ever move from here?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “No, I’ve lived here since I was six.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stella:** “I think that will do for this interview. Thank you for your time, Luella.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “Don’t mention it.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Stella:** “Just one more thing. Did you ever have trouble with a boy named Byron Roberts?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Luella:** “No, I’ve never even heard of anyone with that name.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis interview has several troubling implications. Whatever happened as a result of Ludus and Gwen's game changed both the events involving her and people's memories of her. As for Bryon, we aren’t sure why he met the same fate. Although, considering what he did perhaps that is for the best. Then again, we don’t know much about him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe did consider showing Luella the tape as there would be a strong possibility that she would believe its contents. However, it seems almost cruel to do so without being able to offer any sort of comfort. Still, part of me thinks she deserves to know. I guess I have to think about it more. Since Stella interviewed her, we’ve been trying to find everything we can about what Ludus is and its goal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt seems to be after us specifically if the tapes being discovered at my old foster home is any indicator. That thing has been plaguing me ever since we discovered it. Maybe it’s playing a game with us. If it is, I hope with everything I have that it’s one we can win. I can’t promise to post consistently as we’ve had our hands full with this thing, but I’ll update when I am able.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is [Zane,](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) logging [out.](https://twitter.com/RoseBlack2222)",

        "text": "\nI was and still am a huge Amazing World of Gumball fan. It may be childish and have some of the dumbest punchlines, but that’s why I like it. It takes me back to times where I wasn’t as bothered and stressed as I am now. AWOG has always been known for its upbeat kind of episodes (except for the insanely popular The Grieving lost episode) so when I saw this, I just couldn’t believe it.\n\nIn 2013, I remember this episode that I’ve seen only one time, and it lives rent-free in my head. It was called “The Terror” and started off with the normal catchy theme song and it looked like a normal episode, but it didn’t feel like one. Every single time Gumball would say something, it sent a sense of unease down my spine, but I brushed it away thinking I was scared for a test the next day for class. Slowly, the episode got weirder and weirder. All of the kids went to school (full backpacks and “normal” middle school stuff) but it was in the middle of the night. Once the bus came, a hideously terrifying entity told the boys to get on. It was an unexpected jumpscare but now it had me on the edge of my seat. They say nothing and take the ride to school.\n\n Once Gumball and Darwin arrive at school, they start to stalk Alan in the dark. They get closer and closer while Alan screams bloody murder at the top of his lungs. Once Gumball and Darwin catch up to Alan, the lights go pitch black and then turn on again. I’m excited because I’m ready for another jumpscare, but nothing happened. Alan was floating there, strictly alive without a look of emotion on his face. Gumball and Darwin were just laughing and talking about how they could’ve popped him and left him until the morning until the school janitor arrives. \n\nAfterwards, they started to stalk Tina. The same thing happens as they walk closer and closer while Tina’s roars get louder and louder. The lights go out and turn back on. I’m still ready for another jumpscare since we haven’t had one since the beginning, but no jumpscare was there. Tina was now sitting down crying silently while Gumball and Darwin were laughing at her. \n\nThey then start to walk towards Anais and do the same thing, but this time Darwin backs out because she’s his sister. As soon as Gumball hears this, his neck turns 180 degrees, looks at Darwin, and spins back around all in about 5 seconds. At this point, I’m hating this episode but it literally feels like I can’t stop watching it. Basically, Gumball is stalking Anais and actually starts running towards her, but this time the camera is in a 1st person view and it constantly changes back and forth from Gumball running towards Anais to Anais running from Gumball. We can clearly see that Gumball is outrunning Anais and will eventually catch up and when he does, we’re put in the first person perspective of Anais. The TV turned completely off but I had assumed I sat on a remote or something, but looking back at it now, the remote was nowhere near me. Once I got up and turned the TV back on, we were still in the first person perspective of Anais. When she looked down, there was nothing but fire, melting faces, and screams of agony. I quickly turned the TV off again and kept it off for the rest of the night.\n\nI wish I could find this again but unfortunately I think it’s lost forever. The strangest part is that it didn’t scare me. It was literally making me nauseous out of anxiety. It’s still one of the weirdest episodes of any TV show I’ve ever seen and the first episode of a series to make me anxious like that. If anybody finds this, do not watch it. There might be an audio distortion that made me feel like this but I don’t know for sure and when I ask someone about this, they say they’ve never heard of it and brush it off.",

        "text": "**February 15**\n\n[Redacted] has tasked me with investigating a series of mysterious deaths in room 1905 of the [redacted] hotel in Boston, Massachusetts. It is a multi-floor luxury suite furnished for the wealthy guest that enjoys the anachronistic clash of modern home theater systems with gaudy Victorian furniture. The white glove butler service came complimentary with my duties to avoid paying guests from thinking they provide less-than-pristine service to anyone. \n\nThe hotel has existed here for over one and a half centuries and there are hundreds of rooms. Most of the staff has experienced a guest’s unexpected passing. The ones in this room have management on edge. Three guests in a row have taken their own lives in the living room by cutting their own throats after three days and no one can find the weapon. They have repressed coverage of the suicides for the moment in order to keep current and future guests at ease. The last thing the [redacted] hotel needs is superstitious millionaires doing business elsewhere.\n\nI left my duffle bag by the bedroom upstairs, set up my laptop in the study on the first floor, and performed a cursory search of the suite for anything peculiar. During previous contracts, I’ve found hidden speakers that emitted high frequencies to annoy guests, pests dying in the walls, amoral owners putting cameras behind mirrors and paintings. None of those were present here. I have, however, enjoyed observing a painting of a woman on the mantle in the living room. The artist - who didn’t sign his work - captivated my attention for much longer than I care to admit.\n\nI spent the rest of my day reviewing the information on the unfortunate guests. The first was an Italian novelist in the twilight of his career. Reviews poorly received his last few novels, and he told friends he was traveling to the states for inspiration. Upon his death, it appeared as though he hadn’t written a single word and, in overdramatic Roman fashion, decided he couldn’t live without his craft. The second was a distant member of a French royal family who wanted to attend a high-end fashion show. He had purchased a ticket and expressed interest to his friends and family about attending the event taking place on his second day here, yet he never left the hotel room. The third guest was a playboy interested in exploiting the local women for profit - no significant loss to humanity there. Again, a guest with aspirations beyond the hotel room had never left or brought anyone into the room with him despite being the most likely of the three to do so. His death would be the most likely catalyst for “deathly cursed hotel” headlines.\n\n&amp;&amp;&amp;\n\nI hadn’t noticed her smile before. I ate my supper in the dining area of the living room. It’s just a small table and two chairs. However, it has a view of the painting of a woman I mentioned earlier. Her full lips, heart-shaped face, and dark flowing hair are captivating. I felt embarrassed eating my meal in front of her because she couldn’t enjoy her own food. \n\nLook at me. I’m acting like a painting is real and feel like I’ve found new love. The wealthy must have something different in their wine or I’m simply too tired from the journey here and vivid hallucinations are filling my heart.\n\n**February 16**\n\nThe maître d’hôtel called my room to check in on me and my progress. I told him I found nothing of his interest so far and lied about inspecting the suite with a fine-tooth comb. Obviously, we are both aware that idioms are not literal. I’m entranced by the painting. I spent hours watching her and observing every detail. My duties come second to appreciating her beauty.\n\nMy infatuation with the woman is unfounded. I know every detail of her face and her tight red dress. The artist posed her delicate arms in front so she could subtly push her breasts together and entice me further. I blew her a kiss as I left the living room for the study to log today’s unproductiveness and I swear on my life her cheeks blushed.\n\n&amp;&amp;&amp;\n\nHer name is Juliette. The thought came to me while I was conversing with her during supper. It wasn’t like a normal thought I have while writing. The phrase “My name is Juliette” just appeared in my mind when I told her I thought I was impolite for referring to her as “the woman” or “the painting.” I’ve never liked the name since school has forced me to associate it with the infamous play.\n\nJust as I thought of the ending of the play, I noticed a dagger on the table in the painting. Juliette has enthralled my heart so much, I’m missing obvious details. Stranger yet, the artist orientated the handle to the left. As if he knew I was left-handed and wanted me to exert the least amount of effort to wield the thing. I wonder. Does Juliette have to dose herself with turpentine to complete the allegory?\n\n** February 17 **\n\nThe maître d’hôtel’s call interrupted her spell. Juliette called to me the second I woke up. Her voice is ambrosia to my ears. I failed to dress myself and stood before my love in just my underwear. Before my eyes, I couldn’t believe what I saw! Juliette slipped out of her dress and bared her naked body. My libido exploded and I approached the painting like a drooling dog to a bone.\n\nThe phone rang and snapped me back to reality. I held in my hand unnoticed, the dagger to my throat. The maître d’hôtel’s anxiety caused him to call early on the third day before another butler faced a traumatic scene. The momentary diversion allowed me to escape to the study and leave my naked Juliette disappointed. Despite being hypnotized into nearly terminating myself, I couldn’t stop lying to my savior.\n\nJuliette’s beautiful hands are still playing with my thoughts. I acted like a man talking on the phone with his wife while he was in bed with another woman. I assured him that nothing was wrong while caressing my face with the blade, as if it were the touch of a woman seducing me back to bed.\n\nI regret convincing him otherwise. I’ve been struggling to finish my final entry while Juliette is beckoning me to return to the living room. Please! Burn the painting!\n\n—\n\nI am a digital forensic specialist posting the logs of Joseph M. Leonard during his stay in room 1905 at the [redacted] hotel. He attempted to wipe his laptop’s hard drive by performing a factory reset prior to committing suicide in the living room. Fortunately for us, Leonard must not have been aware that a factory reset doesn’t wipe data. Instead, the data is freed up and made available to be overwritten. Very little information was unrecoverable.\n\nThe maître d informed me he marked the room as permanently reserved and forbid housekeeping from entering to prevent any further mysterious deaths. I told him about Leonard’s fascination with the supposedly haunted painting. He reacted with surprise; saying that none of the rooms had portraits. Unless a guest replaced a painting, they should all have been impressionist paintings of potted plants. Regardless, he promised to personally throw the cursed canvas in the furnace and watch it smolder.\n\nI requested photos of the crime scene to see the enchanting painting for myself. Most of the photos were worthless to me. Understandably, the photographer is looking down at the floor most of the time. Other shots were the single duffle bag near the bed and the laptop on the desk in the study. We never found the dagger Leonard had mentioned in his logs. There was only a single shot that included the portrait of the woman. Unlike Leonard’s descriptions, the woman wore a black dress that didn’t accentuate any of her features. Maybe it was her smile that drove him crazy in his three-day isolation.\n\nThe maître d called back to tell me that no paintings in the room depicted a woman. Being paranoid, he took the canvas that Leonard was probably facing before he died and attempted to burn it in the furnace. The canvas seemed to understand its fate and roll itself up as the maître d tried to feed it into the furnace. Before finally getting the thing in the flames, the canvas “bit” the maître d and left a deep cut on his hand. He said the wound wasn’t anything like a rough paper cut. Only something as sharp as a knife could have caused it. Or maybe a dagger.",

I looked over to Paige, watching as she quickly put a small brick of C-4 over the door frame.  Her eyes met mine as she gave me a nod. I returned it and checked my rifle, making sure the suppressor was tight. \n\n***“Four.”***\n\nThe glint of Eric’s scope reflected off the moonlight in the distance. He was about 100 yard’s away, sights trained on the door. The rose bush that he was sitting in swayed gently in the summer breeze. Looking around, this place really did have its own type of beauty. The garden was dotted with different kinds of flowers. Roses, Tulips, and Orchids flooded the landscape in a sea of colors. It felt like I had been dropped into a Van Gogh painting. \n\n***“Three.”***\n\nI checked my face mask, making sure it was secured over my mouth and nose. I could feel the rubber digging into my cheeks, breathing in the filtered air, hot and stale. Briefing indicated potential airborne agents that would cause… change. Metamorphosis, Trevor called it. A forced evolution, and an unwanted one. \n\n***“Two.”***\n\nI felt Wades tap on my shoulder, signaling me. My hand shot to my hip, grabbing a flat black square. I stuck it to the door frame and jammed my finger on the center. Instantly, five red dots popped up on the square moving erratically. Almost jerking, moving smoothly only for a second or two, then stopping and jumping forward. I turned and held up five fingers to Wade, who nodded and slammed the bolt home on his machine gun.\n\n***“One.”*** \n\nI took a breath to settle my heart rate, feeling the ridges of the rifle’s grip. It was calming. Like as long as I held on, nothing could ever hurt me. Paige’s detonator being primed snapped me from my self reflection as quickly as it came. One more breath. One more second of safety.\n\n***“Send it.”***\n\nThe calm was gone. The storm was here. The shit had hit the fan and there was no turning back. The charge shattered the door to splinters. I raised my rifle, turned in, and went to work.\n\nThere was no time to think. Instinct fueled me as I pushed inside, my eyes locking on to the target in front of me. The blast must have knocked them to the ground, seeing as they were still struggling to get to their feet, grabbing at a table to level themselves. I put two shots in the thing and swung left. \n\n***“On your six Rook.”***\n\nI felt Paige glide behind me as she put two into another one on the right hand side of the table. It was hard to focus. Trevor had cut the power so while I knew we were in the kitchen, I could hardly see anything. I moved slowly around the table listening for footsteps, watching the shadows for anything out of place. Something gave out a gurgled cry and lunged at me from the left side and I jumped backward. I had made it just in time as a large cleaver wedged itself into the hardwood. The creature chattered to itself while trying desperately to pull the knife out, making strange scritches and groans. Sounded like a lab rat that knew his time was up. The thing made it real easy for me to sight in as I turned its brain to mist, spraying the back wall with what was left of…whatever it was.\n\nA few more shots let off before I heard, \n\n***“Clear.”***\n\nA neon green light took over the room as Paige cracked a glow stick and dropped it on the table. Now that I was actually able to see, I could tell how nice the kitchen was. A long industrial sized shell of a room wrapped around me. Pans hung from the ceiling dropping down and swaying a bit before giving a soft little chime. The table itself must have been used to carve meat. It was stained all over with blood, the once yellowed wood taking on a soft orange hue with bones littering the tabletop. I bent down to pick one up and examine it. It was thin and long, possibly a rib bone. It had been stripped whole and bleached a bright white. What stood out to me most though, was the number of bite marks covering it. \n\nI looked down and examined the rest. They were all the same. Stripped and bleached yes but gnawed on. It came to me that these bones started to get bigger. Different bones, different parts from the corpse. These bones looked familiar, they couldn’t have been from an animal. \n\n***“Think I found Delta’s guy.”***  I said after dropping the bone back onto the heap.\n\n***“You’re sure?”*** Paige answered back after kicking a body away from the table.\n\n***“Come see for yourself.”*** \n\nI took the time to snap open my own glow stick and check the body of one of the creatures. Bending down I could see it was dressed in a dirty, handmade robe. The hood covering its face hung heavy. I had to actively try to lift it and underneath I saw why. It’s face was bare with no eyes, thin little slits for nostrils, and a wide, lipless mouth that hung open exposing broken jagged teeth. The ears had been removed, in their place sat two small craters, oozing green liquid down its blister covered neck. It was only when I lifted the head up that I found the eyes. All seventeen of them, protruding from the back of the creature's head. There was a deep purple covering where the whites were supposed to be and cat like cuts for the irises. I let it go with a wet smack onto the blood covered tile. Whoever these creatures were before the change, they made a damn good job to be as far from human as possible. \n\nPaige’s voice broke me from my thoughts.\n\n***“Whiskey Two to Whiskey One how copy?”***\n\n***“Copy Whiskey Two.”*** Trevor’s voice came back. ***“What do ya got?”***\n\n***“We found Delta Three. What’s left of her anyway. Primary objective reached. Requesting extraction.”***\n\nBefore Trevor could respond an angry, oily voice, heavy in a New Jersey accent came over the line.\n\n***“Negative Whiskey Two standby.”***\n\nThe line went dead as Paige let out a frustrated groan. ***“God Dammit Shay. Pinche Pendejo”***\n\nShay was the leader of Delta team. One of the Syndicates Twenty-six squads that operated around the world. He prided himself on pulling the most dangerous and lucrative jobs. With that clout however, came with him running his team ragged. Job after job, often operating for more than a month at a time. No wonder his girl got made. \n\n***“Whiskey Two be advised.”*** Trevor came back online again. ***“Operational parameters have changed.”***\n\n***“Changed to what Trevor?”*** Paige responded with just a hint of frustration.\n\n***“This is no longer a snatch and grab. Rendezvous with Delta at the entrance and initiate extermination protocols.”***\n\nI could feel Paige’s frustration grow but she just nodded and responded. \n\n***“Understood. Whiskey Two out.”***\n\nThe line went dead as she reloaded and walked towards the door leading deeper inside.\n\n***“Come on, Rook.”*** Her voice was laced with equal parts venom and determination. ***“I told you back in that conference room we’d be cleaning up this fucker’s mess.”***\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nThe conference room had been packed when we walked in. At least ten people inside, huddled together in tiny groups on opposite sides of the room. Each one strapped down with various weapons, and decked out in the latest gear the Syndicate could afford. \n\n“Do we normally pull joint ops with other teams?” I asked as I took my seat and reached for a manilla folder marked ‘OPERATION: GARDENER’ in big red letters.\n\n“Not a common thing but not unheard of either.” Trevor said, scanning the room. “Happened a lot more in the good ole days. Back when the Syndicate just started out, we didn’t have the training and vetting we do now. Half the time it seemed like they just found the biggest dude in the bar and put a gun in his hand” I tried to keep my head down a bit and act like that’s not exactly how they got me. If it aint broke then don’t fix it I guess.\n\n“Looks like we got Romeo and Delta along for the ride.” He continued before walking up to a woman on the right of us. She was tall with jet black hair that was half shaved, leaving the other side to fall over the left of her face.The MP5 she wielded was strapped to her waist while she thumbed through another op folder. She stopped when Trevor approached and gave a smile.\n\n“Hey Kate, how ya been?” \n\n“My my my. If it isn’t Trevor Whitlock. Been a while.” Her voice was soft and seductive, like she breathed it into Trevor’s ear instead of out loud. “Last I heard you had some trouble on the Nile.”\n\n“Never trouble. Just a minor…” He scratched the scruff of his short, graying beard as he thought. “Inconvenience.”\n\n“That’s not what I heard.” She said in a sing-song voice as she stood upright. She was easily half a foot taller than he was. “At least that’s not what management says.”\n\n“Management says a lot of things.” \n\n“That they do. When I got word Romeo was taking over your contracts for the time being I feared the worst.” She stepped a bit closer to Trevor. Whatever tension was currently happening It didn’t seem to phase him. \n\n“Look, if we need to leave, just say it.” Eric piped up resulting in a hand planting itself firmly into the back of his head, courtesy of Paige.\n\n“Don’t get used to it.” Trevor responded after a moment.  “CONUS duty just gave me a chance to get the Kid trained up. We’ll be back in the field in no time.” \n\nThis caused her attention to turn towards me. She began making her way over and put her hand out to shake mine.\n\n“Kate Watanabe.” She said with a smile that was trying way too hard to be friendly.\n\n“Marcus Kent.” I said as I took her hand and shook it. She seemed odd, doll-like would be the best way to describe it. Like she wanted you to notice her, to like her. She let go of my hand and turned back to Trevor, completely ignoring the others. \n\n“Good seeing you Trevor. Stay out of trouble now okay?” She said with a wink as she joined the rest of her team.\n\n“God I hate her.” I heard Paige let out as soon as Kate was out of earshot. \n\n“You just hate her because she’s into Trevor.” Eric said teasingly. “Ain’t that right Wade?”\n\n“Look man.” Wade said, dropping into his chair with a mighty thud. “There’s only a few things I’m scared of. Paige is one of those things. You’re on your own.” \n\nWe all let out a laugh as Trevor walked back, leaning in so only we could hear. “Do you think for just once you can act like professionals? Did you even consider why they pulled two teams off active duty and brought us up?” \n\nThe table grew silent as we all looked down or away. Anything to not meet his gaze. He waited a moment before exhaling and sitting next to me.\n\n“Grab a folder and pay attention. Here they come.” \n\nSusan Bell, the short, stubby woman who acts as the main presenter in briefings walked down the aisle towards the projector. By her side, however, walked a large, barrel chested, gorilla of a man wearing a muscle tank and cargo pants. His skin was tanned, well from what I could see, as most of it was covered in arm hair. His face didn’t leave anything bare either. A gruff beard ran from neck to lip then up to an unkempt goatee. The mutton chops on the side of his head covered his jaw as they reached out to touch his chin. A long jagged scar across his eye completed his wildman look. He approached the podium as Susan dimmed the lights and turned on the projector. Whatever conversations that were still being had immediately went silent as he placed a massive shotgun on the table next to him. \n\n“Evening. For those of you who don’t know me, I’m Shay LaGrand, leader of Delta, and operation overseer for this mission. “\n\nWe stayed silent as the projector flipped through to an image of a latin man. He was smiling with his hair slicked back wearing a tuxedo. It was a pretty old picture, judging from the graininess. Maybe taken back in the 90’s.\n\n“Meet Raul Delgado. Bolivia’s hot shot botany genius way back when. This is the last known picture of Raul before his trek into the Amazon Basin. He was in search of finding plants that could be used to counteract something known as Stoneman’s Syndrome, a disease that causes the body to overproduce calcium deposits and make bone grow on the outside of the body. This-” He said as the slide changed. “Is when he returned.” \n\nOn the screen was a black and white photo of…something. It was humanoid for sure. But it was also pure white, latticed with shards of bone crossing, and weaving the whole body. Where his head of slick black hair once was, now rested a cocoon of bone. It twisted and circled around his face till it ended in a small, black hole in the center. It was walking towards the camera, arms outstretched as if it was ready to be carried off by angels. In one hand he held a small leatherbound book in the other, he was clutching a flower. Its bright white seemed to draw a blindspot in the photo. Like every other color that was present when the picture was taken, was drawn into it. Each petal was marked with a single dot and the stem itself was as long as the thing that was holding it. \n\n“He was gone two years. In that time he not only contracted the disease…It had mutated. The man could walk, talk, and have full cognitive function. He would later go on to publish a manifesto-” The slide changed to the same picture as before yet zoomed in to focus on the book. “In it he describes his journey in the jungle. How he became separated from his party, got lost, and floated for days down the river. Supposedly he washed ashore onto a long forgotten Incan city. It was there he found the quote ‘la orquidea de dios’ or Orchid of God.” \n\nThe next slide showed a close up of the flower. Even now it was hard to get a good look at it. The photo seemed to burn out the closer it got to the petals. It was unsettling since the rest of the picture was normal, yet when it came to the orchid, it warped. Like it didn’t want to be seen.\n\n“He goes on and on discussing how this orchid saved his life. How it allowed him to evolve. Achieve a higher state of being. The manifesto was circulated through some fringe science communities online, gaining a bit of a cult following before Raul fell completely off the radar. We believe it was to take that online following and turn it into something tangible and dangerous.”\n\nThe next slide showed pictures of at least twenty people. All of whom were on missing persons posters.   \n\n\n“In the past ten years more than thirty of the world's top biologists, botanists, and chemists have gone missing. Inside sources indicate that Mr. Delgado may be recruiting them for something called  ‘The Cultivation’. Local law enforcement has been trying for years to get a strike team in to search the place but have been failing due to what they call ‘unexplained electromagnetic phenomena’. Seems that whatever is going on there blocks out all satellite signals. In an attempt to gather information for interested third parties I have opted to send one of my own undercover to Mr. Delgado’s mountainside estate for reconnaissance.”\n\nThis last slide stood out from all of the others. Not for its bleakness but for its beauty. A mansion rested on top of a hill surrounded by a sea of flowers. Dozens of colors danced across the landscape. It went on forever, nearly enveloping the house, as it crept up and over the driveway, surrounding, and drowning the cars parked there.\n\n“In the last few weeks our contact has been relaying information while under the guise of a fan and follower of Delgado. She talked about how they began to import certain strains of flowers from all over the world. Additionally, they’ve begun research into air filtration systems, how they work, how to maintain them et cetera. We had feared an attack was getting ready to take place until Ashley went dark. That’s why you're all here. We’re gonna raid that compound.”\n\nA small murmur came from the tables surrounding us. People began spewing complaints left and right, mostly about what they were gonna be doing, who they were gonna be doing it with, and how much they were gonna get paid for it. Shay quickly had enough and slammed his fist onto the podium.\n\n“Shut it!” He bellowed as the murmuring died down. “If you must know, the stipend is 100,000 per team, but I know you all have done a lot worse for a lot less, so I don’t want to hear shit about pay! We find Ashley, pull her out, cap a few people dumb enough to follow a nutcase with a green thumb and get the hell out. Am I clear?”\n\nNo one said anything as Shay scanned the room. \n\n“Good. Romeo you’re on overwatch, there’s a mountain range a half mile to the north of the compound.”\n\n“Whatever you say.” I heard Kate’s cool and calm voice ring out. \n\n“Whiskey, you're the ground team with delta. Breach through the kitchen here on this southside. Delta will breach in through the garage. We cover more ground, we find Ashley faster. Where’s Whitlock?”\n\nTrevor stood slowly with a groan and gave a stretch. “Right here brother.” \n\n“You’re with me on the command line. Full control of the powergrid and water supply. We’ll have you linked in on a closed circuit comm channel to get past the dead zone.”\n\n“Understood. Let’s get it done.”\n\n“Try not to fuck it up like you did Egypt.” Shay said with a sly a shit eating grin. I could feel the heat of anger begin building in Trevor. He took a second but responded in the same tone.\n\n“We won’t let you down man.”\n\n“You better not. Now-” Shay said while grabbing his shotgun and slinging it over his shoulders. “You all have your orders. Move out.”\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nI followed Paige’s lead as we tiptoed down the hall. We had to move slowly through the darkness, cracking open a chemlight every few meters just to give off a smidge of glow. What was illuminated however, put me into Delgado’s shoes, into his path to madness. At first everything seemed pretty normal. Multiple degrees on the wall, shitty modern art, dressers laden with books as thick as a dictionary, the works. As we kept going down however, things began to… evolve. \n\nIt started subtly enough. A simple houseplant rested on a stand. Even in the dim green glow it looked beautiful. Deep purple leaves with a bright, neon blue center. It was standing under a picture of Delgado and a woman. He was wearing a simple white suit that did well to give contrast to his dark skin. The woman was young, with a bright vibrant smile marked with a dimple on her right cheek and dark hair that came down to her waist. She wore a long white gown and several gaudy jewelry pieces. In front of them both was a child. A boy wearing the same style suit as Raul. Pretty much everything about him was the same. Same slicked back hair, same skin tone. The only thing that stood out was the same dimple the woman had, reflected on him. \n\n***“I didn’t know the mark had a family.”***  I said. Looking behind me I saw the big green light dangling off Wade’s neck pause for a moment. A glance up the hall showed that Paige’s light stopped as well. \n\n***“He doesn’t***.***”*** Paige’s voice cracked back softly. ***“We would have been briefed otherwise.”***\n\n***“Yeah he does. I’m looking right at them.”***\n\n***“Fuck are you talking about man?\"*** Eric piped up. I heard the cracking of branches through the comms as he left his post to join us.\n\n***\"I'm talking about the fact that Delgado has a wife and kid! Look!\"***I turned and pushed the picture to Wade as he approached. He took and held it up close to his face, using the chemlight to scan it. Slowly, his head came up, his eyes meeting mine as he tapped the earpiece and mimed the number three. I switched over to channel three on the earpiece with a slightly indignant ***“What?”***\n\n***“There’s no one here man.”*** \n\n***“What? Fuck do you mean there’s no one there?”***\n\n***“I mean-”***  He walked closer to me and showed me the picture again. My heart sank as I saw what he was talking about. There was no child. No woman smiling happy and proud. There was no Raul Delgado. Just a picture of a flower. Its long stem reaching to the top of the frame, deep purple dots, marking each white petal. \n\n***“What the fuck.”*** I muttered out. My hands shook softly as I studied the picture that was once a family portrait only moments ago. ***“Wade. Man, I swear I know what I saw.”***\n\n***“I know.”*** He replied with a slow nod. His voice, while deep, was trying its best to sound soothing, to calm me. ***“We don’t know the extent of this place. We don’t know if these things can manipulate us by imagery or if it’s strictly airborne. Until we do, keep these thoughts to yourself. Last thing we need is to be worried about one of our own.”***\n\nHe was right. We were at that crossroads, where it was too late to turn back, yet too early for things to go wrong. All I could do was keep pushing forward. I put the frame back on the desk as a beeping noise came through the earpiece. We were being signaled. I flicked the comm channel as Paige’s shrill chastising came through. \n\n***“Wade! Markus! Where the hell are you?!”***\n\n***“Sorry.”*** I said as I calmed the small flame of fear that burned in the back of my brain. ***“Found something on one of these dressers, Wade came to see if he could figure out what it was. Give us a second, we're right behind you.”***\n\n***“No Rook, you’re not.”*** She exclaimed as that flame ignited even brighter. ***“I’m over by the entrance with Delta. How do you even get lost in a hallway?”***\n\nMy eyes shot towards where I last saw her. There was nothing. No chemlight, no cracked doorway to guide the way, only pitch blackness. I turned to Wade. His body was on edge as he scanned all around us. He looked over at me as I caught his eyes, apprehension causing them to appear twitchy and unfocused. ***“I don’t like this shit man.”*** He said as he fired up his mic. ***“Eric, what's your twenty?”***\n\n***“What are you talking about man? I’m here with everyone. How the hell I got past your giant ass I’m not sure but you told me to go ahead of you.”***\n\n***“NO Eric, I did NOT.”*** He was shouting into the comm now, frantic to understand the position we were in. \n\n***“Jus- et- ere-”*** Paige’s voice came back garbled over static. \n\n***“Paige?! Say again?”*** I needed to hear them. To have that comfort and security that was so quickly jerked from underneath me. I was greeted with nothing but static. \n\n***“Paige? PAIGE?!”*** \n\nIt was no use. She was already gone.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n My breath was ragged as Wade and I rushed down the hall. When Paige’s and Eric’s voices were reduced to static we threw caution to the wind and took off. Whatever adrenaline that ran through us however, was quickly extinguished when, after what must have been ten minutes of running, we had only seemed to make it about 100 feet, the moonlight illuminating the doorway to the kitchen. \n\n***“What…The…Fuck”*** I heaved out, clutching my knees and gasping for whatever little sips of filtered air this mask would give me.\n\n***“It’s… Hallucinogenic… Gotta be.”*** Wade wasn’t doing any better. He was upright, but only by leaning against the wall. He coughed loudly, clearing his throat, doing his best to hold down whatever he had in his stomach. \n\nAfter a moment or two we both began to breathe properly and get our heads on right.\n\n***“Whatever this place is, wherever we are, we can’t get there fast.”*** I said as I pulled some more chemlights out of my pack and cracked one. ***“We take it slow. Drop these every 100 paces.”***\n\nI could hear Wade grunt and exhale deeply as he nodded. ***“Good idea. We need to see if we can get back into signal range too. First things first. Lead the way. I got your six.***\n\nWe began making our way down the hall. For whatever reason the house decided to give us passage as the light behind us started to dim. After a few minutes we finally reached the end, coming up onto a single, heavy, oak door. \n\n***“Careful.”*** Wade said just loud enough for the mic to pick up, almost at a whisper. \n\nI didn’t answer audibly, just giving a single nod as I turned the handle. Slowly, I inched the door open, pointed my muzzle inside, and began scanning the room. Without my needing to say so, I heard the crack of a chemlight as Wade tossed it as far as he could. The light that came from where it landed showed high shelves, a large wooden desk, and books as far as the eye could see. We had found our way into the madman's study.\n\nWe crept slowly inside. Everything on the walls hung still, caked in dust. This place looked like it hadn’t been used in years. \n\n***“Don’t believe it,”***  Wade said as he kicked over some books stacked on the ground. \n\n***“What do you mean?”*** I asked, looking back at him as I made my way over to the desk.\n\n***“All this…shit.”*** He waved his hands, gesturing to the room around us. ***“I don’t buy it for a second that any of this is real. Something here is fucking with the occipital and temporal lobes of the brain. Simulating a psychotic break. We could be running around in a broom closet for all we know.”***\n\n***“Uh huh,”*** I said as I began rifling through the drawers of the desk. There wasn’t much inside save for a few empty binders and post-it notes. ***“And what makes you an expert on human psychology?”*** \n\n***“In this case it’s psychiatry, and the master's degree from Harvard does.”*** He said matter of factly. I could almost see the smirk on his face as he no doubt could see the look of shock on mine. \n\n***“Dude-”*** I said after taking a moment. ***“Just how many jobs have you had?”***\n\n***“Enough to know what I’m talking about.”*** He said, trying hard to stifle a laugh. ***“Let’s just say I've been around long enough to have diversified my portfolio.”***\n\n***“Sounds like it. So how do we beat it?”*** I cracked open a few more chemlights as I made my way to the far end of the room.\n\nWade took a moment to think before sounding equal parts frustrated and defeated. ***\"In layman's terms, you don't. You can try to offset it, but to completely pull yourself out? You have to be pulled out by someone else.\"*** \n\n*Of course we do.* I thought. They could never make anything easy.\n\nSomething… changed as I took the steps into the inky darkness. Things weren't just dirty and unused. They were rotting. The shelves were cracked and chipped, covered in a mass of termites that feasted on the remains. The books went from old to archaic. I picked one up and thumbed through the pages. I couldn't even read it. The lettering faded into almost translucent paper. The spine was non-existent. This wasn't a library anymore, but a tomb. \n\nI had to fight the urge to empty my supply of light in this one room. I didn't want to be here. This wasn't supposed to go like this. Trapped here in this house of horrors. I clutched a light tight to my chest as I made my way onward towards the far wall. The shelves that lined my left and my right were replaced by a large stone fireplace. You could have tossed a bear in there to roast with how wide it was. Off to the right hand side stood another heavy black door, and above it, hooked onto the massive stone chimney, was another photo. \n\nThis one was similar to the last. It was blown to massive proportions, like some kind of twisted family portrait. There was Raul, standing there all dignified and still, well, human. It was hard to imagine that this face of scientific nobility would be morphed and twisted into the creature we were now hunting. The kid looked largely the same as before. It was just… well I couldn’t put my finger on it, but he seemed terrified. Like his facial features and posture were the same but he just, well… I could feel it. My eyes instinctively shot towards the woman. It was then that I knew what had changed. Her sweet, motherly smile was now gone. In its place sat two rows of thin, jagged teeth, curled into a joker-like grin. Her eyes cast down towards the boy, like she was sizing up her next meal. The once sleek long hair was now matted in parts, and wild in the rest, protruding in every direction, giving her the appearance of some sort of demented mad scientist.\n\nWade came up from behind, startling me. For someone so big he sure could be silent when he wanted to. \n\n***“What do you see?”*** He said as his eyes scanned the picture trying to discern what it was showing me. \n\n***“Well… I can tell you what it’s not.”*** I said looking over to him. He responded with a single understanding nod. It felt comforting to know I wasn't going through this alone. Sure, Wade's brain wasn't being strapped down and forced to go through a Rorschach test every twenty minutes. But, he was here. That's what mattered. \n\n***\"So-\"*** I said after turning away from the portrait, facing him fully.\n\n***\"Offsetting. How do we do it?\"***\n\n***\"Simple.\"*** He said, holding his gaze a bit longer on the picture before turning to me. ***\"Just, think of something ridiculous. Something that can't be twisted and corrupted.\"*** \n\n***\"All right.\"*** I said skeptically. ***\"Like what?\"*** \n\nHe thought for a moment before letting out a small chuckle.\n\n***\"What?\"***\n\n***\"Well what's an embarrassing story from your childhood?\"***\n\nHis question threw me for a loop. I nearly forgot that we were lost in a fun house stuffed with Heaven's Gate rejects. \n\n***\"You're serious?\"*** I asked after a moment.\n\n***\"As a heart attack.\"***\n\n***\"Um…\"*** I racked my brain, trying to think. ***\"Oh. I guess when I got caught wearing my sister's cheerleading outfit one time when I was six?\"*** \n\nThere was silence for a moment. I saw Wade's laughter before I heard it. His body heaving back and forth. He let out a massive howl and clutched his stomach, laughing his ass off. \n\n***\"Whew, God I gotta hear the outcome of this.\"*** \n\n***\"Nah man, that wasn't the deal. What about you, huh? What stupid shit did little Wade get into?\"***\n\nIt took him a moment to stop laughing. Honestly this conversation was making me feel a little bit better. It was easier to forget the last thirty minutes. Even for a moment. \n\nWade wiped his eyes as he looked at me. ***\"When I was little I got attacked by a group of chickens. My grandpa had some that I would feed when I came to visit. I was about four carrying a bucket one day when I tripped and got covered in feed. Little fuckers had a field day.\"***\n\nIt was my turn to laugh now. I clutched my stomach and howled imagining the giant Wade being bested by some one-foot hens. I heard Wade's boots crunch on the floor as he put his hand on my shoulder.\n\n***\"You laugh but those things are ferocious, feel better?\"***\n\nI nodded and wiped my eyes. **“Yeah.”** I said, standing up, and turning towards the door. **“*****Let's go put a bullet in this thing.\"***\n\nHe swept his hand towards the door as he positioned himself behind me.\n\n***\"Lead the way. And remember, be aggressive. B E aggressive.\"***\n\n***\"Fuck you.\"*** I said with a chuckle as I twisted the handle and threw the door open. \n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\nThe hallway we found ourselves in now was the complete opposite of the one before. Instead of the dark and dingy tunnel that we ran from, this place was a warm and cozy reprieve. Gone was the rotting hardwood. Instead itt was replaced by a rolling red carpet leading to a massive white door with six black dots painted in a circle around it. Candelabras dotted the many countertops and side tables in view, rendering our chemlights useless. Pictures covered the walls from top to bottom, all displaying the same unsettling image from the room before.\n\n***\"Is it weird that this place is creepier than where we just came from?\"*** I said as I took a step inside.\n\n***\"Maybe the house is settling for enticing over sheer terror.\"*** Wade whispered out as we made our way further in.\n\n***\"Doubt it.\"*** I did my best to avoid looking at the pictures as I walked along. Didn't want to know what other shit this place was going to pull out of its bag of tricks. As I got about halfway however, I couldn't stop myself. There was a glint at the corner of my eye and I glanced over to take a look. I immediately wished I hadn't. The woman was leaning down to the boy now. Her jaw unhinged to an enormous width as her teeth rested on either side of his head. His cheeks were swollen and red as a thin line of tears streaked down his face. \n\nI couldn't take it anymore. I was tired of being fucked with. I jammed my fist into the glass and ripped the photo from its frame, tearing it into pieces before dropping it to the floor.\n\n***\"Easy man. Don't let it get to you so bad it's just-\"***\n\nHe trailed off as a noise started echoing in the room. Like a fly right in your ear, an incessant buzzing. It was only when I looked down that I saw what it was. The torn shreds of the picture were moving. Vibrating. I was about to bend down to inspect them when I heard the same sound coming from the frames on the desk and all of the pictures on the walls. Every single one was moving and shifting. It sounded like we were in an earthquake when suddenly they all stopped. \n\n***\"Well… that was weir-\"*** Suddenly all the glass shattered at once, covering us in a shower of clear, jagged, grains. The pictures flew from their frames. They swirled around us before flying towards the white door. \n\n***\"Please tell me I'm not the only one seeing this!\"*** I yelled out over the swelling cacophony of the paper smacking against the door, each photo overlaying the other, covering every free space it could find. \n\n***\"Trust me you're not!\"*** Wade yelled. His eyes were wide and transfixed before him in terror.\n\nI turned back towards the door and saw why. My blood ran cold. The chill of recognition falling over me. \n\nThe pictures were folding and twisting around each other at such speed that they began to make some semblance of a movie. The woman's face appeared as she was when I first saw her. Smiling normal and meaningful, but that quickly began to change. Her eyes bulged as her smile widened to an inhuman size. Her teeth cracked on themselves forming small serrated daggers that began to hone in on the small boy. His tears were falling in motion now as he was powerless to move. She leaned down and opened her maw, a forked, snakelike tongue twisting and flicking against her now serpentine mouth. Her jaw extended wider, cracking the bones open as she settled it around his head and shoulders. My eyes met his and for one brief moment he moved. His mouth silently mimed; *help me,* as her jaw slammed shut.\n\n***\"What the fuck is this!?\"*** I yelled as I clicked the safety off and raised it to the door. She released her jaws letting the body fall flat and half eaten, organs strewn on the flowing green grass. Time seemed to fast forward as she turned her attention to Raul. Her body began to shift and twitch as bones dislocated and shattered. What was once a beautiful young woman turned into a long, flesh colored serpent, wrapping herself around the man. He stood so still, like a statue, looking out at us as her jaw unhinged once again and she latched onto his head. \n\nThe snake began undulating and heaving as it worked its way down Raul's body. He never moved. Not even so much as a twitch. Before my eyes, the snake had reached his feet and lifted up, completely consuming him. I froze. I didn't know whether to pull the trigger and remove this from my sight or turn and run. Its slitted eyes met mine as it heaved again. Not a sick heave. But a heave of laughter. \n\nIt's body shifted for the very last time. This time, into the form of a human. It began growing long bone-white appendages for its arms and legs. Its body wrapped itself in a carapace of a lashing white exoskeleton. The final shift was completed by its head slowly bubbling like melted putty as it formed a cone around itself with one single black hole at the center.\n\nIt stood there with its arms outstretched. Its body bending backward at an unnatural angle as it pushed its chest towards the sky. The pictures or camera or whatever the hell this was, panned upward. It showed the sun beating down, so much was the intensity that I could nearly feel the heat. And then it was eclipsed. A vine so massive passed in our view as we slowly panned back down. Before us, sat a single being. It was covered in its bone white body, one hand outstretched and delicately, almost lovingly, wrapped around the bud of a flower. Its six white petals were each dotted with a single purple mark that seemed to suck in the light and color around it, clogging our vision. \n\n***\"The Orchid!\"*** I gasped out and started to turn to Wade ***\"It's not the house doing this. It's not Raul, it's that fucking Orc-\"*** I stopped in my tracks. Wade's eyes were glossed over. His machine gun hung limply at his side as he smiled, tears streaming down his face.\n\n***\"Do you see it?\"*** He asked, fighting back tears. ***\"Doesn't it look so beautiful?\"***\n\n***\"What?!\"*** I slapped Wade across the face. ***\"Okay no, not here. We're not doing this. Wake the fuck up man!\"*** I snapped my fingers in his ears, shaking him, nothing worked as he dropped to his knees. Like he was kneeling to a higher power. ***\"All she wants is us to grow.\"*** He finally turned to me, smiling wide. ***\"To evolve. To become more than we are now.\"*** He clutched at me with his massive paws. ***\"We just need to let her in, Markus.\"***\n\n***\"Wade!\"*** I slapped him again, this time harder. ***\"Snap out of it!\"*** It was like a toddler throwing a punch at Mike Tyson. Nothing seemed to work. Suddenly, I heard a snap behind me and turned back to the door. The creature in the photos was standing upright now looking at me, its head cocked to the side. It twitched jarringly back and forth, like a badly puppetted doll. Then in an instant it leapt at me. It ran so unnaturally. Its legs jerked and popped while its body stayed rigid, and it moved so remarkably fast. I brought my weapon up again, sighting in on it as it reached its long fingers out, grabbing at me. It reached to the forefront of the picture. As I fired, I could have sworn that its fingers breached through to the material world..\n\nI emptied an entire mag into the door. I heard the splinters of wood as my bullets cut through. Sawdust kicked up as I reloaded and aimed again waiting to see the creature's body in front of me. \n\nBut I didn't see it. The thing was gone. The only thing in front of me was a bullet riddled white door. \n\nI heard Wade groan, feeling the ground creak as he sat up. \n\n***\"Ugh, what the hell just happened?\"*** He asked, looking up at me.\n\nI reached out to him, extending my hand for him to take. ***\"Nothing man. Don't worry about it.\"*** He eyed me for a moment but grabbed onto me as I helped pull him up. \n\n***“Let’s go.”*** I said with a sigh, looking away from him and turning to the door. ***“Almost there.”***\n\nI heard the sound of his bolt being pulled back as I began walking. \n\n***“Right behind you.”***",

        "text": "The darkness in my room was absolute, and I couldn't help but feel like I was being watched. I had always been a little afraid of the dark, but tonight it felt like something was different. The air was thick and oppressive, and I could hear the sound of my own breathing echoing in the stillness.\n\nI tried to tell myself that I was being ridiculous, that there was nothing to be afraid of. But the feeling persisted, and I found myself reaching for my phone, wanting to break the silence with some mindless scrolling.\n\nAs I reached for the phone on my nightstand, I noticed something strange in the shadows. It was a faint, flickering light, and it seemed to be getting closer. At first, I thought it was just my eyes playing tricks on me, but as the light grew brighter, I realized that it was something far more sinister.\n\nI could feel my heart racing as the light approached my bed, illuminating the face of a figure that seemed to materialize out of nowhere. It was a woman, but there was something off about her, something that made my skin crawl.\n\nShe was wearing a long, flowing dress, and her hair hung in wild tangles around her face. But it was her eyes that really terrified me. They were dark and empty, like there was nothing behind them but an endless void.\n\nI tried to scream, but no sound came out. I was paralyzed with fear, unable to move or even breathe. The woman just stood there, staring at me with those empty eyes, as the flickering light bathed us both in an eerie glow.\n\nAnd then, just as suddenly as she had appeared, she was gone. The darkness rushed back in, and I was left alone with my thoughts.\n\nI didn't sleep at all that night. I lay in bed, shaking with fear, unable to shake the feeling that I was being watched. The next morning, I tried to tell myself that it was just a dream, that it couldn't have been real.\n\nBut as the days went on, I started to notice other strange things happening around me. Objects would move without explanation, and I would catch glimpses of that woman out of the corner of my eye.\n\nI tried to ignore it, to convince myself that it was just my imagination running wild. But as the incidents grew more frequent and more terrifying, I knew that something was seriously wrong.\n\nAnd then, one night, she appeared again. This time, she was standing right next to my bed, her face mere inches from mine. I could feel her breath on my skin, and I knew that I was in mortal danger.\n\nBut then something strange happened. The woman reached out and touched my hand, and in that moment, I felt a surge of warmth wash over me. It was as if all the fear and terror that had been gripping me for so long suddenly melted away.\n\nI looked into her eyes, and this time, they weren't empty. They were filled with a depth of emotion that I couldn't quite understand, a mix of sorrow and regret that seemed to weigh heavily on her.\n\nAs I reached out to touch her face, her features began to shift and contort in a grotesque manner. Her eyes became hollow and dark, and her skin turned a sickly shade of gray. I tried to pull away, but her grip on my hand was tight, unyielding.\n\nI felt a chill run down my spine as her voice echoed through the darkness, a low, guttural sound that seemed to come from deep within her. She spoke of the things that lurked in the shadows, the beings that fed on fear and terror, the skin walkers that haunted the night.\n\nIn that moment, I realized that the warmth I had felt was not kindness or compassion, but something much darker. The woman in the darkness was not a benevolent spirit, but a malevolent force that fed on the fear of others.\n\nI struggled to free myself from her grip, but it was no use. I was trapped in her embrace, at the mercy of her whims. And as the night wore on, I felt myself slipping deeper and deeper into a state of terror and despair.\n\nThe hours pass by, and I lose all sense of time. It feels as if I've been trapped in this cycle of fear forever, and I begin to wonder if I'll ever escape.\n\nBut then, something unexpected happens. The woman's grip on my hand loosens for a moment, and I seize the opportunity to pull away. I stumble backward, gasping for air, my heart racing.\n\nI fumble in my pocket for my phone and quickly type out a message, hoping that someone will see it and come to my rescue. I hit the send button, and the message disappears into the ether.",

        "text": "I had always been intrigued by the abandoned mansion at the end of my street. The old, decrepit building stood as a reminder of a time long forgotten, and I often found myself staring at its windows, imagining what secrets lay hidden within.\n\nOne day, I decided to explore the mansion. I crept up the overgrown path, the rustling of leaves underfoot echoing in the eerie silence. As I pushed open the front door, a musty smell filled my nostrils, and I shuddered at the dampness that hung in the air.\n\nAs I stepped inside, a sense of foreboding washed over me. The once-grand entrance hall was now empty, except for a flickering candle that cast eerie shadows across the walls. I moved through the darkened rooms, my heart pounding in my chest, feeling as though I was being watched.\n\nSuddenly, I heard a creaking sound, like someone walking on the floorboards. I froze, listening intently as the footsteps grew louder and closer. I turned to flee, but something grabbed my ankle, sending me crashing to the ground.\n\nPetrified, I looked up to see a figure standing over me. It was a woman, dressed in a tattered wedding gown, her hair matted and tangled. She had a ghostly pallor, and her eyes glowed with an otherworldly light.\n\nShe spoke, her voice a whisper, and I shuddered at the sound. \"You shouldn't be here,\" she said, \"this is my home now.\"\n\nI tried to run, but my legs refused to obey me. The woman advanced, and I could feel her icy breath on my face. I closed my eyes, waiting for the end to come.\n\nWhen I opened them again, I was lying on the street outside the mansion, with no memory of how I got there. But I knew one thing for sure – I would never venture into that haunted house again.\n\n\nDays went by, and the memory of my encounter with the ghostly woman in the mansion began to fade. I tried to convince myself that it had just been a vivid nightmare, brought on by my overactive imagination.\n\nBut I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. Strange noises in the night, unexplained shadows darting across the room - I felt like I was being watched, no matter where I went.\n\nOne night, as I was getting ready for bed, I heard a soft whisper in my ear. It was a woman\n\nnetwork error\n's voice, the same one that had spoken to me in the mansion. \"Don't forget about me,\" she whispered, \"I'm still here.\"\n\nI spun around, but there was no one there. My heart was racing, and I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck standing up. I tried to convince myself that it was just my mind playing tricks on me, but deep down, I knew that something was terribly wrong.\n\nAs the days went on, the presence in my house grew stronger. Doors would slam shut on their own, objects would move without explanation, and I would wake up in the middle of the night to find the ghostly woman standing at the foot of my bed.\n\nI knew that I needed to do something before it was too late. I did some research and discovered that the mansion on my street had once belonged to a wealthy family. The wife had died tragically, and her ghost was said to haunt the property to this day.\n\nI decided to visit the mansion once more, armed with the knowledge I had gained. This time, I came prepared with a sage bundle and a rosary. As I entered the mansion, I could feel the woman's presence growing stronger, but I pushed through my fear and began to cleanse the house.\n\nAs I made my way through the rooms, I could feel the energy shifting. The air grew lighter, and the oppressive feeling that had plagued the house for so long began to lift.\n\nFinally, I made my way to the room where the woman's spirit was said to linger. I could feel her presence there, watching me. I spoke to her, telling her that it was time for her to move on, that she didn't belong in this world any longer.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, she was gone. The feeling of dread and oppression lifted, and I knew that the mansion was no longer haunted.\n\nAs I made my way back to my own house, I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. I had faced my fears and conquered them. But I knew that I would never forget the ghostly woman who had haunted both my dreams and my reality, and I would always wonder what secrets had caused her to linger in the world of the living for so long.",

        "text": "I slowly stood up, taking in the woman in front of me, [Eleanora](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/113y7xs/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_going_for_a_swim/). She was short, had long brown hair, and looked extremely kind and warm. Her smile radiated love, and she tilted her head to get a better look at me as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“You are not what I expected, dear Harper.” She pulled me into a hug, and I quickly embraced her back, feeling her warmth. “But I am so glad you are here.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI pulled away, smiling at her, and noticed a slight gold glow surrounding her. I realized I was staring and hadn’t said a word to her, and quickly looked away, embarrassed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“It’s great to finally meet you. I’ve been trying to get to you, but I didn’t know how.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“It is not the easiest task to travel across this plane, but I knew you would be able to do it.” \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI looked at her again, closely studying her, when realization dawned on me. Short stature, long brown hair… \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Corey?” I said, slowly stepping back, dread filling the space where peace was just moments ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I was expecting this, but I hoped we would have some time before you noticed.” She sighed deeply, and I saw grief fill her eyes. “I am not the creature you call Corporate. I am Eleanora, the owner and protector of this place. I know of Corporate, of course, but I am not her.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believed her, and that scared me. I thought I was under Corey’s control somehow, so I took out the necklace Sam had given me and put it around my neck, closing my eyes and trying to feel any fog that may have taken over my mind. I felt the necklace lift, and opened my eyes to see Eleanora standing before me, holding the pendant carefully.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“This belongs to Samuel,” she said blatantly, and looked at me with fear. “Where is he? Is he alright?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“He’s fine,” I said, studying her carefully. “He gave this to me when I jumped into the sea of souls. He said it would protect me from…”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe looked up, understanding in her eyes. “I gave this to him many years ago, when he was first brought to my shop. I could feel his fear of that creature, so I led him to my vents and left this for him. It is made from my essence, and it protects whoever is wearing it from her power, at least for some time.” She thumbed the pendant carefully before gently placing it back on my chest, and looked me deep in my eyes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I am not her. I can explain everything to you, as it is clear you have been kept in the dark for far too long. Will you give me this chance?”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hesitated for a moment, but remembered Meredith and Thomas. “I will.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe smiled sadly, and began her story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I started this business as a way to connect myself to humans. I had spent centuries hiding in the shadows and observing, enthralled by their lives. I decided I wanted to be part of it, and opened my small shop to experience them. I have always had a knack for fashion, in my opinion, and decided I wanted to bring this kind of joy to them. It was a great success, and back in those times, any business run by a female form was unheard of, let alone successful. Of course, the war began, and those were dreadful times. I saw millions of deaths, people living in the streets, and my own business began to decline. I didn’t want this to end my time among them, as I knew this war would end, so I did what I had to do to keep my shop alive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“My shop, of course, has always been special, even before I was the inhabitant. She breathed, felt joy and pain, and enjoyed the presence of humans as much as I did. I could feel her energy dying with the lack of customers, and I had to do something drastic to keep her alive. I decided to start catering to a different demographic, one more like myself. These creatures had a desire to live like humans, whether it be to blend in as a predator or experience life through a human perspective. I made a barrier for my shop, creating a wall between the humans and those who may seek to harm them. This shift in business helped for a while, but my building needed human life to survive, and she was starving. So, I did what I needed to do. I found someone to work with me, someone who could entice humans into my shop, just to exist within its walls. Someone who I thought I could trust to take over for me, so I could give my building some of my power. You know her by the name I gave her, Corporate. I thought it was rather humorous, and still do. I gave her control of my work, which was my biggest mistake. I told Corporate everything she needed to know, and let myself anchor to my shop, giving her some of my life force to keep her strong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“This tied me to my building, and she and I became one. I was unable to leave, and any attempt to do so would lead to a shift in realities, bringing the entire building and everyone inside to the world we are in now, my building’s natural habitat. Of course, this world looked much different back then, but it was still a risk to bring unsuspecting humans to this realm. At first, I had no desire to leave my building. I could still interact with humans when they came in, and enjoyed spending all my hours with my shop. But, with Corporate bringing in more clients every day, and the new clientele I was serving, I was beginning to get overwhelmed with the workload. I made all of my garments by hand back then, and demand was too high. Corporate suggested opening a small warehouse, where we could employ humans to make the clothing for humans, and I could focus my work on the clientele with more *particular* taste. I was hesitant, of course, and even though her power doesn’t affect me, she is still a very convincing being, so I conceded. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I was never able to see this warehouse, of course, but I met all the humans who were to work there. I interviewed them, made sure they were some of the good ones, and hired those I trusted with my life’s work. With the human garments off my mind, I was able to expand into more *exotic* fabrics, weaving even the most delicate and tricky materials into beautiful pieces for my other clientele. I was so occupied with my new work, I didn’t notice the shift in Corporate. Her form began to change, slowly. She was once a rather tall, slim, beautiful woman, but she was beginning to form into something horrifying. A true monster, and I don’t use that word lightly. She became angry and testy, her hair lost all color and became matted, and she bore a terrible scowl that seemed to pierce into the souls of those around her. This was beginning to affect her abilities, as her appearance was a big part of her influence, and she was driving customers away instead of bringing them in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“I decided I needed to let her go. I couldn’t risk my shop anymore, and with the war ending, I believed business would begin to pick up on its own. I planned on shutting down my little warehouse, pulling back on my other clientele, and returning my business to how I intended it. When I sat down Corporate and explained this to her, something in her snapped. Her scowl seemed to protrude from her face, and for the first time, I could hear her thoughts in my head. She was powerful in her anger, and was able to do something she never could before: she gained control of me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“She made me lead us to my building’s world, and trapped my essence here. She separated me from my life’s work and my home, and as you know, she stole my physical form. She took my body, my face, and merged it over her appearance, giving her back her ability to control humans, and abandoned me in this place. She took my building back to our reality, and I have been trapped here ever since. This place used to be a safe haven for lost souls; those who were unable to cross over for many different reasons could find refuge in these waters, and within my building’s walls when it returned to rest, until they were ready to move on. Soon after Corporate took control, the souls began pouring in, more than this world could hold. They were different from those who came before; more tortured, pained, and trapped within their sorrow than I had seen before. I was able to speak with a few of the more fortunate ones, who retained their ability to communicate, and learned they were coming from the warehouse. A warehouse I had approved, that I had given Corporate control over, was now turned into a prison for those that fell under her spell. These poor humans were working with the materials I had created, fabric that was never meant to fall into human hands, and were suffering from their lack of guidance and knowledge about them. I spend my time here attempting to bring some peace to them, but it is draining me of what little power I have left. Without my physical form, and my tie to my home broken, I am beginning to fade away. I sense the same is happening to my building as well, since she has begun returning to her world more and more frequently over the years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“This is why I brought you here. I cannot return to my building - Corporate has made sure of it. Any attempt puts Corporate’s voice in my head, draining me of more power and distancing me farther from my home. She has taken my building and myself hostage, and is forcing innocent humans to bleed themselves dry for a company that I created. That I lost. It is my fault, yet I am incapable of fixing it. I hope you believe me, and I pray that you will help me, because I know one thing for sure - Corporate cannot overpower you. You have a strong connection with yourself, and you are now armed with the truth. I can give you all the guidance you need, but in the end, it has to be you who puts an end to this.”\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10f01tb/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_not_all_of_my_clients/)\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10g4sge/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_most_of_the_time_the/)\n\n[Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10h0wyd/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_were_stuck_on_the/)\n\n[Part 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10idlz0/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_corporate_came_for_an/)\n\n[Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10j6j47/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_i_actually_made_my/)\n\n[Part 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10k0nbh/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_i_finally_got_some/)\n\n[Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10lf2zd/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_i_have_a_plan_but_its/)\n\n[Part 8](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10oipwq/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_my_day_off/)\n\n[Part 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10pq5g5/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_i_made_my_coworker_cry/)\n\n[Part 10](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/113y7xs/i_work_at_a_clothing_store_going_for_a_swim/)",

        "text": "Apparently a blonde kid who should be dead and a blue-haired, barefoot merman aren’t very discreet, because we’d only made it a few steps [out of the trees](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11044k6/venom_in_my_veins_the_bar_at_the_edge_of_reality/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and down one of the winding paths before we found our way blocked. And this time it wasn’t just one harbinger; three strangers stood in front of us, all ungloved, forming a pale, deadly wall.\n\nOh, and did I mention that the one in the middle was the same angry guy who’d tried to strangle me? I knew he recognized me, too—his stormy eyes kept alternating between scowling at my face and staring at the handprints he’d left on my neck.\n\nI swear they ached more when he looked at them. Not a fan. \n\nI gave him a little wave. “Thanks for these, by the way,” I said, gesturing to my throat. “Fancy another hug? Maybe this time I could leave *you* with a mark.” I let my hand fall to my belt and rest on Sgrios’ handle. Of course, we both knew it wouldn’t kill him. But it would still be extremely satisfying to make him wince in pain.\n\n“Shut up,” Asher hissed with a side glare. He held out an arm in front of me, blocking the way between us. To the harbingers, he said, “We wouldn’t bring them here if it wasn’t important. We’ll take them straight to our place. No trouble.”\n\n“We’ll be the judge of that,” said the woman to my attacker’s right. She took a step forward, flexing her fingers. \n\nThe bearded man who rounded out the trio also stepped forward, scowling menacingly. “You missed your chance for ‘no trouble’ when you tied Orion to a tree and left him there.”\n\n“After he tried to kill Ian for *no reason,*” argued Asher. “He’s lucky it didn’t work, or I’d have done worse than just tie him to a tree.”\n\nI looked sideways at Asher; he was every bit as threatening as the harbingers facing us. I found myself grateful that he was on *my* team, and also oddly flattered that he’d defend me like that. What he’d said in the forest earlier—about it being weird but nice to have someone on your side when you usually didn’t—was definitely true. I mean, I had Henri and Milo. But it was comforting to know that they weren’t the only two beings in the world who were in my corner.\n\nMy attacker—Orion—was still glaring at me like I’d murdered his family. “I’d like to know *why* it didn’t work. Otherwise, I think I’ll try again, see if his luck holds.” \n\n“None of your business,” said Acacia firmly. “Now, if you’ll excuse us, we have much more important things to do than participate in this dick-measuring contest.”\n\n“Damn,” Milo whispered beside me. I couldn’t help it; I cracked a grin.\n\nWhich was apparently a mistake. You’d have thought I’d flipped Orion the bird instead; he went wild. “You think this is *funny,* vermin?” he snarled. He was marching towards us now, and Asher sidestepped so that he stood between me and Orion, saying nothing but watching him approach with squinted eyes. “I don’t know what you are, but it sure as hell isn’t anything *natural,* and I rather think I’d be doing everyone a favor if I were to wipe you off the face of this earth.” Spit flew from the corners of his mouth at every word. He was *fuming.* \n\nAll this over a smile? A bit of an overreaction in my humble opinion. But hey, I grew up in a bar. I’ve seen plenty of overreactions lead to fights, especially after a few drinks. This wasn’t my first rodeo when it comes to crazy types.\n\nSighing, I gently pushed past Asher, who looked at me in surprise. “I can handle him,” I murmured. Based on his face, Asher clearly did not like this idea, but he didn’t stop me. He just nodded and let me go.\n\n“Ian, be careful,” whispered Milo from behind me. “This isn’t the same as a custody dispute between drunken dwarves.” \n\nYou’d be amazed how common those are. I’m pretty sure I broke up my first such dispute when I was nine. \n\nBut I digress. I nodded in response, continuing forward until Orion and I stood face-to-face, mere inches apart, in the middle of our two groups. He was still breathing heavily, looking like he might snap at any second, and I couldn’t help but notice that his breath smelled awful. Like rotting meat. Nasty.\n\nI made a conscious effort to breathe through my mouth, since I figured gagging right now wouldn’t exactly diffuse the situation. It didn’t help much. *In, out, in, out…*I was so focused on ignoring the smell that I almost missed it when Orion finally spoke again.\n\n“What business do you have here?” he snarled, his voice low enough that only I would hear. “I meant what I said. Our touch is meant to kill any living creature, except another of our kind. And you sure as hell aren’t one of us.”\n\n“It doesn’t matter what I am,” I said just as quietly. Deep breaths. Calm voice. “I’m here to help, and you’re gonna have to trust me on that. You really think I’d come back after *this”* —I pointed to my throat— “if I didn’t have a good reason?”\n\n“You shouldn’t be *alive* after that,” he growled.\n\n“Yeah, I know, we covered that,” I said, an edge of annoyance creeping into my voice. “But I am. And believe it or not, I come in peace. Asher and Acacia are giving us a chance. Why can’t you?”\n\nA long pause as we stared at each other. *In, out…ignore the smell. Oh God, my eyes are watering!* He squinted at me and the world seemed to stand still; for a moment, I almost thought I’d convinced him, and that while he wouldn’t like it, he’d let us go.\n\nUnfortunately, nothing ever seems to work out that well for me.\n\nInstead, he leaned in even closer and whispered directly into my ear. “The two of them have been a plague on this town ever since their father died. Them giving you a chance means nothing to those of us with a shred of pride. You don’t keep good company, boy.”\n\nNow, like I said, I’ve dealt with a lot of drunks. I’ve dealt with my fair share of mean drunks, even. I’ve had to throw more than a few centaurs and humans out of Griffin’s Edge for breaking the rules after getting sloshed. And I like to think I’m a pretty reasonable person. I give them a couple of warnings if they’re getting rowdy. I ask them to leave politely. And it’s only if they give me trouble *after* that point that I call Henri over.\n\nBut I’ve beaten up one visitor myself. Only one, when I was fifteen. It was an elf, some great-great-grandnephew of Lucille’s, and once he’d been drinking for a few hours, he started to say some real unkind things about my uncle. Stuff about how he’d stolen Lucille away from her people, had probably held her captive and used her like a slave, probably had an elf fetish, maybe had killed her himself and made up some story about her murder to cover his tracks. Let’s just say it got ugly fast.\n\nHenri didn’t hear it. I made sure of that. I saw red; after several attempts to get him to shut up—which only made him more persistent—I dragged him to the storage room and punched him until my knuckles bled. He was drunk enough that it wasn’t much of a fight, though I did end up with a black eye that Em helped me cover with makeup for the next week. \n\nI never told Henri about it. I didn’t want to dredge up his past.\n\nThe reason I’m telling *you* is that I’m trying to make a point: I’m not a violent person. Most of my fights are in self-defense, not started by me. But when someone talks horribly about those I care about? Well, that’s my line.\n\nAnd Orion had just crossed it.\n\nI didn’t even think. *You don’t keep good company, boy.* The words had barely left his mouth when I drew back my arm and punched him square in the face. I’d caught him off guard, and the force sent him stumbling backwards, moaning. \n\nAsher gasped behind me. Milo mumbled something that sounded like, “This is that elf all over again.” \n\nThen I didn’t have time to pay attention to their reactions anymore, because Orion regained his balance just as his two buddies also decided they didn’t like me punching him. And suddenly dark blurs shot past me as Acacia and Asher raced forward to meet them.\n\nI honestly didn’t see much of their attacks except flashes of shadow and bursts of flame. I was occupied with Orion, who had a sword glinting on his belt but left it untouched, instead rushing at me in another attempt at physical contact.\n\nIt felt almost like a game of sorts, as if we were playing freeze tag and he was It. He lunged forward; I danced away and swung Sgrios in his direction for good measure; he steadied himself and tried again. After the second time, I gestured at the sword. “Come on, man, just draw the weapon you have *right there.”*\n\nHe grunted and lunged again. To be fair, I barely escaped his outstretched fingertips on that attempt. He was getting closer. “I feel like you’re trying to prove something,” I said, sidestepping and slashing at his back with my knife. Sgrios sliced through his jacket and black blood dripped from the cut, but even as he turned to face me, I glimpsed the beginnings of the wound knitting itself back together. “But your track record isn’t so great with me and the handprints. Personally, I think you should give it up and fight blade-to-blade. Thoughts?”\n\n“I think you should shut your mouth,” he growled.\n\n“Well, I would’ve,” I retorted, “if you hadn’t insulted my friends.”\n\nHe yelled wordlessly and charged at me again. This time, I stood motionless and let his hand close around my wrist.\n\nThis might have been a bold move on my part, considering that I’d passed out last time. But I was done with this pointless dance. Besides, him being that close gave me the perfect opportunity to place my own hand on his chest—and flick open the phoenix lighter I held in my palm.\n\nI’d felt a weird sort of tingling in my wrist when he’d touched it, and my vision seemed to blacken around the edges for a moment, as if walls were closing in around my eyes. But thankfully I stayed conscious, and as soon as I opened the lighter, a massive ball of flames blossomed, engulfing Orion’s entire body. \n\nI felt its heat, felt the embers singe my fingers, winced against the wave of hot air while his angry yell changed to a panicked, painful scream. His hand fell from my wrist as he waved his arms, trying to extinguish the fire, then dropped to the ground, rolling on the dark dirt. \n\nHis friends had stopped fighting, too, and stood in horror as the flames only grew. I honestly didn’t know whether it would kill him—harbingers seemed able to heal from most injuries. I didn’t *want* to kill him. Not really. But I hadn’t known any other way to get him to stop attacking. And now I stood transfixed, entirely forgetting to shut the lighter. \n\nLuckily, Milo had apparently spent the last few minutes finding a water source and is used to my logic failing me in climactic situations. Suddenly, a wave of churning, black water arched through the air and collapsed on top of Orion. The phoenix flames extinguished with a hiss—which jolted me out of my stupor enough to remember to click the lighter shut. Any lingering sparks vanished immediately. \n\nI looked up at Milo in shock as the water pooled next to Orion and then arched back through the air, towards a well at the distant end of the path. I hadn’t noticed it earlier. As the black water retreated back into the well, the glow of Milo’s blue eyes faded. “Got a little carried away there, did we?”\n\n“Sorry,” I said quietly.\n\nMilo came to stand beside me, resting a hand on my shoulder. “What’d he say?” \n\n“Some crap about Asher and Acacia.”\n\nMilo chuckled. “I figured it was something like that. Like we’re fifteen all over again. At least we won’t have to hide a black eye this time—poorly, might I add.”\n\nAsher and Acacia had joined us now, too. I was still motionless, staring at Orion on the ground. Most of his body was a charred mess, though his face was relatively intact. Soot covered his skin and made it difficult to tell just what was ash and what was burnt flesh. “Is he dead?” my words were barely a whisper. The longer I stared, the more guilty I felt. Sure, he’d wanted to kill me. But I probably wasn’t *really* in danger. Not from his hands, at least. I should have had more patience with the guy.\n\nExcept that he’d also insulted my friends. So maybe I’d had just the right amount of patience.\n\nHis two companions, the man and woman, were inching closer. The woman knelt by his body. “Orion?” she murmured.\n\nHe groaned. Asher nudged my shoulder. “He’s alive,” he said quietly. “Look.” I followed his gaze to Orion’s arm, where the black ash was slowly giving way to shining pale skin, so white against the dark that it seemed nearly luminescent. The growth was much slower than for the small knife wounds, but it was there nonetheless. \n\nOrion groaned again. Though his eyes were open, I don’t think he was fully conscious; they were glassy, staring far into the distance. His friends crouched on either side, murmuring quiet words to him.\n\nAcacia wrapped an arm around my shoulders. “He’ll be fine,” she reassured me. “Like a lot of creatures in the dark forest, we’re sensitive to fire. But he wasn’t burning long enough to kill him. Give it a few hours. He’ll heal.”\n\n“More than he deserves, honestly,” muttered Asher. “Stunts like that. Turning on us. Would serve him right if he *had* died.”\n\n“Asher, don’t talk like that,” said Acacia sternly. “We don’t kill unless we have to.” She looked at me sympathetically. “Not that you did anything wrong,” she added. “It was self-defense.”\n\n“Uh…guys?” Milo asked, his voice nervous. “Not to ruin the moment of staring at charcoal slowly turn to skin, but it seems we’ve made a scene.”\n\nSuddenly I noticed the whispers all around us—how long had they been in the background? For the first time in minutes, I raised my head from Orion’s slowly-repairing body.\n\nMilo was right: we *had* made a scene. Several harbingers had emerged from nearby houses and were clustered together, watching us with apprehension in their dark eyes. One little girl pressed her face against her mother’s leg, looking terrified.\n\nAcacia stepped forward, discretely trying to block their view of Orion. “So sorry for anything you witnessed,” she called out, sounding much more confident than I felt. “Orion here started a fight with our guests, and not for the first time.” She gestured to me, and I felt multiple pairs of eyes flick to the handprints on my neck. “He will be fine, and I promise these two have good reason for being here. If you wouldn’t mind not spreading this around Oasis until we get things sorted, that would be much appreciated.” She turned back to me and lowered her voice. “Come on, we’re going home.”\n\nWith a last glance at Orion, Milo scurried after her. He smiled and waved at the harbingers he passed. Asher knelt down and whispered something to Orion and his companions, then grabbed me by the arm and began to pull me away. I still felt kind of dazed, myself.\n\n“They won’t listen,” he muttered as we passed the first few harbingers. “It’ll spread like wildfire around Oasis—sorry, poor choice of words,” he corrected when I flinched. “Don’t feel guilty, Ian. He deserved it.”\n\n“I know,” I said. \n\n“Besides, I’d have done worse if I’d had the chance. Don’t think I missed *that.*” He pointed to my wrist. “He tried to kill you again.”\n\nI looked down at the ashen handprint around my wrist; it almost glimmered in the dim light. It still kind of tingled, like I’d sat on my hand for too long. “Didn’t work, though.”\n\n“*Obviously,*” said Asher, rolling his eyes. \n\nWe’d made it to their house by then; I followed him inside quickly. It looked just the same as it had before, though I suppose I really hadn’t been gone long. Milo spun slowly in a circle, mouth hanging open, as he took in the staircase winding up the tree trunk, dark furniture, and altar. Just as Acacia shut and locked the door behind me, he said, “Wow. It’s…nicer than I expected.”\n\nAcacia laughed. “I swear, all of you think we should live in a cave.” \n\nMilo looked embarrassed. “I hadn’t really given it much thought. But I could totally see Asher living in a cave.”\n\nAsher smirked. “I’d live in a cave. Too bad Acacia vetoed that idea years ago.”\n\nSome of the tension eased as we all laughed. Acacia set down a plate of cookies on the coffee table, then settled into one of the chairs. Milo and I took the couch, while Asher perched—where else?— on its arm.\n\nA pause. Then Acacia said, “Sorry about that. I’m sure it’ll be blown out of proportion by tomorrow. It’s the most exciting piece of gossip they’ve had in ages.”\n\n“You’re not worried about more of them responding to me like Orion did?” I asked. “Or turning against you for helping us?”\n\nShe shrugged. “Even if they do, they won’t follow you out of the dark forests. So they can only do so much. As for turning against us, well…Asher and I weren’t winning any popularity contests around here to begin with.”\n\n“More important things at hand, though,” Asher cut in, as if he knew I’d been about to ask why. “Like how we find the Ancient One.”\n\n“Henri said he some ideas before Sky barged in,” I said. “I wish I could ask him what they were.”\n\nA slow, wicked grin spread over Milo’s face. I squinted at him suspiciously. “Hey, I know that look. That’s your *I taped all the bar’s wine glasses to the roof* look. Don’t ask,” I added to a confused Asher and Acacia. “It took me three hours to get them all down unbroken and clean. What are you up to?”\n\nMilo reached into his pocket and pulled out a folded piece of paper, still grinning so mischievously I was worried his face might break. “I ran back inside from the pool to get Henri once Ian was through the fire,” he said. “Henri wrote something down really fast and handed it to me before he raced outside and attacked Sky. He said it would help us find the Ancient One. Would’ve mentioned it earlier, if we hadn’t spent the last few hours fighting off monsters and crazy people.”\n\nMy heart beat faster as Milo handed the slip to me. I was almost scared to open it, though I can’t say why. Scared that it wouldn’t help and we’d be back at square one with no leads, or scared that it *would* help, because we might have to confront an ancient being and learn the truth about me? \n\nNo idea. Let’s go with the first option, since it makes me sound less insane.\n\n“Open it,” urged Asher. \n\nAcacia leaned in towards her brother. “Later, I’m gonna need an explanation of everything he just said,” she whispered. “You’re not getting away with keeping secrets that easily.”\n\nAsher rolled his eyes. \n\nI turned back to the paper. My palms felt clammy, and the tingling left by the handprint wasn’t helping. Still, taking a deep breath, I unfolded it.\n\nIt was a very hastily-drawn depiction of the area in front of the bar. Henri had drawn a box and labeled it *Griffin’s Edge,* plus drawn the forked path leading out into the fog, with each side labeled as *Human* and *Inhuman.* The two paths leading out into the dimensions. \n\nBut the part that made me pause was drawn between the two branches of the path. There, Henri had drawn an arrow, pointing away from [Griffin's Edge](https://www.griffinsedgebar.com/), out into where the nothingness of endless silver fog would be. Towards the area where there were no gaps in reality, where there was nothing but fog and a practical guarantee that you would get lost and wander aimlessly forever. You *had* to take one of the forks to leave Griffin’s Edge.\n\nAt least, that’s what I’d always *thought.*\n\nAsher and Milo were both leaning over my shoulder to see the drawing. “That’s your uncle’s bar, isn’t it?” said Asher. “What’s in the direction of the arrow?”\n\n“Nothing,” said Milo. “Just fog.”\n\nThe gears were spinning rapidly in my head as thoughts whirled and fell into place. For once, the puzzle seemed to come together on time. “Or maybe that’s where we go to lead us to the Ancient One,” I said slowly, connecting the dots as I spoke. “I mean, think about it! Supposedly it exists at the point where all planes intersect. Where do the two dimensions meet?”\n\n“Griffin’s Edge!” said Milo triumphantly, sounding like he’d had an epiphany. “The boundaries are weakest there! So if anywhere were to get us closer to the Ancient One…”\n\n“It’d be there,” finished Asher. Excitement made his dark eyes sparkle, but a second later his face fell. “One problem: I’ll probably be killed on sight if I go back.”\n\n“We don’t have to go *in* the bar,” argued Milo, rolling his eyes. “We just turn and head straight into the fog. Ian’s an expert at those paths. I can’t tell you how many times we’ve laid out there after nearly dying on a ‘routine errand.’” He sighed nostalgically, winking at me. “Ah, good memories.”\n\nMy excitement was beginning to build, too. Sure, I was still nervous—and okay, yes, scared—but the anticipation of finally getting answers, of stopping brutal deaths, of finding out what I was…well, that was pretty cool. And it kind of overpowered the fear.\n\n“I think it’s our best shot,” I said eagerly.\n\nAsher grinned. “Then I’m in.”\n\n“Me too,” said Acacia. “I’m not letting Asher go alone after the number of times he’s nearly died just in the last day. Someone needs to provide common sense.”\n\n“That *someone* is me,” insisted Milo. “Which means I’m coming too.”\n\nMaybe this should have been a moment where I was all heroic and declared that *No, I’m going alone, I can’t risk all of your lives.* But let’s be real: I’m eighteen, with unstable atoms and questionable fighting skills. Asher, Milo, and Acacia had all already saved my life at least once each. I was about to try to find an ancient being and stop a serial killer.\n\nI could use all the help I could get.\n\nWhich means I didn’t insist on going alone. I smiled and said, “Good. I’d die on my own. I do think we should—”\n\nI didn’t get a chance to finish my thought, because suddenly someone screamed outside, not far from the house. It sounded terrified. Milo looked at Asher in horror. “Is that *normal* here?”\n\n“Absolutely not,” said Acacia. Asher had already sprung off the arm of the couch and was sprinting for the door; we all followed half a step behind.\n\nWe ran down the path towards the place we’d fought Orion; up ahead there was a small cluster of harbingers, gathered around something on the ground. My heart sank. Maybe Orion wasn’t recovering after all?\n\nWe joined the group and I looked down. This time, my heart didn’t just sink; it stopped. Near where Orion had laid, there was now nothing but a pile of ash and bone, still smoldering.\n\nI glanced at Asher in a panic. “I thought you said he’d be fine!”\n\nAsher was also looking horrified; he nodded his head across the pile of ash. “He is. It’s not him.”\n\nI followed his gaze to see Orion, now upright, leaning on his companions from earlier. About half of his skin had grown back, and while he still seemed somewhat dazed, he was okay. Definitely alive.\n\nWhich meant this was someone else. “Then who…?” My voice trailed off as I noticed a scrunched-up ball of purple paper by the ashes. I think I knew what it was before I even reached down to grab and open it.\n\nBut I did it anyway, and found myself proved right: a Griffin’s Edge napkin. \n\nThe same kind that had been left with the murdered human priest.\n\nSuddenly a familiar woman pushed through the knot of observers, screaming at the top of her lungs. She saw the pile of ash and dissolved into tears, throwing herself down onto her knees beside it. \n\n“MY BABY!” she screamed. “I let her play outside for twenty minutes, and someone *murdered* her!” She whipped her head around the crowd frantically, and then her gaze locked on me. Shit.\n\n“YOU!” she screamed, jumping to her feet and marching towards me. “I saw what you did to Orion earlier! What, you thought you didn’t do *enough* with him and wanted to finish the job with a poor, innocent little girl?” I backed up, hands held high in surrender, as she continued to advance. And as I stared at her furious, twisted face, I put it together: this was the mother, the one I’d seen a little girl shoving her face against earlier to hide from the fight scene horrors. And someone—no, not just *someone,* the same murderer who’d been killing across dimensions—had killed her daughter.\n\nAnd, because I’d just torched Orion, *I* was the obvious suspect.\n\n“It wasn’t me!” I insisted, waving the napkin like a surrender flag. “Look, this napkin, it proves that the murderer is the same one that’s been killing both inhumans and humans for weeks! Somehow they knew I was here, or that we’re onto them, and *they* killed her! I’m so sorry for your loss, by the way,” I added in a low voice.\n\nThis did not help the situation. The mother shrieked and lunged for me; Asher pulled me out of the way at the last second. “I think we need to go,” he said. “Buckle up.” \n\nBased on his little smirk, I knew he meant shadow travel, but before I could protest and insist that I’d literally rather let this woman do her worst, the world faded into darkness, air began to rush past us, and my stomach rolled with nausea as shadows shifted and raced—and as we moved with them, off into the dark forests.",

        "text": "**I am the author please reach out to me if you want to reuse this or narrate it (I doubt anyone will but I'm proud of my first foray into horror writing.)\n\n\nIt was late, or so Timothy thought. \n\nHe'd found himself in another drunken stupor. He went outside to light another cigarette and wished the elderly woman down the road a \"good morning\"! \n\nIt was only 4:00 PM.\n\nIt was late for Tim to be in his home alone this late on a weekday. Normally he'd wake up from the sound of the garage door opening, the typical signal his dad was off to work at 6:00 in the morning. Tim woke up the same this day, but it was odd dad wasn't home yet. \n\nThe clock in the back of his house ticked menacingly. He decided to drown it out by going to the fridge and getting another Narragansett. It was cheaper than PBR and tasted just as bad. A few more weeks and he'd be down to Steel Reserve with his, and his dad's saved shiny silver coins.\n\nThere wasn't much in the kitchen but he was hungry. He contemplated making dinner but wasn't sure if dad would be back for the evening. He shot a quick text to him asking if he wanted pasta for dinner. Half an hour passed and no response came.\n\n\"Maybe I'll do delivery again, it's better than getting up,\" Tim thought to himself.\n\nHe fiddled with his phone for a little while and wound up ordering Lamb Saag from a local Indian place, his mouth brimming with anticipation for the garlic naan dipped in the spicy and savory curry. \n\nAfter about fifteen minutes he checked his phone, stomach grumbling for food despite the spoiled ingredients plaguing his kitchen — things he promised he'd cook for himself sometime. Unfortunately, food has a faster expiration date than ideas. So it goes.\n\n\"It's been half an hour, what's taking so goddamn long?\" Tim muttered to himself as he paced the kitchen.\n\nHe checked his phone once again and the delivery app was blinking with a notification.\n\n\"Finally,\" Tim breathed, \"I'm so hungry I could eat a horse.\"\n\nTim opened the app and saw to his dismay that the delivery was cancelled and it was awaiting a new delivery driver.\n\n\"Fuck,\" Tim said under his breath. He considered reopening the app and ordering again, but he didn't want to deal with the hassle.\n\nTim reclined on his aged leather sofa, an antique from grandparents long past who he couldn't even remember the names of. \n\n\"This fucking sucks. Maybe I'll just go pick up Thai.\" \n\nTim felt the alcohol swim in his veins as he stood up from the old sofa. \n\n\"Nah, maybe tomorrow.\" He breathed to himself.\n\nTim nestled himself into the sofa and soon found himself in a blissful and memorable slumber.\n\nHe awoke suddenly to a pounding on his front door. His mind still considering delivery food rousted him from the couch and moved his legs step by step towards the front door.\n\n\"Hey, boss! You had the special, right?\" The delivery man looked imploringly at Tim, swaying on his doorway.\n\n\"Special? I don't think so?\" Tim was confused and felt something strange with the interaction. A chill running up and down his neck.\n\n\"It's all right here, sir! Would you like to call the shop to verify the order?\" The delivery man looked expectantly at Tim, as if expecting him to call for a manager at any moment.\n\n\"No, no. That's fine. I'm sure the special will be fine.\" Tim nodded his head gracefully and hoped the delivery driver would leave his food and go. After all, didn't he opt for contactless delivery? \n\nThe driver smiled a wide and sinister grin.\n\n\"Ah, yes sir, the special. Enjoy your pizza!\"\n\n\"Wait,\" Tim said, \"I didn't order this.\"\n\n\"Well, it has your address, your last four digits from your card, and your name. You're Tim Gantry, right?\" \n\nThe delivery person passed the receipt to you and, sure enough, everything matched up.\n\n\"Yeah, that's me, but I don't remember ordering pizza.\" Tim struggled to get the words out as his inebriated mind was flashing back to when he thought he ordered delivery.\n\n\"No worries sir, if there are any issues just call the number on that receipt and we'll refund you fully! Between you and me, we'll refund you anyway,\" the delivery man said with a wink.\n\nTim signed the receipt and brought the pizza box inside. It smelled honestly delicious. Probably one of the best smelling pizzas he had ever encountered. He opened the box to find it was buffalo chicken flavored. Tim walked over to the cabinet and took out a bottle of Sriracha, \"it just makes it better, I don't know how!\"\n\nTim drizzled the sauce over his three slices on the dinner plate thinking his dad would absolutely love some pizza when he got home. Tim decided to text his dad and let him know he'd taken care of dinner and it was a \"special treat\". \n\n20 minutes passed and Tim had polished off half the pizza. The meat of which was weirdly chewy, more than he'd expected from chicken.\n\n\"Well, it's mass-produced that's probably why\", Tim thought to himself.\n\nRemembering the kitchen was a mess of beer bottles and other detritus, and sure of the fact his dad must be home soon, Tim busied himself by tidying up. Once the counters were wiped and sanitized, all the miscellaneous cups were stowed in the dishwasher, and the pizza box was neatly stored in the fridge, Tim clapped his hands and decided it was time for a cigarette.\n\nTim unbolted the front door and stepped into the cold February air. He took a cigarette from the soft pack in his loose-tobacco-filled pocket, put it between his lips and tried his disposable lighter. The wind was howling that night and so he resorted to pulling up the side of his jacket to shield the flame from the wind. Finally, Tim had that first hit of nicotine in hours. It felt heaven-sent.\n\nTim finished his cig and tossed it into a too-full ashtray and walked inside. The clock read 6:00. Dad should've been home hours ago and this made Tim start to worry deeply.\n\nHe pulled his phone out of his pocket and checked to see if he'd missed a text from his dad in the time it took him to eat an entire pizza and smoke. No new messages, his text didn't even show as \"read\".\n\nTim began to drink more and heavily, thinking that maybe his dad was just over at his girlfriend's house. He really shouldn't bother him, and it's late enough already. These are the words Tim repeated to himself until he fell into an alcohol-induced slumber.\n\nHe awoke with a pounding headache.\n\n\"Fuck. I knew I should have drank more water,\" Tim complained to himself in his head, speaking would've been too bone rattlingly painful.\n\nTim stumbled down into the kitchen and guzzled a small glass of water and downed two aspirin along with it. In spite of the hangover first aid he performed he felt the pounding intensify. Suddenly he realized the pounding wasn't coming from his head, it was coming from the front door.\n\nTim opened the door to find the delivery man from last night, drenched in sweat and wearing another uniform he didn't recognize.\n\n\"Did you like the pizza?\" the delivery driver's lips curled back behind his teeth showing jagged fangs in place of teeth.\n\n\"Uh, I'm sorry what?\" I looked at the driver in genuine fear.\n\n\"Well, I hope you loved it. You should have, after all. I procured the meat myself!\"\n\nThe driver was in my face and backing me into my house now. His feet over the threshold, I looked around for anything I could use to defend myself.\n\n\"What're you looking for? A knife? Like mine?\" He drew a long silvery blade from inside his delivery jacket. It was stained with something that looked brown, maybe black, and kind of chunky.\n\nI shook my head, \"No, no, I'm just wondering what you wanted to tell me about that pizza. I thought it was great! Did I not tip you enough? I'm happy to pay you more, just leave now please.\"\n\n\"Your dad didn't come home last night, did he?\" The driver asked menacingly. \n\n\"No, I figured he was with his girlfriend. Wait, how the fuck do you know that?\" My face was taut and my blood was on fire in my cheeks.\n\n\"Oh, that's easy. I saw him yesterday. Anyway, I hope you liked the pizza. I made it special. The meat was definitely, let's say aged.\"\n\nThe driver walked out the door. Tim fell to his knees realizing the weight of what had just occurred. \n\nTim cried.",

        "author": "Drechenaux",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1155na7/did_you_think_that_you_wouldnt_have_to_worry/",
        "text": "A repeated trope in cartoons I saw back in the day was the quicksand trap- a character would wander into a quicksand pit accidentally and then gradually begin to sink to the bottom, before being rescued. Or something even dumber in retrospect- they would come out the other end of the quicksand like a video game portal.\n\nNeither of those things can happen of course. Quicksand is just sand that's had too much water added to it, meaning that it nearly flows like a liquid. The reality is that quicksand by nature is denser than the human body, as in, it would be impossible for you to sink completely into it. As a matter of fact, because your chest contains your lungs that part would remain buoyant enough so you'd only get waist-deep at most. And it would not be the rapid, within seconds kind you often see in media. \n\nWhy am I telling you this? I mean, after all, while a media trope back in the day, it's not something you'd run into during your everyday life, is it? Why even bother thinking about it?\n\nI thought the same thing. Until that day that is.\n\nI had gone hiking with two friends of mine who I'll call Alice and Jake here. Alice was mainly along with  us because she was dating Jake, and Jake was along with me because we'd always joked about going hiking.\n\nNone of us were really serious about this all though, and 'hiking' to us was wandering into the local woods not far from where we worked.\n\nIt went about as you'd expect- we had fun until the novelty wore off in about an hour. Jake and Alice took some photos for their Instagram while the presence of mosquitos continued to annoy me.\n\nHonestly I wanted to pack up and go home by about lunch, and in hindsight that would've been a great idea. But, I was a bit too proud to say this and we ended up staying into well in the afternoon.\n\nIt was as the sun began to set that we made out way back to where we had parked out cars. And we were almost there when Alice turned her head and stopped suddenly.\n\n\"What is it\" Jake asked.\n\n\"I...I think I heard Lizzie's voice,\" she said.\n\nJake frowned. I realized he had no clue who Lizzie was, but clearly Alice expected him to know. He shot me a pleading look.\n\n\"Uh, sorry, who is Lizzie\" I asked on his behalf. \n\n\"My grandmother,\" she said.\n\n\"That can't be possible though your grandmother's-\" Jake began to say before cutting himself off.\n\nAlice didn't seem to be upset by what he had almost said, instead looking puzzled, probably convincing herself that she had just been hearing things when her head suddenly snapped in the other direction. \n\n\"No,\" she said. \"I heard it again!\"\n\nShe bounded off into a bush without warning. We followed her... until we heard her scream.\n\nThe thing about quicksand is that it can appear just like normal ground at first, but then changes to become more fluid as you apply force to it. The more you struggle, the more you sink in. \n\nAlice hadn't figured that part out yet.\n\nThankfully for her, she hadn't run right into the patch of quicksand, but rather, caught herself in time so that part of her legs were sinking, but part of her was on dry land.\n\nThe problem was that Jake would've nearly ran into the pool face-first (he had a habit of leaping before he looked), nearly guaranteeing his death if I hadn't tackled him in time.\n\nI was rewarded for this by a punch to the face, and then gave one back in return. That seemed to snap him out of it.\n\n\"Help!\" Alice shouted.\n\nIt was almost cartoonish now that I look back at it. Jake grabbed onto her hand and tried pulling her out, to no avail. With the way quicksand works, it really isn't possible to pull yourself- or someone else out. It would be easier to lift a car on your own.\n\n\"Relax,\" I said. \"Listen, Alice, what you need to do is wiggle yourself slightly. Very slowly.\" The slow movements allow water to come back in between your body and the sand, helping you get free.\n\nOf course, this is easier said than done, but Alice finally managed to listen to what I was saying before it was too late.\n\nAnd it was then that I heard it. My uncle's voice- dead ten years ago. Calling from somewhere on the opposite side of the quicksand- I could reach him if only I dived in-\n\nI snapped my thoughts out of the urge to jump and when Alice was finally free, we made a run for it. We didn't look back and all got into Jake's car, leaving mine alone but I went to go pick it up the  next day.\n\nIt was only when we were halfway home did Jake ask, \"Did anyone else see them?\"\n\nNeither of us spoke, though we knew exactly what he was talking about. \n\nYou see, quicksand can still be very deadly. You could end up dying of dehydration if you can't get out in time, or get mauled by a predator... or drowned given that quicksand tends to occur near bodies of water. The place we were in was very close to a pond.\n\nI know what had caused the voices that we had heard. Out on the other side of the quicksand, in the surface of the pond, we saw several things coming out of the water. Heads that looked almost humanoid. \n\nI still remember their eyes- they were a dark glowing green. I have no idea what they were, Skinwalkers or some other kind of water demons or whatever, but we never went near that park again.\n\nNow that I write this down, I guess in all honesty I don't really expect you to believe me. But if you are going to take something away from it- it's how to survive if you fall into quicksand.\n\nThat knowledge just might save your life one day.",

        "author": "Saturdead",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/11555ip/i_forgot_everything_from_archery_class/",
        "text": "”Stance and posture!” Claire instructed. ”Anchor your feet and hook the string with the first joint of your index, middle, and ring finger.”\n\nI’ve loved coming to archery class. I promised myself I’d join a club once we started coming out of covid, and it was one of the best decisions I’ve made. I thought about a cooking class, or martial arts, or team sports, but I finally settled on archery. I’ve always loved the aesthetics of it. The twang of the string, the sharp arrow piercing the air. It’s just cool.\n\n“Would you mind a demonstration?” Claire asked, gesturing at me.\n\n“Not at all.”\n\nI followed the steps, assumed the position, and pulled the bow up to my cheek. My hand was steady and the string rested comfortably in the joints of my fingers. I felt powerful.\n\nI released the arrow. 50 feet passed by in the blink of an eye, slamming into the target on the open field.\n\nApplause.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was no longer just a member of the club, I was an assistant teacher. While Claire was the instructor, she needed a helping hand every now and then. Someone to correct stances and show some grip technique. Someone to help clean, check the equipment, and close up shop on days where she was out of town. As a thanks, I didn’t have to pay any membership fees, and I got free access to the club area. Got my own set of keys and everything.\n\nBut one particular class, there was this one face in the crowd that I didn’t recognize. A bald gaunt-looking man in his early twenties. He had dark, sunken eyes with a blue tint and a thousand-yard stare. Prominent cheek bones, and a crooked nose. Odd looking fellow. He hadn’t said a word, and it’d started to bother the other students. He just kept staring at me.\n\nI walked up to him with a big smile.\n\n“Hey there,” I said. “First time?”\n\n“Yeah,” he nodded. “Sorry.”\n\n“Hey, no worries. Want me to show you the ropes?”\n\n“Okie-dokie,” he smiled. “Thank you. I’m Milo.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI spent the better part of two hours with Milo, showing him the basics. He was by far the strangest student I’d ever met at the club. He barely understood the concept of a bow, and when I asked him what interested him about archery in the first place he just smiled and nodded. I got the impression that he just, sort of… wandered in off the street.\n\nBy the end of the lesson, Claire asked Milo to show her the progress he’d made.\n\n“Okie-dokie,” he nodded.\n\nBut then he did nothing. He just stood there, as if not understanding what was being asked of him. Claire tried to explain, he’d acknowledge it, and then nothing would happen. He’d just stand there, gawking; mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water. Claire just thought he was nervous.\n\nWe called it a night, and I helped Claire pack up; but I knew we’d be seeing Milo again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat night, as I closed up, I decided to send one more arrow down the lane. So I walked up to the line, readied an arrow, and just froze.\n\nMy mind completely blanked. \n\nFor the life of me I couldn’t remember what to do next. I shrugged it off and called it a night. I thought it was just stress. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don’t live the most glamorous life. I live in the small town of Juniper (WV) with my two cats (Jazz and Blues) in a small apartment. Technically three separate rooms, but they’re really small. I work as a line cook at a roadside bistro. Most of my time is spent with my head down, losing myself in my work. It’s not a very exciting life; I work, I get home, watch a movie, and go to sleep. That’s pretty much every day.\n\nBut the archery club? That’s the one place where I get to be someone. I matter.\n\nI’m good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next class, I felt off my game. My scores were down, and I fumbled the string a couple of times. I couldn’t get the stance right, or the release, or the breathing. Meanwhile, Milo was standing right behind me, looking over my shoulder that entire time. It was uncomfortable, but I didn’t say anything. After messing up two more shots, I got frustrated. I turned to Milo, who just kept smiling.\n\n“I’m having an off day,” I groaned. “Gimme a minute.”\n\n“Okie-dokie!”\n\nI just couldn’t get it right. Finally, I snagged my fingertips on a bad release, getting a nasty cut on my index finger. Milo just stood there with a big grin on his face. Claire rushed over.\n\n“That’s enough of that,” said Claire, pulling me out of line. “Get that fixed.”\n\nI walked off to bandage my finger. By the time I got back, Milo was gone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter class, I was frustrated. Not only did I keep messing up, but this creepy newbie was throwing me off my game. Archery class was *my* thing, and it felt like I was losing something important. I just couldn’t get it right, like my body had forgotten hundreds of hours of practice.\n\nI sat in my car with my hands resting on the steering wheel. I was lost in thought. I couldn’t even picture it in my mind, it was just… gone. All those little movements that usually come on their own. The tactile memory you build with experience. I had none of it.\n\nIt took me a few minutes to notice that there was a shadow across my dashboard. As soon as I noticed it, there was a knock on the window. And then, an eerie smile.\n\nMilo.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Hey,” he grinned. “You still here?”\n\n“Yeah,” I sighed. “Rough day.”\n\n“I could tell. Are you okay?”\n\n“I’m sure it’ll pass.”\n\n“Okie-dokie!”\n\nThe words were friendly, but there was a sinister note to it. Like a mean child holding a fragile toy. I couldn’t help but feel a sense of malice coming from him, pulsing out from behind his thinly veiled smile.\n\n“I gotta go. Take care, Milo.”\n\nJust silence, and a smile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI turned my attention back to my car. I’d forgotten where I put my keys. When I finally found them (in my pocket), I couldn’t put them in. I kept doing it wrong and dropping them. When I finally put the keys in right, I felt lost. It took me minutes just to mentally go through the steps necessary to start the car and reverse out of the parking lot. I had to stop for a while.\n\nI stepped out of the car and took a deep breath. I felt like I was losing my mind or getting sick. The things I usually did as a reflex were just gone from my mind. Getting back home went from routine to something I had to plan out and take step by step. Once I got back in my car, I kept messing up the transmission. The car stalled several times, and what was supposed to be a 10 minute ride took over an hour.\n\nIt was ridiculous. Even Jazz and Blues were skeptical once I got back home. Jazz kept pacing around me, as if trying to tell me something. Blues just hid under the couch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started noticing these lapses more and more over the next few days. I had to stop taking the car to work. I kept forgetting to do basic things, and I was completely out of rhythm with the other line cooks. I had to concentrate hard and ask for help to be reminded of the most basic routines. I had to step out of line for the lunch serving because I kept overcooking the trout.\n\nIt felt like I was missing something. Like parts of what made me into me were absent. Little puzzle pieces in the back of my mind that I take for granted. I thought I was getting sick.\n\nThe next day, I went to the doctor. I was tested and scanned thoroughly, but I got a clean bill of health. They figured it might be a stress related problem, and my physician was adamant about me taking notes and following a breathing exercise. Whatever this was, it wasn’t physical.\n\nThat night, as I cuddled up with Jazz and Blues in my bed, I heard a noise. It was near, but I couldn’t put my finger on what it was. I looked around but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Jazz didn’t like it though. He’d definitely noticed something and curled up next to me, making angry cat noises. I got this pit in my stomach, telling me something was wrong. I tried my best to ignore it, but I slept a dreamless, restless sleep that night. A sense of dread came over me, and just wouldn’t leave.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got worse. I had to stop cooking because I would forget that I put the stove on. I would start getting surprised at things in my own apartment, because I kept forgetting the decorations and placement of furniture. At times I would look up and just get this sinking feeling in my stomach, like I didn’t know where I was despite standing in my own home.\n\nI started not to trust myself with the most basic things. Leaving the fridge open, leaving the door unlocked, feeding the cats despite their bowls were already full. I was clearly having some sort of breakdown.\n\nAnd all the while, Jazz stayed at my side. He could tell something was wrong, and he wasn’t about to let me think this was normal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had to call in sick for work, and I didn’t know what to do. I could ask for a second opinion from a doctor, but at that point I was so unsure of myself that I figured I must’ve already asked for help. Surely I wouldn’t just do nothing. Maybe I had called them twelve times that day already, there was no way to tell. How would I even trust myself around medication?\n\nAnd every night, I’d get that same sinking feeling; and Jazz would pace back and forth, making angry cat noises.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne day I got a visit from Claire. She came by with some sponge cake to see how I was doing. We had a cup of tea, and I told her all about my experience. For a brief moment, everything was perfectly clear. I didn’t forget anything, and I could keep a conversation going without repeating myself. To an outsider, I might’ve seemed lucid.\n\nWe had a talk about my condition, and she was eager to help. We talked about stress, therapy, and all kinds of treatment. She has always been a good listener, and she didn’t mind hearing me vent my many worries.\n\nBut eventually, Claire had to go. As she did, she turned back to me and sighed.\n\n“You take care now, okay?” she sighed. “Bye now. And bye Milo.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe door closed. The dread crept back up my spine; the same thing I felt at night. Jazz yowled and hissed.\n\nAnd hand came up from behind me, leaning past me. A gaunt, shaking hand. It turned the door lock and disappeared back behind me. I heard a careful footstep come closer, with a leg that shook so violently that it tapped against the floor.\n\n“It’ll be okie-dokie,” a wet whisper spoke. “I’ll make you forget about this, too.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI turned around, and there was nothing there.\n\nOr maybe something had been there, but I had forgotten it. Or maybe it’d moved, and I didn’t remember it. Or maybe I was looking straight at it but didn’t know what it looked like.\n\nMy focus turned into a pin as my heart started racing. I wasn’t alone. There was someone there, and they were doing something. What was happening to me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“Milo,” I mumbled to myself. “He’s here?”\n\nI tried to focus on my memory of him. The gaunt face. The dark eyes. I focused on the details in my mind, closed my eyes, and looked closely.\n\n*He was standing right in front of me.*\n\nHe lunged at me, but I pushed him away. We both fell backwards, but the moment I hit the floor he was gone. I’d forgotten him, and what he looked like. For a moment, I could barely remember my own name.\n\n“Get out!” I cried out. “What do you want?!”\n\nI blinked, and furniture had moved. Time had passed. Not much, but some. I got up and hurried into the kitchen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJazz was standing on the couch, yowling. When he suddenly hissed, I backed away.\n\nSuddenly, there was a burn across my right arm. A gash, and warm blood. The pain came seconds later. For a moment, I forgot about it, but it immediately came back with the next heartbeat. I was in a fight, and I couldn’t even register it. It was happening; right now.\n\nI tried to remember what he looked like. I focused on his face, but all I caught was brief flashes. Furniture would move, and I would suddenly be inside a different room.\n\nI was running, and I kept forgetting about it, over, and over, and over.\n\nThe bedroom. The living room. The kitchen. I was fumbling my way through the apartment, trying to get away, and I couldn’t even understand what was happening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I was running, something was chasing me. Something was coming for me. I got more cuts across my arm, and one across my back. A stray thought entered and left my mind in an instant. There was something in my hand. Car keys?\n\nI was bleeding. Whatever I was doing, it wasn’t working. I had to try something. I couldn’t focus long enough to understand what I was holding in my hand, but I had to use it. So I pushed forward, dead set on finding and using a weapon. Bits and pieces of a hallway, an open sky, and excited panting coming up behind me.\n\nLittle flashes in my mind. Find a weapon. Find a weapon. Find a weapon.\n\nI concentrated on the joints of my index, middle, and ring finger.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuddenly, Milo appeared in front of me - with an arrow sticking out of his stomach.\n\nI had unknowingly gotten my bow from my car and shot him with it. He stopped, and the fog lifted from my mind. His face looked more elongated; his jaw swinging from side to side. His skin a sickly pallor. I already had a second arrow ready. I blinked, and he was gone; leaving a blood trail that lead into the woods. A flock of red birds took flight as something spooked them.\n\nI just stood there, panting. My mind was clear, and my hand wasn’t shaking.\n\nI got this. This is what I do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTracing my steps back, it had been an awful fight. We’d been going room to room. There was broken and sliced furniture, smashed vases, paintings had dropped from the walls. Piece by piece, it all started coming back to me.\n\nMilo didn’t come back, however. I haven’t heard Jazz yowling and warning me like that again. But knowing that something can just… be here, with me, and me not even knowing it? That’s uncomfortable. It still gives me the shakes.\n\nHadn’t it been for Claire, I don’t know what Milo would have done. Thinking back on it, it felt like he was draining me; eating my identity and memories. Like he was trying to become me and take my place. Claire had just said “Bye Milo” in the heat of the moment, without putting any kind of weight or thought behind it. She’d just said what she saw, and if she hadn’t, the thought of looking for him wouldn’t have crossed my mind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut it’s over. He’s gone. I’m safe.

        "text": "It was about time, I had been waiting to truly party and let loose for the whole semester. The last class of the day finally let out, and throngs of college students pushed their way through the campus halls. Now, I'm not the most popular or wealthiest of students, but I was included in most activities. That being said, I was invited to a large get-together happening at one of the senior classmen's beach houses. \n\nReady to put mountains of books and thoughts of exams to the curb, I quickly rushed home to prepare for a night of intense irresponsibility. After receiving location details from a friend, I was shocked to find out that the house was only four or five blocks away near the beachfront. Thinking it would be perfect so I wouldn't have to drink and drive if I wanted to leave after spending a few hours choosing the right outfit and getting cleaned up, it was just about time to head on over. \n\nNot even two blocks away, I could already hear the music resonating and the cheers in the distance. It would seem my entire college had been invited to this one party.\nAfter having some difficulty finding a parking space, I managed to find one only a few houses down. When I arrived, the party was in full swing, and the sun hadn't even set yet. \n\nAlcohol and swimsuits were a very common sight, basically, if you ever thought about the stereotypical college party, this was it. It wasn't long after the sun had set that I was already intoxicated. The laughs, the music, the women, this was truly the place to be for spring break. The sand on the beach was warm between my toes, and the light from the bonfire reflected upon the water in a brilliant display of colors. \n\nFeeling the call of nature, I figured that the bathroom had a pretty lengthy line. So, with some drunken reasoning, I chose to stumble a few yards from the party and do my business. \n\nAs I stood there, my eyes scanned the darkened scenery: the beach and the ocean to the right, the dark houses on the street to the left. That's when something strange caught my eye. Now, maybe it was the alcohol, or perhaps it was the poor lighting, but I could have sworn I saw a person standing near one of the houses. Even if it was someone standing by a house, it shouldn't have drawn my attention like it did. \n\nI suppose the reason it was so captivating was the fact that the silhouette didn't move. I had long since finished my business but found myself intently watching this person, waiting for the slightest movement. It wasn't until a friend of mine called out to me that I turned away for a brief second. When I turned back, the silhouette had vanished. \n\nPushing it off as a trick of the mind, I staggered back to the party. The night was drawing to a close, and without wanting to sleep on the beach due to multiple people crashing in the house, I chose to head on home. Saying goodbye to a few friends at the party and receiving quite a bit of playful ridicule, I walked out to the street.\n\nJust as I started walking, I quickly noticed the house where I had previously seen the silhouette. Keeping my eyes on the dark house as I passed by, nothing about it seemed out of the ordinary. As I reached the end of the block, I looked back at the party one last time. Between myself and the party, standing in the middle of the street, was that same silhouette. \n\nTrying to act as though I hadn't seen anything, I picked up my pace and pushed onward to my house. I couldn't help but feel as though whoever it was that was following me was closing the distance. Feeling eyes on the back of my head I dashed through the second and third Street, after catching my breath, I finally saw my house in the distance. \n\nA wave of relief washed over me as I walked up to the front door, fumbling for my keys. I checked my surroundings once more, but everything seemed ordinary, and I entered my house. I took off my clothes and collapsed onto my bed, quickly falling asleep.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up feeling hungover and groggy, stumbling into the kitchen to make some coffee. As I stood there, trying to wake up, my eyes caught sight of a piece of paper on the table. \n\nThe paper read: \"My place was boring your house looks much nicer”\n\nA chill ran down my spine as the unsettling realization came to my mind that whoever or whatever this was, that followed me home, was now inside of my house.",

        "text": "I laid back and closed my eyes. *Yep, another weekend started right.* I opened them again when I heard the loudspeaker come on.\n\n**\"Now coming to the floor, you know her name and you see her face everywhere, awake and in your dreams...\"**\n\nI hear the clack of platform heels on the linoleum approaching the pole. I leaned closer, checking my watch. It was 8:30 P.M. It was *her* time. Three purple spotlights surrounded the pole; one directly overhead, and the other two on either side of it.\n\n**\"Scarlett Widow!\"**\n\nThe entire room around me went into an uproar, briefly drowning out the music. The click of heels were right on top of us now, and the perfectly slender waist of Scarlet Widow came into view, bathed in radiant velvet LED. She looked out at the crowd, face chiseled in a cold, stoic sort of expression. You know the type; the dead in their concern, \"fuck life and the horse it rode in on\" look. The look that let each and every rock hard drool monkey in the room know that *she* was now in control, and that they better behave themselves, and that they'd be thinking of her *long* after she got off the pole. In a word, the \"Bad-bitch\" face.\n\nThe music kicked in, some techno-cyberpunk themed shit, and for the first ten seconds, she just stood there, gripping the top of the pole, still gazing forward with doll's eyes, before quickly going full vertical by throwing her gorgeous legs up and around the top of the pole. From there, she did this graceful sort of upside down ballerina twirl, sliding down the pole. The entire way down, time seemed to slow down, drawing out every second as she descended, piercing everyone with her cold stare.\n\nLike everyone else there, when her eyes met mine, I came two seconds from losing my damn mind. Here's the thing about this place, *\"The queen's lounge\"* , down here in Charlotte; it may be the most expensive club in town, but you bet your bottom dollar it's worth every penny and more. The girls are the best I've ever seen around; perfect top to bottom ratio -- not too big on top or bottom, but just enough to be fun, you know what I mean? All of them could've been contenders for cover models for *Maxim* or *Cosmopolitan*, but NONE of them held a candle to the genetic paragon of fucking beauty like Scarlet was.\n\nShe had looks that would've made an old man get hard again, coupled with her powerful glare. Her movements were like if you made a seasoned ballerina get on the pole; graceful and sleek, fluid, and artistic in a way. Watching her under the lights was like watching paint bleed onto a canvass to just run freely. Every guy that ever went there on a Friday night would always try to tip extra at the bar, claiming it as a \"Complimentary drink\" to Scarlet. Most of the time it was to convince her to get them in on a private session in the back room, usually getting thrown out of the club before five minutes was even over because they couldn't keep their pants on and their hands off. It's always funny as hell, too, because they'd come running out of the back, white faced and wide eyed like they were being chased by a lunatic, talking about \"I gotta get outta here, there's some fucked up shit in there, man! I'm finally free!\"\n\nLet me clarify something real quick. I said *every* guy did this shit, but I should've specified something, every guy did this shit *except* me. Now, obviously, you'd probably think, \"But Eddie, why the hell haven't you taken your shot, man? What, you ain't got no game or somethin'?\" Well, to start, I'll say don't you worry about \"game\", buddy. Trust me, I had game -- ask my wife, plus her three friends. And second, while me and her *are* in an open relationship, that doesn't mean I'm always gonna go and pork every nice piece I come across. I went to the *Queen's lounge* to have a little fun, sure, but more times than not, I was just there to look, fantasize, have a couple drinks and then go home and have my own fun with my old lady.\n\nThis Friday night was a different story, though. I wasn't sure why, but I'd decided that night that I was gonna take a shot with it, see if maybe I could be the first to actually get lucky with her and \"tame the beast\" so to speak. That I think about it, I'd probably just had a little more to drink than I should've when I had the idea; and so again, it was nothin' I was necessarily gonna lose sleep over if it went haywire. If nothing else, though, I'd probably get at least a funny story out of it. Well, wish *half* granted. I got a story out of it, but I'm not sure it's something I'd call \"funny\".\n\nAnyway, so she puts on her little show for us before the lights and music die away and the next dancer is called to the stage. This was also the point where \"Happy hour\" was called, when all drink tabs were ignored and you could hit up the bar as much as you wanted for an hour, and where you left the payment for the aforementioned private sessions with any of the previous dancers. Another reason I had this idea, also, was the fact that I'd just recently gotten a raise at work, and this was the first check with that increase -- and a beefy fuckin' increase it was, too -- so naturally, I thought I'd have a night to splurge a bit.\n\nAfter raiding the place dry of their stash of *Guiness*, I decided to take my shot, slamming two hundred dollar bills on the bar. Phil, the junkie dropout from high school-turned-bartender, raised his eyebrows at me. I raised my right one back at him.  his eyes glanced back and forth between me and the bills on the table, a small smirk splitting the right corner of his mouth. He knew what was going on, and he was probably thinking the exact same thing I was, *\"Jesus Christ, the boy's actually about to take the plunge.\"*\n\n\"How long?\" he asked. I shrugged, chuckling.\n\n\"Eh, till either I come out screaming \"Sweet Jesus\" or \"Oh SHIT!\" He and I both laughed at that.\n\n\"She ain't easy, brother, I'll tell you that much.\" I downed another swallow.\n\n\"Well yeah, what fun would it be if she were?\" This provoked a blurted, donkey laugh from him while I finished my last swallow and slammed the glass face down on the bar, indicating I had enough in me to pull of this little stunt without any more liquid courage. He took up the glass and told me that he'd page Scarlet Widow and to wait at the bar before running off to the back.\n\nI sat for about another twenty seconds before I heard the clacking of platform heels coming straight for me. I looked over to my right and there she was, standing tall and dominant, staring down at me. Now, despite what I'd just said about not needing any more to drink before pulling this little stunt off, I found myself almost wishing I could throw another shot or two back. Regardless, I stood up and she said, in a surprisingly lower pitched voice than what I was expecting, \"Are you ready?\"\n\nClearing my throat, I replied, \"Um, yeah, shit, let's go.\" She held out her hand, locking her eyes onto mine, trapping me in her grip of cold dominance. I knew that as soon as the door to the champagne room closed, *she'd* be taking charge of the situation. *Well, I did say I wanted the challenge.* I said to myself while simultaneously praying to God I can still walk out from this without having my ass handed to me by her as we walked down the hall to the champagne room. \"Right this way.\" she said, turning to the right in the dark.\n\nAt first I was confused. Either because of how dark the hallway was or because there was no sort of sign or doorknob to mark the doorway, I couldn't help but stand there, wondering what the hell she was talking about. Suddenly, though, I watched her push against the wall and from it came this violet glow that painted itself throughout half the hallway. She looked expectantly at me again before stepping into the room. I closed my eyes and drew a deep breath. *Come on man, you can do this...*\n\nI slowly approached the light in the doorway. Before I was even able to reach the door itself, an intense wave of heat passed through me. It wasn't a sort of heat like you'd feel from the sun, per say, but maybe like what you'd feel coming from an oven, if that makes any sense. It was controlled, dry, artificial in a way, at least the way I felt it. It was strangely soothing, if not a bit ticklish.\n\n\"Come on, darling.\" said Scarlet. \"It's much more comfortable from deeper inside.\" Looking inside the room from the doorway, I found her on her haunches like a lion about to pounce on me across a queen size mattress with the most beautiful, expensive looking, and most comfortable looking red silk sheets and quilt I'd ever seen. I was mesmerized by the room, unable to even fully take in everything I was seeing, despite it overall being an average sized room.\n\nShe raised up on the bed, her eyes still fixed to mine, and began running her hands seductively over her body. \"Don't be nervous, sweetheart.\" This was when I noticed that her voice had this weird sort of buzz to it, a sort of hypnotic droning to it; one that started making me feel sleepy for some reason. I heard her chuckle amusedly, the way a parent does when their child gets stage fright. \"Come on, I thought you wanted a challenge...\"\n\nShe began kneading her breasts through the tight hot pink leather suit she was wearing, letting her tongue hang out a bit, twitching fervently to draw me closer. My foot stepped forward of its own will, completely unaware to the rest of me. The other then followed. I was at least 5 or 6 steps in the room before I realized I was actually approaching the bed. The door shut behind me. Scarlet continued swiveling her hips on the bed, curling her finger at me.\n\nIn another two seconds that felt like they'd passed even quicker, as in microseconds, I found myself at the edge of the bed. For the first time I'd ever seen, a small smirk parted the right corner of her mouth before she leaned forward, almost touching noses with me. My heart froze in my chest, my hair stood erect, and my body went completely numb. Her slim index finger touched the bottom of my lip and she spoke again, this time her voice being almost unrecognizably distorted.\n\n*\"You want me baby?\"*\n\nHer finger slowly slid down from my lip and down the front of my chest. The overpowering warmth from the room focused itself directly in the center of my chest. Then her hand slid down further, the warmth spreading with it as it went.\n\n*\"Will you beg me?\"*\n\nIn the upper edge of my vision, I watched her other hand reach up and begin unzipping her suit. Bit by bit, the zipper parted, exposing more and more of her heavenly, milky white cleavage. My eyes remained choked by hers. About midway down her suit, she stopped and pinched the upper right corner, tugging at it, teasing me into thinking she'd reveal her bare naked breast. Her tongue came out again, making a licking motion at me.\n\n*\"Beg me like a little puppy?\"*\n\nShe gasped in ecstasy.\n\n*\"I wanna hear you squeal for me, big boy. Will you do that for me? Will you squeal like a good boy?\"*\n\nWarmth spread all throughout my body now. I couldn't properly breathe, with my lungs feeling like a red hot metal vice was clamping them together. Her other hand snaked down from my stomach and down to my legs. Immediately, I felt something akin to hot coals being pressed against my crotch the second her hand reached my hips. *What the fuck is this? Why does it burn so much?*\n\n*\"You feel that, baby?\"*\n\nthe back of her hand gently touched my thigh, causing the burning to worsen. I heard her chuckle, seeing me wince.\n\n*\"What's the matter? Can't take the heat I see in your eyes?\"*\n\nMy body was on fire now. Her hand hovered over my crotch. From the bottom edge of my vision, I watched her hand move in this weird, snake-ish motion, like she was bending some sort of energy from it. I say that because I noticed as she did this, the heat started flaring tremendously from my crotch. She was essentially setting them on fire, only without any flames to speak of. Yet.\n\n*\"Is it too much, baby? Can't take it?\"*\n\nShe laughed again. She rolled out her tongue again to lick my lips teasingly.\n\n*\"Your skin tastes so good. So moist and tender...\"* \n\nShe moaned softly. Just then, a feeling as though she were reaching down my throat and pulling something out of me had me gasping for air. Imagine how it'd feel to have your intestinal tract get pulled from your throat like party ribbons, then imagine that once it's forced all they way from your throat, there's no intestines, just a large white cloud or mist. What the hell it was or how it came out of me were things I couldn't hope to answer until she said what she did two seconds later.\n\n*\"God, I can't wait to taste your soul.\"*\n\nMy heart went haywire after that. She threw her head back, opening her mouth, before making this weird sort of screeching or howling sound; one similar to the way a rushing wind might sound like, that sucked the white mist into her mouth, devouring it. That was when everything went dark. \n\nEverything around me was pitch black, though not entirely the way you're thinking here. Imagine a color somehow even darker than the color black. \"Blacker-black\", if that could ever be a thing. Maybe I should put it like this, imagine that darkness itself somehow had a digestive system and was slowly, painfully -- excruciatingly so -- crushing and breaking you down. That's what this was. The darkness was eating me.\n\nWhile this happened, I felt heat flare up from beneath me. *What is this, where am I? Am I dead, where--*\n\nThe heat transformed then into searing pain. It's difficult for me to describe the pain, as it wasn't so much a physical pain, if that makes any sense. It was almost spiritual. It was as if my soul was... was...\n\n*Oh God, my soul is being digested! I'm in her fucking stomach!* Looking downward, I saw that while I kept the overall *shape* of my body, I was no longer actually *in* my body. Everything on me was a wispy, cloudy mist like aura, floating in a black sea of absolute nothing. I reached out to grab onto... well, I guess nothing, but when I did, my hand was immediately scorched. \n\nI looked upward to see a shining light, bright and blinding. Figuring it for the exit, I started jumping and reaching up for it, only for it to do me absolutely no good. Funny enough, though, just a second or two after I'd given this up, I found myself getting forced upward toward it. Equally ironic was the fact that as this happened, I was fighting like hell to keep myself anchored. Regardless, though, I found myself in the light. \n\nI looked out and found that I was looking at myself. In front of me, standing up from having apparently fallen, I stared right back into my own eyes, except no, they *weren't* mine anymore. It was my face, my body, but it wasn't me anymore. \"I\" had a look on my face of utter shock. A look of relief, in a twisted sort of way. \"I-I...\" he stuttered, \"I'm free! I'm finally fucking free!\" He began cackling before running out of the champagne room. \n\nI -- the *actual* me, I guess -- remained on the bed. I wanted to go out after him; see what the hell was going on, why the hell he was in *my* body, and what happened to me, but whenever I tried to move my arms, nothing budged. I was a statue, staring into the empty champagne room as two of the bouncers walked in and looked at me. Even if I had control of my limbs in that moment, I was so shocked, confused, afraid, and just plain scrambled at that point that I likely wouldn't have moved anyway.\n\nImagine then how much *more* my heart was thrown into high gear when I watched the two men's eyes start glowing a bright shade of dark red. One of them opened their mouth and said in an impossibly deep, echoing voice that also had a buzz in it similar to Scarlett, \"So, you let another one out, huh?\"\n\nFrom my mouth, though not through my control or with my voice, I replied, \"What can I say?\" The right arm then raised and rubbed her stomach. \"This one is so much more delicious.\" \n\nThe other bouncer then said in a deep voice, \"You realize the more you do this, the more you risk word of us getting to the outside world.\"\n\n\"He's right. You have *got* to be more careful.\"\n\nA giggle came from me before saying, \"You guys *always* worry too much. You know I can just make sure their mushy little minds don't remember a thing after a night with me back at home.\" A snicker, and then, \"After all, you always say it yourselves, they see me, awake or asleep.\"\n\nThe two men, one of which I actually recognized to be the bartender, both rolled their eyes before turning and leaving the room, leaving me... *us,* I guess, alone. I tried screaming out, but it was no use. This body wasn't mine, therefore it wouldn't answer to me. I was simply trapped, her little belly slave, trapped forever to never be digested, but instead tormented, until she'd let me out in favor of someone else. Obviously, I'm not even going to try guessing how long I was forced to stay like this, but suffice to say, I was in there for a good while. Long enough where I can safely empathize with Jonah in the fish's stomach.\n\nActually, no, I think I can safely say that I had it *worse* than Jonah. At least with him, sure it smelled like rancid carcasses and every different type of shit imaginable, but at least that's *all.* He didn't have to experience that, plus constantly writhing in unimaginable searing pain from flames that weren't even there, plus get tormented by the voice of his captor, reminding him what a pathetic excuse for an act of creation he is, PLUS not be able to move his own goddamn body! And to top it all off, he only had to spend *3 days*! Again, don't know how long exactly I was trapped, but it sure as hell was longer than 3 fuckin' days. \n\nWell anyway, finally, I guess I *was* boring her out because one day I remember watching her as she led another poor horny bastard just like me into the back room. This dude, young and obviously athletic, was eager for Scarlett. Part of me, despite knowing that I was about to be free at last, couldn't help but feel bad for the guy, knowing what was about to happen to him. *Poor, poor moron...*\n\nTo make a long story short here, the process for him was more or less the same as it was for me before -- if only the fact that it took even *less* time for his soul to get snatched from his body than it did me. As for me, well, like last time, one moment, I'm watching this guy's body fall to the floor while his soul gets snatched from his body, and the next, I'm seeing absolutely nothing until a second or two later when I'm once again looking at Scarlett Widow on the bed with her head thrown back. \n\nI looked at my hands, the hands that *were* someone else's only twenty seconds ago, before attempting to move my legs. They were stiff at first, wobbly and crooked, but soon I managed to work my way back to my feet before stepping backward. I was out. I was free.\n\nI turned and stumbled away as frantically as I could out of the champagne room and out of the club altogether. I wasn't a screaming, raving lunatic about it (even if I w*asn't* too far from having the mind of one), as my mind was now just far too entangled with questions -- least of all, funny enough, having to do with how to get my body back or even if I could. I was more concerned now with what the hell those things were, why they were doing this, and how to warn anyone else from falling into her little trap. \n\nThat brings me here. I'm reaching out, both to ask if anyone here knows anything about who or what Scarlett Widow *really* is, and/or if it's possible and how to reverse what she's done to me and God only knows how many others. That, and to warn others to stay away from *The Queen's lounge* while I still can. See, thing is, she wasn't kidding when she said that I'd see her in my dreams, and that she'd slowly strip me of my memory. I'm starting to forget more and more of who I even am, or maybe *was*, as a person before. What I've told here is about all I have left as far as my memory goes. I'm almost willing to bet money, though, that after tonight, I won't even have this much to remember...",
