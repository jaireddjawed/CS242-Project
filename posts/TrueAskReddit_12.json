        "text": "I can't figure out a good place to post this sort of question, but I've noticed numerous times amongst myself, and friends, and family that when we're watching a foreign language film or overhearing a conversation, when said language momentarily switches to English, we don't tend to immediately recognize it. I thought it was just me, but I've noticed it during traveling or when watching movies. The best example seems to be a Korean film that I've shared over and over again with friends and acquaintances. Nearly 3/4 of the way through the movie there are like 4 sentences in English. Without a doubt, everyone I've watched with usually exclaims, \"I didn't even recognize it was in English!\" It's not mumbled or unintelligible or spoken with a thick accent, but every time that scene comes up, it's the same response.\n\nWhy does it take us a while to recognize we're hearing English? Is our brain just ignoring the words because it doesn't recognize the foreign language? Could it simply be shut off to it?\n\nIf I'm posting in the wrong place, let me know where else this might be acceptable, if you could.\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for all these awesome answers, I'd like to reply to each, but I don't think I can add much that would be different for each, but the answers are fantastic and varied, really helped me see some of the reasons and also how the experience can be different for multi-lingual individuals.",
