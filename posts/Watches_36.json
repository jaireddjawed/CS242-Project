        "text": " I was recently on a trip to the big sports car manufacturer in Stuttgart and had the time to go by the Stowa HQ. Picked up this lovely Flieger that has been on my list for ages.\n\nI emailed them beforehand to get an appointment and also informed them that I would like this model. The said it has a waiting time of six weeks. That didn’t stop me as I really wanted to see the watches in person.\n\nArriving there the service was great and I chatted with the team for about an hour.\n\nI said: I will take one. The sales rep went to the back and surprised me with the exact model I requested. He said that they still had one “lying around”, but I am 99% sure they built this after my email haha  \nIf you ever visit, you can get really close to the watchmakers, it's great!\n\nHe also didn’t charge extra for the hand wound movement, so technically I got a 20€ discount.\n\nAnyways, here are some specs:\n\nHandwound Sellita SW215-1 Top Grade (First Non-Automatic, feels great!)\n\nNo Date\n\n40mm case\n\n49mm Lug to Lug\n\n20mm Lug width\n\n10,2mm thin (one of the factors of why I went with the hand wound)\n\nMade in Germany :)\n\nI would be glad if you can give me some strap recommendations for this watch that would also work great with my Sinn 556i Black MoP. I saw a Flieger Klassik 36 on a green suede today, might try that…\n\nI also added a movement shot and some pictures I took at their location.\n\nCheers!",

Currently looking at the Tudor black bay gmt and grand seiko spring drive gmt. But I’m wanting to know what people think are the best men’s watch’s out there in that price range. I’m not stuck on gmt but they do seem to have caught my eye.

        "text": "I find it interesting to see what kinds of watches make other people *tick* \n\nI am relatively new to the watch enthusiast world (started getting interested about a year ago).  I find it interesting that while I find a strong appeal in enthusiast/luxury watches, I find that I dislike the vast majority of them, and often wonder \"who are these for??\".\n\nSo, pretty simple.  What do you have, and what is on your wish list?\n\nI'll start with what I have which is just a Casio CA-53W and a Sinn 556i.  I got the Casio years ago as an accessory to a Dwight Schrute Halloween costume, but have grown to appreciate it over time as more than a joke.  And I loved the Sinn as soon as I laid eyes on it - simple, great design.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/en8n937gi5ma1.png?width=592&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0323699066df4a2e3a0331c3ad027cceb3c5e863\n\nFor my wish list, I love tool watches, and (what I think) are some off the beaten path.  I am really not into big bezels, dive watches, or a bunch of text or complications on dials.  I love simplicty, versatility and emphasis on design.  So, that's why my wish list is:\n\nMũhle-Glashũtte SAR Rescue\n\nOmega Railmaster\n\nGrand Seiko SGBA413 (the one that doesn't fit in, but who doesn't love it?)\n\nRolex Milgauss\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qkx76ke1j5ma1.png?width=1371&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e6d74a08c1e56f6332b414a5b9cfed19ca30ab81",

Just wanted to document the state of my collection at stasis. Soon I will have to get another winder and will run out of space in my watch box, and that will be a personal milestone in the plan I have set for myself and my side business for the near/mid-term.

        "text": "Hello! I am picking a watch to receive as an engagement gift, and after spending too long reading this subreddit, I have some questions about the models I've narrowed my search down to. For context, I'm currently rocking a quartz timex and don't own anything more expensive than that, so I'm pretty new to this. My budget is $5k, though I'd be just as happy with something that costs $2k if it fits my preferences!  \nI am a software engineer, so nothing too rugged for work, though I do enjoy biking, hiking, and other outdoors activity. Ideally I'd like a watch that works for it all, though I'll wear something cheaper to hike if needed. I'd also like the watch to not look out of place with my very casual workwear (tshirt/jeans), but also have enough presence to look good with a wedding suit. I also want something which will remain functional and beautiful for decades, though I'm not particularly concerned about resale value because I don't intend to resell this one. I don't want something to big or flashy, but I do want something with some uniqueness and personality which isn't 100% pure \"timeless\". Here are some options I've found (though I'm open to suggestions):  \n1. Speedy reduced - Being a nerd, I followed the stereotype and looked first at speedies, and I really liked them! I went to an AD and tried the new pro and new 38, and felt the [new pro was too wide](https://imgur.com/a/eOntHWt) and the [new 38 was very thick](https://imgur.com/a/sDpPg9O). I don't at all mind the slightly different look of the reduced, and the dimensions sound great. The main concerns I have is if maintenance over time would be difficult/expensive and how sturdy the reduced is as an every day watch. Could I wear it for outdoorsy activities? Does it feel solid and rugged?  \n2. Sinn 356 - When reading about others lamenting the limited selection of small speedies, I saw a recommendation for the Sinn 356. Just based on the dial, I actually like this better than any speedies, but I have a couple reservations. First, it's even thicker than the coaxial 38. Second, I emailed watchbuys and it seems like they won't have road shows in the near future, so there's no real good way for me to see this in person. I would be curious what people's thoughts are, because at least for the coaxial 38, I felt it was very top heavy.  \n3. Longines spirit 37mm - with all the struggles to find a small/thin chronograph, I changed directions and looked at simpler watches. I feel the longines honestly checks a lot of boxes: long power reserve, certified movement, good dimensions. In addition, [I saw the 40mm in person](https://imgur.com/a/Q0jNte8) (couldn't find 37mm) and loved the blue dial color (shiny enough for suit, but still looked good casual) and applied numerals. Honestly this is a pretty strong frontrunner, but I'm curious if people think it wouldn't be as long term lasting as some of the more luxury brands like rolex/omega. I did compare this side-by-side with an Omega AT, but I personally preferred the look of the spirit, even independent of the large price difference.  \n4. vintage rolex DJ/OP - some family members weren't sure if the longines felt like enough of a prestige name and long term lasting piece, so they were suggesting rolex. I looked at some vintage models, and I do quite like the blue dials, especially with engine turned bezels like the [14010 posted recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/11i6584/rolex_airking_14010/). However, that only comes in 34mm, which seems small to wear for a wedding. Looking at 36mm, fluted seems too flashy and plain seems too \"plain\". Overall I'm leaning against these unless they'd be much more reliable and long-lasting than the longines, which seems questionable, especially since only vintage watches are in my price range.\n\nI'd highly appreciate any thoughts about these or other models as well! 2 more watches I liked but were ruled out were the [new seiko alpinist](https://imgur.com/a/6V8ylCz) (love the look and \"mountain man\" vibe, but it's too cheap for the occasion and i can get it myself later) and the [hamilton cooper](https://imgur.com/a/tjnr1Nn) (LOVE the applied numerals, but the 42mm diameter + small bezel made the dial look like it dwarfed my wrist).",

And i am not just talking about this particular one. Just in general (for me) it seems like talking about a watch costing 2k or 5k or 10k is just acceptable.
