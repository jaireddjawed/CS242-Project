I have an Associate's Degree in Math and actually took one CS course (Programming 1 OOP for Java). I earned a B\\+ which is decent for a beginner I feel like. Only thing is that it was on my old laptop so I don't have the coursework from last year. CS is definitively something I see myself doing in the future, just don't no where to start. I'd probably have to continue with Java or learn another language depending on the Universities requirements. Any beginner advice?",

For those of you that have never heard of the block plan, it basically boils down to this. You take one class for 18 days, 4 hours per day, 5 days per week, for three and a half weeks and then you are done with that class or block as they're called. I would be on the track to graduate early if the class I needed for both majors fell in the fall semester. However, the four classes I need to graduate are all in the spring. I can't take the semester off because I'm on the Exec board of my greek group and I play a sport. Because of this, I am taking a kinesiology class first and fourth block with vacation blocks in second and third \\(I basically would be on campus but not going to a class\\). Since I am only taking 2 classes in the fall, my tuition is less.\n\nMY QUESTION IS THIS:\n\nInstead of taking a vacation block during my second block, a 300 level CS class just opened up called \"Open Source Development\". The description is as follows: *Participants in this course will improve and add to existing software. We will work collaboratively and gain experience managing a project. We will learn disciplines and tools that will make us an effective team. We will gain familiarity with agile development, test\\-driven development, and distributed version control. We will learn how to share, license, and publish our software. We will practice with methods for describing our designs and testing our products. We will acquaint ourselves with reasons for choosing the open source model and with successful open source projects.*\n\nIf I add this class my tuition for the semester will go up \\~$5,000. I also have to complete a senior capstone project that I could put off until third block when I am free on vacation. I was an intern last year in a software development space that used agile and TDD but I was thinking that this would give me the formal credentials I need instead of just saying I was an intern that somewhat learned it.\n\nMy other option during second block is to take the vacation but focus on my capstone project, job searching, and gain some MS Certifications in Business Analytics \\(I am in a BI role as an intern this summer and I like what I'm doing\\). I don't fully know what kind of job I want in the CS space yet since both BI Analyst/Developer and Software Developer pay fairly well in the Chicago area and I was wondering what would be more beneficial.\n\nANY HELP ON ANSWERING THIS IS GREATLY APPRECIATED!!!",

Now that I'm finished school I'd like to devote a decent chunk of my free time to learning more robust programming 1. to be more attractive in the job market as I hope to move into product development and research for biomedical tech and 2. to be able to do generally fun stuff on my own. \n\nI'd like to be able to prototype some wearable devices for fun right now and got a free raspberry pi from my roommate so that's what I've started to work with. Although, needing a keyboard, mouse and monitor kind of puts a limit to the mobility of the pi as a coding setup. My question is what are some good programs that I can use to play around with different languages \\(python, C, Swift\\). I've been told that using programs like x\\-code can get annoying as they won't compile or run properly when I try to implement them on the pi? I've browsed some forums and saw that others have tried to create scripts to solve this problem, but I haven't tried any of them yet. Any advice would be appreciated. \n\nThanks!\n\nNote: my laptop is a MacBook ",

I'm trying to generate strings for a fairly simple s-expression type grammar that has single digits, addition and subtraction. Originally I thought of simply randomly generating all possible strings and then using a parser to select matching strings but the volume of wasted computation would be prohibitive.\n\nSo I'm hoping to instead take the grammar, and directly generate strings in a shortest first order (lexicographic order doesn't matter, merely length). I've got a vague notion that a backtracking search is the answer, however my experimentation with doing this for regexes (since they're simpler and I was hoping to transfer the experience) has left me with the realisation that I have no idea how to actually do the bookkeeping to keep the generated string and the \"position\" in the grammar in sync.\n\nI'm using Chibi (R7RS) scheme. \n\nI've also not been able to find anything via googling so far.\n\n[EDIT]: For anybody new reading this who happen to be interested in doing the same, u/teraflop suggested the following link to a series of blog posts which goes into extensive detail about the topic: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ericlippert/2010/04/19/every-binary-tree-there-is/",

Right now, I'm only at a community college, but I will be transferring to University after no more than 2.5 years. Throughout the year, I have heard all kinds of things from the difficulty to the amount of Math involved. I've also heard that it is a worthwhile degree and jobs pay well. I'm doing well, right? But for some reason, I'm scared. And somehow, I feel lost in what I'm doing, despite all I have accomplished. I'm taking my first CS class in the fall, and what scares me the most is that I will not like it, especially because the horror stories have gotten to me. I am excited though to take my first CS class in the fall, though.\n\nI'm heavily emphasizing my Math classes. In addition to my math classes, I've started to watch Khan Academy and putting the most time into Math. I've done:\n\nIntro to College Mathematics \\-\\&gt; Precalculus Algebra \\-\\&gt; Precalculus Trigonometry \\(doing this one right now over the summer\\). I feel like they're going to expect me to know all the math in the world later, which scares the sh\\*t out of, even though in I have gotten exceptional grades in my math courses thus far.\n\nHonestly, I'm just looking for nudges in the right directions and some helpful tips and advice to aid me. I can definitely? do it. Is it really as bad as people say it is? What has been your experience? Did you enjoy it? How did you study for things If you say \"I hope you like Math\", I do. I'm not taking the easy way out, either. If it's hard, it'll only be worth more to me. I just feel intimidated, but I'm *not* going to quit.\n\n**please help :\\(** I'm confused/ lost / scared but excited at the same time.\n\nThanks :\\)",

I'm currently working a crappy, dead-end job to make some spending money but I've come to realize that my final semester is just to round off time and math requirements for my degree. The computer science part of my Computer Science degree is done. I AM a computer scientist now I'm just waiting to get the piece of paper that says so in December.\n\nSo I've decided I'm ready to work but the question is how to find work. I live in rural Mississippi and I commute to my university which is in a larger, more populous part of the state so any jobs that I would be able to get where I live would be there. However, I'm having a hard time tracking them down. I've talked to my adviser and some of my other professors about seeking employment in the area or possibly getting myself exposed in a job fair but they've all given me the cold shoulder, expecting me to simply dive in and feel around. While that's all well and good I would rather my experience with career searching be a little better informed. \n\nSo what suggestions do you have? Are there any tools or resources I might be able to tap into to get myself out there? My current financial situation allows me to work unpaid internships temporarily for work experience but I'd rather be compensated for my efforts if you catch my drift. Thanks to all that can help me out! ",

Sometimes with meetings, there might be 100 people more. \nThere are multiple companies eating in the same cafeteria and every person register when they eat there.\n\nMy registrations looks like this:\n\n|Name|Company|Time|No. of people|\n|----|----|----|----|\n|John|Company A|2018-05-30 12:00|1|\n|Alice|Company B|2018-05-30 12:05|3|\n|Bob|Company A|2018-05-30 12:10|1|\n\nBut is the datasize too small to make some machine learning on datasets like these? \n\nOr should I maybe go a different route?\n\nI know that this probably wont be worth it, but I was thinking it could be a good side project for me.\n\n\nEdit: I forgot details.\n\nCurrently, every morning we have a simple popup program which asks users if they eat in the cafeteria. It sends a mail to the cafeteria. The program is difficult to get distributed across different companies (Different IT policies in different companies).\n\n\nThe chef in the cafeteria has an idea about how many people that eat in the cafeteria, but sometimes he has way too much and god forbid that he has too little (which has happened a couple of times for the people eating late).\n\nMy idea was that computer science might be able to create an estimate for the next day, recognizing tendencies like: every monday there are 20% more people than normal.

        "text": "This isn't technically homework, but it is a university extracurricular so it's not really a 'real world' problem.\n\nI have some python and C skill, but algorithms is very much a secondary skill of mine. I have to make two robots navigate between arbitrary points in a room. They aren't able to detect each other on-the-fly.\n\nThey communicate with a central hub which has to formulate the routes and pass it on to the robots. The routes must be the quickest route from the start point to the finish point without directing two robots to occupy the same space simultaneously.\n\nThe floor is divided into a grid (think chessboard). Some tiles will have obstacles sitting on them.\n\nI'm thinking about using dijkstra's route-finding algorithm and treating each tile as a node. The only difference between a regular implementation of dijkstra's algorithm and this case is that the node-to-node distance would change every 'step' of the optimal route calculation because the other robot may be occupying a square... Is this the right track? Can anyone think of other methods?\n\nI'm sure this is a solved problem, but I haven't been able to track it down.",

        "text": "Hi everyone! So I've been working on the P vs NP problem for some time now. It led me to creating a new theoretical tool box called Path Theory which allows one to analyze a problem's state space and develop maps to explore them efficiently. We use these tools to define a set of relationships to search for 3SAT solutions more efficiently, allowing us to solve any instance in time less than O(n^3 ). All in all, this is a constructive proof that P=NP.\n\nI'm by no means a mathematician, just a philosopher who loves numbers and studied computer science in school. Many of the topics I discuss in here might actually have formal definitions in other theories, but this was everything I needed to solve this problem. The paper walks you through all of the introductory things you need to understand how and why the algorithm works, then it shows you how to do it. Lastly, there's a crude analysis of the algorithm showing upper bounds, but no average case analysis.\n\nMostly what I'm looking for is anyone willing to look over it and provide me some feedback or point out any mistakes. Honestly, if you could just show me a counter-example to what I've said, I'd owe you a life debt. I haven't been able to find one, but if the greatest minds in the entire world have thrown their all at this problem for the last 60 years, I can't see me figuring this out, so there must be something I missed.\n\nI'd ask friends or others to look over it, but I don't really know anybody capable of understanding most of this stuff. I figured I could capitalize on the collective knowledge of experts in this area on this subreddit.\n\nHere's the link to the google doc with my paper. It's by no means finished, but the ideas are all there. Please comment it up if you see anything you think I could use feedback on, and for anyone who actually does look at this, thank you so much!! You have no idea how much I appreciate the time and energy!\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1tzSPyH5J4jn6ieZaJluy-PLwsQTe_mOQSpyqznbL1sY/edit?usp=sharing",
