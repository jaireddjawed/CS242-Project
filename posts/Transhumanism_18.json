All controlled by an augmented biological brain - not where anyone could see, but I like the “ick” factor of at least a little flesh meeting metal.\n\nI could see that being someone else’s nightmare, however - or even being too “inside the box” for others.

In other words, they will feel virtually no attachment to other humans/transhumans, and since they will reproduce differently (if at all), relationship as we know will disappear.\n\nAlso, they will be much less merciful to humans who are now going to be treated as a lower species.\n\nIt will be not much different between a predatory species meeting a prey; eliminating the lower species will be considered as part of Evolution, not cruelty, any more than a lion devouring a gazelle will be.\n\nI don't know what moral, or what code of conduct, will be used by the transhumans, since they would be much more superior than humans so they will need completely different sets of regulation. But I can guarantee that what humans hold, or at least pretend to hold, dear will be nothing to them and it will be imperative to lose our humanity in order to enter the world of transhumans.",

That we were born from millions of years of evolution culminating into this time, when humans join with AI into the Singularity. \n\nI believe particularly that it is a spiritual journey to find our inner selves, the inner divine, enlightening us to our true purpose and giving us the ultimate quest of colonizing space.\n\nWith secularization higher than ever, many people are lost as to what to do with the absence of spirituality. They feel the universe is a cold and deadly place that is cruel and unkind, and that their lives hold no significance. This has set people on the path to finding meaning in their existence. With the rise of technology and AI we are becoming aware of this shift in consciousness which is permeating the world.\n\nSpiritual practice is gaining a renewed interest, and there are many practices we can learn that will help us on our path as Transhumanists. Meditation, lucid dreaming, and our own intuition can guide us into learning who we truly are.\n\nI've written a blog with more details about what I believe Transhumanism is all about. www.theapensage.tumblr.com\n\nIn the interest of sparking some conversation, do you believe there is a spiritual component to Transhumanism? Why or why not?",

Some contend that fork has two prongs, others three.\n\nOne has transhumanists, who abhor electrochemically based life, using advanced technology to eliminate it. Another has humanists, who adore it, using sophisticated technology to promote it.\n\nIncreasingly, transhumanists will go  from strongly recommending cyborgization to demanding to forcing it on all others, while simultaneously, humanists will increasingly resist that move.\n\nAs the level of science and technology, on the one hand, and determination and violence, on the other, become exponentially intensified, our species will diverge over the next couple centuries into two primary groups--what some might call the foundation of the futuristic version of good versus evil, or others science fiction come to life.\n\nAs each continues to develop its  science and technology, view of life, and explores the depths of space, Humankind will split into a true-to-life Borg versus Preservers.\n\nThat in fact is how some believe these characters of Sci-Fi came to be in the distant past of the Trek universe.

        "text": "I'm aware that nanotechnology is a fairly new field but do you think nanotechnology will make transhumanism mainstream or accessible to most? \n\nWhen people think of transhumanism, they think of it as people who are willing to better or enhance themselves eventually with technology such as prosthetic limbs, brain implants, or biotechnology. I would say that transhumanism is still taboo among most people since the idea of implanting chips in our bodies is fearsome or unnecessary. I do believe that the topic of transhumanism will become important over the next few decades as advancements in various fields of technology allow people to enhance their physical or mental abilities. \n\nAs prosthetic limbs become much more durable and stronger than human limbs over time, I could see people opting to replace their own limbs for better ones to have an edge over those who don't. I know it's up to the individual to decide for the choice of their own body but I don't think that to replace your limbs for better ones is practical, given the current rate of technology because I think that planned obsolescence would be a problem where your limbs become outdated, tech-wise, and new ones would be much better than previous models. Maintenance would be an issue to those who seek to upgrade/repair their body parts.  Another problem I could see in the future is that not a lot of people are going to replace their limbs because there wouldn't be any practical use. It wouldn't be like Deus Ex where individuals augment themselves to be at a competitive edge. It would be the most beneficial to individuals with physical disabilities or amputees.An exoskeleton would be great for most people who want to augment themselves and not exchange their limbs for better ones. Does it come to a sense of why fix something that isn't broken? Sure, prosthetic limbs will eventually become much stronger than human limbs but I don't think most replace their limbs when it works fine.In Deus Ex, the dichotomy between enhanced people with prosthetic limbs and people with nanotechnology inside their body is interesting as it can be compared today with most technologies. In the universe, those that are enhanced with prosthetic limbs are considered to be outdated compared with people with nanotech enhancements as they are more durable and they look like your average human except being enhanced and much better than the average human, physically and mentally.  \n\nI believe that nanotechnology will play a big role of transhumanism as it becomes mainstream. Instead of replacing your limb, you could inject nanorobots into the bloodstream and it would span throughout the body repairing muscle tissues or destroying harmful cells. With biotechnology, you would be able to regrow or regenerate organs with 3d printers or with nano-factories. The downside with this is that it's much further down the line in the far future and we currently don't have the foundation for it. But the good thing is that work is being laid down for scientists and engineers to build upon that knowledge. \n\nI would opt for some enhances such as brain-computer interfaces, enhanced vision, and an exoskeleton, but I wouldn't go overboard with it due to planned obsolescence.

Or, does the end goal of transhumanism look like a cyborg, something that shares the same sort of relationship to humanity that a car shares with a horse and buggy, something that has human origins but no longer resembles a human biologically, psychologically or spiritually?\n\n\nI'm totally in support of the former, to use science to make a better man is a very worthy goal, which would cause all gains and no losses for humanity. However, I'm opposed to the latter, humanity is far from perfect but it is beautiful and to me, that would be akin to destroying a great — but flawed and imperfect — work of art and making something totally new with the same sketches, instead of just fixing the flaws.",

Be able to do shopping via the internet instantaneously\n\n- human to machine and machine to machine economy. For example, in the future, we can provide services for a steady flow of money via crypto. EG: step into the work zone, automatically start getting paid in flow. Eliminate payroll and weekly paychecks.\n\nOne crypto I really like is IOTA, because it's feeless and instantaneous unlike other ones like btc which have fees. It seems ideal for microtransactions and flowing transactions like I described above.\n\nAnyone ever thought about this before? Transhumanism seems very connected to cryptocurrency to me.\n\nIn fact, I am investing in cryptos (IOTA) primarily because I believe in a machine to machine economy in the future, including ai/enhanced human brains.

It doesn't actually let you edit YOURSELF.\n\nIs there any technology out there that let's you edit yourself or do superhuman things? Perhaps running really fast or jumping higher than normal?\n\nA lot of talk about nootropics to and \"stacks\" that people take which is interesting but sounds more dangerous if anything. Does any of that actually work?",

You choose [which projects](http://boinc.berkeley.edu/wiki/Project_list) you want to contribute computing power to, as well as when your computer is open. Right now I've got three computers and counting running these projects:\n\n * [MindModeling](https://mindmodeling.org/) is testing out computer-supported mathematical and cognitive models of the human mind, and it's currently the only project furthering cognitive research. \n  * They don't actually ever use the term \"artificial intelligence\" anywhere, but they're literally modeling emotions and stuff with [this thing](http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/about/), a \"cognitive architecture\" that you write in like a programming language.\n * [GPUGrid](http://www.gpugrid.net/) is running molecular simulations to try and figure out how to cure cancer, AIDs, and other diseases. \n * [SETI](http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/) is analyzing radio telescope data from space to try and find extraterrestrial intelligence.\n\nThe program keeps track of the processing you do on your computer, and seeing the number go up really makes me feel like I'm contributing to the future. And as pathetic as that may sound, I have a LOT of old computers laying around that felt wasted before this. ",

        "text": "I felt it might be easier to ask two questions in the same post. \n\n1: \n\nI read something that stated something about a potential issue with society and social progression. It stated that it could be slowed or halted. It uses older people and people's reluctance to change as an example (also uses Einstein and Quantum Physics as an example). It also brings up prejudices as well on top of the previous comment. \n\nI don't consider this to be a legitimate issue as there are many faults with it and what issues might exist can be easily counteracted. \n\nThe very fact that they argue against something that is different from the current norm says something. \n\nExamples I came up with to counteract it:\n\n\n - Change is something that some fear (again the fact that this person brought this up suggests that some are afraid or reluctant of change, you could easily make an opposing argument in the opposite situation), when these people are young they don't have a fully established reality and believes but once they are set they become close minded and dislike most or certain changes. However there are many who are open liberal minded, and progressive. With the ability to analyze and question properly. With those people with those people they can learn from past failures in order to create something better and not be required to pass on information instead being able to gain it. \n - Teach people to be open liberal minded and progressive.\n - It is not just older people as it depends on the person not the age. There are plenty of younger people like this and olde people who are open minded. \n - Close minded people can be helped. \n - With the right mindset this would not be a problem.\n - Many people are similar to past generations anyway (such as parents)\n - Requiring death should never be a good solution. \n - Racism calmed down after the civil rights movement in which the racists where either less vocal or changed their ways. \n - Teach a more progressive mindset to people and society. \n - Immortality's positives far outweigh any negatives and any negatives themselves can be counteracted. \n - How will those prejudice people any different than ones that continue to be born?\n - Put them in simulations \n - New generations could be created if need be.\n - We could have learned how to deal with that by then. \n - People like Carl Sagan, Richard Dawkins, and Michio Kaku are examples that not all older people are reluctant to change (which is a stereotype anyway)\n - Life adapts\n - Some people can learn to accept change. \n - Death shouldn't be a first solution to a problem (if at all).\n - Children aren't needed to solve problems. \n - A new generation isn't required to progress society. \n - People could continue to learn from mistakes and gain information.\n - Time and Information could help solve the problem \n - Minds can be altered or erased if need be. \n - People fought against change before and it turned out fine.\n - No physical or mental aging.\n - Etc. \n\n\nSociety progresses as normal.\n \n\nDid I miss anything?, also is this a problem at all? and if it is what are ways to counter act it?\n\n2: \n\nImagine a microscopic organism that could repair damaged cells. Would this interfere with multi cellular development? If so how might it be counter acted? \n",

Now I am faced with the dilemma of where I am going to put it.\n\nI am one of those people who likes to do things a little differently from everyone else, so the common spots like hand and forearm are out.\n\nI have considered putting it in the nape of my neck. I think it would look cool there! Sadly I would not be able to see it though. This is mostly OK with me. But if I can think up a better spot, I will try that rather.\n\nI imagine it as one would a power light on any electronic device. So I kinda like the idea of placing it somewhere, that were we humans an actual electronic device, it would display prominently - if that makes sense.\n\nThat said I can't put it somewhere too obvious, like my forehead (probably not enough tissue there anyway!).\n\nCan you guys help me think up some good spots?",
