        "text": "TLDR at the bottom\n\nIll jump right into it, today wasn't a good day for me, it was just one of those days, with just a couple of people at work.\n\nAfter I finished work today I went straight to the gym, its a small establishment with only two parking spots out the front, and a very popular ice cream store across the road. The Gym is mostly for private sessions, since its only a small place.\n\nWell today, as I pulled up to park in the spot that is clearly marked for gym patrons, an older lady with her three kids hop out of the car, generally the gym owner asks them nicely to move, but I blocked him from them with my car so he couldn't chase after them, I think she knew what she had done, as her and her kids ran quickly across the road and into the Ice Cream shop.\n\nIf another patron was there I would park behind the gym owner, but since we both saw her duck across the road I parked right behind her and the gym owner, parking them both in.\n\nAbout 20 minutes into my workout she starts packing her kids into the car, then she fluffs around for a few more before entering the gym so probably about 10 minutes taken upto this point.\n\nShe announces loudly that she has been parked in, and tells us to move the car. \n\nI tell her its mine, but I've paid for a scheduled slot here so she will need to wait.\n\nShe, becoming a bit angry, huffs and puffs and asks how long will that be? The Gym owner says the park is clearly marked for patrons only, with the name of the gym on the signs, and that the session is for an hour, After a brief moment of silence and what I think was the inner workings of her brain, she realised what that meant and was not too happy with that response.\n\nShe pipes up with \"but I have three young kids in the car\" the next words that came out of my mouth astonished me, I never thought I could be so witty, I said a \"lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part\".\n\nMind you i'm an avid reader of r/talesfromtechsupport which is where I read that sometime this week, not sure on the post or what day it was.\n\nShe left defeated and accepted that I wasn't moving the car.\n\nAfter my session just to drag it out, I decided I needed to use the bathroom and clean up a little bit, Then I decided to do about a 10 point turn in the shortest movements so my car didn't touch the fence or the building or worse her car.  (I could of reversed out if I wanted to)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Lady parks in my spot, make her wait 30+ minutes.",

        "text": "This happened about an hour ago. \n\nMy wife and i were out doing some shopping and decided to stop for dinner at Cheddar's. Food was decent, service was okay. As we were leaving the restaurant, we saw there was a super cool Ferrari FF parked right in front of the place, like RIGHT in front. As we were walking by it, we realized that it was parked in not one, but two handicapped spots, at a real funny angle. \n\nThere was no handicapped placard in the window. \n\nAs we were looking at directions on how to get home, we started talking about how much of a douchebag move that was, and how we'd like to see it get towed or something. \n\nI was wishing i had a notebook or something to leave a shitty note, but my wife was thinking on a bigger scale. \n\nWe talked about calling the cops and trying to get it towed, but let's face it, dallas area cops don't even bother coming out for an emergency, let alone to something minor as that. \n\nSo there i am looking at my phone and i see my wife fiddling with hers, but i don't know what she's doing. Then, i hear a ringing coming from her phone. I'll try to get this as close to possible as i can: \n\n\"Yeah, hi, i am just leaving your restaurant, and there is a fancy Ferrari parked in front, across two handicapped spots, which is awful, but that's not why I'm calling. Well, someone just backed into it, yes, the Ferrari, and then drove off, I'm not sure, but if you guys have like an intercom or something, you should probably try and find that guy\"\n\nThe person on the phone said \"okay, I'll go tell him\"\n\nWe sat in our car, watching the front door and like 15 seconds later a very large man and another just large man came running out to the car and walking circles around it(possibly confirming our suspicion that he wasn't handicapped, but i know, there are handicaps that aren't obvious) , trying to find the damage that wasn't there. A few seconds later 3 more people came out and started trying to help find the damage. Since the parking lot is not very well lit, that guy was probably thinking how he was gonna need to go home and get it in some good light to check it out.\n\nWe had a pretty good laugh about it, and then drove home...\n\nAlso, as we were in the car, a twenty something white kid walked by and took a pic, so that might be in another thread by now.\n\nTL;DR: park your fancy car like an asshole, get treated like an asshole ",

        "text": "I've been working at a Subway restaurant for the past two years from the end of high school through my first year of college. I take classes in the morning and afternoon so when I work it's usually a closing shift (only working 15 hours a week, full time student). \n\nThe only issue is I close by myself so it really toys with my anxiety whenever I get a rush, or can't finish certain duties by a certain time, etc. So by the end of the night I'm usually so out of it mentally and just want to get home ASAP (we close at 10). \n\nSo tonight I was closing like usual, and I really wanted to get home as early as I could to finish an assignment due at midnight. Of course with my luck it turns out being one of the busiest nights we've had in a while because they recently sent out coupons for BOGO Footlong after 4PM, such a fucking dumbass move, especially for alone-closers. So by the time 10 rolls around I'm fucking finishing up the dishes, cleaning the line, counting the bread, wraps, bowls, etc, and I go to lock the door at 10 and as I'm turning off the open signs a guy walks in and I tell him \"sorry, were closed\". \n\nHe wittily responds: \"then how'd I get in here?\" \n\nI respond: \"I was walking to lock the door right now, you have to leave sir\"\n\nHim: \"No, I want a sandwich\"\n\nAt this point I'm just thinking if this guys ballsy enough to tell a business worker to stay open after hours because HE wants service then idk what he could do. So I decide to make him his sandwich to just make him go away.\n\nHe proceeds to take a good 2-3 more mins just staring at the menu, omg I was fuming, every dagger imaginable coming from my eyes was hitting his stare. I make his sandwich then we move to the POS/Cash register. I go to put in the sandwich, tell him his total, and he pulls out a $50 dollar bill. HOLY SHIT I get so fucking excited because we can't accept bills over $20 and I pray he doesn't have any other method of pay. I tell him the bad news, he of course gets angry saying to break it anyway, well good thing I just dropped most of the money from the register into our safe before I went to lock up, so I literally couldn't give him proper change for the $50. I explain it to him as I slide his sub to the side where he can't reach it and he just leaves in a fit of rage. I proceeded to then take that sub home and eat it whilst finishing up my assignment and turning it in on time. \n\nHonestly if he wasn't such a commanding douche I would've just gave him the sub and tell him not to worry about it. But if you're gonna force me to do my job past our posted hours and be a dick about it, you're not getting a break. \n\nTL;DR: If you're gonna force a business to stay open past their posted hours JUST FOR YOU, you'd better be able to pay.\n\nEdit: Grammar",

I stayed with the business for 2 months and was on top of everything, making customers happy, and make sure everyone was organized. My ‘boss’ and I agreed to $10 a month for my services, and I thought I would be happy like that. \n\nIt started with him with the cliche excuses, oh I’m at school, my phone broke. This went on for a couple of weeks which really ticked me and the staff a lot. After bugging him for a bit he decided to tell me that he was ‘quitting’ the business and told me no one was getting any money. He had ran away worth a grand total of $400. At this point, I was beyond pissed. I went to the website (Where we made our deals and was a general market) and made a report on him. He got blacklisted from the site, and he had paid $30 in cosmetics and other stuff for his profile. He got banned, and I thought that was the end of that.\n\nBut here’s where it gets better. \n\nHe had another account, with ANOTHER $30 in cosmetics for his other profile. He had pretended to be his ‘sister’ and I had a report BEFORE, saying that they were the same person. (I forgot that I made this report) It had been answered, and both his accounts are banned! My prayers have been answered. So in total, he is now hated in the community, he lost $60, and he lost all his reputation. \n\nSo long, Max!",

        "text": "For a bit of background, I've been working in science and space related fields for most of my career. Over the last few years I've lived in Washington DC and have slowly started to get to know some people in science and science policy around here, and of course this being DC, there's always some gala or large fancy event where big wigs like to rub elbows. This brings me to about a year or so ago, where there was one such event at the National Air and Space museum, followed by a series of talks given by a group of scientists on planetary science and the Mars rovers. Through a friend of mine, I actually volunteered to work at this event handing out name tags and setting some stuff up for these talks. \n\nNow this event had a few big names at it. There was an astronaut or two hanging around, but it was mainly policy folk. At one point I had to help set up in the large auditorium by putting name cards on the seats where some of the VIPs were going to sit. Here's where the revenge comes in...\n\nI see one of the of the name cards reads **Reserved for Rep. Lamar Smith.** And if you don't know who that is, he's one of the most vocal climate change deniers in the house, and is also the chair of the house committee on science, space, and technology. Now I have a major problem with the person who denies the fundamental findings of multiple agencies within our nations scientific infrastructure, while also being the person at the very head of said infrastructure. So, I decide to give the congressman the worst seat in the house. \n\nThere were a few cameras that were situated throughout the auditorium to record the talks, and one of them was a rather large TV camera on a rotating platform. It had a pretty big obnoxious lens that was so long that it stuck out into the seats in front of it. I knew that anybody that would be so unlucky to get that seat would end up having that thing poke them in the back of the head for the whole presentation. So, I casually placed the congressman's name tag on the seat with the camera behind it, and walked away.\n\nA few times during the presentation I noticed the camera slowly panning into the side of his head, and him turning around and getting pissed at the camera operator and the camera operator getting pissed back at him for getting in the way of his shot. Eventually he just slunk down into his seat and watched the talks almost horizontally with the camera moving around a few uncomfortable inches above his head. \n\nEdit: It's Representative Smith, not Senator Smith. My bad. ",

        "text": "This happened at one of my jobs a few years ago but I like to think back on it to remind myself to be humble and for a good laugh. \n\nWhere I worked we didn't have typical office hours and all had different days off. This new guy we shall call Sam negotiated getting Thursdays and Fridays off but was about to lose this privilege after school was over for him. I know this because he never stopped bragging about it. \n\nA little background on Sam. This was his first big boy job out of school so he was intensely cocky for getting picked out of hundreds of applicants. My department was very popular and difficult to get into. He talked my manager into giving him a shot and got way into his head. \n\nI was his supervisor at the time and would need to keep him in check from being lazy and distracted. Any time I gave him a talk he would give me attitude and eventually talk his way out of trouble with my boss. My boss was a total idiot and hated confrontation so it was a never ending cycle of hin getting away with not doing any work. \n\nOne of the things he would do that made our female coworkers uncomfortable in the office was flirt with girls in other departments on speaker phone. I don't condone uncomfortable work environments so this was the day I officially decided to take revenge. \n\nSo remember how I told you Sam was about to lose his days off? I made sure that feeling would sting him a little by reminding him how fun thirsty Thursdays at bars were and Fridays yielded the best parties. In fact as a grand goodbye I convinced him to throw a huge party on his last Friday off for him to appreciate his old schedule and what he was about to lose. \n\nTo make sure he would go along with it I stroked his ego by telling him all these girls would probably attend because he's been the talk of the town the moment he started with us. Little did he know that all the girls he thought he was flirting with wound up telling me how creeped out they were whenever he called. \n\nI basically got him to trust me enough to invite all the girls he didnt know at work while he talked to his \"sure things\". The final tally wound up looking a little over 40 confirmations. \n\nThe big day of the party arrives and he asks if he should confirm with anybody. I told him I would take care of all that because I've been there longer and he should focus on decorating and preparations. I spent the entire day playing Xbox and taking my girlfriend shopping. \n\nHe texts me asking what time I would be there so I told him after I went to the gym and had dinner. I planned to use the excuse that I fell asleep when I saw him at work. Also to keep his suspense up I told him our female coworkers would get there before I would so he won't notice me anyway. \n\nThe following day I get to work and my other coworker, Gary, asks me if I went to this party I hyped up. After I told him no he says \"Yeah I know, I was the only one there\". \n\nIt turns out. Sam's brother and brother's gf were the only ones who showed up. And after 2 hours of nobody showing up Sam calls Gary to ask if he can come over to help him with cleaning and keep him company. Sam bought a ton of booze and maybe 10 pizzas for his party and nobody to indulge in them. I almost felt bad but he used a paycheck that he didn't earn by letting his coworkers do all the heavy lifting, while he manipulated my idiot boss into seeing him do no wrong.\n\nThe next time he came into work he was dead quiet, did all of his work, and never made any of the ladies at work uncomfortable again. He was still pretty lazy and learned not to use speakerphone to flirt with other departments. But the main reward for me was him never talking back to me and keeping his ego in check for the rest of my time there. I fed him his humble pie and it was in the form of 10 pizzas keeping all of his beer company. \n\n*update*\nThank you for all those who went out if their way to support me. This was just meant to entertain so I didnt expect all the hate. \n\nI honestly thought my approach would be better as opposed to getting him fired and blacklisted as soon as he started. \n\nMy coworkers and I still keep in touch and they tell me my old boss was demoted, he has a girlfriend he regularly cheats on, and my old clients hate Sam because he uses their accounts to buy himself dinner whenever possible. The only part I regret is that he didn't change at all. ",

        "text": "  \n\nThis happened about two years ago when I was a senior in college. I moved in with three other guys, people I was friendly with but wouldn’t say we were all really close at the time. It was a four bedroom with a shared kitchen ad den. One guy in particular, lets call him Roommate D, was always doing something to get on my nerves like leaving dishes uncleaned, and lighting incense in our den. But what really pushed me over the edge was when we got a cable box for our living room and he decided that he ‘didn’t watch tv” and so he shouldn’t have to pay the bill. Meanwhile he would watch tv in his room all the time using Netflix and some basic cable provided by our apartment complex.\n\nOur complex was opening up a couple new buildings and began showcasing them to perspective renters. One way they did this was by offering a raffle to win a new 55inch Vizio Smartcast Flat-screen tv. Now a little backstory about the tv we were using in our living room. Roommate A’s mom was kind enough to lend us her tv for the first couple months of the school year. So back to the raffle, I, Roommate A and Roommate B all agreed that if we won we would place the new tv in our living room to give Roommate A’s mom her tv back. \n\nBut I’m sure you can see where this is going. Roommate D being the guy that he is declined this offer and said he would be putting it in his room. He then said he promised to give the girl who would pick his name out of the raffle his current tv. He goes on to say that he and his family have such great luck in raffles, God always picks his family for raffles, they never lose. \n\nI am fuming and irritated at this point. So two days later when I get the call that I won the tv, oh boy was he in for it. Now this was no ordinary SmartTV, it had Chromecast and a remote app available on iPhones. Once we set up this SmartTV in our living room, I gave Roommate’s A, and B the apps code but not Roommate D. From then on when Roommate D tried to watch tv any one of us, with our phones from our rooms, were able to mute, change the channel, or even turn off the tv. I never told Roommate D about the app but he figured out what we were doing and caved a couple months in and began to pay for cable, including the months he missed.\n\nTl/Dr: Had a roommate that was too cheap to pay cable bill and claimed he doesn’t watch tv. I won a raffle for a SmartTv and made sure he couldn’t watch TV until he paid.\n\nEdit: As many have pointed out, if he wasn’t watching tv with the cable box he would not have needed to pay. Yes he could’ve just as a nice gesture, but prior to winning the tv he would watch tv in our living room and continuously say “normally I don’t watch tv”",

        "text": "This was a while ago when I was in middle school so forgive me for missed details. I know its not the greatest petty revenge but it was a victory for me that day.\n\nIn the 7th grade I was in an “art” class if you could call it that. It was basically just a Pinterest DIY class with materials ranging from toilet paper tubes to old cans. One of our “projects” was making pendents for necklaces out of beads. Innocent sounding, but the teacher,(we’ll call her Mrs. C)  though it would be a good idea to melt the beads in a toaster oven in an enclosed room. The fumes made my throat sting and never being one to just sit there and tolerate something stupid I confronted her. \n\nMe: Uh, Mrs. C, can I go outside and get some fresh air? The fumes from the plastic are making me feel sick...\nMrs. C: What? It’s not that bad just sit down you’re being dramatic.\nMe: Yeah no, thats not going to happen.\n\nI walked out of the class and got some much needed air, with Mrs. C close behind. She started yelling about how I was being disrespectful and how she was the teacher and blah blah blah. \n\nMe: Yeah no, I’m not going to inhale melted plastic fumes for a craft project. \n\nMrs. C started to sense that I wasnt just going to give up and submit to her “authority”. \nMrs C.: Well I’ll open the door then to let some air in.\n\nI went back in for about 2 minutes and it just felt like the fumes were getting worse. Being a little rebel I started to gossip amongst my fellow classmates, in a few minutes I had collected a group of 5 or 6 students that felt sick as well and got them to follow me outside. Our group was yelled at but eventually Mrs C. Realized she had no power over us and gave up and went back to making her stupid melted bead necklaces. Eventually an administrator made their rounds and questioned why we were all out of class. I told him what was going on and when he went inside he had a little yelling contest with the teacher about safety, needless to say, the rest of the year was a lot more “tame” with mainly paper based projects. Though that teacher had it out for me for the rest of the year it never really bothered me.\n\nTldr:/ crafts teacher makes project with harmful fumes in an enclosed space and is angry when i don’t tolerate it.\n",

        "text": "A story I read in a different sub reminded me of this occasion, back about 20 years ago when I worked in fast food.\n\nFirst, some background to set the stage.  This location was in a mall.  Most stores in the mall have a back door that leads to a hallway.  Ours was on the end, so it would take a good 5 minutes each way to get out to the food court for lunch break.  Between that and the general busy-ness of the food court, most of us ate our meals in the back room.\n\nSecond piece of background, our fries were served in a cup, not a sleeve.  Easy to stand up, easy to grab from.  Well, one guy liked to swipe fries from whoever was on their break.  I'm going to call him Dusty, because that was his actual nickname at work (and it was 20 years ago).  If Dusty was making a bathroom run, he'd grab 1 or 2 fries from his coworker's cup as he headed out the door.  There were usually leftover fries that we could grab, so this was an annoyance at best.\n\nNow, I liked my fries from that place with some Lawry's Seasoned Salt.  We had that in a shaker up front so that customers could put it on their fries.  A lot of them would dump the fries onto the tray liner and then sprinkle the Lawry's over them.  I didn't want to use up a tray liner, so I'd just dump a ton of Lawry's on the top of the cup.  Then when I was in back, I'd shake the cup back and forth to make the Lawry's cascade down on the rest of the fries.\n\nI wish I could say this was planned, but it wasn't.  I was taking my lunch break and eating in back, when Dusty came through and grabbed some of my fries.  Problem was, I hadn't shaken the Lawry's down yet.  He got 2 fries and the same volume in salt.  I could hear his exclamation all the way down the hall.\n\nAfter that, he never grabbed my fries again.  Others, sure, but he never touched my food.",

        "text": "I have a pretty crazy old lady neighbor(we'll call her CL). Ex bank robber, current meth addict, hoarder, and generally unlikeable unless she shares her meth stash with you. \n\nShe's been walking her dog down my street, and dropping turds in front of my, and other neighbor's driveways for about two months now. Some have called the sheriff, some have confronted her directly, and she still continues to walk her dog here, and refuses to pick up after it. \n\nI hatched a simple plan last week to put an end to it, and got a few of the upset neighbors involved. It's the good ole bacon grease trick with a twist. \n\nThis morning, I'm cooking breakfast(mmm, bacon!), and I get a text from the neighbor at the end of the street telling me she just started walking the dog, so I get my bacon out of the pan, dump my old grease jar into the pan, heat it up, and walk down to the farthest part of the street, and work my way back to in front of my house. \n\nRight as CL comes around the corner, I start dumping grease on the two dozen shit piles close to my house where she can see me. Que argument. \n\nCL- What the f**k are you doing?\n\nMe- Cleaning up your dog's messes, you've been asked not to walk your dog down here if you won't clean up after it. \n\nCL- Well, it's a public road, and I don't have to clean up anything that isn't in your yard.\n\nMe- I'm not asking you to clean up, I'm making your dog so it because you're a wasteoid.\n\nCL- Go fuck yourself little boy!( I'm 42 btw).\n\nRight about here is where her rather large Akita smells the bacon grease, and starts chowing down on the closest mess. \n\nCL- Stop it! Don't eat that! And starts tugging on the leash. \n\nDog realizes that all the piles taste good, and proceeds to literally drag CL down the street from pile to pile, cleaning up two months worth of piles the whole way despite protests from CL. \n\nThe lesson? Don't be a lazy dog owner on our street. \n\nAn obligatory \"Spay and neuter your pets folks.\"\n\nEdited for formatting.\n\nSecond edit: No, this doesn't hurt the dog. Dogs will eat turds all day long if you don't stop them, and they'll lick their own asses all day no mater what you do to try and stop them. Their physiology actually allows them to gain nutrients from fecal matter, and if it's too much, they'll puke it up. Usually on the carpet, or your new couch, as most of us doggo friends can attest.

So we chased down the driver and politely told him the situation and he refused to help us out.\n\nPissed off we drove right to the establishment ourselves and i waited outside. My buddy asked for the manager and apparently he refused to change the pizza stating that the guy taking the orders doesn't make mistakes.\n\nSo over a pizza, my friend called the cops lol By the time the cops show up I'm still outside and my friend and the manager come flying out the door onto the ground. Apparently the guy tried to take the phone away when calling the police.\n\nWhile all this is happening my friends brand new jacket was torn, sleeve right off.\n\nLong story short the cops say there's nothing they can do and there's no proof of assault. We go home defeated, no pizza.\n\nI thought it was all over until a week later my buddy is chilling in the student union and told me to take a seat next to him.\n\nApparently he made a fake phone number online (idk how that works) and he had 100 large pizzas delivered to the union. We sat there and watched, especially as the phone blew up.\n\nWhy the restaurant delivered 100 pizzas without taking payment or a deposit first is still a mystery to me to this day.\n\nTo this day we still have the voicemails left by the restaurant saying they're going to \"press charges\".\n\nhe comes to my house for christmas every year, and every year, we play the voicemail at the dinner table before eating.\n\nThe restaurant is now permanently closed.",

        "text": "When I was in high school, I had a pretty high GPA and was in a close contest with another girl for valedictorian. This girl cheated on so many assignments/tests to get ahead and would pretend she didn't really care about her GPA. She would always act surprised when class rank was published and she was at the top (or when I was at the top for a couple of semesters, she would rant about it to her friends while publicly acting unaffected and cheat more to get ahead). \n\nAnyways, she got caught cheating on an AP final- not the College Board exam, just the class final. She had obtained the answers to the final in advance somehow and emailed them to her friends ON HER SCHOOL EMAIL. The principal was notified and instead of giving her some sort of fair punishment for cheating on a final, he claimed there was insufficient evidence to determine if she cheated/ which of her friends had also cheated. (side note: her parents are pretty big names in our small town, which I suspect influenced his decision) He decided to make the entire 3 sections of this class retake the final, including the girl who cheated, for an opportunity at full credit. This girl got to retake the final without grade penalty and spent 5 days in in-school suspension.\n\nShe ended up graduating as valedictorian and I as salutatorian. On graduation day, the top two are required to go up and make speeches and receive plaques from the principal. I went up, made my speech, got my plaque, and went home. Upon closer inspection at a later date, I realized the plaque had a typo: SALUTETORIAN rather than SALUTATORIAN. I laughed and showed my parents, and my dad suggested I email the school district to get a replacement one. So I emailed the main office and cc'd the principal on the email with a picture of the misspelling, with something along the lines of, \"check this out.\" I got an email back with a curt apology and what was basically an order to bring it back to the school while they procured a replacement one with the correct spelling. I replied with, \"nah, I'll keep it because I feel this is pretty representative of my high school career.\" I got like two or three more emails from the office and then the principal with increasingly pleading undertones to replace the plaque (because they didn't want it to reflect badly on the school and administration).\n\nI didn't answer the emails, invited school board members and senior-status teachers to my graduation party, and displayed the plaque with the misspelling in a very prominent place at the party. You can bet I made sure the board members and teachers saw it.",

I’m sure most of you are familiar with what is required as an employee so I’ll skip that.  \n\nMy manager was a decent individual.  Let’s call her Tea.  Now Tea wanted to make sure that the customers were as pleased as possible.  You achieve this by being as polite and smile as much as possible. Based on Tea’s perspective.\n\nThe mentality that the costumer is always right.   In some ways this was good, in other ways this was bad. \n\nThis story revolves around it being bad. We have a policy that cops get an at cost discount for the food they order at subway.  \n\nYou are talking about  1.50 for a foot long sub.  I don’t know what it would cost now, but 15 years ago it was cheep. With this in mind we get the same group of cops who come in every day same time 4pm.  \n\nIt’s about 3:50pm.  Enter in John.  John was real drunk. I mean barley walk kinda drunk.   \n\nOp “ Hello sir welcome to subway what can I get for you?”\n\nJohn “Get me? Ugh get me what?” \n\nOp “we have many things available... if you....”\n\nJohn “Don’t interrupt me boy I was talking.  You Fing kids are the reason America is going to hell.” \n\nNow I have been warned by Tea.  That I will be punished or even fired if I don’t give the absolute best costumer service no matter what. \n\nOP” Of course sir I just can’t help it, I’m the devils weapon!!” I gesture my hand in a good old boy or good job.\n\nJohn “ Good you see that boy.  Learn some respect.  Give me a sandwich.”\n\nOP “Of course sir what kind?”\n\nJohn “Are you retarded?!!  There is only one kind, it’s called the subway sandwich!!”\n\nI look t the clock and it’s 3:55. This guy is driving me insane.  I know if the cops come they will deal with him.  I just need to waste his time.  \n\nOP “Oh of course sir.  I forget that I’m causing America to go to hell, I can’t help but just be trouble.”\n\nJohn laughs out loud. “You kids are so stupid you can’t even deny it.”  Laughs even harder.  \n\nI pretend to laugh bulging my eyes out like some kind of crazed killer. My face turning red as I force the laughter louder and louder till he stops.  \n\nOP “Let me start working on that Subways sandwich for you.”\n\nI look up at the clock and see it’s 3:59.  One more minute.  I start to make the sandwich making as much eye contact as I can with the most absurd wide face smile I can.\n\nJohn “You got a staring problem boy?  I don’t like how you are looking at me wipe that smile off your Fing face.”\n\nOP “sir I can’t I must provide the happiest smile to ensure you feel satisfied with our service.”  \n\nI bust my face even wider than before.  Even exaggerating my eye brows like I’m a clown.\n\nAll the while I’m making a club sandwich double meat chicken Brest.  Out shredded cheese on it.  Then placing it in the toaster.  Never removing eye contact.  \n\nThe toaster beeps I pull down slide the tray in and place it on the counter all in one smooth motion.  \n\nJohn “I said stop Fing looking at me.  I’ll fucking cut you if you don’t stop.”  \n\nOP “Of course sir customer service is important to me I don’t want you to think i would do anything to hinder your ability to enjoy your time here.”  \n\nI put on Lettuce, Tomato’s, salt, pepper, oregano.  Single line of mayo, single line of ranch.  Fold it up cut it in half.  Then wrap it.\n\nThe door opens bell rings and in comes the cops. \n\nJohn doesn’t even notice them come in. “It’s about Fing time you finished give me my damn sandwich you white trash piece of shit!!” \n\nOP “Oh I’m sorry sir this isn’t your sandwich this is mine. Omg fact it’s my favorite (Subway Sandwich.) \n\nI unwrap it in front of him and take a Huge bite.  He grabs me by the arm and tries to pull me over the counter.\n\nJohn “I’m going to cut you boy!!”\n\nThe cops jump right in and pin him down.\n\nPolice “Op what’s going on here?”  \n\nI explain what has transpired.  They decided to charge while with public intoxication.  He is arrested, and put into the car.  \n\nThe officers return,  I make them their sandwich.  They sit and eat there for 45 minutes.  Before they take him to the station.\n\nTL:DR Drunk guy comes into subway becomes belligerent wants a sandwich I make my own instead.  He gets arrested.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Had all the tree's taken down from the yard and the one tree's roots were into the basement walls and tl;dr had to knock the house down and rebuild a brand new house.  Awful.  \n\nIn order to save money I didn't have My uncle and I became the general contractors and subbed out much of the work.  And then there was the HVAC guy.  He sucked.  It turned out he was a drunk.  Everyday I would show up after work and see that he was gone by 4, had drank a 30 pack and left the cans all over the job site, and never cleaned up.  His workers quit on him, and eventually he stopped showing up.  \n\nNow the correct way to pay the sub contractors is 1/3 up front, 1/3 at halfway, 1/3 completion of job - meaning we walk through what they did together and make sure everything works. Well HVAC stopped showing up after second job payment.  I ended up finishing a bunch of stuff myself and having another HVAC guy finish up the work.  If you've never had to build you'll find that almost all contractors do NOT want to finish someone else's work for various reasons.  I get it.  Fine.  \n\nI never see Original HVAC guy again but his work truck is parked over by my gym.  Well all these years ago Crossfit started at the gym and I took a swig of the Kool-Aid; I know it was ridiculous but I did it for a few years as I found it motivating even though the whole premise is beyond ridiculous.  So the CF running route would take you past the local town dive bar...where apparently HVAC drank.  He must have seen me one summer day running with the CF crew and showed up at my house drunk and asked me to buy his at the time older Toyota Camry.  I shit you not.  I told him no and to leave and he did.  \n\nWinter comes and he shows up at my door drunk and irate demanding I pay him for the work he did, except he never finished the job, it's been 7 years plus since he stumbled off the site to never return.  I told him no and he left.  He showed up again a few weeks later and scared the hell out of my mother.  Yelling at her and such.  Then again at the end of winter he showed up banging on my door.  I got my P30 and put it in my belt a la Plaxico and went to the door, I open the door and he says where's my money? I look at him to tell him I am going to count to 3 GTFO and don't come back or I am calling the cops.  He begrudgingly leaves threatening me and my home...I threaten back him, his home, his work truck, and his family.  \n\nIt's over or so I assumed, but come summer time I am running with the CF crew and now I am being heckled?  By whom...oh yeah HVAC is at the bar standing outside.  I let it go.  Day 2 it happens again.  Day 3 he comes flying up the road at me in his Camry yelling and speeds away.  Well Day 4 he tries his same shit with the Camry except I am prepared.  I casually move out of the way, then surprise there is traffic and he hits the light.  I calmly jog over to his car which is stopped in front of the bar with his crew of 5 or so drunk morons sitting outside.  I put my hand on the car and I say to him: \"I don't like you, you're a drunk townie Piece of Shit like this crew of morons here\" I point at them realizing exactly what I am doing.  I said \"you and they are literally the worst of the worst human beings; so here is what is happening.  You will stop with the words, the heckling, coming to my home, looking at me or my family or friends and that goes for all of you or else.\"  He toughs guys up and laughs and goes or else what?  \"Or else I call 911 and report a drunk driver endangering children and give them your license plate; if you're not around I'll just report one of them and their car, I know who you are, you're all always drunk do you think you can pass a breathalyzer?

        "text": "This happened a few years ago. The apartment my wife and I lived in was quite small and had thin walls but we were top floor and on the end so only one neighbor that could bother us. It was vacant for the first few months. Then our neighbor moved in. I guess I didn’t even have any conflicts with him and he seemed like a nice enough guy. And then the girlfriend started coming over. \n\nThey liked to have sex very loudly. The apartments were the same layout so our bedrooms bordered each other. After this happening a few times, I was kind of tired of listening to him and his girlfriend have sex. \n\nOne night, I was especially annoyed and just wanted to relax in bed but the two of them were loudly boning next door. This is when I came up with the bright idea to hook my speaker up to my computer, face the speaker to the wall, and play the monster mash on repeat. Why the monster mash? It was the weirdest song I could think of. And this thing was right against the wall. I stepped out of the room after I set it up so I know they could hear it better than I could. I let it go for over 30 minutes. Probably close to an hour. They were a lot quieter after that...\n\nAnd if you don’t think this is revenge, I challenge you to try to have any sexy thoughts whatsoever while listening to the Monster Mash. \n\nTLDR: Neighbor kept boning his girlfriend really loudly so I played the Monster Mash even louder to kill their mood.

        "text": "This happened a few years ago when I still did gigs and shows. Meanwhile life intervened and priorities changed, but I still get the chuckles when I think back on that evening.  \n  \nI was part of a small \"band\" that played psychedelic afrobeat just for fun, and was without any core members. Just a bunch of people, who knew a repertoire of 6 songs, and whoever showed up played on those jams, with then the audience joining after the \"set\" was over. While I'm a bassplayer, we already had someone who played bass (and played it really well), so I took on the rhythm guitar, which is not my prime instrument, but I can hold my own.  \n  \nThe lead guitarist, who was a friend of the drummer and the twins who played the saxophones could really play well, and had some pretty expensive &amp; good guitars from top-of-the-line A-brands (Fender, Gibson, PRS, Gretsch,...). He came from a wealthy family, studied music, and the parents did sponsor generously, each show it seemed he came with a new guitar. Since guitar wasn't my prime instrument, I just had \"a solid, reliable and decent guitar\" from a B-brand, a Korean Epiphone Sorrento. Not dirt-cheap, but certainly not expensive either. The same for the amplifier: it was a small &amp; easy to haul tube amp. Nothing spectacular, but it got the job done.   \n  \nWhenever we set up our stuff, and that lead guitarist was also playing, most of the time he was \"oh man, you brought that cheap POS again? Why don't you buy something *decent* for a change\". I just shrugged it off, and always said \"if it ain't broken, don't fix it\". During the shows, when he was playing his leads in the spotlight (which were mainly boring pentatonic patterns with the cliché bend in it), he would at times turn his head around, look at me, shake his head and then say \"damn, you sound like shit\".  \n  \nIt didn't bother me, since he was the only one who was complaining about my sound. But since he decided I needed to up my gear, I upped my gear, and he would know.  \n  \nA few weeks before the faithful evening, I heard him say how \"If I could, I'd sell all my guitars, and get that one axe I've always craved, an original 1959 Gibson ES-355\". He then went on to rave about the old wood, the special pickups, how it was a stereo-guitar,... he raved on about it for hours, showing pictures online of comparable guitars for sale. I knew everything about it already.  \n  \nA friend of a friend, who is also an acquaintance of me, collects guitars, and has an absolute metric ton of them. All vintage, all from famous brands and all VERY expensive. A few weeks after previous paragraph, I ended up at his place, together with my friend, drooling over his stuff, and via-via I told him about that lead guitarist who wanted that ES-355, and how he belittled my gear.  \nThe acquaintance said: \"hey Fingers, see that brown case over there? Yeah, that one. Go over there, pull it out and look inside\". So I took that case, sat it on my lap an opened it. Inside was... An original early 1960 Gibson ES-355. One year younger than the Holy Grail, but to all intents and purposes identical. The acquaintance then said: \"you know what? I don't use that guitar that much, why don't you take it with you, and **you** do the next gig with it. Just be careful, and replace the strings if you like\".  \n  \nFast forward to the next weekend. The obnoxious lead guitarist was setting up his rig, and he using his modern Gibson ES-335 (a modern and slimmed-down version of the 355). So I nonchalantly placed that worn brown case on the stage together with my gigbag (containing the trusty Sorrento), returned to grab my stands and started setting up my stuff. When I spoke with the lead guitarist, who by then was already eyeing the case, I nonchalantly said: \"yeah, got my some new strings man\", to which I opened the case, took out that old 355 and placed it in its stand, and then locked it. His eyes almost fell out of their sockets, and his jaw hit the ground so hard it cracked some hardwood planks... \"I... is... is that a... 59?\". \"No, it's a 60, tyvm\".  \n  \nAfter he recovered from the initial shock, with his best puppy eyes, he ~~asked~~ begged me if he could play it, to which I replied I'd rather have him not.  \n  \nThe jamsession opened, we did our routine, and all the time the leadguitarist was distracted by that old guitar standing 2 meters from him. Meanwhile I switched between playing my cheap Sorrento and old 355, grinning from time to time when his eyes started to wander. Shaken by disbelief he asked me why I didn't use the 355 exclusively? I said I liked the Sorrento better, and that it didn't sit in the way of his lead-sound. So that 355 remained on its stand for most of the evening, securely locked. When the evening drew to a close, I put it back in its case, and told everyone I need to be home quite fast, so I couldn't hang around for some drinks. If acute depression had a look, it would have been the face of that lead guitarist when he learned he wouldn't get to play that 355.  \n  \nThe following weeks he kept pestering me about that guitar, and why I only used it one evening. I said I liked my Sorrento better in terms of weight, sound and playing (by then I had already given back that 355 back to its rightful owner).  \n  \nAfter a few months, I encountered the love of my life, and moved to a different part of the country, so my jam-days were over. And that 355, while an absolute looker of a guitar, it didn't sound *that* spectacularly and it was quite hard to play.  \n  \nTLDR: cocky lead guitarists belittles me for my cheaper guitar, so I found his absolute dream instrument, and brought it along for him to look at, while continuing to play my cheap instrument.  \n  \nEDIT: to add, the leadguitarist was not a true member of the band. He just showed up on the jams to play along and to have some backing for his solo's. He did \"donate\" an amp though that people could use, so he was not actually malicious or so in any way.\n  \n",

It's been 10 days and no ones come to fix it and its knocked out everything for most people who live on the street. They have a telephone hotline but to save money it's now completely automated and you can only file one repair claim per account. Follow ups aren't permitted. So we visited the office last week - no luck. So we go again today but this time I was fed up. As we were waiting for them to call us I notice a sticky note with ALL of the wifi info on it. Just out in the open. I'm not a mastermind when it comes to this stuff but I know my shit. I notice they have 3 wifi routers in the building so I decide to log into my VPN on my phone and connect to their fiber line (the fastest).\n\nOriginally I just wanted internet so it would be less boring while I wait but after our number got called and they basically told us to fuck off I was done. I was so fucking tired of their shit. So I log into their routers console and change the password to a randomly generated one and change the wifi name to \"FixMyWifiAndIFixYours\"\n\nNow I only bricked their fastest wifi (the same kind we have) they have 2 slower connections still to help others but now they cant use their fiber. It's a small thing but I watched them all scratch their heads and switch to the slower connection as I walked out.\n\nAnyway. We just got a call and we have a repair man on the way. Once he fixes our line I'll go restore their settings.\n\nLet's see what happens.\n\nUntil then. Am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: They had the DEFAULT log ins for their console. An internet company. A fucking ISP had \"Admin\" \"1234\" as their log in info. All I had to do was google it.\n\nI changed that info too.",

My daughter attended the school for a full year without problems, then 3 months into the second school year they claim we don't live there.

We got this letter literally on the way out of town for a family vacation which we had to cut short in order to get back in time to try and sort it out.\n\nDespite us having a folder FULL of papers with our names and that address, they claimed that because we owned a property in another county that we could not send our kids to that school anymore. We had just paid for an upcoming field trip (11.50) which I, of course, called the school and demanded a refund on. They mailed a check, but then I continued to \"misplace\" or \"never receive\" until the end of the next school year.

If a person can't go in, all they really have to do is call the manager and let them know or ask their (one other) coworker to go in for them. Our office is also in the same building as a hotel, and my one other coworker besides my manager works for the hotel as well. A lot of times they'll work at the hotel front desk and then swing by our office and work for a couple of hours right afterwards. \n\nOne day I was really, really sick. I don't drive so I'm forced to ride my bike to work, and I just felt way too sick to do so. I called my manager and asked her if she could just work the rest of the day, but unfortunately she had plans. So, I resorted to texting my coworker who was working the hotel front desk at the time. I asked them if they could swing by the office and work for me. They were very hesitant and I could tell that they were trying to come up with an excuse, so I just asked if they could cover an hour and a half of my shift and I'd come in for the end of the shift. They told me that they're supposed to work at the front desk until late but they'd let me know, but then it was a half and hour before my shift and I still hadn't heard anything. I figured that the hotel manager wouldn't let them leave or something, so I wasn't too upset. I hopped on my bike and rode sluggishly to work. \n\nHowever, when I arrived there was a different worker at the front desk. I asked the worker where my coworker was, and was told that they had left a little bit ago. I was so upset; not only did they ignore me but they lied to me! They totally could have taken pity on my very sick self and worked in the office for an hour and a half. Let's just say that I've been less than pleased with them ever since then. \n\nNow today I had a short shift in the morning, and that one coworker was supposed to come in this afternoon. Around noon I got a text from them saying that they \"got a little too drunk last night accidentally\" and they \"feel completely awful today\". They said that they were extremely hungover and wanted me to work for them. \n\nI said that I was \"soooo sorry\", but I had plans with my family after my shift and I couldn't work all afternoon. \n\nI didn't have any plans. :) ",

So the conversation goes as follows:\n\nMe: \"OK great, when are you needing this to arrive by?\"\n\nGuest: \"Tomorrow.\"\n\nMe: \"Unfortunately tomorrow is not possible.  We are on Monday's business day right now for shipping, so the earliest it could arrive would be by Tuesday.\"\n\nGuest: \"Then why the fuck did you ask?\"\n\nMe: \"...\" (Paused for a good 5 seconds to think really hard about what comes out of my mouth next)\n\nMe: \"There is generally several options for shipping, we could do Tuesday at the absolute fastest.\"\n\nGuest: \"It is what it is, I don't have a choice, do I?\"\n\nThis is where the petty revenge comes into play.  Now any normal person would of said \"Ah dang when was the last cutoff for Monday\", or \"What are my fastest options then\", I don't know, anything else would of been normal.  \n\nSo we have 2 options for shipping.  We have a standard rate which is generally used for people with shipping accounts, and they provide a good discount depending on their account contracts.  The 2nd option we have is a One Rate option - this is reserved specifically for non-account holders and anyone shipping in our white packaging.  These provide a much much cheaper rate.  Standard Rate was $14 more than the FedEx One rate.  I am not obligated to give the customer the One Rate unless they ask for it.  So this guest paid $14 more for being a thundercunt, and I felt great about it.  Is this petty?",

        "text": "Here's my petty revenge story, not as dramatic as some entries are, but I think it's funny.\n\nDuring my first year of high school I was bullied by my classmates, I wasn't ganged up on but still I was pretty much ignored, snobbed away and sometimes mocked. My sense of isolation made me feel uncomfortable and my grades suffered to the point that toward the end it was clear I would fail the year and it was too late to make up for it so it was pretty much set.  \nOn the day I received the news, I was having lunch with all my family: my parents and my older brother and sister.\n\nEveryone knew it was going to happen and that it didn't have to do just with my focus and drive so they were pretty understanding and comforting. Except my sister. She stood up, put her hands on my shoulders and sang out in a cheerful tone:\"Here's the only member of the family who failed school!\" (my parents and my brother all have a degree, my sister doesn't because she got a decent job straight away after high school).  \n14 year old me could sense that no one thought it was funny. When she left my parents said that she was just trying to minimize it and keep it cool and no one bothered too much with it. But it hurt my pride, and however silly it was, I did not forget.\n\nAfter summer I enrolled at a new school to strart fresh, I got along with my new classmates and finished high school with good grades. After that I went to university and got a degree too.\n\nI know it's common on graduation day in many places to throw huge parties, but where I'm from it's customary to have an intimate dinner with your family.\n\nIt had been 5 years of high school ever since. Plus 3 years of university. 8 fucking years. As everyone sat at the table, I stood up, walked around the table to where my sister sat, put my hands on her shoulders and sang out in a cheerful tone:\"Here's the only member of the family who didn't go to university!\"  \nEveryone exchanged confused looks. No one remembered obviously. But I did. And BOY did I feel satisfied. My life was complete. \n\nAs a side note, I know that having a degree means nothing, both my parents have jobs completely unrelated to their field of study and as a matter of fact my sister has a better job than I do (although she's way older).

        "text": "Idk if this kind of revenge would be allowed, but I want to get this off my chest.\n\nLast school year, I was in a Spanish class that was a mix of juniors and seniors. I was a junior myself, and I had this classmate who I shall call David.\n\nDavid was disliked by a lot of people because he was a \"nice bully\", where he ridicules me but in a nice way (if that makes sense). For example, he would obnoxiously call my name out in class. As a shy guy with social anxiety, I would get really embarrassed.\n\nOne day, my teacher was talking about preparations for a school festival where students would perform. She asked if anyone would like to perform, and David said loudly \"MATTANOARK LIKES TO SING\". Everyone was laughing and even the teacher joined in.\n\nWell, I was super pissed off. I tolerated enough of his loud remarks and I was fuming. The whole week I just wanted to beat the crap out of him, but I held my fire.\n\nMy school hosted an event celebrating Pi Day a few days later, where people would get \"pied\" in the face with a plate of whipped cream for a dollar. And wouldn't you know it, David was selected to be one of the people to be pied.\n\nI attended the event and brought 5 dollars with me. I saw him sitting on a chair with goggles on, waiting to be pied, and thus began my master plan.\n\nI bought my first pie, and while David was talking to someone else, I snuck up on him and hit him hard with the pie. He was caught off guard, and even got some in his ear. But oh no, we are nowhere done here, pal.\n\nOne dollar down, four to go.\n\nI then bought two pies secretly. I went up to David, all innocently, with only one pie. I just smushed it in David's face inconspicuously. However, while he was wiping the cream off his face, I quickly ran back to the other pie I had, sprinted up to David and hit him with the pie. By now, everyone was howling with laughter.\n\nThree dollars down, two to go.\n\nDavid was getting annoyed, but I still had more in store for him. I gave a friend a dollar and asked him to buy a pie. I secretly bought a pie for myself. My friend walked up to David and pied him all normally, but then I ran behind him and up to David. This time I smacked him in the head full force, enough to make him fall off his chair. In retrospect, I probably was too violent there (and it could be considered assault) but I was in the zone. Everyone was shrieking with laughter and I was beaming.\n\nDavid was fine, but he left me alone after that.\n\nTL;DR Upperclassman pisses me off in class, I get payback my creaming over his face",

I was required to keep a spreadsheet for all the medical visits, etc. of the inmates.  The spreadsheet was a very important part of the monthly meeting with the sheriff. It was on my computer when I started and I never moved it.  The medical director showed me how to find it.\n\nThe medical director was fired a few weeks before me, and a new one was hired.  The new one and I worked well together, and I wasn't worried about my job. I worked on the stats every day and kept the spreadsheet up to date.  One day, before the monthly meeting, I was fired.  I gathered all my stuff and was escorted out of the building.\nA week later, the head nurse (not the medical director) called me.  I got along with B very well and considered her a friend. She wanted to know where to find the stats for the monthly meeting because they weren't easy to find. Despite her being my friend, I knew it was the medical director who needed it.\nI told B that I couldn't tell her.  Petty, but revenge.\n\nEdit: The first medical director was fired bc she was terrible at her job.  I was fired for a justifiable reason (I took too many smoke breaks).  I never said it was unfair.  I also said that I knew B was only calling me because the new medical director needed the information, not B.  Apparently I was wrong about thinking the new director and I got along.  She fired me.  I was completely unwilling to help her with anything.  I didn't work there anymore, why did you call me?\n",

        "text": "So to preface this I should have seen the signs during my weld test there. The guy who administered it was a hmmm Asshole. I asked how big a weld he wanted he didn’t say. I put down a weld first words out of his mouth was that’s too small smh ok. The welder they tested me on was older them me 34 at the time. Now good welder are usually cocky. I’m not different I’m good I k ow it but I know there’s better. I build bulldozers for big yellow for 12 years. I know how to weld. \n\nWe negotiated after the weld tester said I could weld. He wanted me T low pay and on second shift. I said I refuse second shift and I wanted more money. If you can’t meet that I understand I don’t necessarily need this job.  He then said he had a shipping manager position open instead paid a little less. But in my eyes I could pad my resume with manager experience so I said yea. He said well we hire through a temp service go fill out app. We settled on money because this wasn’t a production shop. Some days I’d do busy work some days weld was like ok. \n\n\nI get a call that evening telling me to show up tomorrow with my weld gear. I was like we didn’t negotiate that we talked about shipping manager. He said well I need welder more. I said ok I want this price  and we settled on a pay. Not my ideal pay but was steady money. Well I show up early the next day a Friday. I always a early type guy I walk in with 20 minutes before shift starts. He immediately tells me\nHey start helping this guy do this. Not wanting to look bad on first day I jumped in to work.  Then A hour later I started working on drilling holes in metal ok no problem. Here to do what I can. \n\nWell eventually I started welding later small project. I ran out of shielding gas. So I asked lead guy hey can I borrow you crescent wrench to change this out. Being my first day I only brought my essentials. He blurred out it better find it’s fucking way back. Now I was literally working 5 ft from him, and was like ok and internally rolled my eyes. I asked where was rank cart. These are typically dolls with a chain to take the gas tanks outside and grab a full one. These are osha required because they don’t want them falling over they can and will turn into missiles if valve is snapped off. He snapped at me again we don’t have one carry it out yourself. Again internal eye roll and did it not wanting to cause waves on my first day. \n\nThen they moved me to working on a frame for robot base. Assembling it in a jig and welding a few spots. Well the plates were covered in coolant and they didn’t have anything to clean them and refused so I used my own rags. But there was no MSDS again another osha violation. That’s two if your counting. Then I watch them require a few guys to weld on stainless steel. Now for none welders this creates what is call hexavalent chromium a toxic gas if enough is consumed. \n\nWell after I was welding them for a couple of hours I was doing about 7 a hour. The lead welder walked over and talked to boss then they walked up to me. He said well you talked a big game yesterday. I was like ? He said well and good welder would be doing 9 a hour instead you’re doing 7. I said well my first time working on these and I want to make sure I did them correctly. Quality takes time any welder will tell you this is true. I said well for one this isn’t a production shop, two I’m not working with lead welder he’s a fucking asshole I’m a grown man and won’t be talked to like that for simply asking questions. Especially if this is on first day. I said I will finish the shift and not return. He said ok at end of day he showed me where to mark down my time. We write it in on paper. I said 6:45 but he wrote down 7. I corrected him said no as soon as I walked in you put me to work. He disagreed till I had another employee say yea true.  So he corrected it on sheet. \n\nThe end of shift a front office guy asked how my first day went? I said it’s also my last, lead welder is too difficult to work with and I’m not dealing with that at my age. Especially on my first day it’s only gonna get worse. His comment back shocked me. He’s like yea he runs off quite a few guys often. I was like that’s a problem if you can’t keep talented welders because of him. You have to decide do you need a bunch of good welders or his arrogant ass. \n\n\nShowed up the next Wednesday to get my check damn if he didn’t short me that 15 minutes. Now I was like nope screw it so I told the temp agency hey these are violations I saw and guess what your responsible if employee gets hurt because technically your the employer. He wrote everything down and went into his bosses office as I left. Then in the car I called OSHA and told them the violations I saw. \n\nTook them a few months but they finally called me back, and said hey we didn’t see any of those violations on our inspection but we did see others. \nOk I said mail me the report. I received it this week. It had 4 different violations all serious. One for fork truck being unsafe to operate. Then 3 others dealing with the gas off of stainless steel welding. Totaling just shy of 15,000$. Now that 15 minuet would have been 4$ but I felt it was the principle of the matter. \n\nNow I’m sure they will try and negotiate those fines down and mostly likely will and succeed. But having OSHA in is a huge pain in the ass for any company because if they see it they can write it up. It was simple don’t treat people like shit and and short them on pay it tends to piss them off royally. \n\n\nTD;LR  fab shop treated me like crap and shorted me 15 minutes pay got them fined 15,000$ by osha. \n\n",

Luckily I live nearby and are able to teach them/watch over them to make sure nothing happens. One day my grandparents told me about a particularly horrifying call, where the scammer pretended to be my cousin in the hospital, begging them to wire some money so he could pay his bills. It really shook my grandparents up. From there, I made it my mission to waste all scammers' time.\n\nI personally seem to get calls from the same 5 - 10  scammers over and over again. I usually play along and answer their questions, giving them fake information. I can make these calls last up to 20 minutes now, which is fine because I'm usually playing video games when I answer their calls and can multitask anyways. Most of the time when they realize I'm playing, they get angry and tell me to f\\*\\*\\* off. A year in, some scammers will actually recognize my voice now, go \"oh shit its you\" and hang up immediately. In addition, I have reduced my monthly scam call volume by over 60% (actually did the math).\n\nIf you get a call from a scammer, play along and waste their time (just don't waste yours).",

Also of note, this car park has one permanent ‘in’ lane, one ‘out’ lane, and one swing lane that they can change from in to out depending on whether more people are coming or going.\n\nThis morning I reached the car park and cruised up to the ‘in’ gate.  I was just coming to a stop and rolling my window down when I noticed Arsehole Tradie (AT) come racing up to the ‘swing’ gate.  It was immediately apparent that he was hoping to get his ticket before I got mine so that he could drive in ahead of me, and I’m not THAT keen to park and go to work, so he was successful.  He charged through the gates and began speeding up the ramps to the casual levels.\n\nMy gate opened and I drove in, shaking my head at the minuscule time saving AT had made.  \n\nI proceeded up the ramps, and on level two was met with the beautiful sight of AT’s taillights.. he may have beaten me through the gates, but was now trapped behind a total slowpoke, who carried on up five levels of car park at what can only be described as a snail’s pace.  I could almost feel AT’s rage building.\n\nEventually we got to the casual levels, and slowpoke takes the time to carefully reverse into a space before finally the coast is clear for AT to park his ute and get on his merry way.\n\nNow, I should mention at this point that I’m an absolute gun at reversing into car spaces.  Such a champ, it turns out, that I actually had my car parked and was already halfway to the lift by the time AT was done parking.\n\nwhich meant that I arrived at the lifts just as it arrived.\n\nwhich meant that I got in the lift and looked back through the door to see AT running to try to catch the lift.\n\nwhich meant that the last thing AT saw as the lift doors closed without him was my smiling face as I pulled a circle sign at him.\n\nTL;DR Tradie tries to shave milliseconds off his commute by pushing ahead of me at bar park entrance.  gets stuck behind slow poke, then sadly misses the lift.\n",

So I turned my high beams on and kept them on.  If he's going to be a dick and blind me, I might as well return the favor.

Ironic that he tried to blind me with his high beams by shutting if the thing that was actually blinding me.  \n\nIf you don't know, having any kind or light bar turn on while driving on almost every road is illegal.  The only exceptions are for firefighter and police responding in their personal vehicles, but those will be colored.  Anyway, I highly recommend reporting people blinding other drivers with their lightbars, that shit needs to stop.  The ridiculous micro-star powered LED headlights that almost every manufacturer are going to already blind everyone are bad enough.",

The car refused to pull into the slow lane, going along just under the speed limit. Over the next few kilometres, the cars between me and the convertible moved across until I was right behind it, and noticed it was top down with two older women dressed like they were going to a music festival - overalls, straw hats, heaps of beads. \n\nAgain they were still in the fast lane, and when the opportunity came for me to get in the slow lane and overtake I tried to take it, but they see me and sped up to block me behind a truck that we had caught up too. I'm not sure why they felt the need to do that, but it was game on bitches. \n\nI moved in behind them again and waited. At the next place I could pass, they sped up again but due to the traffic pattern, they ended up getting stuck themselves while I got in front and they pulled in behind me.\n\nInspiration struck. They were top down and I had a full reservoir of windscreen washing fluid. I washed my windscreen for a full 3 minutes, doing 100km/h on a motorway with all the water flicking of my car and onto theirs. They couldn't slow down as they now had cars behind them, and they couldn't move out of the lane either. I could see the water hitting their windscreen and it must have been hitting them too in the car.\n\nBe inconsiderate and drive slow in the fast lane? Enjoy your free shower.",

        "text": "So this is by far one of my favorite stories to tell. This is the story of the mother of one of my childhood friends. We’ll call this mom Karen. \n\nOne day back when her kids were still in elementary school, she was driving around the mall parking lot the week of Christmas. After what felt like hours of listening to the twins complaining in the back seat, she finally managed to find a car backing out of a spot right by the entrance. She turned her signal on, waited, and just like that another car swiped the spot from her. Pushed to her edge, Karen went off on this woman. The woman got out of her car and things escalated quickly. Passerby’s called the authorities, but not after the woman had repeatedly hit Karen in the face with her keys, while her children laid witness in the back of the car. It was not a pretty sight. \n\nWhen the police came for questioning and they both told their sides of the story, the woman kept refuting that she did not use her keys to hit Karen, and that the scratches must have just been self induced. An officer told Karen to clean up while they take the woman’s statement, so she went to her car to retrieve her purse. And what did she find there? The Mother. Fucking. Keys. Being the boss she is, Karen decided to take the keys with her. She waltzed into the Olive Garden across the parking lot, cleaned herself up in the bathroom, and flushed those fuckers down the toilet. \n\nShe returned to find that the woman had been frantically looking for her keys, when suddenly she accused Karen of having them. \n\n“Well I’m sorry, if you didn’t hit me with your keys in hand, how could I have gotten a hold of them?”\n\n\nEDIT: I’ve seen upvotes on a comment asking how the keys ended up in the car. Karen was being hit with them while in her car, so the keys must have landed in the car during the altercation. There’s no way Karen could have gotten them unless the lady had been using them. Which is why the ending line is great: the woman either has to admit she gave a false statement and used her keys, or she had to stop accusing Karen of having them. \n\nAlso saw some “what happened next” questions, and to be honest this is always where they ended the story, so I’m really not sure. I don’t know what the woman’s reaction to Karen’s statement is. In terms of arrests, I’ve always assumed any charges were dropped, given that they both engaged in the fight and no one was too severally damaged (though obviously Karen was more injured than the other woman)",

        "text": "Premera (pt's insurance, WA resident) will only contract with in-state providers, but they have a contract with Blue Cross of Idaho (my state) for Idaho providers to send claims to BCI and process as in-network, this is a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO). \n\nMy patient has an Affordable Care Act policy selected on the \"exchange\", (I have not investigated how the exchange works). This is called an Exclusive Provider Organization (EPO). The EPO is only good for in WA state and is not eligible for the Premera-BCI contract. However, Idaho providers can file a Benefit Level Exeption (BLE)- essentially to make exceptions.\n\nI can see Washington from my Idaho office, we are both right on the border, makes sense for pt to come to my office for services instead of driving two hours north or south for services (my service is for EVERYDAY treatments). \n\nAdditionally, Premera contracts with a third party to do all the authorizations for my services. So, third party is only acting on Premera's orders and keeps denying my auth requests. I call Premera and they keep telling me to file through the third party.\n\nPremera, \"file through third party.\"\nThird Party, \"denied.\"\n\nBut, this patient has been getting services in Idaho for many many months now, but these services do not go through the third party, but directly through Premera.\n\nPremera auth'd BLE for the consult but are now denying a BLE for actual treatment. \n\nI submit YET ANOTHER BLE directly to Premera. They kick back another denial. I call on it. They say, \"Oh, that was an automatic fax, disregard.\" Disregarded.  An hour later I get another letter that reads (summarized):\n        \" Please send the requested clinical documents:\n           ...\n            ...\"\n\nTHEY ASKED FOR DOCUMENTS AND THEN DIDN'T LIST THE DOCUMENTS!\n\nSo, I called them. They say, \"Oh that was sent in error. Disregard.\" I asked to speak to clinical review, \"Oh, yeah it seems we only got the first page of the request.\"\n\"Well, this is conflicting information than the other person gave me.\"\n\"Please send in the rest of the documents to this number.\"\n\"This is a different number than is listed on the request.\"\n\"You can send to either.\"\n\nThe revenge:\nI send all the information to both numbers. Numerous times. Each time I got a confirmation that the fax was successful- didn't matter, continued to send. Because, you know, just because it was successful on my end doesn't mean it was successful on theirs. We are talking 100+ pages of records to both lines, many many times.\n\nI don't know how inconvenienced they were by me tying up their fax lines, but it at least felt nice to me. \n\nEDIT;  They authorized it! What a nice way to wrap up my Friday. Still not sure if my revenge had any bearing, but I’ll chalk it up as a win! ",

She goes ballistic behind the wheel, shouting at me through the glass. This confuses me so I stop.  I stop right in front of the car.  She continues screaming at me.  I look behind me, back at her, behind me again, then back at her. I shrug, smile and wave.  I turn and continue walking, slowly…very slowly across the last half of the cross walk. She peeled out shortly after.  ",

        "text": "Sorry, I hope this fits with this sub! I didn't know where else to put it. I posted this in a comment on a ProRevenge story, but don't think this is pro enough for there! I fleshed it out a little bit at the end. \n\nIn HS, I had a computer teacher who was a bully and a knob. I can't express how much of an asshole this guy was.\n\nI remember the room clearly. Computers lining the walls with a group of them as an island in the middle, with his desk in one corner. That wall had windows to another classroom, but no class took place alongside ours 99% of the time.\n\nThis guy replaced our real teacher two weeks into the year. Our hackles were already raised over it. And it being a mixed-year class, we were just on edge. I was a freshman. I was sat with another freshman and a senior. The freshman, a girl I'll call Annie, had a form of cancer. She'd go to the school nurse routinely for meds or something, I never really asked. I just rubbed her shoulders after she came back, because she always came back sick.\n\nTo my right was Zero. He was a tall, thin, acne riddled shut-in metalhead. Awkward as one could get. All his projects usually involved the grim reaper, fire, skulls, etc. You know the kind. He was awkward but nice. Hungry for friends. And i'm the nerdy anime girl who arts.\n\nThis teacher HATED us. He hated everybody, don't get me wrong. But he especially hated that Annie was always coming and going, I finished my projects too quickly and Zero took too long and was a bit... dark. But we were in high school. The three of us were legitimately physical examples of the clicks you see in cheesy movies, except Ann was freaking gorgeous and a singer.\n\nHe'd constantly yell at the class and loudly belittle you while he looked over your work if he didn't like it. He took great pleasure in ripping you a new one while looking down his nose. He also loved to 'tap' your shoulder with a punch. Most people would turn and snap at him, but he'd laugh you off. He was the teacher, he would be believed. It was infuriating. But don't worry, reader! It comes. \n\nI don't know if anyone ever reported him before this. If they did, nothing happened. Not that i remember. I would prop Ann on my bruised shoulder every day and slowly help her to freedom once the bell rang. Over the course of several months, the uneasiness grew. He sure noticed, because his outbursts were fewer but worse. And he never actually taught. He'd describe the assignment, then either patrol or sit at his desk.\n\nBut after a particularly bad week all around for everybody, with fights in the courtyard to tropical storms and unbelievable heat. Something snapped in everyone. It was a Thursday. We piled into our state- funded torture chamber to deal with this asshole again for 2 hours. He was walking around again, doing his usual bitching. He'd already hit Ann and myself once. He was across the room from me when I heard a loud thump and then all the chairs screech on the tile floor. I reflexively stood up, knowing it was time.\n\nThe. Entire. Class. Except Anne, surrounded him in a blinding motion. He was pinned against the computer desk, his face twisted in sheer terror. One guy stepped into the gap, his finger inches from his face.\n\n\"If you don't stop hitting us and treating us like shit, it will cost you your job. It will cost you your wellbeing, and despite the cameras they will NEVER find your body.\" The teacher tried to speak, but was cut off by other students yelling at him and threatening his delicate frame with intense gang related violence. The room erupted in voices all berating him for his behavior. A group of young people stood against a negative force and was positively throttling him. I screamed at him when he looked me in the eye and pointed to Annie, who was waving the Fuck You Flag from her chair. Her pale face was twisted into a shit eating grin as I turned back to the mob.\n\n\"We're leaving. \"The first guy said, cutting through the noise. And just like that, the mob broke up wordlessly. We all grabbed our shit and left mid-class. That's what prompted the school to really look. It's odd for 30 students to flood out of a classroom geared to to leave. The security nearly shit themselves when they saw us (it was already kind of a violent school, I don't blame them. )\n\n Turns out there WERE cameras in the room! We were all interviewed in the following week, and literally the next day following this there was a different teacher.\n\nHe never returned.\n\nIt was so satisfying.\n\n\nTo clarify: I don't know/ remember if legal action was taken. He was technically assaulting his students. My own mother didn't pursue any. I laid into the counselor about him when i was asked. I talked for 20 minutes straight and did my best to articulate what happened. I had already planned on turning him in, but it turned out to be much sooner than anticipated.\nThey did review the security footage. I do know that. But since we were students, were reluctant to share their thoughts. Words spread like wildfire at a high school, so fair enough.\n\nI do remember a rumor that he wasn't even a teacher. But, you know, that's the high school rumor mill for you. I dropped out and got my diploma by other means so I wasn't there the following year to discover his fate. Only to be told by a friend that he was not a teacher she ever saw. \n\nMore: Annie is doing great now, no worries! Healthy as can be c:",

At my amusement park however we have a hockey game that has 4 targets and you have to try and hit those targets in 60 seconds. You get a prize depending on how fast you can hit all four. \n\nAnyways, this family walks up asking to play and I agree. They paid their money and the dad plays promising his kid he’d win him a hat which can only be won in 20 seconds. The dad gets 25 seconds and I explain to him that he didn’t win a hat. The family goes ballistic even though I told them the times for each prize and the rules but they kept arguing with me for either a hat or a redo. \n\nSo I just took a deep breath and said “Okay guys, I’ll give you a redo.” They look at me like they’ve won against me but they didn’t know what I was going to do next. I took the prize they won before and told the dad to come into the arena again. He got his stick and he started looking confident that he managed to scare the worker into getting a free game for a hat.\n\nFor the first game he played, I was pretty tired so I didn’t really talk into the mic that much but THIS TIME I decided to go all out. I was humiliating this guy. If he missed the net, I’d be like “OHHHHH HE MISSED, HES GARBAGE” or “WHAT HAPPENED BUDDY, YOU HIT THAT LAST TIME”. I did this the whole game until he finally hit them all in fucking 58 SECONDS. He won the smallest prize in the fucking game.\n\nThe family was speechless, they were trying to ask for the original stuffed animal they won and I was like “Sorry guys, I can’t. This is what you won now” Their kid started crying and their parents looked at me like “what the fuck, i have to deal with a crying kid now”\n\nGood. Don’t try to fuck with me. \n\nEdit: Spelling",

        "text": "This is a short story but a small victory for me.\n\nMy favorite band is going on tour next month. Their tickets went on sale a few weeks ago and this is the first time I’ve ever gone to a concert so I didn’t know at the time that TicketMaster is the only place to get guaranteed entry to the event. I  mistakenly bought the tickets from a scalping site because I was in a rush to get one (they’re a very popular band) and I didn’t know it was a scalping site at the time because it looked very legitimate and “official”. \n\nAfter I bought it, I googled the site and realized that it was a scalper site. They marked the price of the tickets up to nearly $200 whereas a Ticketmaster ticket with similar seating was around $75 AFTER all the fees. I was panicking because their site is very strict about not giving refunds. I went through nearly a week of being put on hold, transferred around, tons of emails, and stress, only to find out that there’s absolutely no refunds and zero exceptions unless you were sold a fake ticket.\n\nAt this point I was nearly in tears because I just lost $200 for a $75 ticket. Thankfully I used PayPal to purchase from the scalpers and immediately disputed the charge when I realized that they weren’t going to refund me. Since they technically didn’t give me a ticket at the time of purchase, PayPal sided with me and refunded all of my money back and I managed to snag a ticket from TM before they sold out! \n\nScalpers can go fuck themselves. I’ve since blacklisted the site and only use TicketMaster for events now and I’d recommend everyone else do this too. ",

We vary from being outcasts to geeks to being fucking hilarious weirdos. Some are all three. It's a fun time for the most part.\n\nExcept this ass I work with. We shall call them A since, yeah. Asshole is the best word here. \n\nToday I'm just minding my business and working. A comes in and immediately huffs about how two days when he left, the pre made productions were full. No shit buddy, people buy things. We make what we can around customers and whatnot. Usually we get most everything done but there's the weird day where we have so much to do and a bunch of stuff goes out of date and yeah. Shit don't look the best. Anyways they're going on and on about how whenever they leave, nothing gets done. We're all useless.\n\nNow mind you this is all in a passive aggressive mumble that is intended to be heard. A is like this; they're the shit. The world turns because of their existence. They're pretentious as hell. It's irritating as hell. All I hear is \"whenever I leave nothing fucking gets done\" and the like. This isn't this person's first job where they've been like that. All I hear about is \"damn I've heard (past workplace) sucks now that they don't have me!\" or \"I was the backbone of (workplace)\". You get the idea.\n\nSo today I get the \"this shit has been back here since Monday\" or whatever. I wasn't here Monday and no one told me that this thing (shit that isn't supposed to be back there) was back there. I said that. I was met with A saying \"well you could have looked\" in the most \"you stupid idiot\" voice. Like pal I get it. You're the shit. But fuck off with that. \n\nI was mad for a while, but A was off doing something in the back room, and my buddy came in to work. We realized that buddy (B) had a meeting at the time I was scheduled to leave. I came up with my idea. It's not all that creative but I've been waiting for this kinda thing for a while.\n\nB goes to the meeting. I'm cleaning whatever I've got going up, after when I was supposed to leave, and A is in the back doing whatever, finishing, cleaning meat room, etc. Well, I'm not obligated to stay past my time unless a manager specifically says so. So as A is hiding in the back, I pack my shit and leave them by themselves to clean and watch the counter (keep in mind that B will be back in 45 minutes or so). I don't say anything, just leave the place pristine and clean with everything done. It was so satisfying to walk away knowing I was totally within reason.\n\nYou think you're the shit? You think the world can't live without your presence? You can do more than anyone else? Do it yourself. Let's see how true it is. I guess I was kinda mean to do it but you know what. If you think you're the shit, be the shit you say you are. \n\nLast I heard A was really nice when B got back. Guess someone don't like how their shit tastes. \n\nFuck A.",

They create much appreciated shade in the summer months both for the front of my house and any cars parked underneath them. The trees also end at my house, any further down the street, no trees. I don't know why, I didn't build it.\n\nI also have a tenant who owns an RV and a car, I have my own car, and my fiance has one as well. The RV is in my driveway as it should be and though I do have enough room for all the other cars, it is inconvenient to park them all in the driveway so one of us usually parks on the street under the shade.\n\nThe house across the street from me has a similar setup, they have a nice tree providing shade, they have a smaller driveway with a boat in it so most of them park on the street, no problem. They also have a frequent guest. This guy will not park in front the of the house he's visiting. I assume it's because he knows those people park on the street. He also prefers to be under a tree, and since my house is right across the street he uses the front of my house. Not only that but he parks against the curb in such a way that no one can park in front or behind him without being in front of someone's driveway.\n\nThis jaggoff owns one of those souped up Asian made cars and while it looks nice and I'm sure it goes fast I do not appreciate the sound of that fucking thing outside my window when I'm trying to sleep. You see, I work 2-10PM over the summer and I don't get out of bed until 10 or 11AM so if he comes out to his car and starts it up at 8 or 9 like he does it WILL wake me up. Usually does, anyway. So I've had it with him.\n\nI start parking on the street in the same way he does and so he parks a few doors down, but we've noticed something about him and his car. If the spot in front of my house is left open he will come out of the house, go to his car that is parked under a tree a few doors down and move his car right in front of my house. Unacceptable. He wants to show his big dick to me. Fine.\n\nSo we've started rotating cars, if one car has to leave the spot another one of us will park in it's place. On more than one occasion I have seen him come out of the house with his keys only to turn back around when a car comes out of the driveway and it makes me happy every time. I will gladly empty my driveway just to keep the front of my house under my control. Next time he does it I'm scattering bird seed around his car.",

My sphincter puckered in shock and rage, but I fought past it, and just as the man started to speak I managed to unleash the most horrendous shit of this month, with all of the expected acoustics.  I swear it echoed.  It was such sweet relief!  The conference call ground to a stunned silence for a few seconds, then some awkward throat clearing.  I just lost it, I laughed so hard tears were stinging my eyes.  I hear the guy kill the call with a mumbled, 'I have to dail back in a minute', and practically ran out.  \n\nI don't know who that poor bastard was, but that made my week.",

        "text": "This happened around 98-99.  I was fresh out of high school and I worked for a school district. I was the IT guy and while heading to work this one morning I noticed new speed bumps. These weren’t regular speed bumps, these things were super high and a good 4-5 feet in length and ran all the way across the road. \n\nMy car bottomed out immediately on this. I was crawling over this thing like my life depended on it because I didn’t want damage done to my car.  In my area Low Riders were quite popular during this time and the kids love driving them. My car was at a standard normal height so I know the level of hell that will be unleashed if this isn’t fixed before school starts. \n\nI told the guy in that department that handles those things. He said he would look in to it. He followed up and said he drove over it a couple times and had no problems. I asked him if he noticed the scrap marks.  He said people were going too fast. \n\nNo surprise being out of high school no one would listen to me. I was young and didn’t know anything. Much of that is true but I knew if they didn’t fix that there was going to be hell to pay. \n\nOver the last couple weeks leading up to school starting I continued to complain and warn. They told me they heard enough and it’s fine. My last words of wisdom I bestowed on them in an e-mail “Mark my words, if you don’t fix the speed bumps come opening day you’ll be sorry”.\n\nThe day came and I can’t get to work. There is a long line of cars coming out of the high school. Everything is jammed up. Reason? There is a car physically stuck on the speed bump. Also there were battle scars all over the speed bump from previous cars. \n\nThey had someone directing traffic around the speed bumps (there were two) the fields were turfed and mud was tracked all over the place. It was a mess.\n\nOnce I parked I headed in to the building, there was another line. There was a line of students asking who they need to speak to about the damage done to their car. \n\nI would learn later more than one car had to get towed because after school they were greeted with oild under their car (speed bump damaged the oil pain). Things were so bad they even made an announcement on how the car damage was being handled and the procedure over the loud speaker to try to calm students down..\n\nI printed out two copies of my last e-mail. I stopped by their office, neither were there. They were too busy being on the receiving end of the mess they ignored. But I had them covered. I placed a copy of my e-mail, signed it with a note that said “For the pain” and left a jar of Vaseline. \n\nWhy? Because I was 18 year old cocky kid that’s why. No one said a word to me about it. I did notice after that when I had something to say they seemed to listen better. They did keep their jobs, but the remaining four years I was there until I moved on, no speed bumps. \n\nThe Speed bumps were lowered twice. First an inch or two, still problems so it was lower to the point it was 1/4 inch and useless.  Everyone kept their job in the end.  After my father was done yelling at me for leaving the note and the Vaseline (I told him about it) too this day its one of his favorite stories to tell. lol",

        "text": "This happened almost 30 years ago, and my uncle has passed since, but it's one of my favorite stories. \n\n\n\nMy aunt and uncle never had kids, and were pretty well off financially. They had 2 vehicles, an old 60's Chevy pick up, and a mid 80's cadillac (only a few years old at the time). The cadillac was their town car, and they drove the old truck to and from their cabin or if they needed to haul something. My uncle, on his way back home from the cabin, decided he was going to go buy a new cadillac, because he bought a new one every 5 years or so. \n\n\n\nIt's important to note, my uncle wore overalls and a plain tshirt every day. So he pulls into the cadillac dealership with his old beater truck, dressed like a farmer. He walks around for 45 minutes looking at the cars, and not one employee comes to offer any assistance. He gets angry and leaves without saying a word to any of the employees. He went home, showered, threw on a suit, hopped into his Cadillac, and drove straight back to the dealership. As soon as he pulled in and got out, every single salesman walked up to him immediately. He then said \"Fuck all of you, I was here for 45 minutes in my old truck and wearing overalls. Not one of you even spoke to me. I'm going to [Next closest Cadillac dealership almost 100 miles away]\". Over the course of the rest of his life, he bought 6 brand new Cadillacs from that other dealership, for roughly $300k altogether. That dealership lost $300k in sales because they thought he looked too poor. I bet they never made that mistake again. ",

He’s always been there for me, but he is very conservative and openly disapproving of everything immigrant and LGBT+, so to say we don’t see eye to eye on a lot of things is putting it nicely. \n\nHe got a requirement from a client and I found an awesome candidate. There were two profiles of different genders in my system, so I understood the situation. I sent the resume. I sent 4 resumes.\n\nThis candidate was the only one to get an interview request and nailed the phone screen, moves onto an in person. This is where it gets sticky. \n\nMy uncle was meeting the candidate before the interview. I decided not to give him a heads up about the situation because I know he would take this candidate out of the running. I received a frantic call from him after he met the candidate. Things like what were you thinking, I want to know what I’m representing were said. I told him this wouldn’t stop the candidate from getting the job and he told me that’s a “hippy way of thinking” and I’d grow out of it. \n\nWELL. He called me this morning with a job offer for that candidate. He said thank you to me for not telling him because he would have taken the candidate out of the running, and apologized for his old school way of thinking.\n\nFelt good. ",

        "text": "The following takes place between 00:00 - 01:00 on a weekend a few years ago. I was a night bus driver in the great city of London. As the job title implies, I drove various night buses within the city, and on that particular night was graced by one of the longer central routes.\n\nSo, coming off my break, I drove empty from the garage to Trafalgar Square and began service on my route towards the suburbs. Nothing particularly out of the ordinary, just the typical clientele one would expect on a weekend night, mostly drunks of varying degrees. Sometimes a blessing, sometimes a curse. Why a blessing, you may ask? Well I imagine them being like soda cans. The hectic London nightlife does make you push the bus a bit faster to keep up with a tight timetable what with the constant starting and stopping, and as such your driving may get a little more hasty, thus bumpy, thus impacting said soda can effect. You shake up the drunker lot of passengers enough until their stomach contents explode all over place hehehe. Bus out of service to the garage to get cleaned, less service driving for me, tricks of the trade, happy days. Although that's a story for another time.\n\nI digress. You also have the passive drunks that just touch in their passes and keep quite the whole journey, or fall asleep, and then you have the rowdy lot as my story has been leading up to.\n\nSo, some time later down the route, a group of lively gentlemen board my bus, touch in and stumble to plant their asses firmly on the seats at the rear of the lower deck. Drive, drive, drive and there's a bit of commotion at the back. Nothing unusual. A lady walks up me to complain about one of the group throwing pieces of McDonald's around the bus and generally being drunk dicks. Unfortunately the way of the world  dictates that I can't do anything in fear of losing my job so I just say, \"I'll keep an eye on them.\" Should that be of any comfort to her. But the cosmos heard, so the path was set in stone and I was its elected vessel to impart some revenge and balance the karma of the world.\n\nHalfway through the route, Douchebag-in-chief stumbles up to me whilst I'm serving a bus stop, asking me if there's anywhere for him to take a leak, if I'd wait for him to relieve himself, if I can drive further down where it quieter etc.\n\nNow I am on a very busy road, however some 3 metres away from the open front doors are a few bushes. I see his mental capacity isn't fully switched on, so I say, \"Just go over there!\" Pointing to them.\n\n\"Over there?\" He queries.\n\n\"Yeah, go on mate. I'll wait for you. Just be quick!\"\n\nI see the gears in his head turning and he takes me upon my word, steps off the bus and drags his feet toward the bushes, \"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Yesyesyes, I'll wait! Gogogo!\"\n\nThe Colonel Hannibal Smith within me lighting up a cigar, proclaiming \"I love it when a plan comes together.\"\n\nI do my checks in my offside mirror, the way is perfectly clear for me to go, the traffic lights ahead are green. I indicate out, shut the doors, handbrake off and drive off, seeing the horror in his eyes and he tries to chase after me with his pickle flapping about. Oh we had a hearty laugh at his expense. The lady, sitting not far from me clapping and exclaiming, \"Nice one driver!\", followed by further praises once she alighted. His acquaintances didn't care about him much either. And so that was that, quite a satisfying incident which fuelled my mood for the rest of the night :')\n\nHow I miss the buses.",
