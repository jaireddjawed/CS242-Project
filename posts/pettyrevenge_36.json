        "text": "I'm not even ashamed of this one. \n\nWhen I was in early secondary school (late middle school for those who have middle schools), I was very bad at making friends. Autism, Tourette's, and a couple other things made it surprisingly difficult to make friends. However, eventually, I found a nice, tight-knit group who were never bothered by my disabilities and poor social skills.\n\nHowever, there was another girl who joined us shortly after. She knew the others fairly well, being in a club with them in previous years. I had a bad feeling about her, and didn't like the change to my routine, but just ignored it since I was the only one with a problem. However, this girl (we'll call her Stephanie) got far too comfortable far too quickly. She'd sat with us at lunch for a couple of days, but that was perfectly fine for her to steal our shit. \n\nMy friend lost her pen, and after quizzing us all, it turns out Stephanie had stolen it. When she gave it back, it was chewed to bits (gross). That's not your fucking pen. She stole it, then vandalised it. When questioned: \"It's a habit! You try breaking a habit like that!\" Don't steal the fucking pen, then you wouldn't risk vandalising it or have to break your habit, would you?\n\nThe final straw for me was when she tried to steal a part of my lunch. I have very little patience for people who steal my food, it's happened before and it'll happen again. I don't care who you are, don't steal my shit, let alone my fucking food. This girl reaches over, after finishing her own fucking feast, and expects me to roll over and let her take it. Absolutely *fucking* not.\n\nHonestly, it felt like the part in the movie where the underdog finally stands up to the villain. I grabbed her hand, making sure the most powerful part of my grip was perfectly in line with her knuckles, and - just like my hardcore, Glaswegian mother taught me - squeezed as hard as I could. I could feel her knuckles shit under my hand, and she cringed then screamed and told me to stop, but no fucking way. Eventually, I stopped and she went home.\n\nShe told me the next day, cast on her hand, that I broke her hand. She refused to talk to me again. Apparently I wasn't the only one that detested her, though, because the amount of former-friends that came up to me telling me I did what they wanted too... I never got in any trouble. She moved away a couple weeks later. Apparently her mother got a promotion, which, good for her. I'm just glad I don't have to see her anymore lol.\n\nI'm aware that violence isn't the answer, but god it felt good.",

Now you're wondering why I've added this but it's all relevant. We tried making it work after our loss but it ended up breaking down. Since then we have both moved on or I thought he had, he found my new Snapchat and wanted to talk straight away I told him I was in a relationship and was due to get married, he said it's not why he messaged he was struggling mentally after losing our baby and had no one else to turn to which I told my partner about and he said it was fine. After a little while of talking he asked to meet up which I declined, after that I didn't hear anything from him and assumed he got the help he needed to so I deleted and blocked his account.\n\nSkip a few months later thinking nothing of it until my sister sent me a screen shot of a post he had put up on his FB along with a few others, he had been posting and telling everyone some nasty things about me even blaming me for our babies death. My sister phoned me saying she will ask him to take them down and to get him to apologise. I told her not to bother as we both knew he wouldn't and just to leave it. A little while later whilst scrolling through FB an ad came up for the Bible and to sign up for emails ect I thought about what my ex had said and I signed him up I just needed his email which I remembered.\n\nSince then every time an ad pops up for any religion I sign him up. I didn't do it often just every once in a while so he didn't get suspicious. He still posts bad things about me that aren't true so I still sign him up for things he doesn't want.",

        "text": "Another one of my Canadian Fire - Crappy Tire Petty Revenge Stories\n\nThe store I worked at was 2 stories, with the warehouse being upstairs and the store on the main floor. To put this in perspective, the ceiling on the store floor was like 40' high. There were 3 ways to get product from the warehouse to the floor: Stairs (if you carried it down like 2 flights of stairs), a conveyor (that emptied out to a small 6 x 4 foot room at the bottom, and was at a like 45 degree angle), and the freight elevator. \n\nIf you ever worked retail with Teenagers, you can imagine the freight elevator was the preferred method of travel. The pull down doors, the slow ride... We figured each time you rode the elevator up and down you were paid $0.50 (because it was so slow). So the Store Manager decided to make a rule that the elevator was only for oversized or skidded product. All other products had to go down the conveyor or be carried down the stairs. That was until a kid fell down the stairs carrying a cooler for a customer. Now, ALL product had to go down the conveyor, NO FAIL. \n\nFast forward to a BUSY Saturday. I came on at noon to work until 6pm. We had a kid that started at 8am, and he was scheduled to go home when I started. This was a VERY busy Saturday, I had 8-10 people standing in line at the Sports Desk waiting for help when I walked up. Steve, the guy that was scheduled to go home said \"I will talk to (Bad Manager from the other story) to see if I can stay for an hour an help you get ahead. There is a ton of stock we need to get put up, and I couldn't touch ANY of it because we were so busy. Besides, I want the overtime.\" Well, Bad Manager informed Steve there was NO OVERTIME available, the Store Owner was cutting back on costs. No overtime, no way, no how.\n\nThat was the BUSIEST afternoon I think I ever worked, but by 5:45 I had the stock put up, the boxes compacted, and I was working on facing the shelves. Bad Manager is is actually standing there thanking me for busting my ass when a customer walked up asked for help with some paint. Because of the before mentioned budget cuts, Bad Manager was supposed to be covering Paint for the last hour of the day. He looks me dead in the eyes, and says \"Cheddarburner would be happy to help you\".\n\nClient shows me the paint he wants, but the shelf is empty. I say no worries, we show some in stock, let me run upstairs and get it for you. Please meet me at the bottom of these stairs. \n\nBad Manager hears me say that and chimes in \"Please meet Cheddarburner at that door there, it is our conveyor belt room, he will get you the paint tin there.\" So I run upstairs to get the paint tin and walk over to the top of the conveyor. I am looking at 40 + feet of elevation at a 45 degree angle with a gallon paint can. This is bad news, and I know exactly what is going to happen. But, a rule is a rule. So, paint can goes into the bucket we use on the conveyor, and bucket and paint start their trip down.\n\nIt got about 1/3rd of the way down and the paint can shifted towards the front of the bucket, and then the whole thing flipped. The paint bucket was now accelerating at something like 9.8m/s2 towards the bottom of the conveyor. It flew off the end, hit the door, and EXPLODED like a hand grenade. Paint went everywhere.\n\nSo I grabbed another, ran down the stairs and gave it to the customer. Bad Manager saw this, and threatened to write me up for insubordination. I walked him to the conveyor room, showed him the mess, and informed him this is why I carried it down. He immediately changed his tune, and now wanted me to stay on overtime to clean the mess. Yeah.. No. I reminded him of the zero overtime policy, and that as he was salary, this was going to fall on him. \n\nNow for the reverse UNO Card.\n\nThe next day I had the 8am shift, so I am in with a hangover. My buddy is also working with me, and he brings a small doob in for us to start the day in style. I told him the story about the paint, so we both go to the conveyor room to see the aftermath. Bad Manager used some of the paint to paint the walls (good idea), and the floor was actually perfectly clean. My buddy stays lets fire up the doob in here, the Manager on duty was one of the Automotive Managers and they NEVER came to Sports. So my buddy pulls out the doob and some matches, lights up and drops the match to step on it to put it out. Turns out, Bad Manager cleaned the floors with either Paint Thinner, Gas, or Terpintine. The floor lit on fire like the depths of hell. Both my buddy and I lost almost all of the hair on legs up to our knees. But, it went out in like 10 seconds, which was our saving grace. The worst part? He dropped the doob in all the commotion and we stomped on it accidentally. So, we had no hair on our legs, no doob, and a raging hangover. UNO Reverse card.",

        "text": "My husband and I got married recently and one of the friends his mother invited showed up in a white dress, white shawl, white clutch, and white shoes. The shawl, clutch, and shoes on their own wouldn't bother me, but the pairing with a white dress is where I draw the line. Apparently societal norms and my bridesmaids confronting her weren't enough to convince her to wear my bridesmaid-provided blue shawl all night, so I had to go up to her in front of my new MIL, who was indulging her \"this is ridiculous request\" attitude, and tell her to leave it on. My husband was right by my side when I politely, but firlmy, told her to leave it on.     \n     \n\"It's *dusty rose*,\" she said, \"not white! You know me, I'd never try to upstage you!\" You're my MIL's friend, girl. I *don't* know you (also I looked good, no one really had a shot at upstaging me). And if you have to split hairs like that (it was white), you probably still shouldn't wear it. \"This is my third time wearing this to a wedding and no one has said anything!\" Maybe not to your face, but I've had 4 separate people come up to me and offer to spill red wine on you.   \n    \nI thought the matter was settled after I, the *bride*, told her to leave the blue shawl on. Well, we got the pictures back this week. Later in the night, *after* I talked to her, she took the shawl off. This dress was *white*.     \n     \nThe petty revenge. I cropped her out, blurred her out of the background (my phone's erase tool is surprisingly good), and deleted any picture where she was a focal point, like candids, before sharing the album. The cut/removed photos included the MIL's friend group picture, where this woman had the shawl off. The only group picture they had taken that night.     \n      \nI'm waiting for someone to ask, \"oh no, did your photographer not have any pictures of her? Where's our group picture?\" (My MIL is one who would ask that) I have prepared my best Lady Olenna impression: \"It was me.\"      \n\nTL;DR: don't wear white to weddings because brides *are* petty enough to painstakingly go through and edit &gt;900 photos to make sure you're not in any of them",

        "text": "A good 6 7 years ago I landed my first permanent minimum wage role in a call centre (UK) for an 'up and coming' energy supplier.\n\nAll the usual promises were made- progression, benefits blah blah blah.\n\nAfter completing training I hit the ground running, collecting the 3rd highest bonus the company ever paid out (2nd being me, 1st being my good mate by a long chalk)\n\nAll is well at first, passed my 3 month probation in 2, lots of back patting, all that good stuff.\n\nMy friend cottoned on as to how I'm earning my bonus (KPI was limited call time, high volume intake and call quality) and was on board and competing with me within 2 months, seeing who could edge the other at bonus time, sometimes I'd win, sometimes he would but NO ONE else came within a mile for a solid 15 months.\n\nThis as you can imagine drew a lot of speculation as to why we had managed to outperform everyone whod been there a good 3 years more than us, but as we werent even near bending the rules, there was nothing they could do but smile through gritted teeth as we collected bonuses putting us in management pay brackets.\n\nAfter a while I was given the opportunity to manage a team in the complaints department, as my efficiency and general customer management skills had clearly paid off, to which I naively accepted. Little did I know, it would be on the provision that I would still accept my base pay.\n\nAfter 5 months or so of dredging through a backlog of complaints, most of which had been escalated to the energy ombudsman, i had noticed that my pay was lacking by comparison to what i would make in standard customer services, and approached the manager for that department to discuss my concerns.\n\nThis is where it all goes to shit.\n\nSaid manager very smugly replies \"well we couldn't have you AND friend earning enough to employ another 2 members of staff, it was bad for morale, and took the competition out of it for everyone else\".\n\nI took this on the chin initially and carried on, but it began to fester, especially as I was seeing my savings begin to stall, and the fear of them beginning to dwindle sunk in.\n\nLuckily at this point a member of my new team had sat me down as this conversation had gotten round the various floors and departments (manager was so proud of herself) and told me that she in fact was a union representative,  and what they were doing was surely wrong.\n\nAfter discussing this with the union, re-reading my contract and establishing that one of the very explicit terms of my contract was my being availed to a bonus for meeting the criteria, this then began discussions about how my contract had now been breached, and resolution was needed.\n\nI forgot to mention that the reason I was so good at my job is because when faced with a problem, I am meticulous to the point of being pedantic, and capable of keeping my cool even when someone is screaming at me.\n\nI proposed to the same manager that the months I had worked in my new role were still under the criteria of my old contract as I'd not been provided a new one, and as you can imagine it was all \"you agreed to it\" \"nothing to be done\" etc etc until I advised that I had sought legal advice and had a strong case for breach of contract, which could be supported by login times, area accesses and so on.\n\nLong story short, the quality assessment team had to then work through what was by this point 8 months of my new workload, treat it with the same diligence and standards as an average customer advisor, and calculate my bonus accordingly.\n\nIn my previous role I was bringing home approximately £500 extra a month. With these new findings, I was owed £7,230. I got every last penny after a fight, and left the company a couple of months afterwards.\n\nNot so smug anymore",

The definition of an unstable, abusive trust fund baby. Think Chuck Bass, Armie Hammer, Etc. We had a whirlwind romance at a troubling time in my life and it ended when he moved to LA to pursue his ‘passion’ out there. \n\nHe ultimately broke up with me because I chose to remain in college and follow my dreams, rather than follow his to LA. When we were apart, he consistently tore me down and made me feel like nothing and a nobody. Like what he was doing—driving around his idol (for privacy i’ll reduce them to “a celebrity”) in his daddy’s car—was so much more important than what I was doing.\n\nAt the time I was young, newly single and admittedly being a thot in real life and on instagram. (Looking back I cringe but we all have our different kinds of cringe in life so just bear with me!) Lol. I’m sure I was just looking for his attention. \n\nIn exchange he would call me psychotic, fat, and say he wasn’t into fat girls so he was glad he wasn’t with me, and even say racist things about the men I was seeing etc. He did terrible things and I was admittedly crazy, young, and in love so I was helpless to his attacks. \n\nI had a lapse and reached out to the assistant of the celebrity he worked for and had gotten him to take a liking to me.  Lol. I was flown out there. I didn’t see him once. I provided a lot of information to people out there including the celebrity’s  girlfriend, that he was cheating on her and how I know. \n\nI essentially got him booted after lots of drama and am actually still good friends with the celebrity’s assistant to this day. Ultimately the drama had nothing to do with me anyway. He moved out of LA back to his ‘homebase mansion’ (he has many, or his dad does lol) and I moved on with my ‘insignificant small town’ life.

I will say that I never knew who was behind the stealing but I just simply wanted to get this out so that others experiencing the same thing know that there is a passive way to get them to stop without actually knowing who the thief's are",

        "text": "This took place my freshman year of high school, pre-COVID, in my history class. \n\nOur classroom consisted of columns of desks. The girl that sat in front of me was kind of my friend but not really. Every class we got a break, and at every break she would turn around, take my water bottle off my desk, and drink from it. She would put her mouth on the lip of the bottle, knowing this bothered me (funny to think how unsanitary and inappropriate this would be in these times!). She would always pass it off as a joke, knowing I wouldn’t drink from the bottle until it was washed, so I couldn’t drink until I got home. \n\nCue petty revenge. I emptied an obscene amount of netti-pot salt packets into a bottled water. The next day, I took my reusable water bottle and the bottled (salt)water to class. Right before our normal break, I replaced my normal water bottle with the salt water bottle at the corner of my desk and waited. \n\nAnd waited, waited, waited. Break was ending and she hadn’t grabbed the bottle! Well, right as our teacher began lecturing again, she quickly turned around and grabbed the water. I pretended to reach for it and she took a GIANT swig. Once she realized, her cheeks were filled with water she did NOT want to swallow. I started laughing, she started to kinda laugh, and maybe a quarter of the saltwater spilled out of her mouth and on her shirt. Now, she had the teacher’s attention, and he began to berate her, saying what’s so funny, that’s enough, take class seriously, etc. She couldn’t respond since she still had the saltwater in her mouth. So, she was forced to swallow the rest of it as to not make things worse. \n\nI laughed so so hard, she was mad but also had a bit of a laugh, and my water never got stolen again.",

It’s a pretty boring job but it’s easy, I can do homework when there’s nothing to do, and ya boy needs some money. \n\nSo It’s about 10am and a student walks in to check out a reserved book that was full of photography from some famous guy. The student tells me he is the teaching assistant for the professor who had it reserved. Policy says only the person that reserved the book can pick it up, so I apologize to the guy and he leaves.\n\nAt 1:00, my shift is done and I’m packing up my stuff to leave when the professor (M 40s) shows up, livid btw, because he wanted to show the book (a picture book mind you) to his class and couldn’t because I didn’t give it to his TA. \n\nWhile I’m checking him out his book, I apologize and tell him “sorry dude, it’s the policy.” He was PISSED, starts yelling at me about how he has a PhD (in photography…) and has better things to do with his valuable time than to pick up his own books and especially to deal with morons like me. \n\nI told him I’ve got better things to do than get yelled at by him.\n\nHe said that I was an incompetent stupid moron, and he’s surprised that I’m somehow still in college based on how stupid I am.\n\nAt this point I can’t take it anymore. I just start laughing at this man-child throwing a tantrum. Everything he was saying to me I just was finding so funny because I was not expecting this interaction to be so absurd. \n\nBecause I was already leaving when he showed up, I left immediately after checking out his book and got to have the last word “have a nice day!”\n\nHave fun with your picture book bud. I don’t know if this is revenge or not , but he just kept trying to show off his self-importance to me and was definitely even more mad after I left that I did not care.",

There is additional parking below, but people always fight and break the rules to get that primo spot on the top deck. To avoid all that mess, I usually just walk there instead.\n\nToday as I was leaving I noticed a couple who had pulled their car all the way up to the doors of the grocery store to unload their cart. They were partially blocking traffic, making it difficult for people to get around them. \n\nTo make matters worse, after they unloaded their last bag, they decided to just leave their cart in the middle of the walkway…. A whole 10 feet away from the cart return area. \n\nThat shit pisses me off. Grocery store employees are not your maids, and making their jobs harder because you’re too lazy to put your cart back makes you an asshole person in my book.\n\nThey were being double assholes, so I decided to be petty. I took the most simple route to my revenge and decided to move their cart for them! Only I didn’t put it back in the cart return area either. Rather, I put it directly in front of their car and then just kept on walking.",

        "text": "I work at a restaurant that has a drive-through window to pick up your orders. The location of the window makes it so the customer can see into almost the entire store, making it possible for them to see employees inside (this is relevant). The drive-through also has a motion alarm that beeps so loud that it can easily be heard outside the window, especially if your car windows are rolled down.\n\nIt was an extremely busy day. All the workers inside were either taking orders on the phones, making food, or were clearly busy assisting other customers. I was on the phone when this woman in a mini-van pulls up to the drive-through window with her vehicle window rolled down and, with her mini-van STILL IN THE PROCESS of coming to a complete stop, started knocking rapidly on the store window with a sour expression on her face. I turned to look at her and smiled, indicating I had seen her and would be there as soon as I didn’t have a phone obviously held up to my ear. She threw her hands in the air and shrugged angrily with another nasty face as if to say, “Hurry up!”\n\nI finished taking the order in the next minute or so and hung up. I went to assist her, as I was the first to be able to do so, and before I could ask “Hi, how’s it going?” she loudly stated her name at me. The whole direct interaction with her was quite unpleasant, and my social anxiety was starting to jam up my brain a little. When I had gone to prepare her salad (prepackaged salad goes into a bag with a fork and napkins), I was discombobulated enough that I put in the correct type of salad, I remembered her extra dressing packet, and I gave her napkins, but I had forgotten to put the fork in! As I was handing her the salad bag, I realized my mistake and this is the point where I would have readily admitted to her that I forgot a fork and would be right back to go grab her one. However, I had been mildly insulted that she was so incredibly impatient at the beginning of this experience, so I wished her a good day and otherwise kept my mouth shut.\n\nIn such a big rush to get your food you’ll treat me nasty? Too bad you’ll have to wait until you get home to eat your salad with your own fork.",

This starts to slightly annoy me as I continue my drive home. A minute later, the window rolls down and an empty sprite bottle comes flying at me from the car that's being stupid.    \n\nThis really pissed me off.    \n\nThe road then splits into a two lane road, and the annoying driver tries to go around the car at the very front only to be blocked by traffic lights. Now, this road goes back to a one lane road a few block ahead, and people usually are nice enough to let cars on the right cut back in. At the red light before the road converges again, the annoying driver revs their engine as if to flaunt their ability to pass the car next to it.    \n\nWhen the light turns green, it was as if the car in front and I had the same plan in mind. The car originally being tailed drove just quick enough where the annoying driver couldn't pass them, and I drove just close enough to the car in front to prevent the annoying driver from cutting in. This left the annoying driver no choice but to merge into the lane behind me.    \n\nI made sure to drive 5 miles below the speed limit in the 3 blocks before I had to turn.",

        "text": "\n\nTL; DR: My roommate [27M] has produced several frictions because of his bad habits. He was talked to a couple of days ago and personally I [21F] thought he would change. I washed and polished with sandpaper the accumulated black fat of the pots and pans that I lent him while he did not have his own. Now I went for tea and found my pots with fritters that he cooked, next, his own dirty pots of maybe when. I took out his food and put it in a tupperware and I wrote him a sticky note that says \"Do not use my pots anymore, you have yours.\"\n\n Maybe this goes away in a few more hours for TIFU, maybe it will just stay here, no idea, I do not care anymore. \n\nI live in an apartment with my boyfriend [22M], our kitten [2M] and two roomates, Bob [21M] &amp; Charles [27M], who rent the two remaining bedrooms. \n\nThe problem in particular is with Charles. Charles is a problematic guy, we have lived with him three months now and it has been a disaster. We wait for the end of the year to give him the notice of the end of the contract, because on this date it is difficult to find a new tenant and we all pay the same, therefore if one is missing one fourth of the monthly rent goes on us if we don't find another roomate.\n This is because Charles is too dirty, in the unhygienic way. Product of their actions surpassing the nerves of everyone, it was necessary to confront him so that it takes charge of his stuff (crockery, dirty clothes, personal hygiene, among others). As we had already spoken with him (it was one of the most uncomfortable situations in my life) I thought everything was going to change, at least gradually, so I equipped myself with deep cleansing material and started with the most urgent thing after Hurricane Carlos: The pots and pans. \n\nNever in my life had I ever seen (nor crossed my mind) so much scorched fat where you cook your food. It cost me so much work that I finally had to use sandpaper for wood against that black grease. My arm still hurts actually.\n\nSo, now I went to heat some water to prepare tea in the kitchen and I find my pots with fried food. Seriously Charles??\n\nWhen Charles arrived, we agreed to lend him our utensils (not just kitchen stuff) until he had his own. And guess what? Next to my dirty pots he just used, are his own pots unwashed from maybe 2 or 3 days.\n I took his food and emptied it to his tupperware. Above them I stuck a pink post it that says: \"Do not use my pots anymore please, you have yours.\" \n\nSorry, this is the most aggressive thing I've done on purpose that I know and remember. It's just that I did not even give myself the right to be frustrated. Sorry not sorry Carlos 😔\n\n",

        "text": "Some years ago, I worked at an electronics repair shop, and it was my job to handle the more complicated computer issues. One of my coworkers was a wildly immature dude, and I was the only woman who worked there. He would periodically make extremely sexist comments to me, including this one “prank” when he put my period on the shop calendar and told everyone that he wasn’t going to schedule himself on those days. (To clarify, he was theorizing that I was on my period because I guess he thought I was in a bad mood one day? He wasn’t actually aware when my period was because as it turns out, women can function and be good at their jobs despite having ovaries.) He would make really gross comments about female customers while watching them on the security cameras, and when I told him politely that I didn’t think that was appropriate workplace conversation, he told me that I probably shouldn’t work with guys if I had a problem with the way they talked when girls weren’t around. He was eventually promoted to assistant manager. Once he had some tiny amount of power over me, our already tense relationship began to deteriorate. \n\nOne week, he scheduled me for an extra shift that I almost never worked, and I completely forgot that I was supposed to be there. He called me 10 minutes after the shift started, realizing that I must have forgotten because I had never once been late. I apologized and said I was on my way and would be there soon. He told me not to bother coming in at all and hung up on me. When I got to work the next day, he had written me up for not coming to work, which included a whole rant full of hyperboles and exaggerated details. HR forced me to sign the paper even when I told them that the facts were incorrect. \n\nA few weeks later, I messed up on a repair and the shop had to buy the client a new device. It sucked, but it happens... unfortunately there’s always going to be that 1 out of 1,000 times when you nick something on the board. It had happened to literally every one of my coworkers at least once. The assistant manager demanded my suspension because I had supposedly been negligent. I told them to make the suspension permanent. \n\nThe next day, I get a desperate call from the assistant manager saying that a client was in there with a warranty return due to a defective part and that none of them knew how to do the repair, and that the client  was angry and threatening to leave a bad review. He begged me to come in and help. I was about to hang up on the guy, but decided that making them all feel extremely uncomfortable and regretful for having screwed over their only competent computer repair person sounded like a much more satisfying plan. I came in to do the repair and sat at the desk right in front of him with a smile on my face, relishing in the awkward while he tried to avoid making eye contact with me. For the first time, I had a very small amount of power over him knowing that I was there as a favor to him and that if I walked away he would be screwed, and I could tell that this minor shift in dynamic was driving him crazy. It felt great.\n\nEdit: To those who asked, yes, I invoiced them for it, and the guy had to sign off on paying whatever I billed, which was over the rate I had been paid as an employee. I received a check in the mail without comment. In retrospect, I wish I had charged more.",

        "text": "About 1.5 years ago I was working at a retail cell phone store in a super slow location (I had been with the company for about 3 years at this time). It was me, two other sales reps and a manager. The two other reps did bare minimum and I was constantly having to pick up their slack to keep the store looking nice. The manager actually requested a demotion to transfer to a store closer to home because he had an hour commute to the store and wasn’t making enough to make it worth it. \n\n\nRight when the manager was trying to transfer, a new District Manager took over our region. She put through my managers transfer and offered me the manager position of our store. I was stoked. She told me I would initially be on a trial period to see how I did, and then if I did well she would keep me as manager permanently instead of looking to hire someone else. I was fine with this since I had no manager experience and knew I would just need to prove myself. Once my two coworkers got word that I was offered the manager position they were pissed, they immediately told the DM they had second jobs and now were only available on the weekends, meaning I was the only employee left to work during the week. On top of this, I would come back from them working the weekend to the store being a disaster- the trash never being taken out, the demo phones not stored properly, and voicemails being left on the phone implying that the store wasn’t actually open during the times it was supposed to be. At this point the promotion wasn’t actually put through so I had no power to do anything about it, and I never saw them because they worked weekends and I worked weekdays. \n\n\nWith the other two reps only working weekends and me being the only rep during the week, that meant I was working open to close (9am-7pm) by myself with no breaks since I couldn’t close the store. The DM told me she was looking for replacements and a couple days a week had coverage from the store an hour away come help out but I was still mostly working alone with no breaks, and was still not in the system as a manager so I was getting annoyed. \n\n\nAfter about a week of this the DM called me and told me that she had actually opened the manager position to outside hires and that I would be the interim manager and if I did well and they didn’t find anyone else to hire as the manager they would consider keeping me on. I was pissed. I had been given the promotion then essentially had it taken away. Up until this point I had been looking for a new job, I wasn’t very happy there even before this all started so I had been keeping my options. Pretty much the same day she told me I basically wasn’t getting the promotion I was called for an interview somewhere else. \n\n\nThe next week she called and told me even though I wasn’t getting the promotion, she still wanted me to do the manager duties since at this point there was no manager at the store. (She claimed I would receive manager pay for this but I highly doubted that would ever actually happen. And at this location manager pay was $4 an hour more than I was making but I wouldn’t be receiving my bonus as a sales rep or the managers bonus since I wasn’t actually a manager, so I would lose money by taking the manager pay). I told her no thank you, as I am no longer going to become the manager, I have no desire to have to learn and take on those new roles (it also would mean driving two hours away once a week for manager meetings). She then offered me the assistant manager position (a position that had never existed at this location but she was going to make exist because she needed someone to run the store until she could hire someone). This position would be $2 more an hour, and until they could hire a new manager, I would be required to handle the manager duties. I again said no thank you, I would just keep my current position and responsibilities. I could tell she was annoyed because she would now have to either come out herself, or get a manager from another location to come do manager duties at this location. \n\n\nThe next day I was called for a second interview at the new job I was looking into and ended up being offered the position. It just so happened it was a Friday and I didn’t work weekends so I waited until I was just about off for the day, sent in my two weeks notice, and then didn’t check any messages until my next work day. At this point she knew she was screwed because she had two reps that didn’t do their jobs well, no manager and the only rep that kept the store functioning was leaving so on top of needing to hire a manager, she now needed to find a replacement for me. \n\n\nThe next two weeks I got screwed over hard, I was scheduled by myself from open to close, got chewed out every day for not clocking out for a break because I couldn’t take one without closing the store, but I did get lots of overtime and the company had to pay lots of meal penalty fines for not giving me a way of properly taking my break. \n\n\nOn my last day, I somehow had a super busy day at the store and made a ton of money in profit. We had a district wide group me so everyone in our area got the alerts. She tried to call me out saying it was a shame I was leaving since I had such a good day. I called her back out saying it “would have been nice to have been given the opportunity to have more good days like that for myself and for the company but she fucked up by offering me the manager position and then taking it back. And also good luck to my shitty coworkers that did nothing but create more of a mess for me to deal with”\n\n\nThe best part, I had given my two weeks notice and the DM fucked something up so my final check didn’t arrive on my last day of work like it was supposed to. My DM kept trying to tell me it would just be direct deposited into my account but by law where I live the final check has to be a paper check, it can’t be a direct deposit. She couldn’t tell me whether it was going to the store or to my house, and the people in charge of paychecks just happened to be out of office for the weekend. I pulled up the state laws to know what my rights were since they weren’t giving me my final check and discovered that for every day I didn’t get my final check, they had to pay me. I ended up getting an extra three days pay because she didn’t know how to put the paperwork through properly. \n\n\nAnd since she hadn’t found a new manager for the store, or a replacement for me by the time I left (no one was willing to transfer to my location because they would make less money) she had to pay some manager from a store 3 hours away to drive to my store to run it everyday. Screw that company. \n\nETA TLDR; District Manager offered me manager position, then took it away, then made me work days all alone. I immediately found new job and quit leaving them high and dry. They also had to pay me extra for messing up my final check. ",

We were all having a fun night, playing our Pokemon games and whatever, until we all got so tired that we went to bed. \n     Fast forward to the morning and my game, along with all the other Pokemon games, are missing. Ok, so we had a late night. Maybe we put them somewhere and forgot. So we're looking around, no Luck. So, we look again. Still no luck. Keep In mind that it has been 2 HOURS that we have been looking for these.  \n     Later that day, My mom (who came to pick me up) has the clever idea to check everyone's bags. We had checked all the bags, no luck. Until the kid brought in his bag. . My mom asks to see his bag. He said, no he didn't steal it. We finally persuade him, and sure enough, in a secretish looking pocket,he has all of our games.\n     When we get back to school, we were all talking about how it happened, and what he stole.

        "text": "Not usually a petty person but this one girl really ticks me off.\n\nMy apartment building has a laundry room for tenants to use so most units do not have their own washing machine. I try not to do my laundry on weekends as there are usually long que of every goddamn washing machines in the room (and we only have 5 washers and 5 dryers for three 27 floors blocks).\n\nAnyways, I usually start the laundry and set my alarm to 10 minutes before it's done. I head back up to my unit to do else things and come back down to wait out final minutes. Did that too because I don't like to hold up the line or have someone takes out my clothes and dumps it on the floor.\n\nIt's weekends and the line is pretty long. When I got back down, my clothes were outside the machine, half washed. There are still soap suds on it. Obviously someone had turn the machine off halfway, get my clothes out (bitch, my laundry basket is right in front the machine, was it hard for you to get the clothes into the basket instead of puttin it on top of the machine?) and dump hers into it. \n\nAsked the lady using the machine next to me and she said a girl turned the machine off halfway throughout washing. Since rinsing takes only a couple minutes (maximum 15 minutes),I stopped the machine, get mine done with the same machine and set hers back to washing...for 3 hours. One and a half hour of just washing before it rinse and spin to dry.\n\nOn top of that, I add in more detergent so there's no chance in hell you can stop the washing halfway with the overflowing soap bubbles. \n\nWhen I got down to get my clothes from dryer half an hour after, that girl was standing in front of the washer with an angry AF face and was guarding the machine like its her most prized possession. Not only she could not stop the washing, the soap bubbles was overflowing out from the machine due to the huge amount of detergent I had put into her washing.\n\nSeriously, don't cut the fucking line and interfere with my washing next time, shithead.\n\nThe best part is, she is not supposed to use the machine after me. She had jumped the line and stopped my washing halfway. \n\nEdit: to those who commented that I am an asshole because I hold up everyone from doing their laundry, yeah I am. I thought this a sub for petty revenge, not calling out people to be a saint.\n\nMost important is, nobody actually see the \"real\" revenge of me deliberately making her look like the asshole by 'hogging' the machine doing her laundry for 3 hours. (Thank you for the existence of half a bottle of detergent that just happened to be in her basket).\n\nIf you're looking for a saint with a petty revenge, this aint the thread to be y'all. At least I didnt bleach her clothes because I am polite that way but I still want her to look like a fucking asshole.\n\nFor the updates, our management just penalized her for hogging the machine for three hours (she has to pay a fine roughly about USD15 because apparently someone was really pissed at her) and also because her overflowing soap suds somehow clogged the machine filter/drainer or whatever.\n\nSo, just dont be an ass next time and people won't mess with you. This ain't the first time she did it too. Some tenants complained about her but no actions were taken. When I sabotaged her washing, a guy got really mad for her using the machine for 3 hours on normal washing and force one of the guards to act on it. Guard ended up reporting her to management.\n\nThe end. Again, there is no point being an ass when you live in a community ok?\n",

        "text": "Starting my day the way I always do : Ride up to the city center and get a takeaway coffee before going to my office.\n\nIn Morocco, street cafés are pretty much the most abundant form of business, so I'm not a regular on any of them and the quality/price is pretty much the same. Also, apart from the big franchises, you actually get to consume what you order before paying.\n\nI walk into this pretty busy, big, and fancy café, order my coffee, wait for it to get done, and then hand a 100 DH (Moroccan currency 100 DH = 10.61 USD) bill to pay for my 14 DH coffee (which comes with free bottled water). The Barista looks at my bill, and refuses to take it.\n\n\"Why are you giving me a 100 DH bill ? I'm not taking it. Go get some change somewhere.\" In a very patronizing and pretty rude tone. Sounded like \"Go fetch\".\n\nIt was way past 9AM so the café already got enough money from past costumers to give me back my change.\n\nI answer :\n\n\"Ok, you wait right there. Just allow me to...\"\n\nI take a quick sip from the coffee, crack open the fresh bottled water, take a sip from it, and tell him that I'll be right back with the change.\n\nI walk out, walk a few meters, get in another café, which serves me my coffee and accepts my 100 DH bill. It was also 1 DH cheaper.\n\nThe invoice was already issued so that Barista was gonna have to pay it from his own pocket.\n\nMost satisfying coffee of my life.\n\nEDIT : Before accusing me of being a terrible customer : 100 DH is not a big bill. This is the first time in my 25 years I get refused payement over 100 DH. 9 AM, coffee opens at 5, starts getting busy at 7. They have enough money and change in the till. Moroccan baristas sometimes treat you like you owe them something, very disrespectful.",

        "text": "The story started about 6 hours ago and it ended about an hour ago. I finally decided to put laundry cause I'm running out of clothes, and so I did. Important to note that I live in a dormitory and my floor has about 40 people in total, 3 laundry machines and 1 dryer. Because the apartments and the bedrooms are small, there's an extra laundry room in the hall which everyone has access to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike I was saying, I put my clothes in the laundry machine, went out for a walk till they were done, then I came back and put everything in the dryer. Normally I just hang my clothes and let them dry out by themselves, but since my room doesn't have a lot of space and I had a big pile of dirty clothes, I decided to use the dryer instead. So, I put my clothes in the dryer, went to grab dinner until they were done and then I came back, full of excitement and curiosity as to whether this dryer is worth it or not. And I was pretty fucking excited until I walked in the laundry room and saw all my clothes on the floor while the dryer was in use. As you can imagine, my body is oozing with adrenaline and my blood starts boiling. Who can be so trashy that they cannot wait for 15 fucking minutes until the thing is done and I come get my clothes?! My first (and continuous) thought was to wait until that little motherfucker showed up so I could beat his sorry ass. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd so I started waiting, pacing up and down the hallway. And I waited, and I waited, and I waited, still pacing throughout this whole time. (For perspective, I spent the entire day until this point with my cousin and her health app on her iPhone showed she walked 3.3 kilometers. Mine showed 7.9). I waited for this little shit for 1.5 hour, his clothes were already done and he was nowhere to be seen. Ironic. At this point it was getting a bit late and I got bored of just pacing up and down the hall, but at the same time I couldn't wait in my room cause I wouldn't be able to see/hear the guy coming in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I thought fuck it. I opened the dryer, took out his clothes and piled them up, then I took about a third of them and threw them out of the 10th floor window. The funny thing is that there's a small (2 floors maybe) building right below that window, so now some of his clothes are stuck on the roof of said building.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBUT WAIT, there's more! I placed the remaining pile of clothes on top of a small drain in the laundry room and wouldn't you guess it, I took a piss on them. At the time of writing this post, this guy still hasn't shown up yet and his freshly washed, freshly dried clothes (or what's left of them) are soaking in my capuccino filled piss.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the end, I'm quite happy about how I handled this cause A) I avoided any legal troubles by kicking his ass (or me getting my ass handed to me in the end lol) and B) He will now think twice before he decides to just take out people's freshly washed clothes and throw them on the floor cause he's an impatient little bitch. Get fucked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS Don't know if this breaks the no vandalism rule bit, but like they say you fight fire with fire. Or piss.",

Normally, this would be amazing, but I know there's something wrong because we did not tackle this particular issue yet, so there's no way it got fixed overnight out of the blue.\n\nSo I sent an e-mail about the issue to $sadm. We communicate semi-regularly and he's based overseas, so I know he takes a couple hours to respond. Next day, I check my mail. Nothing. I check the software. Nothing. I think maybe he's a bit busy with something and he'll get back to me later on.\n\nFriday comes along and I'm still in the dark. People start asking what's up with the software. I send a follow-up email, asking for a status update. By the end of the day, nothing has been done. Monday comes around, I expectantly log in to see if there was weekend maintenance done. Nothing.\n\nI contact my sister branches to see if they're experiencing similar issues, but they report business as usual. So I send yet another mail asking for an update, an acknowledgement or any sign of life, really. Dead silence. \n\nWednesday comes around again and I still haven't heard a thing. People are starting to get angry. Naturally, things get out of my power scope and I need to escalate the matter. So I forward the chain of requests and supplications to $SF. \n\n$SF does the management thing and forwards the chain back to $sadm saying: \"Hi, $sadm. Could you please assist $me in the issue below? Thanks.\".\n\nI roll my eyes when I see this, but say nothing, fully expecting nothing to come out of this. Lo and behold, 5 minutes later $sadm answers: \"Yeah, I have a fix going live today, check if it's fixed tomorrow. Sorry for no answer, am busy.\"\n\nSo I take a deep breath, letting all my frustration go and type up my answer. Now, I couldn't let this go by unscathed, but I need to be civil, for the sake of my job. So I devised a way to let $sadm know I was pissed with him. \n\nNormally all my replies end with \"Best regards, $me\". So for my answer regarding the fix, I refused to send my \"Best\", and only sent my regards. That should show him!",

        "text": "I worked as a bartender at a seafood chain. We always had an issue keeping bartenders for an assortment of weird reasons, so myself and another guy worked behind the bar about 40-45 hours a week. Not too long ago, I went back to school full time, just in time for them to hire a new guy to take my hours. \n\nJ, as he'll go by, was a shit bartender, a serial liar, and an egomaniac. Imagine all the worst things that could possibly go wrong behind a bar, and make it an everyday thing. This guy accomplished maintaining an environment of shit and abject laziness for all two to three months we worked together. I was working WAY less, but every shift I came in after him, nothing was prepared. Glasses were dirty (but put away???), no fruit was cut or mixes made, and whole kegs were empty. It sucked working there as I was doing twice the work I was slated for EVERY shift. None of the managers really ever did anything about him either. He was a warm body, and that's really all they needed.\n\nSoon enough, I put in my two weeks and had two shifts left. It was a Sunday morning where he'd closed the night before and lo and behold, everything is a catastrophic mess. I gave up. Didn't do anything my entire shift except for takeout orders. Left the bar the way he left it the night before and waited for him to come in for the night shift.\n\nHe's 30 minutes late, and as I'm ready to clock out one of the managers asks me why I haven't done anything.\n\n\"J did jack shit last night, when are you going to tell him to do his fucking job.\"\n\nSo, J finally shows up, sees that nothing is done, flips shit and walks out of the restaurant. I clock out and start driving home.\n\nBoth of us were terminated. It felt great.\n\ntl;dr: shit Employee makes working a living hell, spend what became my last day ruining his shift and subsequently getting him fired by doing... nothing. ",

I work at a nail shop where my co-worker and I are assigned to do pedicures and manicures only so we don't deal with acrylics, that's left to our bosses. \n\nA lady comes in and she wants a pedicure. My co-worker refuses to do it because we already cleaned up and put everything away, but my guy boss insists saying that it's still early and that we close at 9:30. She still refuses so I go ahead and do it instead (here we take turns and it was her turn so that's she was asked to do it). I didn't want to do it either because I was already looking forward to leaving and didn't want to deal with it but whatever. Work is work. \n\nWhile I'm finishing up it's almost 9 and she mentions that she also needs her nails done. My lady boss says she wouldn't have time. We wouldn't have time?? What?? So I turned around and tell her that \"Yes we do, we close at 9:30 remember?\" Now this sets them off and they start talking shit but it's in their language (Vietnamese) and I honestly don't care. When I finish her feet I get my stuff and go because I have nothing to do anymore and my co-worker and I say goodbye. The angry look on their faces was so priceless. ",

        "text": "Disclaimer: I didn't carry out this petty revenge. Details below.\n\n\nAbout a decade ago I used to deliver pizzas for a popular local chain. Customers were generally great and I made decent money, but of course there were some stinkers. Our focus today is \"Herbert.\" We nicknamed him because he was a single elderly man who always came out in a bathrobe, like the Herbert from Family Guy. [Reference.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/67/Herbert_-_Family_Guy.png/250px-Herbert_-_Family_Guy.png) Our Herbert didn't have a walker, but he wore his robe open so everyone could feast their eyes on his salt-and-pepper-chest-carpet which was ornamented with an ugly gold neck chain. He also had  monstrous eyebrows and extra head hairs that sprout from the weird places that only old people seem to grow hairs. He was clearly finished with proper grooming.\n\n\nHerbert called every few days for lunch, and nobody liked taking his orders. He made complex requests that required extra prep and attention to detail, but because he asked for a bunch of small things the price was still just at our minimum price for delivery. Now if everything was *perfect* and we showed up very early in the delivery window, he would toss us a little assorted change as a tip. If anything was wrong, which was fairly often in his case, he would give us nothing extra. We're all making minimum wage plus 50 cents commission on each order, so we really rely on tips to make a decent wage and keep up with our cars. Throwing us pocket change isn't helpful and feels like mockery. One of our guys, \"Bubba,\" was especially insulted by his behavior and usually refused Herbert with a \"keep the change.\"\n\n\nOur staff was not the most mature lot. One day somebody found a Family Guy postcard that had a picture of cartoon Herbert chasing Chris from the show. We crudely drew it up to make it look like our Herbert (lots of extra hair,) and added the captions \"*Come here sonny, let me give you a tip!*\" \"*No thanks, 'Herbert', you're creepy!*\" We had a laugh and taped it on a staff-facing counter for a while. Well, Bubba had to take it a step further. The next time Herbert ordered, Bubba volunteered, slipped that cartoon in his delivery bag, and delivered that pizza, salad, soda, red pepper, parmesan, plates, and silverware to Herbert with a smile.\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, Herbert was pissed and called our corporate office. Word got back to the store manager and he essentially told Bubba, \"That was awesome, but I've been ordered to fire you.\" Bubba obviously came out the loser, but Herbert never called our store again! We appreciated Bubba's vindictive actions, and moved on to complaining about a family of Australians who never tip.\n\n\nTl;dr: Coworker delivered an insulting Family Guy cartoon to an annoying regular customer. He got fired, but the customer stopped calling.",

There was a little car behind me riding my tail but I take my time driving because kids. As so as we got to where the road widened to two lanes, they zipped by me. At this point, I was going 43 in a 35mph zone but apparently, that wasn't fast enough. No big deal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, then I see her turn into a side street that goes to the back parking lot of a popular coffee shop. The same one I just mobile ordered my coffee from. She is at the back of the drive thru line when I pull in to get my order.  I park, walk in, grab my stuff and walk out. At this point, she is at the front of the line at the drive through window.  She has to drive past where I'm parked to leave so I decide to time my backing out to perfectly block her from driving by but it still looks coincidental. I take my time driving because coffee shop pedestrians. I pull to the next intersection in the parking lot and take my time turning right because traffic. She turns left to go around to the back way so I continue onto the main street and then a quick right down the side road, literally driving past her again as she waits to pull out. At this point, she knows I've been messing with her and have caused her to end up behind me 3 times. Needless to say, she is super animated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMaybe next time, slow down in a school zone or, hell, mobile order your caffeine and take your commute down a notch.",

I thought maybe its just the way she is BUT as this woman walks away i see her roll her eyes. Throughout the dinner she did not come by once (again this is a rather upscale restaurant and usually a waitress at any place would come and check up)\n\nSo when its time to pay the bill (around 70$) she hands me the machine and usually a waitress is supposed to not look at what you give as a tip as you are putting it in the card machine. I was dissatisfied i thought wow what a rude bitch but im still going to tip her 10 percent because i dont like drama to which as i hand it over THIS FUCKING WOMAN HAS THE AUDACITY TO SAY \"did you make a mistake? (Referring to the 10 percent). I reply with sorry yes i did and when she hands it back i type in 1 percent (i wish i did 1 cent).  She looks at it and i smile as she walks away with this angry yet subtle looking face as if she was in shock. \n",

        "text": "I needed to take an upper-level math class required for my degree, and thought I'd have the best chance at passing it if I took it on its own, with nothing else to distract me, so I signed up for the summer session at my university. The class ran five days a week for six weeks, and consisted of myself, three other regular summer students, about 20-25 incoming freshmen who were living in the same dorm as part of an early start program, and a professor so old he remembered teaching one student's mother in the same math class over 20 years prior. The class syllabus indicated that we had three exams and a final, and then we'd have 25 quizzes, about one on each non-exam day, and the quiz portion of the overall class grade was weighted fairly heavily. The professor also informed us that he wouldn't be requiring or grading homework, but that if we found anything difficult, we should work through the corresponding homework question and go to office hours if we still didn't understand.\n\nSo the first day of the class, everyone attended, and there were more students than desks, so we dragged enough extras in from an empty classroom. The second day of the class, the professor gave us the first quiz as promised, but there were a couple empty desks so not everyone had returned. This wasn't unusual, sometimes students would realize they were in over their heads, or the long days of summer classes weren't for them, and drop or switch it immediately. The third day, there was another quiz, and the people who were absent the second day had returned, but there were even more people absent. Within a week, it was obvious that the professor had been telling the truth about a quiz every day, but only the four of us regular students had showed up every day and an average of 2/3 of the early start students would skip at any given time.\n\nOn the day of the first exam, everyone showed up and like the first day of class the room was full. The professor passed out the exams, announced he'd be in his office if we needed anything, and left the classroom. We worked in silence for a few minutes, and then one of the early start students quietly asked \"Does anyone know the answer for the question #2, with the circle?\" A second early start student answered with an incorrect answer, which the first dutifully wrote down. A third early start student asked \"What was the first step again?\" and the second student repeated his incorrect answer. Through this entire time, the other regular students and were staring at each other, first in abject shock that cheating was happening so openly, and then in barely concealed amusement as they continued to share wrong answers because we realized that since most of these students had not been in class, they'd all get the same incorrect answers, which would be a dead giveaway to the professor that they'd been copying from each other.\n\nThe next day, the professor handed back the graded exams to the handful of us in the classroom, and said nothing about cheating or academic dishonesty, so we said nothing, thinking that maybe he didn't mention it to us because we weren't involved. The next days, and the next weeks, he still said nothing, as the early start students continued to skip classes more than they attended them, and unknowingly share wrong answers on the other exams. \n\nThe day before the final, almost everyone was in the classroom again. The professor said that, since he knew it was a fast-paced class, and not every student was able to make it to class every day, he would be curving our grades up - instead of making the quiz portion of our grade the cumulative total of all 20+ quizzes we'd taken, he'd only count our top 10 quiz scores and average them. The three other regular students and I had all hoped that if we worked hard, perhaps we could get a C required to use the class as a pre-requisite without re-taking it, and this was an incredibly generous curve and would effectively guarantee we'd pass, and could potentially even allow us to still earn an A if we did well on the final! (Much later I realized that the professor was using the homework questions as quiz questions, so if we'd had difficulty on a topic and did the homework question as he recommended, we'd have learned the solution to the quiz question). Some of the students who cheated and skipped frequently not only had low grades that were failing with no chance of redemption even with a perfect final before the curve at this point, but they'd missed so many quizzes that even with the curve, some of them had to take 0's for some of their \"top 10\" quiz score. In the end, it turned out that all four of us regular students got high B's or A's, while the early start students' grades almost all got curved to D's or low C's.\n\nSo, what makes this a tale of petty revenge, and not just consequences of not attending and paying attention in class? If the professor had simply graded according to the original rubric, then many of the students would've failed, and since this was an expensive university, some of them would've had parents* who'd have called up the university and made a scene and appealed the grade, and perhaps may have gotten them reversed. If the professor had turned in everyone who cheated for academic dishonesty, which was an automatic failure, then the fallout would be even worse: Almost every single student's parents would be calling to appeal the decision, and in fact parents had threatened or attempted legal action over failing grades for academic dishonesty before, the academic dishonesty charges would likely be overturned because everyone would claim that they were the ones being copied from instead of the ones doing the copying, and if someone caved and admitted what the others had done, us four could've even potentially got dragged into it because we witnessed it and didn't report it. \n\nSo by using the curve that he did, the professor made their grades high enough that the students didn't fail the class, yet low enough that if they wanted to use the class as a pre-requisite or to fulfill a degree requirement, they would have to re-take it the same as if they'd failed any other way. Also, if parents attempted to file complaints with the university regarding their children's low grades, the professor would be able defend his actions by pointing  out that he in fact curved their grades higher than they would've otherwise been.\n\n*I had a friend who worked in the administrative offices, and according to her, although under federal law parents can't access their children's college records without permission, many students either sign something that gives their parents permission to access records that include grades, or will just show their grades to their parents if they want help getting it changed.\n\nTL;DR: Group of students skips most days of a summer class and openly cheats on the exams, but gives each other the wrong answers, resulting in failing grades and obvious evidence of cheating. Experienced math professor knows that giving F's and/or accusations of cheating incur the wrath of parents, so instead he curves the grades up far enough that the slackers and cheaters don't fail but will likely have to re-take the class - and the rest of us effectively get B's or A's for showing up and not cheating.",

The chiropractor I go to issues me a plastic card, which holds my personal info so that when I \"check in\" all the information pulls up on the docs screen.  About 25 visits go nicely.  Somehow, someway, I lose this ID.  I show up first time without it.  Kindly apologize for losing my ID.  She's way more annoyed than she should be, the type that wears their thoughts and emotions on their sleeve.  Gives me lots of attitude,\n\nAfter a long deep sigh and eyes rolling (I'm really taken back by her shitty behavior)\n\n\"Sir, I need $10\".\n\nfor what?\n\n\\*now smiling\\*  \"Its company policy to charge $10 for a replacement card\"\n\nI didnt' bring any cash today\n\n\\*smile vanished\\* \"I'll check you in TODAY but bring cash next visit PLEASE\"  \\*types my name in computer and all is well, (**I see first hand that bypassing the card was actually effortless and takes about 5 seconds\\***)\n\n**Day 2 without ID**\n\nI check in, same bitch behind the counter, she looks up and seems to recognize me, I cut her off-\n\n\"looked around for my ID at home and couldn't find it, could you check me in again?\"\n\n\"That'll be $10 for your replacement card sir\"\n\n\"damn I forgot my money\"\n\n\\*She's seething pissed, but I don't give a frenchman's fuck, her attitude is has been awful from the start and I've decided to make it my personal mission to finish out the next 2 remaining days at this place without spending $10 on a worthless replacement card, which I personally know costs only 40 cents each to buy blank mag swipe cards from being in the point of sale business\\*  I also now realize she has no power here and has to move me forward anyway, regardless of what she says because the Doc isn't going to turn down my money.\n\n**Day 3 without ID**\n\nI walk in the door, we make eye contact, never have I seen her get out of her chair faster, shes pokes her head out the little window as I'm hanging up my coat and says -\n\n\"I really hope you brought the $10 today because you're not getting service without it\"\n\n\"yea yea don't worry, I got it, just check me in like you been doing and I'll pay you when I cash out with my co-pay after the treatment.\"\n\n\\*she glares at me, closes the window, looks over to the other girl in the office behind her and and has lots of energy in her words that I can't hear but it's obviously about me\n\nI finish my fucking treatment, come back, hand her the $20 for my co-pay and start pretending to search my wallet\n\nShes starting to breathe heavy, anticipating Im about to fuck her over again, and shes right.\n\nI pat my pockets, hold open my wallet, \"Damn, looks like I only brought enough for the copay\"\n\n\"SIR, THAT CREDIT CARD IN YOUR  WALLET WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH\"\n\n\"Oh I never use my credit card unless its an emergency, sorry maybe next time!\"  (I can't help but grin while finishing this statement)  Her eyes are fire, she spent the last 20 minutes thinking she won our little game, and I just flipped the tables at the last second, and there's not a damn thing she can do about it.                      \n\nI turn around and head out the door, while her eyes are burning holes in my back, door closes and I'm cackling and laughing my ass off all the way to my car.  My back felt GREAT that day, it was my final visit.  They can shove their $10 \"policy\" up their asses.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "Apologies for formatting, mobile, tired high schooler, etc. \n\nThis actually happened a few hours ago. \n\nSo I’m bi. I‘be been out to most of the school for a while now, but not my parents. More recently however, I pulled the trigger and came out to them.  Now, my parents are very strict Christians. Homosexuality is a sin, no sex before marriage, etc. Whatever, I can live with it as long as I’m not kicked out. Anyways, my mother thinks I’m confused and my sister doesn’t care, but my father is very upset. He’s barely talked to me except to express his disappointment in the choices I’ve made. It hurts a bit, but I’m used to this kind of relationship with him. \n\nNow, we’ll call this little cuntbrain Hailey. Hailey is one of the richest kids in school, as well as one of the most self conceited. Juuling in the bathrooms, smoking weed everyday at 14/15, you know the type. So I made a really dumb joke about her being gay, and she responded by telling me she wasn’t “a fag”. Don’t get me wrong, I joke about being a fag with all my friends, but the context was obviously different. Naturally I got pretty offended and told her, she didn’t care, kept using the word. I cried the rest of the day. \n\nSo today, we had some weird emotional Kumbaya shit in homeroom, and her homeroom joined mine in Kumbaya-ing. At the very end, after poking fun and being bored for roughly an hour, I remembered Hailey was there. So, I decided to share about my coming out. Now, Hailey had been looking at me and smirking since the start of homeroom, and during my coming out story was no different. So I exaggerated just a teeny bit. I told the class how I’d come out, how my father hadn’t talked to me, hadn’t looked at me. And how it was all because I was *GAY*. *A homosexual. A fag, if you must.* By this point the rumors had already spread about how Hailey was homophobic, how she was offensive, disrespectful, etc. The look on her face by the end of my monologue was priceless. \n\nEdit: yes I know I was in the wrong too. That’s why it was a petty revenge. ",

        "text": "For many years, I worked as a supervisor in an office. As I oversaw the office when the bosses went home, I had a key. \n\nI started my career at that job. My two bosses were old crabby jerks, and had made me cry on many instances. I stayed because I was confortable although the bosses and co workers were something else.\n\nLast year, the head boss retired and a new boss was hired (nepotism, but that's a whole other story) and so Boss #2 had to answer to New Boss. He was not happy. \n\nBoss #2 has a horrible temper and will scream at anyone. I've heard him scream at his wife over the phone. We suspect he is bipolar. He hates having to answer to New Boss and is pretty much a human walking temper tantrum.\n\nSo, New Boss decides to clean house. I lose my job after almost ten years. Whatever. In May, Boss #2 tells me to stop by and return the key. Almost always, keys are never returned. I truly forget about it for the summer. I wasn't trying to be petty -- yet.\n\nLast week, Boss #2 starts sending me harassing emails to return the key. He's the type of person that \"screams\" in emails. I start getting annoyed since he says \"New Employee\" needs the key and um, yeah, I lost my job there because of New Boss. \n\nThe process of getting keys at this job is a nightmare. You have to pay first, get a receipt, then call the locksmith and find out if it's ready, and THEN pick it up at the security office. The process could take anywhere from 1-2 weeks (usually it's longer). It would be much easier for New Employee to get my old key as soon as I return it and skip the steps (and make my former bosses' lives a lot easier).\n\nToday he emails me \"YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU RETURNED IT!\"\n\nI knew New Boss was getting onto Boss #2 and he was taking it out on me. I still have the key at home, but I'm not going to let them think they can still treat me like I'm their subordinate and make their lives easier, especially after losing my job. Petty revenge time. \n\nAfter work (my new job) I call security and ask how much it costs to replace a key. They tell me it is $5. If I pay the money, my responsibility to the key is gone. Whoever wants a key (my former bosses and New Employee) has to go through the long process of requesting a new key as well as figuring out their schedules to let New Employee in since, alas, no key. \n\nI reply to Boss #2's email:\n\n\"Hi Boss #2 -- I lost the key. I will be going to security tomorrow and pay $5 for the replacement key. Have a great day!\"\n\nI know he's still cursing me out at his desk. Not my problem anymore. I'm sure he thought his bullying would result in me handing it back so they wouldn't have to deal with the process of ordering a new one and having the New Employee wait. Nope, you will have to accomdate New Employee until they get their key. $5 in pettiness well spent.\n\nEdit: Clarity\n\nEdit 2: More Clarity\n\nUpdate: Didn't go to security today. Oops...\n\nUpdate 2: I have no plan on paying the $5. Boss #2 hasn't contacted me yet.",
