        "text": "Hi r/GlitchInTheMatrix members,\n\nThere have been an influx on non-glitch posts in the subreddit lately so we would just like to clear up what content fits in the subreddit and what content doesn’t belong here.\n\n**RULE 4: WHAT’S A ‘GLITCH’:**\n\nAs you may have already guessed, this subreddit is meant to be a place to posts “glitches” that happen **in real life.** This means that “software glitches” or “digital glitches” are not allowed. This can include but not limited to: game glitches, social media glitches, or device software glitches.\n\nEDITED/PHOTOSHOPPED CONTENT:\n\nPhotoshopped content is not allowed in this subreddit, as it is technically not something that happened “in real life”.\n\nNON-GLITCH POSTS/POSTS THAT INCLUDE NORMAL PHYSICS\n\nFurthermore, posts that include realistic movement/physics are also not allowed. This can include but is not limited to: Regular shadow movement, Regular cloud movement, or Regular animal movement, all which we have seen on this subreddit.\n\nThe mod team is trying our best to remove non glitch posts, but sometimes we can miss some. So if you see any posts that break **ANY** of the subreddit rules, please report them to us using the “report” button found under all posts. If you have any questions, feel free to modmail us or leave a comment below!\n\nThank you!",

This past weekend I took time to cleanse my third eye through meditation, which was extremely difficult this time for some reason, and the nights that followed left me with terrible nightmares of my mother, memories of her attacking me and my father. I learned yesterday the cause of this, over the weekend, directly after my initial meditation, my homeless mother stabbed a man and was put in jail. I'd like to think that this is mere coincidence, but this feels more of a clear/obvious measures of what is generally seen as precognition/premonition. ",

No keys.\n \nAt this point I’m so desperate that I decide to just look in the cushions of the couch I wasn’t sitting on that is across the room. \n\nI slip my hands between the cushions, swipe them through quickly because I’m not expecting to find anything, something that sounds like keys makes a noise on the floor. I look on the floor underneath the couch and my keys are there.\n\nWhat’s weird is when I first started looking, I decided to look in the couch cushions on the couch I was actually on, because thats where I last remembered having them. \n\nThe keys fell down in the right spot  but were inside the wrong couch... \nif someone had mirrored where I had sat on the original couch onto this one, the keys fell down from the exact same place they would have if that makes sense.\n\nI know this isn’t super crazy or weird and is pretty ordinary. \n\nI’ve read other stories where things are found in mirrored areas or completely different places from where they should be, and honestly it’s these weird simple little things that seem the most glitchy to me. \n\n\n",

I found out a couple months ago about the “glitch in the matrix” stories on YouTube which I very much relate to because strange and unexplainable things have happened to me throughout my life, especially when I was younger. I remember asking my parents about it or trying to explain to other people, but I never really had the words for these experiences because they just didn’t really make sense. While some of the things I’ve experienced may be on a more spiritual level, I have definitely noticed things that made me question whether we’re in some sort of program or not. As someone with an engineering background, it’s hard to dismiss the possibility.\nAnyway, I’m here to connect with other glitch experiencers, maybe share some stories that I haven’t yet heard about. After listening to hours of these glitch stories on YouTube, there definitely seems to be some kind of patterns or similarities between a lot of them..",

        "text": "I just (re)discovered this sub reddit and I feel compelled to tell you guys about a weird experience I had that has always fascinated me.\n\nI went to sleep and I had a terrible nightmare/dream. I wish I could remember all of the details, but I simply can't. Even when I woke up, I could not remember the cinematics of the dream except that I had died a terrible death involving a wall of flame.\n\nI'm getting ready for school and I'm talking to my dad in the kitchen of our house. I decide to tell him about my dream because it really freaked me out.\n\nI always had really vivid dreams, so as I would tell them I would improvise details I couldn't quite remember to preserve the quality. After all, nobody gives a shit about your dreams most of the time.\n\nI couldn't quite remember the exact setting, so I told him I was on the streets of a big city. There were people walking everywhere, and then all of sudden, there was a huge explosion and a ball of fire that radiated and burned everything. I saw all of the people around me run in horror and then get burned alive. And then wall of fire surrounded me. \n\nNow at the time my parents were really devout Christians, and I felt a level of shame that I had died in the fire or something, so I threw in that Christ had appeared and told me to be at peace and that he had saved me. I can't be 100% sure that this didn't actually happen in my dream now that I'm so much older, I'd like to think it did, but I remember a level of disception about my retelling of the dream.\n\nI go to school and the 9/11 attacks happen. I was in 5th grade so I got sent home. I got a detention before we left though because I made a joke about how we should just bomb every other country and we'd get the country that did it. (Also fairly predictive)\n\nI get home and my dad starts freaking out about the dream I told him that I had completely forgotten about. I was freaked out by it and took all of his praise but I was embarrassed because I felt I had fabricated most of the dream. I was 11 so I didn't understand that me fabricating the dream that morning was just as crazy as me actually having it.\n\nI had forgotten this experience but my dad periodically brings it up at family events. The last time we got together he brought it up and it made me realize just how weird it was.\n\nI know the whole 9/11 dream thing is cliche, but this actually happened to me. I wouldn't completely believe it myself but my dad still won't shut up about it 17 years later.\n\nI'm not even a guy who fully believes in the paranormal, in fact, I probably wouldn't believe in it at all if I hadn't had these kinds of experiences firsthand. Almost all of my paranormal experiences happened in the same house I had the dream in. It was such an insane house.\n\nHave you guys ever had an experience like this? Have you almost predicted the future while in a concious state?",

It sounds pretty nuts,but I’m hoping I could get some theories as to what happened. I’m a junior in college. Back in my sophomore year of high school,I had a dream where I made time travel. When I woke up,I wrote down as much as I could remember of my theories and findings I made in my dream. I talked to my science teachers about it and everything. I sent it to my friend in Washington who wanted to see it. After a week r 2,they sent it back. Now.....this is the weird part. I set the paper on the table in front of me. I dropped my pencil and reached down and picked it up. When I came back up,my paper was gone. I moved the table,looked under everything around it. It just vanished in thin air. If it’s Mandela Effect,have you ever noticed something disappear from the timeline after a split second? Or is it usually waking up in the morning with a changed world? I know it sounds crazy,but I have no idea what happened. It’s been all these years and I’ve just now decided to ask people about it. Originally,when it disappeared,I figured someone from the future (or even myself) swiped it,as I was discovering it too soon. But nobody was there,I would’ve saw someone with my peripheral vision. Was there a glitch in the matrix that sucked my theory away? And yes,throughout the years,I’ve memorized it and added on to it,but only mentally. I haven’t written it down or typed it anywhere since. Please help me out. ",

        "text": "I'm writing this because of something that happened to me as a kid that has managed to bug me off and on for most of my life after it occurred. When I was 7 years old my father, mother, and myself decided to go to a park that was near the elementary school I was attending at the time.\n\nThe park had an extremely large staircase in it, and naturally my dad and I raced to the top. I finished about half a dozen steps behind him and we both sat down at the top completely exhausted to wait for mom. I began to notice that while I was catching my breath, my dad seemed to be having just as much difficulty breathing as he did right after stopping. I remember making a joke about him being old and he just smiled and leaned back, putting his hands over his head to try and get more air. \n\nBy the time my mother made it to the top, he was still showing no signs of catching his breath. Unbeknownst to me he had struggled with a type of exercise induced asthma for his entire life; he only rarely had attacks but they were frequent enough that he always had an inhaler in his vehicle or suitcase while traveling.\n\nA couple minutes after my mother made it to the top, his breathing had started becoming ragged and we all realized that something was wrong.  He said he was going to get his inhaler, but the wobbliness with which he rose caused my mom to insist that we both stay at the top while she ran down and grabbed it. \n\nI sat in a painful and helpless silence, the sound of my father's progressively gasping breaths filling the air. However, when my mother had made it about halfway down the staircase, my dad began to speak. The words came out slowly, only 1 or 2 per breath. He asked me if I had ever heard of someone, a man whose name I wouldn't remember for many years to come. He asked me if I knew about the Temple of Solomon. Finally, he asked me what I knew of Baphomet.\n\nI was very devout as a child, and assured him that I had heard of the temple of Solomon. I started listing out the various biblical facts I remembered, how many shekels of gold, that the cedar wood came from Lebanon, etc.  I don't remember exactly what I was saying when he held up a finger, signaling for me to stop and let him say something else. But by that point, his respiratory distress had progressed to the point where he couldn't even speak.\n\nI looked down the staircase to see my mom taking stairs two at a time like a champ, and shortly thereafter my father had his medication and was breathing relatively normally again. We decided that was enough excitement for one day, and went down the stairs back to our vehicle to drive home.\n\nTo understand the next part of my story, I'll have to explain a little bit about the way my memory works. I'd say I have a decent memory, but it's certainly not photographic or exceptional except in one aspect. When I see a word or phrase I've read or heard before, I get a peculiar itching sensation in my brain. This might not initially sound very useful, but with our education system's reliance on multiple choice questions I've been able to skirt through basically every class without really studying or learning the material. I just look for the answer that's familiar.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when as a high-schooler I was writing a paper on The Crusades and during my research into the various knightly orders found a name that sent those same resonant pangs of familiarity through me. Jacques de Molay. The last grandmaster of the Knights Templar. As I read more about him, I came across accounts of the Temple of Solomon and the accusations of worshipping a deity referred to as Baphomet that were leveled against the Knights Templar. \n\nWith all three pieces of the puzzle in place, it became clear to me that Jacques de Molay must have been the man my father was asking me about on the staircase. Despite his incredible memory, on the three occasions I've asked him about the conversation he claims not only to not remember it, but also to not remember our race to the top of the staircase or his asthma attack. My mother agrees that both of those things happened, but obviously wasn't there for the conversation because she was running to get the inhaler.\n\nSo now I've been stuck with the question: Did any of this even happen? Was he trying to tell me something because he was afraid he might die before my mom made it back with his inhaler? Was it the ramblings of an oxygen deprived brain? Why is this the only conversation I've had with him that he can't seem to remember?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",
