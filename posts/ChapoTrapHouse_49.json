Of course she can use the list that I posted (if she is active in here) as a help-tool. Shapiro makes many wrong statements about trans people and data and i think it is time that Natalie does a video about this like she has on Peterson. Shapiro gets more debunked on yt about other stuff but no bigger youtuber has ever made a debunking video on his nonsense on the trans topic. \n\nOf course if you have more videos/articles/blogs where he gets debunked, simply post it in the comments :-)\n\nBut also to be honest, I dont care THAT much if Natalie or hbomb or shaun does that debunking...or maybe two of them or all three of them do an epic debunking video, blasting Shapiro and show even more what a hack he really is. \n\nBut I really DO think that someone please finally does this &gt;.&lt;",
