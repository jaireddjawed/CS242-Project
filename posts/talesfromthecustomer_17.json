        "text": "This is technically a story from an airport so idk if that sort of stuff's okay for this sub - if not let me know where else I could repost it. Also since this was a while ago I don't remember all the details but I'll be as accurate as possible.\n\nAnyway, three months ago my family (parents, teenage brother, 10 year old sister with mild learning difficulties) and I went on a trip to Cambodia for half-term holidays. Instead of taking Cathay or some other bigger budget airline, we went with a local airline, InsertCountryHere Airways because it was cheaper. \n\nNow, where I'm from ridiculous bureaucracy about everything is a part of every day life, from drama competitions to filling up gas, so my parents came prepared. My dad had done some googling and worked out that you can actually get visas at the border when you arrive, but you can also get them printed in advance, which he did because he wanted to be helpful and efficient (sweet sweet irony). Also, my mum found out a few weeks back that my sister's passport was due to expire shortly before the trip, so she got her an emergency passport to last for the trip AND notified the airline beforehand and got confirmation that they knew about it by email.\n\nSo we get into check-in, my siblings and I are full of beans and at first everything goes fine.\n\nThen my mum hands over my sister's emergency passport.\nAnd the guy at the desk has no clue what to do with it. He was an absolutely gormless person. Looks like someone who'd get a braingasm from having some parasite in his head telling him what to do all the time.\n\nSo we were a bit annoyed when he called someone over to check the passport, but it's kinda understandable.\nAbout 20 minutes later, there were four blobfish-brained staff members crowded around the desk, not understanding what could possibly be done with this government issued document. When they finally actually listened to my mum and tried to call some other air personnel to see if they had my sister down as having this passport, turns out they didn't! So we clearly must be frauds because THEY didn't take note of it and my mum's evidence of an email FROM THE AIRLINE VERIFYING IT wasn't good enough!\n\nEventually some higher-up in the place must have decided that we were in the clear, and we all lived happily ever after, free to travel for a week of relaxing in a historically marvelous place.\n\nNOPE!\n\nRemember those visas my dad didn't technically have to print out but did anyway? The first desk-ridden blobfish checked them after our passports were cleared. There was a typo on one of them...so it didn't match the passport...and all of purgatory broke loose. Again.\n\nOne of my sister's middle names is Susannah and they'd spelled it Suzannah. It was an understandable error, especially when you're giving visa info over the phone to people who speak english as a second language.\n\nSo we had to stand there for 40 minutes watching my parents try and trepann some sense into the checkin guppy drones over a perfectly understandable typo. Because we can't have any 10 year old terrorists entering Cambodia, now can we. She probably only burst into tears and thought the whole thing was her fault because she was caught red-handed. Dickheads...\n\nAnd the real turd in this whole shit sandwich? Even if the visa wouldn't have been acceptable, WE COULD HAVE STILL GOT THEM AT THE BORDER. My dad knew this, he could pull up the exact webpage, and he tried to, but they weren't interested in looking and insisted that they couldn't let us board because we were at too much risk of not being able to get past border controls.\n\nI can't remember exactly how the stick ended up being tugged out of their collective asses, but eventually they backed down and sent someone to escort us to our gate so we wouldn't miss the flight. We still got our plane in the end but only after much rushing and trying to get my sister to stop thinking she ruined everything.\n\nWhen we got to the Cambodian border, the border guard didn't recognize my sister's emergency passport. She went to see someone on the next desk for a minute or so, approved it, either didn't notice the visa typo or didn't care, and apologized for the delay.\n\nNo thanks to the work of the dunderheaded assbrained cerebrally jizz-filled check-in staff of InsertCountryHere Airways.",

She tried entering the barcoded number directly, no go.  Asked me if I knew how much it cost, I quoted a price but because the cooler was just a few steps away, I told her I'd run down there and confirm.  Came back, gave her the actual price - which was a few dollars more than what I'd quoted - she rang me up and I went on my way.\n\nIt wasn't until I'd gotten home and checked my receipt that I realized that she didn't charge me the bottle deposit.  Maybe it was an oversight but she *did* charge the deposit on another 6-pack I'd purchased.  And here in Oregon, at .10/bottle, that's more than a minor oversight.\n\nRegardless, thanks checkout lady!",

While I was filling the tank I heard a beep but the gas kept flowing so I just continued filing. I then went to work and noticed that the app was showing me that my payment had been cancelled. I also have Apple Pay so I always get a pop-up whenever my card has been used and nothing came up. \n\nI stopped by the station on my way home after being worried all day about getting in trouble from the police. I went to the clerk who was working explained the situation, the time I was there and offered to pay for the whole thing. He told me not to worry about it, and that it wasn't worth searching for the receipt. I left him my name and number and told him to call me if he found it.\n\nIt's been about 3 weeks now and no call.

I don't even sneak on the bus without paying, even when it's more practical to do so.\n\nSo today I'm using the self-checkout kiosk at the supermarket.  You scan the item, you place it on the scale.  Scan the next item, place it on the scale, etc...\n\nI have a 4 pack of Guinness held together by plastic rings.  I scan a can but it only registers as one beer.  I try to scan it again, but it tells me to place the next item on the scale before scanning.\n\nI wave down the attendant and show him the issue.  I don't want to break the 4-pack apart, but I need to scan the other three beers.  He tells me to put the 4-pack on the scale.  I do so.  He waves his passcard and punches through the menu until the \"scan next item\" screen displays again.\n\nBut the thing is...I've only been charged for one beer.  \"There you go!\" he says, kind of sleepy eyed, maybe full of contempt for the job, maybe asleep at the wheel.  \"Are you sure?\" I ask knowingly, not wanting to be a dick, but still uncomfortable.  \"Yep, go ahead.\" he assures me.\n\nSo, I ring up the rest of my items.  Pay with my debit card.  Bag it all up.  I have to wave him down again to take the security tag off my bottle of liquor.  He makes me show him the receipt first.  Uhh...okay?\n\nSo now I have 4 beers for the price of one and I have to get it off my chest to you guys because it just don't feel right, y'know?  Corporate supermarket, corporate beer, but still.  I dunno.  Irish beer, Irish guilt.",

        "text": "A little back story first, I work for a company that requires me to buy a lot of random housewares, so shopping at everyone's favourite big American box store is a regular part of my job. I've learned a lot of tricks to get through check out faster (like, ALWAYS use the self check out when possible) but today was not my day. \n\nI had a larger than normal shopping trip and had a small window to get it done in. I needed a paper towel holder amongst many other things and lost some time finding it, turns out there was only one left, in my haste to grab it and move on I failed to notice it was missing a price tag. \n\nWhen I went to check out, I had far more than the 20 items that self check out is limited to, so I had to interact with a person. Boo. Of course there were long, slow lines with not enough cashiers on shift in typical box store fashion. I calmly waited for my turn, and while the cashier rang my items through we notice that 3 of the clothes hangers in a 30 pack are broken. I tell her to keep scanning I'm in too much of a hurry to care. \n\nShe then comes across the paper towel holder, and I realise my mistake. She calls over to what I can only (hope) assume is a very new employee before I can offer to go myself. She asks for him to go check the price and he gets confused. She explains clearly that he needs to go to housewares and locate the same item and get the price. He proceeds to put the paper towel holder down in her return item pile and call it job well done... She explains for a third time and he seemed to have finally understood what was needed and heads in the right direction. The cashier and I have a bit of a laugh at his expense after he leaves.\n\nI resign myself to lose way to much of my life in this venture. I decide that I'll go switch out the broken hangers while I wait because there is no way he will be back before me. If he hadn't taken what I know to be the only paper towel holder I would have just gone and gotten another while I switched the hangers.\n\nIn this particular store, housewares is nowhere near where they keep the laundry bins and hangers etc. So when I go to grab the new set of hangers and find my price checker wandering around looking confused I figure enough is enough and I simply don't have the time to let him figure it out himself. \n\nI walk up to him and explain he isn't even in the right section. I ask him to give me the holder and politely advised him I would take care of it. I went on my way at a fast pace. I hear him following behind me. I again explain I've got this, carry on. He continues to follow me. I find the correct area and grab a photo of the price and sku. He also takes a photo of the price and sku, practically pushing me out of the way to get it...\n\nI walk back towards the check out and try to explain again that he is not needed and can go. He practically runs to beat me back to the cashier. He tells her the price and explains that it was the last one and shows her the photo. At this point I let it go, I'll have another laugh with the cashier when he leaves. She copies the sku and tallies up my bill and prompts me for payment. He stays. Waits for the whole process. Waits for me to retrieve my cart and bill and leave all while standing awkwardly with the cashier who has made it very apparent he is no longer needed.\n\nI guess he just really wanted to look useful...\n\n",

So i hop on my bike, go get the food, then get to the ice cream place. \n\nFirst red flag: there us only one car in the parking lot during what should be a lunch rush.\n\nBut whatever I though maybe it was just a slow day. I walk inside.\n\nSecond red flag: All the lights in the store are off\n\nBut I REALLY did want some ice cream. I check to make sure the sign says open, and it does. I walk up to the counter, nobody there. \n\nSo I'm thinking to myself \"what the hell?!\"\n\nThem I look down. On the counter is an older gentleman of asian ethnicity, between 60-70 years of age, unconscious.\n\nMy first thought was that he was dead. So i say \"hello?\" to make sure.\n\nHe doesn't move an inch. Uh oh. I try again. \"Uh...Hello?\" he wakes up with \"Wha? What do you want?\" I'm relieved that this man is alive, And I make my order.\n\n\"Can I get a small death by chocolate ice cream and a large cookie dough Ice cream please?\"\n\nHe gives me an angry look, and moves to the register. This guy takes 5 minutes, FIVE MINUTES, to put 2 items into the register.\n\nHe says \"Nine seventy three\", referring to the total price. I hand him a ten, and he takes another 3 minutes to give me my change, which I politely put into the tip jar.\n\nHe goes to make the ice creams. It takes him over 15 minutes and by this point I'm mildly irked, but whatever, I'm a patient person. He walks over to the counter with the ice creams in hand, still moving slower than a dead turtle in molasses. \n\nI grab a lid and place it on the larger ice cream, however the smaller ice cream has a good 2-4 spoonfuls worth of ice cream on top, so i figured i'd eat it with a spoon real quick.\n\nI reach for it, my eyes looking directly at it. I blink and it's gone. I look up and this man has the ice cream cup IN HIS HAND. He moved so fast I thought he might be the real flash. \n\nHe says \"Too much Ice Cream\". He walks back to the ice cream machine. Now when you mix this particular kind of ice cream, you do it in the cup. There are these metal funnel type objects that prevent the ice cream from flying out of the cup during the mixing process. The man takes the funnel, and in one quick motion, SCRAPES MY EXTRA ICE CREAM INTO. THE. TRASH.\n\nHe then walks back to the counter, forcefully puts the ice cream down in front of me, I'm talking he full on slammed it down, looked me in the eyes and said \"Have nice day\". \n\nI was absolutely flabbergasted. I had no response. I just said thank you, grabbed my ice creams, and left. I got on my bike and rode home, still unable to comprehend that almost half hour adventure.",

I went to the Billfold page to do so, but was met with an error stating the card is tied to an active subscription and cannot be removed.\n\nThe active subscription is a phone plan also owned by this same company. I never signed up for this plan, but I vaguely remember considering doing so last year and checked out the website. I never received any bills and even in Billfold I have no statements and the due amount is $0, so I'm not worried of being charged. I still wanted the card details removed though. I contacted support.\n\nI was in support chat for over 2 hours, and they kept sending me back-and-forth from the Billfold team to the phone plan team. The phone plan team said they couldn't find a subscription tied to me, and the Billfold team said they couldn't remove the card until the phone plan team cancelled my subscription.\n\nFinally, this convo happened with a phone plan support guy (word for word except company names):\n\n&gt; Support:  I checked with my specialist team and I'd like to inform you that you've just signed up to [phone plan name]. Once you activate the SIM your subscription will be removed.\n\n&gt; Me:  What? I didn't sign up.\n\n&gt; Support:  I mean you just tried to signup, but you haven't.\n\n&gt; Me:  Yes, I was checking to see what [phone plan] was because I forgot.\n\n&gt; Me:  But I wasn't trying to sign up. And I'm not going to sign up.\n\n&gt; Support: I do understand. So our higher support is stating that in order to cancel subscription you need to activate services and then cancel services.\n\n&gt; Me:  So I need to buy a phone. Then cancel the services. I don't have a compatible phone for [phone plan]. \n\n&gt; Support:  I can imagine your situation. But at this time this is the only option available.\n\n&gt; Me:  So you're telling me because of a bug, I have to buy a phone. Just to remove card details from my Billfold account, or to \"cancel\" a subscription that I never started.\n\n&gt; Support:  I know how you feel. I'll surely take this as a feedback and pass it to concern team. You can also give feedback from [phone plan] app.\n\nI'm at a loss for words, honestly. This is the most ridiculous advice I've ever received from support.",

        "text": "A little backstory, about four years ago in my early 20s I suddenly started having severe allergic reactions to a variety of foods. After multiple rounds of testing I can now confidently say that I’m severely allergic (as in anaphylactic) to thing like seeds, pitted fruits, raw or even undercooked vegetables, etc. You get the picture. They’re not things people commonly pretend to be allergic or sensitive to, though I am also allergic to nuts which is pretty common. \n\nAnyways, I’ve gotten into the habit of never eating out and just generally cooking and baking everything for myself from scratch. However, every once in a while while traveling, visiting family, or going out with friends, I’ll find myself at a restaurant. I don’t like making a big fuss with an order, so if I don’t feel confident that there are safe menu options that wouldn’t require twenty modifications, then I just won’t order anything and will just enjoy the company of whoever I’m with. \n\nOver the holidays I was visiting my family and they wanted to go out and have a nice family dinner one night. Since we knew ahead of time, we drew up a list of potential restaurants, looked at their menus online, and even called one place with a few questions. Finally we settled on a place that had some options with your basic poultry proteins. \n\nWe get there, sit down, I double check that I have the correct dish remembered, and wait for the waitress to get back with the drinks and take our order. I order last, a baked chicken dish that came with some type of fancy mashed potato side and a sauce I didn’t recognize. I asked for the chicken to be put on a plate by itself (to prevent cross contamination) because I wasn’t sure about the ingredients in the potatoes and sauce. I specifically asked for the sauce to be left off the chicken as I had multiple food allergies, but thought my siblings or parents might want the potatoes. \n\nSo eventually our order comes, and the waitress plops down a plate of chicken sitting on a mountain of potatoes, absolutely drenched in sauce. I just look at her dumbstruck. She starts to walk away making me feel even more awkward as I have to call her back and tell her I can’t eat it. \n\nI reminded her that I had asked for the chicken to be plated separately due to my allergies. \n\nWaitress: I checked with the kitchen and none of this has gluten, so it’s fine. \n\nMe: I’m not allergic to gluten. I never said I was. I can’t eat this as it is. \n\nWaitress: Are you sure, there’s nothing weird in the dish. \n\nAt this point I’m more than a little frustrated so I just go into my purse pull out the two epipens I always have on me and put them out on the table. \n\nMe: Do you want to take that chance, because I don’t. \n\nShe kind of huffed and took the dish back. I got a fresh one a few minutes later with the chicken on a small plate all by itself, and I did not have a reaction that night. My brother really enjoyed the potatoes that they came with in a separate dish. \n\nIn the end it all ended well, but I was so frustrated because my modification should have been pretty simple, just separate plating, but it turned into something of a showdown. I realize that some people fake their allergies or sensitivities at restaurants, but if don’t assume everyone does. ",

        "text": "First time posting here, hope it’s all right. \n\n\nFirst, some background. I had a package shipped to me from online store , not realizing that the office that I shipped it to was the old office, the company had just moved to a new office. Did not realize this until it had an attempted delivery. So, they hold it at the customer center 15 miles away. I call them the day before it’s supposed to be returned to sender, and get connected to the first rep. I give him the details, and he asks me for the tracking number. I give it to him. \n\n CS rep: CSR\nME: ME\n\nCSR: I see here that your package is held at a Carrier  location in [town]. \n\nMe: yes, I would like it to be delivered to a different address. \n\nCSR: sure let me help you, give me a moment. \n\nMe: Sure. \n\nCSR: alright, it will be delivered tomorrow. Is there anything else I can help you with? \n\nMe: wait, I wanted it delivered at a different address.\n\nCSR: oh ok sure. Can you tell me the address?\n\nMe: sure, here it is (tells address) \n\nCSR: ok, done. It will be delivered there tomorrow. Have a nice day! \n\nMe: you too! Click. \n\n\nNotice that this guy didn’t even ask for address verification or anything. It seemed kind of weird. Every time I call shipping carriers, they tell me to verify address and name. I figure I’ll just wait a day, ok. Package doesn’t show up. So I check tracking and it says returning to sender. I call them back. \n\nThis time, the guy asks me for address verification before anything else. Ok, great. I tell him all the info, what happened the day before. He tells me that they can’t do anything once it has been Held at the customer center, and the only party that can do anything about it is the online store. So, basically the first guy told me a complete load of BS! I don’t know how that even works.",

        "text": "I called an my ISP on Dec 31st (sunday) to set up a service. It took about an hour and a half due to long wait times, but otherwise seemed to have gone smoothly. They told me that they would ship me a router by that Friday (the 5th) and that by next Thursday (the 11th) the service would be activated and I would perform a self install (no technician would come out). The router did not arrive so I gave it until yesterday (the 8th) to call in and check on it.\n\nA man, D, listened to my story (after a long wait) and looked into it. D said that the order had somehow been stalled after payment was (successfully) processed but before it could go to the dispatch, and so the router was never sent at all. He told me that due to the shipping mixup and unavailability of technicians my service would not be able to begin until the 25th when a tech had an opening. That would be more than 2 and a half MORE weeks of waiting.\n\nSo I argued that this was unacceptable, since a technician was not actually needed, and simply shipping the router would take far less time. D agreed that this was the case, but that it was impossible for him to do because of how the order had been flagged in the system. After much conferring with his advisors and/or co-workers with experience on similar problems, D proposed a solution. He told me that I could call back earlier in the day on Tuesday and to ask to speak with dispatch, who would indeed be able to escalate the issue and \"drop ship\" the router. I spent about 2 hours and 20 minutes on the phone on monday.\n\nSO today, tuesday the 9th I called and was greeted by M. M was a raging thundercunt who was mighty inconvenienced by my problem's existence. I explained the story as above, and asked if he could direct me to dispatch. He was unwilling or unable, told me I'd just have to deal with the installation being delayed to the 25th, and eventually surprised-transferred me to another gentleman. Call him R.\n\nR was had a very thick accent and I had to ask him to repeat about half of everything he said, but he still able to transfer me to the dispatch within about 10 minutes, including my retelling of the story so far.\n\nW was the man who could supposedly solve my problem. I told him my story once again and he looked into it with me on hold. When he returns W blows my mind by telling me that there was never to be a router sent, because i had a technician scheduled to do the installation on the 11th. According to W, it had never been a self-install, and the appointment was already set. This was fully acceptable to me (I had no preference to self installation) but I was baffled. How had no one else seen this when they looked at my order information? W assured me that the appointment was set and everything was in order for the 11th, and we ended the call.\n\nI wanted to believe but as strange as it all was, I called back one more time to confirm the appointment. I told my story yet again and asked the lady to check on my appointment. She answered \"Yup you're all set for the 23rd at ---\" We were disconnected. No one called back. I was so lost and confused. At no point previously had the 23rd ever been mentioned. So I called again.\n\nJ answered and I told him my story. By this time it was a VERY LONG STORY. J assured me that he would fix it and that he is a straight shooter. We chatted while he contacted dispatch, who aparrently are present until late in the evening (which it now was), despite what D told me about their hours before. J then told me that it seemed I had originally been scheduled for an installation on the 11th, and that it indeed was replaced by the 23rd at some point. However he was able to switch it back. So once again I was told that I had an appointment on the 11th, and once again I called back afterward to confirm.\n\nAnd what do you know, they were able to confirm it!\nIt seems that J has finally freed me from this nightmare, provided they actually show up. Cause who knows at this point. What a goddam hero.\n\nTLDR; people at the ISP call center spend 7 hours telling me wildly varying stories about my order and how to fix it\n\n",

        "text": "I just have to get this off my chest because I'm so frustrated after dealing with this.\n\nI recently had surgery and missed some work. To protect my job, I put in a request for a leave of absence. I've done this before with no problems but this time, the company that handles the requests for the place I worked has just...sucked so bad. \n\nLets start from the beginning:\n\nThe day I find out I'll be having the surgery, I call to arrange the leave. I want to be on top of it and get everything dealt with so I'm not waiting until the last minute. My surgery is scheduled for the next day and I also explained I'd missed 5 of the last 8 days due to this while waiting to get in to see my doctor (kidney stone issues resulting it it needing to be removed). They said that it would be put in as an intermittent leave and back dated to cover the lost days. \n\nThe next day, I stop by my doctor's office before my surgery and drop off the paperwork they need to fax in with instructions asking them to fax it in within 2 days. They actually faxed it in that day.\n\nAbout 6 days later when I'm finally not in pain from the stent, I email in the discharge papers from the emergency room which they told me would cover the days lost before surgery. \n\nI wait two days and call in to see if they received the paperwork. The person I spoke to confirmed that both sets of paperwork were received and that my return date was set (something important to note is that they have to have the paperwork with the return date or a release before I am allowed to return to work, otherwise I wouldn't be able to clock in)\n\nLater that day, I receive a call stating that they only received the discharge papers that I emailed in and not the doctor's paperwork. I also find out that the person who put in the initial request put it in as a continuous leave, only covering the week after surgery and not the previous days. I'm told that they need a release for me to be cleared to return to work in two days since they don't have the paperwork. I explain that I've been told it was received already, and that the case should have been intermittent and back dated. They say they'll call me back and put in another request for backdating it as intermittent.\n\nI called my doctor, confirmed they sent in the paperwork the day of the surgery. I then get a call back from the leave people saying they found the paperwork and that they won't need the release since the paperwork has the date and I'm good to return to work. Yay. The final decision would still take a few days. I go to work, clock in without issue and continue on with life.\n\nI get a call the next day about the new request for the intermittent leave that was backdated telling me I wasn't eligible for intermittent because I hadn't worked there long enough (The person who opened the original case and the person who opened the new one both should have been able to tell me this prior.) So I just accept that I'm going to get a warning for the previous lost time but I at least want to get the week of the surgery covered and that is being done on the original one so whatever, I'll accept it.\n\nI didn't hear anything for 2 weeks, no email, no call, nothing. Then I get a letter stating that they haven't received all paperwork so I call in again. At this point, I'm really frustrated with all of this and I get the most condescending, uncaring person possible on the phone. I explained what was going on and I asked them to look into it because the paperwork had essentially been found and lost 2 times to this point. They wouldn't even investigate it and would just say \"I can't see what's not here\", saying that they only had a blank document with no information (then how was my return date confirmed before?).\n\n I won't deny I was venting a bit but it wasn't directed at them. At one point I said \"I'm tired of dealing with this shit.\" I'm actually crying after talking with her for a while because of how frustrating this has all been. She warned me that if I cussed again she would end the call. (I'm not sure who considers Shit a cuss word, but whatever, I don't repeat it again.). The only option I'm getting is to have my doctor send in the paperwork again. She starts asking for my doctors information. I give her the name and she asks if it is my primary care doctor or the emergency room doctor. It's neither, it's a specialist I had to see and I explained that it's the doctor that is in the case, the one I've already provided all of the information she is requesting for (office number, fax number, etc. This was all requested and provided when I first opened the case. I didn't have it on hand to provide again.). She tells me I'm not understanding her and I repeat myself. I had to repeat myself three times, the last time raising my voice because I am just sick of it at this point. I did not cuss at all either but she hung up on me. \n\nI call back and get a different person who isn't any more helpful. They won't investigate, they just say it's not there, they won't acknowledge the previous calls that said it was or the fact that they apparently had enough information two weeks ago to approve the return to work. The only option I have is to have my doctor send it in again.\n\nI've called my doctor and spoke with one of the receptionists and they're going to talk with the person who handles these to see if it can be sent in again. At this point, I now have 5 days to sort all of this because they give 4 weeks to get all of the paperwork in. Even though I had everything I needed sent in within a week of the start date, if I can't get everything in again in 5 days without them losing it again, I'm basically fucked.\n\nThe last call to those guys, I asked for a supervisor and I'm waiting for a call back on it now. Maybe I just want to complain but, holy shit, pretty much everyone who has touched my case at this point as messed something up.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nSo I got a call from the supervisor. Guess what? They found the paperwork. It was still attached to an old case. They also confirmed that the agents who just blew this off would have had tools to look up everything that had been received but they just didn't do it. They're reviewing the call for teh one who hung up on me.\n\nThis also opened a whole mess of other issues because I've gotten more information about certain timeframes that I wasn't given before. So...now there's more shit to deal with.\n\nAnd I'm not confident that they will not lose the paperwork again.\n\nOn the plus side, the surgery coordinater for my doctor who handles all of this paperwork has said that if they lose the paper work again that she'd be calling them to give them a piece of her mind (I like her).",

But was in California during the big drought, so restaurants didn't give you glasses of water unless you specifically asked for it.  \n\nSo the waiter comes and delivers our drinks, except for mine. My aunts both got iced tea I think, so I was the only one getting water. We order our food, and I  ask our waiter about the water.

No water yet. We flag him down and ask again. He apologizes again and promises to get it.  \n\nMore time passes with no, and he comes by our table with the food. We ask him again about the water. He kinda facepalms and apologizes profusely, but because my family is very polite and non-confrontational and the waiter has been very nice and provided good service otherwise, we assure him it's alright.  \n\nMaybe 5? minutes pass and he returns, water glass in hand, but also with another drink. He places it in front of me and says that it's his favorite drink and made it himself, on the house as an apology! I was surprised and thanked him a lot. It was an iced coffee drink, and I usually hate coffee, but I took a sip and instantly loved it. It didn't taste too strongly of coffee, and mostly tasted like chocolate milk with whipped cream and a hint of cinnamon. It was delicious! We left a big tip for him, he definitely deserved it.  \n\nWhen I visited my aunts again a year later or so, we returned to that restaurant and I asked our waiter (different person) about the coffee drink. Nothing like it existed on their menu. The guy had made a special drink just for me! I was a little disappointed though... I wanted another one.",

As he's doing this one of his co-workers comes over and literally pushes him out from in front of me saying \"I've got this now.\" I was so surprised/annoyed/shocked that this man just shoved this guy aside that I blurted \"You leave him alone. He's doing just fine.\" And said I wanted the original agent to continue helping me. \n\nAbout twenty minutes later our party gets paged to go to the gate desk. I figure crap, my mom can't have the bulkhead afterall, someone's come with a baby who needs the seat, etc. \n\nNope. The agent with the spiral notebook wants to upgrade us all to first class. Is that ok? YES PLEASE!!! And thank you very very much. :)\n\nEdit: Thank you kind stranger for the gold. Wow. I'm still very new to Reddit so now will get to learn all about Reddit Gold. Yippee to learning something new. ",

Pretty standard combos, but then becuase we were both pretty fat back then I was like \"we should each get 4 of x\" and of course he was like \"yeah, ok\". It was as normal an idea to him as it was to me, I guess. So we wrap it up with 8 full on sandwiches and the woman had a tiny melt down. \n\nCompletely lost her cool \"8 OF THEM\" !??!??. I thought it was a hoot but my friend just could not stop laughing. We were both stoned and have infectious laughs though so I think by the minute and a half mark we were laughing more at each other's laughs than that lady's reaction. Eventually we started holding the line up though, so the woman asked \"is there an issue, sir\"? My friend just breathlessly said no then pulled forward. I probably can't convey it well enough through text but needless to say it's an ongoing inside joke tp this day. To be fair it was more food than we could eat though. (if only by a little)",

I'm not sure what it is about people lately, but for the past few months it's a nightmare every time I go there. Honestly, I am so sick of every damn person just standing in the way or stopping dead in the middle of an aisle or running into you while you're looking at something because they're watching their phone while walking.\n\nPeople act like they haven't seen someone in 30 years and just stop dead wherever they see said person and talk for 45 goddamn minutes, oblivious to the world. Uh, hello? You know your two carts, 4 kids, and your own asses are blocking the entire aisle from this end? Then they get huffy when someone tries to get to something they're standing in front of, as if they aren't the dumbass standing in the way.\n\nNeed to look up something? By all means, people, park your cart, and then stand BESIDE it, with enough distance that no one can get through between you and said cart, or you and the wall, while you stare at everything. No one else is trying to carry on down the aisle or anything!\n\nAnd yes, people, stop fucking dead to check your phone and list in the middle of an aisle while people are behind you heading in the same direction, because no, we're not shopping for ourselves and trying to get to the other end of the store, we're just tagging along with you! (What would the ideal solution? Pull off to the goddamn side so people can keep going because there's another line of people walking in the opposite direction).\n\nJust leave your cart anywhere you want while you wander off to find something, and feel free to get pissed because someone is standing near said cart trying to find something your cart is blocking when you get back.\n\nI apologize that where I'm going intercepts where you stuck your cart.\n\nBonus: leave cart next to one of those stupid space-consuming displays in the aisle so not a single person can squeeze through while you look at said display.

        "text": "Many years ago, I found myself in one of those trendy lunch places that plague mid-town Manhattan. One of those places that loves words like “artisanal” and “free range organic” and generally has a line of hipster ad agency types out the door looking to over pay for a quinoa salad or whatever.\n\nSo why was I there? \n\nI had a nasty cold, and this place was a half block away from my office, and, as much as I loathed their branding, I grudgingly had to admit they made a chicken matzoh-ball soup that was really REALLY good, and as a Jew, I happen to know that shit will cure cancer, much less a petty head cold.\n\nSo I grab myself a soup, and a bagel, wait on line for most of the 20th century, until finally I get to the register, where one poor beleaguered employee rings up my order, and another goes to put my lunch in a bag while a very severe manager type watched over them with arms crossed.\n\nNow I’m no eco-warrior, but I’ve never been a fan of excess waste, and the idea of using a bag to carry 2 things like 500 feet seems incredibly wasteful to me, as does the idea of one-use plastic utensils, so I waved him off with a very practiced “I don’t need a bag or a spoon”. (I keep a set of metal utensils in my office) Most places take this request as you would expect, with a “less work for me” approach, but this guy, mr. manager tag, wasn’t having it. \n\n“We have to give you a bag, sir.” He was clearly smarter than I, and mentally drained by dealing with inferiors such as myself.\n\nAs I said, I had a cold. That cold wanted a fight, so as I was handing the register clerk my credit card I replied “My office is on the next block. I’m not wasting a bag just to carry my lunch across the street.”\n\nExasperated with my stupidity and insolence, he replied “how are we supposed to hand this to you without a bag?” \nMind you, it’s still on the counter between us. It was fortunate that counter was there, I’m pretty sure this encounter would have come to blows otherwise. He was that angry. \n“Are you fucking kidding me?” I asked, pointedly glancing at the massive line of customers waiting for this shit to end so they could buy their lunch. He went to grab my food. I beat him to it, as I didn’t have two employees between me and the counter. I grabbed the bagel in one hand, with a look of discovery on my face, like never before in the history of the human race had someone gripped a bagel with a hand. In the interest of progress, I reached out, and grabbed my cup of soup in the other.\n\nNobody died.\n\nI looked back at the bagel, and decided that, fuck it, in for a penny, in for a pound. slowly, carefully, with trembling hands, as the first 3 notes of “also spracht zarathustra” crept slowly out of nowhere, I placed the bagel atop the soup lid.\n\nThe Earth did not crack in half. \n\n“da DAH! Bum bum Bum bum Bum...” went the orchestra ask I looked back at asshole manager guy. He scowled as I went to share my new discovery with humanity.\n\nand eat lunch.\n\ntl;dr: Manager of a restaurant wouldn’t let me take my lunch without a bag. I discovered that the sun would not explode if I did.",

        "text": "Hey guys! I recently had a baby. I was just browsing this community after seeing some of these posts suggested at the top of another sub I subscribe to, and it reminded me of something that happened a couple months ago while I was about seven months pregnant with my baby girl. \n\nMy friend (who was also pregnant) and I went to Hell-Mart in order to shop for a dinner party we were hosting for all of the ladies in our pregnancy group AND their spouses (this is the important part here). Amongst our other purchases for the night, we selected a big bottle of wine and case of beer for the spouses to enjoy. Why not? Someone might as well have some fun right? We didn’t think it would be a problem. \n\nWe get to the front of the store and stand in a long , long line as always in this perpetually understaffed chain department store. Our turn to check out came, and the cashier started scanning our selections. However when she got to the wine and beer, she froze up and started giving us dirty looks along with elevator eyes. Looking up at our eyes, down at our bellies, and up again. She truly looked disgusted. She picked up the alcohol and placed it behind her and said “I’m sorry, but it’s a new store policy to not sell alcohol to pregnant women”.  We explained that the libations were in fact intended solely for the enjoyment of our non fetus bearing counterparts, but she wasn’t having any of it. \n\nI was livid. First of all, I am a server at a bar/ grill and during my training was told that it is illegal and discriminatory to refuse the sale of alcohol to pregnant women, regardless of the fact that obviously no pregnant woman should be drinking much, if at all. And in that scenario, it IS obviously the pregnant woman who is drinking. In our scenario at the grocery store we were purchasing the alcohol for someone else, and the cashier should never have assumed it was for us. And even if it was, she had no place to deny us the sale. We are grown ass women capable of making our own choices, and I know for a FACT that this isn’t against store policy. She was just pushing her morals on us. At the time I let it go, I was too shocked. \n\nBUT, yesterday while doing my weekly grocery shopping, I saw the same cashier doing this AGAIN to  a pregnant lady who was there with her (I’m assuming) husband. The lady got very upset and walked out nearly in tears. At this point, I feel like someone needs to file a complaint with management. I asked a friend who’s sister works at the same chain, and she said there definitely is no such company policy. Do you guys think I should speak to a manager and lodge a complaint about this? Im usually not the kind of person to ask for a manager or complain, but I think this is seriously out of line.  \n\nUPDATE!!!!!: Alright guys , I had the time today to stop into that store and speak to a manager. When I asked for a manager at first, the lady working self checkout tried to get me to just speak to her instead to see “if she could help”, but I told her it’s an issue I would like to discuss only with either the store manager or the front end manager. The lady who came to speak to me identified herself as the manager in charge of the cashiers, and I actually had met her before at a volunteer gig I did last month oddly enough. I calmly and politely told her what happened. At this point she shook her head and asked me if I was serious. I said yes, and she said “well I assure you, at this point Denise (not real name) will no longer be employed here. You are the second person since her last shift this week to bring this issue to my attention”. I am assuming the lady who I saw getting denied sale the other day also complained. At this point I told her that my intention was not for her to lose her job, rather to be coached on why her behavior was inappropriate, so that she would not do this to another customer. Then, the manager told me that this employee had a long history of similar inappropriate transgressions. She did not name all of them, but she mentioned that the employee had already been written up for similar things such as lecturing people for buying alcohol on “the lords day”,  and making comments to people about condoms. I’m glad I mentioned it because the employee was obviously being judge mental and rude left and right, but part of me still feels a little bit guilty even though I know I shouldn’t. \n\nEdited to add: she did confirm that there was never such a policy at Hell mart.

        "text": "So I love this online clothing store that rhymes with Hands Bend, because I'm secretly a 40 year old woman in a 27 year old woman's body, and also because of their liberal return policy. They will literally let you return anything, anytime. I have heard stories about people returning things (very much used) 25 years later and getting a full refund! The downside to this is that your return options are a) send the return by mail and have $7 taken out of your refund for shipping costs, or b) return the items in person to any [specific department store].\n\nI hate making returns, talking to new people, going new places, etc (anxiety ftw!). So naturally, going to [department store] to make returns is a nightmare, and that's why I save up mountains of returns to do all at once. I would just mail everything, but I don't want to lose my $7, haha.\n\nThe last (and only) time I tried to do returns for this clothing store at [department store] was over a year ago. When I went in (with my year's worth of returns), they told me that I needed the original bags that the items came in so that they could process the returns. Like, the original clear plastic bags that I ripped off of the items when they arrived, like every normal person would, and threw away. Say what? I asked why, because this \"policy\" was not on the clothing store's website, and they said that it was a new policy and it was so that they could tell which item was which. Umm, isn't that what the packing slips (which I had) are for? I even asked for a manager, and got the same answer plus some attitude. \n\nWhen I left the store, sadly with my stuff still in my possession, I immediately emailed the clothing store's customer service. I would have just called, but I hate calling customer service and my daily quota for talking to people was spent. I got a quick email back from the clothing store stating that the website was correct (no original bags required), and they were going to send me a free shipping label to send all my stuff back to them (no loss of $7, yay!). \n\nSo in the end, I got what I wanted, but I'm afraid to go back to [department store] to try to do more returns. I have accumulated some stuff over the past year that needs to go away. Oh, and I saved all of the damn original bags, just in case ;)\n\nEdit: Sorry for the confusion, I'm not wearing the clothing for a year and then returning it. I don't think that would be ethical. I'm just so anxious about returning things that I held onto clothing that didn't fit (brand new, unworn except to try on once) for a year before getting the courage to go and return it.",

        "text": "My friend has a tablet/laptop hybrid. A very expensive one. He wanted to see if he could put a delayed warranty on it, so he called up the manufacturer to see if that was possible.\n\nThe supervisor he spoke to said that because it was past the 2 month period, that the durration of the warranty would retroactively include the unused time that passed since the due date. A very fair compromise, since he'd only had it for 3 months. In layman's terms, he'd be paying the full price of the warranty, but recieve a month less of time.\n\nThe manager instructed him to go to the nearest Macrohard™ store for an assessment, to ensure the tablet was in pristine condition. Que my friend pleading me to go with him so we can take the car pool lane on this two hour road trip. He bribed me with a 7/11 Slurpee and so I was forced to relent...\n\nAfter just barely making it to our appointment in -20°C weather (yes, I'm the idiot who likes to drink slurpees in the cold) we got to see a technician. One who looked like he enjoyed computers and fast food much more than human interaction. Not that I'm much different that way, but seriously; this guy had as much social tact and good hygiene habits as Gollum.\n\nWhen my friend explained what the manager on the phone said, the hideous, balding, man-goblin's face recoiled as if my friend asked him for an enema. \"That's outrageously against policy! You can't just ~~ask me to give you an enema~~ ask me to give you a warranty a month past the expiry date!\".\n\nNaturally, my friend was pretty disheartened. We'd been on the road for a long time. I want to make it clear that my friend was polite through the whole encounter, while the technician was not. Seriously, any other rational retail worker would say \"Man, that sucks... Let me just chat with my manager and see what we can do.\" But no. Visible recoil and offense at our request.\n\nLuckily a manager was nearby and took it upon himself to step in. It took seconds for the manager to understand the dispute, see that it's better to sell a $200 warranty to my friend than not, and agree to have the technician make the sale. \n\nThe moment the manager returned to his other duties, this slimey swamp creature threw up his arms and started venting, **to us** about how if he were in charge he wouldn't \"break policy\" and bend over backwards to customers. He said these things to us; his customers. I wonder why he's not manager... \n\nI get that it sucks when your manager doesn't have your back, and even worse when managers give into customer bitch fits about not getting their way, but this wasn't either of those things...  A verbal promise was made, and your customers drove two hours to throw money at you, and they treat you respectfully, maybe you shouldn't complain to them for them getting what they'd hoped for.\n\nIn hindsight, we probably should have pointed out to his manager how shitty his customer service skills are, but it was shoulder to shoulder crowded in there...\n\nLeft a very bad taste in my mouth.",

        "text": "I’m so baffled about an experience I had yesterday. I’m not sure if the person I spoke to was an actual child or just remarkably incompetent. \n\nI was cold calling service companies on behalf of my company. We’re expanding into a new market and needed to find the right service provider in our new area. (I’m being purposefully vague) Not to sound too pompous, but if any of these vendors were to land us a client, it would be huge. We would give them a ton of business and I feel like we are extremely easy to work with. Almost to fault. And my boss has a touch of the Lucille Bluth syndrome when it comes to money. (“How much is a single banana? Ten dollars?”) So if we decide to do business with you, we will basically throw money at you.\n\nI called the first company and had my little Spiel ready. I had a ton of questions so my plan was to introduce myself, briefly explain my situation, and ask for an email address where I could send a more detailed request for services/pricing to see they would be a good fit for us. I barely got my name out before this woman started interrupting me and berating me. I should have just hung up, but I was so shocked I kind of didn’t know what to do.\n\nShe seriously wouldn’t let me finish a sentence and started yelling at me. (“What is it that you even want?”) At one point while I was mid-word she put me on hold, presumably to bitch about me to a coworker. I actually had to employ a trick I use on my *five-year-old stepdaughter when she throws tantrums.* But this was presumably a grown woman who was AT WORK. I got very quiet and just basically let her rant herself out of steam and then said, “are you finished? Can I speak now?”\n\nEventually she randomly transferred me to someone in accounts payable who was extremely confused as to why I was transferred to her and not to a sales rep. You and me both, sister. \n\nI don’t normally call people out, but I was so taken aback by how hostile and rude the receptionist was that I said, “I’m just being honest, based on how I was just treated I am extremely wary of doing business with your company. That woman was shockingly rude and needlessly hostile.” She doesn’t apologize and just tells me I should have asked to speak to a sales rep. Lady. I did. Several times. \n\nAnyways I eventually got a slightly bitchy email from a sales rep who became less bitchy when I explained how much business we would be doing with them. This entire company seems to think they are doing us a favor by taking our money. So I very much look forward to sending them a proposal, letting them get excited at the prospect of landing us as a client and then telling them we’ve decided to go with their competitor who values service. (Seriously, the second company I contacted offered to fly to our city to give us a presentation.) \n\nUgh, people.\n\n\n",

        "text": "When I was 17, I was in my first semi-serious relationship and we decided to do the deed for the first time. I am an incredibly paranoid person, so it was agreed that we would use three BC methods: I’d be on the pill, we would use condoms, and he would pull out. Pretty foolproof and we never wavered from this method. This may not seem relevant but I promise it’ll come into play later. \n\nFast forward a few months and I’m two days late for my period. Not a big deal really and I have no reason to worry as we’ve been super careful, but as I mentioned, I’m pretty paranoid. So, I decided to head over to the local drugstore to pick up a pregnancy test just to be safe. \n\nWhen I got there, I was suuuuper nervous. I’m a shy person by nature, and this pharmacy was in an area where all my classmates and friends lived, so I just wanted to get in and get out ASAP. I made my way to the back of the drugstore because they had a pharmacy where people could pick up their prescriptions but also check out with a few items. I figured this was my best bet because the majority of people in the store were at the front. \n\nWhen I placed the pregnancy tests in front of the pharmacist, I could immediately sense his disapproval. He very obviously glared at me as he rang me up, and then paused. He then proceeded to give me a lecture that I feel scarred me for at least a few years. He said that there was absolutely no reason someone at my age should be purchasing such an item, that there were so many birth control methods out there that I should be using, and that I was incredibly irresponsible. He talked over me every time I tried to explain myself and say that I was being safe but I’m paranoid and I just wanted to make sure. It was, in short, horrible. \n\nYears later, I have a lot more self-confidence and wish I would’ve shut him down rather than letting him (basically) yell at me like that, but you live and you learn I guess. \n\nBy the way—I wasn’t pregnant.",

        "text": "I hope this fits here.\n\nMy husband and I needed some marriage counseling at the beginning of last year.  He found a therapist and we started seeing her.\n\nThe first two sessions were brutal.  We left feeling worse than when we walked in.  The third session was no different. It seemed that rather than helping us through our problems, this therapist was making them worse.\n\nWe decided to find a new therapist and after several sessions our marriage is the strongest it's ever been.  Happy ending, right?\n\nWell...today we received a call from our original therapist saying that our insurance had not paid her.  Mind you we saw this therapist 3 times a year ago.  She'd never sent us a bill so I thought everything was taken care of.\n\nIn fact, when we stopped seeing her and started seeing a different therapist, I realized the first one overcharged us 300% on our copay.  I was not willing to deal with her and just wrote off that money, which amounted to $90.00, that I overpaid her.  It just wasn't worth $90.00 for me to deal with her again.\n\nSo after she called, I started looking at the claim info from my insurer.  I find that she charged my insurance twice for each visit, once for me and once for my husband.  So not only had we overpaid her our copay, but it looked like our insurance had overpaid her.  I'm pretty sure therapists don't get to charge by the person for marriage counseling when we were seeing her together.\n\nSo I give my insurer a call and ask them.  At first the customer service rep didn't understand that this was marriage counseling and told me doctors often bill separately for different things they do during a visit.  When I reiterated that my husband and I had seen this therapist at the same time for the same 45 minute appointment, the customer service rep put me on hold so she could look at our claims.\n\nWhen she came back on the line, she assured me they would be looking into the charges.  She also asked my why this therapist had charged us different amounts for different visits.  I told her I had no idea.  Then she asked me how much copay I had paid.  I told her again and she asked if I could send her proof.  I told her I paid by check and would be glad to print copies for her.\n\nShe thanked me and said she'd be calling me soon with an update.\n\nWe pay a lot of money for our insurance.  I really can't tolerate someone overcharging because they can and then calling me a year later saying they haven't been paid when, in fact, they've been overpaid.\n\nApparently counseling isn't the only thing this therapist sucks at.",

        "text": "So today I went to the local corner store/gas station for some quick food since it's the closest location to my home and I didn't feel like going anywhere else with the road conditions being still crappy as the plows have not touched them yet. As I'm patiently waiting for my order, another customer comes in with his wife, and he makes a comment about the condition of the parking lot. It wasn't plowed at all, but then neither are the surrounding roads. \n\nI'm standing there thinking, maybe he's just playing around. Surely he knows the guy behind the counter making sandwiches isn't responsible or has any control over that fact. But then he goes on to say,\n\"You guys make so much money off X that you can't afford to get a plow out here?\"\nPersonally I don't think they make as much as he's implying but it was just super annoying. The guy behind the counter was just sort of agreeing with him in that way where you could tell he didn't really have an answer.\n\nAfter I walked out of the store, I saw the other customer's truck in the parking spot outside the door...with a decent size plow rigged to it. Now, I know he doesn't work for the state transportation department so it's technically not his responsibility to clear the roads or anything. But I just find it super ironic.",

So I call the service and Im only on hold for maybe a minute and this super nice girl picks up. I tell her my situation and she says, “I am so sorry for your situation, and even if I’m personally not able to help, I want you to know that I will make sure this resolved. Stuff like this doesn’t happen often here, but when it does we make sure to fix everything. ” and the whole time we were getting it sorted out she kept being amazingly positive. She also told me that she was able to block the account who used my card and then said a “horrible person like this has no business on this site”. \n\nI’m also a little under the weather today and when we were wrapping up she said that she hoped I started feeling better and that everything should be fine in a few days. \n\nIt would have been so easy for her to go through the motions of the call, but she took the time to be intentionally nice and remind me that even though this crappy thing happened, it’ll all be better soon. I know it was just another call for her but this broke college gal appreciated it. ",

        "text": "This will be my first story in here so there will probably be some faults in the format. \nIm doing a crosspost because I'm not sure if this fits for this subreddit. If not, tell me and I'll delete it instantly,  thank you for reading. \n\nI'm a couponhag which can't have enough of sales. Searching for coupons and checking the grocery stores beforehand is a must do for me. I wish there were other ways but I'm just a really broke person. \nI'm currently living at home with my mother on the hunt for cheap apartments but the area I live hasn't yet showed me a cheap available apartment I could call home nor has I found any jobs surrounding the city so far, so for now I'm trying my best to work whenever I get called in which rarely happens over Christmas times. \nUsually I teach art for disabled people and in this work field you have to compete with a lot of people to get called in as they not only focus on art but crafts and sewing/knitting. You could say there's at least two staff available for every field whereas I'm the only one who's able to manage the art field. Now that course is only available for a limited time and so my salary isn't the greatest, I do enjoy it though, I do overtime without getting paid and could call it therapeutic. Now recently I haven't had the chance to get called in and so I've been pretty much broke over Christmas. \n\nBeing broke can have different meanings for different people. I'm the kind of broke that haven't had more than a few cents on my bank account this December unless I manage to get a painting sold or an aunty or uncle to help me. It has been a tough situation and I've had to rely on going to church for food. My mother hasn't been able to save up much for Christmas either as she's on debt sanitation meaning she'll only get 40$ a week to buy food for. Which is why I'm the couponhag in this household. \n\nEvery Sunday night at 12 I will get on my local grocery stores website and see the updated sites new items with sales and other things we need. And I'll write it down on a shopping list. Fortunately for us, this year there has been a massive increase in empathy over the poor and both mother and I cried as the church and some facebook groups decided to send us some gift cards with money in it. The gift cards comes in a card where you swipe it in the specific store it is for. Unlike real money you can only use it in that place. I was so happy because last year we didn't have money to buy Christmas food or gifts to each other but this year we could! \n\nI spent hours finding sales and coupons to use for our Christmas shopping. I found deals after deals and had a huge list of things we could save money on to get as much Christmas food as possible. The day we were supposed to go shopping I woke early and spent time making myself look as pretty as possible. When the time came we headed to the store and I was a little surprised to see none of the sales on the list was in the store. I kept checking my phone and the website to confirm that the sales was in fact there. I decided to go ask a staff member and they said I could talk to the cashier in the store. She said it was a bit early and they could just not have had the time to put up all the sales yet. She also said to me that it's probably likely that the sales on the sites are the current price. So I picked out everything I had on the list nervous in case I would be wrong. I feel incredibly sorry for his cashier as I had so much to list up on the website and I stood for at least ten minutes by the checkout notifying her about the different coupons I had. She holding my phone looking at the different sales. I think I really stressed her out and I feel so guilty. It was Christmas times after all and a lot of people where impatient to get done with their shopping. \n\nA second line opened and most people moved over. I stood there embarrassed. You could put on the silly hat and I would blend in perfectly with it. Fortunately the cashier said I was right. I got everything done and as I was packing she called for me. She told me there might have been an error with the purchase and I instantly felt anxiety knowing I wouldn't be able to buy it all if he sales were wrong. So I stood for a few minutes awkwardly with my grocery bags in my hands waiting for the doom by the packing section. I finally got my turn as the queue perished and she told me and my mother that she forgot to add the meat coupon. Everything just stopped for me, i thought there was going to be something negative but she just told me I had more change to get. She wished me a merry Christmas as she told me she'd take the gift card and take out all the cash from it to hand it as real money. I got emotional again knowing that meant I once again could purchase what I wanted on he other grocery store in town that I had to remove from the list as I thought we couldn't afford it. \n\nSo in the end I managed to get everything I wanted from both of the stores. My Christmas was amazing. Food on the table, candies and sodas. The couponhag even managed to get herself a hair dye for 30% off as a Christmas gift. I feel guilty that I pushed so much stress on the cashier and then leaving the store to go for a second one when the gift card would only work on that store but since I had money by hand I figured that I'd better get the last item than leave it in my wallet.\n I felt like I had the best Christmas in a long time. My friends had also a gift for me. They had made food secretly for us so we could have Christmas dinner together. In the end it filled the entire kitchen table with so much food that I was constipated for days and I'm already sick of Christmas food. But it was worth it. It was the best Christmas! \nI wish I could thank all the people that gave me the Christmas gift cards but they weren't mentioned from the facebook group and I want to thank the amazing church for helping me out with food when times are tough. Hopefully I'll be able to help others like this once I get myself a proper and stable job.  \nAnd once again, whoever you are cashier woman, I'm so so sorry for stressing you out this year. ",

Then few small companies started coming that did half day/few hours etc.\n\nI needed to get van to transfer some couch home from someone. No biggie, hardly hour work at slowest. So I started to look around - I remember renting van from one company when I was moving so I called them (their website specifically asked to call for more info).\n\n*Me:* Hey, I was wondering if you guys do rentals for few hours instead of whole day?\n\n*CS:* No, we cant do that.\n\n*Me:* Shame, I guess I look around\n\n*CS:* Look, we cant possibly do just few hours rentals. We have to pay tax for rentals, tax for gas, insurance, we have to pay salary to accounting, ourselves, write receipts..\n\n*Me:* Uh, ok. I look elsewhere. Bye.\n\n\nNow, I didnt sound rude or anything. Just wanted to get out of the situation since the guy answering sounded young-ish so I assumed they are intern with minimum knowledge \"what customers cares about\" (aka not info about taxes they pay). \n\nThat was not enough tho. **The \"boss\" called me back 20 mins later**.\n\n*\"Boss\":* Are you the rude bloke who dared to call us and ask for few hours of rental?\n\n*Me:* Err, I guess so-..\n\n*\"Boss\":* Dont you know its impossible to rent just for few hours from us. We have to pay taxes for (he lists 100% same shit the guy before did).\n\nAfterwards I chuckled a bit and told them I already found company that rents for few hours and I wouldnt need their vans and hang up. God I felt redfaced after saying that but it was worth it.",

They later called back to verify the code but at that point we already had the code.\n\nThe second bathroom in our room had awful water pressure and water went everywhere on the floor which lacked a drain; the water was still there in the morning. There was also still short black hairs all over the walls. There's also no air vent/fan in the bathroom, which means you have to open the one small window which didn't have a fly screen which meant showering with a while range of bugs or spiders.\n\nThe beds were relatively comfortable but that's about where the good things about the room stops. \n\nThe kitchen has a sign up stating that dishes have to be washed when we leave and that we have to take out our own rubbish or there would be a $20 fine (each) if it wasn't done, not a big deal and expected at the price. However, the bin is tiny and we lacked washing gloves or detergent. We enquired about the next morning and were told that they would provide some when they cleaned the rooms. After returning from a day of adventuring not only had the room not been cleaned but we had no washing detergent. We went to ask the reception  (which had been opened as we drove in) but it was closed, despite the sign stating it closed it 10 minutes. How helpful...\n\nSome cleaning staff came to our room the next morning (after having to ask for detergent again) to give us the cheapest bottle of detergent they could find, however they asked us for the bottle back after we used it so we just had to empty some of it into a cup. It's been a fun time.\n\nTl;dr: our motel room is awful, bathroom is still dirty and has no proper drainage. $20 fee applies for not doing dishes before we leave but doesn't provide the tools to clean them. Staff generally unfriendly and unwilling to help guests.\n\n",

My SO decided he wanted to do a last minute hot dog bbq. So off we went to the supermarket in the nearest sizeable town for hot dogs and buns.\n\nThis area of the Catskills has many orthodox Jewish summer communities. The supermarket is mobbed with orthodox Jewish ladies and their many many children.\n\nWe find hot dogs but no hot dog buns. We look in bread. We look in seasonal. We look everywhere we can think buns might be. We don't find any buns. So we ask a man from the store if he can look to see if there are any buns in the magical back of the store. He says he'll go see and goes to look. \n\nWe're still shopping and he finds us and says no - he can't find any hot dog buns in the back. Several minutes later he finds us again and says he too couldn't find any in bread or seasonal. The third time he finds us and says he can't find buns anywhere in the store. There just aren't any left anywhere. We thank him profusely for looking so thoroughly.\n\nFinally we're on line to check out. I comment to my SO on a lady nearby with several children running around her, looking perplexed, searching through her cart, which has hot dogs in it, wondering what she's lost. \"Probably hot dog buns\" deadpans my SO. As he says this the guy from the store sidles over with a bag of buns clutched to his chest and furtively hands them to my SO. We thank him and ask where he found them. \n\n\"It's dem Jews. They've taken all the buns.\"\n\nUh... Thank you? \n\nWe check out. And as we're driving away we realise he'd taken the buns from the lady's cart to give to us. Holy crap.\n\n\nEdit: I think we ended up with Sabrett dogs",

        "text": "So happy new year everyone! \n\nMy sister and I decided to celebrate the new year by taking my son (5) and our nephews (8 and 11) to a hotel for the night where they could swim and have fun. The evening was great!\n\nThe place we stayed has an 11 to 7 quiet policy but we expected some late noise due to the New Year. But my lord!\n\nBetween 2-4 we had a group of drunk idiots yelling in front of our room. Tried using our room phone to call down and of course it’s not working. Used our cells and they said they’d send security. Ya that didn’t happen. Called again half hour later because they’re still going and now I have a 5 yo awake and scared. They were going on about using drugs and just being obnoxious. \n\nEven with security coming it continued on for another hour with people even trying to come into our room.  \n\nI didn’t want to cause a stink but I thought the hotel should know about the drug use so first thing I went down to talk to a manager. \n\nThat poor man. He has a list of noise complaints a page and a half long mostly from rooms surrounding and above ours (you know since they were of course right next door to us!) I was the first one to come down in person. \n\nI feel for the guy he wasn’t even on shift when it was happening. He just gets to clean up the mess. What a way to start the new year! \n\nTL;DR drunk and drugged idiots, front desk manager is in for a long morning. ",

        "text": "My boyfriend and I were eating at an all you can eat Sushi restaurant today for lunch while out shopping. Its the kind of place where you are given a tablet and make selections and order on your own. After the order goes through someone walks by and leaves the ticket with the complete order at our table.\n\nWithin minutes we receive the two items on our order that are made by the cooks at the sushi counter. Three pieces of salmon sashimi and three pieces of shrimp tempura. Off to a great start.\n\nThen the waiting began. Forty five minutes pass without receiving any other food. We see dish after dish leaving the kitchen, often being delivered to tables that had arrived well after we did. It became apparent to us however that the tables that all came around the same time as us weren't receiving their food either. One of the managers comes by and we let her know that we haven't received our food. As such she takes our order paper we were given at the start, with her to the counter.\n\n A few minutes later without having received any food or update, the table next to us gets the attention of a waiter and lets him know it's been 35 minutes since they've placed their order. I then exclaim as well that it's been 50 minutes for us. The waiter walks off apparently to rectify the situation. \n\nThe next moment the same manager as earlier comes over to us and the other table that complained, and tells us jointly that there is a problem with the kitchen printer and that we JUST HAVE TO BE PATIENT. \nAs such she had given our copy of the order to the kitchen staff. She exclaimed that our orders were now at the back of their list of orders to prepare. Despite our orders clearly being placed before all others. But hey, at least the kitchen staff was now aware of our order....right?\n\nAnother twenty minutes pass without us receiving any food and one of the guys at the table next to us decides to confront the manager who told us to be patient. He walks up to the counter shaking his head saying he's going to leave and not pay. She starts saying no no you can't do that and leads him back to his table. She pulls back his chair and tells him to sit down and JUST BE PATIENT. As his dining companion found this extremely amusing he decided to sit down and wait it out.\n\nThe decision to confront the manager about leaving without paying clearly had an effect, within minutes they were receiving dish after dish. They told us numerous times that they felt bad for us because we had been waiting longer than them yet still received nothing.\n\nWe wait and we wait.\n\nAfter waiting for an hour and forty five minutes total, the other manager comes by and asks for our tablet. He then prints out the order once more. We summise that after the managers gave our order to the kitchen, it was eventually thrown out. \n\nSo finally after all the tables around us had left and were taken by new customers (who had already received their food), we recieve our first dish. It was cold, a beef dish that usually goes from the grill to table in minutes, was stone cold. Over the next twenty minutes the rest of our order slowly trickles in, minus one dish which never came. \n\nWe place a second order for sushi, thinking it would come quickly, not having to deal with the kitchen, just the sushi counter. \n\nBoy was I wrong. We wait about 15 minutes and then a waitress comes by inquiring if we're still waiting for something. We let her know and she goes to the sushi counter to retrieve a plate that had been ready for atleast 10 minutes. Apparently all the waiters went on break and a long line of sushi orders were just waiting on the counter. We receive our plate and notice immediately that half our order was missing. \n\nAt our wits end and just wanting to get out of there we make no mention of it.\n\nAfter sitting with our plates stacked on top of one another, a clear sign of us being done with our meal, for five minutes, a waiter finally comes by and we ask for the bill. We are brought the bill fairly quickly and I get my card out ready to pay. \n\nAt the same time the manager and wait staff get out rags and begin clearing and wiping down all the tables in the restaurant. After another five minutes I finally have to ask one of the waiters if we can pay now and they take out the card machine from their apron. \n\nMy boyfriend and I had already decided we weren't going to give a tip. Normally we tip 18% when we go out, but this was ridiculous. \n\nI pay for the bill by card and select 0% as the tip. As the machine prints the receipt and the waitress sees the $0.00 tip she exclaims: You know the tip isn't included.\n\nUpset that they would think the service even deserved a tip, I blurt out: Well we've been here for three hours and waited two hours for our food. Ask your boss for the tip you didn't get.\n\nAt that point we walk out and vow to never return.\n\ntl;dr Went to an all you can eat sushi restaurant for a quick lunch while shopping, our order ends up lost and turns into a three hour ordeal. Repeatedly told to JUST BE PATIENT, and badgered for not leaving a tip. ",

        "text": "\nTLDR at end\n\nI was visiting California last year and checking out some highly-rated drinking establishments with my husband. We stopped in a well-known pub that was known for having British football televised.\n\nWe ordered drinks, settling in to watch the match. Unfortunately I got served an undrinkable skunky draft beer. I told the waitress that it might have gone bad and that I wanted something bottled instead because I was skeptical about their draft lines at this point.\n\nShe left with the beer in a huff, instead bringing me another glass of the same foul draft beer for reasons I cannot fathom, and the owner, who insisted I try it in front of him. We argued (mainly because I didn't want to drink the bad beer again). As he escalated in tone/aggressiveness, I told him I'd pay for the first beer since I ordered it but that I wasn't going to touch the glass he kept pushing in my face.\n\nHe started wagging his finger in my face and told me I'd have to pay for two beers since the waitress brought me a second glass of the undrinkable draft. I flat out refused, saying I didn't order a second glass, never touched the unwanted glass, and had ordered an entirely different brand in a bottle instead, which I never got. \n\nHe started yelling that I was the only person to ever have a problem with his beer, drawing attention to us from all over the bar. Sick of the harassment, my husband and I started counting out enough money for our two beers and went to leave. The nutcase owner blocked the doorway and threatened to call the police for nonpayment for the second skunked beer, which led to another argument. I probably should have just called them myself at that point, but I was on vacation damnit, and I wanted to salvage the evening without wasting an hour explaining the situation to the police. So I told him that I'd pay for the second skunked beer he insisted was fine if he drank the whole thing in front of me.\n\nHe smirked and agreed, picked up the beer with the flourish and put the glass to his lips. As the flavor hit his throat, his entire face immediately tensed and he paused. I thought for a second he'd be a decent human and admit it was bad. \nBut I underestimated just how much this petty ass manager wanted to prove me wrong. \n\nNow if you've ever tasted bad beer, you know what the immediate compulsion to spit it out looks and feels like. He had chosen this hill to die on, so he struggled to calm his face and powered on. It was like watching a train wreck- horrible, but I couldn't look away! I watched him scowl and drink most of the glass with growing schadenfreude. The manager set the glass down and mumbled something about how good it was, not making eye contact. I dutifully counted out another $6, not bothering to tip the complicit waitress for her crap service and managed to walk out with my husband before we both burst out laughing. \n\nIt's become one of our favorite crazy stories to tell at drinking gatherings.\n\n\nTL;DR - manager takes offense and tries to make me pay for a second unordered skunky beer after sending the first skunked beer back, I offer to pay if he drinks it in front of me. He suffers through it, we leave and laugh because it was worth the $6 to make him drink crow.",

Here’s the dialogue between me and the cashier,  he was probably around 18 and I’m 22. \n\nMe: “hello! How are you?” \nCashier: “I’m good.

Are you excited for Christmas?” \nCashier: “my Birthday is on Christmas” \nMe: “I’ve always wondered how people feel about having their birthday on Christmas.

At the pharmacy I go to, there’s normally one tech at the register, a couple pharmacists actually dispensing meds, and a kind of floater who I believe is certified to dispense meds, but goes where needed (including the drive through right behind the 2 registers). \n\nAnyway, when I walked up, a woman was standing the socially acceptable distance from the pickup area, where another woman ( I guess she was obese? But she really just looked like she maybe had a couple kids 30 yrs ago and her body just fell where it may). This woman is asking about pricing and possible drug interactions - her questions were a bit tedious, but whatever. No biggie. \n\nThe woman in front of me keeps AUDIBLY sighing at this poor woman. Also making that weird click noise with the side of her mouth. That’s when I noticed. \n\nThe woman at the desk was clearly wearing diapers under her sweatpants. Not just that, but she had a few squares of toilet paper hanging out the back of the diapers.  She was so nice and the pharmacist explaining her drugs was incredibly patient. \n\nFinally (3 mins later) the floater came up and started signing into the other register. The woman in front of me was so worried about making the older woman feel uncomfortable, she didn’t notice the other clerk. I I told her (in not a very nice way) that she could stop her unnecessary impatience and go up to the other counter.  She turns around, puts her finger about 1.6 inched from my face and says, “she never waived me over. So I clearly have to wait!!”  The amazing floater pharmacist called over, “actually, I did. A couple times. But you were looking at the other register”. What a great burn without ever having a chance of getting in trouble. The woman huffed and went the second register. Not 4 seconds later, the other woman left. \n\nPS - I wanted to pull a gwenyth Paltrow in Bounce and subtly grab the toilet paper to save embarrassment.

And overall forgive wasting time with trivial story when there's so many more important things going on in the world.\n\nYesterday while checking out at my friendly supermarket the lovely cashier said I had 312 rewards points. Genuinely curious I asked her what they were good for. She said food, hams, gas, I should look on the web. \n\nI got home and looked at my receipt. It said my points would expire Dec 30. Ok. So I looked on their website and had two choices on which to click to use rewards, \"holidays\" or \"gas.\" My receipt said that the gas rewards start in 2018. So I clicked on \"holidays\" which outlined what I could get with rewards points starting in Nov. but didn't list specific promotion dates. Whoopee! A free ham! \n\nSo.... I went to my friendly supermarket today and the lovely meat  department lady helped me pick out a ham that worked with the promotion. And  when I checked out I got charged for it. BOOO! Why? Because the holiday promo ended Dec 27. Oh. Then I don't want the ham. Cashier said go to customer service to return it.\n\nSo I went to customer service. And the very nice lady there asked why I was returning the item. I said because I was charged for it when I thought it would use my rewards points. I told her the cashier said the holiday promo ran out on Dec 27 but I didn't see that online or on my previous receipt. And besides there's still Russian Christmas coming up so how are the holidays over? So she asked if I'd like a manager. Um, ok, sure. At this point I just wanted to say the website wasn't clear. \n\nNice manager comes. He says the website has the dates, I say no it didn't specify dates, I can show you on my phone, besides \"Dec 23 isn't the only Christmas out there\" (yeah, I got that wrong. But I don't celebrate Christmas in Dec) and the manager says \"We'll take it off your bill.\" Wow. Thank you nice manager man. \n\nAnd thank you nice customer service lady for asking if I wanted a manager. Because it didn't occur to me. And thank you nice meat department lady for helping me sort out the hams. And thank you both cashiers for being courteous and helpful. \n\nYou might not think a free ham is a big deal, but I'm giving it to a friend with several children who struggles to make ends meet and everything helps his family.\n\ntl;dr holy crap didn't mean to write a novella.

She brings a higher-up over and he directs us to a ticket booth, telling us we simply didn’t have our seat tickets, only our admittance tickets, and to ask the booth for them.\n\nWe take it up with a kind lady at the ticket booth, whereupon she tells us we have VIP tickets. The VIP tickets allow us to meet the magician before the show starts. We didn’t.  Not only did we have meet and greet tickets, but we ONLY had meet and greet tickets. Our mom had bought only the VIP meet and greet tickets without any tickets to admit us into the show. At this point, the lady assisting us shows concern at our situation, and asks us “Did you kids get to meet him at least?” When we replied we had not, she took our tickets back away from the service window, leaving us to wonder what would happen.\n\nAt this point, my sister and I assume, best case scenario, she is going to get our money back for the VIP tickets since they were never used in their actual context. Worst case, she cant make anything happen, but she appears to be trying to help us.\n\nShe comes back with a new set of tickets admitting us to the show! My sister and i thank her repeatedly before leaving for the theatre. Im sitting in the theatre prior to the show writing this.\n\nI just felt reassured in humanity, enough so to share here.

The second assistant(CGG for cute glasses guy) though, is brand new.\n\nCGG was extremely cute, a bit ditsy/socially awkward, and very sweet. Well, he offered to help me pick out a pair of glasses, and of course I took advantage of that since the rest of my family was trying glasses on for themselves. We definitely were hitting it off, and he was the one who found the pair of glasses I ended up falling in love with (so obviously he has good taste in my eyes). There was some light flirting, but nothing hardcore. Like I said, I go to school across the country and I'm not really looking for a long distance relationship.\n\nAfter I picked my glasses I got called in for my actual exam. When I got out, I could tell I missed something. CGG was blushing and sent the other assistant to finish dealing with me while I constantly caught him looking at me.\n\nWell, after we leave I ask my family if any of them know why he was acting so weird. Turns out, after I went in, my mom approached CGG, told him I thought he was really cute,  and gave him my number. Definitely not expecting a call or text, and honestly dreading going back there to pick up my new glasses. \n\nTLDR: I hit it off with a cute worker, and my mom decided to embarrass us both by giving him my number.\n",

        "text": "Sometime last year my father and I became acquainted with an individual so unrealistic and fantastical that we both wonder if he was the product of some strange shared psychosis instead of an actual, real person. My father dubbed the man \"the gas station sage\" and it is more than accurate.\n\nOne fateful day my father and I went in to the foodmart at our local gas station to get some candy and slurpees, because we are adults. We noted an old, busted up jaguar in the employee parking as we walked in, failing to recognize it as a vehicle of one of its regular attendants. Once inside, I quickly forgot about the jaguar, as my mind was more focused on sugary goodness than new faces.\n\nWhen we went up to pay, the man behind the counter was completely unremarkable, at least on the surface. He was of average height, probably in his 50s and I can remember nothing else of his appearance.  \n\nStill remembering the car, my father asked the gas station sage if he was the manager. What transpired next neither of us will forget. \n\nThe man smirked and grabbed a vase of roses (strange thing to have at a gas station, isn't it?) and said, \"You could say that. See, [gas station company] is like these roses. There's about a dozen of 'em, but they got thorns. This one here is one of the thorns.\" \n\nMy dad chuckled and we shared a befuddled look. We paid for our goodies and the man wished us a good day. \n\n\"We'll try,\" said my father.\n\nThe gas station sage was not appeased with this remark.\n\n\"Don't try and have a good day; have a good day,\" mused the sage, \"I never try to have a good day; I just have them. Everyday's been a good one since I started doing that. So stop it with your tryin' and start just havin' em. You'd be surprised how many find you.\"\n\nMy father has never been one for social interaction in any means, and was clearly flustered by the gas station sage's... interesting predilections.    \n\nHe gave an awkward chuckle and said, \"Okay. Fair enough. We'll have a good day, then.\"\n\nNever again did either of us see a busted up jaguar or its owner at the gas station again. My father has tried to ask about him to the regular attendants, and none of them seem to have any idea who he is talking about. Perhaps he was one of the company's higher-ups that went by himself to fill-in for one of his employees. Or perhaps he was merely an attendant at another one of the franchise's stations, and was similarly instructed to head to the one we went to go cover somebody's shift. \n\nNevertheless, his strangely apt rose similes and his yodaesque philosophy on life will never leave me or my father until the day we die.

        "text": "**Background info**: I'm visiting my mom over winter break and my grandmother is in town from Mexico City, so we went to a somewhat nice restaurant for dinner tonight.\n\nAs we were being led to our table, I made small talk with the host; he seemed friendly, maybe a couple years older than me, and we chatted about the weather and where we're from.\n\n**The Scandal**: As we were leaving the restaurant, we stopped outside to pet a cute dog and the host came jogging over to us and said:\n\n&gt;\"Did y'all leave something at the table? Someone said you left something at the table, please come with me.\" (Motioning toward me)\n\nOnce we were inside the restaurant, the host turned to me and goes,\n\n&gt;\"There wasn't anything left at your table. I realize that this is really weird and super uncomfortable and probably a fireable offense, but I just wanted to say that I think you're the prettiest girl in, like, the history of girls. I'm sure you're probably married or have someone who could beat me up, but I just wanted to say that--\"\n\nAt this point, my mom came hustling over to see what the problem was: there are large windows at the restaurant's entrance, so she could see that we never walked back to the table and that I was standing there looking like [this](https://assets-auto.rbl.ms/28335551ae62a53a139006b086316b2cb2142068e600f9bbed16806325b6aac4) while chuckling robotically as the host kept talking faster and faster. My mom bursts in and starts repeating loudly, \n\n&gt; \"What's going on? What's going on? What's going on?\"\n\nBy now there's a mild commotion going on as my mom is squawking like a parrot, I can't stop chuckling like \"ahuhuhuh. huhuh. ahuhu.\", and when I look over to the host stand, four or five other hosts and waiters are staring at their coworker and [cringing](https://assets-auto.rbl.ms/69f9755689a5452bb8127ec6e3c0204035cc66650287c2696f0557bee701a20b). \n\nFinally, I give the host a lame \"Thank you very much\" and walked away with my mom after promising to tell her what was going on. \n\nI felt kind of bad, the host was probably pretty embarrassed and he didn't get a chance to at least ask me for my number. On the other hand, I thought his behavior was pretty unprofessional and my grandma had to wait outside in the cold while he made his move.\n\nWeird night. But it did good things for my self esteem!

Now the poor thing is beyond confused because basic math skills are not required when you can type the amount into the cash register.  Counting back isn't an option because this is also no longer required. I tell my husband to put his .45 away and ask the cashier to just give us our change shown on the receipt. The cashier took his .45 and had already dropped it into the register...no begins the cash back, I can't count or do math good mess. \n\nThe cashier is so confused and does not know which way is up at this point and gives us our  $6.55 back , now her drawer is over by .45. The husband tries to explain to her that he gave her the .45 to make our change back an even $7.00. She pulls out $7.00, to hand to us. I looked at her like she was crazy and now she is visibly getting upset. So the husband explains it again and asks her to put the $7.00 back into her drawer and give him his .45. She states she needs to call a manager over as she wants to be sure she is doing it correctly. At this point I had enough.  I ask for my $20 back and the .45 so I can show her what the heck my husband is talking about. She complies, I assure her that I am going to teach her something as I am a cahsier as well. I give the .45 to the husband and told him keep your change, they don't teach counting back anymore and the reliability is on the machine not the employee. I set my $6.55 down and ask the cashier for her hand. I immediately show her by counting back the change she gave me from the $20 I gave her explaining it as I go using my $20.00 as reference. She freaks out like I just did magic, I said no its called counting back and it keeps you from getting cheated or counting wrong. I also explained how it would have worked with the .45 my husband has given her. She know understood and  this is a skill she needs. I also told her to keep her money from the customer on the top of the drawer until the end of the transaction so she will not have someone cheating her by stating I gave you a $50 instead of a $20. \n\nFast forward to a few weeks later, we see same cashier and she has to show me her new counting back skills (she had someone teach her) and my husband kept his change in his pocket. I can't get him to understand that getting rid of change like that makes it hard because of how cashiers are trained now...",

Got a text notifying me the order would be delivered by 12:30. Ok cool. \n\nSo 12:30 rolls around and no one is here. About 5 minutes goes by still no one. That's fine my house if kind of hard to to find. Then I get a notification that my order is completed. That's strange no one had come yet. I was sitting in the front of the house so I had a clear view of the driveway. I looked out both doors just to make sure they didn't drop the food and leave (which they're not supposed to do). I wait some more thinking it may be a mistake. Still no food. \n\nSo at 1:00 I called the delivery service help line. I explained that I'd gotten the completion notification but no one had come to deliver my groceries. The CS person verified my address and time to verify I wasn't calling before the drop off time. She said she would check with the shopper to see where the food was delivered. So I wait a few minutes. CS person comes back on the line to tell me the shopper is not answering calls or texts. She apologizes for the inconvenience and reorders my items. She also give me a $5 dollar credit toward a future order. I thank her and hang up.\n\nAfter thinking a moment. I was like \" I think that original shopper took my food\" if the shopper had simply delivered to the wrong address she would've answered the CS call and told her so. Because the people at a different house would've told the shopper they didn't order the food. Or if the wrong house simply took my food the shopper would've told the CS that too. \n\nAnyway I ended up waiting an extra hour this time the new shopper did show up and I got my soup.",

Eventually it’s just me and this woman old enough to have children. She was trying to get WIC with quite a few... checks(?). To me this is not a big deal and it’s the only store close enough to get supplies with WIC. The cashier messed up the first checkand charged the wrong items to it. The mother glances over at me “I’m sorry.” Surprised I said “You gotta feed your kids.” Well eventually the cashier messes the checks up to the point of no return. The poor mother was trying so hard to tell her which went with what (she even had the items organized); she just looked so embarrassed. Not wanting to make a thing about it I stood quietly on my phone. The cashier loudly shouts in my direction “This is going to take awhile, you should switch lines.” The mother looked like she wanted to die. So I said “I’m actually ok here.” I just wanted this to be solved quietly and peacefully so she could get her items and not feel so horrible leaving. Suddenly this other employee of the store comes up behind me and is like “This is going to take awhile, you need to move.” I stammered “I-I I’m f-“ He grabs my items and moves them to the next isle. Later when I called a manager about what had happened he was apologizing about how the employee took my stuff without permission. While that was annoying I wanted them to change how they treated this mother trying to simply feed her kids. I assume his “We’ll bring it up with the staff during that shift” isn’t going to go anywhere. ",

        "text": "So, today two days before Christmas I'm really not feeling going out. Well a local retailer was advertising something the kids wanted at one heck of a deal online. I call the store wait very patiently for 26 minutes of hold time. I ask if their site was correct and they if they had the item in stock and for the price listed, I was then asked for the items SKU and specific platform. I relayed the information directly from their site over the phone. \"Yes ma'am we have several in stock. Would you like me to pull any for you?\" Of course I say sure that would be great. I verified what I was picking up and left my name telling them I'd be there within the hour. I then make the 25 minute drive to said store wait in line for 10-15 minutes at the service desk, only to be handed the wrong item. Ok no biggie they just pulled the wrong item. I ask where it's located in store she points and I head in that direction. Well the item I specifically called about is no where to be found. Sales associate on floor (asst mgr I soon find out) is talking on her cell intentionally turning away from me as I wave at her. She finally hangs up (she was telling someone she got off at 7 I wasn't interrupting anything of importance) asks what I need. I try to tell her they didn't have what I was told they had she then tells me \"No we only have for this platform\". So by this point I'm furious and go to find a manager, and happen to spot one and ask for one that's over the retail side and lo and behold who shows up....the same rude lady (RL) I had just encountered. \nRL---Didn't I just tell you we did not have this item\nME---Yes you did. That's why I'm looking for a manager.\nRL---Well I'm the assistant\nME---Well I need someone to take care of this. I called spent close to half an hour on the phone on hold to verify you had what I'm looking for. I was specifically told after I gave all info that you had it in stock. I....\nRL---(cuts me off) Well we don't have it in stock Merry Christmas (and she walks off)\n\nThat to me is the rudest most disrespectful thing anyone has ever done. Yes I was mad they didn't have my item and that I was lied to but if you hold a management position at least have common decency. Just ugh",

        "text": "I recently remembered this story from about a month ago. I was on a brunch date with a person, as you do, and we went to this little locally owned place I had been to once or twice before. I recommended it, and boy I didn't regret it. \n\nWe were/are in our early 20s, and likely the youngest people in the place (Florida). We get seated, sort of. We look over the menus and wait about 10 minutes before someone comes to take our drink orders. Before we get the chance to let him know were ready to order food, he spouts this line out:\n\nWaiter: \"hey, you guys like cheese?\"\n\nSomehow this catches me off guard, and I forget my date is lactose intolerant (turned out fine, he eats cheese anyway) and I reply \"I mean, yeah, who doesn't like cheese?\"\n\nWaiter: \"cool. I've got this thing for you to try, on the house. I'll be back\"\n\nI'm not even mad he didn't take our food order at this point, I'm really amused. Not like we were in a hurry. So about 15 minutes go by and he brings out this cast iron skillet and a lighter. Here's where it gets good. He lands at our table and shouts \"OPA\" and sets the skillet on fire. This isn't a Greek place, but what the heck, why not? My date and I hold back our laughter, the whole thing just seems so outlandish. The entire restaurant is staring at us and this flaming cheese. The waiter disappears. We have no silverware. \n\nWe dig into the cheese with the pita bread the best we can, and man it's some strong cheese. I'm not into it, but I feel bad because the waiter did so much so I just eat some anyway. We flag him down and ask for silverware, he brings some, but before he goes he rests his hand on my date's shoulder. And he's gone again\n\nDate: \"....he just, like, gently caressed my shoulder blade\" \n\nAnyway, eventually we get our order taken and eat, food is fine. He asks how the cheese was, we tell him it was good. The rest is uneventful, but we will always remember him as The Cheese Guy",

I get to the checkout and wait in the shortest looking line, the line gets longer as I wait.  \n\nFinally it's my turn.  Before even starting to ring up my stuff, the cashier remarks \"these are weird christmas gifts\".  \n\nI respond \"well it's not christmas gifts, it's just stuff I needed\".  \n\nCashier \"oh, well it's weird to see someone buying stuff like this so close to christmas\".   \n\nI'm just standing there like,  \"do you see the line behind me, can we move on?\"\n\nFinally after staring at me for what felt like an eternity, she starts ringing my stuff, I pay and leave.   \n\nYes I realize it's close to christmas, but people still need to buy other things too.

        "text": "I got inspired to post this after commenting on an r/talesfromyourserver thread. Now, I have worked extensively in customer service, so I would NEVER make life harder for my server if I didn't have to. I don't eat red meat, though, so the only other times I've sent food back is if I ask for it without bacon etc. and there's a miscommunication where it gets put on anyway. In this case, my servers have always been very understanding and apologetic, and I appreciate it. But I digress...\n\nThere's this little breakfast place in my town that used to be one of the best, bar none. But then they changed ownership a bunch and it's become kind of a shitshow. Anyway, they had a huevos rancheros dish that was just to die for. Corn tortillas, over easy eggs, ranchero sauce, you know the drill. Super straightforward &amp; simple, but absolutely delicious. \n\nSo one time a few years ago I went to this restaurant with a friend of mine who also adores the place, probably after one of the first ownership changes (though the menu was the same). We had a waitress I've never seen before, which was unusual since I'm there quite a bit and I'm friendly with most of them. She was a middle aged woman, a little harried despite the lack of many other people eating there, but hey, idk what else is going on with her. No big deal. \n\nTo start, we both ordered mochas with whipped cream. The whipped cream was forgotten. Not a big problem, I thanked her and didn't mention it. When she asked what we were having to eat, I ordered the huevos rancheros, as I do every time. Approximately 20 minutes later, what she brought me out looked like a plate of scrambled eggs with salsa and cheese. The waitress set it down and obviously I was confused, and while she put down my friend's food very politely told her I thought she had brought me someone else's dish. She said, \"no, that's huevos rancheros.\" I looked back down and tentatively pointed out, \"but these are scrambled eggs. Huevos rancheros is made with fried eggs.\" \n\n\"No, it ISN'T,\" she insisted, becoming visibly angry. \"That's how it's always been made. If you wanted fried eggs, you should have said so.\" Which was news to me. But, clearly not going to win her over with logic and wanting to avoid more rage, I said, \"Ok, well I'm very sorry for not clarifying. But can I please have this re-made with over easy eggs? I've never encountered this issue before, but I won't eat the dish this way.\" She took it and stormed off. My friend and I stared after her and then looked at each other like deers in headlights. \n\nObviously also one of the few times I tipped less than 20%, but, I got more or less what I wanted eventually and all was well (if disconcerting). I still tried to go back to the restaurant a few times, but the food quality started to match the service quality, and I eventually had to give up. \n\nNow, I ALWAYS ADD \"huevos racheros EGGS OVER EASY\" wherever I am ordering this dish, and the wait staff all look at me like I'm a little crazy because duh, that's just how huevos rancheros is made. But I can't shake the nightmare of my favorite dish being lowkey turned into a greasy omelet in front of me and then being told I was in the wrong. ",

        "text": "Rather than from the point of the employee this time this is more of a customer side, anyways, my mother is of the batshit crazy everything has to be my way type. Not only that but she has a penchant for bullshitting and I knew right from the start that she was doing what she did to get things her way.\n\nSo basically I've been trying to get a PC capable of playing more recent games as of late, and I had ordered a pre built one (with specifically chosen parts by me the customer) and my mother clearly didn't like it when I told her I wanted it to be at where I live (with my grandparents, my guardians) and so she kept trying to get their policy from me so she could get me to return it so she could make me build one (and probably keep it at her place so she can use it, which won't happen, ever.) Either way the details about my whole living arrangement are dumb and my mother is a lying bitch.\n\nSo my mom sends a very very rude email to the company I had ordered from and demands a refund, and suddenly now I'm roped in with my mom who is the exact opposite of a good customer. She has a lot of anxiety but she uses it as an excuse so she used that to her advantage here too.\n\nAnyways after she had sent the email she told me that the company only sold \"used parts\" which was absolute bullcrap because they have top of the line product's. So my mom brought me along their and she got them to refund it. Everyone in there looked like they were having a mental breakdown when they saw my mom so I can only imagine what hell she put them through. They got even more pale when she mentioned the refund.\n\nEventually we got to the refunding process where their machines apparently have a cap when it comes to refunding. It was 500 dollars specifically on one machine and 150 on the other. My purchase was exactly 777 dollars (some insane luck mayhaps?)\n\nEither way my mother scared an entire store's worth of people while wearing an arm cast. She also probably gave me a bad reputation there too. I'm afraid to go back there now.\n\nI'm reposting this from r/talesfromretail",

        "text": "I'm not sure if this is world wide but where I used to live and where I live now (both in Europe) pharmacy workers seem to take forever doing anything. I just left after getting my prescription and it took almost 20 min with three workers and four customers in the store. When the guy had finally gotten my stuff, THEN he tells me I need to fix so my prescription is from the adjoining health care center.(I thought it worked the same as where I used to live where I could just pick up my prescription at any pharmacy) Why didn't he just tell me up front and I could sort it out and come back? It wasn't an emergency or anything. Now they made an exception and did give me my prescription so that's nice and I'm thankful for that, but the whole ordeal made me miss my bus and I might be late for work. I went extra early just so that wouldn't happen..\nSo here is my question. What are pharmacy workers doing that takes so long? I'm really curious. ",
