Wouldn't then giving birth with a 1:1 sex ratio result in a bunch of 'excluded' males, meaning that the sex ratio would inevitably adapt towards 1:5?

I have a BA and I'm working on an MA in the sciences because I feel, as a member of an extremely low status minority that routinely experiences extremely high rates of unemployment, that it's not wise to enter any field which is not flush with job openings. Many people don't consider us fully human as of yet, so, it's necessary to play it extremely safe in choosing a field. **I do not want to debate whether or not there are jobs in Anthropology, because I consider this field (and many others) closed to people with my circumstances simply because of the climate of our wider culture. Thank you for understanding this is not the point of my post!** Perhaps in five or ten years I could take another course or two while working, if I decide not to raise a family, to build savings, or to pursue the 5,000 hour certification to specialize within my field.\n\nWhat I would like to know, is, **how anthropology can be done without a college degree.** I may never become a professional anthropologist, but I know enough history to realize that the university system was not always the sole way to begin a career...and so, it seems to follow, that it has been possible to gain the depth of education necessary to contribute to a field by less formal means. Is it possible to do anthropology without money or credit, without a degree in anthropology? Is anthropology only for the rich and those with high socioeconomic status? Is it possible to learn the methodology from other sources? I understand I may never be respected by those with degrees, but this is a passion of mine that won't be smothered by economic pressure. How would I go about finding appropriate resources without getting off track? Consider me more than a hobbyist and less than a career anthropologist.\n\nAside from attempting to steal my university's anthropology syllabi, what do you suggest?",

I've heard one evolutionary theory state that monkeys used to sleep in trees. Our ancestors needed to evolve this trait so that they could readjust their sleeping positions and prevent themselves from falling to their deaths.\n\nThis makes no sense to me, because how would such a trait arise in the first place? And after it comes about, wouldn't it have drawbacks such as loss of sleep and causing the person to fall from the tree anyway? Furthermore, if the person had fallen asleep in a good, comfortable position in the first place, then wouldn't a sudden jolt awake only disrupt that and increase the chances of falling off the tree?",

I want it to be based on factual representation as much as possible. What are things I should take into consideration when working on this novel?\n\nPremise:\n\nA female protagonist who wants to become part of a group known as the Wolf Hunters. The problem is, women are not allowed to hunt. It is part of the tribe's tradition to forbid women and children from leaving the village and being exposed to the dangers of the wild. Only a group of the Wolf Hunters are allowed to leave the village and pursue prey.\n\nThey're an agricultural society. Both men and women work on the fields. They do have a hunter-gatherer component, but they're not primarily that. The hunters are pretty much an all-man group. Second, the women-not-leaving-the-village is a tribe thing, not a society thing. They're an extended family led by their patriarch - so the reason might be personal (and the tribe also might be worse-off than the others in the area). Other tribes let women leave the village.\nThey're European, and that's as far as I've narrowed it down.\n\nThanks.\n\nThis has also been shared in to other subreddits.

Jihad is an egalitarian, equal-opportunity employer: ...fraternal, fast-breaking, thrilling, glorious, and cool.\n\nRobert Pape quoted from Dying to Win,\n\n&gt;\"The data show that there is little connection between suicide terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism, or any one of the world's religions. ... Rather, what nearly all suicide terrorist attacks have in common is a specific secular and strategic goal: to compel modern democracies to withdraw military forces from territory that the terrorists consider to be their homeland\"\n\nPape is less relevant because suicide terrorism is only one aspect of radicalism, so it's a bit of a stretch to say that religion cannot play a major, if not essential, role in forming radical fundamentalist views and eventually terrorism. However his views are still important when discussing radicalism and terrorism, so I felt it was important to include his opinion. In this case Atran's views are more relevant. And I think they are more relevant simply because Atran spent years doing fieldwork with mujahedins and their families. For a while now he's been saying that religion has little or nothing to do with terrorism. So I am interested to know if there's research that is not entirely based on conjecture or theoretical musings, but rather on actual data and interpretations based on fieldwork or questionnaires, which might contradict or oppose the views held by Atran and Pape\n\nThis thread is NOT for a political discussion about Islam, it's about presenting research from both points of view without tainting it with personal opinions about the subject matter. So please don't post any comments that are in the vain of \"muslims are evil\" or \"muslims are good\",",

Despite official claims to lands and peoples won in a completed conquest, as well as history books that present a tidy picture of colonial controlled territory, the struggle for the Americas extended to every corner of the New World and unfolded over the course of centuries. Here we hope to explore the post contact Americas by examining acts of resistance, both large and small, that depict a complex, evolving landscape for all inhabitants of this New World. We'll investigate how open warfare and nonviolent opposition percolated throughout North and South America in the centuries following contact. We'll examine how Native American nations used colonists for their own purposes, to settle scores with traditional enemies, or negotiate their position in an emerging global economy. We'll examine how formal diplomacy, newly formed confederacies, and armed conflicts rolled back the frontier, shook the foundations of empires, and influenced the transformation of colonies into new nations. From the prolonged conquest of Mexico to the end of the Yaqui Wars in 1929, from everyday acts of nonviolent resistance in Catholic missions to the Battle of Little Bighorn we invite you to ask us anything.",
