I mean yes queue the second life jokes and w/e but I was really interested in running 2D apps in large screen spaces. \n\nI currently work with two 1080p monitors. I was thinking of going to the Samsung HMD since that's roughly the same number of pixels (not that I've calc'd it or anything) to my current setup. But the cool thing is from what I can tell you can scale things dynamically, to like 300\" AFAIK from the presentation. I realize the PPI decreases but the extra vertical res doesn't seem bad to me. \n\nI mostly do web dev, basic data science and some electronics stuff. \n\nFor the most part I could use web variants of everything to run my programs. Like using the SageMath VM either through CoCalc or a local VM instance. That covers python, jupyter and any math calcs I wanna do. \n\nIf I did small scale HDL work I could get away with using edaplayground though that is no where near my ideal way of workiing, or iverilog.com. \n\nI was under the assumption that you can use any ol 2D app like Sublime text or R Studio in MR space, but that doesn't seem the case. I realize there is the Bridge option to repackage existing Win32 apps, but that's if I have the source code. Obviously, I only have binaries for most programs so that's really not an ideal solution.\n\n\nI realized I can just RDP with the windows UWP app that exists to a localhost VirtualBox VM, so I can use my Vagrant or individual dev boxes if needed. That's what I thought of today but haven't had time to try it in the MR Simulator. \n\nAlso the MR simulator is a pain in the neck to run with keyboard and mouse. I realize it is far from the ideal option but I'm just evaluating it to see if sinking $500 is justified. Another reason why I'm asking this question because it's so time consuming to test out these ideas in the simulator since I don't have a gamepad. \n\n\nHas anyone had any experience with the MR dev kits from MS? Did you guys try out development, either through an IDE or some UWP app? Was it a pretty good experience? Could you migrate your workflow from the regular windows space to MR? Was the transition a problem or relatively seamless? \n\nHave you had any success with using RDP in MR to run Linux in mixed reality? \n\nFinally, would you recommend it to other developers? \n\nI don't mind strapping some giant ass goggle to my head for hours, if it's a nice use of productivity it wouldn't really be a problem. \n\nBut that's the case, IF is the big question.

From top to bottom, line by line. Now, if I need to search for e.g. some return type from somewhere in the program, then searching from the symbol table is about the same complexity as searching by going through the program again, because the objects are ordered in the same exact way.\n\nOr does it make substantial difference that e.g. the symbol table is a list of lists, whereas my program is in the for of an AST. So that traversing a list of lists is more efficient than traversing an AST?\n\nOr should I perhaps use symbol tables in a stack like manner? That they're scope-specific, e.g. class-specific, so that one construct a symbol table only e.g. per class. And when one leaves the class, then one ditches the symbol table?\n\nWhy do I need a symbol table?\n\n---\n\nEdit: this is perhaps an okay presentation: http://labouseur.com/courses/compilers/AST-and-Symbol-Table.pdf",

        "text": "I am aware of Turing's proof of the undecidability of the halting problem (and I think I understand it). What I'm asking is quite different. I shall define what I mean by \"effectively solvable\":    \n         \n&gt; A problem $P$ is **effectively solvable** if there exists an agent $A_P$, such that for any specific instance of $P \\, (P_i)$, $A$ can solve that instance of the problem $(P_i)$ in a finite time.       \n          \n&amp;nbsp;       \nImagine $A_P$ as a [superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence) with unbounded (but finite) computational power, and unbounded (but finite) memory. $P$ is effectively solvable if $A_P$ would eventually (in finite time) produce a correct solution for any given instance of $P$.     \n&amp;nbsp;             \nIt may be the case that there does not exist any algorithm that \"solves\" diophantine problems, however this does not mean the problem is not effectively solvable. For any given diophantine problem, a sufficiently intelligent agent (or sufficiently competent mathematician) may be able to eventually find its roots using an (**unbounded**) number of mathematical tricks. The mathematical methods applied to diophantine problems is limited only by the creativity of the agent concerned. There are essentially an infinite number of strategies, from which a finite subset may be drawn from in sequence (forming an algorithm) to apply to a particular diophantine problem.     \n&amp;nbsp;                    \nEffective solvability (or effective decidability) is different from the traditional notion of decidability in that problem that are effectively solvable do not require a finite number of steps which always guarantee a solution. In fact, for each instance of an effectively solvable problem, a different algorithm may be used. There may be no general algorithm that solves all instances of a problem, but for each instance of the problem, a tailor made algorithm may exist.      \n&amp;nbsp;                    \nGoing entirely off my intuition here, I think the following is a definition of \"effectively solvable\":      \n         \n&gt; &gt; A problem $P$ is effectively solvable for A if  $\\not\\exists$ an instance $P_i$ of $P |$ A does not solve $P_i$ in finite sequence of steps.       \n         \n&amp;nbsp;                    \nIf there is a tailor made algorithm for every instance of a problem, then a sufficiently intelligent agent can in practice solve every instance of the problem. Thus even if in theory no general solution to the problem exists, in practice, specific solutions to the problem always exist.      \n&amp;nbsp;             \nWhile some of such problems may be \"undecidable\", they are in actuality (for all practical purposes) \"effectively solvable\".      \n&amp;nbsp;             \nThe set of effectively solvable problems is a superset (and I assert that it is a proper superset) of the set of decidable problems.     \n&amp;nbsp;                    \n&amp;nbsp;                     \nAs for my question, I think the halting problem is effectively solvable, but I'm not sure. I suspect this is not what I really want to ask though (I am interested in the answer to the question). What I am truly interested in is effective solvability. Does a concept of effective solvability already exist? Please point me in the right direction to do further study on effective solvability.     \n&amp;nbsp;                        \nI am interested in effective solvability, because the range of problems that can be solved by an AI is not (necessarily) the range of problems that can be solved by a Turing machine, but the range of problems that are effectively solvable. I feel that the traditional notion of decidability is outdated when the computer is a sufficiently intelligent agent (one may make the argument that machine learning already renders traditional decidability obsolete as far as this problem is concerned. Thus when we ask the question:    \n\"What problems can a computer solve?\"      \nI feel the set of effectively solvable problems and not (necessarily) the set of decidable problems is the answer.    \n&amp;nbsp;         \n&gt; What are some problems that are not effectively solvable by your definition?     \n       \nI do not know of any, and I suspected there may be none. To hazard a guess however: \n       \n1. Problems which may involve randomness may not be effectively solvable. In particular if the computer gets the right answer, but doesn't know it got the right answer, then it can never solve that instance of the problem. Such problems are thus not effectively solvable.       \n2. Any problem for which there exists a single instance of the problem for which there does not exist in algorithm that always produces the correct answer for that instance of the problem are not effectively solvable.       \n         \nI may add examples of those two types of problems later, but I cannot think of any succinct examples right now.     \n&amp;nbsp;       \nLet the sufficiently intelligent agent be Omega. For the problem that Omega is tasked to solve, Omega can solve instances of that problem even if Omega does not have a general algorithm for all instances of the problem. Omega can craft a tailor-made solution (algorithm) to any specific instance of a problem. Let all tailor-made algorithms (TMAs) Omega uses on instances of any problem use steps that come from a (countably) infinite set $S$. Consider the set of all finite sequences of steps from $S$, let's call this $T$. $T$ is the set of all possible TMAs that Omega can use on any instance of $S$. $T$ can be thought of as the \"toolkit\" of Omega. The Omega encounters a particular instance of a particular problem (for which Omega has no general algorithm to solve), Omega crafts a TMA to solve that particular instance. This crafting can be thought of as Omega selecting a TMA from $T$.       \n      \n$T$ is countably infinite. Thus Omega's actual operation is selecting an algorithm from an infinite set of algorithms whenever faced with a particular instance of a problem. However, Omega has only finite memory. Thus, Omega never actually stores $T$ in memory. What happens is that whenever Omega faces a certain $P_i$, Omega tries an algorithm to solve that $P_i$. This algorithm may be generated on the spot. However, if Omega faced an infinite number of $P_i$s for some $P$, then it could be seen how Omega employs an infinite number of TMAs to solve each instance of $P$.        \n       \nWhen we say Omega can effectively solve $P$, we're saying that if Omega was fed sequences of some $P_i$ endlessly, that there would never come a time, in which Omega would fail some $P_i$. It is this sense in which we consider Omega hypothetically attempting all $P_i$, in which it becomes useful to think of Omega has having an infinite set of algorithms from which it can draw from.         \n&amp;nbsp;            \nOmega is not a hyper computer or Turing oracle, and may be safely thought of as a Turing machine (or equivalent model of computation). Omega is only faced with specific instances of a problem, and does not need to have a general solution of the problem to be considered as effectively solving it.      \n&amp;nbsp;            \nAssume Omega can effectively solve $P$, but does not know a general algorithm to solve $P$. If for each $P_i$, Omega adopts $t_i$, then you could construct a method for solving $P$ as follows:      \n&gt; If $P_i$, then do $t_i$.       \n&amp;nbsp;            \nHowever, if the sets of all instances of $P$ is an infinite set, then the above method would also contain an infinite number of steps. Does, the above method is **not** an algorithm.         \n&amp;nbsp;              \nYet, it may be the case that Omega does not have a general algorithm for solving $P$, but there does not exist some $P_i$, which Omega would not solve in finite team.       \n&amp;nbsp;     \nEffective solvability can be seen as asking if there is an infinite sequence of steps that solve the problem in the general case. Thus, if a problem is effectively solvable, there may be no algorithm that solves that problem (as such an algorithm would need an infinite number of steps). It is because effective solvability permits methods which contain an infinite number of steps, that I assert that the space of effectively solvable problems is a superset of the space of Turing decidable problems. It is why I draw the distinction between effective solvability and Turing decidability.                \n&amp;nbsp;            \nThe way I think of Omega employs the concept of [Vingean uncertainty](http://intelligence.org/files/ai-alignment-problem-handoutLQ.pdf). The more intelligent Omega is, the more confident I am that Omega would reliably achieve its goals (in this case solve specific instances of specific problems) and the less knowledge I possess of the particular steps Omega would take in achieving it's goals.         \n&amp;nbsp;              \nOmega is of arbitrarily high intelligence. If I am to ask the question of \"What problems can Omega solve?\", then the space of all effectively solvable problems seems like the correct answer to me (I am very convinced that the space of Turing decidable problems may be a wrong answer).

        "text": "I'm trying to design an android application that would give out random prompts in different categories. Categories could be TV, Books, Geography, whatever, and each prompt would be a single string. My first inclination is to use a DB, because of the ability to query and update, but each table in the DB would essentially be a primary key and its related prompt, leaving no relations between tables, which feels like it violates the whole purpose of DBs.\n\nI thought of using XML, but that would require a parser and slow down the process. I thought of using some kind of external file that gets parsed and loaded into memory as an array of strings, but that slows the process down, and eats precious memory. I though of using a text file with one prompt per line, but there's no way to pull a specific line from a file in java without reading the whole file. \n\nSo is it still appropriate DB usage, even if there's no relations between my tables?\n\nEDIT: In the long run, the goal would be to have cross-platform availability, so the DB or whatever I choose to use would be on a server backend. If I put the prompts in a DB would the DB continue to violate the \"rules\" of DBs? \n\nEDIT 2: I apologize for using this as a combo of my programming ducky and a classroom. I'm at the stage where I need to bounce ideas around and get some response so I can finish forming my idea.",

One of the definitions has the following wording:\n\n\"Write a function, named xyz, that takes a single number as an argument and that returns True when the argument is positive and False otherwise.\"\n\nNow I've done a little bit of programming before, enough to know that this kind of instruction would best be solved using a conditional ('if') statement. However, his instructions clearly say\n\n\"You must write this function using a relational operator and without using any sort of conditional (i.e., if); the solution without a conditional is actually much simpler than one with.\"\n\nNow I don't know if that last part is true since nobody in the class can figure it out, but that's beside the point. What other way is there to go about this problem?",
