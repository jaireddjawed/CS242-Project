        "text": "A diagnosis should be something to celebrate, so I want to start off there. I am happy for others that they are happy, that they can get support and help from their diagnosis. I am so happy for them. I am jealous that I feel terrified and can't celebrate. I don't even know if I am autistic I just have my speculations but even my doctor is hesitant to diagnose because apparently, the combination of my other diagnoses resembles some of autism (I am also AFAB). However, I am realizing there is a good chance I have autism and I wish I could celebrate because then I can make sense of some things but instead I am left feeling scared and angry.\n\nMy entire life people have told me I am condescending and argumentative. I have spent my entire life doing everything possible to not be either, and in truth, I am not. I am not a bad person like that by any means, but I feel like I must be. I am not trying to speak to anyone like I know better or as though I am trying to argue or pick apart everything they are saying. The times I have been called this, I have been speaking as empathetically as possible trying to understand the situation. I will analyze the situation or problem from every perspective I can think of and then I will try to communicate the understanding I've reached and hear about the other person's thoughts and feelings because I am not going to make assumptions about a mind outside of my own - I would rather they share with me on their terms. I have lost all my past relationships from this and I am so scared I am going to lose the ones I have worked so hard to maintain if I can't fix the problem. In response to those comments saying I am condescending or argumentative, I've said something along the lines of \"I am so sorry I hurt you in that way, it genuinely was not my intention and I am listening to you, but I am confused because I thought I was communicating, its not fair to you that I didn't make the connection and I am sorry. If it is not too much would you be able to tell me exactly what I did because I don't want to hurt you like that and I am struggling to understand.\" It's exhausting to go through every step all the time I even do this with myself in my own head and I am so sad because I know if it's tiring for me I can only imagine how tired my loved ones are too. I don't want to be destined to hurt people because I haven't been able to communicate in a way they can understand. And I try so hard to make myself translatable. I then over explain desperate for some connection to what I am saying and it makes it worse.\n\nI am jealous and I am angry because if it's just that I've been a shit friend or partner, I can fix that. There is a problem I can fix. But if it's autism I have been struggling with, I can't fix that. I can't make autism go away. I am in no way trying to say people with autism are bad friends or bad people, that's the furthest from my belief. My pain is that if my issues with communication are because I am actually a good person who just happens to also live with autism, I don't know how the fuck I am going to fix that and I am scared that leaves me as someone people don't want to love, or someone that is too much work to love. I already have BPD and while I have had years of therapy and am good at handling it, autism ontop of that feels impossible. I know how hard my BPD can be for my loved ones and I don't want to make it harder for them. In some other diagnoses I have, I can follow the reaction I am having to the root, address the trauma, relax, and move on with my day. It's hard to navigate but I've gotten better with those. I don't know how to navigate even the possibility of autism. I don't want to look at autism like a sentence. I just want to be able to be close to people. I miss having close relationships with people and lately I feel so alone in all of this. I haven't shared these feelings with anyone, and I am sorry for the long post. I just need to know if anyone here understands what I am talking about and can relate\n\nedit for clarification: I am not at all trying to connect bad behaviour to autism. I am trying to say I don't know if I have actually been condescending and argumentative (for example) or if struggling to communicate as someone with (possibly) autism I have been perceived like that - and because of that possibility I am left feeling a sense of hopelessness and dread.",

        "text": "So just today there was a situation in one of my classes where my teacher called on me so I could do my presentation. I felt very overwhelmed and anxious at the time and when he asked me I just froze. I knew what I was supposed to say and I really just wanted to get it over with, but it felt like I physically couldn’t. I couldn’t even manage shaking my head or saying “I’m not ready yet.” I just stayed perfectly still until he moved onto the next person. \n\nThis sort of thing happens to me every so often when I’m asked something or have to make a verbal decision on a whim and I am not prepared to answer, I find it very hard to speak and just go quiet. What makes it odd to me is very often I know exactly what I should say, but I can’t bring myself to speak. Moments after the worst of it I can usually write, but I still find speaking hard. I was just wondering if this sounds like selective mutism? I’m not sure because it doesn’t happen very frequently, and I only have clear memories of it happening in middle school and layer. (Something similar could have happened when I was younger, but possibly not as clear cut?)",

        "text": " \n\nI'm trying to see if my autistic traits were before the age of twelve, but I don't really remember my childhood, and my parents won't cooperate me with me, since they don't think I have it. The only snippets I got from them, was that when I was one years old, I never spoke properly. No one could understand what I was saying, and I would just point at things I would want, or try to communicate with them by pointing. But I'm pretty sure that's normal for one year old.\n\nI remember when I was in grade two, my classmates were doing some kind of puzzle competition with another grade. Strange thing is, I don't even think grade two me knew what was going on, it just happened all of a sudden. Anyway, one day, my classmates found out that someone messed up their progress on the puzzle, I thought they would be mad, but they just laughed it off. Grade two me, was a bit weirded out, but loved the fact that everyone was laughing, even though I didn't understand why. So the next day, I messed up the puzzle COMPLETELY (which they worked really hard on), but instead of laughing, everyone was mad, and the teacher lectured me. And then I felt guilty. Isn't that just young immaturity?\n\nThen, I'm sorry, I literally forgot what I was saying when writing this post LOL. So, I think. When I was in grade nine, my math teacher had a test on some kind of formula. I raised my hand, and said,\n\n\"But all the formulas are on the wall right next to me, are you going to take them down for the test, or did you forget them?\"\n\nHe had indeed forgotten them, and everyone in my class groaned. When I told my parents about the situation my mom told me,\n\n\"No one likes that kind of person.\"\n\nThe teacher didn't move the poster by my seat, but he didn't let anyone sit in it but me. Probably because he knew I wouldn't cheat. And I didn't. Not even if I wanted too. Are these early signs of autism?",

        "text": "I need help...\nI'm Bone (he/they/it) I'm 20. And I think that I might be autistic. But I am not 100% sure about it. I rly don't trust the self tests I took online cause they include a lot of weird assumptions and stereotypes (the ones I took showed rly rly high results tho). I have donne lots of reseach (for over a year now)! Talked to people I grew up with... Including my parents... I've donne everything I can think of and I'm at my limit here...\n\nMy development:\nI can only say what I know and what my parents told me... I don't remember a lot...\n&gt; I was able to speak full sentences at a verry young age\n&gt; bevore the age of 5 I was already able to read and write a bit as well as doing math (+ - x :)\n&gt; verry advanced lerning skill or kinda sucking up the things without any effort cause they just were interesting (as soon as u tell me to do smth I'll loose all motivation tho)\n&gt; also advanced motor skills and a talent for movement in general\n(the more rapid development is what I'm verry confused about because most sources say that delays in development is a huge aspect?)\n&gt; I've always liked to sort things after the colors of the rainbow (getting upset if people destroy that order)\n&gt; also being interested in various textures\n\nOther then that there was nothing unusual... I was rather social untill I had to go to school... \nThat's where I had to \"be grown up\"... Do almost everything on my own... Taking care of my brother... Things got weird... Tw//sh &gt; I started to get rather depressed and started to self harm... Trying my best to keep people thinking that everything was alright... \n\nNow a bunch of years later I'm almost 20... \nI went to 3 therapists in my lifetime... And non of them rly seemed to understand what I was trying to tell them... The last one even suggested that I might be bipolar... So I started doing my own research... \n\nSymptoms I experience that might be related to autism:\n&gt; hyperlexia? (confused about this one because like I said most recouces say that the development is slower and not faster?) \n&gt; stimming (it got more and more over the years! It's a verry helpfull tool to regulate myself... Things like chewing on things... Rocking... Repeating words and sounds etc...)\n&gt; eating habits (I tend to eat the same few things... I know I did that as a child too because the only thing I wanted to eat was a spesific bread with a specific cheese... And omg my parents were in trouble if they out smth else onto that bread XD) \n&gt; routine... I like to have control... To have the same things happening... It's kind of upsetting if smth changes... \n&gt; general change... I will not go into the room if u hang up a different lamp in there untill I feel mentally prepared and safe enough to do so... \n&gt; unusual emotional reactions... I tend to react not age appropriately...? Idk if that makes sense... But in stressfull situations my mind seems to go back to like 3 or 4? It's qwite hard to explain... Sorry\n&gt; hyperactivity and mood swings... This is a point why people would think I'm bipolar.. But since those mood swings tend to last from only 20 minutes to maximal 2 days I don't think that I'm bipolar... \n&gt; hypersensitivity... To light yes... To food well yes... Sounds absolutely... Textures well I tend to wear the same few clothing pieces cause the others make me feel physically uncomfortable so I'd say yes... If combined with stress I do get frequent migraines from stuff like this... \n&gt; hyperempathy... Idk if I'm just a people pleaser and can read peoples energy due to the way I grew up/ trauma... But I'm a highly empathic person \n&gt; eye contact... Slight struggles if I have to hold it... With people who know that I'm listening while looking at the plants behind them I can look into their eyes a lil if I feel comfy enough... \n&gt; physical contact... Only if the person is emotionally close? Don't like to be touched by my parents... Don't like to give people my hand... Bwä (this is smth that didn't appear in my childhood tho) \n&gt; body language (another thing I'm not sure about cause I read a lot about people having no to a not accurate body language?) I have a rly rly excessive body language... \n&gt; nonverbal phases (also a more recent thing?) I suppose that this is more related to anxiety... But I have to depend on my body language if those occour\n&gt; special interests... I like things for a few years and after that they are so sucked up and everyone kind of hates me if I talk about it againnnn and againnnnn... At the moment I rly like moths... I'm drawing them and writing down all facts that I find interesting... I had to start my second book last week... \n&gt; I am qweer (yes I know this is not a symptom... But I saw a lot of stuff related to being autistic and qweer... Experiencing gender and stuff differently...) \n&gt; executive dysfunction... I feel like this is related to my depression more? \n&gt; unusual posture and sitting positions \n&gt; difficulty identifying emotions... I kinda always need soemeone else explaining things... Or explaining situations... In order for me to fully understand and process things\n&gt; being a verry rule bound person... I had no interests in drugs/ alkohol/ skipping school/ doing smth bad or illegal... I find those things rather disgusting and stupid... \n&gt; planning things verry detailed... Well unless it's like a big life desision... I literally can't do smth like that on my own so I kinda let things just happen as I am frozen in a state of pure panic...\n&gt; I like my alone time... And having only a few friends... The important thing for me is to connect on a soul level... Like having 3 months no contact... And being right back in the most deppest conversations ever... I find that to be the easyest with other people on the spectrum or other neurodiversitys... \n&gt; having difficultys connecting with people my age... I connect better with people much older...\n&gt; being \"grown up\" at a young age... And not being able to keep life together now anymore... \n\nThe only thing that is \"missing\" would be the social component? Wich I suppose is a key point? I rly don't care a lot about fitting in or anything... And I like to keep people comfortable with what I say so I am carefull with my words... But there seems to be no big issue (other then people snaping at me if I tell them rly random things cause my mind went places and I felt like it's important to tell them cause it's important for me XD) \n\nDo you think it's something else? Did I miss something in my research? What should be my next step? /gen",

I generally have a very poor level of stress tolerance, to the point where if stress levels are high enough I may start to hallucinate. I don't have psychosis, and I can fully distinguish between hallucinations and reality. Additionally, these issues will only come up under extreme stress and anxiety.\n\nMost days, however, I generally feel \"fine\" and symptoms are manageable. I do have GAD, so I am frequently on edge. Most days, I can handle setbacks, sudden changes, and social situations. Not super well, but I can generally handle it. When these changes occur, I either feel fine or nothing at all. I do have meltdowns and shutdowns, but they're infrequent (approx. every 2-3 months).\n\nHowever, I do notice that whenever things don't go my way, while I may feel neutral, my body will be in physical pain afterwards. This is often in the form of muscle pain, neck pain, or migraines. I feel in pain almost every day and it can impede my ability to function.\n\nThis chronic pain of mine has existed for years, and I have gone to several doctors to figure this out. All blood work is normal, x-rays and brain scans are fine. All I've ever received from doctors is \"you're just stressed out.\" But I am always stressed out! How can I be expected to function properly in society and handle stressors when I am constantly thinking about how to behave properly in public and thinking about my bodily pain?\n\nDoes anyone else here feel this way? Are psychosomatic pains common with Autism?",

        "text": "So, I'll try to keep this succinct. I'm at my lowest level of executive functioning I've ever been. On a good day I can keep interest in hobbies and maybe get something done that needs to be done. But generally I can't do something until it's right in front of me and demands my attention or there's clear consequences for inaction. For example, if I don't get groceries, I don't eat, then I die. But when it comes to job applications, hobbies that take more work like writing, trying to learn a new skill, the overwhelm hits hard and fast. \n\nLooking back I can see this was present my entire life but it looked way different. See, my consequences were very clear when I was going to school and living with my mother. If I made bad grades, I'd get punished, if I didn't go to school, slacked off, whatever, I'd feel her wrath. So as much as I hated it, and hated being forced to do it, it never occurred to me that I could stop and this lasted through college too until the very end. Sure, if I'd have to make a phone call I was overwhelmed. But I *had* to do it. So it'd get done eventually. And this forced structure kept me regulated. \n\nThen I graduated, and I think I did okay for a few months of just relaxing. But then functioning started to slip. I couldn't get into grad school, I couldn't find work. When I actually did find a job it sent me into soul-crushing burnout where I legit believed I was going to psychologically shatter. And in some ways I did. Everything that wasn't an immediate obligation just didn't get done. Any effort beyond that wasn't sustainable for long. \n\nNow here I am, unemployed, unable to look for work because of overwhelm. I'm not firing on even half my cylinders. I'm learning about the PDA profile and there's a lot of it that resonates with me, but there's a lot where I'm not really sure if that's my experience. Like mood swings, in my understanding, a mood swing does an entire 180 of emotion and most of the time I can trace back my logic pretty easily. Is it that my \"demands\" are strictly internal?

As an adult, I do find socialising easier, but feel like I’m putting an act on the whole time. I will say/do things because I believe I should rather than because it comes naturally to me.\n\nI often talk over others or will be very quiet. I’m very comfortable on my own but I do want to be around other people if I’m comfortable with them. People often say that I don’t seem to like them/be interested in them, so I try to do/say things that make me seem interested. Eye contact was an issue as a child but not as an adult.\n\nI fall into rabbit holes of interests. I see assessment questions and it will say do I collect information. I don’t, but I do collect things. For example, I will become interested in plants and buy lots of them\n(More than most people) over a period of time. Then I will become interested in something else and repeat the pattern.\n\nI don’t really like change much.

Like being sensitive to light, and noticably less sensitive to smells than people around me. \nOr needing certain items to be sorted and in their place, and working better with routines. Even though I am  quiet chaotic in other things. \n \nBut then there are the things I can't see in myself, so clearly. Especially when it comes to sepecial intressets. \nThe two only things I could see that way are climbing and reading. But then they both don't quiet fit. \n\n1. Climbing: I do it once a week regularly, with the exception of school holidays in my area. I like it, and feel restless and depressed if I can't do it (especially if it's not planed). But not beoned what wouldn't be explainable by missing out on physical and mental stress relievers. \n\n2. Reading: First of it's mostly fiction. And while I do it almost every day, preferably several hours a day, there are times I don't do it nearly as much. It's always a few weeks, where I am busy writing, being creative, daydreaming, playing games, or researching a specific topic until I am sadisfyed. Than I will go back to reading. \n\nNow my question is could it count as special interest despite what I have discribed, or am I looking at something different that only sounds familiar? \n\nThanks for reading this up until now.",

        "text": "One of the things that has really surprised me since discovering autistic communities online a year ago, is the way that many people seem willing to make generalizations about entire groups, but especially autistic men. There's currently a thread on this subreddit where it is happening.\n\nI don't know how to state this without causing a barrage of argument. It is not okay to generalize about any group. It is not okay to say 'all autistic men are misogynistic, rude, entitled, selfish, etc etc'.\n\nIt is okay to say you have had negative experiences with autistic men. It is okay to say that some men tend to act a certain way. It is not okay to clearly engage in statements that say that all autistic men are the same.\n\nI am a trans woman, but I didn't know that until a few years ago. I also didn't know I was autistic. I have 'masked autism', or what some people like to call female autism. \n\nAnd yet, if I had known I was autistic, but not known I was trans, I would be reading these threads, and thinking that everyone in the community hates me. Coddled, selfish, misogynistic. The only reason that I am 'safe' from these words, is because I am transgender. \n\nAnd the coldest fact about this, is that these comments are talking about marginalized, disabled people. Boys who are isolated and bullied by neurotypicals at school already. Guys who struggle socially their whole lives. And then they come on reddit, and they see this barrage of comments about how AWFUL they are.\n\nAnd I just don't think it's okay. I am asking people, please, to show a little bit of restraint in the words they use. To not generalize about a marginalized group. Because you are not just talking about one kind of autistic man, you are not just talking about the loud one who stands too close in conversations. You are also talking about the shy boy with social anxiety who feels alienated from everyone. \n\nWords can be harmful, especially when aimed at people who are already suffering.

I am genuinely looking for help because the obsession is getting out of hand.\n\nAs the question in the title sort of implies, I struggle with obsessive and repetitive thoughts regarding a number of topics (because my mind is quite hyperactive amd I can see a multitude of possibilities very quickly) which also comes with a load of doubts. I am trans, so gender identity was/is one of said topics. And autism is also one of them ever since I learned about it, approximately 2 years ago. I think about it every day unintentionally and intentionally. \n\nI am not diagnosed and wanted to get evaluated, but my therapist dismissed my concerns with outdated opinions so I don't feel confortable talking about it with him (he said I was \"too empathetic\" to be autistic and that I \"couldn't convince him otherwise\"). I have already made quite a few posts about my therapist (who's great, and I probably wouldn't be alive if it weren't for him), and this isn't one of them.\n\nSo, just like with gender identity where I tried to stop thinking about it (I would call myself stupid and a faker whenever I thought about it and I removed people from my Instagram following that would talk about the topic etc...) I am trying to do the same with autism. Because everything I do seems to be connected to it but I also know about the existence of confirmation bias, so I just constantly feel ridiculous. I am just worried that being a lonely sensitive person who struggles socially but that is somewhat clever enough to compensate made my experiences in life look more similar to an autistic person's experiences rather than a neurotypical person's but that I am not autistic.\n(Of course, with gender identity, it didn't work out because it turned out to be rooted in something that was indeed there.)\n\nI thought that getting evaluated for autism/adhd would stop these questions, but it turns out to be very difficult to be evaluated if your therapist doesn't believe you and when you're underage. \n\nI genuinely don't know what to do. It's constantly in my mind and I want a break.",

        "text": "For some reason, when I saw the “black and white thinking” trait for autism, I thought they meant by morals. And I didn’t relate. But I recently heard that is not what it is. It’s all or nothing thinking, apparently?\n\nAnd I think I have that. I don’t eat for an entire day if the cafeteria doesn’t have the food that I normally buy. (Seriously, there are other stuff there, but I just don’t eat if they don’t have what I always order)\n\nIf my sister wants to share food with me (which I absolutely despise doing), I’d just give everything to her. It’s either her or me. Either I don’t share and have it all to myself, or I share and she has it all to her self, it’s kind of rare to actually share stuff with her (unless I was forced  to, like I was in childhood. And I hated having those conversation where my mom told me that I needed to share more, for some reason, I just really hated sharing with people. What’s the point of ordering ten piece chicken nuggets if you don’t have all ten? If I wanted to eat nine nuggets, I would’ve ordered nine, why do I have to give one to you, when you could’ve just ordered nuggets?) \n\nThat was my thinking, and I’m ashamed of it, so I always thought that was just me being spoiled and difficult.\n\nAnd there another thing about Autistic people wanting or having schedules, and I thought to myself “I don’t have schedules. I don’t even like schedules”\n\n But that’s not really true. I do like having schedules, but it’s another thing to follow them,  and I admit that I desperately need one since my life is a mess so much that I procrastinated on making French toasts for an entire day, and then decided to make them at 10 in the night. I Love French toasts, I think this is the fourth time I made it this week lol. One time I woke up, and couldn’t go back to sleep, so I made French toasts at 2 in the morning. It’s just my go too food, even if it made me have stomachache one time, I’d still eat it the next day.\n\n\nOne thing I do remember about my childhood is me having stomache before I went to school, (even if I ate a warm breakfast),  my mom told me that it was just anxiety. And I stand by that. But why do I feel anxious when meeting family members? Why do I treat them like their strangers I have to be polite too? It’s not like they did me anything wrong, but I’m always hesitant to go in social situation, because I always end being really quiet (especially when there are groups), and i have no idea why. It’s just some state that i involuntarily go too. Why can I act like myself at home, but act like a completely different person in social situations? It’s like some kind of trance that I can’t break out of. I usually don’t smile as much, but when I was at school, I smile not in a happy way, but in a, “I hope you think that I’m friendly way”\n\nI don’t feel exhausted when I come home, just…drained. So I do stuff to make me feel energized, but then that turns into procrastination, and the next you thing you know, I’m doing homework late in the night, and rushing to get it finished before it’s due. I’ve never cried about it, but sometimes I feel like crying about it. (Like that one time I had to answer 219 questions for an assignment. My teacher gave me two weeks of midterm, and three days. I procrastinated  up until the last minute to get it done, and by last minute I mean, at 10 P.M in the night, although it’s due  in the morning)\n\nI didn’t make it, obviously. And I ended up getting lectured because I tried to do an assignment of 219 question at 10 in the night, and expected to be finished by at least 2 am. I stood up all night, and still hadn’t finished it. For some weird reason my teacher gave me another chance, since it was the last grade we had to turn in, (God bless her soul)\n\nAnd I remember working on it in the afternoon (mind you I already completed some questions) all the way to six in the morning.",

        "text": "I’m feeling 99% sure I have autism. Over the past couple weeks I’ve been hyper fixated on ADS symptoms, criteria, tests, forums, and compiling lists and memories. I’m almost done reading Unmasking Autism and it feels like it has explained my own life to me in a way I never could. \n\nI’m in my third decade, married and graduated with my associates with honors. I asked my wife to read my reasons and she said I wasn’t crazy for thinking so. She also said she’d mentioned to me before that I might have autism but I guess I forgot. Seems like my whole life has been explaining away all the “weird” things I tell myself I shouldn’t do in front of others.\n\nMy earliest memory I’m embarrassed by is hand flapping around age 7. I used it when happy/upset/frustrated, or to help me sleep. I quickly became ashamed of this and molded it into intense body tensing as a private stim. Publicly as an adult I leg bounce like my life depends on it, dawn to dusk. I wasn’t a good child, I was “strong willed” and had many melt downs with a self injurious streak that caused my family grief. I recall extreme frustration, feelings of great misunderstanding against me, and general confusion as to why things were so hard. As a child I compulsively licked the corners of my mouth until they were sores, and of course I picked at them until they bled. Constant somersaulting, rubbing my head on the floor, and shaking my head back and forth. As a child I saw several Christian counselors which did worse than nothing.  \n\nI had select close friends as a child and teen, but always felt content to let those who gravitated toward me do so, and didn’t seek out friendships.  \n\nI was told I had ADHD as a child but “grew out of it.” \n\nChronic depression and anxiety since a teen. \n\nI was an energetic and talkative kid, but now a subdued and quiet adult. I recall being bullied for being too rambunctious during peer games, told consistently that I was loud. Nowadays it’s hard to talk about anything that interests me to other people.\n\nExtreme sensory likes and dislikes, texture issues, aversions to certain sounds. \n\n I’ve always been easily led down rabbit trails, but didn’t really know what “hyper fixating” was. But I can certainly tell my “special interest” is music and a specific band that I like collecting their music, documenting their concerts that I like on spreadsheets with annotations and notes of what I like best or what makes it special. Cataloging of my favorite versions of their live songs. \n\nI’m always regulating myself so I’m not talking others ears off about my special interests. Always regulating all my behavior, facial expressions for sure. Just trying to convey what I think others want to see. Eye contact is tough, I can maintain for a little while but too much or too little is hard to tell.\n\nThey’re a constant “brain radio” playing. If I’m lucky it’s music, very very detailed music. Usually when I’m interacting with others at work or making eye contact it’s static, which means I’m usually missing things in conversation, waiting for it to be filled in by context later. Lots of nodding and laughing. \n\nI watch others to try and read the room and tell how others are doing. But it doesn’t really help much? \n\nI need very clear expectations at work so I know exactly what’s expected of me. Always worried I’m not meeting expectations. \n\nAs a child I would refuse to hug family that wasn’t mom or dad. I was eventually broken of this and as an adult I can endure hugs as a social pleasantry. \n\nIn all conversations it feels like there is some subtext I am missing.\n\nThe feeling that I’m putting on a show for everyone. And different shows for different people. \n\nI guess I’m looking for opinions because my wife is just one person, and this has all been terribly confusing. I think I’ve just said “no that can’t be me” all my life. But my parents have never mentioned autism to me. If I can remember all this, what did they see and ignore?\n\nI’ve read some about autistic burnout which sounds like me. After I got my associates I went to 4 year college but my work supervisor whom I was close with was unexpectedly let go and I failed all but one of my classes and haven’t been back to school since. I’ve since changed jobs and after starting began waking at 4:30am most mornings to have a panic attack which would subside before work. \n\nTransitions are so hard. And everything has become so hard after these set backs. It feels like I should be to handle what I have going on, like everyone else handles things but it all takes so much concentration. When I get home from work I have to rest for hours.",

So I'm going to show some of them, in hopes maybe someone can give me the green or red light and let me know what to do, so here we go:\n\n- As a baby, I started walking smoothly at 9 months and started talking at 18 months.\n\n- Constant Insomnia\n\n- Really bad posture (sitting and standing)\n\n- I always loved as a kid moving my arms the water, feel the currents on my skin or put my palms between surface and into the water to feel the edge of it (it feels really nice)\n\n- I get frustrated really easily, if I can't nail it in the first try, I get very upset and in the edge of meltdown.\n\n- I'm really good at understanding hard or complicated things, but I get easily confused at simple tasks or lessons.\n\n- I only learn when I study on my own, if someone tries to explain things to me, I won't understand no matter how much I try to get it.\n\n\nI'll that's all I can think of, they probably sound kind of stupid, I have a lot more evidence and I believe I do fit in the criteria, but I just wanted to check on this more... \"silly\" aspects of myself.

        "text": "Hi.\n\nSo, I'm still waiting for my assessment. But the more research I do, the more certain I am that I have autism.\n\nThe thing is, I think I'm now feeling more trapped and debilitated because I know I am different from others. I have observed people this way my entire life - wondering why socialising for these people is as easy as breathing.\n\nI went to my first university class in weeks. I'd been avoiding them because I was suffering from burnout, and the anxiety has been too much. But this one class, my god, it was so difficult to sit in a room with those people.\n\nI was on the front row, with the teacher stood right in front of me - occasionally, she'd make eye contact - and I kept forcing myself to sort of look at her to acknowledge what she was saying, as I've always done in these instances - but I just felt my skin fucking crawling and my eyes burning. It was so painful. I couldn't look my 'friend' in the eye either - the girl who I sit with in this class. I couldn't make small talk. I know she probably thinks I'm awkward. Plus, I'm now noticing myself whenever I get the timing wrong in conversations. Now I know what that's about and why it happens. Then, I mentally kick myself for being stupid and awkward and a freak.\n\nI'm really honestly just feeling suicidal. This is so unbearable. I'm unable to feed myself properly because I'm too scared to go outside. I've not slept because I haven't been able to. I don't feel tired, but my eyes hurt. My stomach is sore from not eating enough.\n\nFor years, I put all this down to PTSD and social anxiety, which I was diagnosed with. But my god, it just makes so much sense for it to be autism. I spent so much money trying to treat these diagnosed conditions, to no avail.\n\nI just feel so trapped.\n\nThis feeling isn't new, though. It's not just begun since I started to ponder whether I'm autistic or not. I just had been suffering and forcing myself to put up with it. I thought it was fucking normal. I'm in so much pain, though. Everything is too overwhelming for me. I feel broken.\n\nIf anyone has any advice/can relate, please respond. Thank you.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismTranslated/comments/11ak4r1/could_i_be_autistic/",
        "text": "Okay so to start off, this is going to be long and I know none of you can give me a diagnosis or anything I just need to know if it is possible I am autistic. Also sorry if I make any errors, English isn’t my first language. \nTruthfully, I‘m doubting I‘m autistic but it’s still in the back of my mind so just some of your thoughts could help I think? I mean online tests say I‘m autistic but yk how they are \n\nMy mom killed herself when I was 11 and I only now started going to therapy (I‘m 16). I know that some signs of ptsd and other mental health issues can overlap with signs of autism, so maybe it’s that?\n\n\nSigns it could be autism:\n- stimming: I’m pretty sure I’m doing it now. Like flapping my hands when excited and stuff like that but I think I only started doing that about a year ago or so? Idk it’s so weird I feel like I only started showing signs in my late puberty. Or could it be I read that it’s an autistic thing and started doing it subconsciously? But then the question would be why. But I think I did stim during my childhood, not too noticeably but always chewing on stuff (my shirt, pens, my favorite stuffed animal) or rhythmically flexing the muscles in my thighs (sounds weird, I know but I always did that and still do it). Just things that wouldn’t make me stand out and I could do in peace. But even by myself I wouldn’t noticeably stim. \n- Sensory issues: Sunlight and chewy bits in orange juice are my mortal enemies. Also some fabric. Or when I notice my hair on my forehead or the jewelry on my skin and it has to stop touching me immediately. Peak living condition: sunglasses and headphones all the time. I’m also a very picky eater and I eat bread for breakfast and dinner like every day. But my dad tells me I haven’t been picky with food in my childhood at all. I have also never thrown hissy fits (is that the right word? Idk) about fabrics or stuff like that. So maybe I‘m just noticing things that are slightly uncomfortable and making a big deal out of it? I actually don’t know. Normally I‘m pretty self aware but I just don’t know if my problems are actually bad or I’m just over exaggerating. \n- Special interests: I think I have some? I heard the term hyperfixation, though and I think that’s more like it. Except media criticism and like all things internet and fandom (I’ve been obsessed with stuff like that for years) and Pokémon (it fades im and out but I would count it as a special interest, considering how many years I spend collecting cards, watching the series and playing the games. Also my fixation on it is back after laying low for two years, I think?). Other than that it’s TV Shows, books or movies for some months and then sometime again later but more often than not I move on to a new fixation. My dad and some of my friends point out that my fixations are way too intense and it’s weird so, yeah.\n\nSigns it’s not autism:\n- meltdowns: I don’t remember much of my childhood, only snippets but I know I never had a meltdown. Is it even possible to have autism without having meltdowns? Like, I would cry if my classmates got too loud or if I had to throw something out (one time I remember I had to change my name sticker in school because there were horses on it and my school wanted uniformed nametags and I started crying, that was in fifth grade, before my mom died) but I never had the urge to hit myself or something like that. I don’t even know if I cried often during my kindergarten and elementary school days\n- Non-verbal: I have never gone non-verbal. There are times where I don’t necessarily want to speak but after I‘m actually at school and with my friends the feeling goes away. It’s more like I‘m hyper-verbal (is that a term?). It’s like I never shut up and I know I‘m annoying people but I just can’t shut up. I’m also oversharing too strangers way too much (evidence 1: this post). Not only about myself but about others too. It’s like I don’t know when to stop. Or how to stop. \n- Routines: I don’t need a routine. I mean I have one as far as that I wake up every morning, dress, brush my teeth, eat breakfast and go to school but that’s just because it’s what everyone does in the morning. Whenever there are changes to my normal day to day life I don’t get upset (except sometimes because I‘m having alone-time and I don’t want to do anything. Or when it collides with something already planned yk). I need to Plan things, definitely but as long as you can tell me where and when we’re meeting it’s fine if it’s tomorrow \n\nAnd the one big thing which is incredibly important and I have no clue: people. So, I have a Hard time with smalltalk. Do I like talking to people? Yes, actually. Do I want to talk to people? Depends. If it is someone i can talk to about specific topics and/or if I know what they like? Yes. If it’s someone I don’t know and don’t know what to talk about? Horror. My dad tells me as a child I have been very social. Always had friends, talked to many people, never had problems. I wish I know if I ever felt weird or out of place like I do now but fact is I don’t. So I only have my dads word to trust and the fact that I know I had friends. I still have friends. It’s hard keeping friends for a long time but my best friend is basically me in another font so we get along great. I feel like she’s also the only person who gets me. And she respects my boundaries and accepts my „quirks“ without judging me. \nBack on topic though, I don’t know if I get social cues because I have no clue what those really are. I can pick up on when people change their tone to indicate sarcasm or disappointment (subtle changes are more hard to grasp and idk if I get those). I also mirrored people since I remember or picked up on certain traits after watching a TV show (watched friends and called all my friends „sweetie“ for like two months. Not my best moment). And idk if I‘m masking. The faces I make are very exaggerated, bordering on cartoonish to convert my emotions but I do that subconsciously. It’s like I’m aware my reactions are over the top but it’s „natural“ (idk what masking feels like, is that masking?). The best I can describe it is when you start doing a bit ironically and then it turns into something you do subconsciously. If I’m tired it’s harder for me to control my voice or face, though. But I think that’s normal? (Not saying autism isn’t normal, more like what all people do)\n\n\n\nOkay, wow, I think that was all? At least everything I can think of now, might edit it later who knows\n\nIf anyone read until here, thank you and your thoughts would be greatly appreciated.",

I feel like there should be a light bulb going off whenever I hear stuff like that, but it doesn't. I actually get bored of things pretty quickly, and move on to the next to obsess over. \n\nI do better with shows that come out weekly, and I genuinely like to keep that schedule. Mostly because no matter how much I like a show, I lose interest in it pretty quickly after a couple of episodes. So I like the fact that there aren't any options when watching stuff that comes out weekly, because then, I'll never get bored of it. \n\nThis happened to me with Attorney Woo (A show I really enjoyed, but then I missed two deadlines, and then it just felt overwhelming to watch the rest of the episodes, and now it's been a year and I still haven't finished it.)\n\nThis also happened with A Crash Course on Romance (A  show I really loved, and it came out with weekly episodes, but then I missed one deadline, and I'm pretty sure it's finished now, and I will never watch it.)\n\nAnd now it's happening with the new show The Last of Us. Luckily, I make sure I watch every episode weekly. I really like the structure it gives me.\n\nI go on rants and my parents think that I'm 'too much'. Once, someone asked me if a show was good, and instead of just answering yes, I went into the dynamics of the fandom, the actors playing the characters, how good the adaption was, and why I disagree with some of the opinions the fandom has. And now whenever my family or someone else asks me a question, they either interrupt my beginning of a rant or when I'm in the middle they just say 'no. I'm not going to hear all that'\n\nBut I feel like I don't know what it feels like to hyper fixate.",

        "text": " \n\nTLDR:  I thought I received an official autism diagnosis months ago but now I'm not so sure.  Please send help.  \n\nSo I received an autism diagnosis seven months ago, in July 2022, at age 27.  I'd suspected that I might be autistic since I was a teenager; the idea just kind of lived in the back of my mind for over a decade, and I finally decided to seek out a diagnosis after going through a particularly nasty bout of depression.  \n\nWhen I made the diagnostic appointment, I really wasn't sure whether or not I was autistic, and I felt confident that I'd be able to accept the results either way.  I didn't necessarily think it would change much about how I thought about myself or lived my life.  But I was wrong!  The diagnosis had a hugely positive impact on me; I started reading a lot about masked autism (I definitely fell down the post-diagnosis \"autism as a special interest\" rabbit hole) and felt understood in ways I'd never imagined I would.  \n\nHowever, as I was reading more and more about autism, I inevitably came across accounts of other adults' diagnostic experiences, and was struck by how different my experience was.  Many people described taking a whole battery of tests stretched across multiple in-person provider visits, waiting weeks to get the results, and then receiving a detailed, multi-page report.  I didn't get any of that--my process consisted of a virtual two-hour interview that, according to the provider's website, was \"outlined by the two psychological tests that together form the \"gold standard\" for understanding and diagnosing neurodiversity across the spectrum (ADOS-2 and ADI-R)\".  No other tests were involved.  I received my results immediately, and was only given a one-page letter confirming my diagnosis.  \n\nAfter doing more research, I'm pretty confident that I wasn't *really* given the ADOS.  I'm sure she observed my behavior to some degree, but I didn't have to do any of the hallmark activities (like narrating the wordless picture book or creating a story with random items), and she didn't really even ask me any of the hallmark questions (like asking me to describe emotions, etc).  Plus it was virtual, so I'm not sure how she could have adequately assessed certain nonverbal behaviors like eye contact, even though she claimed that my eye contact was irregular.  \n\nThis person is also licensed as a social worker, not a psychologist or psychiatrist--can social workers even officially diagnose autism?  \n\nI've had a hard time getting my regular psychiatrist to believe that I might be autistic, and showing her the one-page letter I received certainly didn't help.  I know that the autism diagnosis is a social construct and that I probably shouldn't care this much, but the obsessive perfectionist in me kind of needs it to be officially official, or I'll always have some impostor syndrome.  When I made the diagnostic appointment, I didn't know any better and thought that it would be officially official, but now I'm really not convinced that it is.  I feel like I was scammed.  \n\nAlso, now that I've read all about the ADOS, I'm not sure I can reliably take it, since I know what it consists of and what they're looking for.  \n\nThanks for reading.  Can you offer any advice?  What makes a diagnosis official?  And if mine wasn't, how do I make peace with that? ",

        "text": " \n\nOne of the things that keep popping up is 'obsession with numbers, and dates' or at least comforted by them. Me? I hated math when I was younger, but I just realized that people don't see math the way I do. For instance, I give personalities to numbers (specifically the multiplication table)\n\nSeven always hated and envied six because six got the number 24 when multiplied with four. And 4 minus 24 is 20, so it was way easier, and me viewing it as way easier meant that six was way closer to 4. And what was funny is that six is like a little brother to four despite the fact that four is a way smaller number. What was even funnier was that six, to me, was seen as the always chatty and talkative person who loves people (or should I say numbers? LOL). He always talks to people about what he's interested in, and has no self-awareness on when they're annoyed. In my mind, whenever I multiplied six with a number, the other number would sigh or roll their eyes because they were paired with six. The only number that loves six (except for four) was three. But ironically, Six really hated three.\n\nThree was kind of like the baby of numbers. Three was very naïve and was more curious than anything. Six just had some unexplainable hatred towards him, because when it's multiplied with it, it gets 18. Don't ask me how I came to that conclusion.\n\nHell, sometimes I giggle to myself when I multiply these specific numbers. It's also pretty strange how I only focused on six, three, four, and seven, with an occasional eight.\n\nAnd two was just a motherly number, while five was the older sister. (I also have this thing where when adding certain things I go like 7+7=14, and 7-1 is six, so 6+7 is thirteen since it's minus one)\n\nI really hope I'm not annoying anyone by this question, and if I offend, I really don't mean to. Sometimes I'm not aware of what I'm saying to people (which is why I keep my mouth shut most of the time. But alas, I'm going against my judgement and posting on the internet like an idiot)\n\nIs this neurotypical of me? \n\nI also have zero problem with laughing at jokes, but sometimes I feel like I don't get things...?  \nLike just a couple of minutes ago, I was asked how my class went so I said \"It was nice\", but they got frustrated with me because I didn't elaborte on it, and refused to. I just didn't know what to say, and I feel like there is nothing to elaborate on. If it was nice, it was nice.\n\nMy mom got frustrated with me because I didn't \"show\" that I was excited for something. And one time, my grandmother asked me for A fry, so I gave her one. She asked for another one, so I did. She then laughed with mom about how I only gave her one fry, but she didn't specify that she needed multiple??? She said \"a fry\" not \"some fries\"\n\nHow was I supposed to know she was asking for multiple? Is the problem me? \n\n**1 CommentShareSave**",

My test scores from Embrace Autism were all extremely high. I’ve had great results from making sensory accommodations for myself. My childhood lines up with that of a semi-masked AFAB person. Post-testing, I’m feeling worried that they’re going to attribute what I’m experiencing to my trauma or, worse, my previous BPD diagnosis. It would just be so invalidating to hear that after finding a community I relate to and a diagnosis that explains who I am to such a full extent.\n\nI have three weeks to ruminate until I get my results and I don’t know how my OCD (official dx) brain is going to deal with that. \n\nAny advice for chilling the eff out in the meantime? \n\nPS that six hours of testing fully fried my brain so I’m sorry if this doesn’t make sense.",

        "text": "I'm 32f, recently diagnosed and looking for help coping with a thing that I can not for the life of me figure out! I'm not sure if it's because I lack the ability to ask proper questions to therapists or if they lack the ability to help to the extent I need (maybe it's both), but they never seem able to tackle this one with me. Nothing against them of course, I appreciate all that they do!  \n\n\nAnyway, I believe my problem is in general executive function that's being exacerbated by something else. I struggle to do things I *want* to do on top of the things I don't. Been suggested many possible solutions (lists, therapeutic mindsets, journaling, meditation, daily routines, self-care techniques, etc) and am even on Vyvanse, yet nothing seems to work or I don't know how to make them work for *me* specifically. It's so bad that I can't even get motivated to engage in my special interest despite obviously really wanting to, so the suggested strategy of trying to utilize this interest itself to create drive is fruitless too. That alone makes me feel quite powerless within myself on top of the other branches of stress in my daily life that have cropped up due to this. For the record, I wouldn't say I experience any self hatred from this, moreso just general frustration at the constant burnout I'm facing while not being able to reliably engage myself in activities that are normally therapeutic to me.  \n\n\nThe medication worked for a while but I believe it was because I had so many new things to try while utilizing its effects. Now that its been a couple years and that \"honeymoon phase\" is over, it feels like I've exhausted every goal I could have used to keep up the desire to just do things. I've looked into the possibility of certain fears holding me back, namely my fear of uncertainty, but no matter how much self analysis and research I do, I can't figure out why this fear is stopping me so much that I'm paralyzed to do literally anything even if I know how irrational this all is. I'm trying to find a logical answer to things I don't even understand the logic of in the first place and it's driving me insane!  \n\n\nSo obviously a lot of this is coming from ADHD-related issues however, as I said earlier, I feel there could be something within the autistic traits specifically that's causing issues that are then being made worse by the classic ADHD paralysis... but since I'm still new to this diagnosis, I don't know where to start problem solving or how to ask for help. Hell, maybe there isn't a specific problem at all and I've simply created this mental roadblock unknowingly for some reason... either way, I don't have the ability to define that reason or to create my usual branches of problem solving on the big tree that is my mind.  \n\n\nIf I had to use a metaphor to describe this struggle, it'd be that I'm constantly given amazing tools to help me paint the masterpiece I see in my head, but every time I eagerly attempt to pick up one of the tools it disappears as if it never existed. Some of the tools even disappear before I've gotten the chance to see them at all, yet I know they exist *somewhere*. I try to adapt, learning to paint with my fingers, but that can't work either because the paint slips right off. Basically, all the solutions are in front of me, yet I lack the ability to use or even perceive them at all.  \n\n\nI know this must be relatable to many of you, so if you have any life experiences or advice to share that you think could relate to these issues, please let me know. Thank you for taking the time to read this and if you need any clarification or other info that may help you help me, I'd be happy to share!",

The change in diagnostic approach taken by DSM-5 most likely reflects a growing body of research over the past decade that has identified both shared and distinct risk factors and phenotypic manifestations. [...]\n\nThe change in nomenclature from\n‘subtypes’ in DSM-IV to ‘presentations’ in DSM-5 reflects increasing evidence that symptoms are often fluid within individuals across their lifespan rather than stable\ntraits. The ‘presentation’ represents the person’s current symptomatology which may change over time: For example, in ADHD, inattentiveness may be relatively stable across development, but hyperactivity and impulsiveness [...] importantly, ASD is no longer an exclusion criterion, which is a fundamental change from DSM-IV and this, together with other comorbid conditions, should be noted.\n\nThe co-occurrence of ADHD and ASD presents in those both with and without intellectual disability.There are diagnostic challenges for both conditions especially for those with subtle or ‘mild’ presentations,\nwhen difficulties are ‘masked’ by other comorbid conditions, ‘camouflaged’ by compensatory strategies, and/or when there is limited information about childhood functioning when making the diagnosis of ADHD or ASD for the first time in adults.\n\nThe high rate of co-occurrence between ADHD and ASD means that both conditions should be considered when one of the conditions is present; ASD may confer\ngreater risk for co-existing ADHD where the prevalence of the dual diagnoses appears to be somewhat higher. \n\nLink: https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-020-01585-y",

I have always exhibited autistic traits, especially throughout my early-mid childhood, but they have been widely ignored and dismissed due to me being a woman and \"overly sensitive\", or seen as traits of a \"gifted\" kid. When I have brought up concerns about these traits and how they seem to be making my life significantly tougher than other people my age who don't have these traits and don't struggle with the things that I do, most of my immediate family, excluding my younger sibling, have said that these are things that everyone struggles with just as much as I do, and that I'm being dramatic for bringing my concerns up so often. My younger sibling and many of my friends however, after conversations about this, have told me that I should seek a diagnosis, and many of them say that they always thought I was autistic but didn't want to offend me by bringing it up. Because of limitations involving insurance and where I live, it is hard to find a doctor who does not have a history of complaints of racism, homophobia, and sexism that is available any time soon and covered by my insurance. I am currently on a very long waiting list (about 2 years long) to see a doctor who could give me an evaluation. Are there any steps I could take or services that I am unaware of that could help me reach an official diagnosis sooner? Also, what are the steps I should take before calling myself a self diagnosed autistic person? I have taken a few online tests and looked over some diagnosis criteria that doctors use, but am not sure if that is enough. To give an example, I have taken the RAADS-R test on embrace autism a few times in the past year, answering as honestly as possible each time. The scores have ranged from the lowest score being 142 and the highest (also most recent) score being 189. \n\nThank you for any and all responses, and thank you for reading.",

He doubts he will go all the way towards a formal diagnosis but both he and his therapist agree there is a solid chance that is what he is struggling with. Apologies if struggling isn't the right word, but it is causing significant negative impact on his life.\n\nOk, ok, what's my question. I am working to set up a safe place for him within our home. I have ADHD and have found my own safe space to help a lot when I am overstimulated. Try as we might to avoid triggers and de-escalate, my SO does have meltdowns. During these he gets very physically agitated (raises up on the balls of his feet, starts rubbing his hands together, he basically vibrates). More worryingly, he sometimes hits himself. I have tried to help redirect that energy to something that isn't, well, himself, like a pillow or the bed, but I am wondering if there is something more purpose-built for this that I can include in his space? As a fidgeter, I use a multitude of fidget toys to help express my energy but most fidgets wouldn't hold up in this scenario. I know these sorts of things are heavily dependent on the individual, but I feel like we are navigating this a bit blindly. These episodes aren't new to us but the idea of autism being at the root is.\n\nAs an aside, any general advice, references, etc. would be greatly appreciated. I did search the sub (and the internet) a bit before, but there is so much information out there and it is so unbelievably overwhelming.\n\nThanks in advance!!\n\nTl;dr: When my husband melts down, he is sometimes physically violent towards himself. Are there item(s) / product(s) I can provide him to help redirect this?",

I said I had and then she pulled out the DSM-5 and we went through the criteria together. I fit all the categories and I also related to a lot of autistic experiences. Also, both my father and brother are autistic, so it makes sense.\nHowever, my psychologist said she does not specialize in autism. So I thought this was more of a suggestion than anything. I could be autistic or this could be other things too.\nSince then we’ve talked about autism in our sessions, but it all felt very up in the air for me. So, today I asked about evaluations and she told me it wasn’t really necessary. If I really want to be a 1000% sure or I want accommodations for college, I could seek an evaluation. But otherwise, it’s not something that is needed to say that I’m autistic. She said I meet all the criteria and there is no singular god ordained test that will turn me from allistic to autistic. \nIf she’s not an autism specialist and just a psychologist, can she diagnosis me with autism? I understand for certain things, like disability accommodations, I would need an evaluation. However, I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was younger, so I already have all the accommodations I could need. But would her word also count as form of diagnosis?\n\nPS I do believe self diagnosis is valid. For myself, I’d rather have some professional backing to a diagnosis.\n\nTLDR: Can my psychologist, who is not an autism specialist, diagnosis autism without an evaluation?",

My wife has stayed with her position that she will not recognize online tests or validate my feelings without a diagnosis from a doctor.  I think that is fair.  I do have the tendency to jump the gun a LOT!  I am very impulsive.  So, when she and I move to her home state of North Carolina, I will look into the process of getting tested.\n\nBut I will be honest with the doctor, for the first time in my life.  I won't mask.  For reference, I have masked with pretty much every therapist, psychiatrist, or doctor I've ever seen.  It is just something I do without thinking.  Probably why no one has ever suspected autism.  Because I never talked about my challenges.  So, I am planning to do it next year.\n\nThings I want to know:\n\n* why do I have the tendency to run down stairs when there is no one there to see me\n* why do I stim, if all I have is ADHD\n* why do I avoid eye contact often.  To be perfectly clear, I am perfectly happy to do normal eye contact with people I know well.\n* why have I disassociated in the past\n* why do annoying sounds cause discomfort\n* why do I not react well to extreme emotion\n* why do I always feel pulled to the same subjects and topics and not like to read about other things?\n* why am I immature for my age, despite wanting to change that\n* why did I drink, even though I hate the feeling of being drunk\n* why can't I tell when women are flirting with me (yes, my wife has witnessed and verified this)\n* why do I miss social cues\n\netc.\n\nI am 99.9999% sure I am autistic.  But I am willing to do the work for a formal diagnosis.  Do they generally accept insurance?",

        "text": "So I’ve been researching autism for a long time but I’m still unsure if I have it. I am diagnosed with ADHD/OCD/depression and a trauma/stress related disorder (which I’m not sure I have but whatever) so it could be one of those, and I’m too nervous to ask my psychiatrist about it.\n\nSince I don’t want to self diagnose as I’m not sure, I’ve just accepted that I’m definitely neurodivergent, with or without ASD.\n\nSo sometimes I find that I act more neurodivergent than usual. I can usually socially interact well enough to fit into the background, and I think I mask. But sometimes I find that I act “more autistic.” I’ll stop caring about how I walk and I’ll kind of do a weird swingy waddle, I’ll care less about stimming in public, I let myself respond weirdly or not at all to social stuff.\n\nI guess this is unmasking but also I don’t know, because sometimes I can act like I’m masking without trying too hard.\n\nFor example today I let myself walk naturally and when I got on the bus I didn’t force myself to look at the driver and greet them, or make eye contact with the people on the bus. I just waddled on, scanned my thing, and went to a seat in a way that was very obviously socially deficient to those watching.\n\nI guess what makes me doubt that I’m autistic is that I’m aware what I’m doing isn’t normal. I worry that I’m faking or exaggerating autistic symptoms for the benefit of not having to interact with people in public, because they usually leave me alone if I’m acting like this.\n\nIs this just unmasking? Have I just stopped caring about what other people think of me? Am I just faking it when I don’t want to talk to people? Or am I just weird?",

Anecdotes like as a kid being suddenly told it's time to go shopping while you're in the middle of something, or schedule changes as an adult, I don't know, nothing really seems that relatable to me, even though lots of other autistic traits do.\n\nIf anything, I feel like I crave change. I've read about \"highly sensitive people\" and I think that speaks a lot to me, especially the dichotomy between being highly sensitive and high sensation seeking (I think I'm getting the terms wrong here, but basically being easily overwhelmed in sensory categories but desiring novel sensory experiences). At the same time though, I'm at a point in my life where I've basically been stuck inside since 2020, unable to keep a job and having no money so I feel like of course I might now naturally be \"craving\" something different.\n\nCould I perhaps be overlooking something? I know I was a \"difficult child\" and I probably threw some fits regarding change that I don't remember exactly. Or is it not necessarily a hard and fast requirement to being actually autistic?\n\nAny insight would be really helpful, and sorry this has been sort of rambly.",

        "text": "Basically what the title says. My husband and I have been married for 5 yrs, together 8. I have 3 boys that don’t live with me and my husband has one 9 yo. that does. I’ve always thought my whole life I never wanted to be a step parent to anyone, my instincts told me it would be too much for me to handle.  Needless to say, when I first met my husband he never told me had a kid until several dates in and by that time I was already rly interested in him. (Otherwise I never wudve met him.) I’ve mentioned countless times I nvr wanted or could be w someone w a kid. He sometimes wud be hurt by this, mad, but mostly indifferent and shrugs it off.  He would tell me I can’t change i the situation but I can “manage it.” To clarify, I never wanted to be w someone w a kid bc mainly, the baby mamma drama I can’t handle. Everything was fine up until recently, his ex started giving me all this attitude out of nowhere and mailed us papers from her lawyer about custody. Basically my worst nightmare is coming true and I don’t know how to deal with it as I’m currently in a severe state of burnout for yrs and can’t even leave to get a new job! Help! What happens when I mentally and emotionally becomes too much. Not trying to sound like an asshole, but I genuinely can’t help if it’s too much. And my husband gives me zero emotional support and just yells at me. I feel way over my head and trying to live like a NT but it’s catching up to me. I don’t know what to do anymore except wait until I waste away and get sick from depression.",
