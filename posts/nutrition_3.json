I'm not looking for the standard ones you find all over the place, you know the BMI calculators, or the ones that just tell you how many calories you should be eating based on your age/height/weight/gender.  \n\nWhat I'm looking for is one where you can tell it your total number of calories you need in a day, tell it what ratios you want of fat/carbs/protein, and then enter the nutrition label info for the food items you're working with and have it come back with the amounts of each food type you'll need to eat in a day.  Anyone know if something like this exists?  Either it doesn't or I don't know how to word it right to find it using Google.  I do know how to figure it out just using a regular calculator but it can get kind of complicated and I'm not even sure my method is spot-on (I'm sure it's not).\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "I’ve seen a lot of controversy over juicing and I’m unsure about how nutritious it is. I understand you are essentially cutting out fibre, but I get fibre in other meals.\n\nI’ve tried veggies in smoothies and besides spinach and beets, I can hardly stand it. I usually have a quarter of a cup and then can’t drink the rest. I love a good carrotxkalexcelery juice on occasion though. \n\nI don’t juice to lose weight (I know that is common), but rather because I enjoy it and honestly, sometimes I don’t get to all the veggies within due time and juicing helps me put them to use before they go bad. Also, if I’m not getting as many veggies as I’d like in the day, then sometimes I think I can get added nutrients in with a juice.",

From what I have found, it’s an insoluble fiber called “resistant starch” and it acts as a prebiotic and it’s good for your gut.  I’ve seen people say that it has untapped potential(ChocZero thinks so apparently).\n\nI guess my questions are:\n\n- is Resistant Dextrin the same thing as resistant starch or are they different, and why?\n\n- is it really as healthy as everything that I’ve read says it is?  Should we be eating more of it in our diets?\n\n- are there any negatives or reasons to avoid it?\n\nThank you",
