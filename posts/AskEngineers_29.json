I’m just hoping to just dedicate my time studying to ignore my issues and just graduate so I can later focus on my mental health.

Midway through November, 4 of my friends and I have decided to take part in the Formula 1 in Schools challenge. \nTo make it simple, the goal is to engineer a little \"F1 car\" powered by a CO2 cartridge which is supposed to go through a 20m straight line in less than a second. \nTo do so, we are using CAD and CFD to develop the best car possible, as well as analyzing it and seeing how to improve it. \n\nTo make sure that we know what we are doing, we want to learn about the principles of Fluid Dynamics. Though we can already imagine how to somehow improve airflow based on current knowledge, we don’t actually have any scientific knowledge in Fluid Dynamics.\n\n\nWe are currently all taking IB (International Baccalaureate) Physics at Higher Level, which is a course aimed at students planning on studying Engineering at university. The course is notorious for its difficulty and is honestly very intense. If this can give any context, we have recently finished the Mechanics unit, and are currently working on Thermodynamics. We are all hoping to study in top universities in the Netherlands, UK and US, and are more than eager to learn to improve our results in the competition.\n\nTherefore, we were wondering if anybody could inform us on what to learn to become knowledgeable on the subject. We aren’t sure if this concept is difficult to understand, but we are all ready to put in the time and effort to do the best in our little adventure. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this, and potentially inform us on the subject.",

Recently moved into an 80+ year old home, has a mostly finished top floor/attic (with an unfinished crawl space). I’m planning to use one of the two top level finishes rooms as a gym.  Nothing crazy, just a bench press, dumbbells, and treadmill mainly.   Do I need to do any more due diligence to ensure this won’t cause strain on the house structure.  I’m particularly thinking about the impact from the repetitive foot pounding on the treadmill (I bought double shock absorber pads for what that’s worth).  I’ll include pics of the unfinished part of the attic level to perhaps give a clue as to the design.  Also a pic of the gym room.  Lastly a pic from the basement looking up to give a sense for how the structure is designed in lower levels.  Greatly appreciate any thoughts!\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/6ENCTzo",

We were talking about all sorts of things and pay came up, he asked what I was making as I recently accepted a job in the area. The offer given to me was $60,000 and I countered my way up to $62,000, he laughed and said he made $57,000 starting back in 2006 and we live in the same area (so same COL). \n\nDoes this bother anyone else? Unless they got a job in a high cost of living city, I don't know a single friend of mine that got an offer for more than $65,000 starting (all BSME). This degree has been paying 60k starting for 15 years, possibly more. What's the point of getting an engineering degree anymore? The supposed starting salary premium you get for an engineering degree is gone now, business degrees make just as much out of the gate and often have faster career advancement. Why do these degrees anymore? Can older engineers explain? \n\nThe guy I talked to doesn't work as an engineer anymore and claimed crappy pay was a big motivator to get out, but he doesn't really enjoy what he does anymore, so that was a rough way to start the year but it was a serious wake up call for me. I figured in a handful of years I'd be making 6 figures but that doesn't seem possible at all unless I move to a much higher COL location and that kind of negates the whole point of the higher salary.",

These explosions cause pistons to turn the crank.\n\nIn industrial applications we have a 3 phases of sine waves directly turning the amerature via coils/magnetic field.\n\nIn terms of barrels of oil per workload produced, or gallons of water required to produce said work load, it seems to me the electric motor would cut out a lot of extra moving parts (like pistons and crankshafts/cams/valves &amp; lifters), since magnetic fields turn the shaft directly, and aside from slip, seems to be a much more direct, quick, simple, and easy process.\n\nCan anyone speak on this? \n\nJust a mechanic/automation guy.

        "text": "Long story short, the previous owner of my home dropped a reasonably sized brick (my guess being 2\"x8\"x2\") down the chimney, where it fell in the space between the flue and the flue opening. The flue will no longer open because of this brick.  \n\nLogistics:   \n\n1. It's about 15 feet down from the entrance to the flue. \n2. At the bottom of the chimney before the flue, there is a down slope (where the brick is located) making it hard to claw grab from the top without it bending at an angle and moving forward. \n3. You can't go from under to remove it because there are 3 vents that direct heat back into the room in the way. \n4. You can't cut into the brick and remove it because it will destroy the flue tile/chimney lining, which is apparently a nightmare to replace, as well as cut through the above mentioned vents. \n5. Any controlled explosive (yes, we explored this option) would cause the same problems as we have in #4.  \n6. I have tried to break the brick apart by smashing it with what little leverage we can get from the flue opening and closing, but that has appeared to have zero effect on the structurally integrity of this god brick. \n7. So far, the only viable option that has been offered by a chimney service, besides brick/flue smash, is to cut the bolts holding the flue out, which would cause the entire piece to drop out, requiring an install of a new one at the top of the chimney, which I would prefer to avoid for cost and ease of access. \n\nI have been processing and scheming on this problem for near 3 years now, and I genuinely cannot figure out what else to do. I can provide pictures to the best of my ability, but no guarantees they're going to be entirely useful, as the majority of this problem is located in an area I can't really see from any angle.",

I assume it CAN be heat treated, but with some loss/alteration of properties. But what specifically happens? Why can't some steels be heat treated?",

        "text": "Kind of tough to frame, I guess.  Let's say we have a constant air flow, non-circulating outside air, we need to heat up to x degrees regardless of the incoming air temp.  The greater the difference between the target temp and the actual temp, the heaver the load and more energy needed to heat it up, obviously... But is this relationship linear?  In other words, if I need to increase the target temp by 5%, is it a 5% increase in energy and therefore cost, or is it some non-linear thing because of the bulk airflow?\n\nI feel like Carnot had something to say about this...",
