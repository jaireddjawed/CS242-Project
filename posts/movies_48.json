I often listen to movie scores on my long commutes and most recently was listening to the remastered soundtrack for T2. Apart from the theme, it made me realize just how different the score gets throughout the movie. Nothing feels repetitive like a lot of action movies tend to do. You usually hear the same theme throughout. Also just love the sound, it clearly came from the 80s but with that new tech the 90s was bringing to make the sounds more modern. \n\nTerminator 2 arguably would have been just as good with another score, but I cant imagine it that way. Same with the score for Inception, the music is just as much a part of the story. \n\nAre there some films you feel would actually be worse without the score they had?",

        "text": "#**TEN YEARS OF OSCAR BINGO**\n\nWow, to think it was ten years ago that I got really stoned and pitched this ridiculous idea to the other mods to which they enthusiastically replied, \"sure, man, whatever.\" And with that the largest online oscar-based Bingo game was born. You know, [they say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.](https://drafthouse.com/news/wed-like-to-thank-the-academy?utm_campaign=NAT_2023-02-27_awards_season&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=dedicated)\n\nOkay, let's get in to it!\n\n* [Last year's submission thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/tgjp1l/official_oscar_bingo_submission_thread_2022/)\n* [Last year's card pickup thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/tnx35f/official_oscar_bingo_2022_card_pickup_thread_come/)\n* [Last year's game thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/tpwcq7/oscar_bingo_game_thread_2022/)\n* [List of nominees for this year](https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2023)\n\nHere's how it works!\n\n* Submit ideas for things that might happen during the Oscars. **Oscars only, no preshow**. Example: \"Someone mispronounces Saoirse Ronan\" or \"Daniel Day-Lewis doesn't laugh at a joke made about him.\" Keep it light and let's keep things like \"Don't Look Up wins Best Picture\" off the gamecards, it limits possibilities.\n\n*The mods reserve the right to execute editorial control over the final bingo squares. Our intent is to make the game more playable based on previous year's experience.*\n\n* Once we have collected submissions for a couple of days, we will un-sticky the thread and start to make game cards with your suggestions. Our friends over at **print-bingo.com** will again be doing some specialty work with us for this.  Please only take what you need so everyone can play, but take as many as you need!\n\n* We will post a gamecard pickup thread the Friday before the Oscars (the 10th). All you will have to do is follow the link in the thread, do the captcha, and save the PDF file with your card on it. \n\n* We'll post the game thread Oscar Sunday. The point of the Game Thread is to discuss game related things and for me to make final decisions on the more open to interpretation squares. It will be stickied and there will be prizes for winners.  \n\n\n---\n\nHost:\n\n- Jimmy Kimmel\n\nHere is a list of presenters:\n\n* Riz Ahmed (Won an Oscar last year for Best Short – Live-Action for \"The Long Goodbye\")\n* Emily Blunt\n* Glenn Close\n* Jennifer Connelly\n* Ariana DeBose (Last year's Best Supporting Actress winner for \"West Side Story\")\n* Samuel L. Jackson\n* Dwayne Johnson\n* Michael B. Jordan\n* Troy Kotsur (Last year's Best Supporting Actor winner for \"CODA\")\n* Jonathan Majors\n* Melissa McCarthy\n* Janelle Monáe\n* Deepika Padukone\n* Questlove (Won an Oscar last year for Best Documentary Feature for \"Summer of Soul…\")\n* Zoe Saldaña\n* Donnie Yen\n\n\n**Here's some \"official\" rules:**\n\n* Submissions must be 80 characters or less. They gotta fit in them bingo squares!\n* As mentioned, don't submit anything impossible or too ridiculous. Hyperbole is no one's friend in bingo.\n* **We will be taking the top submissions, so be sure to vote on your favorites!** The thread will be randomized so take a moment to scroll or reload and find your favorites!\n* Try not to get too specific. The fun of Bingo is that a square could happen any moment. Predicting winners or getting too specific limits the fun!\n* You can submit about anything that might happen at the Oscars, but not the preshow. Nobody wants the game to be over before it begins!\n* Have fun!\n\n***SUBMIT YOUR OSCAR SQUARE ENTRIES BELOW***\n\n80 characters or less and don't forget to vote!",

He gets sent away to fine a new home in London where he meets a kind family who take him in. The dad doesn’t approve though, since Paddington gets into all kinds of wacky shenanigans™️, but the dad eventuality learns to love and accept him and whatever. \n\nThis is a pretty common storyline in family films, where the family takes in a pet/weird alien or magical creature/funny little guy and gets into all kinds of slapstick hi-jinx. With one family member (usually the dad) hating the creature but eventually developing a soft spot and accepting it into the family. With any other director/creative team, Paddington could’ve easily been a dumb, pandering movie with cheap gross out humour and lazy slapstick that only used the Padding Bear IP as a way to capitalise on British baby boomer nostalgia. But what we got instead was a heartwarming and fun movie with likeable and memorable characters, witty humour, fun and timeless slapstick sequences, a really well done and wholesome message about being kind and accepting to those that are different, and an overall clear fondness and respect for the original Paddington books.\n\nAnyway, are there other examples of good movies like this within a specific micro genre or story trope that usually kinda suck? Feel free to gimme some recommendations!",

        "text": "Revisited Gone Baby Gone last night after not seeing it since it came out in 2007 and a few aspects struck me. \n\n- This is possibly one of the most assured directorial debuts in recent memory. Affleck knows exactly what he wants out of every shot and nails the setting of a working class Boston neighborhood. \n\n- I read a review that said this did to Boston what Deliverance did to the rural South. While this might be a bit of an over exaggeration, the point has truth in it. Some of the characters in the film are rather grotesque sociopaths that could easily be found as a villain in a horror movie. The scene in which Casey Affleck’s character finds the murdered boy in the bath tub is more disturbing and visceral than most of what is considered horror these days. \n\n- Lastly, the strongest aspect of the film is it’s moral ambiguity. When a movie can make you question your own morals and force yourself to be put in an impossible situation, I applaud the filmmakers for not letting the audience off easy.",

Somerset tried to speak &gt;!Mills out of exacting vengeance on JD!&lt;, since JD embodies the sin of Enby, saying that would only prove him right and complete his plans. But for the plan to be completed, the embodiment of Wrath, would also have to killed, which he wasn't and I doubt he will receive the death sentence. \n\nI don't know if I'm missing something or what-not, I'm a bit sleepy.

Felt like Infernal Affairs [The Departed] meets Heat meet Munich. Loved the action sequences, the characters and cinematography.\n\nThe story at times was difficult to follow but was still really into the plot. Haven't seen much discussion about this film anywhere. \n\nWhat did people think of it? What did you make of the ending?",

What films would be made funnier/better/interesting, if an actor was playing on of their other characters?\n\nOne I thought of today would be if Pierce Brosnan was playing James Bond in Mrs. Doubtfire. He’d easily work out the scam from his new lovers’ ex-husband, but after his enemies track him down and kidnap his stepchildren, he must team up with Robin Williams and his brother in order to don a disguise himself.",

        "text": "The ending seemed just a teensy far-fetched for my taste (not going to post any spoilers), but overall that movie earned a B+ in my book. In spite of all the controversy now with Kevin Spacey, he's still a damn good actor, as well as Samuel L. Jackson. Their back-and-forth combined with the elusive third party and trigger happy SWAT Commander played by David Morse had me in legitimate wonder about how the movie was going to end.\n\nThere was also more attention to detail than your average cop movie, which is usually action first then plot. This movie actually appears to have done more research into police and legal procedure, though there are still some notable creative licenses made.\n\nWould recommend watching at least once. The acting made the movie more convincing and helped it avoid becoming a meme. The writing was better caliber than the average action flick.\n\nAlso has that classic 90s feel where even though it's a thriller, it still has a certain \"family movie\" feel to it (aside from the language).\n\nI enjoyed that movie. Not necessarily an Inception or Inglorious Basterds-type experience, but it's the kind of movie I'd revisit probably once a year or so. Think \"cabin trip\" movie when there's some spare time.\n\nAlso, still putting the spoiler tag in case someone spoils it in the comments.",
