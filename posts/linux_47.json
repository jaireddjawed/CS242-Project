I was inspired by `nushell`.\n* Full flexibility in choosing which columns / information to show.\n* Support correct handling of CJK and other wide or invisible Unicode characters in tabular format.\n* Better default sorting (by basename then extension) and 8 custom sorting methods (more than ls, although lacking a few of ls sorting methods).\n* Support several formats for time and file sizes, along with custom Unix's time format and Go's time format.\n* High compatibility with ls command's flags.\n* Ability to customize colors with an environment variable.",

        "text": "First time poster here, long time Linux user. \n\nSo I've always wanted a Linux tablet. So I got one. It's a generic rebranded tablet called a RuggedPC Rugged82. Its similar to the Vanquisher 8in on Amazon. The tablet I got came from old warehouse surplus. \n\nI'd like to share my journey on this project. So buckle up. \n\nFirst of all, I could get only 2 distros to boot on it. I'm still old school so the new art of EFI boot files... If it was up to me, lilo and the MBR would still be around as the standard, but we aren't in the 90s anymore.  So maybe this part was my struggle. Either way the two distros were antiX and MX Linux and handled configuring the efi boot perfectly. \n\nantiX is a fine distro for old systems. Far better than any \"light distro\" on the net today. \"Light distros\" are not light anymore. They aren't built to support low resources on older hardware past 7 years old or so. \n\nMX is a clean version of antiX. I prefer MX over antiX any day for out of box operation. Everything worked nearly out of box on every system Ive installed this on. Including an ancient netbook mini. \n\nThis Rugged82 tablet however is a very fine machine. With a quadcore Atom Z3735F, this tablet is fast. Since I dont allow Windows in my home for \"religious\" and \"political\" reasons, the day I brought this tablet home began my journey on finally acquiring an elusive linux tablet.\n\nThere were a few issues with this tablet as expected. First up was the cameras. Both forward and back cameras do not work. I have tried several methods but there is zero detection. I have yet figured it out. \n\ninit -Fxz, lsuab, lspci, lspcmcia, and dmesg doesnt show anything. Even loading uvcvideo module doesnt work. If anyone has a suggestion, I'm all ears. If not, I dont really care if the cameras dont work. \n\nSecond major issue was the orientation sensor. You'd think if you tilted the tablet, autorotation would set the screen in landscape. Wrong. No sensor is detected but I'm cool with it. I just madean launcher on the xfce panel with a toggle script using xrandr and xinput to handle things. \n\nI'll spare the details on the scripting I used for screen rotation. This project was very intimate for me. I had to figure out xinputs float type Coordinate Transformation Matrix. I used \"0 1 0 -1 0 1 0 0\" for landscape and all zeros for \"normal\". \n\nAnother major hassle waa figuring out how to turn off the screen. The power button didn't do anything so I had to write a simple script to turn off what I could usingxsert -display. The screen goes blank but the backlight will never turn off. I haven't been able to find out how to kill power to the screen. No big deal. Turning it black works. \n\nA few tweaks I learned the hard way are simple fixes to turn commands on startup or triggered some other fashion. \n\nFirst is the brightness. If you set the screen too dim, you won't be able to see to turn it back up. So setting the brightness back to 100% is done by adding that command in the script I bound to the power button to toggle the screen. \n\nThe most important tweak is automatically enabling the touch screen but usingxfconf-querty -c pointer. I was in Bermuda when I accidentally bricked my tablet at the worst possible time.... More on the true function of this tablet. So now I restart and it ensures the touch screen is enabled. \n\nA few more tweaks are to enable tablet mode on Firefox. Thia allows you to scroll with one fingure like you do on a traditional tablet. \n\nThings to install. Onboard - the best floating keyboard. It works really well and is highly customizable. Another required tool is Touch√©gg, which is touch gestures which enable touch gestures for a more tablet feel. Plug you need it to right click. \n\nNext up is conky. We all know what conky is. Well this tablet has an incredible GPS receiver. I spent countless hours tweaking gpspipe scripts to display all possible GPS info for conky.\n\nSo the best use for this tablet. Viking mapping and Navit programs make this tablet a great offline complete GPS map. Only catch is you gotta preload the map files accordingly. Very legit use of a tablet. So Bermuda... I planned to explore Bermuda on foot knowing I would have no internet access or cell service. Night before we docked, I was tinkering with FreeCAD on the tablet and waa trouble shooting a touchpad issue which lead me to disable the touchpad by accident. With no USB mouse or keyboard, ooooops! So yeah, I had to find paper maps and ask directions and transit routes. \n\nI also configured this tablet to be a platform for ham radio use in the field. Fldigi and wsjtx. Yeet! Perfect companion for a Lab599 Discovery rig. I absolutely LOVE this tablet. \n\nAnother major con is the storage space. Its limited to 32GB internal and I think 32GB SD card expansion. Plenty of space if you aren't planning to add games, movies, and music. Battle of Wesnoth is still pretty legit on this thing. \n\nBluetooth seems to work well however ive been having trouble with my Bluetooth headphones playing sound correctly. Still working that...\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/rEaAQqP.jpg\n\nIn my setup Ive also added a xkill launcher just in case... Well the link above shows a glimps of my setup. \n\nI did a lot of fine tuning and this tablet has treated me well in the past year. Fantastic machine. \n\nIf anyone also didn't know about a better phone option, I HIGHLY recommend GrapheneOS on a Google Pixel. Ive been rocking a de-googled Pixel 4a since they were new. Best phone Ive had. Solid and secure. \n\nAny comments, critiques, or suggestions... I'd love to hear them.",

And obviously, I still didn't write a bash script to auto-mount the luks partition because I'm too lazy to rtfm, and frankly I'm of the opinion that this should be an option somewhere (\"remember password forever\" does nothing because you are forced to use the keyring anyway).\n\nSo as I was manually typing the decryption password every time I wanted to go to the second HDD, the computer kept pestering me about some keychain or whatever. On Chromium, it at least used to stop after you told it to frick off like 20 times, but this one never did (nor does it on Chromium anymore.. sigh..).\n\nAnyway, I never dove deep into it and it was absolutely logical to me that a keyring was something useful. And what would be useful but a fully functioning automounting with password pre-saved and encrypted. Frankly I thought that the keychain was the encryption key for the password, and that the computer uses it so it isn't stored in plaintext.\n\nSo long story short, I still have to manually type the password, just not my decryption password, but the keychain password. How utterly useless. Replacing one password with another. What is the purpose of this? Who wants this? Why am I being pestered about this every singe time, and how the heck do I revert it or change the keyring password?\n\nIn short, if linux is about freedom, then NO means NO whne I tell you to buzz off for the 54th time you ask me if I want a keychain.

        "text": "^(Obligatory: Barely an inconvenience.)\n\nYou just need to tell Flatpak apps where to look for it:\n\n1. Set a couple overrides to expose the GTK and QT configurations in `~/.config`.\n2. For GTK, find and install the GTK themes as Flatpaks from Flathub.\n3. For QT, install every ` org.kde.KStyle.Kvantum` Flatpak package. (Different apps may use different runtimes, so just grab all the versions.)\n4. For QT, also copy the QT themes from `/usr` to `~/.config` if they aren't already there.\n\nThis assumes that your system is already set up to use Kvantum in QT5CT/System Settings/Whatever‚Äî I recommend that anyway as it's worked pretty well for me.\n\nSo after doing this, the global system state should be something like below:\n\n```\n    $ cat /var/lib/flatpak/overrides/global\n    [Context]\n    filesystems=xdg-config/gtk-4.0:ro;xdg-config/gtk-2.0:ro;/usr/share/Kvantum:ro;xdg-config/gtkrc-2.0:ro;xdg-config/gtkrc:ro;xdg-config/gtk-3.0:ro;xdg-config/qt5ct:ro;/usr/share/qt5ct:ro;xdg-config/Kvantum:ro;\n    # I don't think the /usr overrides actually work, but let's leave them here as a reminder to copy from /usr/share/Kvantum to .config/share/Kvantum.\n```\n\n```\n    $ flatpak list | grep -i theme\n    Breeze GTK theme        org.gtk.Gtk3theme.Breeze        5.26.3  3.22    system\n    Matcha-aliz GTK theme   org.gtk.Gtk3theme.Matcha-aliz   2021-12-25      3.22    system\n    Matcha-dark-aliz GTK theme      org.gtk.Gtk3theme.Matcha-dark-aliz      2021-12-25      3.22    system\n    Matcha-light-aliz GTK theme     org.gtk.Gtk3theme.Matcha-light-aliz     2021-12-25      3.22    system\n    Adwaita theme   org.kde.KStyle.Adwaita          5.15-21.08      system\n    Kvantum theme engine    org.kde.KStyle.Kvantum  1.0.0   5.15    system\n    Kvantum theme engine    org.kde.KStyle.Kvantum  1.0.6   5.15-21.08      system\n    Kvantum theme engine    org.kde.KStyle.Kvantum  1.0.6   5.15-22.08      system\n```\n\n(Code formatting may be broken on the old Reddit frontend.)\n\n---\n\nThis has been posted about before, but never in one place AFAIK, and there's a lot of conflicting information out there (primarily more temporary approaches that require manual setup for every Flatpak app on every theme change).\n\nQT: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/psit31/flatpak_now_supports_qt_theming_with_kvantum/\n\nGTK: https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/ujqih9/plasma_consistent_flatpak_theming/",

And of course it went past the starting page. After I took the url of the document management page, switched my user agent back and went to that url. It took me back to the starting page \n\n\nThis means the code of google docs is set to deny service to anyone not using chromium by a perceived ‚Äúglitch‚Äù and if the glitch was not intentional. It would be found and patched by the trillion dollar corporation of google. \n\nI must conclude this is an intentional obstruction of utility to push a product made by google \n\nGoogle images dose ‚Äúfunction‚Äù but it‚Äôs UI changes to a half working, barely functional system \n\n\nI am getting rid of Google products in my life soon.
