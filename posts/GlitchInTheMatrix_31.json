        "text": "So after Lost ended I was looking for any stuff related to the show, and after maybe a year I read on the internet that the creators of Lost made a new show. So I looked it up, watched the pilot (there were disappearings, camera shots of a highway, city from the bridge, and then some guys were in an office building, trying to find the reason behind this). I remember it wasn't that good, and there were articles that it was cancelled after 1 episode/season (I'm not sure). Can anyone help me here? I haven't watched the REAL The Leftovers pilot, I just learned about the show's existence and I don't know what to think about it.\n\nEDIT: I wrote this post just a couple of minutes after discovering The Leftovers. Yes, it was FLASH FORWARD. Now it comes back to me ;) Probably what happens to many people here - the brain makes some wrong connections and it goes from there. Thank you for correcting me!",

        "text": "This is all conjecture.  I will start out with that, and say that the reason I am posting this is mostly out of curiosity to see how many others may have come to the same conclusions. \n\nBut what I am suggesting is going to be a bit sad for us, So if you are into happier ideas of possibly escaping the \"matrix\" or some big upload when you die or other \"happier\" endings within the system. You probably want to stop reading now. \n\nOne of the great problems I have had with the \"simulation\" has been not so much some of the things witnessed here on this sub, or any of the other forums out there where events seem easily dismissed as dreams or errors in memory. I can agree that the probability is low that any of these \"glitches \" are real.  some portion are made up BS , some are genuine errors and lapses of memory. \n\nI won't get into the reasons why I suspect we are in a simulation. Only that certain things happen in a way for me that are, and being as an observant user of the scientific method, statistically anomalous to the point of ridiculousness. \n\nIf I accept that indeed we are in a simulation I have to ask some hard ETHICAL questions about it where it comes to suffering within it. And I mean real suffering in the sense of a child in agony with cancer. Or famine , or Ebola. \n\nIs the suffering any less if it is suffered by an AI (us) than a real flesh and blood creature?. One could hope that much like our culture over the centuries we have slowly gotten better where it concerns what is moral And so have they.  (not talking the middle east here however) \n\nEnlightened cultures and secular belief systems has slowly removed the barriers, stigmas and ideologies that have been detrimental to the happiness and reduction of human suffering. we are better now morally than we were a few hundred years ago.   \n\nThats us.. 2015 on verge of 2016. But where will we be in another two hundred , or a thousand years from now. will we continue to get better? \n\n As it stands right now for myself  .. Now, had we the technology I could not and would not for any supposed run an \"ancestor simulation\" make it so AI's that could feel pain and know the kinds of absolute suffering we know in this one. I don't think I could allow the torture of sentient or non sentient creatures, no matter what the  value of the data was.  \n\nSadly I have the presupposition that that these advanced humans or creatures that created the simulation, Could even comprehend that it would be wrong to inflict suffering on an non organic or \"less real\" creations.  Perhaps humanity has become the Borg?  \n\nThis is the crux of the issue. Either the creator(s) of the simulation Knowingly do not care ( which is bad for us )  Do not care because they have no concept of a higher morality (which is worse)  Or that they know... something else.. and this is where it gets abit sad. \n\nI think we are AI's set in this universe as per our memories to live and grow,  and then those  memories uploaded live to those who want to live and suffer as people did 10,000 years ago before the singularity. They know there is no way.. out , for us.  except for our uploaded memories. \n\nThey could justify our suffering as part of living a harsher , colder existence. That they are somehow nobly remembering every suffering moments of humanities climb from the blood, mud  and tears.\n\nWe could  well could be copies of individuals presently living. that they would upload the events of our existence as a strange \"second life\" that becomes part of them. \n\nPerhaps they need reminders how lucky they have it with their eternal lives as they spread out across the known universe. They get to experience the joy as well. But ultimately we .. you and I are stuck.. stuck here till the end run of our program.\n\nIt's not a happy ending. But if I have guessed right about our reasons here. That we ultimately are just pushing memories and dreams onto the intergalactic web. Well. I have a few things to say to the creators about morality of such decision.  \n\nJust my take on it YMMV ",

It is what unlocks the doors at work and allows me to enter the parts of the building I need to access. ( I just work for the county, nothing exciting) \n\nAnyways, so I pull in the parking lot, and I am tearing apart my purse, my car, and no name badge. So, I have a co-worker let me in and I just figured i left it at home on the table by the door. \n\nSo I started thinking about it.  Friday when I got home, I took it off my neck and put it in my purse. I knew I was off for the weekend and I didn't want to lose it. My purse is huge, so it wasn't going to fall out. It was underneath my wallet, first aid kit, and a few other random junk items. When I went home, I searched my car again, my coats, my other purses, where I hang my keys, my laundry baskets, my coat rack, the couch, like..... EVERY WHERE.\n\nSo, I just emailed HR and got another one made. I was so confused. It had vanished. It is on a long lanyard with a card inside of a plastic pouch. It's not like it was small and I would miss it. \n\nLike I said before this was a few weeks ago. Well, last night I was hanging up my coats and they all fell down after I walked away.(they are on a peg coat rack that hangs from the wall) I went back later to pick them up and hanging on the peg is my name tag. I LOOKED THERE 50 times!! \n\nMy mom calls them \"gremlins\". They take things into another universe for a while and then eventually bring them back. I have dozens of these stories. As mom would say \"damn gremlins! give it back!\"\n",

And then all of a sudden a wave overtakes me and I'm underwater for a really long time. It felt like I was in a cocoon-like state and I wasn't gasping for air or anything. Since I was a kid it's kind of hard to remember how long it seemed like, I just remember it feeling like a lifetime. It obviously wasn't a lifetime, but it felt like that. And, similarly, it felt as if time and space had quit since it didn't even feel like I was underwater. I also felt a weird presence of someone else being there and communicating with me in some way.\n\nWhen it was over, I went to the shore to tell my step-dad, but he obviously didn't believe me. I probably just sounded like some random kid babbling nonsense. I knew he wouldn't believe me, but I had to tell at least one other person.\n\nWell, that's my story and you can take it or leave it.

        "text": "When I was in my younger years, probably about 13 or 14 (around the time World of Warcraft first came out, which consumed my early teens), I spent pretty much all of my time on the computer. The only computer in the house was the one my dad and I built together, which resided in his office.\n\nThe office was an extension built onto the original house, when I was still in diapers. My father had just landed a job as a field engineer for a medical company, one he still holds today, over 25 years later. The office is *only* accessible through my parents room, so to get there you had to go upstairs, push open the door to their room, then pull open the door to the office. It was arranged, for whatever reason, that both doors opened into the bedroom. \n\nMy brother was in a band at this time. They were somewhat decent considering they were 16-17, and only one of them actually had musical training (my brother, the percussionist.) Being the budding graphic designer I was (I now make a living as a Web developer), his band asked me to make some promotional materials for them playing at some coffee shop. I gladly agreed, as it gave me a chance to use my talents and be a part of the cool kids.\n\nMy mother's digital camera was clunky and took photos that would be put to shame by most modern camera phones, but it worked for what I needed it to do. I asked the group to stand up against the wall of the office, as it was the biggest room in the house, and I took a photo of them looking moody. I relieved the band and resigned to the computer to crank the contrast and add some illegible font. When I opened it and got to work, I noticed...something.\n\nThe door to the office was opening into it. If you recall, this was the opposite of what it actually did. The door had moulding and was quite heavy, so swapping the way it swings would be a heavy task. I tried to explain it every way I could, manipulating the photo to uncover the optical illusion, but there was no way. The shot was at an angle such that the door covered part of the wall, which it could never do.\n\nI never could explain it, and to this day, I never showed it to anyone. I don't know why I didn't. I think of it often, as the only truly unexplainable thing that's ever happened in my life, and use it as a daily reminder that logic and science, and by extension myself, cannot explain everything in this world, and I think twice before dismissing others stories of the supernatural.",

In the film, Winston quit the Ghostbusters, leaving the guys to question what they were doing, if they were able to keep up their Ghostbusting career. Further more, A friend and I had conversations about the film while in school. Both of us discussing a scene near the beginning of the film where the Ghostbusters were firing their proton blasters at a ghost in a large basement building. The ghost escaped out of a window. I haven't spoken to this old schoolmate in many years because of life leading us in different directions but we both discussed this film amongst several classmates. It's something that has always puzzled me. I've considered every possible explanation. It wasn't a dream, we spoke about the film a couple of years later and he was still convinced of it's existence. I'm a rational man. I just don't get it. Has anybody else seen this \"imaginary\" third Ghostbusters film?? If I was alone in seeing it, it would be easier to dismiss. ",

The links on this chain are all soldered.  I wired each end of the stone-wire to one &amp; the other end of 1 piece of chain, like a solid loop.  I always save the clasps for after a piece is bought, so that if the buyer wants a different length i didn't waste my time. Which doesn't really apply in this case but it's just what i always do &amp; i'm lazy/would rather be making the fun parts than boring old clasps. So this thing is a solid loop, choker-length (too small to go over my head by a long shot), with no openings in the loop. \n\nWell I just ran to the store to grab some beer and decided i'd wear it. I just clipped the chain in the center &amp; threw a twist of wire through it as a makeshift temporary \"clasp\". I was not at all particular - i have long hair that covers it in the back so it was literally just a big twist of scrap copper wire i threw on there to hold it for a few minutes.  And i clearly remember doing it.\n\nWell now i'm back home and trying to take it off to photograph it for etsy and i'll be damned if that twist of wire is gone.  it's really close to my own face and at a weird angle so i can;t really get at it well but i've been over &amp; over &amp; over the whole length of chain with my eyes, by hand, in the mirror.... and i just can't find it!  There is no twist of copper wire.  There is not any cut in the chain.  It's like it's magically turned back into a solid loop again.  And as i said, this thing won't fit over my head.\n\nI keep looking and it's just NOT THERE.  I feel like i'm going crazy or losing my mind.  It's not a big deal, just a silly necklace and i could just cut it (again?) to get it off without causing a problem but....  i mean just holy crap, what the hell is going on??\n\n",

        "text": "So this is a pretty small glitch but one that tripped me out this morning.\n\n3 weeks ago my right window wiper fell off in a bad rainstorm. The metal hook that the wiper attaches to was scratching my windshield and making an awful nails on a chalkboard noise.\n\nTo temporarily solve the problem, I wrapped blue painters tape around the hook quite a few times. The wiper just slid across the windshield using the tape as a buffer.\n\nNow last night I picked up my friend who hasn't been back from college for quite some time. He asked about the arcing scrape on my windshield and I explained and put the wipers on. Immediately the scraping noise starts and I look and notice that the tape isn't on there anymore. I figured it just fell off and thought nothing of it.\n\nThis morning, I'm driving to work and I turn the wipers on to get rid of some morning dew and the scraping noise isn't there. I look and see that the blue tape is wrapped around the hook again. Now, I know for a fact that I didn't do it. My friend didn't do it. And I called him this morning to re confirm that there was no tape and it was scraping the windshield last night when I showed him and he definitely agreed. \n\nI don't even know where I put the blue tape roll that I used. I immediately thought of this sub and thought I would share.",

I also have an indescribable relationship with another girl - nothing like you'd imagine, but we have a connection that seems impossible. Our humour is perfectly sat on the complimentary side of near-identical, we have very similar upbringings although she is six years younger - the relative ages at which we encounter things are the same, generally. It's as if we both walk the same path everywhere we go.\n\nA few weeks ago, I sent her a facebook message at 7am, a little early for me but I couldn't sleep - just saying \"I'm so cold\". I was physically freezing at the time, but a lot of things bearing down on me and casual diazepine use has recently left me \" cold\", \"numb\". These three words seemed to have more to them than their face value.\n\nShe replied, asking if I was OK, which was weird as I thought she'd say \"turn the fucking heating up then\" or \"stop being such a fairy\". I was a little anxious to converse so I let the conversation lie for a couple hours.\n\nSince then, twice or three times a week she will wake up at 7am to a notification on her phone - \"ConvictedRappist: I'm so cold.\"\nBut when she unlocks her phone it's gone. We've tried experimenting with deleting messages to prove I'm not pranking her and sending similar messages at the same time in the morning to see if it's a bug.\n\nI've just found it funny that those three words had such depth of meaning, and they seem to recur spontaneously.\nI'd prefer to forget how cold I am",

        "text": "This happened during my childhood, but I remember it well -- as do the several other individuals who accompanied me. The group of us were walking through the familiar confines of our neighborhood's woods, and we somehow managed to get lost. We walked around in circles for at least an hour, quite baffled that we *could* get lost in an area that we all knew fairly well.  \n\nEventually, we found a clearing which took us out of the woods toward a house, but neither I nor any of my companions had ever seen this house. \"Who's house is that?\" we all asked ourselves. I did not have an answer to that question, and neither did any of those with me.  \n\nWe stood there for a moment in wonder at this puzzling spectacle. I began to think about some science fiction television shows about alternate realities that I'd seen, and my wonder gave way to a small bit of fear. A little voice in my head was telling me to turn back without delay. Fortunately, this is what the group of us agreed to do. This happened in a rural part of Southeastern US, a place which is renowned for its many gun owners who do not like intruders. For albeit different reasons, all involved parties agreed that it was best not to see what this house had in store for us.\n\nThe trip back was extremely disorienting. I began to get dizzy from all of the trips around the woods. I can't tell you exactly *how* we got back to the part of the woods we were familiar with, but we did. It doesn't make a lot of sense. It's like we came down this slope from the unknown house, walked around in circles for a bit, and then came back up what definitely *seemed* like the same hill. Except this time, that hill led us to my house! \n\nI've tried to locate that house many times. Due in large part to this experience, I've gained a pretty close complete understanding of how those woods are mapped out. It's not there, and it can't be there. There doesn't seem to be any place for it to exist.\n\nAm I alone in this, or have any of you gentlefolk ever had a similar experience?",

The second dream, is that they would get lost within the walls and that there are several hidden passageways and they couldn't find their way back out.  Now, they were the first to dream that. But now, my mom, my aunt, my uncle, my grandfather, all the grandkids (including me) and my other great aunt have all had both those dreams as well. It seems like anyone who has been in the house gets these dreams. Why? ",

Only there was a guy sitting across from me when we left the terminal initially, and when I came to, he was gone. The bus couldn't have made any stops and I didn't see him anywhere else, so where did he go?\n\nSorry if I didn't word this well, it was just very confusing to me and I still can't account for why the bus did a short nine-minute loop while I was sleeping.",

I'm a fan of glitch in the matrix stories and thought I would share mine.\n\nI've lived in the same neighborhood for about 20 plus years and have always shopped at the same large chain grocery store down the street from where I live. I even worked there for a couple of years. This will make sense later, but at no time within this 20 plus years have I ever noticed a security guard working at the store. \n\nOne day, like routine, I go to my grocery store late at night after work, get all of my items and proceed to check out. The store is usually empty late at night so I remember it being odd that there was someone just hanging out by the exit in uniform. After checking out and approaching the exit I look at the person standing there. He's definitely one of those security guards that post up by the exit as a deterrence from people trying to steal shit and whatnot. I recognize him, it's one of my best friends that I grew up with. Someone I've known since early teenage years to my mid 20's, but we had been in limited contact lately due to various circumstances. As I got close he said to me, \"Have a good night\" and nodded. I was confused as hell, there's no way he would not recognize me or at least say something. I remember making eye contact and confirming without a doubt that this was my friend that I've known for a long time. I barely got out a \"good night\" and continued walking but my mind was racing. As I exited the store I had this urge to turn around, but there was this dreadful and overwhelming feeling that I shouldn't do that. It bothered me the drive home and the rest of the night. \n\nThe next day I decided to text him, \"Hey by any chance are you working security at 'chain store' grocery?\". He replied, \"No man, I'm working at 'restaurant' as a cook, why what's up?\".   \n\nI could have overlooked the security guard anomaly since there might have been something going on that night, but the fact that the guard was some doppelganger/ alternate reality version of my best friend is what disturbed me most.  \n",

I heard her mother in the background and had a very urgent desire to say hi to her mom and to tell her I loved her, but I didnt. That night, I dreamed her mom was covered in blood. The next morning at school, my friend walked up to our group of friends and she was crying. Her mother had died in her sleep, and her grandfather (who was my friend's guardian) insisted she still go to school. Naturally, I freaked out but never told her. A couple days later, my mom told me the details of her death. She had bled out from some mix up with medications, essentially. I then told my mom about the dream because of how guilty I felt.\n\nCouple years later, I woke up in the middle of the night and knew my hamster had died. I ran downstairs, and sure enough she was dead for no apparent reason. This also happened a couple years later with a guinea pig. I had come home from work and was terrified to go in my room to check on him. My stepfather came down the stairs and said \"you might wanna..\" and I knew before he finished his sentence that he was telling me my guinea pig died.",

When we were talking and my other friend (C) brought up paychecks and how much we made. When I turn around I said \"the only job I have is still in the cafeteria\". So at this point I'm really distracted doing some other thing. \"Well now it's not $50 like last year, they're up to $100\". Without realizing it I started remembering the dream. Again \"man I remember my checks came out to $30 $30\" suddenly I found myself saying \"well that's cause you're always absent brotha\" \nI just sat there in disbelief knowing I had dreamt this moment months before.

One time I was dreaming then suddenly there was an unnatural feeling cut in the dream to where I found myself on a type of bed then looked over and was surprised to see that I was having an IV drip fitted and being sedated for surgery. Then I woke up, walked out of the bedroom and the phone rang. It was the hospital saying that somebody had cancelled last minute and I could go in for surgery next week.\n\nAnother time I dreamed one of my friends I hadn't seen in a while was in my living room. About 5 minutes later after I had got up I heard a knock on the front door and it was him. It was really fucking weird.\n\nThe period when this used to happen it was so consistent that I would feel completely confident in who was about to ring or visit my house that day, or if I woke up and the phone rang shortly after I would know who it would be. The people would seem out of place even in a dream state. Like family members I very rarely see or speak to etc. It wasn't even like, getting it right once every few weeks, it was very consistent and it wasn't like I waited until the person showed up IRL to validate it, I would already have in my head who was calling or knocking on my door before I answered.\n\nHasn't happened in a long time.

More direct, more like something I can think of. And I feel like it's been lasting a little longer with each time.\n\nI often try to focus on it, trying to prolong it.\n\nI guess it's not too big of a deal, not compared to some of the things on this subreddit, but it's always kind of fascinated me.

Once, when I was young, I had a case of deju vu where I knew exactly what was going to happen\n\nI was in the fifth grade (I'm 27 now) and we were learning about the Canadian Wetlands. Our teacher was giving his into on some of the dangers to humans when I got the feeling and knew exactly what he was going to say. \n\nIn my memory I knew he was going to go from talking about the moose and how it is more dangerous than a bear. From there I knew he was going to ask about another wetland inhabitant that was very small but could also be deadly. No one would have the answer.\n\nThis couple minutes played out exactly as I thought it would. When he asked the question about the small and deadly creature I raised my hand and when prompted said \"is it a tick?\".\n\nI was correct and this is where my deja vu sensation ended. Somehow I knew what was going to be said and knew the answer to the question that the teacher had answered in my \"memory\"\n\n",

        "text": "This happened several years ago, and, DISCLAIMER: we were pretty baked.  But not so baked that it would fully explain what we saw.\n\nAfter high school a group of friends and I would go around in one of our cars, park somewhere, and hotbox it for a while.  We had a repertoire of the \"usual\" spots, but this particular night we were searching for somewhere different.  There were 5 or 6 of us in my friend's Jeep Cherokee.  Now, some details about the Jeep, because these are important details.  It was an older jeep, silver-grey in color, missing a trim piece on the driver side door, and the rear windows were tinted, but not the front.  \n\nSo, here we are, sort of aimlessly driving around, and we decided to head up this hill.  One of our usual places was near the bottom of this hill, but we had never gone very far up it.  We're following the road up, heads on a swivel for a good spot to park and spark, when we notice to our left, a silver-grey Jeep Cherokee pull up to an intersection.  We all noticed it, and my friend whose Jeep it was made a comment, something to the effect of \"Hey, that's my Jeep!\"  There was a street light reflecting off the front windshield, so we couldn't see anybody inside of it.  We of course just laughed it off and drive past it, and we see it turn to go down the hill behind us at a high rate of speed.\n\nA few minutes pass, and we haven't found a good spot yet, so we're still driving, just following the road, curving and meandering.  None of us have ever been on this road before, so we have no idea where we'll end up, but we keep driving.  All of a sudden, we come to stop sign at an intersection, and what do we see but a silver-grey Jeep Cherokee with tinted rear windows missing a piece of trim on the driver's door, driving perpendicular to us up the hill.  We all stare in silence and as it passes directly in front of us, we see our friend (who was at this very moment driving) looking out at us.  At this point we all began shouting \"What the fuck?!\" or some variation of, and it became a self-fulfilling prophecy, as we in the other Jeep continued up the hill, and we in the current Jeep quickly turned and sped back down the hill.  All of us clearly saw what we believe to be us, in a minute time-shift.  And yes, we were high, but we weren't *that* high.  To this day, we refer to that incident as \"the time paradox\".",

I had played it about three years earlier, and given up in frustration at how unsolvable some of the puzzles were. I still remembered the basic storyline though. There was one part where you have to click books on the shelf. There are five books that you have to click on out of the twenty on the shelf, and they do have to be pressed in a certain order, else the door won't open. The have a bullshit code on them that is pretty much indecipherable even if you do have the key. It had taken me ages to open the door the last time and I was pretty annoyed that I would have to do it again. Out of frustration I just hit books, pretty much at random and the door opened. The chances of it happening by coincidence are so slim, I was pretty amazed. I always figured that there must have been some subconscious memory of the correct sequence (bear in mind it had been at least three years since I had played the puzzle and it wasn't like something you had to do all the time). Couldn't repeat it again anyway, and because I hadn't been paying attention the first time I had to work it all out when I went through the door anyway ha ha\n\nTLDR : Correctly guessed the numbers showing on two dice every time I rolled them for pretty much a whole evening.",

        "text": "So in reading some of your creepy and positively hair-raising posts in this subreddit, I realize that this sounds totally benign and unimpressive, BUT - this totally freaked me out and I still have no plausible explanation. I've talked about it with others and tried to think things through, but nada. Ergo, glitch in the matrix.\n\nI had received back a rental property from an American diplomat family (side note: never rent your house to a US Embassy) and there was a big industrial combination lock on one of the small gates of our property. I knew the code before had been 5312, but it wouldn't open, so I figured the code had been changed by the tenants. However, the Embassy personnel were terrible to deal with and I didn't want to contact them again and ask them about the code. The family that was living in the house had already gone back home to California. I figured I was on my own to break open the lock. Of course, I tried a bunch of other possible codes - 0000, 1234 etc - but nothing worked. The lock was firmly LOCKED.\n\nHowever, breaking the lock was going to be very expensive (the equivalent of at least a couple of hundred dollars), being the sort of lock that it was. I would either have to hire a locksmith or break it open myself after I bought a bunch of tools which themselves would cost a lot. At the same time, I was beyond exhausted in every sphere of my life. The renovation after the family left, the huge deadlines I was under, the bad attitude of the Embassy, it was all a lot to handle all at the same time. Also, basically, I HAD to get the thing opened since I had another tenant coming in and the movers coming the next day. \n\nThe lock the gate was on led to a little cottage where my older brother used to live. He passed away in 1996 and all of his items were still left as he had left them in the cottage right near this locked gate. I told my friend this was back-breaking and heart-breaking work. Deciding which of his personal items to throw out and which to keep was really depressing. And just in general, I kept bumping into life obstacles at every turn. I admit I broke down a few times alone while trying to put out one fire after another. \n\nSo, one afternoon I was particularly feeling very sorry for myself and realized that I would have to open the lock by this afternoon, setting me back more money and I would likely need to call in some help. As you can guess, I suddenly noticed the lock was open. The code was still 5312, which I must have tried dozens of times on several different days. \n\nNobody knew I needed that lock to be open. The Embassy personnel weren't aware and they never turned up anyway when there WAS work to be done, much less do something I didn't ask them to. The steps leading up to the locked gate were also overgrown with shrubbery so no one could have accessed it. The rest of the property was fenced in with an electric gate and I was the only one who had access to it. I had only left for about 30 minutes to grab lunch when I came back and saw the thing open. \n\nI have kept the lock as a souvenir. Now I know the code is 5312. Today, it is in the locked position, and the thing still won't open no matter how hard I try to open it.\n\nTLDR: Industrial grade lock was locked. Needed it to be open. Life generally felt shitty at the time, everything was bad. Lock suddenly opens and work can proceed as planned. Now it is again locked and still won't open, even with the right code. It just opened at the exact time I needed it to.   ",

He looked at me and we just kind of froze. I was like \"whoa\" and he was said something to the affect of \"I'm not even really going to entertain this happened\". I dunno why it kinda un-nerved me, and nobody here will probably give a shit but i thought it was freakish and wanted to share. \n",

        "text": "When I was about three years old, I was playing around the living room while my dad slept on the couch. I got bored because I wasn't allowed to go outside and dad had told me to go away when I'd tried to wake him (he worked night shift), so I laid down and put my feet up on the wall, legs straight and feet pointed up. I was just feeling the wall with my toes, because it was smooth paneling, and the floor was carpeted. To my three year old mind, the squeaking noises my feet made against the paneling were AWESOME. \n\nThen... I crossed my legs. As they crossed, I felt them pop off (painlessly) at the hips, *watched them switch places*, and then pop back on. Understandably, I became distressed and tried to cross my legs back the other way to get them to switch again. Of course, they never did. It made me so upset that I got up and ran to my dad, trying to explain to him in my toddler language that my legs were the wrong way now, crossing my legs and pulling on them to demonstrate. He thought I had to pee and just took me to the bathroom. To this day, my legs haven't switched back the way they were.\n\nI was completely lucid at the time, was not tired, was not on medication, nothing. I don't have a history of leg or foot conditions, so it can't be contributed to vague memories of surgeries. They are in the proper configuration now. My parents never believed me, though now I kind of want to ask them if they remember me crying over my switched legs.",

Because I live with someone who works a rotating shift (days and nights in weird rotation), at one point I was on a 6am-2pm sleep schedule. I often went for walks with someone I was close with at the time around 2am or so, because it was a lovely neighborhood, and felt safe.\n\nThere's a traffic circle/roundabout just about 100 yards from where I used to live. Originally it had been heavily overgrown, with wild hedges, too many trees packing one part of it, and ragged, dying hedges. It was like that for 4 of the 6 years I lived there.\n\nOne night my friend and I walked past it as always, laughing and talking, and I made a comment as I often did about how they needed to clean it up some time. It was 1:30am at the time. My shift-working house mate was home asleep, but he'd driven by the roundabout earlier that day.\n\nWe made our way through the whole walk, which was about 3-4 miles and usually took us around an hour, sometimes longer if we sat and talked halfway through. When we came down the road to make the turn at the roundabout to go up the hill to the apartment we shared, we both stopped dead.\n\nThe roundabout was completely cleared out. The lawn looked freshly sodded but had no lines where the squares might be. The dying trees, all of which had been maybe 10-12 ft tall, were gone. Three much taller trees fill most of that space. Fresh new hedges, perfectly cut, filled the gap at ground level. And two Japanese maples flanked each end. The rest was empty and perfectly groomed, looking like a tiny park. Startling, but beautiful.\n\nWe bolted up the hill and dragged the poor guy out of bed and down the road. It was 3:30, so he'd been about to get up for work anyway. It was chilly, so he woke up pretty fast as we hurried him down the road.  And then he stopped and stared at the suddenly changed roundabout.\n\nStill don't know what happened- that level of work would have made a huge amount of noise, and though we walked a long loop, it was relatively shallow, which meant we could hear most of what went on in the area. How it was cleared out in 2 hours in the middle of the night, or how it was done completely silently is still beyond me.\n\nIt still looks like that now, well cared for and all, though the trees are all significantly taller some eight years later.

We live in the south, and it's a ten minute drive from the freeway to a municipal airport. After a bit, my gf tried to take a picture, because it was interesting. They were going to a lot of trouble to maintain the formation, and, it was over the freeway, where it'd be hard for people to watch easily.\n\nOne small problem.\n\nShe couldn't find them with the phone. At all. She's well-known amongst her friends for being extremely good at capturing planes midflight. Nothing. She tried over and over again to use buildings, trees, or powerlines (as I drove carefully, trying to keep focused on the road) to frame them, but they wouldn't show up.\n\nAnd then a huge black German bomber plane flies out of nowhere. Since traffic was clear, I chanced looking up right as she asked if I saw it. She tried to catch it as well, and still nothing. Moments later all five planes were gone, into a hazy blue sky with no clouds.\n\nCould have been just really poor luck, though my camera has a really wide frame of view, easily giving a 90-100 POV shot without much trouble. This is also not the first time I've had a weird plane glitch. One I had in 2009 still gives me the heebie-jeebies.",

I don't know how they do them now, but in 1988, you bought a pair of \"piercing earrings,\" the studs were sharp and the gun drove them through your ears. So, these were distinctive earrings -- they were pointed on the ends, and instead of being gold balls, they were ovals that stuck out like posts. \n\nSo, being a kid, I tended to loose these very small and oddly shaped earrings a lot. I'd lose one, then find it again, and lose it, and so on. I'd dig them out of the carpet, or under my bed, or behind my dresser. \n\nAt one point, I had three of these earrings. It's just not possible. My mom had a lot of earrings, but not ovals with pointed backs. I had no sisters, and not many friends, and none with these frankly ugly earrings. I had been given other earrings, but, again, none like this. They were more like surgical tools than jewelry, so obviously, I only had one pair. And yet, sometimes, I'd have one, or two, or three. \n\n",

It envolved ego loss, questioning of reality, and me thinking I had died. During that night, we listened to a song recorded by my brother, which was purposely written to trip us out. \"It worked\" is a huge understatement. That song sent me to a different world. It was called \"Tell Me It's Not Strange\". \n\nAnyway, fast forward to this morning at 5am. My dad needs a ride to the airport, and I oblige him. After i've dropped him off, i ask siri to play \"Tell Me It's Not Strange\" to which she replies \"there is noThing on your iPhone called Tell Me It's Not Strange\". I dismiss this as siri failing me yet again.\n\nBut i really want to listen to this song. Even though my trip was so bad, it kinda makes me feel alive to hear that song because everything since that bad trip feels rather hollow. I pulled over and it had just disappeared off my phone. I listened to it a week ago on my drive home from university, and had not synced my phone since. I scrolled carefully through my phone but it had vanished.\n\nI start having a minor panic attack on the side of the road and try to calm down. i wouldn't notice a lot of songs disappearing from my phone but this song is different. I texted my brother, dad and girlfriend who share a music library with me. Only my girlfriend replied to me so far, saying that the song isn't on her phone when I know her library should have it. It was identical to mine. She was the one who asked me to put the music on her phone.\n\nThis was almost an hour ago now. Still kinda frantic in my bed at home. I didn't accidently delete it I don't think. I really don't know where the song went. \n\n I use my girlfriend's laptop for music. I don't know if I should be more frightened to see it sitting in her music library or not, but I guess i'll find out later on.",

We also have proof.\n\nI need to clarify some things first so as not to cause some confusion.\n\n1. In the last 5 years, I have only bought erasers for drawing once, and that was 6 months ago.\n\n2. My friend only buys 1 brand of of his art supplies (specifically erasers) because he is extremely picky on how well they perform, unless he finds something on sale and decides to try it. If it works better then he will use that brand.\n\nOkay. 6 months ago I bought a 3-pack of erasers (papermate pink pearl erasers) as I was getting back into drawing and I didn't have anything to erase with. My friend who has a full art supply/mini shop at his desk offered to trade one of his erasers he uses for a pink pearl of mine so I had a good eraser and he could try the crapy one then prob. throw it away because it sucks. So we trade.\n\nHere's where things are different. He traded mea Staedtler Mars Plastic model no 526 50 Eraser. I have it in front of me right now. When he traded it to me 1 side was heavily used, the other not so much. [THIS](http://cdn.dick-blick.com/items/215/00/21500-0000-1-3ww-l.jpg) is what the eraser/brand looks like.\n\nToday he noticed the eraser during our team meeting and asked- \"Is that a Staedtler I saw you with? I just got my first Staedtler last week, they're amazing.\"\n\nOf course I said, \"Well it should be amazing, I got it from you.\"\n\nHe assured me for the last few years he bought nothing but [Pentel Hi-Polymer](http://www.staples-3p.com/s7/is/image/Staples/s0106527_sc7?$splssku$) erasers. He was positive of this because like I said, when he finds a brand he likes he sticks to it and doesn't buy anything else for a long time. \n\nNow, when discussing about the \"Trading of Erasers\" time period 6 months ago we did this discussion over our work IM system, which saves chat logs until they are manually deleted. He went back through his chat log and found the transcript. Here are his exact words when talking about the eraser he was trading with me.\n\n\"The hi-polymer only shed in big pieces. Easy cleanup\".\n\nJust calling them hi-polymer is how he called the Pentel brand as it was a bit shorter of a name.\n\nHere are the facts that we have.\n\n* We traded my crappy eraser for his good eraser 6 months ago.\n\n* Other than those pink ones, I never bought any erasers.\n\n* The only other eraser I have gotten and kept at work was from trading with him.\n\n* I have a Staedtler in front of me, worn out just as described from the amount of use as the Pentel one he supposidly gave me.\n\n* He hasn't bought the Staedtler brand until last week when he fell in love with it. (he tried it as it was on clearance and liked it enough he brought some to work.)\n\n* He specifically called the eraser he was giving me \"Hi-Polymer\" in our chat log from 6 months ago.\n\nSo what do you guys think? Are we just remembering things differently or is something else going on?",
