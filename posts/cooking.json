Almost every video I see regarding Cacio e Pepe has the host grating cheese with a micro plane into a fine texture, but I think the reason some of these recipes still yield stringy sauce unless weird steps are taken is because the cheese still isn\u2019t grated finely enough. \n\nLooking at their cheese before it\u2019s added, it\u2019s grated into fine strands, but strands nonetheless. I used the punched holes on my box grater (the ones that stick out) and it produced a powdery texture that definitely takes longer to grate, but when I make Cacio e Pepe with this super fine cheese, it\u2019s perfect every time. Keeping all else the same, increasing the size of my grate to the next smallest, the one most frequently used, I had stringy broken sauce. Cooking method was exactly the same both times. \n\nThis isn\u2019t to say you can\u2019t do all the different tricks to prevent the sauce from becoming gooey and stringy, but I almost think it\u2019s more work than necessary for what should be an extremely simple dish. In one pan (not a pot) I boil water and add the pasta, cooking until it\u2019s almost ready. The small amount of water results in more starchy water. Toast the black peppers, then grind them and put them back in a second pan. Just before the pasta is ready, ladle out some water into the pepper pan, add the pasta and additional water, and let that simmer for a minute or two to extract just a little extra starch. There shouldn\u2019t be much water left after a minute or so, so turn the heat off\/remove the pan, and after maybe 30 seconds, slowly add in the powdered cheese and toss (I like to toss so one hand can stay on my cheese bowl and the other can move the pan quickly, but you can stir if you want). Toss over and over until the cheese dissolves, then add more, until you\u2019ve added all the cheese. If you need more water you can ladle some in. \n\nDoing this has never failed me and it results in my favorite lunchtime pasta. I\u2019ve tried doing other things like mixing the cheese with cooled water, but this is much less work and a more consistent result. \n\nI\u2019m curious to hear what other tips\/techniques people use, but I wanted to share this as I\u2019ve only seen one mention anywhere about specifically using the punched holes on a grater, not the micro plane holes you might use to grate cheese on top of pasta, and I think it makes a huge difference.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1678733565.0},{"title":"Cabbage is dirt cheap right now.

We can\u2019t seem to agree on an even split on chores but I can\u2019t keep cooking and doing dishes this often at least from scratch. \n\nWhat are some good ways to incorporate frozen foods\/prepared foods into the meals without going 100% TV dinner? I prefer to season my own food to my liking but I\u2019d like to keep cooking at 1hr max.\n\nThank you all :)","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1678761908.0},{"title":"Besides as an ingredient for brewing beer, are there any other uses of hop in the culinary world?

I\u2019m having my parents over for dinner next Sunday. It\u2019s almost been a year since I moved out and I\u2019m looking to have them over before we hit one year. I want to impress them. My dad grew up with five course meals and we used to go to my grandma\u2019s for fancy dinners like that every Sunday. My goal is to recreate that for them as my grandma just moved to a retirement home. It\u2019s been a big chore for them to move her and an emotional burden. They are burnt out and I want to make this dinner really special as they\u2019ve been so supportive of my move as well and are always helping me out. I show my love through food but I know they will pay more attention to detail than the friends I host. They will say they love it either way, but I do want it to be my best work.\n\nI make these amazing honey miso porkchops that have a strong apple cider vinegar taste with a sweet oriental vibe. They\u2019re my specialty and they never pork for themselves so I\u2019m excited to share that as the main. I am starting them with an amazing Waldorf salad, so there\u2019s going to be apples there obviously. I usually make these porkchops with traditional Haldi which I find pairs well. But I also make these delicious roast lemon garlic potatoes that I\u2019ve been wanting to share with them. \n\nMy essential questions are: will strong apple and lemon flavours go together? And am I fusing two (Asian and Mediterranean) flavour palettes that do not mesh? And any idea on vegetables? \n\nAppreciate all the help! <3","upvote_ratio":0.63,"created_utc":1678751076.0},{"title":"What type of pan is best for stir fry?","author":"Goochmas","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Cooking\/comments\/11quujn\/what_type_of_pan_is_best_for_stir_fry\/","text":"I just bought a D3 all clad stainless steel pan and think I made a mistake in my purchase.

When making breakfast potatoes boil them and fry them in the same skillet.\n\n* Most kitchen tools have dishwasher safe versions if you're willing to make tradeoffs. Stainless steel cookware is dishwasher safe (but not non-stick). Plastic cutting boards are dishwasher safe and won't dull knives (but wood is pretty). Heck some glass refrigerator shelves can be machine washed. The only item in my house that gets hand washed is the chef's knife. \n\n* A good chef's knife can act as a food processor, garlic press, pizza cutter, mandolin and vegetable slicer. Specialized tools have their place but they're all harder to clean.\n\n* Get a glass 9x13 with a lid.

This is simple, just use the rack that comes with the instant pot, put a stainless steel bowl on it, fill the bowl with the rice and water (1 to 1.25 is what I use), fill the base of the pot with a cup of water and use the usual 20 minutes.

Are there any store\/generic or specialty brands you've found to be good?\n\nI grew up making the traditional Toll House recipe, but I haven't bought Nestle's semisweet chips in years ever since the recipe changed. Well, something in them changed, but I can't pinpoint what exactly. They seemed to have lost the rich chocolate taste they used to have and got sweeter, waxier in texture and often had a funny aftertaste - sometimes I'd get a bag with an odd coconut aftertaste and other times ones that were weirdly cinnamon-y.\n\nThen, I started using Godiva semisweet pretty regularly, but my local Target stopped carrying them and I was never able to find them elsewhere. They had 53% cacao, which was more than a lot of the other semisweet brands, but not so much that they were bitter. Trader Joe's also had  decent semisweet chunks and chips, but changed formulas a couple of years ago and the current, now dairy-free versions just aren't as good.\n\nI've also tried Ghirardelli, Whole Foods' 365 and Guittard semisweet, but have found them to be too sweet and not chocolate-y enough. A lot of the darker chips are too bitter.\n\nFor awhile, I also tried chopping up the Trader Joe's Pound Plus bittersweet bars, but the last few I've bought also seem to have changed and no longer taste as good.\n\nSo, at this point, my go-to has been Ghirardelli 60% bittersweet chips, which work really well, but my local Walmart has just upped the price by $1 per 10-ounce bag or $2 per 20-ounce bag, which is a lot for me. I may still buy them because I haven't found any others that work, but I was wondering if anyone knew of other brands that were good.","upvote_ratio":0.4,"created_utc":1678645157.0},{"title":"Is it at all possible for food to be flavourful without fat?","author":"username--007","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Cooking\/comments\/11py592\/is_it_at_all_possible_for_food_to_be_flavourful\/","text":"Olive oil and butter has long been a part of my diet from the start of my home cooking.

It usually comes up in reviews pretty much everywhere as good value for the money and hey, it might be, but I'm kinda upset with the durability in general, specially when compared to other similar, lower quality (or at least cheaper) stuff I've got. \n\nFirst, I will mention the 3-in-1 food processor. While I'm quite happy with the shake cup as I use it for protein shakes and still to this day it holds quite well, I think this is the only highlight from the stuff I've gotten from Ninja. The food processor bowl had its mountings coming out, which I would not even mad if I used it everyday (like the shake bottle), but I used it less than 10 times and it just fell off it. It is still somewhat usable if I place it perfectly so it makes the blades spin, but still it is completely nuts that it fell off after so few uses. This was shortly before a year after purchase, and after contacting Amazon customer service, I ended up agreeing to a partial refund, although perhaps I could had pushed for a full refund and return to buy a better food processor, I'm still quite happy with the shake blender. Hell, I would also be totally happy with the food processor if it wasn't for this, as it did the job chopping vegs exactly as I wanted to! \n\nNow, the Foodi Zerostick pans, which I have two and little over a year they are peeling, which is something they literally advertise as \"chip, flake and peel free\". I was happy using them, but this is literally not what I was expecting here when they advertise in such a way.\n\nWhat's worse is that the issues I've gotten were also flagged in the reviews on Amazon, but of course, those reviews came after my purchase, so I couldn't had used them as warnings back when I got them.\n\nFull disclosure here: I've put them all on the dishwasher far more times than I've handwashed them. The thing is that these are also advertised dishwasher safe items and that was also part of why I bought them to begin with, if I was planning to handwash pans, I would had bought a cast iron or carbon steel one to last beyond a lifetime. Meanwhile, I've had pans for way longer than these and a small food processor that I use everyday, all of them were less than half the price of their Ninja's counterpart, all of them go into the dishwasher as regularly and all of them are holding up far better! Admittedly, their performance might be below Ninja's, but I truly wasn't expecting Ninja's durability to be this low specially when they advertise a 10 year warranty.\n\nOnly redeeming option would be for me to use their warranty and get a proper solution, as I'm yet to contact them about them cause it's Sunday and I've preferred to come cry in Reddit first.

The trick is to get the oil to bond to the pan in such a way where the food physically cannot come in contact with the metal, with a molecular layer of oil always getting between the food and the pan. I'm not talking about seasoning a pan [with a hundred layers of seasoning](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/castiron\/comments\/10zprtu\/100_coats_thank_you_everyone_its_been_fun\/); even a single layer of oil (not even enough to discolor the pan) is enough to make your pan perform like a non-stick pan if you treat it right.\n\nHere are two examples (the first one doesn't show the seasoning process). Please click through and see these demonstrations:\n\n* [A freshly seasoned wok that is impressively non-stick](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/carbonsteel\/comments\/y9qck9\/blueing_a_wok_with_a_weed_burner_from_the_clock\/)\n* [Cooking an omelet in a stainless steel pan with no oil](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1376ITxF1Oc&t=204s) (linked straight to the timestamp where the demonstration begins)\n\nThe method for getting oil to do this is explained in the first part of the second video. Heat up your pan with some oil up to the temperature where it barely begins to smoke, then take the pan off the heat. Then you can pour off the oil and wipe the pan of any residual oil, and food still won't stick; upon being heated to its smoke point, the oil bonds to the bare metal of the pan and leaves an ultra thin coating that isn't even visible (as shown in the second video linked above), and this coating prevents food from sticking.\n\n(The explanation given in the second video isn't technically correct. The metal doesn't \"expand its pores\" and cause oil to be embedded there after it cools. Stainless steel cookware isn't porous. But the method works, even if the explanation offered isn't technically correct.)\n\nThis trick doesn't even need to be done ahead of time; it can be done when you're cooking. In Chinese wok cooking, there is a technique called \"[longyao](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/results?search_query=wok+longyao)\" where the wok user heats the pan up to the point where the oil barely begins to smoke, and then adds the food into the hot wok. Sometimes the wok cook will pour off any excess oil before adding the food. The longyao step ensures that the food doesn't stick to the wok.\n\nDon't smoke the oil too hard, since that's bad for you; just bring it up to the temperature where the pan shows the barest whisps of smoke, and that should be good enough.\n\nTry this out and see if it works for you.","upvote_ratio":0.7,"created_utc":1678525743.0},{"title":"Can you defrost spam in the microwave?","author":"chiaseeds18","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Cooking\/comments\/11p3agq\/can_you_defrost_spam_in_the_microwave\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.38,"created_utc":1678589725.0},{"title":"I removed the skins from my chickpeas and my hummus is still grainy.

To some extent, even though I'm not exactly doing anything complicated, it is actually kind of fun. But I've always had fairly bad anxiety about health and that extends to risking food poisoning. Basically, I just don't do anything that seems at all risky; even if the risk level is small, no meal is worth it if afterwards I'm going to be consumed by anxiety as I wait for potentially life-threatening food poisoning symptoms to start (I don't know why I'm like this since I've never even had food poisoning as far as I know, but, nevertheless, I am.)\n\n...Or at least I don't *intentionally* take risks. Recently, as I was grabbing something from my pantry, I noticed a warning on a thing of store-bought chicken broth to refrigerate it within two hours after opening. I am usually extremely cautious about proper storage instructions, but I guess I wasn't as thorough as I thought since I had always thought chicken broth was a shelf-stable item. That bottle was unopened, but the previous bottle I had (which was identical), I opened it, used half of it for one meal, and then used the rest of it a little over two weeks later (about a month before today) for another meal, storing it in my pantry between the two meals.\n\nWhich means that, because I thought it was shelf-stable, over the span of 3 days, I consumed 2 cups of a perishable liquid that had been left at room temperature for over two weeks.\n\nThis thought is genuinely horrifying to me. I closed the bottle before putting it into my pantry, of course, but that would have created the perfect anaerobic environment for botulism, for example... And I'm pretty sure the first time I used it, it was open for at least a few minutes (if I remember correctly, I put it in a pot, put other things in that pot, turned a stove on, and *then* closed the bottle). Obviously, the second time, the smell and taste were good enough that I didn't notice anything wrong (I would have thrown the food away or at least investigated if I had even suspected anything). But... that's 100x the government's \"danger zone\" recommendation...\n\nEvidently, I am not dead, and I don't recall any extreme bout of illness a month ago (disclaimer: that does *not* mean what I did is okay\u2014please don't do it). If there *are* life-threatening foodborne symptoms that could start over a month later and I should seek medical attention, then... let me know I guess... but otherwise, I assume, by some miracle, that I'm completely fine. But now I'm scared to ever cook again. I thought I was putting a lot of effort into food safety (and I *always* look at storage instructions so I'm really not sure how this even happened\u2014honestly, I wonder if I did refrigerate it and just have no memory of doing so, which would explain why I'm, like, alive, but I pretty clearly remember putting it back into the pantry) but I seriously could have killed myself, and I don't know how to trust myself going forward. How do I know I'm not unknowingly making any other potentially lethal mistakes? That just feels like it was so high-risk and I'm terrified that I'll do something similar again and I'm getting very tempted to just go to restaurants or order food delivery every day. I absolutely can't afford that but it's cheaper than a long battle for my life at the ER.\n\nHas anyone else here accidentally made risky mistakes like this while new to cooking?

Melt butter in deep pan or skillet over medium low heat. Stir in garlic and spinach and saute for (8 minutes). Add light cream and simmer until reduced by about half (about 5 minutes). add pepper, increase heat to high and cook for (3 minutes). Remove from heat. Stir in scallops and pasta.

It tastes good, but that's more because of the ingredients than the recipe.\n\nThe problem I have with the recipe is that while good and solid as I feel like it could be better.

If I look up the spices included in garam masala or a standard Japanese curry mix there's, well, *a lot* (Just to back my post up with an example here: The latter could, in some versions, contain (1) turmeric, (2) coriander, (3) cumin, (4) fenugreek, (5) ground black pepper, (6) cinnamon, (7) ginger, (8) garlic powder, (9) nutmeg, (10) fennel, (11) cardamom, (12) cloves, (13) bay leaf, (14) star anise, (15) allspice, (16) thyme, (17) sage, (18) cayenne). When making different curries, I keep noticing that, really, the list of spices that flow into it hardly changes - with maybe just a couple small differences in variety and quantity.\n\nAnd sure - I might be able to distinguish the cinnamon, or coriander or cumin from the mix. But is the addition of each spice in such a large blend *really* adding something distinctive to it, or does it just end up being in my head because that's the way I simply learnt to cook certain dishes? Would I *really* be able to taste the difference between a curry that includes the entire list and one that might be lacking one spice in there?\n\nAnd how much does quantity matter? Spice mix recipes are usually very exact in their measurements, but, honestly, I always just eyeball it when making my own blends and it still works perfectly fine. Moreso than just working, I doubt I would be able to taste the difference between blend made on day A and on day B, even though the quantities used will certainly differ.\n\nAt this point, it feels like I could just take *all* of my spices - and I have a lot, throw them together randomly and it would still, somehow, work - at least for \"flavor bomb\" dishes like curries. But at what point is it too much? Is the taste I'm creating that way really something \"intricate\" that had a lot of thought flow into it, or is it just something that overwhelms my tastebuds and makes me think it's good even though less variety or quantity would have worked just as well?\n\nThe answer to those two questions will then probably lead me to yet another question - how do I decide which spices exactly to use? I generally either just pour it in by feeling (which usually works well - surprisingly!), or follow some recipe.","upvote_ratio":0.33,"created_utc":1678400982.0},{"title":"Healthy Alternatives to Butter","author":"karatammas","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Cooking\/comments\/11ngb4z\/healthy_alternatives_to_butter\/","text":"Hello all!

I'm a college student in America, and I started learning how to cook a few months ago. I'm obviously not very good. I can make a few things decently well, but nothing very great, and I'd definitely like to be a lot better.\n\nThere's two major impediments to my cooking journey. First, I just don't know how to go about it. I haven't been following any particular methodology to learn how to cook, and I just try making whatever suits my fancy and doesn't seem too difficult. I think this is the easier issue to solve. The other is that I have very little experience with food in general. My family is very strictly lacto-vegetarian so I wasn't able to start eating meat until a year and a half ago when I went to college. Because of this, even using a food thermometer I'm terrified of giving myself food poisoning since I can't accurately judge when meat is fully cooked. Also due to my family's vegetarianism, we *never* eat out, and while my mother (who does most of the cooking) pretty good at Indian cuisine, anything else tends to be rather questionable. Overall my parents just aren't very adventurous with food, so I've ended up having a very limited experience \u2014 I'd never even had lasagna until last year. \n\nThere's a few smaller issues as well. For example, my college is in an area that is rather lacking in diversity, so it's difficult to get anything-less-than-common ingredients at all, let alone for a good quality and price. This isn't necessarily terrible though since I can get some things from my hometown, albeit nothing with animal products. Also, at the moment I have pretty limited space, so I have very little room for ingredients and cooking dishes (I don't even have a pot). This will be alleviated next year though, since I'll be moving to my own place with a very nice and fairly large kitchen.\n\nAll in all, I'm not really sure where to start with learning how to cook better. I would really appreciate advice on how to improve, (free) resources for learning, etc.","upvote_ratio":0.67,"created_utc":1677970790.0},{"title":"Reducing sweetness in cherry tomatoes?","author":"FiestyPenguin101","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Cooking\/comments\/11ig31h\/reducing_sweetness_in_cherry_tomatoes\/","text":"I've had a bumper crop of cherry tomatoes this year so I've been freezing bags of them, as well as eating them fresh.

My name's James and I think we should all be inviting more stuff to live in our food.\nMy first book, [Of Cabbages & Kimchi: A Practical Guide to the World of Fermented Food](https:\/\/smile.amazon.co.uk\/Cabbages-Kimchi-Practical-Guide-Fermented\/dp\/0241455006\/) came out yesterday. I'm excited but kind of terrified. Let's talk about it.\n\nAbout 7 years ago, I was running a pop-up restaurant with my wife to supplement my meagre income as a writer. We were planning our Halloween event (always our favourite of the year), and decided it needed 'vegan zombie brains'. I tried out making cauliflower kimchi, and got completely hooked on using microbes to bring food to life. I started making a lot more kimchi. Possibly too much. I moved from jars to a barrel, then another barrel, then I started naming the barrels. I got it into some local shops, then less local shops, then started exporting it (and then stopped again - I'm in the UK and, well, Brexit...). \n\nI've now written a book all about fermented foods, covering sauerkraut, hot sauce, kimchi, soy sauce, vinegar, kvass, kefir, kombucha, tepache and yogurt. It's full of stories about the surprising history and microbial wonder of fermentation, alongside over sixty recipes ranging from from sauerkraut pierogi to soy sauce caramel dark milk chocolate tart and fig & fennel seed kombucha to kefir panna cotta  with orange blossom and thyme, and is packed with some [truly beautiful](https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/Zxv3pQr\/DSCF1153.jpg) [gastro-surrealist illustrations](https:\/\/i.ibb.co\/FKKZ1Dt\/DSCF1154.jpg) from [Marija Tiurina](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/marijatiurina\/).\n\nI wrote the book partially through lockdown, which made visiting the library for research a little trickier. A lot of the best sources I found weren't in English (and occasionally weren't even in modern languages - shout out to Walther Ryff for the first reference to sauerkraut in Middle High German). I found fermentation absolutely everywhere once I started looking, from 8,000 year-old burial sites to the HMS Endeavour and International Space Station. I stumbled across Russian kvass adverts on Youtube featuring [Gene Simmons](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oJ8Ntmvy_n0&ab_channel=Shoygoo) and Michael Jackson impersonators, and discovered that those miniature Tabasco sauce bottles were originally created as an interval giveaway for an opera. \n\nDavid Zilber, co-author of The Noma Guide to Fermentation, called it \"A fantastically thorough introductory guide to the wild wonderland of fermentation, with imagery that would make Lewis Carroll proud\", and Fuchsia Dunlop, author of The Food of Sichuan said \"James Read's debut book is both a fascinating read and a practical kitchen guide. I am clearly going to have to start making my own soy sauce!\". Very kind of them.\n\nIf you're interested, do please buy the book ([Waterstones](https:\/\/www.waterstones.com\/book\/of-cabbages-and-kimchi\/james-read\/9780241455005), [Amazon UK](https:\/\/smile.amazon.co.uk\/Cabbages-Kimchi-Practical-Guide-Fermented\/dp\/0241455006\/) or [Book Depository](https:\/\/www.bookdepository.com\/Cabbages-Kimchi-James-Read\/9780241455005) (free int'l shipping))  - whether you  want to read about the folklore, history and science of fermentation, or to learn how to make everything from beetroot kvass borscht to kefir-fried chicken. The pictures are really nice too.\n\nMy instagram is [@jamesreadwrites](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/jamesreadwrites\/)\n\nI've goofed off enough on here over the last 14 years, so it's time to give back.

They are not adventurous at all with their food\u2026 hibachi, gnocchi, fajitas, soft shell tacos, and pesto are all examples of food that would be \u201ctoo out there\u201d for them. They like burgers, spaghetti and meatballs, chicken and rice, etc. If left to my own devices, I will inadvertently cook them a meal that is far too crazy for them. I\u2019m looking for ideas for easy meals that we all will enjoy. Bonus points if it\u2019s a slow cooker dump meal. They are visiting to see the new baby so time is of the essence. I\u2019ll be having my FIL grill out a couple nights to reduce the effort on me. Before you say just have them cook\u2026 they suck at it so I would rather do it and have a meal I enjoy. The last time my MIL cooked she made a chicken rice bake that was in the oven for over an hour and the rice was crunchy. Oh and the meals must include meat of course lol. Anything without meat is probably considered a side dish.\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for your suggestions! I\u2019m feeling confident and excited for this week. I do love to cook and show my care for others through food. My in-laws are actually very wonderful and supportive (despite my frustration with their food preferences). My FIL has done renovations on our home that have probably increased the value of it by tens of thousands of dollars. He\u2019s amazing! \n\nAlso things to clarify- I\u2019m 3 months post partum and my husband has been incredibly selfless and hardworking. I do not mind at all cooking quick meals this week for his family. He has been running himself ragged working extra shifts so I can take a longer maternity leave. \n\nHard shell tacos are fine just not soft shell lol. Tacos are a method of getting more sour cream into your mouth. \n\nMac and cheese is considered a side dish. Someone ordered it at a restaurant in front of them and they were amazed. Like it just never crossed their minds that it could be a full meal. They would tell the story to people like \u201cso and so got mac and cheese FOR DINNER\u201d. It was hilarious. \n\nFinally, I believe their pickiness also stems from a period in their lives where they had food insecurity. If they bought food then it had to be consumed so the idea of trying new foods was legitimately anxiety provoking because if they didn\u2019t like it then it was a waste of money.  Once I read through everyone\u2019s responses I realized that I can make simple but delish meals for the week that everyone will like.","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1677862027.0},{"title":"Did I make a mistake smoking the chicken tikka ?","author":"standardtissue","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Cooking\/comments\/11i0crj\/did_i_make_a_mistake_smoking_the_chicken_tikka\/","text":"Made tikka missala last week and it came out amazing.
