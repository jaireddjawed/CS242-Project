        "text": "So as the title says, should low level programmers use slow computers? To encourage program optimisation. \n\nObviously, this would be ridiculous to use for all programming areas, but I am specifically talking low level, such as graphics programmers, game engine designers, neural network programmers, microdevices etc....\n\nThis came to my mind because, as someone who has a very fast gaming pc for gaming, but also does programming on it. I only recently considered the fact that I could be programming something that runs insanely fast on my pc since its a beast, yet for someone with a 2012 - 2010 era pc might have a real bad time running it. Therefore, if I programmed on a slow pc I could ensure that every user would have a fast experience.\n\nI think this is already done in certain areas such as emulating ps4 specs for game programmers.",
