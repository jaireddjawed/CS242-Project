The devil's in the details, though, and I've still got some questions. Specifically with regard to running Linux on it.\n\n1. **Do you use it as your daily driver?**  \nIf not, what's stopping you?  I'm looking replace my \"go bag\" laptop and phone with this, so any warnings would be appreciated.\n2. **It looks like PlanetCom supplies their own version of Linux.**Has anyone run vanilla Debian on it? How's driver/hardware support and/or is it worth just sticking with their version?\n\n3) In PlanetCom's version of Debian, what apt repos does it use?\n\ni.e. Does it rely on a repo run by PlanetCom, or does it use the public ones?  I don't want to lock all software updates into a single vendor.\n\n4) Does it work well/at all with a USB-C dock?\n\nI'd like to be able to use it as a full workstation from time to time.  Specifically, does it work well under Debian?\n\n5) Can the dual sims both be active on LTE at once, or is one always in standby?\n\nWhen AT&amp;T shut off 3G voice last year, I lost the ability to receive calls on the non-active SIM since my OP3 can only have one SIM active on LTE at once.  I'd like to be able to receive calls on both SIMs again.\n\n6)",

There was a term I've read and heard about Linux that *\"Linux is just a bunch of files and folders\"* and I'd always ask myself, **\"What do you mean by that?\"** Then it hit me years later. So back in my high school days my school gave us Windows 8 tablets (YIKES) to use, and like standard IT organizations for schools and businesses, it was locked down with standard Windows UAC; so basically it was to do work only and you can't install any other programs. But since my friends were gamers we always wanted to \"bend\" the rules if possible.   \nThe game in choice was Halo CE. The game was extremely small (Under 150MB) and you can copy and paste the entire game from a flash drive, drag and drop to the desktop, and rename the folder to \"schoolwork\" so a teacher would never notice. On the flip side the program would never show up in the registry and Programs and Features on Windows, so it was hard to detect.   \nSo we would launch the .exe inside the folder and start LAN parties at school.  \nNow fast forward to now and I just r/selfhosted my headless Minecraft server so my high school buddies can join my server. After SSH I created my directory, did the java stuff and accepted the EULA terms and conditions etc. **Then that was when I had my \"ah-ha\" moment.**   \n\n\nSo if I'm understanding Linux Server installation correctly, programs are never \"installed\" on Linux they can just run on the contents within a given folder? \n\nIs this the same concept for Linux Desktop also?   \n\n\nReading this [article](https://askubuntu.com/questions/27213/what-is-the-linux-equivalent-to-windows-program-files) is seems like its pretty flexible on the filesystem in general.   \n\n\nBut I wanted to make sure if this is a good concept to follow OR maybe running a service like a Minecraft Server is a wildcard and depending on the program and or service it may be different.  \n\n\nThanks!!!",

        "author": "boutnaru",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/10awgd9/linux_namespaces_mount_namespace/",
        "text": "In the first part of the series we have talked generally about what are namespace and what we can do with them - in case you want to go over it you can use the following link [https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-namespaces-part-1-dcee9c40fb68](https://medium.com/@boutnaru/linux-namespaces-part-1-dcee9c40fb68). Now we are going to deep dive into the mount namespace.\n\nThe goal of mount namespace is to provide isolation regarding the list of mounts as seen by the process/tasks in each namespace. By doing so different processes/tasks that belong to different mount namespaces will see distinct directories hierarchies ([https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount\\_namespaces.7.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount_namespaces.7.html)). \n\nUsing ‚Äú/proc‚Äù we can inspect the mounting points visible for specific processes using ‚Äú/proc/\\[PID\\]/mounts, ‚Äú/proc/\\[PID\\]/mountinfo‚Äù and ‚Äú/proc/\\[PID\\]/mountstats‚Äù. For more information about them I suggest reading [https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html). You can see the different outputs when reading the data in different mount namespace - as seen in the screenshot below.\n\nAfter the implementation of mount namespaces the isolation they have created a problem. Think about a case when we add some device that we want to be visible on every namespace, for that we need to execute a ‚Äúmount‚Äù command on each namespace. To overcome this the shared subtree feature was introduced in kernel 2.6.15 ([https://lwn.net/Articles/689856/](https://lwn.net/Articles/689856/)).  \n\nBy using shared subtrees we can propagate mount/unmount events between distinct mount namespaces.([https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red\\_hat\\_enterprise\\_linux/6/html/storage\\_administration\\_guide/sect-using\\_the\\_mount\\_command-mounting-bind](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/storage_administration_guide/sect-using_the_mount_command-mounting-bind)). It is designed to work between mounts that are members of the same peer group. Thus, ‚Äúpeer group‚Äù is defined as a group of vfsmounts that propagate events between each other ([https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/mount-namespaces](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/mount-namespaces)).  \n\nWe can control the propagation using the mount system call by passing one of the following ‚Äúmountflags‚Äù: MS\\_SHARED, MS\\_PRIVATE, MS\\_SLAVE, or MS\\_UNBINDABLE ([https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount.2.html](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount.2.html)).  For a detailed description of each flag I encourage you to read the following link [https://hechao.li/2020/06/09/Mini-Container-Series-Part-1-Filesystem-Isolation/](https://hechao.li/2020/06/09/Mini-Container-Series-Part-1-Filesystem-Isolation/). \n\nFor more information about shared subtrees I suggest reading the kernel documentation ([https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/sharedsubtree.txt)). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lojprimvqtba1.png?width=733&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3826812d51df8653dbb7ff0460ed3b7720fb066d",

I was not sure about which distribution to pick, this is why I settled on Ubuntu and went for it.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I've been using it for a few months and I completely love the Linux way to do things, I am not coming back anymore. On the other hand, I have some issues in regard to how Ubuntu and Canonical exactly do it. Primarily I don't like its hype with snaps, and even though I tried to install all my apps as \\`.deb\\` packages, after the updates I installed today, it still installed the Firefox snap and redirected everything (symbolic links, command line and even the task bar icon) to it. This is why I consider to move to another distribution that isn't as much bloated as Ubuntu is, and Fedora seems to be the option that suits my needs.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy questions are:  \n\n* Does it have wide range of software available? I use Linux for development, and I need JetBrains IDEs, Visual Studio Code and Firefox. Will I be able to find and install them? And also, plenty of software on Linux are available as \\`.deb\\` packages, if something goes wrong, can I use those as well?\n* Does it have issues with drivers? I primarily only need camera and microphone and some drivers that would prolong the battery life (this is the common issue in Ubuntu that it drains much more power than Windows because of some driver). Will I have issues related to driver availability and their installation?  \n* How does Fedora support versions work? Ubuntu has long-term support lasting for 4 years, meanwhile most Fedora distributions are supported for 13 months. What happens afterwards? Will I need to entirely install the newer version as a new OS or will there be the updates that will take care of it?\n\nThanks for all of your replies! If you can suggest me a different distribution that would better fit me, then you are welcome to tell me.  \n\nP.S. I don't use Arch by the way.",

It's not technically kernel specific, but it'd likely take an overhaul of the source code to make it feasible and not entirely broken\n2. The amount of random drivers and kernel modules included by default (This is also a security risk as seen by various CVEs exploiting filesystem drivers... cough cough overlayfs)\n3. Lack of abstraction in regards to basic functionality that most OS's would consider part of the kernel. This isn't really a code issue per say more so a personal gripe that I have with the Linux ecosystem.

It seems fairly counter-intuitive as the operating system is part of the appeal of the MacBook for me, but I'm tired of constantly deleting files to maintain my hard drive.\n\nIs anyone currently running a similar setup? If so, are there any known hardware issues or specific drivers that need to be installed? I'm confident that I could fix any problems, but I'd like to know if anyone has any words of wisdom before I pull the trigger.\n\nThanks!",
