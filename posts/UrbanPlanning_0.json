        "text": "I have been watching various videos from urban planners that generally do not like car dependency. One of the tenants of these videos is that the large parking spaces that tend to exist around \"communal\" spaces,(malls, shopping centers, etc.), and I am wondering, if we do get rid of these parking spaces, yes the vast majority of them, and build more stores/residential units in those spaces, would parking garages be justified? But then they seem to be disliked by Urban Planners as \"Lazy planning\". So where do the cars go? do they go out in the fields in the middle of nowhere next to Jackson's farm?, or do they get pushed underground, which is a whole other issue. I live in the suburbs, and I am fine with mixed-use zoning, even supporting it when its a new development, but I still do not see how these urban planners online plan to put all the cars somewhere. Also, I do not see the point of \"Public transport fixes everything!\" It does not, I do not want to wait 30 minutes because I missed the bus with my items, and I do not want to think of the logistics of that. So, a final question, \n\n**Where do the cars go without parking spaces/parking garages?**\n\nAs an additional note, this is a question about Suburb - Urban driving, not internal urban travel, after all, the suburbs are car-dependent. The cars do not magically disappear because of your map.",

I will try and keep it short and concise.\n\nEssentially, I have been taking engineering gen-eds at a community college, and am preparing to transfer to a 4 year university, at which I will be majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I am also entertaining the idea of doing a minor in Urban and Regional Planning at the same school.\n\n I have always been strong in math, and have been influenced by family to pursue an education in engineering. I have also always taken interest in geography/cities, and over the last couple of years, I have shifted my personal focus to hone in on safer street design, public transportation, and a lot of other urban design and planning issues. I am constantly thinking about these things. Car dependency, traffic congestion, land-use, and how the built environment dictates how a society can operate freely.  After an exchange program in France about Urban sustainability, I have been extremely passionate towards learning how I can work in the field of sustainable street design, land-use, and transportation. I absolutely cherish every travel opportunity I have, and want to be sure that I possess the necessary credentials to work in the urban planning career field abroad. I recognize the need for smarter engineers and planners in the United States, however I also appreciate the innovations that are occurring in several European countries. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I finish my bachelors in Mechanical Engineering, I feel that I would want to pursue a masters program in Urban Planning. I have already explored a few masters planning programs, and they seem awesome.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould I switch out of engineering for an undergrad degree while I can and instead major in urban planning? I greatly appreciate any advice or opinions. thank you.",

The roads arent even in a grid in most places so you get these awful cul-de sac circles that branch out into any direction they want taking up as much land as they want and using cul de sac as innefficiently as possible and putting the houses 500 feet apart… It is basically all like this. The only places that feel urban are the massive weird new Luxury type mall areas that have a ton of roundabouts and are mostly just parking lot deserts. The roads from Manchester to MA and Nashua to MA are caked with shopping centers for residents of massachusetts to go shopping at using their cars of course to drive there. A lot of people neglect to even think of this area as part of the boston area specifically rockingham and Strafford counties which are part of the boston metropolitan area. The population of both Strafford and Rockingham in 1950 was 96,000, now it is 434,000!

I know that new apartments will always be more expensive than old ones, but most of these new apartments have so many \"amenities\" like a pool, gym, yoga studio, conference rooms, clubhouse, etc that I don't see how they will ever become affordable over time, because you're paying for all that extra stuff. Is there a way for cities to incentivize more middle of the road mixed use development? Or do you think it will become more affordable as it ages?",

I feel like zoning code enforcement is a whole separate skillset from planning and is not what I ever envisioned myself doing in my career, nor is it what I ever trained for in school. The constant jumping back and forth between acting as a planner and having to take people through the enforcement process over mostly stupid violations (e.g. parking on grass) feels like too much to handle sometimes.

Being able to clearly see in the street that a tram line runs past does a large amount for development and property values around the line. This is something that even a very efficient bus service can never quite reach.\n\nI recently randomly saw a video on youtube and got to reading about the Nancy demi-tram TVR ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr4EZwZbxwQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr4EZwZbxwQ)). Building this was a very weird decision made by the council there. More disadvantages than advantages, but a key win it does seem to have is the psychological one of a fixed line.\n\nThe permanence factor is a tricky one. Its the very expense and difficulty of installation, that makes it something permanent. A very tricky thing to attempt to put a price on but any recommendations of research attempting to do just that? (some kind of methodology basically around comparing property/tax increases vs. installation cost?)\n\nThe visibility factor however... this one has me thinking. An idea came to mind, an idea so simple and dumb that it has surely been tried somewhere and its understood why it doesn't work-  how about painting the entirety of major bus lines. A clear line on the road from beginning to end to say \"This is bus route 1\".\n\nI wonder- does anyone know whether anywhere ever tried something like this and came up with a solid write up on reasons why its a dumb idea?",

        "text": "First of all, land conservation is obviously good and there are great benefits to giving people access to nature. However at some point it seems that conserving land close to cities is actually quite bad since it heavily restricts the supply of buildable land. Consider Boston, the third most expensive metro area in the country. Look at a satellite view and all the conserved forest within 15-25 miles of downtown Boston. Is that not a bit ridiculous? Do you really need 3-4 giant tracts of conserved land right next to each other when one would be more than enough to give people recreational access? Same in NYC, which is surrounded by an unofficial greenbelt to the northwest just 25 miles away from Manhattan. \n\nThe wilderness should be in the wilderness, not within easy commuting distance from the nation’s leading economic centers. *Some* conserved land in urban areas is good; a ton of it is overkill. Now of course you could argue that these metro areas should reform their zoning, build up not out, etc. and while I agree, I don't see it happening as long as it's done on a town-by-town basis. And even if you change zoning, you can’t force anyone to tear down their house for urbanists’ density dreams. What you *can do* is clear cut a superfluous 5,000 acre state forest, lay out a proper street pattern, zone it well (or not at all!), and allow hundreds of thousands of people to live near where they want to live. To make sure things even out, the state could buy land where it is cheaper (the actual wilderness) and conserve it there.",

        "text": "Maybe this was already asked before in this subreddit, but I wanted people's thoughts on this article based off of a study labeled \"Does TOD Need the T?\".\n\nHere's the article: [https://www.accessmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2015/11/access47.2chatman.pdf](https://www.accessmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2015/11/access47.2chatman.pdf)\n\nHere's the study:[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01944363.2013.791008?journalCode=rjpa20](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01944363.2013.791008?journalCode=rjpa20)\n\nIn the study, the author first noted that rail access, at first glance, is associated with lower car ownership and vehicle travel. The author also noted the possibility that the age of housing could be a predictor of car ownership because the new housing and rental units near rail were typically smaller, and these housing types attract households who may potentially drive less because they're typically younger, lower income, and have fewer children.\n\nHowever, after the author controlled for other factors like parking availability, housing type, bus availability, population density, and other built environment factors, he found that neither rail access nor housing age were significant factors in predicting car ownership, commutes to work, or commutes to the grocery store. Reducing on and off-street parking availability as well as increasing the number of bus stops within a mile radius had a more signficant effect on reducing car ownership than rail access. Reducing parking availability, increasing bus stop density, reducing distance to the central business district, and increasing job density had a greater effect on decreasing commutes by car to work than rail access. Reduced parking, more bus stops, greater job density, less distance to downtown, and of course, closer access and higher density of grocery stores, had a greater effect on reducing car commutes to grocery stores than rail access.\n\nThe author's point is this if I'm not mistaken. Rail is usually pretty expensive to build, and if it turns out we can build walkable neighborhoods that encourage people to drive less and use other modes of travel without needing rail, we should consider doing that. But what do you think about of the study? Was it flawed? Are there other purposes of rail that should be considered? Are there better studies with more sophisticated and less flawed methodology which show that access to rail is a much more significant predictor?\n\nTo clarify, I neither endorse nor reject this article/study.",

        "text": "Hey all! Thought I'd drop by and get some advice.\n\nSome background on me. I graduated back in 2021 with a bachelors in Human Geography with minors in Environmental Studies and GIS from UofT (I'm based in Canada). I'm currently working as a Research Analyst in Real Estate, observing regional construction trends, tenant movements, market trends, etc. Currently making 50K CAD but recently got a 15% raise which kicks in next month. I also have a student loan with around 15K left to pay off.\n\nI've been planning on applying to an Urban planning masters in Sweden in late 2023 or in 2024, with the intention of hopefully working in that country/region afterwards. Working in planning in some capacity has always been the goal for me, and specifically the Scandinavian countries/Sweden as they're among the most innovative as it concerns planning principles and sustainability from the conversations I've had with planners operating in the region. I also just think the region would be a decent place to work and live long-term, for various different reasons.\n\nAs such, I've been learning Swedish pretty intensively and have been stashing away cash to support myself during the potential masters - I currently have ~20K CAD saved up with the intention of saving up literally as much as I humanely can.\n\nLinköping University's Strategic Urban and Regional Planning program is one which has caught my eye and would probably be my first choice - doesn't look too be terribly competitive with total tuition at 190,000 SEK (~$24,000 CAD). The most expensive program I've seen is at KTH Stockholm at 310,000 SEK (just over $40,000 CAD).\n\nMy question is if any of you think this is a realistic goal, both financially and career-wise. I recognize that I would be taking on student debt to finance this endeavour, while many people generally say that one should avoid paying out-of-pocket for their Master's Degree. \n\nThe alternative would be either forgoing a Masters in general or doing one in Canada, perhaps with the intention of going abroad later in life, which could be difficult without that local knowledge and connections if I stick to planning. \n\nThanks for any opinions!!",

        "text": "I'll start off by saying that today has been a uniquely terrible day for me. Due to my mom being a Penn employee back in the 90s and 2000s, I was eligible for full tuition remission to graduate school at Penn. As such, Penn's planning program has been a dream of mine ever since I decided to pursue planning as a teenager. Seven years later and I just got the decision back from PennPlanning; I was rejected. This is the second time in a row I have been rejected from Penn's graduate planning program and it's definitely crushed this dream I've held since I was 15. This feels like it was my best opportunity to get a great graduate planning education for next to nothing, but I just wasn't up to the task.\n\nAnyway, since PennPlanning is no longer an option (unless I stubbornly apply for a third time), I am now considering other planning schools for either this Fall or next Fall. Rutgers is still allowing applicants for Fall 2023, and there are hundreds of other schools to consider for next year. I'm wondering though, is the cost really worth it? Penn was a great chance due to the potential free ride, but a graduate planning education in the US seems to be anywhere between $30 and $50,000. I am already $23,000 in debt from my undergrad (subsidized federal loans thankfully), so another 30-50K on top of that seems insane for a field that doesn't seem to offer that much pay. \n\nI majored in Geography for my undergrad, with a strong focus on GIS. I managed to get a GIS certificate and am now a GIS technician at a utilities company, which is boring but pays decently. Whenever I look at salaries for upper-level GIS postings vs planning jobs, the salary difference is quite apparent. A career in GIS feels much more boring and less fulfilling than planning, but I would possibly be in much less debt making much more money. Planning has always been a dream of mine, so giving up on it will be depressing nonetheless.\n\nSorry for the rambling post, I was hoping to get some advice and answers from professionals with experience in these fields. \n\nTLDR: I am debating whether pursing a master's in planning is worth the additional debt as opposed to continuing with GIS.",

Since you wouldn’t need individual cars for the bulk of the trip, this could massively reduce the required highway/road size as well as traffic, making transit faster. \n\nIs this reasonable and feasible? What might I have gotten wrong here? (My conclusion from this scenario is that the self driving industry can be a key player in better urban design).",

I love sociology but I also have a huge passion for all things urbanism, public transportation, urban design etc. I spend a lot of time learning about new infrastructure and developments, transit lines, and advocating for higher density (Yay Missing Middle!!!) and equitable policy changes. \n\nI didn't know what I wanted to do at all when I started school, if I had I would've taken some Geography classes but too late. I know I have to take a masters in the future, which I think I would like to do abroad.\n\nI currently work in the hospitality industry and am hoping to move on to a new job around the same time I graduate. I really want to try to get my foot in the door in my future but feel super overwhelmed with what I should do and the best path to take. \n\nQuestions\n\n1. I think the Urban Planning/Transportation Planning/Urbanism 'space' is where I want to end up. I feel like this is such a wide space and I wish I had a better idea of which careers align best with my interests. Maybe there aren't any....? Thoughts?\n   1. Where do I go next job wise? I would like to try to get some more experience doing something within my interests. The job market is a little tight because I live in a small-ish city on Vancouver Island, Canada.\n2. Any specific recommendations considering my background? I will be taking a couple GIS courses through the local college within the next few years.\n\nThank you all.",

So naturally, transit will inevitably become more efficient if all of the road space and funding is redirected from the cars to them. We all already know this. But, I’m not just talking about the prospect that transit could be *improved* by ditching car-centricity; I’m talking about whether or not transit could be made *as good as* or *better than* cars, by removing the car-centricity. \n\nThe reason why I ask this is because, while there are many other obvious benefits to transit, the speed issue has always been more uncertain to me. Which is tricky, because I think that a lot of people will unfortunately prioritize speed over cost, public comfort, safety, the environment, etc. unless their values change.\n\nSo, is it possible to make transit as fast or faster than driving?
