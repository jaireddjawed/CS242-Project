        "text": "Hello my fellow IT friends, obligatory LTL;FTP.\n\nIt's a calm friday in our IT office at which I'm a first line on-site technician, pretty basic stuff and I'm getting quite confident in this role.\n\nOne of our users ($user in this story) submitted a case that \"Her laptop seems to have updated itself, and her desktop has no files or folders\".\n\nSince she couldn't wait for us to handle it she called us, and I ($me) received the call.\n\n&gt; **$user**: Hi, I submitted a case before and my desktop is empty and the interface looks different.\n&gt; \n&gt; **$me**: Let me remote in to you and take a look.\n\n..And indeed the desktop is empty, and she has Win10 instead of Windows 7. I check some other stuff and no other user profiles are created the computer so I ask her when she noticed that the laptop had W10 instead of W7.\n\nWe've had some computers in a deployment group that gets updated to a version of Windows 10 but that shouldn't wipe the desktop so it doesn't seem to be the case.\n\n&gt; **$user**: Well, I was in a meeting, checking some documents and e-mail and when I came back to my desk it all of a sudden looked different.\n&gt; \n&gt; **$me**: I'll take a look and get back to you.\n\nI talk to my Client Infrastructure Engineers($clientpro) and we can see that the computer was deployed a couple of weeks ago.\n\n&gt; **$me**: This doesn't make sense, the name of this laptop is too new to be her computer, she's had her 460 much longer than a couple of weeks, and there are no primary users.\n\n&gt; **$clientpro**: Yeah, this seems odd and as you mentioned earlier there are no other profiles than hers on this laptop.. Could it be?\n\n&gt; **$me**: ..She's taken the wrong laptop from the meeting, and didn't notice it until she docked it. These users... *facepalm*\n\nI get back to my desk and call her again.\n\n&gt; **$user**: Hi, this is user.\n\n&gt; **$me**: Hi, this is $me from Helpdesk - we've resolved your issue. You brought the wrong laptop back from the meeting to your desktop.\n\nUsers will never cease to amaze me, but I wouldn't have a job without them.\n\nHave a great weekend!",

We have tech-illiterate bosses who didn't understand why we couldn't develop a videogame for our students every week and once asked me to start emailing our tweets to our followers.  \n\nAbout 3 months ago, our website randomly goes down one day. Immediately, $clickity receives a call from our boss who is irate.  \n&gt;$clickity-Yes, I'm looking into it now.  \n&gt;$boss-WHY WOULD YOU TAKE OUR SITE DOWN!!!! FIX IT NOW!  \n&gt;$clickity-I didn't take it down, it looks like the domain has expired. Did you happen to receive any emails about this? Did you or $otherboss  sign up for this domain? There is probably some information in one of your emails.  \n&gt;$boss-No! I don't know what you're talking about, you just need to fix it now!  \n\nHe hangs up and $clickity does some investigating. Whose name is registered to this domain? $boss of course! So he calls back...  \n  \n&gt;$clickity-$boss, looks like this domain is registered to your name. Are you sure you didn't get any emails asking you about this?  \n&gt;$boss-No! I would have noticed. Why haven't you fixed it yet?!  \n\nGoes back and forth like this until $boss FINALLY remembers that yes, he did in fact handle the domain business last year.  \n\nInstead of asking $boss to search his emails, $clickity goes to his computer and does it himself. But...there are 0 emails in relation to the domain. What? $boss' name is on the account. $clickity calls back.  \n&gt;$clickity-I can't find any email on here...did you sign up using another email address?  \n&gt;$boss-What? Why would I do that?  \n(long pause)\n&gt;$boss-Wait, maybe I did.  \n\nWe are all dying on the inside.  \n\n&gt;$clickity-Cool, with what email?  \n&gt;$boss-I don't know.  \n \nThe problem is, we can't re-up the domain without going through the numerous re-activation emails that have, presumably, been sent to this email address.  \nAfter a long back and forth with $boss, he finally remembers the email but of course! *he doesn't remember the password to the email*  \nAfter walking $boss through the password reactivation process, we're in!  \n\nFinally! $clickity is in and what greets him? Emails going back a *year* asking $boss if he wants to re-new the domain. Facepalms all around. $clickity took control of the account after this.  \n\nThe craziest part? When $boss came to the office later that day, he sits down with $clickity telling him how irresponsible $clickity was and how he can't let it happen again.  \nTotal time of life lost? About 3 hours. \n\nTLDR; Boss forgot to re-up our domain, forgot account details, and then blamed everything on someone who had nothing to with the issue.\n\n",

I received a HelpDesk call from one of our Site Managers regarding our Door Access Control System failing to unlock one of the reception area doors. \n\n\n**Site Manager**: Hey, the door between dental reception and the back office won’t open with the access card.\n\n\n**Me**: Okay. Sounds like the system needs to be reset. I’ll have to come down to the site and do it.\n\n\n**Site Manager**: Can we have someone here do it?\n\n\n**Me**:  No. I’ve tried to walk a couple of people through it before and they can never get it to work. It would be easier if I come \ndown and fix it.\n\n\n**Site Manager**: What are we supposed to do until then?\n\n\n**Me**: Huh?\n\n\n**Site Manager**: How do we get our patients back into the Back Area?\n\n\n**Me** *(Really Confused)*: What? What do you mean?\n\n\n**Site Manager**: The door’s locked so how do we let our patients through?\n\n\n**Me** *(Can’t believe I’m Actually having this conversation)*: The door has a handle right? Turn it.\n\n\n**Site Manager**: So we need to leave the door unlocked?\n\n\n**Me**: Unless they have a release button at the front desk then, yeah.\n\n\n**Site Manager**: I’ll call you back.\n\n\nIt was a tad more involved but you get the gist, I think.  This particular door is kept locked all of the time but does have a standard keyed lock built into the handle that allows for the handle itself to open the door from the lobby with a key or freely from the inside since the Access Control System was added to the clinic a couple of years after we acquired it.",

Just got off the phone for an \"issue\" I get at least once a month that never fails to provide a good chuckle and the occasional facepalm.  \n\nIn order to comply with PCI standards our end users passwords are set to expire every 90 days. Pretty standard stuff. If the end user fails to change their password before 90 days their account will be locked out which leads to a call to **$YoursTruly**.  \n\n10AM rolls around during a relatively quiet morning and I get a phone call from **$NeverMyFault**  \n\n**$YoursTruly**\n&gt;  \"Hey **$NeverMyFault**. How's everything going today?\"  \n\n**$NeverMyFault** \n&gt;\"Are we having email issues? I haven't gotten an email all morning and it's saying something about my mailtips being disabled. What are those?\"  \n\nEmail has been flowing for me all day. No one else working in the office or remotly have complained. All green on the NOC.  \n\n**$YoursTruly** \n&gt; \"None that I am aware of. I imagine you're using Outlook to access your email currently. Have you closed Outlook and re opened to see if that helps?  \n\n**$NeverMyFault** \n&gt; \"Yes I've tried that 3 times already!\"  \n\n**$YoursTruly** \n&gt; \"Okay. As a quick test are you able to log into OWA and access your email that way?\"  \n\n**$NeverMyFault** \n&gt; \"Ummmm. Maybe?.....Hold on.\"\n\nFrantic keyboard pecking ensues. While I'm waiting for **$NeverMyFault** to bring up the OWA web page I connect to one of our DC's and run a 'net user' command against **$NeverMyFault's** account. Sure enough, the credentials expired this morning. \n\n**$NeverMyFault** \n&gt; \"Okay got the page to pull up I think. What's my username?\"  \n\nNow I already know what her issue is at this point so I decide to string her along a bit. Maybe 90 days from now she will remember this call and will follow to correct procedures to prevent this from happening again. *I can dream can't I?*  \n\n**$YoursTruly** \n&gt; \"Your username is your full email address.\"  \n\nPeck Peck Peck on the keyboard. Im sure some of you already know the next question.  \n\n**$NeverMyFault** \n&gt; \"Okay what's my password?\"  \n\nI die a little inside.  \n\n**$YoursTruly** \n&gt; \"I don't know. It's your password\"  \n\n**$NeverMyFault** \n&gt; \"But I thought you could see everyone's passwords and tell us what they are??\" \n\n**$YoursTruly** \n&gt; \"No unfortunately that would be a major security flaw. I can, however, reset the password and let you change it on your end to something you can remember.\"  \n\nI reset her password. Read her off the new credentials and she is able to login and reset her password on her end.  \n\n**$NeverMyFault** \n&gt; \"Okay so what happens the next time my password expires? Is this going to happen again?\"  \n\nOur Mail server sends an automated email to the users accounts that are due to expire 9 days prior to the expiration date. This email includes detailed instructions on how the end user goes about resetting their password and includes the consiquenses for failing to reset the password. I tried to make it as 'fool proof' as possible but we all know how that goes.   \n\n\n**$YoursTruly** \n&gt; \"Have you been receiving the emails informing you that your password is about to expire? You should have received 8 of those emails.\"  \n\n**$NeverMyFault** \n&gt; \"Nope.\"  \n\nNormally I let these lies slide but I had some free time and could sense a little snark **$NeverMyFault's** voice. Accessed her mailbox and sure enough sitting in her 'deleted items' were 8 emails informing that the account was set to expire in 'x' amount of days.  \n\n**$YoursTruly** \n&gt; \"What about the 8 emails in your deleted items folder that say \"Your password is going to expire in 'x' amount of days?\" You didn't get those emails?\"  \n\n\n**$NeverMyFault** \n&gt; \"Ohhhh THOSE emails? I thought they were for a different account.\"  \n\nIm sure I'll be hearing from **$NeverMyFault** 90 days from now.    \n",

Fun times. \n\nBut the receptionist is there and she takes my co-payment, but weirdly the printer isn't printing.  It's a multifunction printer, but standalone, rather than a tiny desktop printer.  (like in an office!) She fiddles around with the top but can't seem to get it working.\n\nNaturally, being a technical guy, I jump in (whether she wants me to or not) and try to help. (but she was ok with it)\n\nWe look around but there doesn't seem to be a power button anywhere on it.  Top, sides, back, nothing.  There is a reset button behind a little plastic door that we try.  No good.  I trace the power cable to the outlet, and it is plugged in.  Nothing else is plugged into the powerstrip and the powerstrip is plugged into the wall outlet.  The powerstrip is on, as far as I can tell.  I try moving the plug directly to the outlet but no difference.\n\nI'm stumped, and the only thing I can suggest is that we try plugging something else into the powerstrip to make sure it's getting power but she doesn't have any electric items to try at the moment.\n\nSo I go sit down, giving up.  A few minutes later another one of the staff arrives, sees the printer is down, and immediately pushes in the plug on the printer itself.  It was loose.\n\nOh yeah.  I forgot that some power cables detach from the equipment.  I've worked with pc's like that for decades and didn't even think of that.  Wow I felt stupid.\n\n",

NOW, 8 YEARS LATER HE IS ONCE AGAIN CONFRONTED BY HIS TGT NEMESIS WHILE WORKING FOR $AVIATIONCOMPANY.  \n\nA BOEING 717 HAS BEEN DISABLED BY TGT ISSUES IN $OUTSTATION AND IT FALLS ON ZEEWULFEH AND HIS (SENIOR) SIDEKICK SHORTY TO SAVE $AVIATIONCOMPANY CUSTOMERS AND COLLECT THAT SWEET, SWEET DOUBLETIME…\n***\n\n*Cue camera sweeping down from starfield to nighttime at $AviationCompany hangar.  A lead approaches ZeeWulf*\n\n&gt;**Lead:**  “ZeeWulf!  Grab your road trip bag and get down to Bay 3 and get with Shorty, we’ve got a 717 with a bad TGT harness in $Outstation.  We’ve chartered a King Air for you guys, it’ll be here in two hours.”\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf:**  “Sweet!”\n\n\nI threw my tools back into their homes in my toolbox and handed my work card over to one of the other guys on my crew.  A few envious techs watched me push my toolbox back down the hall to the area we park them when off-shift and once there, I began the task of transferring tools from their shadowed locations in my toolbox to the homemade labeled pouches in my rolling toolbag while at the same time making the mandatory “Not gonna make it home in the morning…” call to Mrs. ZeeWulf.  Once finished, I threw it on the back of a tricycle and rode down to Bay 3, where I found Shorty, who had already opened the engine cowls on that B717 and was frowning at the printouts from the manual.  \n\nThe 717 is a bit of an odd duck when it comes to aircraft.  It’s actually the DC-95 from Douglas (who merged with McDonnell to create McDonnel Douglas in the late 60s), designed by McDonnell Douglas (who merged with Boeing in ‘97…) and manufactured by Boeing.  It’s shorter than the previous MD aircraft offerings, lacks a tail staircase, and the engines are…different.  \n\nMD went with the Rolls-Royce BR700, a much quieter engine than the JT8s used on the DC9 and MD88 and the V2500 on the MD90.  This engine was also unique in that it has a sort of outer ‘shell’ and an inner ‘core.’  For most engines, air passes through the fan and fan case at the front, and then enters into the core cowl section which can be easily opened up and away to reveal the interior of the engine core and all the exterior equipment, [like on the V2500]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Air-ftd-md90-02-ar-8.jpg).  The [JT8 is one exception]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/WIKI_JT8DPWMDHL.jpg/300px-WIKI_JT8DPWMDHL.jpg) to this-- the case runs the entire length of the engine.  All exterior equipment is mounted on the outer case and enter the core via various fins around the engine.  [The BR700]( https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Engine_BR710-1.jpg/300px-Engine_BR710-1.jpg) is similar to the JT8 as far as the case running the length of the engine, but instead of placing all the equipment on the outside, much is also placed inside the air stream and directly on the core.  It’s all accessed via a handful of hardcover book-sized panels spaced equally around the engine.  \n\nThe plane at $Outstation had reported a TGT failure message on engine start, which with the 717’s smarter avionics system meant the engine would refuse to even start.  Since you’re generally not supposed to fly these things on one engine, we were going to have to fly to some airport in the middle of nowhere to fix it—the contract maintenance guy who was there to change tires or fix little quibbles was way out of his league—we needed a TGT harness change.  I’ve explained how this system works before, in the link given on the scroll above, but I’ll give you a TL:DR version here.  \n\n    Two wires made of dissimilar metals, Alumel and Chromel, connect and \n    form a loop in the area to be detected.\n    As the temperature changes, the metals create an electric charge which \n    then is used as a signal to the computers, which supplies the TGT.\n\nThe harness in question was hidden away in the very core, and there were two ways to access it: the panels or by crawling in through the exhaust. Now, Shorty is small—extremely small.  He was willing to try it, even though seniority dictated I’d be the guy in the tube, but we decided for safety reasons we would only go in through the access panels.  The harness wrapped around the circumference of the core and would require us to work our way around the entire engine, top and bottom, to remove and install.  \n\nNow, astute reader, you may ask yourself *”ZeeWulf, why on earth are you looking at this plane in Bay 3, when you said the issue was on $Outstation aircraft.”*  This plane in Bay 3, my friends, was what we call a ‘donor’ aircraft.  Turns out supply said we wouldn’t see a harness for several days—this plane here had more than enough time to wait for it to show.  Unfortunately, we needed the plane at $Outstation flying first thing in the morning…so we were performing what’s called a ‘rob.’  We crawled up on that plane, pulled out that harness and stuffed it into a box.  And just in case, we also took all the TGT probes, since they were “Known Good.”  After writing up all our work, we met the King Air turboprop outside and flew off to an airport somewhere.\n\n***\nIt was a rather uneventful flight and saw us landing in $Outstation with dawn and the morning flight time rapidly approaching.  We were met by ContractMaintenanceGuy (CMG), who drove us over the aircraft where a couple of GroundCrew (GC1 &amp; GC2) were waiting to assist.  Soon as we disembarked, he hightailed it outta there and left us to our own devices.  We looked at the cowl hanging open, but saw there were actually no work stands for us to use to get atop the engine itself.  We made note of this to GC1, who scurried off while GC2 was stuck out there watching us.  (Airport security being what it was, we didn’t have authorized access to this particular airport’s secure areas, so we needed escort the entire time.)\n\nGC1 soon returned with a belt loader—a small vehicle with a hydraulically liftable conveyer belt—which I crawled up to access the top of the engine.  We set about work immediately, I on top with GC1 watching and handing me tools while GC2 did the same for Shorty down beneath.  While we worked, some [killdeer started its annoying call]( https://youtu.be/-4u6ax5P-o8) to the rising sun.  At some point, I wished that thing would go away or get eaten—I just wanted the annoying thing to stop.  \n\nWe eventually got the harness installed and paid a visit to the flight deck where the pilots had arrived and were conducting their preflight checks.  They began the engine start sequence and we began to congratulate ourselves.  \n\nOf course, this wouldn’t be in TFTS if it worked, now would it?  \n\nThe engine immediately performed a protective start-abort, and we were stuck.  Same error message as before—TGT failure.  Departure time was rapidly approaching, so we ran back outside and started going over the installation. We had to reopen all the panels so we could access the harness, cutting into our much-dwindling time available, and then began checking the contact points where the harness is hooked up to the sensor probes themselves.  Each connection on the harness was a simple flat contact that would be placed on a stud rising out of the probe’s ceramic insulator casing and secured with a nut and washer.  If over-torqued, the nut could cause the ceramic insulator to break and wreck the probe, possibly leading to our fault.  We replaced a couple probes with some of the known-good probes we brought with, re-torqued everything, buttoned the engine back up and ran to the flight deck again.  \n\nOnce more, the engine failed to start.  Departure time arrived, our cargo was still not loaded, and the engines were not working.  We were now Delayed.  \n\nShorty and I ran back outside to the harried soundtrack of that killdeer and switched places, myself crawling into the undercowl area and he checking the top, just to go over one another’s work and see if there was anything missed.  I checked the torque on the probes on the bottom side again, but as I did so I felt one of the harness leads twist, ever so slightly.  \n\nI grabbed a piece of paper and slid it along the wire.  When it got to the bare portion of the harness lead, the paper stopped and would not budge—the harness was shorting the Alumel side to the Chromel side.  I adjusted it slightly and torqued it, told Shorty what I’d found and we checked the rest of the probes to make sure they didn’t have the issue as well.  Up the stairs again, onto the flight deck and instruction for the pilots to try again.  \n\n**Ignition!**\n\nWe signed off the logbook and exited the plane to wait for our own ride out while the loaded cargo and departed—the plane was going back to $TheMothership, opposite direction to $HomeStation.  Luckily, a subsidiary carrier would be arriving shortly and headed next to $HomeStation, so we could hitch a ride on that.  \n\nTired but victorious, we waited for the next plane to arrive.  When it did two hours (of delicious doubletime) later, we noticed a bit of excitement from the ground crew while the cargo was unloaded.  I left the chair and took a look out the window at the plane and saw a red splotch above the captain’s windshield.  \n\nI listened carefully.  The airport was otherwise silent.  \n\nThat gorram killdeer!\n\nAs the little plane landed, the killdeer must have spooked and was now a stain on its fuselage.  To make matters worse…it was a subsidiary carrier, so we would have to wait at least an hour for CMG to show up and maybe look at it, which could take up to another hour.  Which would make *this* plane delayed as well.  \n\nI looked over at Shorty.\n\n&gt;**ZeeWulf:** “Are you thinking what I’m thinking?”\n\n&gt;**Shorty:**  “I’ll make the call.”\n\nFun Fact: It turns out that the Maintenance Control Office for $SubsidiaryCarrier happened to be housed in the upstairs of our $HomeStation hangar.  And we knew the guys up there in passing.  \n\nShorty dialed them up, explained the situation, and within a few minutes they had texted us the necessary references to inspect the aircraft after a bird strike.  Shorty got a bucket of water and a mop and started scrubbing the splotch away while I ran outside and inspected the exterior of the aircraft and engine inlet.  Neither of us found any further damage, reported that to Maintenance Control and received permission to sign off the bird strike.  \n\nFlight Status: On time!  We made it!\n",

I dont work in tech support but have a few tales from being the only tech savy person in the office.\n\nOne day after work I get a call from my manager saying that data in a certain \"database\" ( i use that word loosely because this program isnt built for the purpose its being used for) has gone missing. And if not recovered we have weeks ahead of data entry. I was not impressed so said when im next in ill loom into it and try and recover the data worse case ill sit on the phone with tech support and see what version they have backed up on the server and recover that. Get into work the next day. Load up the program and database. Nothing is wrong with it....a filter was left on and no one (including the university degree flaunting manager) noticed this. Turned filter off all the data is back. I give my manager the biggest are you kidding me face before walking off. ",

I do remote support for a doctor's office, and I swear not a single one of them graduated high school.\n\nAbout 8 months ago, my company put in a nice VDI solution in their office and setup a shared folder that we mapped to all of their accounts. This shared folder was setup to receive all faxes from their big fancy copy machine so the office workers could then copy the faxes to different folders and put them in the medical documentation. When I setup permissions, I tried to make them as basic as possible so nobody had full control over the shares. Unfortunately, in order to modify a file in there, they also had the ability to delete them......all of them.....\n\nI got a text a few days ago that said \"Hey $Firemanz, $receptionist accidentally deleted the fax folder. Can you make it come back?\"\n\nI paused for a second not knowing whether I should laugh, cry, or quit. I logged into the server and checked all the places I could think of and even installed a data recovery program, but to no avail. I could not find the folder or any of it's contents. So I headed over to my backups only to find that all of the VMs and the C drive have been backing up just fine, but my data drive has been failing it's backup for some unknown reason for quite some time. Essentially, there is no backup of that folder. \n\nAt this point I'm in damage control mode. I'm partially trying to figure out how to fix the situation, and partially trying to figure out how to salvage my reputation. I decided to just make a new folder in the same spot with the same name and fill it with some random PDFs I found in some other folders, ensured new faxes were coming through, and then texted the customer that I got the folder back. \n\nIt's been 4 days and nobody has said anything. They think the folder is back the way it was, which also proves they don't look at most of the faxes that go into that folder anyway. ",

        "text": "\"How many times do I have to tell ye?!? The right tool for the right job!\" --Chief Engineer Montgomery \"Scotty\" Scott USS Enterprise NCC-1701 A (Star Trek V: The Shatner Disaster)  \n  \nFirst background: I've been doing IT support off and on for years with friends, family, friends of family members, etc.  Just last year I finally decided to get some formal training.  I'm just about done with my schooling (Internship in January and then home free!).  This just happened this morning as I got to the resource center (library) to do homework.  \n\nA student asked for my help, she had made a pamphlet but when she prints it the second page doesn't print upside down.  I thought it was going to be an easy fix but then I saw what program she had used to make the pamphlet:  MS Word......WHY?!? WHY?!? WHY?!? don't they ever teach these students MS Publisher? I mean it sooo much easier to create and manipulate these things AND it takes care of making sure both pages are oriented correctly when printed.  So I bite my tongue and see if I can just rotate the content 180 degrees.  Nope.  Word won't let you rotate tables.  I think well if this were my printer at home I'd just print the two pages individually reinserting the paper to get the correct orientation, but this is a big laser copier/networked printer and I don't know how the paper gets oriented as it passes through.  So I think, well maybe I can save as a pdf and then manipulate the second page as a single object.  Nope, the school doesn't have the software to manipulate pdfs and I don't have the time to search for a cloud-based editor.  So I try bringing up the word document in publisher, only publisher f's up the formatting and spreads it out over 3 pages.  I'm starting to get frustrated.  Finally I have an epiphany (and believe me it hurt!):  Use the \"snipping\" tool to take a screen shot of the second page and save as a picture.  Word lets you rotate pics.  After making a copy of the document (don't want to screw up her hard work if it doesn't work).  I do this, delete all content on the second page, insert the pic, rotate it and viola it works!   Another satisfied customer, all in a day's work for IT MAN!  (Insert me in super hero pose)  \n  \ntl;dr Student tried to use word for desktop publishing and then ran into problems that would have been fixed either if they had used publisher instead.",

        "text": "Hello folks of TFTS! I'm back again with another story to share but this time at a new job that I have landed and man I am loving it so far! \n\nMy work space is in a big closest like room with PC's and servers and networks of the sort with no windows. Basically I am in a room that is shut off from the rest of the world where users won't bother us since the room is locked with a badge reader that only IT can get into :D\n\nlets just say that with my new job works directly with the Gov't and the military. If I mess something up, folks in black suits in a black van will pay me a visit and ask me to come with them XD\n\nSo onto the story then shall we! \n\nI'm new to the job and learning the ropes for my new job. I was assigned to image and encrypt a huge stack of laptops to prepare for new hires (which they are all done BTW) the imaging and encrypting of the dell latitude E6540's went off without a hitch and chugged along nicely. Now here is the part where I messed up.\n\nThe checklist that I have to follow specifically states for the dell latitude E5570's or later to change certain settings in the BIOS for the imaging and encryption to work. I got the imaging part finished and here is where I ran into the snag that caused the heart attack.\n\nTo get the encryption program to work its a 3 step process (4 for the E5570) you run and install part 1 and restart, for part 2, you had to run CMD as an admin and type in a string of commands for part 2 to install. That is where I ran into my mistake because I installed part 2 without typing in the string of commands  and before I realized my mistake and tried to abort the reboot, the machine reboots and greeted with a boot loop stating the encryption software crashed and failed to load the OS.\n\nSo I hung my head in defeat and rebooted the machine to the network imaging server to re-image the laptop and go through everything again. Once I got to the encryption part, I ran the commands as stated in the checklist and rebooted the machine to be greeted with the encryption software functioning and loading the OS for me. Told my co-worker about the hiccup I had and we had a good laugh from it.\n\nI love reading the tales here on this sub and look forward to post more in the future! ",

Why aren't we appearing?\n\n&gt; **$me:** It just appears that we may not have had as much traffic to that part of the website which brings down our likelihood of searching on the first few pages, especially when specifically for what you're searching for.\n\n&gt; **$User:** Well that's not good enough.

It appears that no one here will be able to bring your part of the website up on the Google searches and this will be something that you will have to discuss with the website-developers *(who are a 3rd party)*.

Due to a reorganisation I now handle Tier 1 tech calls from clients because IT  ~~couldn't handle the stupidity of $clients anymore~~ is more efficient doing Tier 2 and up. \nIt's certainly not because they dislike the helldesk. \nI mean: who doesn't love that part of the job?..\n(I'm also on mobile, so bear with me..)\n\nCalling back $client I open up $application to process some information and get a blank page.\nInternally: \"awesome..\"\n\nAs I ask the customer about his kids and his recent weekend camping trip in an attempt to buy some time, I flick on the mute option, do basic troubleshooting, reload the page and BAM! \n\nNothing.\n\nAs the non existence of a working $application continues to be the perfect metaphor of my equally non existing motivation, I advise the client to get a cup of coffee so I can get all his files in order, e.g. consult with IT to get $application working again.\n\nIn mere seconds I get a godlike voice who we'll refer to as $Frank, cause why not.\n\n&gt; $Frank: \"goooooooodmorning, this is $IT\"\n\n&gt;$Me: \"Hi $Frank, this is $Epic. I've got a problem with $application, care to help?\"\n\n&gt;$Frank: \"sure, buddy! I've got a fresh batch of coffee and ready to tackle anything.\"\n\n(lucky bastard..)\n\n&gt;$Me: \"humor me: is $application running by any chance?\"\n&gt;$Frank: \"lemme check for ya.\" \n\nAfter a minute the mighty God returns, while laughter can be heard in the background.\n\n&gt;$Frank: \"yeah, it should be running fine by now. We had some unexpected downtime after an update and.. Well, long story short: it should be working again!\"\n\nA subtle yet gentle smash on the refresh key makes the beautiful $application appear in my screen. (yay..)\n\nStill, something bugged me.. It's not something for $LargeBank to have this kind of problem..\nI decide to go on a fishing expedition.\n\n&gt;$me: \"Thanks, $Frank. Again: humor me for a second.\"\n&gt;\"did someone just forget to turn $server back on after the shutdown?\"\n\n&gt;$Frank: \"Haha, yeah sure. Nah, buddy. We've got policies in place to prevent such thi..\"    \n&gt;$background: \"He figured it out, didn't he?!\"\nAnd their laughter increased in volume.\n\n&gt;$me: \"Right.. Have a good day, $Frank\"    \n&gt;$Frank: \"Haha, uhm... Thanks, $Epic..\"     \n&gt;\"and please don't tell anyone.. It'll look really, really stupid..\", the god whispers.\n\nTl;Dr \nEvery now and then you forget to turn something on again, after turning it off. Most times it's your dishwasher, a phone or your wife/girlfriend, depending on your (social) skills. Unfortunately, our Tier 2 support forgot an important server.",

For some reason it just sounded thin.  \n\nWe had checked everything in our control.  \nThe lines from the press room to the house interface panel,  \nthe DT (multi-pair audio cable) to the TV truck,  \nand even the input to the mixing board. Everything checked out good.  \n\nFinally it came down to calling the arena audio crew, (who is in charge of the press room), and asking them to check and fix the problem.  \n\nA little while later they came to the truck and had me show them the problem.  \n\nI had my A2 in the press room talking on the mic while we listened in the truck.  \nThey agreed that it sounded thin but they weren't sure it was their problem.  \n\nI explained to them the troubleshooting we did and they agreed that we had taken the appropriate steps.  \n\nThe house engineer suggested that we try the RF mics that they use for the reporters questions and see if they also sound thin. \n \n\nThese mics come to me on the same line as the main press room mic so all our path would be the same as the problem mic.  \n\nMuch to our surprise they sounded great, showing that the problem was in fact the main Press Mic.  \n\nWe tried replacing the mic with a known good mic and the problem remained.  \n\nThe house audio engineer was baffled.  \n\nApparently with the renovation of the arena this microphone was moved from a standard analog audio path to a Dante (digital) path.  \n\nThe house engineer said that it was installed by a contractor and he really didn't know how it worked.  \n\nHe said he would try to get in touch with the install contractor and troubleshoot it the next day.  \n\nUnfortunately that was it, we were stuck using the bad mic. If you were listening to that particular press conference  last week you might have thought, hey does coach sound weird?  \n \nI heard it on a national sports program the next day and it still sounded bad.  \n\nFast forward to last night.  \n\nBack in the arena.  \n\nChecking the same mic.  \n\nExpecting the same problem.  \n\nHowever, it sounded great. No problems today.  \n\nWe proceeded with the rest of our checks and went to dinner.  \n\nAfter the game and whilst in the middle of the press conference I texted the engineer to see what he found out.  \n\n&gt;**Me**: Coaches mic sounds much better tonight. What did you find?  \n\n&gt;**House Guy**: I was able to track down and reset the processor.  \n\n&gt;**Me**: The ol' turning it off and on. Nice.  \n\n&gt;**House Guy**: That is....... exactly what I did.  \n\n&gt;**Me**: I Love it  \n\nIt's not often the solution in my audio segment of broadcasting but in this case it did the trick.",

I hooked as many as I could into this massive switch on this long cafeteria style bench table. Blasted them all at once. It was satisfying as hell to watch all these computers image at the same time. With all the ethernet and chargers and switches it looked like I was trying to rig together a computer hive mind but that kinda added to the satisfaction. It was also one of the rare occasions when nothing went wrong, it just worked. ",

In it there is an old computer controlled lathe. \n\nThe new teacher who took over actually went and found the disks for it and asked me to setup a machine to control it. Now the software was on floppy disks, so I thought nothing of it and went and got a USB powered floppy disk drive.\n\nWrong. Oh so wrong. These aren't 3.5. They are 5.25s. From 1986. Had a right laugh as we realised that even if I found a drive, the system requirements might be an issue. IBM compatible running DOS 1.0 with at least 256k of RAM and a graphics card.\n\nHonestly made my day finding them, along with finding a Western Digital Hard drive, with a serial number of 030. A 32meg hard drive.\n\nToday was a good day for the old tech finds. We're thinking of donating the old lathe to a tech museum of some sort.",

I asked one the other day to start including a specific piece of information, but she hasn't once. The other one, if I send anything back to her she gets insulted / mad. We'll call her Sheila.\n\nSheila sent in a ticket that was basically gibberish. It made sense to her because she was already in the situation / problem. She knew what was going on basically. I was brand new to the situation. I didn't have the information she had. This ticket was worded in an unclear way. She needed help with something specific. Which requires me to know the specific name verbatim. She didn't send me the specific name verbatim. She wrote it backwards and peppered in other pieces of info that made it unclear what she was having trouble with specifically. So I asked. She comes back with, \"I told you in the original email.\" And I am thinking, \"Right, but I don't do your job daily. I have no idea what you are talking about and need further clarification.\" She also wrote she got it figured out and how she was right the whole time and didn't have time to wait on me.\n\nI simply wrote back, \"OK. Glad it's fixed.\" and closed the ticket.\n\nI only have so much time in the day. Three of us handle tickets for the entire company and we are admins on top of that. If every ticket you send me has to be read and re read multiple times so I can decipher the meaning, of course it is going to take me a bit longer. I tried to shorten the time by flat out asking, but she didn't want to help herself.\n\nNext time I will just ask, \"Can you please clarify what you are asking please?\" But she'll still come back mad I didn't read her mind.",

        "text": "Hello TFTS, Bowling Alley Guy is back with a short tale from last night. I hope you have padded your desk, because it is about to become intimately acquainted with your forehead after reading this.\n\n* * *\n\nEverything was going according to plan, or at least as much as things can when you're spending most of your shift sanding contact cement off wooden pit boards and hoping there isn't much to those \"Known by the State of California to cause cancer\" warnings on the side of the can. There was a small league bowling at the time, and the machines were being strangely well behaved. The users however...\n\n&gt;Radio: BEEP BEEP BEEP\n\n&gt;Me: Yeah.\n\n&gt;Radio: I need the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 respotted on 36. The 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 respotted on 36.\n\nRespots are not that big a deal with leagues. You just shut the machines down (and apply LOTO), set up the spare they need, and turn it back on for them. Simple stuff usually. But something seemed a bit odd about this particular one. Something wasn't right. So I of course responded with the upmost professionalism.\n\n&gt;Me: I don't believe you.\n\n&gt;Radio: That's what they said they wanted. Hang on, I'll go double check.\n\nAfter spending a bit of time around the sport of bowling, you begin to spot some patterns in things. One of those things is that you quickly learn what is or is not a normal spare for bowlers to leave. Now, my understanding of the demographics here at TFTS is that most of the readers are much more knowledgeable in computer sciences than physics, but I'm sure that with even a cursory glace at [this pin numbering chart](https://imgur.com/a/V958o) pretty much everyone would have difficulty understanding how exactly one could leave just the 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 pins standing. Well, my suspicions were correct.\n\n&gt;Radio: Respot the 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 on 36. Respot the 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 on 36.\n\nOk, that's a spare I've literally never seen left before, but I suppose it is vaguely possible, certainly more possible than the first one they called back. So I ran down to the lane in question and set up the highly unusual spare for them. Helpfully, $Radio had an explanation waiting for me.\n\n&gt;Radio: So, what happened was they needed any random five pins stood up. Nobody saw what pins where standing before the machine swept them away, so they just said five numbers.\n\nI almost wish I did set up that first one just to see how they'd try to pick it up.\n\n**TL:DR**: Users don't know what they want when they call.",

To simplify workflow, some of my users use PINs instead of passwords for rapid data entry. For the most part, the PIN-based users never need to use their password unless they have to do training, and their PIN rarely if ever changes.\n\n&gt; **$AB:** I'm calling from $loc for $NP. She's trying to login to *the system* and is getting a message saying \"Account is Disabled\"\n\n*Note: The main login errors for our in-house software are \"Invalid Credentials\" and \"Your Account has been Locked.\" Knowing our change management, or lack thereof, it's not impossible that \"Account is Disabled\" is a valid error, but it's unlikely.* **Strike 1**\n\n&gt; **$EM:** OK, well I see that $NPs account is active, and the password was just recently set. I also see that they're a PIN-only user. Is this error happening on a PIN-User's $Pane10 tab, or a $PIN-only kiosk?\n\n&gt;**$AB:** Oh, it's a $FlightlessBird Desktop. \n\n*A PIN-Only user on a semi-fledged Workstation (hence $FlightlessBird) is rare, but not impossible.* \n\n&gt;**$EM:** Ok, let's click on the $FlightlessBird-Specific VNC icon in bottom-left corner...\n\n&gt;**$AB:** Hold on, let me put $NP on.  \n\n*Proceeds to hit speakerphone button and crank volume to the max so that only one word in four is intelligible.* **Strike 2**\n\n&gt;**$AB to $NP in background:** Read him this...\n\n&gt;**$NP:** \\&lt;reads a server name for a different application\\&gt;\n\n**Strike 3** *Permission to treat the witless as hostile, your honor?*\n\n&gt;**$EM:** Do you see $other-$FlightlessBird-specific icon? \n\n&gt;**$NP:** No, it's not showing anything in that quadrant of the screen.\n\n&gt;**$EM:** OK, it sounds like this isn't a $FlightlessBird after all. Do you see the $PIN-kiosk icon in the opposite quadrant? \n\n&gt;**$NP:** Yes\n\n&gt;**$EM:** Click on it, and let me know if anything happens.\n\n&gt;**$AB and $NP playing ~~Chinese Whispers~~ Broken Telephone:** *&lt;IP of an RDP server&gt;*\n\n&gt;**$EM:** Thanks, but that's not what I asked. That's a server over in this building. Do you see the word \"kiosk\" followed by a bunch of numbers?\n\n&gt;**$NP:** It's *&lt;4 digit number&gt;*\n\n*Finally, something that I can work with.*\n\n&gt;**$EM:** OK, I'm in the machine. This is definitely a $PIN-Kiosk, not a $FlightlessBird. What exactly are you trying to do?\n\n&gt;**$NP:** Well, when I put in my code, the system won't take my letters. \n\n*YouDontSay.gif*\n\n&gt;**$EM:** That's because this type of unit needs your PIN, not your password. \n\n*Proceeds to key user's username into the appropriate field.*\n\n&gt;OK, now key in your PIN\n\n&gt;**$NP:** I don't know it.\n\n*Headdesk, apply directly to the forehead.*\n\n*Headdesk, apply directly to the forehead.*\n\n*Headdesk, apply directly to the forehead.*\n\n&gt;**$EM:** OK, let's click on the button that says \"reset PIN,\" and enter your username and password. If you need, I can reset the password for you as well...\n\n*Dear gods, please don't make me have to move these fruitcakes to a desktop so she can do a password reset...*\n\n*$NP proceeds to correct enter her username and password and receives the error \"Your PIN has not been setup.\"*\n\n&gt;**$EM:** OK, looks like you've never used the PIN-Only system before. Let's click on the \"New User\" button instead. \n\n*$NP proceeds to login to the \"Create PIN and set Security Questions\" page in the Kiosk app, and create her PIN*\n\n&gt;**$EM:** Looks like everything's good. Have a nice day.\n\n&gt;**$AB (in background):** Well he was rude.\n\n***\n\n**TL;DR 1:**\n\nBlonde leads the Blonde\n\n'till they're lost in the pond\n\nSpouts majic words\n\nExpects tech to wave wand\n\n**TL;DR 2:**\n\nUsers lie. Two users lie until they're incapable of answering closed-ended A/B questions.\n\n\n\n**EDIT:** Fixed undeclared variables. \n\n**EDIT 2:** Fixed quote formatting. ",

It's effing Monday all over again.  \nLemonade Fan, Steve, and I had *fun* over the weekend with a top-secret project. I've been half-heartedly typing it up because it's long ~~and I'm a lazy bastard~~ but it's entirely possible *someone* is going to beat me to it. So instead, have a bite-size tale from this morning!  \n\nNormally I'm not the last one in the office, but stoplight RNJesus did not smile upon me today. So I rode the elevator with $Bassist after sniping his parking spot, and we talked about kittens as we walked in. But upon reaching my desk I was greeted with a familiar message:  \n**SERVER NOT FOUND**  \n&gt;**$Extension**: Okay, who fcked up this time.  \n**$Greybeard**: Me. Something *always* happens on my birthday. Shouldn't have come in.  \n\nTBF, his birthdays/anniversaries have a history of being left by the wayside, forgotten entirely, or being co-opted by other events like a Christmas birthday.  \n*(Which is why we're having a \"lunch meeting\" with him, with a gif of the Whose Line birthday song - \"this is your birthday song, it isn't very long\" - as the first item on the agenda. It's a running joke here so he'll get it immediately.)*  \n&gt;**$Lemonade**: The phones went down about 30 seconds before you walked in.  \n**$Extension**: Internet working?  \n**$Burrito**: Looks like it.  \n**$Bassist**: I can't hit the main phone system IP.  \n**$Extension**: Bah. I'll head upstairs.  \n**$Burrito**: Field trip!  \n\nIn the end, $Lemonade stayed downstairs to keep an eye on things, and keep our boss $TheAncientOne at bay when he came in. $Greybeard, $Bassist, $Burrito, $Cable (I don't think he's come up in a post yet?) and I headed upstairs to the main offices and poke our heads in the server room. Receptionist arched an eyebrow as we all filed in. (She worked at one of our clients before coming here, and she's awesome. Also has a sense of humor.)  \n&gt;**$Reception**: So you're coming up to fix the phones right?  \n**$Extension**: That's what I'm doing. These losers followed me here.  \n**$Cable**: It's the blind leading the blind!  \n\n*($Cable is my padawan in the bad/dad joke arts.)*  \nAfter punching in the door code, we gathered round the two-post and enclosure. Everything looked functional at first blush.  \n&gt;**$Extension**: *Crap. Which one is it again?*  \n**$Cable**: Lemme pull up the documentation.  \n**$Greybeard**: I think it's this one?  \n\nHe gestured to a lone server on the left rack, the only one not safely nestled in the cabinet.  \n&gt;**$Burrito**: Someone got a monitor?  \n\nWe grab a nearby monitor, left there for this exact purpose, and plug it in.

After verifying everything upstairs was working correctly, we rode the elevators back to our office.  \n&gt;**$Cable**: Wait, the time on the phones is wrong.  \n**$Extension**: Gimme a minute.  \n\nI know juuuust enough about our phone system to be dangerous, so I popped into the interface and found the time/date setting. And after applying changes....  \n&gt;**$Receptionist, IM**: Did the phones just go down again?  \n**$Extension, IM**: So apparently fixing the time takes the phones down...  \n&gt;**$Receptionist, IM**: The More You Know! *(star emoji)*  \n\nTL;DR: It takes 5 techs to ~~change a light bulb~~ fix a phone system, and just one to duck it up again.  \n*edited for formatting, and to remove an image link.*",

        "text": "Greetings. LTL, FTP, SFTP, STFU, TTFN, WWW., HTTPS, IMEI, ISBN, RHCP. \n\nI am by no means tech support, I have been payroll software support (which mainly consisted of saying things like: \"It is wrong because you keyed it in wrong... no, if our software was wrong then our other customers would be saying the same thing...\" a lot) in the past but that is as close as I have flirted with TS in the traditional sense. I am now a systems engineer for an e-commerce company and deal exclusively with cloud based tech, mainly keeping the site up and running and facilitating code deployment. It's been an odd career progression which obviously took in a bit of software testing along the way.\n\nIn my spare time, pre wife and child, I used to enjoy building my own PCs etc. Still do... there's just a lot longer between \"upgrades\" these days. I've built PCs for people in the past, some grateful, some not so much (my brother could be a bit of a d1ck). While I think I know what I am doing, I am by no means a professional. \n\nThis tale of mediocre diagnostic skill occurred many years ago while I was still in university. I was attending a soirée at a friend's house (see: balls to the wall drinking binge, we didn't know any other way) when my ex-girlfriend (who happened to live with my friends.. and to be fair was still a friend... it was just a bit weird) staggered over and in her finest Bristolian accent asked:\n\n&gt;**$EXGF**: \"'Ere!, my computer doesn't work, can you fix it?\". \n&gt;       \n&gt;**$Me**: \"yesh... I can havsh a looknning...\" - I said, half into a mostly consumed can of warm, horrible lager and half towards her blurry face. \n\nWe wandered through the house where a mainly naked girl tottered by desperate for attention from literally anyone and some other people were playing tekken and drinking shots of sambuca each time they lost. I hear the childish whoops of merriment as water balloons were hurled at passers-by from an upstairs window. The place stank of poppers, weed, stale alcohol and water damage from the time one of the lads managed to pull a radiator off the wall. What a time to be alive. \n\nWe retire to her sleeping quarters (see: absolute mess of a bedroom) and I press the power button for the PC... starts up... nothing on the screen... stays running... makes the usual \"I am getting information from the hard drive to load up your OS\" noises... no POST... no clicking... no burning smell... Still nothing on the screen. What the? Maybe this wasn't a ploy to get me into her bedroom after all... \n\nI check the connection between tower and monitor. I check the power cable to the monitor... all fine. The plot thickens... \n\nMaybe it's a broken monitor... I press the power button to switch off the monitor, then again to switch it back on, it does give some sort of indication that it is working by way of a splash screen or something... not the monitor then... she produces another VGA cable:\n\n&gt;**$EXGF**:\"Ere! The man at the shop said to try this, but it hasn't helped. He said to bring it in if it didn't work and he would fix it but you know how to fix computers so I thought I would ask you first\"\n\nI am impressed by her endeavor, the kind chap at the local computer shop had given her the cable free of charge too. I almost feel bad for taking his potential customer away from him. \n\nI survey the tower and the PC appears to be a budget machine likely built from the cheapest possible components by **$PCGLOBE** (a large UK based tech retailer which has since merged with another large UK based tech retailer to form **$MERGEDLARGEUKBASEDTECHRETAILER**... I digress) then sold as \"Going to university\" computers aimed at new students. All very basic stuff, low end processor, just enough RAM to run the OS and write an essay in word, Half a gig HD, floppy drive and about 2/3 USB ports on the all-in-one board... wait a minute... Clearly the 'puter is loading up, it sounds happy enough, but it isn't displaying anything... and this is an on-board GFX card... \n\nIn the past I had built my own PC with a board like this, I'd never experienced this kind of issue before but I did have a hunch.\n\nI ask for a screwdriver. I am handed a screwdriver. Why the hell did I break up with this woman? She thinks for herself, she's done basic troubleshooting, actually has a small toolkit on hand... oh wait yeah, she is utterly mental... Halcyon days like I say. \n\n&gt;**$EXGF**: \"'Ere! [yes, she started every sentence like that... at least that is how I remember her speaking], are you sure you know what your doing?!\"\n&gt;\n&gt;**$Me**: \"Of course I do...**BURRP** ... you can trusht me\" I replied with a smile... \n\nI pry open the case (after switching off and disconnecting the power of course, I was drunk not an idiot) and head straight for the CMOS battery. I prize it out from its little clip. Hold it aloft and say a magic spell along the lines of \"Izzy whizzy let's get busy\" while waiting for any remaining current to drain from the board (the hallowed 10 seconds), put the battery back in, plug the machine back in and switch it on. Hey presto! Windows is loading. I know this because it says so on the monitor. \n\n&gt;**$EXGF**: \"ERE!!! What the fXXk?! What did you dooo?!! You're amazing, oh my god DiscoKiller have my babies!!\" Or something like that... Except obviously not that as I had broken up with her a few weeks prior. \n\n&gt;**$Me**: \"well the problem was that your graphicshh are on-board and what I did was...\" **her eyes glaze over** \"... magic. I did some magic. Can I go and get another beer now? the last 15 are wearing off.. I fancy a game of tekken..\" -- side note: I was shit at Tekken. \n\nI'd figured something had gone awry with the graphics settings which were governed by the BIOS, and given we couldn't see anything on the monitor, the only way to get them to reset to default would be to remove the power supply from the CMOS so it forgot how to be broken. There's probably a technical term for that. \n\nI was inordinately proud of my skills that day - still am. Certainly in the haze of drunkenness from which my eureka moment sprang. \n\nTL;DR: computer with on-board GFX wasn't displaying stuff... removed CMOS battery, replaced CMOS battery, computer with on-board GFX now displaying stuff. \nEDIT: spelling... a couple of words.

        "text": "Hello TFTS! This is a short story (more of a joke than an actual story) but I guessed I could draw a smile in your faces.  \n  \nSo this all happened when I worked for a certain ISP as a tier 2 Tech support representative, frankly I don't know a lot about computers but I kind of defend myself as I have general knowledge about how things work and why they work that way (also, you guys are awesome teachers). Anyway, when It came down to modems, routers and internet speeds I was quite good at troubleshooting since all you have to do is follow some simple formulas of **IF--&gt;THEN** and with a lot of bad luck (got very weird cases), some google-fu and a miserable training I'd like to say I gave good, competent and even above average call support.  \n  \nNow, this is where it gets funny: The *site* was/is located in beautiful Mexico City, and I as a Spanish speaker and born in the language have a rather difficult name to pronounce that let's just say is in \"Nahuatl\" so as soon as I started taking English calls it was quite obvious to me that it would be best for me to change my name, and so, I became known as Sirius and presented myself as that at the beginning of every call.  \n\n  \nSee where this is going?  \n  \nSo, insert Angry Gringo Customer *$AGC*, and *$Me* with a problem of intermittent connection in a very saturated area at the end of the call.\n   \n&gt;*$Me:* Well, as I was saying sir it seems that you have an intermittence problem and the only way we can fix this is by sending a Tech over to check your connections.  \n&gt;*AGC:* But I need this now! I know you can fix it from the phone, they have done that before and I have even have Tech visits scheduled and canceled them since the service was restored!  \n&gt;*$Me:* Yes, indeed sir, as I said before the problem you have means that sometimes the internet will work perfectly fine but then suddenly drop its speed or fall death altogether, right now we checked if you have splitters, your physical connections and I even tried my best to configure your wifi since you don't want to use wires to squeeze out every single Mb out of your 3Mb package, but to permanently fix this we need a tech.  \n&gt;*$AGC:* But you're the Tech!  \n&gt;*$Me:* I mean a Tech on the site, sir.  \n&gt;*$AGC:* OK, but the previous Tech I had scheduled was for tomorrow, I'll need him to be here by five since I work from home and I'm losing money!!!  \n&gt;*$Me:* Since you cancelled that appointment even though you were told you shouldn't I can't guarantee We'll have the date available but I'll do my best to get you an appointment as soon as I can.  \n&gt;*$AGC:* You better do! I'm tired of this **THING**!!!!  \n&gt;*$Me* Well the soonest I have available is *insert date a week from the day of the call*.  \n&gt;*$AGC:* WHAT!!!??? I AM PAYING GOOD MONEY FOR THAT SERVICE *(he wasn't)* AND I'VE BEEN A LOYAL CX WITH YOU FOR 20 YEARS *(also not)* AND I EVEN HAVE HAD A GOOD HISTORY *(strike three, you're out!)*, YOU HAVE TO GET ME A BETTER DATE!!!  \n&gt;*$Me:* Sir, while you were speaking it seems that someone has already taken the available space I offered you. Right now I have this *Insert even farthest away date* for the appointment, would you like to schedule it right now to secure it?  \n&gt;*AGC:* You're **SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING** KIDDING!!  \n  \n....  \n  \n&gt;*$Me:* No sir! I'm Sirius!  \n  \n\n  \n  \n  \nTLDR: trying to schedule an appointment for an angry cx turns to be a golden opportunity to make a good old fashioned daddy joke.  \n  \nEdit: grammar and spelling, sorry if it is far from perfect but not native speaker. Any feedback is appreciated.\n\n",

        "text": "**Background**\nI work for an inbound call centre. During the week last week we moved our SSLs over to a new account so we had control over them as opposed to the person who set them up years ago.\n\nI'm not expected to be on call on the weekends.\n\n**Story**\n7am on Saturday morning my phone starts ringing so I check it - see it's home worker who starts at 8. I ignore it thinking it's something silly and try to go back to sleep. over the next 5 minutes I receive around 10 phone calls, but I'm really tired so just want to sleep.\n\nGet a text from my boss around 10 minutes later after he tries to call me twice.\n\n&gt; **$boss** I need you to call me ASAP. Looks like there's an issue with the SSL certificate.\n\nAfter 5 more minutes of trying to sleep but getting pestered I decide to pick up the phone to my boss. He tells me that when the home worker tries to log in it says there's an SSL error. Which must be because of us changing the account. \n\nI call homeworker:\n\n&gt; **$me** Hi $homeworker, can you explain the issue you're having?\n\n&gt; **$homeworker** When I try to log in to $callhandlingsoftware it says there's a security issue\n\n&gt; **$me** Have you tried just clicking proceed?\n\n&gt; **$homeworker** That's not an option on it.\n\n*Note: the reason this doesn't come up as an option is because the call handling software is in an iframe inside our telecoms system. I get them to run the call handling software in a separate window to bypass this issue for the short term.*\n\n&gt; **$boss** Can you send me the email about the SSL certificates?\n\n*Forward email saying they had moved to another account*\n\n&gt; **$boss** That must be it, it's clearly looking for the SSL certificates and can't find them because they've moved.\n\n&gt; **$me** That can't be it, we don't deal with the SSL for $callhandlingsoftware because it's hosted for us\n\n&gt; **$boss* Are you sure? \n\n*I should probably now mention that the SSL certificates we moved had nothing to do with our call handling software, it was simply for our API*\n\n&gt; **$me** No, it's an issue with $callhandlingsoftware\n\n*sends screenshot to boss while I call $callhandlingsoftware support*\n\nI get through to their support and within half an hour they call back and explain that their network team \"forgot\" to renew our SSL certificate so their support has to contact their network team to sort this out.\n\n&gt; **$boss** This is clearly an issue with $telecomssoftware\n\n&gt; **$me** I've spoken to $callhandlingsoftware, they've told me it's an issue caused by their network team and they're going to have it resolved soon\n\nMy boss then proceeds to \"accidentally\" cc in the support for $telecomssoftware in our conversation and tell me I need to call them, I try to tell him that it's $callhandlingsoftware, he's adamant it's $telecomssoftware, I ignore him.\n\nAn hour later I get the call telling me that the SSL certificate has been sorted and everything will be up and running again. \n\nGot a reply from $telecomssoftware this morning on the ticket my boss \"accidentally\" opened telling him that wasn't on their end.\n\nReally wish I'd just ignored the phone tbh.\n\n**tl;dr**\n\nSSL certificate at 7am on saturday morning because one of our suppliers didn't renew the certificate. Boss comes up with crazy theories and in the end I'm right but missed out on 3+ hours of sleep I really wanted :( ",

Before that I was in retail and thought I understood people. I did not realize users are different.\n\n\n\nStory:\n\nAs with many such calls the initial statement is not helpful:\n\n&gt; $cx: my phone doesn't work\n\nStandard back and forth and we discover that the phone in this case is text messaging. Here's the twist, the phone will only send text messages while $cx is at home. This is fairly new behaviour as the phone was working fine when the daughter of $cx was using it.\n\nWhen I was working with limited information, any new piece deserves additional questioning, and we learn that $cx does not pay for their own plan, they don't make phone calls so aren't willing to pay a cell phone company to have access to those features.\n\nEducation was now required. $cx wants to be able to send txt messages from anywhere and since they can send from home they believe there is an issue with the device. In actuality there are 2 types of messaging, fruit messaging which functions as long as there is an internet connection, and txt messages which function through a connection to a cell network (read needs a SIM). we talk about using data or other wi-fi networks to send messages with fruit messages and nearly every other aspect of communicating with an iFruit product.\n\nThis takes some time to explain but by the end of it there seems to be understanding. There is no issue with the phone, messaging requires some sort of connection, and if you want to message from any location **you need a SIM and a plan**. Mark an internal victory, I have taught a user one more way to use their device and helped improve their tech knowledge!\n\nThen\n\n&gt; $cx: So txt messages only work if I pay for a phone plan.\n\n&gt; $me: yup\n\n&gt; $cx: And international txts can have additional charges, but fruit messaging doesn't care?\n\n&gt; $me: yeah\n\nInner dread building\n\n&gt; $cx: So I can just use fruit messages to contact my daughter when she goes on an international trip in a couple months. I don't need a phone plan at all! thanks bye! *click\n\n*facedesk*\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nconfusion over 2 types of messaging leads to a 45 minute seminar on messaging. One follow up question undoes all of the learning",

I walk in and am immediately pulled into one of the doctor's offices. *Cue getting screamed at for 20 minutes, I am finally able to get them to let me go when I point out that the longer I am \"talking,\" with them, the longer it will take for this issue to be resolved.*\n\nI head back to $Doctor2's office to see if I can get it running correctly. I call the vendor *again* and start working with them to see if we can come up with a process to get this working. \n\n*I find out that the application is not fully compatible with $WindBlows ver. 10. They say that they have seen it work sometimes in compatibility mode, but not all of the time, and there has to be a specific version of Java (on $WindBlows ver. 10) in conjunction with their drivers, application, dongle, and plug-in that is needed to get it to work...if it does work, because, like they said, it is not fully compatible.\n\n*I spend the next 3 days trying to get the rest of the PCs working. I am able to get most of them functional, but there are still a few that are having issues.*\n\nDay 5: *It is now Friday, and 2 days past the expiration time for the 2 day window that they gave us to complete this task*\n\nAfter spending the last week on this and getting periodically screamed at for not fixing it immediately, and I am willing to try anything. I have fixed all but 2 or 3 of the PCs. I reset one of them back to stock...no dice, and I have no other Ideas, so I do a fresh install of WindBlows ver. 10, and it works! I then re-install on the other 2 and got the issue resolved on all PCs. \n\nApparently, something was fubarred with the installation *from the upgrades, that I told them not to do, but they did it to \"save money on upgrades,\" which didn't work out as I spent about 35 hours onsite for this issue and had some of the $SeniorEngineers work on it for a few hours and they get 10 hours of support per month with their contract* and they never notified me that they had any other weird issues which would have led me to that conclusion days earlier.\n\nAfterward: My $Manager gave me an attaboy and went to bat for me when the $Client called up screaming about their massive bill, and went to bat for me. The $Client called me inept, inefficient, stupid, *you name it* and wanted me to never touch their machines again *which ended up causing them more problems, as I had been the only tech at $Company that knew anything about a bunch of their specialty software, so any issues took twice as long because the $Engineer working on it either has to stumble around, call me and get the rundown, or look through my documentation and old tickets,* and it made me giggle/sigh with relief every time that I saw one of $Client's name on a ticket. \n\nI wasn't disciplined or penalized for this, as I solved their issue with no notification or information/help from the $Client.",

He mentioned that he had removed the heatsink from the motherboard to clean the computer.  \n\nI didn’t think anything of it at the time, until I tried to remove the heatsink.  Turns out, on this AMD CPU and Heatsink, the thermal paste had essentially glued the CPU to the heatsink.  So long story short, when the client pulled the heatsink off the mobo, he didn’t notice the CPU stuck to the underside.  \n\nA huge amount of bent pins later, there was nothing we could do to fix it!\n\n&gt;Story 2:\nThe most ridiculous computer that ever graced my hands in my job.\n\nDual Xeons with 64 gb of ram and a 1080 ti. As well as dual AIO liquid CPU coolers.  Multiple terabytes of WD Gold HDDs.  Thing was a beast.\n\nThe only issue was, the GPU was giving errors… Turns out, when I dove into the cabling, the client had missed plugging in one of the GPU power cables into the modular PSU.\n\n&gt;Story 3:\nThe second most ridiculous computer that ever graced my hands in my job.\n\nAll other parts of this computer aren’t impressive.  Single CPU and 32 GBs of ram.  The thing of note, 4x 980 ti.  The worst part of all… the OS was loaded onto a 2tb Seagate mechanical drive!\n\nI don’t like being a snob about these things, but sometimes things don’t add up.\n\n*I think I will be releasing these short stories in groups of 3.  Let me know what you guys think.*",

A small &lt;5 person family buisness.\nThe cast:\n$me : that aussie that wrote this\n$boss: great cabinetmaker, not so great with computers.\n\nSoo one day, around the time windows 8 started kicking around, the $boss complains that his beloved printer wont print from the new laptop that he brought 2 days ago. Now $boss isnt completely dumb, he got the driver disk that came with the printer and tried it, but couldn't get past the step where it asks to insert the usb cable.\n\n$me said \"ill give it a try\". $boss, being optimistic said \" i doubt you can\".\nSo first thing i try, download the drivers from the brother website, and install that version. And i get to the step where it says insert usb for the printer... and nothing happens. \nI proceed to check:\n• is the printer on? Yep\n• cable plugged in to printer? Yep\n• usb port actually works? Tried with usb mouse.\n\nOk, whats going on. The printer was ok 2 days ago, all thats changed is the new windows 8 laptop. The printer drivers say they support Windows 8.\n\nDevice manager: nothing. \"What?\"\n Ok maby the printers usb cable is broke. Switched it a new one. No dice.\nWhen and got my windows 7 laptop. Installed driver and it works? \nSo now  i have a win7 laptop that can print, and a win8 that cant.  So i ask the gargler why does &lt;insert model &gt; not detected in win8. And top result is the driver download page. And sure enough near the bottom is a note \"firmware update may be nessary for windows 8 support\" \n\"oh you have got to be shitting me\" of corse the firmware has to be updated for win8 to see the printer, so the win8 laptop cannot actually update the firmware. One short firmware update later and the printer now works on win8.\n\nTL;DR : firmware update lets printer connect to win8 laptop",

Plenty of simple day to day stuff, plus plenty of muting my phone and asking aloud \"oh god, how are you in charge of IT for a [major corporate or government agency]?\" This one from last week though, it definitely isn't the dumbest or craziest thing I have heard but, it has been on my mind for days. \n\n$client calls in. He has been tasked with updating their entire system from our 2014 version of our solution to our most recent. Nothing out of the ordinary. We have a management server, some supplemental servers, web proxy appliances, and three mail appliances to take care of. Things went sideways at first, which leads me to get the call. Soon, we are working through those machines in the order I just listed them. When the last proxy is booted and ready to go, I turn my attention to the mail appliances. Then I get to take part in this conversation:\n\n&gt; $Me: Okay, so it looks like the last proxy is ready to go. Time to turn our attention to the mail machines. \n\n&gt; $client: Great. I have a PuTtY session open to the first one on my left screen. Can you see it?\n\n&gt; $Me: Yep. Given the version your other machines were on, I need to double check some things on this box before we go any further. \n\n&gt; [*I do a quick once-over on the machine and quickly recognize that this machine, and presumably it's two siblings, will need to be completely re-imaged to in order to take our new version.*]\n\n&gt; $Me: Yep, these servers are not running on the kernel we need for our most recent versions. We are going to need to re-image them, whole process is pretty simple. You can grab a USB image off our download site and--\n\n&gt; $client: No, that... we can't do that. \n\n&gt; $Me: Like I said, it is a pretty simple process. I am happy to talk you through anything that--\n\n&gt; $client: No, it isn't that. I don't have access to those servers. \n\n&gt; $Me: Well, I am happy to work with whoever handles your physical servers and get this issue resolved. \n\n&gt; $client: No... I handle the machines... we never learned where those servers are... Our entire IT team was turned over in the last year and we inherited this setup. Despite our trying, we were never able to find those boxes and have just been dealing with them remotely. \n\n&gt; $Me: ...\n\n&gt; $client: We have checked every building we have access to. We know what every box does that we can find. We don't know where those boxes are. Honestly, at this point, I can't ask where they are. It wouldn't look good for me. \n\n&gt; $Me: Well, to upgrade these boxes, you are going to need physical access. \n\n&gt; $client: Well, can they work in their current version with the updated software?\n\n&gt; $Me: It isn't something that is QA'd or suggested. You will have some issues with backwards compatibility on all systems older than vX.X with those vY.Y and above. \n\n&gt; $client: Well, that's just great. I'll figure it out, I guess.\n\n&gt; [*Call ends*]",

        "text": "First time poster, and I am new to reddit so if there are any gaffes on my part I apologize.  TLDR is at the bottom.\n\n**Cast of characters:**\n\n&gt;$Merc - Yours truly, aka the protagonist.\n\n&gt;$DC - Dumb Customer, aka the antagonist.\n\n&gt;$CW - Co-Worker, aka the comic relief slash straight man in our comedy, he sits on the other side of my cubicle.\n\n&gt;$TR - The Riddler, a Tier II guy who is notorious for never fixing anything and passing up ticket notes that make no sense, hence the name The Riddler.\n\n**Background:**\n\nFor obvious reasons I have to be vague about my company (henceforth known as LC), myself, and my job title.  But to give the reader a brief idea I work at an ISP/video/telephone provider.  I provider Tier III level support to business customers using our phone product.  If there is a confusing issue with our company's SIP phone service it comes to our group.\n\n**Story:**\n\nThis story occurred a couple of months ago and reading through the tales from techsupport brought this to mind.  \n\nMy group works based on tickets that come in through our ticketing system from the Tier II groups below us, so this gives us a chance to review all of the notes, run tests, etc. before contacting the customer.  Usually, we are not calling the customer directly, but rather their IT desk, or PBX Support/Vendor, so usually the conversations are pretty civil and technically orientated.\n\nAbout 2 hours after starting work for the day I finish up a ticket, and dive back into our queue to see what is waiting.  I pull up the oldest ticket and assign it to myself seeing it is for a customer who while they can make outbound calls, cannot receive calls to any of their numbers.  This is not uncommon and so I began troubleshooting as normal by logging into our equipment, starting debugs and then making test calls.\n\nI see why inbound calls are not completing, and although it is obvious to me that the customer probably changed something on their side I adjust our equipment to match what the customer's equipment is now wanting.  I make a test call and speak to the customer's receptionist who confirms that yes indeed calls are completing.  Certainly not the hardest ticket ever, but also not the easiest ever.  \n\nAnother success, yay!  The most satisfying part of my job for me is to gather all the bits, run the tests, and then put the toys back together so that they all play nice.  Having a happy customer to me is gravy, but is not the main satisfaction.\n\nSo there is only one last thing to do.  Call the Point of Contact (aka DC) and let them know that the issue is fixed, and get their blessing to close out the ticket.  \n\n**Phone Call with DC:**\n\n&gt;$DC: Hello, this is DC with Widget Factory.\n\n&gt;$Merc: Hello, this is Merc with LC technical support calling in regards to your ticket for inbound calls failing.\n\n&gt;$DC: Yes, I just spoke with the receptionist and she said it is working now.\n\n&gt;$Merc: Excellent, I was just following up with you as you are the PoC on the ticket.  \n\nI then provide a brief explanation of the problem and what I did to fix it.\n\n&gt;$DC: OK, that is all well and good, but how do I know that is the correct fix.\n\nAt this point everything came to a screeching halt in my head as I was in wrap up phase, and I had to replay exactly what the customer has just said.\n\n&gt;$Merc: Well...  I guess you know it is the correct fix because it is working now....\n\nAt this point $CW, who can hear all of my convo's (it is only about a 4 ft cubicle wall so there is no real privacy), hears me, and pokes his head over the wall giving me a WTF look.  It is pretty obvious at this point that this customer doesn't understand how any of this works.\n\n&gt;$DC: The last guy I spoke to from LC thought he could fix the problem, but it didn't work.\n\nMe glancing at notes and processing for the fist time that she spoke with The Riddler before me.\n\n&gt;$Merc: I apologize that the previous rep couldn't fix your issue, but that is why he escalated to me.  I can tell you that you should be good to go from here.\n\nI mouth to $CW, \"The customer got Riddled.\"  $CW rolls his eyes as $TR is notorious in our group for being an idjit.\n\n&gt;$DC: I don't understand, he said he could fix the issue, but couldn't.  How do I know that this is the correct fix?\n\n&gt;$Merc: (rolling eyes fit to detach retinas) As long as there are no changes made everything should continue to work with no issues.  And since you are getting calls I am sure we have the correct fix.\n\nAt this point $CW is cracking up because he knows me well enough to know I am struggling with $DC.  I really want to tell $DC that the previous person she spoke with from LC was an idiot and he couldn't troubleshoot his way out of a wet paper bag, and tell her to get off my phone.\n\n&gt;$DC: Well I want to know why the previous LC guy couldn't fix the issue, and to find out exactly what he did.\n\n&gt;$Merc: OK....  I can send the ticket back to $TR and ask him to follow up with you about this.\n\nI'm not really sure what good that will do, but whatever....\n\n&gt;$DC: OK, well I guess that will have to do.\n\nSo after hanging up with $DC I send the ticket back to $TR's queue asking him to follow up with customer, instead of closing out the ticket in triumph.  At this point all the satisfaction of another issue fixed is gone, leaving me wondering how did I go wrong in fixing the customers issue.\n\nIn retrospect, its possible that $DC may have been fishing for credits, but I think mainly she just couldn't seem to comprehend that I had fixed the issue.  Also, while $TR is an idjit you wouldn't immediately know it by talking to him, especially if you are non-technical yourself.  It may have been that since I sounded a couple of decades younger than $TR (which I am) she didn't believe I could have fixed the issue where older and wiser (insert derisive snort here) heads had failed.\n\n**tldr;** Fixed customer's inbound call issue.  Customer did not believe I fixed the issue despite all evidence that it was working.  Customer asked to find out why the idiot who escalated the ticket to us couldn't fix the issue.\n\n**Edit:** Formatting helps.",

At our site we have a number of standalone computers that are super locked down for security reasons, no netowork, no file creation for standard user, ect. I walk into the office, a maintenance office, and the computer is on the desk as per usual. I press the power button... nothing happens. No BIOS no nothing! I change the power cord and press the power button... nothing happens. I unplug the computer and take it back to the office.\n\nNow this computer has a special image on it as I have stated earlier. It has no network capacity, no unauthorized programs, no file creation, ect. We called it Super Locked Down Image. I go onto the netowrk to find a copy of this image. I eventually find it on the National HeadQuarters server and download it. I go into the storage room and find a computer that we can spare for this use. Burn the image onto a disk. I start the imaging process and go home.\n\nThe next day I get in, go to the daily management meeting my boss says we need to go to. I walk into the IT office and sit at the workbech to check in and the imaging process is stuck. Restart the imaging process... stalls out. Try again... same result (Didn't Einstien say something about insanity, and doing the same thing over and over?) Eventually I find out that I need a specific model of computer, one we are currently lifecycling out of commission. I go to the back and look through all the old computers for one of the right models. I eventually fond one... and start imaging. You guessed it, time for home. Let's image this thing overnight and deal with it later. There is no OT on this job, it's not that high a priority anyway.\n\nNow to this point it has been about a month, like I said low priority project. The computer is finally working though. I take the computer back out to the maintinance office, set it all up, plug it in and POOF. A cloud of smoke comes out of the power supply. I press the power button, but I know what I'm going to get... nothing. I look at the maintinance guy and he says he'll look at it and call us when they know what the problem is with the plug.\n\nWhen I get back to the office my boss calls the head of the maintinance department and they agree, I'll not go back untill they know what happened. I now know how to image this maching so I make a new one and put it at my desk and wait. And wait. And wait.\n\nIt's been a couple of weeks and we get another call. I go back to the maintinance office and plug the new new computer in and start it up... IT'S ALIVE! The machine powers up and the end user can start working on it again. I ask the maintinance guy what was up and apperantly that someone wired half of the plug to 220v!\n\nLessons Learned: Make sure the Electrition doesn't carry a grudge!\n\nTLDR: Idiot wires his computers power plug to 220v",

Today's story involves email and a built in contact form that isn't really great, but in this instance wasn't an issue. The contact form is rather simple, they can create a form with a special in house builder and then have it set to send any submissions to a specific email of their choosing. \n\nCustomer will be Cx\n\nI will be me.\n\n\n&gt; Me: Hello, this is mmon, how can I help you today?\n\n&gt; Cx: Hi, how do I know if someone has emailed the site?\n\nSo right off the bat, and I am confused. But I know at the very least that this could be one of two things, either he is talking about an email link he placed on his site, or he is talking about a contact form on his site and wondering about that. Either way, the answer would simply be that he gets an email from the customer in his email box. \n\n&gt; Me: I can certainly answer that, you would know when you get an email in your email box.  \n\n&gt; Cx: yes, that is my question.. how would i know??\n\nWait.... seriously? Is this guy trolling me? I decide to take a look at his site and check to see if he is talking about a contact form or a email link, to at least get a grasp of the situation. He has no email link on the site, so he must mean his contact form. Good, maybe now we can get somewhere. \n\n&gt; Me: Exactly what I mentioned before. you would get an email from our system directly that would be the submission.\n\n&gt; Cx: where would the email be sent?\n\n&gt; Me: It gets sent to the email that you set up initially when you first started the site. To change/check the email address go to (x) settings and follow (x) directions. \n\n&gt;CX: what page with the form?\n\nHoly shit...he must be trolling....To elaborate he indeed has a page on his site called \"contact\" and when you go to it, there is a contact form set up. I guess i will just clarify with him.\n\n&gt; Me: You are talking about your contact form correct?\n\n&gt; Cx: you wrote \"go to your page with the form\" what were YOU talking about?\n\nDear....\n\n&gt; Me: The contact form on your contact page, where they would send you the submissions.\n\n...God....\n\n&gt; Cx: what contact page, what are you talking about?\n\n....Help me!\n\n&gt; Me: You have a contact page on your site. It's one of your pages.\n\n&gt; Cx: oh on the site... ok i will go look\n\nYES! ON THE SITE BUILDER THAT YOU ARE ASKING A QUESTION ON!\n\n&gt; Cx:  that page doesn't tell me what the email addy is\n\nHe is either not reading a word I say, or he is truly trolling me.  \n\n&gt; Me: You have to follow my instructions above to find that out and change it if you need to.\n\n&gt; Cx: ok\n\nCx does that for awhile, I think...\n\n&gt; Cx: so can you see if anyone has emailed the site?\n\nAt this point I lost it and am laughing hysterically at work. There is always a time to be blunt, and now is that time:\n\n&gt; Me: I wouldn't know because I have no access to your email. If someone sends a form through your contact form, it's going directly to your email. The email you have set up is: xxxxx@xxxx.xom \n\nThe customer goes quite for a bit, so I ask if he needs more time as required by my company. \n\n&gt; Cx: NO THANKS, BYE!!!!\n\nCx disconnects the chat.

        "text": "I think all of my stories will end up having morals to learn from.  One long story and one short anecdote at the end.  Always be humble and don’t be afraid to admit when you are wrong.  Working together makes life so much easier.\n\n\n*After writing my first post, I remembered this gem that just happened.  I enjoy working with my coworkers, but $head is the head technician and is kind of a know it all who acts like everyone else is beneath him (WE ALL know someone like this)*\n\nCast of Characters:\n$Me\n$Head: head technician (know it all)\n$Low: low guy on the totem pole, kinda gets the crap jobs all the time\n$Manager: our service manager, great guy, get along great, but not the best technician\n\n\n$Head finishes a diagnostic on client’s desktop.  Determines that the GPU is bad and needs replacing.  \n*Then*\n$Low works with the customer and comes up with a whole laundry list of upgrades the client would like to do.\n*Next*\nThe family comes in and $Me helps them buy everything they need, almost $600 worth of upgrades.\n*Finally*\n$Me leaves everything on $Low’s desk because it was his baby so he should be the one to assemble it and mess around with all the new goodies.\n\n\nFast forward to the next day, I come in around midday to see $Low and $Manager both agonizing over this client’s desktop.  Turns out, every time they put the new GPU in, the computer won’t post.  It posted fine when $Head did the diagnostic, so they are confused and scared because $Manager doesn’t want to do a $600 return.\n\n\n$Manager knows $Me am good at these sorts of problems and asks me to look into it.  After trying the new GPU (a gtx 1060), I couldn’t get the damn computer to post.  Went and grabbed an old GPU (550 ti).  The cursed computer posted fine with that GPU.  So I try multiple other GPUs and curse and curse.\n\n\n$Me decides to let my fingers do the walking and do what every good technician does.  Go on Google.  On the motherboard’s website, I notice that the AMD Mobo that the client has takes both FM2 and FM2+ cpus.  Turns out the FM2 cpus only support PCIe 1.0 and 2.0, but the motherboard does support PCIe 3.0.  This is only with FM2+ that the mobo supports PCIe 3.0.  Unfortunately, the client’s CPU is FM2.\n\n\n$Me goes and tells $Manager the good/bad news.  The good news is the solution might just be a new CPU, the bad news is that $Head was wrong and the client will have to pay for another upgrade.\n\n\nThe hypothesis I made is that the new PCIe 3.0 GPU is causing the motherboard to select PCIe 3.0 bandwidth, but the FM2 CPU can’t support it.  This causes a loop of incompatibility.  I was pretty pleased with myself.  It was at this point that $Head got a little pissy.  \n\n\n$Head:  “No, no, no, that is not possible.  PCIe 3.0 is backwards compatible.”\n$Me: “Yeah I know, but it is what it is.  That’s where the evidence leads.”\n$Head: *bangs hand on desk* *growls*  “God damn it.”\n$Me: “Dude, it’s not that big of deal.  We just need to get another CPU to test the mobo.”\n$Manager: *trying to calm down $Head*  “We need to eliminate the possibility.  $Head please come look at the computer.”\n\n\n*$Manager and $Me exchange a knowing look as $Head huffs and puffs his way over (he isn’t fat or anything, he was literally huffing and puffing over having to leave his youtube videos)*\n\n\n$Head finishes doing everything $Low and $Me did to try and get the system to post.  He comes up with nothing except must be a bad motherboard.\n\n\nThe story ends fairly anticlimactically, with $Manager ordering the processor and $Low installing it.  The new CPU and GPU now get the motherboard to post.  Customer came and picked up.  I guess according to $Low, they were extremely happy.\n\n\nNever heard anything about this from $Head.  I may or may not have jabbed at $Head a few times, gloating about my victory, but it was all in good fun.  $Head didn’t even look up from watching his youtube videos.\n\n\n*I know I shouldn’t be so happy about trouncing the head technician so much, but sometimes, an insufferable know-it-all is most annoying when he or she isn’t right 100% of the time.  The only time a know-it-all works is when they know everything.*\n\nHeck, I’m willing to admit when I’m wrong even begrudgingly.  \n\n*Example being, one employee that is lower on the totem pole than $Low (lets call him $Newbie) was talking with me about another client’s desktop.  I was lamenting that the GPU was hitting over 100 degrees C.  I couldn’t get it any lower even when pointing a desk fan at it.  In passing, $Newbie just said, “Did you try blowing it out with the air compressor”.  I had to stop and laugh for a second.  The simplest solution, the most elegant solution.  I went and blew it out.  A dust bunny in the shape of the fan popped out.  I ran over to $Newbie and thanked him for his solution*",

        "text": "A slight twist on the usual post perhaps, as I wasn't working in PC tech support, but I feel that it fits. The job was setting up AV installations, TV screens, sound systems and other such things. \n\nThis particular tale sees me working on a fairly small exhibition in Paris. We arrived from London with a van full of equipment and work late in to the night getting it all set up. Bed at 1:30am, up at 6am for the show. The show was for some art/design creative type companies.\n\nThe call comes in, go to this stand number, they've need help with the TV. Off I trot.\n\n&gt;Me: Hi, I'm here about the TV, I hear you've been having some trouble. What is it that you need help with?\n\nClient stares at me for a few seconds, then turns to her friend and starts a conversation with her friend. Normal behaviour for expo clients, so I just start checking the usual things, everything is plugged in, they have a remote.  They're trying to run a slideshow of images from a USB stick. I realise the TV isn't recognising any files on the stick at all.\n\nThe good thing about modern TVs is that they will play all sorts of content straight from a USB. The bad thing is that they're incredibly fussy about file types. This expo being filled with so-called creatives, there is not a PC in sight, only macs. The tvs just don't like .tiff files, or anything besides jpegs. Hopefully that's it. I explain this to the client, and stick the flash drive in a laptop to convert the files.\n\n&gt;Me: Ahh, there's your problem.\n\n&gt;Client: What?\n\n&gt;Me: You've just put a blank memory stick in the TV. There need to be files on the stick for it to be able to display them.\n\n&gt;What the client should have said: Opps! Silly me, here the pictures are in that folder, could you please copy them across?\n\n&gt;What the client said:No. I was told I could just plug in a stick and it would work. This is totally unacceptable, I've paid good money for this TV and I expect it to work.\n\nI had to listen to that sort of talk (you won't get paid for this, I'll make sure you get fired for this, etc) whilst copying a few hundred photos across before putting them on her screen, wishing her a good day through very gritted teeth, and disappearing in to the crowds.\n\nAV tech - The equipment might be different, but the users are just as... problematic.",

        "text": "Note: inner monologue in bold\n\nMy non-technical supervisor likes things done his way.  It doesn’t matter if there’s a better way, an “industry standard”, or “best practices”.  All that matters is that you followed his directions closely and that those directions were the solution to whatever the problem of the day was. \n  \nFirst thing on a Monday morning I get a ticket from my supervisor saying a printer was acting up.  This just so happened to be the printer he mainly used.   At first glance it looked like an Enterprise grade MFP(Multi-function printer) without the cart/base siting on a table and it just happens to sit right next to an actual Enterprise grade MFP.  By the way this part of the office by the way is home to only 7 or so people, they were the only ones using the printers. \n  \nSo I pull up the printers info.. $1,700.00, 10 years old and amazingly according to our records it’s never had a maintenance kit. \n  \n**Huh, that's odd..**\n  \nIt’s painfully slow but I log in to the jet-direct landing page and I start poking around ....eventually.. no errors listed **Huh**, and then I see the page count… 27,000 and change.  I really couldn’t believe it... How in the F could a 10 year old printer only have printed 27,000 pages, and useless info #1 it's document feeder had only scanned a few hundred pages...\n  \n**That's... odd.. What a waste, kind of sad.**\n  \nUnfortunately soon after the printer became unresponsive and just a short few power cycles later the pricey desktop mfp was no more.  I'm pretty sure it was the main circuit board dying.  Unfortunately ebay'd parts were not available at a reasonable price. \n  \n&gt; Me:  Sorry boss it looks like your printers dead, we're going to have to replace it.\n \n&gt; Super:  Are you sure? \n  \n&gt; Me:  Yep, it's cheaper and it would be much faster to just get a replacement.  It honestly was overkill and very under utilized anyway.  I've never seen a 10 year old printer with such a low page count, let a lone one that cost $1,500.00!  Whoever ordered it could have gotten away with a $400.00 printer at the time.   In fact we could replace it for around $150.00 really since faxing and scanning weren't used on it. \n  \n&gt; Super: I ordered it, and it in fact it was NECESSARY! A $150.00 printer isn't going to work, the quality is to low.  Order a replacement for at least what we paid for it 10 years ago.  It needs to have a document feeder and be able to send faxes.\n  \n**Well shit.**  \n  \n&gt; Me: If that's what you want I'll send you options before the end of the day.  I'm not trying to be rude here but.... why do we need a printer like that when you already have a high end MFP that only a handful of people use a foot away from it?  \n  \n&gt; Super: *Sighs*  As a reliable backup in case the other printer stops working. *.......*  \n   \n**Oh, in that case the high end MFP we have a service contract for with a 4 hour SLA(service agreement with Repair Co.) has an issue, that gets maybe 5 or so faxes a week.  FFS we don't even have any spare parts for any of our servers but we need to have a spare printer**  \n  \n&gt; ME: Well if it's faxes you're worried about, worst case we can just have the fax number forwarded to our main fax number.  \n  \nThe main fax number automatically converted faxes to email, where a receptionist would forward it to wherever it needed to go.  \n  \n&gt; Super:  *SIGHS*  We get critical and confidential information faxed up here.  We need to ALWAYS be able to receive our customers confidential faxes in this office and that means having a spare capable of handling the load.  \n  \n**Hurt pride, spite?...FFS wtf is this?**  \n  \n&gt; ME: Alright I'll have options and pricing available in a few hours.  \n  \nLong story short there were no $1,700.00 printers available that met the requirements(I've left a few requirements out and surprisingly some of the $500ish printers didn't work with linux print queues).  What I considered to be the best option was around $300 and because I knew he was going to go with the most expensive option I made sure to only give cheaper alternatives with the options I sent him.  \n  \n&gt; Super:  What the hell is this?  Is this a joke?  There's no way a $300 printer is going to compare to what we had.  \n  \n&gt; Me: Well you're right, the older printer was of a higher quality build wise, but that's just how it is now.  Printers have become disposable, these are the best options available other than going with a second enterprise grade MFP.  \n  \n&gt; Super:  You have to be kidding me.  \n  \n**Student loans... Student loans... Paycheck to Paycheck... don't f'n lose it**  \n   \n&gt; Me: You're free to check for yourself.  The cheapest one is probably the best option!  \n  \n&gt; Super:  The #300 one.  How big is it.  \n  \nI shit you not he made me get a measuring tape and show him the dimensions of it on the table.  \n  \n&gt; Super: Well that's pretty discouraging.  *SIGHS* Go with the $300 one and we'll test it.  \n    \n**Called it!, Fuck you, you manic POS.. Fuck you!! Student loans, Student loans..**  \n  \n&gt; Me:  Sure.  \n  \nI order it and a few business days later it arrives.  Truth be told it's no where near as visually impressive as the old one, considering the price difference it really isn't surprising.  \n  \n**Welp!!**  \n  \nI configure and test it.  As per the specs it works perfectly for our needs.  \n  \n&gt; Me:  So it's all setup and seems to work perfectly for our needs.  \n  \n&gt; Super:  Really?? *Sighs*.. I seriously doubt that.  Ok.. print out a test page and show me.  \n  \n**Erm.. What really??**  \n  \n&gt; Me: Ok....    \n  \nI present the test page to my beloved boss and he treats the page as if he was a wine snob sampling the bargain bin.  Running his fingers over the text, scraping his fingernails over the graphics, all while raising one eyebrow and a look of disdain on his face.  \n  \n&gt; Super:  It's too light... The print isn't dark enough..  The VP's getting up in age and the printer I Purchased printed it's text much darker, the font was much clearer and easier to read.  \n  \n**What the ever loving fuck**  \n  \n&gt; Me:  Uhm.. did you have the quality turned up or something on the old printer....??  \n  \n&gt; Super:.. *Chuckles*.. No, everything was set to default.  It met all of our needs out of the box.. no need to fine tune it.  \n  \n**You seriously are a piece of shit**  \n  \n&gt; Me:  Some newer printers default to economy mode.  I'll turn up the quality.  \n  \n&gt; Super:.. Go for it *Chuckles*.. We'll just get \"Enterprise MFP Vendor\" in to replace it probably.  At least the printer you picked was cheap, maybe we can find another place for it.  \n  \n**Whatever**  \n  \nSo I turn all of the quality settings up and force it to practically print everything in bold... Looks stupid to be honest.  \n  \n&gt; Me:  Ok Super.  I turned up the quality settings on it.  It was set to a mid range so now there's a pretty big difference.  \n  \nAfter handing the test page to my Supervisor he did the same song and dance with rubbing the text and scrapping the toner with his fingernail.  \n  \n&gt; Super:  It's better but it's still lighter than what the old printer did.  Change the settings to print at a higher quality.  \n  \n**Fuck you dude, seriously... You Manic Piece of shit**  \n  \n&gt; Me: OK....  \n  \nSo I go back to my desk and pretty much say fuck it... I know I've already maxed out everything and I just fucking wait and mull it over.  At this point I'm done... I know there is no other setting that printer has to offer to make the text darker or bigger.  I think to myself... there's no F'n way I'm going back and saying there is nothing else I can do.. That would make him win and I'd be admitting defeat.. so No.... I decided that I wasn't going to change anything and I'd print a second test page that was exactly like the last one in every single FUCKING way and see what he says then.  On top of that I'd do a test page from the Enterprise grade MFP and give it to him to compare....  I couldn't do it right away though.. I'd have to wait.. If it was too quick it would look like I rushed it and gave up... No.. I'll wait a good hour or so to make it seem like I scrutinized every setting this $300 printer had to offer and then I'd hand the test pages over.  \n  \n&gt;  Super:  What's this?  \n  \n&gt;  Me:  It's the last test page, the new test page, and a sort of control test page from the Enterprise grade printer.  \n  \n&gt; Super:  Ah... So which test page is the most recent one from the new printer?  \n  \n&gt; Me:  The right most one.  It's fresh off the printer so it should be warm.  \n  \n&gt; Super: Ohhh.. I see.. Yes it's actually darker than Enterprise MFP.. That's surprising... And a big improvement from the last test page.  \n  \n&gt; Me:  Yes, I agree completely.  Found an extra setting or two......  \n  \n**Fuck you, you cunt**  \n  \n&gt; Super:  Ok... You've convinced me.  We'll give it a go for awhile and see...  \n  \n**Called it**  \n  \n&gt; Me:  Ok great!... Looks like we saved a good bit of money.  :)  \n  \n&gt; Super:  Yea...  \n  \nSo I won.  I think.  \n  \nThe printer stayed there until I left.  I was there for another 3 years or so and he never mentioned the printer again...  I truly hope that every single time he used that printer that it made him uncomfortable using something he didn't have control over.\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n \n  \n\n ",

        "text": "*First time poster here and I am not sure how to best format this post.  Be gentle and always be nice to Service Techs!*\n\nThis happened about 6 months ago.  Essentially, I am a support technician for a small repair and sales shop.  A customer dropped off a major desktop brand's gaming version and wanted a diagnostic done.  This was because the computer was crashing during video games.  Fast forward again, RMA'd a bad hdd in the client's desktop, and got it done in an epic amount of time (under 3 days turnaround for the RMA).  Couldn't get the computer to crash again so I closed it out and the customer picked up.\n\n*At this point, I had forgotten the customer had dropped off a monitor to go along with their computer.  The reason I forgot is that it is literally one in a thousand tickets where the customer needs to leave the monitor for a real reason.  It was my bad*\n\nI did the right thing and fessed up to forgetting.  I called the customer and informed her that we still had their monitor.  \n\nThis is when the woman turned nasty.  I guess her son has disabilities so she was irate that her son wasn't going to get to play his desktop until she picked it up.  \n\nShe made it extremely clear that she is in a job where she can't come in on most of our days that we are open.  I apologized, but there isn't much we can do in this regard.  So to make a long story shorter, I had to undergo about 10 minutes of this customer berating me about what a terrible thing I've done.\n\nAt this point, I heard the client say that she spent so much money on the gaming monitor, just to have us forget it there.  I immediately said, \"Hold on, you mean a very old and busted up samsung monitor right?  Because that is the monitor I am referring to\".  She paused and said, \"It's not a 27\" gaming monitor from blah blah company?\", \"No ma'am it isn't\".\n\nI am floored at this point because the lady immediately changed her tune.  She acted like 10 minutes of harassment just never happened.  She then started to gather her steam of rage back together after this little speed bump.  I was still reeling from realizing that the past 10 minutes of my life, which I'll never get back, had been for nothing.\n\n*I try my best to not be rude to customers, even when they are totally rude to me.  I don't always accomplish this goal because I am proud of my abilities at work and get offended when someone takes me for granted.  I know, not the best reaction, but it's who I am.*\n\nIt's at this point I interrupt the customer (in the nicest way I have) and say you'll have to find another time to pick it up.  Sorry for the inconvenience.  Have a nice day.  CLICK (proceed to rage for the next five minutes trying to recover composure).\n\nA few days later, customer's husband brought computer back in because it was still crashing.  I sent the computer into the manufacturer and got them to expedite the RMA again.  All for this thankless, &amp;*%&amp;$ of a customer.  The manufacturer in question, replaced the client's failing 1070 with a 1080 as a way of apology.  I refused to contact the client again, even though, in my opinion, I did a job that went above and beyond by getting things fixed quicker than usual.  I should be happy for a job well done, but this one phone conversation ruined my interaction with them.\n\nTo wit, I never got an apology from the woman, even though she was clearly in the wrong.  Even when she picked up the desktop, and I explained the free upgrade she got, she was as nonplussed as someone getting a donut.  I understand each individual person has their own issues and reacts to sales and support people differently, but this whole mixup boggled my mind.  Remember everyone, if you act like a complete *blank word* to a service person, maybe try an apology.  You'll find your interactions with them changed for the better after that.",

        "text": "Tuesday was a regular day for me. I am working remotely and live almost 2 hours away from work. At 11:02am, this chat began between my boss and me:\n\n&gt;Boss: Please monitor all systems. Alarm system fired in server room\n\n&gt;Me: I can't get on firewall\n\n&gt;Me: I'm off vpn\n\n&gt;Me: You still have internet?\n\n&gt;Me: Do you mean the fire alarm went off?\n\n&gt;Me: Or other alarm\n\n&gt;Me: Still can't get on vpn\n\n&gt;Me: I was hoping to be able to get on via X2 or X3, but I still can't get on VPN via any WAN interfaces.\n\n&gt;Me: $TaskServer seems to be working; just got an email generated by it. so $SMTPServer must also working\n\n&gt;Boss (8 agonizing minutes later): Fire\n\nTurns out... our data center fire alarm was getting tested today! And the company that installed it had one of their techs come out to do the test. \n\nMy boss was in the server room escorting him when it happened. Normally they disengage the solenoid from the suppression system when testing, but he must not have done it right. They heard a weird hissing noise... like something was charging. \n\nNow, since our server room is NOT sealed, we can't use systems that remove oxygen from the air. We bought a new fancy suppression system that will basically atomize a gallon of water for a 12'x12' space distributed by a tank of pressurized nitrogen. This distributed water is safe to breathe, safe to suck through fans and all equipment, and totally kills fire. \n\nWell guess what? the Cisco ASR 1000 router that provides our primary internet (that we all go through to get to firewall for VPN) didn't like all the moisture and rebooted itself (maybe it shorted? dunno). Hence, it took like 15 minutes for me to be able to get back onto VPN. It also was making weird fan noises.\n\n$Boss described it as a very thick fog that cleared after a minute or two.

As an aparent work around, the printer was mapped directly. Turns out, the driver was corrupt or wrong and when $DirectorMan went to print, hundeds of pages would print random jargon. $Einstein picks up the ticket, scratches his head and messages $S420M.\n\n&gt; $Einstein: Hey man, $DirectorMans' printer is printing crazy stuff. $AnotherOfOurTechs has already said its probably setup wrong and I need to remove and re-install the drivers.\n&gt; \n&gt; $S420M: OK. And?...\n&gt; \n&gt; $Einstein: It happened again.\n&gt; \n&gt; $S420M: Well did anyone make any changes to $DirectorMans' printer?\n&gt; \n&gt; $Einstein: We didn't make any changes to his printer. I dont know if anyone at $Client did\n&gt; \n&gt; $S420M: *facedesk* Well then why would you expect the results to be any different? And no way $Client would know how to change anything.\n\nI honestly wish this was the first time, or the worst time he has done something like this. I have hundreds more of these....",

        "text": "If you've read my previous [tale](https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/77a043/you_need_to_set_up_a_pin_for_me_what_do_you_mean/), I'm still working on getting secure printing to be the standard for where I work. The other day, I pulled a ticket reporting that a faculty member no longer had their Secure Print option listed under Devices &amp; Printers. Should be a simple fix, it's pushed out through Group Policy so they probably just need to restart their PC.\n\nI remember working with this person, but I don't remember their PC still having admin rights. See, we only moved to Active Directory a few years ago and we still have some stragglers out there. Most of them seem to be faculty who refused at the time of migration, as they were given that option so that they could still \"work and download what they need\", and were put on a list by the vendor who did our AD migration, so that we could work with them individually. A few years later and the project manager for that project is long gone, with that list nowhere to be found.\n\nSo now I'm tasked with taking inventory of all computers I touch for the umpteenth time, noting if they're on AD or not, so that we can go back later after this project and get all of the stragglers. I call her up this morning at the time she requested, only to have her call me back 15 minutes late. I have issues remoting onto her computer, but finally get on with TeamViewer, and look at her printers. I confirm that she's not just to AD, but that the new printer is set up manually. I know I would have tested it a couple months back when I set up her machine.\n\n&gt;$Me: So because you're not migrated to AD, you don't have the Secure Print option. But you are set up to print directly to the printer, just like you were before it was replaced.\n\n&gt;$FM: Wait, so in order to print, I have to be migrated and lose my admin rights? But I have stuff I need to download in order to work with my students and going through IT takes forever and I need to be able to work!\n\nOkay, being late to an appointment you set up with me is one thing, but now this woman is not listening to what I just said, going on a tangent, and interrupting me when I try to calm her down and explain what's happening. All of those things will get on my nerves easily.\n\n&gt;$Me: No, let's take a step back. In order to use Secure Print, you will need to be migrated. But right now, you can use this printer and print directly (keep in mind she a secondary printer set up as well, so even if her assumption was true, there was no reason to freak out). And if that's not working for you either, I will troubleshoot it right now. I can't force you to be migrated over right now but I do have to take note of it and inform my supervisor for when IT does choose to move the remaining faculty to AD.\n\n&gt;$FM: Wait so when I'm migrated over I can't download anything on my own? Because I teach online courses and it took forever to find this tool that would work to do that and I don't want it to be taken away.\n\n&gt;$Me: Once you're migrated, any software requests have to go through IT. If it's not purchased/downloaded through us, we don't support it.\n\n&gt;$FM: Okay, I'll send a test print later today and let you know if it's not working. Also, I have this video editing software I downloaded on my own to help students with their projects but it's not working. Can you fix that or do I have to put in a separate IT request?\n\n&gt;$Me: Sorry, but if the software was not requested through IT, we cannot support it.\n\n&gt;$FM: Okay, have a good rest of the day.\n\nSelective hearing at its finest.",

I recently found this sub and was thrilled to learn that I'm not the only one with crazy tech support stories.  \n\n\n\nTo kick off my posts with y'all, I figured I'd share this gem I experienced shortly after starting a new job.\n\n\n\nAs most of the Americans here know, a few months ago, we experienced a total Solar Eclipse crossing the entire continential US. This also happened to coincide with my first day on the job. (foreshadowing much?; pun intended)\n\n\n\nOne of the first calls I took was a lady who worked in the finance department worried about the eclipse and her computer and all the files on our sharedrive.\n\n\nIt will be a long time before I forget this one so here's how it went down:\n\n\n\n&gt;Me: IT, Can I help you?\n\n&gt;User: Hi. I was wondering if our computers and files are safe.\n\n&gt;M: Um... I'm sure they are. Is there something specific you are concerned about? Did you receive any strange emails recently?\n\n&gt;U: No. It's the Solar Eclipse. \n\n&gt;M: Ok. What do you mean?\n\n&gt;U: Well, I've heard about this whole 'cloud' thing and I didn't know if that's where our files and computers are stored. Since there's a solar eclipse going on, is our stuff in a cloud? Is it safe?\n\n&gt;M: (after catching my breath from holding in my laughter) Uh.. Yes, ma'am. All of our computers and your files are perfectly fine. We don't use 'a cloud' for storage. We keep it here in the building. \n\n&gt;U: Oh ok. That's good. I was just worried no one else had thought about that. \n\n&gt;M: Ok. Have a good day. *Hang up the phone* *fall out of chair laughing*\n\n\n\nI knew Tech Support would have some interesting stories to tell, but on my first day, that was a doozy! \n\n\n\nI look forward to reading all of your other crazy client stories!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/7ak0lq/more_from_aviation_maintenance_weak_stomachs_need/",
        "text": "*Before we get too deep into this one (and let me tell ya, it gets deep…), a warning:  If you have a weak stomach and just the thought of porta-johns (porta-potties, etc..) makes you queasy, you might want to just click the back button and look for something more wholesome.  I’m going to seriously wade into this topic as it applies to aircraft…*\n***\nOne thing about planes, and in particular planes that have people on them (you know, all of them) is that people have needs.  People need something to drink, often something to eat…and then somewhere to expel their waste.  On C130s, that was the “Honey Bucket,” which sat by the tail ramp in full view of all who had to watch as the unfortunate soul had to empty themselves…and then post-flight be responsible for cleanup.  \n\nOn small aircraft, such as a corporate charter turboprop, the Honey Bucket is squirreled away beneath a bench seat towards the back of the plane.  The best description of the use of that seat can be found in a review of the Haribo Sugar-Free Gummy Bears on Amazon.  Again, if you’re not familiar with what I speak of, take a moment to read the [tale of shame and despair](https://www.amazon.com/review/R9LN2785JGSL3) and know that poor soul was intimate with the other passengers in ways one is only with their significant other.  But when you’re done reading the tales of woe, please, come on back, we miss you.  \n\nIn larger jets, the systems to handle these bodily wastes become more complex—sometimes by a matter of degrees and others entire orders of magnitudes. No longer is it a simple bucket.  In many newer, modern planes it’s a pretty cool vacuum based system.  When on the ground, there’s a motor that’ll suck everything out of the bowl while fresh water gets pumped around the rim.  In the air, pushing the flush button simply opens up a valve in the system to the outside air and air pressure differential sucks it back into a holding tank.  If the holding tank fills up, the system shuts down to keep from overflowing.  I’ve only seen a plane come in once with the system overfilled like that, oddly enough it was a flight that came in out of Washington D.C……\n\nThe vacuum system is good fun, too—I’m not suggesting you try this next time you fly (In fact, please, please don’t!) but check out a couple videos about the way those systems flush, especially a toilet paper roll.  I cannot confirm or deny running TP down the length of a plane and flushing it….and it eating most of the roll. \n\nUnfortunately, in other, older planes it’s a flying porta-john tank beneath the seat. The system comes complete with a filter and recirculator to flush ‘clean’ ‘blue juice’ across a simple flapper valve and bowl to wash away any residual materials.  (Blue Juice is essentially a blue glycol/water mixture.  It smells bad when fresh, and worse after.  It’s pretty much the same stuff in the ones you see at events as in the plane.)  \n\nIn either aircraft, to empty the tank, a truck or cart backs up to an access door in the fuselage, some poor guy gets out and hooks up the hose and then pulls a cable.  A valve opens and the holding tank, be it an individual lav (lavatory) tank (porta-john style) or a holding tank for multiple lavs (vacuum system).  The truck then runs some blue juice through the tank to rinse it, and then fills either tank to the proper holding level, usually determined by an automatic sensor. \n\nIt is a really bad day when that sensor breaks, by the way.  Blue Juice, used and unused, is terribly corrosive to aircraft structure and cleanup is a bear.\n\nUnfortunately, this being a mechanical system means that it can and does break.  Components fail.  Seals stop sealing.  Pumps stop pumping.  Flight attendants and passengers throw in stuff like diapers, unwanted military orders, cans, bottles, ifruit, jewelry…Which means some poor, humble and unsuspecting soul has to fix it, replace it or retrieve it.  Enter the Aviation Maintenance Technician, the only person who can ‘legally’ sign-off a repair to a system on an aircraft. \n\nAs this is a pretty crappy job, lav problems are delegated immediately to the lowest seniority person.  That person has little recourse than to suddenly come down violently ill or just to dive in and see what happens.  And one night, yours truly was the least senior AMT on site.\n\nA large jet had just pulled into our hangar and the number one issue was a lav would not hold fluid. Because of the type of aircraft, it had the older porta-john style of lav. They’d fill the tank, but by the time it landed somewhere the lav dump access door was caked in blue ice and the tank was empty, save for…anything anyone had left behind.  It was fairly obvious the problem lay with the dump valve sticking open, which in this style was a spring-loaded plug.  Rather than go through the trouble to tear the whole seat shroud off, open up the tank and pull the valve assembly out, it was much, much easier to just…reach in and make sure there was nothing blocking the plug from closing and have someone stand outside and pull the handle to make sure the valve did actuate.  \n\nAgain, being the lowest seniority AMT it fell to yours truly.  Now, me, I have trouble with fecal matter.  Call it living next to the Poo Pond in Kandahar (yet another thing you should look up when you have time..) or perhaps a phobia, but I can’t stand it.  At all.  I had trouble changing my kid’s diaper at first, and still get grossed out when I get some on my hand trying to clean up said child.  But here I was, that night, long before I had even a baby to help acclimate me, staring at the black abyss of a lav tank needing a full cavity search.  \n\nFor the dubious task, I selected my left arm as the victim, and donned a full body Tyvek suit, a half-face respirator with particulate filters, three pairs of nitrile gloves, a kitchen glove, a thick, fabric lined rubber glove and a garbage bag. As I’m getting my courage up to shove my hand down past the flapper valve and into the tank, my lead comes up to me.\n\n&gt;*Lead:*  “Hey, ZeeWulf, be careful, just in case someone threw needles in there.  Your vaccinations are up to date, right?”\n\nGreeaaaaaaaaaaaat. Yes, they were up to date but now let’s just add one more layer to my anxiety.  \n\nI plunged my hand into the tank and started feeling around.  Sensation was thankfully dulled by the many layers of protection I was wearing, but I could still feel a cratered poo-scape, slightly mooshy and altogether nauseating.  I felt around in the tank for several minutes, ensuring there weren’t any solids in there that didn’t belong.  Eventually, my hand found the dump valve plug, and I called my partner on the radio.\n\n&gt;*ZeeWulf:*  “Okay, pull it!”  \n\nI could feel the valve move slightly, but I could tell it was stuck in the up-position.  I could feel there was something around it, holding it there.  I tried to push whatever was there, but had no luck budging it.  I dropped a scraper into the tank and started chipping away at the build-up and eventually managed to free the valve.  I called back down to my partner again.  \n\n&gt;*ZeeWulf:*  “Okay, close it!”\n\nHe released the dump handle and the valve re-seated itself properly.  I then fled the plane, peeled off the protective layers (and threw every single one of them away, aside from the mask) and spent the next fifteen minutes scrubbing my hand with the hottest water I could find.  When my partner found me, he asked what I’d found in there.  \n\n&gt;*ZeeWulf:*  “Crap.  The valve was blocked with crap.  Lots and lots of crap.”\n\nAnd then I went home and took a long, long, long shower.\n***\n\nEdit 1: TL;DR: Planes are nasty and it sucks to work on some systems.  Also some people need more fiber in their diet.\n\nEdit 2: Formatting\n\nEdit 3: Adding edit notes, and...\nIt looks like I gave you three other take-aways/additional things to look at:\n1. Don't Eat Sugarfree Gummy Bears.\n2. Toilets suck.  Especially toilet paper. \n3. [The Kandahar Poo Pond is a thing.](https://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/the-poo-pond/)",

Some time ago, someone decided that there should be a MAC in the Marketing department of our previously 100% Windows office.\n\nThis is a story as much about ME as it is the affected user…\n\nThey did a “Who wants it?” kind of thing and apparently the woman who was out of the office and unable to say “not it” had it dumped on her desk.\n\nThe vendor came in and got an iMac all set up for her; the kind with a round white base and the monitor sitting above it on a chrome arm. They installed whatever software had been requested, got her logged on and able to access the relevant network shares, sat with her for a while to get her familiar with it and then wished her well and left…\n\nI got a call from her about 1 week later – we’ve known each other for years. I should say that I didn’t know anything about Macs, but thought that for the most part, a computer is a computer and I would be able to figure things out…\n\nPGN = Woman who received the Mac and later told me that when she saw it on her desk, she thought Please God, No.\n\nST = (Support Tech) Me\n\n-------------\n\nPGN: Good morning, ST. I wouldn’t bother you, but they told me not to call the vendor back in here when I can’t figure out something unless I REALLY need to. Would you have time to talk with me about this new Mac?\n\nST: Sure thing, PGN. What’s up?\n\nPGN: They gave me a DVD with a presentation that I need to view and approve. I know that one of the things this computer was supposed to be able to do was play these disks that we get from time to time, but I can’t for the life of me figure out where to put it in. They took away my old computer, so I’m kind of stuck…\n\nST: I will be right over – don’t worry, we’ll get this sorted out.\n\nI get over to her desk and see the iMac for the first time. She stands up, hands me the DVD and says:\n\nPGN: I feel stupid. This is like Al Capone’s vault, but worse; I can’t even FIND the vault.\n\nI look it over and sure enough, I know why she would be thrown off. I eventually see the tiny space all around what must be the optical drive in the round white base, but no eject button to be found.\n\nI try to find the drive in the Mac version of File Explorer in the hope of having an Eject option and that turns into FINDING the drives in the first place and then doing a RIGHT click for the alternate menu with a ONE BUTTON mouse, etc.\n\nAt this point, all else has failed so I have to resort to RTFM. Except, no manual, so I Google it and sure enough, there’s the key on the keyboard. Whack it and the tray pops out.\n\nPGN: That’s pretty slick once you know how to do that.\n\n…Within about 1 year, the mac is gone and she (and the rest of her team) are on our latest Windows laptops and doing their work in the Adobe Creative Cloud applications.",

This happened during my shift at the University this evening. \n\n\nToday's Cast of Characters:\n\n$Death - Me\n\n$OtherDeath - Co-worker, We're practically twins.\n\n$New - New Supervisor - Just joined us a few weeks ago (after my last post, actually).\n\n$Main - Senior supervisor\n\n\n\n\nSo some context: As the main part of my job as an evening shift student employee, I am required to restock classrooms and check all of the instructors equipment. \n\nAnyways, not long before I encountered the featured iMac today, I had called $Main about an iMac that had an issue displaying to the projector that I couldn't figure out (until after i called him, of course). On the phone he tells me that his phone is dying, and he's going to leave it at the office. \n\nThis should have been the first warning sign of what  was going to happen. \n\nAnyways, I handle a few other classrooms without a hitch. All is well and good until I entered into the classroom that holds the iMac from hell.\n\nThere is writing on the chalkboard. \n\n&gt;$Death: Biology terms.... Who would need to use a chalkboard when they have a computer AND an document camera to work with??\n\n(this is a lecture hall, so the writing would have to be BIG to be remotely useful)\n\nThen it hit me. \nThis was the second warning. \n\n&gt; $Death: Oh God... What the hell happened?\n\nSo I make my trek down the stairs of the lecture hall and my fears were confirmed. The iMac was frozen at the fruit logo. \n\nSo I did what any self respecting IT worker would do. \nI turned it on and off again. \nNo dice. \n\nI tried unplugging it and turning it on. \nNo dice. \n\nI tried unplugging the video cable (not unheard for the display to be set to disable the iMacs display in favor of the Projector display. Why would anyone do this beats me). \nAnd still, no dice.  \n\nIn fact, it had gone completely dark after my first reboot (besides the backlight). \n\nSo i tried calling $main, hoping he had plugged in his phone or something. No dice. I couldn't contact $New either, as I haven't got his phone number yet.\n\nSo i text $OtherDeath about the issue.\n\n&gt; $Death: Hey i got an issue in [Narnia] with an iMac that has gone completely dark, besides the blacklight. $Main phone is Dead. Don't have $New number either. Can you let them know?\n\n&gt; $OtherDeath: I got you. Go ahead and leave that one alone. $Main and $New are out in [Mars], I'll tell them when they get back to the office. \n\n&gt; $Death: Alright. Sounds good. \n\n\nSo I handle a handful of other classrooms in my jurisdiction, and I come back to the crime scene, and I see $New there. \n\n\n&gt; $Death: Hey $New. Screen still blank?\n\n&gt; $New: Yep. Sure is. \n\n&gt; $Death: Yeah, I tried reboots multiple times. Still doesn't want to cooperate. \n\n&gt;$New: This video cable is unplugged.... \n\n&gt; $Death: Oh right, thats my doing. (its the one i unplugged earlier). Just made sure it wasn't being disabled.\n\n&gt; $New: Let me try plugging it in. \n\n\nStill, nothing. Unfortunately. \n\nHe went through the same things as I did. Pulling the plug, rebooting, Testing the video cable. No dice. \nHe even unplugged a USB adapter that had been plugged into it for ages, and then he plugs it back in. \n\n\n&gt; $New: I wonder if something came unplugged down there (most of the cables run inside a locked cabinet).\n\n\nHe asks the office guys if they have a key for it. They have no idea. \n\n&gt;$Death: Well, if I was a betting man, i would say it needs re-imaged. \n\n&gt; $New: It's probably more of a power issue. The keyboard isn't lighting up. \n\n&gt; $Death: Oh yeah, thats right (I had mentioned that to him at some point before). It probably needs a hot swap then, but....that also needs a key. \n\n&gt; $New: I guess we'll have to come back later. We \nCame, we saw, we failed. \n\nSo I finish up my last few rooms, the mystery still looming over my mind. I bump into $new on my way back to the office, where he got a set of keys (and asked me if those were the ones we need. I had no idea). We go visit the iMac again and see $Main is there.\n\n&gt; $Main:  Hold on right there, I worked a miracle.\n\nAnd we marvel as this god unplugs the USB adapter. (The same one $New unplugged for a moment). \n\nAnd Nothing happened...until we see the glorious boot screen about 30 seconds later. \n\nIt turns out, the stick attached to the USB adapter is a receiver for, lets call it \"Kill Me Now Technology\", where professors can have students connect their clicker devices to to make their lectures more interactive. Kill Me Now Technology is apperently crap, makes anyone in the department who works on them want to quit. Bad Security, instability, double entries, you name it. And the iMac was trying to boot into this defective receiver with the Kill Me Now Technology...\n\nSo, $New almost solved the problem. We just weren't patient enough. \n\n\n\nTL:DR iMac goes blank as it tries to boot into a defective non-bootable USB stick. It almost went unsolved due to a lack of patience. \n\nEdit: Formatting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "My last tale reminded me of my days doing dialup remote support from 5 to 9 every weeknight. Dialup support sucked, as you could never TEST anything while on the phone, because then you had to hang up, and let them connect to the internet to try it. anyway...\n\nThis was a long long time ago, around 2002-2003.\n\nSo here i am watching videos on my brand new 17inch lcd that cost over 500 dollars, on my dual core amd, and the phone rings. \n\nAn elderly gentleman on the phone is getting server not found messages in outlook express. As you cant get internet while on the phone, pretty well the only thing you CAN do is confirm all the settings are correct, confirm username and server settings etc.\n\nSo i walk him through the mail account settings in outlook express. The ISP this gentleman used was called Bullet Dialup. This is important.\n\nI: \"Ok sir, can you read out what it says in server settings?\"\n\nnot I: \"Its mail.bullet.com.au\"\n\nme: \"ok, and username?\"\n\nhim: \"whateveritwas@bullet.net.au\"\n\nI get him to retype his password in from my management interface, do a few other checks and we hang up so he can try again.\n\n1 minute later, same number.\n\nOld man: \"Its not working! fix it! I am paying good money for this and im loosing business!\"\n\nIts a 10 dollar a month dialup connection... \n\nanyhoo\n\nSo the internet actually works. When he is connected, he can browse the web its just that outlook express comes up with server not found.\n\nOk, so its either a DNS issue (very common in those days for some reason thanks to win98) or like a space or something it the domain name.\n\nSo we check it again.\n\nme: \"are you sure it says mail.bullet.com.au\" \n\nhim: \"yes. 100 percent it says mail.bullet.com.au\"\n\ni get him to retype it after deleting it, so i hear him clacking away.\n\nhang up, try again.\n\na minute later, one angry man on the phone.\n\n\"Its not bloody working!!\"\n\nok, so im running out of ideas here. \n\nso, i get him to spell it out as he is typing it in just in case.. fuck knows.\n\nHe starts typing \"m a i l dot b u l l i t\"\n\nwait what?\n\n\"sir, its spelt b u l l e t\"\n\n\"no its not, bullet is spelt bullit\"\n\n\"uhhh.. the bill you get every month is from bullet. your email address even ends in bullet.com.au. Thats how its spelt.\"\n\n\"no its not\"\n\nme, after another sip of vodka and lemonade \"please, can you just try it with mail.bullet.net.au and you can call me back again if it doesnt work.\"\n\n\" ok FINE\"\n\ni hear him tap away, and he hangs up on me.\n\n*crickets for the rest of the evening*\n\n\ncranky old fuck",

In my experience (and pretty much all of my bosses will confirm) doctors are brilliant working on people, terrible working on computers.\n\nMost of the calls my co-worker and I received were about people unable to get into their accounts. My co-worker received one such call. The person was due for a password change and unknowing what they were doing called us. CO = Coworker. D = doctor.\n\n*Insert dialog of my CO getting the account pulled up*\n\nCO: \"Your new temporary password will be.\n...\nCapitol 'M'\n...\nlowercase 'e'\n...\nlowercase 'd'\n...\nthe number '4'\"\n\nD: \"Is that capitalized?\"\n\nCO: *staring blankly at his screen*.... \"No.\"\n\nWe had a good laugh about it. It was one of the more funny calls we had. Afterwards we discussed some of the more humorous responses he could of had. He said in the moment he was so shocked by the question that he didn't think about answering in another way.\n",

        "text": "So hopefully this is properly anonymous - I don't surf reddit at work either. This happened last week and makes me smile a little. Really thankful for all the upvotes for my first story, hopefully you guys will like this one too! Going to try some dialogue, as well! The basis is such a petty thing, but as often happens with TFTS, it snowballs nicely.\n\nCharacters:  \n$me: recently joined sysadmin  \n$C: C-level person, been with the company since before its founding  \n$MD: dotted-line boss who's pretty awesome\n\nSo I joined this startup (about 50 people) as a sysadmin and devops person; many questioned why I was so eager to identify as a sysadmin when everyone is moving to devops - the simple answer is, nobody can define what devops is, whereas sysadmin is pretty well understood. I also prefer playing with hardware and tinkering, both of which I get to do here with pretty free rein.\n\nBefore I joined, the company had many, many question marks over its IT hardware and related equipment. Since then, I've taken on the responsibilities of managing the machines, getting them imaged, keeping them updated, talking to the suppliers etc. One task that snowballed was keeping track of them all - as is common for a small company, it was all done in Excel (well, Google Docs). After hearing about it in another TFTS story, I investigated SnipeIT, spun up a VM, installed it and imported all our assets into it. I love it! I've now got a pretty clear view of our inventory, including stuff that has some question marks hanging over it.\n\nWhat complicates this story is that it deals with a C-level individual, $C. Obviously they are the natural enemy of the sysadmin, to be avoided at any cost. My first dealing with him didn't go so well, though. Shortly after I joined, he called me into the CEO's office for assistance. He uses his personal MBP in the office, and had left his MagSafe charger at home. As previously mentioned, all our company Macs are USB-C ones. By coincidence, we have one Retina MBP, at that time assigned to someone, but she had also taken the charger home and left it there - fortunately the battery was lasting well for her. We had no spare MagSafe chargers - plenty of USB-C, but he was plum out of luck.\n\n&gt;$me: ...so yeah, I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do for you right at this moment.  \n&gt;$C: yes there is.\n\nWhat got to me here wasn't what he said, it was the way it was spoken. Those three words were intoned such that I had completely and foolishly overlooked something important. Obviously countering a C-level is an express ticket to the unemployment line, so somewhat nervous I silently question what I might be forgetting.\n\n&gt;$C: You can order me a spare.\n\nAh. Yes...\n\nI politely left and placed an order with the office manager. That was the last I heard of that.\n\nLast week, however, $C came over to me and asked to borrow a charger. By now, the Retina MBP had been retired; it's the oldest computer in the company - of over 400 assets, this is #3. Figuring nobody else is going to want such an antique machine, especially as we have plenty of brand new ones, I requisitioned it for myself. In fairness, I do Mac support as well, so I do need a Mac as well as my high-performance Ubuntu-powered Dell Precision laptop. As I'm not using the Mac, I say sure, pass him the MagSafe charger and he's on his merry way.\n\nLater that afternoon, shortly before hometime, I catch up with him and ask to have the charger back.\n\n&gt;$C: Oh... er, where was I sitting... let me just go grab it for you...\n\nI wanted the charger because I had been tasked with running our company meeting the following day, and our screencasting software doesn't support Linux. Familiarising myself with it, I told him I'd be in the meeting room setting it up. About half an hour later I've figured out how to do everything I need to, and realise I haven't had the charger back. Search the office, no sign of him - $C has disappeared off home. Great. Fortunately there was enough charge in the battery for the next morning that the meeting went perfectly.\n\n$C does, of course, work only a few days a week, so I don't see him for a while. Eventually I bump into him.\n\n&gt;$me: ah, hey, did you find that MagSafe charger I lent you?  \n&gt;$C: afraid not, it wasn't where I was sitting. I think someone must've thought it was theirs and taken it.\n\nWe share office space with three other companies, who use Macs, so it's plausible. I ask the office manager to email everyone and ask if anyone has picked up a spare charger, but nobody replies.\n\nIn conversation with the MD (who I'm good friends with, he hired me mostly to implement his grand visions for the company infrastructure) via instant messenger, I mention this to him.\n\n&gt;$MD: Well, I guess you learned something today.  \n&gt;$me: what's that, 'don't trust the C-levels'?  \n&gt;$MD: Something along those lines.\n\nI give it a couple of days and bump into $C again.\n\n&gt;$me: hey, so, nobody replied. It's weird how that charger vanished.  \n&gt;$C: you're right about that, the spare one you ordered for me a couple of months ago disappeared too.  \n&gt;$me *[internally]*: err... I'm noticing a common factor here...  \n&gt;$me: okay, well I'll just have to buy a replacement for my MBP.  \n&gt;$C: yeah, do that.\n\nAround this time, I get SnipeIT up and running. In between massaging our spreadsheets into a nice format for its importer and fixing the import errors, I spot something interesting in the Ready to Deploy list. We have no less than *four* spare MagSafe chargers on the books, and the paper trail ends exactly there. No indication whatsoever where they've gone to. From what I can tell, the previous user of my MBP never needed a spare, and gave it back with its original charger. That leaves one possibility.\n\nI quietly mention this to $MD via IM, who comes over and double-checks my asset list. Raising a few eyebrows, since these adapters are quite a lot of money each and it's not even for a company computer, he decides that $C is no longer allowed to loan any company IT equipment, and any requests must go straight to him. He also orders me a new charger and says I have no need to lend it to anyone, on his orders. That's where it's been left, and frankly, I have no desire to dig into it any further.\n\n**TL;DR** - C-level executive crosses a meek sysadmin, who finds an interesting paper trail that suggests the C-level may be hoarding company property...",
