        "text": "“Damn.” The assessment of the situation was pretty spot on with the single word uttered by Hayes. \n\nThe idyllic surroundings were just starting to warm up and the thin blanket of dew on the black trash bag covering the man’s head began pooling into larger rivulets. Somewhere behind me, seagulls seemed to be shouting obscenities at one another as they fought over some scrap of food. Crickets chirped and leaves rustled with the exploratory expeditions hungry squirrels. Nestled in the roots of an ancient, gnarled oak, the reason for my visit slowly seeped his life’s blood into the ground. \n\n“He picked a helluva place to end it, huh?” Hayes said to no one in particular. \n\nThe spot overlooked a quiet cove, replete with waterfowl and driftwood strewn shoreline. The sounds of nature around us were only interrupted by the occasional angry jogger, arguing over the closure of his favorite trail or the electric whir of crime scene’s cameras after documenting another point of evidentiary prominence. This final act of violence seemed utterly out of place in such a serene setting. \n\n“Coroner on the way?” One of the crime scene techs, Joe, asked.\n\n“Yeah,” I replied. As ‘new guy’ I was still stuck doing the administrative aspects of the job and had dutifully made the call an hour earlier. “Should be here any minute.”\n\n“Good, ‘cause we need to get this show on the road.” Joe harrumphed and turned back to the task at hand. I was still getting used to the nonchalant and sometimes brusque nature of business around the recently deceased. I guess that was a big hurdle of the race to one hundred bodies.\n\nThe scene slowly progressed and eventually the coroner appeared as if from thin air. He began surveying and taking photos, prodding soil and taking air temperatures from various points emanating from the body. The crime scene veterans were rolling their eyes. \n\n“So, you’re saying he left a note in his car?” He asked Hayes, the lead on this case. \n\n“Yeah, typical “goodbye cruel world” kinda stuff.” \n\n“But you think he put this bag on his head before shooting himself?” The coroner seemed puzzled. \n\n“I mean, yeah. Nothing else points to homicide. I think dude just didn’t want some baby chipmunk choking on his brain matter.” Hayes scoffed. The coroner bristled but remained silent. He contemplated the scene for a few moments before speaking again. \n\n“I’m not too comfortable with this. I may need to consult my colleagues.” The coroner re-adjusted his glasses up his nose and stared down anyone who may have had the urge to speak out against his judgement before drawing his cellphone and stomping off.\n\n“What’s up his butt today?” Joe asked me as we watched him gesturing to whoever was on the other side of the phone a few yards away. \n\n“Is he always like this?” I asked.\n\n“Not really, no. Only when he’s overdue for a nap in my experience.” The coroner wrapped up his conversation and stalked over to us again. \n\n“My colleague agrees. He’s on his way.” He asserted. \n\n“You been busy lately?” Joe asked in a seemingly caring manner. \n\n“Yes. Far, far too busy. People need to stop killing themselves and others around here. Deal with life! And the hand it dealt you!! Just let me get some sleep! PLEASE!” He was panting a bit and his eyes had transcended into some realm of crazy for the moment. \n\nJoe just nodded, then turned away and gave me a quick smirk and a wink. \n\nHayes approached. “So, this is going to be a while. I’m thinking we should get a jump on the next of kin notification. Bigger picture: car registered to a guy with similar build and skin tone is parked right up the hill, suicide note, gun box matching the gun we got here, house close enough that this place makes sense. We should track down the wife or mom or whoever and head there hoping maybe by the time we’re ready, they’ll have that bag pulled off and confirm it’s our guy one hundred percent. Cool?”\n\n“You’re asking me?” I was wondering when the shoe would drop, twisting my rookie cockroach-like body into the carpet and laughing over my worthless corpse. “I thi-“\n\n“No one cares what you think.” Hayes pivoted on his heel and began walking away. There was that shoe. \n\nWe drove towards the home of the presumably deceased man. I was rapidly scrolling through police databases to identify his closest relative. “Looks like he lives at that address with his wife of three years. Social media is a hit too – they have a two-ish year old daughter.” \n\n“Ugh, This is gonna suck.” Hayes gripped the steering wheel in pre-death-notification stress. \n\nWe parked down the street from the neat row house belonging to who we hoped was our dead guy. A shiny truck was parked in the driveway and an American flag rolled in the light breeze. “It’s been twenty minutes.” Hayes said, checking his cell phone clock. “What’s taking them?”\n\n“Should we call?” I asked. \n\n“Screw that. Let’s go take a look. No point in giving them another reason to not do their job because they’re answering their phone.” Hayes exited the vehicle, I followed close behind. We approached the truck. “You ever see that video of the cops getting shot in … Miami? ... I think it was. Walking up to the house and someone’s lying in the car in the driveway?”\n\n“Yeah. I think we had to do some mandatory training after that happened.”\n\n“Yeah, that’s the one. Well-“ He gestured to the truck. “-have at it.”\n\nI cleared the vehicle without complaint, noticing nothing unusual but an envelope on the dashboard addressed to ‘Steph.’\n\n“Y’see. That’s why we get a look around before jumping into anything rash. I’m sure that’s going to be the note left for his wife, left on her dashboard so she’d see it when she left today. How stupid would we look if we came here and left without knowi-“ Hayes was cut off by the front door opening. An athletic blonde stood in the doorway, peeking nervously in our direction. \n\n“Officers?” She asked. Hayes was dumbstruck for a moment, clearly oogling the attractive lady. \n\n“Yes ma’am.” I started. I’m detective Jones and this is detective Hayes.” I motioned to Hayes, still slightly off his game. \n\n“Detectives?” The woman seemed to shrink a bit. “So this is probably what I think it is.”\n\n“Well ma’am, Steph is it?” Hayes began. The woman made an expression conveying that was not her name. “You mind if we come in?”\n\nShe shook the confusion and nodded. “Of course, yes. Please.” She turned and started up the stairs in the home. \n\nI leaned in to Hayes. “His wife’s name is Amanda.”\n\n“Coulda told me that before, jerk.”\n\nWe entered the home and sat around the dining room table. “Amanda, right? I’m sorry about the Steph thing a second ago.”\n\n“No problem. How do you know about her?” She asked. \n\n“Oh, I just assumed due to the letter on the dashboard…” Hayes trailed off, not sure where the line was before we officially crossed into notification territory I guess. \n\n“It’s just, she’s a big reason all this happened. I think my husband killed himself – I just found a note – and she was the woman he was having an affair with. We were just starting the divorce process and he was taking it really hard.” Her head dropped as she concluded her guess as to our visit. “Is he dead?”\n\n“Well I-“ Hayes’ phone began ringing. “One second.” He stood quickly and walked to the family room. Amanda looked at me for answers. \n\n“We are hopefully… I think I can say at this point… maybe whoever is on the phone can tell us…” I stammered. \n\n“Uh huh. Ok. Ok. Got it, bye.” Hayes walked back. “Is your husband Eric Smith?” \n\n“Yes.” The woman replied. \n\n“Well Amanda, this morni-“ He was interrupted again. \n\n“Mummummummmmmmma!” A toddler toddled up to Amanda and raise her hands expectantly, awaiting a lift to her mother’s lap. \n\n“I’m sorry, she just woke up with me. It was a long night.” Amanda apologized. “Go on.”\n\n“Well, as I was saying this morning, a jogger in Waterside Park came across…” Hayes trailed off. His eyes were fixed on Amanda, but not on her face. He was blatantly staring at her chest. \n\nAmanda had lifted up her pajama top, exposing both breasts, and was feeding her daughter at the table, eyes still looking at Hayes, pleading him to continue.\n\n“Uhhh… a jogger found a male at the park, dead from a gunshot wound to the head. It’s Eric. I’m sorry, Eric is dead.” Hayes was trying his best to keep his composure and suddenly found something very interesting to examine on a nearby empty wall. Amanda took the news in stride. \n\n“I knew it was a possibility – he’d been threatening it for years. I just didn’t know he’d actually do it.” She shook her head, clearly sad but not devastated. “He left a note on the counter today, saying he had gone forever. I thought – hoped! – maybe he meant he had just left to  move in with Stephanie but when he said he left her his truck in his will, I knew.”\n\nThe rest of our stay was spent explaining the process of retrieving the body from the morgue following the autopsy and recommending counseling if she needed support. Amanda’s sister arrived before we left and arrived back at Hayes’ cruiser. \n\nWe took a moment to think about the notification. \n\n“Son.” Hayes started. “That’s the freshest set of widow titties you’re ever gonna see.”\n",

        "text": "I'm at my favorite spot, nicknamed \"The Church\" cause it was in a church's parking lot, officers come up with best nicknames. I'm talking to my buddy Tony, he's talking about his Cincy Bengals, I'm talking about my Philly Eagles and Penn State Lions, mainly they were giving me heart attacks on back to back days on my off days. \n\n[Dispatch]: Beep... Code 2, Accident with injury at H Ave and 23rd Street.\n\nTony looks at me, \"Hey, you going to do any work today or am I putting the district on my back like I do everyday?\" \n\nI respond back with, \"I was officer of the month last month Tony.\" \n\nTony smirking, I know he is going to ambush me but he just dryly states, \"That's cause you are always in the station talking to the rank while I do all the work and you get the credit.\"\n\nI look at him laughing and ask if he wants the call, he replies in a deep Kentucky accent, \"Nah you can take that call officer of the month.\" \n\nI key up with my radio, \"Unit 311 to dispatch\"\n\nDispatch: \"Go ahead unit...\" \n\nAs quickly as I can I scream, \"DROP ME THAT CODE 2!\" Tony's radio goes off loudly with my voice echoing off our radios as I peel off laughing, pissing him and the rest of my district off. \n\nI go lights and sirens, the accident is in a good area so I'm pretty sure everyone will have insurance and the people will be tolerable of each other, classic mistake. \n\nI arrive on scene and see a white Ford Explorer in the middle of the intersection with noticeable front end damage and look over and see a silver Chevrolet Equinox with driver side damage. \n\nI see both parties and I activate just my rear lights and key up on my radio, \"Unit 311 requesting an additional unit for traffic control.\" \n\nI hear my radio chirp, \"Unit 332, drop us that call and make our last call necessary action taken.\" Great the recruit car is going to help me with traffic while I write this report, smh, he should be writing this crap. \n\nI go up to both drivers and ask who's hurt? Driver of the white Ford Explorer tells me her sister is hurt, I look into the vehicle and I don't see anyone, so I calmly ask her where her sister is right now. Driver of the Ford Explorer says she went back to her house down the street. I look at her and ask if she is coming back or if she needs medical attention, she says her sister will go and see her doctor tomorrow. I tell the driver thanks and ask for her information. \n\nDriver of the silver vehicle already has all of his information ready, I ask him if he has any injuries or anyone else in the vehicle and he says, \"Nah my wife and I are fine just glad you got here so fast.\" \n\nI go back to my unit and start my paperwork, the other unit shows up and and I tell the Field Training Officer where to position his vehicle and then tell his recruit to ask each party what happened. \n\nWell the recruit comes back with two different stories that boil down to that each party had the green light. Great, now this is going to be fun, I thank the recruit and scorn the gods for not having a camera at this intersection. \n\nSo I interview both parties and they each state the same thing so this is going no where fast, but wait the white Ford Explorer states she has a witness! I say that's great where is she or he? She tells she will call her to come back to the scene. \n\n10 minutes later I have a very frail old lady telling me how the silver Chevrolet had slammed into the white Explorer. I tell her thanks and asked where she was during the accident, oh I was in the white Explorer. \n\nI look down for a moment, trying to hide my smile, I thank the old lady and ask if she needs anything else and she says no and thanks me and waits with the driver of the white Ford Explorer who ended up being her sister. \n\nSo I don't write any tickets and tell both parties that I can't determine who's at fault and give them both some paperwork. Well miss white Ford Explorer gets upset and says, \"I brought a witness!\" \n\nI respond, \"Yes, mam but if I ask the passenger in the Chevrolet she will state the same thing, I needed an independent witness, not your sister.\" \n\nBoth parties got personal tow trucks and I waited an hour for the white Ford Explorer. \n\nFin",

        "text": "I was writing someone a ticket on the side of the freeway when I got called to a crash and a possible fight. Another Trooper went en route to back me. As I got back in my car, the other Trooper blasted by me, and we were able to head to the scene together.\n\nWe got updates on the way. Two vehicles blocking an off ramp. One car hit another car, and the driver of one car was trying to pull the elderly female driver out of the other car. Suspect was a black male, about 6 feet tall, thin build, mid 30's.\n\nAs my partner and I rolled up to the scene, there was roughly 8 cars, all stopped on the shoulder, with everyone out of their cars. Instead of stopping at the light at the bottom of the ramp, everyone was stopped about halfway down the ramp. And everyone was looking at one guy. That helped identify our suspect pretty quickly.\n\nMy partner jumped out of his car. \"Put your hands up!\" The suspect ignored that. He started walking towards us, while rambling so fast he could've been an auctioneer. It took me about 1 second to determine he was high. My guess was meth or cocaine.\n\n\"Stop where you are!\" He ignored that one, too. \"Get on the ground!\" At that point we were just throwing things out there to try and get him to do *something* so we wouldn't have to use force and fill out more paperwork. It didn't work.\n\nMy partner grabbed one arm, I grabbed another. He was still rambling incoherently and fighting against us. We assisted him to the ground, and got him cuffed after some wrestling practice. The victim was standing four feet away, just watching. We called an ambulance for the suspect, and I went to talk to the victim. All the witnesses started getting back in their cars and leaving.\n\n\"Ma'am, are you okay?\"\n\n\"I'm okay, just some marks on my arm.\" I could see some fresh bruising. This woman was also roughly 70 years old, but in surprisingly good shape. I later took pictures of the injuries.\n\n\"Can you explain to me what happened?\"\n\n\"I was exiting the freeway and I saw his car stopped in the lane. I came to a stop behind it. All of a sudden, he backed up into me. Then he got out of his car, opened my door, and started trying to pull me out of my car. I tried to fight him off, but wasn't doing too well, until some nice people stopped and helped me.\"\n\nI explained that because he was so high that he couldn't even tell me the year, he'd be put on a mental hold instead of going to jail. But I was going to recommend charges.\n\n\"Okay, thays good, I suppose. You know, as I watched you take him down, I wouldn't have minded if you had gotten in a few hits.\"\n\n\"Well, we're not allowed to do that if it's not necessary.\"\n\nMy sergeant showed up, seconding my opinion that the suspect was high. The whole encounter was captured on dashcam, which the sergeant watched. He commended my partner and I, saying it looked perfect. The suspect was strapped into an ambulance gurney and taken to a hospital for a psyche eval.\n\nI called some witnesses and got their statements. I wrote the report, recommending Assault with a Deadly Weapon, Attempted Carjacking, Assault with a Senior Citizen enhancement, Resisting Arrest, and Driving Without a License. The report was submitted to the DA for review.\n\nI checked for the status on the case a few weeks later. Not filed; lack of sufficient evidence. \n\nWhat I've come to learn that means is people who commit crimes while on drugs aren't held accountable. High while looking into car windows in a parking lot? Psyche hold. High while stealing? Psyche hold. High while dancing on a freeway? Psyche hold. High while ramming your car into someone, attempting to carjack them, and assaulting them? Psyche hold.\n",

        "text": "This happened last shift and I cringe inside thinking about it. I just wanted to share a mistake I made.\n\nOn 3rd shift you get to know your gas station workers. I pull into a 24/hr gas station for a refill on gas and on my fountain soda for that mid shift caffeine bump. It's about 3am and there's only 1 car at the pump. It's a later model, some rust, back windows are tinted. I peak inside and see it's pretty messy: some discarded food wrappers, weed shake on the driver and passenger's seat, and a crap load of lighters. The hood was cold, at least as cold as it could be with it being 80 degrees at 3 in the morning. I keep an eye out for the driver while I finish pumping. He never comes. Interesting, but I don't care too much about THC - I'd like to just see the driver checkout, make sure he's acting normal, just to double check. So I head inside.\n\nI'm just chatting with Cassy (the attendant) for about 15 minutes, what's the news, etc. Trying to kill time waiting for the driver to check out. She's got a 16 yr old and an 8 yr old at home alone. A few months back 16 yr old had some friends over way too late and I broke up his party for her. Now I usually swing by her place before I stop in, let her know it's all quiet at the house. She brings up that a guy has been in the bathroom for nearly an hour. Interesting - now that's an independent source bringing up suspicion.\n\nNow I've probably arrested 10 people in gas station bathrooms. Usually they're passed out from heroine, sometimes with needles in their arms, twice they had OD'ed and I brought them back with Narcan. They are usually called in as \"person in bathroom for 1 hour\". So this looks like the same kind of thing, I start a welfare call with dispatch and head into the bathroom.\n\nHe's got the stall door locked and I can't see above or under. I don't hear anything so I open and slam the bathroom door shut - now I hear shuffling. He opens the bathroom stall and is clearly surprised. He acts normal, responds to my questions promptly, and tells me he has a medical issue going to the bathroom which is why it takes so long. He offered to let me search him (which I do) and find no drug paraphernalia.  \n\nNow I feel like an asshole. I apologize, tell him what it looked like from my perspective. He says he understands and there's no hurt feelings. But man, I just hassled a guy who had just spent the last hour trying to take a shit. It just sucks when all those little red flags are going off and it ends up being just a normal person. I can arrest 10 junkies but the 1 mistake ruins it all. I hope I didn't give him a bad impression on police.",

        "text": "“You busy?”\n\nThe question in and of itself was fairly innocuous, but within a certain context - of which I was a dubious owner - it could lead to something repulsive.\n\n“Depends.” I replied to Brett. “How long has it been dead?”\n\nBrett chuckled on the other side of the phone. “Still fresh! This one’s a suicide. Don’t tell me you’re scared of a little decomp? You won’t make it very long up here if you are.”\n\n“No, no, I can handle decomp. It’s just the ‘leave-the-barbecue-restaurant-to-stare-at-sad-putrid-human-remains’ thing was not something I wanted to partake in this afternoon.”\n\n“Meh, it’s not so bad.” Brett scoffed. “I’ll text you the address.”\n\nI was getting transferred to Homicide and wasn’t quite sure how I felt about it. On the one hand, most everyone would agree homicides were the epitome of crime; the top echelon of detective work. On the other hand, I had been around long enough to realize the day-to-day of homicide work was anything but the glamorous cliché Hollywood had painted for us on the silver screen. \n\nThey called it “service-cide” for a reason and working suicides was a prime example of the half-joke re-name. Ninety percent of the cases I would be working would be considered “suspicious death” cases, not actual homicides. That phrase encapsulated all sorts of less-than-glamorous duty. One day would be a call out at midnight for a neighbor who finally got fed up with the stink from the apartment next door; the next day would bring a returned veteran who finally got fed up with the wait for more pain meds from the VA and decided to paint the walls of his efficiency apartment with his brains; an old lady whose mail had piled up and whose cat hadn’t been fed in a few weeks so it had to improvise; a baby who didn’t wake up in the morning in mom’s bed. Punctuate weeks of that with the occasional domestic strangulation or gang shooting and boom! – you have homicide. \n\nI loaded up in my cruiser and headed for the suicide. I knew from my time on the street how these things usually worked, if only from behind the clipboard with the crime scene log, and figured I’d still beat the crime scene technicians by a good margin. This would be my third official call for homicide, all coming while still putting in work in my current detail. The theory, as it was quite eloquently spelled out for me by one of the senior guys, was that “once you were assigned to homicide, you had to see a hundred bodies before you could see your first one alone.” So the race began even before the starter pistol fired. \n\nI pulled up and could tell this was going to be a complicated one. Brett was talking with an older woman at the end of the driveway but kept shooting eye-daggers at a younger female who was sobbing uncontrollably a few yards away. A skinny guy with a shaved head and track marks tried ineffectively to console the younger woman and a small dog yapped at nothing in particular at their feet. I approached Brett and he gave me a nod before continuing with the lady. \n\n“I’m sorry we had to meet like this but unfortunately I have a few questions about your husband that may seem crass at the moment.”\n\n“I understand,” The new widow said, wiping tears from her cheek with a tissue. “I know you all have a job and I want to help any way I can. George never seemed depressed, I just have no idea why he would do this.” She sniffled a bit and covered her mouth with a pale hand. “He was always the strong one.” She glanced at the younger female with that last sentence, a mixed expression of anger, pain, and confusion on her face. Brett stepped away and motioned me to join him, just outside ear-shot of the widow. \n\n“That’s the daughter. She’s a real winner. First thing she says to me when I get here was ‘do I know about her dad’s will.’ Amazing.” He glared again at the woman, puffing a cigarette between overly dramatic sobs. Neighbors were glancing out of their windows now, and the girl seemed to be lapping up the attention. \n\n“What’s the story here?” I asked, prepping my notebook and ready to start documenting. \n\n“Pretty simple, really. Mom and dad have been having a hard time ever since their only daughter was kicked out and put into rehab. Apparently narcotics and SWAT were here a few months ago to break up drama queen’s attempt at Walter Whiting it.”\n\n“So, dad kills himself?” I asked.\n\n“Yeah, hanging in the foyer there. I guess he wanted to bring his daughter and deadbeat boyfriend back into the home and mom over here was adamantly against it.” An older male neighbor was now comforting the mom. \n\n“Mind if I take a look?” I tilted my head over to the house, now protected by a yellow, police-line barrier. \n\n“Have at it. This’ll officially put you at, what? Two?”\n\n“Three. Don’t short change me.” I walked up to the front door and checked in with the uniform standing guard before dipping under the police-line. \n\n“Don’t run into him.” The patrol officer muttered. “He’s right inside.” I paused, taking in the advice, then opened the door. \n\nTrue to the report, the man was hanging just inside the door. He was suspended from the chandelier-type lighting fixture by a dog leash that cut deeply into his neck. His face was a dark red and his eyes were still open, gazing lifelessly at the drab walls of the neglected interior. I made note of some of the things I had learned to look for in my several homicide investigator prep courses: the ligature was deep and in an upward fashion – what a proper hanging should look like as opposed to a horizontal to perpendicular line that would indicate a strangulation hidden as a suicide. There was petechial hemorrhaging across the man’s cheeks and eyes – small red dots of broken blood vessels caused by pressure from the inability of the blood to escape the head. Other than the toppled stool underneath him, there was no sign of disturbance in the house, no sign of defensive injury on the man’s hands or bare arms or things knocked down off a nearby knick-knack covered shelf. Everything appeared to be in place for this to be a run-of-the-mill suicide.\n\n“You see the note?” Brett had come in behind me. \n\n“No, where?” I asked, glancing around. \n\n“Over on the dining room table.” Brett motioned his hand in the general direction. \n\nI walked over and read it. Apologies, attempts to minimize guilt for his wife, admitting his own weakness – all the things you’d expect on a suicide note. \n\n“Pretty standard, right?” Brett asked. He was still studying the body. \n\n“Yeah. Sad stuff.”\n\n“Shit’s depressing! Ain’t gonna lie.” Brett shrugged his shoulders. “Let’s hang out by the cruisers. Crime scene should be here soon.”\n\nWe exited and walked out to the road. More neighbors were outside now, collected in small groups or comforting the grieving family. Brett pulled out his notebook. “When crime scene starts doing their thing, you mind talking to the daughter? Maybe get a little info on the last time she saw him alive, et cetera?”\n\n“Nah, no problem.” I glanced at the girl, now sitting in a heap on the hot driveway upset that her mom suddenly was getting some of her hard earned attention. “Don’t want to deal with that again, huh?”\n\n“Nope.” Brett answered succinctly. \n\nA few minutes later, Brett was talking with crime scene and I prepared myself for the incoming barrage of crazy. “Melissa, right?” \n\n“Yeah.” She sniffed back a runny nose and looked up at me from the ground with red-tinged puppy dog eyes.\n\n“I’m Detective Jones. I’m very sorry for your loss but do you have a second to answer a few questions?”\n\n“Fuck off! She’s crying!” Tweaker boyfriend lashed out at me. The yappy dog began barking at the sky and turning in circles again. \n\n“No, it’s cool Jareth. He needs to hear some answers.” She sniffed again while trying to get her feet, unaided by Jareth who stood back from us with clenched fists and gritted jaw. \n\n“You were close with your father?” I asked as she brushed herself off.\n\n“Yeah.” She looked around at the gathered crowd, possibly surveying to see what the next best move would be to garner more attention. “He was the only one who ever understood me.” Jareth bristled and made a sound of hurt surprise but Melissa ignored him. “I was going to move back in next week because my daddy needed his princess back.”\n\n“But I hear that was a sore subject with your mom?” I asked.\n\n“Fuck off! She’s not talking ‘bout that bitch!” Jareth spat in the direction of Melissa’s mom.\n\n“Jareth, shut up.”\n\n“Nah, Mel. Your mom killed that man. I’m gonna tell the pigs how it went down.”\n\n“I’m getting there, sheesh!” Melissa’s crying fit had all but dried up but I felt we were about to embark down another path of craziness. “Y’see, my mom drove my dad to kill himself by kicking me out. She needs to be arrested… for MURDER.”\n\nThe situation seemed to call for a dramatic pause, perhaps an ominous trio of chords played on an organ somewhere. I allowed it to linger, more out of confusion. “So, you think your mom killed him? With… guilt?” \n\n“Yeah. Guilt. And alcohol. She never stopped him from drinking.”\n\nI pretended to write that down in my notebook. There was already more than enough evidence in the home to suggest alcoholism as a prime contributor to this tragedy. “So, when did you last see him?”\n\n“About a week ago. He said I was going to move back in.”\n\n“Did he seem happy? Make any other statements?”\n\n“Yeah… happy… I guess. But, he did say mom was driving him crazy. I think she did this.” At Melissa’s direction, Jareth began jutting his jaw in the direction of her mother. \n\n“Y’hear that bitch! You’re going to jail!” He tried some sort of Crip walk dance but only succeeded in inducing cringes from nearby onlookers. \n\n“Jareth, I’m going to ask that you don’t yell again, ok? This is a rough time for everyone and you’re not helping things.” I squared off on the baggy-panted addict, showing him I wasn’t going to let him turn my scene into a side show. \n\nJareth wiped his nose with an exaggerated swipe of his hand while looking up at me from his thick brow line. “Yeah? Well, you gonna arrest that bitch? Or am I gonna have to knock her out?”\n\n“Jareth, stop!” Melissa stomped her foot.\n\n“Y’all pigs hadda use the taser on me last time. And you ain’t got a taser now.” He bladed his body towards me. I sighed and let him see me roll my eyes.\n\n“Stop it now! I’m serious!” Melissa struck her thigh with a pudgy fist for emphasis.\n\n“Nah, Mel. I’ma see some kinda justice done today.” Jareth rolled his neck in a Bruce Lee impersonation and shook his hands, whipping the leash of the still yapping dog and driving it into a slightly more intense barking frenzy.\n\nTwo patrol noticed the situation and began approaching from behind me. Jareth noticed them too and realized the window was quickly closing on his opportunity to become his girlfriend’s knight in shining armor. He pulled back a poorly formed first, intending to throw a haymaker in my direction. Melissa grabbed his arm though, and he lost balance from the unexpected and sudden physical restraint. The dog, however, had picked up on his intended target. While Jareth tumbled and tried to keep his balance, the dog lashed out and attacked my closest pant leg. It shook with the fury of a thousand constipated Chihuahuas and managed to sink two teeth into my shin before I kicked it away. Melissa and Jareth didn’t even notice. \n\n“You’re too stupid for your own good!” Melissa had turned her arm bar into a full embrace, face to face with the jagged toothed tweaker she loved. She tried to kiss him but he pulled away, yanking gangly arms and prying away his dirty fingers from her python like squeeze. Melissa laughed at his ineffective escape, thinking he was being coy apparently. Meanwhile, I could feel blood trickling down my shin. \n\n“What do you need us to do?” One of the patrol officers asked me, taking in the spectacle. \n\n“Grab the dog, I guess.” I winced as I pulled up my tattered pants leg. “I’ll get a hold of a supervisor.”\n\nBrett came walking over, intrigued by the strange love/hate dance going on. “What the hell did you do?”\n\n“Saved you a report of animal abuse by not stomping on that rodent.” I replied, looking over at the still snarling dog and wishing one of my kicks had been a little more on target. \n\nI ended up having to get the full course of anti-Rabies vaccinations as the dynamic duo had never properly kept track of what care their personal Cerberus had received. There was a bit of guilt on my part for the fact that it had to be quarantined at the same time Melissa was going through the loss of her father but a bit of that was alleviated two days later when she and Jareth were arrested by patrol, caught in the act of breaking into her former home and trying to make off with a pillowcase of \nher dad’s watches and mom’s jewelry. \n\nIf official case number three was any indicator, my time in Homicide was going to be eventful.

        "text": "This happened a few years ago. I'm sorry if it's a little long; I've been told that I can be a bit long winded at times. tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nMy wife and I were taking our kids to her folks' house for dinner; she was driving. The trip was around 20 miles or so, most on a busy surface highway. Somewhere between 2 and 3 miles down that highway, a police car pulled behind us and immediately lit his blues.\n\nI think a little background info is in order here. My wife has had numerous bad experiences with officers, mostly in rural areas but a couple within the bounds of \"civilization\" as we jokingly call our suburban home. These experiences range from an officer searching her car because \"it was unlocked\" to an officer riding her bumper at 1am on the freeway and then pulling her over because she attempted to evade what she perceived as a potential accident (she didn't know the other driver was a cop at the time). I, on the other hand, typically have at least cordial and usually pleasant experiences with the police. I took numerous courses in High School taught by a former SWAT member in my area and learned a deep respect for officers during that time. I also spent a good few years repossessing cars and had to frequently work with the local PD, especially after the owners reported their cars stolen... We would always call the repo in but sometimes, the owner was quick on the draw and the repo report hadn't gone through yet.\n\nSo, back to the story. Instead of pulling over immediately, despite my urging, and a number of \"good\" places like side streets, my wife drives approximately 1/4 of a mile down the road before pulling onto the curb. She didn't even go for a turn lane, just right there in traffic. The look on my face must have been something to behold because my wife looked over and immediately spurted out \"WHAT?\" \n\nI told her to pull forward the extra 100 ft or so to get into the closest turn lane and waved the officer forward before he got out of his car. He waved back, so I knew he saw my feeble attempt at communication. Once we were safely (ish) pulled over, he came up to the driver's side of our luxurious Plymouth Voyager and proceeded to first thank me for waving him forward and then ask my wife if she knew what the posted speed limit was.\n\nHer response was classic... \"I was just trying to set my cruise control for 55.\"\n\nShe was, in fact, trying to do so but I couldn't help the mental facepalm from crossing my otherwise neutral expression. The posted speed limit there is 45. It has been 45 for at least 2 decades, probably more and the officer informed her this.\n\nMy wife's response... \"But I was just trying to set my cruise control for 55!\"\n\n\"But ma'am, the speed limit is 45...\"\n\nThis went back and forth 3 or 4 times. After the second time, I tried to tell her to shut up but, she's hard headed and wouldn't listen. \n\nFrom the beginning of the stop, I could see that the officer wasn't planning to give her a ticket. He's from the same jurisdiction that I've lived in all my life and, I don't know, I can just tell. I've spoken with, and spent time with, so many officers in my county's PD that I just have a good feel for it.\n\nI could see the officer shifting between mild amusement to frustration and my attempts to get my wife to shut the hell up were becoming increasingly insistent. I think he saw my attempts to reign her in because after the last, most fervent attempt, he just smiled and told her in a very firm tone \"Ma'am, I'm not planning to give you a ticket but you're about to talk yourself into one!\"\n\nAt that point, my wife shut the hell up. Finally. After the officer took her license, wrote up the warning, and came back, I was able to talk to him for a brief second (he came to my side of the car because traffic on the main road had picked up a good bit). He thanked me again for realizing that we had pulled over in a very unsafe location and for waving him forward. I told him that it was no problem and related to him my experiences. I found out that my former teacher in High School had actually trained this particular officer and they have kept in touch. He promised to relay my greeting and we parted ways with a smile.\n\ntl;dr - Wife gets pulled over speeding and almost talks herself INTO the ticket by insisting she was trying to use cruise control for 10 over the posted speed limit. A valuable lesson was learned in respecting police officers and treating them as the human beings they are.\n\nEdit. Tense conflicts",

        "text": "When you work in a jail, there's certain things that come with the territory. One of the most common, and annoying, are drunks. Most of them just want to sleep by the time they come to us, but a fair share just want to run their mouths at anything and everything. I've seen guys who couldn't see straight pour out their life story to an empty chair by the booking rail, because a female was sitting in it when they came in and they think the girl can still hear him. Most of the drunks at this stage then progress to the angry and combative phase before passing out for then night, which is the most fun for me. One guy took the cake, though, for ultimate drunk misbehavior.\n\nPD brought us a guy on a Drunk in Public and some outstanding warrants. While he was on the rail waiting to be processed, he slowly grew impatient. He at least had the wherewithal to not cuss out the magistrate, but unfortunately he declined to extend that courtesy to the arresting officer or to anyone else working within earshot. I knew something was gonna happen when he started slurring at the officer hooking him back to the rail. \"Oh, juss put the cuffs on meh again, huh? Yeah, do that cuzz you feel big! Like a big man now, big man put on the cuffs on me, an' yer...big. Fuckin big dick Johnny law.\" While that line of speaking isn't at all uncommon at work, there was something in his tone of voice that hinted to me that I'd be seeing more of him later.\n\nOver time, his protests grew louder and more vulgar. His first target was the AO, who dutifully ignored him before deciding his car was a better place to finish his paperwork. After chasing him off of the officer desk, he turned his attention to his (also sloshed) rail neighbor. After being told in no uncertain terms by the other guy to \"shut the hell up before I make you eat your damn flipflops,\" he turned his attention to the booking sergeant.\n\n\"Hey! Ocifer! Can you let me go? I wanna go find that cop outside and give im the what for.\"\n\n\"Hey, you guys are real pricks, yknow that? I dinen even do anyTHINGGGGGGG! BETCH!\"\n\n\"Bunch of punk ass...punk...I ken beat you while I'm still tied to this fuckin table GRAAAARG\" *furiously rattles handcuffs*\n\n\"You're juss some...shitweasels! Yeah! Get a REAL JOB\"\n\nI will admit, his Mr. Lahey-inspired swear made me stop for a second and think about what a person had just said to me in real life. It was actually kind of funny in the moment, like he'd run out of other swears and made the decision to start saying stuff he'd seen on TV. My partner for the night, however, was unamused. It wasn't what he was saying that was bothering him, but rather the volume at which it was delivered, which was interfering with baseball game he was trying to watch on the waiting area's TV.\n\nMy partner that night, Jackson, was a little on the twitchy side. While he liked his post processing new commits, which was mostly paperwork, he really enjoyed going hands-on with the unruly customers of the day. With each new shouted insult, he became more and more unsettled in his chair before getting up and approaching Drunky.\n\n\"Hey bro. It's done for right now. Yelling's not gonna fix it. Take it down a notch.\"  \n\nDrunky mumbled an apology and settled back down to grumble to himself, and Jackson headed back to his chair and resumed his paperwork. The truce lasted about 5 minutes before there was another sudden outburst.\n\n\"Fuck the county. County can kiss my ass! MY ASS! MY ASS! ASS! ASS! ASS ASS ASS ASS, AAAASSSSSSS!\"\n\nJackson had seen enough. He turned to me as he threw on his Kevlar gloves. \"We got space in the back? I'm putting this guy up for a couple hours.\"\n\n\"Yes we do,\" I responded happily. I grabbed a keyring and some latex gloves and trotted down the steps after Jackson. I quickly uncuffed Drunky from the rail (all while the chorus of \"ASS ASS ASS ASS ASS\" rang in my ear) and stood him up. Drunky fell silent just long enough for Jackson to get a word in edgewise.\n\n\"Hey man, come with me. Come over here.\"\n\n\"Oh, fuckin finally. I get my fuckin PPFFFONNNEE CALLL now huh?\"\n\n\"Just come on, man. I'm not trying to hear all that.\"\n\n\"I'm getting on the damn phone.\"\n\n\"No. Come with me.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm not going unil *hic* until I...the phone.\"\n\nDrunky said this as he stopped in his tracks and looked Jackson dead in the eye. This was enough to get us both to step up to him, and for 4 other deputies to materialize next to us. The LT grabbed him, and gave him a gentle comealong to the cells in the back. He was surprisingly compliant, and despite being very vocal about his desire for the phone, went into the cell with minimal resistance. We locked the door behind him, and I was nominated to explain to him why he was in grown-up timeout. Jackson stomped back to his post, upset that he was missing the bottom of the 9th. Everyone else wandered back to what they were doing, leaving me to try to calm the angry drunk.\n\n\"Let me out of this fuckin box, dude. I need a phone call.\"\n\n\"Ok, for now, you're gonna stay back here until you calm down.\"\n\n\"I am FUCKIN CALM YOU BITCH give me the PHONE\"\n\n\"Nope. You're back here for a couple hours. You want a mat to lay down? Blanket?\"\n\n\"It's damn cold in here so YEAH I WANT A BLANKET\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know. I'll get you a blanket.\"\n\nI retrieved a mat and a blanket and returned to find him with his face smooshed in the open tray slot.\n\n\"About damn time. Can I use the phone yet?\"\n\n\"No. Take these.\" I quickly opened the door to hand him his sleeping accommodations before shutting it again. Drunky slowly placed them on the floor before turning back to me, and his demeanor had suddenly changed. Gone was the yelling, the swaying, and (most of) the slurring. Drunky stepped to the window and looked directly into my eyes.\n\n\"Deputy, if you don't give me the phone, I'm gonna shit myself. I gotta shit real bad, and I'm gonna shit myself.\"\n\nI was taken aback at both his sudden soberness and his vehement declaration. \"...What?\" \n\n\"I want a phone call, or I'll shit myself. To spite you.\"\n\n\"Well the phone isn't happening, and you're not getting any more blankets, so I advise that you shit in the toilet. Sir.\"\n\nWith that, I left, and Drunky reverted back to his favorite standby (\"ASS! ASS! I'll SHIT MYSELF! ASS!\") as I exited the area. I sat back down at post to comprehend what had just happened, and soon I forgot about it as other work made itself a priority. A few hours later, I was knocking out my shift paperwork, when the trustee came up to my post.\n\n\"Hey, Dep, the guy in the back says he needs help. He's real upset. Also, it smells kinda weird in there, I think he's flooding his toilet.\"\n\nAt the same time, my desk phone rang. I thanked the trustee and picked up the phone.\n\n\"Muff_Huffer. Post 4.\"\n\n\"Hey, it's Control. The guy in the back, #5, hit his intercom, he's in some kind of distress. Need response.\"\n\n\"It's one minute to shift change. Is it urgent?\"\n\n\"He didn't say if it was medical or not, so we have to treat it that way. Go have a look. We'll tell your relief where you are.\"\n\nI sighed and grabbed some gloves. Jackson looked at me with a cocked eyebrow. \"I think he shit himself, man. You trying to give me a hand?\" Jackson shook his head and went back to his paperwork. Looked like I was going it alone. I approached the cell, looking for the telltale evidence of fecal fingerpainting. Mercifully, there was none, but a powerful odor emanated from the cell. Drunky was sitting on his mat, gently crying, covered in tan goop. I approached the door cautiously, not wanting to breate any more of the stench coming from the tray slot than I had to.\n\n\"Hey, man, are you good? What happened?\"\n\n*sniff*\"Man...I got real mad, so I...so I fuckin pissed myself, man, cuz you guys are assholes.\"\n\n\"You urinated on yourself?\"\n\n\"I was sitting here, and I *sniff* I just did it, man. And then I tried to go to sleep, so I layed down, but I damn pissed on the mat. *sniff* Then it just...it went in my fuckin mouth, man!\"\n\nDrunky started to cry a little more heavily, like a pouty child. I could hear my relief approaching the door. As much as I hated to leave a puky, piss soaked problem for the next shift to deal with, I really couldn't envision myself staying for an extra 13th hour to clean this guy off and dress him again. \n\n\"So it got in your mouth, and that's when you threw up?\"\n\n*sniff* \"Yeah, man.\" There was a beat before Drunky looked up at me with sad, drunk, puppy eyes. \"Did you get what you wanted? I just need the damn phone.\"\n\nAt this moment, my relief poked his head through the door. \n\n\"Hey man, you got the keys? Jesus, what happened here?\"\n\nI shook my head and handed him the keyring. \"Better if you don't know. You got one for the nurse. Wear gloves.\"\n\nAnd with that, I headed home for the warm, dry embrace of my bed.",

While enroute, dispatch says: \"driver of the vehicle is now fleeing the scene on foot.\" After hearing this....I drive a little bit faster.\n\nOnce I arrive, a bystander approaches me and says she saw everything. I immediately ask which direction the driver ran. She tells me, \"no one ran away, the driver is still in the vehicle\". Slightly confused, I take a look inside of the vehicle and damn right they are inside. Just not in the condition I was expecting...... driver had a gunshot wound to the head. \n\nLong story short, turned out that there was a conflict between two people and one shot the other in the head.

I'm at the hospital taking photographs of the victim after the hospital staff pronounced him dead. My supervisor approaches me and asks me to ask the family what funeral home service the family would like. When asked, I was told the family is inside of the family room waiting. \n\nSo... like an idiot, I assume they were already up to date on the details ( saw security talking to them and they were crying ). I then walk up and ask what funeral home they would like to use............. \n\nWrong way to notify someone their loved one has passed.... Turns out that all they knew was that a loved one is in the hospital. Felt like a real asshole.... And to top it off, I found out that this is the second death by shooting in that family within the past year.\n\nTell me someone else has had worse???? ",

        "text": "This is back when I was on training, fresh out of the academy, and had an FTO. FTO's have a tendency to get really bored because they're watching the trainee do everything, and if the trainee does everything right, the FTO's have nothing to do.\n\nMy FTO decided to drive for a day. We stopped an old junker car for some violation that I don't recall. My FTO contacted the driver, while I stood nearby as backup. Even 10 feet from the car, I could smell marijuana coming from it. We ran a criminal history on the driver, and he was on probation that allowed a full search, and had a prior felony conviction. Due to the smell, we had probable cause to search the car anyway. And this was before tons of states had begun legalizing marijuana. I got the driver out of the car, put him in handcuffs, and watched him as my FTO searched the car. The driver was in tears.\n\nAs expected, my FTO found some marijuana. It was individually packaged in a handful of small baggies, with a scale nearby. The entire value was probably under $200, but that's still felony possession for sale. After not finding anything else, my FTO pulled it out and asked the driver, \"Is this everything?\" The driver replied, \"Yes, sir.\"\n\nMy FTO looked at what he had, contemplated, and put it back in the car. \"Let him go.\" I didn't see that coming. I removed the handcuffs and let him go.\n\nWe got back in the car, and my FTO did a quick debrief. \"That man is a felon. No one will hire him. There was no heroin, no meth, no pills; just a minuscule amount of marijuana that the DA doesn't care about. And the only reason he's selling that is because he can't afford to eat otherwise. We can take him to jail and get an arrest stat, just be doing our jobs, and get an \"atta-boy\" from the Sergeant for another number. Or we can consider the human side, let him go, and have someone in the community who hates us just a little bit less.\"\n\nWhen this story happened, we were tracking tickets written, misdemeanor arrests, felony arrests, crash reports, cars impounded, traffic violation warnings, and a few other points of interest. A few years later, we added community relations as an important statistic.",

This is when they're nearly done with their academy training, and they know which office they've been assigned to. We take them through the area, give them a basic orientation, and then go through our day like normal, with them observing. I had one cadet ride with me, and two other Troopers each had one. As I spoke to my cadet, I learned none of the new Troopers assigned to my office volunteered for it. They were too scared because of all the stories they heard.\n\nWe were on four lane freeway, in heavy traffic, when I passed a car I wanted to stop. It was a newer (but not new) Mercedes with no license plates and blacked out windows. I pulled to the shoulder and stopped as I waited for it to catch up.\n\nThe cadet asked, \"You going after the Mercedes?\" Even he knew it was shady.\n\nI pulled in behind it and turned my car's lights on. The car in front of the Mercedes pulled to the right, and the Mercedes accelerated. People will do that to make a lane change into a gap to their right as they're pulling over. Another car in front of the Mercedes pulled over, and the Mercedes accelerated again. And we had gone from 20 to 60 miles per hour. Sirens on.\n\n\"Unit 2 to Dispatch, failure to yield.\" \n\n\"Unit 2, failure to yield, go ahead.\"\n\n\"Westbound on I-60, approaching 2nd Street. White Mercedes sedan, original want was no license plates.\" At this point the Mercedes cut hard right and started driving between lanes of slower traffic, splitting cars. I put the pedal to the floor, felt my car downshift, and...hit the brakes.\n\nI told the cadet, \"Nope. Nope nope nope. Not with you in the car.\" I watched as the Mercedes cut across 3 lanes to the left, back across 2 more lanes, and disappeared. I turned my car's lights off.\n\n\"Unit 2, I am not in pursuit due to having a ride along. Suspect vehicle last seen at approximately 60 miles per hour, driving recklessly across all lanes.\" My department doesn't like us pursuing when we have people in our car other than Troopers. \n\n\"Unit 2, I copy not in pursuit. Suspect last seen still approaching 2nd Street.\" Another unit was a half mile ahead, just past the 2nd Street exit. I drove by him 10 seconds later, and he made the ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ gesture. The Mercedes had exited immediately, and the other unit never saw it.\n\nThe cadet apologized, \"I'm sorry you had to cancel because of me.\" I told him, \"It's not a big deal. There will be another one tomorrow. Welcome to the office.\"",

It was a normal day, but the traffic volumes were higher than normal for the time, but that's okay because I like it when it's busy. Two young 20 year olds are inside the officer to be searched and I can tell they've had a bit of a rough go. Ripped clothes and caked with dust. \n\nI start talking to them and I find out that they are returning from a music festival. I ask them all of our standard questions but I'm not really picking anything up in regards to them being nervous. They seem to be pretty relaxed and of the hippie type, which are always interesting.\n\nI grab their keys and go out to the vehicle which is an equally worse for wear panel van. These kind of searches are always hit and miss as sometimes these people have very strange, not illegal things with them. Other times, it's quite disgusting. Like a person from Burning Man Festival with a red Thermos filled with urine.\n\nAnyways, I search their vehicle and find no contraband. However as I am going through one of their bags, I find the strangest object I have ever encountered. After staring at it for a while, I enjoyed the feeling of the mystery of it and I decided I wouldn't ask about it.\n\nIt was a diagonally cut slice of bread, like how a child would eat a sandwich, that had been laminated with a profuse amount of glitter set into the laminated bread. There was a small bite taken out of the longest edge. Attached to the laminate were 2 pop can tops, the thing that actually opens the hole in a pop can. A golden plastic necklace had been attached to these can tops to make some kind of necklace. Additionally, a molded plastic gun and a sponge was also attached to the necklace.\n\nI just stood there, dumbfounded as it pulled this thing out of his bag, so confused as to its relevance.\n\nI eventually let them go and I didn't really have any concerns about their stuff, but that slice of bread still is on my mind as to why they had done that. I regret not asking them the reason they made it but I also enjoy the strangeness and mystery behind it.\n\nP.S. please disregard any nonsense as I am at the end of a very long block.",

I met him while with my SO and I wasn't feeling that great so we left. Later, I came back to have a cigarette and he was there again. This time I was alone, and I struck up a conversation.\n\nHe seemed really nice, asking me about college and work and my relationship, and if I felt better than I did earlier. I could see his badge at this point and asked him about being a cop (previously I hadn't noticed). \n\nWhen I was ready to go and leave again, I told him to have a nice day and started walking away, since I figured it was just friendly talk, and he asked if it would be too much for my phone number. I felt pressured in a way because he had talked to me about dating as a cop, and made it a pretty front and center part of our conversation, so I gave it to him. He texted me later on asking if I was with my SO and that I should make time for him.\n\nI've blocked him since. I know that he probably meant no harm, but I felt like he was his using his career (he was basically flashing the badge by the end of the conversation when he asked for my number) to get me to give him my number, and that made me really uncomfortable. \n\nHe was also asking random questions as if he was trying to profile me, which was also weird. Maybe this is just r/relationships territory but I felt uncomfortable with the whole situation (especially because he was on duty and talking about his own illegal drug use to me, someone he does not know). \n\nDid I do the right thing by blocking and moving on? \n\nEdit: I forgot to add that he's SIGNIFICANTLY older than me, and commented on how my relationship likely wouldn't last (not sure if that's relevant to the post at all- this is all just real weird to me) ",

        "text": "This is my first time posting here. I'm on mobile, so formatting maybe wrong and just go ahead and expect some typos or 9.\n\nThis is a story about a county sheriff that pulled me over...twice.\n\nEarly one morning I wake up and start getting around for a job interview. As I'm in the bathroom shaving, I get a call from my girlfriend. Thinking it was odd she is calling so early, I answer and ask if anything was wrong. She had been in a wreck and rolled her vehicle. Without missing a beat, drop the razor, wipe my face, throw clothes on and start hauling ass to her location.\n\nNow, at this time I'm in between jobs and had been without a paycheck for close to a month and a half. I did have some money saved up to keep the important bills paid(rent, utilities, food), but I figured I'd let my car insurance go and reinstate it when I got my new job.\n\nI get on the highway heading to her. I had my phone plugged into the stereo for hands free reasons. I call and let her know that I am on my way and id be there in roughly 10 minutes. I hang up with her and call the company I was having an interview with and told them I would be unable to make it to the interview and id pass on the job. Luckily, they lady understood and still wanted to interview me, so we scheduled another interview 8 days away. As I'm talking with her, I see the ever so obvious red and blue lights right behind me. Thinking to myself that this was a wonderful start to the day, I signal right and pull to the shoulder.\n\nNow, a good portion of my family is or was law enforcement. So I kept botb hands on the steering wheel in clear view. The sheriff starts walking towards my window and the conversation goes as follows:\n\nS: Good morning sir.\nM: Good morning officer.\nS: any idea as to why I stopped you?\nM: I'm going to take just a wild guess and say speeding(because I was...last I looked I was about 20 over)\nS: yeah, I got you at 22 over and you don't have you seatbelt on.\n*I looked down and saw*\nM: I apologize officer, I just have a lot going on right now and wasn't thinking straight. My girl just got into a roll over accident at 123 parkington lane. I was just trying to hurry and get there and make sure she was okay.\nS: understandable, but that's why we have first responders. You have your drivers license and insurance?\n*at this point it hit me like a ton of bricks. I didn't have an active insurance policy which means my truck foes bye-bye*\nM; well, sir....yku might want to go ahead and call a wrecker to tow my truck because i don't have a current insurance policy.\nS: okay, well hand me your drivers license and I'll be right back.\n\nThe entire time he was in his car, I was getting scared and nervous. Thinking to myself what I would do if my truck got towed. How I would be able to get it out of impound, where the money would come from, everything. I see him get out of his car and start walking back up.\n\nS: So, this is what's going to happen. *I see a ticket book and think we'll shit, might as well say bye to my truck* I'm not going to write you a ticket for speeding since you've never had any. I am going to ticket you for your seatbelt, though. Sign here.\nM: *shaking badly, I sign* thank you, sir.\nS: Now about your insurance. I'm not going to do anything about it today, so you can calm down now. *I start to tear up here* Just do me a favor and get insurance on this truck ASAP.\nM: Can I shake your hand? You don't know how happy you just made me.\n*I shake his hand*\nS: just keep your foot out of it, pur your seatbelt on and go check on your girlfriend.\nM: Thank you very much, officer.\n\nAbout a month later my girl and I are going to breakfast to celebrate me getting my new job that can support both of us, in our own place together. I'm driving down the highway scream-singing with my girl to Journeys Don't Stop Believing. I check my rear view and notice those wonderful red and blues. So I signal right and pull over.\n\nLooking in my side mirror as the sheriff gets out, I notice he looks familiar. Low and behold it's the same sheriff who pulled me over previously. He gets to my window and it goes like this:\n\nS: Good morning\nM: Good morning officer.\nS: any idea why I pulled you over?\nM: to be honest, I don't have a damn clue...but you were the officer who pulled me over about a month ago. Weren't you?\nS: I am. I don't normally stop people at random. I have a reason for this stop. *he looks over at my GF* is that your better half, the one that got in the accident?\nM: how you remembered that is beyond me but yes, this is her.\nS: glad to see you're doing well.*speaking to her*\nGF: I'm still recovering but doing much better, thank you sir.\nS: Now, I know you have your DL but do you have your insurance card?\nM: I actually do, sir. *hands him both DL ad ins*\nS: fantastic. I don't have to do any paperwork. *hands both back to me\" just remember to keep your foot out of it and wear your seatbelt. Have a nice day.\nM: Thank you sir and you stay safe out here.\n\nI just want to thank any and all LEOs on here for doing what y'all(geographical reference here) do. It's getting to be more dangerous now, but I can promise you this...aa a civilian. If I see any LEO who needs assistance because some dumb fuck doesn't know how to follow orders, I'll gladly jump in and assist you. You guys/gals are almost fighting a war it seems and the media is putting a negative spin on all LEOs....one bad apple doesn't speak for everyone.\n\nBACK THE BLUE!",

Sometime during the 70's my parents owned a Dodge Charger that they had purchased from one of my uncles when he upgraded to something faster.  One night my parents, sister and I were coming home from one of my parents friend's homes after a late night of playing cards.  My sister and I were in the back seat, parents up front.  It was late, probably 1:00am, driving down a \"main\" 4 lane road when a traffic light changes from green to yellow.  My dad, seeing no one really around so late decides to accelerate through the yellow light, but was far enough away that he didn't make it through before it turned red.  Immediately as he gets to the other side of the intersection, he gets lit up by an officer.  He pulls over to the side of the road and waits, doing everything right.  The officer comes to his window, goes through the normal routine, and asks my dad why he decided to go through the light instead of stopping.  My dad just replies, \"Well, by kids are in the back seat without seat belts.  If I had to stop quickly for the red light they would get thrown forward, so I just went through.\"  The officer shines his light in the back seat, sees my little sister and I, and tells my dad to have a good night and drive safe, letting him off with a warning.  Ah, the \"good old days\", how did we ever survive?  lol\n\nEdit:  Chevy to Dodge, my bad",

Now to the full story.\n\nI was going home from my buddies home, who also happened to be my dealer. At the time, I owned a little 49 CC Tao-Tao chinese scooter since it was summer and a hell of a lot better on gas than my truck. In the state I lived in at the time, they weren't required to have insurance or registration, but I still did both in case of anything happening to it. I decided to ride home (it was a beautiful night) about 3 miles away. I had no issues with the ride for the most part, until i was about a half mile from my place. I was stopped at a stop sign and was going to turn when a car blew by my, running their stop sign, making me swerve off almost mounting the sidewalk. I wasn't high at the time, so I was able to regain control. There was a local police officer that turned onto the road i was on as I regained control, and I saw him turn his lights on. Knowing full well that I could possibly go to jail, I still pulled over (it's not like I could outrun him). He pulled up behind me asked for some ID as well as my registration and insurance, to which I immediately comply. He looks over my information, and asks why I was swerving, so I told him what had happened. He seemed pretty cool about it, and ran my info real quick to make sure I didn't have any warrants or anything. Before he handed me back my info, he asked if I had anything on me that I shouldn't have. It was at this point, I could have lied about the 3.5 grams of weed in my pocket, but I was told when I was younger,never lie to cops, most of the time they get it, so I told him I had some weed on me (but I'm still pretty sure he could smell it, it was some good stuff). I told him it was in my right front pocket. He paused for a moment, as if he couldn't believe I would willingly tell him. He told me to get off the scooter and slowly remove it from my pocket, so I did. I hand him the weed, and he asks me why I had it since I had a good paying job and a decent place, so I told him. He looked at me for a minute, then at the weed, gave it back to me and said that he wasn't going to do anything about it and to be safe. I then proceeded to go home, smoke a bit, and go to bed for the evening, thankful that I was honest with a cop and not in jail.  ",

Then the BMV tries to stall long enough for us to arrive and investigate.\n\nWe got one of those calls, three males, trying to pay the registration on a car that had been reported stolen. That was a little weird since he wasn't trying to transfer it. Due to there being three suspects, myself and my partner Winters both went.\n\nWe contacted the BMV staff, who gave us all the information the suspect had provided, like his license and the renewal notice and the current owner information. We talked to the main suspect, call him John. John told us how he was trying to pay the registration for the car. He had the registration notice in hand, with his name on it, dated a couple months ago.\n\nBut I had the current owner information in hand, which was not him. The stolen report had the current owner's information on it, also not John. I asked him where the car was. He said it was parked at his apartment. I asked him if he knew the current owner according to the BMV, and he said no. So I asked him how the car got to his apartment, and he said he drove it there.\n\nHe told me he went on vacation for 6 months. While on vacation, he left his car parked on the street. When he came back, it was gone. A few days later, walking down the street near his house, he found his car in a different spot. Since he had the keys, he drove it home. He realized the registration was nearly expired, so he came in to pay it.\n\nJohn had one other critical piece of paper - a proof of lien sale from a tow company that he found in his car. And that told me John had stolen his own car, as it was no longer his car.\n\nJohn parked his car in a no-parking zone, and it was towed away. The tow company did their due diligence, and sent certified mail to John's old address that was on file with the BMV. The tow company told John he needed to come pick up his car, and would have to pay to get it out of impound. Two months later, John was still out of the country, and had moved, so he never got a notice. By that time, the storage fees were worth more than the car, which allowed the tow company to sell the car to pay off the debt.\n\nSo they did. And by a matter of pure coincidence, the person who bought it lived down the street from John. John happened to find it, completely unaware that he was no longer the owner, and committed a felony by stealing it with the keys and driving it to his home.\n\nWinters and I reviewed the paperwork, discussed the explanation, and decided John didn't need to go to jail. John gave us the keys, and we returned the car to the current owner.\n\nJohn was curious how much the tow yard sold it for. The paperwork he had showed they sold it for $1200. John felt better, because he only paid $500 for it.",

I know it's late and we suppose to get off right now but let's do some police work.\" I laugh and say, \"Didn't you just arrest two people in your zone today for some domestic shit?\" Joe replies, \"Yeah so lets go catch some criminals instead of babysitting some rich yuppies!\" \n\nJoe keys up, \"365, drop that code 2 to myself and 363.\" I then hear my sergeant key up, \"360, you got something in *******?\" \n\nDispatch: \"10-4 units, be advised subjects last seen heading north up Street Road, four black males wearing black pulling on door handles.\"\n\nJoe activates his lights and we make a quick turn around via our only roundabout in our district. I'm right behind Joe as we start accelerating to get back to our original zones. Sadly the radio station was playing some bland rock music and I couldn't enjoy the drive. \n\nJoe keys up on his radio and tells me he is going to go up the road the suspects  were traveling, I make a right turn and decide to parallel the suspects and attempt to cut off the suspects at the next intersection. \n\nI get to my spot and see nothing for a few minutes and think to myself shit, I could be on my way home right now if it wasn't for this stupid wild goose chase. \n\nJoe key's up, \"Units be advised subjects are armed and fired several shots at the victim, no one is injured last seen heading north bound and entering a vehicle, blue SUV, no plate or model,  heading north bound.\" \n\nMy heart rate kicks up an extra notch and I start scanning the area for a blue SUV. I don't see anything. \n\nBEEEEEP; Units be advised we are getting reports shots fired in your area. I laugh for a second, my partner had literally just said that, Joe keys up and states he has the victim and it's code 4, area is safe no one is injured. \n\n\"Unit 360, I have a blue SUV heading westbound on ***** Boulevard, be advised they are traveling at a high rate of speed.\"\n\nI activate my lights and sirens and start turning my engine over as I attempt to catch up to my Sergeant and the vehicle chase. My Sergeant has a very calm voice on the radio as he gives out directions of the chase. I catch up to him about a minute later and I take over lead as he continues to handle the radio. Joe keys up and states the vehicle is stolen, he had done the report literally a day ago. The blue SUV, a stolen Nissan Rouge is all over the place at a high rate of speed.  \n\nI'm right behind the vehicle as it attempts to shake me by making  several turns. I see him make a left turn and attempt to go back the way he just came up. In the back of my mind I realize he is attempting to get on to the freeway, my department doesn't allow me to P.I.T. or have spikes so I'm just waiting for the guys to bail or crash the vehicle.  \n\nThe vehicle makes another left turn and starts accelerating down a very curvy road and the driver loses control after hitting a pile of lumber, I watch the vehicle in slow motion as it turns on it side and starts flipping. I get right up on the crash and see two black males exit the destroyed vehicle and start fleeing towards a building. I key up on the radio and give out the description stating both males were bleeding, I think to myself how in the fuck are these kids still running? \n\nIronically its a building I know quite well, its the building that houses officers, a certain kind of officer, our horse officers and additionally a ground for training our K-9 units. \n\nMy Sergeant and myself along with Joe start a perimeter as more units start to assist. A K-9 officer arrives and see's the blue Nissan Rouge on its side and asks the Sergeant what he needs. Sarge tells him we have a perimeter lets find these kids additionally they might be armed. \n\nWe apprehend both black males without issue and then search the vehicle finding a stolen firearm, some marijuana, and quite a lot of stolen items. \n\nJoe and I watching the vehicle as its flipped back on to its side by the tow company, Joe looks at me and say's \"You know they (suspects) know we leave at 2:45 A.M. to head back, all they had to do was wait an extra 5 minutes and we wouldn't have even taken the call.\" I look at the stolen vehicle, \"Good thing their idiots...Joe?\" \n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Are those two black females walking by our scene?\" \n\nHe responds, \"Yeah\" \n\nI ask him, \"Weren't there four suspected black males?\" \"Yeah, but they could have been women.\"\n\nWe stop the women and they have the audacity to give us fake names and have stolen property in their pockets. \n\nAt the end of the day the two black males were arrested on several felony counts as well as the two black females. My partner and I didn't get home till 5:00 A.M. in the morning when we are suppose to get off at 3:00 A.M. It was a great arrest and neither Joe nor I had to write that report, which made it that bit sweeter. ",

        "text": "So, I was on my way to drop off my father in law back to his place, I was driving my 77 Ford Supercab at the time. The previous owner had replaced the 3 point seat belts with simple lap belts. \n\nAs I traveled down the city street, an officer just pulled behind me from a side street. I thought to myself at the time I was going to have a problem. Sure enough, the lights come on. I pull into a parking lot and retrieve my license and registration. I exited the truck so I can get out of earshot of the father in law as this would agitate him. \n\nThe officer checked my paperwork and came bock out of his cruiser telling me the reason he pulled me over was because I wasn't wearing my seat belt. I brought the officer to the drivers side of my truck and reached for the lap belt and explained to him that he just simply couldn't tell as they are lap belts. Because the truck was older than he was familiar with, he also didn't know that it was not original equipment. He proceeded to let me off with a warning. I was chatting with him for a couple minutes just at the rear of the cab when my wife pipes up without the officer asking her anything \"the reason I'm not wearing my seat belt is because it doesn't work\". I was dumbfounded. First, I talk myself out of a ticket and she is talking herself into one. She then repeated herself a second time and proceeded to say it a third time when I finally told her to be quiet already. \n\nThe officer must have had sympathy for me as he still let me off. I then had to have a conversation with my wife about times where you should really keep quiet unless you are being asked a question. ",

(15Mi. for you southerners.)\n\nWhile on their way back home, My father was driving the old truck at about 70km/hr (posted limit was 100) just so they could hear each other converse, while his friend was in the passenger side trying to light a joint with product that was picked earlier that day.

        "text": "There's a TL;DR at the bottom as this is a pretty long post, but I encourage you to read. It's a crazy story. \n\nMy wife was driving back home from visiting her parents just this last February when a bad winter storm hit. Roads iced over fast and she hit some black ice on the highway. \nEnded up flipping over a barrier and into a ravine filled with water.  The car settled in upside down, and the impact shattered the windows so water started pouring in. \n\nThere was one driver not too far behind her who saw it all happen, so he phoned the police and said \"you're not going to be able to find her in this weather, so I'll wait for you to come and I'll point out the car to you.\"\nSo he waited on a very dangerous highway for the police to come. \n\nCrazy part was that there just happened to be an officer about a minute down the highway, because he was helping a stuck driver change his tire.\n\nHe got down to the witness and they determined where the car was. The officer walked out, popped some flares and with one look, knew the situation was dire. He radioed in and said \"send everything.\"\nEverything meaning all the usual first responders in weather like this...more police, ambulance, firemen and a tow truck. \nOfficer Phil (his name has been changed) tried to get into the car while he waited for everyone, attacking the passenger door as much as he could with a prybar. \nHe couldn't get to my wife tho, because the car was too nestled into this ravine. Just completely surrounded. He later described it as basically being a pool ball in a pocket. \n\nMore police showed up, and they're all in this freezing cold water trying to get her out. The Sergeant was literally on top of the upside down car with an axe, trying to get through the bottom. Apparently he actually managed to tear some chunks off, but he still couldn't get to her. \n\nBear in mind, she's underwater this whole time. \n\nFiremen showed up, they were able to use a narrow saw to slice her door off, but because the car was still so enclosed, they still couldn't do much else.\nThen the tow truck came. They wrapped chains around the car and pulled the vehicle out of the ravine, the door slid right off the car as soon as it was free.\n\nOfficer Phil rushed to her side and pulled my wife out of the car, but she was VSA, and pale as a sheet. She had been underwater for 24 minutes. \n\nAmbulance came, they took a look at her and said they probably wouldn't need an escort (never a good sign) to the hospital. \nThey tried to resuscitate her anyway, knowing that the freezing water could have helped her.\nIt did. \nThey were able to get a pulse after throwing everything and the kitchen sink at her...epi, adrenaline, defib. The works. She held on and they got her to the hospital.\nWhen I arrived, they said she probably wasn't going to make it. Asked me if we should pull the plug. Cardiac arrest and brain damage were the biggest concerns. I said we were going to keep going. \n\nAfter that, it was two weeks in a coma where myself, the family and the doctors had no idea what to expect. MRIs and CT scans showed no diffuse hypoxia (oxygen deprivation) in her brain which was good. There was a small stroke and some bleeding in her amygdala, but that's it.\nStill...the brain is a funny thing, and they couldn't tell us anything for sure until she came out of the coma. There was also some kidney failure, but a couple days on a dialysis machine fixed that. \n\nIn the meantime, a friend had set up a GoFundMe page for the wife and I. We received around $10,000 from friends and complete strangers, and more than that in prayers....literally thousands of people from all over the world were involved in some way.\n\nEventually she started to wake up. Over the course of another couple weeks, she continued to heal and yes...incredibly, made a full recovery. \nShe's totally fine now, with some new scars (two major surgeries: tracheostomy and laporotomy), and she's even driving again. She has no recollection of the accident, so the personal trauma has thankfully been pretty minimal.\n\nWe submitted a request a couple months ago to the police department that the officers involved get special recognition. They did so much for us, and at the very least had risked hypothermia/pneumonia to rescue my wife, and they had done it all with the attitude that this was a rescue, not just a recovery. Not only that, but two of them had stayed behind with me in the hospital until my family arrived. \nNext month, they're getting a heroes citation. My wife and I will be at the ceremony.\n\nTL;DR - wife was in a very serious car accident. The efforts of a witness, emergency personnel and strangers on a GoFundMe page all led to a full recovery. \nMany strangers had pulled together for us and the officers involved were champions. It was incredible. ",

        "text": "This occurred about 15+ years ago…\n\nOne summer a few years after high school, a few friends and I decided to get together one Friday evening and have a few alcoholic beverages.  A few of my friends had just turned 21, some still 20, and I was the youngest out of the group only being 19.  Everyone was still living at home with their parents while going to school/working/etc., so finding a mutual location to have some drinks was difficult task.  After a short conversation, we decided on going to some makeshift BMX hills that were located behind a shopping center a town over.  So 6 of us all piled into my buddy’s car and head out with a couple cases of beer in the trunk.\n\nSince parking near the BMX hills wasn’t an option, we decided to park at the shopping center, grab the beers, and walk the rest of the way.  The area around was recently constructed and pretty well-lit, but there was complete darkness around the BMX hills, so there was little concern about being seen by anyone.  Once we got to the rear of the shopping center, we crossed a road and went back to the hills…lit a bonfire, hung out, and drank some beer.\n\nA few hours later, after getting bit by numerous mosquitos and putting a sizable dent in our cases of beer, it was decided we should change locations.  We gathered up the beer that remained, and started heading back towards the road behind shopping center.  During the walk back, it was decided that someone stay back with the beer and be picked up on the way out.  I volunteered to stay back with the beer to ensure its safekeeping.  So I’m sitting about ten feet back from the road in some high grass, drinking a beer and watching my friends walk towards the parking lot.  I lose sight of them for a few minutes, and then see their car drive towards the exit of the parking lot.  All of a sudden, I see two police cars drive right past me.  I thought to myself “Wow, I’m glad they didn’t see me.”  No sooner did I finish that thought, I was being lit up by a police car’s spotlight.  One of the police cars had turned around.\n\nI was approached by a young officer and asked the typical, “What’s your name? How old are you? Why do you have all of this beer? Who else is with you?”  While answering this officer’s questions, I am watching my friends drive in my direction, slow down as they are passing me, and casually drive away.  I’m thinking “Well...guess I’m on my own at this point.”  While speaking to the younger officer, an older officer arrives as his backup.  The older officer confronts me and starts interrogating me, asking me why I have all of this alcohol, asking who I was with, and how I got all of this beer.  He clearly didn’t like my answer of “I was drinking by myself” and threatened to take me to jail.  The younger officer took him aside and spoke a few words to him and calmed him down.  The young officer then asked me where I lived.  I explained I lived the next town over and he said “OK, dump all this beer out, throw the bottles in my trunk, and I’ll give you a ride home”.    The older officer left, clearly disappointed…and I was given a ride back to my parents’ house with two empty cases of beer.  The younger officer told me that the empty cases of beer was punishment enough.  I thanked him profusely for the ride home…and went back out with my friends shortly after.\n\nFun fact:  I am currently an LEO for that same agency…and the “young” officer is now one of my best friends.\n",

        "text": " I posted this a while ago on a jeep forum. The discussion was regarding individual rights and respect for law enforcement. I had several police friends at this time, a few in the family ( uncle is a sheriff, and would have smacked me if he would have been present for this ), and many who went LEO after military service. Anyway. \n\nStory time. \n  I have been stopped by the police many, many times.  Twice before I was even licensed to drive.  By \"many, many\" I mean probably more than thirty. Including twice in Puerto Rico, never did pay those tickets, and once in Japan (they couldn't catch me). \n\nAt this time, let me define 'stopped', as an interaction with a police officer that was initiated by the officer. Either for my behavior, or the behavior of those I was with. Only One of those was actually negative, and I was partly at fault for that.  This was probably around police interaction number 26 or so. \n\n  While walking with my friend to a party store for smokes, probably around 2200 or so, a marked car goes by, slowed down, then stopped for a second. It then made a u-turn and pulled up on us. As they were slowing down to stop my friend and I both jokingly asked each other \"what'd you do now?\"\n\n  There was 2 cops inside, windows down, they asked us to stop. We stood there for a few seconds, when the driver cop leaned forward, looked at me and asked \"what was your name again?\". Now, allow me to preface this digression with some history. \nWe lived just outside a Gang Injunction area, and my neighborhood would not be described as a good one. It was called the \"Blue Ghetto\" and I lived there with my family for over ten years. The police were in there all the time, so much so, that I had come to know many officers in our department by name. These two officers, I did not recognize. Back in 'those' days, I was what some people called abrasive or aggressive (read asshole). I did not like B.S. and had a quick reaction to stupidity. \n\n  I had never met either of these two officers before, so being asked for my name \"again\", I found very insulting, and I thought I smelled B.S. I said, \"I'm sorry, we've never met\". I stood up, and Ryan and I began to continue our walk to the party store. We got about three steps when I  heard \"Driver Officer\" slam it in park and his door opens. We stopped walking. \n\nHe says \"what Is your name?\". I tell him \"Bruce\". He asked for my last name. \"Willis\", I lied.  (For those who do not know me, I do not use my name on the Internet if i can help it (Sorry Bruce, love your movies) . I avoid use of all actual proper names to protect the innocent / guilty. Hence, \"Ryan's\" real name is not Ryan.  \n Driver officer smelled my B.S., and asked for my ID. I said something to the effect of I did not believe I needed to provide it for walking down the street. And asked \"why do you need to see my ID?\" He steps toward me said I fit the description of somebody they are looking for. \n\n  Ok, another digression. My appearance; I have on a fedora style top hat, think Slash or Clint Eastwood, an OD Green military Trench coat (WWII era), H&amp;H Harness Boots, and beautiful long Grey hair that I could tuck into my belt line. Yes, the hair was real, and I still have everything except the hair.\n  Now, I know I smell B.S. But I, (we) also come to understand that this officer is getting tired of my playing around. I inform him my wallet is in my pants pocket, and could i get it for him? He says yes, \"but turn and face that way\", which I do. He reads my name, and asks if I know that \"lying to the police is against the law, and punishable by, . . ?\" I said yes, and asked if the \"search\" they are conducting will be in the police blotter in the morning? \nI could feel him staring at the back of my head and wishing he could smack me like I deserved. \n\n  He asks Ryan for his name, Ryan tells him. Ryan's smart.\n  He says, \"here\" handing me my ID. I turn around, slowly. Look over at Ryan, look to the cop. Look over at Ryan, look back at the cop again. He's staring at me the whole time. Silence is a tool. \n\n He simply turned around, got in, and drove off without another word. \n\n  Now, were they truly looking for someone fitting my description? I highly doubt it.  Was there an entry in the blotter? I never checked, but I doubt that too. Passenger officer never said as much as a word. Was this a training exercise? Maybe.\nDid I need to be a jackass? No, but I was. \n\nChances are great, that if I had simply answered his question the first time, they would have went on his way.\n\n Anyway, thanks for reading. \nAnd I sincerely thank LEO's for their work. \nI support them every chance I get. \n\n Good day and God Bless. \n G. \n",

        "text": "A few years ago, I had the flu. At around 1am, my husband and I drive up to CVS to get me ginger ale and powerade. My stomach hurt, so I had reclined the passenger seat for the ride back home and was curled up in the seat, miserable and achy. \n\nWe had pulled out of the CVS parking lot and were driving on the main road, when I heard this really loud thunking noise. I sat up and looked out the window, looking for the source. It had come from the ford explorer in the lane next to us. His tire was completely flat, and yet he continued to drive pretty fast towards the red light. Once we were stopped at the red light, I looked over at him and tried to gesture towards his tire, and made eye contact. He was about my age(mid twenties), wearing a white tee shirt and a manic look on his face, his eyes looked wild, like he'd just finished drinking a few gallons of red bull. I remember noticing a really pretty pink and blue butterfly charm hanging from his rear view mirror.\n\nAs soon as the light turned green, he FLOORED it and got in front of us. I remember seeing the nice, perfectly inflated spare tire attached to the back of his explorer and thinking he should really pull over and put it to use. I must of looked away to fiddle with the radio or maybe my stomach ache got the best of me because I wasn't looking out my window when his tire came off. I remember my husband yelling \"WHOA!!\" and looking out my window, and seeing sparks flying in the air.\n\nThe man kept driving, his tire left in his wake. He got into the left turn lane, and we followed behind him(because this was the way home for us too). He turned left and I expected to see him turn off the main road onto one of the residential streets, and yet he kept going. About half a mile later, he got into the left turn lane again, to turn onto a smaller street with a 25 MPH speed limit. I watched in horror as he almost lost control, barely missing a mailbox as I dialed the police. \n\nAs I said earlier, I was sick and my voice was almost gone, so I handed the phone off to my husband. He put the call on speaker phone, and informed the dispatcher that a car was driving on a bare rim and didn't seem to have control of the vehicle. The dispatcher didn't sound particularly urgent about it, at first.\n\nThings quickly changed after my husband gave her the license plate number. I could hear her typing it in, and a few beats later she asked us if we were still behind him. He(husband) confirmed that we were, but that the maniac was going well over the 25MPH speed limit. While on the phone with us, I could hear her inform officers of the situation and instructing road blocks to be set up at several different upcoming roads. The dispatcher asked if we were still behind him, and we ended up staying on the line with her, informing her of what direction he was heading, but he was really speeding and it became harder for us to keep up.\n\nAt some point, while on the phone with the dispatcher, we lost sight of him. My husband and I had been able to see him from a distance for awhile because of the sparks flying in the air, but he must of been going 60MPH on a 25MPH road and as the distance between us grew, he must of turned down one of the many side streets. \n\nWe were really bummed out, and honestly when we informed dispatch that we had lost him, she sounded bummed out too. The dispatcher was talking in the background about more road blocks and we were just listening. I remember being confused as to why the phone call wasn't over when suddenly, a familiar noise!!\n\nI look up and see the sparks flying back our way, the driver had doubled back. When we lost him, my husband had pulled the car down a side street to turn around and head back towards home. So we informed dispatch that he just flew past us again, and she asked us if we would be able to get behind him. She told us that she had multiple units on the way, and we happily got behind him and began to follow him , giving constant updates on which streets we passed and what way we were going. We got to a flashing red light and finally, we see a police car turning behind the car. We let the dispatcher know that a police unit is now behind the car and the phone call ends.\n\nThe police car throws his lights on, and I think this is finally going to come to an end. I was wrong. The maniac driver sped up, somehow under the impression that a car with a tire missing can outrun the police. I kept expecting the man to pull over, but he just keeps speeding up, and he is having more and more trouble keeping the vehicle going straight. \n\nThe driver almost made it to the next stoplight, which is about a mile away from the point the police got behind him and turned on his lights. Suddenly, a group of police cars show up, each from a different side street, blocking the driver from the front, back and side, he had no options, they had swarmed and surrounded.\n\nDue to the fact that this was a police chase on a small road, my husband and I had hung back quite a bit, thinking it was not wise to follow too closely behind the police car once he got in front of us to pull over the maniac driver...so we were not close enough to the scene to see the police pull the man out of the car. All I know, is it must of been one heck of a fight, because when we did drive past, I saw about six police officers standing in a circle chugging water, and a shirtless, very red man being placed into the back of a police car. When I made eye contact with him back at the start, he had a shirt on lol\n\nI wish I knew for sure what happened that night, but my assumption is that the man stole the vehicle and was on some kind of drugs. That is the only reason I can think of as to why someone with a perfectly good spare tire on the back of their vehicle would drive for miles on a metal rim and more importantly, why someone would think a car in that condition had any chance at getting away. Additionally, one of the many police cars that showed up at the end was one from several cities away, and my husband theorized that the vehicle may of been stolen from that city. \n\nThis was years ago, but I still remember vividly the awful grinding noise of metal on concrete and how shocked I was at the amount of tall, vibrant sparks flying up as he drove. The next day, my husband and I noticed thin, black lines on the concrete from the chase. If the car was stolen, I would imagine the damage that car ended up with from driving for that long on bare rim was pretty bad.",

        "text": "     (I'm not the best writer. Sorry in advance)\n\nIt was a hot summer afternoon, the kind of hot that just sucks. The kind of day everyone you hope you can just drink sweet tea and see just how cold the A/C will get. Unfortunately, God, Yahweh, or whatever you’d like to call him had other plans. I was riding lead medic on our heavy rescue company, meaning I would be more or less in charge on all medical issues we handled that day. Our shift was busy like none other, as we went from a technical rescue of two electrocuted workers off high rise power lines to a seizure in a stuck elevator. In this moment, there were seven separate ongoing incidents (including the aforementioned two), requiring eight ambulances, in a town that staffed two. I hoped it would stay at that number. \n\nBut without fail, the radio beeped. Our police department had requested an ambulance (number 9, for those keeping score). Given the number of ambos already claimed, our fire truck would respond, essentially to buy time, while our dispatch scrounged up an ambulance from wherever.\n\nWe arrived to see two police cruisers in the driveway of a home in a residential neighborhood. While enroute, dispatch had radioed us to state that it was a committal, with no medical issues, and the scene was secure. They had found an ambulance that could take her. We’d just have to wait 30 minutes for it to arrive. I asked my crew to stay in the front yard, and I would take it solo. No need to flood the house with obnoxious firemen (sorry guys). This call would be mostly paperwork. Inside, an elderly woman, the owner and sole occupant of the home, was sitting at the dining room table with two police officers. I didn’t really know the cops. They were both younger, with about a year on each. They looked scared. The one handed me ‘the paper’, our little slang for the state issued packet of forms required for committing an individual against their will, in order to receive medical or psychiatric treatment. “Hey I filled this out right, right?” he squeaked out under his breath. Poor guy was sweating bullets from under his vest. I walked out to the other room with him to look, while the other cop chatted with the woman about traffic, politics, and life’s little wonders. Going over the paperwork, the officer filled me in on her story. Earlier in the day, this woman’s adult son had called her, and during the phone conversation, threatened to kill her. She notified the police. The police, in turn, arrested the son. Following that arrest, the police went to check up on the woman, who provided a statement and evidence against her son.\n\nOpen and shut case, right?\n\nWrong.\n\n During that process, she made statements about that she had regretted what she had done, and she should just end her life already. Turns out, the initial argument was regarding finances, as the woman’s illness was costing the family a fortune they simply didn’t have. “But here’s the thing”, the officer whispered, “I’m not sure she’s actually contemplating it. She says it’s a bad joke”. I went back to discuss the matter with our main character, the elderly mother. Tears streaming down her face, she swore up and down that it was a poorly timed joke, and she would never hurt herself in any way, shape or form. Her biggest concern was that since she was so sick, she wouldn’t make it out alive from whatever facility we brought her to. She wished to remain at home, and have her daughter and grandchildren over for dinner.\n\nI was torn. The woman presented no clear danger to herself, and wished to be among her family during what may have been her final days. On the other hand, she had expressed a wish to die, and met several of the criteria for placing a person at high risk for suicide. I was just as conflicted as the officers. We all wanted to trust her, and could have used our discretion to avoid hospitalization. At that same time, she had access to several ways to end her own life, and had a plan as to how she would end it. Not to mention, if she harmed herself in any way, the three of us would be criminally liable for failing to prevent her injuries or death. \n\nWhilst mulling it over, the ambulance crew finally arrived. I met them on the front lawn, telling the officers to keep our client calm and talking. The arriving crew were kind, but had little tolerance for deviation. “Hey bud. She threatened, yeah? And the forms signed?” they asked. The driver was an older man who probably had been napping when he got asked to drive thirty minutes. “Well she’s gotta go. We’ll take her” he mumbled and grabbed all of the paperwork in my hands. My fire crew was waiting in the rig, and I went to join them. Another call awaited.\n\nThis call was some time ago, but it stays in my mind. I do not know what happened to the woman. I hope she is well, with her family (Or at least, the part of her family that doesn’t threaten her). If she did pass, I hope it was peaceful, in a loving environment. When presenting to new recruits, I often share this. Police Officers, Fire Fighters, and EMTs do our jobs because we enjoy helping others. At times, that ‘helpful’ becomes ambiguous.\n",

        "text": "This story takes place in 2011. A young, naive, and blissfully ignorant version of myself had just graduated from college. I landed my first \"big girl\" job and moved into a high rise downtown apartment in a major metro area. From a small town a thousand miles away, I'd always wanted to live in a big city. I loved the skyscrapers and the fast-paced lifestyle. On my days off, I'd aimlessly wander around the city on foot for hours. I never once felt unsafe. The city has a reputation in the national media for extreme violence, but from watching the news, the majority of the shootings appeared to take place in specific neighborhoods far from the main downtown avenue that I lived on.\n\nAfter only a few weeks in my new place, I received a call that a family member back home was sick. I booked the first flight that I could get - a red-eye departing around 1 am. I finished up the work day, took the train home, and packed a bag. I googled the bus map and found a late night bus that departed a few blocks away from my apartment building.\n\nWhen it was time to catch the bus, I walked a few blocks down the empty street carrying my pomeranian in a dog carrier while rolling my suitcase behind me. I marveled at the empty streets and reached the bench at the bus stop with about 10 minutes to spare before the bus was set to arrive. I set the dog next to me and fiddled with my phone as I waited. Soon, I heard a vehicle approaching. I glanced up to see an armored police van slowly headed toward me. It pulled to a stop directly in front of me. Despite having done nothing illegal, I began to panic and my heart started to race.\n\nAn officer exited the passenger-side door of the vehicle, and abruptly demanded to know the reason I was sitting on a downtown bench in the middle of the night. His tone made me even more nervous, as I explained that I was waiting for the bus to the airport to catch a red-eye flight back home. He softened as he asked, \"you're not from around here, are you?\"\n\nIt turns out that I was pretty dumb. My neighborhood was very dangerous... but only after dark. Once the business people had filtered out of the skyscrapers and were whisked away onto the trains and buses, downtown wasn't a particularly safe place to be. The officer informed me that a shooting had just taken place on that very block less than two hours earlier, and the suspect had not yet been apprehended. \"Don't ever come out here at night. That kind of stuff happens a lot.\"\n\nI was stunned. As the officer headed back to the van, I started to think about what danger I might be in when they eventually left and my heart began to race again. He opened the passenger door, leaned inside, and spoke to the officer seated in the driver's seat for a moment. Then, he motioned for me to approach the van. He reasoned, \"we can't just leave you out here like this. Would you like a ride to the airport?\" A mixture of shock, anxiety, and gratefulness overwhelmed me as I quickly agreed. Then, I took a moment to look at the armored van. There were only two seats in the front cab, both occupied by the officers. This meant that my me, my dog, and my suitcase would be taking a trip in the armored box in the back, typically reserved for violent criminals. Both officers laughed when they saw my terrified expression as I speechlessly pointed to the box. Still laughing, the driving officer told me, \"it's not that bad back there, I promise. And it's a lot cheaper than a cab.\"\n\nI made it to the airport safely, and I got to text my friends back home some hilarious pictures of myself in the back of an armored police van in the middle of the night. Before they quickly drove away, I only had a brief moment to thank them after I was released from the back of the van. Those officers drove 25 minutes out of their way that night, just to make sure that a dumb kid was safe. I stumbled across this sub today and remembered those kind gentlemen. I moved away shortly afterward, but I still see news stories about the rising crime rate in that city. I hope they stay safe out there.",

        "text": "So, this happened almost four years ago. Actually, right around this time four years ago. \n\nMy husband and I had just moved to Quantico from his precious duty station. We had just barely gotten our house, hadn't even gotten our furniture yet. I was 24 weeks pregnant with twins when my water broke and I went into labor late at night. The closest hospital to us was civilian, so that's where we were headed. My husband fully admits that  he was going way over the speed limit down the roads and only did rolling stops at stop signs. Even if the roads were empty, he admitted he panicked and shouldn't have. \n\nWe get pulled over on the final stretch to the hospital. We could actually see it just a couple of blocks down. My husband pulls over, immediately slaps his ID on the dashboard by the window, rolls it down, and waits with his hands on the steering wheel. I'm in the passenger seat writhing. The officer approached the window and asked for the usual things. I fumbled the registration and proof of insurance out of the glove box, handed it to my husband, who gave it to her. \n\nO: \"Sir, do you know why I pulled you over tonight?\" \n\nH: Speeding and making an illegal left at that red light back there. \n\nO: *Pauses and stares*.. Well, actually it's because your left tail light is out, but why don't you tell me why you're in such a rush? \n\nH: *points to me* My wife is twenty-four weeks pregnant with twins and her water just broke. We're on our way to [hospital]. \n\nO: *grabs her flashlight and shines it on me. She sees the towel I'm sitting on, the way I'm hunched over with my hands on the dashboard, and according to my husband I was white as a sheet.*\n\nM: *kind of grimace and say \"Hi\" because I'm sure as hell not moving my hands.*\n\nO: That hospital right there? *points up the road* \n\nH: Yes, ma'am. \n\nShe stopped for a second to think about it, because my husband had just admitted to some pretty serious traffic violations, but after a few seconds she handed him his stuff back. \n\nO: Right. Sir, wait for me to pull ahead of you. I'm going to run my lights and escort you there. \n\nY'all, I could have cried. Sure enough, the officer walks back to her squad car, speaks into the radio, then pulls in front of us and runs her lights. She led the rest of the way to the hospital, led us through the entrance, and I believe waited until I hobbled my ass into the ER before leaving. She might have just been making sure we weren't lying, but I haven't forgotten that. That night was the start of the worst time in our lives, but her act of kindness always stands out when we talk about it. \n\nThank you, officer. ",

        "text": "This happened about a month ago while I was having a rough time with alcohol. \n\nI woke up on the couch to the screams of lois on Malcolm in the middle. It was around midnight and I had been playing a Malcolm drinking game by myself since 8. Got bored and didn't feel like drinking anymore, so I decided to go visit the cemetery. Drove the 5 miles there and parked and got out. Felt like drinking again. Popped the trunk and broke out the bottle. I would like to say I only took a swig in memory but I kinda got carried away.\n\nAfter about an hour I was pretty far gone (as was the fifth from my trunk). With how the weather's been lately, It was probably windy and in the mid 50s. \n\nI'm assuming I got cold outside in my shorts and t-shirt because the next time my eyes opened I was in a hoodie that wasn't mine in the back of my car with my feet resting out the open door. As my eyes slowly adjusted I saw a man standing a couple feet away. I heard myself speaking but it was more like feeling the vibrations in my throat. I couldn't hear the words. Roughly 15 slow seconds passed and as I kept waking up I finally realized I was looking up at a police officer. I was surprised to say the least. I asked him what was up. He said I was passed out in the back seat and had been talking gibberish for the past 5 minutes. He said when he walked up I was shaking so he threw me a hoodie which I somehow managed to get on. He told me he was ready to call an ambulance if I didn't become coherent.\n\nI sat up and got out. He joked with me \"holy shit look how wobbly you are\" and I disagreed. He called me miss wobbles for the rest of our interaction. He asked for a license, and I'm sure he asked some standard questions about anything in the car, would anything come up when I run this, etc. He actually asked how long I had been living in my car and I could only laugh. I told him I didnt and all the crap in there was either for work the next day or to be donated when I had a chance to stop by. \n\nHe asked me to call someone to get me. I was worried because it was 230am by now, but the first person I called picked up on the first ring. I have good friends. He was there shortly, but not before another cop who pulled in and gave me lots of shit too. My friend moved my car to a lot across the street and came back to take me home. \n\nNow, I don't know if I could have gotten a dui. My car wasn't started and the keys were in the back with me. But I'm sure there were at least a few reasons to take me to jail. Public intoxication, tresspassing, open container. Whatever. Point is, a little kindness on someone else's bad night can go a long way. I realized anyone else could have showed up instead of that officer. I put myself in danger and if my drunk self decided to drive somewhere I could have injured or killed someone. Seriously, waking up in a public place scared me. Anything could have happened. I haven't taken a drink since then and I need 2 hands to count the ways it has already helped me improve my life. Thanks officer. ",

        "text": "[This video was posted on PnS]( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CTS4aOJkTV4&amp;feature=youtu.be) recently, and it reminded me that we've all been there.\n\nWhen I was in High School, my girlfriend and I went to a rave. I did shrooms, and she stuck to the (relatively) safer option of weed. The rave was in a mid-sized city, and we lived about two hours away.\n\nWe had a great time, and after all was said and done, she's driving us home, when all of sudden **BOOM**, one of the tires on her Bronco blew. We pull over and turn on our hazards on one of the main thoroughfares. I'm looking in the back for a spare when the flashing lights pull up behind us. \n\n*Fuck*\n\nOut steps a **HUGE** black Police Officer. I was probably 5'10\" or so, and I was eye level with his badge. He comes over to help us, and we all discover that we don't have a spare. I'm standing by the back wearing Jnco Mammoth's, Chuck Taylors, and [a Tool shirt](https://tshirtslayer.com/tshirt-or-longsleeve/tool-medicine-twins-long-sleeve-1994), and I have hair down to my ribs. My girlfriend is wearing MacGear Phat pants, an orange bikini top, and Sketchers.\n\nWe're two hours from home, my girlfriend is stoned, and I'm tripping balls. Our truck is broken down, and the only person that bothered to stop and help us is a cop.\n\n*Great*\n\nOfficer is telling my girlfriend that she has to get the car towed in 12 hours or it'll be impounded. Meanwhile, I'm staring at his badge, and it is *awesome*. It's a silver shield with an eagle above it, and the red &amp; blue flashers are playing off it. I'm totally transfixed by it.\n\n\"Hey, you okay?\"\n\nI *want* to reply, I really do. But his badge looks *sssooo* cool.\n\n\"HEY!\"\n\n\"Yessir!\"\n\n\"You okay?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I'm just trying figure out what the hell, err, heck we're going to do.\"\n\n\"Is there someone you can call to stay with?\"\n\n\"Maybe...\"\n\nThe cop gives me a funny/suspicious look, and My girlfriend calls our \"friend\" (read: drug dealer) who agrees to put us up for the night until my Dad can come fix her Bronco. \n\nAfter searching us and finding nothing (we'd used up our stashes at the rave), The cop offers to give us a lift, as our \"friend\" only lives ten minutes away. We pile into the backseat of his cruiser and he starts driving. After we start rolling, the officer turns on the radio. To the soft rock station. My girlfriend and I are too nervous to relax- we're sure that this is a trick. We're in the back trying to keep cool when Mariah Carey's *Always Be My Baby* comes on. Followed by singing.\n\nFrom the Cop.\n\nDude is singing (really well, I might add) along with the song. With two stoned-as-fuck teens in his backseat. \n\n[I must've looked like this](https://www.memecenter.com/fun/2988905/geoffrey-arend-in-amp-039-super-troopers-) in the backseat as I was rolling balls and being serenaded by this cop's deep baritone. I turned to my girlfriend and mouthed \"What the fuck?\", which she replied with a helpless shrug. I spent the rest of the drive trying not get so paranoid that I'd ruin my trip. \n\nWe arrive to *not jail* and thank the officer profusely. I'm pretty sure he was just fucking with us, because he gave a me a smile &amp; a wink before saying, \"Y'all be safe now\"\n\n**Cue to twenty years later**\n\nI'm now a paramedic (is anyone surprised?), my hair is falling out, and I have big ol' beard. My regular partner called out, and there's a part-timer filling in for him. \n\nShe's a 23 year-old, 5'3\", bee-boping blond. Quite a difference from from my usual cantankerous, misanthropic (not to mention male &amp; bald) partner. I give her my usual speech about how it's *my* bus, but I have the general rule that I let part-timers pick the music, with the caveat that I retain ultimate veto power. She's new and eager, so she agrees quickly and we start our shift. We run a few routine calls, and everything's groovy. Then we get dispatched to a shooting. We're rolling along when *Party In The USA* by Hannah Montana comes on. I give my partner a sidelong glance, and she returns my gaze unashamed.\n\nFirst I roll my eyes and consider changing the song.\n\nThen my toes start tapping. My shoulders start bumping to the beat. Then I start singing along. My partner grins and turns up the radio. We roll down the windows and start jamming through the ghetto, jamming to the whitest song ever. She's drumming her hands on the steering wheel, and I'm grooving in the passenger seat.\n\nI'm singing (poorly, I might add) \"..And a Brittany song is on, *and a Brittany song is on!*\" When I feel the ambulance shudder to a halt. I look up and see a bunch of cops standing over a young black guy sitting on the curb, all of whom have dumbfounded looks on their faces.\n\nI quickly reach over to kill the radio, but the damage was done. \n\nI step out and a Cop I'm friends with walks over with a shit-eating grin on his face.\n\n\"Dude, were you just jamming to Hannah Montana?\"\n\n\"Nah... it was my partner!\"\n\n\"*Sure* it was. So, after I take your man card, you can go deal with this guy. He got shot in his calf during a party. A party that was indeed in the USA\"\n\nI bust up laughing and go to my patient, who is looking at me like I'm growing an eye out of my forehead. Dude's not hurt too bad, we load him up, start care, and start rolling to a hospital. While en route, Whitney Houston's *I Wanna Dance With Somebody* comes on. I'm typing on my computer and my toes start to tap. The patient gives me a funny look, so I hop in the jumpseat behind the patient and turn to my partner.\n\n\"Hey\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Turn it up\"\n\nShe laughs and complies. We're jamming and I lean over the gurney and the patient isn't letting his injury prevent him from dancing on the gurney. I laugh to myself and tell my partner to turn it up more. We arrive at the hospital and the patient is complaining that my partner didn't have any songs from *The Bodyguard* on her phone. \n\nAnother life saved.\n\nEdit: Spelling",

        "text": "Strap in, this is a long post that happened several years ago, I wanted to wait to allow time to pass for this incident. \n\nI was finishing up a report on an auto-theft for a spectacular douche-nozzle for his Maserati. Side note please lock your vehicles at night especially if one of your vehicles has a set of keys for another vehicle. I'm finishing up my report when my radio buzzes. \n\nBadge 455 to dispatch start me EMS, we have a really bad accident multiple injuries. Start me units!\n\nI look back at my report and continue typing, we have accidents every day with injuries since we have a major interstate running through my district so I hear code 2, accident with injury all the time and assume it's not that serious. \n\nBadge 455 screaming on the radio: start me FIRE, I need more units here now!\n\nRarely does an officer start screaming on the radio, for more units unless its our worst call, I key up and tell dispatch make my last a report to follow (RTF) and start me that way. \n\nI get into my vehicle, punch the lights on, and start my sirens, I'm about 15 minutes away with traffic in my way and I need to be there in 5 minutes. I start flying down the road and one of my favorite songs is playing on the radio, Beastie Boys \"Sabotage\". \n\nI arrive on scene and I see chaos, pure chaos. I key up on my radio, \"Unit 311, start me additional units, we are going to need shut down this intersection. Unit 311 to rank, my newly promoted sergeant key's up and says go to our talk channel, the media can't listen on that channel. I tell my sergeant negative I need to give him a call via a cell phone, mainly since the rest of the department on my channel will go over to the channel for our conversion. The newly promoted sergeant overrides me, he wants to do it the \"department\" way. \n\nI key up on our separate channel, sarge it's better I give you a call, he says his phones broken. I stop fighting with my rank, and say Sarge I got multiple fatalities, at least two confirmed dead. I don't know specifics yet but I need at least three more units to block traffic, sir your are going to need to notify traffic. Sarge says okay, I'm on the way, fatality will be notified. \n\nI have a tow trunk that has gone through a bus stop filled with pedestrians into a parking lot with vehicles. The tow truck pushed a brand new Ford-150 pick-up out of a parking spot to 20 feet from initial impact into four other vehicles blowing out all the tires and causing the vehicle to be riding on its rims. \n\nI have four EMS units and two EMS sprints units with at least three fire engines on scenes. I ask the EMS LT, \"What do you need?\" She responds with, \"Close off traffic, and push back the pedestrians on scene. Also there are skull fragments by your right foot.\" \n\nI go over to the pedestrians, at least thirty people gawking at death with cell phone camera's out. I look over and start giving commands to back up, but one guys says I'm allowed to video tape you officer! I look at him, and say, \"I'm wearing a body camera, so you are being recorded, and you are on my scene so back it up.\" The guy looks at me and says,\"This is why people hate the police!\" I look at him for a second and shake my head. He walks away but continues shouting that the police are terrible people. \n\nA second officer shows on scene Officer Holmes, he's a true veteran, twenty plus years on the job and has done everything from patrol, detective, to a specialized unit. He looks at me and says, \"First fatality? I reply, \"Yeah,\" he says, \"Well wheres the driver?\" \n\nWe look over together and see the fire department pulling him out of the tow truck while the vehicle was still in neutral with the engine red-lining. We look at each other and think the same thing, drunk driver, fucking drunk drivers. He looks at me and says I'll follow him up to the hospital.\n\nEMS takes the driver up to the hospital with Officer Holmes in tow. My sergeant arrives on scene with a few other officers and we start closing off the street and pushing vehicles and people back so our fatality unit can handle the scene for their report. \n\nFatality units starts arriving on scene and removing our officers off for everyone but me, as I the first officer on scene. I write my initial report for fatality and they begin calling for other tow trucks to remove the several vehicles struck by the original tow truck. At least six vehicles were struck by the tow truck. \n\nSeveral hours go by as they remove the first body from the scene and a second body under the tow truck as it was lifted by a crane, blood was pooling everywhere. \n\nOfficer Holmes calls me and tells me the driver behind the tow truck was not drunk, he came back negative for all tests with alcohol and drugs. I inform fatality and leave the scene with a lot personal belongings that take me two hours to place onto the books as property for several people. a few deceased. A strange calm came over me as I wrote down the last memories of these strangers and their personal belongings. \n\nA few weeks later on another fatality, I talk to the LT in charge and he tells me that tow truck driver had a seizure and lost control of his vehicle and slammed into a bus stop killing two people on impact. A third person died in en-route to the hospital in an EMS unit. A couple was transported as well, the wife died before surgery and was wheeled into her husband's room, right before his surgery and was told his wife was dead and he could say goodbye before he was wheeled into surgery. One of the strangest things I have ever heard a hospital staff ever do. The man survived but lost two limbs.  ",

        "text": "I was on a city street, heading towards a freeway to patrol. An ambulance with it's lights and sirens on was driving towards me on the other side of the road. Even though I was driving a cop car, I was still required to yield, so I pulled to the right curb and waited for the ambulance to pass. As I did this, a sedan passed me in the lane I had been in, completely ignoring the ambulance. This is every Troopers dream stop as we can't pull these people over when they're blocking us on our way to a call. \n\nI had a pretty good idea of how this would play out. I jumped in behind the sedan and turned my lights on. No reaction from the driver. I hit my sirens a couple times. Nothing. We were approaching an intersection, and I gave them the benefit of the doubt that they wanted to pass the intersection before stopping. We passed the intersection...and kept going. Full lights and sirens, code 3, emergency response, you can't ignore me. No reaction. \n\n\"Unit 2 to Dispatch, failure to yield.\"\n\n\"Unit 2, I copy failure to yield, go ahead.\"\n\n\"We're south on Main Street, approaching 2nd Street, 30mph. Original want was failure to yield. Suspect is a black sedan. Light traffic.\"\n\nDispatch echoed it all back, and two other units went en route to assist me.\n\nI kept giving updates, \"Still south on Main Street, passing 3rd Street, still 30mph...we're stopped at a red light now. Oh, driver is signalling left onto 3rd Street. Now on 3rd Street. Vehicle is signaling right, pulling over at a bus stop. Nevermind, 15mph, on 3rd Street.\"\n\nLuckily for me, one of the newer guys had a similar experience years ago that I was on scene for.\n\n\"Unit 2, I copy all. Local PD has units en route.\" I didn't think I needed them, but I didn't know, so I let them continue. Then, by all policy and protocol guidelines, I made a stupid decision. But by common sense and rational thinking, I made the right decision.\n\nI turned my siren off, pulled alongside the other vehicle, and rolled down my window. They stopped. I stopped. I yelled, \"Pull over!\" They yelled back, \"Sorry, no english!\" My gamble was correct. \n\nI replied, \"Okay, turn right, stop.\" \n\n\"Turn right, stop?\"\n\n\"Yes, turn right, stop.\"\n\n\"Okay, okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, no English.\" They turned right and stopped.\n\n\"Unit 2, we're stopped at 3rd Street and Oak Street, just a language barrier. All other units can cancel.\"\n\nA couple minutes later, a local PD guy stopped. \"Were you the one in pursuit?\" I laughed. \"Is that how they put it out on the radio? Just a language barrier.\"\n\nPD guy asked, \"What'd you originally try to stop them for?\" I told him about the ambulance.\n\nHe put out his hand to shake. \"That's awesome, man.  I always want to write these people when I'm going to a call and I never get to.\"\n\nA couple minutes later, after giving the driver a ticket, I went back to my office and ordered a mandatory driver's license reevaluation.",

        "text": "What follows is the retelling of the first fatality accident I responded to.\n\nIt's early morning in my sector. A call for an accident comes out in the sector next to mine, but since it was on an interstate roadway, I was dispatched as well. Caller states a dump truck had tipped over and was blocking all lanes of the interstate. The driver had been ejected.\n\nI arrived first and discovered several semi trucks had helped us out by using their rigs to block traffic. I make my way to the dump truck, which was on it's side. I notice a small group of people near the cab.\n\nAs I approach, i see one of our dispatchers kneeling on the ground. Then I notice she is holding a head. The head was still attached to the body and he was taking very very shallow breaths. I notify dispatch of the situation and start setting up the scene, since I don't have anything strong enough to lift a dump truck.\n\nI hear a shout and run back to the cab. The driver had stopped breathing but we couldn't perform CPR because he was pinned from his shoulders down by the cab of the dump truck.\n\nTragically, the driver passed away. He suffocated due to the weight of the dump truck. And there wasn't anything we could do to help him. \n\nThe Highway Patrol handled the accident. It was discovered that he had not been wearing a seatbelt. Had he been, he would have walked away from the accident. The driver was in his early 20s.\n\nWear your seatbelt. \n\nIn reference to this above story, about 6 months later I was patrolling in my area when a car hydroplanned, caught some air, and wrecked into the median right in front of me. The vehicle was registered to the driver mentioned above. The driver was his father. He had came from a nearby bar. That was the only intoxicated driver I have ever \"let go\". The vehicle was totaled. \n\nDo not drink and drive.\n",

        "text": "Preface this by stating this story is a couple of months old. Road names have been changed for privacy.\n\nI work midnights for a County Police Department. I've been on for a little over 2 years and have been on midnights pretty much the entire time.\n\nOn this night, I was on my way back from taking someone to jail. I had called my wife since I hadn't been able to see her that day due to our schedules. The road is dark but well-travelled, but it is just inside a local municipality. \n\nI come around a corner  and approach a four way intersection. As I approach the intersection, I  notice a vehicle with hazard lights activated, facing the intersection on the road perpendicular to the road I am on. I tell my wife I've got to go, knowing I just discovered a traffic accident. \n\nI kick on the emergency lights, notify dispacth, and start to park near the vehicle when I realize there is another vehicle in the middle of the road across from me.\n\nI check on the closest car and the driver is fine, no injuries, but air bags have deployes.\n\nI start making my way to the second vehicle when a medical professional from the local hospital stops to help. We walk up to the vehicle but we cannot see anybody inside. I check the door handle, and it is locked. \n\nThis usually means whoever had been driving was intoxicated and fled before I discovered the accident.\n\nThis vehicle also has airbag deployment. To me it seemed like it was a near head on collision. \n\nAs I made my way to the passenger side, I got a lead weight in my chest. I noticed there was something in the front passenger floorboard. All I could see was the seat of someone's pants. I had found the missing driver. He had not been wearing a seatbelt and had been launched into the floorboard of the passenger seat. \n\nFor reference, try to squeeze yourself, your entire self, into the floorboard of the passenger seat of your car.\n\nThe driver was not responding. This accident just kicked into high gear. I grab my expandable baton and attempt to break the driver side window to prevent glass from raining down on the driver.\n\nNo luck. They teach you where to hit bit sometimes it just won't go.\n\nI run over to the passenger side. One swing from the baton later, the window turns to dust.\n\nI open the door. The hospital worker holds the driver's neck and I grab the shoulders of his shirt and drag him out.  \n\nWe may him flat on his back and then the skies overhead erupt with the most rain I have ever had the misfortune of being caught out in. There was no space between the rain drops. \n\nAs we later him flat, he stopped breathing. I started conducting CPR with the assistance of the medical professional. I trade off as the local municipality units start to arrive because I know they all carry defibrillators. I tell the responding officer what we have and he grabs his equipment.\n\nWhile he is setting it up, we had been trading off CPR rotations. As the officer turns on the AED, the driver starts breathing on his own again. Coincidently, the ambulance arrives at this time too.\n\nThe driver was whisked to the nearby hospital. I gave the responding officer all the details he would need for his report and went back to my sector, soaked to the bone but with the knowledge that a life had been saved.\n\nI never found out what the extent of the injuries the driver suffered, though I believe he had a broken neck   at the very least. I do know he survived his injuries.\n\nHad I not discovered the accident when I had, I strongly believe the driver would have died prior to the arrival of EMS. The other driver and the good samaritan didn't have a way to get to the driver. They hadn't even notified emergency services yet.\n\nThe feeling of saving a life is unexplainable. It isn't something they tell you about in the Academy and there are some officers who never experience it. I'm just glad I was able to be in the right place at the right time when it mattered most.\n\n",

        "text": "My mother told me this story last night about a suspect she just arraigned in court and the accidental witnesses they had in the case:\n\nApparently some officers from my local PD had been tracking some heroin dealers throughout the town. Now my city (T) is a big center for heroin in my state. So there were ALWAYS dealers being arrested and taken in.\n\nWell the TPD had gotten a tip that the dealer they were looking for had rented a room out in a local motel and seemed to be bunkered down for the night. So about three squad cars show up to the motel and ask the front desk which room. They were told X. Well as they are going down the halls they begin to hear what they think is some yelling coming from the direction of X. They approach the door and knock. \n\n\"Who is it?\" A seemingly feminine/high pitched voice calls from the other room.\n\n\"Police, open up!\"\n\nThere is some shuffling and the door does not open so the police proceed to announce themselves again. Silence and this time they hear more voices so they proceed to kick down the door.\n\nNow at this point you probably think the drug dealer has a lover or a woman of the night with him, but you would be wrong. Laying on the bed is instead two men (completely nude) and a dog. The two men SCREAM as the police barge in. They tell them to get down on the ground so Man 1 (M1) does so, still nude. Man 2 (M2) is screaming about them having the wrong room. At one point he says \"It's because we're gay, isn't it? We're gay and white and you don't like it!\" Now my state actually legalized gay marriage before the rest of the country so this probably wasn't the case. During all of this the dog is barking and freaking out/jumping all over the bed. The dog was small enough that the officers paid it no mind.\n\nMeanwhile the main arresting officer is so startled at what is happening he steps outside and proceeds to laugh so hard he almost vomits. As he is dry heaving/laughing, the dog walks and sits RIGHT below him. He almost passed out from lack of oxygen (his own words).\n\nThe drug dealer, meanwhile? High off his own product next door so he wasn't even processing what was going on. They arrested him once they realized they were actually in the wrong room. So as they are arresting a man high out of his mind, there are two gay men and their dog being released about ten feet away. The men ended up being called as witnesses to the arrest/the state of the drug dealer during the arrest.\n\nNeedless to say those two men now have a wonderful story to tell.\n\nEdit: Cause I apparently can't spell nor is \"heroine\" a drug.\n",

        "text": "Just gonna preface this with a quick explanation. The proper terminology is \"Explorer\" not \"Cadet\", but I am putting \"Cadet\" since it is more widely understood. Explorers are sort of similar. You'll see below. Skip the next paragraph if you are familiar with Explorers.\n\nI am the Captain of the Explorer Post for a department in a nearby city to me. An Explorer is a Police \"volunteer\" in a way. We carry no sworn powers, and are not on the payroll. The Explorer Program is for individuals age 14-21 who are interested in Law Enforcement. We go on ride alongs, attend a week long summer academy staffed with Marine drill instructors, work events, and attend meetings where we do scenarios and learn about all things Law Enforcement. I've been in the program for about 3 years, with a bit over 1,000 volunteer hours. The department I am associated with structures the Post as a paramilitary organization, and issues a full uniform. Patches, body armor, duty belt (with handcuffs and flashlight), the works. Explorers do not carry lethal/nonlethals. However, our body armor lets us accompany officers to pretty much any call, based on their discretion. I've seen and learned a LOT. You can't really learn Law Enforcement in a classroom. It's all about field experience.\n\nI am resigning this month to head off to college.\n\nAnyway\n\nI was coming home from a BBQ at my old Captain's house. It was pretty late at night, almost 1 in the morning. The road I was on was a two lane winding road through a canyon. I came to the section where it opened up to a wider road and the speed increased a bit. I live by an affluent area so people take their nice cars and regularly do 70 mph in the 45 zone that part of the road is in, especially at night when the roads are pretty empty. I come up to an intersection to make a right turn down an extremely winding road: a shortcut through the surrounding hills. \n\nAs I come up on the turn, I do a double take. There is a vehicle sitting on the wrong side of the road in the intersection. At first I thought I was in the wrong somehow, but quickly realized that no, the vehicle was in fact stopped on the opposite side of the road, waiting for a red light to change that never would since there is no sensor on that side.\n\nAs I pass the vehicle to go around it, I get a quick glimpse of a lone woman at the wheel, and no passengers. She is just sitting there. I drive around her and pull off 50 feet away at the entrance of a service road. I took video of some of the beginning. I have some freeze frames captured, though. [Here is my view from my window. The vehicle is just sitting there](https://i.imgur.com/kolalb9.jpg). \n\nI sat there for a few seconds. Something just didn't seem right. It was all too weird.\n\nI started recording on my phone in case things went south, grabbed the flashlight from my glovebox, and approached the vehicle.\n\nAs I got close, I got a better look. [The engine was on, and so was the radio, but the woman was sitting in her seat with her eyes closed, still as a statue.](https://i.imgur.com/VL0kkCq.jpg) I tried to rouse her with \"Ma'am!\", getting progressively louder and louder until I was yelling. She looked dead, before I looked close enough to see her chest move. Finally, just as I was about to open the door, she snapped awake. Seemingly half coherent.\n\nNow, I pretty much realized at this point she was probably intoxicated or under the influence of some substance. No visible injuries, and she was verbal when she woke up. Thats when the scenario training kicked in. I made sure to use strong command presence. I started giving instructions, getting her vehicle turned off, and getting her out and sitting on the curb. I then called 911, gave them the info, and mentioned my association to the nearby department. I took the keys out of the ignition, as she was unable to get them out herself. I also got an eta for the responding unit: 10 minutes.\n\nI've talked to Officers about something called \"The Gift of the Gab\". Some people have it, some don't. Basically, it means the ability to keep someone talking for an extended period of time for whatever reason. To keep them calm, distracted, etc. I was able to practice this on ride alongs for non-serious calls. I needed to keep her talking, because every time there was a lull of any sort, she protested that she needed to leave to go pick up her 6 year old daughter in a different city about 30 minutes away, and was getting squirrely. Though she was going nowhere without her keys, I'd rather keep things calm.\n\nSo, I kept her talking. We talked about where she was coming from. A wedding. I asked how much she had to drink, and was met with denial. I pressed a bit more, and finally got that she had had some champagne. I talked to her about that wedding. How the turnout was, what she thought of the groom. Was it a nice venue?\n\nWe talked about her job. She worked in an office building in my city. We talked about the tropical vacation I just got back from, and how cold a nearby city was in the morning. We talked about good restaurants by her office. We talked about a car that revved its engine and tore past us at amazing speed, and how it was very unsafe to drive that way, especially here.\n\nAll the while I was checking over my shoulder for the unit. A few cars passed, one Uber driver honking at us as he came in to make the same turn I had.\n\nFinally, bright lights rounded the corner and approached slowly. \n\n\"Is that them?\" she asked\n\n\"I think so\"\n\nIt was the unit. \n\nI knew what was going to happen next. It was a double unit, and two officers stepped out. I stepped back, and let them do the rest. One Officer took her ID to run her information, and the other conducted an FI (field interview) on me. I went over what happened until he had filled his FI card. He finished writing, then put away his pen.\n\n\"Can I stay for the FST?\" (field sobriety test)\n\n\"Sure, just chill by your car\"\n\nI watched and waited. I saw her silhouette go through the motions of attempting to walk a straight line, raise one foot, etc. Through the almost darkness I heard the beeping of the breathalyzer. Then, soon after, the clicking of handcuffs. She was placed in the back of the car, and both Officers approached.\n\nThey told me she blew a .136. I told them my theory:\n\nWhen the woman exited the dense trees of the winding canyon road (somehow she managed to drive it), she got confused as the double yellow line curved, and crossed over to the opposite side of the road. She then came to the intersection, with the red light. Her car was not activating the sensor, due to her being on the other side of the road, so she started waiting on the indefinite red light. She waited until she fell asleep, with her foot on the brake. \n\nIf she shifted in her sleep, and her foot slipped off the brake, she would have rolled into the middle intersection with people going near freeway speed. She may have never woken up. \n\nI don't know how long she was sitting there, but I estimate 10 minutes or so.\n\nI wished the deputies a safe rest of their shift, and a good night.\n\n\nThough I realize this is not the most exciting or action packed story, I really do have to thank my training and experience for allowing me to remain calm, keep a level head, and know exactly what to do. The only shivers I got were from the cool night breeze, me being in only shorts and a tank top. \n\nI guess the reason this sticks out to me is because I have always been an observer as an Explorer. Sure I get physically up close and personal with the call but it is the Officer who is always the anchor in the situation. This time? It was me, myself, and I in the middle of the night on a dark road. \n\nI told my family and friends what happened, and was called a hero by some. Not sure how I feel about that, but what I do know is I am glad I chose to stop and am glad things went as well as they did.\n\nTalk about a feeling of reaffirmation for my career choice.\n\nStay safe out there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I will still need to see Lic, Reg, and Ins.  \nM: Lic is in my wallet in my back pocket, reg and ins are in the glove box. Do you mind me reaching for them?  \n-Give him the requested documentation-   \nO2 comes up on the passenger side shining a flashlight all through my car.  \nO2: -taps on glass with flashlight- can you roll the window down please.  \nW: *in a snarky tone* Can I help you officer?  \nO2: Ma'am we are going to need to see your ID.  \nW: If you must *give O2 her ID*  \n-- 10 minutes pass --  \nO1: Sorry about the delay, and for taking so long I've decided to not ticket you for the headlight.  \n\nStart driving on. About a half mile up, pulled over again by Officer 3 (O3).  \nO3: Do you know why I pulled you over?  \nM: For my headlight being out? As I just told the last officer, I am going to fix it in the morning.  \nO3: So you were just pulled over?  \nM: Yes.  \nO3: Do you mind if I run your lic.  \nM: Go ahead, I have it right here.  \n-O3 comes back about a minute later-  \nO3: Sorry about the mix up, please have a nice night.  \n\nContinue driving. A block before I get to my apartment, you guessed it I get pulled over. Again.    At this point I am stressed, tired, and hungry. Office 4 (O4) comes up shining a light through my car.  \n(O4) Do you know why I pulled you over?  \nM: *snarky tone* Probably for the same reason, the last two officers pulled me over.\nO4: I am sorry did you say you've been pulled over already?  \nM: Yes. Twice, in the last hour. Since I pulled onto this road. [note the road is about 2 miles long - shouldn't take a hour to get down]  \nO4: I am really sorry for the inconvenience, we are looking for someone with the similar vehicle.  \nM: I understand that, this is getting ridiculous. I live in the apartments at the top of the hill, I've been on this road for over an hour and still haven't made it home.  \nO4: Again I am sorry for issues.  We have a man hunt for someone driving a similar vehicle.  Please drive safely, and try to have a good night.  \nFinally made it home.  Made certain to get the headlight fixed.  \n**TL:DR Got pulled over 3 times in less than 2 miles because of a \"headlight being out\", turned out to be a manhunt for someone with similar vehicle.**  \n*EDIT: Formatting (for the hundredth time and added TL;DR)",

It happened some 7 years ago when I lived in a smaller flat in a rundown part of town. My neighbor below me had gotten home from a night out, and figured the house needed his Hard Bass music as a morning alarm, and it worked atleast for me. I had just had a shower, had my coffee brewing, when it knocked on my door. I opened the door and the blackest black dude ever, asked politely if I were Jacob. Aye what more though? Nothamselv. Oh no thats below here, no worries mate, the confusion is normal. Aight alright thanks mate.\n10 minuttes later there was knocking on my door again and this time, it was my dearest neighbor Jacobnothamselv standing there covered in blood from an open wound on his temple. He blurted out a faint \"help\" and i grapped him, got him on my bed with my wet towel (from shower!) to his head. I told him that i would call an ambulance and if he wanted some police with that, which he did. So the situation was that this morning I would enjoy my morning cup of coffee, to the sight of one bloodied neighbor, 2 cops and 4 paramedics in my little home.\nIt turned out that the black dude had come for some money for my neighbors partyfuel, and since he wasnt allowed entry, he had whacked my neighbors temple with a hammer, and then cleared the flat of valuables.\nThus began an ordinary saturday rather extraordinarily.",

        "text": "First traffic stop, I'm 19. November, and like maybe six or seven at night. No drugs/alcohol/any of that noise.\n\n\nI used to speed horrendously (like 25 mph or more over the limit) so I kinda figured I'd be pulled over eventually. It's late, I'm listening to music (Dead Girl Walking from Heathers, ironically), going to pick up a friend who needs a ride home. I go through a four way stop, keep going, see them pull out behind me. I don't actually know why though because I actually wasn't speeding, so what did I do? That confusion was enough to make me a really awkward person for the entire stop. \n\nI slow down but not a ton, because I didn't think I did anything wrong. So does the car in front of me. We are both confused. We get like halfway down the road, like a half-mile before the lights come on. Then the over-thinking really starts because I have to find a place to pull over.  How much time do you have to pull over? I dunno. Maybe like another half-mile with the lights on and I pull off into a side street, and so does the car in front of me. I stop but I didn't put the car in park because I'm trying to figure out what the other car is doing. I'm not moving around or anything, I'm literally just watching the other car, only my car is in drive still. And then very very bright lights are turned on and fucking blind me and I realize, *ah yes, this is for me, I should probably turn off my car.* So I do. And by this point I feel like a giant awkward mess.\n\nThe officer comes up to me right as I've just blinded myself by staring directly into my rear-view mirror for a half-second, so my eyes are watering, I'm blinking, I'm super nervous and I legitimately didn't hear her walk up, so I nearly jumped out of my skin when she started talking to me. \n\nHer: You didn't stop at that stop sign.\n\nMe: (Internally) I mean I stopped, I guess I just didn't stop as well as you wanted me to? I mean could you even see me from where you must have been? Plus it's dark and--\n\nMe: (Externally) Okay. /reeeeeaaaaally long awkward pause/\n\nHer: License, registration, proof of insurance.\n\nMe: /handing over license and insurance, awkward pause/\n\nHer: Registration?\n\nMe: /blinding myself by looking directly into the lights yet again, trying to make a joke/ Neither of those are registration?\n\nHer: No.\n\nMe: Okay. Um. /roots around in glove box for a little bit, hand what I think might be registration/ Is this it?\n\nHer: Yes.\n\nMe: Oh good. /more awkward silence/\n\nShe tells me to hang tight. I cycle through everything I did 'wrong' according to every person that's ever told me what to do during a traffic stop (didn't put car in park immediately, didn't turn on interior lights, hands in my lap, didn't tell the officer what I was doing before doing it, didn't know what my own information looked like, yada yada yada). She comes back, gives me a warning, tells me to pay attention, let's me go. \n\n\nI still cringe to this day. I know it's not that bad, but it felt like forever, and I felt like a moron the entire time. Thank you, whoever you were, for taking pity on my dumb ass and not thinking the worst of me. At least I know what my registration looks like now.\n\nEdit: Formatting\n\n",

        "text": "Fair warning that this is not a happy story. This was early in my career.\n\nMy partner Johnson and I were on patrol in a neighboring area because they were short on Troopers. When something like that happens, you only respond to calls and forego any sort of proactive policing. We hit a couple tourist spots for some selfies and mostly did paperwork.\n\nAs we neared the end of shift, we lined up near our area and switched back to our radio. As we did that, we learned 4 out of 5 of our units were in a pursuit out of area, and the 1 remaining unit was headed to a crash with injuries. There was another rollover crash pending.\n\n\"Unit 2, back on our home radio, we'll be en route to check on the rollover.\" We weren't supposed to be there, but thought we'd be nice and help out.\n\nI was driving, and it was near midnight, so I was moving pretty quickly. We were a good 10 miles from our rollover crash when dispatch advised, \"Unit 2, we're getting calls of a body...correction, possibly two bodies in the roadway eastbound at 1st Street.\" Okay, sure, I'll clear that carpet when I can. Most calls for this are just random debris, especially at night.\n\nWe were roughly five seconds from that position. \"Unit 2 copies.\"  As we neared that location, I saw a car on the shoulder with their hazards on. I saw someone else nearby, waving. I commented to Johnson, \"It looks like they're trying to wave us down.\" I slowed down as we approached.\n\nIronically, Johnson and I had a conversation about our dash camera and cursing earlier. You get in trouble for cursing on camera. Johnson noted how he cursed like a sailor, and I commented how I was always professional. \n\nAs we approached, I spotted something in the road and hit the brakes hard. \"SHIT!!\" Johnson said. \"OH FUCK!\" I let out. So much for professionalism. We spotted what appeared to be a body in the roadway.\n\nDecision time. Stop hard and risk getting hit by 80mph traffic, or circle back around to gradually slow traffic. It was too late; we circled back. I updated dispatch, \"Unit 2, confirmed visual of body in the roadway eastbound at 1st.\"\n\nDispatch echoed. \"Unit 2, I copy...will you be diverting?\" I got really annoyed at this question. Continue to a possible rollover crash, or instead go to a human lying on a freeway that we just saw with our own eyes?!\n\nVery calmly, I replied, \"We'll be diverting.\"\n\nWe circled back, and the sole unit who wasn't in pursuit heard everything and went our way to help. We arrived on scene as the other unit stopped traffic.\n\nJohnson and I exited our car while the other unit stopped the freeway. We walked up to the body, that was more a bag of jumbled bones than a human.\n\nI told Johnson, \"That's definitely...\" and I was going  to finish with \"dead.\" And then it let out an *agonizing* groan. That's a sound that will stay with me forever. So what I said was, \"That's definitely...NOT DEAD!\" Johnson yelled out, \"Grab the bag!\" I sprinted back to our car to grab our medical bag.\n\nAs I ran back up, Johnson looked at me, \"What do we even do?!\"\n\nI'm a first responder, I'm not an ER surgeon. As I looked at this poor soul, a saw a leg completely severed, internal organs that had become external, and a complete loss of where to begin. The pool of blood under the body was nearly enough to swim in. It felt like eternity as I assessed the situation, and it was probably 2 seconds. Right on cue, medical personnel arrived.\n\nThey loaded what was left into the ambulance. I watched as they performed CPR in the ambulance bed. His leg was later recovered 200 feet from his body. I know because I did the measurements for the scene. That area was known for drunks, so we assumed someone who had too much wandered into the freeway.\n\nJohnson ended up spending almost a year in the hit and run investigation, which returned no results. The only aspect worthy of note was that the victim was autistic, and known to wander from home. He wasn't drunk; completely innocent.\n\nI had a lot of bad night's after that. What if I didn't overshoot? What if I put a tournoquet on right away? What if I grabbed the medical bag immediately? What if what if what if?\n\nOdds are nothing I could've done would've changed the outcome, but sometimes emotions overcome logic. I'm lucky in that time had diminished my memory of that night. Too many people I've worked with have not been so lucky.",

        "text": "Hey, all. Found this sub recently, and it's brought me a good deal of amusement. So, I thought I'd pay it forward by telling the story of my least fun police encounter.\n\nI was a few years out of college. I had a good job, a nice house and a girlfriend with whom I was madly in love. Things get pretty serious, and we decide to move in together. So, her house goes up for sale (this is apparently important later).\n\nBeing in New England, inclement weather is common. This was the uncommon kind. Inches of ice, road crews working their asses off, widespread blackouts, and so on for days. Having not fully moved her stuff in yet, my girlfriend decides she needed fresh clothes. I don't blame her- we've been stuck in my place with no power for a couple days. The roads didn't look too bad, so we hop in my truck and head to her place. Lo and behold, it has power! We shower, make ourselves a nice dinner, have a bottle of wine and enjoy a magical evening.\n\nBest night of sleep I've ever had, right up until the point where I regained consciousness. I hear something in the bedroom and kind of roll over. There it is again! I open my eyes with great effort and not a little frustration only to notice that there are three policemen in the bedroom, they all have long guns pointed directly at my face and that damnable noise was a large, gruff man shouting \n\n\"LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS! HANDS NOW!!\"\n\nI have **never** gone from sound asleep to fully alert so quickly in my entire life. I throw up my hands, which disturbed my girlfriend, who prior to this had been concealed under the comforter. She fidgets, and all the cops get even more jumpy.\n\n\"GET OUT OF THE BED ASSHOLE!!\"\n\nI *very* slowly and deliberately attempt to extricate myself from a far too soft bed without the use of my hands, and politely ask the officer closest to me if I may please put on some underwear. No dice on that. \n\n\"SHOW US YOUR ID!!\"\n\nJerking my head towards my pants crumpled on the floor. I politely (read:scared shitless timidly) ask if they'd like me to retrieve it. \n\nDuring the harshly worded statement indicating that would not be a smart move, girlfriend wakes up, and she isn't pleased. She bolts upright in the bed, takes in the situation and starts shouting at the officers, all of whom still have their weapons trained on me, and are becoming more agitated by the moment. She flies out of the bed, a 100lb ball of blonde hair and unadulterated rage, motherfuckering these cops as I'm standing there naked as the day I was born with a couple shotguns in my face and my hands over my head, praying to God that she doesn't get me shot. I get hauled down the stairs, still nude, still terrified, to the kitchen where there are *more* angry, armed men who want questions answered, and they wanted them answered *yesterday*.\n\nNow cuffed, but still nude, though thankfully slightly less fearful for my life, I attempt to stammer out an explanation of the situation, loud profanities in several voices coming from upstairs all the while. They're not buying my story, and told me such. As they're getting ready to drag me to a cruiser for further unpleasantness, one of the officers comes down the stairs followed by a **very** angry woman who managed to wrap herself in a towel. Somewhat sheepishly he says \"So, it's her house. This address is on her license.\"\n\nThe demeanor in the room abruptly changed. They explained they got a call from the realtor (what realtor is out checking on properties at 05:00 on a weekend, let alone during an ice storm, I will never know. I suspect a certain mother who lived nearby and hated my guts for not allowing her daughter to marry rich like she did.) saying there was a suspicious vehicle at the house and people inside.\n\nBefore I had time to even get mad, everyone was gone without so much as a \"Sorry.\" I wasn't even able to get the door they smashed fixed until Monday.\n\nBut hey, I'm alive, and I can definitely laugh about it now!\n\nHope you enjoyed reading!",

        "text": "So this was back when I was in University. I had traveled with some fraternity friends to the city north of us for an annual summer solstice party another chapter in our frat held each year. Party was a blast, we stayed around the next day to help clean up and left after dinner to head back, about a 3 hour drive. Everyone else was in cars and I was on my street legal 2 stroke tripple race bike.\n\nI was cruising along at about 130 km an hour with a speed limit of 110. Highway was pretty much empty. It is pretty flat with not many places for a speed trap. RCMP do you planes to pace cars using lines painted on the highway and a stop watch I guess but I had never seen them actually do that or even heard of anyone that had been caught that way. I think it was more of a deterant than anything. Maybe used for training new pilots.\n\nThe RCMP at the time had an issue with fast cars and bikes simply out running them. I had seen on the news that the RCMP were trialing using sports cars seized from criminals to use as interceptors but that was in the province next door.\n\nSo I am off in my own world down this boring dead straight and flat highway listening to some music in my helmet when I noticed a sweet ass Ferrari in my rear view. He is say 8 to 10 car lengths back and doing about the same speed as me. I move out of the fast lane to let him through but he stays where he is at for a little while longer. Next time I look he is within a few car lengths where he stays for a while.\n\nI should add at this point that I was heading due south and the sun was pretty much in my face so I had my dark visor down as well as my mid low to mid dark one as well. Sun was pretty bright.\n\nAnyways after a few minutes he pulls up next to me and gesturing with his right hand in what I interpreted as \"lets race mother fu*%#r\". Only too happy to oblige I dropped 2 gears down into 4th which put me right at the bottom of my power band. He is still pointing and gesturing at me so I give him the thumbs up telling him we are good to go. He points forward at a rapidly approaching bridge which seemed like as good a place as any as a start point. Just as we got close a start slipping the clutch, maintaining speed but RPM is near top of my power band. At the bridge I slip in the clutch slowly and throttle to max keeping RPM in the range for most power. I raced that bike so had done this a thousand times on the track. Little six inch high wheely and I am away.\n\nI finish 4th and shift into fifth then sixth and hit my top speed really damn fast. Quick glance in the mirror and he is two car lengths behind me in my lane. This is not right. He has a much higher top end than I do so should have destroyed me. I begin to slow and once back down to sane speed turn on the bike to look behind. And that is when I see the flashing lights. Fuckity fuck fuck.\n\nI pull over and he is right behind me. Turn the bike off and put it on its stand. I notice the bike has that two stroke oil smell, which is almost sweet, but usually means the bike is running to lean. Lost in frivolous thought about having to tune the stupid thing again I missed what the RCMP Officer said to me.\n\nI asked him to repeat himself, which I could see only added to his not so good mood. \n\nHe basically asked why I had not pulled over, could I not see his lights and here his siren and I explained the only lights I could see was when I slowed down and physically turned to look back and that I pulled over immediately.  He then asked why I did not obey his hand signals to which I replied, \"I thought you were asking me to race and was pointing at the overpass as the starting point\". The man looked just dumbfounded at me.\n\nTurns put the set of flashing lights on the inside in is window were not working. The ones mounted inside the intakes/bumper were but were below the line of sight I could see in my mirrors when he was within a few car lengths. The siren with the wind, bike noise and music I could not hear. As the car had no side lights and the way the bottom lights were mounted you could not see any flashing lights with the sun in your face when he was beside me.\n\nSo he concluded I was not trying to outrun him and was just an idiot on a bike. He wrote me up for 20km/h under where I would get an automatic license suspension even though we had been going well over 200km/h. I also got a noise violation (don't remember the exact infraction name) because I was running my track exhaust system which were single wall aluminium cans which are loud as hell. It could have been much worse that is for sure but he did not let me off lightly.\n\nAfter the tickets I cheekily asked if I could check out his ride which he was happy to do. We were not buddies or anything like that but a motor head is a motor head. During this time he explained they were trialing out different type of seized cars as interceptors.\n\nI am not sure if the RCMP ended up keeping confiscated cars as interceptors. Not been pulled over by one since.\n\ntl;dr. I raced the law on a very fast bike and the law won.  ",

        "text": "I was in moderate traffic, when I watched a car a few cars ahead of me make a lane change from the #4 lane, straight across the #3 lane, and into the #2 lane, no turn signal. That's a textbook unsafe lane change. I watched a little longer as they made a lane change from the #2 to the #1, the #1 back to the #2, and then proceeded to tailgate the car in front of them. I pulled them over.\n\n\n\"Good afternoon, the reason I stopped you is because of your general poor driving, including multiple unsafe lane changes and tailgating. Are you in some sort of hurry to get somewhere?\"\n\n\nThis guy was a nervous wreck. As I was talking, he was searching through a big pile of papers he had on his seat, trying to hand me stacks of them, with his hands shaking uncontrollably. It's normal for driver's to be nervous on a traffic stop, but this was way beyond that. I think he handed me a birthday card at one point.\n\n\nHe started rambling, \"I'msorryIdon'tnormallydrivelikethat Iwastryingnottogetkilledbysomeonemaking alanechangeintome I'maStateTrooperCadetandIwouldneverdrivelikethat andIthinkyoujustsawtheendofwhathappened.\"\n\n\n\"Whoa, alright, chill out, this isn't anything crazy. Just take a second to collect yourself.  What did you say you are?\"\n\n\n\"I'm a State Trooper cadet.\" We have a rule: if off duty, we do not identify ourselves as law enforcement. You can get suspended for that if the purpose is to get out of some sort of trouble.\n\n\n\"Alright, I'll need to see your driver's license, registration, and insurance.\" He didn't have a copy of his insurance.\n\n\nA ticket and two crashes on his driving record. I walked back up, \"You're getting a warning on your driving, and a correctable ticket for the insurance. I can see that it's on file, but you're still required to carry a copy in your car. As long as you get it fixed, it won't affect your record.\" He was very appreciative and on his way. He got off easy.\n\n\nI returned to the office, and told a number of Troopers about the experience, and they all agreed with my line of thinking.\n\n\nAbout an hour later, I sent an email to the Academy. I explained that I stopped a cadet who identified themselves as such without reason, who was driving poorly, who reacted poorly under a stressful situation that shouldn't have been a big deal, and they were issued a citation that would not show up on their record if they fixed it.\n\n\nCadets are required to immediately report any interaction with law enforcement to the Academy staff. A couple days later I received an email back from an Academy sergeant, thanking me for the information.\n\n\nI put the ball in the cadet's court. If they did the right thing and reported it, they got to keep their job. If not, they were fired. I didn't find out the outcome.",

        "text": "For a bit of background, I'm a psychotic depressive. This will help explain my actions in my story.\n\nSo, back in March, I was having a bad episode. I spent my days locked away in my bedroom and refusing to speak to anyone and do pretty much anything except sleep, take my prescribed medication and distract myself by playing games and browsing the internet. My psychotic symptoms were really bad.\n\nOne of those March days, my parents confronted me about what was going on, and due to their rather aloof opinions on my mental health, weren't being supportive and were trying to force me into coming out of my bedroom, telling me to just \"take my medication and calm the hell down.\" They aren't always like this, to their credit, but the majority of the time they don't seem to really care about what I'm dealing with.\n\nOf course, this didn't help things. I felt betrayed by them for not taking my issues seriously and was on the verge of going off on them. But, being a person who hates conflict and confrontation of any kind, I didn't, and instead, took my anger out on a small mirror of mine and ended up breaking it and even went as far as to cut myself with some of the shards of broken glass.\n\n I waited until later that evening when they were both away and fled the house. My mind was a clusterfuck of negative emotions, hallucinations, and paranoia and I thought that if I left, I'd feel better.\n\nNow, I don't have my driver's license, so I ended up walking to \na friend of mine's apartment, who lived only a mile away; my one and only true friend. During this time, my parents had gotten home and found me missing. Due to my past history of suicide attempts, called 911. Of course, I was unaware of this.\n\nMy friend and I were sitting down chatting and having some drinks (non-alcoholic) and tells me that her boyfriend is on her way over and that we're going to go to the mall. Ten minutes or so later, a knock came at her apartment door. Must be her boyfriend. She goes up to the door and opens it.\n\nAt this point, I'm too distracted by the voices to be paying attention to anything. I slumped down in my friend's sofa and tried to get comfortable. Next thing I know, two cops come into her apartment, one male and one female. I was too zoned out to pay attention to anything they were saying, but eventually my focus came back for a short period of time.\n\n\"Are you ____ ____?\" The female officer asks. I looked at her and yawned.\n\n\"I'm fine, yes, just a bit tired.\" I replied. I was feeling worn out and thought she asked me how I was doing.\n\n\"Well, I'm trooper ____ with the state police, and this is my partner, trooper ____.\" Your parents called and told us that they're concerned that you left the house and that you may be suicidal.\"\n\nI was still somewhat zoned out. I missed half of the words she spoke. \"Uh... sure.\" I said, trying to regain my focus. I rubbed my eyes and stretched out before lying back down on the sofa.\n\n\"Have you done anything to harm yourself recently?\" She then asked. I had cut myself with glass earlier that afternoon after breaking my mirror, as stated before, and the cuts were visible on my arm. She must've seen them.\n\n\"How did you get these cuts? Were they self-inflicted?\" She asked, concerned. I looked at them and nodded.\n\n\"Yes, I did this earlier this afternoon.\" I sat up and looked at my arm.\n\n\"Do you have a history of self-harm and suicide attempts?\" She then asked. I nodded. She then asked how recently I attempted suicide. I told her in January I had attempted to overdose on medication but threw it all up due to my gag reflex. I then went on to explain my other past attempts. During the next series of questions, I explained a lot about my past and my mental health history, all the while the female officer relayed information over her radio.\n\nEventually, the questions ended and I was back in full focus, still somewhat distracted by the voices.\n\n\"Miss ____, due to your past history of attempts and the fact that you have self harmed today, I'm afraid we have no choice but to initiate what's called a 302. Do you know what that is?\" I had been 302'd before, so I knew the drill at this point. I nodded and said that I did.\n\n\"Okay, so you know that at this point in time, you will be taken to the hospital. If we were to call an ambulance, would you be willing to go with them?\" I refused. Those bills are hefty.\n\n\"No, I'm not going in an ambulance.\" I said, firmly. I looked away from her as she took a deep breath and spoke into her radio. I was hoping to get out of this. She said something along the lines of \"we'll be initiating the 302.\"\n\n\"Alright, ____, At this point in time, we're initiating the 302. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"I do, yes.\" I answered, still looking down at my feet. The male officer took a step outside to speak with my friend and her boyfriend.\n\n\"Alright, _____, since you're going with us, it's transport protocol that I'm going to have to place you in handcuffs. Turn around and place your hands behind your back for me, please.\" I complied.\n\nAfter being handcuffed, she patted me down then asked if I had anything in my bra. I said no. She then escorted me outside, past my friend and her boyfriend. I avoided eye contact with both of them, looking down at my feet, all the while hoping to avoid eye contact with any onlookers, if any.\n\n\"Put us on your visitation list!\" They called out, as I was led down the stairs and to the waiting car.\n\nedit: formatting",

        "text": "I think every cop has had it. It's the dream where you get killed in a shoot out or you kill someone. \n\nI was a liberal arts grad when I got into the academy. We practiced brace contact shooting on person-shaped dummies for four hours one day. This tactic involves shooting someone at point blank range, in the head, when they try to take your gun. \n\nThat night I dreamt about killing people, which I never had before. My military veteran friends informed me that this was fine and happened to them all the time.\n\nSince then, I've had the dream many times. I can't always remember all the details. Frequently my gun doesn't work. Sometimes the bullets dribble out the end in slow motion. Sometimes I die. Frequently I see people I know.\n\nOne time, in the dream, I was working overtime. A new guy, Brandon, from the day shift went out on a traffic stop. I headed over as backup. I pull up and as I get out of my car, there's the suspect. He's standing over Brandon, who is next to his patrol car on his knees and bleeding from his face. He's alive and terrified. The scene is crystal clear in my mind - the hot day, the location of the parking lot, the blood on his cheek. I freeze up. Do I shoot him or hit him with my baton? It's too late. I wake up.\n\nSometimes in the dream, I die. Once, I was surrounded by blue. I was near a lake. I see Brian, who went to academy with me. For some reason he is a bad guy and is trying to kill me. He's shooting me. My fucking gun won't work. I pull the trigger on my Glock. The bullet just drops out out the barrel like a paintball gun does during a jam. Misfire. Tap-rack like they taught me. Still misfire. I've definitely been shot now. Now my gun works. I'm shooting Brian (who knows why, he's a cool guy in real life). But he won't stop. Like my bullets did nothing. I'm collapsing to the ground and things are going dark. I'm outside my own body. I see that I'm bleeding out, but that I managed to kill Brian. At least I got him, I think to myself. Now it's my funeral. The bagpipes and all that shit. The procession. My mom is crying. Holy fuck, I lost it all for this damn job. Then I wake up.\n\nRecently in the dream, I got shot and survived. I'm working in a rural area (for some reason, even though I really work as city police). I'm talking to Dwight fucking Shrute from The Office with my partner. Dwight is an anti-government extremist. I know he's got a gun in his pocket but for some reason we didn't disarm him, just trying to talk to him. He draws from his hoodie pocket. I'm too slow. He shoots me.\nI'm falling backward. I hit the ground and draw my backup gun for some reason. I'm shooting Dwight now, a lot. Then I shoot him with my duty gun. He's dead. Now I'm talking to my sergeant, looking at my vest. I got shot like ten times but somehow the vest stopped it all and I didn't get hit. I can see in perfect clarity where the first shot hit me center mass, deforming the Kevlar inward. I feel bad about killing Dwight but I'm glad to be alive. And then I wake up.\n\nPecked out on my smartphone at 2 AM.... I can't sleep.",

        "text": "This past Wednesday, I met up with a local dealer in a borough about five miles from where I live to buy some pot. I'm not much of a marijuana user, but it does help with my depression. Recreational use is still illegal in my state but I take the risks of possessing it anyway.\n\nI was journeying back home when I got stopped by one of the borough's policeman. I was on foot (not the brightest idea) and figured I wasn't doing anything illegal so I wouldn't have to worry about him searching my drawstring bag that I keep with me when I'm out and about.\n\nUnfortunately, he did search my bag. Apparently I had been trespassing on private property (I didn't realize this until I remembered seeing the sign a couple of weeks prior) and didn't have identification on me so it was enough to warrant the search of my bag.\n\nHe found the pot in my bag and asked me about it. I told him that it was mine and that I use it on occasion, especially because of its positive effects regarding my depression. He asked if I had anything else but I said no. He estimated I had about 25 grams of it, which is a misdemeanor.\n\nHe eventually told me that I was going to be arrested for possessing it. Normally, a citation would be given, he told me, but since I didn't have identification on me and he couldn't verify my information I gave him that he'd be taking me to jail. Well, dang.\n\nAfter finishing up his search, he handcuffed me, patted me down, then placed me in his car. I sat there trying to figure out what I'm going to tell my parents when I call them from jail.\n\nI closed my eyes and began to imagine what jail was like when the car door suddenly opened. The officer told me to step out. He had a change of heart. \n\nHe told me that he's going to discard the marijuana and that he's going to let me go this time, stating that taking me to jail over something that is illegal yet helps my depression and giving myself a criminal record would do more harm than good. I felt a tsunami of relief overwhelm me. He removed the handcuffs, returned my bag to me, then bid me good luck as he drove away.",

We lived in a suburban area that (through much campaigning from the developer) got a classier name than the cesspit that we really belonged to. Think \"Alton Heights\" vs. \"Burbank.\"\n\nWe lived in a usually-quiet cul-de-sac and were in the middle of remodeling our house. We had a garage that opened into the entrance to our home. This night, the deadbolt that usually secured said entrance was off the door while the paint dried and the garage door was up, while Dad and I waited in the lounge room for Mum to get home from dinner with her friends, watching TV.\n\nA stranger bursts through the unsecured door and eyes my Dad and I, before saying simply \"Sorry mate, wrong house.\" We write this off as a bloke who was headed to a house party and headed down the wrong driveway.\n\nWithin the hour, we notice red and blue reflecting off the windows - more disturbingly, our house (along with the driveway headed to the battleaxe block behind us) is being taped up and there are somehow 3 squad cars, an ambulance and a motorcycle unit crammed into this tiny (100m long) street.\n\nWe head out to get answers, but the responding officers usher us back inside and tell us that an officer will be with us shortly. At this point... we've forgotten that mother dearest is still unaware of what is unfolding at home. This was before cell phones were common.\n\nThe lead officer turns up and asks us if we saw anything. We report our uninvited guest and get grilled on his specifics. Turns out there has been a shooting the next house over, down the battleaxe driveway. The suspect is an enforcer for one of the biggest drug kingpins in our area.\n\nAround this time we hear the screaming.\n\nMum has arrived home to find crime scene tape across the front of our house and a small army of techs, officers and paramedics swarming the scene. The attending officer insists on us finishing our statements. Afterwards we rush out to find that no one has been communicating the situation.\n\nLong story short, we ID the guy in a lineup - and add some serious security to our home. Not sure what came of it, however we were cautioned not to talk about it for a while. All I can say is that I'm glad this hired gun was professional enough to get a positive ID before pulling the trigger - it could have ended very differently.",

        "text": "Relevant context- I'm a CO. This takes place in a medium-high security level institution in a GP housing unit. Our offenders walk around freely in their assigned wing most of the time and have their own keys to their cells. No bathrooms in the cells- just a communal one in the wing. Two offenders are assigned to each cell, and they are *both* responsible for items found in the common areas of the cell. \n\n\n\nThis should have been a relatively quiet day for me. It was my day to man our secondary control module, which generally means doing a whole lot of nothing other than watching the wings and making announcements on the intercom. However, during chow, one officer leaves the house to assist with that, and the secondary control module is no longer required to be manned. This left me to do whatever I wanted for a bit, and I decided to venture out on a wing walk. This is where the trouble began.\n\n\n\nI walked into B-wing and immediately picked up a strong odor of alcohol. I'd smelled this before during wing walks on rare occasions, but it had always been quite faint and untraceable, and my search efforts turned up nothing. This time it was very obvious to me that the source of this smell was cell 1- the smell was *so* incredibly strong. Funnily enough, I had actually gone on a brewery tour a few weeks prior, and I would liken it to that. Still, I doubted myself. Hooch is a rarity in our prison. I had certainly never found any and, for that matter, couldn't remember the last time anyone had. \n\n\n\nI continued my walk in B-wing, sure that the odor would be gone by the time I exited. Nope- I again passed cell 1 and it was just as strong as it had been initially. I was still relatively new and excited at the prospect of actually finding something cool, but I had to wait until our other CO came back from chow before I could search the cell. I could hardly stand to wait, but had something kicked off in our housing unit, I would have been the only officer to respond immediately, so I didn't want to be tied up in a search at that time. Additionally, as I'm sure you've gathered from the title, one of the offenders assigned to this cell- we'll call him Mr. Green- is a certifiable raging lunatic, which I'll explain further soon. But, because of this, I thought it might be best to have an officer watching from the control module when I went to do the search, just in case Mr. Green totally flipped out and I needed immediate backup. \n\n\n\nFinally, chow ended, the other CO came back, and I set off to do my search. I was honestly hoping to catch the cell at a time when it was empty. Normally, I'd hope for the occupants to be present since they usually keep their contraband on them when it's not being used. However, hooch wouldn't really fall into the category of contraband that you can take with you when you leave your cell (at least not in large amounts, I suppose), and an empty cell would mean no incident with Mr. Green. I had no such luck. \n\n\n\nI walked up to the cell and saw Mr. Green standing at his desk. He had just taken a swig from his cup and set it back onto the desk when his eyes met mine. \"Mr. Green, I'm here to search your cell. Step out for a pat search,\" I said. \"Okay!\" he said nervously, and continued to stand as still as a statue. I tried again- \"Sir, I need you to step *out* of your cell.\" He wasn't being aggressive, and continued to say, \"okay,\" but continued to stand still- we'd call this passive resistance. It was almost comical, because it kind of looked like he was glued to the spot. I tried one more time, and thankfully Mr. Green finally seemed to grasp the fact that if continued to stand there staring at me like an idiot, he would wind up with a face full of pepper spray, and he complied. \n\n\n\nI stepped into the cell, shutting the door behind me. The smell was so strong, it was almost dizzying- not normally how you would describe the smell of alcohol, but this was absolutely overwhelming. I always start my searches at the top shelf of the desk, working my way down and eventually back to the bunks on the opposite wall. I found what I was looking for almost immediately- two large bowls on the top of the desk filled with a liquid substance and sugar at the bottom. Admittedly, it wasn't much, and I was kind of disappointed. But, the disappointment didn't last long. I proceeded to look under the desk, where I found a large white bleach bottle. Definitely *not* something that belongs in an offender's cell. I opened it, and saw a chunky, colorful substance that smelled horrible. Honestly, my immediate thought was, 'Why is this guy storing his vomit?!\" before I realized what it actually was. Two more pitchers and a few cups of that substance (including the one Mr. Green had been drinking from), a large trash bag of fruit, and a bunch of rubber tubing later, and the Cell 1 Brewery was officially closed. All in all, I recovered approximately 5 gallons of hooch. \n\n\n\nNow, the fun part- getting all of this out of the cell and getting Mr. Green taken down to the hole (administrative segregation). Remember how I mentioned that he was a certifiable raging lunatic? Well, here are just a few quick examples of things he'd done in the past that lead me to refer to him as such:\n\n&gt;Exposing himself to staff members (male or female, it didn't seem to matter to him) and asked them if they had ever been 'mushroom picking' or saying 'I want to have sex with your baby!'\n\n&gt;Jumping off the upper walk of the wing into a trash can, then jumping out of said trash can toward a CO and attempting to punch him in the face (thankfully he missed, he just knocked the CO's hat off his head)\n\n&gt;Making shitty attempts at flirting with me before telling me that his 'pen was out of ink' and asking me to get him a new one, before handing me a god damned *syringe* and running away\n\n\nAgain, these are just to name a few! So I'm sure that you can see why it would be important to approach him with caution, and why getting him in restraints and down to the hole would be much easier said than done. \n\n\n\nIt was quite a mess while we were waiting for shift commander approval to lock down Mr. Green and his cellie (we'll call him Mr. Lopez). Unfortunately, the shift commander initially refused to believe that I had found hooch, despite the sergeant assuring him that there was no doubt about it. This left us to hold Mr. Green and Mr. Lopez in the housing unit while the sergeant went to the shift commander's office with the hooch for testing. The sergeant let us take the two offenders into the office prior to her departure, but directed me to go back to the control module and start typing up the violations (there was no doubt in her mind about what I had found), so that left three COs sitting in the office with Mr. Lopez and Mr. Green, who was becoming more agitated by the second. \n\n\n\nAbout 10-15 minutes after I'd gone back to the control module, I heard one of the COs in the office, (Officer Jacobs in a previous story of mine, actually) call over the radio for *immediate* assistance, using our radio code that basically means 'shit is hitting the fan and everyone who can possibly respond to this needs to get here *now.*' Uh-oh. \n\n\n\nApparently, while I was in the control module, the sergeant had called the office and given the go ahead to lock down the offenders, as the substance had tested positive (shocker!) and turned out to be about 80 proof.\n\n\n\n \nAnyway, I tore into the office to find Mr. Green on the floor in the corner, with a perfect line of pepper spray across his eyes and all three COs on top of him. Apparently, prior to my entrance when he was told to submit to wrist restraints, he said, \"fuck that,\" and took a fighting stance- wrong move! Jacobs sprayed him, Mr. Green stepped back slightly, then forward again and continued to try to fight, resulting in him being placed on the floor shortly before I arrived. Now, Mr. Green was honestly your average-sized fellow, but he was fighting like crazy. I immediately took control of his legs because he was kicking wildly. He continued to squirm around as much as humanly possible, but we finally managed to put restraints on him. We stood him up as he repeatedly attempted to spit on us (he failed, thankfully), and he was escorted out. Apparently he fought the whole way down to the hole, and of course refused to cell once he arrived. The most memorable thing he said on his way out, though, was his response to the sergeant who told him he would get a sanitary violation for spitting on the floor- \"Write it up! Tell your mom! I don't give a fuck!\" Even funnier was the fact that the whole time this was happening, Mr. Lopez was huddled in the opposite corner of the office looking absolutely petrified. I think he was honestly happy to be placed in restraints and taken to the safety of a cell in the hole.\n\n\n\nOf course, I'm sure you assumed that Mr. Green was mad about going to the hole over the hooch, or even just the fact that he would be losing all of it. Well, you're wrong. According to Officer Jacobs, Mr. Green became irate for two reasons: (1) The fact that his cellie, Mr. Lopez, had to go to the hole (apparently he didn't think that was fair) and (2) he wanted a different pair of his shoes (which we couldn't allow him to go back into the wing to get) because he was worried that we would 'mess with them' once he was gone... Right. \n\n\n\nAnyway, that's pretty much all for this story. Mr. Green surely belongs in a mental facility rather than a prison, and honestly it's really sad, but that's definitely a debate all it's own. He did get released back to GP again some time after this violation, but was sent back to the hole and eventually transferred to a higher security level institution due to the number of violations he accumulated and their nature (I believe he ended up with another violation for assaulting staff). We always tried to be pretty lenient on him when it came to most of the rules that he broke, but some things, like the hooch, couldn't be overlooked. \n\n\n\nI realize that this may not be a super exciting story, but I love to write and this is a very memorable experience for me, being that it was one of the first decently interesting things I found during a search. I hope that at least a few people enjoyed reading it!\n\n\nEdit: further clarification as to why we ended up having to pepper spray him/place him on the floor. \n",

        "text": "So,\n\nabout ten years ago, I was a newly-promoted Deputy Sheriff's Sergeant in a rural, sparse southern US county.\n\nIt was summertime, and the weekend, and night shift; a trifecta few will understand and fewer appreciate.\n\nThis confluence of events spawns strange calls for service everywhere there is police to respond. Tonight would be no different.\n\nSo, it's way after midnight. I am on a winding, dark, desolate stretch of two lane blacktop bisecting some remote mountain area. I haven't seen a porch light in miles. But I have seen mosquitos keeping pace with my 2004 crown victoria police interceptor, humming along at a leisurely pace. \n\nThe air is thick; it hangs around me like a moist, suffocating sheet. My vest is stuck to my cotton t shirt is stuck to my chest and belly, sitting in a pile atop my leather gunbelt, damp from the humidity and me sweating like a marathoner. In hell.\n\nI am actually contemplating closing my eyes to see if it improves my ability to see into the darkness as I wend my way down a steep grade. I am about to wink my headlights when without warning, I see it!\n\nLaying completely across the roadway, someone has thrown out a perfectly good white woman!\n\nTan legs, short red skirt, white, dirty blouse and blonde... oh yeah. STOPPPPPP! I almost forget to not run her over because I am wondering if I have fallen asleep at the wheel and just imagining what's occurring.\n\nThe cars' rear end gets a little fishy, but I slide to a stop, the apparition disappearing under my push bumper.\n\nI leap from the seat, almost forgetting P for park, heading to the side of the road, certain I'm being ambushed, half cursing myself for not pushing through.\n\nAfter what seems an eternity has passed, frogs and katydids livestreaming my folly, I realize no gunplay is occurring.\n\nI now am curious. Is there something under my cruiser?\n\nI approach the front of the car, streamlight piercing the Appalachian darkness. Sure enough, there she was. Sweeping the area looking for part two, and finding none, I tapped her forehead with the shiny toe of my perfectly polished Danner Acadias.\n\nAfter a few moments, Sleeping Beauty starts slurring a friendly greeting. And by friendly, I mean horny. She is reaching up trying to grab my goob while laughing. I am ma'am'ing her in my best Academy voice, trying to see the trailer or camp she came from; all I can see is a steep embankment where something has disturbed branches and leaves. \n\nShe is crying, saying her boyfriend sucks, and do I want a new girlfriend. I am telling the dispatcher where I am, and what has happened. She is sleepy as I am, and cannot grasp the situation; there is no cell service for miles.\n\nNow I have two women, both trying to tell me a story. One is telling me there is nothing out where I am for her (the other her) to be there. The other is telling me she wants to die.\n\nI tell the one with the ruby lips that she can't stay there, does she want a ride. I tell the other one in a special way (leaving the radio keyed so she can hear the Lady of the Mountain Mist yammering in the background).\n\nI'd like for this story to devolve into a cheap porn narrative; but I really liked my job back then. I took Missus Speed Bump to a place that wound up being her rich parent's summer cottage. Apparently having a police officer half drag their half naked daughter up the walk while she tried to go down on me wasn't new or unusual for them. \n\nMy only regret was that body worn camera systems hadn't been invented yet; I only had my pocket audio recorder I played back for the rest of the shift (and jailer, and dispatcher) when I returned to the jail after clearing from that call. \n\nAnd, that wasn't even the top ten weirdest thing that happened to me!",

They claim it was to provide better and more accurate care. We know that they did it because hospitals were getting filled with crazy people who didn't pay their bills and wanted a way to reduce their intake. I'm sorry if this is a little ranty but someone is going to be killed from this crap. \n\nIn theory the social worker is supposed to come out to the scene and conduct an interview there after law enforcement secures the person (the legal justification here is really vague and is a jurisprudence time bomb). In reality they usually talk to them on our phone for a minute and try to convince them not to come in. Then we remind them our obligations and due regard when we have legitimate threats of self harm. At the hospital they conduct another interview and if the person is really insistent on getting held then the social worker ok's it and we have to fill out the paperwork. Sorry about the rant but hopefully this story explains my frustrations.\n\nDispatch: 123 respond to Fairway Greens Golf for 19 yr old female, self inflicted cuts to her arms from a broken glass, now crying in the parking lot. First responders are being paged as well.\n\nI arrive on scene a minute later and see 3 younger women in black pants/shirts huddled around one sitting on the pavement. They're holding bar towels wrapped around her forearms and they're soaking in blood pretty well. Paramedics arrive pull up behind me and I get a few words from the girl that the glass is inside and she only wants to kill herself - good enough to push that mess onto the paramedics. It'll clearly need to be stitched by doctors so that's an easy transport there.\n\nStanding outside the door to the restaurant is the middle aged owner of the golf course. He's trying to talk to someone on his cellphone, shuffle a group of people inside and failing to hide clearly traumatic scene 20 feet behind him. He says that she's worked there for 2 years and he just fired her that afternoon for drinking at the bar after hours. She's a \"pretty little thing\" and \"hates that this has happened to her\"...\n\nThe other waitresses tell me he's an asshole for firing her. They explain he had been the one drinking with her after hours - but if I wanted any more information I would have to get it from the girl. That's all they were willing to say. \n\nSo I talk to her in the ambulance and the story is as it seems. She's upset because the 'love of her life' won't admit whats going on and she was just fired for 'bullshit' reasons (I'm sure you can connect the dots here). She's adamant that she's trying to kill herself, and she'll do it again. If she finds a way in the hospital she'll do it there, and if they release her she'll do it right away. Sounds good enough for me - I call the social worker and after the girl refuses to talk we're on our way for an involuntary hold. \n\nWe get to the hospital and the social worker heads in for the \"5 minute interview, I'll be right back this is an easy one, promise.\"... 25 minutes later social workers is finally done. \n\n\"Well we had a great chat, she said she's just in a bad mood. She says she gets this way sometimes and spending time with family helps. She has presence (wtf is that?) and that makes me feel like a hold isn't needed. I think we could just release her to a family-\" at this point a nurse rips open the door and screams \"I NEED HELP NOW\"\n\nI push past the social worker and rush in there. The girl is about 6 inches off the ground, blue in the face, bra is around her neck tied to the tv mount. She's about 90 lbs soaking wet so I lift her up and untie her. She starts coughing and gagging and comes back right away. No big deal. \n\nThe social worker didn't say another word when filling out the paperwork.",

If you don't know what sovereign citizens are, it can be summarized as a belief that laws don't apply to you unless you want them to. And not surprisingly, whenever these people are found, the laws don't apply to them.\n\n\nI went to back up a young, new Trooper on a traffic stop after he specifically requested another unit. Something that always confused me about these people is that they claim we have no authority, but usually stop for our emergency lights. I need to stop trying to understand them since they make no sense. Once I arrived, Young Trooper told me how he stopped the vehicle for not having any license plates, and the driver was refusing to identify himself, and quoting random laws and court cases.\n\nI walked up to the window. \"Good afternoon, sir!\" I always start out cheery.\n\n\"Good afternoon. Are you elected into your office?\" Some of them believe the only police with authority is the Sheriff because they're elected positions.\n\n\"No. The governor is elected. Our chief is appointed by the governor. And we're all appointed by the chief.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, what?\" I seemed to confuse him, so I repeated myself. That didn't seem to fit with his plan, so he went a different route.\n\n\"Are you familiar with Ulysses indoctrination of civil indemnity?\" That's not what he said, but it was some made up, obsolete term.\n\n\"No, I'm not familiar with that.\"\n\n\"According to the Ulysses indoctrination of civil indemnity, I am not a person, and...\"\n\n\"Stop. Stop.\" I cut him off. \"I'm not interested in your sovereign bullshit. If I fail to get what I need from you, you're going to jail, it's as simple as that. My partner has told me that you're failing to identify yourself.\"\n\n\"I already gave your partner my name and driver's license.\" I looked back at Young Trooper, as if to ask, *So why am I here?*\n\nYoung Trooper chimed in, all antsy, \"No. No he didn't.\" I pointed at Young Trooper to indicate he needed to keep his cool.\n\n\"Sir, do you have a driver's license?\"\n\n\"Yes I do.\"\n\n\"May I see it, please?\"\n\n\"I don't have it on me, but I know my number.\" I wrote it down, and handed it to Young Trooper. \"Run that.\" It came back valid, to the name, date of birth, and local address this driver provided.\n\n\"Thank you, wait in the car.\"\n\nI walked back to Young Trooper, and he asked me, \"So...now what?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean, he goes to jail right?\" \n\n\"Fooor......what?\"\n\n\"Well, we still haven't identified him.\"\n\n\"You have his driver's license number. Pull up his picture on your computer and see if that's him.\"\n\nThirty seconds later. \"Yeah, that's him.\"\n\n\"Okay then. Write him for the codes he violated, and he's on his way.\" He took his citation and was on his way.\n\nWe did a little debrief, and Young Trooper asked me, \"So if we couldn't ID him, what would we have done?\" I asked Young Trooper what *he* would've done. \"I would've taken him to jail.\"\n\n\"No. You would've asked him to exit his car. He would've refused. We would've applied OC spray, maybe a taser deployment, ripped him out, and then taken him to jail. Because that's how that would've played out.\" \n\nI like it when words are the biggest use of force.",

        "text": "I have a pretty bad history of mental illness and have been hospitalized a few times in the past by LEOs and after coming across this subreddit, I decided why not share a story about one since I haven't found any stories involving involuntary commitment.\n\nSo, last summer, I was having a rough night. I was sitting out by a small bridge that connects the next door town and the rural area that I live in. It's a pretty far drop and I was contemplating suicide. I called crisis out of a last ditch effort to find some sort of comfort since I didn't have the balls to jump.\n\nI stayed on the line with crisis for almost an hour and during that time walked home. I must say I felt a bit better at this time. I was lying down in my living room when I see a car sitting in front of my house. My neighborhood is very quiet and no one ever really drives through unless they live here, let alone stop in front of someone's house so I got up and looked out to find a state trooper sitting out there.\n\nI've been 302'd once before this time so I assumed they were here for me. I took a few deep breaths and walked out the back door and walked around the house onto my driveway to meet them. I didn't want to go out the front door because my dog would probably go ballistic. By the time I was outside, one of them had already come into my backyard with his flashlight and introduced himself before asking if I was so-and-so. I said yes and he spoke for a few moments on his radio and asked for my cell phone since I was still on the phone with crisis and spoke to the person I was speaking to for about a minute to confirm some details that I spoke about to crisis.\n\nAfter hanging up with crisis, he asked me to come onto our driveway. His partner and him talked to me for a minute or two asking about what was going on tonight and whatnot and I told him about feeling suicidal and that my plan was to jump off the bridge, yet I didn't have the guts to do it. Eventually they asked if they were to call an ambulance if I would go with them to the hospital but I refused. I couldn't pay another hefty bill.\n\nEventually they told me that due to my past history of suicide attempts (confirmed by crisis when he talked to them briefly) and the fact that I was a danger to myself AND others (I mentioned something with crisis about wanting to hurt someone else) that they were going through with the 302 (involuntary commitment).\n\nAt this point I knew there was no point in running or doing something dumb so I listened and cooperated with them. They told me that I was going to be transported to such-and-such and since they were doing it, I'd have to be handcuffed and frisked. Once they were done with that and finding nothing on me other than my earbuds, phone, and house key, the journey began to the hospital.\n\nAfter arriving, I was escorted to the ER area reserved for people there for mental health reasons and after being freed from my restraints, was placed in a small room with a bed as the troopers filled out paperwork and commenting on my 100% cooperative behavior. Once they left, I was eventually examined and the ER doctor deemed that  didn't seem to need inpatient care and let me go a little while afterwards.\n\nHope this story fits this subreddit since it pertains to police work. If not, then I apologize.\n\n",

        "text": "This happened about 9 years ago while I was still in high school.\n\nIt's a cold, February night. I had just returned to town from a Jazz Band performance. The night was still young and it's the weekend. Time to hit up my buddies to do some drinking.\n\nOnly 2 issues. First, we need someone to buy for us. And second, we need a place to party. Ya know, typical issues to have when underage drinking.\n\nSo we start looking for a hookup. I call around and finally get a hold of my step-brother. Him and I had never really gotten along when I was younger (he was quite a bit older than me and had a rough childhood He usually took his frustrations out on bullying me). Anyway, it had been a few years since we had spent any time around one another, so I was hesitant about asking. But I do and he's more than happy to oblige. Awesome, water under the bridge.\n\nBooze safely tucked away in my backpack, we begin our search for a place to party. I get a hold of my friend, we'll call him Jack. Jack says that his Mom has a business office in town that he has access too. We can go there and not have to worry about getting in trouble. So I make my way over to said business and park out front and wait for Jack to show up. This is where everything starts to go wrong.\n\nSo my buddy and I are sitting in my car in front of Jack's Mom's office. My car, well it's not exactly a vehicle that screams \"I should be here at 1 am in the morning\". It's an old Chevy station wagon that's pretty rough looking. We've been sitting here for about 10 minutes when a cop car rolls into the gas station that this business sits behind. We both watch nervously as the officers exit their vehicle and begin walking around the gas station. Both officers appear to be looking for someone or something. Then they stop and turn and shine their flashlights right at me and my buddy. \n\nShit.\n\nThe officers get in their car and pull over in behind my car. FUCK. I was sweating bullets. My buddy in the passenger seat tells me to act calm. But he has dealt with the police on more than one occasion. I, however, have not. The officer walks up to my window.\n\nHe asks me the normal questions and then, of course, what we're doing there. I think quick and come up with a story of how we had a friend in from out of town and we hadn't seen him in awhile. We wanted a place where we could chill and talk and not have to worry about waking anyone up. So we came to this office because our friends Mom owns it and we had permission. Well the cop doesn't really buy it and then proceeds to tell us that the gas station across the way had been vandalized and that's why they showed up to investigate. We happened to be sitting behind it, so they naturally needed to check us out and make sure we weren't the vandals. \n\nAbout this time our  friend Jack and another friend drive by. Seeing the cops, they keep going. They end up getting pulled over up the road a few minutes later. More on that in a bit.\n\nThe officer now asks me if I have anything in the car that he should know about. Drugs, alcohol, weapons, or spray paint. I say no but remember, I've got a backpack full of booze. He then asks if he can search my car. My buddy tells me to say no, so I do. This makes the officer angry.\n\n\"So you do have something you don't want me to know about!?\" he shouted\n\nI cracked. I couldn't deal with the pressure. \"Yes, I have some beer and liquor in my back pack\".\n\nThe officer calms back down and asks me to step out. He asks me again if I consent to a search and I agree. They do their thing and he asks me about the alcohol and why I had it. I make up a story about how my step-brother had the booze and was staying with my step-sister for awhile and that her husband was a former alcoholic. Not wanting the booze to be around her husband, she told him to get rid of it. He of course wasn't about to just throw it away, so he called me and asked me if I could hang onto it until he could get it another day. A stupid story, I know. But it was all my freezing ass, scared shitless 17 year old self could think of at the time.\n\nAfter I finish my story, another officer rolls up. He steps out and immediately starts grilling me (he seemed like he was on a power trip that night) telling me that my story doesn't match up with my buddies down the street. That they pulled them over in a church parking lot and Jack told them he was on his way to stay at a friend's house. I get mad and raise my voice to the officer because I'm fucking cold and frustrated. I tell him that I can't explain why his story didn't match mine but that what I said was true and that I'm sticking to it. Eventually power trip officer gets on the radio and confirms that our stories match up (maybe he was just trying to scare us?) \n\nAnyway, the original officer has us sit in the back of his car and tells us what's going down. Tells me that since I was honest about the booze, all he's going to do is confiscate it and let me off with a verbal warning. But since I was 17 and it was after midnight, I was going to get a curfew violation. My buddy that was with me was 18, so he didn't end up getting anything. Jack and my other friend got curfew violations as well. We all ended up going to court about them and getting them deferred for 6 months as long as we didn't violate it again. \n\nStill to this day am thankful that I didn't end up with an MIP on my record, even though I know those cops had to have known our story was bullshit.\n\nOh and want to know what Jack originally told the cops when he got pulled over? That he was sitting in the church parking lot because he was really religious and felt compelled to pray. They whole time having an open plastic cup full of Jack Daniels in his cup holder. He's just lucky he didn't get searched like I did. Man, talk about a bizarre night.\n\nTL;DR- Went to meet up with some friends at a buddies Mom's business office to drink. Get spotted by cops looking for some gas station vandals and have vehicle searched. Make up story as to why we're there and why I have alcohol underage. Get off with a curfew violation and booze taken away.\n\n\n",

So outside a the club with the bad reputation - where the cops where always present, so they could step in when and not if their assistence was required, my drunk buddy got a great idea. He went to one of the cops and flickered of the officers cap.\nFacepalming and seething with anger at my friend, I went over there and put a hand on his shoulder just as he got grounded. The other officer thought that I was intervening, and grounded me as well. Handcuffs and off to the detention for the night. I never put any blame on the cops, but stories like these are why he's an old friend now.\n\nMy second rule breaks rule 2 a bit, but forgive this first time poster.\n\nA year or two after my first story, I was doing my national service in DEMA (Danish FEMA + firefighting). My group were out partying in town, as well as 2 mates who were on reserve duty. They could leave the base, but not get under the influence of whatever. So late at night when we're getting back to base to sleep it out before the mornings entertainment, we see this cop car come screaming with lights and sirens and all, pull a stop in front of the guardhouse at the base, where our 2 mates jump out and run into the base. While the rest of us had walked or taken a taxi back, the 2 on reserve duty had run up to some cops, told them that the alarm was sounded at base, and that they had to return asap. So the good officers had given them a fast lift to the base. Ofcause there was no alarm, they just figured it was an easy way to get home quick.",

        "text": "When I'm on patrol, I'll often drive alongside the bus lane, in one of the lanes for regular traffic. Cheaters in that lane see me, stop in the lane, and make a lane change behind me...like that means I won't pull them over. I just pull into the center divide or the shoulder until they pass, and pull them over anyway. This is one of those times.\n\nI walked up to the car, which had a male driver and a female passenger.\n\n\"Good afternoon. I stopped you for the bus lane violation. I need to see your driver's license.\" I stopped addressing people as \"sir\" or \"ma'am\" because I've been wrong too many times.\n\n\"That was my mistake. Traffic was all backed up, and I'm not from the area, and didn't realize it was a bus lane.\"\n\n\"It seemed odd that you didn't realize it was a bus lane until you saw me.\" He handed me his driver's license.\n\nThe passenger joined in. \"That other car was in the lane, too, and you didn't stop them.\" I didn't realize this was a three person conversation.\n\nI addressed the passenger, \"The other driver had a special exemption on their car that allowed them to use this lane.\" I looked at the driver's license, and saw he had an address in the city we were in. I addressed the driver, \"Your license shows your address is in this city, on a nearby street, and it shows it was issued three years ago. You're saying you're not from around here?\"\n\n\"That's my mom's address, I just leave it on there, but I moved to Madison a few years ago.\" Passenger again, a bit agitated, \"Yeah, we're in Madison now.\"\n\n\"Have you updated your license with the BMV?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"Once you move, you're required to update your address within 30 days. Wait in the car, I'll be right back.\"\n\nI wrote the ticket, walked back up, and handed the driver his information back. The passenger looked back at me, saw my ticket book in hand, and let out a fast, angry, exhale. \"I just want to point out that lots of people are in this lane intentionally, who shouldn't be, almost causing crashes, and we were here on accident.\" At this point, if you're the driver, you should probably direct your passenger to act in a more professional manner, i.e. stop talking.\n\nI addressed the passenger. \"Hey. Chill out. I haven't even explained what's going on yet.\" I spoke to the driver again, \"Sir, you're getting a warning for being in the bus lane. However, you're getting a correctable citation for not updating the address on your driver's license.\" He signed it and was very appreciative. The passenger let out a number of \"Thank you's\" as well.\n\nI laughed on the walk back to my car. Sometimes the satisfaction is disproving people's preconceptions is better than a ticket.",

Right outside of her neighborhood was a 3 way stop. It being rush hour and me on the small intersecting street, I was sitting there for a very long time. I got tired of waiting and decided my little sports car could shoot the gap and not slow the next car. I gun it I red line it all the way into second gear. I've realized I'm catching up to the car ahead of me so I clutch in and match traffic speed. Now that I'm not driving like a 17 year old hellion I relax as I start to cross the highway. I pull up to a red light intending to turn left onto the frontage and dang it if a cop doesn't pull up onto my ass. Light turns green and on come the cop lights. \"Shit\" I make my left turn and pull into the cracker barrel parking lot and start digging out license and registration. \"SHOW US YOUR HANDS!\" Oops I'm in trouble \"STEP OUT OF THE VEHICLE WITH YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD!\" I'm thinking that my mom is going to kill me as the officer cuffs me and parks my behind on a curb. I sit there stewing in my thoughts of my life being over and that this will surely get my ass thrown out of the Navy before I even ship out. Also note that there are about 7 cop cars there at this point and no one has talked to me yet. Enter Car Guy Cop! I notice an officer walking around my car with a bemused look (I took all the car badges off) he comes over sits down right next to me and asks \"what kind of car is that?\" \n\"Oh that's a Mazda mx6\" \n\"Really? Huh never heard of that before\"\nWe talk about the car and his project car for a bit before he asks the big question...\"What the hell were you doing 90 in a 35 for during RUSH HOUR?!\"\nI explained that I got tired of waiting and in an effort to not slow the guy I pulled in front of I was just watching my tach not paying attention to speed and all that.\n\"Hold up...you never got out of second gear?\" \n\"Yes sir\" \nhe got up giggling like a madman and went and talked with the first officer. \nAbout 5 min later he comes over and hands me ticket for going 15 over and takes off the cuffs. \n\nI later met up with and helped with his car getting it track ready. 90 in a 35 would have been a serious charge that might have ended my navy career before it began. And that is how my dumbass was saved by the Car Guy Cop\n\nEdit; as a lot of are pointing out flaws let me say it was some time ago and I am sure my memory isn't exact. Point of the story though is this guy saved my bacon.",

I fully believe that she was going to try to stab me with her needle... I just couldn't stop replaying the news story in my head if I had shot her. I'd be sued and probably fired, even though she was likely trying to give me Hep-C and commit suicide by cop.",

        "text": "So this is my first time posting to this subreddit. Quick backstory I was in my second year of LE at the time of this incident and it wasn't the first drug related case I had been involved in but was one of the first most depressing cases I've seen.\n\nI was patrolling my area when I get a call to respond to a local motel that you rent by the hour, because it's a good business model \nTo rent by the hour of course... anyway there is this father calling to do a welfare check on his son who just got our of rehab. The call pretty much states the kid has been doing awesome at rehab and has been clean for almost a year now. The guy had got a 2 day pass to leave the rehab center and go to the outside world and enjoy the sober life. The father was supposed to be getting a call from his son every hour or two just to make sure he was ok. I'm assuming the father didn't know the area to well because the father let his son pick the hotel he could stay in. I call the father to get some extra details on his son and the room he is supposed to be in since he didn't initially give us the room number and boy is this guy proud of his kid. In between my questions he is explaining this guys life story about how he struggled with drugs for 5 years or so and how he was doijng literally anything for a hit, how he had convinced his son to go to rehab, how his son is going to come to work for him and make more money then he knows what to do with, how he gave him 1000 dollars to spend for his two day pass and all this great stuff! I don't want to tell him anything negative because who am I to crush this guys hopes for his son. \n\nWell I arrive on scene and go straight to the room he is supposed to be in. The a.c. in the window is going full blast inside of the room and you can hear it from the outside. I knock several times hoping for the best and just thinking well maybe this guy went out to get something to eat or maybe a walk. I forget the exact circumstances on how we were able to get into the room but one of the cleaning ladies was coming by at the same time I got there and was cleaning his room next or something like that. She does her procedure before opening the room and as soon as she does and the door swings open she just steps back and starts crying. \n\nThe guy is sprawled out on the bed nude as can be with a needle still sticking out of his arm. It made my heart drop because I was starting to have high hopes for this guys future... well I call my supervisor out and the detectives come out. We check the guys room and wallet i.d. and stuff. There isn't a single dollar in his wallet... he had a few receipts for food and some other small things but otherwise we can't find any money in the room which obviously leads us to believe every dollar he had was in that syringe. We call the dad and it has to be one of the worst conversations I had heard at the time for a drug related incident. You can hear the guy over the phone with the detective bawling hai eyes out. The det hangs up with him and we proceed with the investigation. Well dad shows up and isn't any better sounding then when he was on the phone. We don't let him anywhere near the scene and I'm put with the dad to make sure he doesn't interfere or do anything silly. It was sad to hear him crying and pleading for his son to wake up, the questions he had that went unanswered and everything else that happened that day.\n\n\nI've got a ton more of stories as I'm sure we all do, happy and sad so if I did a decent job and you'd like another please let me know! Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this",

        "text": "This story is about 10 years old, maybe older. When it happened I was a dumb kid who partied hard and loved the ladies. Just wanted to preface the story with that so you know I'm not as much of an idiot now.\n\n\nWhen I was 17 or 18, I would hang out at my uncle's place in the same neighborhood that I lived in. Neighborhood, trailer park, it's all the same, right? My uncle was only 3 years older than me, so we got along well. We drank and smoked and listened to music pretty much that whole summer.\n\n\nWord got around that I had access to a house with no parents. When you're 18, those are hard to come by. We ended up having 3-4 parties a week. Ever wondered how many drunk teenagers a singlewide trailer can hold? It's more than you think.\n\n\nAnyways, during this time of partying, a whole new world of...female companionship opened up to me. I met all kinds of girls. Rich ones. Poor ones. Immigrant ones (that one's an even better story, but totally not appropriate for this sub). Girls I thought were nerdy in school but got DOWN. It was great.\n\n\nOne day, I got a Myspace message from this girl. She said I was cute but she didn't think her brother would like her to see me. I checked who her brother was, and she was right. He was someone who came to the parties every once in a while, but he made sure everyone knew his sister was a no go. So me and the girl messaged back and forth and exchanged numbers. Turns out she lived two neighborhoods over from where I was. Sweet.\n\n\nA few days pass, and we throw a huge America themed party. Everyone was there. Everyone was drunk/high/trippin'/rollin' or a mixture of two or more. It was a blast. I remember my buddy jumped too high dancing to a techno remix of The Lion King's theme song than his head went through the ceiling. But I digress.\n\n\nThe party died down around 2am and none of my...female companionship options played out. So I texted Myspace girl. She was up, and she said I should come get her so we can get to know each other better. Uh, yeah. Duh.\n\n\nSo I started walking down the street to my buddy's ready-for-the-junkyard Blazer. I didn't have a car at the time. We always parked down the street and told people to do the same so it wasn't suspicious and so we/our guests wouldn't block the neighbors in. I'm about halfway there, when I see two police SUVs sitting in the street facing opposite directions so they can talk out their window to each other.\n\n\nI had to make a decision. Do I turn around and just bolt and risk a chase, or do I go to the truck, grab whatever I can find that gives me an excuse, and walk back hoping they don't say anything. I went with option 2. Turns out there was nothing in the truck to grab except trash. Ooops.\n\n\nAs I was walking back to the house, one of the cops drove up next to me. (He'll be C1 and other cop will be C2)\n\n\nC1: Hey kid. What are you doing out right now?\n\nMe: Walking back to the house. I couldn't find my toothbrush.\n\n**I HAVE NO IDEA WHY I SAID THAT.**\n\nC1: Why don't you wait right there so I can get out and we can talk..\n\nSo they both park and come up to me.\n\nC1: You been drinking tonight?\n\nMe: No, sir. Just hanging out with my uncle.\n\nC2: You been kissing your uncle? Your breath smells like a liquor store.\n\n**OWNED**\n\nMe: No, sir.\n\n\nAt this point, I'm thinking to myself, \"You're going to jail and Mom is going to murder you and Myspace girl is going to tell her brother I tried to get with her so he'll beat me up...\"\n\n\nThe cops then tell me to put my hands on my head so they can search me. I quickly complied and continued to think about how much shit I was in.\n\n\nThey started taking things out of my pocket and putting them under my hands so I was holding things on my head. Wallet. Blazer key. Phone. **Whole strip of condoms.**\n\n\nC2: What are these for?\n\nMe: For fucking, officer.\n\n**OMG I'M GOING TO JAIL**\n\n\nThankfully he laughed, and they continued to ask me some basic questions. Where I lived, if I played football, etc. Eventually they decide to cuff me and take me in.\n\n\nBut then some idiot took one for the team.\n\nC's Radio: All available units, we have a call saying shots fired at XYZ Apartments, blah blah LE lingo.\n\nI look at C1.\n\nC1 looks at me.\n\nC2 looks at C1.\n\n\nMe: Shots fired?\n\nC1: Today's your lucky day, kid. Get the fuck outta here.\n\n\nI ran. And I ran fast. And I ran too fast, because I was running between houses and tripped over a water meter, busting up my knee. But I kept going. I got into the house looking like a bag of ass, but I didn't end up in jail.\n\n\nTL;DR - Was going to drunk drive to pick up some booty, cops stop me before I get to the truck and start the process of taking me in, but some redneck idiot saved the day by shooting cans in an apartment parking lot.",

        "text": "I was working in an area where impatient people like to bypass traffic on the shoulder, specifically looking for this violation. And it only took about five seconds for me to find someone doing it.\n\nI pulled the driver over and greeted her, \"Good morning, ma'am. The reason I stopped you is for driving on the right shoulder.\" She kind of shrugged sheepishly and said,\"....sorry?\" \n\nI saw she had a reasonably large dog in the back seat. I always like to greet dogs when I make traffic stops so the dog knows I'm cool and we don't have any problems. I find this especially true since dogs read their owner's emotions, and most people are nervous when stopped by the police. I presented my hand through the rolled down back windows, let the dog sniff it, then gave it a little pat. Good dog. The driver told me she was taking her dog to the vet for a check-up.\n\nI got the driver's information and walked back to my car to write the ticket. As I reached my car, I looked back towards the driver's car and saw her out of the driver's seat, running back towards the rear of her car. I reached for my gun, as I'm about to tell her to get back in her car.\n\nShe pointed towards the front of her car and yelled to me, \"My dog!\" Oh, crap. I looked beyond her car and saw the dog charging down the freeway shoulder, away from us. Decision time.\n\nI knew I could run faster than the girl, but I also knew I couldn't run faster than the dog. There was also lots of traffic going by us at roughly 50 miles per hour that was a risk to everybody involved. There was also the risk that the dog would run faster away from me even if I caught up to it, and possibly be more likely to come to her instead.\n\nI made my choice. I jumped back into my car and stopped the freeway as safely and quickly as I could. The girl was able to grab the dog, and she tried walking it back, but it didn't have a collar and she didn't have a leash. I watched as she just stopped, trying to figure out how to get the dog back to her car, 100 feet back.\n\nI got out of my car, freeway still blocked, and jogged over to her. Police always need to be in shape in case we get into a fight. It's more often I need to be in shape for ridiculous things like this. I picked the dog up, and fireman-carried it back to her car.\n\nThe dog and driver got back in the car, with the windows rolled up. I walked back up to her, \"You're receiving a ticket for driving on the right shoulder.\" I figure she needed proof that this actually happened.",

        "text": "We've got a guy in our office we refer to as the Super Trooper. He's a former drill sergeant from the military, who generally does a lot of things on his own that most Troopers would normally call for a second unit. Through his mere presence, he gets it all done without incident.\n\nI was rolling out for shift from our office while he was heading back in. He went over the radio, \"Unit 1 to Dispatch, show me out with a pedestrian passed out on the sidewalk in front of the office.\" I drove over to help.\n\nWe exited our cars and put some medical gloves on. The passed out guy appeared to be homeless, and had a bottle of Vodka next to him. Super Trooper went up to him, \"Hey, wake up.\" No response. \"Hey buddy, time to wake up.\" Nothing. He tried Drill Instructor mode, **\"YOU CAN'T SLEEP ON THE SIDEWALK, WAKE UP!\"** Not even a flinch. \"Unit 1 to Dispatch, start an ambulance.\" \n\nThat immediate medical request surprised me since it seemed like we still had some more options. I walked up to the guy, and kneeled next to him while Super Trooper watched me. We've received training on how to knock people out, and part of that training included what happens when they wake up. Unconscious people don't realize they were knocked out, so they'll typically wake up fighting. We also had medical training on how to try to revive unconscious people. I incorporated both of those.\n\nI put my knuckle on the guy's chest, gave a good sternum rub, and then immediately jumped back. His eyes shot open and he jumped up like a rocket. Super Trooper commented, \"Whoaaa, watch out!\"\n\nPassed out guy was now drunk guy, as he almost fell over after jumping up. Drunk guy commented, \"Whadoyouwan?\" Pretty drunk.\n\nSuper Trooper updated dispatch. \"Unit 1, cancel the ambulance.\" Then he replied, \"You were passed out on the sidewalk. You can't be sleeping here in the middle of the day.\"\n\nDrunk guy was being drunk. \"Maaan, I ain't breakin no laaawss.\"\n\n\"You've got an open container of vodka right here. I'm going to dump this out, and you're going to head home. Where do you live?\"\n\n\"Rite ovar der.\" Drunk guy pointed towards a homeless camp and started walking. We watched as he walked (mostly) straight in the direction he pointed.\n\nSuper Trooper came up to me. \"Sternum rub, huh? I gotta remember that.\"\n\nIn the weeks following that, Super Trooper came up to me in the office. \"I gotta tell you, early in your career I wasn't too sure about you. But all the things you've been doing, that's some solid work. I've gained a lot of respect for you.\" I ended up backing up Super Trooper a lot of times after that.\n",

        "text": "I was just commenting on an AskReddit post and remembered this story. Thought it would be fun to share.\n\nBack when I was 20 and still in college, I was working relatively long hours and had a habit of falling asleep in my best friend's dorm room. I'd wake up between midnight and 3:00AM, shake myself awake, and then drive my car a half mile back my dorm room.\n\nOne one such night at about 2430, I got in my vehicle and started driving back home. It wasn't a long drive and I hadn't put my seatbelt on yet. I stopped at a three-way intersection and saw a campus police vehicle sitting there as well. In a panic, I put my seatbelt on, waited until I saw the officer wave me along, and then drove forward. The vehicle pulled out behind me.\n\n\"Shit,\" I muttered under my breath, thinking they were going to pull me over for the seatbelt. But, they didn't pull me over. I continued on, driving exactly the speed limit (15 MPH), stopping for 5 Mississippis at every stop sign, and using my turn signals, figuring that the officer was trying to see if I'd do anything else wrong before they pulled me over.\n\nThey followed me, almost in my back seat, as I drove home. I pulled in to a parking spot (after signaling with my blinkers) and the vehicle swerved in and blocked me into my spot.\n\n*Motherfucker!* I thought, incredulous that this was over a seatbelt while driving on an empty university street. Still, they hadn't turned on their lights and there was no clear indication that I was being stopped. I waited for a minute or two and nobody approached my window. I decided to get out of my vehicle.\n\nAs I did, two officers got out of their vehicle- a female officer, who stood behind and shined a flashlight in my eyes and a rather short little guy with a ball cap, a goatee, and, I shit you not, [sunglasses on at night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2LTL8KgKv8). With my hands clearly visible, I walked toward them and asked what was going on. \n\n_____\n\nShorty comes up to me fast and pushed me up against my vehicle. By this point, it's 2445 and I'm exhausted. I just want to go to bed and a fucking school cop just put hands on me without even issuing a verbal command.\n\nHe's a solid four inches shorter than me, but he's standing so close I can't help but lean over him.\n\n\"How much have you been drinking tonight, bro?\" He spits at me with condescension in his voice. I blink and process his words. *Drinking?*\n\nI was an exceptionally boring 20 year old- I hadn't ever had a beer, much less been drunk. Incredulously, I said, \"Uhh, I haven't been drinking.\"\n\n\"Don't lie to me bro, I know you've been drinking. How much have you had, bro?\" [I'm not embellishing with the 'Bros'. He literally sounded like PC Principal from South Park].\n\n\"I haven't had anything to drink\" I said again, this time a little bit annoyed. \"I'm really tired. I just want to go to bed.\"\n\n\"You can't be drinking and driving, bro.\"\n\n\"I haven't been drinking. I've been at work. I'm tired. I want to go to bed.\" Shorty is still in the phonebox with me and my back is up against the rear hatch of my Rav4.\n\n\"You were driving like you were drunk. We know that you've been drinking.\" At this point, I get pissed. I *know* that my driving was perfectly fine, despite me being tired. I snap a little bit.\n\n\"I haven't had *anything* to drink. I'm tired. I want to go to bed. I have class in the morning. I don't give a fuck, do a field sobriety test, breathalyze me, hell, take a blood sample if you want, I consent to a search. I just want to get this over with so I can go to bed.\" I look him in the eye and scowl. He steps back.\n\n\"You don't have to get so aggressive, bro, we're just looking out for you.\"\n\n\"Then either do a field sobriety test or let me go to bed and stop harassing me. Do I need to call your supervisor?\" I glare at Shorty and backs up again.\n\n\"No,\" he says, a little more subdued. \"Just go to bed. Don't drive when you're tired.\"\n\n*Asshat*, I think as I lock my car and walk up to my dorm.\n\nI considered calling his supervisor, but with it just being his word against mine, I ended up not bothering. Still, it troubled me how the officer was convinced of my guilt without doing anything to prove it. After talking with other students, I learned that he had done this before- one had even been suspended because for marijuana usage- evidence being his red eyes (which were actually from allergies [kid was a straight edge health nut athlete who only drank weak tea and liked to run]). \n\nHis attempt to bully me didn't work, but who knows how many other kids have gotten that treatment from him.

        "text": "I was working at my favorite speed enforcement spot, when I watched a black sports car fly by in the slow lane, doing 90mph in a 65. The fact that he was in the slow lane, passing traffic, also told me he was putting some effort into speeding. Off I went.\n\nWhile catching up, I watched him take exit-only lanes to pass more traffic, make plenty of unsafe lane changes, saw he didn't have any license plates, and had illegally tinted windows. This was a ticket goldmine, and possibly a pursuit waiting to happen. (Refer to an old story about why I don't bother with reckless driving charges anymore).\n\nI pulled in behind him, turned my lights on, and he yielded right away. Darn.\n\n\"Good afternoon, sir. I stopped you for a bunch of reasons. Your speed, unsafe lane changes, passing in exit lanes, no license plates, and front window tint. Let's start with your driver's license.\"\n\nHe handed me a license out of Virginia, which is not the state I work in. I asked him if he still lived there, and he said he did, but frequently visits my state for work. Something I really love about Virginia is how crazy strict their driving laws are. 20mph over the limit can get you jail time.\n\nHe provided the paperwork for the car, showing he just bought it, which is why there weren't any license plates. He stated he didn't realize he was driving that fast, which is a common lie.\n\nHis driving record was pretty clean, and he was polite, and pulled over immediately instead of making me work for it. I walked back up with his ticket, \"Sir, you're getting a ticket for your speed, 90 in a 65.\"\n\n\"Can't you cut me a break?\"\n\n\"I just cut you three breaks. You're from Virginia. You know if you got caught doing this in Virginia, it'd be a trip to jail.\"\n\n\"Yeah, you know that's right. I appreciate it.\" He got his ticket and was on his way.\n\nFast forward two hours. I spotted the same car on another freeway, driven by the same guy. It was pretty identifiable since I had never (and have never) seen another car of that make and model. When I saw him, he was cruising with the flow of traffic, being a good driver.\n\nI pulled alongside him. He recognized me and waved. I waved back, and continued on.",
