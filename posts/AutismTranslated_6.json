        "text": "I've spent months doing research, taking tests, and going back and forth on whether or not I actually have ASD. I've talked to my therapist and psychiatric APRN about it, but neither of them will give me an opinion because I also have severe anxiety and agoraphobia (have since I was a toddler), possible OCD and possible ADHD. so basically I'm too complicated a case for them to pick out what my symptoms and experiences mean and tell me I need to get a neuropsychological assessment for a true answer. Which I understand. \n\nThe problem is, like I mentioned, I have severe agoraphobia. Like I'm pretty much housebound at this point. It's something that I'm working on in therapy and everything but it's gonna be a long time before I feel comfortable getting somewhere that I can get an in person assessment. I've found places that say they can do them telehealth but they all cost between $600 - $1800, and I only have like five bucks to my name lol. Plus even if I did find the money I get worried about spending that much on something in case they tell me that I just have anxiety or something.\n\nThe thing is that I get confused because all the scores on the self assessments that I take seem borderline, especially for people with comorbidities. Like the RAADS-R I get about 100, ASQ I usually get like a 31, the aspie test I get \"you have both neurotypical and autism traits\".\n\nAnd I know people will say that the label doesn't necessarily matter and I know that but for me I just really need that piece of mind. I have two autistic siblings and I really hate the idea of claiming I struggle with something that they struggle with when I actually don't. And they do tend to have more issues with meltdowns/shutdowns and sensory sensitivity which, I don't really. Granted I have a few things that bother me sensory wise but more when I was younger than now. Same with things like meltdowns. I'm not gonna go into listing what I do and don't experience because this is already too long and I've done that before in other posts. But its just really confusing sometimes. \n\nI just wish someone would be able to give me an opinion and I wasn't such a complicated case.",

        "text": "Hi guys. I am autistic and recently, I've had a really bad miscommunication which involved a large group of other people who are connected through social media. \n\nI said something unintentional but hurtful to someone, and later on, I tried to apologize to this person, let's call her person A. Person A ended up cyberbullying me after this, and said some really deeply hurtful things. I tried to apologize to her multiple times. I think she was still really upset. She ended up stalking me and lying to me online. I've asked multiple friends about this situation and they have told me that they do think this person's response was disproportionate to what I said. I ended up doing things this person told me to do which ended up hurting other people's feelings, and I feel awful.  \n\nUnfortunately this isn't the first time I've found myself in a relationship with a harmful person, and I think probably in general, autistic people are more likely to not be able to recognize when people might have bad intentions. Now, months later, I feel terrible about what's happened and I have no idea how to try to make things right with the other people. Does anyone have any tips on navigating miscommunication with a large group of people? I feel really lost and like no matter what I do, I'm going to cause more hurt, and it's a terrible feeling, as none of this was intended. At the time, I thought the person who was lying to me cared about me and about other people, but now I see, they just wanted to hurt me and other people. I think social media is a factor which changes things too. I don't want other people to feel like I'm just out for my reputation or giving a \"notes app apology\" like celebrities do. :(",

        "text": "I don't know if this could be some comorbidity that's similar but maybe not the same as PTSD, but I have noticed for a while that certain events have created an extra hypervigilance for me that I spend time fighting against. I have heard that more things are traumatic or us? The response seems at least somewhat disproportionate on my part. Here are some examples:\n\n1. There was a drive-by shooting in front of my house. Neither I nor anybody I knew got shot. I didn't even see any of it happen. I was woken up by the sound and then went outside and saw a bunch of cop cars and neighbors coming out. The victim and perpetrator were hidden from view by the time I got outside. Ever since then, every time a car passes by, whether I am at home or not, I have a moment of worry that someone in the car is going to roll down the window and shoot me or anyone with me. Ditto for people just walking by me minding their own business. I also have to force myself to let one of my dogs sleep by the window because I go through vivid, intrusive visualizations of her being gunned down from outside.\n2. A dog got hit by a car in front of my house and didn't survive. This was also something I didn't actually watch. By the time I got outside, someone had put a cloth over the dog. I heard some people outside my house and went outside. The kid walking the dog was screaming. A crowd had gathered around the whole scene. I immediately had to go back inside for some reason and completely withdraw. I'm sure I looked like a turd. I now constantly imagine different ways my dogs could all get steamrolled by different vehicles, down to the last auditory detail of how my mom would cry about it.\n3. A few people in my family have died super abruptly in their 40s. I have never witnessed any of the events. I spend a lot of time thinking about how people I'm close to can just simply not wake up tomorrow without warning and sometimes stare at them breathing for minutes while they sleep. The same thought process happens whenever someone goes to the grocery store without me.",

She's fine with sarcasm, idioms, body language, tone, personal space, etc.\n\nInsofar as we're aware - I'm probably on the spectrum, myself, so we might both be missing the cues!\n\nBecause of not having major issues with social understanding, she is worried about going through with the assessment because of how important a diagnostic criteria this seems to be.  Yes, she has problems in social situations, but this is due to anxiety as opposed to misunderstanding or poor proprioception.  When it's just her and I together, she does not have any social deficits to speak of.  \n\nNotwithstanding, she's almost certain she's autistic (I agree with her) and is keen for this to be validated, but we're both afraid that a negative outcome to the assessment would be detrimental to her self-esteem and mental health.\n\nThat puts her in a catch-22 situation, and we were wondering if anyone here has been stuck in this mental space before and can offer any advice or reassurance.\n\nThanks a bunch!",

I didn't know how to approach my parents about it, and so I decided to make a powerpoint presentation about what autism is and what traits I have with it. I also started to look for psychologists who have experience with adults and accept my insurance. I found ONE psychology center in the entire state that both does adults and is in network with my insurance provider. I couldn't finish filling out the intake form until I got milestone data about myself (first words, first walk, etc.) from my parents. Well, last night, I finally gave them the presentation (it was an hour long) and was able to finish the intake form! I now have a date on March 29th! Ahhhhhh! This was all really hard for me because one of my executive functioning struggles is with initiation of tasks, and its really hard for me to start things (even things I'm very interested in), and I would have to force myself to work on the presentation every few days. \nMy mom said that she has wondered in the past if I was autistic, and agrees that based on the info I gave her she agrees that I am. I also needed a second opinion from someone close to me to accompany me to the assessment so they can ask them about my behavior, and mom said that she would take the day off and go with me! Dad didn't seem to agree or disagree about if I have it (which is actually quite good from him for not immediately dismissing me) but seemed to think that a lot of the traits I mentioned were things everyone did (guess who I inherited it from). \n\nAnyways, I'm really proud of myself and I'm so happy that I was able to do it and that I was able to find a date only three months away, rather than two years like I hear a lot of horror stories about online. I'll make another post after the assessment with my results. Good luck to the other people out there who are also on this journey! &lt;3",

I used a stroller on a regular basis until I was 7-8 years old when we were in our hometown and on vacation. One time I went on a solo trip with my dad to a nearby city my dad brought the stroller and I was 9 years old and I remember we used it when I wanted to go to an arcade that was a 25 minute walk away and on my way back I fell asleep.",

I used to collapse with no warning, often when I was playing hard or there was a gathering of people (twice at Birthday parties). I was mostly unresponsive for several minutes until I would ‘come to’. I don’t remember them happening but I do recall when I would wake up.

It hasn’t happened since and I’ve not ever come across any literature that describes pseudo-seizures.\n\nIs this a thing? Does anyone experience similar?",

Love you all, here for you:  \n\n\nWe might not see things eye to eye with everyone, but I wanted to share the following.I am a male, 32, and autistic. I wanted everyone (especially women) to know what my life is like when I try to date specifically.  \nI spend A LOT of time looking for love, may hours every day online, on tinder, snapchat, instagram, okcupid, Facebook, reddit, discord and many more places.   \nI got banned from many places, spent huge amounts of time and money (which I don’t have as I am an evil patriarch and deserve no love or respect in this society and am pretty much the very reason the world is the nasty place it is.  \nAnd yet... I can’t really function properly anyhow, no job and such.   \nI also spent the many years trying to be ALL I could for the women I love, them accepting all I had to offer, even my heart but totally unable or unwilling to give back.I know that men have a shorter life-expectancy, that it is okay for me to do very heavy and physical work and that if ever I was in dire straights financially and nearly homeless for a while (as has been the case on and off for years) I have no one I could rely on.  \nAll the while, I am treated as if I (personally) was the oppressor of women, of their sexuality, of their freedom and choices, while I wrote to tens of thousands online, sometimes through sleepless nights, dealing with absolute and utter reciprocity, most of the time.At the same time.  \nI get that most women’s inboxes must be full and then some of messages of other men just as desperate as I am, with whom I am in a struggle to the death for the nice-looking love of these profiles that spike dopamine but that remind us of how really lonely we all are behind the mask.The lack of sensitivity I now display for having been hardened by disillusion over years makes me all the more want to extend my appreciation to women and anyone struggling out there.   \nI know we all have our struggles.  \n\n\nTimes are changing indeed and though there probably is still a lot more to write here, that’s all I can come up with for now. I haven’t had real sex in many years, and a regular relationship since around 2010.   \n\n\nLove to anyone reading. Please know that I care. :)",

By then my frustration over not being heard in my, very real, health care concerns, had build till a point were I could no longer stay in class, was roaming the hallways and sitting on the floor of outpatient clinic reception, waiting for the doctor to see me, once again, trying to explain that I needed some help to manage my neurological dispositions.\n\nSo.

So everyone suppresses their body, needs, autonomy, spontaneity, emotions, etc  to fit into preconceived boxes that are completely arbitrary in the first place.\n\nEveryone passively accepting nonsense hierarchies where basically everyone except a fully abled, white, hyperproductive, confident, heterosexual, etc. man is seen as a subhuman. It's like we collect identities and make a sum at the end to see how human we are. Then you get bursts of social movements when people for a fleeting moment realize they can voice the injustice.

I'm really sorry.\n\nI posted something similar in the big reddit for autism but that maybe here I can find some other advice?\n\nSo, It's been almost 3 months since I started my research on autism, since I formed a hypothesis that I might be autistic, since my few close friends have told me that it is a strong possibility, and since then I felt that it might give it a chance and do research. Mainly because I saw the symptoms of the DSM-5 and I felt identified with several things, but somewhat doubtful with others since I did not understand if some symptoms were referring to something other than my personal experiences.\n\nI became too obsessed with the subject, studied autism to exhaustion and did multiple tests on the \"Embrace Autism\" website (which I feel is one of the few websites I trust to learn about autism), and all the results pointed strongly to possible autism present. I made a list of the symptoms I was sure were describing my life and the ones who I wasn't so sure, I also made list of situations through my hole life that were strange and might be related to autism (currently there's 54 situations I got in the list)\n\nI would be lying if I said I wasn't a little bit convinced I was autistic \n\nSo, with all that in mind, before taking any tests at the psychiatrist, I felt that confirmation from my psychologist was necessary, not obligatory, but I felt the need of validation from a person who knows more than me. So I brought the subject a couple of times during our sessions and she never told me her opinion about it (I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing)... and I got kind of (very) impatient, since I am going through some stress of needing a definitive answer.\n\nFinally, in the most recent session, I told her (my psychologist) that I wanted to know her opinion on the subject, since I am afraid to talk to my parents about the possibility that I might be autistic without having her support and confirmation, to which she replied: \"I don't think that you are autistic, you do not present any symptoms in my opinion, but we can continue working on this if you want\".\n\nI felt like crying, I'm not going to lie, I'm aware that she told me that she's open to continue listening to me, but I don't know, I feel like everything collapsed inside me. \n\nAfter the session ended, I didn't speak for the rest of the day, I felt empty and very lost, I don't know who I am and I have an abysmal fear of being wrong, that maybe I'm doing this for attention, or my symptoms could be due to other reasons that I'm not aware of, or maybe I'm lying to myself and all this is fake, I don't know. Right now I just feel a total emptiness that is indescribable.\n\nI might be exaggerating, I really don't know, I just feel like I'm in the middle of a crisis and I don't know how to get out of it.\n\nThanks if you read this far and I hope I'm not breaking any rules on this reddit with this post. If there are people who feel identified with this or have advice, please let me know. See ya!",

        "text": "ABA is abuse. It doesn't exist to \"help\" autistic people. It exists to erase us. To control us. To alter us. All to make life easier for NT people. It destroys one's sense of self. It leads to CPTSD in at least half those who are subjected to it.\n\nThis has been shown in a study by H Kupferstein (2018) and is backed up by the testimonies of tens of thousands of victims of ABA. Further studies by Gorycki, Ruppel, and Zane (2021) have shown that ABA is not an effective \"therapy\" whatsoever.\n\nThe study found it to be junk science and that ABA is \"tantamount to torture and violates the most basic requirement of any therapy, to do no harm\". It's \"technicians\" are not trained to work with autistic people, simply ABUSING us for profit.\n\nThe great irony, of course, being that ABA is the only available \"support\" given in many countries. The Autism Industrial Complex is real. The entire industry (and it is an industry) exists only to use autistic bodies to extract profit for a select few.\n\nI am a victim of ABA. Every day I need to live with the aftershocks of years of enduring it. It makes autistic people feel small, trains us to not advocate for ourselves, to deny our bodies &amp; minds, to deny our  sense of self. It causes CPTSD and it takes a lifetime to unlearn.\n\nIf you want to support autistic people, do not ask us why we think ABA is bad. Don't send us articles about why we are wrong. Don't talk about \"severe autism\". Abuse is abuse. ABA is a fake money making operation that turns autistic people's bodies into commodities.\n\nI recently spoke about my experiences going thru ABA  which you can listen to here. [https://www.theautisticcoach.com/autism-blog/my-appearance-on-the-autism-stories-podcast](https://www.theautisticcoach.com/autism-blog/my-appearance-on-the-autism-stories-podcast)\n\nWhen those of us who have undergone it speak of abuse, of torture, of trauma, BELIEVE US. Don't challenge us. It's violent. If you aren't autistic and haven't gone thru it, don't speak over us. If you have gone thru it and defend it, do some soul searching. That \"it's the only thing that helps\" doesn't make it unabusive.",

Among closing my eyes a wave of buzzing surrounded and consumed me (no 8 yo me was not doing any drugs). Reading astral projection reports reminded me of this feeling but for the longest time I was fixated on what I saw. As the title says I have terrible internal imagery skills the most my mind could do was make a rough shape of what I was thinking about. This was like comparing the first photograph to what we have now. I saw a plain wooden chair in a white field. I remember it being so clear. Normally I cannot interact with the few things I can in again but this night I was as if I was getting closer to the chair or it itself was growing. And then it would begin to shrink but it wouldn’t change size, like I was chasing it as it got smaller or running from it as it got bigger. It was just isolating between that. But before falling asleep I remember seeing the grain so clearly. \n\nEver since then stuff like that would happen even with my eyes open.  Sometime on a walk something will catch my eye and it’ll “change”. My most recent one was when my father came into my room. He was like 5 ft away from me but I got that buzzing feeling and suddenly I could see nothing but his face and every hair and every pore on it. Stress may cause this or just be a symptom of asd, I’ve always thought about this a lot but could never find the words or really identify what this is I hadn’t heard anyone else talk about it. \nIf anyone else experienced this it would be great for my mental health",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismTranslated/comments/10dqb4y/currently_at_a_psych_ward_and_feeling_very_not/",
        "text": "First let me add some info / answer some question that would definitely  be asked. I'm in Norway, and the type of psych ward I'm in isn't as  strict as what I think most of you would think of when mentioning the  words psych ward. I'm allowed electronics, cords, cigarettes, freedom to  do most of what I wanna do, basically anything except weapons, alcohol  and drugs (prescription drugs to be administered by workers). It's not a  psych ward for those who are actively trying to, well, seriously harm  themselves. It's more for those who are struggling quite bad but not at  risk of doing the bad thing. We do have some psych wards for those that  are more strict. Oh and also, we have no roommates. Now that we have  that out of the way...  \n\n\nToday kinda sucks. I've been here for 5  days. The first days were kind of filled with mental adrenaline. While  sort of scared, I was so busy with both activities and just being  curious about the whole place that I didn't have time to feel that much  in terms of my mental health. Today however I've been by myself almost  the whole day. Aside from meals and a small activity (where I got a bit  more attention than I anticipated) I've been in my room listening to  music. I'm just not feeling it today. It's hard being at a psych ward  (despite how much freedom I have, there's a reason I'm here). It's even  harder being at a psych ward when you're autistic.   \n\n\nI just can't  find the will to live today. I just wanna lay in bed listening to music  loudly and not do anything. I have a lot on my heart, but I find it hard  to talk to the workers here yet. I honestly feel like no matter what  someone says or does, I can never be fixed. Not talking autism, I'm  talking general mental health - I'm not gonna \"fix\" my autism. I hate  going through the days not having anything to do (which is my usual  day-to-day life outside the ward), but I'm unable to work, and I don't  see myself able to do it either.   \n\n\nI feel like a bother with  everything I do here. I hate when people look at me. I hate asking for  something. I hate when I feel sad because I feel like I don't deserve to  be sad when I could've had it worse. I also don't feel like I don't  deserve to be here at all because I'm not sad 24/7, though idk why I  feel like that's a problem. I have this mindset of \"someone has it worse  than me and I'm taking their place\". This ward even has several open  spots, I shouldn't feel this way, but I do. Whatever I do I feel some  kind of guilt over it.   \n\n\nMy contact today (we get different  workers from shift to shift) has been checking in on me 4 times. It's  the first day I'm isolating myself a lot and showing that I'm  struggling, and she wants me to talk to her, but I'm just unable. I  can't put my feelings into words. I've heard the \"show them this post\"  thing in many situations, and no, I'm sorry, I just can't make myself do  that. I hate showing myself being vulnerable.   \n\n\nI also really  really hate when people see my  mood swings. I hate that I'm okay one  day and terrible the next. I hate when people I laughed with one day  sees me cry the next. I know that's more or less normal for human  beings, but I can't stand it. I feel like the same person has to see me  in the same mood everytime they see me. They can only see one side of  me. Mom only sees the happy and goofy side of me, dad only sees the  neutral and annoyed side of me (i have my reasons), I feel like I have  one personality per person, and that's the only way that feels correct  to me. I want to hide my struggles instead of being sad and vulnerable  with someone that has seen me smile. Stupid I know.  \n\n\nI honestly  just feel like being alone for the longest time. I actually made a bit  of a friend here my first day, and we spent the first evenings in one of  the TV rooms together, spread out on one sofa each. After I was gone  for some hours yesterday (visited my mom) I came back to see another  person in my sofa, with my friend. They also went out to the local  shopping centre together today. Now I don't feel like going to our  little TV room anymore. I don't like hanging with more than one person  at a time, and I really hate when things change. That sofa was my comfy  spot, and it feels wrong to sit anywhere else in that room. I don't  wanna go there, see that it's taken, and then turn around. Obviously I  know she's allowed to sit wherever she want, and I don't want her to  feel like she's in my spot, so I rather just don't go there at all.  \nWhile  typing this, my contact just came to check on me a 5th time. I still  don't feel like talking, I still can't put my thoughts into spoken  words. This post stays between me and this subreddit.  \n\n\nI just had  to pour this out here. I don't know what I want from this. Maybe someone  understands me. Sorry that this post is incredibly messy, I don't have  the energy to do anything with it.  \nQuestions welcome, but I can't promise I have the energy to answer them (yet).  \n\n\nMaybe controversial here, but I would do anything for a hug right now. Except ask anyone to give me a hug.",

I’ve heard of allistics getting that feeling from autistic people and it makes me wonder if that’s why, because when masking we’re mimicking them but getting small imperceptible things wrong that they pick up on but can’t place? And because I did the same with her (her stimming motions and echololia are close but something about them just seems off to me that I can’t quite place but I can’t imagine me or any of my also autistic friends doing them quite like that and there are scenes where it’s all I can focus on because something about them just feels wrong)\n\nI looked it up just to double check and the actress is in fact allistic and this line of thinking just made me curious 😅 I don’t know if there’s actually anything there or I’m overthinking it but was wondering if anyone else felt the same way or had noticed something similar with other shows perhaps \n\nMost other shows I watched with autistic characters or characters implied to be autistic played by allistics it  felt more like they just had a neon sign strapped to their head reading “I am allistic” the only other show and character I’ve had a similar experience was abed in community, although he seemed to stim a lot less and their was fewer moments where the stimming stood out to me as being off (they were still present but it was rare, although I do pay less attention watching community since it’s English so I can multitask while watching it) \n\nNot that allistics don’t stim but something about the process of them seeming to decide to or needing to seemed like it wasn’t being approached the way someone with autism would I really don’t know how to explain it past that other than this weird gut feeling",

        "text": "Hi! \n\nSorry to bother, for the length of this post, and if anything is written poorly; I had basically a couple question but wanted to get a feel of if I sound like I meet the criteria / experiences you all have had for autism before asking anything further. I am AFAB 28. I am undiagnosed for autism, but I am self-suspecting, so I wanted to reach out and ask if this sounds like or relates to any of your experiences with autism.\n\nI have gone through for the past 6+ months researching autism daily for normally for a significant amount of hours a day whenever I have the ability to do so, as well as some other topics to help eliminate the potential for other disorders, and these are some of the characteristics I relate to that during my research has lead me to feeling like there is a likelihood I have it based on the DSM5; however, since these are the criteria and not necessary exampled experiences, I wanted to see if these fit the criteria stated / sounds like any of your experiences or if I am way off on how I am interpreting these items:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **A1 Criteria**\n   * *Abnormal social approach*\n      * Utilizes scripts to have conversations with others;  consistently talking to myself in my head or preparing conversations ahead of time to try to plan out what to say in different situations\n      * Can be told I sometimes talk at someone, rather than including them in the conversation. More of a sharing a lot of information.        \n   * *Difficulty in initiating or sustaining a conversation*\n      * Unless comfortable with the individuals, normally have a difficult time having more than a response or two with conversation unless it has to do with work or something not small talky\n   * *Atypical conversational style*\n      * Unless very comfortable with the individuals, very passive in communication; i.e. even with in-laws, have a tendency for them to ask my husband and I questions, but not the other way around or wait for individuals to bring up topics as I don’t always understand what topics are forbidden or uninteresting to most and normally have a        tendency to talk about those, so I usually wait on others to initiate to know what is safe to talk about\n   * *Poor pragmatic / social use of language*\n      * Told frequently I “speak in my head” where I think I gave full context of what was going on, but it is extremely unclear to others and I feel like they should know, but I am told I didn’t clarify well enough or never actually said what I thought was clear or actually did say.\n   * *Does not usually talk to be friendly or social*\n      * Not the case as much if I know someone well (i.e. family); however, trying to work on this some. Most of the time, I focus like if at work only on work related topics, but have a hard time asking about others interests, hobbies, etc. Only really focus on the topic at hand / what we need to do.\n   * *Reduced spontaneous sharing of objects, possessions, or food*\n      * I don’t know really with this; but I do know like for example I will get in trouble with responses when someone shows interest in something I got (i.e. sister says she I guess “jokes” she wants to steal the sweatshirt I got from Christmas while opening, and I say no. I had picked it out and got it for Christmas, but that was not the proper        way to respond)\n   * *Reduced spontaneous sharing of own interests*\n      * Don’t know what people want to know, so I don’t really share anything without being prompted to. Most of my interests are anime, Pokemon, and Dateline, so I don’t necessarily share most of that since most of the people I know don’t really care about those. \n   * *Reduced spontaneous sharing of emotions or affect*\n      * I think I can share in the “emotions” of others as long as I know what it is supposed to be; i.e. if someone cheated on them, oh no how dare the other person, or someone gets engaged or a promotion can show congrats! Excited for you! If someone dies, oh no! I am sorry for your loss. Things that I can have scripted basically as potential scenarios, or kind of repeat what they are saying, can copy that even if  I don’t get it 100%.\n      * But I do not really share so much how I am doing unless I am extreme in emotion and can't hold it back (mostly because I would say I don’t really know how I am feeling in general unless it is extreme, and don’t really feel the need to share how I am doing unless required to).\n   * *Does not usually respond appropriately to others’ emotions*\n      * If its something scripted, like above, that I have read about or have seen before and come up with scenarios, I can manage this. I have a difficult time though in situations like when I piss someone off or do something wrong to know what I am supposed to do to help with it (i.e. others will sometimes help walk me through what I am supposed to do – go take the other person and talk with them in the other room, and say XYZ to help calm them down, explain their emotions to me, etc).  \n\n* **A2 Criteria**\n   * *Poor / abnormal eye contact*\n      * Have been told before that my eye contact can be extreme one way or the other; either I am not looking enough or overcompensating and staring at the other person (to the point in college, I was told I was sending signals to people that I was “flirting” or something with them because I was staring at them and listening to        what they had to say? Learned while in theatre (took it for 8 years) that was the appropriate way to show you were listening with body language (facing the person, looking at them, etc).\n   * *Poor integration of eye-gaze, facial expressions, and gestures*\n      * Have been told that my emotions sometimes do not match the conversation or that I am looking improperly (potentially being told your rolling your eyes, seeming like ugh’ed, when I was really just looking around the area)\n   * *Abnormal body positions during social interactions*\n      * Definitely have a tendency to move away from people (although may still be facing them since I know that is something to show you are paying attention to others), but I don’t normally like to be close to anyone when talking with them\n   * *Difficulty interpreting / understanding nonverbal cues from others*\n      * Can’t tell well when people are not interested, which is why I normally let others take control of the conversation. Difficult when my mom and I talk though because we can ramble on and on about stuff and other people will get frustrated with us for not stopping if at a restaurant, home, etc.\n   * *Speech abnormalities*\n      * Get yelled at all the time for being too loud for everyone else (think this is because I constantly hear everything, so the only way I can hear myself is by being loud enough). Also helps me since I don’t know when to always enter conversations, by being loud, I can normally speak then. I have people who (at work, home, etc) tell me I have to be quiet because I am being too loud – to the point in an over 10000+ sq ft space, my manager could hear me across the full area. \n   * *Limited understanding of tone of voice*\n      * Have many situations where people will say things sarcastically, but I take them literally. My family most of the time will tell me that it’s a joke if they are joking, but I normally try to infer if it seems wild that it’s a joke at this point, but still have issues with things like “oh “brother’s name” you would look great in that jacket and be the only guy at work wearing it\" and I will then comment things like of course he would, that’s a woman’s jacket which was the point of the joke...  \n \n* **A3 Criteria**\n   * *Limited interest in socializing with same-aged peers*\n      * Currently in social situations, honestly prefer hanging out with people’s kids more than the adults (i.e. husband’s 8 year old cousin comes, and will discuss Pokemon and video games, or what shows he’s watching, etc) much easier than I can with others\n   * *Difficulty making friends or maintaining existing friendships*\n      * Other than my husband and family, honestly only have 1 friend (who I would consider my best friend), but we only hang out a few times during the year and maybe text a couple times every 4-6 months or so; have an issue and feel guilty about the lack of messaging, calling, etc. I do for others, but I have a hard time knowing what to say or do, so I just honestly do not normally do anything, let alone really remembering they exist unless something comes        up or they message me.\n   * *Poor understanding of social relationships*\n      * Hate to say it since I know it is probably not appropriate, but I do believe that relationships are transactional, so if I am doing something, it is normally to help someone who has done something for me, etc to make sure things are even. \n   * *Limited ability to work or play collaboratively with others*\n      * I am known for being extremely controlling with work (i.e. need things to be perfect in this exact way, space, etc) but passive in relationships with people on the play side of things, except for my husband who I am hate to say it, more on the controlling side for what we do, how much we spend, etc. as he is more passive with most things that aren’t big and he knows how particular I can be and how little things being wrong can ruin my whole day.\n   * *Unaware of social conventions/appropriate behavior*\n      * I know I have this, but hard to describe because if I knew the rules I would follow them, I just do not know all of them. Things like comparing my sister to a dog because she’s loyal and stuff  gets told to me as not appropriate to say, etc or not swearing in public situations (try not to with this but sometimes it slips out).\n   * *Social naivete*\n      * Have been told since I was young, I was super gullible. Have a tendency to take things literally, and therefore believe what people have to say and can’t see the signs of lying. Normally, logic if it is off I can normally use to try to avoid issues with this (so I know things like not to click on links for potential phishing emails, don’t trust the spam calls, someone says one things and then something that contradicts it, that’s a red flag).\n   * *Mentalizing difficulties*\n      * Cannot tell until much too late on this and never know what started it if something went wrong. If someone says I am XYZ, got it. Or they start crying, they are sad. But trying to infer what things mean, can’t get it. I am told I do the opposite with it. I will be very literal, and people will tell me that’s not what that shows at from the words chosen and that there’s hidden meanings behind what you say but I don’t really get it if I am honest around those. It gets too complicated to understand.\n   * *Difficulty with nonliteral speech*\n      * See above from limited understanding of tone of voice in A2  \n   \n \n* **B1 Criteria**\n   * *Hand / finger mannerisms*\n      * Do not have hand flapping, but I do have to crack my left thumb frequently to help stabilize myself and frequently crack my hands to do so as well\n   * *Whole-body mannerism*\n      * Will be told when I am out and in restaurants sometimes that I am rocking back and forth in my seat or while I am out, I will frequently have to switch if standing up the pressure on my feet back and forth\n      * Always have been told that my body is too tense when doing things but I do not know how to untense it \n   * *Abnormal postures*\n      * Used to toe walk all the time; now try to walk normal most of the time, but if it is with my husband, I may do a lot more skipping, waddling, odd ways of walking)\n      * Not good posture; constantly hunched over with an arch / neck forward, but that may also be because I am on the tall side (5'10).\n   * *Immediate or delay echolalia*\n      * Not sure if I have this, but if I hear a phrase and the way they say it and like the way it sounds, I will constantly repeat either in my head or out loud (i.e. if a show / game has a voice that says “XYZ”, I will repeat in same tone, emphasis, etc, that I can, and especially if it says it again).\n   * *Body-focused repetitive behaviors*\n      * Very bad with picking at my skin. I have several cuts on my head I cause and I will consistently pick at (probably like 10-15 right now); to the point in high school, I had one specific one that lasted 2+ years straight. Have to pick at cuts if I see or feel it because my skin does not feel smooth; same with any acne or other bumps I have had.  \n   \n \n* **B2 Criteria**\n   * *Rigid adherence to specific or unusual routines*\n      * Have to sit in the same location – i.e. couldn’t sit down at a dinner hosted at my house with my husband’s family because his uncle took where I sit (reasonably so to be next to his son); however, I literally could not eat with them and had to clean all the dishes to try to calm down. I am not normally violent when it comes to what I believe are melt downs, but I once choked my sister without really realizing it over sitting in my chair.\n      * Had a specific green cup while growing up I could only drink out of and would melt down if I didn’t; similarly, I can only drink out of certain cups and use certain dishes at my house still (but does not affect me when eating out); would freak out if I wasn’t green in games as well. \n   * *Gets unusually upset if routine or environment changes*\n      * Normally, if I have enough time to process, I may be able to handle, but for example, if my husband does not tell me he is staying home from illness / migraine, etc. I have a hard time taking care of him and can have a melt down / freak out instead of being able to take care of him.\n      * If we plan / have a plan for something, I cannot change it and if anything happens that changes that (such as going to dinner and going to play PokemonGo, but I forgot my charger and I am low on battery life), I can start freaking out, screaming, getting what I have been told is irrationally upset from it\n   * *Rigid adherence to established or idiosyncratic rules*\n      * I get very confused when people talk about the “grey” with rules; normally I am by the book on what things say (i.e. if you are to get in at 6:30, I will ensure I am there at 6:30 exactly – no wiggle room)\n   * *Verbal rituals*\n      * Not always, but if I am in a more emotional state, will have the same conversation over and over with my husband and correct what he is saying till he says it properly to help with resolving things\n   * *Compulsion-like behaviors or rituals*\n      * To eat fruit snacks, M&amp;M’s, skittles, etc. I have to organize the pack I got (if it is a snack pack), into the color order for each item, and then eat them from highest number until I have a perfect rainbow which I eat in color order then. \n      * Not as bad now, but used to have to walk and avoid cracks / lines in pavement and would walk on my tippy toes to avoid them…still try to but less strict for me to do all the time\n   * *Perseverative thinking*\n      * I have a tendency if on a topic and I don’t understand, have to continue with the topic even if others are (not always something I can recognize) annoyed at me for trying to understand. Will have a tendency until things are 100% resolved to focus on the topic until I feel completion\n   * *Preoccupation with details / perfectionism*\n      * Always focused on the details which hurts with the perseverative thinking shown above and if not right, have to fix until it is\n      * Actually wrote a speech for AcDec in high school about perfectionism and circular thinking and how my mind would go over and over about perfectionism and to be truly perfect you must be perfect at all things, which would include being perfect at imperfections which means that you would have to be perfectly imperfect, but if you are imperfect then that means that you can’t be perfect…and so on and so for…\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **B3 Criteria**\n   * *Interest in topics that most people would consider unusual*\n      * Not sure I have this, as my topics have become more mainstream, but I love anime (been watching since I was 5 years old and had a meltdown when I changed from K to 1st grade because I could no longer watch Sailor Moon during the day – continue to watch different shows daily), and murder cases, but more specifically Dateline episodes (and here’s Keith Morrison with…)\n   * *Extreme / overriding interest in one or more topics that is abnormal in intensity / depth*\n      * Same as not sure on this because I have a routine for chores that I do not break, so it does not really affect that, though I would say I do not take care of myself health wise perfectly from it (i.e. would rather watch the shows than go run, exercise, etc)\n   * *Engages in certain activities repetitively*\n      * Will watch the same Dateline episodes over and over again (thank you, Oxygen and TruCrime TV!) and do this daily / over the week for hours on end; similarly with anime\n   * *Unusual or developmentally inappropriate attachment to specific objects*\n      * I have an Eevee (from Pokemon) doll that I have had since I was 5 years old that I sleep with every night that I love to death. I have not missed a night since I was 5, bring it on vacations with me, and will break down and cannot sleep until I find it. Literally my prized possession.\n   * *Extensive collection of objects related to interest*\n      * Have a significant amount of stuffed animals (at least a hundred plus), lots of which are Pokemon, cats, etc. I also have a significant amount of Pokemon cards, but I don’t know if it would be enough to call for this (like think in the tens of thousands). For Dateline and anime, hard to have anything specific though towards those, as I don’t like to collect figurines or manga.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **B4 Criteria**\n   * *Tactile defensiveness* \n      * Could not hug anyone outside of my family until I was 18 years old and had friends help train me - would literally run away or scream if anyone got close to me\n      * Continue to hate the sense of touch from majority of individuals (excluding husband), and freak out at doctors / dentists or anywhere an individual may have to touch me to do their job (i.e. break down crying and screaming when any sort of IV / blood is drawn, women's wellness checkouts have started crying in the middle of when being checked because the sense of touch was too much, etc)\n      * Hate the feeling of wet carpet to the point where I  will freak out from touching it; to the point where my husband will always let me take a shower before him (although I don't like showers, especially in the winter because then I feel too dry all day, but I can't use lotions because I hate how they feel).\n   * *Decreased sound tolerance*\n      * Often wear head phones while in public / work because constant noise of beeps from machines, lights, etc. can distract me or any other sounds (individuals talking, cars driving by, doors closing) and cannot seem to stop them\n      * When in what I call a medium / high state (i.e. starting to feel overwhelmed either from sensory / emotional / too much to juggle), any noises become unbelievably painful / irritable for me. Sometimes, I more recently have started trying I or my husband help recognize I am heading towards this state, I listen to music on repeat with head phones to block out any other noise. If I am in this state, I cannot handle touch from anyone and will blow up if anyone including my husband touches me. \n   * *Other sensory hyper-reactivity*\n      * Can't handle \"strong\" smells at all - i.e. will literally run away and / or plug my noise from stores like Bath and Body Work, any cologne section, and get horrible headaches from stores like At Home and cannot handle anyone smoking, will start gagging from too much cleaner smells, etc. \n      * Cannot handle any form of LED with cars - get extremely irritable from them, and have broken down before (luckily while not driving) when accidentally flashed with them from my own car\n      * Cannot handle the texture of many foods - onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, steak, etc. Would have to make PB&amp;J's for myself when growing up when these were eaten because I would be unable to eat it. \n      * Cannot handle \"taste\" of many foods (i.e. extremely sensitivity to spicy food, cannot take medicine to the point where with liquid medicine since I have a hard time with pills, I have to plug my noise and chase it with ice cream or else I will throw up, and with pills have to take it with apple sauce / something to prevent it from hitting my tongue or I cannot swallow it or will throw up.\n   * *Hypo-reactivity to pain, temperature, or other sensory stimuli*\n      * Have people comment for wearing winter jackets when inside and sometimes have to wear multiple to stay warm in office settings where I cannot control the thermostat and have to wear blankets in my house all the time; even in summer in Texas (100+ degrees) will be wearing a sweatshirt / jacket outside and get cold extremely easily but do not have the same sensitivity to heat\n      * Not currently, but used to stare at lights as a little kid for hours while I was at daycares instead of interacting with the other kids because I loved the sensation of staring at the lights\n   * *Interoceptive difficulties*\n      * Can spend a full day easily not eating / drinking, using the bathroom (i.e. have had 14 hour work days where I would do none of these items) without recognizing any of these are deficient; husband will normally have to ask me if I seem irritable if I ate / drank / etc as I can start to behave worse from not recognizing that I am\n      * Have IBS (which switches back and forth from C and D) and either have to run to a bathroom or will not recognize I need to for days and cause other issues\n   * *Unusual sensory interest / sensory seeking*\n      * Not sure if one, but I only really like super soft clothes / blankets or super smooth textures and will sometime rub myself / them if it is a pleasing one\n   * *Enhanced perception*\n      * Unsure if I have this; I am normally quick to hear /  smell / feel something wrong, but not sure if I have this since I cannot really compare too well. I can feel things like small singular spider threads against me or a single, small bug on my body, but not sure if that counts for this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Additional Items from Clinically Significant Associated Symptoms**\n   * *Gross or fine motor impairment*  \n      * Frequently (i.e. daily have at least one of these occur) get bruises from running into walls / objects, stubbing toes, dropping food / spilling drinks on myself, accidentally hitting myself with phone, etc.\n   * *Irritability / aggressive behavior*\n      * When what I go into I believe is a melt down, become extremely this. I can scream, yell, freak out, say horrible things. Feels like a Jekyll and Hyde situation.\n   * *Self-injurious behavior*\n      * When I can’t scream / yell if going into what I think is a melt down, I have a tendency to either dig my nails deep into myself, bite myself, sometimes hit myself with objects (not necessarily to badly – but like slapping myself over and over again with spoon or phone in a relaxing method)\n   * *Sleep disturbance*\n      * Have a tendency to wake up very easily or can’t fall asleep from noises / lights / etc. unless extremely drained. Then I will wake up an hour or two later and be unable to sleep if any of these happen. Very frequently have sleeping issues in the middle of the night if any noise / lights change.\n   * *Emotion dysregulation*\n      * Told by my husband I have a tendency to overreact and be unable to control my emotions in situations where I should not be making things into as big of deal as I am; have a tendency to cry in public or freak out over little things, or blow up at things that I shouldn’t be blowing up at compared to other people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Items from Criteria I Do Not Necessarily See Myself With\n   * A1\n      * *Abnormal responses to others’ social bids*\n      * *Reduced or absent imitation of others behavior*\n   * A2\n      * *Abnormal use of facial expressions and body language*\n      * *Poor integration of verbal and non-verbal communication*\n      * *Limited / abnormal use of gestures*\n      * *Limited / abnormal declarative gestures*\n   * A3\n      * *Difficulty adapting behavior to different social contexts*\n      * *Lack of imaginative play with peers*\n   * B1\n      * *Repetitive play or manipulation of objects*\n      * *Idiosyncratic language*\n      * *Repetitive non-speech vocalizations*\n   * B2\n      * *Substantial knowledge or expertise about specific/obscure topics*\n   * Clinically Significant Associated Symptoms\n      * *Inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity*\n      * *Vocal or motor tics*\n   * Items I have not had diagnosed / enough from Clinically Significant Associated Symptoms, so I do not feel comfortable including one way or the other, as I could not determine well if I do or do not (or if previous cases could apply if better)\n      * *Executive Dysfunction*\n      * *Social Anxiety*\n      * *Nonsocial phobic or generalized anxiety*\n      * *Depression*\n      * *Obsessions and compulsions*\n      * *Suicidal ideation or behavior*\n\nOne additional question I did have though on the criteria – if it says “Lifetime history of **all A Criteria** \\[A1 + A2 + A3\\] needed for diagnosis” does that mean every line item at every portion of history (adulthood, adolescence, childhood) needs to be hit to be diagnosed, or that portions in each do? For example, I would say I am much better with utilizing gestures / body language, and I can do from taking theatre classes for 7-8 years, so although sometimes too much, I do use what I learned there. I practiced a lot of this from middle school on to get better and would stare at myself in mirrors to get the right faces made, so I may not meet some of that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo anyone who actually read even some of that or skimmed any of it, thank you, as I know that was a lot (like 9 to 10 pages in word). To those who did not want to because it really was a lot...: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***tldr***: Have mapped out several symptoms from the DMS-5 that makes sense to me on how I think / may fit with some scenarios, but trying to gauge others experiences on a more personal level and seeing if I am relatable with any of this, as I feel from the books, posts, experiences, etc. I have read about autism, I can relate. I know everyone has different symptoms, different experiences, as it is a spectrum, so trying to see if any of this fits anyone else's experiences on that spectrum before taking next steps in the diagnostic process.",

Usually with my mom but can happen with really anybody. I’m not angry at the person for asking me to do said thing and I don’t actually mind doing said thing, I just can’t seem to compute it in my head because I was already planning on doing x then y then z, then I’d have free time. I’ve lost it before and snapped at people for asking me to do stuff unexpectedly. Then I usually feel really guilty afterwards because they didn’t deserve it and it wasn’t a big deal and I should’ve just been able to adapt like everyone else. As an example, I live with my mom and I slept in this morning and was planning on doing my morning routine to music to get myself going and she came home early and asked me to do a couple things for her and I just got so irritated and I tried to help but I got stuck sitting down probably with a stank look on my face and she was asking me questions and I just could not deal. I tried to explain but it just doesn’t seem like she gets it. Now I’m currently laying down in bed because I feel incapable of going back to what I was doing before. Is this just related to difficultly task switching? How do I deal with this? My routines get interrupted constantly because I live with my family.",

        "text": "Hello! Apologies for the long post, if you read it all I’m just hoping someone can provide some insight or advice :)\n\n——\n\nI was diagnosed semi-recently, and it’s caused me to view most of my issues through the “is this autism” lens.\n\nRight now, my problem is that I can’t fully relax unless my evenings feel like an “event”. I’m never *really* happy unless I’ve planned out a chill night for myself that feels “special” in one way or another. Unfortunately, the stars have to align *just right* to pull this off, and it doesn’t happen nearly often enough.\n\nIt’s actually really simple; I have pretty much the same routine every time one of these ideal nights comes around. I just need to have 3 specific things lined up:\n\n1) A movie I’m already excited about, so I can anticipate it all day and not waste time picking something on Netflix\n\n2) A big meal and plenty of snacks to eat while I watch\n\n3) An edible (or booze, if I was still drinking)\n\nThat last point is the tricky one. I smoke weed daily, and while I *am* trying to quit, I still feel like I need an edible to truly enjoy myself. Regular smoking doesn’t even cut it, I need a “set-it-and-forget-it” type of high, or else the whole night feels like an underwhelming waste of time.\n\nObviously, this presents a bunch of problems. It’s not sustainable to take drugs or eat like a pig every night, and it’s unreasonable to expect to find “the perfect movie” every night. But over the past 3 or 4 years, this has been the only way to enjoy an average evening.\n\nIm actively trying to fix the unhealthy habits that led me to this point, but until that’s taken care of, I’m just wondering *why* I need all this. I can’t put my finger on what these things are actually doing for me, or why I need to be *so specific* about them.\n\nDoes anyone else out there struggle with this kinda “perfectionism”? Is there really any way for me to achieve this ideal night on a regular basis? I dont feel like I’m asking for much- I don’t need to be in pure bliss every night, I just want to be able to enjoy a fucking movie.\n\nIf anyone else has similar issues, I’d love to hear how you’re dealing with them, or any suggestions on changing my patterns.",

I always assumed (probably based on media portrayals and stereotypes) that it meant mathematical patterns, but can it apply to other areas as well? \n\nI’ve always been quick to pick up on musical quotations and samples, both lyrical callbacks and less obvious ones like chord progressions and instrumental melodies in the background of songs. Like on first listen of a new song, I’ll hear a phrase and it instantly triggers my brain to say “I know that! I’ve heard that before!” It might take a few minutes or listens to figure out exactly where it’s from, but the recognition is instant. I do have some music theory background (took piano classes for about 10 years as a kid) but wouldn’t consider myself particularly musically gifted person and haven’t played an instrument in over a decade. I don’t know if I’m even using the correct musical terminology in this post lol. Could this be an autistic thing or does everyone just do this?\n\nContext: I’m 26F and recently diagnosed (informally but professionally) by my psychologist within the last year. My husband and I are both pretty sure that he’s undiagnosed autistic, and in the course of me trying to learn more about autism in that context I’ve increasingly begun to suspect that I might have it too. Currently exploring it with my psychologist and also doing my own research.",

        "text": "I had done some pretty extensive research into psychology when I was young and had suspected that I was autistic but brushed it off for a long time because self diagnosis is generally something you're not supposed to do, then more recently it came up in a conversation with my lady and she said she had suspected it for a long time but didn't want to say anything and be rude and that her coworker had also said something when she met me. This sent me into another researching frenzy and the more I read and the more videos I watched the more I felt like it fit me. I talked to my grandma about it and she seemed super relieved and said it explains a lot, then I talked to my aunt who I lived with for a bit at one point and things got more complicated. Apparently when I was in counseling when I was young (I barely remember the inside of the building let alone anything else about it) the councilor thought my behavior was due to trauma (which evidently I experienced but I don't remember it and I still haven't been told about it) and that I was at high risk for attachment disorder. Apparently I used to also have maladaptive daydreaming and I would forget things on a day to day basis.\n\nI guess my question would be is there a way of separating out the distinction between autism, cptsd, and unchecked reactive attachment disorder that has made it's way to adulthood? I understand there can be comorbidities which can complicate things even further. Does it even matter what I call it? I feel like if I tell people I have autism they'll at least be able to get a grasp of what I've got going on with me, and that's the most important part anyway. If someone would tell me what happened to me maybe I could work through some of it, but that doesn't seem to be in the cards for now.\n\nSide note: I also was diagnosed with ODD while I was in the juvenile court system for smoking pot, and I had a complete mental breakdown once that landed me in the hospital and they were talking about possible schizotypal disorder.",

Which seems to suggest that's not how it is for allistic people..?\n\nDoes anyone have more information about this?",

        "text": "If you are arguing that autism isn’t a disorder or a disability you are choosing to pay more attention to people with lower support needs (we all have support need (even the lowest level of autism requires support), invalidating the struggles of higher support needs autistics, which leads to harmful stigmatization and the belief that only certain autistics are acceptable. “Disability” isn’t a bad word. Autism is a disability, and you can’t be autistic without being disabled or disordered. I don’t care if you believe that, in a perfect world, we wouldn’t be disabled. We aren’t in a perfect world, so we’re disabled now, whether we like it or not. Do not go spreading harmful rhetoric about autism about how it’s completely normal and there’s nothing inherently challenging about being autistic or that autism is an advancement in human evolution. \n\nThe point of de-stigmatizong disability is that we still recognize that it’s a disability without equating someone’s humanity or value to what they can or can’t do. Also, I get that it’s hard, but engaging in petty tribalism, criticizing non-autistic people for something they have no more control over than we do is extremely hypocritical and isn’t helping anyone. Find a different means to catharsis that doesn’t involve putting other people down.",

Lived with only my mom most of my life, still do. But I still can't socialize appropriately with my mom like I always avoid eye contact ( it's uncomfortable ), she says I speak too low and mumble ( almost everyone tells me this ), Idk how to start or continue a convo ( I sometimes plan how im gonna start a convo with her ), I sometimes don't hi to her ( idk why ), idk how to express my appreciation or love to her ( Haven't said \"I love you\" to my mom or it's hard to say \"thank you\" ), I don't express how im feeling in my face around people ( she always ask \"what's wrong\" even though I feel fine ). I have these problems with everyone, including my mom. Even though I lived with her for so long. Around my small group of friends I used to have ( I don't talk to them anymore ) I was kinda myself, but a more exaggerated version of myself. I made up things to act like I related to them, made a lot of offensive jokes to keep them laughing, I never really shared my inner emotions with them, I still had conversating issues like starting and continue etc. But when im alone in private, I talk to myself and I feel I'm able to conversate good and I can show emotions without people around. Im weird.",

        "text": "Hey there everyone. \nI have something I would like to understand. I have recently started seeing someone who has autism (they say it's type 1, but I'm still not sure what that means) being my first time dating someone with autism I've asked a lot of questions to them and I have tried to informe my self as much as I can on the subject. One thing I really can't get my head around is: they never ask about me. Like, I really enjoy knowing them better, and I ask about their experiences and what they like etc, but they never do the same with me. Like, everything they know about me is because I spontaneously told them. What I do wonder, before I ask them and make them feel uncomfortable, is it some sort of character trait, a form of narcissism, or is it an autism symptom? \nI truly want to understand. \nThanks for the help, peace.",

Have years of masking and camouflaging left you in isolation from your autistic self? Would you like to work on these along with other autistic adults? \n\nMy new Finding Your #ActuallyAutistic Self groups are starting up this month and I'm really excited to share them with you. Every week, 6 of us will be getting together to share, learn &amp; grow by exploring the Autistic Self in a collaborative, affirming &amp; relaxed environment.\n\nEach week we will be discussing important and pressing topics to the lives of all autistic people, including getting in touch with your inner self, self-advocacy, how to identify and prevent meltdowns, shutdowns &amp; burnouts, tools for self-regulation &amp; more.\n\nWe will be looking at how executive function plays a role in our wellbeing, how special interests and our values influence our health and happiness, and how to battle ableism in society and within ourselves. All groups are totally accessible to all autistic folks.\n\nWe all have problems with Zoom in a neurotypical world and the groups have been specifically designed to alleviate the typical discomforts and stimulatory overload that can exist there for us. They are a safe space to be yourself, to stim, to learn from others, to share.",

        "text": "Im 25, and I've always had crippling and debilitating social anxiety as well as shyness. Social interactions are incredibly exhausting mentally and almost physically for me. Practicing presentations and practicing public speaking or social skills to others doesn't seem to help me improve any social skills, also. I just avoid people and I'm basically mute or nonverbal at most jobs to avoid the embarrassment and confusion. It takes up to a year or 2 at a job for me to feel comfortable enough to unmask and talk a bit more to coworkers. I have trouble stringing sentences together and say really weird things and say word salad and mix up words almost everytime I say something with anyone except my best friend. I also feel really embarrassed looking people in the eye especially if it's a one on one conversation or between someone I'm not comfortable with which is everyone except for one person. \n\n My raw emotions are so incredibly intense and I throw tantrums and hit myself sometimes out of severe frustration. But I have always felt my emotions so intensely and all throughout me, it is an entire experience in and of itself. The best way I could describe them were as if it were an intense nightmare or dream, or like an acid trip where all the emotions and sensations are amplified. I also have a burning and strong sense of justice almost where it can't even be suppressed and become incredibly angry seeing injustice, and speak up in those instances where I would usually be quiet or too anxious to speak up about something. If someone is being hurt I will usually speak up angrily and reprimand the person. \n\nI have also identified heavily with the masking concept discussed here. I've realized I've always masked around my family because I'm really embarrassed of my intense emotions probably because they said something about it to me that I don't remember , so I act very emotionless and like a robot and speak very monotone around them. I'm only truly myself around my best friend. \n\nThank you for all the insight!",
