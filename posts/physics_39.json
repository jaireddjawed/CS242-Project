        "text": "I'm not going on a treatise about this, but I think this is one of the most profound and overlooked phenomena in physics.\n\nIf I take a dollar from you and immediately give it back, who cares? (Other than the police). \"A\" is the creation operator. \"A dagger\" (the dagger looks like a little cross, I don't know how to enter it) is the annihilation operator. A takes a dollar (creates one for you), A dagger removes it, in harmony with the universe (and conservation of energy...we can't just create particles endlessly from nothing).\n\nSo who cares? Well, 2 things make this amazing. First, because of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, what happens between A and A dagger depends on the time you look at the event. The shorter the time, the more energy you will observe. You will start to see many, many A A daggers all over the place.\n\nBut everyone asks: what's the point of algebra? Where does it appear in real life?\n\nHere's where things get interesting. Particles are indistinguishable, and quantum mechanically everything is reversible in time. So, two electrons...both \"x\", repel. In the process, a photon \"y\" is given off (accelerating charges always produce radiation). Well, that's (x\\^2)\\*y. But, you can shift the Feynman diagram by 90 degrees, so that now one is moving backwards in time (it is not...that is just how positrons are represented in quantum field theory...electrons moving backwards in time). Well, now you have x\\*-x\\*y. You will quickly realize that all permutations of x and y are accounted for. This is especially true when Heisenberg s considered: maybe the photon splits to become an electron positron pair, which quickly annihilates, and still drives the electrons apart. Well, now we're up to (x\\^2)\\*y = {(x \\* -x) + (x \\* x)} \\* y. Since energy is conserved, both terms equal zero, and indeed -x\\^2 + x\\^2 = 0. the closer we look, we'll find x\\^4 and x\\^12 terms...all of which will cancel...because A dagger A must equal zero. But in between, a universe happens, and the universe depends on how closely we look at it.\n\nMoreover, every polynomial permutation will be realized. (x\\^3)\\*y, (y\\^3)\\*x...every term will show up eventually. Doesn't that put the meaning of algebra back into your lives?",

Well, high energy particles (and sound is a particle, called a phonon), more readily scatter... that's why a pinball game is so much fun... because the ball scatters readily. If you put a bowling ball in the pinball machine, despite the practical difficulty of \"firing\" it, it would tend to drop, not scatter around the pinball table.\n\nNow think about a bright sunshiny day. What do you do? Put on your sunglasses. It's bright out. But why? Because the high energy photons are bouncing off of everything... like the pinball machine. They bounce off the ground, the dashboard... and then interact with your eyes. They have lots of energy, like the pinball, and therefore \"interact\" readily, both from the dashboard surface and with the rods and cones of your eye. But, you cannot see infrared light. It has a much lower energy. The energy of light is equal to its wavelength. Light with long wavelengths has less energy, and is this more difficult to see, or scatter.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nEinstein realized E=mc2. That means the smaller the mass of the particle, the less energy it has.\n\nWhy can't we (easily) detect neutrinos?\n\nBecause they are almost massless. The mass of the neutrino is so small that, even in particle accelerators, we have no idea what it is. It's so tiny, all we can say is \"incredibly small, but we don't have any idea how small.\"\n\nAdding it all up, the tiny neutrino (though it seems counterintuitive compared to the massive bowling ball), doesn't \"bounce\" off of things. It doesn't \"interact.\" And the counterintuiveness of the bowling ball is easily resolved: it's heavy, but moves slowly. It doesn't zip around like the pinball. It has low energy.\n\nThe neutrino has low energy. It doesn't interact, just like the bowling ball.\n\nThat's (one, but a huge) reason why we cannot detect them.\n\nIsn't that cool?",

For example, my professor had us try to find the spring constant necessary for a falling elevator to be supported, and the solution used work to find the answer. What thought process helps you decide what to use? When is it appropriate to use work?",

I can't even put it in words: It's still fun to read next to other stuff but also not that plain, dry and strictly focused on physics that it would have the appearance of a school book.\n\nI don't even remember anymore how I found out about this book but I'd love to get suggestions of books that might be similar to this. Of course, I also googled on my own and checked some threads on here for physics books but I fear that these are purely theoretical where the writing style isn't \"diverse\" and entertaining, or let's say rather missing the context &amp; applications of these ideas, enough that a self-learner of physics would enjoy it. \n\nI'd appreciate if anyone of you all could drop by some cool books you've come across (could be anything physics related, not only astro, but mainly astro &amp; quantum)",

I'm just a simple man, who studies the odds and ends of everything, technical writing and analysis are my strong suites, and I will never stop learning. Eleven years ago a thought came to mind to transpose the model of an atom to that of a community. \n\nNeutrons: buildings, vehicles, tools... \n\nProtons: participating/working members who occupy the neutrons creating the essential core functions of a community. \n\nElectrons: everyone else who's not a proton, who's distance, angle and speed is determined by their relationship and interaction with the nucleus. \n\n\nI will give this some time before going further, any thoughts?",

I dont think i quit understand how photons *are* electric fields, i think i understand how the magnetic part comes about but how can an electrical field just exist on its own like that and how is it able to move through space? Like, what is the electric field?\n \n Am i missing or misunderstanding something?",
