In the early parts of the movie one of the enlisted members of an American submarine is asked if he can speak German, being that he was a 2nd generation American from Pennsylvania. After confirming reluctantly that he did speak fluent German, he begged the executive officer and the chief of the boat to not let anyone else in the crew know he was of German decent because \"they would kill me.\"\n\nIs this crewmember's reaction at all accurate, especially in the early parts of the war? Was there general hostility towards people like him, or even abuse or worse?",

        "text": "So, I've been wondering about the fact that Machiavelli apparently warned against using mercenaries, given that their loyalty is only to money, and I've read people talking about how at least in medieval Italy, it was relatively common to bribe mercenary bands away from their employers.\n\nSo, I've been wondering if this was actually the cases, and if mercenaries, both in medieval Italy and other regions and time periods, really were this unreliable, and, if they were, what benefits they brought that people still hired them.\n\nMy own gut instinct is that it would have had to do with the fact that standing armies are expensive, and that mercenaries, even if potentially unreliable, would still be much more experienced and skilled that raising militias or levees, making them worth it. That, and the fact that at least for Italian city states, they might not have the population numbers to raise decent-sized levees or professional armies even if they wanted to.",

I understand that this is a complex topic and so far I am  only scratching the surface with my understanding and it seems to me,  especially with this topic, there are sometimes very emotionalized and  politically motivated narratives/views even among historians. Several  times I read of an, to me also understandable explanation approach,  according to which it was less a story of barbarian attacks on the Roman  Empire, but rather a story of an increasingly in financial distress  empire which could no longer afford their own soldiers and increasingly  had to hire Germanic soldiers. Now it seems to me that an important part  that could help me to more or less objectively assess these claims  would be economic data about which provinces paid how much in taxes and  when, and how the Roman Empire managed its budget. Is there a  recommended source from which I could obtain such data? I thank you very  much if someone takes the time to answer this question.",

The same would follow for any other long-lived political units. On the Nazi side, I have the opposite supposition: it would have taken so many things going *right* for Nazi Germany for the Nazis to have won or at least lasted longer as a cohesive entity, and it just so happens that the stars did not align at even the first \"critical inflection point\" for the Nazi regime.",

I've seen red wine turn blue when alkaline water is added due to this effect. What if Greeks regularly used something which made their wine basic and blue and this was the origin of the likening of the color to the sea?

With the exception of a few dedicated books such as 'Friendly Enemies' by Berger and LaPorte there seems to be very little material around their relationship.\n\nIs there any real specific reason for this? Despite the obvious ideological differences and adherence to the Hallstein doctrine why do historians both during the Cold War and today often overlook and ignore their relationship, even though Hansard and primary sources showed an almost defacto recognition of the GDR existing by the early 60s?\n\nThere seems to be no quarrel in examining the historical relations between the UK and FRG during this time period. Is Anglo-GDR relations considered irrelevant by some and a waste of time, such as looking at Albanian-Kenyan relations or something similar?",

Shortly after, I was able to track my family from a village of less than 400 to a slightly larger town. Where my family had one ancestral line with the Balla name in the village, I found a record 26 Ballas in the nearby town of Kiscigánd/Cigánd! This was in the 1760s. \n\nThe person who answered my previous post said that my family was likely Italians coming to engage in some sort of trade, and I was wondering if there’s a chance that Kiscigánd or Cigánd was one of those towns. If not, I was wondering if there was a nearby town in the Zemplen area of Hungary this mass amount of Ballas could have travelled from. \n\nThank you in advance! I’ve been trying to put some type of timeline together for my family out of curiosity and it has been so much fun.",

German U-boats were much more successful in that region in attacking Allied convoys.\n\nWas any thought given to having the available aircraft fly one-way flights?  Rather than having to leave the area to fly back to their bases, did the Allies consider building planes that could fly over the the convoys until their fuel ran out and then ditch in the ocean.  The plane, or at least the crew, could be picked up by the surface vessels and taken to the convoy's destination.  There the plane could be repaired / refueled - or the crew could just get a new plane - to repeat the process in the opposite direction.\n\nI realize that many planes would be lost at sea (especially if only the crew could be retrieved), but I would guess that losing many planes (and, unfortunately, many crew members) would be a small price to pay to better safeguard the convoys which were the lifeline of Great Britain, and the lynchpin of the war effort.",

However, there are also significant differences between the two countries, particularly in terms of their demographics and economic development.\n\nJapan is currently experiencing a population crisis, which is characterized by an aging population, low birth rates, and a shrinking workforce. This is due to a number of factors, including a decline in marriage rates, a lack of childcare facilities, and very low immigration. Japan's immigration policies have historically been restrictive, with a preference for skilled workers and limited opportunities for family reunification.\n\nThere is also a perception among many Japanese people that immigrants may threaten their cultural identity and social cohesion. Some also believe that an influx of immigrants could lead to increased crime and social unrest. These concerns have contributed to a general resistance to increasing immigration levels in Japan.\n\nIn contrast, Germany has a more open approach to immigration, the declining birth rate and an aging population, has created a need for young and skilled workers to help sustain the economy. Additionally, Germany has made efforts to address its historical legacy of racism and xenophobia, and to promote a more inclusive society that welcomes immigrants, unlike Japan.\n\nBecause of this, Germany's population has remained relatively stable in recent years, and the country has not experienced the same kind of demographic crisis as Japan faces. Despite the fact that deaths have outpaced births in Germany for the last 50 years!

The Allies also sought to punish and hold accountable those responsible for the atrocities committed during the war.\n\nIn Japan, however, the primary goal was to rebuild the country and to create a stable and democratic society. The Allies were less focused on punishing Japanese leaders for their role in the war and instead sought to transform Japan into a peaceful and productive nation. This was reflected in the policies implemented during the occupation, which focused on economic reconstruction, political reform, and cultural change\n\nThirdly, the nature of the societies in Japan and Germany were different. Japan had a highly centralized government and a relatively homogeneous population, while Germany was more diverse and had a federal system of government.

        "text": "From this article: [https://www.kennedysandking.com/john-f-kennedy-articles/the-ordeal-of-malcolm-perry](https://www.kennedysandking.com/john-f-kennedy-articles/the-ordeal-of-malcolm-perry)\n\n&gt; It is very hard to comprehend how not one of them called for a film  camera to cover the initial public pronouncement of President Kennedy’s  death.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;  \n&gt; But further, the Secret Service lied to the Commission about having the  transcript. In responding to Commission counsel Arlen Specter’s request,  Chief of the Secret Service James Rowley wrote a letter to chief  counsel J. Lee Rankin. He said that he could not locate either the films  or the transcript of this press conference. (DiEugenio, p. 367) As the  ARRB proved, this was a lie, because they found a transcript of that  press conference that was time stamped, “Received US Secret Service 1963  Nov. 26 AM 11:40”. (ibid) Does it get much worse than that? In other  words, the Warren Commission’s own investigators were keeping important  pieces of evidence from them—and then lying about it.",

This is the [scene](https://youtu.be/xQsCj2dm83k?t=4759).\n\nJim Crow was still around in 1934 so I am curious why the pro Confederate writers of the film included this in the film.\nIs there any historical basis for this scene ?\n\nWere Confederate rallies integrated in the Jim Crow South ?",
