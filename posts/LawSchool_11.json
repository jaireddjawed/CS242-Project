Can you talk to the professor after class or office hours? I only answer questions I find challenging or when other people can’t get it and I want the class to move on. I never bother answering easy questions for the sake of answering them unless participation is graded (rare).\n\nGunners need to realize that working hard is not the same is superficially trying to stand out at the detriment of their peers.

All my classes are full-year, and I did NOT do well on my midterms (two B- and a C+, only 2 Bs and 1 B+), which are the grades that were sent to firms. I only managed to get 2 interview offers in my city's 1L recruit cycle, and neither firm selected me for their second round of interviews. I'm applying to other positions, but I can't shake the feeling that it feels kind of pointless, like I'm just not cut out for this. I'm not smart enough, charming enough, or there's some secret thing about this whole process that I just don't *get*. I'll obviously still apply anyway, but I just know that I won't be successful, given my grades and comparably unimpressive resume. \n\nI know it sounds like imposter syndrome, but I truly feel like I'm in a significantly worse place than many of my classmates. Almost all of them have worked for at least a year before law school, and because of the curve I *know* my grades are below average, even if the grades I have now count for max 30% of my final grade. I'm working hard, writing my own CANs, doing all of the readings, reviewing, studying, but it still feels like I'm behind, and even the people who never do any of those things have a better grasp on like 75% of the material than I do. \n\nI just don't know what to do, it feels like I've screwed over my entire legal career before I've completed a single year of law school. I'm starting to feel like I'm just not cut out for this, but I don't really have another plan.

        "text": "**TLDR: Is it possible to transfer from my communications major to a more prestigious school's law program in my sophomore year of college?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am currently a high school senior, and have been on track to attend college for communications with a focus in journalism, however recently I've been thinking of switching tracks.\n\nI come from a lower income family and have had a handful of problems throughout high school, and at several points seriously considered dropping out, resulting in some less then stellar grades. Recently, I have cleaned up my act and my junior and senior year GPAs have not dropped below a 3.8, and I was able to earn a sizeable amount of college credits with dual enrollment and AP programs.\n\nI have been slightly involved with my school's mock trial for a few years now, I had a friend running it and they needed someone to step in as a witness and I did it as a favor to them. When this year began, I expected to assume a similar role  this year, and it was on track to go normally, when two weeks before our first competition, both our presidents and a crucial lawyer pulled out due to personal crisis. \n\nI was asked to step in to fill that role as a lawyer, and to help run meetings, out of loyalty to my friend, I reluctantly agreed. \n\nWorking as a lawyer however, was much more fun then I expected. I dedicated most of my time in those two weeks to preparing, and on the actual day of court, I felt fantastic. I've always enjoyed public speaking but I felt really in my element and on top of my game. I got a lot of positive feedback and we were able to win, allowing us to continue forth to the next round of the competition.\n\nThrough all of this I was still also a witness for our defense team as well. While we lost that round, we still managed to score enough points to move forward again.\n\nNow we are preparing for the third round, and I have assumed control over our defense team due to a myriad of conflicts within the team. I've been running most club meetings for a while now, and have had a hand in almost every part of this club. \n\nAll in all I haven't been this dedicated to anything in years. It's the highlight of my week, and developed a real passion for law over the last six months.\n\nI've already committed to a small private college in NYC for communications, so I will definitely be going there in the fall. My question is; Is it possible to transfer into a larger law program at a different school in my sophomore year of college?\n\nIf I maintain a 3.9-4.0 GPA from now until the end of my first year of college, and continue to expand my resume and invest in my academic life, could I apply to Columbia? Are law schools transfers normal and expected, or is it more seldom and a far-reaching goal?",

The fellowship was intended to be one year and was extended an additional 2 months. It was a fantastic experience, I have a whole list of people from there who proactively told me that they would be happy to give me a recommendation and help me out career-wise, and the HR team has told me that they would consider me for junior counsel roles (the most junior level attorney roles in the company) that open up. The position ended a month and half ago, and there haven't been any junior counsel roles open since then.\n\nSo I've been applying elsewhere, to in-house jobs, law firm jobs, and a couple relevant government jobs, and just can't get any traction. No interviews, not even HR screeners. Any time I've dealt with an outside recruiter they seem to have no idea what to do with an applicant who didn't go the traditional \"law firm upon graduation\" route, and I'm struggling to explain that I'm seeking a new position because I completed a fellowship, not because I was fired or \"no offered\" or whatever other big law terminology.\n\nDoes anyone have advice for where to go from here?",

From my understanding, law students find the exam very easy-it is supposed to be similar to the bar, but significantly easier-but tax accountants rarely pass.

Still, one that particularly stands out in my memory is the case of P. J.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe was a young soldier who had just completed his basic training and was serving his first tour of duty overseas. One day, while on patrol in a hostile area, P. J.'s unit came under attack. In the chaos and confusion of the moment, he mistakenly discharged his weapon, striking and killing a civilian fleeing the area.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnderstandably, P. J. was devastated by what had happened. He had joined the military to serve his country and protect innocent people, and he had unintentionally caused harm. The media quickly picked up the incident. Thus, it became the subject of intense public scrutiny to worsen matters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs his military defense attorney, my job was to provide the guy with the best possible legal representation and ensure his rights were protected throughout the process. It meant conducting a thorough investigation of the incident, working closely with military investigators and prosecutors to gather evidence and build a strong defense, and advocating in court on P. J.'s behalf.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the same time, I also had to provide emotional support and help him cope with the stress and trauma of the situation. We spent many hours together, discussing his feelings and working through the grief and guilt he was experiencing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUltimately, after a long and difficult legal process, we secured a favorable outcome for P. J. While he did face some consequences for his actions, including a demotion in rank and a period of probation, he was able to avoid a more severe conviction and was able to continue serving in the military.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking back on the case, I am struck by the many complex issues it raised, from the challenges of defending a client who has caused harm to the role of the media in shaping public perceptions of military justice. At the same time, I am also proud of the work that my team and I were able to do on behalf of P. J. and the positive impact we were able to have on his life and career.",

I do not have a job lined up post bar but have been applying to post-bar jobs all over the place with almost every single one wanting you to be licensed. I am not stressing passing the bar but I am stressing the waiting period between the test and results. I recently decided I really want to take a month or so solo trip after the test, from early August to early September. My question is, will this kill me on the job hunt or look terrible to potential recruiters? Money is not the issue here as I can cover the trip comfortably but I will have to move to a new city after i return and find a job. Is this a realistic option for me or is that period between testing and passing going to sink me if I’m not 100% in on the job hunt during this time? Please give me your honest opinion.",

Thus, I was thrilled when I got a call from a law firm about a law clerk position paying decent money.\n\nThe main partner wants to interview me on Tuesday for a law clerk position with him. I should have researched the firm beforehand, but whatever, I've sent out hundreds of resumes.  \n\nIt turns out that the main partner's main client (or the one he's most boastful about) is a certain election-denying politician currently mired in litigation and investigations.  Though I am someone who can be neutral in most situations when needed, I have a fundamental disagreement with this politician. Not sure if I could stay neutral or quiet.\n\n**Should I just pull out of the interview now?**  This does not sit right with my soul. OTOH, the money is good and I have a family I need to consider.
