My muscles with start having excruciating pain, they will start to feel heavy like stone. Trouble breathing, absolutely no appetite, spasms, my head is spinning when laying down, blurry and double vision, can’t open my eyes because muscles start to get affected, dry mouth, tychicardia attacks, low grade fevers, night sweats, nerve pain, severe anxiety, trouble swallowing, numbness, and a lot more but I won’t overwhelm anyone else with the long list.\n\nI want to get off the Doxy because I’m aware of the harm I am causing to my body but this illness is a lot scarier and worse. I don’t think my description of it really captures how severe it is. I’m very scared and I am hoping I can find an alternative medication that will allow me to have a normal life. Anyone know why it’s helping? immunosuppressant maybe? I tried taking steroids and although I think it helped in some areas it was making me jittery and giving me more severe seizures. \n\nThank you everyone and have a great day!",

        "text": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in various professional fields, such as medicine, journalism, and finance. For example, ChatGPT has achieved good scores on the MCAT, and AI-powered news platforms can now generate articles that mimic human-written content. Additionally, AI has proven to be a useful tool for financial analysts, psychologists, and many other professions.\n\nWhile the benefits of AI are undeniable, it's essential to consider the potential threat that AI poses to certain professions. As AI technology continues to improve, there's a possibility that it could replace human workers in various fields. Therefore, it's vital for individuals to assess the risk that AI poses to their profession and consider ways to adapt and stay relevant.\n\nI urge commenters to objectively evaluate the threat that AI presents to their profession and share their thoughts. Furthermore, I encourage them to compare their chosen career path with other professions across various fields in terms of the potential impact of AI.\n\nWhether you're a doctor, lawyer, psychologist, financial analyst, or in any other profession, AI will undoubtedly have an impact. As AI technology continues to advance, it's crucial to stay informed and take proactive steps to adapt and stay ahead of the curve.\n\nIt's worth noting that this post was written by ChatGPT, a language model trained by OpenAI.",

AMBOSS is fine but asks too many niche questions imo that don’t carry over into exam questions. For context, First aid is almost a massive summary of the entire first and second year curriculum of Australian MD programs so I thought UWorld would be a good complement to that. \n\n\n\nAny thoughts/reccs are appreciated!!",

        "author": "cwillzz",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1162s0m/help_me_choose_a_specialty/",
        "text": "Hi reddit,\n\nNot sure how frowned upon this activity is, so I'm sorry if it's in the wrong place. However, I do actually want some input/feedback in my struggle to choose a specialty. I am having an *incredibly* difficult time choosing between a few choices, and I know the clock is ticking. I'm an MS3 and I need to apply for auditions here soon, as well as focus my energy on one field. Here I will post a personal pros/cons for each and I would love any comments.\n\nBasically, I'm torn between 3 specialties: **emergency medicine**, **anesthesia**, and **general** **surgery**. I have been pretty set on one of these 3 the entire year, but I *cannot* for the life of me narrow this down to one single choice. I have considered dual applying, but I have been told by many that I shouldn't do this.\n\nOne more thing to consider: I have a strong regional preference for the southwest US. I will be applying to other programs, but I would like the opportunity to return to my home state.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEMERGENCY MEDICINE\n\n**Pros**: \n\n\\- Extensive experience with this specialty. I worked in the ED for 3 years before med school, and I have a good understanding of what the role entails. I have yet to have an actual EM rotation yet, however. \n\n\\- I like the need for diagnosis/differentiation of patients. I did not like FM much except for this aspect of the job. I like having to do the detective work, however I understand EM is more of a *rule out* field. I also like dealing with many fields of medicine\n\n\\- There are high acuity situations that are great, but they are pretty rare overall.\n\n\\- My resume is fairly tailored towards this specialty. I kind of picked it as a default specialty when starting school and have ECs and research in the field. I have at least 2 letter writers I know I can get, including one assistant PD. I do like the amount of radiology involved as well.\n\n\\- Shift work is generally a net *positive* for me. I like the flexibility and the lack of a 9-5, but I know I will hate working overnights when I'm 40. \n\n\\- There are multiple programs in my home town, which would be ideal.\n\n\\- I like the fellowship options (critical care, tox, ultrasound)\n\n**Cons**:\n\n\\- I did *dislike* a lot about the ED when I worked there. It is a very negative placee, and there is A LOT of mundane tasks that got boring fast. I definitely felt burn out while working there. The amount of acuity was also very low.\n\n\\- From what I've heard, in academic settings, you are more of a referral service and rarely get to intervene, as so many specialties are in house. I dislike this aspect (I love teaching so I would *prefer* academic for all fields). \n\n\\- EM procedures can be cool, but the least cool out of any of the fields I'm considering.\n\n\\- Job outlook is a really big consideration. EM has probably the *worst* outlook out of any field at the moment. I can't see myself practicing in a rural community, so I could definitely feel the wrath of this issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nANESTHESIA\n\n**Pros**:\n\n\\- I love pharmacology and anesthesia is very pharm heavy. \n\n\\- The procedures are cool and done every single day. I like the use of ultrasound for nerve blocks and that whole evolving field. There is a fair amount of acuity, but it feels a bit different from high acuity scenarios in other fields.\n\n\\- Lifestyle is pretty great. They seem to be generally happy and they made a good living while not sacrificing a ton for it.\n\n\\- I love the instantaneous decision making that is required, but I don't like the fact that you're not really the leader of a team\n\n**Cons**:\n\n\\- There's really not much \"diagnosing\" per say. It's more of action and reaction. There is instant gratification which is nice, but there's not that element of having to diagnosis someone that I know I will miss\n\n\\- I don't care for much of the fellowships, except critical care. \n\n\\- There is a lot that I *like* but don't *love*. I like the concepts in anesthesia, but I don't love them. I like the decision making aspect, but I don't love the lack of being the leader in the room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGENERAL SURGERY\n\n**Pros**:\n\n\\- I love operating and I think I would be a good surgeon. I love the technical aspect that surgery brings as a whole other element to your job. I also love the leadership component\n\n\\- I enjoy the fact that medicine remains strong in surgery. You still have to have to be a good medicine doctor to succeed in surgery residency and as a surgeon.\n\n\\- Rarely gets mundane. Everyone is a different person with different anatomy\n\n\\- I am super interested in trauma surgery. I would enjoy other fellowships as well.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n\\- Residency is hell, at least from what I've heard. I have heard this \"40%\" rule over and over again, and I really would like to not get a divorce because of my residency. My spouse is not in medicine and it's difficult for a non-medicine person to truly understand the grind. I also really do not want to be like 3 years in and decide to switch specialties. I say this because although I really like surgery, I'm certainly not *married* to it. It seems like all surgeons I have met didn't even consider other specialties. To me, this is a sign that I probably should think otherwise.\n\n\\- Lifestyle can be terrible. The surgeon I worked with was working 12-14 hours a day and working weekends while in his 70s. I have seen other surgeons with a mix of lifestyles. I am happy with working a lot, coming in random times, etc. but I do want to enjoy my life as well.\n\n\\- I don't really particularly love the regular pathology seen in general surgery, as in a lot of GI stuff, but I understand there's quite a bit of diversity. I do enjoy the amount of radiology and pathology exposure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, if you've made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read this. Let me know if I'm crazy about something, not thinking about certain elements, and in general what feeling you got from reading this.\n\nI was going to include a blurb about my CV but I will only do that if anyone thinks it is necessary. \n\nThanks!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/115p2vm/making_your_rank_list_thoughts_from_an_intern/",
        "text": "With the rank order list deadline approaching, I wanted to offer my unsolicited thoughts on making a rank list. I am an anesthesiology PGY-1 at an excellent program that also happened to be my rank #5. The news of matching at my #5 program was crushing. My wife &amp; I were not mentally or emotionally prepared. We're in a much better place now and I've made great friends in this new city and love my co-interns. That said, when making my rank list I put value on aspects of programs that really shouldn't have mattered and ignored important aspects that ought to have changed the rank order by quite a bit. This is a list of things I think are overrated and underrated when considering you rank list. This isn't sage advice and I hope the tone of this reads as if I'm acknowledging my mistakes. You might read this and think I'm was idiot and \"of course *I* wouldn't do that\" but hopefully you find a pearl or two somewhere. Some of these I knew weren't worth my time before, but some are new realizations I've had now that internship is almost over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Overrated - stuff we should all care less about**\n\n1. Salary. By this, I mean specifically the amount of money listed on a program's GME website per PGY level. These almost always end up adjusting for cost of living except in rare circumstances. Instead of thinking about your post-tax resident pay--which is likely to be roughly the same everywhere when adjusting for location--consider the value added by other things I talk about below that will keep money in your pocket.\n2. Any post-interview communication, even if it feels personal. I've talked about this separately so I won't belabor it here. I received a very personalized email from a PD that mentioned my wife and daughter by name that lead me to believe I would be matching at my #1 choice. This left me feeling like a fool on match day and I was extremely embarassed. I'd seen the stories before and it *still happened to me*. It nearly always means nothing and I should've known better.\n3. Prestige. I know we all have a bit of an ego and a drive to be awesome. We're in medicine, after all. But if your rank list is a copy-pasta of Doximity or USNWR, you're doing it wrong. I didn't fall into this trap too deeply, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't make some of my choices based on the perceived prestige of the programs alone. In fact, this probably contributed to that whole #1 choice thing that didn't work out. Even though I received an interview and personal email, that program was out of my academic league and upon reflection after the match I should've known a bit better. I also ended up putting programs that I didn't like on interview in the middle of my list because of prestige while ranking places I actually enjoyed lower. It can be hard to ignore these things, but try your best.\n4. \"We're only 3-4 hours from \\*insert cool thing here\\*.\" I'm sure there are some out there who would, but it ain't me. When I have a precious day off or normal weekend, I'm not strapping me, my wife, two babies, and the dog in the car for a 4 hour trek to some fancy cliff or beach for the afternoon or one night and then driving back the next day having to get up at 5am again to go to work. This isn't universal, but I think a lot of people get it.\n5. Rapid fire things that I think are bullshit/don't deserve to factor in on your list because literally EVERY program says them: \"you'll get great training here\" / \"the acuity is really high\" / \"the beer/wine/brewery/alcohol-thingy scene is great here\" / \"we're like a family\" / \"the people\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Underrated - stuff we should care more about**\n\n1. Proximity to family/friends/support. This one cuts deep. Three of my top five ranks were &gt;5 hours away from my parents and in-laws. We only had one kid at the time and found out literally three days after the match we were having another. We are 6 hours from any family or friends so my wife is home alone a lot without help. Sure we've made friends and local resources, but my home program was 1.5 hours away from both sets of parents and I definitely undervalued that access when making my rank list. Also, residency is fucking tiring. Sometimes you just want to be away from medicine and the place you do it for a bit and nothing brings me more joy than seeing my kids be with their grandparents in the house I grew up in.\n2. Good benefits. Rapid review: retirement + employer match with early vesting, free or convenient parking that is covered depending on geography, money for food or free food regularly when working, funds for studying resources and covering exam fees (Step 3 is $1000, folks), inexpensive health insurance with options for dental and vision, benefits extend to family with little added cost.\n3. Accessible, affordable, and safe amenities. One great thing about our current situation is our suburb we live in now. I have about a 20 minute commute into the city because we needed a bigger house for the kids. Despite being in the burbs, we are &lt;5 minutes from Costco, multiple restaurants, activities for my kids, parks, and community pools. If we need to go into the city, it's close enough, but we have everything we need to survive very close in a safe location. Great schools, convenient parking, a fancy bakery, big green space for the dog, etc. Mind you, we actually had it *better* when living in med school but this is pretty damn close.\n4. If you're married/engaged your wife's or husband's opinion should matter A LOT. We've been together for a long time. Met in high school. She's seen me struggle through it all as have I for her. She's the mother of my children, my best friend, and the most important person on this earth. I could never be happy if she is not happy---one of my favorite quotes for marriage is, \"You can never be happier than your wife/husband. You can both be equally happy or equally miserable.\" When we saw that paper on match day, I was upset but my wife was crushed and it made the guilt/shame much worse. This geographic location was NOT on our radar at all and we had to pivot quickly. I asked her about my rank list often and felt we collaborated on many things. Upon reflection, I wish I had talked about it with her *much more* and thought more carefully about the things she said. Our marriage is rock solid thanks to her grace and heart, but I learned my lesson that day.\n5. Your home program. This one is a bit niche, but there have been many times the past year that I think about how I didn't rank my home program higher. I *loved* my anesthesia faculty. I knew the residency cold. I knew the medicine floor workflow, I knew the OR workflow, I knew the OR pharmacist by name, the hospital doorman, the coffee ladies etc. My wife's doctors were amazing. Our pediatrician was a saint. I could go on and on. I'm very thankful for the people I've met in residency, and I do think moving to a bigger, new city with a *much* bigger hospital system has helped me grow clinically I do not think it matters more than those things I listed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps someone out there. Godspeed in March, folks!",

I ended up with thousands of cards that I haven't reviewed before exams. I tried reading the notes from senior, but it's insufficient and need a lot of fact checking. Also, I have very poor memory and I often have to cram before exams.\n\nIs it too late to start writing notes for all of the topics? I have tried this method but didn't continue since it took me too much time and eventually I just read the seniors' notes before exams.\n\nTLDR: Basically I only have one year left until my final MB exam, what would be the best studying plan?

        "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nIf this kind of post isn’t allowed, please take it down, or let me know &amp; I’ll happily delete it myself. Thank you so much for everyone’s time in advance!\n\nI’m a 21F living in the USA, and I have dreamed of going to medical school &amp; being a doctor for years. Recently though, I have decided to get off the pre-med track and try to pursue a PhD program for no other reason other than Residency. The thought of going into so much debt while selling my soul to help others is honestly repulsive to me. Like, my life’s work is dedicated to helping people &amp; doing good in this world, and as a result I’m going to spend my child bearing years deprived of sleep for somewhere between 3-6 years &amp; put my fertility at risk…. Like that just does not sound viable to me by any means. I guess I’m just looking for advice. I am a Physics major with a double minor in biochem and math, so I can handle the difficult studies, not seeing friends &amp; family often b/c of school, I can handle being alone, I can handle the debt. I do not want to put my fertility at risk due to the lack of sleep and stress one experiences in residency though, so as of recent, I have called it quits on the path to being a doctor. This decision of mine bothers me at night though. It creeps into my mind at every waking moment and, as of recent, has begun to feel like the wrong decision.\n\nTwo things in particular are leading me to believe that I should rescind this decision of mine and begin pursing the path to being a doctor again: 1.) a recent experience I have had with an IUD, which led to the discovery of both a fallopian tube blockage on my right adnexa and a tubo-ovarian abscess, and 2.) the idea of practicing medicine abroad. Being sick recently &amp; experiencing both poor and phenomenal medical care has really reinvigorated my desire to be a doctor again. To provide someone with the relief and answers that I have been given after being told my pain was normal makes me want to become a provider now more than ever. On top of that, I don’t know what my options in terms of medical school and residency look like abroad (particularly in the EU/France), so if I could find a medical track overseas that is more accommodating to my desire of being a wife and a mother one day, then there would be no question as to whether or not I would become a doctor. \n\nDo you guys have any sort of insight or advice for me? I have also considered doing an MD/PhD program as well, but in all honesty, my primary desire is to engage in hands-on care with patients. I want to provide relief. I want to help heal others, I want to improve people’s quality of life, and I want to console families when nothing else could be done, and I want to care for people. With an MD/PhD program though (&amp; certainly with just a PhD), I’m just not sure if I can do that. Grading papers &amp; lecturing about the exact same content for the rest of my life seems so grim… Sure, I could mentor students, which I’m sure I’d still love, but I want don’t want to just mentor. I want to save LIVES. I want to be IN THE FIELD. I don’t, however, want to compromise my own health and well-being in order to do so though!!! Any and all advice you have is welcome. Thank you all so much again!!",

The other day, we had a doctoring lecture on taking a sexual history and it was all pretty standard questioning. However, one of my classmates was extremely upset when our professor reminded to always ask a patient’s preferred way of being addressed (just like we’ve ALWAYS been doing it), and that student got mad. They were so mad, that they argued with the professor for 30 minutes about how they “weren’t giving him any other options” and they’re “forcing me to ask a preferred way of being addressed.” ….like what? The professor was genuinely confused and didn’t know what to do. They’re very nice also (and straight but an ally) and decided not to report it. However, that student has said some other problematic things in the pass too (not just transphobia but his HORRIBLE opinions on drug users) and I feel like it needs to be addressed. \n\nHOWEVER. I was NOT in the lecture hall when the incident happened and only heard the story from multiple students and the professor themself (we were talking in confidence and the prof did NOT reveal the student’s identity), so I’m not sure if I have any power to report them or do anything really besides make a short, petty, educational PowerPoint on how addressing a patient by their preferred title does NOT affect you as a person lol. \n\nWhat do y’all think? / How do you address transphobia in classmates?

As far as I can see, DPM's are simply physicians who are choosing to specialize right off the hop. And like I've seen others say.. no one wants to deal with feet anyways! So why not raise DPM's up and use them to support and enhance care?\n\nI'm sure I will get roasted but I just am trying to understand the nature of these frustrations.",

        "text": "M4 here still without a good ROL… In brief, it boils down to location (family) vs. Career. I dual-applied and programs of my preferred specialty are all out of state.   I’d move for residency without hesitation had I not been an only child whose aging parents need financial support. I’m from an immigrant family and the sacrifice is something I cannot just ignore…  Local programs are pretty decent on their own and I liked them when I rotated there. I think I will regret one way or the other regardless of which path I take here, be it feeling guilty for leaving my parents for career or foregoing an opportunity to be in the field I prefer to the other one.   I am here agonizing over this while my classmates are enjoying their freedom. I feel stuck…",

Some points are valid, but please for the love of god, stop the constant groaning about how residents aren’t your best friend and don’t let you go home at 4 PM every day. Or how some of your classmates are try-hards. You chose this field voluntarily and worked your ass off to get here. You knew exactly what you were getting into. Residents are under constant stress and don’t always remember to let your ass go home. Some of your classmates have different goals than practicing internal medicine in Noonegivesafuckville and are nervous about being perceived as lazy or unmotivated. I greatly appreciate the helpful advice that’s sometimes posted on this sub and the hilarious memes. But it seems like more and more nowadays, some of y’all act like you have it so bad. Boo hoo! you’re one of a few who made it to medical school and are intelligent enough to make it into such a prestigious and well-paying career. The amount of victim mentality I feel is palpable in this sub, when in reality, you’re probably a bunch of well-off bums.",

        "text": "So basically I am looking for a simple answer to help me understand something. \n\nI spend a lot of time studying and relocating snakes and I am having a hard time trying to understand the process of a certain venom affecting the human body. \n\nThe Eastern brown snake has 2 components to its venom. It has a strong neurotoxin affecting nerves etc. it also has a strong procoagulant affect. Now my understand is that this promotes certain proteins that cause the blood to begin clotting meaning the thickening of the blood right? \n\nSo how is it that we are being told that people can’t stop the internal bleeding from a Eastern brown snake bite. Wouldn’t there be less internal bleeding if it has a procoagulant affect? Wouldn’t this more likely cause clotting to the brain and heart etc? \n\nHow does one die from internal bleeding if the venom has a strong procoagulant toxin?",
