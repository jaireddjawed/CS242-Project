Many of her outfits remind me of kimono.\n* She **mixes textures**, making use of crisp linen, ethereal chiffon, soft knits, tough leather skirts. Her tidying method is quite tactile, so that makes sense.\n* She wears a lot of **wrap-style\/surplice necklines**.\n* She usually chooses silhouettes that are narrowest at the **natural waistline**, and usually wears **skirts\/dresses**.\n* She pretty much has one **signature hair and makeup look**: no-makeup-makeup, hair straight and worn down with a blunt fringe.\n\nWhat do you think of Marie Kondo's style? Personally, I love how it manages to feel minimalist - and yet she's clearly having a lot of fun playing with shape, drape, texture, folds, etc. She also seems to have a really cohesive personal style - all of the looks I could find pictures of her wearing seem like they'd fit together in a collection.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678575899.0},{"title":"Favorite places to buy weird\/unusual graphic tees?","author":"Serious-Muscle1093","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/femalefashionadvice\/comments\/11oyb8p\/favorite_places_to_buy_weirdunusual_graphic_tees\/","text":"A couple of brands that represent what I mean are Online Ceramics, Awake Happy, Outer Space Allies, and the original stuff from Fine Southern Gentlemen (also known as Feels So Good Prints).

But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t look modern and current, if that\u2019s what you want.

The straight cut jacket is long (sometimes even covering the butt), double-breasted, and can be oversized. The new crop of jackets are shorter, go in at the waist, and are either single button or have a single row of buttons, a la [Dior Bar Jacket](https:\/\/www.dior.com\/couture\/var\/dior\/storage\/images\/folder-media\/folder-productpage\/folder-crossselllook\/folder-femme\/folder-winter-22\/block-f_22_4_look_096\/35141174-1-eng-GB\/f_22_4_look_096_1440_1200.jpg). \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIf you feel like your office is too casual for a blazer, you can opt for a more casual material than the classic black suiting. Tweed is always a good choice, you can go for wool, and for a jacket that is patterned, rather than solid-colored. That\u2019s going to look less formal. Suit vests have also been very fashionable in recent years, and they can be a good alternative if a blazer feels too stuffy or is Too Much for your office. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n##The button down shirt\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSome examples:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[shirt 1](https:\/\/hips.hearstapps.com\/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/images\/plus-size-fashion-button-down-1660773267.jpg?crop=0.770xw:0.867xh;0.141xw,0.133xh&resize=980:*)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[shirt 2](https:\/\/40plusstyle.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/kimbajeans.jpg) \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[shirt 3](https:\/\/www.uptowngirl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/winter-work-outfits-24.jpg) \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nDespite what \u201ctimeless classics\u201d bloggers would have you believe, a (white) shirt is not, in fact, timeless. Nothing is. Allow me to explain. Yes, the concept of wearing a white shirt will never be \u201cdated\u201d because that\u2019s not how fashion works. An entire category of clothes rarely goes out of style. However, **the specific characteristics** of a shirt can, and do become outdated. Things like the shape and size of the collar, the cuffs, the buttons, and the length and the shape itself are all very specific to a certain era.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe \u201cclassic\u201d white shirt from 2003 is tight, short (because it was worn untucked), oftentimes with an oversized and pointy collar and cuffs. The \u201cclassic\u201d white shirt from 2010 is longer and straighter, with a tunic collar that does not button up, occasionally meant to be worn with a wide belt on top to emphasize the waist. It was meant to be worn untucked, on top of tight pants. The sleeves had tabs that buttoned up to keep your sleeves rolled up around elbow-level. There might have been some square pockets that were placed too high. We also saw more long, empire-waist tunic-type shirts in this 2008-2012-ish period. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \u201cclassic\u201d white shirt from 2023 is a generous cut that\u2019s long enough to tuck into your pants or skirt, but not long enough to cover your butt. It should end around your hip. That means that you can also wear it untucked, over your pants, without it looking frumpy. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSeeing as the fashion is moving towards tighter and shorter shirts (no, we\u2019re not talking about crop tops) to go with the wider bottoms, you can also expect to find more body-conforming shirts in the near future. Shirts with a marked waist, princess seams, and generally a variety of tops that go in at the waist.

Cropped, ankle length pants are still encountered, but usually in culotte, or wide styles, less so skinny pants. The high-waisted cigarette pants (or carrot leg, or peg leg) are still out there, but the style is meant to be a little roomier in the butt and thighs; the office is not the place for your tightest pair of pants. These often come in a paperbag waist style, which is very flattering on a lot of body types, as well as comfortable - because the belt is adjustable. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe rise is getting lower, however, as low rise is coming back into fashion, meaning that you should be able to find midrise and lowrise pants in wide cuts if that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been waiting for. That won\u2019t change much for footwear, but it might trigger some changes in terms of tops, depending on what styles you\u2019re wearing now. If you were used to tucking shirts into high waisted pants, a low waist doesn\u2019t allow for that. So, you probably need to rethink and re-strategize towards a top that sits untucked, at the top of the hips, for the most traditionally harmonious proportions. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nNowadays, a lot of pants have elasticated back waistbands, or even entirely elasticated waists or drawstring waists. [Office joggers exist](https:\/\/outfittrends.b-cdn.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/plus-size-interview-outfits-5.jpg.webp) for the new iteration of the more casual and relaxed post-pandemic office. Rises and cuts are encountered in generous varieties. There is no reason for a standard pair of slacks to be uncomfortable. And god, are there office pants of all varieties right now. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n(A quick note on fit: \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nEven without stretch, a pair of pants that fits well should not be uncomfortable, should not pinch you anywhere, dig into your stomach, or feel tight or constricting. Size up, go for a straight or wide leg if a tight leg is constricting, and try a higher or lower rise if your waistband cuts into your stomach. Do not purchase the smallest size you can fit into. Bosquerella did [an excellent write-up](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/femalefashionadvice\/comments\/s6ynwh\/psa_being_told_to_size_up_is_the_advice_you_asked) on the matter you can revisit if you need the reminder. Everyone deserves pants that fit. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWhatever type of rise you\u2019re searching for, I recommend measuring your ideal rise from between the legs and up to where you want it to hit, whether that\u2019s 11 inches, 14 inches, 8 inches, etc. Take a tape measure shopping if you have to. Measure the pants you\u2019re interested in or learn to eyeball it, the name of the style doesn\u2019t necessarily tell you anything about how they\u2019re going to fit ON YOU, because all our bodies are different. Depending on the length of your torso, you may need a different rise than the model does. Shop for your body.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n###Stretchy pants\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nLeggings have never exactly been business casual, and regardless of their debatable status, they\u2019re just not current anymore. Leggings just don\u2019t read as polished when paired with business casual clothes, and they require a high level of effort in every other aspect of the outfit in order to elevate them and make them presentable and current in the workplace. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe exception to this is an athleisure look in a workplace that is very casual and allows sportswear. Think tech or non client-facing roles in other industries. And speaking of leggings, let\u2019s address their ugly stepsister, ponte pants. Despite their misleading name, they do not look like pants, let\u2019s be honest. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nIf stretchy pants are your go-to, the much better - and more modern - option is a pair of straight leg athletic fabric pants. Straight leg or flared, usually with a front seam or crease and even equipped with pockets, this version at least attempts to mimic the look of regular pants. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n##The heels\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSome examples:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[heels 1](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/564x\/c3\/c0\/72\/c3c072c0a985db820ba609b7af676034.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[heels 2](https:\/\/www.girlsharestips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/blazer-outfit-ideas-for-women-31.jpeg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[heels 3](https:\/\/outfittrends.b-cdn.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/What-to-wear-with-Mary-Jane-platform-shoes-7.png)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n[heels 4](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/564x\/a6\/e0\/58\/a6e0583e3405f6b1888282c61a4a1b3c.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhile there are still plenty of industries and offices where heels are common or even explicitly required, they are becoming less and less expected. The current heel has changed both in height and in shape\/thickness. Thicker block heels are more current than stilettos. A patent, square mid heel will serve you well. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nHeeled mary-janes are currently the IT shoe, and there are variations on the strappy, mid heel style at many different price points. Usually patent - but also leather, for easier maintenance, or satin, for the high-maintenance dressers - mary janes are comfortable, versatile, inoffensive, and come in many different colors at the moment. Sole thickness differs, as does shape, but a lot of them follow the rounded square shape that is currently popular in footwear. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nBoots haven\u2019t gone anywhere, either. A block heel ankle or knee high boot can be perfectly appropriate for the office, as long as the heel isn\u2019t too high and they\u2019re not a very irreverent design. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n##The flats\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSome examples:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n[flats1](https:\/\/cdn.cliqueinc.com\/posts\/240923\/outfits-with-loafers-240923-1510005352188-image.900x0c.jpg?interlace=true&quality=70)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n[flats2](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/564x\/bd\/c7\/bf\/bdc7bff75a7ae2a355e0bc1787c6f7fb.jpg) \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n[flats3](https:\/\/image-prod.iol.co.za\/resize\/610x61000\/?source=https:\/\/xlibris.public.prod.oc.inl.infomaker.io:8443\/opencontent\/objects\/dd61310c-911d-54ba-94b4-b19c366e3d40&operation=CROP&offset=0x0&resize=564x634)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[flats4](https:\/\/www.girlsharestips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/blazer-outfit-ideas-for-women-46.jpeg\n)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[flats5](https:\/\/www.refinery29.com\/images\/8531673.jpg?format=webp&width=1090&height=1576&quality=85)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n[flats6](https:\/\/cdn.cliqueinc.com\/posts\/295430\/loafer-outfits-295430-1632513180794-image.900x0c.jpg?interlace=true&quality=70)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n[flats7](https:\/\/www.hoodmwr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/47.-Black-TankTop-Dark-Green-Midi-Skirt.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n[flats8](https:\/\/styleyouroccasion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/Chunky-Loafers-Outfit-@aaylingk-white-jeans-oversized-sweater.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n[flats9](https:\/\/www.girlsharestips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/blazer-outfit-ideas-for-women-1.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[flats10](https:\/\/cdn.cliqueinc.com\/posts\/295430\/loafer-outfits-295430-1632513181997-image.900x0c.jpg?interlace=true&quality=70)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere seems to be a disconnect in mentality where a lot of people think that \u201ctrendy\u201d shoes can\u2019t be comfortable. Dressing for comfort doesn\u2019t mean you need to wear basic shoes. I\u2019m about to say something that I know is upsetting for like, 70% of this sub, but it needs to be said: Rothys are not a modern shoe. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nMore supportive shoes are in style, thankfully, and a loafer is much more current and better for your feet. The Gucci-type loafer and the trend it sparked is a little more basic and doesn\u2019t stand out as much. It\u2019s less of a statement, and more of a supporting character in an outfit. The platform loafers, like the Prada ones, for example, are trendier, but they\u2019re also very comfortable. The thicker sole is very supportive and provides good shock absorption if you\u2019re going to be walking miles in them. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nIf you want to retain the ballet flat style, the modern ballet flat has a flatter, square shape and dance-inspired detailing that is meant to mimic actual ballet shoes. Pointed toe shoes are also coming back in fashion, and the most modern iteration of a pointed ballet flat is a slingback. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nMary-janes also have a strong presence among flat shoe styles. One, two, or multi-strap, in patent, leather or canvas, for summer, mary-janes are the perfect feminine, but sophisticated shoe that can work with a variety of outfits, including pants and skirts of varying lengths. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n##The bag\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSome examples:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[bag1]( https:\/\/media1.popsugar-assets.com\/files\/thumbor\/ByYC0ffWvIovhlI3jJRwW0UYX6U\/fit-in\/728xorig\/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-\/2023\/01\/18\/819\/n\/1922564\/aa18bcd363c83d01e97e45.87708689_\/i\/best-work-bags-women.png) \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n[bag2](https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0315\/0217\/2298\/files\/spring_480x480.jpg?v=1615309203)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n[bag3](https:\/\/i.etsystatic.com\/13418459\/r\/il\/1eae72\/4680793460\/il_794xN.4680793460_16rc.jpg) \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n[bag4](https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1337\/8601\/files\/Screen_Shot_2021-11-09_at_5.05.47_PM_480x480.png?v=1636499162)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nBags for the office can be tricky, because they oftentimes have to carry your whole life, but still remain professional-looking. That\u2019s one of the reasons why huge, unstructured bags like the LV Neverfull and the Longchamp Le Pliage were popular for so long - they\u2019re not cute, but they\u2019re practical. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThankfully, something even better came along, and that is the bizcas backpack. Carrying a laptop, your lunch, your water bottle, your umbrella, and your gym shoes on your shoulder is a one-way ticket to a messed up posture, health problems, and an expensive chiropractor bill. Choose comfort, practicality, *and* fashion by opting for a modern backpack, instead of a gaping nylon bag with thin straps that dig into your shoulder. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nLeather is the most elevated choice, but leather backpacks can be heavy, depending on size and construction, so take your time assessing the best material for your needs. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n###Fun\/casual\/out of the box alternatives\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n##The colorful suit\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nSome examples:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n[suit1]( https:\/\/imgix.bustle.com\/uploads\/image\/2019\/3\/20\/9d432bd6-1472-43d9-abe9-7e9b3b85b7db-53165368_819642411731554_6671121307143819952_n.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n[suit2](https:\/\/fashioncanons.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Powersuits-For-Women-Best-Street-Style-Looks-To-Copy-3-scaled.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n[suit3]( https:\/\/fashioncanons.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Powersuits-For-Women-Best-Street-Style-Looks-To-Copy-2-scaled.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n[suit4]( https:\/\/hips.hearstapps.com\/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/images\/plus-size-outfit-ideas-for-fall-aidy-bryant-suit-1626726422.jpg?crop=0.9102222222222222xw:1xh;center,top&resize=980:*)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n[suit5](https:\/\/www.refinery29.com\/images\/9518564.jpg?format=pjpg&auto=webp&resize-filter=lanczos2&quality=50&sharpen=a3%2Cr3%2Ct0&optimize=low&width=960)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n[suit6](https:\/\/fashioncanons.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/what-to-wear-over-powersuit-2.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n[suit7]( https:\/\/fashioncanons.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/Powersuits-For-Women-Best-Street-Style-Looks-To-Copy-1.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re in a more formal industry that still expects a suit, the best thing you can do for your work wardrobe is to get yourself a colorful one. Suiting is huge right now - and has been for a few years - so there is no shortage of office-appropriate options that won\u2019t bore you to death. Valentino pink is particularly prevalent as it\u2019s one of the hot colors of the season, but Bottega green is also in, and you can find an entire range of power colors to give you that extra pop. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nIf you\u2019d rather play it more subdued, there are plenty of pastel options to choose from. Softer, more feminine, but still 100% professional, pastel suits allow you to cheer up your office wardrobe, particularly for the spring and summer seasons, as these tend to come in summer-weight fabrics. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n##The interesting top\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSome examples:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n[top1](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/d2\/d4\/8e\/d2d48eb8a0571f48a6879de5934d25f7.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[top2](https:\/\/media.glamourmagazine.co.uk\/photos\/63f4f2dca2a28949d1e3e4f8\/master\/w_1600,c_limit\/WHITE%20SHIRTS%20%20210223%20GettyImages-1459378843.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[top3]( https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/closetfulofclothes.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/oversized-cuffs-frayed-denim-simiple-black-pumps-going-out-night-out-office-to-out-work-www.jpg?w=640&ssl=1)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[top4](https:\/\/outfittrends.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/white-shirt-outfits-7.png)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[top5](https:\/\/40plusstyle.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/juliejeans.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[top6](https:\/\/i1.adis.ws\/i\/boohooamplience\/bkk04786_red_xl?$product_image_category_page_horizontal_filters_desktop$)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0[top7](https:\/\/publish.purewow.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2019\/10\/black-jeans-outfit-blouse-and-block-heels.png?fit=728%2C921)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\nIf you want a look that\u2019s more elevated, but still retains the same basic neutral top + neutral bottoms formula, all you have to do is tweak the style of the shirt. You can still keep it white, or another neutral shade, but make sure there\u2019s an interesting design to it. You can play with shape - oversized, billowy, straight, cropped, voluminous, etc. - it\u2019s up to you and your preferences, design details - voluminous sleeves, interesting neckline details, contrasting trims or buttons, etc., material - silk, linen, satin (very current), which also impact drape and silhouette. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAgain, color is not something you need to shy away from in the workplace, especially if you\u2019re going to pair it with neutrals. There is nothing about colorful clothes that is inherently unprofessional (unless you work at a funeral home). If a top is professional in white, it\u2019s also professional in blue, or magenta. A \u201cspicy\u201d shirt can be the visual interest you need in an otherwise drab work outfit. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n##The midi skirt\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nSome examples:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[midi 1](https:\/\/images.squarespace-cdn.com\/content\/v1\/62d1ac8b005fcb0457a8d85f\/1673157327421-NKD71A84YLVYYHVJ3TZQ\/maxi+skirts+-+%40SYLVIEMUS_.jpg?format=2500w)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[midi 2](https:\/\/cdn.cliqueinc.com\/posts\/296426\/best-skirts-on-amazon-296426-1637044862836-image.900x0c.jpg?interlace=true&quality=70)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[midi 3](https:\/\/www.girlsharestips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/blazer-outfit-ideas-for-women-43.jpeg) \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[midi 4](https:\/\/publish.purewow.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2023\/01\/all-black-winter-outfits-midi-skirt-and-cropped-knit.jpg?fit=1360%2C1852)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[midi 5](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/7d\/2a\/4f\/7d2a4fe239f4bb750290c70138b01aa1.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[midi 6](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.peopleandstyles.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/side-slit-skirts-sexy-update-to-your-wear-to-work-look-street-style-peopleandstyles-4.jpg?fit=700%2C1118)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n[midi 7](https:\/\/www.girlsharestips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/blazer-outfit-ideas-for-women-44.jpeg) \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[midi 8](https:\/\/blog.petitedressing.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/loafers-17-473x1024.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nYou may have noticed that in recent years, THE skirt\/dress length has been the midi. Reaching around mid calf, the midi oftentimes has a medium to long leg slit. BUT there are simpler and less sexy versions for the office. The shape is straight or conical, rather than the A-line accordion pleated midis we saw around 2016. However, it\u2019s not the tight pencil skirt shape of the 2010s, either. Think more body-skimming, rather than a spandex-y bodycon. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to being very current, the midi is very office-friendly because of the conservative length. It goes great with heels, but it also looks good with flats, especially the more modern chunky shoes. A midi skirt can be worn with a classic button-up shirt, or a thin turtleneck, a chunky knit, a t-shirt for more casual offices, and it can even be taken out for drinks or shopping after work or on the weekend. A very versatile piece that can work hard in your wardrobe for the next few years. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe danger with a long skirt is to not veer into frumpy, church-y territory. If you\u2019re going for a midi look, I recommend styling it in a very intentional way, with some very modern accessories. A midi skirt with a thin-soled ballet shoe from 2012 and a long, thin cardigan might look frumpy and awkward, but a midi with a chunky loafer and an oversized blazer looks like an intentional outfit. Same with boots - forego the heeled low cut ankle boot and instead, opt for a chunky knee-high boot. It can also look very chic with a longer, oversized, chunky knit.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAnother way to make sure it\u2019s not reading frumpy is to pick a modern fabric. Leather skirts are very in right now, as are satin slip-style skirts. In the right cut and in a high-quality material, they can be professional, while still remaining stylish. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n##The sneakers\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSome examples:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[sneakers1](https:\/\/media.theeverygirl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/sneakers-office-outfits-the-everygirl-gallery.png)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[sneakers2](https:\/\/st.mngbcn.com\/rcs\/pics\/static\/T8\/fotos\/outfit\/S20\/87042882_99-99999999_01.jpg?ts=1606300544915&imwidth=1318&imdensity=2)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[sneakers3](https:\/\/www.girlsharestips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/blazer-outfit-ideas-for-women-47.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[sneakers4](https:\/\/thecurvyfashionista.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/105_2668-e1570820739508.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n[sneakers5](https:\/\/cdn.cliqueinc.com\/posts\/250786\/sneaker-outfits-250786-1618362772906-main.900x0c.jpg?interlace=true&quality=70)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[sneakers6](https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1142\/0618\/files\/Plaid_Blazer_From_Luxe_With_Love_large.jpg?v=1546990199)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[sneakers7](https:\/\/i.styleoholic.com\/2018\/07\/05-a-powder-blue-suit-a-white-tee-white-sneakers-and-a-silver-bag.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[sneakers8](https:\/\/thecurvyfashionista.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/AirMaxDay-PrettyplusPep4-e1570820149282.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[sneakers9](https:\/\/cdn.cliqueinc.com\/posts\/250786\/sneaker-outfits-250786-1618362217881-main.900x0c.jpg?interlace=true&quality=70)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nThe main aspect people appreciate about wearing sneakers is that they are comfortable. But if you\u2019re looking to update your work wardrobe, you should know that Allbirds-style shoes are an outdated style. A black pair *could* be somewhat neutral, especially combined with a [chic, modern all-black outfit](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/20\/30\/1a\/20301a413d025332047845afbb6871c8.jpg). \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nBut there are equally comfortable sneakers out there that are sleeker, more modern, and more professional. You don\u2019t have to wear the chunky dad sneakers your 15 year-old is wearing, but a sleek, white sneaker with a clean shape that\u2019s not overly stylized or embellished is a perfectly respectable choice that will bring your work style closer to 2023. No synthetic mesh, please.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nIf you feel like white is too stark and stands out too much as an athletic shoe, black is always a safe choice. If you can afford to be really daring in a casual office, you can even try a pair of platform converse. They\u2019re not just more current, but they\u2019re also much more comfortable, because the sole isn\u2019t as thin and lacking in support as the classic version. Plus you get a tiny bit of height, even without heels. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n##The jeans\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\nSome examples:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n[jeans1](https:\/\/cdn.cliqueinc.com\/posts\/248544\/cute-outfits-with-black-jeans-248544-1603664436620-image.900x0c.jpg?interlace=true&quality=70) \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n[jeans2](https:\/\/publish.purewow.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2019\/10\/black-jeans-outfit-white-trench-and-white-boots.png?fit=728%2C921)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[jeans3](https:\/\/i.styleoholic.com\/2019\/04\/a-white-shirt-blue-straight-jeans-leopard-print-slingbacks-and-a-black-bag-two-trends-incorporated-in-one-outfit.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[jeans4](https:\/\/www.girlsharestips.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/blazer-outfit-ideas-for-women-37.jpeg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[jeans5](https:\/\/cdn.cliqueinc.com\/posts\/298687\/best-spring-outfits-with-jeans-298687-1647919863790-main.900x0c.jpg?interlace=true&quality=70)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJeans in the workplace were once a hotly debated matter and it may still depend entirely on your specific office. But in a post-covid world, where so many are reluctant to even go back to the office at all, dress codes have relaxed and jeans are more prevalent than ever before. And why shouldn\u2019t they be? A good rule of thumb for wearing jeans in the office is to stick to a pair that is non-distressed, and solid-colored. No rips, stone washing, or fading and whiskering. Black, dark blue, or mid-blue are all okay colors. Maybe even white, in the summer. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nFor an updated outfit, the new styles of jeans are all very workplace-friendly, because they don\u2019t cling to the body so tightly like skinny jeans did, so they\u2019re not emphasizing anything that an old white man might be offended by or overly taken by. There is no reason why a pair of straight leg or wide leg jeans shouldn\u2019t pair great with a shirt, a sweater, a blazer, and a pair of loafers for a casual office environment. I\u2019d stick to jeans that are actually hemmed, and not distressed, but at the same time, your legs are mostly under a desk, so only you know what you can get away with!\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n#Modernize your office fit\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nFinally, let\u2019s look at some typical, average office fits you\u2019d see 10 years ago, and how we can retain the same basic, reliable structure, but with updated pieces. Allow me to remind you that we don\u2019t need to throw out the clothes in the outdated examples and replace them all with clothes from the updated ones! You can get more mileage out of your clothes if you mix and match with some more modern pieces. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n##sweater + black pants\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[do this](https:\/\/www.uptowngirl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/winter-work-outfits-22.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[instead of this](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/736x\/e0\/52\/52\/e05252880ffbc9de47d0d72033d07b7c.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe cut matters so much in an outfit, as you can see in these examples. We\u2019re still retaining the exact same formula, but we\u2019re simply updating the pieces. While it\u2019s still a big, oversized gray sweater, the style becomes chunkier, with balloon sleeves. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nThe black pants are flared instead of skinny, which is a more modern cut. The boots aren\u2019t almond-toe, but pointed, and they match the other light-colored accessories. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##\u00a0long top\/sweater + leggings + flats\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n[do this](http:\/\/ladyfashioniser.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/white-sweater-black-leggings-and-white-sneakers.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n[instead of this](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/736x\/b3\/ed\/8d\/b3ed8da6fad744de166065922a46f009--gray-flats-outfit-light-grey-cardigan-outfit.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your office is casual enough, you may still be able to get away with wearing leggings. Rather than pairing them with ballet flats, opt for a pair of sleek sneakers. You can still keep the white shirt and the knit format, but update to a chunky knit sweater, instead of the thin cardigan. Accessorizing with a big scarf indoors is unnecessary, unless it\u2019s cold. If you want to keep the accent scarf, opt for a thinner silk square scarf, instead. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##top + cardigan + slacks\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[do this](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/1e\/39\/7f\/1e397fbcc564ef0395c88b3c3df5bf10.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[instead of this](http:\/\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-z5FdCuw0TyM\/TWdElnUTTGI\/AAAAAAAAB9w\/J-V_gOspc5M\/s1600\/022411-4.JPG)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThis is a great example of how you can still wear your long cardigans in a much more modern fit. If you look at the first example, that short, tight cardigan on top of a tight top makes it look like the cardigan doesn\u2019t fit her properly; it\u2019s straining on her body. That\u2019s never a flattering fit. The looser cardigan with a more generous cut in the second example allows for a more comfortable fit. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe belt is present in both examples for waist emphasis, but tucking the top inside the pants rather than letting it hang on top is an instant update you can easily make to your everyday fit. If you prefer an untucked top, that\u2019s perfectly fine, but choose a looser fit and not a tight jersey top. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAccessories also irrevocably date an outfit. The chunky statement jewelry can easily be swapped for simpler pieces that subtly enhance and highlight, rather than being the focus of your overall fit. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n##sweater + jeans\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[do this](https:\/\/media.nastygal.com\/i\/nastygal\/agg08273_black_xl_1\/plus-size-slouchy-v-neck-sweater-vest)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[instead of this](https:\/\/www.brightontheday.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Grey-Mock-Neck-Turtleneck-Black-Jeans-and-Black-Tory-Burch-Riding-Boots-Fall-Outfit-11-700x1050.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re gonna do a knit with jeans for work, you can easily update the look. Swap the skinnies for a pair of straight leg jeans. The riding boots or ankle boots can be changed into combat boots or a chunky pair of oxfords, and the knit can be swapped for a chunkier, either cropped or oversized sweater. Or you can opt for an oversized knit vest. It\u2019s worn over a t-shirt in this example, but it works beautifully over a long-sleeved button-up shirt, or even over a tight turtleneck. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n##dark suit + heels\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[do this](https:\/\/hips.hearstapps.com\/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com\/images\/plus-size-fashion-power-suit-1660766422.jpg?crop=0.927xw:0.952xh;0.0578xw,0.0314xh&resize=980:*)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n[or this](https:\/\/fashioncanons.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/what-to-wear-over-powersuit-2.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[instead of this](https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1025\/3059\/products\/WOMENS_NAVY_BLUE_SUIT_036_51c1e0f1-384d-4569-bd0b-695b1f13e0bf_2000x2000_crop_center.jpg.webp?v=1638400888)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe basic suit has changed shape, with slim ankle pants being less current than straight, long pants with a crease. The blazer is longer, less fitted, and more oversized, and the heels have more of a square toe (or a more elongated point), rather than the short pointed heel in the first example. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n##white shirt + jeans + flats\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n[do this](https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/jqDC0bKaxxG3Togz_oLEnW48CgjcOGfi4h3joL6SF6uUZl_2hA_H6mtR2WsE2y-YoKSCc99O9ogPjm1RifWAIVVqJA=w500-rw)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n[instead of this](https:\/\/www.stylevore.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/241e22a6af50863e4311a0cbf48fdf26.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAs you can see, sometimes it\u2019s just a matter of styling. The two examples aren\u2019t that different, just slightly updated. The jeans are no longer skinny, but straight-cut. It\u2019s still a style that conforms to your shape, just more modern and less constricting. The shirt is tucked into the jeans, instead of a long, untucked shirt. We still keep flat shoes, but we choose something with a platform. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, opting for minimal jewelry over the chunky, statement necklaces will instantly make your otufit feel fresher and more modern. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you found this helpful, check out the previous post on updating skinny jeans & new jean styles to try: \n\u00a0https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/femalefashionadvice\/comments\/11cp9nb\/your_wardrobe_is_outdated_what_now_step_1_skinny\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1678309154.0},{"title":"Daily Questions Thread - March 09, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/femalefashionadvice\/comments\/11mvvi2\/daily_questions_thread_march_09_2023\/","text":"This thread is for individual style questions that you may have, especially those that don't warrant their own thread.

I saw this concern voiced many times in the outdated jean post.\n\nSpecific issues I\u2019ve had are as follows, which seems to be similar issues mentioned in the comments of the aforementioned post:\n\n1. I just cannot do heels bc of my foot anatomy. At most I could swing a chunky 1\u201d.\n2. What are acceptable, modern\/trendy shoes to wear as a step up from say, the basic white chunky tennis shoe or funky combat boot - when trying to dress up jeans (that aren\u2019t heels)?\n3. A step beyond that, what are current non heeled dress\/formal shoes?\n4. What are alternatives to the basic ankle boot that are more trendy\/modern?\n\nIn general, I find I cannot fit my feet into most cute shoes (very wide feet) \u2026 which is the biggest issue, and the rules out most shoes. I\u2019ve never been the girl to walk into a shoes store and slip on any shoe. Alongside that, I have ugly feet so closed toed are always my go to, despite living in a hot, humid climate. That\u2019s more of a personal rant, but also hopeful someone may have advice here as well.\n\nAny suggestions on the above are appreciated, and any additional discussion welcome!\n\nEdit: Wow!

Is your wardrobe a little tired? Are the fashionable styles increasingly different from your own wardrobe? Is the last time you went shopping 10 years ago? Do you find yourself uttering the phrase \u201ccold dead hands\u201d in the same sentence as \u201cskinny jeans\u201d?\n\u00a0\n\n\nYou might be a Millennial with an outdated wardrobe. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s not a sin - if you still feel fun, fresh, and comfortable in your wardrobe, that\u2019s cool, and feel free to click away. No one\u2019s taking away your skinny jeans. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nIf, however, you\u2019re wondering how to update your wardrobe, make it feel a little fresher, and look more current, then you\u2019re in the right place. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe important thing to know is that a wardrobe update doesn\u2019t mean that you need to throw away all your clothes and start over - unless that\u2019s what you desire. You can update some key pieces and restyle some old ones in order to refresh your wardrobe and keep up with the times. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nThe other thing to keep in mind is that wanting to be more current, and updating your wardrobe doesn\u2019t mean you need to dress like a teenager. Nor does wanting a current wardrobe mean you\u2019re desperately trying to look 20. It\u2019s about being interested in style and wanting to remain current, stylish, and even - god forbid - trendy. Being interested in fashion and wanting to look modern isn\u2019t just for the kids.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#Step 1 - Skinny jeans\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nWe all know why you\u2019re here, skinny jeans and your cold dead hands. Skinny jeans have become somewhat of a security blanket for a lot of people. It was the dominant silhouette for so long, and a lot of our wardrobes have been created around that. However, just like your college boyfriend, just because it\u2019s comfortable and you met them when you were 20, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re married to them until you die. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##Keeping your skinnies\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, no one is forcing anyone to give up their skinny jeans. Contrary to popular belief, the trend police will not break into your house to take them away, and your cold dead hands are safe, they needn\u2019t be deployed. If you\u2019re not going to replace them, then you can use a different styling approach. Styling them the same way you have been for 15 years will inevitably feel stale and old-fashioned. But that can be remedied by making some changes and tweaking other elements in your wardrobe. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re wearing skinny jeans,\n\u00a0\n\n##Don\u2019t do this:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are examples that *together* create looks that can feel a little stale, old-fashioned, and less than fresh. Just like skinny jeans, it doesn\u2019t mean that you have to throw away these things, but maybe don\u2019t style them together, in the exact same way you did in 2010. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n###1 Low\/mid waist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nExample: [low rise look](https:\/\/akns-images.eonline.com\/eol_images\/Entire_Site\/201634\/rs_634x1024-160404113513-634.Lauren-Conrad-Lo-Rise-Skinny-jeans.jl.040416.jpg?fit=around%7C776:1254&output-quality=90&crop=776:1254;center,top) \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, what\u2019s wrong with low\/mid-rise? And wait, isn\u2019t low rise coming back in style? Yes, it is. Just not in skinny jeans. When the pants style changes (every 15 to 20 years), that usually brings a change in silhouette. In this case, we have moved from skinny bottom, oversized top, to skinny top, oversized bottom. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn that case, wearing a slim, cropped shirt and low-rise, wide-leg pants is an outfit with a nice balance, that is meant to emphasize the midriff. Wearing the same cropped outfit with low-rise skinny jeans throws off the visual balance and just ends up looking like you\u2019ve outgrown your clothes because both elements are tight.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeing as tucking a shirt in or wearing a more cropped, boxy top is currently in style, that also poses a problem with mid or low rises, because they are [very awkward to tuck into](https:\/\/c4.staticflickr.com\/6\/5460\/30851893355_a148f001a1_o.jpg). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce again, it disrupts the proportions and the visual balance. Tucking into low or mid rise skinny pants forces a 50\/50 proportion that is both unnatural and not out of left field enough to be avant-garde. It\u2019s [just awkward](https:\/\/www.herstylecode.com\/2021\/04\/how-to-style-low-rise-jeans-low-rise-jeans-outfit-ideas-for-women_herstylecode-1.jpg). \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###2 Tunics\/long sweaters\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: [tunic top look](https:\/\/www.puttingmetogether.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/maroon-tunic-leopard-scarf-fall-outfit-03-2-scaled.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nAgain, an issue of silhouette. Wearing skinny jeans with a tunic is probably your comfort zone, and while there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, it\u2019s not going to read as modern or stylish. If that\u2019s your goal, then I\u2019d avoid pairing skinnies with any kind of long top. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSkinny jeans and a nice top\u201d can still be your go-to, but consider updating the style of the top. A top with more structure and more waist emphasis will read more modern than a long, loose, shapeless top. If you\u2019re still keen on covering the derriere, then a boxy, oversized sweater or top with structure is a fresher alternative. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###3 Thin long cardigans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nExample: [look with long cardigan](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/79\/c1\/24\/79c124f9856b1b5e0e9503de421c234d.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nCardigans made out of thin materials have never been especially flattering, because they tend to cling. It also makes it difficult to layer underneath them. The slimmer and thinner the cardigan, the bulkier the layers under it. A long, unstructured cardigan over skinny jeans is also an outdated silhouette. There are still duster cardigans out there, but they\u2019re heavier, chunkier, and a little more oversized, occasionally with a tie waist. They allow layering and look more structured and less boho. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###4 Ballet flats\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nExample: [ballet flat outfit](https:\/\/jljbacktoclassic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/Janis-Lyn-Johnson-Talbots-Denim-Shirt-Louis-Vuitton-Speedy.png)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrab your tutus, ballet flats are actually coming back into fashion. But paired with skinny jeans, the look is straight out of 2010. Thin soles and light, \u201cnothing\u201d-type shoes are definitely not the freshest style (yes, that includes Rothys, but that\u2019s a conversation for next time), but they can still be passable with a more modern pants cut - preferably something straight or wide leg, and cropped. [The new ballet flats](https:\/\/www.vogue.co.uk\/fashion\/article\/ballet-pumps-ss23) are also more dance-inspired, with specific detailing, so the round toe Tory Burch flats from 2008 are not exactly cutting edge. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###5 Low ankle boots\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nExample: [low ankle boots outfit](https:\/\/cdn.lookastic.com\/looks\/vest-turtleneck-skinny-jeans-large-36449.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nLike ballet flats, the time of low ankle boots has come and gone. Once, skinny jeans and ankle boots were the power couple of the early 2010s, now it\u2019s just what middle-aged moms wear out to date night at Cheesecake Factory. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with any of that! But the ankle boot has also had a makeover - the shaft is higher, the heel is thicker, and the sole is chunkier. The Cheesecake Factory regulars won\u2019t know what hit them.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n###6 Tight knee high\/OTK boots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nExample: [OTK boots look](https:\/\/www.stylecraze.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/12\/13.-With-Skinny-Jeans-And-Knee-Length-Boots.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nI know skinny jeans and slim over the knee boots go together like peanut butter and jelly. And they did - for years and years. Which is precisely why that particular combination will read as dated. You can still keep both, just change up the styling, and don\u2019t pair them together. Knee high boots are back in style, but instead of a 2010s slim riding boot, it\u2019s [a wider, more generous cut with a chunkier sole](https:\/\/sheerluxe.com\/sites\/sheerluxe\/files\/styles\/square_small\/public\/articles\/2021\/10\/chunky-boots-trend-hero.jpg?itok=rJyQxw3y). The OTK boots can also still be worn, but rather with a mini skirt\/dress, a slim midi skirt, or a pair of winter-weight shorts, like leather or tweed. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n###7 Graphic tees\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nExample: [graphic t-shirt look](https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0225\/2669\/articles\/starshell_birthday_girl_birthday_outfit_birthday_gift_247941b9-86e8-431e-bffd-173b156bc815_2048x.png)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf anything in your house or wardrobe says \u201cLive, Laugh, Love\u201d, I urge you to get rid of it immediately. Same with any saying related to coffee or the word \u201cvibe\u201d. You\u2019ll thank me later. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t wear graphic t-shirts with skinny jeans. I\u2019m saying the type of graphic t-shirt has changed a lot over the last 15 years. The slim fit, tiny sleeve crew neck t-shirts with flowery Etsy font is dead, you can downgrade it to the shirts you wear when you\u2019re cleaning or painting. So is the thin, loose, cropped, 80s t-shirt that says \u201cBridesmaid\u201d. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, an oversized and boxy, OR straight fit t-shirt is [the more modern and current option](https:\/\/nybreaking.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/1674890613_542_Levis-CEO-says-skinny-jeans-are-brands-biggest-sellers-despite.jpg). Neither long nor short, neither wide nor tight, a comfortably loose t-shirt with a regular short sleeve is a perfect basic, non-offensive choice for any woman of any age. If it has to have a graphic, make it a band tee. Not something that says \u201cNamaste\u201d. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n###8 Big slouchy bags\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nExample: [big purse outfit](https:\/\/www.puttingmetogether.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/whitelushtunicoldnavydistressedjeansoutfit01-683x1024.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LV Neverfull is a practical bag, I know, but wearing it with cropped skinny jeans and ballet flats looks like you\u2019re cosplaying Christian Girl Autumn 10 years too late. A canvas tote bag is a more modern choice, or a sleek leather backpack. You\u2019ve got both the comfort and the style. For smaller bags and needs, an uncertain-shaped cross-body is also going to date your outfit. Try to be more intentional with the bag choice and shape. Something more structured, with a top handle (as well as a cross body strap) is a fresher choice. Or a small, perhaps embellished, backpack.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##Do this instead:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would like to first preface this by saying that you do not have to do ALL of these. These are also not mandates. They\u2019re options. I picked a few different categories where updating other elements of your outfit can make skinny jeans feel less stale in 2023, something for everyone. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n###1 High waist\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nExample: [high-waisted look]\n(https:\/\/media.theeverygirl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/the-everygirl-skinny-jeans-900-1200.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nUpdating the rise is the easiest way to bring your skinnies into 2023. A higher rise gives you some new and modern styling options, including tucking tops into your jeans or wearing tops that are more cropped - t-shirts, shirts, blouses, hoodies, jackets - they all look better with a higher rise to balance out the silhouette. High waisted jeans make your legs look longer, they emphasize the waist, and are comfortable to sit in, since the waist should hit at your natural waist, *above* your stomach, and not cutting into it. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###2 Full length hems\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nExample: [full length skinnies outfit](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/736x\/ee\/b0\/3a\/eeb03a9805920ee1f91b3691b833b5b0.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAnother style element that betrays the age of your skinny jeans is that outdated, scrunched or cropped look. This may very well be a matter of opinion, but cropped skinny jeans don\u2019t work as well as other cropped styles. Because they\u2019re so tight, it visually strangles your calf instead of highlighting the ankle and has the opposite effect. The overly long, scrunched look is not just outdated, it\u2019s a sign your jeans don\u2019t fit well. Petites, hem your skinny jeans - or buy the cropped ones as full length). Full length skinnies have a more streamlined look and work better with any type of shoe. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###3 Belts\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nExample: [belted skinnies look](https:\/\/cdn.lookastic.com\/looks\/dress-shirt-skinny-jeans-bandana-original-32420.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nA high rise goes great with a belt, both to highlight your waist - if that\u2019s the look you\u2019re after - and to serve as an extra accessory and styling device. Belting your jeans can tie in your shoes or bag in a nice way, or it can visually break up a fit that needs a little extra something-something. Be advised that belting a pair of pants that do not sit at your waist will emphasize your hips or stomach, so if you\u2019re not keen on making that area seem wider, then avoid belting and\/or tucking into mid or low rise bottoms.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###4 Cropped cardigans\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nExample: [boxy cardi look](https:\/\/cdn.cliqueinc.com\/posts\/291678\/madewell-basics-reviews-291678-1613597254143-image.700x0c.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s time to let go of this weird notion that a cropped silhouette is only for 15 year-olds. A cropped top, shirt, cardigan, jacket, etc. is simply a change in silhouette and proportion and it does not - I repeat, it does *not* mean that you\u2019re necessarily showing off your midriff or that it\u2019s a strictly \u201cyouthful\u201d style. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key to incorporating a cropped element is to pair it with high rise bottoms - in this case, your skinnies. Styling them with an opposite style cardigan - short and bulky, instead of long and thin - automatically freshens up the look and brings them into 2023. High rise + crop shirt is an excellent way to emphasize the waist or create an hourglass or pear silhouette. Like a belt, the \u201cbreak\u201d in the outfit can be a much needed styling element to take the outfit from basic to stylish. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###5 Oversized blazers\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nExample: [oversized blazer outfit](https:\/\/media.vogue.mx\/photos\/62155a20700ff81dbaf0137a\/master\/pass\/skinny-jeans-con-botas-modelos-street-style.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaise your hand if you wore skinny jeans, low cut ankle boots and a blazer in 2010. I\u2019m not knocking it, it\u2019s a good look, but when worn all together, it dates you. But you can update the look by swapping out the blazer with a more current, oversized style. An oversized blazer vs. a shorter, slimmer fit one from the 2010s makes great contrast with the tightness of the pants and it gives the outfit a cooler, slightly masculine edge. While an all-tight outfit can look a little try-hard, an oversized element makes it a little cooler and more modern. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###6 Tucked in tops\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nExample: [tucked in look](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/08\/92\/c7\/0892c747539c951a79e3513520cc55b0.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTucking is one of my favorite styling choices and I can\u2019t find much fault with it. In fact, it may very well make skinny jeans look modern. Like belts and crop tops, tucking in a shirt achieves the same waist emphasis we\u2019re going for and it pulls away from the outdated lowrise + muffin top + long shirt look of the 2010s. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###7 Chunky shoes\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: [platform boots look](https:\/\/tokyofashion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Plaid-Unif-Dr-Martens-Harajuku-20160319DSC5961.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShoes can totally transform an outfit, including taking it from 2013 to 2023. No one\u2019s trying to take away your heeled ankle boots, but consider pairing those with a cropped straight leg instead, and swap them out for a pair of chunky loafers or platform boot in a skinny jean outfit.

Square necklines are extremely flattering on everyone and can be the one feature on an otherwise completely basic top that can have long sleeves or be tucked into the pants, etc. As for sweaters, [bulky wins over slim fitting](https:\/\/bergereinrock.files.wordpress.com\/2014\/10\/inspirations-fall-mood-grey-knit-steetstyle-theworldofbergere.jpg) for a modern look. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n##Alternatives to skinny jeans\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to move on and see what else is out there, then a world of new styles awaits you. You\u2019ll be surprised at how much variety and excitement you can add to your wardrobe with one simple jean style swap. The beautiful thing about transitional periods in fashion is that there\u2019s something for everybody. There is no primary cut or style, so you can find anything. Slim, baggy, wide leg, bell bottoms, bootcuts, high rise, low, or mid, it\u2019s all out there, and you can make any of them work for you. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###Straight leg jeans\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA good alternative are straight leg jeans and pants - the shape is not a huge departure from your usual, while still being more modern. Straight leg jeans still allow for some of your longer tops to be worn without looking baggy from top to bottom, you can still wear them with higher boots if you want, and they\u2019re not very adventurous, which means they\u2019re never the focus of the outfit itself. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey can play it safe and be quietly understated to support other, more interesting design elements, whether it\u2019s a big sleeve, a bold color, a collar, a ruffle, interesting buttons, or other detailing on your top, coat, or accessories. This style can still be successfully worn with a boxier or longer sweater, for example, without looking outdated. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [straight leg 1](https:\/\/cdn.themomedit.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Mom-JEeans-683x1024.jpg)\n\n\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [straight leg 2](https:\/\/media.glamour.com\/photos\/5e74fa8beb9d3c0008bb0819\/master\/w_2214,h_3100,c_limit\/GettyImages-1159253514.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [straight leg 3](https:\/\/www.datocms-assets.com\/39109\/1657276378-french-girl.jpeg?auto=format&fit=max&w=1200)\n\n\n\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [straight leg 4](https:\/\/www.uniqlo.com\/in\/en\/news\/topics\/2021011201\/img\/mimg_1_l.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [straight leg 5](https:\/\/publish.purewow.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2019\/10\/black-jeans-outfit-blouse-and-block-heels.png?resize=720%2C780)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n###Mom jeans\n\n\n\n\n\nMom jeans are the cut that largely replaced skinny jeans back in 2015-2016. Favored because they\u2019re very high waisted, with more room in the hips, and a flattering, conical shape, they are as comfortable as they are durable, owing to their rigid, 100% cotton fabric. However, because of the lack of elastane in their composition, mom jeans are trickier to size, so a few shopping trips may be necessary. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nFor skinny jeans wearers, the familiar thing with mom jeans is that they retain the high waist, and you\u2019re still showing off your shoes, as they\u2019re closely cut around the ankle, and usually a little cropped. Like straight leg jeans, an oversized, untucked top can still look good and fresh with this cut because of the conical shape. They slim down towards the ankle, giving the leg a little shape that contrasts with the baggy top, if you don\u2019t want to go for a loose-on-loose silhouette. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nExample:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [mom jeans 1](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/myparisianlife.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/french-white-button-down-shirt.jpg?resize=467%2C700&ssl=1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [mom jeans 2](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/d8\/4f\/9f\/d84f9fee8f9989809b50348b5dba85ab.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [mom jeans 3](https:\/\/shodamia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/06\/Mon-jeans-outfit-1.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [mom jeans 4](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/originals\/56\/22\/aa\/5622aa2a872572dfc986c7a918d9ccd1.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [mom jeans 5](https:\/\/i.styleoholic.com\/2022\/10\/a-simple-and-classy-fall-look-with-a-mellow-yellow-jumper-blue-mom-jeans-white-sneakers-and-a-burgundy-backpack.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###Wide leg jeans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other prominent cut that arose in the meantime are wide leg jeans, which are very much a total departure from skinny jeans, in terms of shape and style. However, they have become extremely popular, even among older Millennials, because they\u2019re very comfortable. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh waisted, with a lot of room in the hips and leg, wide leg jeans allow for free movement and completely eliminate the constricted feeling skinny jeans can sometimes be guilty of. Usually cropped, they still allow you to show off your shoes, and are surprisingly versatile. They can be successfully worn with boots, sandals, loafers, birks, heels, or flats - they go with pretty much anything. Personally, I prefer them with boots. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [wide leg jeans 1](https:\/\/styleyouroccasion.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/How-To-Style-Wide-Leg-Jeans-@netaporter-1-e1656534096432.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [wide leg jeans 2](https:\/\/images.summitmedia-digital.com\/preview\/images\/2021\/12\/02\/1-wide-leg-denim-jeans-iamsarahkim.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [wide leg jeans 3](https:\/\/media1.popsugar-assets.com\/files\/thumbor\/CtMFUkN5Sg83e2znNky6Pci0uPk\/fit-in\/2048xorig\/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-\/2019\/08\/28\/184\/n\/1922564\/58c3987ef7d35be6_GettyImages-1148477031\/i\/Style-Your-T-Shirt-With-Jeans-Sandals.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [wide leg jeans 4](https:\/\/media.vogue.fr\/photos\/5c360f59fd49f65e3bca73d1\/master\/w_2580%2Cc_limit\/paris_fw_day9__20181002_3500_jpg_1091_jpeg_7543.jpeg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [wide leg jeans 5](https:\/\/cdn.cliqueinc.com\/posts\/286637\/what-shoes-to-wear-with-wide-leg-jeans-286637-1586289116851-image.700x0c.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n###Flared jeans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, you can also obtain some of the same effects as skinnies with bootcut or flared pants. When you think about it, flared pants aren\u2019t all that different. Yes, the flare at the bottom is a change in silhouette and it\u2019s more visual interest than you\u2019re used to having with pants. However, the top is very much still the same fit as skinny jeans, if what you\u2019re concerned about is losing a \u201cflattering\u201d shape around your waist\/butt\/thighs. Flares tend to be the same skinny shape on top, and still have elastane. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only thing you\u2019re trading in is the way you\u2019re pairing your shoes. The longer hems visually elongate the legs, but they do usually cover the shoes, so more thought will need to be put into that. Heels work best paired with flared pants, but with the chunky, platform styles of today, flats can also be worn successfully with bootcut and flared, and wide leg pants, even without dragging and stepping on your hems.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [flared jeans 1](https:\/\/www.pinterest.com\/pin\/looksmodafashion--825566175459560011\/)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [flared jeans 2](https:\/\/i.styleoholic.com\/2021\/08\/a-simple-work-outfit-with-a-black-chunky-knit-sweater-black-flare-jeans-and-boots-and-a-black-tote.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [flared jeans 3](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/750x\/f8\/1e\/9b\/f81e9b123ded9572bbbcffb608ee81ca.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [flared jeans 4](https:\/\/chasingdaisiesblog.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/0b597f63f4505c92e53ca195d0672e3a.jpg.webp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [flared jeans 5](https:\/\/i.pinimg.com\/564x\/dd\/4e\/d6\/dd4ed6ca88831fd9d3d63415e4ab8ec6.jpg)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019d also like to make a note that hair, makeup, and general styling (like jewelry) also make a big impact in the way outfits are perceived. With a modern, intentional haircut, any outfit automatically reads are more stylish, instead of just the first thing you grabbed that looked like pants.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nMakeup plays an equally big role. Overplucked eyebrows made an entire generation of women look like they were stuck in the past, as does harsh contouring, and other major elements of hair and makeup, like thick, blocky eyebrows. The Kate Gosselin haircut, the too-light blonde hair curled with a 2-inch barrel curling iron that every single woman on Pinterest has, the ring finger painted in a\u00a0 different color than all the others. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink of those ladies who wore permed hair and blue eyeshadow into the 90s and 00s. You don\u2019t want to be the 2023 version of that lady - *unless* you do it extremely well and intentional for the camp factor. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you found this helpful, I\u2019m interested in creating more spotlight posts on specific items that can be updated.

Why do outfits look \u201cbad\u201d? Why do ponte pants annoy me so much?\n\nI was thinking the other day about how ponte pants are a half-assed bridge between leggings and trousers that I dislike, and I think it\u2019s because I imagine people wearing ponte pants are thinking, \u201cI want to be comfortable, but I also want to look professional, like I\u2019m wearing trousers.\u201d However, they really don\u2019t look like someone wearing trousers, they look like someone wearing ponte pants. Ponte pants are tight and clingy, often show bumps, panty lines, and the outlines of tucked-in clothing, and just generally don\u2019t resemble standard, quality, lined trousers in any way (of course cheap unlined trousers are another story). The intention is there, but the execution falls flat. Some ponte pants even have this faux vertical \u201cseam line\u201d intended to make them look more professional, which I find to be a more extreme attempt and thus a more extreme failure of execution.\n\nI have similar feelings about leggings printed to look like jeans. And you may have similar feelings about tuxedo T-shirts, which you wouldn\u2019t wear to any place that requires an actual tuxedo. However, the difference between tuxedo T-shirts and ponte pants is that tuxedo T-shirts are obviously a joke. Intention and execution match up perfectly.\n\n\n# Example 1: Baby\n\nIgnoring the fact that babies don\u2019t dress themselves, when you see a baby in a cute little polka-dotted onesie [like this](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GjdyOFz.jpg), the intention is to convey, \u201cI\u2019m a baby!\u201d\n\nSuppose you see an adult in the same outfit, no pants and all, maybe with a pacifier or one of those bonnets. Then the intention would also be to convey, \u201cI\u2019m a baby!\u201d except the adult is obviously not a baby. I know we\u2019re big on \u201cyou do you\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t yuck someone else\u2019s yum\u201d here, but I would be surprised and unsettled\/displeased to see any adult wearing this casually on the street. I\u2019m sure most people would be.\n\n# Example 2: Outdated Fashion\nSuppose you see someone wearing [this outfit](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/h2hM3rZ.jpg), and suppose it\u2019s 2016. This woman\u2019s intention is to convey, \u201cI\u2019m fashion-forward and trendy!\u201d And she\u2019d be correct.\n\nNow suppose it\u2019s 2023. What would you assume this woman wants to say with her clothes? Probably still \u201cI\u2019m fashion-forward and trendy!\u201d No one was born wearing skinny jeans and a thin waterfall cardigan, and it\u2019s not like these clothes are the most comfortable items of clothing in the world, so it\u2019s a fair assumption. However, trends have moved on. Execution falls flat. If I saw her, I would probably wonder why she hadn\u2019t caught up yet. Is she aware of the passage of time?\n\nYou could argue, oh, come on, maybe she just likes the clothing. Sure, but she can\u2019t go up to everybody on the street and tell them that she knows her fit is outdated but she\u2019s still wearing it because she likes it. Maybe she doesn\u2019t care at all what people think of her? That\u2019s fine too. It\u2019s fine to not care.\n\nOn the other hand, if this woman were wearing extremely trendy clothes from the 80s in 2023, I would be pretty sure that she knew those clothes weren\u2019t modern, and would probably be impressed by her dedication to vintage style.\n\nAlso, if this woman were wearing her aggressively 2016 fit to 2023 New York Fashion Week, I would assume she\u2019d intended to wear it ironically, and would find that pretty funny. So, context matters also. \n\n# Thoughts\nHonestly, most of the time when I see anybody wearing anything outside of the most basic of items, such as a pretty dress or a pair of heels, I assume their intention is to look fashionable. Then, if I don\u2019t like that outfit, I\u2019ll think that their execution fell flat (of course this is up to opinion, and I\u2019m very picky). This is why so many people are averse to dressing up at all, or gravitate towards clothes which are hard to wear \u201cincorrectly,\u201d such as a linen sack dress or leggings; they want to spare themselves the embarrassment of the intention-execution gap. But the only way to end up wearing nicely-executed outfits is to wear a lot of badly-executed outfits first. I\u2019lll admire someone who tried and didn\u2019t stick the landing far more than someone who never bothered to try. \n\n(But wait a minute, didn\u2019t I just say I hated ponte pants? Isn\u2019t wearing ponte pants a form of trying? They\u2019re a step above leggings, after all, right? Well, really, I consider ponte pants to be a half-step above leggings. Still, a sweater and ponte pants at work is better than a sweater and leggings at work, I\u2019ll give you that.)\n\n# What's my point?\n\nCommit yourself fully to looking the way you want to. This extends to wearing items of clothing that commit themselves fully to looking the way they want \u2013 hence, no wishy-washy ponte pants. Buy real fabrics. Don\u2019t wear those shoes that look like loafers but with sneaker bottoms. Go thrifting (or go secondhand shopping online) to find things you truly like outside of what\u2019s current. Wear old jewelry. I guess this is all linked to developing a personal style. Just commit! Soon you will find yourself surrounded by beautiful things.","upvote_ratio":0.72,"created_utc":1677174059.0},{"title":"What styling details have you been really into lately?","author":"photosynthesis_rocks","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/femalefashionadvice\/comments\/11935l0\/what_styling_details_have_you_been_really_into\/","text":"Recently I've noticed a preference to some styling changes when I get ready in the morning.

Same for the white cable knit sweater. A long scarf, if you don't lose it, will be there through any bodily changes. (Sidenote: I did lose my blue and white wide stripe scarf by leaving it at a party). Seersucker can be for everyone, and should be, because it's a\u00a0 breathable fabric when the weather is very hot. \n\nThe polo shirt isn't a hot fashion item, but it will reliably take you through a weekend, a dog walk or having a visitor in the home. \n\nToday's culture aims towards equality, and prep's class and status connotations cannot be ignored. However i'd like to think preppy clothing transcends that - it can also just be reliable, tidy clothing with an aura of comfort in all facets of life. \n\nA handful of photos, mostly old school ad campaigns for illustrative examples: https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/EEhFBLt (Please remember the heyday of prep was before the time of race and size diversity, and as such diverse photos were hard to source). \n\nHow do\/will you incorporate prep style into your closet? \n\nWhat brands do you recommend? (Clothing, accessories, homewares) \n\nWhere do you see this style evolving to?","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1676839012.0},{"title":"WAYWT - February 19, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/femalefashionadvice\/comments\/116fyke\/waywt_february_19_2023\/","text":"WAYWT is the acronym for \"What Are You Wearing Today\".

However, these are all pull-on pants, and the straight pant and bootcut pant do not have pockets\u2014major con. The pocket pants have very large pockets, but the pants themselves are far too long. They\u2019d be better for someone who needs a longer inseam. \n\nI wish all of these pants were structured a bit better so that I could wear normal bikini underwear without a panty line or tuck a shirt in all the way (see gray pants photo). As it stands, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be wearing the gray pants without a blazer that covers my butt, and I\u2019m a bit torn on the bootcut pants\u2014the navy is quite dark, it\u2019s almost indistinguishable from black in person, and they look a bit like yoga pants to me. Overall, the bootcut was the most comfortable due to their more relaxed fit, the pocket pants are going back due to their length, and these are all as advertised\u2014ultra freakin stretchy.

Lately I have decided that I really want to start putting more effort into my appearance, but it seems like I am just endlessly spinning my wheels with no success. I am curious if anyone has been similar to me and found a way out. \n\nI am 5'2 and the last time I took my measurements I was 34-27-38. My shoulders are equal to my hips, but they look quite broad due to my short height. I'm currently not in great shape, but when I am, I get visibly muscular but not ripped. Currently I pretty much live in black leggings and single color, form fitting tank tops because that's the only thing I feel *remotely* comfortable about myself in. Otherwise, it's all jean shorts and t shirts.\n\n This has not been for lack of trying. There have been multiple trips to the mall of me trying on a bunch of different stuff, which always ends in much weeping and gnashing of teeth. Anything frilly, girly, or \"ingenue\"\/\"gamine\" makes me look like a big toddler. Anything \"romantic\" either looks totally inappropriate or like I'm a teen playing dress up. And anything \"classic\" makes me look like I'm wearing a potato sack. \n\n I have tried using the kibbe system to figure out how I should dress, but now I'm even more confused. I type as \"soft natural\", but the clothing recommendations for that sort of fit into the \"overly neutral potato sack\" category on me for the most part. The exception is that I have been told I look good with vaguely \"1970s\" styling, which I don't disagree with, but where in the hell do you find that without it being costumey \"boho\" tissue paper (looking at you, Free People) ??

I was hoping to pick some of your brains about this. Masculine formal attire is more or less the same as (or similar to) masculine business attire. You can wear a suit to a cocktail party or you can wear a suit to a business meeting. Yet females in positions of power tend to wear a blazer and a skirt, or maybe a pantsuit to a business meeting and a cocktail dress to a cocktail party.\n\n***Imagine if Hilary Clinton were to wear a cocktail dress to the presidential debate? Or if our female principal wore a cocktail dress to school?***\n\nSome of the kids think that people who identify as female or feminine should rebel against the notion of wearing \"manly\" clothing by wearing feminine attire in professional settings.\n\nMeanwhile, some argue that things like collared shirts and pleated pants are not inherently \"manly,\" but rather, a fashion rule associated with business and power. Therefore, females in positions of power should adhere to these traditional fashion roles if they want to be taken seriously.\n\nOf course we have discussed that this debate is merely a \"food for thought\" concept and that people can wear whatever they want unless they have uniforms.\\*to add, the children are questioning why the boys uniforms resemble a male suit while the girls are to wear pleated plaid skirts (instead of say, pencil skirts) to school.

I go through my closet pretty often and get rid of things I don't use\/like anymore so it is in a pretty good state - not a 100% minimalist here by any means but I do like the whole Marie Kondo approach - unless it is something I absolutely love I definitely don't hold onto it. \n\nUnless it is a super sentimental piece (the outfit I got proposed to in is not my style anymore and the condition is also not the best so it is out of closet but it still means a lot to me so I keep it in a box with sentimental items).\n\nRecently I have been thinking about how I wish my grandmother who was pretty chic back in the day kept more of her clothes for me. Of course, back then she didn't know she would have a granddaughter, let alone that she would be interested in having her items. I only have one dress she used to wear when she was in her 20s-30s that I adore and some jewelry.\n\nThis makes me wonder if I should save my dresses for my children too. Of course, I know they might not want these items but what if they do? I don't have a lot of jewelry but the little collection I do have I use a lot and definitely am going to keep it for my future children. But that is a tiny box, pretty easy to keep it. But dresses and other clothing items are going to take up a lot more space. \n\n**So, my question is, does anyone plan on saving clothes (or any other items for that matter) for their children? Or maybe someone in your family saved them for you? Any tips on how to store them so that they are not in the way but also in a good condition for them? Should I just drop the idea and sell\/donate the things I don't wear anymore?**","upvote_ratio":0.86,"created_utc":1674013395.0},{"title":"Hair, Makeup, Skincare, Fitness, and Fragrance Thread - January 17, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/femalefashionadvice\/comments\/10ehyxx\/hair_makeup_skincare_fitness_and_fragrance_thread\/","text":"The Hair, Makeup, Skincare, Fitness, and Fragrance Thread will be posted every Tuesday morning (\\~9:30AM PST)!\n\nThis thread is for simple hair and makeup questions that you may have, especially those that don't warrant their own thread.

I liked wearing things that felt like they held me in place and kept their shape, and I barely owned anything with stretch, which means that most of my wardrobe is now useless to me, when a lot of the time just wearing clothing hurts. I am starting to come to terms with the fact that my life has indeed changed, and that it\u2019s time I alter my wardrobe to fit my life instead of waiting for my circumstances to change (or a miracle to happen!). Even though much of my life is now spent at home (I work part time a few hours a week), I do want to look as good as I can while also feeling as good as I can, and even though I am ill I am still thinking about clothes and fashion constantly, and would love to find ways to still enjoy it. \n\nI think one of the most difficult things is that I\u2019m rarely able to go into stores anymore and try things on, and I feel like I am always ordering things online and sending back 95% of it. I also used to sew a lot of my own clothes, and am so sad to not have the energy for that anymore. \n\nMy main symptoms are fatigue, joint and muscle pain, everywhere, but especially in the hips\/thighs\/knees\/ankles, skin tenderness, and occasional stomach pains\/bloating.\n\nThese are the things I\u2019ve found so far:\n\n* Swapping bras for bralettes (when I don\u2019t go braless). I\u2019ve found some good basic ones (from Organic Basics), but would love to find some prettier alternatives as well. \n* Period underwear has made my periods so much easier and gentler. \n* Bamboo socks stay soft and regulate temperature better than cotton ones. \n* Basic camisoles and long sleeve t-shirts for layering in merino wool for winter and modal jersey for summer. I\u2019ve found that even cotton can feel too harsh\/stiff on my skin, so I prefer wool or some sort of viscose\/modal\/tencel jersey. \n* I need to swap out my pretty blouses and shirts with stretchy jersey tops. I wear mostly neutral colours (though I am exploring seasonal colour theory and trying to introduce a little more colour) and rarely prints, so I\u2019m thinking on focusing on tops with interesting design details, like different types of necklines and sleeves? Something that elevates it beyond just a simple t-shirt.\n* Trousers are the most difficult part! At home I am mostly wearing slim jogger style trousers, and for work I have swapped my slim wool trousers with wide leg ones that don\u2019t pinch my knees. Would love some more options here. Jeans are mostly too painful, but would love to find a pair for wearing out on good days. I\u2019ve tried on a pair from Good American that seemed quite comfortable, though I\u2019ve read mixed reviews. \n* Would love to find some nice pyjamas for those days when getting dressed just isn\u2019t happening. I have nothing at the moment. Just ordered a pair of 100% cotton ones, but quickly realized they are too stiff and uncomfortable, so again I need to look for something with stretch. Would love something classic looking, maybe with piping, but in a stretch jersey. \n\nI would love to hear from anyone else suffering from chronic illnesses, what are your favourite fashion hacks, go to styles\/brands, etc!

The issue gets increasingly worse after washing them, despite using a delicates cycle. \nThe worst issues are severe creasing in the crotch area (to the point where they look like an accordion) and protruding knees. \n\nI have encountered this with blue, black and cream coloured jeans, as well as different styles - cropped flares, skinny and mom jeans. The brands I\u2018ve tried are Zara, H&M, Abercrombie, Topshop and Ted Baker (I am based in the UK). I feel like the jeans just start looking like shit after literally a few weeks of wear, and buying more pairs from fast fashion places just feels like a huge waste at this point. \n\nI have been thinking that poor quality of the materials may be the issue here, so I am thinking of trying out more expensive brands that are specialised in jeans. I\u2018ve looked at Levi\u2018s and Everlane but didn\u2019t like how their styles fit me. I\u2018d even be willing to drop \u00a3200 for a \u201eholy grail\u201c pair from brands like Frame or True Religion, but I\u2018m worried the same may happen again.

And even though a white dress is unlikely to go out of fashion for brides, I prefer not to follow this tradition.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven though my husband and I were going to celebrate our wedding the proper way (with guests, cafes, and other paraphernalia), I immediately decided that I wanted to feel like myself on such a special day. By that time I had already attended several celebrations of my relatives and friends, and heard their stories about how they struggled because of heavy dresses and what their snow-white hems turned into by the end of the evening. They couldn\u2019t move much, dance the way they wanted, and simply have fun as they were supposed t. The pics of their dresses with grey hems also didn\u2019t look nice either. So, I was determined to avoid all these aspects.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI decided to go a chic hot pink jumpsuit - to my mom's horror. But then I changed my mind thinking about my Mom\u2019s health, plus I\u2019m the only daughter. So, I chose a white Diliy Diamonate Midi Bandage Dress from [https:\/\/www.bellabarnett.com\/collections\/bandage-dresses](https:\/\/www.bellabarnett.com\/collections\/bandage-dresses). My husband supported my choice. Besides, it was several times cheaper than a traditional wedding dress. As a result, I lit up and danced like crazy all evening. I felt uninhibited and spectacular. I had so much fun and I am definitely going to remember my wedding party forever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMoreover, I don\u2019t see the point in buying clothes that I can wear just for one occasion. As for me, It\u2019s a waste of money. If I buy something, I want to get the pleasure of wearing it at least several times. So, I've worn my wedding dress more than once on my honeymoon. And now, it's one of the most favourite items in my summer wardrobe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHas anyone made the same decision? Don't you think it's more practical and reasonable?

Getting the weave right is the toughest part, especially online shopping. I try to zoom in to try to feel the material with my eyeball, but not as accurate as feeling it in person... which is why I'm looking for some help here!\n\nHere's some examples from my wardrobe:\n\n\\- Perfect: [Patagonia nano puff](https:\/\/www.patagonia.com\/product\/womens-nano-puff-jacket\/84217.html) line: they have jackets and vests in this line. Very slick material, but not overly shiny. Pet hair does not stick to it, at ALL. Wish they made pants in this material.\n\n\\- Good: [Lululemon Stretch High Rise pants](https:\/\/shop.lululemon.com\/p\/womens-trousers\/Stretch-High-Rise-78-Pant-MD\/_\/prod10520807?color=47824&sz=0): \"Luxstreme\" material, which seems to be Nylon\/Lycra blend. This works pretty well. Hair can stick to it, but most of them falls off while I'm moving around. Some stubborn hair can get \"embedded\" in the fabric and needs to be pulled out... or a wash\/dry also gets rid of most.\n\n\\- Bad: [Arcteryx Covert Cardigan](https:\/\/arcteryx.com\/us\/en\/shop\/womens\/covert-cardigan): it's similar to the well-known Patagonia Better Sweater. Polyester, but the weave is a magnet for pet hair. Hair constantly embedded in between the fabric and difficult to keep clean even with religious lint rolling. The website did say it was fleece, but it is not one of those \"fuzzy\" cotton-candy-like fleece type and looks more like tightly woven wool....so I had had hope.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1672688061.0},{"title":"Recent Purchases - January 02, 2023","author":"AutoModerator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/femalefashionadvice\/comments\/101g16e\/recent_purchases_january_02_2023\/","text":"The Recent Purchases thread will be posted on Monday mornings (PST) This thread is for sharing all your new buys.

I appreciate it all and am taking tonnes of notes and going supply shopping after the new year.\n\nTo clear up some misconceptions: my husband actually does all the laundry because I both suck at and hate doing it. He dislikes everything environmentally unfriendly and makes small cuts in his life wherever he can to be as environmentally friendly as possible given the limitations of our modern world. In this particular case: dry cleaning. He takes care of his own clothes and as best I can tell they look ok and don\u2019t smell, they just need some help with pressing. My nice clothes have been dry cleaned or otherwise cared for semi-recently but are approaching a point in time I would typically have them cleaned again and he has asked me not to due to PERC and the large energy consumption of dry cleaning places, to which I have replied that if we upgrade our home laundry capabilities so that our clothes can look professionally done and last the appropriate length of time before they need to be retired, then I will forgo dry cleaning. It\u2019s really no skin off my nose where my clothes are cleaned as long as they look good and last a long time. I have also elected to use this as an opportunity to teach myself to be good at laundry. Perhaps being good at it will enable me to enjoy it (though I am doubtful of this).","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1672297070.0},{"title":"WEEKLY DEALZ!","author":"_spiraling","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/femalefashionadvice\/comments\/zybfdq\/weekly_dealz\/","text":"Guidelinez!\n\n* Post sales to common retailers under the common stores reply (e.g. Gap, J.Crew, etc.)\n* Post links to retailers that FFA is not likely to know about\n* Post links to flash sites (e.g. Gilt, Hautelook, MyHabit, etc.)\n* Post links to secondhand retailers (e.g. Twice, eBay, etc.)\n* Post specific items at a reduced price that seem to be a worthwhile investment\n* Specify the country in which the retailer is located\/available\n* If you are posting on behalf of a brand, please follow the [FFA rules](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/femalefashionadvice\/wiki\/rules#wiki_on_brand_participation_in_ffa)","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1672336134.0},{"title":"How do you keep up with current fashion?","author":"theScape11","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/femalefashionadvice\/comments\/zxk5z5\/how_do_you_keep_up_with_current_fashion\/","text":"I\u2019m not talking about fast fashion or trends btw.

I work a fairly standard 9-5 office job, so these observations are based solely on that observation, and probably won\u2019t be reflective of different fields or geographic areas. But I do think that the pandemic and cultural shift towards working from home has brought workplace attire in a more casual direction across the board, and I\u2019d love to hear how this has played out where you live! \n\nIn my city, I\u2019m seeing:\n- Much more casual footwear - Sneakers are common, as are more casual boots like Docs and Blundstones, in a city that used to be strictly heels or ballet flats\n- Jeans - this was definitely a slacks city pre-pandemic, but almost everyone I know wears jeans to the office. It\u2019s not just dark wash skinny or bootcut jeans now either - light wash mom jeans seem office-worthy\n- More attention to trends - I don\u2019t think the workwear in my city had changed much since the early 2000s, and followed a very \u201cclassic\u201d formula. However, the wide leg pant trend has really caught on here, and we\u2019re seeing a lot more inclusion of casual wear trends in the workplace\n- Loose fits - tailoring was everything pre-pandemic, but now an intentionally loose fit seems like part of the business casual dress code here\n\nI\u2019ve gathered examples in [this album](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/scMB0VM) to illustrate what I\u2019ve seen around here. A lot of the more casual elements are paired with more structured elements (for examples, jeans with a blazer, or a slouchy top with high-waisted and structured pants), which I think is how they\u2019ve been accepted in a traditionally more formal work environment. \n\nNone of this is groundbreaking in comparison to casual wear and streetwear trends and changes (a lot of the photos in the album give very \u201c2015 fashion blogger with a timeless capsule wardrobe\u201d), but it\u2019s definitely new territory in this particular setting. I\u2019m enjoying the more casual interpretation of business casual, and hope it\u2019s here to stay.

I can vibe with tunic tops and skinny jeans coming back, bias cut jersey dresses. Slim blazers, preppy looks, Ralph Lauren, the heyday signatures of American Apparel. Spandex skater skirts, disco pants, U neck tshirts. \n\nHow do you feel about it?\n\nEdit: I decided to google \"2010s revival\" and it returned 23 real articles (from Vogue, Elle amongst others) and youtube videos on the phenomenon on just the first page.

Here I've assembled a collection of tips and inspiration album to get you through the cold times in style. Be advised, this isn't an album of looks with bare ankles or light trenches. This is a real winter album, with looks you can wear in below freezing temperatures. Hope you all enjoy!\n\nFirst thing's first....\n\n# [ALBUM HERE](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/xfFsrJH)\n\nLike you'll see in the album, there are a few things to do if you want to look cool (without being cool!) when it's chilly outside. Here are some things you'll see throughout the album:\n\n**1) Use accessories to get yourself to full coverage**\n\nHats, scarves, earmuffs, hoods, and other accessories can be pretty or make a statement while adding layers to a winter look. Wool, silk, fur (faux if that's your thing), and fleece are all warm and dry quickly if they get wet in the snow. They can also add interesting, contrasting textures or be an easy way to add color to your winter outfits.\n\n**2) Opt for a statement coat**\n\nWe've all probably seen a black knee-length puffer, but outerwear can be a great way to make yourself stand out in the winter. Big prints, furry textures, sleeve details, interesting collars, and unique silhouettes can make even a simple outfit underneath look fresh and fun for the winter.\n\n**3) Lean into the bulk**\n\nExperiment with big silhouettes. Why not try a coat with a dramatic shoulder? Or play with different jacket lengths? Winter is a great time to try out an oversized look!\n\n**4) Get creative with layering**\n\nTry layering a shorter jacket over a longer one. Or using a statement vest over a coat. Why not a jacket under your coat, leaving them open to get the full impact of the layers? There are many ways to incorporate thinner layers to make a weather-appropriate and cool outfit.\n\n**5) Use more colors as you add layers**\n\nMaking fun color palettes can help make wearing all those layers worth it. Consider getting creative with different combinations!\n\n**6) Just wear your damn boots with whatever else you're wearing**\n\nSo what if your warm boots aren't cute? Just wear them with your outfit. I bet you'll realize it just goes anyway. Practical and comfortable always looks good, so just lean into the utility and pair those hikers with a suit. It's winter! \n\nDid any looks catch your eye? Anything you're going to try out as the temperatures drop? Did you notice any other tips while you looked through the album?

I want to update my wardrobe and develop better personal style. Before my appointment, I sent the stylist a few inspo pics so she had an idea of what I was looking for before I arrived \u2013 here is what I sent.[https:\/\/imgur.com\/RVV4EyS](https:\/\/imgur.com\/RVV4EyS)\n\nOverall it was an okay experience. It was fantastic to have items already chosen for me when I walked into the dressing room. One thing I asked for in particular was a long straight coat which I noticed right away wasn't in the dressing room. However, when I asked the stylist, she found me a long green jacket which I liked.\n\nHonestly, I was disappointed by some of the items she chose for me. I wanted some stylish tops I could layer, a few statement pieces, and good jeans\/trousers. Unfortunately, many of the pieces she chose were unflattering to me and boring, IMO. For example, the sweaters were basic solid color styles (many boatneck options) that looked like something you could buy at target. She also selected three plain black long sleeve shirts which were almost identical.\n\nAlso, the outfits she created for me seemed like odd choices. Notably, the all-black ensemble with the satin top and the grey sweater\/jeans outfit \u2013 she kept saying I was too hard on myself and that they looked great. However, neither seemed like a fully put-together outfit to me.\n\nThe stylist was friendly, albeit a little pushy. She would be a great stylist for someone older with a more corporate, mature sense of style.\n\nIn the end, I did get two coats which I love, so not a total bust! :) I purchased the long green coat and the orange\/navy check coat. I almost got the lighter jeans I wore with the black top but decided to hold off.\n\nIf I were to do it again, I would research the stylists on the Nordstrom website ahead of time and choose myself instead of letting them select one for me.\n\nCheck out my photos below and let me know your thoughts!\n\n[https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/jTeZNEv](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/jTeZNEv)\n\n\n\n*UPDATE* some people have asked in the comments about my size\/height.

In fact, these sentiments have been widely shared in many threads on this very sub. But wearing big visible logos can also be a cheeky, creative way to express yourself and have fun with fashion. To that end, I've made an album celebrating logos and brand names on clothing, from hats all the way down to socks. I hope this album injects some fresh inspo for logo lovers, and maybe convinces a few haters that it can be fun to be a little irreverent once in a while! \n\nNote, I've tried to avoid bags, since those are some of the most logo'd fashion pieces around. Instead, I've focused on clothes and other accessories like belts, hats, socks, and more. Enjoy!\n\n# [The Album](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/8noRVDl)\n\nWhat did you think? Any looks stand out?
