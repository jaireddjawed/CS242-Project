        "text": "A little set up, whenever it's my turn to DM for my D&amp;D group I like to have \"guest-stars\" where every once in awhile I'll say an NPC will look like some famous actor and I'll attempt an impression. It's goofy and we have good time.\n\nAnyways, for this particular quest, I had Nick Cage show up and launch the party into a loose parody of National Treasure. He needed some adventurers to help him find an ancient lost city of gold, but the only clue to it's whereabouts involved a map on the back of a sacred document that was being shown at an Elven history museum in town.\n\nNow as the DM of course, I've got this museum all rigged up with traps and spells and security for the heroes to plan an epic heist around. So the party goes to \"case the joint\" and investigate the museum before the document arrives for display the next morning. They find that all of the entrances and exits to the building have magic barriers that will activate if a major exhibit is touched, sealing off the building.  \n\nAnother thing to understand about this particular D&amp;D game is that we've been running it for a while now and at this point, all the members of the party are huge celebrities in town because they've saved it from various threats, monsters etc. So our Gnome Ranger, Piper, decides to cash in on their fame a little bit.\n\nThe master plan she comes up with is as follows: She will go into town and find Jerry the Newsboy, an adorable, impressionable young human boy NPC who hands out newspapers in the town square. He looks up to the heroes as roll models and had been a reoccurring character for the last few sessions. Piper convinces him to come to the museum with them. Her instructions are to, on the signal,  jump the velvet rope and touch the document, setting off the alarm and springing the magic barriers. \n\nAccording to Piper, the guards will see Jerry is a little boy and chalk his crime up to \"boys will be boys\" and while they're scolding him and scrambling to shut the alarm off, our wizard can cast Invisibility on our Rogue while she goes up and swaps the real document for a fake one.\n\nWhat they DIDN'T know however, is that I had already planned for the document itself to be imbued with a single charge of the spell \"Thunderwave\". If touched, It would violently shock whoever tried to lay their hands on it if they were foolish enough to grab it without detecting magic. So as they're telling me the plan I'm trying real hard not to just start laughing at the inevitable horror that will ensue.\n\nSure enough, they arrive at the museum with Jerry in tow, giving each other high fives and congratulating Piper on her great plan. \n\nPiper assures Jerry everything will be fine and he'll only be in trouble for a little bit but they'll have his back.\n\nShe gives the signal.\n\nBeaming with the pride of helping his heroes, Jerry jumps the rope and gives the Document a tap.\n\n14 hit points of electrical damage absolutely SHREDS his little body. (even an ADULT human commoner only has 4 hit points).\n\nThe gasps were audible from every player as they realized what had just happened. They. Were. Mortified. Piper dove for him immediately and started casting healing spells and healing potions like crazy. Everyone at the table was so legitimately horrified and bummed out by what they'd done I actually felt bad and said the barrage of healing right at the point of death brought Jerry back, but in a coma.\n\nThe rest of the party finished the heist and used \"We have to get this boy to a healer, STAT\" as their excuse to leave the premises. \n\nAnyways, that's the story of how my party sacrificed a childs life in the pursuit of treasure and I've never let them live it down.",

        "text": "Once upon a time, there was a party of newbie adventurers: A human barbarian, a dragonborn priestess, an elven ranger and her halfling bard adopted sister, a tiefling rogue who was for some reason dating the bard, and my own character, a half-elf sorceress. This is the story of how they all died horribly.\n\nThrough a series of misadventures, we had all been sent by the Prince of the Dark Continent to go retrieve his lost \"experiment,\" which had been stolen and taken to a cave in a volcano. We entered the cave to find that, surprise, the thief was my character's long lost father, and the experiment was the creepy girl who'd been held prisoner on the ship we used to get to this continent and who had been kidnapped on our way here. My character's father then proceeded to trick me into completing the ritual to summon the twin evil dragon gods, and then attack me when I caught on and tried to leave.\n\nOur priestess remembered that the only way to stop the ritual would be to sacrifice an innocent, and after rolling a few insight checks, managed to narrow down the list to either the ranger or the creepy girl. She made her choice, and stabbed the creepy girl in the heart. All at once the metric ton of power disguise and brainwashing spells placed on her dispersed, revealing the ranger's missing twin sister (and by extension the bard's other adoptive sister) who had vanished after their village was raided by an unknown powerful army. The sisters and priestess had about two seconds to realize what just happened before the girl died screaming in agony and madness as memories weeks of torture and inhumane experiments flooded her mind while she fell backwards off a cliff into the lava.\n\nThe priestess sunk into a deep pool of guilt and self-hatred, while the bard completely flipped out and threatened to murder her. By this point, the rest of the party had killed off all the Big Bad's minions and he himself had been blinded by a critical, point-blank color spray to the face from my character. I frantically tried to call everyone over to *knock it off with the drama and help me finish the guy off for Pete's sake*, but the rest of the party was more than a bit distracted by the suddenly murderous bard and were convinced that the blinded villain couldn't do any further harm.\n\nRight then is when the volcano started to erupt. Everyone quickly set aside their drama and started running the hell out of the cave. But, before I could follow, my evil father grabbed me dragged me deeper into the cave, saying if he was going down, he was taking me with him. Everyone else was too distracted to notice, so I just swore under my breath in elvish and accepted my fate.\n\n1 down, 5 to go.\n\nAs soon as the rest of the party got out of the cave, before they even had time to notice I was gone, the bard's curse that she had been hiding from the party activated. She had taken on the curse in order to save everyone else from a pack of snow wolves, and now her time was up, and we got a long, tearful farewell scene before she turned into a snow wolf and joined the pack. The ranger both her sisters in 15 minutes.\n\n2 down, 4 to go.\n\nNo sooner had THAT happened, then the Dark Prince showed up and demanded a new innocent to replace the \"experiment\" we had destroyed. He grabbed the ranger and began dragging her away. We knew from experience we didn't stand a chance against this guy, so the barbarian did the only thing he could think of and mercy killed her. Critical hit, she was dead instantly, joining her twin. The Dark Prince glared at the survivors and muttered \"There are no more innocents here,\" before turning and walking away.\n\n3 down, 3 to go.\n\nAll that were left now were the barbarian, rogue, and priestess. They slowly and silently began walking back to the port town to go home. On the way back, the rogue was confronted with the old lady fortune teller he had randomly murdered on the first day of the adventure. She revealed herself to be his demonic mushroom god and offered him one wish. In the past he had hated all of us (even his \"girlfriend\"), but after so much tragedy all at once, he only had one wish: \"I just want my friends back.\" The god stepped aside to reveal a tombstone with his name on it. He was willing to sacrifice himself, and stepped forward to touch it. The priestess ran forward and grabbed him to try and stop him, and was sucked down into the underworld along with him. Needless to say it had been a trick, and now he had his dead friends back... along with himself... in Hell.\n\n5 down, 1 to go.\n\nThe barbarian walked back to town alone. The boat that was going to take us back home was missing, so he just hung out in the tavern. From there, he heard from local gossip that literally every single NPC we had interacted with throughout our journey had suffered a horrible fate as a direct result of dealing with us. This included the captain of the ship who, along with his nephew whom had become a party favorite, had been overthrown and murdered by his crew, so the boat was never coming. This was the final straw, and the barbarian decided to commit suicide by walking into the ocean. \n\nAnd that was the end of the campaign.",

        "text": "You ever have that one player who just became a running joke in your party? For us, that was Al. Al hated critical failures, and critical failures loved Al.\n\nIt all started back in college, I was running a game for a group of new players, who were searching for a mythic tuning fork with the power to rend portals in space and time. Our glorious adventurers had come to a tavern in the city of Pax Haven, a tent city that had sprung up between two portals.\n\nAl, his last character having been driven mad by an epic-level spellbook, has rolled an alchemist, and is interviewing for a spot with the team. He decides he wants to show off to the party, and quickly whips up a bomb, which he casually tosses over his shoulder. I ask him to roll to see where the bomb lands. Natural 1.\n\nNow, by popular vote, I had agreed to include a house rule in this game, every time someone made a critical success, they could continue rolling the dice until they failed to confirm, for some characters, like our falchion-wielding fighter, this meant they were laying down some truly tremendous critical hits. However, for critical failures, they also had to keep rolling, until they rolled above a five. Everyone at the table agreed that this was fair, and so we proceeded.\n\nAl rolls a 1, his eyes grow wide, and he slowly reaches out to roll again. Another 1, then a 2, then a 4, then another 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, finally he rolls a 12, but the damage has been done. The bomb rockets straight into the air, bounces into the cook's frying pan, where the fuse ignites, the cook, in panic, flings the bomb away where it careens off of a hanging mug and drops into the alchemist's bag with all of his active ingredients and reagents. The party is banned from the tavern, and Al is rolling a new character five minutes after the session begins. I offer him a do-over, but he waves me away, rules are rules.\n\nWhile Al is re-rollling, the party continues their adventure, freeing a party of peaceful goblins from the Viet Cong who had come through one of the portals. Among the goblins is Bikud, the multiclassed rogue/bard, played by Al. Bikud swiftly joins up with the party, and they continue on their merry way.\n\nUntil they come across my slightly-modified Yellow Musk creeper, who wins initiative and grabs Bikud, pulling him towards it's \"mouth\" to be digested. Our ranger fires a flaming arrow. Natural 1, 2, 9. A double critical failure. Oh boy. We have six party members, roll a d6 to see which party member gets hit. Bikud. Of course. The poor guy begins to burn as he is pulled into the creeper's digestive tract, and held in a pod at the base of the tree. \n\nThe creeper is finally defeated, and our cleric rushes to the skill-monkey's aid. Instead of prying the pod apart however, he uses his enchanted Lucerne Hammer to smash it to pieces. Roll to attack, nat 20, roll to not hit Bikud. Nat 1. Al is staring at the board through his fingers as our cleric pulls his corpse from the pod. Again, I offer to DM-res him, again he refuses me, starting on a new character with \"More HP, so I won't get teamkilled as easily.\" Enter Uther, the tower shield specialist.\n\nAnd enter the ford that the team has to cross to get to Roses, another tent city where the next clue for the tuning fork is. It shouldn't be a big deal, the water is only a foot deep here and Uther has massive strength and constitution scores. He even took off his armor before crossing, so he wouldn't have to worry about the Armor Check. \n\nYou can see where I'm going with this. Ten minutes later, Uther is face down in the river slowly being carried away by the moderate current, and we all decide that maybe that's enough Pathfinder for the day, so that Al can shake whatever curse it is that has killed so many of his characters today. It was also the death of the rolling critical rule in our group. \n\nAl never did shake the curse of the critical failure though, every time a ranged character fired into melee, there he was, pulling an arrow out of his ass. It never mattered who was running the game or which players were with us, he was the player with the magnetic face. He refused to go into any body of water, no matter what size it was, and refused any and all assistance escaping traps of any kind.",

        "text": "Some background:\n\nThe campaign is set in the Skyrim universe, using 5e rules.  The civil war has ended, there's been some amount of peace, but dragons have rather suddenly razed the city of Whiterun and enslaved what inhabitants remained.  \n\nWe (the PCs) meet at the Throat of the World after we discover that we're all dragonborn.  Our party consists of a ranger, sorcerer, warlock, druid, barbarian, fighter, and wizard(me).  We are, for plot reasons, headed north to Winterhold by way of Windhelm.\n\nIt's rather early in the campaign, and our fighter and ranger decide to start learning some crafting disciplines (smithing and alchemy) while in Windhelm.  We're told it will take about 3 days, as well as an appropriate amount of gold for materials and such.  At this point, my character, being a former seamstress, realizes that she can have much more valuable wares if the things she sells are enchanted.  Our DM, being the kind soul that he is, mentioned that my being a member of the College of Mages (based in Winterhold) would merit me a discount if I chose to learn there. \n\nThe sorcerer, also a member, decides she wants to learn enchanting as well.  The others are fine with going ahead to Winterhold, doing some learning while we're there, and continuing the plot when our fighter and ranger catch up.  Especially because a carriage from Windhelm to Winterhold is going to cost 25 gold, and we've just all received 50 gold bounties for turning in some bandits.\n\nHere's where it gets hairy:\n\nOur barbarian decides that since we've been told it's only a day and a half's walk to get to Winterhold, he would prefer to walk and not spend the money.  DM reluctantly agrees that it's something his character would do.  (We don't really know much about him except that he talks like he has strep throat and wanted us to take a 8 day detour to check on his village (which would also take us through dragon country).  \n\nAt this point we're pointing out that not only is he splitting the party, he's going off *alone*.  He is totally fine with this. Our spellcasters don't want to stay behind, because those of us who don't want to learn enchanting have been told that they can start learning a new spell (even if its out of class!) at the college.  Barbarian doesn't want to stay behind with the others because they're taking the carriage up as well.\n\n(Note that this player has been known to make less than stellar decisions in the past.)\n\nWhile our druid and warlock roll to see how well they take to learning their chosen spells, our barbarian has turned to our DM, assumed the *come-at-me* pose, and said \"Give me an encounter.\"  DM sighs, rolls a random encounter.  Then rolls to determine if there's going to be one or two polar bears attacking our barbarian.  \n\nBears roll higher initiative than he does.  One of them crits to attack.  Barbarian's health drops alarmingly low.  He spends his turn scaring them away by doing a lot of damage to one of them.  Barbarian makes it out alive.  DM says \"Hey, now's your chance to head back to Windhelm and heal up.  You haven't gone far, and you can set out with the other two when they go to Winterhold.\"  \n\nThe barbarian declines.  He decides that a short rest will be sufficient, and then keeps going, having found a group of travelers also going up the road.  (Note that none of them are fighters, despite the rather bloody state the barbarian is in, they agree to travel with him because he most likely knows how to fight.)  \n\nUnsurprisingly, the bears catch up with the group.  The barbarian engages with them; the travelers cower in fear, or run away.  The barbarian's rather upset that he's not getting backup, and then the other bear crits to attack him.  The poor guy dies.  \n\nOur ranger and fighter gleefully loot the body they find on the way up the mountain.  The rest of our party has no idea where the barbarian's gone.  Probably back to his village, since he was so concerned about it?  Either way, we'll be using his name as a measure of how expensive something is for the rest of the campaign.  ",

        "text": "Welcome friends let me regale you with the story of Rob the Thief and his confusing parentage.\n\nSo I'm running Lost Mines right now after my group kinda split in two because we had way too many people for one game. And I was pretty excited because among other players I was inheriting the ever amusing 11 year old, Isaac.\n\nMy first session as the new DM Isaac shows up with a chaotic evil halfling rogue. At which point I tell him evil alignments aren't allowed in Adventurer's League rules and that he should probably go with CN. So he changes that up and I ask his character name. Rob. And I'm sitting there like \"you named your thief....Rob?\" \"Yup!\"\n\nI should probably tell you about the rest of the party too. So we have a deep gnome wizard named perri, a veteran fighter half orc named Thrall, a half-elf cleric named Thorra, and an elven druid played by a very unimaginative player who named him, and I don't like that I allowed this, Mr. Druid Elf. He was polishing off his character late and I needed a name for initiative and he's like call me this for now and it stuck. He was raised by hippies. anyways back to Rob.\n\nAdventure starts and he immediately asks if there's anything for him to drink. I think yeah he's escorting a dwarf shipment so there's probably some ale on there. He drinks just enough to get tipsy without getting any disadvantage in combat and then jumps up on the highest part of the wagon. For a better viewpoint Then upon seeing a clearly ambushed horse that has several arrows in it he decides the best course of action is to abandon his previously prized vantage point and run up to it completely alone. At which point logically all 4 goblins waiting in the woods should have attacked him but I smudged battle tactics a bit and had the bow wielding goblins attack his allies since having a death first session for an 11yo player probably would not have gone well. On the other hand the two melee goblins I could do nothing about and they attacked him. After they hit him, instead of fighting back or running away, he decides \"I'm going to play dead\". Nat 20 + 4 to perform fools all the goblins (and almost all of his party) and the rest of the party is a real threat at this point so they actually leave him alone. They beat the goblins and as the party approaches to mourn he hops up and says \"what took so long\". \n\nSo they follow the trail they found and after alerting Klarg, the bugbear leader, to their sneaky side entrance by way of a glowing rapier and an epic one on one duel between Thrall and Klarg, they rescue Sildar and head to town. \n\nIn town, at the recommendation of Sildar, they head to the inn. And the antics start again. Rob sees a crowd and instincts kick in and he tries to pickpocket the closest person. His instincts are apparently a tad rusty though as he gets caught instantly. The would be victim demands to know what he's doing and Rob, the quick thinker he is, replies \"where's my daddy\" trying to play of being a halfling as being a human child. At this point I could have stopped it because this guy would obviously know a halfling but purely for my amusement I let it slide and he started helping him find his father. Rob trying desperately to get out of this predicament sees the party at the bar and thinks \"well perri is pretty smart he'll probably figure it out quick and help me get out of this\" points to perri and says \"there's my daddy\" \"...that grey skinned gnome is your dad?\" Perri having a rather high passive perception hears this and prestidigitations a tattoo of Rob's face on his arm, shocking and confusing the poor bystander even more. Sensing he'd been caught Rob tries to cover his lie \"wait there's my other Daddy\" points to the half orc. \"OTHER DADDY? what do you mean other daddy?\" Thrall, being alerted by Perri, comes over and tries to explain the situation. The villager at this point is so confused he's getting a headache \"sure take him I don't care.......I need another drink\"\n\nThus concludes the first part of Rob's adventures tune in next time for the story of his miraculous conversion to a kind good character in literally an instant.\n\nIn summary 11yo kids are the best people to play D&amp;D with",

I remember that it was described as looking much like the primordial serpents from Dark Souls. The False Naga lures people into sewers (or any part of the underground) to be eaten alive, it does this sparingly so it's presence is not suspected. But what makes the False Naga horrific is that it's existence is hidden by a powerful illusion, it can be in plain sight of anyone but they are not aware that it is there. In the story the characters eventually find themselves waking up with cryptic warnings that they have subconsciously scraped into their skin. I believe that the reason it is called a \"False Naga\" is because it is actually a large biomass hidden beneath the town, it's heads are simply extensions of itself that it uses to feed.\n\nIt's been years since I've read it but if someone still has access to it then I'd be very grateful!",

This happened multiple times until the last time when I ran out of both anti-radiation meds.\n\n-By now I've explored most of the vault going from terminal to terminal to open door after door.\n\n-By now I have 5 water, no food, 1 stimpack, and a doctors bag.\n\n-I find the vault overseer who is the most radiated of the undead and the strongest, he's protected by 2 machine gun turrets.\n\n-Before fighting him I take out all the nearby undead to avoid them interrupting the fight and catching me off guard.\n\n-My supplies are: 3 water, no food, no doctors bag\n\n-I proceed to the overseer's door. My health is VERY low, so I use all 3 of my survival magazines to increase my water's effectiveness of healing me, I then proceed to use all the water I have left in order to have the most health possible.\n\n-My health is now at 85% and I have no healing supplies.\n\n-I open the door, and the turrets start firing. I sneak in a grenade which takes them out.\n\n-My companion (A robot named ED-E) charges in and gets some good hits on the overseer, he now has half health, and I still have 85%.\n\n-He charges and I have no choice but to back away as quickly as possible while shooting a plasma rifle at him.\n\n-He gets plenty of hits on me lowering me to 5% health.\n\n-Then I get rad poisoning. And have no way of stopping it.\n\n-So now my brain FINALLY says \"GET THE CRAP OUT!\"\n\n-So I begin to make my way out and actually run into another vault guard, I use a stealth boy in order to avoid detection, and have ED-E take him out.\n\n-After this happens my health is down to 4%. (Rad poisoning)\n\n-I proceed to try and find the fastest route out, but since it's a maze down there I end up just wandering aimlessly.\n\n-Eventually I find the exit to the vault.\n\n-My health is at 1%.\n\n-And then I hear a vault dweller directly behind me.\n\n-ED-E takes him out and by some INSANE luck, I level up.\n\n-Now leveling up does not restore health in Fallout. It just lets you increase your stats. So I'm not too excited.\n\n-But then it turns out it was an even number I leveled up to, which means I get a new perk.\n\n-One of the perks that I can unlock at level 12 (Which is what I leveled up to) is one that allows me to increase my max health by 50 more points.\n\n-And so I use it, make it out of the cave, fast travel to a doctor, and fix the rest.\n\n10/10 would panic insanely again.",

        "text": "Todays adventure stars my character Grit, the half-orc Cad Fighter and Spack, his rogue/sorcerer friend. With the supporting cast of Sir Stuwart Stuart, the dwarven paladin, Godrick the Slayer, Phaeros the inquisitor and our ever merciful DM. \n\nNow, Spack hasn't had the easiest time in the Emerald Spire. Hes been knocked out about three times, from unseen arrows and a falling ceiling. He's tried to disable traps on multiple occasions, but they rarely succeed. The first time he tried to disarm a trap door, he did 4 at once. He got nat 1's for two of the checks. Lukcily Grit was right next to him and managed the reflex save to grab him by the scruff of the neck. Then there was the time where I had enough and tied a rope to Spack so I could pull him back easier when he failed the next disarm. Which he did. And of course I failed the strength save giving me the option to be pulled into a spider pit with him or let go. And so we both had to kill a big moon spider in a pit. \n\nAt this point in the campaign, we've been chasing this Bone Priest around and finally got him cornered in a room. We split up at seperate doors. Stu, Godrick and Phaeros at one and Grit and Spack at the other. Stu gets a nat 20 on kicking the door open which knocks it off its hinges and slams into a Moon spider that we quickly dispose of. Its at this point that the second Moon spider shoots webbing at Spack at starts to drag him toward it. Did I mention the large pit in the center of the room that the spider is dangling over? Because that turned out to be a problem. \n\nSpack fails the CMB and is dragged over to the spider. Again, Grit is right next to Spack and manages the reflex grab yet again. But of course, I fail the next roll and we're both dragged to the edge of the pit. On my turn, I have Grit try to pull Spack up. Apparently a nat 1 is not enough to pull up a human. We both hurtle down into the pit.\n\nNow, this is Spack, Stu and Godricks first time playing a Pathfinder campaign (And pretty much any tabletop), so the DM is more than ready enough to be lenient. The spider webbing was still stuck to Spack, and the Moon spider was not ready for a large half-orc to come with the human. The spider halts our fall by trying to stay to the wall and we manage to crash into a ladder and get a grip with only minimal damage. \n\nMeanwhile Stu is smiting the hell out of the Bone Priest, Godrick is trying to flip over its head at every move and Phaeros is unloading bolts from far away. You know, minor stuff.\n\nThen the DM announces that the spider starts to crawl down toward Spack. So Grit says,\n\n\"Alright, I'm gonna yank on the web and pull the spider down.\"\n\nSpack says, \"Can I voice some concerns?\"\n\nGrit replies, \"Of course you can.\" As he yanks on the web.\n\nLo and behold I roll above a 20 and yank the spider loose from the wall and send it plummeting down to splat 40 feet below. The one cool thing I managed to do. Then Grit and Spack bungled there way through bad climb checks to get to the top of the ladder, swearing at each other as they climbed over one another.\n\nGrit got to the top just as Godrick slashed through the Bone Priests spine. He walked over and said, \"Now, that wasn't too tough, was it?\"\n\nStu the Paladin was lying down and Godrick was glaring. Then Godrick spit blood on Grits nice boots. \n\nLooting the body, we found a ring of climbing, at which we all yelled at the DM and he swears that was a certain drop. Phaeros picked it up and gave it to Spack and just pat his back saying, \"You'll probably need this.\"\n\nIt honestly felt like Grit and Spack were two side adventure characters during a huge fight, Like the two dumb pirates from Pirates of the Caribbean.\n\nEdit - Forgot the part where Spack rummaged through Grits pockets while climbing the ladder, trying to get at the last health potion. Grit has to explain some boundaries. ",

        "text": "I've only recently gotten into Pathfinder after maybe 6 years of one session campaigns that never went anywhere. I'm having a blast with it now, and one of the best things is the growth of one of my friends characters, the lovable, naive, clumsy half-elf Paladin, Kale Bannor.\n\nKale has had some incidents which set his characters personality for us. Early on he tried to charge at a large centipede monster. But the player forgot that the centipede was on the other side of a large chasm. Poor Kale promptly fell and broke both his legs. My half-orc Monk Gregor had to carry him the rest of the way through the dungeon. \n\nThe next session Kale failed a perception check and stepped into a bear trap. Somehow, the bear trap got a nat 20 and critted Kale. We theorized that Kale managed to step in it with both feet at once. \n\nThen there was the new character our DM made up, Bartleby, a character who constantly makes puns about death and ghouls and who had us retrieve a stolen journal that contained detailed anatomy and autopsy studies. Clearly evil, Kale failed his sense motive and instantly became best friends with him. Now his player says he has no reason to use sense evil on him.\n\nBut the tale I want to tell is how Kale challenged a Lizardman leader to one on one combat. \n\nIn our Kingmaker campaign, one of our citizens, a young boy, was missing. We eventually found out after a lizardman ambush (where my monk Gregor intimidated a lizardman by hissing menacingly at it), that the kid was being held captive by the lizardmen and used to grant favor for their \"god\".\n\nWe tried our favorite plan to get him back. Gregor carries our halfling Druid Boram up the palisade to sneak the kid out while Kale, Boram's animal companion Bessie the Rhino and our new sneaky Magus V make a distraction at the front gate. Bessie charges down the gate and Kale, through V's translation to the Lizardmen, challenges the leader to honorable combat. Surprisingly, he agreed (Last time didnt work so well and involved arrows and slamming some bandits through some walls.)\n\nThe 20 or so Lizardmen grouped around their leader, a very large Lizardman with a magic trident. His first attack took Kale to half health. We had told V to help out if it looked bad, so he managed a sleight of hand and used his wand to curse the LizardLeader with Hideous Laughter. Oh boy did that help. \n\nThe LizardLeader stops attacking and just laughs for three turns. Kales player reasoned that he had no idea what V did, just that this huge lizard hurt him and started laughing in his face. It pretty much went like this. \"Why are you laughing at me? Do you think this is funny? Stop mocking me! I'll kill you!\"\n\n(While all this is happening, the Will-o-Wisp the Lizardmen were worshiping was chasing our Druid Boram and shocking him while I chased the Will-o-Wisp and punched it in the back of the head...Or spectral body, whatever it has.) \n\nFed up with the constant mockery of his clumsiness and ineptness, Kale pounded that LizardLeader with power attacks until he severed its head. To this day, Kale will talk about his mighty battle with the arrogant LizardLeader and V just nods his head and smiles. \n\n",

My players started off with a lazy, fat, sleepy halfling called Nass, an extremist christian, and the follower of the christian, a female goblin wizard. These three went into the unknown regions (Real world south america) for Oceania (real world north america) to colonize it. They make their way to the main Kojima's (Real world Eurasia and in game ally of Oceania) city in the unknown regions. Then the royal family of Kojima almost all get killed off, three survive, the coward on the throne, the heir in Oceania, and the banished in the unknown regions. The banished then decides to join the group and so does his bodyguard, the overman named Kokri. They then run out of the city and to the enemy city, murders an entire building of the enemy, steals a flying ship, and burns the city down. (This will be continued)\n",

        "text": "Back in Phlan Mitch was busing cobbling shoes and soon learned from Rillo Leadstopper that his companions had left the city to learn of a missing shipment in Falcon's Hollow. Mitch set off at once and upon arriving was told that the party had started their journey to the Lumber Mill on the edge of the The Other Forest. Once he arrived there he spoke with the foreman who advised he should make due haste for the Dwarven Monastery if he was too catch up with his friends.\n\n**Day 36, Mirtul, 1489DR**\n\nBy the fortune of the gods, Mitch arrives at the Dwarven Monastery and calls out to his companions. The answer and usher him into the monastery's chapel. Quickly they explain what has happened up until now and make plans to investigate the room where they heard the animal noises.\n\nGathering around the door, Mitch opens it and steps in, the small study looks like it has been lived in recently. Gnawed bones litter the floor and tufts of gray fur can be seen here and there. An old stone desk sits in the center of the chamber, scratched and cracked in many places. The stench of wet fur hangs heavy in the air. Beyond is a larger room.\n\nGaping holes in the roof allow faint light to enter this ruined chamber. One of the stone columns that once supported the ceiling is toppled, its broken pieces littering the floor. A thick patch of black mushrooms hides in a nearby corner, giving the room an earthy scent that is barely noticeable above the stench of wet fur. From the shadows of the room emerge an immense wolf and a pair of timber wolves. It growls and lets out a long howl. Just outside the walls of the monastery, a pair of wolf howls answer.\n\nThe party quickly close the door and prepare for battle. Bittersweet and Mitch decide to wait near the door for the wolves to emerge. Zing steps back into the corridor and prepares his spells. Corrin and Gidyan rush back to the main entrance of the building they're in and shuts the double doors. Grimgar calls out for the others to climb to the roof and he rushes down one of the corridors and emerges outside, he begins to climb.\n\nLoud thuds are heard against both doors as the wolves try and batter them down. Eventually they succeed and the ancient wooden doors splinter under their weight. Battle is joined.\n\nMitch and Bittersweet land solid blows on the large wolf and Zing hits it with several Magic Missiles. Corrin rains holy fire onto the wolf but it avoids the attack. Gidyan's Ray of Sickness has more effect. Meanwhile Grimgar has made it to the roof of the monastery only to find out the others haven't followed him up. Suddenly a swarm of bats emerges from their resting place in the darkness beneath the roof and attack the half-orc. Grimgar swings his weapon side to side ineffectively.\n\nIn the corridor one of the wolves' trips Bittersweet and Zing burns a higher level spell to cast Burning Hands, killing that wolf and injuring the large one. Corrin and Gidyan are severely injured, they duck back into the chapel and close the door. Meanwhile Grimgar decides that escape would be his best course of action but the swarm overwhelms him and he drops unconscious from blood loss.\n\nMitch crushes the skull of the large wolf and moves to deal with the other wolf. Zing Misty Steps to the entrance of the monastery and the other two wolves give chase. Gidyan pokes his head outside and casts a Sleep spell on the two wolves sending one into slumber land. Grimgar succumbs to his wounds as the bats feast on his blood, his companions oblivious to his death.\n\nThe other wolf shakes Bittersweet around and renders the tiefling unconscious but Mitch is close by and bashes its skull in before it can go for the monk's throat. Zing waits for the final wolf to leap at him and grips it with a Shocking Grasp. The heavy wolf bowls him over. Zing recovers and heaves the singed dead wolf off his body.\n\nCorrin and Gidyan call out and Mitch responds for him and Bittersweet, Zing calls out from the courtyard. There is no response from Grimgar. They search the monastery and eventually find his body on the roof. At first they assume he lives as his body twitches beneath a furry blanket of bats but once they dispatch them with spells it is obvious that the half-orc is dead. Corrin takes the news of his death to heart, though Bittersweet is rather callous about the whole situation. Corrin drags the body to the altar and prays but he has no power to return Grimgar to life. Mitch respectively loots the half-orcs body and Bittersweet takes the silver bladed sword before pouring alcohol over the body and setting it alight much to Corrin's horror.\n\nCorrin waits in silence for the body to burn while the others explore the remaining rooms of the monastery. In their search they discover four peculiar crossbow bolts and a simple golden ring with a large red gemstone set into it that sparkles with an inner fire. In the lair of the large wolf they find a batch of Ironbloom Mushrooms as well as a well-made dwarven crossbow, a small fortune in gold coins, a Potion of Hill Giant Strength and a Wand of Light. Mitch claims the crossbow and ring for himself. Bittersweet takes the potion and they give the wand to Corrin. Once Grimgar's body has been reduced to ash Corrin gathers his ashes and the party decide to rest the night.\n\n**Day 37, Mirtul, 1489DR**\n\nThe next morning they head back to the Witch's Hut and begin to search it again. They find a magical shrunken head that allows the wearer to cast Magic Mouth on it. The uses for such an item appear to be entirely comical. Bittersweet decides to play around with the cauldron which comes to life and attacks him! The others rush to aid but to their horror the teifling is suddenly swallowed whole by the animated cooking pot. Fighting on the inside, the monk is able to do severe damage and eventually the cauldron stops moving. In a side room they discover an old, dried up corpse lying in bed. It is the body of the witch who clearly died peacefully in her sleep. Eventually they find the Rat's Tail ingredients and leave the hut.\n\n**Day 39, Mirtul, 1489DR**\n\nAfter stopping by the Lumber Mill to retrieve Grimgar's donkey Horace and the cart the party reach Falcon's Hollow. They quickly give the ingredients to Laurel and Gidyan assists in the crafting of the antidote. The others are introduced to the town's hero, a fat and very unattractive, halfling Barbarian. He explains that he just returned to town after weeks of hunting kobolds in the Other Forest. The party decide to stay a day or two in Falcon's Hollow to make certain the antidote works and too pick up the supply crate for Rillo Leadstopper.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED...\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "**Now I have decided to post this little story here, in case somebody was interested. I recently started a solo campaign with /r/Silmacil Gming, loosely based in the *World of Darkness* with a modern setting.**\n\n**The entire joke: While all those dark creatures are out there, the character – Kyla Hare – is a completely and utterly mundane human, who has no idea anything magic exists. ~~Because I wanted to try some horror-esque approach.~~ This are her adventures, when she unwillingly gets thrown into a not so mundane adventure. Well, or rather it is her first adventure, but I might add other stories later, if there is interest.**\n\n_______\n\nKyla Hare is an independent private detective in Edinburgh – or, to put it bluntly, a 27years old woman, who has read to much Sherlock Holmes. She had started out with studying Journalism, just to drop out, because she was a bit too lazy. Then she somehow managed to get a license to be a private investigator and ever since somehow scraps by. She is also a bit of a punk, though without being too striking in her exterior. \n\nShe has a dog named Watson (as I said, she read a bit too much Sherlock Holmes). A big Saint Bernard, with a good nose, that also happens to be a terrible coward. She also has a roommate called Jason, who actually finished his journalism degree and is an awful conspiracy theorist. \n\nSo, when her wallet was once again becoming thinner and thinner she was quite glad to have another client calling her. A “missing person”. Oh, well, stuff for the police, but that won't fill her stomach, so she told him to come to her office (which is conveniently located in her flat). \n\nThe guy got there. A young lawyer, it turned out, who had just returned to Edinburgh, after having studied in Oxford. In fact the “missing person” was not so much missing as that he had just lost contact with her. It was his high school sweetheart, Tina Wallace, and he wanted to reconnect with her, but while he was in Oxford at some time she had stopped answering his letters, with his letters being returned. \n\nThe young lawyer, James Rowe, told Kyla, about Tina's best friend from high school, a certain Maria Turner. \n\nKyla accepted the job and promised to contact him later. It seemed easy enough: Find Maria, ask her, maybe she knows something, otherwise there should be a record were Ms. Wallace had moved. And sure enough: She found Maria on Facebook in no time, contacted her and agreed to meet her the next day in the morgue, Maria was working in. Cozy, but... Oh, well.\n\nOh well, indeed. Kyla – and Watson – were kinda creeped out by the morgue – especially Watson who had to stay outside. Still: Kyla went inside and found Maria cutting up a corpse. Well, how nice. Soon though they were talking about a cup of tea and it turned out, that Maria, who had stayed in Edinburgh after highschool, had lost contact with Tina at the same time she had stopped to answer Thomas' letters. She had also been wondering, what had happened, but had reasoned with herself, that Tina had just left. After all Tina had been gone for weeks at a time before and so maybe she had just found somewhere better on one of her trips. Tina had had this little flower shop, which she had always left behind during her trips, but it closed a month before Maria thought that Tina had left – so maybe she had left because of the shop?\n\nA good start. But just to be thorough Kyla went to the local news archives and went through articles in the local town media concerning the flower shop (the “Marygold”) and also Jane Does, that showed up in the time where people lost contact with the girl. What was interesting about the flower shop, was a little story about a woman trying to sue Tina for threatening her. Turned out that she was never actively threatened, but had felt threatened never the less.\n\nWeird, but whatever. Back at home Kyla had to take care of a very moody dog, that had spent its entire day waiting somewhere outside for her. Never the less she had received a mail from Maria with the name and number of their former high school teacher, Mrs. Georgina Wall. Through her she learned that Tina had been very sickly in high school, missing a lot. Kyla met up with Mrs. Wall the next day in the school (some better, private high school).\n\nGrasping for straws Kyla asked her, whether she could have the dates when Tina was missing during high school – maybe there was a pattern or something. But she also received the name of the father of Tina. Edward Wallace.\n\nBack at home she tried to phone him and he was rather cold, urging her to lay down the case – almost threatening her. Which was the first time Kyla really started to suspect the girl to be dead – and that this was an actual missing person case, that had just never been put to the attention of the police. \n\nHowever, she was able to get the numbers of both the guy who had rented out Tina's appartment, as well as the lady, who had owned the space, where the flower shop had been in. So she phoned them and while the appartment owner was a real dick, not wanting to talk, the lady owning the store space was actually helpful and invited her for tea. (Much to the delight of the lady's son, who totally fell for Watson, when Kyla brought him along.)\n\nFrom her she learned that Tina just suddenly disappeared around the time the contact stopped and then a month after a couple of youngsters (meaning: In their early tweens) appeared with the key, saying Tina had asked them to clean out the shop and that she had to move away. Even though she found it strange, she had let them.\n\nBut there was something else, Kyla heard from that lady that she had heard from the teacher, before, too: Tina seemed a bit scary and threatening, when they met her before, but was a nice girl, once you knew her. A weird description.\n\nKyla contacted Maria over the information she had gotten from the flowershop lady: Those other youngsters. Maria told her, she had seen them with Tina before, though she had rarely spoken with them. She could give a good description though and said, they went to another school. She did not know which one, though. She knew the name of one of those kids, though: Sean. Apart from that she was also able to recall that one of those youngsters had had a very striking scar on his face. Something the shop lady remembered as well. She also told Kyla, that at least two of them were hiking in the same area she went to hike, too, and she had seen them there on weekends. So Maria and Kyla agreed to go there, if she did not found anything else.\n\nAfter that phone call, Kyla got also contacted by the teacher, who had gotten her the dates from when Tina had been missing and asked her to come by. Kyla agreed – she needed to get some shopping done, either way, even though it was already in the evening – and drove over (after getting her old car to drive, that is).\n\nShe got the files and was on her way out, when she saw a strange and rather pale creature hanging out in the parking lot, with Watson, who had staid in the car, barking like crazy. A bit in fear Kyla made her way to her car, got it to turn on with her fourth try and looked around, just to see the creature to have vanished. So she shrugged it off as her own imagination and Watson being the coward that he is.\n\nAfter this she spent half the night going through both the files she got from Mrs. Wall, as well as through alumini books from the better local high schools, to see whether she could find those three youngsters that hung out with Tina. All this reading brought two results: 1) Tina was missing once a month for 3 days on average. 2) The names of those three. Thia, Sean and Jonas. With the names the phone numbers were not hard to get.\n\nSo the next day she phoned Jonas – no avail. Apparently he had another number by now. She also phoned Sean, who picked up and reacted quite the same as the father: No, he had not seen her since then. She had moved to another city, which was the last thing he heard. “Better stop asking questions, Ms. Hare.” Yeah... And something in his voice told her, that yes: The girl was dead. But he hung up on her, before she could ask. \n\nAt this point Kyla was pretty sure it was wiser to get the police involved. There was a problem though: Her exgirlfriend Molly was working at the police in the crime department and it would be only logical to call her – but it was her exgirlfriend and hence... No, maybe she could actually find proof of the girl's death before.\n\nSo she went on that hiking trip on the next day – Saturday – together with Maria and her adopted teenage daughter, which was kinda weird, considering that Maria was only two years older then Kyla, while the girl was only eleven years younger. But... Oh, well. Jason, Kyla's roommate also came along, as he had heard that there was a “monster” in that park, where they were going to hike in, and being the conspiracy theorist he is, he simply could not resist.\n\nThey went hiking in the misty (and a bit rainy) forest with Watson being a bit skitish at first, as he rarely got onto forrests and hence thought it was a bit frightening. He loosened up after a while though, but then suddenly started barking and growling at something to deep in the woods for them to see. But that passed, too, and Kyla thought to herself, that it was probably just a rabbit or a fox. What certainly had been no rabbit or fox though, was whatever had broken into Maria's car, when they came back to the parking lot.\n\nKyla took a look at it and realized, that there were no marks of a crowbar, just weird markings, as if from a claw or something (Jason saw himself confirmed in his “monster” theories). Whoever had broken into the car had been looking for something, as they had looked through everything in there, even slashing open the seats.\n\nWhile Maria was in shock, Kyla called the police, who got there after a quarter of an hour. While they were answering questions, Kyla noticed that Watson was again growling towards the forest and with some persuation got him to follow whatever trail he was smelling. Thus they started another hike, with Kyla thinking, that the perpetrator was maybe still in the woods. So they tracked him – at least she was hoping the frightened, but agitated Watson was tracking the perpetrator and not just a rabbit.\n\nAfter a while she actually saw a hooded humanoid figure in the distance and started to run, hoping to get to whoever that was. She managed to find a clearing, where the figure seemed to have stopped near to what seemed to be a ritual site with some stone altar being there, with some meat put up on it. There was also an abnormally large owl, watching the altar, eating the meat when the figure ran and Kyla followed (though not without making some pictures with her mobile first).\n\nSoon she managed to actually catch up to the figure – though not without having cut herself several times on some twigs and the like. The figure had stopped, apparently realizing that there was no sense in trying to outrun her. When the woman turned around, Kyla saw that it was Thia, one of the strange friends of Tina's. She angrily asked Kyla, who she was and what she was doing here.\n\nWhen Kyla stepped up to her, Watson let of a whine and came close to Kyla, as two wolves appared by Thia's side. Angry wolves at that, though they did not attack, seemingly waiting for something. Now, this did freak Kyla out – especially as those wolves seemed a lot larger then what she knew from the zoo – but she still did not run away, leading to Thia once again asking her, what she wanted.\n\n“I am Kyla Hare, a private detective and I am looking for Tina Wallace, who has apparently vanished three years ago. You are Thia, right, one of her friends?” – “You should keep out of this.” – “Look. I would, but I was hired and cannot just let this alone.” She sighed. “Look. I was hired by Tina's other friends. They are worried. They wanna know what happened to Tina. I suspect she is dead, but they deserve answers.”\n\nApparently the mention of the friends somewhat made Thia hesitate for a moment. She gave some kind of sign and the wolves retreated, before telling Kyla, she would find answers in a certain direction. \n\nEven though this seemed cryptic, Kyla went in the direction, she was pointed at and soon enough found what looked like a graveyard of some kind, even though the apparent graves had no grave stones on them. Now this was a pretty clear “Yeah, she is dead” – as clear as Kyla could apparently hope to get it from these people. But it also smelled of foul play, not to speak of that Tina was maybe not the only missing person to be found on this graveyard. \n\nSo she used GoogleMaps to at least tag her rough location, to report this to the police, as well as making some pictures of the graves... Which the owl did not like. Yeah, the owl was now here, attacking Kyla, apparently trying to get the mobile from her hands. As if! Cursing colorfully Kyla ran back to the underwood, with the still whining Watson by her side. \n\nTo her greatest delight she soon found two things: She was completely lost and had no time to look up her location with her mobile, as suddenly the two wolves were behind her growling. Just what a great day! So she ran. She ran the fastest she could but after a while the wolves catched up with her. One of the wolves actually biting into her coat – apparently trying to pull it off. \n\nKyla grapped into her other pocket and found she had taken her pocket knife with her, which she – in her panic – thrusting it into the wolves snout. The wolves stumbled backwards and she was not to wait and look whether it would flee or attack again. So she ran on and found herself at the Loch in the park.\n\nPutting her mobile into an evidence back she just jumped after Watson, when the dog went into the lake. She did not even know whether wolves could swim. Well, the wolves did not follow and there was a fisher in the middle of the lake pulling her and the frightened dog out. He brought her to a pier, where there was also a small restaurant. The owner allowed her to shower, as it was early autumn and she was freezing. Of course nobody believed her she had been attacked by wolves.\n\nAn hour later the worried Maria was there with a rental, to pick Kyla up, while Jason was a bit disappointed that she had apparently just been attacked by a normal wolf. At least they believed her. \n\nWhen Kyla was home, she got another shower before taking care of the multiple cuts, scratches and bruises, she had sustained, thank to owl and forrest. She also went through the pictures she had taken. While her mobile had survived the swim, it was still badly scratched – thanks to the bloody owl.\n\nKyla hesitated for a moment, before deciding to call Molly.",

        "text": "Hey there! Been reading here for a while, thought I might start writing some of my stories for you guys. I'm currently playing a Shadowrun 5e game, with a few draws to Deus Ex (mostly being availability of and attitude towards cyberware, and some corporations and NPCs.) So here's the cast:\n\n\nDahzdbog: our driver and face. No augs. Also a foster sibling to my character, yet they've fallen out of touch and don't know that one is the other. \n\n\nLedoborec: This is me! I'm playing a decker (pretty much a hacker by today’s standards, for those unfamiliar), Czech native. She has augs, but they're all concealed to the naked eye.\n\n\nFleur- Deaf French cat burglar and easily most adorable teammate. No augs.\n\n\nAnd then we have our last character. At this point, he doesn't have a name, but we know he's essentially Adam Jensen- essentially a cyber-enhanced weapon who never asked for this.\n\n\nWe open on the meet to get our first job and meet the teammates. Fleur can't make the beginning of the session, unfortunately, so it's just the three of us. Ledoborec arrives first, in a car that's about as big as a Prius with the tail cut off. She arrives in the warehouse district, and while the building appears almost abandoned, there's a generator running out back and the door is locked. She's in her fancy dress for the meeting- which is seeming to have been a bad idea, given the area. Then, Dahzdbog shows up, disguised as a mailman. The two of them chat a bit, waiting for the meeting time. Our friendly neighborhood Adam Jensen suddenly arrives, and one of my favorite conversations I've seen in gaming happened.\n\n\nGM: Okay, so your name was…?\n\n\nJensen: Shit, one sec. Lemme just find a name generator.\n\n\nWe all sit silently, awaiting the majesty of his character’s alias. Then he comes back. \n\n\nJenson: yeah, so, let's see… Ruin.. Eh. Jack? Too cliche. \n\n\nThen he sees it. The best one on the list. The only name to fit his character.\n\n\n“My name is Toast Blindfire.”\n\n\nThere goes our serious motif. The rest of the meet, Dahzdbog talks about the job while Ledo gets stern with Toast for playing with his cybershades during a meeting. We get briefed on the job, and it goes like this: a group of gangers in the aug quarter stole some experimental “simsense technology” (what I assume is actually something else entirely.) This guy needs it back, and is willing to spend 10k to each person to get it done. We naturally accept. The team then decides to go to a bar to continue planning- at which point our last teammate arrives. Fleur is sitting at the bar, and when we enter, not knowing we were supposed to be with her IC, rolls perception to tell what she can about us. \n\n\nFleur: wait, uh… Shit. I forgot to put points in perception.\n\n\nGM: roll it anyway!\n\n\nSo, Fleur gets a critical glitch with 2 dice. The GM tries to think of consquences, but can't. This is the point Toast jokingly says, “She finds me incredibly attractive.”\n\n\n“Yeah, we'll go with that.”\n\n\nSo we, within the first hour, have a one-way relationship in the group. While I'm talking her out of flirting with the man more than twice her age called Toast, an NPC walks in and sits down. He's the edgiest guy you've ever seen in your life, with all the shadowrunner tropes- complete with not one, but two katanas. He looks too young to drink, and with bad experiences involving underage addictions, Ledoborec tries to talk to him and promptly gets shoved on her ass, punched, and demeaned. He walks away after that. So, we continue planning, so more legwork, and get this plan: \n\n\nWe would go up to the building full of gangers that had stolen the prototype. Toast and Dahzdbog would start a fight out front as a distraction, while Fleur hopped in from the roof. Ledo would provide matrix overwatch, and take out cameras. So, I decide to try and get control over the cameras the day before the job. But, as I'm working on it, an enemy security spider sees me snooping around in the matrix and throws a dataspike at me. I brick his deck, but not before he can deal some damage to me. I tell the team that, since there's no time limit on the job and working with injuries is a bit difficult (plus I need time to repair my deck), we're going to wait for 2 days to do the job. So, two days later, we pull up. I start trying to get in, but with the enemy’s deck still broken, their network is down. I just view the microcameras on everyone’s armor while I wait for something to happen. Then I see something on Fleur’s camera about the same time she does- a pile of dead people, all seemingly cut with swords. Our friend from earlier, known as Edgelord by the group, reveals himself carrying the prototype. So, Fleur takes her only obvious action here: tackle him out of a window on to the street. Toast gets there around the same time, and we were able to get him down before he rolled for initiative and attacking, thank god. We got him cuffed and in the back of our van, and we were about to roll out, until.. \n\n\nFleur: Oh wait, GM, I forgot that I have that quality that makes me give a mark at every crime scene I go to.\n\n\nGM: Okay. What's your mark? \n\n\nFleur: She has to spray paint something at every place she gets into.\n\n\nGM: Okay. You do that, then you head out.\n\n\nAt this point, we tell the guy that it's just business, and we're sorry, then we dump him in a spot of the aug quarter that we know as a good body dumping spot and leave. We take the prototype back to the guy, get paid and get karma, then leave.\n\n\nEPILOGUE:\n\n\nYou're probably still wondering how this is terrorism on our part, right? Well, after the session, we decided to set up an RP server on Discord so we can keep going a bit in between sessions. At one point, Fleur says she checks the news and our GM pops in.\n\n\n“Yeah, you turn on the news. You see the building you were at yesterday, surrounded by police. The news reporter starts talking about what the police think happened here- they say that this was a known terrorist cell out of France, due to the graffiti, and they (us) are clearly well organized and extremely deadly. The terrorist cell was able to destroy all evidence of being here, but our detectives are working on solving this.” \n\n\nThe entire team sits in stunned silence for a minute, and all say pretty much the same thing: “Wait, wasn't that us though?”\n\n\nThat's the end of this story, but if you guys liked it and our GM decides to be around again sometime this month, I'll have more!\n\n(sorry if the formatting is awful, writing this from my phone)",

        "text": "[A far, far time ago, in a galaxy long away, there was a much smaller subset of that galaxy containing a star, some stuff floating around said star, and some things living on the stuff](https://redd.it/52d11l). A few of those very things, a small adventuring party on their fantastical bullshit world, were having 'interesting times'.\n\n[Jello Shot, the cannon-wielding slime](http://imgur.com/IiL7PFg), was having an argument with [Cinder Sparks, the changeling oracle](http://imgur.com/Emday0T). Jello Shot's problem was this: Cinder had forced him into doing something absolutely repulsive, IE apologizing to someone he tried to kill (a suprisingly powerful talking cat). This had quite the impression on the poor Jello Shot, and taught him the valie of confronting his problems (and being mean to Cinder). Cinder's problem was this: She had a Hag mother, who was said to be ruthless and cruel, but her human father was an unabashed racist that had basically abandoned her, and she was deathly afraid of confronting either of them. But more specifically, her problem was Jello Shot, because Jello Shot had crammed her into a bag of holding and taken off for the hag coven before Cinder could fight her way free.\n\nCinder's Mother, a hag named Drella, was indeed a ruthless sort, as Jello Shot discovered. She and the rest of her coven openly discussed how they would retaliate against people who disrespected them, gather information about the surrounding areas, and generally impose their will. However on closer examination this turned out to be exactly what the party was prone to doing, so this wasn't exactly counted against them. Drella also questioned Jello Shot at length about the well-being of her daughter, somehow remaining oblivious to the twitching, whimpering bag carried over Jello Shot's shoulder.\n\nThis required further investigation. Jello Shot then proceeded to hit up a \"friend\" of his- [a necromancer by the name of Richard](http://imgur.com/sZuNYz5). Richard was not friends with Jello Shot. When they had first met, Jello Shot had accused him of being evil and then devoured his garden. Richard also had a large amount of problems with Psychopomps, those spirits who presided over death and souls moving into the afterlife. And boy howdy did they hate necromancy. In fact, Richard's familiar, a [Nosoi psychopomp](http://www.pathfinderwiki.com/mediawiki/images/thumb/9/96/Nosoi.jpg/250px-Nosoi.jpg) by the name of Jeremy, had basically forced his way into Richard's life to denounce necromancy and get him to 'change his ways' by cleaning up undead abominations and capturing harmful spirits. So in general, Richard was the guy who got pushed around by everybody, and now the giant garden-devouring slime had returned, dumped a flaming eight-year-old onto his doorstep, and demanded that Richard tell him about hag covens.\n\nA large amount of discussion took place, and it was eventually concluded that Richard, Cinder and Jello Shot could all work toward some common goals. Richard was trying to track down some wayward souls that had taken control of a [muderous lich- the same one, in fact, that the party had almost died to](https://redd.it/4sfgel). And perhaps a Hag coven could assist with that business. Jello Shot approved of both parts of the plan- the part where the lich dies, and the part where Cinder has to face her fears or be incredibly miserable. *He really liked that last part*. Cinder did not get a vote in this, because she was pouting.\n\nSo, finally, the trio headed back to the coven to discuss some things. And Drella was pleased as could be to finally meet her daughter, who would hopefully grow to be a powerful Hag! Cinder was less thrilled, but as Jello Shot and Richard talked with Drella about terms, Cinder used the time to poke and prod around all the Hag stuff happening at the coven. Turns out, Drella was a master gumbo chef (which Jello Shot appreciated immensely), and her coven-mates were more than willing to show Cinder the ins and outs of hagglin'. It was actually surprisingly pleasant, the mood only being truly spoiled when the hags set to working a scrying spell and discovered that the lich had broken out of his containment and was coming. Like, RIGHT NOW.\n\nWithout much time to gather supplies, the party set about creating an impromptu ambush. The lich was a master of firearms, but the party had the home field advantage- and a coven of hags working up a hell of a spell to seal the lich's soul away (for later reuse). Jello Shot deforested the surrounding area for lumber, and then used the logs to construct a wooden palisade. Cinder called in a favor from an NPC friend and managed to get a goddamned mounted death-ray shipped in on express delivery. Richard assisted by casting buffs and summoning a few undead minions. Then, everyone hunkered down and waited.\n\nWhen the lich arrived, he couldn't get a clear shot at the party from his vantage point, and was reduced to firing potshots. The trouble was, every time he made an attack, Jello Shot would respond with cannonfire, Cinder would use prepared-action Scorching Rays, and Richard would send undead scouts to nail down his location. And the lich couldn't retreat, because the ritual that the hags were doing would nail him no matter how far he ran. He had to get inside the barrier, and he had a way. He could *burrow*.\n\nHis first underground ambush caught cinder for a LOT of damage, firing upwards through the ground and smashing through her meager armor. Cinder couldn't punch through the dirt with her ray attacks, but jello shot's cannon most DEFINITELY could. And that opened up the way for the GIANT GODDAMNED DEATH RAY, which was being operated by Jello Shot's familiar, a magic chicken with delusions of world domination. The shot nailed the lich, just barely, and did TONS of damage. The lich was not eager to pull that shit again, so the game of necromantic whack-a-mole was over for the time being.\n\nThe party decided to press their advantage, and with ears to the ground (literally), they tried to track down where the lich had fled to. Because, while he was burrowing, he wasn't being particularly fast, and he had a nasty habit of muttering to himself. They finally discovered him, underground, directly in the CENTER of the clearing, beneath the giant dead oak tree that the Hags used as a focus for their rituals. The souls that had been powering the lich were doing a last, desperate end run by pouring themselves out of their old body and into a new one- that of a massive, malicious treant! O SNAP!\n\nThe treant lashed out with claws of ice and shadow, carving up Jello Shot and Richard while Cinder made a hasty retreat. But powerful that it was, the tree-monster was not particularly mobile, and had just run into a fatal flaw in its plan- Jello Shot's familiar was still piloting the doom laser, and Richard and Cinder pooled their magic to literally *melt the wood with fire and necromancy*. Jello Shot, now out of cannonballs, screamed for the hags to do something, ANYTHING that would help.\n\nSo, low on options, the Hags made a small alteration to the spell so that the souls of the lich wouldn't be contained (as they were currently wrecking the thing meant to contain it), but instead to be plane shifted into the realm of the psychopomps, specifically into the domain of Old Grim, the actual literal grim reaper himself. And boy howdy was Grim interested in harvesting a whole bunch of wayward souls. He swung his big scythe down into the screaming face of the tree-monster over and over, until he finally got the blade wedged between its eyes (because even the personification of death can roll a natural 1). With one last round of flailing branch-claws and another volley of spells, the tree-monster was slain, and Grim harvested the souls and sent them into the afterlife personally.\n\nLICH DEFEATED! Everyone high-fived, congratulated themselves, and tried not to notice how the Hags were bitching about their tree being absolutely destroyed and their spooky forest being devoured. Oh, and the party had soooorta promised the Hags that Cinder would become an apprentice of the hags. Which wasn't, you know, the end of the world, but it was a bit unsettling...\n\nJello Shot decided that he'd had enough excitement and wandered off to cause vast ecological damage, while Cinder, Richard, and the Hags had to attend one last little shindig. See, you don't just call up the personification of death on a moment's notice and then expect him to just go on his merry way- there's such a thing as POLITENESS. So they all sat down to a nice cuppa' tea. Grim was very pleasant and polite, and the Hags reciprocated- old world courtesy and the like. Richard was extremely nervous about the whole affair, as he was pretty firmly on the Psychopomp's shit list, and Grim was just about as Psychopomp as you could freakin' get. It was a bit awkward. Especially when Grim started asking pointed questions about *why Richard was there, fighting an undead abomination*. Richard responded that he was trying to make a good name for necromancers by doing some good deeds, and getting rid of some even bigger threats to the natural order.\n\nGrim politely asked who had put him onto this peculiar idea, and if it was, say, a low-ranking bird-shaped psychopomp. Specifically, the one who was supposed to have prevented the lich from forming in the first place, and was now scrabbling for some way to fix the problem without drawing attention to his failures.\n\nRichard looked over to his familiar, that Nosoi Psychopomp by the name of Jeremy, and gave him ***a look***.\n\nAs things wrapped up, Cinder made certain to great Old Grim personally, and invite him to a few other events. Grim said he would consider it, if he could get some more of Drella's wonderful gumbo. Whiiiiich immediately led to Cinder badgering her mother for the recipie. Cinder was taking to Hagging surprisingly fast.\n\nNow that they had the Lich taken care of, the party was practically in the clear! What more could surprise them?",

        "text": "First time posting here, just a quick story about making threats and following up on them!\n\n----\n\n*Some quick background... I have played a lot of necromancers in my day. Often times, they are simply scholars of dark arts or curious spellcasters with a fascination with the dead. In the campaign where this tale springs from I was playing a character that could really be considered evil. His goals (at least the goals of the party) were fairly noble in cause (we were slowly freeing the land from the rule of a corrupt race of dragons) but Jor, my half-orc cleric was a mean SOB.*\n\n---\n\nThis tale begins on the third major leg of our journey. We had previously learned of the Dragon's plans at the capital, but to travel there by foot would have taken us weeks. We made up our mind to take a faster way instead by sailing along the coast around the continent. After reaching the nearest seaport and learning that the only boats available were small trading ships (not built for the high seas) we formulated a plan to commandeer a real boat. We posed as rich traders and sailed into open waters to draw the attention of a pirate crew, but when the y boarded we ambushed them and sailed their ship back to shore. We began talking among ourselves about what supplies we needed, claiming cabins, etc. (I was given the largest captain's quarters despite not being our party's leader because the group knew I needed space for my... experiments.)\n\nAs we were going about our business, an argument was breaking out between our leader - a daring human Sorceror - and the captured crew. Many of them did not approve of the way we took their boat but we still needed a crew to man the ship. Some were free men who worked the ship for a share... others were hired labor. The pirates wanted the ship to pass on to them, while the workers were using this opportunity to argue for higher wages. \n\nMy character would have been happy killing the lot of them, but knew that the rest of the party wouldn't agree to that (they only let me animate the dead of our fallen enemies).\n\nAnyways, as this one pirate was getting into my friend's face arguing with him, my friend decides to lay down the law and shouts back at him **\"Listen, you have two options here. You work for us and will be paid as we see fit, or you walk the plank!\"** He points to the side of the boat where a plank juts outwards.\n\nThis was surely supposed to be an intimidating line to whip this bunch of potential mutineers into shape, but the man quickly retorted back:\n\n\"But sir... we are docked at shore... the water is calm and clear, there are no sharks in these parts, and I have been swimming since I was a child! Do you mean that I can peacefully swim home?\" He even chuckled at his own joke...\n\nMy Sorceror begins searching for words but I take the lead after with a quiet application of bull's strength. Without a word I step to the side of the deck, grab the overhanging plank and rip it from the ship with a loud crack. I step to the front of the captain's quarters, open my door, and set the plank in front of it.\n\nThe rebellious pirate is confused, but my party immediately catches on and begins pushing him forwards, now with weapons drawn. My room is unlit so he can only see shadows inside, but he still approaches hesitantly, confused at what we are suggesting. We lead him to the plank lying only a couple inches above the wooden deck around it, and we make him walk. The color drains from his face as the smells of death begin to emanate from inside the open cabin, and we have to force him the last few steps. With a shove he is inside and I slam the door behind him, before heart-rending shouts can be heard.\n\n---\n\nAfter the incident, the rest of the crew was much more willing to work with us, although a few abandoned the ship at the first chance they could. There were still a handful who continued to vocalize their complaints until a couple days later when their fallen friend's corpse showed up to help them work the oars. \n\nThe plank itself was nailed down in that spot, although we unfortunately never had a chance to use it again.",

        "text": "So some guys on a discord and I have been trying to get this going for awhile, a weekly game night where we play MegaMek, the online version of the Battletech tabletop game, and tonight we finally were able to get 5 people together to play MegaMek online. We all joined into the server, and our designated rules guru informed us the first matches would be done with only heavy mechs using 3025 tech, that writes out a lot of technological complexity and means we're all going to be on a roughly even playing field.\n\nFirst match is a 5 way free for all, with a [Marauder,](http://www.sarna.net/wiki/images/b/b2/3025-Marauder-Classics.png) [Hammerhands,](http://www.sarna.net/wiki/images/thumb/7/73/Hammerhands.jpg/565px-Hammerhands.jpg.png) [Warhammer,](http://www.sarna.net/wiki/images/8/8a/3025-Warhammer-Classics.png) [Flashman,](http://www.sarna.net/wiki/images/9/96/FLS-Flashman.png) and [Orion](http://www.sarna.net/wiki/images/0/0b/3025_Orion1.jpg) showing up to the fight, all solid heavy mechs. We position our mechs to start, and due to a slight misunderstanding, the Flashman spawns on top of the Warhammer, while the Marauder spawns in a forest between the Hammerhands and Orion. Warhammer and Flashman begin beating the snot out of each other on a mountain, with the Warhammer holding the high ground, while the Hammerhands and Orion encroach on the Marauder as it attempts to hide in the forest around it. After several turns of bumbling but vicious attacks the Warhammer player has to leave, and his mech is effectively removed from the battle, but the Flashman is still separated from the action by a mountain, as the Orion, Hammerhands and Marauder are engaging more directly. \n\nThe Hammerhands' twin autocannon-10s are a force to reckon with, as the Marauder continues to avoid engagement using the forest, and the Orion is flung onto the ground by the impact of a full volley from the Hammer. The Orion's misfortune is not over yet though, it attempts to stand back up, but pilot error causes it to lose its balance and simply fall back over in the other direction, with the impact knocking the pilot unconscious. At this point the Marauder takes an opportunity to stomp off a large chunk of the Orion's leg, destroying its hip and knee as the Hammerhands continues to close.\n\nThe Hammerhands looks hard for a clean shot as the Marauder attempts to Vietcong its opponent to death, using dense foliage to evade return fire and confound pursuit from the slower mech. Eventually as the Hammerhands and Marauder play cat and mouse, the Orion pilot wakes up, attempts to stand one last time, fails again, and simply ejects. Then as the Hammerhands searches for its prey the Flashman finally enters the fray, a long range burst scything into the Hammerhands and detonating an ammo bin instantly, annihilating the mech in a massive fireball. With only the Marauder and Flashman still in the fray, the Flashman manages to trip and fall to its demise trying to traverse the downward slope of the mountain, or maybe it overheated, I wasn't really paying attention by that point.\n\nSo we decide to do one more match, 2v2, 150 tons per team.They offer up a [Thunderbolt](http://www.sarna.net/wiki/images/f/f4/3025_thunderbolt.jpg) and [Guillotine](http://www.sarna.net/wiki/images/b/b1/Guillotine.jpg) as our opponents, both dangerous and jump capable heavy mechs, while we offer up a [Black Knight](http://www.sarna.net/wiki/images/c/c4/BL-7-KNTBLACKKNIGHT.png) heavy mech and an under-tonned [Stalker](http://www.sarna.net/wiki/images/5/5f/3025_Stalker1.jpg) assault mech. The map this time is even more mountainous, massive peaks and hills disrupt sight lines and pander to our jump capable opposition, but my Stalker and the Black Knight are much more formidable opponents at range, and immediately open fire on the Thunderbolt as it had not taken cover behind a mountain, the repeated impacts rattling it until it collapsed onto the ground in a heap. The Guillotine attempted to attack from high up to cover the Thunderbolt's recovery, but a burst of long range fire from my Stalker quickly pushed it back down. The battle was flowing strongly in favor of the longer ranged team, but the Black Knight attempted to push forward, overextending and isolating itself.  I advised the Knight to fall back towards me, as the other team would not risk the line of fire of my Stalker, oh how wrong I was.\n\nThe Guillotine, still holding a dramatic height advantage, decided to go all or nothing, and leaped into the air, aiming to bring its 70 ton frame crashing down on the Black Knight's head as it tried to withdraw. In a spectacular lightshow the Guillotine suffered multiple strong hits from both me and the Black Knight, but gravity is not so easily stopped, and it crashed down on the Black Knight mostly intact, both mechs overwhelmed by the impact. The two quickly got back up as the Thunderbolt intervened, then the Black Knight and Guillotine quickly and simultaneously shot each others' head off. Both mechs instantly disabled it now came down to the Thunderbolt against an undamaged Stalker, I attempted to back up, hammering away with my considerable arsenal as the Thunderbolt drew closer, at one point the two mechs even exchanged punches ([no idea how though](http://www.sarna.net/wiki/images/a/a1/STK-Stalker.png)) but then the Thunderbolt properly leveraged its superior mobility, using speed and jump jets to stay behind my Stalker, delivering blow after blow into the vulnerable rear armor, but the Stalker's arms are able to rotate 360* behind it, so for every blow he dealt to my back he received one to his front, until finally heat and damage attrition forced him to disengage, an opportunity I quickly exploited to build some range as he attempted to formulate a new plan.\n\nFinally he made the decision that he had to attack, I had no means to pursue him into a better position and he had no means to engage me at long range, so he would simply try and hammer me down in a straight fight. As he entered the open we turned to face each other, this was it, do or die, it all ended now, we both fired every weapon we had...and then missed with all of them. With both of us left standing there with egg on our faces, I was decided in worse shape, firing all of my weapons had generated so much heat that my mech had shutdown, and I collapsed onto the ground, an easy and vulnerable target. The Thunderbolt unwisely chose to unload his surviving weapons into my mostly intact center torso, barely penetrating the armor as I powered back up and reoriented my thoroughly battered mech on its feet. This was the real final showdown, but there would be no exchange, firing off all of my short range weapons the volley managed to bite deep into his mech, cooking off a rack of spare missiles and consuming his mech in an enormous fireball just as it had my Hammerhands.\n\nWe can't wait for next week's game night.",

It was then I remembered about one of my favorite series of books growing up: Fighting Fantasy.  \n\nThese books were amazing.  A combination of choose your own adventure and pen and paper roleplaying game, they allowed little me to experience the thrill of Dungeons and Dragons in a solitary setting, as I was the only kid in the neighborhood interested in such things.  \n\nSo I have recently started a weekly series where I play through the books and write a comedic and crass story describing my adventures.  I hope to continue to do so and I also hope its ok for me to post an outside link here.  If not, I will make a text post.  I am currently on my third part of the first book \"The Warlock of Firetop Mountain\".  \n\nSo I would like to present to you [Fightingest Fantasy](https://fightingestfantasy.wordpress.com/), tales of high adventure and the lowest of jinx.  Constructive criticism is greatly appreciated as I am still a bit rusty. Thank you.",

        "text": "This is a story from when me and my friends first started playing D&amp;D about three years ago. It was the first major questline they engaged in, and led to situations both weird, wacky and sad. It was all topped off with a climactic battle, an incredible boss fight and the near-destruction of an entire city.\n\nIt's a pretty long story, so I'll post it in several parts. That way it'll be an easier read, and you'll get an opportunity to give me tips for improving my writing, which I would really appreciate! \n\nI'll try to format it so it's comfortable to read. Hope you enjoy reading it.\n\n---------------------------------\n**Our characters**\n\nThe party consist of three people:\n\n- **Garon** the half-orc druid (Neutral). Pretty mellow guy. Plays the neutral alignment very well, but enjoys going along with the antics of the other two. Has lived by himself in a forest for most of his life.\n\n- **Gorath** the half-orc ranger (Neutral). Very focused on roleplaying as opposed to combat, but loves fights as well, and plays to win. Very efficient. Comes from another continent.\n\n- **Bogrol** the elven barbarian (Chaotic Neutral). The definition of the Chaotic Neutral that everyone hates, but with enough lovable tomfoolery to make you forget it and roll with him. Does whatever he needs to make something happen, always first to do something, and has a pathological need to insert himself into any and all situations. This works out quite well in this group, however, as the other two are more laid-back, and his stupidity creates a lot of interesting situations.\n\n**Intro**\n\nThe party are all level 2. They have just arrived in the city of Tinderbrick after narrowly escaping charges of banditry, arson and murder in a nearby town (they were, in fact, innocent, but managed to get themselves implicated by taking a stolen necklace reclaimed from the bandits for themselves). The plan is to stop in Tinderbrick for supplies and then move on northwards for a big tournament. This would not work out.\n\nAs they arrive in Tinderbrick, a pretty vanilla town that seems to have seen slightly better days, they soon hear rumours of strange lights in the sky a couple miles outside the city. They smell a quest and start asking around some more. Garon and Goran make sure to keep Bogrol close at all times, so that he doesn't get them thrown in jail again. They eventually end up at the city hall, where they somehow manage to get an audience with the mayor.\n\nThe mayor, Eddie, after fending off several questions from Bogrol about his opinion on milk (this would be a running theme for Bogrol), tells them that over the last few months blue lights have been spotted over the mountain range west of the city. The lights have increased in frequency over the last few weeks, leading to an unsettling mood creeping over the city. He assures them it is most likely (definitely not) a natural phenomenon. Gorath the ranger suspects the mayor knows more than he's letting on, but leaves his suspicions be for the moment.\n\nThe party immediately volunteer to investigate this phenomenon, and are given the name of the mayor of the biggest of three villages that are located near the mountain range and that are under Tinderbrick's jurisdiction and dominion: a man named Kingsley, who is also the mayor's brother. They waste no time exiting the city and setting course for the village of Elm.\n\n**A phantom menace**\n\nAs the party enters Elm, they are soon met with Kingsley, a huge bald-headed black man (think a young Michael Clark-Duncan) with a deep voice. He's a much more open and down-to-earth man than his brother Eddie, and whereas Eddie had let his impressive physique fade with his time in office, Kingsley was built like a brick wall.\n\nKingsley and his aide, an old man named Gregory, brings them up to speed on the situation: there are three villages under Tinderbrick's dominion, Elm being the biggest of them with a population of two or three hundred people. However, no one has heard word from the other two villages in several days, and those who ventured there to investigate have not returned. The village is in a state of general fear and uneasiness, not made any better by the ominous flashing blue lights that have become all the more frequent of late. The party ensures Kingsley that they will get to the bottom of this, and ride for one of the other villages.\n\nThe ride takes a few hours, and by the time they get to the village the sun has set and evening has come. The village is unusually quiet and there are no lights in any of the windows. Soon they notice shapes moving among the buildings and in the treeline. Bogrol immediately draws his twohanded greatsword and charges at the closest shape, 60 feet away, while Gorath calls him an idiot and Garon shakes his head in dismay.\n\nBogrol splits the person - for it is a person - in two, roaring with triumph. Another person shuffles close from around a corner and attacks him. He is hit, and sees now that the person is obviously dead. A zombie. A brief fight occurs, with Bogrol eventually slaying two more zombies while Gorath backs him up with his bow, but Garon notices that the zombies are increasing in numbers, and fast. Their moans increase in volume and frequency, and soon Bogrol is flanked. He starts taking more and more hits, and at the behest of Gorath and Garon decides to retreat. However, while the two half-orcs make to ride off, Bogrol turns his horse towards the village center and charges. Again Gorath shouts obscenities while Garon shakes his head.\n\nBogrol rides past the zombies and into the village center, where he quickly realizes that they are vastly outnumbered by the now several dozen strong undead that are closing in on him. Then a voice calls out: \"*Hey! You there! Help me, please!*\" \n\nA villager, trapped on the roof of a house. He appears alone and unharmed, but exhausted and terrified.\n\nBogrol exchanges a few quick words of encouragement, calling for the man to assist him in his valiant struggle with the zombies. The man refuses: \"*What?! Are you insane?!*\" To which Bogrol responds that yes, yes he is. The man is not given a second chance, as Bogrol finally realizes that Gorath and Garon are right, and charges towards the wall of zombies in order to break through them.\n\nA few attacks of opportunity, topped off with a natural 20, from the zombies, makes quick work of that plan. Bogrol's horse buckles and sends him flying over the undead, to land about 10 feet past them. He shouts for Garon to pick him up, and after a moment's hesitation Garon rides up and pulls him onto his horse. Gorath is still cursing Bogrol for his stupidity, while Bogrol insults their courage and insists they could have taken the zombies had they only backed him up. Garon ignores them both and focuses on petting his horse for the remainder of the ride back to Elm.\n\n**Defend or evacuate?**\n\nIt is the middle of the night and all the villagers are sleeping when the party returns to Elm, shouting for them to raise the alarm. The villagers soon gather, and panic spreads as snippets of the party's story makes its way thorugh their ranks. Then Kingsley and Gregory arrive and they are taken to his house.\n\nAfter giving Kingsley a full update on what they found in the outlying village, Kingsley is visibly stricken, and a fierce discussion of what they should do follows. It eventually boils down to two alternatives:\n\n1. Gorath insists that the undead they saw at the village would probably not be the only ones, and informs them that he also spotted several animated skeletons among their numbers. He counsels a full evacuation of Elm, back to Tinderbrick, where their walls would protect them.\n\n2. Bogrol insists on the opposite, that a defense of the village is their only viable option if they wish to save its inhabitants. He appeals to their sense of honor and valor, declaring any man, woman or child that leaves a coward.\n\nGorath seems to have swayed Kingsley to his side at first, as Kingsley makes it clear that the well-being of the villagers in his care is his number one priority. However, Bogrol again insists that they would not make it back to Tinderbrick, assuring him that the undead are already on their way and would catch up to the slow-moving villagers. There is a fierce back-and-forth between the half-orc and the elf, eventually stopped as Garon interrupts, telling them that someone needs to go to the third village and warn and evacuate it before it is too late.\n\nEventually it is decided that Kingsley will ride to Tinderbrick to ask his brother for help, while the party - assisted by Gregory - begin preparing for either an evacuation or a siege. Another discussion follows, until finally the dice are rolled. While Gorath rolls a 19 plus 2 from his Charisma, Bogrol rolls an 18 plus 3 from his Charisma. Kingsley does not know what to do.\n\nBefore a decision can be made about the village, Garon walks off to find his horse. Gorath decides to come with him so that he does not go alone, leaving Bogrol to assist Kingsley with whatever he decides. They find their horses and ride off for the third village. Kingsley asks Gregory to inform the village of their situation and have them prepare for both eventualities.\n\nAs soon as the half-orcs and Kingsley are out of sight, Bogrol goes about rounding up a small militia, ordering them to construct spiked obstacles and dig pits, preparing them for a siege. Gregory decides to leave him to it while he organizes the rest of the village for a possible evacuation.\n\n**Unexpected help**\n\nAs they arrive at the third village, Garon and Gorath quickly realize that the village is already lost. There are, however, several survivors fleeing towards them as they approach. They spur their mounts up the steep hill leading to the village, and are met with a horrible massacre. Men, women and children alike are being cut down and ripped apart by zombies and skeletons with glowing blue eyes.\n\nThey prepare to leave with the last fleeing villagers when Garon spots a little girl about to be cut down by a skeleton. He charges at it, but not fast enough. The undead swings its sword, but is suddenly knocked to the ground as someone crashes into it. Before it can get to its feet the stranger raises a broomstick and smashes the abomination to pieces. The man wipes his brow and exhales in relief, picks up the girl and gives her to Garon on his horse before jumping on himself. They ride off back towards Elm, hoping it isn't too late for them as well.\n\nOn the way back, the young man with the broomstick introduces himself as, well, Broom. He explains that he arrived in the village only days before, visiting with the hope of finding the house of a dead relative. He thanks them profusely for the rescue and laments the deaths of so many he'd hoped to get to know better.\n\nSoon they come upon two skeletons attacking a fleeing villager. Gorath jumps off his horse and attacks the one with his swords, while Broom does the same with the other. While Gorath makes quick work of his foe, Broom struggles, and after taking a wound he raises his arms and releases a torrent of glimmering frost blue energy at the creature. It freezes in place and breaks apart as Broom pushes it over with his broom. Revealed as a spellcaster, he informs them that he has certain knowledge of arcana that might help them fight the undead horde, maybe even discover their source. Garon and Gorath welcomes the help and they set off for Elm again.\n\nBack in Elm, Bogrol has whipped up a small force of men fit to bear arms, declaring them inferior to himself, but good for front line fodder. He assures them, however, that their sacrifice will be for the good of their loved ones. The men are... less than impressed, but keep working on the spikes and the pits that will eventually form a half-circle around the village, ending at the bank of the vast lake that lays between the village and Tinderbrick. Gregory, now more open to the idea of defending the village, also informs him that he has had some of the men gather what alchemical material they have in a small warehouse. Bogrol grins at the idea of firebombing the undead.\n\n**Should I stay or should I go?**\n\nThe half-orcs return to Elm, and are dismayed at the sight of the village being prepared for a fight as opposed to an evacuation. Another argument arises between Gorath and Bogrol wherein they insult each other for being a coward and an idiot respectively. Garon, on the other hand, introduces their new ally Broom to Gregory, who welcomes the aid. Broom advises them that the undead are resistant to certain attacks and advises them to procure bombs and other AoE weapons that will both damage and hinder the creatures. Gregory informs him they have a small warehouse full of alchemical components ready for use, which Broom tells him he can use to create some Alchemist’s Fire.\n\nGorath and Bogrol storm off in opposite directions, intent on two very different things: while Bogrol continues to erect defenses around the village, Gorath finds Gregory and tells him the undead are too many and too strong to fight, and to order an evacuation. Gregory refuses, but acknowledges that he is probably right, and so agrees to back Gorath up once Kingsley returns. He also instructs Gorath to gather the villagers in the square by the lake, so that Kingsley can address them when he returns.\n\nWith nothing else to do, Garon decides to help Bogrol with the defenses. The work is coming along nicely when suddenly the nearby warehouse explodes in a torrent of roaring flame, deafening those nearby. He sees Gregory and Broom – who were standing just outside the warehouse doors discussing their plans – being blasted away and land among the burning debris, lifeless. Garon storms over, and finds them both badly injured. He uses his only remaining *Cure Light Wounds* spell to heal Broom back into consciousness. The wizard, after regaining his senses and some of his hearing, tells Garon to run and find a proper healer while he stays with the old man.\n\nAs Garon runs off for help, Bogrol and Gorath approaches along with a bunch of horrified villagers. They come upon Gregory drawing his final, painful breaths as Broom desperately casts a spell on him. It is too late, however, and Gregory slumps over in Broom’s lap. *“I tried to… I tried,”* the wizard says sadly. Garon returns soon after with a herbalist in tow, but too late.\n\nGregory’s death, along with the destruction of the warehouse – and with it, the village’s best weapons against the undead horde – sparks a fierce debate among the villagers about whether to stay and fight or proceed with an evacuation. As the sun is setting, tensions rise, a few of the men even come to blows, when Kingsley returns from Tinderbrick – alone. His brother Eddie, the city’s mayor, refuses to help, refuses even to acknowledge the scope of the threat, and the village is on its own for now. As the crowd reaches a boiling point, he raises his voice and shouts for silence, which he gets. He then informs them of the choices before them, telling them to each make their own choice, before letting Gorath and Bogrol make their case.\n\nGorath keeps it short and simple, telling them that any who stay will die horrible deaths, possibly even being forced to fight and kill their brethren in death. *”Anyone who stays is going to die. We need to move for Tinderbrick, right now, if we’re going to outrun the horde.”*\n\nBogrol, on the other hand, launches into a five minute tirade about the need to fight – for their homes, their families and their belongings, but most importantly, for honor. He speaks highly of their preparations, and assure them that he will destroy the monsters that are coming for them, telling them how he easily bested them at the outlying village (to Gorath and Garon’s great annoyance). He then finishes his speech with the following: *”It’s true that there are a lot of them, and many of you are going to die. Your husbands, wives and children, your friends… but we can win! We have to fight!”*\n\nKingsley then asks the villagers to make their choice, telling those who wish to evacuate to gather their belongings and wait just outside of the village. Two thirds of the village decide to leave for Tinderbrick. The rest, either too stubborn or too attached to their homes (or, god help them, convinced by Bogrol), decide to stay and fight. Bogrol, exasperated, calls the evacuees cowards and “a bunch of pussies”, but nevertheless joins Kingsley and the other party members at the head of the column. Gorath chooses to stay his tongue to avoid pissing off Bogrol and his player any further.\n\nIt’s a slow march, and after two hours of walking they are barely ¼ of the way around the lake. It is then, while discussing their slow progress with Kingsley, that the party hear the first screams coming from the village, tearing through the darkness. They quickly grow in volume and frequency, bounding across the water, and soon several fires bloom from buildings in Elm, lighting up the gruesome scene that unfolds. While the villagers break out in a panic, crying and cursing as they listen to their friends being slaughtered, the party tells Kingsley to get them moving faster while they guard the rear of the column.\n\nA long and distressing march follows through the night and the early morning. Few words are exchanged, as the screams of their dying friends haunt the villagers. The party, however, is relieved to see – as the sun rises in the east – that there is no undead horde giving chase. Soon, the walls of Tinderbrick become visible through the morning fog, and despite the tragedy that still weighs heavily upon them, the evacuees allow themselves a moment of joy as they approach the city and the safety of its walls.\n",

        "text": "I'm in a campaign set in a homebrew universe (the GM hates dwarves and boats, and somehow this meant that there was nothing to be done but roll his own universe...   with a naval blockade and a long boat voyage being our intro, oddly enough).\n\nI play Gar Morr, half-orc fighter, master of morningstar diplomacy, scourge of the rat cultists.  I'm accompanied by Rix, half-elf barbarian, she-who-checks-traps-with-her-face, paranoid about ninjas and planning on seducing a dragon just to thumb her nose at Ara, the dragonkin elven sorcerer.  Who has the amazing ability to consistently fail Arcana challenges.  We were recently joined by Makaria, a nice goat lady who may accidentally convert Gar into a paladin if she keeps demonstrating the goodness of the recently dead God of Life... \n\nOur tale begins in a dungeon set into a mountaintop.  A defiled statue to an unknown god attracted us here from the Temple of Life on the next mountain over thanks to its golden gleam - unfortunately, it's just gilt.  The lair entrance wasn't concealed or gated at all, which confused me.  Until I remembered that we were multiple days of travel into the mountains.  \n\nThe intrepid adventurers have nearly died to a Boomer on the first floor, nearly died to a Zombie Dragon in a cage on the second, nearly killed ourselves trying to convert the entire room the Vampire lord of the dungeon was in into fire, and earned the enmity of the also-recently-dead God of Death when we scrubbed the necromancer's altar clean with holy water and scribbled smiley faces and happy symbols in the chapel.\n\nNothing went wrong when we doused the eternal flame in a brazier mounted over a bottomless well...  I think.\n\nSo we're in the loot-and-laugh phase of the adventure.  We've secured the dungeon, and all of our characters are being very specific and careful to occasionally check behind us and keep watch.  Everything is going well, until Ara pulls out a golden skull, with rubies for eyes.  And goes completely still. \n\nRix goes over to investigate, and pops a nat 20 on her Arcana check, and fails hard on her wisdom check.  \"That's evil, throw it away.\"\n\nYeah.  The dragonkin throw a shiny away.  \n\nSo they're fighting over it, and I'm starting to get nervous.  The goat girl is just trying to ignore them and hope they'll stop being scary, and I get a good enough look at the skull to realize that it's evil - and it's going to corrupt them both.  In fact, it probably is what corrupted the leader of the dungeon in the first place.  (I think I rolled a 2 or a 3 on my Arcana check for that one).\n\nSo Gar grabs the skull and goes hustling back through the dungeon with it, the other two in hot pursuit, Makaria following behind wringing her hands.  I get to the bottomless well and spike the skull into it.\n\nThis was one of those \"Are you really sure you want to do that?\" moments.  I was sure, of course.\n\nSo the skull goes down the hole, and everybody stops.  BONG.  \n\nBONG..  \n\nBONG!\n\nIt keeps getting louder.  Every time the skull bounces off the side of the hole it makes a horrible BONG noise, and it isn't stopping.  Ara freaks out and attacks me, but she's just a weedy caster so I grab her and toss her over my shoulder.  It's loud enough that it's starting to hurt our ears, so we toss all the easily portable loot into our bags and run.  By the time we make it to the dragon pen, the dragon is hiding its head under its forelegs.  \n\nWe make it out of the dungeon and just run.  Even out here, the BONG is getting louder and louder.  We by some miracle make it off the mountain.  The goat gets thrown in the cart and Rix just picks the donkey up, still harnessed, and we keep running.  \n\nWe make it far enough away that when we collapse from exhaustion, we have a front row seat to the mountain collapsing and dissolving.  The cloud of dust is tremendous, and the sky begins to darken over it.  The BONG stops, and I can barely make out massive tentacles reaching out of the dust cloud.  They're made of moving shadow, blackness beyond black.  I bite my lip hard enough that I bleed, and Marakia is shaking in terror.  \n\nThe Temple of Life erupts in a colossal golden blaze, and a beam of pure energy pierces the cloud.  The tendrils stiffen, then withdraw.  The Temple goes quiet, and slowly the dust cloud clears.  Nothing remains but a crater.  \n\nDuring the run back, Ara managed to claw \"THIEF\" in Draconic into my chest.  I'm keeping it, even if it is upside down. ",

        "text": "Oh what a shame! What a cry of sadness the world must shout, for last night the illustrious Zdelav One-Eye was slain in a duel by the nemesis who barely remembered him, Tess Myrgold.\n\nOur game revolves around three characters, each having a few hours of solo story played before joining as a party. Dragyr, the Maelite brigand-turned-bounty hunter, with a guardian Hyena and skill with both bow and sword; Anara, the Athairi dancer and folk-witch, libertine in ethics and powerful in her wisdom; and finally Zdelav, a Highland Bard with many ties to the underground of the capital. Zdelav is who we focus on, as he made some grave errors time and time again.\n\nIn mighty Therapoli, capital of the Lowlands, his story began with the bard deciding on which Guild Prince to choose as his patron. He decided on Red Benny, the owner of several courier services and a former serial killer. Wanting to strengthen their relationship, he asked for a riskier job than usual from Benny, who asked him to take a message to the Guard Captain, and to not be seen doing it. Zdelav agreed and took the message directly to the house in broad daylight, handed it to the Captain's aged mother, and left, with no disguise but his cloak and hood drawn about him. That night, the guard captain burst into the bard's home and demanded his daughter back, revealing the delivered message to have been a ransom note. Zdelav despaired and willingly guided the captain back to Red Benny's hideout, only to find it empty save a note: \"We're not friends anymore. -Benny\"\n\nZdelav was left behind as the captain continued his search, and feared for his life and so fled the city with due haste. Two gangs of ruffians attacked him as well as a crossbow-wielding assassin, but Zdelav's luck looked up and he escaped the city with his life savings in tact. He bought a palfrey pony and began riding home to his highlands, but on the road was met with a picket line manned by a group of deserters from the Lord Marshal's forces. They demanded two gold crowns for passage and were led by a handsome rogue named Tess.\n\nThe Bard removed the gold and offered it to them with no argument,  but Tess eyed his bag of coin and demanded his life savings of all twenty crowns. Zdelav refused, throwing the gold at him and wheeling his pony around trying to rush past the line, but was pulled off, beaten, and knocked unconscious. He awoke with nothing to his name but his breeches and had to work his way back up with nothing but his musical skills.\n\nClose to four months later he found himself in friendship with our other two adventures and in service of one Ser Apelias, with whom they had agreed to help find an old friend to fulfill a long-forgotten oath. While on the road to the Castle Burnwall, they stayed at the infamous Woat's Inn and while Zdelav retired to the hot baths, Dragyr went to sleep in his own private room and Anara tried her luck at cards. After a short winning streak she found herself losing to a handsome young bravo named Tess Myrgold. The two bantered and when she expressed interest her responded and the two returned to her split room to enjoy each other.\n\nZdelav returned to the room he was splitting with Anara and found her there copulating with the bandit he had sworn vengeance on. He demanded a duel right then and there, and after signing two stable boys as witnesses, Zdelav attacked. With a single parry-and-riposte, Tess pierced him through his remaining eye, killing the bard. For fear of him, Anara finished the night with Tess and was relieved to find him gone the next morning. Now the two adventurers have met and shall continue their venture with the young noble Corbin Tain of Blackstone, but not before they had the chance to bury their dear friend and pray for him on the path of the dead.\n\nZdelav One-Eye, may you rest in piece you foolish, foolish bard you.",

        "author": "Bingoose",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/54q8ea/5e_very_long_lmop_a_group_of_newbies_battle/",
        "text": "This tale is a continuation of my previous one [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/53grvn/5e_long_a_group_of_newbies_struggle_through_lmop/) and contains spoilers for The Lost Mine of Phandelver. For my players, this is once again spoiler-free.\n\nIn the week following the failed assault on Wave Echo Cave, Johagan recruited, trained and equipped a new party. This time they would be stronger and more prepared, also Gundren and Sildar had agreed to assist this time. The party now consisted of:\n\n* **Johagan**, the only returning party member. Now levelled up to fighter 5 (champion) and equipped with a magical longbow called Drow Death (created for and named by Johagan). Drow Death is made of hardened steel, with sharp spikes on the outside and handles flanking the bow string. It is a magical +1 weapon that can be used normally or wielded as a two-handed melee weapon with a 1d10 damage die. Any enemy it hits also loses its reaction until the start of Johagan's next turn.\n\n* **Gundren** had joined the party as a level 5 barbarian (totem warrior - wolf), played by Thoradin's player. Gundren had returned to secure the mine and find his missing family members. He also had a magic item: Boots of the Spider. These boots gave Gundren a permanent spider-climb effect.\n\n* **Sildar** was a DM-controlled character, and so naturally I took a back seat most of the time. He was a Fighter 5 (Battle Master) with a magical Ring of Luck; a ring engraved with the face of Tymora that gave the effect of the Luck feat.\n\n* **Orianna**, a tiefling ranger 5 (beast master) with a pet wolf, was the fiance of Roscoe and was played by his player. The couple had a pair of magical engagement rings that allowed them to communicate telepathically within 1 mile of eachother.\n\n* **Dave Jr.** was the 19-year-old son of Dave; the bartender of the Sleeping Giant that was brutally murdered by the Redbrands. Played by Eugene's player, he was a level 5 paladin of Tymora with an oath of vengeance for his father. He had a magical shield called Tymora's Guard that acted as a divine focus and, when its name was spoken, would illuminate in a dim magical light for 10ft.\n\n* Finally there was **Chalgar**, a level 5 life cleric of Tymora sent by Sister Garaele to assist the party. He was played by Euronymus' new player (the first was replaced half way through). He had a magic ring that gave him temporary hit points whenever he cast a spell, equal to the spell's level. Honestly though, everyone forgot it existed and I don't think it was used once.\n\nThis tale begins a week after the last one. The party has had a week to prepare, but so has Nezznar (assisted by me of course) so the party are expecting a hard time. I am pleased to say I delivered.\n\nThe party, lead by Johagan, took the same route back to the cave they had taken previously. The journey was uneventful until they approached the cave and saw 5 bugbears sitting outside around a camp fire. The party peppered the bugbears with hits until they got near, then the tanks protected the weaker members until the bugbears began to drop. The combat was ultimately resolved with little difficulty and the party entered the cave in high spirits.\n\nInside they saw Tharden's corpse still covered in a blanket, apparently as they left it. The rope into the cave below was missing however, though the stalagmite still appeared to be in tact. The party tied a length of rope around the new stalagmite but before they could descend, Gundren was attacked by his brother Tharden, now a ghoul. Unable to kill his own brother, Gundren grappled Tharden and attempted to restrain him until Johagan took him out with a well-aimed headshot. It was a harrowing moment for Gundren but for the sake of Nundro and Thoradin he forced himself to continue.\n\nOrianna was first down the rope, with Gundren casually strolling down the vertical rock face next to her carrying her wolf. Unfortunately Orianna lost her grip on the rope and fell. Near the bottom Orianna felt her foot snag on a thin wire and a loud alarm filled the cave before finishing abruptly. Any element of surprise the party may have had was lost. The rest of the party descended the rope one by one, most of them making it down without incident.\n\nThe party then found themselves in a maze. Johagan had been here previously and walked north until he got through, but this time he wanted to explore the maze a little. The party went north-east until they saw some stairs leading into a large cavern containing seven ghouls. Good positioning and use of turn undead made this a surprisingly trivial encounter; the party were working very well together and once again morale was high.\n\nLeaving to the north-east took the party into a smelter cavern full of corpses, with a weird floating skull amongst them. The skull was burning with a green flame and attacked the party along with seven zombies that stood up as the players entered. Once again the combat went well; the party efficiently dealing with everything inside. A low initiative roll from the flameskull may also have helped them out. After clearing the room, the party investigated it to try to figure out its purpose. During their search they heard a voice and turned to see a human standing in a nearby doorway.\n\nHis face was heavily scarred, as were his bare hands. He was unarmed and unarmoured and was holding an old looking wooden box. Johagan immediately recognised this man as Eugene; the fighter they had lost a week ago. Eugene then spoke: \"Johagan you've returned, just as Nezznar said you would. I can't say I'm surprised to see you go back on your word, not after you left me for dead.\" Johagan tried to explain that he had no choice but Eugene interrupted him, saying that he had a message to pass on from Nezznar. First he wanted to apologise for the behaviour of the bugbears last time; they were never meant to ambush the players and have since been dismissed. Since Nezznar predicted the party would return he has offered them a gift, though if they take it they must promise to leave and never return.\n\nAt this point, Dave used insight to see if Eugene was telling the truth. *I make all rolls to glean information (insight, perception, arcana, etc) in secret so the players don't know the rolls, fortunately my players seem to enjoy the tension and realism it adds.* Dave rolled well and learned that while Eugene wasn't lying in what he said, he did appear to be hiding something. Being suspicious now, Dave instructed Eugene to open the box. Eugene obliged and the box cast a level 4 fireball on itself, hitting Eugene and the entire party. Everyone rolled initiative to see who reacted first and Dave won. He attacked Eugene and brought him to 0 hit points in one round. As Eugene died he screamed out \"Why?!\", which the party assumed was aimed at Dave. Instead Eugene was screaming at Nezznar, since he was not told the contents of the box. The party left Eugene for dead for the second time and this time he actually died, slain by his old player.\n\nWhile the party had been working its way through the cave, Orianna had been talking to Roscoe. *This was done via text messaging so noone else knew what was said unless Orianna told them.* Roscoe said that he had been held captive all week in a room on his own, he didn't know where. During that time he had not seen the others. He had, however, seen Nezzar stash the key to his door behind the left eye of the dwarven statue, in the room they originally met Nezznar.  Once Orianna relayed this information to the party, Johagan became suspicious of Roscoe. The two had never seen eye to eye and Johagan suspected a trap. After hearing about Eugene, Roscoe started to ask questions about the numbers and condition of the party. This made Orianna suspicious and she began to feed him false information, telling him there were only 2 survivors of the blast and that they were in bad shape.\n\nAfter surviving the fireball and healing most of the damage, the party proceeded east where they saw five hobgoblins. One was clearly larger than the others and was carrying an ornate longsword Johagan immediately recognised as Talon. This had been Thoradin's longsword before he was captured. After killing them and taking back Talon, the party noticed a pair of heavy iron doors in front of them. The doors were scorched and cracked, their hinges partially melted. The damage did not look recent though. To the north of this was a small side building with a single iron door, similarly damaged. The party forced open one of the two doors into the larger room and saw before them a large workshop, badly damaged by fire. There was a stone brazier with an eerie green flame in the centre of the room that strangely looked undamaged. This room was the fabled Forge Of Spells. At one of the worktables stood Tharden, seemingly alive and healthy. He was wearning a set of ornate armor with a gold dragon motif and some fancy looking gauntlets that didn't match the set. Next to him was a mace, glowing with a dim magic. Also in the room was a spectator. The spectator greeted them and asked their purpose, before changing its mind and telling the party to leave. Gundren appealed to his brother but Tharden simply turned to them, pointed and yelled \"intruders!\".\n\nThe party decided to leave and try the smaller building next door. The managed to force it open and saw a desk inside with papers scattered over it and a chair in front. Johagan recognised this as Nezznar's desk, though there was no sign of the drow himself. They quickly looked through the papers and one in particular caught their eye; a letter from Iarno (Glasstaff, leader of the Redbrands) saying that he was on his way and would arrive in a week. The letter had no date on it but looked recent. As they were examining the desk, the party heard a whispered incantation next to them and saw a cloud of mist.\n\nIn a state of mild panic, the party ran out of the office. Back in the cavern, they decided to take a passage to the north that they had not yet explored. *At this point multiple players were giving me suspicious looks, clearly expecting someting bad. I am pleased to say I delivered.* As the party made their way down a set of stairs carved into the stone, they felt a sudden intense heat from behind them as Nezznar unleashed a fireball. Thinking quickly, Dave misty stepped to the source of the spell and arrived right next to... another cloud of mist. The party quickly decided they didn't want this fight and continued down the north passage as quickly as possible. *I found that decision most helpful, since Nezznar was out of 2nd level spell slots (no more invisibility or misty step if I wanted another fireball).*\n\nThe party continued through a cavern and down a narrow passage that opened up into a cavern with a large rift right in front of them. There were ropes leading into the rift on the far side but no easy way down from their position. From inside the cave they could hear an elven voice muttering to itself. The muttering was unintelligeable, rarely forming words and never sentences. Johagan insantly recognised this voice as Euronymus, though he sounded like he'd lost his grasp on reality. Gundren used his boots to walk across the ceiling to the other side and grabbed the rope. He then brought it back across and the others held it tightly over the rift. One by one, the party made their way across the rope. Dave, Orianna and Sildar lost their grip as they crossed, failling painfully into the rift. As each fell, Euronymus looked at them with a blank expression on his face before continuing his muttering.\n\nTheir resources stretched thin, the party decided to leave Euronymus for now and continue towards Roscoe. After climbing to the top of the rift on the west side, the party continued down a passage they had not previously taken. It lead to the room where they had initially faced Nezznar, though just before was a door on their right. It was locked but looking through the key hole they could see Roscoe. He was gagged and bound in heavy metal chains. A large lock was visibly holding the chains together. Orianna remembered the key so the party went into Nezznar's old room to retrieve it. There they fought the giant spiders that had halted Johagan's previous party. This time, however, the battle was easier and the spiders were quickly despatched. Now looking around the room, the party could see that all of Nezznar's belongings had been removed. They could also see the dwarven statue, and below it two dwarves. The dwarves were stripped of any weapons or armour and were restrained in a similar manner to roscoe. Gundren immediately recognised them as Nundro and Thoradin.\n\nGundren rushed over to his relatives to speak to them but they were unresponsive, seemingly unconscious. Gundren poured his potion of healing down his brother's throat and Nundro's eyes slowly opened. However, when Gundren spoke to him he remained unresponsive. Johagan decided to get a reaction out of him by stabbing him in the leg with an arrow. As the arrow pierced his flesh, Nundro's eyes widened and then closed, with no further reaction given. Johagan frantically tried to explain himself to a furious Gundren as Orianna began climbing for the statue's left eye. Struggling at first, Orianna managed to loosen and then remove the eye. There was no key visible behind it, though now Orianna could feel the room beginning to shake.\n\nAll of a sudden, the six columns holding up the room shattered and the ceiling fell through. Everyone was crushed by the falling ceiling, though some were able to protect their weak spots and resist some of the impact. Once the shaking had stopped, the party climbed through the rubble to survey the scene. The room was completely covered and the dwarves were completely buried. Gundren rushed over to them and saw they had taken some nasty damage from the cave in, neither had a pulse. At the same time, Orianna went to find her wolf. Unfortunately he had not made it either and his corpse was a bloody, broken mess. In grief and anger, Orianna mentally screamed into her ring \"There was no key and it was a trap, did you lie to me?!\"\n\nThe voice that replied to her was not the familiar voice of Roscoe. Instead she heard a voice she recognised from the office with the iron door. It spoke in a calm and menacing voice \"Did you like my little trap? Why do you fools persist?\" *The look of shock and betrayal over the face of Oranna's player was a sight to behold, and he didn't speak for a good few seconds after he read Nezznar's message.* When Orianna had recovered from the initial shock, she replied with the same angry tone \"What? Where is Roscoe? What have you done?\". The reply came \"Roscoe? Why, he's in the room right next to you.\". Orianna spoke briefly to Nezznar before relaying the information to the party. They decided the ring could not be trusted and may have been allowing Nezznar to track them. Not wanting to take the risk, they convinced Orianna to bury the ring in the rubble and promised they would come back for it once the nefarious drow had been slain. *It's a shame they left the ring, I was enjoying taunting Orianna. It's purpose had been served though, the dwarves were dead. Three characters they had come to save were now dead and all three had been murdered by the party.*\n\nThe party, now convinced they were being followed by Nezznar, hatched a plan. They would loudly declare they were giving up and leaving and that Nezznar was too powerful for them. They would then head towards the exit and leave some items at the foot of the rope to give the appearance of leaving in a hurry. At that point the party would sneak through the cave and attempt to take Nezznar by surpise, ideally outside of his office. With this in mind the party headed south. They first arrived at the scene of their final battle, where Johagan had abandoned the rest of his party to save his own life. This area had been cleaned of any signs of the previous battle and was empty. Nervously, the party proceeded south into the maze. While there they were walking through, two gricks dropped on the party and began to attack. The combat was not too difficult, though at this point any sustained damage was dangerous and potentially lethal.\n\nAfter killing the gricks, Johagan continued to the exit with Dave whilst the rest of the party hid nearby in the maze. Johagan placed ten arrows and one of his boots at the bottom and began to yell climbing instructions at himself. After hearing no response, the two hid near the rest of the party and were attacked by an ochre jelly. Combat was tense and the constantly splitting ooze made them feel uneasy. The ooze didn't land any heavy hits though and the party destroyed it with little trouble. At this point Sildar, who had never been really on board with the plan, made a rather firm suggestion that they find a place to rest before proceeding. *This was a slight (and apparently obvious) bit of DM intervention but at this point a fireball would have been an instant TPK, regardless of saves, so the party absolutely needed to rest and spend their hit dice.* The party made their way back to an old storeroom they had found previously and had an uncomfortable and uneasy rest. They were not disturbed as they rested and did not hear any sounds from nearby, so they left an hour later feeling much stronger and with a very clear mission in mind; kill Nezznar.\n\nGundren convinced Johagan to grab his arrows and boot before continuing and the party then made their way towards Nezznar's office. On the way, the party noticed a dim green glow ahead of them. Moving closer they could see the flameskull from earlier had returned to unlife and was now staring at them intensely. Well, as much as you can with no eyes. The flameskull shot two beams of fire at the nearest party members, before Gundren charged it. The maul missed its first swing but the second one hit true, nearly destroying the flameskull in one hit. The rest of the party bunched up and peppered it with shots and spells (mostly unsuccessfully due to its shield spell) before it launched a fireball at Sildar.\n\nEveryone except for Gundren was caught in the blast and suffered heavy damage. At this point they were getting pretty used to it though. Orianna's high dexterity and natural fire resistance had left her largely unscathed by all three fireballs, as her player gladly noted. Charred, bloody and angry; the party hacked away at the flameskull until it fell again, before stomping it literally into a pile of dust. Having no remaining healing, the party were forced to continue towards Nezznar to end this one way or another. After Orianna failed to open the door, Dave stepped forward and gave it a heavy shove. As soon as the door opened, Nezznar hit Dave with his readied charm spell. Dave failed his save and closed the door, informing the party that the office was empty. He knocked twice on the door as he left, which Orianna noticed but ignored for now. *The players at this point were laughing; some genuinely and some from sheer frustration. Dave's player in particular found the charm hilarious.*\n\nSince the office was empty, the party searched the surrounding cavern and noticed a building they had not seen before. The doors here were made from a heavy wood and the party had trouble forcing them open. Eventually Gundren managed it and they saw a room that was heavily damaged by fire, similar to the previous ones. The furniture indicated this was a bedroom, a chest was visible at the foot of one of the beds. As the party are looking around, a wraith began to rise up through the floor. The wraith threatened the party and told them to leave, which they decided was probably a good course of action.\n\nThe party returned to the Nezznar's office to \"trash it and piss him off\" (aka metagame) but at this point I decided to allow it. They'd been through a lot and there seemed little point in arbitrarily delaying the showdown they came for. Dave, Sildar and Gundren entered the office first. Nezznar somehow rolled 17 stealth; exactly enough to beat everyone's passive perception except for his new ally Dave. *Seriously that was the roll, I don't ever fudge 'em. I couldn't hold back a grin at that roll, which naturally put everyone on edge.* Sildar and Gundren went to trash Nezznar's desk while Dave pretended to stomp on something in a corner of the room. Nezznar was clinging to the corner above Dave (which was obviously the point) as he unleashed a burning hands spell on the other two in the room. At that moment all hell broke loose.\n\nThe first round of combat saw Sildar jump over Dave's attempt to block him (rolled 16 and 17 to hit with disadvantage) and hit both attacks for big damage, even through Nezznar's shield spell. *That first attack dropped Nezznar from 35hp to 13, from an NPC attack, so I had to think quickly to extend the fight.* Gundren didn't roll as well and Nezznar's arcane shield kept him from harm. The second round of combat saw the rest of the party charge in as well as Tharden, as the room was plunged into magical darkness. Most of the room was dimly illuminated by Tymora's Guard, though Nezznar's position was kept deliberately dark. Dave healed Nezznar as the rest of the party split their attacks between Nezznar and Tharden, though no hits were landed on Nezznar.\n\nIn the third round, Nezznar ran out of the room and shouted in undercommon \"run ally!\", holding the rest of his action to cast a fireball later. Unfortunately none of the party could speak undercommon, so they just heard Nezznar's voice shout something from somewhere. Tharden disengaged and ran back through the door into the Forge Of Spells. Johagan then charged at where he had last seen Nezznar and amazingly managed to roll a critical hit with disadvantage (19 &amp; 20 iirc, he is a Champion) and... hit brickwork. *Johagan's player looked at me with disbelief when I told him he'd missed. He was about to correct me when he realised what had happened.* Johagan then charged out of the room and ran right into Nezznar, using his second attack to knock him unconscious.\n\nThe darkness dissipated and Dave recovered from the charm, but Johagan wasn't done. He used his action surge to make two more attacks at the downed Nezznar; leaving two deep wounds in his back *and giving him two failed death saves.* Dave immediately apologised for his actions, having no idea why he'd been helping Nezznar all this time. Gundren had the final initiative this round and, before anyone could react, followed Tharden into the Forge of Spells. At the same time, Orianna went over to Nezznar's body to search it. She found three noteworthy items; a ring of protection previously belonging to Thoradin, an iron key and Roscoe's engagement ring. *I got another angry look from her player.*\n\nBarging through the door, Gundren saw his brother waiting along with the spectator. Unable to physically harm his brother, he instead went to grapple him. The attempt was unsuccessful and the two brothers stared eachother down under the watchful eyes of the spectator. The others charged one by one into the Forge and managed to send the spectator back to its home plane, defeated in combat. Tharden was successfully restrained and beaten with non-lethal attacks until he feel unconscious. The fight was over, the forge was won. Nezznar at this point had made two more death saves; a success followed by a failure, causing him to finally die. That wasn't enough to stop Gundren dragging his corpse into the Forge Of Spells and caving his face in with two heavy blows from the maul. Nezznar was now very, very dead.\n\nInvestigating the Forge, the party learned of its waning but still present magical powers and spent a while resting and enchanting most of their non-magical gear. Orianna then reminded them of Roscoe, who had been left restrained in that small room. Carrying the unconscious Tharden, the party made their way back to where Roscoe was being held. Orianna revived him with a cure wounds (she had lied up until now, saying she had no healing left) and quizzed him briefly before releasing him and giving him a rapier she had spare. Roscoe immediately, without talking ran up to Tharden and plunged his rapier into Tharden's chest. Tharden's form contorted as he died and shifted into what Johagan and Roscoe recognised as a doppelganger. Gundren had now witnessed his relatives dying 4 times today and looked truly broken, though he fought through it to thank Roscoe.\n\nEuronymus was last on the list to be rescued. Dave went down into the rift along with Gundren while the others kept guard up top. At the bottom of the rift, Dave noticed a nothic that began to beg him not to leave with his elf friend. Dave began to leave with Euronymus anyway until the nothic hit him with a rotting gaze. One dead nothic later, the party are leaving with an unconscious Euronymus over Dave's shoulder. Gundren convinced them to grab the corpses of his relatives on the way out so that they may have a fitting end and so the party made it out of Wave Echo Cave carrying between them an unconscious elven wizard, two dead dwarves and a slain ghoul. On the way back Euronymus came to, panicked and tried to cast a spell. Instead he created illusionary butterflies around the party before being knocked unconscious again by the hilt of Talon.\n\nThey made it back to Phandalin and went straight to their usual crutch, Sister Garaele. She agreed to keep Euronymus over night in an attempt to revive him and the rest of the party returned to stay with relatives, Johagan being put up for the night by Dave's family. The next day was the funeral of the three slain dwarves, who were cremated on an open pyre in the centre of Phandalin with the entire town in attendance.\n\nAfter the funeral, the party said goodbye to Gundren, Sildar and Chalgar and made their way towards Thundertree to deal with the dragon there. The conclusion of that will be next Sunday and I'll post it if it's a worthwhile story. For now this concludes the epic return of Johagan to Wave Echo Cave and the final defeat of Nezznar at his hands. This has ended up being a lot longer than planned but it really was an insane session and a half. Thanks for reading.",

        "text": "There is this one game in my collection that has bothered me for years. It's a game that has simultaneously managed to anger me as a kid, baffle me as a teen, and infuriate me as an adult. It's a game I could never beat when I was younger, though I could never remember why. So recently I decided to dust it off and try it again, and it is far worse than I remembered. The game is Warriors of Might and Magic for the Playstation 2. I believe it's a relatively early game for the system, so it was one of the first ones I got when I received a PS2 as a really early teen. This game is difficult for all the wrong reasons and my younger self got frustrated very quickly. Eventually I got stuck on one of the last levels and put it down for several years. A few years later I tried again, got stuck in the same place, and then quit once more. This time however I was determined to beat it. This game has been haunting me of sorts as as child and I always got stuck on that one level. A few weeks ago I decided to try again, and this is how it went.\n\n\nThe first level went exactly as I remembered it. The story starts with your character being forced to put on a mask and is then thrown into a pit for, some reason. I think it has something to do with being banished for necromancy, but I never paid that much attention, the story never really held my interest. So the first level is a giant pit, which immediately turns into a sewer level. Well I guess they figured they'd get this out of the way first. Regardless, the first level is pretty easy, if a bit boring. The second are of this level is a spider cave with very annoying spider babies that squeal at you in a very annoying manner. I managed to glitch through the floor once, yay! After that is your typical orc cavern.\n\n\nAfter that is the Village of Draklor. And just, uuuuugggghhhhhggggggg... This level I was stuck on for days as a kid. It's starts with you character meeting a raven in a rock, then it tells the raven that all he needs to get him out is a Rock Dissolve Potion (of course, that's exactly what I was thinking too.) After that, you get thrown into a huge level. And when I say huge I mean it is so big, so ginormous, and there are no landmarks to differ anything from one another. I had to look up a video guide for this one because everything just blended together in a mess of orcs, bridges and draw distance fog that you always feel lost at all times.\n\n\nAfter that nightmare you free the raven and he takes you to this guy who says he can get your mask off. It's cursed or something. By the way, you spend about half the game running errands for this guy so get used to seeing him. So next are the The Enroth Quests. Basically, you need to run around this labyrinth and collect these two gems and then head up to the top floor, I think. So in this level we have lightning towers that cannot be destroyed and take a ton of like every time you run past them (which is mandatory), very quick monsters that will hit you without fail every time you try to fight them, and jumping puzzles. And let me tell you, if there's one game that does not need jumping puzzles, it's this one. The game itself runs at like 12 frames per second, and his jumping is so stiff. I often find myself save scumming before every jump segment because I just don't trust this game to register but jump inputs. And finally, probably the worst offense of all, in one of the rooms where you get one of these gems, you're ambushed by a giant gargoyle. His health bar is glitched and doesn't show up, so you may assume that you cannot kill him and run away. However you can in fact kill him, and he hold one of the most mandatory spells in the game, the heal spell.\n\n\nThe next two levels are actually somewhat the same area. They require you to get to this weird underground cave and then find your way out once you get an item. The only thing of note in this chapter is the level titles Into The Maze. Now you know in some games where they have a lot of unused assets by the end of the game's development, they'll sometimes throw them all into one segment and create a big non-sequitur level? Harvester had the Lodge, Mystik Belle had the World of Absolute Assets, and this game has this annoying maze. The entire place has this eyesore of a checkered floor, and several variations of the same enemies, all who are just of diffrent elements. I guess they were running out of budget for new models at this point. Regardless, you find a coyote who leads you to a room where people are stuck in the walls, then you free them, then they just... stay there? Okay... Then you find some monsters and leave!\n\n\nAfter that is literally the saddest excuse for a dragon boss I have ever seen. His name is Talinthraxus (kind of a dumb name if you ask me) and here's his patter. He wait for you to hit him, then he flies to the top of the room, then he fires single shots at you that you can easily jump over, and then he comes back down. That's pretty much it. This fight counts as an entire level by the way.\n\n\nAfter that you just somehow appear in the Overrun Monastery. This place comes out of nowhere, and now out of nowhere the people of the town want my help to save them and kill the undead. Say, wasn't I evicted or something for necromancy earlier? I guess they forgot about that. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised, they're AI is so dumb that they will just stand in the middle of the town and wait for zombies to come up and kill them. They'll follow you after you save them, if you can save them, and when you lead them back to the start of the level where they're safe they will thank you with exp. And then they will keep following you, even back outside into danger. I got frustrated with these guys and just grabbed a key and ended a level.\n\n\nThe dude help us get the cursed mask off, yay! And now we're on the level I got stuck on as a kid, the Temple of the Deprived. Specifically, the first segment. So I had my A game on, I honed my skills, used most of the buffs I had, and pushed through. I killed every enemy, I got every key, I did everything in my power to perform on the level as well as I could. I even found a cool fire sword too. But then, I got stuck. I couldn't find my way out. I think I found the door leading out, but no key in my possession worked. I ran up and down the level, looking for any sort of clues, but eventually I just got annoyed. This was the exact reason I could never beat it as a kid. I was stuck in the exact same predicament. So eventually I got annoyed and looked it up. Apparently other people got stuck here too. I wasn't the only one. This made me feel less like an idiot, but I still needed answers. But then I found a short article explaining this part of the game, and I could not believe what I read.\n\n\nAlright, so let me explain a little about how this level is set up. Early on you get a key, which is then used to open some locked gates. Then you come across a locked door, and naturally, you try the first key on it. It doesn't work, you obviously need another key. This key is located further in the level. However when you go back, that second key doesn't work either. And here's where everyone got stuck. Apparently, according to this short article I read, this door is bugged. It is glitch in such a way so if you use that first key on the door, it will permanently lock it by complete accident. Then you much restart the entire level all over again. This is beyond a beginner's trap, he game outright tricks you into softlocking you game due to shoddy programming. At that moment I was furious. On top of having to do this entire level over again, I now knew the answer. I wasn't able to beat the game because I was bad or too dumb to figure out the puzzles, I never beat this game as a kid because of inapt programming creating an extremely easy to execute dead man walking glitch. So there, I didn't use that first key on the door this time. I waited until I go the second key and used that, and it worked. This one door that tormented me as a kid finally opened and I was officially in uncharted territory. I've never seen the game past this point. I got ready, and trekked forward.\n\n\nWould you believe me if I said that wasn't even the end of the level? There's more! After that is some sort of underground fire temple, and for some reason the game takes a huge difficulty spike at this point. I wasn't surprised, but I was still annoyed. Before this, most enemies could only run up to you and melee attack, with the occasional knife-thrower. But now each and every enemy knew incredibly powerful magic. The giant demon monsters, the succubus, even the tiny dog monsters that run around you. I didn't want to quit though, I was determined to finally beat this game after all these years.\n\n\nAfter that is the second-to-last level. It was just an underground temple, nothing special at all. I felt it was a bit too big and haphazard to be honest, but I don't think the developers cared anymore. They were just as desperate to finish this as I was. About halfway though the level you meet the evil antagonist lady for the final time. I've neglected to mention her until now because the story as a whole is just so forgettable. Anytime she did show up she just threw rocks or monsters in the main character's face and then bolted. The voice acting during this final confrontation was just awful though. The voice acting in this game was passable at best before this, but it seems like even less effort than usual was put into this performance. The lady sounds like a bratty schoolgirl and the main character sounds like he doesn't want to be there. His actor probably didn't either, and frankly, I was sort of with him. Apparently I need to find some magic spellbook in order seal the evil demon and go home, so I finished the level and moved on.\n\n\nFinal level time, yay! Alright, so this one starts out with you fighting this weird fish monster in an enclosed room. After you defeat him, the game spawns another one, this one of a different element. I guess this game was doing sort of a thing where you fight all of the elements at the end of the game. Cool, I guess. Afterwards a third one spawns. This one doesn't have an element. I took care of him easily enough and then this chute opened and I picked up what else than that sealing spell mentioned last episode. Cool! So now I should be able to fight the final boss. I'll probably throw this tome at him like in The Faces of Evil and then we'll be do-\n\n\n*ending FMV plays*\n\n\nWait, what? That was it? What about the final boss?\n\n\nWell here's the thing. Afterwards I looked at an online guide and was surprised to find that that fish thing, was the final boss. I seriously thought it was just a normal enemy! It in no way looked like something I needed a special book to seal, but whatever, game done.\n\n\nMan, that was not worth it, but I'm glad I finally finished it. This one game confused me so much as a kid and all to just seal off one final level and the most anti-climatic final boss I've ever seen. Everything in this game is just wrong. The story is bad, the controls are clunky, is just doesn't look pretty, and it has some very awful programming. Especially at that last bit with the door, I just can't get over that! I don't like dead man walking tropes when they're intentional, how do you think I feel about this one that had me stuck for years? Regardless, I finally finished it. What an awful game...",

I do this to improve my writing skills as much as to entertain. Thank you and enjoy.\n\nThis is a continuation of '[Mutants and Masterminds] The Bad, The Mad and The Outright Terrifying: A Super-villain story Part 11', which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/519o24/mutants_and_masterminds_the_bad_the_mad_and_the/. Last time, the misfit motley freed several captured superheroes and formed an alliance with them. With River Fox, Stonewall, Doctor Paradox and Scarlet Sentinel at their side, the team moved to seize control of the Zel'tan capital ship. Their attempt to secure the bridge was met with staunch resistance from a surprise force: Pinnacle and his team of 'Super-Heroes'. With the battle evenly matched, Kitsune began to summon the spirits of recently slain heroes to turn the tide. It might have worked had White Dwarf, a female clone of Event Horizon, smeared his brains across a wall. This is where we find ourselves now.\n\nThe battle raged furiously across the ship as titanic beings struggled for victory, powers surging against each other. For Event Horizon, it may as well be in slow motion: The tempestuous grief across River Fox's face as she lashed out with tendrils of water strong enough to carve through steel, the genuine anguish that Pilot was choking back even while diving for cover, Patterdemalion's tiny snarl of defiance to Pinnacle. The speedster watched as droplets of gore fell from his friend's corpse, glimmering beads of pulverised meat suspended in molasses. Even Pinnacle, tangible waves of citrine energy exuding from his form, was nothing more than a statue in the gallery of Event Horizon's life. The only thing that continued to move was the murderer before him, bobbing from side to side in a mirror-image of his own frantic motions.\n\n\"You're going to die for that.\" The words would have been indecipherable to anyone else but she could understand him, he knew that she could. \"He wasn't too bad, you know? Not like Barghast or any of the other psychopaths running around.\" They clashed again and again, weaving between the sluggish combatants like an obstacle course. \"Just another son-of-a-bitch trying to get by in this crap-sack world of ours. But you don't care about that, do you?\" Event Horizon snarled, sliding towards his prey beneath lingering tendrils of ruby flame. There was an almost curious tilt of her head as the swords-woman deflected another flurry of blows. \"You just do what you're told, kill who you're told to kill.\" Event Horizon casually threw Pilot behind cover without looking before twisting to avoid a death-blow. \"For what? A pat on the head, like a good dog?\" Sparks exploded into existence across the battleground as they fought. \"My god, are you even getting paid?\" \n\nA powerful blow shattered through her defences, launching the woman back across the ship. Event Horizon refused to let up the assault, batting the prone killer around with a predatory presence. However she tried to twist with the blows or speed away entirely, there was never a moment of respite. Event Horizon ignored her attempts to deter him, accepting the wounds she delivered to him with a berserker's glee. Her blade split toughened flesh easily enough but never dispensing more than minor cuts to her elusive foe. Forms blurred and her sword shrieked in in protest as the metal blade exploded into glimmering shards that peppered Lionheart's shield. The staff lashed out once, twice, three times; her skulls alternating between chitinous deck and unbreakable pole. A futile resistance managed to fling the weapon free of his grasp and a quick kick brought her precious distance.\n\n\"Following...orders.\" The words were harsh and gravelly, spoken with the voice of one unaccustomed to speech. She glared at him through one swollen eye, her helmet cracked from his assault. Event Horizon spat with enough force to bruise flesh. \n\n\"That didn't fly for the Hague and it sure as hell won't for me.\" Even with the heat of his anger bubbling through his veins, the speedster admitted that it was disconcerting to see his own eyes scowling at him. \"Clone of me or not, you're nothing but a shadow. Everything about you is a cheap copy of the real deal, from your speed to the way you throw a punch.\" He ducked his head to the side gracefully as she lunged, deflecting her blows with ease. \"It took me by surprise before, seeing it all from this side.\" He rammed an elbow into her stomach, driving the air from her lungs in an explosive gasp. \"You have my powers, you have my moves; You might have been an actual threat but your boss glossed over one detail.\" He struck again and again, flowing seamlessly from one attack into the next. \"You've never fought another speedster. I have!\" \n\n\"Alright buddy, going to have to ask you to stop pounding my face in.\" His fist stopped millimetres from her face. The armour casing of her helmet fell away, revealing a bloody smile. \"Thanks for that. I just got this body, after all.\" Event Horizon pulled back, confused. \n\n\"Is...What's happening right now?\" A gurgling laugh was his answer as the clone swayed precariously on her feet. \n\n\"Right. Don't have much time. This body isn't all that welcoming of a seperate spirit. We can't beat Pinnacle, so we have to make this hurt him before we go.\" She continued talking, seemingly unaware of Event Horizon's growing disbelief. \"Get the team together and retreat back to the cloning chamber. Destroy whatever you can on the way out but don't stop moving.\" Now that they had stopped moving, the world returned to normal. Utter chaos erupted around them, a cacophony of danger the soundtrack of their struggle, but Event Horizon ignored it all. \n\n\"Minato?\" It was a hushed, almost awed whisper that emerged from the speedster. The clone winked as cheekily as possible with her eyes swollen shut, one broken arm tipping an imaginary hat. \"How the fuck? You...She...What?\" With the typically loud-mouthed criminal stunned into silence, Minato decided to enunciate. \n\n\"Yeah, it's me. Don't ask how I'm doing this because I have no idea. When I died, my spirit was just floating around until I tried to tether myself to your better half.\" The possessed speedster squinted, broken jaw working idly. \"Her name's White Dwarf, by the way. I guess Pinnacle didn't want to go far from the astrological naming conventions.\" Event Horizon nodded mutely, still unable to comprehend what was going on in front of him. \"Alright, good talk but I can feel the nut-job struggling against my control. We need to move, now. Get the others back to the cloning lab and I'll meet you there.\" White Dwarf began to jerkily trudge towards the dais, where Pinnacle sat atop his raised throne, seemingly unaware that Event Horizon was still staring at the bewitched woman.\n\n\"This has been the weirdest fucking week, I swear to god.\" He muttered angrily to himself before shimmering into an indistinct blur of movement. Each of his fellows found themselves abruptly standing outside of the chamber, their stomachs clenching nauseously. Event Horizon slid to a stop, bent over and groaning. \"Fuck me, he's heavy. Someone else get Stonewall, I think I threw my back out.\" Pilot braced himself against a wall, trying not to vomit inside his own helmet. \n\n\"What are you doing? I'm all for a tactical retreat but I thought we were doing the roaring rampage of revenge thing.\" Event Horizon waved the mercenary off with a pained sigh, trying to work out the kinks in his back. The Scarlet Sentinel spun threads of magic between her hands and Stonewall appeared with a flash of crimson energy. The titanic superhero swung around, bewildered. \n\n\"May I ask why we have absconded from the battle?\" There was a tone of violence simmering beneath the surface to his words, though Stonewall remained impeccably polite. \"The tide was turning, I'm certain of it.\" Patterdemalion consoled him with a tiny talon on the shoulder.\n\n\"There, there my colossal champion. I believe that our swift soldier has a purpose to this.\" The group turned their attention to the groaning speedster, waiting for an answer. They waited even longer as he proceeded to stretch out his shoulders, cracking each bone one by one. \n\n\"We need to get the hell out of here. We'll double-back through the cloning chamber and snatch one of the ships on the way out.\" There was an immediate protest from the team before he silenced them with a wave of his hand. \"Listen, Kitsune's got it handled. We just need to grab one of the clone chambers on the way out.\" He finally started to move, expecting the others to follow behind him. \"It's a long story but I think I can surmise it as: Shit got whack, yo.\" As Event Horizon began to explain, a very different scene was playing out inside the chamber. White Dwarf bowed to Pinnacle with a lazy smile, her broken form creaking as she did. \n\n\"Good evening, good sir. For tonight's entertainment I present to you the broken toy of a crazed megalomaniac.\" Pinnacle glared imperiously at his creation, a hint of bewilderment across his visage. \"Try not to look so surprised, you colossal prick. You will learn that I have quite the arsenal of tricks up my sleeve.\" Minato dropped his borrowed head to the side, looking at the shattered body-suit he now wore. \"Well, my metaphorical sleeves anyway. Seriously, what is it with you and spandex? You know that the heroes don't actually wear this shit, right?\" Realisation dawned on the mad scientist and his face burned red in fury. When he spoke, it was with the hiss of a serpent. \n\n\"Kitsune.\" Minato clapped the shattered hands of his host together mockingly. Even with his purloined eyes swollen shut, the medium watched in satisfaction as Pinnacle clenched his fists so tight that the veins threatened to explode. \"So, you possess the ability to project your own consciousness into the body of another. Fascinating.\" Aristocratic features pulled tight in a disdainful sneer. \"How unfortunate for you that I have already created a simulacrum of you, twisting your DNA to my own means. Thus, I do not require your spiritual presence any longer.\" The would-be conqueror gestured negligently and Minato's assumed body exploded into gory chunks, viscera painting the chamber walls. Kitsune barely had time to scream before his shimmering spirit was ejected, the radiant glow of his ghostly essence dimmer than it had been. \n\n\"Son of a bitch.\" The deceased criminal growled under his nonexistent breath, reeling from his second death in as many minutes. \"Didn't buy them as much time as I thought I would.\" He winced as his spectral form ached; the burn not dissimilar to a muscle after an extended work-out. Willing himself to glide through the astral plane around him, Minato soon caught sight of his comrades; Stonewall circumventing locked doors by bulldozing through several walls. Biting his lip, Minato contemplated a difficult choice. On the material plane, the remainder of the team were carefully following through the jagged hole that Stonewall had torn when Event Horizon fell into a violently twitching pile of limbs. He stilled for just long enough to speak, his body still jerking spasmodically. \"Sorry guys, I couldn't hold Pinnacle off. Just get to the cloning bay and we'll be all good.\" For the most part, he was met with confused questions and concerned glances; Doctor Paradox waved a glowing palm in front of his face.\n\n\"I sense the spirit of Minato Arisato here. It seems that he has managed to sustain his soul through the rigours of death, though I do not know how.\" River Fox twisted to look at the possessed speedster with a hopeful gaze. Doctor Paradox continued to speak, his voice echoing ever-so slightly. \"Minato, you must vacate this body immediately. Inhabiting a body already possessed of a soul will damage both your spirit and theirs. Say what you must and depart.\" When a master of magic tells you to stop haunting your friend, you do it.\n\n\"Understood. Pinnacle and his team will be right behind you. He has a clone of me in the lab, so I should be able to inhabit that body.\" Event Horizon's bruised visage smiled crookedly at River Fox before slackening. Minato continued to watch from his ethereal vantage point, his dim luminescence a painful reminder of how weak he now felt. He followed along after the group best he could but his form was wracked with exhaustion and the shade of Kitsune trailed behind them feebly. More and more, Minato could feel himself slipping away. Though no air passed through his lungs, the con-man found himself wheezing as he hovered through the open doorway of the cloning laboratory. Hearing the pounding of Zel'tan forces in the distance, he steeled himself and stretched his will towards the team.\n\n\"How do we know if this works?\" River Fox chewed on her lip anxiously, strands of water twirling around her. Everyone had since spread out, trying to locate the pod that contained their quarry. \"You said he was fading away, Paradox. What if Kitsune's not strong enough to inhabit a clone body?\" The conflict between her distress and her pragmatism reflected in her powers, the tendrils of water bobbing uneasily. \"We can't afford to waste time here. If he's going to do this, it needs to be now.\" A gloved hand fell on her shoulder, turning her gently. \n\n\"I've always loved a woman with a good sense of priorities.\" The face smiling weakly through his shattered helmet belonged to Pilot but the winsome gleam was Minato through and through. \"Sorry to keep you waiting. It's getting harder and harder to force myself along. We've got lizards coming from the control chamber and I can't imagine that Pinnacle's crew will be far behind.\" He collapsed abruptly, clutching at his chest in pain. \"I can't hold on much longer. It's like I'm dragging myself through broken glass, underwater and carrying Event Horizon.\" That earned him a swat from the speedster, though there was little malice to it. The doors slammed shut as he spoke, Doctor Paradox overriding several core systems. \"We find the body?\" Stonewall hauled the capsule over one shoulder, placing it gently in front of the kneeling mercenary. \"Good. Great. Awesome.\" Minato looked at his friends through Pilot's eyes. \"If I don't pull through, kill this piece of shit for me.\" \n\n\"Count on it.\" Event Horizon and River Fox growled in unison as Stonewall nodded grimly. Pilot chuckled feebly before dropping limply to the grating. He pushed himself up slowly, helped by the Scarlet Sentinel. He watched along with his allies, desperate for some sign of motion or activity. Seconds passed and hope turned to despair before the Scarlet Sentinel sighed remorsefully, shaking her head. Patterdemalion dropped onto Event Horizon's shoulder, offering a sympathetic talon to his grieving friend. River Fox squeezed her eyes shut tightly, choking back a pained sob. Pilot shook his head with a weary breath. \"You absolute fucking prick.\" Event Horizon seethed, slamming a fist against the translucent screen. \"You weren't meant to die. I thought it would be me or Pilot or one of the spandex crowd. Wasn't meant to be you.\" He punched the container impotently once again before River Fox placed a consoling hand on his shoulder.\n\nThe impact sent a shock through the tube and, with a trembling breath, the naked duplicate flickered into consciousness. His eyes throbbed painfully and his vision was filtered green but Minato recognised the faces staring back at him. There was silent disbelief for a moment before Stonewall took charge.\n\n\"Move, move. We need to get him out of there and get moving.\" Lightly brushing the gathered group aside, the powerful hero grasped the pod with both hands and pulled. Advanced, super-science alloys came undone beneath the strength of Stonewall and Minato tumble out into the waiting arms of River Fox. He smiled up at her and she down at him, a strange parody of the traditional lover's embrace. \n\n\"Hi there.\" His voice was hoarse and unused. She chuckled tearfully, wiping the gel from his thin frame with her powers. \n\n\"Hi yourself.\" The moment was broken by Event Horizon kneeling between them. \n\n\"Alright, break it up. Let's get away from the omnipotent psychopath now and canoodle later.\" He lifted Kitsune's body carefully, wincing at how light he was. \"Which way back to the cargo bay?\" They were interrupted by a squeal of protest from the door and surrounding walls, the metal beginning to warp beneath immense pressure. Stonewall glared at the shifting substance, positioning himself between it and his wards. \n\n\"Pinnacle is here. Go. I will hold him back.\" Even the super-criminals among them protested but he silenced them with a deep rumble. \"If we continue to run, he will catch us. I will delay them for as long as possible while you take a pair of Talons. Split up and keep moving; it will be more difficult to track you separately.\" There was a horrendous shrieking from the doorway as it began to buckle before them. \"No more arguments. I count on you to finish this battle, my friends. Farewell.\" He smiled at them reassuringly before turning his back on them, accepting his fate. The group looked among each other in sorrow before Event Horizon took the lead.\n\n\"Which way to the cargo bay?\" Doctor Paradox growled angrily before leading them through another door-way. Patterdemalion was the last to pass through the threshold, regarding Stonewall with a respectful gaze before flying through the doorway. The group made it to the cargo bay without further concern, desperately trying to ignore the roar of combat behind them and the shaking of the ship around them. There was no deliberation as to who would board each Talon; heroes and villains separating naturally into groups. \n\n\"We'll find a way to contact each other. Until then, stay safe.\" River Fox stroked Minato's face affectionately before slipping inside the alien craft. The heroes were the first to leave, their craft blasting a hole through the hanger doors. The emptiness of space greeted them, their dart-shaped vessel hurtling into the void without any preamble. The villains watched them go with far more fondness than they expected for their nemesi. Only once the Talon began to shake violently did they remember that Pinnacle was hunting them. Pilot threw the engines into full acceleration to force the vehicle forward slowly as Pinnacle strained his mental muscles, dragging them backwards. \n\nThere was a startlingly familiar noise throughout the cock-pit and the access ramp began to lower. Patterdemalion quickly erected a telekinetic barrier around his companions, preventing them from suffocating. A thick mist roiled inside the ship, coalescing into Lady Chilltouch with her hand around Pilot's throat. With a slight grunt of exertion, she heaved the armoured mercenary across the ship and down the lowered ramp. The group watched helplessly as Pilot floated weightlessly for a moment before the vacuum of space took a hold of him and their friend vanished out the gaping aperture. \n\nThere was a defiant roar that echoed through the cargo bay, heard even over the caccophanic howl of space; the bloodied and broken form of Stonewall slamming into Pinnacle. With his concentration shattered, the force holding their Talon vanished and the vessel roared into space. Patters mentally nudged the control panel to raise the ramp, sealing Lady Chilltouch in with them. Event Horizon was on her in moments, a flurry of violence that nothing could prevent. Patters tried in vain to reach Pilot but the Talon soon passed him. \n\n\"The soldier is too far away. I cannot bring him to us.\" He paused for breath, a horrible idea coming to him. \"I cannot but perhaps you can.\" Minato cocked his head to the side, clutching at the chair beneath him. \"None of us can pilot this wondrous vessel save for him and you have shown the ability to force spirits into unwilling hosts.\" One thin talon gestured sharply at the struggling vampire beside them. \"Make use of her cold, dead heart and free us of a lifeless exile to the depths of the cosmos.\" Minato winced at the thought of it before nodding. Eyes clenched in concentration, the Kitsune invoked Pilot's spirit to return. It was slow at first, as such things were with the recently deceased. The mercenary appeared in a bewildered state, his soul coalescing into a vaugely corporeal cloud of light. \n\n\"Pilot, buddy, pal. Going to need you to do me a solid.\" Though unspoken, his intention was clear. Lady Chilltouch jerked and spasmed as a foreign spirit slithered inside her flesh. What little essence of hers that remained was quashed by the brilliant light of a mortal soul. The vampire stilled beneath Event Horizon, the speedster pulling a lethal blow at the last second, before opening her eyes.\n\n\"Did...Did I die?\" Even with the faux-british accent that rolled off off the tongue, the cadence rung of Pilot. Ignoring the looming super-human, she began to feel herself over with some confusion. \"Why...Do I have...Am I a woman?\" Event Horizon chuckled mirthlessly at his friend, helping her up with a steady hand.\n\n\"If it makes you feel any better, you're a damn sight prettier. What are you doing after this?\" Event Horizon hit the wall with a thud, as Pilot's newly-found vampiric strength surged to the fore-front. The undead mercenary slumped into the control chair and began numbly navigating back to Earth. Minato and Patterdemalion glanced at each other worriedly before shrugging in acceptance. Event Horizon dragged himself up, chuckling. \"So, to recap: Stonewall is probably dead, we don't know where the others are, Minato is wearing a clone meat-suit of himself and Pilot has a kickin' body but no heart-beat.\" He dropped into a free chair, head slumping between his knees. \"I fucking hate Tuesdays.\"\n\n\"Where should I touch down?\" A sultry voice called from the cock-pit. Minato whispered something, his voice finally given out. Patterdemalion patted the medium fondly before floating forward. \n\n\"Back to New York, my dear haemovore. The sweet sulphur scent of my brother caresses my mind's nose. Tatterdemalion could very well help us turn the tide here.\" ",

        "text": "Hello! I'll try not to waste too much time before diving into the story, but I suppose I should start with a little background. Our current group is composed of\n\nRoman Gierzo: a deep gnome wizard with a sprinkle of cleric of Pelor.\n\nTarek: a human monk who punches with the power of the _sun_.\n\nAvery: a human swashbuckling rogue ex-pirate, who will do more damage than you and look fucking fantastic while doing so.\n\nCodron: a minotaur psion (homebrew) who uses his psionic powers primarily for axe murder, played by yours truly.\n\nThe setting is the abyssal layer of the Endless Maze, labyrinthian home of Baphomet, demon lord of minotaurs. We are here because we died, and are currently in the process of violently slogging our way back out. \n\nSo, we join our valiant heroes as they are on room #283 of fighting their way through the hellish inhabitants of the abyss. We're all a little tired because of all the murder, and the heat, and the near guarantee of traps every time we open a door. We come upon a room which contains a single [Barlgura](http://www.aidedd.org/dnd/images/barlgura.jpg), whom we have encountered before and know vaguely how to deal with, that being beating the snot out of them as fast as possible. We do so, and are standing triumphantly on top of it's corpse when our wizard friend notices a crack in the ceiling and gets an idea. He tells me to \"get me to that crack\"\n\nNow, this question comes about because the last time we required the power of flight, I stole a rug, cast telekinesis on it, and used a loose interpretation of the rules in order to fly us to the top of the castle tower. However, that particular rug is unfortunately no more, and there were no replacements that I could see in our cold, stone prison. \n\nBut we did have a giant gorilla corpse.\n\nSo I cast telekinesis on our rug stand-in, and we begin flying towards the crack. Of course, there's now way it would be that easy, and the ceiling stretches to infinity as we attempt to approach it. Of course. So we fly back down astride our graceful mount, and move on. But telekinesis has a duration of 10 minutes, and I'm not about to waste a 5th level spell for nothing, so while everybody else hopped off and started walking around, I stayed astride my new steed, riding in style.\n\nSo, a few traps and empty rooms later, I am continually mentioning the Barlgura, determined to find something useful to do with it. My prayers were answered when we entered a room covered in razor wire, strung up from wall to wall. While we could fairly easily have picked our way through, I instead decided to use my favorite hoverboard to rip all the razor wire out of the walls. It takes a bit since the room was so big, but we made it through safely and I now had possession of a giant, flying, razor-coated gorilla corpse. What a day.\n\nThe door beyond is locked of course, so what to do but smash through it with my multipurpose cadaver. Upon doing so, I hear an Orcish voice from beyond say loudly and distinctly \"what the fuck?\". Seeing my opportunity, I raised the possessed carcass into the air and wiggled it around menacingly, saying \"I am the ghost of Harambe, here to reap your sins!\"\n\nThe Orcs. Fucking. Bolted.\n\nEvery single one of them ran, and by the time we got into the room there wasn't a single one left. Keep in mind these were Orcs who had been stuck here so long they had actually fully gone insane from the horrors of the abyss.\n\nAnd Harambe scared them shitless.",

        "text": "This took place in a campaign that I've been running for sometime using Fantasy Grounds and within the WFRP 2nd Edition Ruleset.\n\nThis was a hilarious moment that I think is worth telling, and involves a dwarf slayer and his rememberer, Tafwick, a shifty halfling. For anyone unfamiliar with Warhammer Fantasy lore; a slayer is a dwarf who seeks out a glorious honorable death to redeem his family name. A dwarf takes up the slayer oath for various reasons. Usually it's because they did something that shamed themselves or their family.\n\nNow, a rememberer is a chronicler who journeys with the slayer in question and jots down his deeds, his kills and so on. It's a very important role. Not all slayers have a rememberer, and usually they are recruited from ordinary folk who the slayer may have befriended at one stage. Once you accept the duty of becoming a slayer's rememberer, there is no backing out... unless you fancy a slayer's axe to the back of your head. It is the rememberer's duty to pass the knowledge of the slayer's passing to the slayer king. To re-emphasis, a dwarf slayer seeks out a worthy death. Such a death must always result in combat with the dwarf. And such a death must come from a worthy foe. Getting gored to death by a stags antlers for example is a shit death, and not one a slayer would be proud of. \n\nNow that we have bit of lore out of the way; this brief story involves Durgin and Tafwick, two characters who are played by Cortez and Darren respectively. \n\nTafwick had only recently become Durgin's Rememberer after his last one died. Tafwick was offered the position which he took with some pride. Although one could say he was almost intimidated into the role...\n\nSo this tragic story takes place just as the party are leaving a town called Wittgendorf. To sum it up; the undead are on the rise in the town, there is a troll causing havoc up at a nearby castle that overlooks the town, and the general populace is in disarray. Did I say the party were also responsible for all of this? No? Ok they were...\n\nSo the party are about to leave Wittgendorf by boat (its a river town) when Durgin decides that he's not having it; he simply can't leave knowing that there is undead and some big nasty fucker waiting to be smashed. He promptly jumps onto the pier, but as Tafwick tries to follow him, Durgin, knowing that he may be going to meet his doom, does not want Tafwick to meet that said doom. He tries to convince Tafwick to stay behind, but Tafwick refuses. Durgin, thinking of his last rememberer and how he died, and still reeling with guilt over that, knocks Tafwick out and tells the party to keep him on the barge.\n\nSo the barge drifts off as Durgin goes up to the castle to face his greatest test yet.\n\nAnd that greatest test is none other than a troll. Not just any troll, but a troll that has been twisted and shaped by chaos. A chaos troll. It is currently fighting the undead (and winning without breaking a sweat) when Durgin approaches it. Screaming out Grimnir's name, he charges into the fight and starts swinging at the troll. Unknown to him, Tafwick has woken up. He realizes that Durgin has abandoned him, but Tafwick, himself reeling with guilt over a previous incident, decides to jump into the river and swim ashore.\n\nIt's important to note here that Durgin and Tafwick have a shaky relationship ever since Tafwick stole the chance for Durgin to kill a powerful vampire that the party were fighting. Tafwick had tossed in a smokebomb which blinded everyone, and as a result, Durgin missed his killing blow... the kill went to another party member. He was rightly furious.\n\nBack on track; Tafwick swims ashore and makes his way back to the town. The party leave him to it, not willing to go back to that hellhole. \n\nIn the meantime, Durgin is duking it out with the troll. Each swing he takes, each hit, the troll, being a troll, regenerates most of the wounds that Durgin is dishing out. It's a very one-sided affair but Durgin doesn't care, he's relishing this. As is the player. Then the moment comes... The troll smashes Durgin onto the ground (critical hit) that pulverizes his spine. Durgin is paralysed. Unable to move, he stares up at the troll and the player shouts, \"BRING IT! GIVE IT TO ME!\" Durgin is about to meet his dream doom; death at the hands of a worthy foe. The troll raises its fists to slam down upon the motionless body of Durgin Gromundsson, when an arrow comes out of nowhere and strikes the troll in the arm.\n\nSuddenly the troll stops its attack, looks and glances over at a halfling on the battlements with a bow and arrow. It rages. It's not the only thing that is raging... Durgin Gromundsson is shouting obsenities at the halfling. He is furious, and the player is livid. The GM (that's me) can't hold in his laughter... The troll gives chase as Durgin is absolutely ranting fury at Tafwick, who, bless his soul, thought he was doing the right thing saving Durgin.\n\nAs the troll is distracted, Durgin is peering into the sky and thinking about various methods in killing halflings when he spots something odd... Looking down at him from the higher battlements above him, he sees two dozen beady red eyes staring back at him.\n\n\"O shit... Skaven.\" Earlier on, Durgin had a mighty fight with a large group of skaven that resulted in the death of their grey seer. They've been watching his little fight with the troll, but now a new opportunity has presented itself. An opportunity of revenge. Durgin was helpless as a dozen skaven jumped down wielding rusty cleavers and daggers, and proceeded to go to stabby town on poor Durgin Gromundsson.\n\nDurgin ended up getting the consolation prize; yet that was better than the alternative.\n\nAs for Tafwick, well... he escaped the troll, but didn't escape the peasantry of the town, who were looking for someone to blame for all this mess. He ended up swinging with a rope around his neck. \n",

        "text": "The next bunch of sessions are going to be very briefly written up due to the lack of free time I have at the moment to write them. Where I can I will add any interesting dialogue if I can recall it.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\nThe party continue through the Other Forest until they notice a bizarre sight. Splashed across the trunk of a tree is a glistening multicolored stain. At first Bittersweet and Zing debate whether it may indeed the... excitement... of a Unicorn. Upon closer examinations it appears to be blood of some kind, rainbow colored blood. Bittersweet licks it and confirms it tastes like blood.\n\nLooking up the party spot several wooden figures hanging from a low branch. The figures resemble faeries carved out of wood, intricate, life-like wooden statues. Gidyan recalls that some species of fey do indeed turn into wood upon their death.\nDespite Corrin's misgivings the party take the wooden corpses and Bittersweet decides to hang one around his neck for luck.\n\nEventually night falls and the party decide to camp for the night rather than try and reach the monastery. Shortly after dark, on Corrin's watch, several large boulders begin to glow from their bases. He wakes Gidyan who examines the glowing rocks. The alchemist correctly identifies the phenomenon as glowmold. Corrin covers the end of his staff with it as the glow properties last for three nights when the mold is harvested.\n\n**Day 36, Mirtul, 1489DR**\n\nThe next day the party head on and by mid-morning the reach their destination. Sitting squat between ancient gnarled trees, a ruined monastery comes into view. Made of simple stone blocks, worn smooth with the passage of time, the stout building is falling apart. Sections of the slanted shale roof have collapsed and portions of the outer wall have crumbled. Razorcrows watch them from the roof of the monastery. \n\nWeeds and wild thorn plants run rampant across the field leading up to the place, leaving only the slightest indication of a path that ends at the ruined front doors. Beyond, an overgrown yard sits in shadow.\n\nThe group move cautiously into the courtyard. Tall grasses and chunks of stone debris have all but overtaken this small yard. Off to one side, a wooden stable has collapsed into a mound of rotting timbers and moldy straw. The outer wall on the east side has also collapsed, leaving a ragged hole. Three doors exit into this yard— a pair of double doors to the east, a single door to the north, and a lone door leading into the squat tower in the southeast corner.\n\nBittersweet decides to explore the squat tower but he's unable to break down the door. Borrowing Grimgar's crowbar they get the door open. Thick webs cover much of the ancient crates and barrels stored inside the base of the tower. A rickety wooden staircase ascends along one wall to reach an open trapdoor above. Corrin, Grimgar and Zing enter and search the crates. They find a silver short sword which Grimgar claims. Bittersweet begins to climb the stair case but Gidyan cries out for him to stop. Too late, the tielfing's weight brings the staircase down and though most of them get away with some bruises, Zing is knocked down and partially buried.\n\nSuddenly a monstrous black spider emerges from the trap door above and scuttles down toward the trapped gnome. Corrin blasts it with Sacred Flame but the quick arachnid scuttles to the side avoiding the attack. It strikes, sinking its fangs into Zing and in seconds he feels his muscles stiffening up. The others attack and after a short battle manage to bring the creature down.\n\nThey decide to rest for a moment in the tower and Corrin removes the poison from Zing's body with a Lesser Restoration. The exit the tower and move to a well in one corner. After some exploration with a Light stone, Grimgar agrees be lowered down and he finds the body of a dead human, probably a thief from his leather armor and thieves tools. They also find fifty feet of silk rope and a blue Potion of Healing. \n\nGidyan remarks on how that is not the normal color such potions come in but thinks it may just be a quirk of the brewing process.\n\nThey enter the main building through the double doors and immediately move to investigate the chapel ahead after spotting ruined pews and a desecrated altar from the open doors. Gidyan and Corrin are the first ones through and the first to be attacked.\n\nFrom the single drop a pair of Darkmantles, each enveloping the gnome and the halfing. Before the others can react the chamber is plunged into supernatural chaos. \n\nA tense battle of wild swings and muffled cries ensues until Gidyan finally uses Thunderwave to knock the Darkmantles off the two hapless short folk. More poorly judged attacks and spells before one of the creatures is killed, and then the other, moments before it can finish off the halfing priest.\n\nCorrin identifies the altar as once being dedicated to Moradin the Dwarven God of the Forge but know represents Droskar, the vile Dwarven God of Toil and Suffering. He decides he is going to stay and consecrate the altar. The close the doors and decide to take a rest. During that time, they hear a pair of feet scurry past the door, stop and the scurry off.\n\nAfter their break, Bittersweet wanders off and discovers a room with a table, chair and an uncooked meal of razorcrow on a plate. He decides to try some and instantly feels ill. Of to the left of the chapel the others discover a library and Zing almost chokes on some deadly mold as he searches the books. He finds a holy book dedicated to Moradin and inside is tucked a divine scroll. Returning to the chapel they hand the scroll to Corrin who identifies it as Spiritual Weapon. He tucks it into his pack and continues cleaning the altar.\n\nThe others exit by the door they came and open a small room. Inside is the skeleton of a dwarven monk in robes. They find a suicide note on his body. He was a worshipper of Droskar who could toil no longer. They also find his unholy symbol. Gidyan also finds a lone ironbloom mushroom.\n\nDown a corridor they come to a door where they hear animal sniffing coming from beyond. They decide to leave it alone and continue down another long corridor. Bittersweet enters a room on the left and discovers an armory. Searching through some crates he finds for crossbow bolts that don't match the others in stock.\nSuddenly a cry comes from Corrin in the chapel. Stumbling over themselves they rush back and find an armored kobold attacking the halfling with a dagger. Before they can stop him he stabs Corrin in the stomach and drops the priest unconsciousness. They attack and make short work of the kobold who turns out to be some sort of thief from the thieves' tools they find on him. Grimgar decides to feed the halfling the blue Potion of Healing. It works and also turns Corrin's skin blue.\n\nThe party debate where to go to do next.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED...\n\n\n**[[5e] Defiance in Phlan - Session 9] (https://np.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/55k9o6/5e_defiance_in_phlan_session_9/)**\n\n",

        "text": "EDIT: The player must have mixed up his characters and given me the wrong name.  That's why his character is listed as \"Theron\" in the previous log and \"Ansai\" in this one.  It's the same character, though.\n\n[When last we left out heroes](/r/gametales/comments/51vxdd) they were en route to the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine.  \n\nFe'ern rolled well and recalled a lot about the Mandalorians; their culture and their history.  I got to dump a bunch of information onto the players about the Mandalorian Wars, the Jedi Civil War, and how anti-jedi sentiment is still strong in some areas.\n\nAnsai's player and I hashed out some of Ansai's backstory.  I didn't initially realize this, but his player placed the character's backstory right in the Dantooine jedi enclave.  I thought about it for twenty seconds before deciding it was at least as interesting as anything I would have come up with, and asked him why he hadn't been inducted as a jedi.  We finally decided that his father made some back-room deal to keep Ansai out of the jedi order because his mother turned to the dark side.\n\nThe Ebon Hawk arrived on Dantooine and landed in the jedi enclave.  Ansai didn't want to come out to the jedi enclave and planned to explore the ship, but I didn't want to split the party so I asked his player to come up with a reason why Ansai would accompany the rest of the party to the jedi enclave.  He decided that, since Igar (the fanboy) almost wandered into dangerous territory last session, Ansai would come to make sure Igar stayed out of trouble. \n\nAn unnamed jedi with dark skin and dreadlocks (I'm gonna call him Rasta-jedi for this story) showed up and asked Canderous why the ship landed there so unexpectedly.  Canderous told him to cut the crap and tell Canderous what he wanted to know, which confused Rasta-jedi, since Canderous hadn't actually said what he wanted to know.  Canderous tried to bull-rush Rasta-jedi but Rasta-jedi used the Force to keep Canderous from advancing a single inch, followed by slamming Canderous to the ground and keeping him there. Canderous is an NPC, so I didn't mind taking him out of play like that.  Canderous' girlfriend Rukil shot the jedi who deflected it back at her with his lightsaber, knocking the blaster out of her hand.  At this point a bunch of jedi showed up to take Canderous and Rukil to holding cells, while the rest of the PCs (and Igar) were given the benefit of the doubt.  Ansai was concerned that Rasta-jedi would recognize him so I had Ansai make an unmodified luck roll.  He rolled high enough that Rasta-jedi didn't recognize him, but it was a close one.  Igar, of course, had a total fanboy moment and gushed about how cool that all was.\n\nAnsai and Fe'ern followed Rasta-jedi, but another jedi showed up and requested Rasta-jedi to act as the third Master to confirm a padawan's acceptance.  Rasta-jedi invited the party to follow him.  I figured Ansai would prefer to go straight to their quarters, so I had Igar gush about how he wanted to see whatever was going on.  Ansai reluctantly agreed to come along with the rest of the party.  Since Ansai was lagging behind I give him an opportunity.  \n\nGM: \"You recognize the area you're walking through from when you were a kid.  Off to one side is an open doorway.  As long as you remember it's been closed and secured.  You tried breaking in before but the encryption was too strong.  Do you sneak in, knowing that if you're caught it will sour relationships with the jedi?\"\n\nAfter a quick double-check of his Hide/Sneak skill (Fair), he decided to go for it.  He made a successful Knowledge (Technology) roll and identified the rows of objects before him as holocrons, priceless keepers of jedi knowledge, and even a few sith holocrons.  They all partially activated, accusing him of being an intruder and telling him to get out, but one of them whispered to him that the jedi and the sith were *both* fools, and that whenever one side got too strong, the other side would rise up to oppose them.\n\nAnsai: \"Well, she's not *wrong*...\"\n\nThe holocron activated fully with a silver glow and an old woman in face-concealing robes appeared, offering to teach him what he wanted to know.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I am one who has betrayed and been betrayed.  I have trained as both jedi and sith, but I am neither.  You can call me Kreia.\"\n\nAnsai pocketed the holocron and the next thing he knew he was outside of the room.  The doorway was securely locked, as if it had never been open, and the holocron weighed heavily in his pocket.\n\nMeanwhile, Fe'ern reunited with a friend.  Fe'ern had been an animal handler on the cruise ship from the first session and her player had wanted to know what happened to the creature she'd been taking care of; a large dog-sized six-legged [snuffleupaguss](https://www.google.com/search?q=snuffleupagus&amp;tbm=isch) named Missy.  I had planned to have Missy show up in the background of Taris, inexplicably fighting a mob of bad guys and doing quite well for himself.  The phrase \"carnage\" and \"a pile of limbs on the ground, none of them his\" were going to show up.  \n\nOf course, I totally forgot about this idea, and Fe'ern's character had been bugging me to find out what happened to Missy, so this seemed like a good place for a reunion.  Fe'ern got to the training area and saw Missy swinging a lightsaber with its trunk, deflecting blaster bolts from the three training drones circling him.  He spotted Fe'ern and dropped the lightsaber, joyfully lifting her in the air with his trunk before nuzzling his trunk up against her, then dropping to his back for a belly rub (which Fe'ern obliged).  Unfortunately the training drones were still active, and one of them tried to shoot Missy and Fe'ern.  Missy summoned the lightsaber to his trunk and reflected the shot back at the drone, automatically disabling all three of them.  Rasta-jedi saw this and had no objections to Missy joining the Jedi Order.\n\nThen a brown-skinned Yoda showed up and objected based on the fact that Missy was \"barely sentient, let alone sapient!\"  Rasta-jedi pointed out that Missy still has an incredibly strong presence in the Force, and that Crotchety-Yoda was outvoted anyways.  \n\nThat's when Crotchety-Yoda started floating in the air.  I make Fe'ern roll for Perception. She succeeded, so she was the only one who noticed that Missy's trunk was moving at the same height and speed as Crotchety-Yoda.  He spun Crotchety-Yoda around a few times before rolling him out of the room.\n\nFe'ern: \"And that's why you should treat Missy nicely.  He's smarter than you think.\"  \n\nThis was when Ansai showed up in a room where it seemed like everybody was trying to avoid laughing and Fe'ern was giving Missy a belly-rub saying, \"Who's a good future jedi?\"\n\nAnsai had no idea what was going on but didn't want to admit he had been in an off-limits area so he tried bluffing the information out of Igar by saying, \"Wasn't that cool?\"\n\nIgar gave him a weird look and said he wouldn't describe it as \"cool\", exactly.  Unfortunately, this had the exact opposite effect Ansai was hoping for, as one of the jedi recognized him and called out to him, drawing everybody's attention his way.\n\nThat's about when I took a quick break.\n\nWhen we came back I placed the party in their own rooms as guests of the jedi.  Missy didn't want to be parted from Fe'ern and there wasn't enough space for all four of them, so Igar was allowed to tag along with one of the apprentices.  A jedi told the remaining party members that Canderous and Rukil were cooling their heels for the night in stasis collars in the holding cell, and that tomorrow they would get everything sorted out.  Rasta-jedi warned Fe'ern that a great danger was approaching, one that could shift the balance of power on a galactic level, and that to face it, Fe'ern would need to be trained as a Jedi.  Rasta-jedi couldn't take personal responsibility, and he needed plausible deniability, but he handed her a jedi holocron to learn from, with a warning to not let any of the other jedi know she had it.\n\nFe'ern: \"Can I show Missy?  I mean, he's a jedi now.\"  \nRasta-jedi: (confused look) \"Just use your best judgment.\"\n\nAnd that's where I ended the session.  I forgot to give them EP last session, so I gave them double EP this time to make up for it.  Ansai took Mind-Reading and Mind-Affecting at Poor, and Fe'ern boosted her connection to the Force to Mediocre and took Telekinesis at Poor.",

Suddenly his bones were bleached clean.

They have the bodies of a vulture, heads of a rat, and the tail of a snake. This one was different though... its tail was a bundle of heads all of them hydras.

We took out the 'skull' an artifact of ancient power capable of storing undead and from its confines unleashed Tyrius the Devourer and his lesser intelligent brother snowflake who has been attached to Tyrius's torso.

        "text": "I'm a big fan of my playful tiefling bard named Poetry. I've managed to keep up a vague Russian accent for four months of gameplay. She's my first time trying a bard, and playing a character who is actively funny. She's a challenge, and I get a tad bit of performance anxiety playing her, but I think I'm actually getting better. I'm really starting to love playing her. I even custom designed a figure on Hero Craft, ordered it, and painted it.\n\nOur last session blew me away. It was stressful, heartbreaking, and just a fabulous experience. I had such respect for my DM, who is really coming into her own with the story and crafted some amazing moments to coincide with some pure dumb luck.\n\n**EXPOSITION**: Our party (lvl 2) met after being conscripted into the Navy of Waterdeep during wartime. Stranded at sea by a mysterious portal, we were now on a Sinbad/Sliders esque voyage lost in the multiverse. The archmage of our three-ship brigade -- the only person who could maybe get us back home through the portals through the realms -- had been captured by lycanthrope cultists of Malar, and we headed out to rescue him and what other crewmates we could. Our captain, who we had been warned by the god Sylvanus was 'corrupted' somehow, was leading our away mission. My bard, Poetry, had been made an ensign on the crew, and joined the captain in leading our party towards a rising smoke signal. We were on the trail of our kidnapped comrades.\n\n**THE SESSION**: While on the move, we encountered a pack of werewolf and humanoid cultists. We made short work of the combat, throwing everything we had at them. Sensing that we were on the clock now that a scouting team had seen us, we rushed onward without rest (and without most of our spells). Not really thinking about it, not really worrying about what lay ahead.\n\nSoon, we discovered a sacrificial bonfire, with our archmage and crewmates tied to poles over the blaze. Leading a band of cultists was a weretiger, Malar's lieutenant. \n\nWe ended up spending way too much time trying to concoct a scheme to ambush them, till we finally attacked, halfcocked and half armed with our usual firepower. My bard and our wizard managed to pulled the archmage down and start dragging him to safety, but were quickly bogged down by enemies. Our captain, failing to hit anything with his silver sword, and failing to successfully cast magic with an opal ring I'd noticed on him when we met, was struck unconscious alongside our archmage. Eventually, our party had all been whittled down to under a quarter of our HP, except for our fighter, a fellow tiefling, who knew now she had to save the day.\n\nOur druid fled into the jungle, peeking out to take pot shots until he was out of spells and almost out of health, then he lured the weretiger out into the jungle to buy us time. With 1 HP left, our wizard dropped the archmage and fled in the bushes. With only a handful of enemies left, though, our fighter took the silver sword from our fallen captain and tried to take on the weretiger head on. But she soon fell as well, starting to roll her death saves.\n\nWhich left my bard, Poetry, armed with only Vicious Mockery and a rapier, to do something. I could have run along with the others, but our fighter was a first time D&amp;D player. I couldn't leave her behind and let her die at lvl 2 as her first experience. I couldn't leave our captain, or our archmage. We'd be stranded in the Plane of Beasts forever. And I couldn't ignore the personality trait on my character sheet that read \"I am overconfident. I overestimate my abilities.\" Poetry was sure that she could do this.\n\nEyes darting back to the tree line, and to the pile of her unconscious allies, Poetry dashed up to the group to stabilize the fighter. That was when she heard the roar from the jungle tree line. Getting closer. The weretiger was coming back.\n\nShe couldn't save any of the three unconscious and get out alive (STR -1 represent! :P). In a panic, Poetry grabbed the silver sword and stole the opal ring off the soon-to-be dead captain's finger. She slipped it on, praying to her goddess Avandra, Lady of Luck, that it somehow would work, and save her even if she hadn't attuned to it or anything. For the briefest of moments, instead of the growl of the weretiger, Poetry swore that she heard whispers.\n\n(After which we all started laughing like \"Oh God, what did I just do?\")\n\nBut she ignored the disturbing sound (she'd thrown Dissonant Voices at so many folks at this point, she couldn't be bothered by some murmurs in her brain) and ran headlong into the forest. Hunted by the terrifying weretiger. He caught up with her quickly. Slashing and taking her final hit points. Poetry had missed with her lone attack with the stolen silver sword. She hadn't even gotten a chance to try and throw whatever magic she'd just put on her hand.\n\nI rolled five times total during my death saves. Fail, save, fail, save...fail.The table went quiet.\n\nOur party had been scattered. One unconscious, along with our two most powerful allies. Two others hiding, afraid and powerless.\n\nAnd Poetry, who had run back to save her friend, who had no business in this damned navy, died quietly in the brush. Alone. No one in the party had even seen it happen.\n\nWe were all super bummed. My DM bemoaned that she had really really liked how I played Poetry. I bemoaned the thirty bucks I'd spent on my figurine. I could play Poetry again someday, but for now, she was gone.\n\nWe all exhaled after what seemed like an hour of the most stressful fighting we'd encountered yet. Our DM said she really hadn't expected it to be that hard, but then again, she hadn't expected us to use up all our spells on the first encounter. She offered her condolences to me. I was laughing it off, but to be honest, I was just sort of shell-shocked, staring at my figure, at all the time and energy and prep I had put into it and my journal and my character. How much I had grown really fond of Poetry.\n\nAfter a moment, though, our DM's eyes went wide. \"We'll talk in a second,\" she said to me. Then returned to finish up the session.\n\nOur druid and wizard (both elves) took their needed 4 hours’ rests, and replenished their spells. When they came to, they found each other, and poked their heads back at the bonfire. The archmage and our fighter were strapped to poles at the fire, unconscious and soon to be sacrificed by the weretiger and some returning cultists. No sign of the captain or Poetry. Hiding in the brush, they didn't notice her body nearby. They didn't even realize that she had been killed.\n\nWith little care for a repeat of the last encounter, they rushed back to the ship to retrieve help from our remaining crew. If they are very lucky, the sacrificial ritual will still be going on when they arrive during our next session, and they'll be able to rescue the archmage and our fighter party member.\n\nRoll credits on the session.\n\nBut then our DM queues up creepy mysterious music.\n\nPoetry is surrounded by darkness, for what seems like ages, then a beacon of ghostly light appears before her. She reaches out for it, climbs towards it, and is greeted by a frail, emaciated form. \n\nA lich.\n\nThe ring is what led him to her. (Fuck, if I hadn’t taken that thing like a little klepto…) He casually mourns the loss of our captain, says that he had such potential, now squandered. Poetry has the same potential. As does the mysterious, so far nameless man who is to blame for these ruptures between realms. The lich finds him very intriguing. \n\nHe offers Poetry a second chance. Join a covenant with the lich, and he will bestow power and knowledge on her. He will return her to life.\n\nPoetry still remembers the agony of being eviscerated by the weretiger. Of bleeding out alone in the jungle. She had been so scared. So alone. She isn't ready. \n\nShe remembers being on the deck of their ship, watching as Captain Scarborough is mortally wounded, only to suddenly stop bleeding, act as though he hadn't been injured at all. He had been protected by this being. He had wielded far more power than she'd realized.\n\nLike the true Party Face that she is, Poetry persuades her way to getting a little more of the fine print of the deal. Though it’s just about as vague as possible - the lich will grant her power, and life, and one day he will task her with something in exchange. \n\nWith little concern for the future, just focused on the possibility of still *having* one...\n\n\"Deal,” she says. They shake on it.\n\n\nOur DM stands and nods. \"The deal is made. You wake suddenly in the jungle, just as you had died, only your wounds have all closed up. Replaced with scars.\"\n\nI have the biggest grin on my face.\n\n\"All of Poetry’s bard features and powers have been replaced with Warlock,\" she announces, pleased with herself.\n\n---------------\n\nI am so frickin' excited for next session. \n",

        "text": "Hey there again r/gametales! Last week I posted a story about how ingenuity worked over brute force [found here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/52t94x/dd_5e_the_trojan_horse_or_how_we_learned_to_stop/). This week’s tale however is an emotional one, as it ended up being possibly the most tense ending to a session I’ve ever had (even more so than the time I was nearly eaten by a mindflayer – but that’s for another time…maybe.) Spoilers for the “Hoard of the Dragon Queen; Tyranny of Dragons” campaigns. You’ve been warned.\n\n\nI’d like to preface this by saying that this was our Rogue’s last session with us as she was leaving for university. So, the same as last week, our cast of characters are: Dietrich the Tiefling Warlock (me) and his imp companion Pipyap; Serine the Half-elf Pirate Captain (Rogue); Dramina the Wood Elf Ranger; Keth the Half-Orc Paladinand Drache the Human Cleric. We pretty much phased out the NPCs as they were pretty much inconsequential to the plot and were there because of the story more than anything. However, the game focused on us, so they were basically a null point. \n\n\nAt the end of last week’s session, we found the huge Temple of the Scale which we’d been hunting for ever since Serine had a vision that was where her boyfriend/Captain Hook was being held. We figured out the puzzle to enter the temple and do so. After a lot of walking we find a long corridor with three doors; one in front of us, one to the left and one to the right. We do some exploring to the right and left as we cannot access the doors straight ahead; fight some ghouls which Dietrich accidentally disturbed (my bad), and try to work out our plan.\n\n\nThat’s when we hear a voice on the other side of the doors we’ve been unable to get through; turns out the Halfling dragon cult member we’d been after was hidden behind them after the rest of his cultists were attacked by zombies. We “coax” him out (with gun powder and explosions), find out about a powerful magic item that’s locked up, and walk into the room he hid himself away in. \n\n\nThere’s a huge double door made of metal in front of us, and four smaller doors (two on each side) leading to four different rooms, each with a puzzle in them linked to different elements (ice, poison, electricity and acid). In each room is a piece of a key needed to open the main door. A few puzzles (and near deaths for me) later, we assemble the key and place it into the huge metal door, which opens.\n\n\nInside, we find a Wight who has been cursed in his un-death to guard the “scale”; a scale from the armor of Tiamat herself which allows whoever possesses it to control any dragon they choose (it’s the size and weight of a tower shield). Now, this Wight is (in the DM’s words) chaotic evil, but is also a pretty cordial chap all things considered (I’d have him pegged as LE but hey ho). Once we tell him we’re not after the scale (which we weren’t- we didn’t know it existed until finding the halfling), he’s pretty cool about letting us go. His only job is to guard the scale and, since we’re not after it, he has no fucks to give. And nor do we.\n\n\nWe leave the room and go off in search of Hook. That’s when we bump into the character who we once got thrown in jail (Henceforth known as The Warden); and what do you know, Hook is her prisoner. Behind her are six, hench-looking body guards. We don’t want to risk a fight because none of us particularly want to die, so we decide to strike up a deal. \n\n\nShe’s looking for the scale. We want Hook. If we get her the scale, she’ll give us Hook. OOC we make a plan; we’ll lead her men to the Wight, let the Wight kill them, and then go 5-1 against The Warden because we’ll absolutely demolish her. Plan made, we take her team of six henchmen to the Wight and let them do their thing; the Wight doesn’t like their plans and proceeds to [melt some faces]( http://i.makeagif.com/media/9-07-2015/tzehJ7.gif) after they try and take the scale (they only succeeded in knocking it to the floor). We stood outside and closed the doors because why spread the mess right?\n\n\nHearing the screams of her men being obliterated, The Warden turns up with Hook in tow. The Wight makes a beeline for her, sensing she’s with the pile of offal now littering his room, fully intending on melting her face too. However, she throws up a magic shield which prevents anyone from crossing, including us. We’re now trapped on the side of the room with the Wight, and our exit is very much blocked. The Warden, locked in a battle of wills against the Wight, makes us a new deal.\n\n\n“Pass me the scale and I’ll let you through the barrier to safety.”\n\n\nNow we all know that handing over this scale to her means that Tiamat’s summoning to the material plane is going to be accelerated forward tenfold and we just cannot risk that, so we stand out ground. After all, the Wight only gives a damn about her, and not us.\n\n\nHowever…not all of us were so noble in our exploits. Slowly, Serine began to inch closer and closer to the scale and, after realizing that the Wight was too transfixed on The Warden, kicks the scale through the barrier to The Warden. True to her word, she let Serine through, freed Hook and told them they were free to leave.\n\n\nAnd she did.\n\n\nShe looked back at us, shrugged, and said “sorry guys, I did what I came here to do, and I did it. This is no longer my problem.” \n\n\nHook’s only line to us was “sorry lads, but didn’t anyone ever tell you to never trust a pirate?”\n\n\nWith a flick of her wrist, The Warden teleports them back to her ship docked up in our City’s harbor, and they leave.\n\n\nAll of our characters were stunned. Angered. Disappointed. OOC we all knew we were only ever a means to an end for Serine getting her crew, ship and lover back, but in character we’d come to see her as part of the team, and besides Dramina, we’d come to trust her as well. \n\n\nKeth [flew into a rage, punching the wall next to him]( https://media.giphy.com/media/K7JYZtAQKAPLi/giphy.gif).\n\n\nDrache [silently looked at the floor, deeply hurt]( https://media.giphy.com/media/z7j4LWSvmxIys/giphy.gif)\n\nDramina [knew it was going to happen]( https://media.giphy.com/media/Ci3nCVx952lfG/giphy.gif)\n\n\nAnd Dietrich [was silently raging]( https://media.giphy.com/media/AFjfPUJ0mjWJG/giphy.gif)\n\n\nSo now the remaining four were stuck in here, with no exit, as our only bargaining chip was now in the hands of the enemy. We all somewhat accepted that this was probably the end, both IC and OOC.\n\n\nAt this point, I look at my DM and ask “magic can’t penetrate the barrier, but can I cast a spell on the other side as I can see through it?” He nods and says yes, that’s legitimate. I look at the group and say both in and out of character “it’s been a pleasure fighting alongside you guys. But this ends now.”\n\n\nAnd I cast [Hunger of Hagar]( http://engl393-dnd5th.wikia.com/wiki/Hunger_of_Hadar)\n\n\nA small black marble appears behind The Warden, which rapidly expands to a 20ft wide portal to another dimension which began pulling everything towards it. She was immediately frozen from behind and pulled in by the tentacles from the portal, destroying the shield. As the Wight was directly in front of her, he also got sucked in, along with the Scale of Tiamat.\n\n\nIt went to stat rolls. We rolled strength to grab onto something to not be pulled in. Everyone succeeded…except Dietrich. Concentrating on casting the spell, he didn’t have time to grab something and gets pulled towards the portal. \n\n\nKeth reaches out to grab him but fails the dexterity check. Deitrich soars past just missing his hand.\n\n\nDrache passes the dexterity check to grab, but fails the strength check to keep hold of Dietrich.\n\n\nWe’re then down to our last person to grab me. Dramina passes the dex check, only to crit fumble the strength roll. And in that moment, I knew Dietrich was going to die. He closed his eyes and accepted his fate.\n\nAlthough, fate has a funny way of working. A bright light filled the room as a booming voice spoke, and the portal closed, sending Dietrich skidding along the floor into a wall. Apparently, Bahamut wasn’t ready to give up on Dietrich or his fight against the cult. We all just sat there for a few seconds taking everything in; the betrayal, Dietrich’s near death experience, and we all knew then that everything was going to be different now. \n\n\nWe made it back to the city (after freeing the goblins from the last game in a montage) and it finished with us entering the city gates.\n\n\nAdmittedly, I had a heavy decision to make, and I’m still unsure I made the right decision. My DM gave me the choice whether Dietrich lived or died. Whilst the ending was epic, it feels cheap that I god-ex-machina’d my way out of death. On the other hand, I’m really attached to my character, and I feel like his adventure is far from over. Whilst I’m eternally happy he lives to fight another day, I also feel like it’s a huge cop-out.\n\n\nStill, the ending was incredibly emotional for us all. It was heartbreaking when the rogue betrayed us, even more so with how cold it was when we’d given her so much. But it was also sad because this was the Rogue’s last game with us, and she was an amazing player. She was a lying, backstabbing cow and she played true to her character til the very end. I’m going to miss her in the group, as are we all. Had it not been her last session, I have no doubt she’d have found an alternative to the situation, but it was so in character of her, I can’t even be mad. Even if Dietrich will forever hold a vendetta against her.\n\n\nNext week is a more chilled session, which we all need, but after that we’ve been assured that everything is going to the Planes of Hell; so much so, this will be one of those adventures where we look back and laugh.\n\n\nUntil then!

        "text": "Five travelers sit in a circle, listening to the crackle of a fire. None seem sure exactly why they have been drawn here, but they know what to expect: an adventure unlike any other. After a time, the cloaked old man speaks.\n\n“You may be disappointed to learn that\nI brought you here to simply weave a tale,\nAlthough a story of the greatest worth,\nI see it clear you come here craving blood.\nMy tale seeks not to quench this awful thirst;\nA deeper hunger it will satisfy.\nYou will speak most free as I regale,\nBecause you have a part to play here still.\nBut ask me not by how I came to know\nThese things which I regale unto you now:\nAsk yourself just whether you believe\nThe things of which I’ll speak this endless night\nBy end I say that you will come to see\nThat what I speak is nothing but the truth.\nLike any yarn worth spinning this one has\nSome context that I must first lay on down.\nI know not if you know this fact of me,\nBut in truth I was at the war of Hurm.\nI skip, my friends, the details of this fight,\nFor this is not my war story I tell,\nBut one of mankind’s descent into hell.\nYou see, friends, on that fateful night in Hurm\nWe thought ourselves the saviours of Romance\nBut now we see the way the chips have fell\nAnd know that Romance died upon that day.\nFor the prophet of freedom who lead\nUs into battle against IEC\nAnd who for many embodied the soul\nOf Romance, and of light and of the good,\nHimself did fall within the gory fray\nAnd with him all he held as sacred too.\nWithout their symbol, or even their friends,\nFor most did lose one who fought on that day,\nThere was no light within the hearts of men\nAs they made their treks back to their homes.\nAnd so with time that zeitgeist died its death;\nAdventure ceased to be a sacred thing.\nThe monsters of the land redoubled then,\nNot least the army of the blighted worm.\nSome held onto the light and fought up north\nAgainst the plague of mind that is the Blight\nBut even those “blighthunters” soon did fall\nInto a grim and hopeless point of view.\nIt is in this world that we turn our heads\nUnto the forest nation of Ormael\nWhere the rulers had not ruled for years,\nAnd folk did find themselves consumed by fear.\nI tell you that four men were in the town\nKnown to all as Port o’ Conaghy,\nWhich sat upon Ormael’s western coast.\nThe first of these I noticed right away,\nHe travelled ‘mongst a smallish pack of wolves!\nI o’erheard an argument between\nThe local Tavern’s bouncer versus him.\nTo start I recount this to thee because\nIt was then his destiny began.\"\n\nThe cloaked man had reached into his pocket, and produced some kind of powder. This he blows into the fire, which flies up, blinding the travellers. When they can see again, they see a large Orc dressed in furs and tribally decorated armour looking angrily at an unimpressed, much larger Ogrun. Two wolves, one smallish and red, the other massive and white, as well as a two-headed puppy and a queer looking golden lab sat behind the Orc patiently. “I don’t care if they’re your family or the family of the fucking Monarch, there are no animals allowed in the tavern, least of all a goddamn dire wolf!”\n\n\"No no no, you're confused. I'm going into the tavern, and these wolves just go where I go. In my culture...\"\n\n\"You're in Ormael, *Orc*, my culture. The wolves ain't goin' in the tavern, and you're not changing my mind.\"\n\nAra'k-azur thought for a moment. It would be impolite at best to kill this man; he probably thought he was just doing his job. Yes, he hated being without his wolves for so long, but if he was ever going to do what he came here for, he'd have to learn to deal with these sorts of problems the way that he's expected to in such a place.\n\n\"If I leave my wolves outside the bar, down in the courtyard here, I can come in?\"\n\n\"That's all I ask, orc.\"\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\nAra'k-azur nodded his head, turned around, and knelt down. \"Santabane, Skybite, Hotdog, Two Faced Sonofabitch, listen to papa. You need to wait right over there. I'm just going in here for a bit to get some information, and then I'll be right out. Behave, okay? Santabane, you're in charge. I love you.\" He kissed each wolf on the head, and walked into the tavern.\n\n***\n\nIt was the largest tavern he'd ever been in. It may have been one of the smaller in Ormael, but his standards weren't exactly high. There were a couple tables seating only humans, and a couple more of very mixed races. At the bar, two young elves sitting very close together tittered to each other, and a well-built human sat a few stools down.\n\nAra’k-azur sat next to the elves, which seemed to set them a bit on edge. \"Can we help you?\" the nearest one asked. \"I'm looking for a pack of Arcanists. They seem to stick together, and wear dark cloaks with this symbol on it.\" Ara'k-azur produced a drawing of what looks to be an arcane rune. Surely it couldn't be, for producing such an object would be objectionable in the company of strangers, especially when one towers over said strangers as does our orcish friend. Regardless, the elf was visibly uncomfortable. \"Wh- uhh, why do you want to know?\" \n\n\"One of them killed my best friend. Two Faced Bitch.\"\n\n\"What, you trusted the arcanist before?\"\n\n\"Hmm? Oh, no, that's my friend's name. She was an [argus](http://www.beastsofwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Argus.jpg).\"\n\n\"So, what, you want revenge?\"\n\n\"That's right.\"\n\n\"Then sorry, I don't know any.\"\n\nThe orc shrugs. \"Well, thanks anyway.\" He got up to try his luck at another table.\n\nThe barkeep laughed, and looked at the mountainous man at his bar. \"Interesting fellow.\"\n\n\"S'pose.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Now, you going to tell me about this project you've been working on, or what?\"\n\n\"Sorry, Jorge, no can do. Not quite ready yet.\"\n\n\"Come on Ulfbert, I've been the closest thing you've had to a friend ever since you moved here. What's the point if you can't tell me about it?\"\n\n\"Well, it's more about pride. See, when I create a sword, every stage looks totally different. Someone like you would look at it, and think it's going to look one way, without being able to see how it might get there. Then, the more I work on it, the less you'll see that thing. When I finish, with the engravings and flourish and shit that you want, you'll be disappointed if it's the best sword I've ever made. So, really, it'll only be whe-\"\n\n**\"Blighted!? No!\"**\n\nUlfbert turned around on his stool. A young man Ulfbert recognized as being a local was standing, pale as a ghost, in front of the table he'd been talking to. The fellow across from him looked severely agitated. \"Shut *up*, Tave, don't draw attention.\" He was too late, of course, all conversation around the tavern ceased at that first word.\n\nThe barkeep stepped forward. \"What's blighted, Tave?\"\n\n\"Nothin', Jorge, nothin',\" spits out the man who's still sitting. “It’s just me gran, you know, out North o’ here, just wrote me t’day, and her cat’s been hit by the blight is all.” \n\n“Now that’s some horseshit Seth and you know it. Tave, what’s blighted, and don’t be lyin’ to me.”\n\nTave, still standing, was visibly shaken. He looked at his friend Seth, and absentmindedly touched his own arm. Jorge nodded his head and approached the table. \"Show me yer arm Seth.\"\n\n\"It's... nothin', it's, it's the cat,\"\n\n\"Seth. Gimme yer fucken arm.\"\n\nSeth, now weeping softly, removed off his glove, and pulled back his sleeve. \n\n\"Bejeezus, Seth, ye've been hit.\"\n\n\"Aye. Don't kill me, I'm begging you, my wife-\"\n\n\"It's just a matter of time from here, Seth.\" He nods at the Ogrun bouncer, who moves behind the bar. \"Yer father was a dear friend, you know, and I do this as a mercy.\"\n\nA few of the bar's patrons spoke up. Some egging the barkeep on to kill the blighted menace, some begging him to show mercy to the young boy they all know. One person shouted to cut his arm off. This last gave Jorge pause.\n\n\"Would tha' work? Would cutting 'is arm off work, does anyone know? No? Well, does anyone at least know enough medicine t' stop the bleeding after?\"\n\n\"I do.\" Ulfred was behind Seth, with a grave look on his face. \"We have to try cutting off his arm, it's our only hope of saving him and ourselves.\"\n\n“What in Haen’s name are you going around knowing enough medicine to stop a bleedin’ arm fer?”\n\n“That’s not what’s important. Let’s do it.”\n\nGargesh stepped forward, slowly, greataxe in hand. Before he got close enough to Seth, a window shattered inward, as a blighted nyss tumbled in. It rose to its feet before anyone could react, and loosed two arrows into the bar, one striking Gargesh’s arm, the other killing one of the elves. As the now ex-lover started to scream, several nyss followed the first’s lead through other windows, and started their killing.\n\nUlfred was the first to react, and dove over the bar for cover. There he saw an overturned barrel, and removed its top, so that it might act as a shield. Not seeing any weapons behind the bar, he stood up and grabbed the bottle he had almost emptied. Meanwhile, Ara’k-azur grabbed his two axes, and dove at the nearest nyss, killing it immediately. “There’s more outside,” he shouted. “My Winter Wolf is telling me.”\n\n“Let’s just focus on here for now,” called Gargesh, swinging his axe at the empty air previously occupied by a nyss. Others in the bar ran for cover, tried to escape, anything, but nobody banded together to take out the handful of nyss causing this chaos. Fear of the blight was strong, and nobody knew how exactly it spread.\n\nAra’k-azur would not let the weak villagers spell his doom. He dropped his bow, drew his axes, and decapitated the nearest nyss, running towards the next. Ulfred jumped the bar, and broke another’s skull with his bottle, blocking two arrows with the barrel top. Gargesh finally finished one off, and now only a couple remained.\n\nOne nyss jumped out of the window it came in through, but the leader held strong, firing arrow after arrow into the crowd. Ulfred held up his makeshift shield, allowing two arrows to sink into it, and smashed the bottle over the blighted nyss’s head, slashing its throat. The nyss finally falls to the ground. Before the dust settled, Ara’k-azur shot Seth in the leg, just as he gets to the tavern’s door.\n\nSeth stumbled clumsily out into the courtyard below, and Gargesh, Ulfred, and Ara’k-azur followed.\n\n***\n\nKildan trembled, holding his wife at his side. He’d tried to tell everyone the Blight was coming, he’d tried to say they were unprepared for an invasion. Were this back at Draznea, the other dwarves would be rallied and ready years in advance, so the nyss would never bother attacking, and he’d not now be cowering behind these massive dogs clutching his love without a weapon in sight.\n\nOn the plus side, the dogs seemed to be on his side. What’s more, they seemed to be winning.\n\nKildan turned his head, as the old mayor’s boy fell over the rails of the tavern, and the town’s blacksmith, Gargesh, and a queer looking Orc followed him into the courtyard. They looked almost like an adventuring party, and Kildan’s heart leapt in his chest. Perhaps he’d survive after all!\n\nThe Orc sprinted towards the dogs, and helped cut down the Nyss threatening them, while the blacksmith picked up a dead Orc’s spear and started taking out the archers on the hill. A [Raek](http://privateerpress.com/files/products/legion-of-everblight/warbeasts/raek.png) ran into the courtyard, which was frightening indeed, until its path was interrupted by a shrieking cat flying through a window right into it. The Raek killed the cat instantly, but it oddly turned the cat into a pile of bones, frightening Kildan further. Out of the same house, an old woman ran, shouting, “Mittens! No! Oh, he used to be so peaceful.” A teenage girl (and some other things) came out of the house shortly thereafter, and she tried to comfort the old woman briefly before noticing the Raek right next to her. She screamed, and ran back a ways, before casting some dark magic at the Raek.\n\nKildan kept trying to look at... what was fighting the Raek, but every time he did, he lost focus, and found himself looking at the young girl, who was playing a lute, and cheering, uh, something on.\n\nKildan found this all very confusing and even more disconcerting. He was quite disoriented, and hardly noticed the fighting had stopped. Another of the defending Orcs had fallen, but at least the nyss were gone.\n\nA loud horn sounded from the docks. This invasion was far from over. Kildan grabbed his wife and ran for his home as fast as he could. With any luck there’d be time to thank the adventurers later, and if not, then they didn’t deserve his thanks now.\n\n***\n\nJorge came out of the tavern, and grabbed Seth, who hadn’t moved far with his injury.\n\n“Alright, you’re not going anywhere I’m not going. Gargesh, keep the tavern safe. Ulfred, there’d be weapons and armour in your workshop, right?”\n\n“Right.” Ulfred was already thinking about his smithy.\n\n“Then Seth and I are going there. Anyone who wants to help can come too.”\n\n“Then I’m coming,” said Tave. “Seth is my best friend, and I’m not letting anything happen to him.”\n\nThe elf who lost her lover came forward as well. “I- I can use — well, sort of use a bow. I want to help.”\n\nAra’k-azur walked up to Ulfred, with his pack behind him. “This man bends metal? And he can fight with a bottle? Then I follow him.”\n\nThe girl finished pushing the corpse of the old woman who’d been killed by the Raek back into her house, and then spoke up. “Hi! I’m Sillith. You guys seem like fun.”\n\nUlfred and Ara’k-azur exchanged glances and shrugged. “It’s through the marketplace,” said Ulfred. “Let’s go.”\n\n***\n\nFurrio slammed another [grotesque](http://www.gardenninja.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/legion-of-everblight/grotesques.jpg) with his Maul, killing it outright, as the dwarf finished off one of the remaining nyss. The dwarf was starting to grow on him, and he really wanted to save him, but the dwarf was quickly getting surrounded by grotesques, and Furrio was going to have a hard enough time on his own. A [harrier](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse3.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.M9949d4ed36fef1750ab91aa467a38efdo0%26pid%3D15.1&amp;f=1), diving toward him, got struck down by an arrow, and Furrio turned his head to the arrow’s origin.\n\nA group of poorly armed adventurers had come into the marketplace, and were starting to take out the blighted. Some wolves caused alarm for Furrio until he saw that the Orc seemed to be commanding them. The male human skewered a nyss through the chest right beside Furrio, and spoke. “Glad to have an Ogrun like you on our side.”\n\nFurrio knew right away the fight was won, but at the same time it wasn’t over. He pointed at the dwarf. “Save the dwarf,” he shouted. Furrio swung his sword at the grotesque standing between the man and vision of the dwarf, causing it to explode in arcane energy. The man saw the dwarf in trouble, nodded at Furrio, and charged. He killed a grotesque who looked ready to finish the dwarf off, which opened the dwarf up to run away, fast.\n\nFurrio tossed a grotesque to the side, and charged next to the armourless human. They fought back to back for a time, killing all the blighted monsters who came their way. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the other adventurers easily killing the rest of the blighted on their own. By the time he looked back at the last nyss in front of him, the dwarf had charged back into the fray to kill it himself, and spit on its corpse. Before Furrio could even ask his name, the dwarf went to his dead wife’s side, and seemed to ignore everything else around him.\n\n***\n\nFurrio introduced himself to the others, and they to him. The group walked into the smithy, where there was finally some time to discuss the matter of what to do with Seth.\n\n“Ulfred, where’s your sharpest axe?” asked Jorge.\n\nUlfred pointed it out, and went to the back to grab something. Jorge grabbed the axe, and handed it to Furrio. “You fought well back there, you can probably do this.” Jorge explained the situation with the blight, and Furrio nodded his understanding. \n\nTave stepped between Furrio and Seth. “Wait! I won’t let you do it! How do we even know it will work? You could kill him!”\n\nFurrio’s voice took on an entirely new quality. It was hard to describe, but certainly sounded commanding. “*Step aside*.” Tave looked down, and did as he said, continuing to mutter about Seth.\n\nHalfway through Furrio’s axe swing, Sillith spoke up, “that’s not going to wo-ork!”\n\nFurrio followed through, maiming Seth. “What do you mean?” he asked, clearly irritated. \n\n“Blight,” she replied, cheerily. “It’s an affliction of the soul, silly, not the body. You’d have to kill him to really-”\n\nFurrio killed Seth with his maul without a second thought. “Oh. Just say that.”\n\nUlfred stepped back into the room, now fully adorned in absolutely gorgeous armour, and holding a spiked shield. “What in the ungodly realm happened here?”\n\nA roar was heard coming from the marketplace, which was still in view. Some sort of blighted [wyrm](https://www.frontlinegaming.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Seraph.jpg) hovered above the dwarf, still in the marketplace, with a well-adorned nyss riding it.\n\n***\n\nGeldin was more or less unaware of his surroundings. He was dimly aware of the aristeia which had just passed over him, but most of his being was held up in mourning his wife, the orc Melsa. After a loud roar, he heard a voice.\n\nThe voice was probably speaking about some way of bringing Melsa back. It was probably offering him entrance into the legion of blight and blah blah blah, but Geldin didn’t pay attention to that. He’d sooner the voice kill him than see Melsa’s corpse used that way.\n\nHe was relieved to hear a loud crunching noise, a body hitting the ground, and the ceasing of the voice. He turned briefly to see a dead nyss below a dragon, with the ogrun from before standing over her body. A red mist poured up out of the nyss’ corpse, but she was dead now, and so Geldin ignored her. He saw as the party tried to fight the dragon, but it flew off, and breathed many balls of fire onto them, one of them even hurting Geldin.\n\nAnd then he saw the local blacksmith, dressed in beautiful armour, pick up a nyss’ sword from the ground, and chuck it at the dragon. The next thing he saw was the dragon’s severed head hitting the ground, followed by the rest of the dragon.\n\nGeldin thanked the fighters, and went back to his wife.\n\n***\n\nTave went home, having witnessed his best friend die, and Jorge went back to his bar, confident the others could defend the town. Furrio, Sillith, Ulfred, and Ara’k-azur ran to the docks, where the horn had been heard earlier, in the hopes that they could stop the rest of the nyss from reaching the town.\n\nNobody picked up the nyss dragon rider’s bow, so Elia did so now. She was slower than the others going to the docks, so she put her hand on Geldin’s shoulder, hoping to offer comfort (Pir knew she could use some herself), and went back to the tavern to recover her lover’s corpse.\n\n***\n\nIt appeared to be a large sort of raft, with two blighted monsters riding it. It couldn’t possibly be the invasion force.\n\nFurrio looked at the water, and looked at the monsters on the raft. Soon they’d be close enough to charge over land.\n\n“I found a boat,” said Ara’k-azur. “My connection with my pack runs deep, so I can call them to me over great distances. That includes over water. If I row to that raft, I can summon Hot Dog, burn it down, and come back.”\n\nUlfred looked at the tribal orc’s arms, and sighed, knowing that with their very different crafts, he’d become stronger. “I’ll paddle,” he said. “It’ll be faster, and I can protect you once we get there.”\n\n“I wanna come!” said Sillith. “I can distract the monsters, and help you to fight better. Besides, I want to watch you burn down the raft.”\n\n“No, no,” said Ulfred, “the less people on the boat, the less work it is to paddle.”\n\n“Those monsters look strong,” said Ara’k-azur. “She cast some powerful spells earlier, and so did her, uh, wolf.”\n\nFurrio looked at the water, and looked at the monsters on the raft. They were getting closer.\n\n“Oh, Snowball’s not a wolf,” said Sillith, petting whatever monstrous quadruped was beside her. “Snowball’s my dad’s seeing-eye-cat.”\n\n“And your dad is... where?”\n\n“He’s right here!” Sillith pointed a the other thing that was beside her, which was human height. It was hard to make out what either of these things were, as the eye tended to wander back to Sillith whenever one tried to look at or think about them. The quadruped was certainly no cat, in any case; it was longer than Sillith was tall.\n\n“Oh, uh, sorry,” said Ulfred. “What’s your name?”\n\nFurrio looked at the water, and looked at the monsters on the raft. Almost there...\n\n“He doesn’t talk,” said Sillith. “He’s a deaf blind dumb mute. He’s a great fighter though!”\n\nUlfred looked skeptical, but Ara’k-azur just shrugged. “I have met such a warrior before. A shaman like myself, his mind was connected deeply with the Keph. His eyes functioned not, but he saw all. It is an honour to meet you, sir.” Ara’k-azur shook the thing’s hand. It was remarkably bony.\n\nFurrio let out a mighty roar, and charged across the water, slamming his maul into one of the monsters.\n\n“What in Haen’s name?” said Ulfred.\n\n“Mighty-hammer just charged! Get in the boat!” said Ara’k-azur.\n\nThe party piled into the dinghy, and paddled to the nesraft.\n\n***\n\nUlfred slammed his shield into the other monster, pushing it into the water. Good, looked like these things couldn’t swim.\n\nA hatch swung open in the middle of the nesraft. Several nyss climbed up out of it, and the group caught a glimpse of how deep the structure went under the water. They also caught a glimpse of the hundred or so nyss waiting inside, armed. “My plan now,” said Ara’k-azur.\n\nThe orc placed his hand in the air, flush to the ground at waist height, a couple feet to his left. “Hot Dog.” His hellhound appeared just below his hand, seemingly unsurprised by its sudden transportation. It breathed fire into the hole until something caught flame, and the group piled back into the dinghy. Furrio jumped not into, but onto the water, and ran back to the shore, as Ara’k-azur paddled. The nyss, catching flame, fired a few arrows at the fleeing adventurers, but couldn’t hit one.\n\nNyss were very weak to fire. Nesrafts were insulated from fire and water on the outside getting in. But their insides were made of wood. Wood was very weak to fire.\n\nAnd thus the invasion of Conaghy was foiled.\n\n***\n\nThe fighters all sat around a table in Jorge’s tavern. It was free drinks for anyone who had killed something blighted for the rest of the day.\n\nAra’k-azur, and Geldin properly introduced themselves to the others. Ara’k-azur was an orcish shaman from the jungles of Rafflesia, who had arrived in Conaghy by chasing a band of arcanists on whom he seeked revenge. Geldin was a dwarf who’d grown up in Conaghy, and been trained in the ways of warfare by his father. He married the orc he’d been in love with since he was a tween, which was some thirty years ago, and now he intended to get revenge on the army that had done this, for as long as he could.\n\nFurrio said that he’d been cast out by his kind, and now he was roaming the land, using his impressive military skills wherever they were needed. Ulfred said that he’d lived in Conaghy for ten years, as the blacksmith. When asked about his ability to fight, and his gorgeous armour, he simply said he’d been a blacksmith for a long time.\n\nSillith said that she was adventuring with her warrior father. Pressed further, she said that she was very interested in being a bard and using magic, and that her parents didn’t really approve. She was happy to go wherever the most action would be.\n\nThat left Elia. Rather than speak about herself, she addressed Ara’k-azur.\n\n“Why do you want to find these arcanists?”\n\n“Have you ever lost someone you loved?”\n\nElia was speechless. She was still reeling from watching her lover fall to a nyss arrow hours ago. Ara’k-azur continued.\n\n“Someone you really cared about? Truly loved? No?”\n\n“You... you were there when...”\n\nAra’k-azur suddenly realized what he’d done. “Oh, oh I am so sorry. I forgot.”\n\n“It’s okay.” Elia was crying now.\n\n“Well, uh, those arcanists killed my dog, two-faced bitch. And I want revenge. My tribe use shaman powers, and the arcanists didn’t like that, so they tried to kill us. We fought back strong though. They fled. Came here.”\n\n“They’re here because they want to kill the Blight Worm.”\n\nThis was a surprise to everyone except Ara’k-azur. To him it was meaningless.\n\n“I don’t know what a blight wyrm is, but I’m guessing it’s one of those dragons we killed earlier?”\n\nElia cleared her throat, but before she could get composure, Jorge stepped forward and spoke.\n\n“The Blight Worm’s what you’ve been fighting all day. It’s a demigod of awesome power, that can force anything to submit to its will. It first showed up in north Jiylnae, where the drow come from. ‘fore anyone went to help, the Worm blighted the lot of them, and only a few unblighted drow still exist throughout all of Kephrea. We call the blighted drow ‘nyss,’ because some idjit thought they were a different thing, and nowadays nobody calls drow by their true name. It’s forces grow stronger every day, and soon this whole continent will be overrun. Egalitaria to the north is the only ‘nation’ that can deal with them at all, and they’re still slowly falling to the constant invasions. We’re practically in Egalitaria, so it’s surprising this was the first invasion we’ve had. But they’re moving south, tha’s the point.”\n\nAra’k-azur finished his ale. “So one of these blight worm nysses is being tracked by these arcanists? I don’t care a bit. I just want revenge.”\n\n“Well,” said Elia, “I know where the arcanists are. My lover, her father is one of them. We were going to visit him, that’s what this vacation was for, we didn’t know the first thing about the blight. We thought it was just another monster. And now it’s - it’s killed her...”\n\nElia stopped for a moment. Nobody said a word. Finally, she spoke again.\n\n“I’m going to go find them. They should be in Donaghy. I was going to go there by boat, it’s four days away, but now I think I’ll have to walk. Nobody will be leaving Conaghy by boat until they’re recovered.”\n\nFurrio spoke. “Well this blight business sure is a problem. I know of an army, the Emerald Watch, who-”\n\n“The emerald watch are a bunch o’ idiots,” said Geldin. “You know they assign leadership by seniority, aye?”\n\n“All the better!” said Furrio. “We can take them over, and lead them into battle against this Worm. I say, we gather them, find these arcanists, and all storm it together. Who’s with me?”\n\nAra’k-azur nods. “You’re a good companion to have, Mighty-hammer. This area is dangerous it seems, and I’ll take a detour if you’re going to the arcanists anyway. Metal-bender, what of you?”\n\nUlfred shrugged. “Well I’m sure not doing anything with the Watch.”\n\n“Oh, I oughtta mention,” said Jorge, “that there’s a place you should check out not far from here. I’ve been waiting to tell some adventurers about it, but not many pass through here. The ancient Aurorans, the first settlers o’ this continent, used to live there, and it’s all ruins now. I heard tell of some large figures walkin’ ‘round the place, and of some glowing green rocks. Sounds like the sort of thing for a new group of adventurers to take on before starting an adventure, eh?”\n\nUlfred sighed, “I’d go there if you guys do. I could use a break from smithing, and that sounds more interesting and easy than dealing with the Watch. In any case, I’m not enlisting in a military or adventuring company, so I’m out as soon as you do that.”\n\n“We need only command them, there will be no orders for us,” said Furrio. “But we’ll talk about that when we come to it. For tomorrow, we ride to these ruins!

We ride out tomorrow!”",

        "text": "This tale will involve spoilers for the Lost Mine of Phandelver starter campaign so read no further if you intend to play it. There are no spoilers for my players here, you guys can read if you want.\n\nI am DMing the LMoP campaign with a group of friends. We are all new to the game (no one has played more than 2 sessions before) but most of us had an interest in D&amp;D for a while. The players used the pregen characters, so the party consisted of: Eugene (LN human noble fighter), Johagan (LG human folk hero fighter), Thoradin (NG dwarf soldier cleric, cousin of the Rockseekers), Roscoe (TN halfling criminal rogue) and Euronymus (CG elf acolyte wizard). I say consisted because this adventure did not go smoothly.\n\nFirst session the party has been ambushed by goblins and tracked them back to thier lair. As they enter they hear the snarling of wolves and go to check it out. They deal with the wolves and notice a small chute leading upwards, with rubbish at the bottom. Euronymus decides to climb it alone and, after falling once, makes it to the top. There he finds a bugbear, a wolf, two goblins and a pile of treasure, so of course he decides to sneak towards the treasure and rifle through it. One unconscious Euronymus later, the party are climbing up the tunnel in a desperate rescue attempt. All except Roscoe that is, but I'll get to that later. The party manage to defeat the enemies in the chamber, but not before Euronymus succumbs to his injuries and bleeds out. As they are mourning Euronymus and planning their exit, they hear the sounds of combat and realise Roscoe is not with them. Running into the next room they find an unconscious Roscoe surrounded by 3 goblins. Fortunately this fight is easy and the party manage to save their rogue. Sister Garaele in Phandalin agreed to resurrect Euronymus and they returned the next day to rescue Sildar. This went mostly without incident, though Eugene's ego took a hit when a goblin beat him in a strength contest and threw him in the river.\n\nThe next two sessions were spent finding and dealing with the Redbrands. During this, Johagan and Roscoe had a pretty bad falling out. Johagan had interrogated a redbrand and decided to leave him alive, restrained and in a barrel. As they turned to leave however, Roscoe snuck behind the party, lifted the lid of the barrel, slit the redbrand's throat and then quietly replaced the lid. When Roscoe let this slip in conversation later it led to a lot of fist fights between the two.\n\nAlso of note is Dave, the bartender of the Sleeping Giant. He had been kept there against his will by the redbrands, serving them free food and ale. When the players killed some redbrands outside, they stuck around to rest and protect Dave. While there they encountered another patrol and killed them too. They then retreated to the Stonehill Inn for an undisturbed rest and found Dave the next morning hanging from the outside of the tavern and missing a few fingers. Later they would walk past his grieving wife and daughter, which seemed to really affect the players emotionally. As a DM, that was a cool moment.\n\nWhilst in the redbrands' base, Euronymus brutally murdered the cowering goblin Droop, shifting his alignment to CN. Also Glasstaff escaped.\n\nSession 4 lead the party out on the Triboar Trail, headed first to get from information from the banshee Agatha. This went surprisingly without incident, though Euronymus did speak about robbing Agatha's house in her presence. Fortunately the party decided against it. They left to investigate Old Owl Well, where a wizard and some undead had reportedly been seen. The wizard started talking to them until, mid-conversation, Johagan decided to rugby tackle this guy but lost the strength contest, instead getting thrown to the ground. Roscoe then moved in for a stab, but missed as the wizard misty stepped behind wall of zombies that had just appeared. The party retreated briefly to rest and formulate a plan. Oh what a plan it was: Eugene would walk up to the wizard and lure him into the open, lying about finding information from Agatha for him. As this happened, Roscoe would sneak up and kill him somehow.\n\nWhat the party actually found was a wall of zombies standing guard with a bright light spell above them. Undeterred, the party proceeded with the plan. The bluff failed horribly and Eugene and Roscoe fell unconscious during the first round of combat, dying before the rest of the party could help them. Somehow the others made it through the combat and, with a rare stroke of brilliance from Euronymus, kept the bodies frozen with rays of frost long enough to get to Phandalin.\n\nSession 5 began with Eugene and Roscoe awakening in the Shrine of Luck, Sister Garaele standing over them performing a ritual. For the rest of the campaign the two had horrible scarring all over their bodies, giving them advantage on intimidation but disadvantage on all other social checks. They walked around with hoods up after that. Cragmaw Castle was next of the list and was cleared with surprising efficiency. The party managed to clean up all the goblins and rescue Gundren. Euronymus even went without a short rest to scrub the floor of his newly recovered shrine to his god Oghma, and getting a well-earned inspiration point for it. They made it back to Phandalin where Gundren and Sildar briefed them on Wave Echo Cave and the Forge of Spells. The party then made final preparations.\n\nSession 6 was the assault on Wave Echo Cave. Upon arriving, the party saw the corpse of Tharden, Thoradin's cousin. This was all the motivation the party needed, they were out for blood. By pure chance, the party found the most direct route to Nezznar, the Black Spider (BBEG of this campaign). Having had only minimal combat, the party was in good spirits. They didn't account for one thing though; their DM playing an intelligent BBEG. 4 spiders were trying (badly) to hide behind columns in this room and managed to encase Roscoe in web in the first round, though accomplished little else. Nezznar then appeared to the party, carrying an apparently unconscious Nundro Rockseeker (another one of Thoradin's cousins). He mocked the party briefly before Thoradin charged at him, getting knocked unconscious and paralysed on the way by the spiders. The three remaining party members were clearly shaken by this, so Nezznar offered them safe retreat if they agreed not to return.\n\nThe party took the bait and, with Roscoe, Tharden and Nundro being carried by the other three, followed a giant spider towards the exit. On the way they were ambushed by 5 bugbears, suddenly outnumbered two to one as the spider also turned to attack. Eugene fell quickly and Euronymus followed shortly after. This entire time Roscoe had been failing his strength checks to break free of the web, so was being dragged by Johagan. Johagan fed Nundro a potion before grabbing him and running for the exit, leaving the rest of his party behind. It was then that Nundro shifted into his true form; a doppelganger. It attacked Johagan who now dropped both characters he was carrying and ran for his life, narrowly making it out.\n\nJohagan made it safely back to Phandalin and recounted his story to Gundren and Sildar before I wrapped the session. I told the other players how they all awoke in a small room alongside Nundro (the real one), all gagged and bound. That was the last they knew of their fates. Many theories were thrown around of what was going to happen, but only I knew for sure (well a bit, I still had a week to plan it fully).\n\nSession 7 was the beginning of the final assault on Nezznar, with everyone creating new level 5 characters (except for Johagan, he returned). I gave Nezznar a week to prepare his defences, so the cave changed a little. It turns out I'm a crafty and somewhat evil DM, probably CE. My players now love/hate me intensely. Much has happened and the game will conclude, one way or another, this Sunday. I'll gladly post it if there is any interest.",

Turns out whatever Shadow Creature had been doing this had been putting other machinations in motion. And our group had been contacted by the Hydelin (Yes, this heavily based on the Final Fantasy series) and told that we were the Heroes of Light blessed by her to stop the Calalmity. Which is what this Shadow creature desire. We are granted these small gems which denote our position. The party agrees to keep this a secret for now. anyway we start this adventure  on the trail to help out a village who has requested some assistance against some werewolves. On our way we discover that the village has begun hanging people based on paranoia. Now at this point the party has begun the debate of what to do. with the bodies. Part of the group wants to cut them down and bury them. Another part wants to simply pass them by, we are on kind of a schedule. \n\nSunflower sits in the back. Puffing on some herb until finally he says. \"Why don't we just cut them down, set them on the side of the road and let their bodies be eaten by forest creatures. I mean that's what they're gonna do anyway. Why make em work for it by burying them?\" the party looks at Sunflower in shock before Ozack the Monk finally says \" I can't believe I'm saying this but the stoner has a point.\" So we cut them down and leave them to be eaten. Y'know, circle of life and all that.\n\nThat night we are attacked by a pair of werewolves which we soon disable and capture. The rest of the party says we should take these people to village. they are sick and need cured. Sunflower objects vehemently: \"These things are abominations man, I think we should kill em man.\" But he's overruled.\n\nSo we find the town and spend the remainder of the day gathering info. turns out the 2 werewolves we captured were villagers who had been there since they were kids. So the original werewolf must still be out there. As we bed down for the night. Disaster strikes when the 2 werewolves turn back into their feral forms and start ransacking the town. killing more villagers. We subdue them *again*. But this time the villagers want them dead. The party, of course, won't have that. So they begin arguing. Sunflower sits off to the side puffing on his herb, getting more and more annoyed Till finally he stands up and says: \"Guys I got this, so he walks over to the 2 captives and takes out his knife and hamstrings them both. He then goes back to puffing his herb. \"The villagers and the party are horrified. \n\"Problem solved. Just lock em up. They can barely move. Besides if the people in Juno can fix werewolf curses. They can probably fix that. I dunno, I'm not a healer.\" Neither the villagers nor the party is particularly happy about but they agree to watch them while we go off and hunt the werewolf.\"\n\nWe eventually find and kill him. And return to the villagers who have been as good as their word and locked the two werewolves locked up. But we have another problem. The werewolves need to be transported back to Juno and while they are still crippled they are still dangerous. So we decide to grab a wagon, which the town is happy to loan us, but we need someone to keep the werewolves docile. And guess who has handle animal? So now Sunflower, who has wanted to kill these 2 since the start, now has to keep them docile in a covered wagon all the way back to Juno. The party makes it way back to Juno with a covered wagon. Inside of which Sunflower is hotboxing it with two werewolves he wants dead. And he's burning his precious herb to keep them docile. So by the time they reach Juno. Sunflower is livid. \n\nNow the guards at Juno, being the ever diligent guards that they are. Are very curious about this wagon that is smoking out the back so much that it looks like it's on fire. And are very curious to know what's in it. \n\nThe party, fearful that they won't allow these werewolves in to be cured. Tries to cover up the fact they are transporting dangerous magical creatures in to the city.\n\nEventually the guards decide to call in their commander. Athena. A very stern, and cold woman. She tells the guards to restrain the party while she opens up the wagon. As she pulls back the canvas she sees 2 very dangerous looking were wolves. Smoke so dense she's getting a contact high just looking inside. And a very angry dirty, nearly naked man who looks at her and shouts \"WHAT! NEVER SEEN A NAKED MAN CHILLING WITH WEREWOLVES BEFORE!\"\n\nShe hauls him out, and our ruse is discovered. She has very stern words for all of us. Except now Sunflower is grinning like an idiot. \nShe eventually allows us through. Albeit with an armed guard.\n\nSunflower looks over at Ozack and says \"I think she's the one.\"\n\"Dude, I think she hates you.\"\n\"Yeah, that's how I know she's the one.\"\n\nI will get to the final chapter of Sunflower sometime in the next couple of days.",

        "text": "Character creation is one of my favorite parts of playing RPGs, so I was pretty disappointed when my DM killed off The Incredible Tomlin, my most recent D&amp;D 5e character, after the very first session.  He was a stout halfling fighter with a background in the circus, where his routine included juggling, knife throwing, fire eating, and playing the [oud.](https://www.google.com/search?q=oud&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiL-q_Vg5rPAhVS9WMKHd8jA84Q_AUICSgC&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=612)  He married a halfling acrobat named Evangeline, and they lived a happy and carefree life for many years, performing nightly in Mr. Peabody's Traveling Menagerie.  One night after a performance, a band of gnolls set fire to the circus and burned it to the ground.  Evangeline died in the blaze, trapped beneath a collapsed circus tent and either suffocating or burning alive before anyone could reach her.  The Incredible Tomlin quit the circus the very next day, taking up the path of the fighter and honing his knife throwing skills for the day he could track down the arsonist gnolls that murdered his wife.\n\nEnter the party, which in addition to The Incredible Tomlin included a halfling bard stripper named Portia, a half-orc cleric named Seht, and a human ranger named Kinskade.  The adventurers met on a caravan across a vast desert region to the city of Cazadora, principle in the region.  Upon arriving in the city, The Incredible Tomlin set off to the theater district to grab a drink and gather information on any local bands of gnolls, the rest of the party in tow.\n\nWe stopped at The Wet Bitch, a crowded tavern in the heart of the theater district, and ordered a round.  The Incredible Tomlin subtly inquired as to whether there had been any issues with gnolls in the area.  We were informed by the barkeep, a buxom lass with the voice of a 60-year-old smoker, that any such matters would be handled by the local Mercenaries Guild, so after finishing our drinks we set off to investigate.\n\nThe Mercenaries Guild turned out to be incredibly easy to join:  we each paid a membership fee of one gold coin, which granted us permission to take on jobs from a community message board where local citizens could request anything from menial labor and odd jobs to vigilante justice.  A quick scan of the message board revealed a posting for a local stable owner who rented out horses and camels.  His livestock had recently fallen prey to a group of thieving gnolls from somewhere outside of town, and he offered 10 gold or his finest camel for the leader's head.  Hoping to get some information at the very least, if not a camel to boot, the party rested at the Wet Bitch for the night before heading out after the gnoll bandits.\n\nAfter a hot day's trek through the desert and a restful night's sleep under the stars, our heroes came to the foothills of a great mountain range.  We'd purchased a map in Cazadora, which we used to locate a well-known cave that the stable owner had told us the gnolls might be hiding in.  Sure enough, as we approached, three gnolls rushed out at us to try to drive us away.  We took them on, killing two fairly easily and wounding the third before he turned tail and retreated into the cave.  The cleric, Seht, attempted to chase him down and tackle him to no avail, but we decided to pursue anyway, knowing full well that we had lost any element of surprise.\n\nDeeper in the cave, we tracked the wounded gnoll to a den where he had regrouped with the rest of his pack - three other warriors and their chief.  The combat was fierce and bloody, and the odds were ultimately stacked against us.  Kinskade's bow string broke (our DM's ruling for rolling consecutive natural 1's), and Seht seemed unable to land a hit.  The Incredible Tomlin was eventually knocked unconscious, at which point the coward Kinskade fled the battle, leaving Seht and Portia alone to deal with the gnolls.  They were knocked unconscious in turn, but not before The Incredible Tomlin came to and used his Second Wind ability to gain back a few precious HP.  Largely ignored by the gnolls, he began creeping silently towards the exit, but due to a few poor rolls was discovered.  He jumped up and sprinted out of the cave, the two remaining gnolls hot on his heels.  Knowing he couldn't outrun them with his stubby little halfling legs, The Incredible Tomlin stopped to pick up a few smooth stones, and with a truly lucky performance check halted the charging gnolls in their tracks with a feat of juggling.\n\nIn the meantime, Portia and Seht came to back in the gnolls den.  Finding themselves alone, they tried to sneak out of the cave, but unavoidably came up behind the gnolls, who were still standing in awe of The Incredible Tomlin's amazing juggling skills.  Seht took the opportunity to give one a good crack on the head with a quarterstaff before all three adventurers fled from the cave to regroup and lick their wounds.  We found Kinskade out in the desert, and chastised him mercilessly for abandoning us.  It was agreed that the following day we would return to finish the job, for better or for worse.\n\nDetermined not to make the same mistakes as before, we approached the cave in near-perfect silence, hoping to take the gnolls unawares in their den.  Unfortunately, Portia couldn't keep her damn mouth shut, and we found the gnoll leader waiting for us in his den with fresh recruits.  Following another fierce bout of fighting, Seht and Portia were again knocked unconscious, and the bastard Kinskade again fled the scene.  The Incredible Tomlin, met with insurmountable odds, gave it his all to the bitter end, and eventually fell beneath the gnoll chieftain's own hand, never even knowing if the gnolls he'd given his life to destroy were the same that had taken his beloved Evangeline away.",

Plundering trade routes and making deals with dragons isn't any kind of life for normal folk.”\n\nThe patrons of the Hogshead Tavern seemed mostly bemused by the drunk halfling before them. The bartender a stout dwarf listened intently, glad the tall tales of the short man; for halflings are considered short even by the standards of the average dwarf, seemed to keep the usually rowdy bar quiet. The halfling finished his drink and continued, motioning for another cask to be opened for his new friends.\n\n“I of course am not normal folk.” The drunken stupor that clouded his eyes seemed to lift and a wry grin grew along his thin lips. “I am Pirate Lord, Welby Lowcloud. Captain of the Dear Spectre and this is my first mate, Thogar Valleyshot.”\n\nThe dwarf had stopped refilling drinks, the patrons chatter silenced. Raucous laughter barked out of the fine establishment and onto the cold cobble outside. “A halfling pirate!” A glass slipped from his hand as the bartender bellowed in laughter. Nobody heard the glass shatter, as at that moment the aforementioned compatriot to our noble lead, charged through the thick oaken door. Welby drew his rapier, as a shot from Thogar’s flintlock pistol sent splinters of wood flying into the bearskin rug. A small gnome roughly hit the floor as his stool leg shattered. Thogar stooped down and shrugged. “Sorry little fella, I didn't mean to fire.” The gnomes eyes went wide as the mouth, full of carnivorous teeth reminded him of his grandmother's tales about the mountain dwellers.\n\nThe large lumbering frame of the Goliath moved throughout the maze of tables and chairs. Deftly plucking anything of value from the patrons, he placed the items into a small satchel, it was inconceivable that so many riches could fall into this bag without any kind of fight. Yet the tales of the Dear Spectre had frozen everyone in place. Not through the arcane, but reputation. Thogar's abruptly stopped, moved a piece on a game board, then smiled. “Checkmate.” As Welby and Thogar swept out of the tavern, they broke out into a fast run. Welby had, as usual, neglected to tell part of the story. The Dear Spectre had been subject to a mutiny, Welby had no ship, and his Lordship coveted nothing but his rightful return to power.",

        "text": "Today, I played my first session of Pathfinder. I've watched a lot of play on live streams and I read the roleplay game subs often. But I never really knew what it was like to get into it.\n\nMy DM started everybody at level five. I'm a female Dwarf fighter named Roshanak, a young noblewoman who ran away from home to become an adventurer. My companions are a Paladin and a white-haired witch. We all came to the town because of rumours of disappearances. We're drinking at the inn, when all of the sudden, some fey start sneaking around. \n\nMy first initiative roll is a nat 20, but I'm drunk inside the inn so I don't notice. The fight is over almost as soon as I finally get out there. The bodies of the Fey retreat back to the Feywild, and all they leave behind is a clue pointing towards a cave out in the woods.\n\nWe go to the cave, and are attacked out of a pond by a fucking shambling mound. It grabs me, I fail my strength check to break free the times in a row, get pulled under the water, and get knocked out and start drowning. That's my first KO.\n\nLuckily, my companions take out the shambling mound and resuscitate me. We head into the cave, and find a bunch of dead goblins. I head deeper into the cave and find a bunch of feral goblins eating one of their own. I smash a few of them, and one of them claws the shit out of me and knocks me out. KO 2.\n\nMy friends take out the feral goblins and wake me up again. Searching through the loot, I find a fancy new warhammer of cold. \n\nWe set up camp in the cave, and halfway through the long rest, we meet the rest of the goblins who called the cave home. They shoot me with arrows, take *my* warhammer, and run away. I chase them, and they shoot me with more arrows. My paladin buddy chases them and gets my hammer back. I thoroughly establish that I hate goblins.\n\nWe finish the rest and realize that this is not only the wroge cave, we went completely the wrong direction. We get to the real cave, and there are 6 scarecrows guarding it. We take out the scarecrows no problem, but when they're all dead they all explode. Even with making 4 of the six saving throws, it's 35 damage. KO 3. \n\nThe wake me up again, and discover the back of the cave is submerged. I swim through, and find more cave. It splits in two directions. One of them has a door at the end. Behind the door is a pig, a rug with a portable hole in it, and a headband of ogre intelligence.\n\nWe put the headband on the pig, and he joins the party. I name him Ruth. We head back up the tunnel, and discover that the path is blocked by a pit we can't see the bottom of. \n\nI hatch a plan. The other three climb into the portable hole, and I climb across the pit carrying the hole.\n\nI fail the check. I start falling, and reflex to throw myself into the portable hole before we hit the bottom. I only mostly get in, and take 20 feet of falling damage and break my leg. KO 4. \n\nThe others are expelled from the hole when it smashes on the bottom of the pit, and take no damage. They wake me up again. The bottom of the pit is a single room with a crack in the wall big enough to crawl through. We go through the crack, and on the other side is a pool of water and a nymph. The Nymph tells us that the pool is a pool of rebirth. She doesn't tell us what it does.\n\nMy leg is broken, and I've been between 10 and -10 health all game, so i figure, \"what's the worst that could happen\". I climb in, and it immediately kills me (KO 5), and then casts Reincarnate on me. DM rolls 100, so he gets to chose what I am reincarnated as.\n\nI get turned into a goblin. I spend 20 minutes completely re-writing my character sheet to change myself from a dwarf into a goblin. I lose 1 foot of height and 100 pounds, but my stats are actually pretty okay.\n\nThe nymph goes crazy and tries to kill us. we each land a hit, but Ruth crits her head and she goes down.\n\nAfter some deliberation, we decide that Ruth should go into the pool. He comes out human man, but still with only ogre intelligence. We get out of there, and and leave the cave to head back to town and get Ruth some clothes. \n\nThe town is completely abandoned when we get back. We \"borrow\" some armor from the missing blacksmith, and give it to Ruth. We explore the town, and when we get to the temple, Ruth suddenly starts acting like a pig again. I notice he picked up a rock, and the witch recognises it as a charm of remove curse.\n\nThe \"curse\"  removed in this case being the ogre intelligence charm on the headband making Ruth smart.\n\nThe session ends there. We started with a paladin, a Witch, and a Dwarf. We ended the same session with a Paladin, a Witch, a Goblin who hates her own body and almost died 4 times that day (and did die once), and a man with the mind of a pig.\n\nSo it went great, I think.",

I gave the team a fairly straight forward mission infiltrate, subdue, and extract a gang leader from the Redmond Barrens. They do their leg work and find the gangs HQ a fenced in dilapidated apartment building with a BTL den in the basement and quarters for the gang on the other floors. They get in with the mage killing the low powered one in the gang on the astral and creates a magical physical barrier that the team slides across narrowly avoiding falling 4 stories and not being spotted. Long story short they take down the ladder get him to the roof with the rest of the gang closing on their heels. The mage had to abandon her hiding spot for various reasons and has to create smite physical barrier only just passing the logic roll to lessen the angle to not send them careening to their deaths on a frictionless slide down 4 floors ( player didn't mention so he had to roll for it) one of the runners was an adrenaline junkie with a big helping if extreme sports fanatic. He decides to make sure the payday gets to the bottom by laying his unconscious form down climbing on his chest and surfing his way to the ground. Dispite my best efforts to show him the error of his ways (-7 dice to his pool) he passes with just enough successes to grind his way down on an ork about twice his size full of metal.",

        "text": "I was gming a game of WFRP 2E a month ago, and have several players that have been kidnapped by chaos cultists and are to be sacrificed with some warpstone to cause a greater demon to be summoned.\n\nThe other players trying to prevent the ritual decide to focus the main mage as a way to stop it. Upon getting close to death the mage grabs his bodyguards and all sacrifice themselves in order to have a lesser daemon still rise from this fumbled sacrifice attempt.\n\nThe players all scramble away except our dwarf who *tackles* it and almost dies doing so. This act gave some courage to the party and they decide to go all in on the fight barely destroying the daemon before it destroyed any of them.\n\nNow here's where the twist happens: Daemons in Warhammer are immortal in the human realms, they just return to the chaos realm to work as slaves for a new body essentially. So as the spirit rips a portal open our mage who has decided he want's to learn chaos magic after seeing its power dives in.\n\nI state right then and there that this is pretty much an assured death since no one else is gonna logically follow him, but the other players (who have only just met this mage) decide to follow him regardless of their characters rationality for the situation.\n\nSo now they're trudging the chaos realms, which is an awesome setting, but I'm very torn on it for the characters really have no business there.\n\nI'm vehemently opposed to railroading so when they unanimously decided to go there I of course let them, but I just don't know how to provoke good RP now that they're there by choice when none of them would have wanted to be.",

        "text": "I’ve been running a homebrew campaign for about three years now. Amazingly despite all I’ve thrown at my six player characters they’ve all survived. Well, kinda. They did spend six months searching the halls of hell for one party member. Throughout the three years, both in and out of game two of the party fell in love. This brings me to one week ago.\n\nThe party, consisting of a Pirate Bard, Goliath Gunslinger, Tiefling Fighter, Gnomish Paladin and our two star-crossed lovers; Yesdove the Druidic Ranger and Sinhan Boorahasin the Khajiit Rogue. Yesdove and Sinhan, out of game, met at the table in the first session. Sitting next to each other, Sinhan taught Yesdove how to play. The party has slowly been fighting their way up to a keep, which guards the main trading river in the realm. As the party finally face BBEG, I switch from helpful DM to destroyer of proposals, accidently. The party is slowly losing, all the major spells have been used and HP is super low. It dawns on me, this might be a TPK. As a final act of love, Sinhan tries to teleport Yesdove out of the keep. He was going to propose in and out of game after they beat BBEG. Oops. Sinhan opens his mouth to tell her he loves her, then propose. BBEG casts silence. Again, oops.Yesdove rushes forwards on her dire wolf steed, BBEG casts disintegrate. The wolf dies a death worthy of a Tarantino film. Yesdove clatters to the floor, prone. BBEG beheads her with a natural twenty, her dex save being a natural one. Oops. \n\nOne by one the party falls, in a cruel twist of fate silently suffering Sinhan is the last to fall. BBEG crouches over the quivering mass of the once brave rouge. Dagger, Dagger. Sinhan rolls a natural one. BBEG crushes his lithe form. Oops. At this point we are floating in a sea of abject misery as the players are all in tears at the culmination of three year's story. With the death of her wolf and character Yesdove is distraught. It’s safe to say this is no longer a great place for a proposal. \n\nSo, skip to yesterday. We have our first session back, everyone has new level one characters and is sat round the table. Sinhan asks Yesdove to roll for perception, somewhat confused she rolls. As she watches the dice fall, he drops to one knee and proposes. Despite the 19 rolled, she did not expect it. She said yes. Sinhan then explains to the party how he had wanted to propose last week. However I killed them all, and his hopes of getting engaged. Oops.\n\nThe wedding is next year, I hope the bards are good.\n",

        "text": "**Day 30, Tarsakh, 1489DR**\n\nA week after the incident at Sokol Keep all seems calm for now though the shortage of Blackfist Guards on patrol is noticeable. Gidyan's mentor Rillo Leadstopper approaches him in a frazzle. It seems a shipment of rare ingredients he receives once a week from the nearby town of Falcon's Hollow is late. He asks Gidyan to travel to Falcon's Hollow and check on the status of the delivery and if it's ready, ship it back. \n\n\"Look for the local apothecary, her name us Laurel.\" says Leadstopper before he sends Gidyan on his way.\n\nGidyan relays his mentor's request to his companions. \n\n\"Are we getting paid?\" asks Zing\n\n\"Err... paid? We're adventurers! Let's go adventure! What else we going to do in Phlan?!\" replies Gidyan.\n\n\"Fine. We should discuss getting paid in future though.\" adds Grimgar.\n\nThe whole party set of with Horace and the cart in tow but minus Mitch. It should take two days to reach Falcon's Hollow.\n\n**Day 31, Mirtul, 1489DR**\n\nOn the first night ever camping outside Grimgar and Zing spot a pair of eyes watching them from a distance. After a while the eyes go away.\nOne Gidyan's shift he sees the same pair of eyes and they start to get closer. He rouses Bittersweet from his inebriated slumber and the casts sleep where the pair of eyes sit.\n\nThey fall to the grass and close. The two guards rush up and discover a giant weasel, longer than Gidyan is tall. They bicker about what to do with it. Finally, Bittersweet raps it in a blanket and tells Gidyan to go grab some rope.\n\nWhile he does that the giant weasel wakes up and starts to squirm out of the blanket. Bittersweet tries to wrestle it but it proves slippery as a weasel (pun intended) and gets out, turning on its tiefling captor and sinking it sharp teeth into his arm. He screams in pain waking his comrades, except Zing who sleeps and snores on.\n\nGidyan tags the giant weasel with a ray of sickness and it releases its hold on Bittersweet's arms, then throws up on it. Annoyed the exiled monk bashes its head in with a swift punch.\n\nThe party discuss skinning the animal but now one knows how so they hang its carcass on a tree away from camp.\n\n**Day 32, Mirtul, 1489DR**\n\nThe next morning, they toss the carcass into a sack, then into the cart and head off.\n\nThe party reach Falcon's Hollow, it's late and the townsfolk have retired for the evening. They're approached by a pair of guards, more like commoners in crude leather armor carrying spears. One of the \"guards\" has a violent cough.\n\n\"You there! State your business!\"\n\nGidyan speaks up \"We've been sent by Rillo Leadstopper of Phlan to check up on a supply of alchemical items. Can you tell us where we may find Laurel?\"\n\n\"She'd be asleep by now, exhausted from tending to all the sick folk.\" says the guard\n\n\"Sick?! Is the town plagued?\" ask Grimgar. Everyone else suddenly covers their mouths.\n\n\"Yeah, peoples are suffering from Blackscour. You should probably wait until morning to see Laurel about that.\"\n\n\"Is there anywhere we can stay?\" ask Corrin.\n\n\"Town doesn't have an Inn, so I suggest you camp outside town tonight.\"\n\n\"Thanks… um what are your names? \"\n\n\"I'm Bill, he's Ted.\"\n\n\"Excellent.\" replies Gidyan.\n\nCrickets chirp in the background.\n\nThe party leave Falcon's Hollow and camp outside.\n\nDuring Corrin's watch he sneaks into town, leaving his sleeping companions unguarded. In the stillness of the night he can hear people coughing in their beds. A lot of townsfolk appear to be sick. He returns to the campsite and decides he'll prayer for some useful spells in the morning.\n\n**Day 33, Mirtul, 1489DR**\n\nThe next morning, they find the Apothecary's shop, there's a long line of sick people outside, including some children. Corrin performs a Detect Poison and Disease ritual and notes that several people in the line are currently infected. Gidyan decides he can't wait and squeeze past the line and into the shop.\n\nInside a rail-thin woman with severe-looking spectacles and hair pulled back tightly is busy with a patient, looking up the woman impatiently shouts, “And what’s your problem?”\n\n\"Sorry to bother you ma'am, my name is Gidyan, Frillo Leadstopper sent me for his shipment.\" ask the gnome.\n\n\"As you can see I'm kind of busy.\" she sighs. \"Ok give me a minute and I'll be right out.\"\n\nCorrin decides he wants to help and walks in. \"Maybe I can help, I'm a priest of Ilmater.\"\n\n\"Can you cure disease?\" ask Laurel, peering over her spectacles.\n\n\"Um... no not yet.\"\n\n\"Then get out of my shop and let me help these people!\"\n\nCorrin leaves the shop.\n\nSeveral minutes later Laurel comes out and approaches the party.\n\nShe tells them that the shipment is delayed because of this Blackscour that's affected at least 30 villagers but many more think they have it because they're showing symptoms. She explains she can make a cure but is missing three key ingredients to make it.\n\n\"We'll help get them!\" exclaims Corrin and then offers to create several gallons of fresh water for the town and purify and food and water that may be affected by the Blackscour. Laurel thanks the halfing and apologizes for being so short with him (pun intended).\n\nLaurel explains what she needs some rare roots and concentrations, most of which she has, but there’s three she doesn't.  Elderwood moss, which grows on the oldest tree in a forest. A specially pickled root called Rat’s Tail, and Ironbloom mushrooms, that only grow in dark places thick with metal, a favorite among dwarves. She tells them they have to travel to the Other Forest not the Quivering Forest which lies to the East across the river. A treaty made long ago with the Wood Elves basically translates as \"KEEP OUT\".\n\nLaurel suggests that they can either enter the Other Forest and go looking for the ingredients or travel two days to the lumber mill on the river and speak to Milton the Foreman who has knowledge of the woods.\n\n\"So what's the name of the forest?\" asks Grimgar\n\n\"The Quivering Forest?\" replies Laurel.\n\n\"No the other forest?\"\n\n\"Correct that's where you're going.\"\n\n\"You mean to tell me the other forest is actually called The Other Forest?!\" asks Grimgar confused.\n\n\"Yes, it's easy to say than 'Not the Quivering Forest.' \" she replies, matter of fact.\n\nThe party return to their cart and Horace, who's munching on some hay, and head off to the lumber mill.\n\nDuring the day Zing spots an ominous shadow fly over. He looks up to spot a dragon like beast with a huge wingspan, a long tail and neck.\n\n\"Guys! Dragon!\" he says in a forced whisper.\n\nEveryone looks up and stays completely still.\n\nGrimgar examines the creature and notes its lack of fore claws, its brown scales and the stinger on its tail. He can't recall what the creature is called but assures the party it's no dragon.\n\n\"Maybe it's a poop dragon?\" suggests Bittersweet.\n\nCrickets chirp in the background.\n\nThey settle in for the night and this time nothing bothers them. \n\n**Day 34, Mirtul, 1489DR**\n\nThe next day they continue on and reach the Lumber Mill by the afternoon.\n\nThe lumber operation is set up near the river so cut logs can be sent down to Phlan. There are several workers about, mainly humans and a couple of dwarves. Asking around the party are shown the foreman's office, a small building attached to the timber warehouse.\n\nMilton is a large man but friendly enough, too friendly comments Grimgar after he tells them where they need to go and even offers to look after Horace and the cart while they're gone. The party ask if any of the workers are ill and he says no. Corrin even tries to divine if the wood is contaminated but gets no results.\n\nMilton tells them where they need to find the ingredients and gladly sketches them a rough map of the forest, marking the location of where he believes the oldest tree in the forest where they can find the Eldermoss, and where a dwarven ruins stands where they'll find the Ironbloom. He mentions that he doesn't know where they can get the Rat's Tail but suggests the travel to the home of Ulizmila the witch, she may know or have some. He adds her location to the map.\n\nDuring the conversation Grimgar keeps referring to the Quivering Forest and is corrected by Milton ever time. Information in hand, the party head off, deciding to get the Eldermoss first. They pass where the lumberjacks are working away and eventually leave them behind amidst the tall trees and heavy foliage.\n\nAs the trudge through the forest they spot something up ahead. Waiting in cover, the creature shuffles into view, it's a kobold with a sign hanging around its neck. \n\nZing reads the signs \"It's in Draconic, it reads TRAIDER so it's either a Traitor or a Trader?\"\n\nGidyan steps into view and suddenly a mouse pops out of the kobold's empty eye socket. \"Gah! I think it's dead?\"\n\nCorrin looks at the kobold and confirms it. \"Not dead, undead. Not sure what kind.\"\n\nGrimgar draws his bow. \"Who cares, kill it!\"\n\nWithin seconds the kobold lies dead, again.\n\nCorrin rushes over to the kobold, kneels down next to it and coaxes the mouse out with a piece of cheese. It scurries up his arm onto his shoulder. \"I'm going to call him Perrin!\" he beams.\n\nCrickets chirp in the background.\n\nEventually the party reach a large clearing with a titanic darkwood tree that dominates this clearing at its center. Several holes dot the clearing here and there. The holes are ringed by turned earth.\n\nThe debate what to do and decide to cautiously approach the tree. At its base they find no sign of the Eldermoss. Looking around they can't seem to see any of it around.\n\n\"There it is!\" says Bittersweet who happened to be looking at the sky in case the Poop Dragon comes back.\n\nEveryone panics for a moment. \"Where? Where?!\"\n\n\"I can see the moss, it's about 100 feet up in where the branches start.\"\n\nIdeas on how to get up there are tossed around. The magic users debate how best to use Mage Hand until Bittersweet speak up.\n\n\"Hey guys. I have a climbing kit, oh and a Potion of Climbing we got from Brother O'Keefe!\"\n\nMoments later Bittersweet is on his way up. He almost falls several times but continues the long, slow climb.\n\nDown below the others are watching his progress except Grimgar who is keeping an eye on the holes. As predicted a creature suddenly emerges from one of the holes. The creature resembles a giant centipede with the head of a beetle with oversized jaws. \n\nGrimgar yells a cry of alarm and fires an arrow at the creature but the arrow goes way wide, disappearing into the foliage. The creature turns to the closest target, Corrin, and spits a stream of acid at him. The halfling manages to react and avoid a direct hit by the acid burns his side. Corrin panics for a moment thinking Perrin has been killed but finds the mouse a few feet away, he scoops it up and places at the base of the tree. The acid spitting insect retreats into the ground. The rest of the party prepare to attack it if it returns.\n\nReturn it does, popping up another hole. Grimgar's arrow once again sails into the foliage never to be seen again. Zing's Firebolt and Corrin's Sacred Flame strike true. Gidyan tries a Sleep spell hoping to end this fight quickly but it has no effect. It spits acid once again and hits the half-orc who barely survives the attack, then it retreats underground once again.\n\nUp high, Bittersweet looks down and sees his companions fighting but unable to assist, he continues his climb.\n\nFrom a different hole the beast emerges and is struck by several attacks before spewing forth acid on Gidyan. This time it decides it wants a meal and scuttles forth from the hole looking for a gnome or halfling snack. Finally, Grimgar fires an arrow that flies true, sinking between the creature's huge mandibles and stabbing it in the brain. It collapses in a heap.\n\nThe party gather around and debate using it's hide for armor or clothes but Bittersweet calls out and begins shaking the Eldermoss from the top of the tree. He then makes way down quickly. Gidyan begins gathering the moss. Corrin looks around for Perrin and eventually finds him, a coaxing of food has him quickly return to the halfling's shoulder. They camp for the night\n\n**Day 35, Mirtul, 1489DR**\n\nThe next day, the party head off towards the witch's home.\n\nThe sounds of the forest become suddenly distant as the trees part, opening into a small, almost perfectly circular glade. The nearest stands of pine, eyln, and darkwood—all typically sturdy woods—twist away from the clearing, as if bent by some impossibly strong wind or seemingly in an attempt to flee despite their paralyzed roots. At the glade’s center squats an ugly cottage, little more than a pile of twigs, shoots, and ivy stacked upon mud walls. From the thatched roof dangle a dozen small thatched fetishes—each shaped like a tiny triangular man, keeping guard before a rickety plank door.\n\n\"I'm out!\" says Zing, putting his hands up and refusing to take another step forward.\n\n\"I'm with him.\" says Gidyan.\n\nBittersweet, Corrin and Grimgar approach the hut. They call out to the witch but there's no response. Grimgar looks through a dirty window and sees a robed, hooded figure. He taps on the window but there's no movement from the figure.\n\nFinally mustering some courage, Gidyan steps forward and casts Mage Hand, pushing the door open magically. He steps inside with Grimgar. Inside, the cottage is dank, reeking, and filled with shadows. Haphazardly hung shelves line the walls, covered in all manner of clay jugs, clouded bottles, strangely cut rocks, rotted bunches of herbs, and a museum of other crude curios and remnants of a bone grinder’s artifice. A rusted iron cauldron, with a mouth nearly 5 feet wide and a depth of at least 3 feet, dominates the hut’s single room, its ash-covered surface shaped with a relief of capering fiends and leering devils. Across from the door, against the far walls, stands a high-backed chair made of wicker, the gigantic curved tusks of some monstrous beast, and thousands of human teeth. In the chair sits what looks like a robed, hooded figure. \n\nPulling back the hood they discover its form padded with pungent herbs and sprouting patches of thick white mold. This ominous shape is actually only a bundle of branches, mud, and linen. Gidyan begins looking for the herbs but the place is a mess. He does uncover a pouch containing essential salts useful in summoning a familiar.\n\n\"I say we step outside and wait for the witch to arrive.\" suggests Grimgar.\n\nGidyan agrees and steps outside closing the door behind him. The party wait for a short while and decide to head off to the dwarven monastery and come back later.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED...\n\n**[[5e] Defiance in Phlan - Session 8] (https://np.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/54g1bj/5e_defiance_in_phlan_session_8/)**\n",

        "text": "I just finished a 4 month long contract with some musicians/actors/singers/dancers. A group of about 7 of us decided to start a game of Star Wars Saga Edition. We had all played multiple pen and paper RPG's previously, so I assumed the group would be a well rounded group. I was wrong. Literally everyone wanted to be a force user of some kind. Laaaaame. I chose to be a Bothan Spy named Lavyn. I was motivated purely by my own gain. Chaotic Neutral, if you will. I had access to a huge network called the Spynet, which could be used to request/gather information, place or accept bounties, etc. Towards the beginning of the campaign I was under a massive attack from enemy forces. My group was trapped against a sealed airlock that led to our salvation. All of a sudden I was contacted inside the Spynet by a mysterious, anonymous entity that preferred to only go by the name \"Shadow Broker\". He saved our lives and continued to do so throughout the 4 month contract. We never met in person, but he always managed to give me JUST enough information to steer the group and I towards where we were trying to go. (In this case, it was in search of an ancient Sith artifact which was said to have the power to change time and space). This guy was a total badass. He knew intimate details about every member of my group. Things that nobody could have known unless they had been right next to us the whole campaign. At one point, we thought he might be the owner of a transgender Droid who was a member of our group. (I'd love to talk about the Droid, if anyone is interested.)\n\nFast forward to the end of my (real life) work contract. It was the last day that we were all going to be together to continue playing. We finally found the artifact we had been searching for. There was an epic battle between our group and the sith, but we were unable to keep them from activating the artifact. Upon activation, it opened a portal into what seemed to be an alternate reality. A reality where all the events of our current campaign hadn't happened. (Massive Genocides, destruction of planets, race wars between Wookie and Transdoshians) It appeared as though we had won the fight, however the portal remained open. When it came time to close the portal, I decided to jump inside at the last moment. Contrary to my team of light side force users who wanted nothing to do with this \"evil\" thing, I was curious. I got locked inside, and my body was completely absorbed. My consciousness still existed, but I no longer had form. I became a sentient force, able to connect with any and all electronic equipment throughout the galaxy. The first thing I notice as I become aware of my new consciousness is the sight of a group of people that are under attack from the Empire. It was us! That was me! I was him. The entire campaign, I had been giving myself clues and saving my own ass from certain death. The \"portal to an alternate reality\" turned out to actually be a portal to 4 months previous. I was now, and had always been, the Shadow Broker.\n\nEnd Campaign\n\n\nI felt so rewarded for choosing a non force user. It definitely paid off for me in the end, seeing as I felt pretty useless compared to about 4 other force sensitive party members.",

Since I have been planning some details of this campaign for years, I have decided to record all of it in literary style. This post is a combination of two sessions with one player who will be playing in the main campaign, and two who will not. Some early parts of the first session are left out.*\n\nAlchemist, Furrio, Daphne, and Bojingles approached the Warpwolf's cave. Furrio, a towering figure at eight feet,  never caught without his all-encompassing [exemplar plate](http://images.wikia.com/ironkingdoms/images/f/f6/Kreoss.jpg), spoke to his captive, Daphne. \"So, can you use any magic?\"\n\nDaphne, a runaway who had been posing as an archivist in town, replies, \"yes, of course!\"\n\nBojingles, an orcish bard, asked back, \"Oh yeah? What spells?\"\n\n\"Well, a few...\"\n\n\"How many,\" asks Alchemist, petting his Fox companion.\n\n\"Well, Influence, for one...\"\n\n\"Good enough,\" says Furrio, \"now here's the plan.\"\n\n***\n\nAlchemist took two shots, and killed the two Warpwolf pups. Before this even awoke the Warpwolf, Furrio clawed deep into her, and Bojingles shot his harpoon into the wall near her. The Warpwolf fought back weakly, but after being charged by Bojingles' cutlass, was on her last (hind) legs. To his surprise, Furrio felt something influence him, and he attacked Bojingles, nearly killing him. The Warpwolf, seeing her chance, jumped on Furrio as his back was turned. In an instant, the Warpwolf was on the ground, and Furrio sliced its throat open, finally freeing the town of Jilia from its terrorizing ways.\n\nBojingles looked right at Furrio. \"Bojingles remembers who hurts him.\" He started walking away, but before he could even leave the cave, Furrio sliced the back of his neck, finishing what he inadvertently started. Alchemist, seeing the charge, had leveled his rifle at Furrio, but now lowered it, knowing it would do no good to fight the much larger mercenary. \n\n“You heard him, that was a threat.”\n\n“Of course,” replied a skeptical, frightened Alchemist. “You gotta do what you gotta do.”\n\n***\n\n\"But... well, you know, I ran away, we're not best friends right now... it'll be awkward is all.\"\n\nFurrio threw up his hands in exasperation. \"I don't care, we're watching you talk to him.\"\n\nDaphne was desperate. \"I... Seriously, can't we just go back to Jilia for the night so I can do it at the inn?\"\n\nFurrio just looked at Alchemist, who handed her the Sending Scroll. Daphne sighed, activating the scroll. \"Umm, hi dad. I'm safe and stuff. We're totally coming to find you. Where... where y' at?\"\n\nDaphne appeared to listen for a second, and the glowing runes around the scroll faded. \"He's in... he's in Conaghy, I think it's just north of here.\"\n\n\"Bullshit, where is he?\"\n\n\"Conaghy, I swear! By Haen, have a little trust.\"\n\nFurrio and Alchemist exchanged glances, to the extent one can exchange glances with someone whose face is covered by a visor. \"Alright,\" sighs Furrio, \"nowhere else to try.\"\n\n***\n\nA stranger in shoddy green armour passed the travelers on their way. \"Hail, wanderer,\" called Furrio. \"From whence do you come?\"\n\n\"Hail! I am a member of the Emerald Watch. I'm just coming from their outpost now, not far from here.\"\n\n\"Emerald Watch? Is that an adventuring company?\"\n\n\"Heh, don't see many of those these days. No, we're more of a militia group. Trying to get people up in arms to protect against the Blight, you know. I'm just going recruiting now.\"\n\n*Militia*. Furrio began thinking. \"What's your command structure like?\"\n\n\"Well, I'm fairly new, I'm not totally sure. I know it involves seniority and achievement.\"\n\nThis was very interesting to Furrio. After losing so much power, getting a little back might be good for him, he thought. Furrio had the stranger to mark the location on his map, and continued on.\n\n***\n\n\"She's gone.\"\n\nFurrio sat upright, tossing Fox off his chest to the ground (not an easy task; Fox wears solid silver armour). \"Show me.\"\n\nThe two looked over the empty bedroll where Da-\n\n\"Sorry, you sleep in your armour?\"\n\n\"Yeah, and you can't stop a 14 year old girl from escaping. You gonna track her or what?\"\n\nAlchemist sighed and got to work; it would be a long few days of slow movement.\n\n***\n\n\"Well hey there bud! Name's Furrio, and this is my associate, Jazz Hands!\"\n\nAlchemist, caught off guard, weakly raised his hands and waved them a bit.\n\n\"Uhh, what exactly do you want?\"\n\n\"We're looking to enlist in the Emerald Watch.\"\n\nThe Watchman looked up at Furrio. The mountainous figure's visor was tilted back, revealing his cheery Ogrun mug. \"I'll take you to Conlan.\"\n\n***\n\n\"So what I'm saying is that this guy, Daphael, showed up yesterday, he clearly wasn't fit for combat so we told him he could stay the night and then get gone. Now today I'm hearing that a human-sized sack of rations didn't make it onto the caravan that went out last night, and nobody saw the kid leave. So looks like I've got a stowaway who's going to get himself and possibly my men killed the moment a Nyss shows up, and no men to spare to ride out to the caravan in time to warn them.\"\n\n\"Sounds bad,\" said Furrio.\n\n\"And what you're saying is that you're willing to enlist without talking about pay, and now you want to ride out to the caravan right away, and you've got your own horses? Hot damn, sounds good to me. These enlistment papers are filled out all wrong, but I couldn't care less. Now... Furrio, and... Sorry, it doesn't say you're name, just that you're an alchemist.\"\n\nAlchemist rolled his eyes. \"No, my name's Alchemist. I'm a rifleman.\"\n\n\"And an alchemist?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, either way. Good luck to you both. Here's some papers to show the caravan approving you to search for the stowaway, and here's a map showing where the Blight sighting was that the caravan's off investigating. Haenspeed.\"\n\n***\n\nFurrio rode swiftly along the caravan's tracks, his second (stolen) horse trailing behind, carrying Fox. Barely keeping pace beside him was Alchemist, on foot.\n\n\"You're quite sure you don't want to be on a horse? Fox isn't using that one entirely.\"\n\n\"I don't ride.\"\n\n\"Alright, but, it seems like it'd be faster to-\"\n\n\"I'm fast.\"\n\n\"Yeah, okay, it's just that time is sort of sensitive and-\"\n\n\"I don't ride.\"\n\n\"No, I understand that you generally don't-\"\n\n\"Shut up Furrio.\"\n\n***\n\nThe caravan had stopped. A couple of the Watchmen (including a fair number of women) talked about something on the road, Daphne can't make it out. After a minute, a familiar voice spoke to the driver, and they seemed to come to an agreement. The silence stretched on for another half a minute, until the sack was pulled violently from over her head, throwing her short hair into disarray. An unfamiliar ogrun face (she supposes it's Furrio's although she doesn't know why he's been hiding such a handsome build) filled her vision, scowling.\n\n\"Alright, *boy*, you're coming with us.\" A wink indicated enough; she wasn't having her identity revealed to the Watch, presumably to Furrio's own ends. She certainly didn't see a reason to cross him, not after what he did to his own party member. There would be no more running. It was time to confront her father... well, if her father managed to get near Conaghy any time soon. She smiled. Even if these two brought her to the port town, there'd be plenty of chance to slip away, and if she stowed away on a ship to Draznea, there'd be no following her then.\n\n***\n\n\"The hell's that?\"\n\nAlchemist looked at the ogrun. He was pointing to the sky, a bit to his left. Following his gaze, Alchemist saw a [Harrier](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse3.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.M9949d4ed36fef1750ab91aa467a38efdo0%26pid%3D15.1&amp;f=1) flying dangerously close. It was a small miracle the Blighted scout hadn't seen him already, and if he had anything to do with it, their luck wouldn't be running out any time soon.\n\n\"Get off your horse, now, and take cover.\"\n\nFurrio understood his tone, and jumped right off his horse, deftly grabbing a tied-up Daphne off his second. While Furrio dragged some foliage to a large tree, Alchemist tied Daphne to it, keeping her gagged in case she got any bright ideas again. With the trio hidden, the Harrier passed without danger, and a second followed suit. After a couple of seconds, they relax, prematurely. A [Blighted Nyss](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BJQn-Oj0FX0/Vly4JKG9IAI/AAAAAAAA10M/Ti1-K6lcXyU/s1600/Nyss%2BStrider.png) walks by not three meters from them. Furrio tenses, causing a dangerous clinking sound in his armour.\n\nThe Nyss turned her head.\n\nFurrio sprang out of the hiding place.\n\nThe Nyss fell to the ground before her bow was strung.\n\nHer friends were a bit more fortunate, and loose their arrows. Two glanced off the ogrun's armour doing no harm, the other three hit the tree near Alchemist. Alchemist took two Nyss out with two shots, and Furrio tore a diving Harrier out of the sky. As the Nyss move forward, there was a loud roar, and the [Angelius](https://www.frontlinegaming.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/angelius-500x500.png) they were escorting showed itself.\n\nFurrio wasted no more time playing with the Nyss, and ran straight at the wyrm. He dazed it with a smashing warhammer blow to the head, and sliced its tongue out with his enchanted sword. While Furrio dodged the monster's swift tail strikes and flaming breath, Alchemist took out Nyss after Blighted Nyss.\n\nIn no time at all, with entire unit down, and Furrio slashed the Angelius in two, causing it to explode in blood and arcane energy. As he catched his breath, Alchemist called out in joyous agony, pulling out one of the arrows.\n\nFurrio turned his head in time to see one remaining Nyss slice a defenseless Daphne's throat. The Nyss lasted not a second longer, but the damage was done. The young girl they were charged with tracking down and bringing back to her father was gone, and with her, in all likelihood, the promised gold.\n\n***\n\n\"Well if he's anywhere he's in the market, I'd say.\"\n\n\"Thanks, we'll check there.\"\n\nGerard wasn't the most distinctive looking merchant, but with any luck he'd be predictable. They guessed that Daphne knew where to meet her father, but for them some looking around would be necessary.\n\nWith a little luck they found their employer in the middle of the tiny port village's excuse for a marketplace. As it were, Daphne lied about him saying to meet in Conaghy, but knowing his daughter, he'd paid for a teleportation to the village they'd visited together years ago. Now he looked on her cleaned up corpse, with a mountainous and incompetent adventurer trying to haggle him for half pay. His constitution broke, and he cried, despite the gawking Dwarf and Orc holding hands nearby. He handed over a purse with about the right amount of money in it, and walked off with what used to be his daughter to make the many ghastly preparations. A horn sounded, barely masking the dwarf's words, as Gerard walks out of earshot.\n\n***\n\n\"Yeah, blighted nyss, we saw a few coming into town. Come to think of it, that's what the Emerald Watch were running towards in this region, too. What was that horn?\"\n\n\"Well lad, if what ye' say's true, tha's tha soun' o' us gettin' invaded by th' Bloit. Stay close.\"\n\nAs the dwarf finished his forecast, a ground of Nyss ran into the marketplace, some with seaweed still on their armour from swimming up to the beach. They released their two [Raek](http://media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/b6/4c/ef/b64cef51a6b0b3a8cd4faa8281864490.jpg) into the crowd, and loosed arrows on the innocent villagers. One arrow pierced the Orc's skull, and she dropped right to the ground.\n\n\"Melsa, no! Tha's me wife, ya bastards!\"\n\nThe Dwarf grabbed a mace from a nearby abandoned merchant's stall, and charged into the fray, killing the offending Nyss.\n\nFurrio tackled one Raek, and the other jumped on Alchemist. The Rifleman struggled to get the large beast of war off of him, but it was much stronger, and kept clawing at him. He couldn’t even reach for his gun before an arrow sank into his leg, and he howled in pain as loud as the Raek howled in bloodlust.\n\nFurrio and the dwarf slew Nyss after Nyss, and it's not until Fox let out a wail of despair that the exemplar realized his last remaining friend on the Keph was dead. His revenge was swift; he ripped the Raek's head off its body, but not before a couple more bystanders fell to the deadly Nyss' arrows.\n\nJust when things looked up, and only a handful of Nyss remained, a dozen or so [Grotesques](http://cdn.miniaturemarket.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/p/i/pip73090.jpg) jumped over the rooftops surrounding the marketplace, and several Harriers flew into view.\n\nThe dwarf went pale. \"If ye're not ready t' die defending this town, lad, now's th' time t' run.\" He held steady, mace at the ready, preparing for the blighted monstrosities to charge, and the camera pans to Furrio, looking around desperately for some kind of help. Before he finds it, the words \"to be continued\" flash across the bottom of the screen, and everything fades to black.",

        "text": "Hi there /r/Gametales! I’m a long time lurker, first time poster, so I apologize for any formatting issues. This happened today and it might just be the best thing I have ever been part of whilst playing D&amp;D. We went in a completely different direction than the DM had planned us to do, but it was amazing; even he thought so. Also, possible spoilers ahead for the “Hoard of the Dragon Queen; Tyranny of Dragons” campaigns. You’ve been warned.\n\n\nFirst of all, a little introduction to the characters: Dietrich the Tiefling Warlock (me) and his imp companion Pipyap; Serine the Half-elf Rogue; Dramina the Wood Elf Ranger; Keth the Half-Orc Paladin and his celestial horse Strider; and Drache the Human Cleric. We also have three NPCs with us; Chaarb, La’Shauna and Priest #2.  Priest #1 sadly died 5 minute into today’s session but we really didn’t care. It’s also important to note that there was “wild magic” in effect, meaning any magic users had random effects happen when they casted, so there was no magic which could be used unless we risked exploding or something. This became important to consider because it made Dietrich entirely useless in combat (yay -1 Strength!), and severely nerfed everyone but Serine.\n\n\nSo far in our quest; we’ve been trying to find a temple in the mountains that Serine saw in a vision.  Her boyfriend is being held captive there by the Cult of the Dragon for…reasons we don’t know yet, which is why we’re on our way to save him. We’re running about 2 days behind our enemies at this point due to various things happening to us (such as fighting a dune worm, being bewitched by a plant, and having our Paladin nearly die from magic fog.) \n\n\nMaking our way through the mountainous area, we come to a ravine-esque path which us to a village of goblins who are being treated as slaves by a group of men. Our paladin (who is part of the guard in the base city) recognizes them as a crime syndicate who’ve been causing the city issues for years; as he is a new guard, they don’t recognize him. The criminals attempt to get us to stop and rest as we look ragged. Our rogue turns on the waterworks about us needing to hurry past to find her boyfriend and tries to continue before being blocked by a wall of a man who tries to intimidate her into staying. \n\n\nNow we’re by no means the most loyal group in regards to friendships (especially not the rogue), but it is a general rule that if you mess with one of us, you mess with all of us (because we kind of do need each other to make it). So we, as a group, roll an intimidate roll as we all step forward to keep going in canon. The rolls are successful and we intimidate the crap out of the men, who back down and let us pass, knowing it wasn’t worth trying to fight us. The paladin wanted to go back and free the goblins, but decided that finding the temple was for the greater good and they could be freed later if we lived to tell the tale.\n\n\nSlightly further on from the village, we find a manual cable car system with two separate tracks joining one mountain top to the next one over. There was a huge hand crank system for each track on our side. We send Pipyap to look ahead and he finds the left carriage in the middle as well as a crank on the other side. We decide to split the party; we send one strong (Drache) and one sneaky (Serine) character off to the other side, so they could then winch across the rest of the party who are still left on the original side. \n\n\nWe get the car to us, the cleric/rogue jump in and we begin getting them across. About ¾ of the way across they see ANOTHER cable car on the opposite track travelling back towards us three, filled with enemy cultists. They stay hidden and make a plan to help us since we have no communication between the two groups. When they hit the other side, Serine finds two cultists who are sending the huge group over to the other side who were intended to kill us. Instead, she kills these two cultists’ steals their cloaks and dons their gear alongside the cleric, as they start bringing the car back to the middle to strand the cultist group there. \n\n\nMeanwhile on the other side, we (Paladin/Ranger/Warlock) see the cultists heading right towards us in their cable car. Dramina starts shooting at them whilst Keth throws his spears as the cable car jerks to a halt and then jerks again as it begins to move backwards. Dietrich sees the crank turning, figures out what’s happening, and starts helping with the crank at our end and trap them in the middle faster. We get the NPCs to bring our cable car back over, and once the cultists are stranded in the middle, the three hop on and get the NPCs to send us back over, as the other two need to keep up the façade they’re cultists. We get to the other side no issues, leaving no survivors in the cult cart on the opposite side as we killed the remaining cultists as we slowly drifted past them on our side (okay not *all* of them; we left one alive and he tried to escape, failed, and fell to his death.) \n\nAll together again on the other side, we spy a massive camp of the cultists sitting around waiting for next orders whilst their leaders argued about…something. The halfling we had been tracking was there, as well as a character we’d come across earlier in the story who mysteriously vanished after we threw her in jail. Annoyingly there were too many to take on, especially without magic to use. We were strong but we needed to save our energy for a possibly bigger fight ahead, and who knew when we could begin to use magic safely again? \n\n\nThat's when the rogue remembers she has the means to make bombs. We can bomb the encampment! But we needed to do as much damage as possible and take down as many cultists as we can in one blow. One bomb wasn’t going to cut it.  Then Keth pointed out that Strider was a celestial mount, meaning he could be resummoned when killed. \n\n\nAnd then the plan hit us. We were going to go Trojan horse on this place.\n\n\nWe rig up Strider with several explosives and tell him to trot into the camp. Flying above him was Pipyap who, when signaled, would drop a small oil-soaked rag onto Strider to detonate him. So in trots a merry Strider, and as the camp leader begins shouting about “who didn’t tie up a dam horse?!” Strider combusts. Killing over half the camp. We all imagined it something like [this]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1jf2hOkec4) (spoilers for Kingsman: The Secret Service). Keth, Dramina and Drache mopped up the rest as Pipyap dropped bombs on those running away. Dietrich and Serine got the NPCs over to our side in time for everyone in the camp to be dead, if they weren’t lucky enough to escape.\n\n\nThe DM had **no** idea what our plan was once we got to the other side, and he looked at us all in disbelief that we’d done nothing that he’d planned us to do.\n\n\n\nOur DM thought we would free the goblins and kill the thugs. This would allow us to use the goblins we freed to send us across on the cable car, where we were supposed to have a huge battle with the opposing car of cultists as we all passed each other by. The final part with the camp was meant to be an all-out battle between us and them, with them getting the upper hand and having a surprise round, and wearing us down before we hit the finale session next week. \n\n\nInstead we said “to hell with the goblins” (except the Paladin, who had to be persuaded we would *totally* go back for them), trapped and killed some cultists in a cable car, and blew the rest up with a Trojan horse of sorts. We all agreed that was definitely the more fun way to have done it.\n",

        "text": "The (not-so) Epic of Sarah Mazda, Terminator-Goat of Chaos\n\nSo a couple of years ago, the guy who usually DMed for us ran a Black Crusade game. Four of us joined, none of us anticipating the madness that would ensue. While ultimately plenty of madness ensued across Khymerus, the part I remember most fondly was the session where I made my unsanctioned Psyker, Sarah Mazda, into a monster of epic proportions.\n\nSo, a brief forward about Sarah Mazda. I wanted to keep my motivations and backstory fairly straightforward, so I came up with the following. Mazda was an Imperial citizen originating from the Calixis Sector (I was never sure which planet), who had been on the cusp of marriage when her powers revealed themselves and she was taken away by the Black Ships. Mechanically, I wanted to make a character that didn't favour any God in particular so that I could try out the Exalted powers. Motivation-wise, all Sarah wanted to do was get home.\n\nAt some point during her voyage, Sarah's ship was commandeered by an Inquisitor. Said Inquisitor apparently had the brilliant idea to retrofit this ship with torpedo tubes, load 50 unsanctioned psykers into a boarding torpedo, and fire said boarding torpedo at another ship. For reasons. Somehow, Sarah survived this catastrophe, disembarked, and hid in the bowels of the ship. At one point she raided the armory, finding a suit of power armour and a few decent weapons &lt;read: her starting gear&gt;. She also experimented with her newfound powers, using her wedding ring as a focus and her motivation as discipline. \n\nThe ship wound up sailing straight into the Maw of the Screaming Vortex, dropping Sarah into a world misery and intrigue. Naturally, being a lifelong Imperial citizen with little experience in how these matters were supposed to work, she immediately set her mind on getting home. No, I had no idea what I'd do once I got there, but it made for a decent character motivation.\n\nShe teamed up with fellow Calixis-local Aundiose Levericai, a blademaster and renegade who had the presence of mind to play dead when the Inquisition came by to bust up a cult he was associated with and had also, through another string of ludicrous circumstances, wound up in the Vortex. Aundiose was played by a good friend of mine, to the point where he deserves his own write-up at some point, but in short he was built for melee.\n\nTogether, Sarah and Aundiose took up work with a Q'Sal Magistrate (read, sorcerer with connections) which lead them to the dead planet of Khymerus. It also lead them to a dead end, as the Magistrate decided he didn't need them anymore and abandoned them. Without food or water, Sarah and Aundiose needed a break and quick.\n\nThe game starts at this point. Sarah and Aundiose are given a satchel by a seemingly-familiar stranger. This stranger addresses Sarah as a friend, and though she can't remember him Sarah is polite and accepts his request. The stranger tells them to bring the package to Gear Axis, a techpriest living in the spire of the ruined spaceport in town (and another PC). Unbeknownst to them, Gear has been watching them exchange the satchel from a perch on the spire. Having taken meticulous notes on all those coming and going from the spaceport, Gear realizes that he's never seen the stranger before.\n\nAs Sarah and Aundiose move towards the spire, they're intercepted by the fourth and final PC, the rogue Inquisitor Zero and her daemonic familiar Gabrielle. Zero is, in a word, bullshit. Her player really wanted her to be the protagonist of Drakengard 3, and he had worked together with the DM to make her as mechanically consistent with the games as possible. The end result was a monstrous character with absurd strength, nasty weaponry, and a temper so short a Hobbit could use it as a step-stool. As it turns out, she's been watching Sarah and Aundiose ever since they showed up. Since it breaks up the monotony, Zero joins the party, albeit with her fair share of suspicions.\n\nReaching the spire, Sarah presented Gear with the package. It turns out to be a bomb. Acting on instinct, Sarah tosses the bomb out of the window with telekinesis. Unfortunately, while the bomb goes off harmlessly outside Sarah triggers psychic phenomena (and causes tremors to rush through the spire). Zero and Gear keep their footing, Sarah and Aundiose go bouncing down the spire. Yay. Once the tremor subsides, Zero demands answers. Sarah and Aundiose, seeing as they've clearly just pissed off an unstable individual with a sword taller than she is, do the sensible thing and flee. Zero is faster. So the party's been together for a grand total of a minute, and the first combat of the game is PvP. This can only end so well.\n\nZero is daemonically enhanced and wielding an Eviscerator (a fuck-hueg chainsaw-blade). Due to these bonuses her basic attack with this weapon did 1d10 + 21 damage. Now she's pissed. Instinctively, Sarah throws out a Doombolt blast as a divisionary tactic. It's meant solely as a smokescreen, but Zero dodges regardless. However, another unintended side effect rears its ugly head: the perils of the warp, manifesting as blood rain. Automatic psychic phenomena for 4 turns: YAY. \n\nFor reference, psychic phenomena in Black Crusade means two things. First, it means that the psyker's power triggers a second, unintended effect that ranges anywhere from mild annoyance to auto-killing the psyker in question. The second effect, which I believe was introduced in Black Crusade, is that the phenomena induces additional corruption in the psyker. So if you aren't careful with your powers, your corruption track can skyrocket. In character, Sarah had no way of knowing this. Out of character, I was playing very recklessly.\n\nAnyhow, Sarah and Zero fight to a bloody draw in the bloody rain. Sarah is reduced down to a handful of wounds by Zero's eviscerator, Zero is reduced down to a handful of wounds by another flurry of Doombolts, and due in part to the blood rain Sarah suffers not one but two gifts of the gods: Eye of Chaos and Animal Hybrid. Sarah's helmet bursts off as a pair of goat horns erupts from her head. Then Sarah suffers one of the worst possible results she could get at the time: Soul Sear. Her psyker powers deactivated, Sarah is helpless against Zero. In a single sweep, Zero cleaves Sarah's left arm off. Sarah's not having a good day.\n\nSarah burns infamy not to die, leaving her at the mercy of Zero. A few harsh words are exchanged in-game as Zero basically makes Sarah her slave under threat of death. Seeing as she's helpless (and down a limb), Sarah accepts.\n\nSo the blood rain subsides, Soul Sear wears off, and the group decides to head to the Bordello (the local inn of sorts) to get some medical attention and cool their heads. Sarah is still furious from the loss of her arm and Zero's frequent taunting isn't helping matters. Due in part to the Animal Hybrid manifestation, Zero has been referring to Sarah as “Cattle.” This infuriates me both in and out of character, but I don't want to go back to PvP so I don't make anything of it. So Sarah kicks in the door of the Bordello, knocking it clean off its hinges, strides into the bar with her severed arm hung over her shoulder, and announces, “MAZDA DEMANDS MEDICAL ATTENTION,” as confidently as she can. Naturally I botch the Intimidate roll and everyone in the bar laughs at Sarah. One patron, an old woman sitting by the bar with a power-armoured bodyguard, turns towards Sarah and says “Mazda? Who's Mazda?” in a high-pitched, whiny voice.\n\nSarah promptly Doombolts the old woman.\n\nThe old woman is bashed twice in the head, her face fried off. The laughter stops. She collapses onto the bar, and her bodyguard makes a quick exit. Then a hand goes up in the back, saying, “Medical attention for the lady who smoked the Mendacious Oracle.”\n\nWell, yay. For those who don't do BC, the Mendacious Oracle of the Temple of Lies is a big-deal local legend on Khymerus. Supposedly the Oracle was a servant of Tzeentch who had given prophecies about every successful Chaos warlord in the Vortex. And Sarah had just wasted her without a thought. Wonderful. That can't possibly have long-reaching consequences. So Sarah goes down to the table and gets her free medical attention.\n\nTo her disappointment, Sarah learns from this ambiguous doctor that she can't get her arm reattached. She does get her wounds restored however. Zero gets her wounds restored as well, because of association with Sarah and her own badass status. Aundiose does not, though he has no real injury to speak of. As this is going down, Gear notices the power-armoured bodyguard of the Oracle hovering around the doorway.\n\nAccording to the bodyguard, he intends to kill Sarah for killing his charge. Gear has no intention of stopping him, possibly due to Sarah nearly assassinating him before, and Sarah has no idea about what was going on. However, Sarah has line of sight on the guy because there's no door anymore. LAWL. So seeing her erstwhile ally addressing this guy and noticing the death glare she was getting from the guy, Sarah walks over to the conversation and demands to know what's going on. The bodyguard promptly challenges her to a duel.\n\nHe's dead before he can take his first turn. Again, reckless, but there's no way in hell I'm taking this guy on in a fair fight.\n\nAs Sarah casually steps over the guy's body, she notices an onlooker walking towards them. She has no idea what this guy wants, so she challenges him. The guy looks bewildered, and requests permission to take the fallen man's weapon.\n\nSarah looks down at the magnificent chain-glaive, kicks it up into her grasp, and then tosses it to Aundiose.\n\nAs Aundiose is reveling in his new weapon, Sarah notices the stranger from earlier. She walks up to the guy and starts a conversation with him, and after a few cryptic questions the guy dissolves into a pile of flesh and crawls out the window. Sarah chases it for an hour into the desert, before giving up and grumpily returning home.\n\nWhile she's out, the group returns to the cargo cult at the spaceport with the intent of repairing the bodyguard's power armour for Zero. In exchange for Aundiose's las-pistol (best craftsmanship) and the good word of Gear, the cult makes the armour functional. Of course, due to the helmet being mangled beyond repair a good deal of the benefits of power armour are gone. In exchange, however, the power source has been modified so that Zero can just plug any energy weapons she wishes into the armour and charge them for free. Goodbye, ammunition problems. After Sarah marches in, the group decides that rather than waiting for the rest of their natural lives for a Chaos Reaver ship they should probably head out to the Temple of Lies and gather enough eldritch lore to enact the Dimension Door spell. Great! Now how do we get there? The shortest way is a run through a canyon of murderous servitors, and the most safe way is three months in the desert. The party elects for safety, and decide they need to gather food and a groundcar.\n\nThe first attempt at finding a groundcar goes nowhere. Aundiose, having arguably the best Fellowship of the group, comes up with nothing. That's okay, Zero was asked by the mutants to help make a breach in the second floor of the local inn to access a vault full of corpse starch. We can get some food there. The party heads over there, and Zero begins hacking at the wall with her eviscerator. This takes all night, and the rest of the party rests while Zero cracks the wall. All the while, a mob of mutants gathers to watch and wait.\n\nZero cracks the wall in the early-to-mid-morning, and the rest of us are awakened by a cry of joy from the mutants. As one, the mob charges. Zero's familiar activates, but it winds up doing nothing. Zero herself pulls off four degrees of damage with her eviscerator, while Aundiose does two degrees with his chain glaive and Sarah does two degrees with doombolt. The mutants are soundly routed shortly afterwards, 1/3rd of the population of the town is dead and Zero's familiar is dining on the corpses. Great. Let's go out to get a groundcar.\n\nAgain, we roll the dice. Again despite Aundiose helping us, we have nothing. In frustration, I declare to the GM that “Hey, the next guy to turn us down is going to get doombolted.” The GM nods, looks through his notes, and says, “You've just doombolted the leader of the cargo cult.”\n\nWell shit.\n\nTo make matters worse, Sarah rolled abysmally on her Doombolt, so no damage was done to the guy. He simply sneered off the attack, flicking a pair of power blades from his wrists as he did so, and the GM declares that we are all now “McFucked.” He designates Aundiose and Sarah as targets for a Lightning Attack, rolls to hit-\n\nAnd rolls a critical failure, toppling forward like a ditz and incurring an attack of opportunity from Aundiose. Aundiose promptly lays into the guy with his chain-glaive and within a turn or so has the man stunned, prone, and cruising into the criticals. A coup-de-grace from Zero tears the poor man in half.\n\nAs we bask in the glory of our slaughter, however, an acolyte pokes his head into the room. He sees his master, sundered into meaty chunks on the floor and surrounded by bloody-shirted murderers, and immediately screams for backup. In seconds, the entire cult is mobilized and charging up the spire to avenge their fallen boss. Sarah decides to send an intimidating message with Thought Send, but due to a critical failure of her own incurs nothing but psychic phenomena, shrouding the room in shadows. A magnitude-30 mob of angry cargo cultists pushes into the spire.\n\nThen all of Sarah's companions leave. First off, Gear used to have good standing with this cult and doesn't want to tarnish his reputation (or die at their hands), so he sneaks out. Aundiose, not particularly brave, also sneaks out, and despite wearing power armour even Zero manages to escape somehow. Sarah is screwed. Okay, I reason, perhaps I can make an intimidate test. Sarah fails said test miserably, instead whipping the mob into a frenzy and adding 10 additional magnitude.\n\nThe mob's first attack brings Sarah down to -2. She resists stun, thankfully, but one more good hit will kill her. Her weapon skill and ballistic skill are nothing to sneeze at, but she's not likely to do much damage to a horde with her weaponry. That leaves one path for Sarah, and thankfully it is the one she's best at: Doombolt. Sarah pulls out the stops and throws out as many Doombolts as possible. Due to her above-average willpower (52 at chargen), psy-focus, and constant push-level attacks, she can only fail if she rolls a critical fail. However, every attack prompts a psychic phenomenon. So Sarah lets loose, laying into the horde that she can barely see, and psychic phenomena begin to pile up. A faint wind begins to blow around Sarah, her voice rises into a deafening shriek, and her already-horrific visage begins to flicker with daemonic fire. All the while Sarah is shouting impotent threats and the mob is attempting to whale on her with their blades.\n\nAnd suddenly the GM rolls Grand Possession.\n\nWell, I'd been pushing for four turns at this point, so some kind of catastrophe was pretty likely. However, a Daemon Prince inhabiting my body was the worst possible outcome outside of being instantly destroyed under my own power. Admittedly, the GM is somewhat merciful, because he goes through the lists of Daemon Princes and eventually selects Goreclaw the Render, a Daemon Prince of Khorne that has 60 WP. Just barely more than Sarah. Sarah needs to resist his possession attempts for three rounds while fighting off the hordes of cultists all the while.\n\nThe cultists take their turn. They charge me. Somehow they miss. Sarah makes her first test of willpower against Goreclaw. She beats him by a degree of success. More doombolts manifest.\n\nThe cultists take another turn. They charge me. Somehow they miss. Sarah makes her second test against Goreclaw, and this time she fails. So does Goreclaw. Re-roll. Tie. Re-roll. Sarah wins. More doombolts tear into the very structure of the spire.\n\nThe cultists take their final turn. They charge. Perhaps the GM was fudging at this point, but they miss one last time. Sarah makes her final test against Goreclaw. She beats him by one degree. More doombolts hammer the cultists. Perils of the Warp is invoked!\n\nSarah is hit with Soul Sear again. Even as Goreclaw leaves her soul (inflicting 2d10 toughness damage due to his trying to possess her body), Sarah is left absolutely defenseless. No more doombolts. No more psychic phenomena. Sure as hell the cultists won't miss their attacks again. She's as good as dead.\n\nAnd then the Warp begins to laugh, and Sarah manifests a new gift from the gods. Mechanoid. Sarah's hair turns into tinsel, her skin into a protective steel casing. Her vocal chords become like guitar strings, lending a metallic resonance to her voice, and her Eyes of Chaos become solid red lenses blaring with unnatural light.\n\nThe cultists decide at this point that their former boss is not worth dying for. Mechanized goat-daemons weren't in the contract apparently. So in spite of the fact that Sarah is ultimately still helpless, they flee.\n\nSarah emerges from that tower victorious. A terrified cultist provides her with a groundcar and she's ready to take on the world. However, her companions can barely tell who she is. She wasn't human anymore. Unknown to Sarah, any chance of her getting back to her normal life had now well-and-truly been thrown away.\n\nOh well. Anyhow, we have a groundcar now. After one good Thought Sending roll, we have a driver as well. Let's go get our corpse starch. Everyone piles into the car, and we head towards the old inn. It is at this point that we notice all the mutants happily munching on corpse-starch bars. Uh oh. When we arrive at the inn, our fears are confirmed: the corpse-starch is gone. A furious Zero promptly enacts a massacre, running around and slaughtering every mutant she can see eating corpse starch. This turns out to be pretty much everyone in town, and by the time Zero's anger has burnt out pretty much anyone without a good hiding place is dead.\n\nAs we gloom about, bemoaning our lack of food, someone has the brilliant idea to head back to the Bordello. Surely they have food there. So the group drives on over and find a few survivors huddling in the wreckage. Sarah takes what little food they have, and plonks it in the backseat. We also pick up a librarian-looking mutant with a fuck-ton of eyes, who apparently wants to go where we are going. Yay! So now our car is filled with with:\n\nA scared mutant who's shit himself after seeing all of his friends murdered at the hands of his new-found benefactors,\n\nA white-blonde woman balancing a chain-blade as big as she is while talking to a book and muttering about revenge,\n\nAn obvious heretek,\n\nA hooded figure with an unholy combination of a chainsaw and a glaive balanced on his lap,\n\nThe freakish love-child of Jean Grey, the Terminator, and Satan who is currently curled up into a ball and mumbling about how she “just wants to go home,”\n\nAnd a mutant with a ton of eyes on its face hiding in the trunk.\n\nSo a pretty standard party for Black Crusade, replete with two disposable- I mean, invaluable- NPC cohorts.\n\nThe session ends shortly after the group met a Nurglite of some sort. He was this weird fuck decked out in rusty power armour, who appeared to know Aundiose somehow and burbled out his name. That was bad, and the power-fist that the Nurglite was clutching kind of made it worse. Engaging the Nurglite while the rest of us sat watching, Aundiose kicked the fuck out of the Nurglite. He managed to completely deplete the Nurglite's wounds in a single turn with his chain-glaive, but the Nurglite employs Nurgle's Blessings to fully restore his wounds. No problem, Aundiose can do that AGAIN, completely depleting the Nurglite's wounds despite needing to beat his stupidly-powerful toughness. Unfortunately, at this point the Nurglite punches him twice in the chest with the power-fist, dropping him into the criticals and requiring him to burn infamy to stay alive. Zero jumps in at this point and rips the Nurglite in half. At this point, the session ends and some extremely well-deserved XP is doled out to all.\n\nUnfortunately, the story of Sarah Mazda ends unceremoniously in the Temple of Lies. Due to an argument over the correct method of clearing out the temple, Sarah and Zero get into a fight. Sarah almost wins the fight, but due to Zero being, well, Zero, she triggers some sort of daemonic phenomena and decapitates Sarah. Her remains are buried at the foot of the Temple, and she never does return home.",

        "text": "Okay, I think I'm supposed to describe the party first, so here goes. Party of four: a Monk, a Rogue, a Fighter, and a Bard. \n\nTL;DR: Tried to make an NPC interesting, party ended up destroying the shadow of an Elder God.\n\nA couple sessions ago, they were staying at a brothel after killing the Madam and the bartender (Not as murderhobo as it sounds, trust me) and while most of them were okay with it, the Bard decides to find a real inn to stay in for the night. While there, he does his usual thing, playing songs to try and spread the word of the party's deeds. After his set, he looks around, and a small hooded gnome catches his attention. He goes over to talk to him, see if he can hit on a quest.\n\nI didn't have anything prepared (This is where the title starts coming into play) so I made the Gnome have amnesia. The Bard is overcome with pity and worry and offers to help. The Gnome tells him that he'd heard Troll's blood had amazing regenerative properties, and that a group of wizards nearby were capturing trolls and draining them of their blood to sell off. The next day, the Bard comes back to the rest of the party, to the haunted looks of the new Madam and the Fighter, as the Rogue and about ten prostitutes of various races and genders follow (I'll admit, I overreacted to the player's request for \"a few prostitutes\"). The Monk comes back in from sleeping in the wagon they bought, and the Bard relays the details and off they go.\n\nThey get into the cave, and after making their way past a Spectator and a puzzle, they find a few of the wizards studying in a small library they brought in, and two of them in the process of tying a Troll down and beginning the process of draining it's blood. Now incensed, they proceed to murder all the wizards and set the Troll and it's three friends from their cramped cages. The Trolls are appreciative and the players take a barrel of Troll's blood with them back to the Gnome. They give him a vial of it (all he needs) and the Gnome proceeds to drink it down regaining his memories.\n\nMemories returning, fear crosses the Gnome's face and he races off screaming a name, and saying he has to save his wife. The party, after trying to get the gold for the blood, realize that he's too distraught to pay them, so they try and find a way to bring him home...to the other side of the continent. They seek the aid of the headmaster of the local mage's college, with whom they have a good rapport. He helps them after a night of smoking weed with the Fighter teleporting them across the continent to the city of Morvendal.\n\nThey appear in front of the city in a heap and, after dusting themselves off, follow the Gnome to his home. Inside, they find that a few things are off. Most importantly that the Gnome's wife is here, safe and sound. After some investigation, they attempt to read the wife's mind, which is when she reveals that she is actually a doppelganger and attacks them. The party kills her and leave the grieving Gnome alone.\n\nAs they explore the city, they discover that people are losing their memories a lot here, usually the sailors. Investigating further, they find that it's happening to people who sail into a strange purple fog that's been off the coast of the city for about a hundred years now. The people have been able to mostly avoid it recently, and they never lose more than a day of memory so the people of Morvendal have learned to just live with it. The party returns to the Gnome to ask him a few more questions and find him shaking on the ground of his bakery (The Gnome was a baker) with his eyes solid black, and muttering.\n\nThe Fighter slaps the Gnome to try and shock him back to normal, but he's only pulled in to the Gnome's vision. He finds himself on a small island made of volcanic rock with a floating mirror facing him. The island is shrouded in the same fog that is currently off the coast. In the mirror, the Fighter sees the face of an Elder God who identifies himself as Mon'Dai.\n\nThe party decides to deal with the fog now that they have a lead on how to get rid of it. After securing payment for dealing with it and renting a boat, hiring a crew, gearing up, etc. They head into the fog to try and deal with it. Once inside the fog, a light begins to shine off to their right, cutting through the fog. The party have some sea charts that point to an island straight ahead however, and decide to investigate there first. \n\nOn the island, the Fighter notices that this one is too big to be the one from his vision. They investigate anyway, combing over the island. Through the fog, they notice some small forms. They identify the forms as seagulls and the Fighter decides to shoot some of them (which is a thing he does often) and they hear little squawks of seagull death as the ones remaining fly off. They try to shoot these as well and knock one of them into the water. Unbeknownst to them, this disturbs the creature that lives on this island. While they investigate the seagulls, which have become warped by the fog, the creature sneaks around behind them. The Fighter and the Monk notice a slithering sound and the Fighter turns around and shoots a crossbow bolt at the creature, beginning the fight. During the fight, the Bard goes down to 1 (Would've been unconscious, but Half-Orc, yay!) but the party manages to prevail!\n\nThey spend the next hour gathering meat and organs from the creature (A Drakon from the Kobold Press Tome of Beasts) and investigating the birds further. Their eyes have becomes red and glowing...and doubled in amount. The feathers are pitch black and cling to the skin. I probably did a better job DM'ing it than I am writing this story, because they were extremely weirded out and tense at this point. They head back to the ship, where they find the crew under attack by several Quasits.\n\nTwo of the crew members are already dead, and one of them is facing two Quasits at the same time. The party charges in to help, defeating most of the Quasits (and losing another crew member to friendly fire) before three more Quasits materialize out of the fog. They handle them as well and head off towards the light in the fog.\n\nHere, they find the actual island with the mirror on it. As they approach, four beams of golden light shoot out and hit their heads. The players find themselves now trapped in the worlds within their minds, and someone appears to them, a disembodied voice for some, an old friend for others. This person asks them for a favor. If they kill their friends, the person promises them power to do whatever their individual goals are. All of the players turn down the offer and begin resisting, trying to fight free of the mental hold on them. None of them knew what the others were saying by the way, I made sure of that. Now free, they've stunned Mon'Dai in the mirror, and the Fighter shoots it. Shattering the mirror into a million pieces. As they stand there in shock, sunlight finally pierces the fog, and it is completely burned away within minutes as a divine wind blows the dust left by the mirror away.\n\nThe party finds the remaining crew members on the boat, memories gone. After explaining the situation to the crew, they sail back into Morvendal and collect their prizes: 5000gp and one magical item each. This whole adventure spanning about a month and a half of almost-weekly sessions, all because I wanted to make an NPC kind of interesting and made something up on the spot.\n\nEDIT: Spell checking",

        "text": "When the stars align, my brothers and some friends of ours get a chance to rp. This time around we were playing Wild Hunt, a 1 sheet Savage Worlds adventure. I wanted to share a highlight of the evening. There is 1 very minor spoiler about the fate of Father NPC.\n\nBasically, it was getting late so we glossed over combat with a chase scene. \n\nThe party consisted of the following motley crew: Drew Cephalis, a frat boy with a wicked arm and team spirit that killed a wicked hound with a wicked football; Hingle McGringleberry, a perceptive but illiterate, down-on-his-luck member of the Conservative Party of Canada armed with only a McDonald’s gift card, some blow, and a crowbar; Mrs. Rita Hobblesworth, a geriatric Christian occultist riding the greyhound to go visit her grandson. \n\nAnd so it begins…\n\nAfter leaving the church, Drew hopped on his bicycle; the wheels still hot from being stolen from the storage shed down below. \n\n“Come on guys! We can do it if we all think positive!” he urged, “Hey! Ho! Here we go! Victory for you and me! We can do it, if we try! Spartans! Spartans! Do or die!” \n\nThe sleeve of his bunny hug slipped down his wrist, as he punched the air.\n\nRita cautiously positioned herself near the back of the banana seat, clutched her rosary, and started praying to a God who could not answer her.\n\nHingle jumped onto the handlebars, readying the rifle he purchased with 28 dollars of McDonalds gift card and a baggie of coke.\n\nThe heroes said their thank you’s and goodbyes to the priest. What followed was a dreadful howling froze the midnight air.\n\nThe cry of the damned was met with a squealing of rubber as Drew peeled out of the broken parking lot. \n\nTheir  bicycle bouncing along the cracks in the ancient pavement.\n\nRita felt her arthritis flare up as they rattled away from the gore.\n\nHingle’s feet hung in the gloom, swinging above a whirling tire. He heard the gravel dancing and the soft click of a new clip.\nThe hope was shattered as Rita let out a cry; Several hounds fell upon the priest.\n\n“Fly, you fools!” he cried, as the hounds tore into him. Never had a church been more disgraced as this church, as arcs of crimson sprayed the heavy oaken doors as if this Exodus was from Egypt itself.\n\nDrew pedaled as he never pedaled before. Truly, he never felt a pump more sick.\n\nHingle swiveled on the handle bars and opened shot. With a soft pop, the first hound collapsed.\n\nRita continued to pray.\n\n“Hold on bros!” exclaimed Drew, as he hit a rough patch while barreling downhill. Hingle swiveled yet again, keeping his buttocks weighted against the fishtail, as the bicycle carved deeply into the moss and muck of the forest floor.\n\nThe hounds pressed on, snapping at the back tires.\n\nHingle took some branches to the face but held fast to the handlebars.\n\nIn a moment, Drew pulled both hands from the handlebars to light and lob a Molotov, crisping yet another hound.\n\nHingle was not to be upstaged. He lazily threw his rifle over his shoulder and opened up shot; another hound dropped.\n\nThey escaped the hounds, and steered into a profane graveyard. \n\nTwilight was full. \n\nThe air was getting cooler. \n\nNo amount of salt, prayers, or grace, could prepare them for what was to come.\n\nFin\n",

        "text": "Rumors were abound through The Empire. A boat full of skeletons had reached harbor in the capital, and more than a few were curious what it meant. After all, its not like there were skeletons just laying around for necromancers to raise, or that necromancers themselves were a common sight. Either way it was as good a cause as any to launch an exploratory expedition, and soon enough a mass campaign to reestablish contact with the Old Continent was announced. Three grand waves of ships were to set out, the First Wave to scout and find a place to land, the Second Wave to secure a foothold and base of operations for The Empire, as well as begin searching the Old Continent to see what happened while the heirs to the Empire were gone, and just what the Great King did when he died, and the Third Wave to set up a proper colony in this new old world. Our party today was on the first wave, thanks to the sponsorship of some noble who's name has been \\*ahem* lost to the history books. He was looking for heirs, and figured rando adventures would be better heirs than whoever else he had in the family. \n\nFirst up, we have Devon. A rather normal Human Thief, he grew up as minor nobility until the guards killed his parents, his older brothers disappeared, and he starting running with a gang on the streets. Our Noble Antony-or-whoever offered Devon reinstatement as a noble in exchange for the simple task of heading off to a continent that has been mysteriously out of contact for a few hundred (Thousand? The details were fuzzy.) years. Not one to jump at the chance to lead, he nonetheless was still willing (and able!) to organize a small group and interact with higher-ups. He had no idea what he was in for.\n\nNext up, we have Lhoita. This monk can from a monastery high up in the mountains, and saw this expedition as a chance to get out into the world, do good, and show her stuffy elders that taking action is better than just meditating all day. Fairly standard stuff. Other than being a walking, talking cat taken from her forest tribe at a young age, at least.\n\nThird up is Piper. She seemed more or less normal for a human gunslinger when all the others were either dwarves or weird. Hell, she was even quite charismatic when others interested in her craft had been known to be somewhat standoffish. But Piper had a secret. She was a cat. But not just a cat, a *shapeshifting* cat. But not just a shapeshifting cat, a shapeshifting cat *princess*, whether she liked it or not. Hailing from the Catsune Kingdom to the west, Piper was looking for adventure and a way out from her unloving parents and various multitude of older, more well-liked siblings.\n\nLast up, we have a stowaway. Formerly a slave to one of the last remaining red dragons, Illia had hidden away on the boat with her new fox companion Renard to try and hide from the dragon's wrath. She was too young for the captain to be willing to just toss her overboard, and Bernie, Noble Anderson-or-whoever's liaison for the party, convinced the captain to let Illia stay as part of the adventuring party. Devon was promised a lot more allies to accompany him anyway, so this was a start. \n\nCan you sense a theme yet? Because it's catgirl harem. In theory, Illia was supposed, at some point, merge with Renard I think to become a foxgirl or something. I can't quite remember how we were going to accomplish that. \n\nStill, the stage had been set, the actors chosen, and Devon was picked out as the unsuspecting leader of the new group of would-be heroes and legends. It was the end of a three month boat trip, so everyone had plenty of time to get to know each other and were ready to get out and stretch their legs. Upon landing at the chosen beach site, the group met up with the other groups in the first wave: Merc Company, Other-Noble, the Dwarves, and the one that got left to guard the beach. Initial findings didn't seem too promising, the only signs of civilization found were a crumbling watch tower on the beach, and the evidence of a relatively recent fire inside of the ruin. The three groups that got the chance to explore and find glory split up among the available cardinal directions and headed out. Our party chose... East I think. East or South. By the time afternoon was getting on, the party had found something to investigate: what looked to be a fort under construction by skeletons and constructs. After a quick check to make sure that this was not just an unusual method the locals had to dispose of their dead, it was fight time!\n\n[To Be Continued]",

        "text": "So I just ran my first session of Rogue Trader yesterday and it went beautifully. If you need a reminder of who the party is or don’t know who they are I would suggest reading up here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/5163kw/rogue_trader_the_beginning_of_a_series_of/\n\nSo the party's ship exits out of the warp and I have them all introduce themselves to one another. Some give their life stories while others are like \"I'm here to kill shit. That's all.\" After they were done introducing themselves one of the tech-adepts on the ship approached them, alerting them off something out in the distance. The party decided to go off and investigate the strange object.\n\nApproaching it they discovered that it was this large, cone shaped space station. The station itself is an oddity, almost flesh like in its appearance with a faint thumping sound resonating through the entire station. Deploying 100 guardsmen and themselves they head to the station to investigate it. Entering the hanger bay, they find nothing of importance besides a set of doors that leads into a room containing two large holes in the ground with a rail system running down and a stair case. The decision is made to send a group of 15 guardsmen and the eldar outcast down the stairs to scout. \n\nAnd this is where everything starts to plummet. The room the eldar finds himself and the guardsmen in is a rather plain one, looking exactly like the one above them with the exception of a stair case going up, the hole in the ground with a rail system and a door leading to other rooms. One of the guardsmen peers over the hole to see how far it goes down and next thing that happens is he’s tackled by a hullghast (a rather nasty mutant that loves to chew on human flesh). Shambling out of the darkness of the room are about 30 more of them and thus combat begins. \n\nThe hullghast’s get within melee range, a few cut down by the NPC guardsmen and Eldar Outcast before it’s a flurry of teeth and claws. Some of the NPC’s go down and the eldar manages to avoid being hit. Hearing the commotion, the rest of the part decides to make their way down with the exception of the Arch-Militant and Rogue Trader, who want to arrive in ‘style’. So arriving next to the combat is the astropath, seneschal and navigator.\n\nWith the 2nd turn of combat beginning the navigator goes first and he decides to open his third eye. Now for those of you who don’t know what happens when a navigator opens his third eye I’ll put it like this. He can melt people’s brains by overloading it with Warp Energy. To resist looking into his third eye one has to make an opposed WP test against him and if he warns people ahead of time they’re able to get a +30 bonus to resist it.\n\nWell both the npc guardsmen and Eldar fail their tests, even with the warning, while the hullghast’s passed the test and ignored him. With that being said the navigator ended up killing six of the 15 guardsmen and dropping the eldar to negative one. If you think this is horrible, it gets much, MUCH worse.\n\nNext in the combat turn is the astropath who attempts to use his powers to make the hullghast’s minds explode (literally) and was convinced by the party to push his powers. When pushing a psychic power, a psychic phenomenon is caused. Usually this is somewhat aesthetic things that happen (food spoiling, frost covering people) unless you roll a 75 or higher and guess what he rolled. Yup, that’s right he rolled over a 75, causing a Peril of the Warp. This is when all the psychic energy a psyker has gathered has back lashed into something horrific. His result? The warp opening up and daemons trying to drag him into and deposited him back into real space 4 weeks later on an inhabited planet with a load of corruption point. Seeing as it was this players first time actually playing I decided to give him a free reroll so that he wouldn’t be scared away from the game. With his free reroll he ended up losing the use of his powers for an hour and gaining 4 corruption points.\n\nAs the combat raged on the Arch-Millitant and Rogue Trader decided to make their grand entrance by parkour their way down to the second level. The Arch-Militant made it while the Rogue Trader herself failed and found herself hanging by an edge as the rest of the party cleaned up the horde of Hullghast’s without any more casualties on the party or their crew. None the less the Arch-Militant wasn’t happy that they lost several guardsmen and that it was the Navigator that caused the most deaths amongst the crew. They had the NPC tech-adept patch up the eldar. \n\nThe next part will cover the rest of the exploration of the Silver Station.\n",

        "text": "We begin our tale as usual with an introduction to the party:\n\nTik Ulf Sommer (Skitnig) and Tok Rolf Winter (Skiven) Ratfolk Twins, Blackjack Mercenary Fighters with a penchant for fake names, gold and reach weapons. Also have Ratfolk Tailblades, as is custom for their kin. During exploration and combat they basically always share the same space and attack at the same time.   \nAlaton, Half-Elf Gunslinger. This player always plays either an elf or a half-elf and has perfected the art of snobish ignorance towards lesser people by now.   \nArtusk, Tiefling Rogue and master of stealth. Played by someone who basically always plays rogues. Had some nice jokes about his demonn dad. The player was gone for a while and our GM kidnapped his character to have some sort of consistency. Being the greedy idiots that we are, nobody followed the lead to save the kidnapped party member and he had to save himself. Thanks to some GM shenanigans during that encounter his eyes now permanently detect magic.   \nAnd finally me: Toruk Stonesmasher, 12th son of the Stonesmasher-Clan, thrown out of his home mountain by his parents for being a disgrace to the clan. Not only is he not grumpy, like a real dwarf should be, no, his favored weapon is a bow. A BOW!!! The hated \"weapon\" of war used by the age old enemy, the elves. Toruk is a Zen Archer, a battle monk that seeks enlightment by turning his enemies into porcupines. Since he is the son of a rich family, he has hired a butler who is responsible for driving his wagon, setting up the tents and preparing tea. Lots of tea.\n\nAnyways, onto the story: We were on a dungeon crawl for nearly two days in game time (and 2 months of real time because of holidays and scheduling conflicts) and finally found something good: A weapon chamber, still fully stocked! After some looking and looting (the ratfolk immediately grabbed any silver weapon that they could get their grubby little paws on) we reconvened at the entrance and where about to leave. Thanks to a well rolled perception check, Toruk sees a small glimmer in the air beyond the door, like the distortion above a very hot fire.   \nHe mentions it to his party members, one of which immediately panics. Skitnig tackles the torch that is currently being held by Alaton the gunslinger, screaming something about gas and puts it out. Before anyone else can react, Alaton is suddenly engulfed by the Gelatinous Cube^tm that rushed through the door.\n\nThe fight begins, with the ratfolk retreating to a safe distance (10 feet, so that they could stab the Ooze with their spears), Toruk closely evading an attack of opportunity while retreating to the other end of the room 25 feet away and shooting a single arrow and Artusk being surprised. Alaton begins to suffocate in the Ooze, while being paralyzed for 12 rounds. The Ooze moves to attack the ratfolk twins, engulfing but not paralyzing one of them and impaling itself on their weapons in the process.   \nFrantic, the engulfed ratling tries to tear himself free from the Ooze, but fails. His brother tries to pull him out, but the hold the cube has on him is to strong. Toruk prepares to fire a volley of arrows into the Gelatinous Cube, carefully avoiding the spots where it holds Alaton and Skitnig, but instead his precious bow reaches the end of it's lifespan and breaks in his hands (Praised be you, natural one!). Artusk fires his light bow at the Gelatinous Cube and deals some damage, while Alaton panics and tries to breath, getting a mouth full of acid for his troubles (Another natural one).   \nSkitnig finally manages to pull himself out of his predicament and the ratfolk attack again, with Skitnig being badly wounded. The dwarven archer drops the remains of his bow and pulls out his new silver masterwork warhammer while running for the Ooze, oaths of rage spewing from his lips, his equilibrium being lost with his bow. Artusk runs forward and impales the Cube on his rapier, while the Ooze starts to advance on the ratfolk twins and the enraged dwarf, with Alaton suffocating inside it. Throwing caution to the wind, Skitnig and Toruk meet it's charge, readying their weapons for a final blow. The hit caused by Skitnigs Bardiche is to much for the Gelatinous Cube and it's body can no longer sustain its form, slowly turning into a puddle of acid on the floor with Alaton in the middle of it. The hammer blow of the dwarf on the other hand hits Skitnig square in the chest and throws him to the ground and into unconciousness (Getting sick of you fortuna, something positive would be great for a change!). Both unconcious people are pulled out of the small pool of acid and resuscitation work begins. In his hurry to help Alaton, Artuks accidentally pulls out a mystery potion instead of the potion of cure light wounds that he intended to grab and instilled it into Alaton.\n\nThe Gunslingers veins glow in an eerie green light allover his body with a green ring forming on the pinky of his left hand. Some initial confusion follows, until it is discovered that this was indeed not a potion of cure light wounds and that the bottle has a small note attached with draconic writing on it: “Keep wearing the ring.” The glow subsides and Alaton is breathing again, although he is still unconscious and badly wounded. While Toruk and Artusk tended to Alaton, Skiven woke up his brother, the two already looking for the metallic loot swimming in the acidic pool.\n\nWith the immediate danger passed and Alaton in the hands of Artusk, the better medic of the two, Toruk wanders of to apologize to Skitnig for the beating and to find a new bow in the weapons chamber. Through an incredible streak of luck he stumbles upon a lead-lined chest in corner and pulls out a Composite Longbow with the exact same feel as his old one. “That's magic!”, Artusk called over from his medic duties (rolled another natural one, but on percentile dice, which is bloody good!).   \nAlaton awakes after another couple of potions, looking horribly ruffled and without any idea what was going on. After being brought up to speed he looks around and sees a new ring on his finger. Before anybody can react, he pulls it off his finger and terrible pain wrecks his body while he drops into unconsciousness again (not his lucky day, obviously...). After some pokes with the newly acquired wand of cure light wounds (one of the ratfolk found it previously and hid it in his backpack without telling anyone, greedy little bastards) he awakes again and demands to know what is going on. After some brilliantly baffling bullshit from Artusk he believes that his blood turned to acid thanks to all the acid he accidentally imbibed while being engulfed by the Gelatinous Cube (truth is, we still don't know exactly what happened).\n\nWith that we finally call it a day and leave the dungeon, heading for our base camp.\n\n*****\n\nI am trying to improve my writing and critic and suggestions for improvement would be very helpful. Writing in present tense was new to me, so if you have anything to say about it, please do! And sorry for forgetting to tag it with the system in the title, I forgot. It's Pathfinder.",

        "text": "[Once upon a time, in a fantasy world filled with inane hogwash](https://redd.it/4yjqtr), a group of three adventurers was having a quiet moment of rest and contemplation- Wait, wrong campaign. In THIS campaign, a band of three vaguely-heroic adventurers take on the much-maligned mantle of mayhem, mischief, and malarky. And property damage.\n\nSpeaking of property damage, meet our wonderful party- that of [Jello Shot the slime magus of cannon-wielding doom](http://i.imgur.com/IiL7PFg.png), [Cinder Sparks the incredibly unsettling and constantly on fire changeling oracle](http://i.imgur.com/Emday0T.jpg), and [Ling Ling, the one who actually had a sense of consequence and a moderately-functional brain](http://i.imgur.com/2SwMf0l.png). These three individuals are trying to find a nice, easy mission to get Cinder used to strange foibles of working alongside people who could actually take care of themselves after being set on fire, although they would prefer not to have to. And in keeping with this concept of an 'easy' mission, they picked a target that they wouldn't mind fucking destroying with extreme prejudice.\n\nThey whipped out their departed friend Loki's contact book, found the black market, and tracked down the location of the local Hippogriff mill where Ling Ling's traumatized mount came from. Then, they were going to go inside, murder everyone remotely connected with the animal abuse, release the animals, and burn the fucker to the ground.  ^^By ^^which ^^I ^^mean ^^sell ^^it ^^to ^^a ^^slightly ^^more ^^responsible ^^criminal ^^organization Point was, they wouldn't have any qualms about turning the people running it into a cloud of radioactive meat-vapor.\n\nAfter nailing down its location, the party fell upon the facility with a vengeance. Cinder was sent in as a distraction, which she managed by crying and acting like a small child before melting the faces off of the various people preparing to capture and enslave her. Jello Shot capitalized on this by firing a seige cannon into the front of the building, completely wrecking the facade and opening a direct path into the head office. Ling Ling accompanied Cinder in the front door of the building while Jello Shot worked upwards. Jello Shot ran into a hostile bard that screamed him out of the building, and Ling Ling encountered a nasty cavalier with her own personal griffin mount. However, no amount of screaming can protect you from a pissed-off ballistic glob of man-eating gelatin wielding a cannon, and no amount of fancy armor and mounted combat training can prepare you for a barrage of bullets and a scorching ray fired directly into your visor. The party survived the encounter with minimal injuries, pausing only when a distressed 'workman' turned out to be a rogue that drew his knife a little too soon and was plasted to pieces almost instantly.\n\nLing Ling, feeling satisfied with the general situation, decided to personally adopt the two most abused critters in the whole horrible place- another hippogriff, and the cavalier's own personal Griffin that was mentally whipped so hard it was nearly a machine. Then, they proceeded to gift-wrap the place for their criminal contacts, pick up a hefty sum of money, and bid them all a fond adieu, with a promise that they could *very definitely* come back at any time and enact another change of management with even more violent, splattery methods. You know, in case they got any ideas about *continuing to abuse the goddamn hippogriffs*.\n\nThat all done and taken care of, the party decided to take a nice stroll to break in their new pets and learn a few things about their new companions. Turns out Cinder had a pretty rough life, being a changeling and a fire oracle complete with curses. Her dad always told her to hide her powers and act normal, but that never really worked out, one thing led to another, massive fires, property damage, on the run from the police, lived in the woods for three years, adopted, house fire, camping, rinse, repeat, despair. And all of this apparently the fault of her crazy bloodline and Hag mother, whom Cinder had never met.\n\nThe party shook their heads ruefully and concluded that yes, that was pretty fucked up, and damn the girl was unlucky, but hey, at least she wasn't Emil.\n\nWhereupon [Emil the hilariously unlucky Syrinx](http://i.imgur.com/LkinvPf.png) fell out of the sky and landed face-first on the dirt road, his limbs twisting into interesting and improbable shapes.\n\nThis was the harbinger of some minor combat involving a trio of assassins, who were firmly routed when it turned out that poisoned blowdarts don't work on people made of acidic, face-dissolving slime and people who can turn into fire elementals when angry. When combat wrapped on up, they took a look at the wounded Emil, who true to form, had just narrowly escaped death-by-assassin by trading it off for death-by-faceplant-and-then-assassin. Well, since the danger had passed, the party decided to 'help', and because Ling Ling was struggling with the idea of getting the party to do absolutely goddamn anything that wasn't borderline sociopathic, 'helping' devolved into 'flinging the poor, concussed bird-man around like a ragdoll on the stage of Weekend at Bernie's'. When Emil finally came to consciousness, he was none too happy with his new bruise, concussion, claw-mark and burn collection, and as a bit of petty revenge, idly wished Cinder and her flame-happy ways some \"good luck\".\n\nNow, when a man whose bad luck is so intense that it's *literally sapient* wishes you good fortune, it can only ever, ever, EVER mean bad things. And the omens of ill fortune came a-charging down the path, clomping away on horseback and making Cinder go rigid with fear. Because she had just run afoul of the Witch Hunters, a special branch of the human fighting force dedicated to hunting down and exterminating supernatural threats to the human order, like monstrous spellcasters, people accused of witchcraft, hags, daughters of hags, and people who, for instance, were directly responsible for the arson of about 40 different houses dotted around the comet's countryside.\n\nOh yeah. And Cinder's Father was leading the expedition.\n\nCinder promptly went fetal, and Jello Shot was given the ungainly task of hiding her underground in a pit and then plugging up the top with a bit of patented Ling Ling ranger magic. Ling Ling, still a bit banged up from the encounter with the assassins, stayed on the road so that the oncoming Witch Hunters wouldn't start poking around in inconvenient places. The witch hunters interrogated her, and she answered all their questions in a zone of truth with *literal* precision, sliding over unimportant issues like 'seeing any small, fire-prone children about' and keeping the topic firmly on Emil, his incredible bad luck, and the attempt on his life. Cinder's Father accepted this explanation, then proceeded to give an entirely unasked-for triade about Hags, Witches, Oracles, Spellcasters, and their various spawn of evil, which could pretend to be good but would only bring misery to the world and should be executed just to be safe. While Cinder was listening. Traumatized, betrayed, and afraid.\n\n*Cinder was not having a good time, is what I'm saying.*\n\nThe lecture eventually wrapped up with nobody tied to a stake and... well, probably not burned, considering the circumstances, but likely some other grisly fortune ANYWAY nobody got lynched or was caught out in a lie, so the Witch Hunters thanked Ling Ling for her time and proceeded to ride off into the sunset to go murder some people in the name of humanity. Seriously fuck humans. Everything done, they bade Emil farewell, pulled Cinder out of her twitching stupor, and proceeded to ride home in generally iffy spirits.\n\nThat night, Cinder dreamed about setting the world ablaze, unable to control the power coursing through her, and powerless to stop her transformation. She dreamt of the hags, gathered in a coven, watching, waiting, scheming... And for some reason, bickering about whose turn it was to host the potluck.\n\n------\n\n*Far away, in another world, a scheming Lich finally hits on the way out of his otherworldly imprisonment. Soon, vengeance will be his...*",

        "text": "So I'm in a campaign run by my roommate, and he wrote this campaign for another party that is playing at the same time as us (awesomely, it even happens at the same time roughly, and after I move out this fall I'll be switching parties). His older brother is in the other campaign and is playing an autistic half-lizard half-orc with an Int of 5 who thinks all elves are a scourge upon society and must be wiped out.\n\nNeedless to say, the campaign is built to tolerate some stupidity; however, sometimes people just don't get the hint to stop being idiots. Especially when the tutorial inn for my party was the inn owned by this half-lizard half-orc, and three of us are wood elves (the fourth is a half elf and the fifth is a deep gnome). In our first session, we almost lost a character because he was insulted by Chunndar's racism and decided to storm back into the now-closed inn to confront him. Somehow, he managed to survive breaking in -- a level 1 character vs a door trapped with two level 3 spells don't mix too well -- and then got one-hit by the elf-hater's semi-sentient blade. Thankfully, he was soon revived so we didn't have to make him a new character.\n\nSession two was when things got terribly more interesting. I play a Wood Elf Rogue, and had decided that I wasn't going back to that inn if I could help it; unfortunately, one of our party members was being accused of a murder and our only lead was in there, so I had to go back and risk death-by-future-party-member. So we get back, and I go upstairs after getting a room to investigate the occupants up there, leaving my merry band of idiots behind to amuse themselves. After going through the rooms, I found a woman crying and tried to push her for information -- she left her elf-loving husband to pursue Chunndar, and had been rejected by the lizard -- and she ended up discovering my ears under the hood after a nat 1 Persuasion roll. Panicked for my life, I slit her throat and hid the body, leaping off the balcony and fleeing the town (It all worked out and the other party's Drow Wizard helped me frame the husband for 75 GP).\n\nWhile I was out of town, so to speak, the elf who got killed in our first session (Ranger) and our alcoholic deep gnome Bard named Ronald Drumph (Make D&amp;D Great Again!) bought 25 bottles of a special Drow Bloodwine made from the blood of an adult black dragon. The ranger, upset with being discriminated against, decided along with the bard to try and catch the inn on fire by lighting 18 bottles' worth of drink in the corner. This is when my DM got sick of their shit.\n\nThe inn is magically protected by the drow, and is specifically protected against fire. It turns out that the reaction between these protections, the dragon blood, and the fire accidentally summoned a minor demon and its mount, a black dragon wyrmling, from the Infernal Plane.",

During the session they had to travel through a \"Valley of death\" part of the desert. Crossing the whole valley takes about 2 weeks ingame time and there is only a single small oasis right in the middle where travellers can rest.\n\nThe Group already spend a week trying not to die through sandstorms, bandits or thirst. So when they see buildings at the horizon they became significantly excited.\nRight before the next Sandstorm hit they arrived at the place. Its a walled in trading post who also has a small Tavern in the middle. The Place is run by a middle aged man, Abdul Hassan, and his family. Abdul is described as rather bulky for his age.

We're already on good terms with said dragon due to dispatching a revenant in a tub of tar (don't ask), along with other tasks.\n\nAs a reward for trapping the revenant, the dragon gave us a bag with our reward. As this dragon was rich as can be (he literally EATS GOLD AND JEWELS), we were initially very excited. Well, we were until we opened the bag.\n\n14 lesser gems, about 50 gold each, totaling 700. Disappointed but eager to move onwards, the rest of the party was ready to leave the city after selling the gems. I, however, was not content with my lot and cooked up a plan. \n\nMe: \"Guys, let me sell the gems. Maybe I can get a better price.\"\n\nSo Gideon and Lionel went to the jewelers stand in the market, hoping to maybe get a slightly better bang for our buck. How our GM wanted our haggling to work was to name our price and roll Persuasion, so I named my price.\n\nMe: \"250. Each.\" \n\nEryn's player messaged me at that point with \"$_$\". I held my breath and rolled.\n\nOf course I rolled a 20, guys. With my bonus in Persuasion it came out to 30. The merchant literally could not hope to roll against that. 3500 gold for 700gp worth of gems. But we're not done here.\n\nDue to not having much gold on his person, he instead gave us a 1000gp gem and a solid gold music box worth 2500. GM hinted that the dragon loved music boxes, so back to the dragon we went.\n\nThe dragon, of course, was ecstatic that we found a music box. We thanked him for his earlier generosity with the gems, and asked if he would want to make a deal for the music box. GM asked us to name our price again, thinking we got what we wanted and would go for 3000.\n\nEryn's player kept messaging \"$$$$_$$$$ 6000. 6000. 6000. 6000. 6000.\" So I settled on a reasonable price.\n\n7000.\n\nThere was no way I was getting away with this. The GM was actively protesting, everyone was laughing. I rolled.\n\n28 Persuasion, out of a possible 30. \n\nDragon rolled Insight, got a 4.\n\nDue to the massive screwy-ness I was pulling, the GM had the dragon agree to 6500 instead of 7000. We walked away and divvied out the profits equally, which came to 92 platinum and 214 gold per player (out of 7). This is not including the money I made performing at the local bars, earning about 75 gold a night.\n\nBards are the best. What do I do with all this cash, guys?",

The discuss what to do about the MISSING GUARDS posters around town, the corrupt guards they killed in the secret prison. Corrin suggests that maybe the other Blackfist Guards didn't know about the secret prison but Mitch thinks they just put the posters up to cover themselves if the truth ever gets out. Conspiracy!\n\nMitch then hands out a pair of tentacle creature hide blade boots for Corrin and Zing. \"I made new boots for all six of us!\"\n\nAnyway as they sit down for breakfast Sam the Goblin walks over and passes them a note. The note was given to him by a platinum haired boy. The note reads: -\n\"Your actions have consequences.\n\nThe closure of Madame Freona’s Tea Kettle is your fault. The Captain of the Black Fist Guard will not tolerate violence in her city, especially in a public place. Witnesses verified your story this time but next time, there may be none. Next time I cannot protect you.\n\nYou must be subtler lest you make more enemies, powerful enemies. Your job here has only just begun. Evil is growing in Phlan and you must remain wary, and be ready when the time comes.\n\nHave patience, we will meet face to face again.\n\nThe Paladin\"\n\n\"Meet face to face AGAIN?!\" says Zing. \"What does that mean?!\"\n\n\"I knew we shouldn't have stopped asking everyone we met if they were the Paladin!\" says Corrin.\n\nMitch notices a pair of female Blackfist Guards sitting at a table. He heads over to the bar, buys a couple of drinks and walks over to the seated guards.\n\"My condolences for your loss.\" says Mitch, plunking down the drinks.\n\n\"Condolences?!\" says one of the guards. \"That implies they're dead! Do you know something we don't?!\"\n\n\"Err...Umm.. No it's just when people go missing they usually wind up dead!\" stammers Mitch.\n\n\"It can also mean they went AWOL!\"\n\n\"My friend didn't mean anything by it. I'm Zing. Were they friends of yours?\" asks the gnome trying to diffuse the situation.\n\nCorrin wisely stays seated at his table.\n\n\"Names Keria and this is Aravele. Not really, honestly they weren't liked much, especially Gunner Storm.\" replies the guard.\n\"Why is that?\" asks Mitch\n\n\"Because he was a no good cheating son of a bitch, always cheated at cards.\" says Aravele.\n\nThe talk turns to gambling and eventually Mitch and Zing return to their table.\n\nBANG! The door is violently thrown open as a half-dozen burly drunk dockworkers barge in. They seem quite angry. Without sparing anybody a glance, they march towards the two Blackfist Guards moping over their drinks.\n\n“Your friends in the Keep are costing us work! Where are they hiding?” bellows one to the guards at the table.\n\n“Sod off, Thirus,” Keria growls; obviously in no mood for a chat, “Crawl back into the hole you came from before you and your friends get hurt.”\nMitch decides to interject and asks what happened.\n\nThirus explains that the light house beacon has gone out and ships will be unable to enter the Bay of Phlan it night or during foul weather without it. It will delay the loading and offloading of cargo by the dock workers. Thirus demands that the guards do something about it but Keria tells them that Lieutenant Grimm and his men are stationed on the Thorn Island where the lighthouse is located, and they'll fix it when they can. Thirus is none too happy and it looks like several of his friends are itching for a fight.\n\nEither heeding The Paladin's note or just trying to work an angle the trio offer to help the dockworkers. Thirus is pleased but can't offer much in the way of payment. At this point Corrin chimes in and begins to ask about excess cargo that occasionally goes missing. Zing then suggests maybe they can get the dockworkers to help repair the Lyceum of the Black Lord. Eventually Mitch asks for an undisclosed favor at a later date. Desperate to return to paying work, the dockworkers agree. Thirus tells them to talk to the ferryman Karst who can give them a lift to Thorn Island which is off the coast of Phlan.\n\nThe trio approach the two guards and ask about the lighthouse. They tell them that the lighthouse is run by House Sokol and that Blackfist Guards are stationed there to protect it from attack by pirates. The current roster is Lieutenant Grimm and five of his men. Sokol Keep is maintained by a family of caretakers and the current lord, a young man named Ignan Sokol.\n\nCorrin, Mitch and Zing arrive at the dock and find Karst, a crusty old sailor. \n\n\"Karst, is Sokol Keep haunted?\" ask Zing.\n\n\"Define haunted?\" replies Karst. \n\nZing give him a look. \n\n\"Yeah well I hear stories of object getting knocked over, strange noises, the usual stuff. I would be more worried about the sharks in the bay! So keep your extremities inside the boat. Hand goes in the water. Shark's in the water. Lots of sharks.\"\n\nMitch is about to comment and notices Karst's hook hand.\n\nAs they sail across to the island Zing decides to drag one of the Blackfist Guard tunics he took from the dead guards in the secret prison into the water.\n\n\"Hey what are you doing?\" whispers Mitch.\n\n\"Trying to attract sharks.\" replies Zing.\n\n\"Why? I mean wait, is that a Blackfist Guard tunic?\" asks the dwarf.\n\n\"Yeah.\" \n\n\"How many do you have?!\"  \n\n\"Five.\" replies Zing, pulling out another four from his backpack.\n\n\"Are you nuts?! What if we get caught with those?!\" exclaims Mitch trying not to raise his voice\n\n\"I thought we could use them as a disguise?\"\n\n\"Disguise?! How by having you gnomes and Corrin stand on each other's shoulders?!\"\n\n\"Well... Bittersweet is the right size...\" reasons Zing.\n\n\"He's also a Tiefling! The Blackfist only employ humans!\"\n\nZing drops each tunic one by one into the water while whistling a tune.\n\nThe party reach their destination. A sandy, wind-buffeted islet rests offshore in the Bay of Phlan, Thorn Island serves as a natural breakwater against the ravages of the Moonsea.\n\nThe isle’s most prominent feature is Sokol Keep, fortress and former headquarters of the once formidable Sokol merchant house. A beacon atop the highest tower of the Keep serves as a lighthouse for ships entering the Bay of Phlan. Strong currents and rocks make getting to the isle somewhat problematic for the inexperienced sailor especially in the dark.\n\nThere is a small quay on the eastern end of the isle as well as a couple of large wooden warehouses. The dock and houses look like they have seen better times, but they are still sturdy.\n\nWaiting for the party are the caretakers, a middle aged man and woman, and their teenaged son. They introduce themselves as Darvag, Shandra and Ronin. They ask who sent them to help and the party tell them the dockworkers did. \n\nThey quickly explain that the lighthouse light went out two days ago. They have investigated it but cannot find anything wrong with it, then again they know it's magical and they have no knowledge of magic. When asked about the Blackfist guards they mentioned they dissappeared around the same time as did the lord of Sokol Keep, Ignan Sokol. \n\nThe party ask if Sokol Keep is haunted and they get a similar response to what Karst gave.\n\nThe party look around and decide to examine the lighthouse first. Corrin looks up and sees a blonde haired woman standing at the top of the lighthouse, her long hair blowing in a nonexistent wind, nonexistent because the small white flag at the top of the lighthouse is not moving at all. He turns to his companions but they don't seem to have noticed her. When he looks back she's gone. Corrin says nothing.\n\n\"You ok?\" asks Zing.\n\n\"Thought I saw something.\" replies the halfling cleric.\n\n\"Have you been ingesting magical mushrooms?\" asks the gnome.\n\nCorrin ignores him and they walk to the lighthouse.\n\nThe party reach the top of the lighthouse and examine the mechanism. The large crystal is unlit and the mechanism that spins the light house doesn't seem to be running. Zing performs a ritual to detect magic and learns that the crystal is indeed magical but doesn't learn why it's turned off. He assumes the magic is being suppressed somehow but his spell doesn't detect any other magical auras.\n\nThey return to the ground floor and head over to the West tower. Entering the tower, they immediately smell wet, freshly-turned earth. Upon arriving in the basement, they find that somebody broke open the floor and dug down to the stone. The earth and tile are stacked neatly alongside the walls. Digging tools lay scattered about the room. There is a severed rope tied to a ring in the wall leading to a stone slab in the earth. Three other 50- foot coils of rope lay on the floor beside the slab.\n\nThe stone slab is approximately 10 feet on a side, is bordered in worn glyphs, and has an indentation in the shape of a human hand approximately six inches away from the leading edge of the slab. \n\nExamine the slab with detect magic, Zing comes to the conclusion that some sort of pass phrase is need to open it. They leave it for now and begin to explore the next floor.\n\nThe find a room with furniture and paintings covered with sheets. Corrin removes one of the clothes and the discover a family portrait, most likely the Sokol family. In a vanity unit draw Mitch discovers a small music box. He opens it and finds a small faerie dragon that turns as music plays. He slides it into his tunic.\nSuddenly the sheets covering all the paintings fly off and many pairs of Sokol eyes stare at the occupants of the room.\n\nMitch places the music box on the vanity unit and backs away. Corrin and Zing follow.\n\nBefore they leave Zing stands just outside the door and casts mage hand to grab the music box. The door slams violently in his face! He catches up with the others.\nThe party march over to the East Tower. The tower is also used to store furniture, and thick layers of dust and cobwebs make it look like nobody has been in the tower for years.\n\nAs they begin to search Corrin notices that specific furniture against the far wall has been moved back and forth, as if block something from view. Moving the furniture aside reveals a boarded over door, with a few loose planks at the bottom. With a bit of work, they make an opening.\n\nOnce through the door, they party find themselves in a well-maintained shrine. A beautiful gray statue of a one-handed blind god stands at the end of the room, a small stone altar with an old looking brass scale at its feet. Two dusty cabinets on both sides of the altar are filled with books and scrolls, mostly on law, history and philosophy. Corrin identifies the statue as one of Tyr, God of Justice. A beautiful reading desk of purple wood fills most of the remaining space. On the desk is the book. \nCorrin takes a moment to pray to Tyr for guidance.\n\nThe book flips open and its pages mysteriously flip on their own eventually stopping at a page of scribblings. The book is a journal but lacks easy reference points. There are no dates, just random notes all over the page including sentences in the margins. It seems more like a collection of thoughts and notes than an actual journal. The journal belongs to Ignan Sokol. The last page of Ignan’s journal is really the only document of particular use. On it, Zing identifies what he believes is the phrase that must be said to open the stone slab. The journal also mentions a book of Moonsea Cults but they can't find it here.\n\nThe party head up to the second floor but find nothing useful. They recall that there was a book shelf in the East Tower and head back. Once they and looking specifically they find the book of Moonsea Cults by Thalioss of Tyr. As the book is written completely in Thorass, an ancient derivate of Common, Zing prepares comprehend languages and begins reading. The book details various ancient cults and their religious practices complete with detailed sketches. The cults described within seem to be mostly those that worship demons, powerful spirits or simply cults of personality. According the Ignan's journal Zing reads page 78 and locates a passage referencing an ancient cult that worshipped an entity referred to as the “Just One and the Great One.”\n\nThe rest of page 78 itself depicts some of the Cult’s symbols, secret signals and prayers, all of which in also in Thorass. Armed with all the knowledge they need to party head back to the excavated basement but not before Zing takes an elegant butter knife.\n\nThey party bump into the caretakers and Zing hands over the butter knife.\n\nZing places his hand in the indentation and speaks the phrase \"Toe Mono, Toe Megalo”. Suddenly the slab vanishes into nothingness and the passage it reveals drops down into darkness. Musty, moist air wafts up from the void. Corrin casts light on his buck and a quarter staff which reveals what appears to be some sort room with a finished, tiled floor.\n\nMitch hammers a piton into the floor and then lowers a rope. They grab the extra coils of rope and the trio climb down into a chamber. They find a ladder and set it up against the hole. At this point they notice a similar hand shaped indentation on this side of the hole. The floor is stone but covered by a thin layer of mud. The booted footprints of several people head down the corridor to the North. The party follow the footprints and reach a point of the corridor where a stone shelf lies seven feet about their heads. Corrin climbs onto Mitch's shoulders and pulls himself up to the shelf. He lets out a small squeak.\n\n\"What's up there?!\" asks Mitch.\n\n\"The entire shelf is lined with rows and rows of skulls and bones!\" says Corrin. \"I'm coming down.\"\n\n\"Ok that's creepy.\" says Zing.\n\nThe party move on and notice the corridor begins slopping downward. Up ahead a pair of alcoves houses two bizarre suits of armor made from coral and shells. Expecting the inevitable animation Zing uses mage hand to loop the extra rope they have around the two \"guardians\". They proceed down the corridor and as expected the two bizarre suits of armor made from coral and shells come to life... and topple over as they are entwined with rope.\n\nThe party attack and manage to destroy one of the guardians before the other one breaks free. It's quickly dispatched but not before raking it's razor sharp coral claws across Mitch's chest. \n\nSuddenly they hear a noise back at the entrance. They return to the room with the opening in the ceiling and notice that the stone slab as reappeared. The tip of the ladder has been cut clean off by the reappearing slab. Zing tries to use mage hand to open the slab but that fails. He then puts his mage hand in a glove but also no effect. Mitch suggests pooping in the glove.\n\nThe party return to the corridor with the animated guardians and continue on.\n\nThe floor levels out into a40-foot-in-diameter circular room. Despite the water that fills the room up to their shins, it is easy to notice the sinkhole that has opened in the middle, though seeing the bottom is impossible due to the amount of sediment that has accumulated here. The sides of the sinkhole are gently sloped, but covered in a thick coat of slick algae.\n\nThe only other feature of this chamber is a narrow hole near the top of the left wall and a door of beaten brass on the far wall. From here they can see a smear of dried blood upon the handle. Suspecting a trap, Zing gets everyone to step out of the water, he casts shocking grasp and touches the water. The current runs along the surface of the water and suddenly a hideous creature bursts out of the sinkhole and begins scrambling toward the trio.\n\nIt resembles a sickly, blue skinned elf with sharp teeth and claws. Mitch moves to intercept and he is struck first. He feels his muscles stiffen for a moment but continues to attack the creature. Corrin and Zing hit it with a combination of divine and arcane spells and the creature is killed.\n\nZing uses mage hand to loop the end of their rope over the door handle and once Mitch is over the other side of the sinkhole he slowly pulls the other two across. They continue around the spiraling corridor and stumble upon a pair of ancient looking cells. Both are empty so they move on.\n\nEventually they reach a round room approximately 60 feet in diameter with a vaulted ceiling 30 feet tall in the center. The majority of the room is a couple feet higher than the side they enter from, and accessed by a pair of steps.\n\nAt the far side of the room, a large idol carved from a single piece of pale green stone stands in a pool of black water. It is carved in the shape of a tentacle humanoid with the head of a many-fanged fish, and bathes the room in a sickly green light. Two pillars are arranged around the raised section of the floor. While they are too worn to be certain, it is highly likely that they were once beautifully carved.  The body of a young human male is slumped over an altar at the edge of the pool. Something that appears to be a wand is on the floor near his hand. A pool of dark blood has pooled and dried on the altar after running down its sides and front. A number of calcified skeletons lay in heaps on either side of the pool and a second corpse lays partially submerged in the pool, this body bearing dozens of slashing wounds and the tunic of a Blackfist Guard.\n\nCorrin tries to recall if he knows what the large idol represents but shakes his head.\n\nZing thinks it may be the “Just One and the Great One.”\n\n\"Don't touch anything!\" warns Mitch. \"Do you think that's Ignan?\" pointing to the body on the altar.\n\n\"Yeah he looks like the family in those paintings. I'm going to try grab that wand.\" says Zing, invoking mage hand.\n\n\"No! Don't touch anything!\" cries Corrin. \"This always goes bad!\"\n\n\"Don't worry.\" says Zing, confidently snatching the wand over.\n\nSuddenly Mitch hears a noise coming from a door to their left they hadn't noticed before. He walks over to it and pushes on it, it strikes a heavy object and doesn't budge. \n\n\"Who's there?!\" cries a voice from the other side of the door.\n\n\"Uh this is Mitch, the dock workers sent us to find out what happened to the lighthouse.\" \n\n\"Did you kill the undead?\" ask the voice.\n\n\"We killed some things, what undead are you talking about?\" asks Zing.\n\n\"The ones that killed Simmons... and Ignan.\" replies the voice.\n\nCorrin looks over at Ignan's body, a single stab wound to the back is the only injury. He looks at the body of the Blackfist floating in the water. It's covered in claw marks.\n\"Who killed Ignan?\" asks Corrin.\n\n\"The undead did, that crazy kid touched the altar and it all went to hell. Skeletons rose from the pool and killed him and Simmons.\"\n\n\"Well nothing's moving now.\" says Mitch. \"Come out so we can get out of here.\"\n\nThe trio here the large object blocking the door being moved and the door opens to reveal another five Blackfist Guards. They appeared to be tired and carrying several sacks of something that jingles like coinage.\n\n\"Found some treasure aye?\" says Mitch.\n\n\"Yeah... yeah... let's just get out of here and we can discuss that later. I'm Lt Grimm by the way. Don't touch anything, we don't want the undead to rise up again.\"\n\nAs the group starts to leave Corrin hears a whisper in his ear, a female voice says \"Murderers.\" He visibly shivers.\n\nZing notices and asks him \"You ok?\"\n\nCorrin addresses Lt Grimm. \"So you're saying Ignan was killed by the skeletons?\"\n\n\"Yeah... that's... what I said.\" replies Grimm nervously\n\nThe voice whispers \"They are murderers.\"\n\nMitch decides to pretend to tie the nonexistent shoelaces on his hide boots and loses balance knocking Grimm into the altar. \"Hey! Careful!\"\n\nNothing happens.\n\nThe voice whispers one more time. \"Ignan deserves Justice for what they did.\" \n\nCorrin acts and cracks the guard in front of him over the head. \"They killed Ignan!\"\n\nMitch and Zing look at each other and shrug. \"The halfling never lies.\"\n\nThe Blackfist draw weapons and a battle begins. The element of surprise is in the party's favor and though it's close in the end the Blackfist are defeated.\n\n\"Thank you.\" whispers the voice. Corrin offers a prayer to Tyr.\n\nCorrin decides to search Ignan's body and finds a locket in his pocket, it holds a drawing of a woman with long flowing hair and a symbol of Tyr around her neck. The trio debate what to do and in the end decide to take Ignan's body, plus all the loot and leave. \n\n\"This loot will sure help us all out!\" says Mitch.\n\n\"We don't have to tell the others.\" says Corrin.\n\n\"Woah! What's gotten into you?\" asks Zing giving him a side long glance. \"But yeah we don't have to say a thing. Now if we could get the idol, it could be worth thousands!\"\n\nAs they ponder the thought the cave with the idol starts to shake and pieces of the ceiling come crashing into the pool. Deciding not to stick around they high tail it out of there and return to the surface.\n\nOutside, it's close to dusk and the caretakers are looking up at the lighthouse which is now lit, and slowly turning.\n\n\"You did it!\" cries Darvag then notices the body of Ignan. \"What happened?\" he asks as they rush over. His wife sheds a tear as she offers a silent prayer to her own personal deity.\n\nThe party explain everything and ask if the boy's family will try and resurrect him.\n\n\"Alas he is the last of the Sokol line and the keeps funds could not afford such a miracle.\" replies Darvag.\n\n\"So maybe the Lord Protector will bestow the Keep to us as reward?\" asks Zing.\n\n\"I honestly don't know Master Gnome. Now if you'll excuse us we must bury Master Sokol in the graveyard behind the lighthouse.\" replies Darvag. \n\nSandra helps her son Ronin take the body. \n\n\"He said he wanted to be buried near the grave of a Priest of Tyr that lived here many years ago.\"\n\nCorrin looks up at the lighthouse and spots the same woman he saw when they arrived. She looks down on him and nods. He waves at her. She fades away.\n\n\"Who you waving at?\" asks Zing. \"You sure you didn't ingest some magical mushrooms?\"\n\n**[[5e] Defiance in Phlan - Session 7] (https://np.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/535iv9/5e_defiance_in_phlan_session_7/)**\n\n \n\n",

        "text": "[Obligatory Fudge link](https://www.reddit.com/r/fudgerpg)\n\nThe game started on a luxury cruise liner.  One PC was an animal handler for the ship (Fe'ern), while the other PC was a stowaway (Theron).  Theron masqueraded as part of the crew and found a protocol droid to give him a job (deliver a dataslate to a certain passenger).  The animal Fe'ern was watching got away from her and playfully tackled Theron.  The two headed in the same direction, where the mysterious passenger was revealed to be a reptilian Jedi.  The Jedi revealed to Theron and Fe'ern that they both have force sensitivity and offered to train them.  Theron has a Thing about Jedi, so he politely declined and quickly left.  The Jedi sensed that enemies would be attacking shortly and told Fe'ern that A) she should head to the escape pods, and B) to find the Jedi Enclave on Dantooine.  \n\nIn the meantime Theron mined a room with explosives to manufacture an emergency so he could get access to the escape pods and escape the Jedi.  Like I said, his character has a Thing about them.  Fortunately, before he could detonate the explosives, the ship was attacked and a voice over the loudspeaker told everybody to report to the escape pods.\n\nTheron and Fe'ern got into the same escape pod, which automatically jettisoned them to the planet Taris.\n\nThey landed on the upper plate in a large field of edible crops.  They saw a domed city to one direction and a farming hovercraft in another.  They headed towards the hovercraft and found a bored worker who really disliked his job (Igear).  He was a total fanboy, loved hearing about their exploits, and asked to join them (they said yes).  He quit his job by driving the hovercraft to his boss's house and soaking him with the hovercraft's watering hose.  Then he used a family connection to get the papers the party needed in order to enter the city.\n\nOnce inside the city they explored and found an apartment complex.  An imperial soldier was trying to extort an additional protection fee from one of the resident aliens.  Theron snuck up behind the soldier and bashed him on the head with the butt of Theron's rifle, knocking him out.  They dragged the unconscious soldier to an abandoned apartment then tied him up and stripped him of his uniform.  A woman (Rukil) entered the apartment.  It turned out it wasn't so abandoned after all.  She slit the soldier's throat.  Oddly enough, nobody really freaked out over this.  She told them of the bounty on her head for turning down a crime boss, then left, in identity-concealing armor, with the PCs and detonated a permacrete detonator (extremely powerful explosive) behind her, leaving the soldier's body to pass as her own.\n\nEverybody wanted to get off-planet, and an Undercity gang called the Hidden Beks was their best bet for finding a ship that would take them off-planet.  Theron changed into the Imperial armor he looted, Rukil took them to the elevator, they headed to the undercity, skipped the science lab near the entrance (that would have given them the rakghoul serum subplot), and headed straight for the Hidden Bek base.  They fought three rakghouls (mutant animals), Rukil bisected one of them, Theron blasted two of them, and Fe'ern threw animal food.  Two Gamorreans guarded the entrance, but Theron's talk of a bounty meant they got to see Brevik.  Brevik was a middle-aged man in a room with a Mandalorian acting as his guard.  Rukil took off her helmet off and taunted him.  Brevik panicked and ordered Canderous (the Mandalorian) to kill her, but he instead turned and killed Brevik before passionately embracing Rukil.  Canderous took the party to the Ebon Hawk and set course for Dantooine and the Jedi Enclave.\n\nTheron: \"Wait, what?\"\n\n[Session 2: The Jedi Enclave](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/549d0f/fudge_star_wars_kotor_episode_2_the_jedi_enclave/?st=itgywqf8&amp;sh=c8663731)",

        "text": "Hey r/gametales, it's me, BlazingTrail! I'm back with another story. This time, it's not so much about a funny experience, but more about the way that one awful players ruined a campaign that was flawed to begin with. Enjoy!\n\nCast:\nDM (played as Gerus in my last gametale; this tale chronicles his depressingly short career as a DM)\nBlaze (yours truly, playing a wizzard again)\nRakus (a dwarf)\n\nThe campaign began with Blaze and Gerus in a tavern. We hear, through some clunky exposition, that there is a temple that is perched on top of a nearby hill. In it, there is apparently an ancient relic which could hold ultimate power. So naturally, we decide to go and retrieve it.\n\nWe get close to the temple, and two stone guardians come out to harass us I go first - and I choose to cast Burning Hands (my faaaaavourite spell). This does a fair amount of damage, but I can't take them alone.\n\nThen, things start to go wrong. Rakus begins his turn, and decides to *tumble* at the opponent. This is a move that has no effect other than a mediocre dodge. But Rakus, being Rakus, tumbles *towards* the opponent, which proceeds to hit him for a stunning amount of damage.\n\nI cast Burning Hands once more, and Rakus continues to tumble. 20 GOTO 10, we eventually kill the guardians. Inside the temple, there is a staff (ee-eye-ee-eye-oh) which I take for future use. We decide to head back to the tavern, because night is falling.\n\nWe rent a room, and when we wake up the town is empty. The staff is hovering in mid-air outside, and it appears to be controlling the townsfolk. Rakus scoops up a rock, and throws it at the staff. Natural 20. The staff dissolves into a fine red mist, and we go back to the tavern to sleep again.\n\nRakus, while I'm sleeping, decides to fart on my face. Why, I have no idea. Even to this day it is a mystery. But he rolls, and it works, and I smash hi in the face with a magic missile. Rakus tries to tumble into me, and at this point the DM steps in and dissolves our session.\n\nIt may sound fun, but at the time it was decidedly NOT. We spent the rest of the time playing HALO.",

But then *(gasp!)* The second round goes to the spies with two fails! Even worse (for the goodies), the third round goes to us spies as well! \n\nThen it was my turn. I looked around the table, considering who to pick. This was the fourth round, meaning two spies had to fail the mission instead of one. That meant that two spies had to be on the mission. Around the table, one fellow spy was under suspicion, and another was starting to draw attention. I had to choose three innocents...and two spies.\n\nFirst on the mission was Ron. One of the most trustworthy goodies thus far. I wasn't compromised yet, so I joined the mission myself. Thomas the goody was next with a 50% mission success and a trustworthy manner. One spot went to Clem (goody) and the last spot went to Blake, one of the spies. Someone else called out Blake, but with some talking, the mission was voted through. *Yes!*\n\nWith myself and Blake on the mission, the two of us would be enough to fail the mission, and to win the game! And once the mission cards came through, with all the smug pride I could muster I snatched up the cards myself and displayed for all to see:\n\nSuccess\n\nSuccess\n\nFail (my card)\n\nSuccess\n\n***Success.***\n\nI glanced at Blake. He looked back blankly. Then it hit me. Blake was new. He hadn't noticed that we could have won in that round. And with us trying to be covert and everything I had no way of telling him to play Fail.\n\nAnd now everyone knew, thanks to all my fanfare and bragging, I was a spy.\n\nFuck.\n\n^(P.S. The spies won that game, incidentally. Another spy who had not been exposed yet got drafted onto the final mission and won us the game. Huzzah)",

Again, as they place the bulky helmets over their heads, they are overcome with sensation as their thoughts and memories are joined by the fabricated experiences of the characters they play. \n\nWe start simply. Arson, a hardly noticeable Sylph, has spent the last few months gathering information, specifically gathering information on the Council of Nine, the ruling body of Fellstar. She has learned that the wizard councilman Zedalfingor the Beige has been moving suspicious amounts of gemstones to a few locations around the city, and that one of those caches might be easier to get to than others. She gathers her papers, making sure that the information is correct, and sets off to find an acquaintance.\n\nMirkur, as usual, starts the game at his hole in the wall workshop, perfecting the art of trapmaking. He works on a brilliant new trap (one that explodes in just such a way as to leave a cartoonish scorch mark) as Arson carefully navigates the maze of traps around the workspace. He doesn't hear her, but his ferret familiar alerts him to a foreign presence. She doesn't even flinch as a tossed dagger speeds dangerously past her ear. She fills him in on the plan. \n\nAnd then we have Simon, as is usual for a Tuesday morning, waiting in his shop for a customer with an inverse proportion of intelligence and gold. The little bell chimes as a familiar man enters the store, the poor chap that set them off on the first heist. He has been made the owner of the old warehouse, you see, and was certain to thank the man responsible. Shortly after his leave, the two criminals from earlier enter the store, and a plan is quickly hatched. \n\nDisguised as \"Professor William Nye\" and \"Dr. Rube Goldberg\", Simon and Mirkur gain access to the laboratory where the gemstones are reportedly kept. With surprisingly well-made false credentials they manage to convince the door guard they are there to interview students, and interview they do indeed. Professor Nye, disguised with salt and pepper flavor in his hair and a gentleman's mustache, discovers a small amount of students animating suits of armor. To the students' disappointment, the armor would stay animated without a controller present.\n\nA student named Stephen LeChance is found in the next room, studying anatomy with his peers. The poor bastard. The two disguised men learn a lot about the facility with casual questions to Stephen, and it doesn't take them long to notice a student that doesn't quite look like a model citizen. They proclaim that Stephen and this other fellow should meet them later for an interview, and explore the rest of the lab.\n\nThe bullshittery was almost caught on the next floor down, where an elven wizard insisted the men turn back. Remember her, Mis'reil, for later.\n\nStephen's interview later confirms that he is in fact a poor bastard, as he is quickly convinced to let the men into the building after hours, and his misfortune grows as a spell of suggestion is cast upon him. \n\nShortly after this, the shady student enters, lighting a smoke, he insists that \"Nye\" drop the act. This student is named Zed, a man here only to increase his power and wealth. In exchange for a dark grimoire, a cut of the profits, and a later favor, he is more than happy to assist the crew of thieves.\n\nWhile all this happens, Arson carefully details the facility, and she learns very quickly she isn't the only one watching. The other council members are watching the wizard, and he them, and all this seems to be in preparation for something no one understands. To save time, I will tell you that the grimoire was obtained, a map received, and a plan conceived.\n\nIt begins. Simon goes to retrieve a carriage for escape. Stephen, so eager to show his work to the \"higher ups\", greets Dr. Goldberg and his assistant (arson), and he easily convinced the guard to let them pass, despite no one allowed in the building after seven. Stephen's mere presence disarms the first trap for the two thieves. He happily shows them the laboratory when the compulsion hits him: open the door. Open the door. Reverse Hodor.\n\nHe wordlessly climbs down the latter to where Mis'Riel stands guard. The criminals can hear them argue, and can hear Stephen's cries as he disarms the door trap and triggers the burning hands contingency. Poor bastard. Mirkur drops a silent image trap down the latter, and one in front of him and arson, hiding them from Mis'Riel dragging Stephen out of the building. When the coast is clear, they go down the latter themselves, dropping a ring of one of the councilmen on Stephen's other possessions.\n\nThe door disarmed, they continue on. They disarm an alarm trap, and Arson is hit by a swinging scythe, but they make it to the treasure. They stuff the bag of holding with this vast wealth, and they soon hear footsteps. Mis'Riel. The first guard saw three people go in and one get dragged out. Thinking quickly, Mirkur drops a memory lapse trap and disguises himself as the first guard. Arson spider climbs to the ceiling and prays.\n\nShe trips the trap, she is thoroughly confused, and she helps Mirkur search the building for himself. Finally, she realizes she failed her one duty, and kills herself with a wand to the face.\n\nThe \"heroes\" escape into the night, with tens of thousands of gold worth of gems, and only at the end of the night do they go to sleep in wealth, wake up, and realize they had forgotten parts of the heist, especially those pertaining to the elf. What elf?\n\nThe gamers remove their helmets, notice the late hour, and go home to look forward to the next session. As for the game master, he is happy that he *almost* outwitted the heroes, and goes home to type out the story on Reddit.",

        "text": "This session's write up is a little more detailed because it was written the day after the session and I took notes. Most of the dialogue was close to what was said with a little creative license thrown in after the fact.\nEnjoy!\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe party debate whether they should even bother saving Villonah consider several of them are lawful and the gnome teenager is a known criminal. At this stage Corrin, who is also lawful, realizes that sometimes the law can be twisted by the corrupt. His change of heart comes with a new attitude and he manages to sway his companions into rescuing the troubled teen.\n\nThe party decide to stake out the Lyceum of the Black Lord. Concerned that Corrin might struggle with keeping his mouth shut the party dress him up as a mute leper and then decide to scrap that plan. Instead Bittersweet, Gidyan and Zing decide the direct approach and go through the front door. Corrin, Grimgar and Mitch decide to stake out the temple from outside, watching for suspicious characters.\n\nInside the former temple of Bane has been consecrated to Lathander, the Morning Lord. Within are a female halfling cleric tending to a handful of patients and her half-orc, battle axe carrying bodyguard. Bittersweet feigns illness and the cleric offers assistance. While Zing backs up the tiefling's story, Gidyan walks around the old temple looking for stairs leading down. Bittersweet barfs on command and the half-orc fetches a mop and bucket. The halfling cleric mutters a prayer and touches the monk on the forehead.\n\n\"Feeling better she asks?\"\n\nBittersweet is instantly stone cold sober, something he hasn't experienced in a long time. He goes quiet. \n\nZing, trying to buy Gidyan more time to search asks the half-orc if he's a cleric too.\n\n\"He doesn't speak.\" answers the halfling cleric. \"He's mute.\"\n\n\"What's his name?\" asks Zing\n\n\"Roag, he's my bodyguard, we've been together for years. My name is Peony.\"\n\nZing makes introduction and then asks why the temple is in such poor condition. Peony explains that the current Lord Regent is happy for them to use the Lyceum as a base to tend to the sick and injured but the city has no funds to repair the temple. Seeing the Gidyan still hasn't found anything Bittersweet begins to ask about the faith of Lathander to buy him even more time.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOutside the three spotters haven't spotted anything, well two of them are actually looking while Corrin reads a Visitor's Guide to Phlan pamphlet, he's really engrossed in it and excitedly tells his companions about the wonders of the city. Mitch shushes him when he spots an elven woman on the balcony of a nearby building. She seems to be staking out the temple as well. He notifies the other two and points up at her.\n\"Hello there!\" cries out Corrin waving excitedly.\n\nThe elven woman moves back out of sight.\n\nGrimgar sneaks up to the side of the building. It appears empty and locked. He tries to pick the simple back door lock but fails. He considers climbing up to the second floor but feeling deflated takes a page out of Corrin's book.\n\n\"Umm.. excuse me, elf lady!\" He calls up.\n\nThe elven women peers over the balcony and scowls. She places a finger to her lips and the half-orc wisely stops talking.\n\nShe drops down almost silently in front of Grimgar. She's dressed in leathers and carries a fine rapier at her side.\n\n\"Who are you and what are you doing here?\" she asks.\n\nMitch and Corrin approach. \"We're staking out the temple.\" replies Grimgar.\n\n\"So am I. Why are you doing that?\"\n\n\"We're trying to find a missing girl.\" says Grimgar though he suspects so is she.\n\n\"So am I. She wouldn't happen to be a gnome named Villonah?\"\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nInside Gidyan returns to his two companions, subtly shaking his head. They thank the female halfling cleric and leave the temple. Crossing the street, they spot the other three talking to a sinewy elven woman.\n\n\"....my... friend went missing and after asking around I finally found a lowlife gnome willing to give some information... after I beat it out of him.\" says the elven woman who has introduced herself as Yllivia.\n\nBitters smiles to himself as the other burst into laughter. Corrin doesn't get the joke.\n\n\"So what's the plan?\" she asks.\n\nAt that point the party have a lengthy discussion about telling everyone in the city about the secret prison so it's no longer a secret. They discuss somehow printing flyers with the truth about the secret prison. Zing even comes up with a chant they can use.\n\nFinally, Yllivia suggests that there may be a secret entrance somewhere, maybe a sewer grate?\n\nThe party discuss where to look and Bittersweet suggests maybe the entrance is a sewer outlet to the Moonsea. Deciding that's the best place to look they head off to the coast.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe party find the entrance and decide to sneak in without a light source since they all have darkvision. Except Corrin the halfling. Bitters lifts him up on his shoulders and they proceed. Eventually they reach a door. Grimgar and Yllivia sneak up and listen. They hear moaning and sobbing, probably the prisoners. Gidyan sneaks up and looks through the key hole. Beyond is a large room, another door lies opposite this one but he can't see the prisoners from his peephole. \n\nGrimgar attempts to pick his second lock for the day... and fails. Yllivia leans over and picks the lock for the half-orc. A big grin crosses her face. The party shuffle back and begin to discuss their plan. Corrin wants to render the Black Fist guard unconscious so they can be arrested. Surprisingly everyone else agrees. They move on with the plan - Grimgar will set up the trap he discovered in the crypt and then they'll knock on the door, when the guard opens it they'll attack.\n\nGidyan walks up to the door, knocks, and runs back. The party all draw missile weapons. The silence is only interrupted by Corrin spinning is sling over his head and the sound of a guard approaching.\n\n\"What about the poison on the trap?\" asks Bittersweet.\n\n\"Nah... that won't kill him. Just make him sick a little...\" replies Grimgar.\n\n\"What's the password?!\" asks the guard from behind the door.\n\nEveryone is looks at each other. \"Password?\" mutters Mitch. \n\n\"What?! I can't hear you speak up!\"\n\n\"I forgot the password! Just let me in!\" cries Corrin.\n\n\"... go away kid, this isn't a safe place!\" says the Black Fist guard hearing the childlike voice of the halfling.\n\nThe party discuss what to do, but don't do it quietly. They hear the sound of the door unlocking and a sword being drawn.\n\n\"Ok kid, I told you to get lost...\" Stanwyck Brady, the Black Fist guard, opens the door, the trap goes off and sticks him in the gut. The poison takes effect instantly. He looks up in pain to see a barrage of arrows, crossbow bolts and a sling bullet coming flying at him. Miraculously only Bittersweet's arrow hits him, a shoulder hit. Again miraculously Stanwyck lives through the initial attack, he stumbles to the side and manages to push the door closed. \"We're under attack!\" he cries through gritted teeth.\n\nThe party debates what to do as Corrin and Grimgar rush up to the door. Gidyan uses a Mage Hand and luckily the door wasn't locked and he pushes it open with a magical shove. Grimgar rolls into the room. The poisoned guard fires an arrow but it goes wide. Grimgar returns fire and misses as well. \n\nSuddenly four more Black Fist guards burst into the room, a large black dog on a leash before them. The fight is on!\nGrimgar draws his dragon tooth dagger and attacks Stanwyck. The guard dog attack Corrin and attempts to trip the little halfling but he's too quick. Bitters rushes across the room to aid Grimgar as Mitch draws his warhammer and attacks the four guards... make that two guards, as a sleep spell from Gidyan drops half of them.\n\nCorrin burns the dog with sacred flame and Zing puts it down with a firebolt. Mitch strikes one of the guards as Bittersweet flails blindly at Stanwyck; being sober has its draw backs. Grimgar's dragon tooth dagger crackles with electricity and virtually sinks itself into his Stanwyck's chainmail clad chest and through his heart. He dies before hitting the floor. Yllivia leaps over Corrin and charges the remaining guard. He fires his bow, she slides under the arrow and plunges her rapier into his gut. He dies in excruciating pain. Corrin calls down Sacred Flame on the last guard and burns him to death with holy flame.\n\nThe party quickly strip the two sleeping guards and toss them into the empty cell.\nThey release the other five prisoners. The explain they were captured and brought down here for speaking out against the current lord, handing out flyers etc\n\n\"We couldn't come up with a chant though.\" says one of the prisoners\n\n\"I could help you with that.\" says Zing.\n\n\"We don't have time!\" cries Yllivia \"we need to find my... find Villonah!\"\n\n\"What's through that door?!\" yells Gidyan through the bars.\n\n\"We don't know!\" replies one of the guards.\n\n\"Listen to me.\" Gidyan grabs one of the guards through the bars. \"You see your former coworker over there? Our cleric burnt him to death with the holy fire of his god! And he's the good cop in this situation!\"\n\n\"The room beyond that door is where we send prisoners to break them. This Villonah you're looking for is in there!\" replies the scared guard.\n\n\"Why do you have her imprisoned?\" asks Grimgar.\n\n\"She's been bragging about a secret treasure map; we've been trying to get the location of the map out of her.\" \n\nGidyan strides over to the door and uses one of the guard's keys to open the door. The room is dark and dank, he spots an odd obelisk to the left of the door, curious, he approaches it. A wave of black energy emanates from the obelisk and fear grips the gnome Wild Mage, he runs screaming from the room. Zing chases after his gnomish brother in magic.\n\nEventually Gidyan returns but is reluctant to enter the chamber. Corrin suggests he can bless some of the party and protect them against the fear. He blesses himself, Zing, Bittersweet and Grimgar. Mitch decides his dwarven courage will be enough and the five of them enter the room.\n\nPredictably fear grips Mitch and he runs screaming out of the room. He rushes past Gidyan and Yllivia and the gnome gives chase.\n\nBack in the chamber the others spot a cage at the end of the cavern. Inside is a scared young female gnome. They move toward her and suddenly they hear a large form slide out from behind some natural rock pillars. The creature resembles a giant worm with four tentacles surrounding a beak for a head. It moves to attack.\n\nGidyan tires of chasing Mitch and returns to the chamber with the cells. He stumbles upon Yllivia wiping blood off her rapier. He looks at her and then at the cell with the two... now dead guards.\n\n\"They tried to escape. One of them had a hidden key.\" offers Yllivia.\n\nGidyan notices the cell door is still closed. \"I'm sure they did.\"\n\nThe sounds of battle interrupt the two. \"You better go help my friends... and yours!\" says Gidyan.\n\nYllivia curses and leaps into the room fully expecting the magical fear to overwhelm her but she resists it. She rushes into battle.\n\nThe party surround the beast and rain hell on it but it's tough hide resists their blades and fists. Zing blasts it with flame and Corrin calls holy fire onto it. Finally, Grimgar draws his magical dragon tooth dagger, having used his non magical sword up to the point. He strikes and drives the dagger up into its brain. The beast collapses dead.\n\nCorrin tries to coax the gnome teenager out of the cage but she's frightened. Yllivia steps forward and Villonah's eyes go wide. She leaps into the elves arms and they exchange a tender moment. \nZing claps.\n\nThey return to the cells chamber after searching the remaining cavern, removing parts from the creature and skinning its tough hide so Mitch can make the party monster hide boots.\n\nGidyan is pleased to see his mentor's daughter and implores her to go see her father. She tells him to say \"Villonah had a teddy bear named Fluffy when she was young\", he'll know she's alright and when she's ready she'll see him again. The party discuss what to do with the bodies of the guards and after much debate decide to graffiti the walls in blood (this was Corrin's idea though initially he was thinking of cutting them up and tossing them into the Moonsea) and blame it on a fictional cult named La Cantera.\n\nGidyan returns to his mentor with the good news and mentions the map to Rillo Leadstopper but he's not aware of his daughter owning a map. He pays the 100 gold coins and promises to reward the group with a potion each of their choice. Before leaving Bittersweet shares his displeasure with Rillo regarding their \"reward\" and tries to guilt trip the gnome Alchemist. It doesn't work so he leaves.\n\nBack at the Laughing Goblin Inn, Yllivia approaches Grimgar and offers him a place with the Welcomers, the Thieves Guild of Phlan. He declines with a \"I'm not that type of thief.\"\n\n**[[5e] Defiance in Phlan - Session 6] (https://np.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/524ygl/5e_defiance_in_phlan_session_6/)**",

        "text": "Outside the Tea Kettle a tall, gaunt man wearing a wide brim black hat is waiting for them. Around his neck he wears the holy symbol of Kelemvor, Keeper of the Dead. He introduces himself as Brother O'Keefe and asks to speak with the party. The usher him inside and find an unbroken table to sit at.\n\nHe tells them that he is one of the caretakers of Valhingen Graveyard and that it has come to his attention that one of the residents there may have not be what she appeared to be. A human woman named Xandria Welltran may have actually been a polymorphed dragon. He wishes to enter her crypt, open her sarcophagus and confirm that her bones are indeed human. He offers the party 100 gold and a scroll of protection from evil. The party ask for half now and he agrees. He would also like to enter the crypt tonight. \n\nA chorus of \"No way!\" comes from the party and they agree to do it in the morning. Brother O'Keefe respects their wishes and tells them to meet him in the morning.\n\n**Day 15, Tarsakh, 1489DR**\n\nThe next day the party arrive at Valhingen Graveyard, still without Bittersweet. The crypt of Xandria is a nicely appointed stone and marble building, roughly 20 feet square. Brother Keefe produces a key to unlock it. Corrin, Grimgar and Mitch enter while the gravekeeper, Gidyan and Zing remain outside.\nThe interior is equally fine. The walls are carved and painted with various scenes showing a lovely human woman in different locales: looking toward a snow-covered peak, standing in the rain of a thunderstorm, sitting in a comfortable room by a roaring fire, holding a venomous snake in a garden, working with bubbling vials in a laboratory, and many others. The lid of the marble sarcophagus in the center is carved with the likeness of the same beautiful human woman in the prime of her life.\n\nMitch and Grimgar pry open the sarcophagus. Inside the bones that remain are clearly not human. They are draconic and clearly some of the bones are missing. Also resting among the bones are five tiny gems: a red ruby, a green emerald, a black opal, a white diamond, and a blue sapphire. Suddenly a scraping sound echoes through the crypt. The door closes and seals, and a hissing sound makes the trio aware that some kind of gas is entering the crypt. It does not smell pleasant.\n\nThose outside try banging on the door but it's locked shut. Even the key doesn't work. Zing climbs up onto the roof but can't see anyway in from there.\n\nInside Corrin, Grimgar and Mitch try and find a way to escape. The gas starts to poison them slowly. Grimgar examines the murals and spots a tiny gem sized depression in one of them. They check the others and realize they all over the same tiny depressions. Mitch grabs the gems and passes them around.\n\n\"Look for a match, &lt;cough&gt; gem color to mural color!\" Coughs Mitch.\n\nEventually the solve the puzzle and place the gems in their corresponding sockets. The white diamond fits into the indentation on the top of the snow-covered mountain. The blue sapphire fits into the indentation at the point of a lighting strike in the thunderstorm. The red ruby fits into the indentation in the roaring fire of the comfortable room. The green emerald fits into the indentation on the fang of the poisonous snake. The black opal fits into the indentation on the bubbling vial of acid. The gas stops and the door to the crypt opens.\n\nGidyan and Zing rush inside, grateful that their companions still live. Examing the interior more carefully they discover that the sarcophagus can be moved. Putting their backs to it they push aside the sarcophagus and reveal stairs leading into darkness.\n\nCorrins casts a light spell one his buck and a quarter and bounds down the stairs. The others are about to chase after him when Brother O'Keefe calls out to them. Mitch steps outside to find Bittersweet standing there.\n\n\"I found him sleeping behind a gravestone.\" says Brother O'Keefe.\n\nMitch explains what they have found to the gravekeeper, grabs the tiefling and they join the others.\n\nDownstairs Grimgar has found a secret door and they decide to proceed through it rather than follow the corridor around. The secret door opens into a chamber. Four odd humanoid skeletons, topped with draconic skulls, stand at attention, holding swords. At the back of the chamber is a large throne like chair, currently empty, on a mahogany dais.\n\nCorrin rushes up to the chair and climbs onto up of it before they others can react. Everyone draws weapons but nothing happens. Bittersweet suggests destroying the skeletons before they animate and moves over to one of them. \n\nIt looks at him. The skeletons animate and attack!\n\nThe fight is over rather quickly as the skeletons don't seem to have much resistance to weapons. Grimgar examines the chair which has a box like base. The base has a hidden compartment. He discovers that its protected by a poison needle trap but manages to disarm it. He then decides to remove the entire mechanism and does so with the same skill. Within the secret compartment is a small tourmaline worth 50 gp and a scroll of comprehend languages. Corrin takes one of the skeleton bones as a souvenir. \n\nFollowing another passage which curves around the party discover another chamber. This chamber has been set up as a small laboratory. Tables around the room are covered with beakers, vials, tomes, cauldrons, and pots full of alchemical agents.\n\nIn the middle of the central table is a note next to a blue clay pot. The note, written in Common, says, “Raaxil, I have figured out how to complete the process. When you are ready, simply pour the contents of this blue pot into the cauldron and stir. The effects should be instantaneous, but DO NOT DRINK THE RESULTING POTION.”\n\nGidyan examines the contents of the laboratory and deduces that the books and alchemical agents are all tied to necromantic magic, specifically targeted toward dragons. It is extremely advanced magic way beyond his skill.\n\nMitch decides to taste the contents of the cauldron and instantly feels violently ill but thankfully his dwarven constitution protects him from any serious side effects. Zing takes the contents of the blue pot and pours it into a vial for safe keeping. The party proceed to exit the room and follow another curved corridor.\n\nIn the next chamber walls are painted to look like the inside of a dragon’s lair: the scenes depict piles of treasure, robed acolytes bowing in supplication, bound prisoners being served up as a meal, etc. All the paintings focus toward the alcove in the south wall, where a pile of gold coins form a nest perfect for a large dragon!\n\nIn addition to the paintings, there are four large glyphs: one each on the north, south, east and west walls. The southern glyph is within the alcove. These glyphs glow slightly in the dark of the rooms. \n\nIn the northwest corner of the room, a teleportation circle has been etched into the floor. The lack of wear on the etchings implies that the circle was created very recently. A thick metal rod, inscribed with sigils stands in the middle of the circle.\n\nLying on the floor in different parts of the room are 4 dead bodies. Although the bodies look roughly humanoid, they are stitched together from various parts, including some that appear to be draconic in nature.\n\nThe party decide to not threaten the corpses this time and Grimgar moves up to examine one of the sigils while Gidyan and Zing have a look at thick metal rod. The gnomes confirm the symbols are keyed to necromatic magic so Grimgar decides to chip at the symbol to destroy it. Suddenly it flares with sickly green energy and Grimgar feels part of his life force drained. At the same time the corpses on the floor rise as zombies. Battle is joined!\n\nThis battle proves difficult as periodically the symbols flare up and the zombies are healed of their wounds. Desperate Grimgar removes the dragon tooth dagger from his sack and grips it. Nothing happens and he decides to use it as a weapon though nothing special occurs while he wields it.\n\nEventually the party are able to destroy the symbols and the zombies. Gidyan erases the teleportation circle around the rod and takes it. He surmises that something was teleported from this room and replace with the rod, most likely the missing dragon bones.\n\nZing examines the pile of gold coins and learns that they are all painted wooden. He grabs a handful and puts them in his pouch. Corrin also grabs some as souvenirs. The party return to the entrance of the crypt and inform Brother O'Keefe of their findings. They ask him how he suspected that Xandria was a dragon. At this point, Brother O'Keefe reveals that he a member of the Lord’s Alliance, a group looking to maintain stability in Phlan, but not at the cost of lawlessness. He admits that the rumors about the draconic nature of Xandria Welltran came from a source within the Lord’s Alliance, who also told him that the Welcomers, the thieves’ guild of Phlan, have been investigating various dragon-themed leads in the last month. The Welcomers may be involved in this as well.\n\nHe pays them the remainder of their gold and the scroll and bids them farewell. The party return to the Tea Kettle only to find it closed. The knock on the door and receive no answer. \n\nMitch and Zing decide to look for another inn and decide on the Laughing Goblin, they tell the others to meet them there. Corrin walks across the street and knocks on a random resident's door. He tells them about the faith of Ilmater and learns that they are devote followers. The family introduce themselves as the Griswalds and offer him room and supper for the night. Gidyan tells the party he's going to crash at the alchemist's guild. Grimgar decides to break into the Tea Kettle to retrieve his chest of vampire hunting equipment. Bittersweet joins him and while the half-orc goes up to his room, the tielfling steals three bottles of liquor from behind the bar.\n\nGrimgar comes down angry that he's chest is gone. He rushes outside to find that his donkey Horace and his cart is also missing. Once outside they question a passerby who tells them that the Black Fist guard game by this morning with an order to close down the Tea Kettle because of the disturbance the previous day. Any personal items stored would have been the taken to the guard barracks. Bittersweet and Grimgar decide to head to the Laughing Goblin and get a bed for the night as it's getting late.\nAt the Alchemist's Guild Gidyan's mentor, Rillo Leadstopper, approaches him. He looks distressed and tells him that his daughter Villonah has gone missing and wants Gidyan's help in finding her. He offers to pay in coin and potions.\n\nHe relates the following information. After Villonah’s mother died, the girl became wild and inconsolable. She has been in trouble with the law ever since. Most of the crimes were minor offenses that earned her small fines or a few days in the jail. However, her previous acts made her a “usual suspect” for the Black Fist guards. Last night, one of Villonah's halfling friends said they saw his daughter being arrested by the guards.\n\nIn the past she was held in Castle Valjevo, and the next day Rillo goes and pays for her release. This time when he went to Stojanow Gate to inquire about her, he was told she was not in the castle jail. Rillo tried to find her whereabouts by bribing guards and calling in favors, but no one knows her whereabouts. He suggests maybe that some of Gidyan's friends may have \"contacts\" in the seedier parts of town. Gidyan agrees to look into it and decides he'll heads off to the Laughing Goblin in the morning.\n\n**Day 16, Tarsakh, 1489DR**\n\nThe next day the group meet at the Laughing Goblin and Grimgar explains his desire to get his donkey and stuff back. Gidyan tells them about his mentor's job offer but Grimgar is adamant he needs to take care of his personal problem first. In the end Mitch and Corrin offer to join Grimgar. \n\nGidyan, Bittersweet and Zing decide to start looking for information in the Laughing Goblin Inn. Bittersweet and Zing start talking loudly about their missing \"friend\" an \"innocent gnome girl\" and the \"corrupt justice system in Phlan\". Sam the Goblin Innkeeper remarks on the lack of subtly the trio are using and urges them to take it outside.\n\nOutside a lowlife gnome approaches the party and offers to give them information on their \"friend's\" whereabouts for some coin. Zing pickpockets the gnome of five gold and then hands it to him. He asks for more. At this point Bittersweet who has had his usual bottle of booze for breakfast threatens to hurt the gnome with extreme prejudice. The lowlife gives up the following information.\n\nHe's heard of a secret prison that the Black Fist guards covertly use to torture and murder prisoners. He heard a rumor she was taken there because Villonah stole something valuable from one of those guards. The prison, he heard, is located beneath the ruins of the Lyceum of the Black Lord. Although the burnt out Lyceum has been converted into a make-shift shelter for the displaced and injured, the guards have found and taken up secret residence in some chambers beneath it. The trio thank the lowlife for his cooperation and return to the Laughing Goblin.\n\nAt the guard barracks Corrin, Grimgar and Mitch are admitted in to speak with the Captain of the Black Fist Guard, Captain Cate Beckett. Grimgar demands his property returned. She agrees for the fee of 5 gold. He suspects she's using her status to bribe money from him but pays her. She has the chest brought out. Grimgar checks it and all his gear is there. Corrin and Mitch look on in surprise at the amount of vampire hunting gear he owns. He then asks about his donkey and cart. She replies that will be another 5 gold, each. Grimgar loses his cool but Mitch defuses the situation and offers to pay the rest. Captain Beckett warns the trio that murder in Phlan will not be tolerated not matter what the excuse and tells them to be on their best behavior from now on. Corrin makes a comment about how corrupt the legal system can be sometimes and in the end justice always prevails. Captain Beckett narrows her eyes at the halfling and orders them escorted out of her office.\n\nGrimgar is reunited with Horace and his stuff and they return to the Laughing Goblin.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED...\n\n**[[5e] Defiance in Phlan - Session 5] (https://np.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/51a0xr/5e_defiance_in_phlan_session_5/)**",

        "text": "Hello again! Before we begin, I would like to ask that anyone who did not like the tale or who has any criticism for the story please leave a comment. I do this to improve my writing skills as much as to entertain. Thank you and enjoy.\n\nThis is a continuation of '[Mutants and Masterminds] The Bad, The Mad and The Outright Terrifying: A Super-villain story Part 10', which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/4zmoke/mutants_and_masterminds_the_bad_the_mad_and_the/. Last time, our tenacious freedom fighters sought to disrupt Pinnacle's diabolical plot. Utilising one of their captured Talons, the team led a strike force of mind-controlled Zel'tan aboard the Capital vessel floating above New York City. Finding no-one aboard, the villains cautiously made their way towards the control room. Their progress was thwarted by the appearance of a homicidal speedster, armed with a blade and a bad attitude. After slaughtering their Zel'tan guardsmen, the woman battled with Event Horizon in a high-speed duel before fleeing. Kitsune and his band of rejects followed after her, discovering a laboratory filled with super-powered clones. Among them were the defeated forms of several superheroes; heroes that Minato decided to awaken. This is where we find ourselves now.\n\nThe first thing she heard was voices, though they were far too faint to discern the conversation. It was a note of mild interest to a thoroughly discombobulated mind. Sensation began to creep slowly into her limbs, followed closely by an enveloping chill. There was an intrinsic wrongness about the situation that seemed to percolate through her mental fogginess and the woman began to struggle against the unnatural slumber. Her body may have been weak but even a drug induced coma could not dampen her will. Her eyes cracked open gradually and light exploded into existence, tinted cerulean by the liquid around her. Fuzzy forms shifted outside her containment pod; indistinct shapes tapping at the glass. One of the silhouettes seemed strangely familiar, though there was no way to discern who it was. The internal mechanisms of the container began to shift before it opened suddenly, violently ejecting it's contents across the cold steel floor. She hit the ground with a dull thud, choking down lungfuls of fresh air.\n\n\"Hello River. Long time no see, love.\"  Kitsune smiled warmly down at her, offering the sprawled woman a hand. River Fox moved slowly, her slender frame shaking weakly as she slowly hauled herself to her feet. Minato wrapped a supportive arm around her, murmuring gently to the drained hero. \"Easy, easy. You're alright, River. I've got you.\" She turned to the con-man with a warm, if somewhat fragile, smile.\n\n\"Minato. Here I was thinking you were rotting away in a cell.\" The man in question grinned roguishly back at her, tenderly stroking her face.\n\n\"You know I'm not that easy to get rid of. What happened, beautiful? How the hell did you end up here?\" River Fox's brow furrowed in confusion before clarity came rushing in, realisation burning to the forefront of her mind.\n\n\"The Zel'tan. They attacked us, subdued everyone. They knew all of our weaknesses and how to counteract our abilities. There was someone with them...\" The heroine trailed off as the memory extricated itself from her recovering mind. When it did, her voice was filled with cold fury. \"Pinnacle. It was Pinnacle.\" Kitsune winced and sighed despondently. \n\n\"Yeah, we know. He's been behind all of this. The Zel'tan are just science experiments he whipped up and now he's cloning all of the heroes he took. Some of the villains too.\" He gestured around at the many tanks and their bizarre occupants. \"We still don't know why he kept you alive though. You or any of the others.\" \n\n\"Makes sense. You still need the base DNA to produce a working clone.\" River Fox looked around for the speaker, squinting at a darkly clad form behind a control panel. The man continued speaking as he began fiddling with the console. \"Regardless of whatever super-science bullshit Pinnacle's using, he still has to obey the basic laws of science...I hope.\" The super-heroine glanced questioningly at Kitsune. He winked at her before fulfilling his social obligations.\n\n\"River, let me introduce you to my friends. The educated fellow is Pilot, the tiny demon is Patterdemalion and I think you might be familiar with Event Horizon?\" Minato gestured at each of them in turn, though his genial tone did nothing to alleviate her concern. \"Don't worry, my dear. We're the good guys.\" Event Horizon waved lazily while Patters bowed in mid-air. Pilot said nothing, though the other three containment pods began to open as he typed away. A form collapsed out of each them, translucent liquid pooling around them. River Fox hobbled over to them, shakily kneeling down to inspect the prone heroes. \n\n\"Stonewall, wake up.\" The colossal crime-fighter groaned, feebly trying to fight River Fox off. She rolled her eyes in exasperation and slapped him across the face, wincing as her hand struck rock-hard flesh. \"Get up, old man. The fight isn't over yet.\" Stonewall's eyes flickered open to an unusual sight: River Fox, Kitsune, Event Horizon and Patterdemalion ringing his prone form. \n\n\"River. Who are your friends?\" The rumbling baritone drew smiles from each of them, even Event Horizon. The hydro-kinetic smiled down at her mentor and helped him up. \n\n\"Kitsune, Event Horizon, Patterdemalion and Pilot.\" The super-villains looked up and then they looked up a little more; Stonewall rose to his full height of two metres with surprising grace. \"Pilot's the one in the corner. They pulled us out of those pods, saved us.\" Kitsune smiled disarmingly at the titanic hero, who hummed contemplatively in return.\n\n\"I recognise some of you. Regardless of any past conflict, thank you for your assistance.\" He was so affably heroic that his mannerisms brought about a renewed sense of confidence with the group. \"Let us gather our chums before deciding our next move. No need to repeat yourselves, eh?\" In short order, Doctor Paradox and the Scarlet Sentinel were brought into the fold. The heroes were bewildered but more than ready for action. Stonewall regarded Minato and his coterie with a grin. \"So, we head to the bridge and then use Pinnacle's technology against him?\" Event Horizon shrugged, idly spinning his staff.\n\n\"Yeah, that's about right.\" Stonewall laughed boisterously, clapping one enormous hand on the speedster's shoulder. Event Horizon immediately broke out in a cold sweat, an ingrained reaction to the hero's presence, before remembering the circumstances. \n\n\"Sounds good to me.\" The veteran leader of champions instinctively posed in a heroic fashion, seemingly unaware of just how ridiculous he looked. \"Pinnacle may have beaten us down once but now we have enough of an advantage that the tables have turned.\" The villains looked at each other in confusion, joined by River Fox, before Minato raised his hand. \"Yes, to the stylish fellow.\" Kitsune smiled charmingly in return.\n\n\"Hello again. May I ask what advantage we might possibly have against the individual who took you all out at once?\" Stonewall pointed at him with a pleased expression. \n\n\"You certainly can. In this case, we have four advantages working for us.\" Stonewall raised one mammoth hand and clenched it into a fist. \"First, we have the element of surprise. I doubt even he would be expecting an assault from within one of his own vessels.\" He uncurled one long, thick finger as he spoke. \"Second, Pinnacle is unlikely to have the required substances or circumstances to detain us again. These aren't things he would be able to keep on hand.\" Another digit joined the first. \"Third, a unified assault force composed of the world's greatest heroes and villains would be enough to make even him flinch.\" All present seemed to stand straighter, their chests puffing up even as Stonewall raised a third finger. The superhero smiled proudly at all of them as he dropped his hand. \"Now, let's take the bridge and get this party started.\" The group cheered quietly and prepared to move. Patters floated gently beside Stonewall with a confused grimace.\n\n\"Good paragon, I believe that you originally stated that we had four advantages yet you only listed three. What was the fourth?\" Stonewall smiled at the curious demon, though it lacked the heroic quality of his previous ones. In contrast, this was a barely restrained show of brutality. \n\n\"The fourth is that I am murderously angry, little monster.\" The air grew thick with violent intent as the polar opposites locked eyes. Despite being a demon, born from the fiery bowels of hell and bathed in the blood of innocents, Patterdemalion stopped breathing for a single moment. \"Let us continue.\" The simple phrase broke the tension and Patters took a shuddering breath before floating away. Unknown to Stonewall, the imp had a satisfied smile across his face. The rag-tag group moved with certainty towards the bridge, guided by knowledge Pilot had pulled from the central data repository. \n\n\"It should be just beyond this door.\" The mercenary came to a stop, cocking his head to the side. He held up one clenched fist in a sign for the others to stop before backing away. \"Thermal signatures inside the room. There's some kind of shielding, can't tell exactly how many.\" The misfit brigade exchanged uneasy glances before Stonewall stepped forward. \n\n\"Whatever awaits us behind these doors is simply another obstacle in our path. We overcome it together.\" The inspirational speeches were beginning to wear on everyone's nerves by this point but they could appreciate the sentiment. Event Horizon winked at Kitsune before rushing through the door, a hydraulic hiss preceding his arrival. The rest of the team charged through behind him, only to slam into Event Horizon's floating form. The speedster was held aloft by an invisible force, his limbs slowly contorting against his will. The chamber was poorly illuminated but each of them could see a loose collection of people standing before them. Most alarmingly was the figure sitting on a throne with one hand outstretched, bathed in darkness. Kitsune sucked in breath, feeling for all the world like someone had just struck him. A word slipped from his mouth in a strained whisper.\n\n\"Pinnacle.\" Light flared from the ceiling before dying out, momentarily revealing the smirking visage of their foe. What little illumination leaked through the open doorway was suddenly quenched as the portal sealed behind them. A low chuckle rumbled forth from the darkness as the group was assessed like meat at a market. \n\n\"Welcome to my parlour said the spider to the...\" Pinnacle's deep baritone was interrupted by an explosion of light and sound, the room suddenly well-lit by a pulsating orb of light. There was a great deal of wincing before everyone adjusted to the bright glow, suspended above Doctor Paradox's raised hand. Patters waved one tiny talon and flexed his mental muscles, dispelling the telekinetic grip around Event Horizon. The speedster dropped to the floor, glaring at Pinnacle hatefully. \n\n\"No more games, Pinnacle. No more drama or theatrics.\" Stonewall stepped forward, cracking his goliath fists with the sound of grinding metal. \"This is where you die, you sadistic piece of trash.\" The Scarlet Sentinel rolled her eyes beneath her red mask and tapped her friend on the bicep. \"Hmm? Yes, Scarlet?\" She gestured wordlessly to the loosely gathered motley of figures at the foot of his throne. \"Ah. Right. Let's deal with the henchmen first.\" Both groups began to spread out slowly, silently choosing who to face off against. \n\nEvent Horizon gestured crudely to his fellow speedster across the floor and offered a silent challenge to her, one that was well received. The super-fast murderers twirled their weapons in synchronised motions, their movements identical. Bloodstone and Doctor Paradox squared off as arcane glyphs howled to life around them, the two sorcerers prepared to conclude their age old rivalry. The Scarlet Sentinel approached Lady Chilltouch warily, the martial arts expert carefully analysing her prey. For her part, the vampiric beauty simply blew a kiss at the crimson-clad heroine. Stonewall shook his head sadly at the bestial creature before him; the resemblance between them plain to see even beneath the animalistic features grafted onto the pitiable thing.\n\n\"Brave words, old friend. If you make it through my new team of heroes, perhaps you will have earned the honour of facing me yourself.\" Pinnacle was every inch the smug sovereign, languishing in his throne while his knights battled the enemy. River Fox slipped into a defensive posture as a man clad in resplendent plate mail marched towards her, shimmering golden blade raised. Pinnacle called out to him without looking, his gaze fixed on Kitsune. \"My dear Lionheart. I command you to dispose of these cretins.\" The armoured warrior saluted and shifted into a fencer's position. River Fox squinted before comprehension dawned on her face.\n\n\"Charlemagne? Is that you? What happened to you?\" The heroine recognised her friend, even with the garish raiment he wore now. \"This is not you. You are a chevalier, a champion of justice!\" Her pleas were met with a cold scowl. \n\n\"My name is Lionheart, sworn champion of Lord Pinnacle and destroyer of those who stand in his way.\" His voice, once rich and filled with warmth, was a droning murmur. River Fox sighed mournfully before steeling herself.\n\n\"I am so sorry, Leon. He won't get away with this.\" It was a promise, an oath of vengeance born from grief. There was a moment of silence as each team observed the other; the calm before the storm. Lionheart lunged forward and the serenity shattered. Battle erupted as spells were thrown, blows parried and the Stonewalls clashed with enough force to shake the very walls. Through it all, Pinnacle observed Minato with the same intensity that a cat eyes the canary. The medium and his crew, sans Event Horizon, stood apart from the battle. A dark smile grew slowly across Pinnacle's face as he gestured vaguely at his latest acquisition.\n\n\"Come, my dear golem. It is time for your retribution.\" There was the shriek of electrical discharge as a familiar form coalesced in a dazzling display of lightning. Minato groaned in frustration as Boogaloo's scintillating silhouette glared at them spitefully. The electro-morph sprung towards them, splashing across Patterdemalion's hastily constructed barrier. Pilot and Kitsune flanked their demonic ally, keeping close to the winged imp. Already the strain was becoming evident on Patters' face, his twisted features clenching in exertion.\n\n\"I'm afraid I cannot hold it back for all that long, friends. The creature has grown in strength since our last encounter.\" Even his words came out strangled, as if it was a titanic effort to simply speak. \n\n\"Pinnacle friend gives me power. Pinnacle friend not make demands!\" The voice that erupted from Boogaloo was different, less intelligible. Pilot growled, clenching his weapons in a desperate attempt at calming himself down.\n\n\"That psychopath amped it up somehow. Probably burned off some of it's intelligence in exchange for more juice.\" Minato winced at Pilot's assessment. He glanced around at the various battles roaring across the immense chamber before hardening his resolve.\n\n\"Alright, fuck it. Here's the plan. Patters, keep it off us for as long as you can. Pilot, put as many rounds into the other bad guys as possible. I'm going to try something.\" Kitsune dropped to his knees, hands clasped across his thighs, and closed his eyes. Pilot began firing at Pinnacle's gathered forces, choosing his shots carefully to avoid injuring one of their allies. While his rounds bounced harmlessly off of invulnerable flesh or enchanted armour, he politely questioned their leader's decision.\n\n\"What the fucking fuck are you fucking doing? This is not the time for meditation!\" Even Pinnacle sat forward in his chair, interest piqued. Kitsune answered without opening his eyes, his handsome features scrunched in concentration.\n\n\"I'm a medium. I can contact the spirits of the deceased and bend them to my will.\" The slightest of smiles graced his face as Minato found what he was looking for. \"And a great many superheroes died here, Pilot.\" Realisation struck both the mercenary and his former employer simultaneously, though they reacted in extremely different ways. Pilot began to laugh hysterically while Pinnacle snarled a command.\n\n\"White Dwarf! Kill the spiritualist!\" The female speedster bowed with a flourish, narrowly avoiding pulverisation via Event Horizon, and hurtled across the room with lethal intent. Patterdemalion gave a tinny bellow of defiance and lashed out telekinetically at Boogaloo. The electricity scattered before soaring across the battlefield to reform. His wings beat feebly as he struggled for air before dropping into Pilot's waiting arms. \n\nEach of them felt a strong gust of wind blast past them, followed quickly by another; Pilot was struck with extreme force and sent hurtling back. His armour was contorted and warped by the impact, though he had managed to shield Patters from the blow. Pilot raised his head weakly, staring through his shattered visor past the duelling speedsters. Even with his host of experience and with the circumstances around him, a rush of bile filled his mouth.\n\nThe wall was decorated by a thick red smear, a trail of crimson paint across chitinous canvas. It continued on for a good six feet before tapering off, dribbling gently down the bulwark. The residue pooled messily around the remnants of Kitsune, one eye staring vacantly at nothing with dull surprise. That single orb was all that remained of his face, the result of flesh being dragged across a metal surface at high speed. Little tendrils of smoke twisted lazily from the oozing meat of his brain as his eye fluttered shut and, with little fan-fare, Minato Arisato died. The ghost of Minato Arisato, a faintly glowing thing invisible to the mundane eye, watched on with bewildered aggravation.\n\n\"Wait, what?\"",
