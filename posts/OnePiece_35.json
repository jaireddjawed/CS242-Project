I read a theory about the 4 Road Poneglyphs by someone stating each poneglyph indicating longitude, latitude , height and time of occurrence of One piece. That sure was a wild theory. But Thats when I thought about the time mentioned. \n\nHow would they knew in 20 years it was gonna happen?  Oden also mentions this to toki to go forward 20 years in time to meet someone. Does it mean the One piece is somehow linked to Luffy? Or maybe its just because of the treasure left behind by joyboy?",

It's the reason why Zoro's style is reminiscent of Ushimaru who Zoro never met. Zoro originally used multiple swords to try to overtake Kuina, but as a Shimotsuki, Koshirou probably showed Zoro the finer points of multiple sword usage.\n\n\nZoro also had enough battle IQ to pick certain aspects on his own like Santoryu(3 Sword Style), Copying flame rend from Kinemon, and mastering the breath of all things mid battle (which was a concept taught by Koshirou. )",

So what is the twist I'm talking about?\n\nAt the end of chapter 1058 Sabo called Dragon from Lulusia. But WHAT is Dragon doing when that happened? He **ordered PX-0**, Kuma himself, to tell him what happened at Mariejoa - to which Kuma replies **\"As you command\"**.\n\nI think that secretly Dragon has the highest authority over all Pacifista - even by Den Den Mushi, which is not possible for the Gorosei.

(currently at ice oni part of Wano). It started with Fishman arc of me telling myself it's \"just this arc that's awful i just gotta tough through it and itll get good again!\", and then I told myself the same for Punk Hazard, and then Dressrosa and then Cake Island. Then it hit me. It's not \"just this arc\" that's horrible to watch. It's the entire fucking anime since the timeskip. I don't get why people are so against filler arcs in the big shows. The alternatives are either taking a long break (which they'll never do) or making the \\*actual fucking story which we all watch it for\\* one long fucking filler. It ruins the whole experience.  \nI don't want to read the manga as the main reason I watch one piece is for the fights. The music, color and animations add a lot to the experience that a picture cannot do.  \nI'm still going to finish the anime as I've spent 15 years of my life watching it, but fuck me I hate how slow it is.  \nI thought Wano would fix it as the pacing started out pretty good, but once again, I was wrong.\n\n//rant over",

They **don‚Äôt** need to be mined out of caves by exploiting the poorest people in Africa. **BUT** the monopoly in charge, the De Beers Group, has such a rigid control over how diamonds are produced and distributed, they can slap whatever price they want on every single diamond.\n\nHave you ever been shopping around for an engagement ring, and have someone shame you into spending ‚ÄúX‚Äù amount of money to prove to your fianc√©e that you really love them?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ppu0845bzbla1.png?width=797&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b8e8ba1107446710a620423fff3a95a95f96c3c1\n\nDe Beers‚Äô marketing campaign on diamonds was so massively successful that it has transcended into popular culture. Where there is even a James Bond film named after their most iconic tagline of:\n\n[Diamonds Are Forever](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066995/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r1reyw4hzbla1.png?width=566&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d8c4643417b1044523125770d38b439ba9c99467\n\n***SO THEN***, that got me thinking **YET** *again*, to One Piece‚Äôs Bond Villain:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/otqyxrvjzbla1.png?width=861&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2f08bc4eed448cb5a0225ff305baef60b795e22d\n\nThat‚Äôs right, my main guy, **Sir Crocodile**.\n\nFor those who are my familiar with my work on this subreddit, call me an agenda-pusher all you want. But Shanks and Blackbeard each have their dedicated legion of hype-men. Often, I feel like I‚Äôm the only one riding the Cross Guild hype-train. Hell, I‚Äôm probably the only one willing to conduct the train. \n\nBut hey‚Ä¶I‚Äôll take the job with pleasure. So, hop right in and enjoy! üòä\n\nBesides, the environment surrounding the Laboshere is strangely reminiscent of Alabasta:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vilq707vzbla1.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=13f9ba60e692efaec2c5b1e146fb9220bef4c9be\n\nThose palm trees and pyramids‚Ä¶I sense a *foreshadowing* going on. \n\nI‚Äôm thinking Vegapunk might‚Äôve struck a backroom deal with Crocodile while the guy was a Warlord. Possibly, to sell a few of the diamonds that he made in his lab on the Black Market. To make a little extra cash on the side.\n\nHowever, Vegapunk is not a black-market broker. He‚Äôs a scientist. A scientist who is so busy conducting his research that he had to split himself into 7 parts. And I doubt he or his 6 Satellites know the first thing about brokering anything on the Black Market.\n\nBut Crocodile might.\n\nI am almost positive there is a connection between Vegapunk and Crocodile. Oda gave us the clue with Lassoo, the dog-gun:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6tz2hcq80cla1.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=59cd78ab480ac1ca8c5f5b76c90dd44ec9f8065b\n\nI‚Äôd say there is a 99.6% chance that Lassoo was something whipped up by Vegapunk/the SSG. But the question that has been looming since the Alabasta Arc is ‚ÄòHow did Baroque Works (i.e., Crocodile) come to acquire him?‚Äô.\n\nWe may finally get an answer before the Egghead Island Arc wraps up.\n\nAnother subtle clue Oda may‚Äôve dropped was in the last chapter of the Alabasta Arc. In Chapter 218, Robin wins Nami‚Äôs favor by gifting her a bag of gems she had gotten from Crocodile:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/da27le0d0cla1.png?width=636&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=dd03f3653b2a66111515b28783fbebcda5033c39\n\nCould these gems have been created on Egghead? I‚Äôm now seriously considering that they were. And Nami damn near took off with a backpack full of Egghead gems:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vnmf6tg0cla1.png?width=416&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e2b7e5e9f8ef92bd58fefe7a33e0440a99ecb1a4\n\n  \n\nEdison says these diamonds are only for industrial purposes. Which could very well be their intended purpose.\n\nBut maybe Vegapunk was hoping to earn some extra cash on the side? So that way, the World Government wouldn‚Äôt be his sole source of funding. What are a few missing diamonds out of thousands?\n\nBesides, in order to fetch the highest price per gem, he wouldn‚Äôt want to overflood the market with them anyways. Only a few.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Why Crocodile Makes Sense\n\nI‚Äôve heard/read a couple of theories suspecting that Blackbeard is looking capture Vegapunk. With his crew essentially being devil-fruit hunters, Vegapunk‚Äôs research into devil fruits would be most valuable to them. However, I think Blackbeard is a bit too old school of a pirate to really capitalize on Vegapunk‚Äôs genius. \n\nAs for Crocodile, he really is one hell of a Bond Villain. When he felt that he couldn‚Äôt conquer the world on sheer might alone, he went for the ancient weapon, Pluton. In the Bond film, *Diamonds Are Forever*, Blofeld, the main bad guy of the film and a possible inspiration for Crocodile, had a plan to create a satellite laser. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i5v7c9rv0cla1.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3d112e2d9719acf6c9b81c14018266a2b740ecd3\n\nOr a ‚ÄòDeath Ray‚Äô, if you will. \n\nIn Chapter 1060, it seems the World Government may already be in possession of something like a Death Ray. Could be Uranus? We‚Äôre not sure yet. \n\nEither way, Crocodile‚Äôs end-goal is likely to amass power that would surpass that of the World Government's. This was pretty much the goal he had described in Alabasta in Chapter 193:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ypu0mmw01cla1.png?width=1006&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5b25610044c2bf89fea7ebdd9a2097db42f4c4c3\n\nBut since he failed in his plot to acquire Pluton, the next best thing he could do is kidnap the guy whose been developing the latest weaponry for the Marines. Futuristic tech that no one else has access to. \n\nIf Crocodile already has a prior connection to Vegapunk, possibly through illicit diamond sales, he may‚Äôve already devised a plot on how to kidnap him. And it may finally be playing out now.\n\nBut just how exactly?\n\nWell‚Ä¶\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Caribou?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w50x4ej61cla1.png?width=631&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a99e33336e62585d9e028b2f4990caf5557f5647\n\nYouTuber, Randy Troy, [has this interesting theory speculating that Caribou was formerly a member of Baroque Works as Mr. 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COtfj7bamsk). \n\nCaribou has been MIA for several chapters now. And I can totally see him being the one sabotaging the Labosphere. Pissed with how the Straw Hats kicked him off to the curb. However, Caribou never expected for the Straw Hats to dock on a government island. Much less Egghead Island. \n\nMaybe he found a den den mushi somewhere, hoping to catch a ride? But instead, he was given an order to sabotage the island as much as possible. Huge stretch. But I think it could‚Äôve happened. \n\nHe then snatched up Stella-Vegapunk while he was in his baby-form, forced him to point out the location of every camera, and then threw him in a holding cell while the rest of the Labo-Sabotage/Vegapunk-Kidnap plan unfolds. \n\nHowever, if Caribou is now working under orders from the Cross Guild, I doubt he‚Äôs working alone. ***Because*** his landing on Egghead was an unexpected surprise.\n\nSo, who could he be working with?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Stussy?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/usrvc5dm1cla1.png?width=570&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=513fcf946e7c334946bfd9ef106a479ffd1db2d3\n\nLook, I still think this chick is suspect as hell. \n\nAnd I think she's the one giving Caribou orders on how to sabotage the Labo. She may've spotted him lurking around after being kicked off the Sunny and recognized him as a former Baroque Works Agent. Maybe she found a way to call him?\n\nJust in Chapter 1073, Shaka revealed that Stussy has been an undercover for the SSG for ten years. However, it was a situation that wasn‚Äôt exactly planned. \n\nSo, to me, her true loyalties remain in question. She may see it as a benefit to protect the Vegapunks at all costs. Even at the risk of blowing her cover. But is this all out of loyalty to Vegapunk, her creator? Or does she have some ulterior motive that has yet to be revealed?\n\nIn a previous post of mine, [Stussy, the Revolutionary?](https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/zjhbdo/stussy_the_revolutionary_1069_spoilers/), I had theorized that Stussy‚Äôs true allegiance is with the Revolutionary Army. While I didn‚Äôt know Stussy was a clone when I made that post, I still think it holds some merit. \n\nWith the Seraphim, it appears that all of Vegapunk‚Äôs clones start off as children. So, it‚Äôs possible that Stussy was recruited into Cipher Pol as a child. Most, if not all, Cipher Pol Agents are recruited as children. We saw that during Lucci‚Äôs flashback. And it was a subject touched on in Big Mom‚Äôs flashback:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nxy6302x1cla1.png?width=577&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e51c007f92952120491dfc74d3887ccc54f89c02\n\nClones do appear to have their own Will. So, maybe Stussy joined the Revolutionary‚Äôs cause to bring an end to child trafficking? The World Government had stolen away her childhood and made her into their pawn. \n\nOr maybe Stussy isn‚Äôt too bothered about children bought and sold on the Black Market and isn‚Äôt a Revolutionary at all?\n\nFor the purpose of this post, would she be an ally of Crocodile‚Äôs?\n\nCrocodile is hellbent on tearing down the system. And has shown that by the Cross Guild issuing bounties against the Marines. Perhaps, all Stussy wants is revenge? Or she is just bored and simply wants to watch the world burn?\n\nRegardless, I still think Stussy is making moves to execute something **big**. **Huge**. Whatever it is, it had to be something worth blowing her cover with the World Government.\n\nHer latest move, I believe, was making a call to Big News Morgans in Chapter 1074:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eq5q64g72cla1.png?width=867&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=921d6673291143bc7c6033a1c85bb600559abb34\n\nDuring the Whole Cake Island Arc, we saw Stussy and Morgans being buddy-buddy. With Stussy sometimes giving Morgans the inside scoop into developing news. But only if it can be spun in a way that favors her objectives. Whatever those objectives are‚Ä¶\n\nIn this latest spin, the World Governments comes off as a bunch of evil assholes and that the Straw Hats are on the warpath. Neither party looks too good. So, definitely, Stussy is no ally to the World Government or the Straw Hats. And maybe not even Vegapunk. \n\nUnless‚Ä¶\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# F*ck a Murder Mystery. This is a Full-Blown Conspiracy Plot!\n\nOne worthy of its own Bond film, in my opinion. \n\nInstead of asking which Vegapunk is the traitor, what if they are all ‚Äútraitors‚Äù?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lurhxh4k2cla1.png?width=569&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4c8d8e044a027fd6688884045f03ee5a9a166003\n\nLook, I think Vegapunk is generally a good guy. And I think he genuinely wants to travel with the Straw Hats. However, the guy may‚Äôve gotten caught up with some bad business. Possibly, the aforementioned diamond-racket he had been running with Crocodile that I had suggested earlier?\n\nWith Buggy in Chapter 1058, we saw that Crocodile is something of a predatory businessman:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i2655wdq2cla1.png?width=839&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f78e6906b884877fdf357560989b9f468da6d922\n\nBecause Buggy defaulted on his loan, he‚Äôs essentially become Crocodile and Mihawk‚Äôs slave. Crocodile wasn‚Äôt going to let Buggy escape Emptee Bluffs while he owed him money. And I doubt Crocodile would let his diamond-producer and future weapons manufacturer escape either. \n\nReally, the Vegapunks are currently caught between a rock and a hard place. On one side, they have the World Government out to assassinate them. On the other, they got a notorious pirate right on their ass. \n\nHowever, the Straw Hats may be giving the Vegapunks the very narrow out that they need. So, why would they try to sabotage their own rescue?\n\nWell‚Ä¶maybe all 7 Vegapunks don't want to be saved? \n\nLilith (Evil) and Edison (Thinker) are the sketchiest ones. With Lilith being all about the money to fund research. And Edison being named after Thomas Edison, famous inventor but ruthless businessman. They may see it as a benefit to side with the Cross Guild over the Straw Hats. Therefore, they are looking to betray them. \n\nSame could be speculated about York (Greed). And maybe even Atlas (Violence) and Pythagoras (Wisdom). All fairly negative traits. Wisdom, depending how you look at it. \n\nShaka (Good), I believe, is neutral. He might be hoping for the best. That, they all escape from Egghead with the Straw Hats. But expects the worst. Where the escape fails. And maybe a few of Satellites get caught in the crossfire.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i8wkqe2c3cla1.png?width=522&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=18746b45522573dbc4031a64eb1038ddf7743ccc\n\nThen, there‚Äôs the main Vegapunk, Stella. Who, I believe, is completely oblivious to whatever fuckery his 6 Satellites have been up to. But he knows how he‚Äôs at fault.\n\nThe whole diamond-racket thing, that was all his idea. He probably met Crocodile as a Warlord in Marie Jois or something like that. Then, struck a backroom deal with him to sell diamonds on the Black Market. But as far as the sabotage of his lab and imprisonment of Cipher Pol Agents, that might be all on his Satellites. And they are now just roping him into their grand plan.  \n\nTraveling on a ship with the Straw Hats, they won‚Äôt have the money or space to continue working on research. The whole purpose for their existence. But if Crocodile had proposed a deal sometime in the past to supply main-Vegapunk with all the money he needs, along with a new lab, that might be something the 6 Satellites remember. And is something they might want. Even if main-Vegapunk had originally declined. I‚Äôm thinking this could have taken place while Crocodile had his plans set in motion for takeover of Alabasta. \n\nWith Vegapunk's whole arrangement with the World Government going up in smoke in the moment, the 6 Satellites might be going right for Crocodile‚Äôs deal. And may‚Äôve even been the ones to set Stella-Vegapunk up.\n\nBased on what Stella-Vegapunk said in Chapter 1076, it seems that the reason why the World Government turned on him was because it got ***leaked*** that he was researching the poneglyphs:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c7fkff7p4cla1.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=62364d5cf8078459f9816deb9abe2f7e5a3cad47\n\nWhat if Crocodile found out about Pluton through Vegapunk‚Äôs research? If not from Vegapunk himself, then maybe through one of his 6 Satellites?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wy6sed4w4cla1.png?width=480&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fc8b75110651f5d0ef120a41949a472eed1a31d7\n\nOne or a couple of Satellites are playing into Vegapunk's more conniving nature. Where the research must continue. No matter the cost. \n\nAnd maybe Stussy did not just snitch out the World Government to Morgans. But Vegapunk to the World Government, too.\n\nI sense a perfect storm brewing in Egghead. With not just one or two betrayals. But several.\n\nAll because Vegapunk has a tendency to make shady business deals with not-so-great people.\n\n**Hey! Bonus Thought:** \n\nIf Crocodile has been in cahoots with Vegapunk, maybe he's in possession of the S-Croc Seraphim? Maybe Vegapunk reported him as a failure because he couldn't replicate Crocodile's sand-logia powers. So, now Crocodile has his own mini-me like Dr. Evil from Austin Powers. An imperfect clone. But something he's grown to love. Dumb thought, sure. But I think it would be funny.\n\n#   \n\n# Conclusion\n\nI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a coincidence that all the major players from the Alabasta Arc are suddenly becoming relevant again. We just got an update on Vivi in Chapter 1074. So, she might get roped into this conspiracy going on in Egghead thanks to her current connection with Morgans. She might just pick on it first that it‚Äôs Crocodile up to no good yet again. And might try to find a way to warn Luffy, now knowing where he is and what is going on. \n\nRegardless, we should be getting some updates on what other things the Cross Guild has cooking other than the Marine bounties. And I‚Äôm about 99.9% sure Crocodile has his eyes set on Vegapunk. So, he might be behind all the screwy stuff that has been going down on Egghead. If not, he plans on getting his hand on that genius one way or another. Make him a useful slave just like Buggy.\n\nThen next, is to take over the world. ***Muahahahaha!***\n\nThinking of Vegapunk, he might be a perfect example of a dumb smart person. When it comes to math and science, he will always be the smartest person in the room. But when it comes to business, he's still liable for getting scammed. Understanding people may not be his strong suit. Rather, it is his weak point. And it might just be a weak point that a guy like Crocodile would be happy to exploit.\n\n# TL;DR: \n\nMassive conspiracy plot being orchestrated on Egghead Island by none other than the Cross Guild/Crocodile. Beginning with Crocodile &amp; Vegapunk making a deal many moons ago to sell diamonds on the Black Market. Vegapunk got extra money for his research. Crocodile just got richer. But ultimately, Crocodile wants to steal Vegapunk for himself to create weapons of mass destruction. To rival the World Government. And he‚Äôs orchestrating this kidnap/sabotage plot with Caribou, Stussy, and the 6 Vegapunk Satellites. \n\nI think there is something brewing in Egghead worthy of its own Bond film. Making Crocodile a true Bond Villain. \n\nThat's all for now, folks. Hope you enjoyed! And thanks for tuning in!",

        "text": "**SETUP FOR BLACKBEARD AND WHY**\nBB will wait for Revolutionaries, Dragon, and yonko Luffy to fight a war with the government. Why? Because he did it during Marineford to steal Newgate's fruit. BB instigated that whole conflict by handing over a captured ace, knowing the government would broadcast it to the world, and that Newgate will rescue Ace. He will do it again.\n\n\n**THE FINAL WAR - PHASE ONE**\nBB steps in after the government's forces start collapsing. Luffy will fight, and defeat Imu, why? Because Imu is Luffy's contrast narratively. Luffy is sun god Nika, warrior of liberation, and Imu is the god of the world working in the shadows, and the dictator of chains which restrain the world. It's possible Luffy and Dragon fight together, but I suspect Dragon WILL die. It'll symbolise the handing over of revolutionary /rebellious leadership and freedom to Luffy. Luffy's position of warrior of liberation foreshadows this. Dragon is the one who's fight for freedom through actions. Therefore, Luffy will inherit the position of Yonko, leader of the grand fleet, and leader of the revolutionary army, even if he wants none of those. \n\n**THE FINAL WAR - PHASE TWO**\nNow queue BB. As I said, he's waiting for the government and revolutionaries to weaken. While Luffy and Dragon fight Imu Sama, BB will action his plan, and finish off the government. At this point the BB pirates and their allies will also attack the weakened revolutionaries. With Dragons death, Luffy will gain the courage and defeat Imu Sama. He will probably be out of commission some time, and in that time, BB will crush the government completely, and have the revolutionaries on the retreat. The straw hats will defend the our of commissioned Luffy while BB's captains of his fleet will attempt to assassinate Luffy while he's weak.\n\n**THE FINAL WAR - PHASE 3**\nLuffy will recover, and through his inspiration as a leader, his cunning personality, and his resolve, will crush the BB pirates with his allies, friends, and the straw hats by his side. BB will be defeated, but I believe he will accept how Luffy changed the world. Afterall, he himself believes in people's dreams to bring in a new age, and showed that with his speech to Luffy back in Jaya.\n\nAny thoughts? Do you think it'll play out differently?",

Many think that it has a yet to be shown purpose, but what could that be?\n\nThe only way it makes sense for me is that we should see this ranking in the \"Power System\", in order to think that they could eventually beat the Yonkou.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut if you ask me the battles have only one purpose: Deliver the rubbings to the Big Players.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. It would be strange to see Shanks and Blackbeard on Laugh Tale, telling us that they have been on Zou and in Wano to get there. This way we can see for ourselves how they got there.\n2. Just imagine they would be defeated by Kid and Law, what then? They stop being Yonkou an meet each other at Shakkis Bar, drinking Tea and waiting for the news about Luffy,Law and Kid?\n3. They are both tied to the final story, more then any other Big Player if you ask me.\n4. The Paramount War had 3 Major groups: WB Pirates fighting Marines, Marines fighting WB Pirates, Escapists fighting for their own goals. Any more would have made it hard to follow. So if the Final War had Shanks, Blackbeard, Straw Hat Fleet, Law, Kid, Marines and Buggys Crew fighting in an all out Battle Royale that would be just zu much. I am sure that in the end it has to be cut down to less Characters.\n\nKid wont die, because Saul will recognize him and stop Shanks from killing him.\n\nLaw wont die, because he is the shit.\n\nBut they will be defeated and have no other option then but joining the Grand Fleet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you think about this?",

Perhaps kuina‚Äôs preparation is too difficult which delays her return. Sabo lost his memory or it was repressed and something major had to occur. Perhaps kuina got implanted with a devil fruit that is connected to gomu gomu no mi, model: Nika, and it triggered the devil fruit in kuina when luffy entered 5th gear.",
