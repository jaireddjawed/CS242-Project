        "text": "Not sure if this is the right sub, but since my question is about devices that are part of the biohacking and transhumanist vision, I'll try my luck here.\n\nI want to own my data a bit more, and part of this would be to carry my BTC wallet on me, but in a way that doesn't rely on a hardware wallet or my phone. Body mod is far out of my comfort zone, so no implants. \n\nI found two smart rings which could potentially help me do that, but I have to admit I have no idea what to look for. The first one is the [Magic Ring by Dangerous Things](https://dangerousthings.com/product/magic-ring/), and the second one is the [Apex Ring by VivoKey](https://vivokey.com/ring/). Does anyone have any experience with these? Which one seems more compatible with my intended use as a BTC wallet?\n\nP.S.: This is not a pro/anti Bitcoin post, I just want information about the tech behind those rings and if it is appropriate for my intended use.",

        "text": "1). Most Transhumanists don’t care about Neuralink. It’s likely vaporware, and it’s less effective than similar existing technology like Utah Arrays. And neither is capable of controlling you or reading your thoughts. \n\n2). There is very little overlap between Transhumanism and Transexuality. The only real overlap is that both have a similar name and support morphological freedom (that’s basically the right to change your body)\n\n3). Most Transhumanists aren’t anti-Religion. In fact, one of the founders of the ideology was a Catholic priest. Also, the Church of Mormon is friendly to Transhumanism. \n\n4). We don’t want to force you to eat ze bug. Most Transhumanists believe in switching to lab-grown meat instead of bug meat. \n\n5). We think that Crypto and NTFs are stupid too. \n\n6). Yuval Noah Harari is very anti-tech authoritarianism, not for it. This would be obvious if people saw his entire speeches and not clipped soundbytes. \n\n7). Not all Transhumanists believe in body augmentation. Some believe that people should keep their bodies, but we should be able to medically cure every issue they may have. \n\n8). On that note, Transhumanism isn’t only about body augmentation. It’s about using scientific and technological progress to better the human condition.",

        "text": "So, I’ve come across this thing a lot of times and I just wanted to ask the community regarding this. To make it simpler, let’s have a process-\n\nA computer scans all of your neurons and keeps performing the scans regularly to update itself. Your brain is now slowly replaced by artificial neurons that can mimick your actual neurons.\n\nMeanwhile a new cybernetic body is being constructed which contains a replica of nervous system but made up of artificial neurons and without the brain. The neurons in this body will be constantly updated with the information from the computer. When both the things are done, your now mechanical brain would be transplanted in the new body. When you wake up is it still you?\n\nMy take is that I feel like consciousness is a constant simulation of the nervous system. So, even if neurons are replaced, the simulation shouldn’t be destroyes, provided that you have a replica of your central, peripheral and intristic nervous system.\n\nTo take the ship analogy, I think that the nervous system is a ship while the mind is the passenger onboard. If the ship is slowly replaced, the passenger shouldn’t be affected. Obviously this is just my gut feeling on the nature of mind and we have to wait for actual evidence. But, till then, what are your thoughts on this?",

        "text": "as neuralink and other similar tech come closer to reality there is a question that increasingly needs to be addressed as time goes by what to actually do with the tech when it arrives? \n\nsure a lot of disabled people will likely get these brain uplinks to better control their prosthetics but what about an average person what functions would entice them to expect this and install it? I don't know about everyone else but brain surgery even minor brain surgery to essentially put a smartphone in my head seems a little extreme when I can just buy a normal smartphone and skip the surgery.\n\nso I think there are 2 applications that are currently within our realm of tech to do right now that will be awesome enough to convince the average joe that this is the way to go. \n\n1. neuralink-based VR like the matrix but for virtually any game you want er minus being trapped in the simulation thing. given the huge push for VR recently it would seem the natural leap in technology.\n2. brain controlled mini mechs, mechs in general are something a lot of people want but making one that can move and respond the way people would want requires not only amazing programming but also an interface able to account for all possible movements you could tell it to do. motion capture has a time delay and requires space in the mech to move your body while any game-style controlers would either not be able to do everything you would want or be so complex you would need a college course just to walk let alone anything useful. so cutting out the middle man and connecting the machine directly to the brain simply makes the most sense and lets any idiot pilot them for both business and pleasure.\n\nin either case, I think making a type of sport for it either a mech battle sport or a VR e-sport would further help the general public accept this leap in technological tools.\n\nso what do you think of my ideas to popularize mental uplink technology do you like them or do you think there is there something else that will get humanity to accept this?\n\n ",

Our houses resemble the traditional stave churches of Norway, as do our shared buildings, and of course, our church, where we make prayers to our guardian angels who serve us well on our command.\n\nNearly all of our food is hunted or gathered; the lands nearby have bountiful stocks of game to kill, not to mention fruits and vegetables to pick, the sea of course is likewise plentiful in fish such as salmon, as well as other forms of seafood such as oysters. Sometimes, we get special ingredients such as spices and exotics airdropped in, instantly, as a result of prayer. Of course, we also get our clothes, weapons, and the like through ordering them in much the same way, as it would be impractical to make them ourselves.\n\nI educate my children by the traditional method in which my pre-industrial ancestors used, through experience, discovery, and the sharing of stories; combined with the occasional instant direct memory transfer, when it makes sense to do so.\n\nWhenever something really goes awry for someone, like them spraining their ankle or getting a bacterial infection, instead of using a traditional method of treatment, they just use a direct command prompt to the server, the process here guised as prayer to keep the aesthetic intact, to immediately restore their body to an optimal state.\n\nOf course, we have no need for money, government, or anything else of that sort here, and the entire simulated planet we live on is much the same, an idyllic tranquil world of stunning natural beauty, more stunning than Earth, in fact.\n\nUploading my mind to the cloud and beaming it to a supercomputer in orbit around Jupiter was truly the best choice I'd ever made, when I was 81 years old on Earth, in the year of our lord 2077. Not only was I instantly young again in terms of mental faculties, but I could live as long as I wanted, in any setting I wanted, using any body I wanted, on demand. Sure, my wife, children, and everyone else in this community I live in are NPCs, but the bliss of it all makes it so ideal. If I wanted to go interact with other non-NPCs, maybe I'd just switch over to a different server, such as one with large cities, or where NPCs are banned.\n\nOh, and the virtual oysters taste better than the real thing, as does the virtual moose prosciutto, the virtual gravlax, and the virtual berries.\n\nIf I ever get bored, I can always wipe my memories, spend a lifetime in Earth School for the sake of perspective, a server where you go after each reset, and then get back to life in a place like this, or otherwise. Of course, I could always self-delete, but why would I? I want to live for aeons in the cloud, experience all there is to experience, and create all there is to create; this is man's ultimate dream, to become like the deities of our ancient mythologies.\n\nPerhaps some day you'll join me.",

        "text": " \n\nHey  reddit! Some of you may recall a team of researchers posting a survey a    little while ago re: the use of enhancements (e.g., pharmaceuticals,    other drugs, supplements, and brain stimulation) to improve  performance   in videogames and esports contexts. Well, that’s us – and  we’ve since   published on the study. A big thank you to everyone here  who   participated in, or otherwise supported, the research! You can  view the paper \\[[here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3549494)\\] (or [here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maximilian-Friehs/publication/365011003_Enhanced_Esports_Community_Perspectives_on_Performance_Enhancers_in_Competitive_Gaming/links/6363700f54eb5f547c9bd995/Enhanced-Esports-Community-Perspectives-on-Performance-Enhancers-in-Competitive-Gaming.pdf) if the prior link does not give you full access).\n\nWe were specifically interested in community **perceptions**    of performance enhancer usage in esports. To that end, we weren’t    investigating actual rate or frequency of usage amongst our participants    (sidenote: this would be particularly difficult to do, as people are    unlikely to readily divulge this information – especially esports  pros).   As such, here is a quick tl;dr of our results:\n\n* In    an analysis of online community discussion, we found there were six    broad ways in which people organically discuss enhancement usage in    games and esports. These include: **health concerns** (e.g., fears of, experiences with, negative impacts on mental and physical health); **recommendation seeking and giving** (e.g., seeking and providing information about various enhancers); **belief of effect on gameplay** (e.g., descriptions and conjecture about the effect of enhancers on experiences and performance); **discussion of use in professional contexts** (e.g., ethics, regulations, and speculation about the usage of enhancers in esports); and **motivation for use** (e.g., motivations or rationales for personally using enhancers).\n* We    found that 50 – 60% of our respondents were either willing to use –  or   are already using – enhancements to improve their performance  in-game,   to various degrees. This is, of course, moderated by the  context of  play  (e.g., amateur/hobbyist vs. professional) and the type  of  enhancement.\n* Our participants suspected that **almost half**    of top level players use performance enhancers (again, varying by    enhancement type). Overall, people are concerned about performance    enhancers’ impact on the integrity of professional esports.\n\nNote    that the above are all super broad takeaways, and don’t really touch   on  the nuances of our findings – I encourage anyone interested to  check   out the full paper.\n\nOnce  again, a   massive THANK YOU to those who participated (as well as to  the mods  who  allowed us to post here). We hope you find the above  interesting,  and  we’re happy to answer any questions you may have  about the  research. :)",
