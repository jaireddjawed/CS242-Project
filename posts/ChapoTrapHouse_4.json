I’m in education and it’s been a trial trying to point a light on this on a significant scale both inside education and inside leftist circles in general to talk about this cyst in a fundamental aspect of society. \n\nBut folks, it’s worthy of attention for it’s own shits and giggles. Between AEI, Fordham institute, EdWeek, EdNext, Education Post, The 74, Chalkbeat (probably the better of the bunch) there is a whole mirror industry on par with the water headed opinion writers. Ed has its own cottage industry of Mcardles, podhoretzes, Brookses, and even a Weiss or two. \n\nProgressives are gaining steam in some areas. The attention after the strikes are helpful, but it’s going to take a lot to get the reigns back from these tongue chewing sociopaths, so I would highly suggest paying attention and jumping in. Citations Needed, Have You Heard, FreshEd, BustEd Pencils, and even Majority Report from time to time is a good place to start. \n\nAlright, rant over.
