I used the Blink example and inserted the arduino into the pcb and same result with the LED (glowing dimly) and not blinking at all. So, in conclusion, while on the board the Arduino does not work. It is not the first time I encounter this peculiar phenomena of a LED somehow picking up current when should not. Both on PCBs and once in a 7 seg display on a protoboard. Why does this happens? I tested the PCB connections and they work as they should, so my theory its that because shitty soldering the LED is wirelessly picking up  current but as I said it has happened to me before??

Since I was young I loved playing with electronics, started programming Arduinos by age 10 and just finished my electronics technician course last year (together with high-school), after participating in every science and robotics related thing I could find (FIRST, Intel ISEF, clubs etc).  I am 18 years old now.\n\nThis year I've started an internship in an electronics contractor, working mostly designing PCBs, assembling them and writing firmware (agricultural monitoring solution).  \nHowever after all this I've started to feel less and less interested in \\_\\_working\\_\\_ as an EE. I know, you never start at the top, however many of my colleagues are EEs with years of experience and they still have the same menial roles as me. After talking to some of my teachers about job prospects in the field, most of them told me that's the way things are, not only where I work but in Brazil in general. Many of them didn't even want to be teachers initially, but liked the prospect of a stable job with reasonably good pay (state school = you never get fired).\n\nKeeping this in mind, I'm not sure I want to work as an EE anymore. I feel it'd just make me hate something I like and feel interested while not accomplishing anything. Apparently R&amp;D jobs are virtually non-existent in Brazil, so it's not even a matter of \"waiting for the right opportunity to come\", but the fact that there are no opportunities. I've taken the SAT Subjects test and will take the SAT soon, however my chance of studying abroad and living in the US is pretty slim, as I'd require a lot of financial aid (even though my family is not poor, BRL is worthless compared to USD; consider that the minimum wage in Brazil is USD3,800/yr). \n\nWhat are your opinions? Any advice?  \n\n\nThanks,  \nPedro ",

My gpa is 3.0 right now but I'm confident these classes will pull it to a 3.05 at least. \n\nThe biggest problem of mine is I don't have any internship experience, all I have is a position of Lead Instructor at a summer STEM education camp, and a position as a grader for a graduate level Logic Design class. I realize this isn't ideal for applying for entry level jobs.\n\nI'm mostly looking for entry level embedded systems stuff but honestly I'll take anything. As for improving my chances, I have conflicting advice. Some say I should focus on independent projects I do in my free time, while others say I should look for intern or volunteer roles in embedded systems. My question relates to the later: how do I find volunteer roles in embedded systems? I've tried job search engines but can't really find anything relating to that. To be honest,   I'm not quite sure what to do, any advice would be great.\n\nTL;DR: Recent(ish) CompE grad with no internship experience looking for advice on how to get an entry level embedded systems job.",

        "text": "Hello everybody!\n\nI need to measure small currents (0-0.5 A) with around 5 mA or 10 mA precision. The goal is to measure power consumption in an embedded system. I have found some papers that use current mirrors and other methods that use transistors and capacitors. however, I was looking for an already made module like the Sparkfun ACS712. I tried this one but the 5A one was not working for me. I followed [this] (https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/acs712-low-current-sensor-hookup-guide?_ga=2.64496367.138447177.1529521271-1256883217.1529521271) tutorial using the same sensor but supposedly with extra circuitry to enhance precision but did no get it working (if anyone has used this and worked I would appreciate some advice). **So, does anyone know any module to accomplish my goal?? If not module what has worked for you?**\n\nThe current eventually has to be transformed to voltage so the Arduino Adc can pick it up?\n\nAnd last question: in the worst case lets say the embedded system is just a black box, could I connect a shunt resistor in series and measure current there? \n\nThanks in advance (: ",

The idea here was to use a charge pump to boost the supply of the High side gate driver higher than the input voltage Vin. So I have some questions:\n\n1) The link below explains the concept and use of a bootstrap circuit. \nhttp://micro.rohm.com/en/techweb/knowledge/dcdc/dcdc_sr/dcdc_sr01/829\n\nso it says that Vin at the drain is the highest voltage in circuit and that VGS should be higher than it. But the gate voltage can only be a Vthreshold higher than the drain because if it goes any higher the MOSFET gets into triode. Are we operating the POWER MOSFET here in triode/cutoff or saturation/cutoff? \n\n2) Why do we care about supplying the **power supply** of the gate driver circuit with a voltage higher than Vin? How does this translate into a higher VGS?\n\n3) I am not sure I understand the schematic to the right. Say that the Low side mosfet is closed while the high side is open. Then the cap is charged to Internal supply - Vf (where vf is the diode forward voltage). If low side is open and the high side is closed, how does the high-side gate driver power supply = Vin + Internal supply voltage - Diode VF ?",

If the motor was in storage I would get the data plate info and that would be it. If the motor was in use and hooked up to one of the process machines I would also record the purpose. (e.g. sump pump, combustion blower, dust collector, etc.) Then I made a master list for the entire site; with 600+ motors.\n\nThen my boss decided to cut my celebration of being done short with a new task. He said he wanted motor standardization. Basically, if there's a chance to use a single motor across a piece of equipment that currently has different types, he wants me to find the best one to use. So if all the dryers on site can use Motor X, but Dryer 1 has Motor A, Dryer 2 has Motor B (and so on) he wants all of the motors to be replaced with Model X so that we can only use that, train on it, and stock it.\n\nI have absolutely no idea how to even start on this. My boss keeps telling me to find out on my own how to do it by asking operators and doing research. The operators and technicians I talk to have no idea either and the research I do goes over my head.\n\nFYI: The motor list that I made consists of every motor's: Manufacturer / Voltage / Horsepower / RPM / Frame / Service Factor / Catalog Number / Ambient Temperature and Duty Rating / and Purpose if it was in use. (Some data plates were illegible or out of reach) I am also starting to worry that I missed a category of information critical to this task as I was not told the end goal of the list when I started out.\n\nIf anyone can help me in any way I would greatly appreciate it!",

His requirements are that it has to be wireless and he doesn't want an audible alarm when the gate opens. We both looked around online and it seems hard to find something that fits these requirements. If anyone knows something that would work, I'm sure he would be happy to just buy something.\n\nBut I'm curious how one would go about designing this system. As far as I can think, I would need proximity sensors, microcontrollers, and transmitters/receivers (all powered from AA/AAA batteries probably). So the microcontrollers would read the output of the proximity sensors, and when they cross a certain threshold, they would output some sort of pulse code, which would be fed into the transmitter. The receiver would demodulate this signal and a microcontroller would interpret the pulses and drive the LEDs (probably one for each gate).\n\nI've had a good bit of experience with MCUs in school so I should be able to figure that out. Where I'm lost is the communication protocol. What kind of transmitters/receivers would I need and how would I encode the messages? I came across Z\\-Wave when doing a little bit of research, is this a good protocol for an application like this?\n\nThis would be super easy for me if I could hardwire the system. I'm doing a co\\-op in radio broadcasting so wireless transmission isn't totally foreign to me but I know next to nothing about the digital/programming side of it.",

        "text": "Hello, I'm a 4th year Electrical/Computer Engineering double major with a high GPA(3.98/4.0), a decent GRE(157Q, 153V, 5.5/6.0 AWA), and I've come to enjoy all of my classes. I'll be applying to grad schools in a year and a half or so, and I was wondering how I should go about deciding on a specialization? I'm currently doing research in semiconductors and plan on contacting some professors next semester, so I can fit in some more research experience before grad school apps. My only problem is that I really have come to enjoy every single course that I've taken and have no idea what I would like to specialize in. Would you recommend applying to grad school in multiple sub\\-disciplines, or just picking one of the couple sub\\-disciplines that interest me, and get research experience in that? ",

        "text": "I'm starting a BS in [Electronic Systems Engineering Technology](https://www.tesu.edu/ast/programs/bs/electronics-systems-engineering-technology) in july. They've applied 74 credits from my previous associates and I have 51 to go. I am taking it so my current employer will move me to full time.\n\nI'm an associate professor for an AS degree, and teach the exact same materials using the same books and the same labs as the electronics courses I have yet to take. The school (TESU) accepts courses taught as credits so I'll be cutting that down slightly. \n\nLooking through the various degree evaluations, i found that I'm about 20 credits from a [Bachelor of Science in Technical Studies](https://www.tesu.edu/ast/programs/bs/technical-studies), with almost all of the remaining classes overlapping with the first degree.\n\nThis means one extra class and I technically qualify for a second bachelor's. \n\nIf I graduate from the second BS first, the school's policy means I can graduate from the original degree [so long as I take 24 credits after receiving my last degree.](https://blog.tesu.edu/the-secret-to-earning-a-second-degree) \n\nThe technical studies degree had more credits transfer because my original associates was in Agriculture and they considered the classes as technical/science. \n\n-------------\n\nI'm wondering how much it would help me out to have the two bachelor's. Not just for future jobs but also when applying for a graduate program (likely university at buffalo due to location but I'll be applying to all the top schools)\n\n\n\nI have 1 year into agriculture (expelled), an associate CS/EE degree (top of class), two 1-year certificates (tied for top), and 1.5 additional years of being a full-time student with no declared major. I'll be taking the FE in october at the earliest (if new york allows it, i haven't figured that out)\n\n\nThank you for any information or wisdom you're willing to give!",
