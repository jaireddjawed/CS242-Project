We were given the following constraints:\n\n* Deploy to a CentOS server (ohgodwhy)\n* Must use MySQL\n\nOther than the CentOS part, it doesn't seem to bad. And then we decided to use Python (specifically CherryPy after mod_python failed to work for us). Still not overly bad, just kinda annoying to work with. \n\nNow, I'm one of 2 people in the backend group that knows how to do anything in Linux other than \"ls\" and \"cd\", so I'm stuck with managing it all (pls send help, Redhat is awful). But wait, if no one else knows how to use Linux, how is the project getting done? If that's the question you're asking yourself, I'm asking myself that as well. Everyone had code in the repo, and it was running without catching on fire. I was honestly shocked.\n\nUntil today. I was informed that some unit tests weren't passing on the server. I take a look, and sure enough ~10 of the 20 tests are failing for our RESTful API calls with things from HTTP 500 to \"Connection Refused\". I spent a few minutes looking over the test cases and error logs. As it turns out, everyone had decided to use MySQLWorkbench and Notepad++ on Windows to write and test their SQL and Python, so everything was working locally when they committed. \n\nSo why was it broken? Fucking MySQL inherits the case sensitivity of the OS it's being ran on. There were ~800 lines of SQL code that didn't work because people used names like \"table_name\", \"Table_Name\", \"TABLE_NAME\" instead of \"Table_Name\". This was happening in the Unit Tests, and in the actual product. They just assumed that since MySQL is MySQL and Python is Python, it would work. It didn't, and then they asked me to fix it because \"you know what's wrong\". Fantastic.\n\nJust because something is cross platform doesn't mean you can just assume it's going to work. Test it. For the love of God test it.",

So, if there's a global variable, you can access it; if there's a global function, you can use it. Except the C99 standard doesn't let you assign a void* to a function pointer. \nSo the following (obvious) code doesn't work:\n    \n    int (*fp)(int);\n    fp = dlsym(handle, \"foo\");\n\nbecause you're assigning a void* to an int (*)(). The solution is one of the ugliest casts I've ever come across in serious code:\n\n    *(void **) (&amp;fp) = dlsym(handle, \"foo\");\n\n*WHY* did the C99 committee think it would be a good idea to prevent casting from void* to a function pointer? I get that it's unnecessary in modern languages, but casting to and from void* is the bread and butter of C's memory system. It should be understood that if you're writing casts in C, you know what you're doing! ",

This isn't too too much of a WTF in and of itself, although it's getting close. However, the following is:\n\nHe wants us to do a \"fat client model\". This means the client is connecting, over *plaintext*, directly with the database. For an assignment that's supposed to be something that would be used by clients of a company. \n\nAnd his response to me asking \"what about if someone just grabs the database credentials from the client and directly connects to the server\" was \"but it's Java - you're distributing the compiled files, not the source\". And then when I asked about wireshark / other network analyzers / jd-gui / other java decompilers, his response was \"but most users don't have the expertise to do that!\".\n\n*sigh*\n\n(Oh, and these are University students, who mostly have either already done co-op terms, or are going to be shortly.

In Perl, any attempt at boolean logic is guaranteed to cause you pain, because there's no such thing as a 'real' boolean.  The booleans they provide you with are either true, false, or undef.  In this case, the original programmer used 0 and 1 to approximate true or false, but the client winds up checking for undef / not undef.  Not undef (0 or 1) is considered success--though the process returns 1 for failure.\n\nThis results in the process failing, and then also failing to report failure.  As a result, the job is marked as a success... and we're left scratching our heads when a future dependent job fails miserably.",

The problem I am having is it's not setting the password correctly.  The user is created, just the password isn't set.  I know that $encpass has a value because I can display it.  I also know the command works because it runs fine in command line.  This was working before, but I had to reinstall Arch Linux, so does anyone have an idea for why this doesn't work?",

        "text": "The website I work on is a mess. It's run by an e-commerce platform on top of ASP.NET/C#. The old developer wasn't good. The whole thing is nested tables in nested tables, spaghetti everywhere, inline styles, just horrid work. \n\nAnyway, I'm editing some products today. [This is what](http://i.imgur.com/MtuPKwy.jpg) our product editor page looks like. As you can see, there's some standard fields like product name, weight, dimensions, description, etc. These all get compiled together by ASP.NET when the browser requests a page. In the final page, the product image goes on the left, price underneath, and the description on the right.\n\nCertain products have HTML in the \"More Details\" field. This displays below the product image but above the price. Today I was trying to add code to this field on some products that originally had nothing there, but it wouldn't show up. So I compare these products to pages that having known working \"More Details\" fields. Nothing. No differences. I don't understand. They're both generating the page the exact same way.\n\nSo I have to dig into this ugly source code to find out what's happening. Eventually, I stumble upon this:\n\n    #if($Product.Length.ToString() == \"2.2200\")\n        $Product.ExtendedDescription\n    #else\n        [[ConLib:ProductImage ShowImage=\"Image\"]]&lt;br /&gt;\n    #end\n\nNow, it took me a minute or two to figure out what exactly is going on here. \"More Details\" should be showing up in `$Product.ExtendedDescription`. But what is `$Product.Length`? The length of the product name? The length of the description? Nope. It's the *actual physical dimension* length. That's right. Products have to have a physical length of 2.22 inches for the extended description to show up. This is actual production code, people. This is on a website that pulls in hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Tens of thousands of hits per month. \n\nUnbelievable. \n\nedit: oh, and by the way, this code was in a `&lt;td&gt;` in a `&lt;tr&gt;` in a `&lt;table&gt;`, which itself was in a `&lt;td&gt;` in a `&lt;tr&gt;` in a `&lt;table&gt;`, which was in a `&lt;div&gt;` in a `&lt;div&gt;`, which was all in a **&lt;center&gt;** in a `&lt;div&gt;` in the main Ajax `&lt;form&gt;` of the `&lt;body&gt;` of the `&lt;html&gt;`.\n\nVisualization: \n\n    &lt;html&gt;\n        &lt;body&gt;\n            &lt;form&gt;\n                &lt;div&gt;\n                    &lt;center&gt;\n                        &lt;div&gt;\n                            &lt;div&gt;\n                                &lt;table&gt;\n                                    &lt;tr&gt;\n                                        &lt;td&gt;\n                                            &lt;table&gt;\n                                                &lt;tr&gt;\n                                                    &lt;td&gt;\n                                                        #if($Product.Length.ToString() == \"2.2200\")\n                                                            $Product.ExtendedDescription\n                                                        #else\n                                                            [[ConLib:ProductImage ShowImage=\"Image\"]]&lt;br /&gt;\n                                                        #end\n                                                    &lt;/td&gt;\n                                                &lt;/tr&gt;\n                                            &lt;/table&gt;\n                                        &lt;/td&gt;\n                                    &lt;/tr&gt;\n                                &lt;/table&gt;\n                            &lt;/div&gt;\n                        &lt;/div&gt;\n                    &lt;/center&gt;\n                &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/form&gt;\n        &lt;/body&gt;\n    &lt;/html&gt;\n",

        "text": "I work as the only web developer and designer doing front end, back end, and graphic design for a company that sells cables online. We use an e-commerce shopping cart framework that runs on ASP.NET/C#. There's a company that specializes in this software, and they offer many customizations and plugins for it. We often contract them for custom stuff since I'm usually busy with other things and I haven't worked with this framework or ASP.NET before, so I don't really have the time to go try to make sense of the framework's terrible doc. This company overcharges and usually has terrible to mediocre products. I'm sure you know the type. A little piece of their About Us page:\n\n&gt;[Company] has the largest, most experienced team of [Framework] developers and hosting experts anywhere in the world!\n\nOne of their plugins (a sidebar that dynamically displays a category tree based on what page you're on) was adding 30+ seconds to our page load time! I haven't looked at the code for this but I assume it's bad.\n\nAnyway, my company sells cables. So we wanted a utility that would take price per foot and weight per foot as inputs and generate a dropdown list of options for some of the products. My boss wanted it to generate from 10 to 100 meters by 5m increments, 100 to 500 by 10m, and from 500 to 5000 by 25m.\n\nYou can probably see where this is going. Here's a snippet of the code that this company sent us:\n\n    //==============10 Ft\n    OptionChoice opt = new OptionChoice();\n    opt.OptionId = option.OptionId;\n    opt.Name = \"10 Foot (3.04 Meters) + $\" + (AlwaysConvert.ToDecimal(AddOptionBasePrice.Text) * 10).ToString(\"n2\");\n    opt.ThumbnailUrl = string.Empty;\n    opt.ImageUrl = string.Empty;\n    opt.PriceModifier = (AlwaysConvert.ToDecimal(AddOptionBasePrice.Text) * 10);\n    opt.WeightModifier = (AlwaysConvert.ToDecimal(AddOptionWeight.Text) * 10);\n    opt.SkuModifier = \"10Ft\";\n    opt.OrderBy = -1;\n    opt.Save();\n\nThere's 300+ of these snippets. One for each individual length option. These snippets alone take up more than **3000 lines**. \n\nI quickly replaced it with this dirty 25 line loop:\n\n    double metersPerFoot = 0.3048;\n    int tick = 5;\n    OptionChoice opt = new OptionChoice();\n\n    for (int currentLength = 10; currentLength &lt;= 5000; currentLength += tick) {\n        opt = new OptionChoice();\n        opt.OptionId = option.OptionId;\n        opt.Name = string.Format(\"{0} Foot ({1} Meters) + ${2}\", currentLength, (currentLength * metersPerFoot).ToString(\"f2\"), ((currentLength - 10) * AlwaysConvert.ToDecimal(AddOptionBasePrice.Text)).ToString(\"n2\"));\n        opt.ThumbnailUrl = string.Empty;\n        opt.ImageUrl = string.Empty;\n        opt.PriceModifier = (currentLength - 10) * AlwaysConvert.ToDecimal(AddOptionBasePrice.Text);\n        opt.WeightModifier = (currentLength - 10) * AlwaysConvert.ToDecimal(AddOptionWeight.Text);\n        opt.SkuModifier = string.Format(\"-{0}\", currentLength);\n        opt.OrderBy = -1;\n        opt.Save();\n\n        if (currentLength &gt;= 100) {\n            tick = 10;\n        }\n        if (currentLength &gt;= 500) {\n            tick = 25;\n        }\n    }\n\n\nThankfully, after these couple debacles and getting fed up with their prices, my boss has been coming to me directly for these custom projects. It'll probably take me longer, but the code will be at least passable and maintainable. \n\nThanks for reading. Now, please take the next 5 minutes to critique my shoddy C# or contemplate how people like this have paying programming jobs while so many talented developers are just scraping by. ",

        "text": "Like the majority of work I do, this was a site written by a predecessor. Very good clients, but the code left a lot to be desired. They launched a new product a few months back that took their membership from 100 users to 100 new users *per day*. That's all well and good, but the code was falling apart along with their server. I managed to get them put onto a cloud hosting platform that can scale the resources with their load, but we still were experiencing odd network errors, timeouts, and error-messages-that-plain-should-not-be.\n\nI finally discovered the root cause of this when a user sent in an error message that basically meant \"The system automatically throttled your database connection because you exceeded the system limits\". Now, they're not on the top tier architecture but their current load shouldn't hit anywhere near that level. Shouldn't being the operative word.\n\nSo I start poking through the relevant code to find all the database calls and discover my predecessor's method of generating a unique user ID when a user registers: Generate a random number. Open a database connection and pass the number to a stored procedure that checks if it's unique. If the number isn't unique, GOTO 10 until it is.\n\nWhen the site only had ~100 users, this found a solution within a few dozen tries so no one noticed. Now that the user count is almost two orders of magnitude greater this loop is running longer, opening connections every time and not properly closing them. How much longer? A rough count from the debugging code I put in was 3000 times...\n\nper second...\n\nper user.\n\nAnd now that he decided to use this method instead of an autoincremented ID, I can't switch it back without a major rewrite and the client needed a solution ASAP. So I did the next best hack: move it all to the database. One call to a stored procedure that loops until it finds a unique number. Registration submissions went from 180+ seconds to &lt;1 second, and everyone is happy. For now...\n\nAnd that's one of the reasons I put in my two weeks today.\n\nEDIT: Apparently I need code, so here:\n\n    bool check = false;\n\n    while(check == false)\n    {\n        time.ToString(format);\n        username = time.ToString(format)+\"\"+RandomDigits(5);\n        check = Member.IsUniqueUsername(username);\n    }\n\n    ...\n\n    protected long RandomDigits(int number)\n    {\n        long randNum = 0;\n        Random random = new Random();\n        for (int i = 1; i &lt;= number; i++)\n        {\n            long t = 0;\n            if (i == 1)\n                t = random.Next(1, number);\n            else\n                t = random.Next(0,number);\n            randNum = randNum * 10 + t;\n        }   \n        return randNum; \n    }\n\n    ....\n\n    public static bool IsUniqueUsername(string email)\n    {\n        Database db = DatabaseFactory.CreateDatabase();\n        DbCommand dbCommand = db.GetStoredProcCommand(\"CRM_Members_IsUniqueUsername\", email);\n        return bool.Parse(db.ExecuteScalar(dbCommand).ToString());\n    }",

        "text": "A little backstory: At my previous job, I had the role of Software Analyst, which the company translated freely as \"Doing both Programming and IT Support\". It was at a manufacturing plant for a Large Healthcare Company and my charge was to program and maintain systems for their special, proprietary system that I'm going to call **HOMPS** (Which, in this case, would stand for Healthcare Outcome-Management Process System.) HOMPS is a unique \"cookbook\" program that sent instructions down the line for medical goods to make sure the FDA can properly track what we're doing on each product. It was developed by a conglomeration of several major corporations and then quickly abandoned by all but one when they realized how terrible of a solution it was. The program left a lot to be desired. It relied on the Windows system time to be in a certain date format, the DB2 database was atrocious (On a good day, it was about 12-16 GBs, with 90% of it being unused data), and there was lots of legacy spaghetti code that would make a programmer's mother cry, then make the programmer cry and for some reason the programmer's mother would cry again without being called.\n\nIt didn't help it used its own proprietary language within it (\"HOMPS Action Script\"), which is basically VB6's brain-deficient cousin. There's no supports for arrays in it. Let that sink in.\n\nI have lots of stories from this place, but I'm going to start with a this one. Apologies for the lack of code in this one, but it'll give you a good idea for the mindset of this product:\n\nEvery product batch has a unique name associated with it, taken from various sources. It's usually the plant location (Two Letters) + Millennial Digit of the Year (2) + Last Two Digits of the Year + Number of Days Since the First of the Year + 2 numbers for the batches. So, something like KX21312201. Kind of weird, but its works. Okay, fine. Whatever. The problem occurs when you go beyond 100 batches in a single area. Since this string was hardcoded to my knowledge, the inclusion of a third digit caused major errors to happen in the HOMPS batch. The other areas of the plant never approached that number of batches in a day, but the new one I was in charge of setting up with HOMPS would. Fortunately, we had one of the original programmers of HOMPS on staff in our plant. I figured I would ask him to see if we had this situation in other plants. No prob! I had figured we would be able to either extend the string for our purposes or be able to use a hexadecimal or something on batch creation and have the issue solved quickly.\n\nWell, he had a solution, but it was not at *all* what I expected. Unbeknownst to me in the table-laden system, there was a special table called HOMPS_PROD_SEQ. There was zero official documentation that I could find on it, but it was well known among the HOMPS Inner Group. Inside this table was two columns that look a little something like this:\n\n    SEQ_CURR   SEQ_NEXT\n    0           1   \n    1           2   \n    2           3   \n    3           4   \n    4           5   \n    5           6   \n    6           7   \n    7           8   \n    8           9   \n    9           0   \n\n\nYou may have already figured it out, but this table is used to check the last two numbers of the Product Batch String and determine what number to go to next. None of that incremental programmatic crap, suckas! Let's just do a lot of database calls instead! The original programmer looked *so* pleased as he showed me this code, as well as the text file that I should refer to when updating this table:\n    \n    \"0\",\"1\",\n    \"1\",\"2\",\n    \"2\",\"3\",\n    \"3\",\"4\",\n    \"4\",\"5\",\n    \"5\",\"6\",\n    \"6\",\"7\",\n    \"7\",\"8\",\n    \"8\",\"9\",\n    \"9\",\"A\",\n    \"A\",\"B\",\n    \"B\",\"C\",\n    \"C\",\"D\",\n    \"D\",\"E\",\n    \"E\",\"F\",\n    \"F\",\"G\",\n    \"G\",\"H\",\n    \"H\",\"I\",\n    \"I\",\"J\",\n    \"J\",\"K\",\n    \"K\",\"L\",\n    \"L\",\"M\",\n    \"M\",\"N\",\n    \"N\",\"O\",\n    \"O\",\"P\",\n    \"P\",\"Q\",\n    \"Q\",\"R\",\n    \"R\",\"S\",\n    \"S\",\"T\",\n    \"T\",\"U\",\n    \"U\",\"V\",\n    \"V\",\"W\",\n    \"W\",\"X\",\n    \"X\",\"Y\",\n    \"Y\",\"Z\",\n    \"Z\",\"0\"\n\nBonus Note: If I recall correctly,this checks *both* numbers at the end of the product batch string one at a time, so it has to make at least two database calls to get the next sequential batch number. \n    \nBy this point, I had already learned my lesson for trying to reinvent the corporate wheel (That's another story), so I just implemented this solution. It *did* work, though the urge to make the batches increment by order of \"F U C K H O M P S\" was incredible.\n\nThis one is relatively tame for the system. I have a lot more where that came from.",

        "text": "When I was speaking with my Programming Languages professor a few days ago, he mentioned that there was an analogue to the goto statement, called \"comefrom\". What it does, if you're not familiar, is it rips program flow *from* the indicated line and brings it to the position of the comefrom statement. Thus:\n\n    1 x = 5\n    2 \n    3 x = 7\n    4 \n    5 comefrom 2\n    6 \n    7 //END; x now is equal to five\n\nObviously this is terrible, terrible practice, and few languages implement it. It gets even worse when you can have *dynamic* comefroms -- comefrom statements where the line number (or label, I guess) may be expressed as a variable or variable expression.\n\nI thought that was the worst control-breaking statement possible. Until today, when someone in my study group posited a \"gofrom\" statement, that takes two operands: one source, and one destination:\n\n    1 x = 5\n    2 \n    3 x = 7\n    4 \n    5 gofrom 2 6\n    6\n    7 //END; x is now equal to five\n\nIt is now my life's goal to create a language where this is the only program flow control statement.",

The output, a comma separated String, is used to fill a textbox in a form.\n\n\nThe String looks like this (numbers are zeroed and address/name are faked by me for anonymizing)\nBLZ: 0000000, KtoNr: 0000000, BIC: 0000000, IBAN: 0000000, Land: XX, The bank name, XX-0000 MyCity, Somestreet 8\n\n\nThen at some other place of the application, the value of the textbox is used as input. However they only wanted to have the bank name and city. So they split up the string by ',' and guess the position of the wanted value. Notice that not all of the values are always there and so the positions my change. \nSo they cut out all values having a title i.e. 'IBAN:', so this remains:\n\nThe bank name, XX-0000 MyCity, Somestreet 8\n\nNow the name always had the first index in the split and the City the second.\n\n\nHowever some one added the persons name owning the bank account to the string:\n\nBLZ: 0000000, KtoNr: 0000000, BIC: 0000000, IBAN: 0000000, John,Doe, Land: XX, The bank name, XX-0000 MyCity, Somestreet 8\n\n\nResulting in:\n\nJohn,Doe, The bank name, XX-0000 MyCity, Somestreet 8\n\nThus the first index now holds the Firstname, not the bank name.\nAs said its however not guaranteed that all values are always there, thus now the bankname could be the first or the second index.\n\n\nIn other words they are fucked now and suffer from the epic miss decision using this Display string for further processing instead of working with the Bank class holding each value in a separate variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
