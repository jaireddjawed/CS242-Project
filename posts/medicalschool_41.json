        "text": "I know this is probably something I shouldn't be doing, but as an IM applicant, US-MD, I feel like I'm limited bc I can't choose certain places due to lack of resident subsidizied housing or even affordable housing options (shoutout to Manhattan). I have time obviously, but my best program is not going to be on the top bc I haven't found anything reliably affordable near said site. I really don't want to commute from NJ to NYC for residency if this ends up happening. But when I talked about it with my friends, it was of no concern. Some people say \"you'll make it work\" but I had a semi-panic attack looking up a studio, or even dividing the rent up among 3-4 roommates. I know private relocation loans can help, but as a person who went to a low tier US MD that happens to have the most expensive tuition, I really want to avoid loans in residency. \n\nFor context, I took out full loans for medical school. My family is not from money, and they can't afford to help out, nor would I ever ask them. I'm borrowing my sister's car right now because I have no money to even put a down payment for a car. I do not have a spouse that works full-time, I am dating, but we're at different points in our lives. I'm more than okay with roommates. \n\nAm I taking the wrong approach? Come March 17th, if I find myself going to a place I'd be happy at, but living paycheck to paycheck or even not be able to afford housing, all because I didn't factor COL ,what do I do?",

The scenario has already played out, so to speak. However, I am looking for opinions or if anybody might recommend a couple of well-sourced/cited medical articles regarding what I am about to ask. \n\nI’m a finally yr med student currently studying in South Africa, for reference. About 1 week ago, I was suturing up a patient who presented to the ER with lacerations to the face and his right thumb after an altercation with a man in a bar. \n\nSutured the lacerations on the face with no problems, got to the thumb  and had just begun anaesthetising the site when he suddenly whipped his hand back (he was also laughing, I assume he was probably drunk and perhaps the pain was more than he expected despite my warning to him that I was beginning there ) and of course, as luck would have it he bumped my hand holding the lignocaine needle (same as dental syringe needle) right into the thumb on my other hand. \n\nFollowed protocol, immediately removed gloves, encouraged the wound to bleed, washed with soap and water right away for 10-15 min, and took TLD right away as I have an emergency stash on me at all times. \n\nDid a rapid test and he was negative. Ordered a full hepatitis screen, HIV ELISA and HIV VL. Results came back maybe within the next four days and the patient was negative for everything. VL below detectable limit. I saw a GP in between all this and she advised I still continue a full course of PEP despite the negative results. \n\nBeen having terrible side effects that won’t abate. Nausea dizziness weakness fatigue headache. Struggling to work and study. Anybody know of any reputable articles I could read regarding the risk of transmission in a case such as mine? Seriously considering stopping the PEP. \n\nThanks in advance\nEdit: VL below detectable limit",

        "text": "I'm a USIMG who had to remediate 3 classes, with no US clinical or research experience, struggling to even pass NBMEs (failed twice already) and I will be graduating and getting my MD degree in about 7 months. \n\nWhat is this shit show you might ask, what am I even doing?\n\nLong story short, I have absolutely no interest in anything healthcare related.\n\nI don't care about how the human body works in an intricate level, I don't care what enzymes are at play when I eat certain foods, I don't care how drugs work, and I definitely do not care about any other weird random details of ion channel of random molecular toenail proteins. \n\nEverything I studied in school was the complete opposite of fascination for me. \n\nI was shoved into med school by my parents when I was 18 years old and I was afraid of the consequences (getting kicked out of the family) if I refuse to comply. \n\nThrough generational trauma I was raised to believe that I don't have what it takes to survive without the support of my family, and that the only way to garner respect in society and not starve to death is to work in the healthcare field. \n\nPlus all the homeless people on the street are homeless because \"their parents told them to follow their dreams.\" Not even kidding, this is how I was raised.\n\nNow that I am much older I am starting to realize that\n\n1) I would've been able to survive on my own. \n\n2) My dad's ego is insane. I'm basically being treated as hit flex baby and his values and worldviews are absolutely twisted.\n\n3) What a massive mistake of a life choice I've made. But I'm ready to take all the responsibility anyways and make it work.\n\nNeither my dad nor I have done the proper research of the process of becoming a doctor, and said yes to this \"golden opportunity of a lifetime overseas\" by some agency recruiting for students.\n\nI am 100% certain that even if I get Stockholm syndrome and suddenly want to become a doctor, I would never match anywhere for years and years.\n\n  \nI just want to know that I can't be the only one going through something like this right?\n\nAre there people out there who are in this boat of \"having an MD degree but 0 chance of working as a physician\" either because of lack of CV, or passion in general.\n\nI am absolutely sick of anything medicine related at this point and am conflicted on whether I should still leverage my degree to get a somewhat medicine related job? (Is this even possible? It sure feels like the degree isn't even worth being printed on the papers to me)\n\nOr ditch it completely and pretend that I never even went to med school.\n\nI want to know the onions and the thoughts of other less competitive candidates about what plan Bs they have.\n\nFor example if you just can't match now no matter what you do, would you spend years and years to try to pad your CV in paid research positions and paid clinical experiences and paid interview trainings etc and do whatever it takes to become a doctor. \n\nOr would you be okay with saying \"fuck it\" to the whole match and residency process, and just leverage your degree and get a job to pay back your loans.\n\nWhat's keeping you up at night? \n\nWhat are you most afraid of when you're in this kind of situation?\n\nWhat are you angry about? Who are you angry at?\n\nWhat are some daily frustrations you have?\n\nWhat do you secretly desire the most? ie never have started this journey? Or going into different fields?\n\nAre you tired of everyone trying to get money from you every single step of the way before you even start making money, and getting you deeper and deeper into debt? \n\nThe never ending brown nosing?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt would be interesting for me to see some answers to these questions, and if you want to engage with the post and not have your username displayed my DM's are open.",

        "text": "Hey guys, current MD2 in Australia here. Since start of undergrad, I have fallen in the bad habit of cramming and figured seeing as it worked in undergrad and allowed me to get in postgrad med, I kept doing it even now that I am halfway through medicine. Unlike the states, we don’t have any board exams to pass or have to have the highest GPA in medical school to get into any specialty (rather it’s about publication etc) so have been averaging Credit in med so far. Just wondering if there are others here who crammed during exam season and still ended up doing well in clinical years/being a decent doctor. Whilst it’s not an excuse, the main reason for cramming is a combo of being from low socioeconomic background meaning I do have to work two part time jobs to sustain myself as well as being the child of immigrant parents, my family does heavily rely on me for things like translation and navigating life in a foreign country. However I do feel guilty for cramming and sometimes it does make me worried about the future and just wanted to hear about other people’s experiences! Thanks fam 💕",

I just wasn't quite satisfied with the previous discussions if that makes sense.",

        "text": "I am mid way through my third year clinical rotations of med school. As I'm completing my surgery rotation, nearly every single doctor commented that I should go into surgery because I'm smart. I love being in the OR, however I hate standing for a long time (maybe I just hate standing there and not actually doing things? I don't really feel tired when I'm suturing). Plus I would love to have a decent lifestyle. I have a trust fund so income is not a vital factor here, but nobody says no to higher salary. I like solving difficult problems and mastering challenging tasks. With that being said, should I go into surgery even though the next five years of my life will possibly be tired af? Or should I pursue another specialty that's relatively intellectually challenging with a more reasonable lifestyle (if you know such specialty please recommend).\n1\niT",

Do both have options focusing on medicine vs surgery, and if so, which is best for applying anesthesiology? Would doing either extend residency by a year, or would it apply for pgy1 year of anesthesia? \n\n\nAncillary questions / background info that may help with advising:\n\n- delayed graduation may be the best move for some, but is that still true if the school doesn't have an anesthesiology program (nor the preferred surgical sub)? Can that be decided after attempting to soap? \n\n- graduate research year: would it help anesthesiology chances?

I recognize this is highly applicant dependent, I managed 10 interviews without a home program so I'm hoping it's networking that is holding me back)\n\n\nThanks for the help, my school hasn't given much guidance about SOAPing and I need an action plan to be in place.",
