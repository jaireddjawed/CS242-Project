I was outta town for work and didn’t hit up some friends that lived there because of how busy I was. This led them to call me fake among other things and one of them posted a convo on IG clearly talking about me stating that I’m “social awkward” “don’t have social skills” “I bet he got bullied in high school”. Seeing this really triggered me and I’m still shaking and super anxious thinking about it but doing my best not to address it to avoid an argument. How would you guys handle this? Man I wish I could just not give a fuck and not let words affect me the way they do sometimes.",

        "text": "I'm in the 3rd year of university with a music major (in Germany) and I just can't take it anymore. Now I may not be the most extraverted person out there, but I usually feel pretty comfortable creating bonds with people. Not so in this city. I don't know how to describe it. There doesn't seem to be any sense of community or interest in others, everyone is guarding themselves from influence of others, it seems like friendships are a commodity to feel value over others. Any achievements and/or skills (and as I'm in a music major, this seems like all that matters) seem to be a goal just to pride oneself with them. And I'm only studying to become a music teacher, not a musician, so that shouldn't even matter.\n\nI can't seem to be able to make any genuine connections that aren't super shallow, and honestly studying here is pretty depressing. Yeah, the education is amazing and free (as we're in germany), but that doesn't really help if you're too socially starved and depressed to make any use of it. And it's a thing in university - where seemingly everyone tries to have a competetive stance towards you - and in everyday life, where people seem to be fond of pointing out every smallest weakness or flaw you show. I don't know when the last time was I was actually able to live without inhibitions and feel free. And last year I started to have severe performance anxiety with trembles etc., that pretty much rendered me incapable now to play in front of people, so I don't even know how to continue studying. Maybe switch majors to singing, where that's less of an issue…\n\nWe're having a choir consisting and managed by students. But that one seems to be like a tool for the choir \"leaders\" (that were voted for at the beginning) to feel empowered. The atmosphere within it is just the culmination of negativeness; there doesn't seem to be an end to the things that draw critique of others - critique that often isn't even justified, but rather just something pointed out to point something out, making sure nobody is \"too perfect\".\n\nI know some of people that have changed university (because of that? I'm not sure), I know others that absolutely love being here. I think I'm overprojecting on a lot of things, maybe because I see (or have been taught to see?) everything in a negative light myself. Should I change universities and cities myself? I've contemplated last year, but blamed the lack of social connection on corona. It's really gotten only worse in my eyes. Has anyone else experienced anything similar? I might just be picking out the raisins, that vocal minority clinging to every and anyone to raise their self worth. Maybe there's a closed door behind everyone loses all their stuck-upness and I have just somehow missed the invitation. I'm not sure. Thanks for reading. And sorry for rambling.",

        "text": "God knows how I did it, but for the first time in my life I'm well liked by pretty much everyone in my high school. I've made a bunch of new close friends, some casual ones, and a bunch of people who just genuinely like me? And before this, I had maybe one or two friends at a time, and I was a bit of an outcast. I'm just so happy to be liked. (Yes, I'm boasting. I feel really good about it lol.)\n\nAnyway, onto the Human Code. I'm gonna share some things which I discovered which will hopefully help at least one of you guys. \n\n\\- Be genuinely enthused about things you like. I hid my interests and was just a pessimist about a lot of stuff. You have to be so into your interests that nobody will talk them down. And often you'll find that people respond to this and share your interests.\n\n\\- Similarly, don't talk down other peoples' interests. It's okay not to like something. Don't make another person feel bad about liking it themselves though.\n\n\\- Have one of these things - good grades, good looks or be on a sports team. Not everyone has one of these, necessarily, but good grades means that people approach you, good looks means a similar thing, doing sports exposes you to new people. \n\n\\- Talk to ANYONE you sit near. They usually engage. I've made a bunch of friends that way.\n\n\\- Be funny! You don't need to be a naturally hilarious person. I'm not. But I can be sarcastic, I know a bunch of jokes, and I love to start silly conversations which make people laugh. Work out your Humour Strengths and play to them. Everyone has some. You got this.\n\n\\- Make your weaknesses a part of you. I don't mean that lightly. If you are stupid, make jokes about your stupidity. If you stutter, make jokes about how you cannot for the life of you speak like a normal person (it's me, I stutter.) And yes, this ties back to humour, but you can do it sincerely as well. Just accept your own flaws and others will too.\n\n\\- And finally, you have to talk to people. I actually am still pretty goddamn awful at this, because what if they don't want to talk to me? I don't want to impose on them. It's horrible and scary to talk to new people - or even people who aren't close friends - but it's doable.\n\nIf you got this far, thanks for reading. I hope some of my tips are of use to you. If so or if not, have an excellent day and I wish you well!",

It was nice to feel like I \"belong\" until things took a turn for  the worst. \n\nLemme first give you a lil back story about myself. So, All throughout Middle school I was pretty much friendless to the point I was ostracised 'even by teachers'. Then came high school were things got better. I was able to make some friends but unfortunately none of the friendships blossomed into adulthood. \n\n(Back to the story) The following year after I met them. I began to notice how they all changed around me. They consistently 'avoided' me, never hugged me but hugged each other in front of me and how they gossiped about others. I later found out that they spoke ill behind my back, were not my friends at all and were just using me. One of them managed to make new friends and spread lies and rumours about me to the point I wasn't able to make new friends. So I swore off friendships since then(I could go on and on about this)but that's a story for another day. \n\n(Back to the present). After graduation. I recently found out that they began using the group chat. Especially after some of 'us' left the chat. \n\nThey post chats about how they've been having good times together, they plan events and birthdays there. Fully aware am still in the group and pretty much act like I am not there. (I know it's on purpose cause they could've just created a new group chat or something). But I've been feeling out of place there and have been debating on if I should just leave the group chat as well. \n\nI don't know what to do in this situation. \nHave you experienced this as well, how did you deal with this? \nAny advice?",

Most of the time, I have to tell them to repeat what they said. I don't like this. To be honest, it makes/made things awkward.\n\nI remember one time I was passing on the street and one of my friends called me, I didn't hear him call me but after a few days passed we met each other and he told me about this and said he didn't like it when I ignored him then I had to explain that I can't hear properly.\n\nSomething worse than this happened, too. One time, I was walking, and then I saw someone in the distance who was waving at me and saying something to me with a laugh. I thought he was saying something nice so I waved and smiled. then my friend who was with me told me: \"Hey, what the hell? He was cursing, and you smiled?!\" Then I was like \" =o... \"\n\nHell, even d*ting girls have become a problem for me because I can't hear well, so things get awkward.

It sucks because I look on social media and see all these people in groups doing fun things together and I desperately want to be a part of something like that.\n\nI feel like part of the problem is that I go to a small college in the middle of nowhere where there is nothing to do nearby. On top of that, I commute from home so I don’t spend a lot of time on campus. I also don’t qualify for work study or participate in any sports or clubs.\n\nI feel like everyone already has their established friend groups and that I would be an unwelcome addition. I’m always worried to ask someone to hang out or give me their info because it feels like I’m just annoying them, and they don’t want any more friends. I know it’s irrational and I’m sure other people feel this way, but I feel like everyone has a good group of friends on campus except me. I’m so tired of walking out of class alone to eat lunch alone and then study alone. How can I fix this so I don’t end up graduating having made no good friends?",

        "text": "This is my first post so hello.\n\nI've been stuck in my own thoughts lately on account of quarantine and everything else that's been going on lately, and it's forced to to over analyze almost every aspect of my life. Although I don't have a bad life by any means, I feel that I'm lacking in different aspects of my life. One of those aspects being that I don't have any friends and I think I've never really had real friends.\n\nI'm not saying this as in people just don't like me for some reason. For context (if it matters), I'm now a 25 y.o., single, grad student. Growing up, I've dealt with my own insecurities and as a result, I often pretended to be someone I wasn't. So in high school, at work, or at any social gathering, I've always been a version of myself that I thought people would like, and that version would often change depending on the group I was around. Looking back on it now, I guess I would've considered myself a \"floater\" where I moved around different friend groups in order to \"make as many friends as possible\".\n\nAs a got older, of course, I grew out of this way of socializing. I still deal with my own insecurities but now I realize that I don't have to compromise myself to get people to like me. However, now I realize that since I haven't been authentic to the people I've ever considered my friends, people often times forget about me? Like friend groups that I used to be in still connect with one another but often times don't invite me unless its a big social gathering (like a birthday party).\n\nThe fact that I don't have any real friends itself isn't what's bothering me though. I grew to be introverted and enjoy my time by myself most days (plus I have sisters and I'm close to my parents). But I do feel tho that I messed up creating genuine connections with other people. I do go out with acquaintances , but I can't think of anyone outside my family that I feel comfortable hitting up whenever or when I need someone to talk to.\n\nNow that I'm more comfortable with myself, I want actually try to make real friends that share my interest and what not, but not I feel like its too late. Well, I know it hard now because of corona, but even before the pandemic I really didn't know how to meet people that I'm not in undergrad, I work, and people are getting married and starting families.\n\nMy question is how do people in the mid to late twenties make new friends (if they do at all?) My grad cohort is small so I've meet most of the people in it and I work. I want to become part of local groups but I don't know to get connected. IDK, I feel that everyone my age already has their set friend groups.\n\nTL;DR: 25 y.o has no friends and I feel like its too late to make friends. Sorry for typos, I don't feel like proofreading.\n\n\\----------------------\n\nEdit: Hello again. Just wanted to thank everyone who shared advice and their experiences. I didn't think I the post would get as many responses as it did. I'm reading all the feedback and replying when I can. Just wanted to let you all know that I appreciate the support!",

        "text": "There's something I like to call a \"forced introvert\" For someone like me, I realise that I have extrovert tendencies but my upbringing kind of paralysed all those traits. Growing up, I had a family where we don't share emotions, my birthdays were never celebrated no one cared much to ask about my feelings and all.So I grew up never knowing how to really bond with people and sometimes scared too. Although I realise that I like these things, it's just how I grew up and over time I've learnt to shut down my desire to connect and unlearning it now feels so mechanic and stressful that I would rather choose to remain as an introvert even though I still know innately there's a big extrovert buried beneath. Even the thought of changing it stresses me. Sad thing is that it has affected how I contribute at work and other places. Since I 've never enjoyed any attention growing up, I kind of hate it when people pay me attention or having anything that will draw it to me. Sometimes I purposely play dumb in gatherings just so that I don't answer questions and get attention drawn to me. I know this is bad but I don't know how to change it. I feel those of us that suffer from social anxiety need to change how we perceive attention but I don't know-how.I am totally receptive of others showing emotions and expressing themselves and I recognise the need. but when it comes to me, I feel everything is a \"show off\" and it's bad to show off.\n\nEdited:\n\nJust to add. As a kid, I remember being so friendly that I would visit all of my friends' houses. I was like the uniting friend that brought everyone to my place but as I grew older relationship at home got so harsh. And I started shutting down my friendly nature. Now, I can go years in solitude without feeling bored, funny I once considered being a monk, just so I could live with nature in solitude. Even though i am easily liked by people I find my self shutting them out quickly, I've ruined many great potential relationships because I shut them out. The extrovert nature is still there but I feel like \"why bother,\" I'm almost 30. I just feel it's sad to never have really connected with anyone because no one felt it was important and I mistakenly mirrored the relationship at home to outsiders. Some of my friends will describe me as loud and crazy because of how i come off as extrovertish around them but after that, I crawl back into my wall.I just realize that i am an expressive person who didn't find anyone to share it with at home and gradually it became a habit that I've come to forcefully accept. I remember trying to hug my mums once and she pushed me away. That haunted me. I could've been a really good hugger and cuddler.\n\nEnds rant.",

Everything was going smoothly but since I was wearing a headphones which was blocking my ears I was not able to figure out how loud I was speaking. Then people started interrupting saying I wasn’t loud enough and they weren’t able to hear me. I did my best to raise my voice but still I could see one of my friends telling me to raise my voice in the back. On top of that, while showing a demo we started getting errors in many place and our app started running slow out of nowhere. Anyways, presentation was done no one said anything bad about it but it’s already been more than a day and I still can’t get this embarrassing moment out of my mind. I can’t stop thinking about how people will see me as a loser who can’t do anything. I have been crying and shaking at home feeling ashamed to go back to the office. What do I do?

That’s just what they are, opinions. There’s no wrong or right, it’s all subjective so why get so heated? I can understand discussion but to get in literal heated arguments over stuff that’s simply a matter of opinion with no wrong or right seems ridiculous to me. \n\nOpinions can neither be right or wrong, art and media is incredibly subjective so what is the point of arguing these things?",

Not a bad thing to have some easy wins under my belt.\n\n# Experience:\n\nFortunately, during my shopping I actually didn’t know where the beansprouts were (and also what they looked like) so I just asked a woman who was shopping next to me where they were/what they look like. She pointed me in the right direction + gave me a quick description. I thanked her and smiled.

I wouldn't go to parties, I would only have a couple of friends and I would stay at home most of the time. It's not a bad thing, I guess, but personally I've only lived to regret it. I should have said 'yes' to so much more while I still had a chance when I was younger and when I still had 'communities' to be in. Because it's so much easier to meet new people while you are still a kid or a teenager. Because I didn't say 'yes' to more, I never learned to properly socialise, I've never built a strong social circle, never learned to be confident, to be myself, to love myself. I've never made many memories to build my personality on. To be fair, it honestly feels like I have no past and thus no present or future. I might as well not exist and nothing would change to those around me. \n\nPeople say 'go out and meet people', but I don't know how. Never learned to, as I said. I don't know how to talk, how to be interesting. It's not like I don't have hobbies or things that I am passionate about, but I honestly just don't know how to relate to other people. I don't know how to talk to people my age. How to go past the most basic tier of exchanging a few sentences at work. I did also try hitting up old friends and offering to hang out. We do sometimes, but it's always very one-sided. If I am not the one to initiate the conversation or reach out, they never will. And I don't blame them. They have their own lives which they are involved in and I am happy for them. I would like to have that too, but I don't and I don't know if I ever will. I'm honestly just tired of this.",

        "text": "I never made any close friends when I was younger. I moved a lot, and switched schools all the time. My parents are also introverts, and I’ve never been into sports or anything, so that hasn’t helped. \n\nIt’s all been a perfect storm that has led me to have no idea how to act around strangers or in new places, because while I move frequently (just last year I moved two states over), all the new places I’m forced to live in just cause me to want to stay in my home, where I have some sense of familiarity, rather than go out into the unfamiliar rest of the world.\n\nNow I’m nearly done high school, at a tiny school where my options of friends are minuscule to begin with. When we do have social events, I’m too afraid to go because I have no idea what will happen, and doubt anyone will speak with me. Even if they do speak with me, I won’t know how to hold a conversation. It’s not that people dislike me (I think), but they are indifferent to me.\n\nI don’t share many similarities with these people, so part of me wonders if it would have been better to go to the other school in town. It’s a different culture there.\n\nBottom line is, I could blame this on my parents, who now can’t understand for the life of them why I don’t hang out with people, or I could blame it on my upbringing in general, but regardless, I have to fix it. I just don’t even know where to begin.",

I know some people on a first name basis from some of my classes, but I haven't made any friends yet.\n\nOne thing I wanted to try was just to invite a bunch of people I somewhat know to an event. I was thinking of adding a bunch of people to a group chat and asking if people would be up for bowling next week X day? Would that be weird? I don't really know if people do bowling, but I couldn't really think of a better activity, and theres usually bars at bowling alleys if people would want to do that? Would a different activity be people or would that be fine. I looked a bit and it seems most bowling alleys would be fine accommodating 6 people just showing up. I'm an international student so I was also thinking maybe it would be funny in the post go - Yo, would any of you guys be up for bowling next Thursday at 6pm? Thats somethings Americans do, right??\"\n\nTl;dr - Would it be fine to create a group chat and invite like 6 guys I kinda and say something like: \"Yo, would any of you guys be up for bowling next Thursday at 6pm?\" - I would appreciate any advice / suggestions.",

        "text": "\n\n\n\nI think there's a common sentiment of not taking incidents or comments as personal attacks, and if those comments are actually meant to be offensive, you should let go of the feelings and 'forgive' them or accept it with humor.\n\nBut at the same time, things people say about you or how they treat you can be an indicator of your personal flaws or failings. It might be hurtful to grasp but it doesn't mean that it's necessarily untrue.\n\nFor example, if people constantly talk over you in conversations or don't take you seriously or talk shit about you in front of you or when people are constantly trying to 'teach' you things well you damn well understood it already, it could be an indicator that others don't think you are worthy of respect, either because of the way you put yourself or accomplishments just aren't worthy.\n\nIf you take it personally, at least you'll have fuel to improve yourself in many aspects of life, such as going to the gym, being more disciplined, being more social and assertive, so that the people who gave you hard time can't really bring you down like they use to because they don't really have the ammo.\n\nThe only problem is remembering and keeping all the things that are directed to you, bearing that weight alone, while at the same time not try to explode that on anybody all at once, but instead slowly releasing them as strong fuel for your goals. But holding to this stress is about the resiliency of the person more than anything.\n\nI feel like the common sentiment of 'taking it easy' or 'forgiving' makes you more content with your flawed self and subservient of the people who wronged you. It's not like you can have the power to 'forgive' them in the first place at the level you're at.\n\nBut at the same time, holding on to the resentment, and keeping tabs on your wins and losses along the way to your goal can be quite exhausting. Maybe this is just normal for everybody? and I'm just whining about it",

I had an appointment scheduled for 11am and the woman providing the service did not show up until 11:30am. The person at the front desk apologized on her behalf and I politely thanked her. What annoyed me the most was the servicer never apologized. I wanted to bring it up during the appointment but I didn’t know how. \n\n2. After my appointment, I went to the garage to get my car and felt the attendant was rude. One attendant got the car for the woman in front of me and put it in park right at the garage exit. He smiled at her while handing her keys in her hand. The other attendant brought my car and put it in park in the middle of the entrance/exit and just walked off. I had to reverse my car to properly exit out the garage. I thought of going up to him and saying something but I felt like he wouldn’t have cared. I was polite and friendly dropping off and requesting my vehicle.\n\n3. Back to back aggressive drivers today. I live near a major city and I am pretty used to aggressive driving but I guess today I got in my feelings. I was driving on a main road and a possibly homeless person in a wheelchair was in my lane. I had to slow down and the driver behind me laid on their horn and cut me off right after. Then about an hour later I drove through a residential area going a bit above the speed limit and someone else cuts me off almost hitting my car. I usually don’t mind aggressive drivers but I guess today it got to me.\n\n4. Two people who I thought I was on good terms with ignored my texts this week.
