        "text": "Researchers have made a exciting new discovery in nerve cells - the multivesicular transducosome (MT). This previously unseen organelle has been found to carry the retinitis pigmentosa 2 (RP2) protein, which is known to regulate transduction in the eye’s photoreceptor cells. Mutations in the RP2 gene can cause a variant of the eye disease retinitis pigmentosa.\n\nThe discovery of the MT opens up new avenues for research into the role of the organelle and RP2 in the functioning of nerve cells. A question for further investigation is whether the MT is present in brain neurons that are activated by neurotransmitters and not light and smell. If so, this discovery could have far-reaching implications for our understanding of vision and the role of RP2 in the brain.\n\nDo you think this discovery will lead to new treatments for retinitis pigmentosa and other vision disorders? Let's discuss in the comments!\n\nhttps://scitechdaily.com/researchers-discover-a-previously-unknown-cellular-component-inside-neurons-that-we-use-to-perceive-smell/",

        "text": "[A]I wrote a paper just now that I’d like to share \n\nThe Self-Correcting Nature of Life and the Universe\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe idea that both human life and the universe are self-correcting and seek to sustain themselves is a fascinating concept that can be approached from a biological perspective. In this landing page, we will explore the mechanisms and processes that enable life and support its continuation, both at the level of individual organisms and at the level of the universe as a whole.\n\nHuman Life:\n\nThe human body is a complex system comprised of various anatomical units, all working together to maintain health and support life. From the cells that make up our tissues to the organs that perform specific functions, the human body is constantly self-correcting and seeking to sustain itself. When something goes wrong, the body activates its defense mechanisms to restore balance and prevent further harm.\n\nThe Universe:\n\nSimilarly, the universe is a vast and complex system that operates according to physical laws and processes. From the formation of stars and planets to the evolution of life on Earth, the universe can be seen as self-correcting and seeking to sustain itself. For example, the energy from the sun drives the planet's climate and weather patterns, helping to maintain conditions that support life.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe concept of the self-correcting nature of life and the universe is a powerful one that speaks to the interconnectedness and interdependence of all things. Whether we are exploring the workings of human anatomy or the mysteries of the universe, it is clear that everything is connected and that there is no real separation between the individual and the whole.",

I have an anxiety disorder (OCD) and I googled these symptoms and then had a panic attack when I saw some of the results.\n\nAnyway, during those three days I lost a lot of weight (6lbs), and now I would like to try a low carb, whole food diet instead. My question is this:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) Doesn't ketosis occur regardless of diet, assuming there is a calorie deficit? I could eat a Big Mac Meal every day, but if I ran a marathon and lifted weights too, so long as I expended more calories than I consumed, would that not result in my body tapping into its own fat? \n\n2) I like the idea of a REASONABLY low carb diet - say 150g per day. If I exercised moderately, would this not help me enter ketosis?\n\nIs anyone aware of such a diet? 'Low calorie diet' just seems to direct to keto.\n\nPS - I am aware that electrolytes may have stopped the palpitations, but the advice on how much to take was guess work, and I couldn't risk having any more of them.",

How can we talk about the relative differences in *stress* populations deal with (assuming the stresses themselves are \"the same\")? \n\n**Some irresponsibility loose questions and conjecture**\n\nDoes more selective pressure imply faster evolution? In extremely stable or simple environments, wouldn't we see the forms of organisms remain relatively unchanged over time compared to environments with more variability and complexity? *Why change if you're fitting in just fine?*\n\nIf nothing in particular is \"motivating\" organisms to adapt, wouldn't their genes merely drift? But if resources are scarce and competition is unforgiving, there's a \"force\" which is \"pushing\" the organisms to change.\n\nI guess I'm thinking of \"living fossils\" on the sea floor compared to the diversity of mammals. Some forms remain relatively unchanged for 200 million years, and other radically different forms sprout up in under 50 million. It seems like it almost has to be a result of the demands imposed on organisms, so how do you \"weigh\" that \"force\", especially when it's comprised of different things (predator relations, weather and climate, sexual selectivity, etc)?\n\nWho and what should I read regarding this line of questioning?

So, does that make monocytes and NK cells types of lymphocytes? When I look into that it just starts telling me that dendritic cells and macrophages are both actually monocytes, which confuses things further. Returning to the original point though, some sites directly state that monocytes come from myeloid cells, which is the complete opposite of the lecture material.

Aboriginal people would have evolved much differently to a different climate, and also been excluded from all other human species. So are pure Aboriginal people subspecies to white humans, and just like lions and tigers can make ligers, that's how we could make babies with them.",

Here comes the new born population, let's say population A.\n\n- we have a country (and ancestors) where there was no (or less) innovation, pretty much everyone was a slave of some sort. New born population, let's say population B.\n\nFor me, it seems obvious that taken these new born populations (A and B), put in two isolated box, population A has a better potential, just because of genetics.\n\nIs it a big difference, or a small difference? I don't know, and it's not the point of how big this difference is. \n\nObviously, moving away from the extremes, we can look at countries with a lot of history regarding thinkers, education etc... And countries with less of that.\n\n\nI know this question can seem racist, and maybe it is , but I just want a civil debate :)",

Medics were able to establish a faint pulse after eight minutes of CPR. Her heart stopped twice after arriving at the hospital and she was placed on life support. Doctors attempted to lower her body temperature to prevent additional brain injury. She was declared clinically dead for ***17 hours*** after doctors failed to detect brain activity. Her son, Tim Thomas, stated that \"her skin had already started hardening, her hands and toes were curling up, they were already drawn\". She was taken off life support and funeral arrangements were in progress. However, ten minutes after being taken off life support, she revived and recovered.\n\n- Wikipedia",
