Some movies like Sharknado try to reverse engineer that sort of film and fail to make it funny and just bad. So I was kind of shocked to discover Cocaine Bear to be both genuinely funny and well-made. \n\nIt was produced by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller which I feel like should've been a bigger selling in the marketing since they made movies like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and the Lego movie. If you liked those to send wanted see a loving send up the horror genre in the same tone then you're gonna love this film. \n\nReddit, what are your though on Cocaine Bear?",

        "text": "I'm talking only about plots, that is, issues that changed in the sequel what had been shown in the previous film. I'm not talking about cases where the movie is bad on its own and ruins the franchise.\n\nExamples like the one in [The Karate Kid Part II](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091326/) that makes Miyagi have had a girlfriend or something like that with whom he meets again in Okinawa and ruins everything that had been raised in the great scene that got Pat Morita nominated for an Oscar, when he is remembering his wife, his great love, who died. She's not the same woman, I know, but it doesn't matter who she is because now her dead wife is not his only love, his great love.\n\nLike in the saga-ruining [Spider-Man 3](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413300/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0) where they suggest that the Sandman was there at Uncle Ben's carjacking and suddenly he's guilty of murder, so everything that had happened in the first one with the thief that Peter let get away and then went looking for in a rage and let him fall to his death makes no sense.\n\nIt's not even worth mentioning the Star Wars saga, and I'm talking about the saga that's worth it, the one written by its creator George Lucas, because all the shit they did afterwards doesn't even count. But hey, in the three main ones, the ones that are worth the most, they contradict each other because they were inventing at the time. First Luke's father was a pilot who Darth Vader killed and Leia could be a romance for Luke, who he stole a kiss from. And well, all that changed in the next two films. And then in the prequels they came up with a bunch of new things that why name them.\n\nThat's what I mean, any more movies? Obviously if the movie is named there will be some spoiler, so read carefully.",

I noticed Freddie’s hair is exactly the same. The nipples of the sand woman is also exactly the same. It’s hard to tell by the focus, but in the background, it looks like only male legs are in the shot.\n\nSo the last shot is a memory, back in the past. This is where his mind goes. Maybe unlike Dodd, Freddie just wanted a woman to love and be loved by. Whereas Dodd needed to find the bigger picture of life, a higher meaning. I’m not sure. \n\nCould also be that Freddie doesn’t believe he will really love anyone the way he loved Doris, and that’s where the sand woman takes place over just ending the scene with Winn.\n\nAt the same time, Freddie is at peace. He might not be right for this world as Dodd and Peggy believe, and maybe Freddie would agree he is not suited right in society. But he’s found his own peace.

        "text": "I assume the latter but it sounds like a good idea.  I never watched it because it always looked bad to me, especially De Niro as Capone. Idk, just always seemed corny and vanilla to me. \n\n\nThe Untouchables is a 1987 American crime film[3] directed by Brian De Palma, produced by Art Linson, and written by David Mamet. The film is loosely based on the book of the same name (1957) and the real-life events it was based on, but most of its plot is fictionalized.[4][5] The film stars Kevin Costner, Charles Martin Smith, Andy García, Robert De Niro (in the third collaboration between De Palma and De Niro, following 1968's Greetings and 1970's Hi, Mom!), and Sean Connery, and follows Eliot Ness (Costner) as he forms the Untouchables team to bring Al Capone (De Niro) to justice during Prohibition. The Grammy Award–nominated score was composed by Ennio Morricone and features period music by Duke Ellington.[6]",

Comedies that have big goofy surreal gags. \n\nSo for example bridesmaids, cool runnings and 21 jump street, romy &amp; michele, mean girls, beat in show, coming to america and drop dead gorgeous are fantastic comedies but they are not 'ludicrous' - everything (pretty much) in it could actually happen in the real world. They are grounded in reality. \n\nBut airplane, they came together, hot rod, real genius, men in tights, spaceballs, bedazzled, not another teen movie, wet hot american summer, who framed roger rabbit, tropic thunder, the lonely guy, the man with two brains are really 'out there' and 'gonzo', the whole film is like the kind of wacky sketches you see on sketch shows like key &amp; peele. \n\nNote: sci fi plot points and dream sequences don't count. This is a classic example of a ludicrously comedic scene: https://youtu.be/sCG88QHentc\n\nGot any recommendations for films like these that are FUNNY AF please?",

It’s so artistic. So poetic. Props to the Coogler’s, props to Michael B. \n\nI know that the technological advances make it hard to compare to Rocky or Raging Bull, but even if you filmed that sequence on the same cameras as Raging Bull and no CGI it would be fucking amazing.",

Honestly I feel it deserves some discussion. \n\nI'll preface by saying its not a masterpiece, but that said, I enjoyed it. Some spoilers ahead!\n\nThe story is nothing ground breaking. Classic revenge plot. But it does the job of getting our main character to the action.\n\nThe acting isn't the worst. Considering just how low budget this film is I've got to give credit. I've seen much more expensive productions with way more Wooden characters. \n\nAnd the production needs a special mention given that the star of the film also did the writing, directing, cinematography and a host of other jobs. It was clearly his vision, project and creation.\n\nBut the reason I watched the film to the end was the action. Its bonkers. It reminded me of anime. The way the camera moves are done combined with the special effects delivers such high impact punches and kicks. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it! \n\nTry and find it with subtitles if you can (It's an Italian film). But if you can find a plot synopsis then tbh you can get away without a subbed version. The first time I watched it was original language with no subtitles and it was a bit frustrating, but I was still able to understand the main points.",

        "text": "From the beginning of the movie we are shown the type of man Rico is; a weak minded person who needs validation from others before making a decision.  He cares for no one but himself.\n\nRico:\n- Asks his teacher if he should join the mobile infantry, can’t decide for himself.\n- Makes Carmen tell him she loves him before she departs.  Later we see Dizzy tell him she loves him, and he just smiles the same way Carmen did.  **Hypocrite**\n- He smiles as Dizzy gets choked out by the boot instructor.\n- In the shower while everyone is giving their reasoning for joining, he is the only one who cops an attitude for no apparent reason.\n- Gets a man killed, per his own explanation “because he wanted to win”\n- Quits the Mobile Infantry, only to rejoin because he’s now affected.\n- Sucker punches Zander.\n- Once he is promoted by his teacher, he immediately looks to Jake Busey and asks him if he wants to be squad leader, despite Busey already failing and Dizzy obviously being the stronger soldier.\n- Turns down Dizzy’s request to dance, only to have sex with her minutes later because his teacher told him to never turn down a good thing.\n- Goes off mission when Carmen’s plane crashes, getting a man killed in the process so he could save his girl obsession.\n\nMeanwhile Zander:\n- Joins the mobile fleet of his own free will and accord.\n- Offers his hand to Rico at the dance “no hard feelings”, only for Rico to give a childish response.\n- Despite his feelings for Carmen, he still keeps professional and chastised her for exceeding port speed.\n- In his confrontation with Rico, stripped his rank in honor.\n- Saves Rico by flying into the nest, despite it being overrun by bugs.  He even starts giving them cover fire.\n- When Zander and Carmen crash, he gives her a knife to protect her.  Even as he knows he’s about to die, he does so with honor by cursing the brain bug.\n\n**In summary, Rico is a bitch.  Carmen should have rocked Zander’s world in front of him to show him what a cuck he is**",
