Allow me to give a few example sentences to clarify my uncertainty.\n\n1.  And so ***they*** bowed unto her with honour in ***their heart***; and she withdrew into the lone dark of a baleful night. \n2.  The ***warriors*** bowed, and a silent understanding seemed to live in ***their hearts***. \n3.  At length they unmounted their ***horses*** and guided them by their reins, for now they left the river and entered deep into the woods. \n\nThere is a scene in which several people each possess a certain object, so that there are several of such objects present within that scene. Obviously, each person has a heart. So, does this mean I should say *they bowed with honour in their* ***heart***, or should it be ***hearts***?\n\nIdem for the example of the horses. Two people are riding upon their own horse, therefore two horses are present. Should it therefore be: *they unmounted their* ***horse***, or: ***horses***? If you say *horse*, it may come across that two people are riding *one* horse*.* But, hypothetically, *horses* could imply (illogically) that each person is riding several horses at the same time. The latter scenario can perhaps better be illustrated with this example: *they drew their* ***sword/s***. If you use ***sword*** (singular), two or more people are either in the possession of each their own sword, which they draw, or they are drawing one big sword together :-). If you use ***swords*** (plural), several swords are drawn in the scene because there are several swords present; one sword per person. But it may also imply each person has *several* swords.\n\nThank you for your insight and help,\n\n*Rainfall*",

My professor said that there is an *implied* \"that\" or \"but that\" after the comma and that would make it a dependent clause.

        "text": "Please settle this for me.        \nRecently I observed a teacher's lesson, and on multiple occasions she would promt the students to provide the spelling of a particular word they had given as an answer by simply saying \"How to spell?\"         \n\nShe is not the only one, mind you, and spelling is not the only thing being asked for with this phrasing. I have observed \"How to write?\" and \"How to say?\" being used in other classes by other teachers.         \n\nLater during a feedback session I asked that she try to focus on changing the phrasing to \"How do you...\", as many of my students use this phrasing in my class and I am having a hard time training it out of them.        \nShe then promptly informed me that I am wrong, and that I am not a native speaker (I am not) and she had asked other native speaking teachers who had worked at the same school before me and they all said that she was correct.          \n\nWhen I explained that her question lacks a tense, she said that the grammar was implied by the context of the conversation. I am not entirely against this line of reasoning, and am in favour of descriptive grammar rules, and yet this particular phrasing just sits wrong with me.         \n\nHere's the thing, I cannot for the life of me find the rule for why it's so wrong, beyond some vague echoing of \"Do insertion in question formation\" in the back of my head. There is also a chance that I am indeed wrong about this. But I need to have it solved, because I have been tasked with ensuring the quality of English instruction at our school and this will ultimately come down on me if it is indeed as wrong as it sounds and our British headmaster happens to hear it being used with the students.",

        "text": "*I really like my photo-editing software.*\n\nIn the sentence above, should \"photo-editing software\" be hyphenated? My inclination is to hyphenate; as I understand it, \"editing\" is a gerund and \"photo editing\" is a noun+gerund compound (or maybe a gerund phrase?). Therefore, \"photo-editing software\" is a noun+gerund compound that modifies a noun, like [mountain-climbing enthusiast](https://www.capstoneediting.com.au/blog/how-to-hyphenate-a-compound-noun#:~:text=He%20loves%20mountain%20climbing%20so%20much.%20He%20is%20a%20mountain%2Dclimbing%20enthusiast.) or [problem-solving techniques](https://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tpv2guides/guides/wrtps/index-eng.html?lang=eng&amp;lettr=indx_catlog_h&amp;page=9ISOUCn-8TP4.html#:~:text=problem%2Dsolving%20techniques). \n\nHowever, my photography professor (who is a former English teacher) disagrees. He says that I shouldn't be hyphenating \"photo-editing software,\" and he hasn't really explained his reasoning. He did point to examples of common usage where the phrase isn't hyphenated (take a look at the top Google results for \"photo editing software,\" and it's clear that pretty much everybody writes without the hyphen), but my sense is that those websites are technically wrong.\n\nAlso, speaking more practically, doesn't \"photo-editing software\" clear up confusion? After all, it's software for editing photos, *not* editing software that exists in the form of a photo.\n\nCan anyone help me out? I really don't mind being wrong, but if I am wrong, I just want to know why. Thanks so much!",

        "text": "So there is something a lot of people do in grammar that bothers me, but I’m not sure if it’s even incorrect.  They start a sentence with “but” and end it with “though”.  For example, “But it was really good though.”  And yes, I meant to leave out the comma there.  \n\nI know it sounds pretentious and I’ll probably get downvoted, but I was wondering if this bothers anyone else (even if it is correct).  I personally just hate the sound of it.\n\nAlso I don’t know if I put the correct flair, sorry if I didn’t.",

(i assume I'm using the correct grammar anyway), I want to be able to thoroughly explain everything my student may ask when I actually become a teacher.",
