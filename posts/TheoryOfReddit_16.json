        "text": "The Donald is a community which many left leaning contributors to Reddit may have never seen coming, much like the election of president Trump. This is a community of normal people influenced by the internet, often young, teenaged boys. Young, teenage boys are often influenced by wanting to ‘fit-in’ to peer groups. For many who reject social conditions as they see it, they fit into an ‘ironic acceptance’ peer group. They know these things are wrong, but are so disillusioned with the system that they want to shove this wrongness in our face because they see the entire system as corrupt. To me, this entire ‘Trump’ movement is showing that the core social structure of the United States, and perhaps the world, is facing some sort of inevitable fracture. The demographics most likely to support Trump are poor and middle class whites, who often are undergoing significant hardship in their lives as they slowly, realize the ‘American Way of Life’ was a short-lived dream. \n\n\n\nEveryone experiences this in a different way, but your typical Donald Trump supporter who also posts on The Donald is typically a young, teenaged boy who feels rejected in some way by their peer group. They stand for a large network of cultural movements of dismissal of culturally acceptable behavior. These groups often share characteristics, like cultural non-acceptance of their beliefs, attitudes, social structures, etc. or their fears of attempted cultural extinguishment by the dominant culture. \n\n\nInternet memes are a new way for culture to spread and change at a quicker rate than ever before, developing cultural consensuses at a quicker rate than many of us older individuals can understand. These memes can easily be influenced by money or outside actors. There is a very real possibility that we are in the middle of a secret “culture war” between the US and other nations, where memes and access to information is now the most powerful influencer of economic growth in the United States, data brokers hold tremendous power. Those who can create algorithms and have access to vast amounts of data hold incredible power. The_Donald is an example of an entire generation being subverted into the cultural memes of an oligarch, Donald Trump, wanting to be president. This is one more notch on the belt for him- perhaps one he entered in too quickly.\n\nDisaffected teenagers have been around for every generation, many have become anti-war activists, many were in 'alternative' sub cultures like 'Goth', this is just a cultural meme that has been propagating for a long time at least within the developments of modern culture. Now, this entire culture movement is being usurped by radical groups trying to influence opinion on the mass scale. \n\nDisaffected teenagers seeking validation are more prone to certain beliefs, which represent power and strength of the oppressed when combined into larger groups. This encourages moderators, on a meta level, to increase perceived subscribership in order to further embolden this group.\n\nMy real question is to what extent are these moderators doing these things on their own, or being under the influence of nation states or large organizations, with or without their knowledge. Considering for at least the past decade, governments have been collecting sophisticated meta-data on individuals, influencing behavior with the advent of the internet is cheaper and easier than ever. Opportunity cost wise, this works way better than traditional \"intelligence\". It would be trivial for a nation-state to infiltrate Reddit. Brands do all the time, and this is what keeps Reddit afloat. \n\nI would be happy to hear any of your thoughts on this matter!\n",

        "text": "Some weeks ago a comment on Reddit went wildly viral, claiming that John McCain was playing 3-dimensional chess or something by voting to bring the \"skinny repeal\" amendment to a vote, and then voting against it, because then the Republicans couldn't vote on it again for the rest of the year:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/6q1snh/us_senate_healthcare_repeal_bill_fails/dku2gyq/\n\nHowever, when the comment went so viral that it made the news, real political journalists weighed in that the comment was factually wrong, basically because the Senate was voting on an amendment, not a bill:\nhttps://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/1/16069414/obamacare-repeal-reconciliation-tax-reform\nhttp://www.snopes.com/mccains-vote-obamacare-repeal/\n\nAs it happens, several users had posted comments in the original thread pointing out the error.  Here's how many points those rebuttals got:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/6q1snh/us_senate_healthcare_repeal_bill_fails/dkxc7xb/\n3 points\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/6q1snh/us_senate_healthcare_repeal_bill_fails/dkv01mw/\n2 points\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/6q1snh/us_senate_healthcare_repeal_bill_fails/dkv7olc/\n2 points\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/6q1snh/us_senate_healthcare_repeal_bill_fails/dkv5p36/\n13 points, we have a winner!  (Well, one of those upvotes was from me.)  Only 400 times less than the original incorrect post, instead of 2500 times less.\n\nBut this is also an argument for the random-sample-voting algorithm that I was talking about:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/70s7ev/meta_evidence_of_the_bandwagon_effect_and_an/\n\nWithout random-sample-voting, the virality of every post is a crap shoot, so you could end up with a situation where the original, wrong post \"goes through the roof\", but the factually correct rebuttals don't.\n\nBut with random-sample-voting, each post gets a rating which is approximately the average rating it would get from the entire population eligible to vote on it.  So even if the original erroneous post got traction, the rebuttal pointing out the error would also get traction.  So, with the rebuttal being highly visible right underneath it, the original comment would have gotten fewer upvotes and more downvotes and probably would have been stopped in its tracks before it went \"super-viral\" and made the mainstream news.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/71fnia/my_biggest_stumbling_blocks_as_a_new_redditor/",
        "text": "As someone who only recently started posting frequently on Reddit, I've enjoyed a lot of the interactions and feedback and the occasional heady rush when a post goes \"through the roof,\" but here is a list of things that I considered the biggest annoyances and stumbling blocks.  While some of these can only actually be *changed* by the admins, this might be useful as a guide for mods (and others) as to what to warn newbies about.  Basically, these are all the things that I wish someone had told me before I started.\n\n- Lack of notification when a post is removed. I know the idea is so that trolls won't be notified so that they don't re-post their content again, but it also applies to regular users.  For users that aren't trolls, it means that (a) if the post is removed for an invalid reason (e.g. over-aggressive spam filter), the user misses a chance to provide feedback and help get the problem fixed; (b) if the post is removed for a valid reason, the user misses the chance to realize that they did actually break a rule, and avoid breaking that rule next time.  So you basically have to keep checking your own posts to see if they got removed.\n\n- The fact that if a text post is removed, you have to log out to see the \"[removed]\" string.  I know the admins are standing by this as a design choice, but as a new user, it's annoying.\n\n- The fact that if a link post is removed, it doesn't even get the [removed] string -- there might optionally be a comment or a flair added by the mods or by AutoModerator to give the reason for the removal, but if they aren't courteous enough to do that, you'll never know why at all.  (Unless you're continuously checking the \"new\" queue to see if your post shows up in the time bracket where it's supposed to appear.)\n\n- The fact that if a post is removed, and you appeal the decision to the moderators, and they restore it, the post now shows up in the \"new\" queue with the date that it was originally posted, not the date that it was restored.  That means even after it's restored, it's so far down in the queue that nobody's ever going to see it anyway.\n\n- The fact that the AutoModerator spam filter is so aggressive.  I haven't kept score but it seems like about 1/3 of my posts get removed by the spam filter (and even though the moderators usually restore them after I ask, at that point they're too far down in the queue for anybody to see them anyway, see above).\n\n- Moderators applying rules that are not clearly posted in the subreddit rules.  I realize Reddit cannot \"fix\" this as long as the moderators are the final arbiters of what gets posted in a subreddit, but it's annoying.  I posted a few random things in ShowerThoughts like \"Hiking above the clouds always makes me feel like I'm playing one of the cloud levels in a Super Mario game, which I think means I didn't get out enough as a kid but I'm getting out the right amount now.\"  When that got deleted and I asked why, a mod said \"It's just a commentary about how you feel.\"  Well, yeah, but so are most of the posts there.  It doesn't violate any of the actual rules in the sidebar; if users think it's stupid then they can vote it down.\n\n- As an extension of the above, AutoModerator applying rules that are not clearly posted.  This post:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/6p3lpj/how_many_different_pictures_can_you_find_in_this/\nwas deleted with a comment that it violated the rule against the \"x-post\" tag.  After much confusion, someone guessed that the word \"six-picture\" might have tripped up a filter on the string \"x-p\", so I posted it again with just the word \"picture\" and it didn't get deleted.\n\n- Finally, even if your post manages to avoid all of these pitfalls, there is the simple fact that the amount of visibility it gets is mostly determined by dumb luck.\nI've submitted a few dozen posts and links, and about half of them remained at 1 or 0 while some got to a few dozen, a few hundred, or 10K+ votes, and it seems pretty clear to me that the ones which went \"through the roof\" are not any better than the ones that fizzled.  The reason why has been much discussed; that it mostly depends on the first 10 upvotes you get, which is just a matter of coincidence:\nhttps://www.digitaltrends.com/how-to/how-to-get-a-link-on-the-front-page-of-reddit/\nI'm aware that there's no ATM where you can go to redeem karma points for cash, but I like the interactivity when something gets a lot of visibility -- people correct me on points that I was wrong about, or tell me something new, or add new jokes to build on the initial joke.  And it's just nice to know that something I posted made a lot of people smile, or think.  But it's de-motivating to put in the effort necessary to create new content, when you know that the number of people who will see it is overwhelmingly determined by luck.\n\nI'm sure 90% of people here were already aware of almost all of this, but here's a relatively new user's perspective.  Hope this is helpful.",

        "text": "[already asked permission before the meta-post :) ]\n\nI got hooked on trying to score high-upvoted posts after one of my first posts, on r/todayilearned, got to the front page.  But then after a long sequence of attempts to repeat that feat, it became pretty obvious that the driving factor in the number of upvotes is dumb luck, and I just had beginner's luck.\n\nIf you browse through my \"submitted\" tab (even just for posts to /r/todayilearned), most stayed at the default of 1, some got to a few dozen or a few hundred, and 3 got to the front page and got over 15,000.  It seems pretty clear to me that, however, you define \"better\", the ones that hit 15,000 were not 15,000 times better than the ones that scored a 1.  I don't really think they were better at all.\n\nThis article:\nhttps://www.digitaltrends.com/how-to/how-to-get-a-link-on-the-front-page-of-reddit/\nbasically explains what happens -- a critical mass of people have to see and upvote your post when it's first posted, and then the snowball effect gets your post in front of more people, and then a critical mass of *those* people have to upvote it, and so on.  So as long as your post meets a minimum threshold of quality, all you're talking about is several successive waves of luck.\n\nFine, but this is de-motivating for any type of post that requires serious effort.  I don't want to spend an hour writing up a recipe, or a life hack, or a serious political argument, if the number of people who will interact with it is determined almost 100% by chance, and there's more than a 50% chance that nobody will comment on it at all.\n\nI proposed an alternative in IdeasForTheAdmins that I think would fix this problem:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortheadmins/comments/6ye24r/have_post_visibility_determined_by_the_votes_of_a/\nTL;DR: have the rating of a post determined by showing it first to a small random subset of subscribers in a subreddit, who cannot yet see who else has voted on that post.  Whatever percentage of those subscribers upvotes the post, that's the \"rating\" that the post gets, which determines its visibility within that subreddit and, possibly, on the rest of reddit as well.\n\nIt sounds deceptively simple, but it takes almost all of the luck out of it.  As long as your initial random sample is large enough, the average rating from those users would be close to the average rating that the post would get from the user population as a whole.\n\nAt the same time, it makes it harder to spam (no spam is going to get through the initial voting round), and makes it much harder to game the system through bot upvoting or circle-of-friends upvoting. (In order to control a significant percentage of the random sample of voters, you'd have to control a significant percentage of all the users in the whole subreddit.  That's a lot more bots and a lot more chance of getting detected.)\n\n[Edited because in the original post, I linked to the IdeasForTheAdmins subreddit, instead of my actual post in that subreddit]",

Clicking on any of the users shows they're like a sort of bot, just posting random different insurance questions across all these subreddits.\n\nIf you want, go on a subreddit and click on one of the users. You'll be shown dozens of other subreddits filled with this.\n\nDoes anyone know the purpose of these bot users and subreddits? SEO purposes? Something I'm completely missing?

Often it has to do with the wife/girlfriend not knowing how to use technology to an absurd degree, but it can also be an anecdote relating to her lack of general knowledge that highlights a stereotype about women (for example, she doesn't understand a basic rule of driving). These stories are often very far-fetched and mean spirited, as if the commenter/poster made it up (or perhaps embellished a real life scenario where the woman's misinformed behavior was less extreme) to reinforce the \"women are stupid\" stereotype. Given that making fun of your significant other on the internet is a very hostile and emotionally immature thing to do that most people would probably consider grounds for a breakup, I'm pretty certain that almost all of these anecdotes are made up.\n\n\nHas anyone else noticed/been bothered by this?",

They almost always derail the conversation and people give into it. I'm not sure if I hate the haiku bot or the good bot bad bot bot more, but the conversation about it always takes the brunt of the upvotes despite being the literal definition of spam on the internet. How do people not get annoyed with these bots taking up so much prominent space in comments sections around Reddit? Why do people upvote and thus encourage them? Even the smaller subs are falling to this. Also why is there no written policy on bots? Some subs ban them outright, but others don't. As a mod, I want my subs to be a place for discussion relevant to the sub, not fixing links or making haikus or evaluating the performance of another bot and the conversations surrounding that. \n\nI think this is also a really good example of the complete death of the policy that you are supposed to upvote and downvote based on what is good discussion and not based on what you like and don't like. Though I think that ship sailed years ago when people got used to Facebook \"likes\" and the idea spread everywhere.",

        "text": "This is just my personal observation. So take from it what you will. \n\nUp until maybe the last year or so, /r/IAmA was a very prominent part of this site if not the defining subreddit for it. The mods were the most well known redditors including people like /u/karmanaut and /u/chooter. The AMAs themselves were routinely on top of the front page and defined the memes and references elsewhere across the site. \n\nA few years ago, the admins made a huge push to use it as the primary method to drive more people to the site. They made a dedicated app for it. Experimented with video AMAs and sponsored ones with companies/celebrities. They published a book with the threads printed out. And more that I'm sure I've forgotten about.  \n\nNow, all of that seems gone. Just looking at the calendar on their sidebar, it does not seem nearly as full as it used to be. Just 4 over the next month, none of which are particularly notable. There used to be one scheduled almost every day, and it included real celebrities. While I never actually subscribed, it was always easy to find prominent moments like the Woody Harrelson or Obama AMAs because there was discussion about them spread all over the site. Now, that hardly ever happens. Last one I can remember was Ken Bone's AMA almost a year ago. \n\nThe subreddit just seems fairly stagnant and i'm not exactly sure why. There are only two posts on their front page right now with more than 1000 comments. Has reddit just lost interest in them? If so, can this be attributed to /u/chooter's departure? I think that certainly played a significant role in changing the sub. It pissed a lot of people off and pushed them away from it.",

Now every popular comment posted by a bot tends to have [an endless string of](https://i.imgur.com/IRK3sZR.png) \"good bot\" and (less) \"bad bot\" replies, [moderators have expressed their disdain](https://np.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/6u950g/a_look_at_the_ugoodbot_badbot_bot/dlsmun6/):  \n\n&gt; As a mod, I loathe goodbot badbot. All bots inevitably litter comments sections, and the question is whether their content is worth it. But this bot doesn't just litter comments sections with its own crap, it actively encourages users to leave dozens of spam comments of their own, which leaves readers scrolling through entire pages full of\n&gt; \n&gt; good bot\n&gt; \n&gt; bad bot\n&gt; \n&gt; bad bot\n&gt; \n&gt; good bot\n&gt; \n&gt; bad bot\n&gt; \n&gt; good bot\n&gt; \n&gt; good bot\n&gt; \n&gt; It's annoying as all hell, and just banning the damn thing doesn't fix it, because users still vote on the bots that haven't been banned. I've had to add automod rules to remove everything with a \"good bot\" or \"bad bot\". It is probably the bot I've disliked most that I've ever seen on reddit. At least the smiley face bots only create one piece of spam every two seconds, and only on their own accounts.\n   \nThe bot should at least share a link to another website for voting. I have never moderated a subreddit, but this certainly is the most hated Reddit bot also for me.  \nSomewhat similar result could be achieved by simply looking at bots' karma points.  \n\n\n---\n\nYou can block users in [Reddit Enhancement Suite](https://redditenhancementsuite.com) settings: https://www.reddit.com/#res:settings/userTagger (\"Hard Ignore\")\n",

        "text": "This isn't my first account, I've made a lot of the years, probably on the count of 2 or 3 per year since joining in 2010. I generally move on for privacy reasons etc. One thing I've noticed since joining reddit, is that each year successively, reddit becomes more of a pain in the ass to be a new user on. I would say it started to get bad in 2014 and now it's just a full blown guessing game trying to post anywhere with a new account.\n\nWhat is the problem exactly? it's all the nontransparent shadowbanning subreddits do to new user's submissions. I'm not against this in principle but it's the non transparency which makes using this site such a chore\n\nI know this 'system' exists because of spam, but let me tell you why this system is bad for reddit if you want people actually using the site and not just reading it\n\n1. Account age limits are not standard. Some subreddits don't have them, some are set for 2 days, others 4, others 2 weeks, etc.\n\n2. Subreddits do not make their age limits known. You can only figure out if the sub has an account age limit after posting and by looking at the new queue in incognito or logging out.\n\n3. This system is just a complete shitshow to anybody trying to use reddit who isn't a veteran. I wonder how many people legitimately sign up for reddit, try to post, and then wonder why nobody responds? I just tried to post to /r/cooking, then I realized that nobody was responding, of course automod showbanned me because I'm new, but why doesn't /r/cooking notify me of this? \n\nWhy can't subreddits simply state \"we do not allow new users to submit posts for X days,\" and why does automod not TELL you this after submitting? Do you know how annoying and frustrating it is trying to post on reddit as a new user in 2017? For anybody who doesn't believe me, make a new account and go and post in your favorite subs. It's like a lottery whether or not automod decides to remove your posts or not. It's not just /r/cooking. also there's a big irony in me making this post because I know it's going to get deleted immediately like somebody trying to cross the east german border and I'm going to have to get it approved(thanks mods btw love you guys for approving this lul)\n\nHere's me trying to post about stew on /r/cooking\n\n1. spend 5 minutes writing about stew on /r/cooking\n\n2. make post\n\n3. have to go into incognito, and look at 'new'\n\n4. realize it's not there\n\n5. have to either kill myself because of how unfriendly this site is to use or go beg the mod a second time to approve my post by AT WHICH POINT IT'S APPROVED IT'S BEEN SITTING IN THE QUEUE FOR SO LONG THAT NOBODY LOOKS AT IT ANYWAY\n\nthis is not how this system has to work and we can avoid this stupidity by doing these two simple things\n\n**1. subreddits must state how long new users aren't allowed to make subbmisions for in the sidebar, and**\n\n**2. new users whom make a post and don't fit the account age requirements will be notified by auto moderator after posting. Either through a PM or a thread comment.**\n\nWhat is so hard about these two things? If automod automatically removes stuff, why can't it automatically tell you it was removed? Why can't subreddits do this? Why must posting on reddit in 2017 be like playing minesweeper on hard?\n\n\nThis automoderator removing your post without telling you shit is old and busted now. It was cute in 2013. Why should I have to open the subreddit on incognito mode and look at the new queue? Why can't it just tell me that I'm too new? \n\n**I will gladly wait out a time limit for submitting posts, it's not the waiting that bothers me.** What bothers me is the non transparency. Simply tell me that I'm too new and I have to wait. Simply tell me this after I post, notify me so I'm not left wondering. If automod can remove all posts from users under X account age, automod can notify me it was removed. What I hate is this incognito mode douchebaggery you have to put yourself through this every time you post to make sure it even went through. It's not even new users who are affected by this. Some subs I've found will delete your submissions even if your account is years old because they have an \"X amount of comments made in the sub\" stipulation, which of course isn't posted you have to figure that one out yourself.\n\nAnd finally, let me touch on this system in general. It's not even like this system deters the big tuna fish spammers. It might have worked back in 2013 before spamming/shilling on reddit blew up on an industrial scale. This system we have in place right now stops maybe your average minnow from spamming his youtube channel or your mom from posting in /r/sewing. What this system doesn't stop is the big fish. Industrial account farmers are out there, making thousands of accounts a day and aging them like fine wine to get around any age requirements. This pesky automod shadowban system doesn't do anything to stop industrial level account farming. The people farming accounts professionally already know about the system and circumnavigate it easily. All this system does is hurt the little guy who wants to use reddit normally.\n",

This is on mobile btw, I haven't checked on desktop yet.\n\nI checked the update log for the Reddit app and nothing there indicates this kind of change. It does say that you can now filter the popular page by region but I noticed a difference in the homepage specifically.",

Are all these people or do bots also count towards views?\n\nAlso, I've noticed that my newer posts reach 8-10 views faster now where my older posts are at 2-6. Why do you guys think that is? The difference is 20 days (my sub is about 21 days old) but number of subscribers hasn't changed. So I'm not sure why the increase of views; or not sure if the increase of views correlates with the age of the sub.",
