        "text": "I just started a new job in embedded engineering and have no previous experience in the domain (4 years exp in backend/frontend). I was given a 3 month probationary period which is a month out. I was hired because I'm a good C programmer and am (probably) bright enough to read datasheets.\n\nI don't have any real supervision except for a weekly meeting? Should I personally change this or leave it be (im a huge fan). \n\nThis has led me to veer off track which I've mostly kept to personal time during the weekend. I've been given very loose goals of getting a small device to work and considering the deadline feel the pace some things are provided to me is lacking.\n\nThis has put me in a constant cycle of self-doubt of just figuring out *what* I can do. Learning obviously has been a major component; however, so much of what I do turns out to be useless as I find out once a week. For instance generating my own near-magnet field when the one I needed hasn't been provided to me (and it seems like company taboo to just email the chief scientist for a new set). \n\nI think (from writing this post) a direction is clear to finish the project, however I want to understand how to make my time more productive for the project at hand. I think though it might pain me only working on what is given to me is the surest way to not waste time.\n\n*edit* also i really love books and could use some. I picked up a book on linkers recently but want a very technical understanding of embedded software. my degree is actually in physics, so i'm really lacking a cs/ee library. ",

I love Anthropology, Archaeology in specific, and it is something that I am very passionate about, I want to major in it, and I genuinely just love. The problem is the field isn't the most viable with job opportunity. Now, I have seen videos and read about something called Software Engineering which sounded pretty dope. I am not the type of person to say something negative about someone until I speak to them and have a personal interaction, and I am the same with anything else in life. On the surface, Software Engineering sounds pretty complicated especially, at least when I think of engineering, I think of fucking math. I fucking hate dealing with numbers and math. On the flip side, I have never tried coding which again, I just assume would involve some sort of math but the point is, is that I never tried coding which in turn, I don't know if I would enjoy doing it or not, but I don't want to disregard it. My plan is to finish community college and get the AA in Anthropology then transfer to a 4 year uni and there, change my major to Software Engineering if I end up liking/enjoying it and make my minor Archaeology. I know this was very long but essentially with all that being said my question is: What can I do to see if I would be interested in Software Engineering? Is there anything I can do to learn more or any physical coding that I could dick around and fiddle with to see if it would peak my interest? Appreciate any and all responses, thanks in advanced guys!  ",

I know there are lots of strong opinions about this kind of thing and I think I'm sufficiently open-minded about them, but I also think that most serious engineers know cargo cult engineering when they see it and are usually rubbed the wrong way by it. I hope this can **not** be a conversation about the benefits of agile or Agile. If you care about these things, just assume that \"this is the bad kind of agile\".\n\nI'm looking for a way to evade these meetings. I don't want conflict with my co-workers, none of whom are really interested in doing anything but following the herd right into the conference room. \"Don't make waves\".\n\nI don't want to make waves either. I want to actually be productive, and these kinds of things infuriate me for some reason. For my sanity, I need to find a way to escape these meetings and actually do work. All of my \"superiors\" have the same unthinking attitude about this stuff. I do not GAF what \"epic\" \"sprint\" or \"swim lane\" you put my current task in. Just leave me alone and let me get some work done!\n\nIn practice, I end up having to risk my life in silicon valley traffic just to attend this stupid religious service. I've tried ignoring, being evasive, etc. That has worked for other meetings, but when it comes to their Favorite Thing, no one will take a hint.\n\nAnybody got some good office-fu that I can use to escape? Should I risk my job by just directly confronting the head gas bag who's invested his very soul and sense-of-worth in Agileism?\n\nJust don't show up?

I've studied algorithms, data structures, classes the whole shindig, I can pretty much pick up a new language and be up and running in about a week. I've worked with C++, C#, Java and Python, as well as some experience in web development, and developed projects with all of them. Like I said I like both but I feel like a software engineering degree might offer better career prospects? Or perhaps I could go into the CS major and then get a master's degree in Software Engineering.\n\np.s: whichever major I choose I'm allowed to take 2 courses from the other one, in addition to the courses I've already finished.",

        "text": "This statement is not new and I am not the first to say it, but I completely agree. There are many aspects of system/service design which lead me to agree with this conclusion. \n\nUltimately, in its most simple form, synchronous data requests via REST are both a leaky abstraction and a breaking of encapsulation, leading to more tightly coupled, less resilient systems. It's the equivalent in my view, to having getters and setters on your classes, which should be avoided.\n\nI think it's worth clarifying, this does not apply for external facing systems. REST based APIs are the best way for external or user facing systems to interact with your system.  This doesn't mean you should lose asynchrony internally, and takes some design thought.\n\nIn my opinion, event driven systems are better, holistically, for organisations. They allow an improved mapping of both the business and technical domain. Increased levels of resilience, responsiveness and changeability.\n\nPrimarily however, they remove the impedance mismatch suffered by technical people talking to business people as the focus shifts from 'what data do we store' to 'what interesting things happen' in our system and everyone can have input when discussing events.",

I want to gain experience and become a software engineer. Currently I have degree in Computer Science and math with no experience. I think Revature will be a great place to start before I land my dream job. My old saying is this \"I first have to suffer before going to heaven\". My concerns are regarding living expenses. Am I going to be able to live independently?. 23$/h seems to little to live in places like NY or WA. Can someone provide feedback on this?. Thank you. ",

        "text": "Hey, I'm 5th year software engineering student. I'm also working currently part-time in a software development company where I'm doing various DevOps-like tasks in a team of 3 members such as handling CI, doing Linux and Windows server management with Salt, building small scripts with Python to automate various stuff and doing occasional Java development for our in-project testing framework. In that sense situation is good but..\n\nMy problem is currently that I'm a bit lost on where I should specialize, the school will soon end and I feel that I don't know anything that well. I know something about DevOps-like stuff but due to embedded nature of the project there's just not some stuff needed that is done in usual web-based deployments. On the other hand I also know some Python and Java (and little of others too) but I consider myself at most entry-level programmer because I don't have much experience with any of frontend, backend, desktop or embedded development. Just a bits from everywhere which I have done as a hobby. \n\nI'm a bit worried that if there's ever need to reduce people from our project at work I don't know what I would do after that because I don't know anything that well. If I think from current work perspective I would gain the most by learning C++ as that's what they use mostly for actual development, on the other hand DevOps + embedded development seems not so common combination. Going more usual backend / full-stack route on the other hand would require lots of work as I don't have experience with this and I don't get to do that at work currently, on the other hand this would allow me to learn also about those DevOps technologies I'm missing at the work at the moment.. Do you have any suggestions which route would supplement well the knowledge I already have and for which there is currently / in the near future need in the market? Thanks if anyone got till here and answers. ",

        "text": "I'm looking to extract list based product data from e-commerce sites without the need to create hand-written rules. My approach is to start off by identifying the leaf nodes of a given page recursively moving up the DOM tree to ancestor nodes. For each identified node I would then run a feature extractor and identify certain attributes including but not limited to the class name of the node, whether it contains an element that either has a price class or that matches a numeric regular expression, whether there is an element that contains a title class, whether there is an image as well as some of the nodes computed styles such as its position and size.\n\nI'm treating this as a classification problem, so I'd be running perhaps a naive bayes classifier since finding a dataset for this could prove troublesome.\n\nUpon predicting the node, I'd stop traversing the DOM and from it create an XPath that is a concatenation of all of that node's parents. This would then be fed to Scrapy for scraping.\n\nWould this have any reasonable chance of working?",
