I also hear that universities aren't doing enough to ensure student safety- by underreporting/mismanaging sexual assault or by allowing certain speakers, for instance. \n\nThe Ivies (particularly Harvard and Yale) seem to be constantly in the news for the actions and demonstrations of liberal students, which I find interesting because I would expect those schools to skew more conservative. I've also seen a general shift against fraternities and other gendered organizations that seem to tacitly accept the narrative that white male students are the source of social issues. \n\nIs there economic or educational sense to this? Am I misunderstanding college culture? Or is it all blown out of proportion by the right wing and the media?",

        "text": "Seems like a certain kind of advertising created a sort of stupid / delusional idea that some kind of thing is better just by repeatedly advertising it as a feature, without actually saying how it's better.\n\nThe most common example is Angus beef. It's simply a common breed of cattle raised for beef, and there's nothing exceptional about making burgers out of that. Recently fast food chains started advertising about it. This made me think that was a premium kind of meat until I learned more about it. It seems that without them actually explicitly saying it is better I got the impression that it is better.\n\nRecently I was also thinking about Vidalia onions. I've seen them advertised as if it's a good thing they're Vidalia and not just any sweet onions, but I've don't remember seeing any explicit claims about them being better. I thought those were supposed to be really good sweet onions, but, I can't say I've had any exceptionally good experiences with them, and if anything I've had better sweet onions from Peru and Mexico. Those other onions certainly had more flavour and sweetness than the Vidalia onions I have now. Again I feel I was somehow misguided; I thought Vidalia onions were supposed to be better to the extent I preferred to buy them, but I was never told that and can't say firsthand experiences taught me that.\n\nHow does this happen?",

        "text": "Hey guys.\n\nSo I saw Bill Nye's new show, and after watching the gender episode, I was pretty shocked to see the last bit about gender being on a spectrum. Bill has established so much trust and rapport with me that he really managed to challenge my paradigm on this. So I decided to seek out the science arguing in favour of Bill's position. As it turns out, there may actually be some legitimate science behind his claims.\n\nI've gone ahead and summarized the article that I found. I'll post it below along with a link.\n\nSo here's what I'm asking: Does gender exist on a spectrum? Why or why not? Do the arguments from the article satisfy you? Do you think these findings are a valid basis to enact changes in policy? What else do you think about this report?\n\n**Edit:** \n\nWhat's up with the downvotes, TrueAskReddit? This is an honest and thought out question, citing a prestigious and reputable source. There is clearly a question to be asked here. If you think this question is stupid, go back to regular AskReddit and circlejerk with the squad while the grown ups speak. \n\n**************************************************\nRequired reading: \n\nhttp://www.nature.com/news/sex-redefined-1.16943\n\nBrief summary of the arguments:\n\n**Before Birth**\n\n* The classic theory that all fetuses start off as female and switch to male is no longer credible. Researchers found a gene, called SRY, that is responsible for the process that determines sex. This process demonstrates that sex is determined by two opposing forces that land on a somewhere on a spectrum.\n\n* Researchers found specific genes that, when arranged in a certain way, create testes with ovarian characteristics, and ovaries with testicular characteristics in adult mice.\n\n**DSDs - Disorders of sex development**\n\n* Completely separate research teams deactivated certain genes in adult mice. In each case, the deactivation caused the mice to develop cells only found in the opposite gender.\n\n* After birth, human genitalia can actually change as a result of alterations in hormone levels. For example, people with CAIS have a disorder where their cells are 'deaf' to male hormones. People with CAIS have a Y chromosome, they develop internal testicles, they have a vagina, and they develop as women. \n\n* There are 25 genes associated with DSDs that all result in a variety of outcomes similar to CAIS. In one case, a 70 year old man was born with a uterus, and there are other cases where men are born with undeveloped ovaries.\n\n**Cells**\n\n* Cells do in fact have gender, but there are also cases where people have a body made of a mixture of the two gendered cells, and where the cells themselves are a somewhere between the two genders.\n\n* Microchimaerism - There are widespread cases of men and women carrying cells of the opposite sex. These cases include blood cells and brain cells. ",

We have by far the most ridiculous workload but for what, a lifetime of working in companies where replacing me wont make any impact and I likely wont do anything of substance. I feel like I'm wasting away these next few years constantly being stressed to have the privilege of potentially living an ordinary life. \n\nIts not even about the money for me. I don't want to have a 9-5 job and have a daily schedule. I do what I love and have wanted to be an engineer for as long as I can remember but I want more. In order to try to have fun me and some of my friends will try making designs over the summer for various products. That's the type of stuff I love. All this theoretical and technical bs has really made me uneasy. \n\nHow can I try avoiding to live an ordinary life? Seriously any help is appreciated. ",

I abhor terrorism and all it's perpetrators \n\nMy concern is mainly with the way I see people in the west react to terrorism. Specifically Islamic terrorism. \n\nIt seems to me that people seem to act as if their lives are legitimately threatened by terrorists as well as their civilisation. But I read this and I'm surprised by the hyperbole. \n\nFor example in the [following](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/66k3vp/champs_elysees_shooting_1_police_officer_killed/?st=J1RS4859&amp;sh=b203a66d) following the recent attacks in France, I am blown away by the vitriol and hatred people are ascribing to the Muslim population. Frequent cries for mass deportation, calling Muslims savages and so on. Now I know this is Reddit, but in reality(and given the current political situation around the world) a lot of people are this extreme. \n\nSo what's my point? Well my point is that people seem to be so easily influenced by the media, that they are willing to call an entire population of people less than human, for the incidents of terrorism committed by less than a small percentage of the entire population of muslims, and the number of victims of said attacks make up such an even smaller set of the entire population. I find it strange how you're more likely to get killed in a car accident or by heart disease than by terrorism, yet we are willing to change entire political systems based on terrorism. \n\nI don't know, I guess I'm just trying to understand if it is possible for us to move towards a society that's a little more willing to gain some perspective and look at the bigger picture.\n\nAnd also I'm tired of this \"immigration will destroy our civilisation\" shit. I don't buy it. I'm quite conservative, and I do believe in a balanced fairer immigration system, but to act as if some refugees will come into your country and somehow destroy your civilisation from the inside out is ridiculous. \n\nAny thoughts?

I'm wondering if there are other countries where the starting point of discussion takes the bulk of science and rationality as a given.",

From that example I posit my real question: why is waste a bad thing in a capitalist society?\n\nWhat do you think will be the reaction of CEO's of Neimus Marcus, Bloomingdales, and Gucci when they are told that people are throwing away clothes and bags after just one season, and immediatley buying new ones the next season. Do you think they'll go:\"&lt;Gasp&gt;, that is terrible waste! There are kids in Africa who cannot afford clothes!\". \n\nI think you are already laughing at the absurdity of the situation.\n\nOn a bigger scale, do you think American economic policy makers will go \"&lt;Gasp&gt;! Americans are throwing away perfectly good food and clothes and electronics and buying new ones as soon as some latest models and styles and flavors come out! This is a terrible waste and we must tell people to stop consuming so much!\".\n\nI think you are now laughing harder.\n\nLet me ask it another way: how do heck do job growth and GDP growth come from if people lived frugally and cleanly and 'responsibly' ?\n\nDon't be absurd. In today's capitalistic society, wasting stuff is a WONDERFUL thing.",

        "text": "In the vast expanse of the Universe, humans are nothing but a trivial species on a trivial planet living in a trivially small window of existence. In all 12 volumes of the History of the Universe to be published 1 trillion years form now, chances are we won't be deemed important enough to deserve even a footnote in it.\n\nThen, why do we spend so much time worrying about our self-imposed 'rules' like morality, ethics, etc and constrain ourselves for no good reason in our life's pursuit of maximizing wealth and power, which I believe are the only worthy goals from which all other 'good' things derive: health, women, beauty, respect from others, respect for yourself, etc. So you should do whatever it takes to maximize your wealth and power in life, as long as your acts don't \"backfire\". By backfire, I mean precisely three things: \n\n1) ending up in jail, getting capital punished \n\n2) getting severely injured as to lose the ability to maximize wealth and power and enjoy food and sex \n\n3) Losing the trust of an important person whom you need for maximizing your wealth and power.\n\nSo in order to conform to the above 3 'constraints', obviously you need to exercise some prudence and caution and restraint. But beyond that, there's really no limit as to what you can and cannot do in life.\n\nAs for 'feeling bad for yourself' or 'how can you live with yourself', well as long as you don't believe in God or Karma and 'Cosmic justice', which I don't (as there's no evidence supporting it): when you are dead you are dead. Even if there's a 'God', he won't care, the 'Cosmos' won't care, because it may not even be bad in their eyes nor will they so much time on their hands to give a sh*t about it. In the same way I won't pay even an iota of attention to whether an ant tried to kill another ant in some mole hill in Arkansas.\n\nSo, I ask: why not?\n\nP.S.: I would even go so far as to say 99% of successful people live life as described above. Only 1% try to be a 'good man', and I think that's their loss.",
