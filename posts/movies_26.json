Story wise and design wise but with the same art and animation style similar to the new puss in boots and spider-verse. But with Paramount doing that with tmnt and r even working on an animated transformers origin story, I’m very worried that I can’t make my movie without that spider verse style if they do it first. I’ve always wanted to do it but I’m very very worried. What do I do about it so i can still make my transformers movie with that spider verse look and feel",

Bob has now confirmed the film is done and that he attempted to \"nail all of the lines\" as best as he could in the film, this has me both scratching my head and also laughing really hard too\n\nTommy must be cashing in that cheque hard due to the films success and failure of the project. \n\nFirst he made the movie which has become a cult favorite so bad its good film.\n\nThen the disaster artist book and movie is made. \n\nNow a remake. \n\nWhat???",

I saw it for the first time a couple of years back and have watched it a number of times since, and it probably helps I'm a big Pegg fan (from Spaced, to Hot Fuzz &amp; Shaun of the Dead, to Benji in the MI films). Lake Bell is a great actor as well and genuinely nails the English accent (she's American).\n\nIt's just a feel good, actually quite funny cozy Sunday afternoon film, and I'm only slightly ashamed to be admitting this..\n\nSo yeah, what's your 'guilty pleasure'?\n\nOh and another awesome film I can highly recommend (as a romcom) is Instant Family. Absolutely not a guilty pleasure film it's a real breath of fresh air on comparison to other Mark Wahlberg 'comedy' films",

        "text": "Over the years James Cameron has made very subtle edits to a couple of his movies, including Titanic and Terminator 2, but they're almost invisible. \n\nIn the Titanic remaster, they actually fixed the night sky to accurately depict how it looked at the time of the actual event. Super minor change that no one would ever notice. \n\nTerminator 2 however came his biggest changes, and to me they just enhanced an already incredible film. They put a 3d Arnold face over the stunt doubles in a few key action scenes, most notably the giant motorcycle jump early on in the film. Another scene that once featured the camera crew in the background was digitally removed. Subtle changes, nothing major. \n\nI was watching The Curious Case of Benjamin button, and the CGI has not aged particularly well. The big difference tho is that the entirety of the movie features some deaging/aging of some kind, so its not small feat, but its something that totally drives the movie, unfortunately, it kept taking me out of the movie for how jarring it is now. It was fine when it came out. \n\nAre there any movies you think would be deserving of some modern enhancements? and if so for what scenes?\n\nNot to take away from the hard work of the vfx artists who may have done the earlier cgi, just for the sake of the movie. And I don't mean like updating the original Jurassic Park, that movie is perfect as is. \n\nJust movies were a few scenes may not have aged well at all",

I hope I wont get downvoted to Zion for this.\n\nMatrix - The Fall of Zion\n\nThe prequel Matrix movie follows a group of resistance fighters in the time of Matrix movie one, who discover a way to access the memories of the machines and use them to travel back in time to the fall of Zion. The group's mission is to understand where the central power core of the machines is located, which is crucial to their energy supply in the real world, as well as to maintain the matrix.\n\nAs they journey through the memories of the machines, they witness the events that led to the fall of Zion and the rise of the machines. Along the way, they encounter various obstacles, including rogue agents and other machines programmed to stop them.\n\nAs the group delves deeper into the memories, they uncover shocking secrets about the making of the matrix.\n\nThe film concludes with the group successfully locating the power core and devising a plan to destroy it, which they hope will weaken the machines' hold on humanity. The group then returns to the present time, armed with the knowledge they have gained, and prepares for the next stage of their battle against the machines.",
