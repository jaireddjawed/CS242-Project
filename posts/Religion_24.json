My mom and dad were Christian and my grandmother (lived with us most of my life) was Jewish and we celebrated the holidays of both religions. My grandmother went to services and I was always welcome but never pressured to come. My parents did the same with church but not as often. I was always encouraged to learn about other religions and cultures and lifestyles while I was being brought up. I ended up converting to judaism and I am very proud of it and happy with my choice, but I don’t think I want to raise my kids religiously. \n\nI love that I was given the opportunity to learn and experience different religious beliefs and lifestyles and I would like to do the same for my children. I’ll still celebrate my holidays and observe what I choose but I don’t want to push it on my kids. My mom thinks it’s strange and that I should guide them in a certain direction and obviously I’ll give them guidance to the best of my ability when it comes to religion but I don’t want to force anything on them. \n\nAnyone who was or wasn’t raised religiously want to share your perspective? I know some of my friends who weren’t wished they had something to believe in and some that were don’t believe at all now so it seems like it could go either way. Just wondering if it would be the wrong choice to raise them how I was in the religious sense.",

        "text": "Surely God is absolutely just and He wants us to live in peace &amp; harmony on earth as it is in heaven?\n\n In a world in which billions of people adhere to religious orders supposedly based on divine laws, how is it possible there is virtually zero peace &amp; justice?\n\nIn the western secular world despite remarkable advances in technology &amp; communications how are people becoming increasingly isolated and rates of psychological disorders soaring? \n\nThe unnecessary burden on social services is huge at a time when most people are locked in a cycle of debt servitude over a place to live. Does it seem fair that the same hard work you do from one day to the next no longer buys you the same amount of bread?  \n\nDespite both parents working round the clock, there is barely ever enough money to make ends meet, and to provide the basic needs for our children. By the end of the day is there really any time left to spend quality time with our children? \n\nDo you recall that the bank notes you use everyday as legal tender state ‘I promise to pay the bearer on demand….’ actually have zero value and are printed without any link to a standard reserve. If everybody wanted to reclaim their assets at the same time there would be insufficient funds. Do we realise that every time we take out a loan we are paying back extra for our labour on funds that don’t even exist in the bank vaults? The bank can therefore decide to print money to create a free windfall with zero risk. Or on the flipside by restricting the flow of currency in the market to create a recession. In a domino effect when businesses struggle and living wages are cut people are forced to defer on house payments and families are strained to breaking point. \n\nWhile all this is going on behind the scenes we are forced into paying taxes to support military campaigns in countries to dismantle governments in nations whose people have done us no harm.  Who are usually the victims of such attacks other than the vulnerable poor and elderly? Whilst back home services for health, roads and education face regular cut backs. \n\nEven more shocking to us, is that we have been deceived into electing leaders in a so-called ‘Democracy’ with their manifesto promising to do the opposite and restore order and justice to our lives. Throughout the ages there has been an ever growing gap between rich and poor. With the mega rich Bezos, Buffet and Musk holding much of the purse strings, if 3 people did the same in your village preventing life saving medication from reaching dying children would you not demand intervention?  \n\nHistory is surely there to teach us lessons. If the system of rule in past nations such as Rome &amp; Greece democratic at their core, which grew to such an excess of liberty and abandonment of inhibitions before their demise, how would we expect anything different today? \n\nMarcus Cicero, a famous Roman statesman, willingly spoke out against rulers  eloquent in thier rhetoric about righteous conduct but failing to apply it in essence. He declared, ‘*There is no greater philosophy than the discovery of what our duties are to one another, to our communities, and to our God.*\n\nCicero recognised that the supreme goodness was in doing the right thing for the better of the community not in seeking pleasures for our own ends,’ *For he who posits the supreme good as having no connection with virtue and measures it not by a moral standard but by his own interests…….he could value neither friendship nor justice nor generosity; and brave he surely cannot possibly be that counts pain the supreme evil, nor temperate he that holds pleasure to be the supreme good.*\n\nIf as Aristotle said,  ‘Man is by nature a political animal’ how can we remain apathetic to this injustice to ourselves and our communities?\n\n ‘**No democracy can exist unless each of its citizens is as capable of outrage at injustice to another as he is of outrage at injustice to himself.’**\n\nPlato warned us that Democracy passes into despotism.\n\nHow can we forget Plato’s democratic analogy of the shipowner which represents the general populace, having no seafaring knowledge. The sailors are the politicians who vie for our favours, whilst the only man fit for the job of navigation known as ‘the philosopher king’ is left completely out of the picture. So what happens then when the storm rages and the boat begins to list?\n\nThe trouble is it seems people on the whole still want the sweetshop owner who offers seductive &amp; tantalising but short lived flavours, rather than the doctor with bitter but lasting wholesome remedies.\n\nOtherwise are we not destined to be ruled by the likes of Nero, who would willingly burn down his city to put an end to the revolt of the suppressed Christians and then use the people’s taxes to build ostentatious palaces to create his personal material legacy.\n\nLest we NOT forget that throughout history many wise men have come to teach us there is another way and it is not oligarchy, aristocracy, anarchy, facism, socialism, communism as in reality they are all schism. \n\nWere not the Jews expecting the promise of a messianic figure to rule as a King in the name of Jesus? Or in the Orient, Lao Tzu, who talked about a just leader who has a ‘Mandate from heaven’.  Whilst even former Kings of Europe spoke of ‘a divine right of kings’ men chosen by God because they had the only necessary abilities to manage the affairs of the people both religious and political.  What was the punishment for godly men who tried to claim their righteous position in previous generations? What was the end for Socrates who proposed this platonic system of just governance? Lest we make the same mistakes again?\n\n​​*Until philosophers are kings, …. cities will never have rest from their evils,—nor the human race, as I believe,—and then only will this our State have a possibility of life and behold the light of day.*” Plato, Republic Book 5\n\nSo logically if God is just he must have sent somebody for our time, so how can we find ‘The philosopher king’ of our age and a way out of the wilderness we find ourselves today? \n\nBecause surely if we tolerate the current status quo then can we truly expect any change in the future? \n\n “Tolerance and **apathy** are the **last** virtues of a **dying** society” Aristotle\n\nTherefore if we tolerate this then surely our children will be next……\n\nIt was when I found this book mentioning a  ‘Philosopher King’ Abullah Hashem in the Goal of the Wise that I began to think this could be a way out of the  labyrinth we find ourselves in today…….\n\n[https://theahmadireligion.org/goalofthewise/](https://theahmadireligion.org/goalofthewise/)",

        "text": "Hi everyone. Let me start this off by saying that I’m a nondenominational Christian. I attend church weekly, live in the US, and overall I have a happy life with a good job and live comfortably. \n\nRecently I took an interest in a YouTube channel called Indigo Traveller, I highly suggest watching. Basically the host travels to a bunch of countries that most of us wouldn’t and shows the living conditions, crime, monuments, etc. very, very interesting. \n\nMost recently I watched his series on Haiti and I was shocked. I knew it was bad, but until you see it like he presents I don’t think you can really grasp it. I didn’t see one building there that didn’t look like it would withstand a strong wind. Poverty everywhere. No fuel, no food, constant anarchy. This leads me to my question. \n\nWhy? Why is my life and living situation good, and so many other places are so bad? Haiti, Yemen, Iran just to name a few. Now make no mistake, I’m not trying to look at this with a socialist point of view or some sort of “handouts” point of view. Everything I have, I worked for. My home, job, cars, family, etc. However, being raised in the US, I had opportunity. There’s always access to food and shelter (I get not everyone in the US has this, but just to make my point), and in other countries it’s hardly safe to walk outside without being killed, arrested or kidnapped. \n\nI guess I just don’t understand why, if god loves everyone equal and died for all of our sins, he allows some people to live in perfectly good countries where you can build a life for yourself and have access to basic needs, within reason, and why he lets others live in counties like Haiti or Yemen where the people have little to no control over how bad things are.",

        "text": "There are theories like the Mandela effect and string theory that talk about multiple universes, merging, etc so maybe this is a part of it or it could also be its own thing. What if each religion and spirituality is actually true and canon? Each religion is more like a state of being or a species rather than just a belief system. the properties of all religions and spirituality exist simultaneously due to either a law we haven't discovered yet or a merging of some sort along with expansive evidence and/or factors similar to the last Thursday theory.\n\n For example: God is real, Jesus and all of the evidence of Jesus are in fact real, and God made what God made, Omphalos hypothesis is real. Now it's merged to people made by evolution in the same realm or they were made in a different coexisting realm, and they don't have this connection to God and they're not affiliated with these powers or that fate, they're not going to see spirits or interact. the same with those who follow Buddha, same realm or coexisting realm full of evolved beings or embodied spirits who are driven by spirit, are wired to seek enlightenment and are part of a karma system That, just like God, is invisible or inaccessible to those who don't exist within the system.\n\nIt could explain why so many people are inclined to God and function by Christianity and sometimes even interact with God, for example, how people can be highly affected by karma and faith or are more vulnerable to energy, while other people are just living carefree or otherwise having horrible luck no matter What. It could be why there are so many different interpretations of life and death and after life, why some people can see spirits and some people cannot, why some people can otherwise experience things that others don't, how two people could have the same experiences in life yet have drastically different abilities and beliefs, How a person could be so sure of an experience that nobody else can relate to or many people can swear to an experience besides for one person. I think it can also explain why some people can be part of the system and believe in the experience the effects but then the people who are scared of ghosts Or are otherwise fascinated by them and are open to the experiences but never actually experience anything, how many people convert to a religion such as Christianity And try to communicate with God but never experience it no matter how hard they try.  some people can convert successfully or even convert unintentionally, due to merging and mixing but don't you notice a shift, something just isn't the same? \n\n And it could go for anything. For example, Wiccan, a majority of cases can be explained away by science or fiction but what about the things that can't be explained? There are so many unsolved mysteries out there whether personal or even federal where it's just baffling and unbelievable, there are disputes that we can never truly get through, so what if everyone's interpretation is true... what if there's some system that hasn't made itself known? \n\nSomething I'll never find out is: Why is it merged? Was it a shift in the universe, a collapse of the universe, or is there an external force doing the merging itself or causing a refuge like situation?",

        "text": "Benedict XVI died yesterday as everyone knows. In addition to being a former Pope and Cardinal he was also a major theologian, scholar and intellectual. Something recognised not just in the Catholic Church, but in the Christian world broadly and even beyond that. As a non-Catholic myself(Anglican) I changed my views on him through my encounter with his writings. Even though I don't agree with him on everything he was still an intellectual who's perspective gives food for thought. So here are a series of quotes from him:\n\n\"*Christian faith in God means first the decision in favor of the primacy of the logos as against mere matter. Saying 'I believe that God exists' also implies opting for the view that the logos-that is the idea, freedom, love-stands not merely at the end but also at the beginning, that it is the originating and encompassing power of all being. In other words, faith means deciding for the view that thought and meaning do not just form a chance by-product of being; that on the contrary, all being is a product of thought and indeed in its innermost structure is itself thought*\"(Introduction to Christianity, pg 151-152)\n\n\"*If on the one hand the believe can perfect his faith only on the ocean of nihilism, temptation, and doubt, if he has been assigned the ocean of uncertainty as the only possible site for his faith, on the other, the unbeliever is not to be understood undialectically as a mere man without faith. Just as we have already recognised that the believe does not live immune to doubt but is always threatened by the plunge into the void, so we can discern the entangled nature of human destinies and say that the nonbeliever does not lead a sealed off, self sufficient life either...Just as the believer is choked by the salt water of doubt constantly washed into his mouth by the ocean of uncertainty, so the non believer is troubled by doubts about his unbelief, about the real totality of the world he has made up his mind to explain as a self contained whole...In short there is no escape from the dilemma of being a man*.\"(Introduction to Christianity, pg 44-45)\n\n\"*If in the dialogic structure of faith an image of man is thus defined, we can add that it also brings to light an image of God. Man comes to deal with God in coming to deal with his fellowmen. Faith is fundamentally centered on 'You' and 'We'; only via this double clamp does it link man with God. The corollary of this is that by the inner structure of faith our relationship to God and our fellowship with man cannot be separated from each other; the relationship to God, to the 'You' and to the 'We' are intertwined; they do not stand alongside each other. The same thing could be formulated from a different point of view by saying that God wishes to approach man only through man; he seeks out man in no other way but in his fellow humanity*\"(Introduction to Christianity, pg 93-94)\n\n\"*The Cross is revelation. It reveals, not any particular thing, but God and man. It reveals who God is and in what way man is. There is a curious presentiment of this situation in Greek philosophy: Plato's image of the crucified 'just man'. In the Republic the great philosopher asks what is likely to be the position of a completely just man in this world. He comes to the conclusion that a man's righteousness is only complete and guaranteed when he takes on the appearance of unrighteousness, for only then is it clear that he does not follow the opinion of men, but pursues justice only for its own sake....the truly just man must be misunderstood and persecuted in the world; indeed Plato goes as far as to write: 'They will say that our just man will be scourged, racked, fettered, will have his eyes burned out, and at least, after all manner of suffering will be crucified....The fact that when the perfectly just man appeared he was crucified, delivered up by justice to death, tells us pitilessly who man is: Thou are such man, that thou \\[can't bear\\] the just man-that he who simply loves becomes a fool, a scourged criminal, an outcast. Thou art such because, unjust thyself, thou...always needs the injustice of the next man in order to feel excused and thus cannot tolerate the just man who seems to rob thee of this excuse. Such are thou. St John summarised all this in the Ecce Homo(Look this is the Man) of Pilate, which means quite fundamentally: This is how it is with man..this is man. The truth of man is his complete lack of truth. The saying in the Psalms that every man is a liar and lives in some way or other against the truth already reveals how it really is with man. The truth about man is that he is continually assailing truth; the just man crucified is thus a mirror held up in which he sees himself unadorned*\"(Introduction to Christianity, pg 292-293)\n\n\"*Inquiry about God is not the forlorn effort of the obsolete world that is trying to keep itself alive after its time has run out, but the most necessary thorn in the flesh of our minds, forcing us constantly to search for ourselves and to expose ourselves to the full responsibility of being human, a responsibility that cannot be reduced to the language of calculus. The triumphantly sober sentence with which Wittgenstein concludes his Tractus Logico philosophicus: 'What we cannot speak about we must consign to silence' is only apparently logical. The logos, the intellect of man reaches farther than formal logic. Man simply has to speak about the inexpressible if he would speak about himself. He must reflect precisely on the incalculable if his thinking is to touch the sphere of the truly human*\"(Faith and the Future, pg 81)\n\n\"*Very different from ours was the way in which Abraham's faith expressed itself....What was that faith like? To the modern reader of the Bible, it appears fairly prosaic. Abraham knew that he enjoyed a promise that gave him the prospect of posterity and a country-the two things that were most desirable to men of those times because they assured a future, wealth, and security....But it may repay us to take note of what really happened to the man who was committing himself in this way. He gave up the present for the sake of what was to come. He let go of what was safe, comprehensible, calculable, for the sake of what was unknown. And he did this in response to a single word from God. He had met God and placed all his future in God's hands; he dared to accept a new future that began in darkness. The word he had heard was more real to him than all the calculable things he could hold in his hand. He trusted in that which he could not yet see and thus became capable of new life, of breaking out of rigidity. The center of gravity of reality, indeed the concept of reality itself, changed. The future took precedence over the present, the word heard over comprehensible things. God had become more important to him than he himself and than the things he could understand. Imprisonment within the calculable and among the goods which a man surrounds himself was broken, and a new, limitless horizon opened up: a horizon towards the Eternal, toward the Creator*\"(Faith and the Future, pg 38-41)\n\n\"*Matthew and Luke recount three temptations of Jesus that reflect the inner struggle over his own particular mission and, at the same time, address the question as to what truly matters in human life. At the heart of all temptations as we see here, is the act of pushing God aside because we perceive him as secondary, if not actually superfluous and annoying, in comparison with all the apparently far more urgent matters that fill our lives. Constructing a world by our own lights, without reference to God, building on our own foundation; refusing to acknowledge the reality of anything beyond the political and material, while setting God aside as an illusion-that is the temptation that threatens us in many varied forms. Moral posturing is part and parcel of temptation. It does not invite us directly to do evil-no that would be far to blatant. It pretends to show us a better way, where we finally abandon our illusions and throw ourselves into the work of actually making the world a better place. It claims, moreover, to speak for true realism. What's real is right there in front of us, power and bread*\"(Jesus of Nazareth: From the Baptism in the Jordan to the Transfiguration, pg 28)\n\n\"*There are two \\[great\\] narratives concerning bread in Jesus's life. The first is the multiplication of loaves for the thousands who followed the Lord when he withdrew to a lonely place. Why does Christ now do the very thing he had rejected as temptation before? The crowds had left everything in order to come hear God's word. They are people who have opened their hearts to God and to one another; they are therefore ready to receive the bread with the proper disposition. This miracle of the loaves has three aspects then. It is preceded by a the search for God, for his word, for the teaching that sets the whole of life on the right path. Furthermore, God is asked to supply the bread. Finally readiness to share with one another is an essential element of the miracle. Listening to God becomes living with God, and leads from faith to live, to the discovery of the other. Jesus is not indifferent towards men's hunger, their bodily needs, but he places these things in the proper context and the proper order....This gives us the background we need if we are to understand what Jesus means when he cites the Old Testament in order to repel the tempter: 'Man does not live by bread alone, but....by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord'(Deut 8:3).....Bread is important, freedom is more important, but most important of all is unbroken fidelity and faithful adoration*\"(Jesus of Nazareth: From the Baptism in the Jordan to the Transfiguration, pg 32-33)\n\n\"*To exorcise the world, to establish it in the light of the reason that comes from the eternal creative reason and its saving goodness and refers back to it-that is the permanent, central task of the messengers of Jesus Christ*\"(Jesus of Nazareth: From the Baptism in the Jordan to the Transfirguration, pg 174)\n\n\"*In the just man exposed to suffering, the memory of the disciples recognised Jesus: zeal for God's house leads him to the Passion, to the Cross. This is the fundamental transformation that Jesus brought to the theme of zeal-zelos. The 'zeal' that would serve God through violence he transformed into the zeal of the Cross. Thus he definitively established the criterion for true zeal-the zeal of self giving love. This zeal must become the Christian's goal*\"(Jesus of Nazareth: Holy Week: From the Entrance into Jerusalem to the Resurrection, pg 22)\n\n\"*At the beginning of the crucifixion Jesus was offered the customary anaesthetizing drink to deaden the unbearable pain. Jesus declined to drink it-he wanted to endure his suffering consciously. At the climax of the Passion under the burning midday sun, stretched out on the Cross Jesus called out 'I thirst'(Jn 19:28). According to custom, he was offered sour wine, which was commonly found among the poor and could also be described as vinegar: it was considered thirst-quenching.....we hear a direct echo of the 'Passion Psalm' 69 in which the victim laments 'for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink'. Jesus is the just man exposed to suffering. The Passion of the just, as presented in scripture through the great experiences of praying is fulfilled in him. This scene can hardly fail to remind us also of the song of the vineyard....of the Prophet Isaiah. Here God brings his lament before Israel. He had planted a vineyard on a fruitful height and had taken every possible care over it. 'He looked for it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes(Is 5:2). The vineyard of Israel fails to yield for God the noble fruit of justice, which is grounded in love. It yields the sour grapes of man, who is concerned only for himself. It yields vinegar instead of wine. God's lament, which we hear in the song of the Prophet, is brought to fulfillment as the vinegar is proffered to the thirsting Savior. Just as Isaiah's song portrays God's suffering over his people in a way that far transcends the historical moment, so too the scene at the Cross far transcends the hour of Jesus's death. It is not only Israel, but the Church, it is we ourselves who repeatedly respond to God's bountiful love with vinegar-with a sour heart that is unable to perceive God's love. 'I thirst': this cry of Jesus is addressed to every single one of us*\"(Jesus of Nazareth: Holy Week: From the Entrance into Jerusalem to the Resurrection, pg 217-219)\n\n\"*The one God in whom Israel believes...loves with a personal love. His love, moreover is an elective love: among all the nations he chooses Israel and loves her-but he does so precisely with a view to healing the whole human race. God loves and his love may certain be called eros\\[(passionate love)\\], yet it is also totally agape\\[(self giving love)\\]. The prophets, particularly Hosea and Ezekiel, described God's passion for his people using boldly erotic images. God's relationship with Israel is described using metaphors of betrothal and marriage; idolatry is thus adultery and prostitution. Here we find a specific reference-as we have seen-to the fertility cults and their abuse of eros, but also a description of the relationship between fidelity between Israel and her God. The history of the love-relationship between God and Israel consists, at the deepest level, in the fact that he gives her the Torah, thereby opening Israel's eyes to man's true nature and showing her the path leading to true humanism. It consists in the fact that man, through a life of fidelity to one God, comes to experience himself as loved by God, and discovers joy in truth and in righteousness*\"(Deus Caritas Est, prg 9)\n\n\"*The ancient world had dimly perceived that man's real food-what truly nourishes him as man-is ultimately the Logos, eternal wisdom: this Logos now truly becomes food for us, as love. The Eucharist draws us into Jesus's act of self-oblation. More than just statically receiving the incarnate Logos, we enter into the very dynamic of his self giving. The imagery of marriage between God and Israel is now realized in a way previously inconceivable: it had meant standing in Gods' presence, but now it becomes union with God*\"(Deus Caritas Est, prg 13)\n\n\"*Paul reminds the Ephesians that before their encounter with Christ they were 'without hope and without God in the world'(Eph 2:12). Of course he know they had had gods...Not withstanding their gods, they were 'without God' and consequently found themselves in a dark world, facing a dark future. 'How quickly we fall back from nothing to nothing': so says an epitaph of that period. Here...we see as a distinguishing mark of Christians the fact that they have a future: it is not that they know in general terms that their life will not end in emptiness. Only when the future is certain as a positive reality does it become possible to live the present as well. So now we can say: Christianity was not only 'good new'-the communication of a hitherto unknown content. In our language we would say: the Christian message was not only 'informative' but 'performative;. That means: the Gospel is not merely a communication of things that can be known-it is one that makes things happen and is life-changing. That dark door of time, of the future, has been thrown open. The one who has hope lives different; the one who hopes has been granted the gift of new life*\"(Spe Salvi, prg 2)\n\n\"*In the twentieth century Theodor W. Adorno formulated the problem of faith in progress quite drastically: he said that progress, seen accurately, is progress from the sling to the atom bomb. Now this is certainly an aspect of progress that must not be concealed. To put it another way: the ambiguity of progress becomes evident. Without doubt, it offers new possibilities for good, but it also opens up appalling possibilities for evil-possibilities that formerly did not exist. We have all witnessed the way in which progress, in the wrong hands, can become and has indeed become a terrifying progress in evil. If technical progress is not matched by corresponding progress in man's ethical formation, in man's inner growth(Eph 3:16, 2 Cor 4:16) then it is not progress at all, but a threat for man and for the world*\"(Spe Salvi, prg 22)\n\n\"*Faith is not merely a personal reaching out towards things to come that are still totally absent: it gives us something. It gives us even now something of the reality we are waiting for, and this present reality constitutes for us a 'proof' of the things that are still unseen. Faith draws the future into the present, so that it is no longer simply a 'not yet'. The fact that this future exists changes the present; the present is touched by the future reality, and thus the things of the future spill over into those of the present and those of the present into those of the future*\"(Spe Salvi, prg 7)\n\n\"*Only in truth does charity(love) shine forth, only in truth can charity(love) be authentically lived. Truth is the light that gives meaning and value to charity. That light is both the light of reason and the light of faith, through which the intellect attains to the natural and supernatural truth of love: it grasps its meaning as gift, acceptance and communion. Without truth love degenerates into sentimentality. Love becomes an empty shell, to be filled in an arbitrary way. In a culture without truth, this is the fatal risk facing love. It falls prey to contingent subjective emotions and opinions, the word 'love; is abused and distorted, to the point where it comes to mean the opposite. Truth frees love from the constraints of an emotionalism that deprives it of human and universal breathing-space. In the truth, charity reflects the personal yet public dimension of faith in the God of the Bible, who is both Agape and Logos. Charity and Truth, Love and Word*\"(Caritas In Veritate, prg 3)\n\n\"*Justice is the primary way of charity or, in Paul VI's words 'the minimum measure; of it, an integral part of the love 'in deed and in truth'(1 Jn 3:18) to which Saint John exhorts us. On the one hand charity demands justice: recognition and respect for the legitimate rights of individuals and peoples. It strives to build the earthly city according to law and justice. On the other hand charity transcends justice and completes it in the logic of giving and forgiving. The earthly city is promoted not merely by relationships of rights and duties, but to an even greater and more fundamental extent by relationships of gratuitousness, mercy and communion. Charity always manifests God's love in human relationships as well, it gives theological and salvific value to all commitment for justice in the world*\"(Caritas In Veritate, prg 6)",

I wish i didn't know but I've been through enough to know that when someone is preaching you to act like a saint with them while acting the complete opposite, it results in oppression of the worse kind. The kind that claims your soul. And who would do such a thing only a beast. The book of revelation was revealed to john and is genuine unlike the revelations to paul. It is said there that the false prophet will deceive the nations into worshipping the beast and persecuting the saints. What do you think happens when someone turned the other cheek a little bit too much, to someone who they innocently didn't believe they should distrust, suffer abuse and become mentally ill? Who ends up suffering? The victimiser who exploited the person? Or the person's family or whoever loves them the most genuinely? Who ends up forgiven for every low thing and who ends up dying of sorrow? Paul said \"rejoice in the truth and not in the injustice\". So there was and is no injustice, right? Non. - that is not the real truth though, that is gaslighting. The truth is that the truth is hard to swallow.",

        "text": "I was raised in a conservative Catholic family, so I was taught that God is good and faith and worship will get one rewarded in afterlife.\n\nI've always been leaning more towards Jude than Christianity, mostly because I didn't feel right with the Church being an institution.\n\nHowever, during the Sacrament of Confirmation I was gifted the Holy Bible, so I decided to read it. And that's when I figured out that Abrahamic religions are simply not for me. It just didn't feel right to me.\n\nI started to research different religions. At first I was strongly drawn into Native American religions, until I learned about Native European ones. I attended some Ásatrú rituals in Iceland, but eventually figured out I'm more into Celtic paganism rather than Norse.\n\nI was forced to travel a lot in my life, and to make peace with many cultures and groups, including right-wing extremists and left-wing extremists. My experiences made me establish my own views, and I ended up being pretty much egotheist. I still worship Celtic deities and visit the sacred sites and treat them with the proper respect, but I treat the Gods as equal to me, that they gained their power through great deeds and I should also do great deeds to attain such power.",

        "text": "Just a disclaimer- I don't mean to insult anyone or their faith.\n\n\n\n\nI grew up a Hindu, and I converted to agnosticism at about 12. I didn't know it was a massive group, or even its name, but I gained its belief.\n\n\n\n I don't know if I have the exact belief of an agnostic, I've never met one. I come from a very religiously homogenous country, that is 79.8% Hindu. I'm sure you can guess which. That's the reason I don't know much about agnosticism. Maybe I don't qualify to be one, maybe only scientists can be agnostic. I don't know.\n\n\n\n I believe that there may or may not be a greater power, but if there is, us humans are incapable of understanding its nature, unable to say its name and unable to visualise its appearance. I am inclined towards thinking a greater power exists, but I have no way to be sure, so I don't express my opinions on it. I got this belief, as when I started growing up, I started seeing the unlimited number of holes in Hinduism as we follow it today.\n\n\n\n There is historic proof, that it was bent beyond recognition by corrupt and greedy priests. (I don't mean to offend anyone that is Hindu, just to be clear, I found that having a God to believe in is comforting in trying times before I became agnostic)\n\n\n\n Then, I began to look at other religions, and began to understand the true intentions of religion. To keep people in line. With context of what we know now for a fact about the universe and our existence, I believe the religions tried to build themselves on the scientific knowledge of the time they were created to gain credibility, and used that credibility to preach their morals. Parents of the time made stories to explain the values to their children, bada-bing bada-boom you have a mythology. Also, most religions encourage their followers to fear the god, and say that a person's afterlife is either great or horrible, based on how well they followed the religion. That's proof enough for me of my claim that the point of religion was to keep people in line.\n\n\n\nLooking at all this, I took a step back and thought, that in our infinite universe, would a creator that created such vastly different planets spread very far out really care about us? Or would they have made us the same as them? I don't think so. Even if each planet had its own creating power, which I really doubt, my point about them making us the same as them stands. Also, would a creator that created the natural system of kill or be killed care about us? I doubt it.\n\n\n\nYou'd think thoughts like that would depress me, and they did in the early stages of my dealing with the new faith I discovered, but then it just didn't anymore. I don't like to think about why, since if there is no reason, I'm afraid I'd become depressed again. Maybe not, since it wasn't the only reason for my sadness that age (I don't wanna say I was depressed, it wasn't *that* horrible), maybe it was my bad social skills at a young age catching up to me more so than my faith.\n\n\n\n\nIf what I'm saying isn't agnostic belief, or if I can't be an agnostic (aspiring author and filmmaker, not a scientist), please tell me. I really want to know. And to everyone that supports me, thanks so much. I've been a redditor for a few months now, and I didn't think to put this on here. Any advice on how to deal with this as someone still living with his family (social norm in my country) would be greatly appreciated.",

I see people doing these all the time for their religions and they seem to be great for making conversations and gaining new perspectives. \n\nI do not belong to a single religion. I believe that all religions offer some truths and different perspectives. \n\nHere's a summary of my beliefs. \n\nI believe that God is the source of all existence. \n\nI believe that we are all individuals within the collective consciousness, but I do not believe the collective consciousness is God. \n\nI believe that Jesus is the Davidic Messiah, but I do not believe that Jesus is God. \n\nI believe that other entities exist that some people call god or gods, who could be technologically advanced, interdimensional beings, or something else altogether. \n\nI follow the 10 Commandments - I believe that they were given to us to simplify things, but since we are humans, we have overcomplicated them and have allowed personal biases to be exerted through religion. \n\nI believe that most of our religious disagreements come down to personal biases and semantics… \n\nI believe that we would be better off by looking towards our similarities and finding common ground, versus fighting over differences. \n\nI believe that we live multiple lives to gain the perspective needed for \"Heaven\" to exist. \n\nI am not starting a cult or a new religion. \n\nI do not claim to have all the answers (I would advise to be wary of anyone who does), I personally think it's best to go straight to the source, but will do my best to engage and provide my perspective for any questions.",
