Accomplishing this mission should not come at the expense of reducing standards, like eliminating the MCAT. Studies have shown that the MCAT is NOT a racist exam. To say that Black and Hispanic people cannot do well on the MCAT is such a racist thing to say, and I have no idea why people peddle this argument. I would hate the fact that people think I am incapable of doing well on it. \n\nI have worked with students and kids in the past, and there is nothing worse than expecting low standards from someone. When you tell people they are only worth so much or can only achieve so much, they WILL believe it. It's internalized immediately. Black and Hispanic people are in no way academically less capable than white or Asian students. Why are we assuming that they are? \n\ncitations: https://journals.lww.com/academicmedicine/fulltext/2013/05000/do_racial_and_ethnic_group_differences_in.19.aspx",

Without giving too much info, the patient is delusional, has very poor insight, and is refusing to take ANY medications, including their antipsychotics, for various reasons related to their delusions. The patient also really wants to be discharged (but they're on a psych hold).\n\nClearly, I can't lie or play into the patient's delusions. I don't want to just tell the patient their delusions are false because I might lose their trust. I also don't want to ignore the patient's concerns though.\n\nSo my plan is to acknowledge the patient's concerns \"I see... that sounds very scary/difficult for you... etc\". Then I will kinda barter with the patient by saying something like \"Unfortunately we can't let you go until you start to get better. And I believe that these medications will improve your condition so we can let you leave sooner\"\n\nDoes that sound like a good plan? Any advice for how to talk to this patient? How should I respond if they accuse me of trying to poison them or something? I would appreciate specific phrases or questions to impress my attending lol",

I just can't find the time to work on these projects now that Step studying is in full swing. I'm sure I'm a disappointment to my mentors - all of them are nice and haven't rushed me or looked for constant updates in my progress, but I feel so bad for not delivering like I promised. I look at all my classmates going to conferences and publishing left and right, and I wonder if I'm just not cut out for this.\n\nI was gunning for a very competitive specialty but I'm not even sure if I want it anymore - could I do something else that could make me just as happy without me needing to push it in the research rat race? I'm honestly so unhappy day-to-day because of everything I know I need to do but don't have time to do - if this specialty brings me no joy, is it even worth chasing?\n\nI'm so sorry for all the negativity - I just feel like I'm truly lost.

Through. \n\nI really have a passion for this thing, I wanted to live and die doing this, but for the very first time I feel so done, she is rude for the sake of being rude, dry and generally unpleasant, pimps me all the time and I just get the feeling she just doesn't want to be there, and I feel like I'm doing something wrong, but I don't want that so I need help what do I do?\n\nI've tried to ignore it and be pleasant despite everything, I tried studying hard to know all the answers to the pimp questions, I tried being super early, ir always on time, I tried speaking a lot, not speaking so much, and even not speaking at all just shaking and nodding...\n\nI know it may sound menial, maybe it does, maybe it even is, but it's really bothering me It feels like I'm stupid or doing somethingdeeply wrong, it's not like it's just me but it feels harsher you know?",

        "text": "7:00 am: Alarm goes off telling me to wake up. I don‚Äôt. I set my next alarm for 7:30 and snuggle back into my covers. \n\n7:30 am: Second alarm goes off. I tell myself ten extra minutes will be fine as long as I skip my lengthy skincare routine. I go back to sleep. \n\n7:40 am: Third alarm goes off. I wake up. \n\n7:50 am: I actually get out of bed once I finish scrolling through pasta recipes on the gram. \n\n8:00 am: I do that lengthy skincare routine I told myself I wouldn‚Äôt do. I‚Äôm fucking glowing baby. \n\n8:30 am: I was supposed to be at the hospital by 8:30 but it‚Äôs already 8:30 so I send a mobile order to Starbucks. Grande iced brown sugar shaken espresso and a bacon gouda sandwich. If I‚Äôm gonna be late might as well be hella late. \n\n9:00 am: Arrive to hospital and print out the patient list. I ask the third year if there‚Äôs any new admits. They say yes. I tell them I forgot my stethoscope so I‚Äôll join them for the new patients and help with the HPI if needed. \n\n9:02 am: Steal paper out of the nursing station‚Äôs printer because I haven‚Äôt brought my notebook since November of 2021. I also find a dusty planet fitness pen missing it‚Äôs cap behind the printer. It still writes tho. I steal it. \n\n9:25 am: New patients are seen. \n\n9:30 am: We begin rounding with the attending. Today we‚Äôre with the young and chill attending that‚Äôs fresh out of fellowship with the shredded biceps. I already know it‚Äôs going to be a good day. \n\n9:34 am: Attending asks me what‚Äôs on my differential for this 54 y.o. patient with history of alcohol abuse, tobacco use, obesity, and uncontrolled diabetes that‚Äôs experiencing decreased sensation in their legs. I blank out because I haven‚Äôt been asked a real question since before my audition rotations. I blurt out B12 deficiency and nothing else. Attending stares then turns to the third year for other supporting answers. \n\n9:40 am: I fill in every ‚ÄúO‚Äù and ‚Äú0‚Äù on my list with the planet fitness pen because it writes so smoothly and satisfyingly. Attending thinks I‚Äôm taking notes during rounds. \n\n10:35 am: Rounding ends. Attending spends the next ten minutes rubbing his biceps and telling us about his latest financial investments. States how you can never become rich from just being a doctor, only comfortable. We agree NFTs are for suckers. And that Hokas shit on Ultraboosts. Third year doesn‚Äôt say a word this entire time because they‚Äôre scared to clown with the attending. \n\n10:50 am: We go back and sit at the empty nurses station. I offer to do all the new patient notes so we can finish faster. \n\n11:06 am: I go on my phone and open Reddit to read the latest neurotic posts on r/Residencymatch2023. \n\n11:07 am: Third year asks me for help on how to set up their elective rotations. I say ‚ÄúVSLO is such a mess dude I swear I don‚Äôt even remember.‚Äù \n\n11:08 am: Third year asks me for advice on what resources they should buy for Step 2 and if they should do Sketchy again along with buying the First Aid Step 2 book. I respond ‚ÄúNah you‚Äôre doing too much. Just get UWorld and finish the question bank.‚Äù\n\n11:09 am: I‚Äôm mentally drained from this mornings grueling work. Famished. Exhausted. Parched. I ask the third year if we should go ask the attending what else we can help with in the hopes of getting dismissed. They say uhh let‚Äôs wait till after lunch then ask. \n\n11:10 am: I walk over to the attending‚Äôs office and ask him if he needs anymore help with notes or other tasks. He says no and to head home for the day. I go back and tell the third year. He looks at me like I‚Äôm a Greek God when I say we can go home. \n\n11:11 am: I hide the crusty planet fitness pen back behind the printer so I can use it again tomorrow. I recycle the paper I stole from the nurses‚Äô printer drawer because I didn‚Äôt write down a single thing on it. \n\n11:15 am: I go to the Starbucks in the hospital and cop myself another bacon gouda sandwich for the drive home. \n\n12:00 pm: Arrive back home. At this point I am drained and overworked. Immediately head upstairs to bed. I nap for three hours.",

I can't hear heart sounds on myself at all after trying for hours over multiple days, even though I can feel my apical impulse. I haven't noticed being hard of hearing before, but I know I have intermittent tinnitus and I spent probably 10 years of my life going to super loud punk shows without ear plugs (oops).\n\nI have a Littman Cardiology IV (school-provided). I can hear the diaphragm while scratching it very lightly with my finger. I've tried changing to the smaller ear plug size with no difference. I tried blowing through one ear piece with the other closed to make sure the diaphragm is in tact. I tried squeezing the ear tubes together with the other hand to get a tighter fit in my ears, but that just made me start hearing a pulsing tinnitus in my right ear with no change in the left ear.\n\nAny thoughts on what I should do next? Are the amplifying and/or electronic stethoscopes legit? Should I talk to my school? Should I ask my PCP about seeing audiology?",

        "text": "\n7:00pm- On sick call this week. Currently gardening. Phone rings. Caller ID- ‚ÄúThe Devil‚Äù. It‚Äôs the chief calling me in. I let it go to voicemail. Listen to voicemail. ‚ÄúHey, peds resident #69 called in sick last minute, you have to cover the peds ED tonight. Shift starts at 8pm. I know it‚Äôs late so I‚Äôll let you start at 8:05. Call me back‚Äù. Call back and let them know I‚Äôll be there. \n\n7:15pm- Pick out peds ED outfit for the night. I choose my Looney Toons scrub cap, maroon scrubs, custom yellow Patagonia vest, and Toe Shoes. Kids love goofy outfits. \n\n8:00pm- Pull up to hospital. Pull out old parking ticket and put it under windshield wipers so I can park in the closer lot. \n\n8:15pm- Stock up on vending machine food. Toss in a Zynyrd Skynyrd and head down to peds ED. Say hey to PGY-5 Med-Peds resident. Tell them chief gave me til 8:30 but didn‚Äôt want them to stay too late so I came early.\n\n8:30pm- Med-Peds resident finishes signout on their two active patients. Dissociated while they talked about the rare syndrome they think one of the kids has, but I catch that one is pending appy rule-out, other is dislocated finger who has been here 5 hours and they were waiting for ortho to come and reduce while the attending is going to sedate. There are 6 waiting to be seen. Two are simple adult URIs they put back because the adult ED is overwhelmed. I don‚Äôt say anything, but Med-Peds apologizes profusely as they run out the door saying something about how they don‚Äôt see adults. They‚Äôve signed a 5 year contract as an attending on our adult medicine teaching service. \n\n9:00pm- I‚Äôve seen the 6 new ones. \n\nOne adult is shocky and needs sepsis workup. Nurse puts LMX on their right AC, left hand, and right temple. \n\nSecond adult eloped. Triage doesn‚Äôt remember if they placed an IV.\n\nTwo kids are URIs and parents heard we do viral testing. #1 has rhinovirus, mom says Urgent Care gave Meropenem and transferred by ambulance for admission for septic shock from double ear infection. Discharge. \n\nKid 2 coughs in my face. I ask mom to mute the tv while we talk. She turns it up higher. Kid Has both Strep and Mono. Dad says he thinks he has the flu and asks for a swab. \n\nKid 3 has a shunt with a seizure. And the last is there for ‚Äúdecreased appetite and bloody stools‚Äù by ambulance. Their mouth is covered with what I hope is chocolate while eating Flaming Hot Cheetos. They rub some on my arm. It‚Äôs not chocolate.\n\n9:30pm- I discharge Dad, explaining I don‚Äôt prescribe Codeine for the flu. They turn down Tamiflu, mumble about Big Pharma profits and how their PCP, Dr. Karen APRN HGTV already called them in Tylenol 3 + Z-Pack + a Medrol Dose Pack. \n\n9:45pm- Called by peds surgery yelling at me about how the appy rule out doesn‚Äôt have an appendix, it was removed a year ago. But to admit to them for serial exams. I never paged them. \n\n10:00pm- Call peds neurosurg about the kid with the seizure. Worried about shunt malfunction, luckily the resident who placed it is on call. They yell at me about how the kid is 18 and I need adult neurosurgery. Call adult neurosurg. It‚Äôs the same resident. They don‚Äôt seem to remember talking to me and go on a rant about how it‚Äôs not the shunt. \n\n10:15pm- I discharge the dislocated finger after saying Hi and accidentally having them self-reduce by making a fist. Dad makes a comment about how he‚Äôs glad the kid didn‚Äôt need admission cause they‚Äôd go home trans‚Äôd. \n\n10:20pm- Discharge decreased appetite kid, tell mom to stop feeding them Hot Cheetos. Mom threatens to sue because she knows her son‚Äôs body and ‚Äúhis temp runs low‚Äù. They leave. \n\n11:00pm- Attending comes back from their nap. I staff the patients. \n\n11:15pm- I see seizure kid getting wheeled away by flustered OR staff. Neurosurg resident comes screaming into work area yelling at me about emergent shunt revision and how I‚Äôm so stupid I wouldn‚Äôt recognize myself in the mirror. \n\n12:00am- Three kids come by ambulance. All together from home. 2 for belly pain, 1 for cough and congestion. Kids #1 and #2 are belly pain, #3 is cough. Examine them. Kids #1 and #2 have no belly tenderness but are wheezing. Kid #3 is frankly peritoneal. Ask mom and dad about smoke exposure at home. They deny anything. The room smells like a mix between my grow room and a 70s movie theater. Whatever. \n\n12:15am: Kid #3 is antibiosed and I head back to the room with peds surg. As we approach, we see mom thrown out of the room and smack her head on the floor. Seizes. I stabilize and intubate her. Call a trauma alert. Adult ED resident comes to take her to the bay. Peds surg resident is also covering trauma pager and goes with. Turns out ‚Äúmom‚Äù is actually girlfriend, and real mom works for registration. Walked in on girlfriend and dad making out and lost it. Head back into room. Dad is nowhere to be found. Room smells like bleach for some reason. Kid #3 took a giant dump in the middle of the floor, belly is now soft. Kid #1 is eating it, while the other two are finger-painting. Admit to gen peds for social concerns. They ask me to consult Poison Control for Kid #1 as well as DCFS.\n\n1:00am- Finish notes, throw in a second Zyn and reflect on life choices. \n\n2:00am- Nurse tells me they got a line on the septic adult. I head in to tell them I‚Äôm admitting them. They have stickers on their face, head quadruple wrapped in Kerlex with a 22 in the scalp. Sitting on the peds social worker‚Äòs lap eating a popsicle and watching Blue‚Äôs Clues on an iPad.\n\n2:15am- Nap. \n\n4:00am- Morning resident arrives. Asks where the attending is. I have no idea. I go home and go to sleep. \n\n2:00pm- Wake up. Email from overnight attending reminding me of the importance of sepsis bundles. Second email from DCFS about how they investigated my report, found no evidence of neglect, and how I need to respect their limited resources. Third email from hospital risk management about not taking patient complaints seriously. \n\n4:00pm- Sore throat. Swollen lymph nodes. Fever of 102. Phone rings. Caller ID- ‚ÄúThe Devil‚Äù.",

Gosh, figuring out specialty has been the most mind-fucking gymnastics I've had to endure over the last few months. \n\n1) GS\n\nMan I loved the OR. Time flew there, even in specialties I was less interested in, even in cases I didn't scrub and had to watch standing 5 feet away, time just flew. I remember seeing a few cases that have stuck with me as just the most riveting, inspiring shit I've ever seen in my life and went home and daydreamed about that afterwards. That said, man am I TERRIFIED of how much life this career could suck out of me. I'm not a \"live to work\" kind of person. I'm not afraid of hard work and understand the weight of why the hours/training is so grueling, but I do have other interests/priorities outside of work and do not want a life of waking up &gt; working &gt; going to sleep. I have hobbies I'd like to continue, I enjoy down time, I don't want my relationships to suffer. I seriously get nightmares at night thinking about becoming a slave to the system and losing any semblance of life outside of the hospital. \n\n2) EM\n\nI love doing things with my hands, procedures are a must. I liked most things inpatient and could see this being a nice mix of it all. I love high acuity. I feel like I need resuscitation and trauma patients in my career to keep things exciting. I also don't mind some downtime at work and I'm sure the BS PCP type patients would be a nice break. That said, I don't like the idea of a career full of triage and not being the expert in anything. I went to med school to become someone's endpoint, I left the world of EMS because of this triage nature and not being developed enough to provide that endpoint care. The endless stream of initial workups that I'd never end up solving or partaking in also seem irksome. I'd miss being in the OR. Lines, tubes, suturing would be cool, but I'd definitely miss being in the OR. BUT I recognize this lifestyle is wildly better than GS and I'd have shift work, time off, be able to plan out time to do hobbies/family/travel. \n\nIt basically boils down to this - I'd gain the most career satisfaction being in the OR and being that endpoint expert with surgery. But I feel like I'd lose a lot my life to it and I'm not sure which trade-off I'd be happier with. More satisfaction with career or more satisfaction with life? \n\nI feel so lost in this process and I've changed my mind so many times. I feel like this is an exciting place to be in the journey and all I've felt lately is fear, anxiety, and trepidation with my fourth year coming up built out right now for surgery. I feel like I haven't been able to make a solid decision and stick with it and it's mentally exhausting. \n\nThank you for reading and any insight.",

On my first day she got into a fender bender and basically took her frustration out on me. Since then, I feel as if I am a target for anything that goes wrong. \n\nFor example: I was told I was \"below the level of my peers\" because I refused to do a genitourinary exam on a teenage by myself (I am a male and told my preceptor I would be feel more comfortable to do it with her in the room). Throughout the rotation she has made several hints that imply she is going to write an eval that paints me as incompetent.\n\nUp until this point, I have outstanding comments on my evals which specifically mention I am a hardworker and demonstrate professionalism. This is a rotation for a field I do not want to go into. I was wondering what the best course of action would be to handle this? To this point, I have been writing down unprofessional things she has done to me thus far with timestamps. Do I wait until the end of the rotation to mention this to my school or can I let them know early what to expect?",

        "text": "\n5am: wake up, frantically read the article I was assigned to give a presentation on. 4th one this week on hyponatremia, hard to keep them straight.\n\n5:45am: Get to the hospital to thoroughly chart check the two patients I am following.\n\n7:00am: Whewwww, barely had enough time to finish my chart checking. Those sodium levels don‚Äôt trend themselves you know. Don‚Äôt even get me started on their Mg/Phos.\n\n7:30am: Finish pre-rounding on my two patients. Twice the time it took me on surgery with 1/10 of the patient load. What can I say, those surgeons are only good for cutting, blowing through contact precautions, consults for constipation, and fecal disimpactions of course. Could I do the disimpaction myself? Sure, but why rob them of one of their greatest pleasures. \n\n7:31am: get an angry call from general surgery, why the fuck did we not pick up their consult call at 5:00am. Their patient has well controlled type I diabetes with a  fasting glucose of 101 and an A1c of 6.6%. They could have DIED in that hour and a half. \n\nI apologize and say we would be glad to manage their diabetes but as a consulting service only. The general surgery resident is incredulous, but they have this thing called HTN as well?!? How can they be expected to manage such a rare and mediciny sounding condition. I see that they are well controlled on their home meds with a BP of 120/80; I tell them to continue home meds and we can watch that as well but ONLY as a consulting service. \n\n7:40am: I began to craft a well thought out and researched plan for my two patients. I have combed through every UpToDate article, all PubMed articles published in the last ten years, and obscure articles published only in Japan, India, and China. I painstakingly translate each word through Google Translate. I shall not let anyone out Medicine me. \n\n8am: I receive a call from general surgery again, they say the patient‚Äôs POC glucose was 85 and ask how much of D10 they need to give. I explain that 85 is fine but they should also just let the patient eat breakfast if they are just going to ride the OR board for another 10 days. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been NPO for 10 days already and just needs a sacral ulcer debrided, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs very hungry.‚Äù The resident is once again incredulous, how could I possibly even suggest giving a surgical patient a diet even though there is a -1,000,000% chance they will be going to the OR today.\n\n8:10am: I get a call from Orthopedic Surgery who wants me to admit a patient they just put an ex-fix on and will be taking to the OR at least 10 more times. I ask what medical conditions are going on and they respond with ‚ÄúWell the Cr thing in Epic is red, it‚Äôs 1.36, that‚Äôs bad right?‚Äù I shake my head and explain that is .01 over normal and the patient broke 69 bones and just completed an 18 hour operation, it‚Äôs normal for Creatinine to go up after such events. The Ortho resident cannot help himself he says ‚ÄúNiceeeeeeeeeee, thanks for taking my call so I can transfer the patient to your service right?‚Äù\n\n8:20am: Since my masterful tactical battlefield planning got interrupted, I decide to take a few minutes for reflection. I think how these individuals were once at the very top of their class. A step 1 score of 284 and step 2 score of 298 and a bench press of 550kg. Oh how the mighty have fallen I think to myself but I catch myself because it isn‚Äôt their fault. I instead thank my lucky stars that I don‚Äôt suffer from Cerebral Wasting Disease, an epidemic among surgeons. It will be the first epidemic I tackle after I finish my Infectious Disease Fellowship, my chance to truly stand tall and proud in the world after ‚Äúonly going into medicine.‚Äù \n\nThis needs a Part 2 because well, Medicine rounds last that long.",
