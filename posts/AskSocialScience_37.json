Basically, we're trying to find out how people frame their experience within our experiment, so Goffman literature should help with that.\n\nNow, short of reading Frame Analysis in its glorious 600 page entirety, are there any good overviews of his work that I could use? I've looked quite a bit but've come up empty so far.\n\nThanks for your support!\n\nNinja edit: four groups in the experiment, one of which is a control group. The others use different mindset-inducing prompts as independent variables: a) perspective- or roletaking (which, IIRC, equates to ratified, official, intentional participants per Goffman) b) modelling/priming (which again, should come out to mean implicit or unratified unintentional discourse participants) c) different priming approach (again)\n\nI basically just need citable sources for that :)\n",

But I'm interested in the realistic effects of attacking a (dangerous) ideology violently. Bear in mind, we're talking about small violent groups (the antifascists), so it seems to me that examples of government persecution / army action might not be informative to how something like this might turn out.\n\nMy intuition tells me that this would backfire and make current non-fascists (or apathetic people with fascist predispositions) likely to become fascist themselves as they feel they are under attack (whatever their in-group is).

They were originally poor and they are living that JK Rowling-tier rags to riches life. I assume that even if my parents kept in touch with them, the friendship would still end due to this *huge* social gap.\n\nSo is blood stronger than friendship? Say if a person in a family becomes extremely rich, they can share their money with other family members so that they can move up the social ladder together. This doesn't happen between friends. I know that that example is kind of extreme (not that many JK Rowling-tier rags to riches stories out there) but I've heard of stories of how people got ghosted by their friends when they got that promotion or have a more successful career than their friends.",

I will start with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BH_gncP_5vc) as I thought it might be cool to show how the concept used to be understood. Now I am trying to find documentaries/news clips on how the leisure time concept is now evaluated in the US. Additionally, I'd also like a documentary in English (as I have some in German but its for English students) about the concept, but so far no luck. If anyone has some useful links, I would highly appreciate it. From amusement parks to hobbies in the US and Germany, anything regarding leisure time might help\nThanks in advance",

I think that's as right wing of a mentality  as it gets.\n\nNow, I am not in the slightest bit intolerant. I do not care to discriminate gays, transgenders, I do not care about anything happening consensually between any groups or any people or anyone using their own money to make changes to their body, for as long as they are productive people (or have money for it) and they do not inflict damage upon society. And yet, when I voice my opinions, left-wing people often attack me from these angles.\n\nI followed the US election very closely. And the media outlets would not stop calling Trump intolerant, they said he is against gay rights, a racist (he may be, but it's more like he's sheltered and he only sees 'poor black and Hispanic people in inner cities' because even the middle class was a whole world below him his entire life), and every time I heard that stuff I saw the image of Trump holding a big rainbow flag on one photo.

The graffiti that has been left has made it pretty clear that the damage is the result of \"anti-gentrification activists\".\n\nHonestly, this is fascinating to me, because I'd never thought of gentrification as something you could \"oppose\". In a discussion about the most recent vandalism on our local subreddit, someone suggested that the damage is being done to \"increase the cost\" of wealthier / middle-class people moving into the neighbourhood - *\"Sure, the rent is lower, but you have to deal with replacing your windows five times a year\"*.\n\nI've spent the morning reading a bit about gentrification, but any specific (middish-length, digestible) articles on the topic would be of interest to me. I can understand why their would be opposition to gentrification, but it seems like ... you'd be opposing the independent actions of scores of actors, so I'm not sure how successful it would be.\n\nMy questions:\n\nIs this (disruptive vandalism) a tactic that's regularly used to oppose gentrification? Can anyone recall instances of it being successful?\n\nHave there been other \"anti-gentrification\" tactics that have worked?\n\nGentrification, to me, seems like an emergent property of neighbourhoods in a capitalist market; it's nothing anybody does, it just *happens* as the result of people's attempts to maximize the benefits of their own actions. Is this generally seen as the case, or is it the result of active intention?\n\nThanks for the help! I feel like I've stumbled across something fascinating happening in my own backyard, so I want to ask people more resourceful and knowledgeable than me for information about what's going on!

        "text": "In 1951, Eric Hoffer released a widely influential book which documented the common traits in fanatics of Communism and Nazi-ism and contended that many mass movements (including religions, cults and political parties) attract True Believer.  He notes a True Believer to be someone who views the mass movement as part of their identity and believes in the movement to find purpose and belonging rather than the substance of the views themselves.  Many people become True Believers due to either falling from middle-class to working-poor status (and losing faith in the system), or an existential boredom which creates a void that they cannot fill by their own creativity.  True Believers tend to be dogmatic and despite the fervor in defending their beliefs, they don't have much depth or nuance.  The defining trait, perhaps, is the ability to shift from one belief to a diametrically opposite belief with equal fervor.  Perhaps a Marxist who turns into a die-hard capitalist with zero exceptions, or someone who blindly trusts the government who goes on the other extreme of indiscriminately being anti-establishment.\n\nMy question is if there's a scale or not.  Nature tends to not work in a modular way.  The binary mold of True Believer or not-True-Believer is very limited.  Many people have a few traits of a true-believer but aren't exactly a true believer.  Just because someone is extreme, devout and dogmatic to one viewpoint does not automatically mean that their belief is interchangeable, but I think the line is crossed when identity factors in.  In politics, for example, when issues can't be explained deeply in terms of economy/morality/publicsafety, and it boils down to \"us vs. them\", that's a good sign.  Perhaps there is some sort of Kinsey Scale for true belief.  \n\n* 1 - Person thinks freely.  While they do have biases, they're not devoutly attached to any ideology.\n* 2 - Person does have some dogmatic elements, but it doesn't play a large part of their life.\n* 3 - Person is devout, but has genuine concern for the cause and is not interchangeable in their beliefs.\n* 4 - True Believer",

Do we have empirical evidence that licensing produces better (safer?) outcomes?\n\n2. Does licensing have an effect on economic indicators like unemployment, output, income equality?\n\n3. Is there a relationship between licensing and union membership?\n\n4. A more normative question: Is there a general consensus among mainstream economists as to when we *should* license certain professions?",

For example, Japan was ranked 111th out of 144 counties in [the GGGI](http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2016/rankings/), while according to [the GII](http://hdr.undp.org/en/composite/GII) Japan ranked at 21st out of 159 countries which makes them higher than the U.K. (28th) or Australia (24th) in terms of gender equality. The GII also shows that China (37th) and Libya (38th) rank higher than the US (43th), and Saudi Arabia ranks at 50th right after Hungary (49th) which is a stalk contrast against its rank in GGGI (141st) which is practically speaking they have the worst gender equality in the world. \n\nWhat's the reason for these differences and which one should I refer to when it comes to discourse regarding gender equality?

Is it rational to conclude that partisan gerrymandering is not a strong driver of electoral outcomes?\n\nhttp://electionlawblog.org/?p=91074\n\nHere is link to the paper:\n\nhttp://www-personal.umich.edu/~jowei/gerrymandering.pdf\n\nABSTRACT\n&gt;What is the effect of gerrymandering on the partisan outcomes of United States Congressional elections?\nA major challenge to answering this question is in determining the outcomes that would have resulted in\nthe absence of gerrymandering. Since we only observe Congressional elections where the districts have\npotentially been gerrymandered, we lack a non-gerrymandered counterfactual that would allow us to\nisolate its true effect. To overcome this challenge, we conduct computer simulations of the districting\nprocess to redraw the boundaries of Congressional districts without partisan intent. By estimating the\noutcomes of these non-gerrymandered districts, we are able to establish the non-gerrymandered\ncounterfactual against which the actual outcomes can be compared. The analysis reveals that while\nRepublican and Democratic gerrymandering affects the partisan outcomes of Congressional elections in\nsome states, the net effect across the states is modest, creating no more than one new Republican seat in\nCongress. Therefore, the partisan composition of Congress can mostly be explained by non-partisan\ndistricting, suggesting that much of the electoral bias in Congressional elections is caused by factors\nother than partisan intent in the districting process.",
