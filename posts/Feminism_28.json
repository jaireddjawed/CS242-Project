        "text": "r/Feminism is looking for new mods!\n\n**Hello everyone!**\n\nWe are looking to add some new moderators to our moderation team, and are accepting applications now. The positions would start as junior mods before moving into full moderation duties.\n\nThe junior mod position would include helping remove comments and posts that are off topic, with other moderation duties to follow.\n\n**What we are looking for in a junior moderator:**\n\n*Investment in feminism!* - We don’t require you to have an academic background in women's issues, although that is welcome. We do require you identify as a feminist, and all ages (over 18), nationalities and genders are welcome. If you are part of a vulnerable community please note this as well, as increasing the diversity of our team is a priority. Applicants must be active in feminist/progressive forums, and their account should be at least 3 months old.\n\n*Constructive attitude* - No history of hate speech including transphobia, ableism, ageism, sexism etc\n\n*Ability to work individually and with a team* -  our moderation team functions in English. While fluency in other languages is very welcome, a junior mod should be able to communicate constructively with an English speaking team.\n\n\n**If you are interested (and we do welcome all applications!) please [send a message to the moderation team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/Feminism) that includes:**\n\n*Account age, preferred pronouns*. We won’t be able to accept new accounts or those with little to no post history.\n\n*Timezone and expected availability* \n\n*A brief background on your feminism.* This can include issues that are important to you, previous activism, or why you are interested in joining the team. \n\nFeel free to add anything you might feel is relevant and could add to your application or help us get to know you; if we have any further questions, we will let you know.\n\nThank you everyone for being such a wonderful and engaged community, and we look forward to seeing your thoughts.\n\nCheers!",

It's both a cutting critique of the silliness of Shakespearean romance, and a celebration of true, egalitarian, 'feminist' romance at the same time; and written by, for, and about a bloke, too, on top of all that 🤪.\n\nSo in that vein, I wanted to share a little thought, my own personal 'motto' on life, which is, in my opinion, how one can be both positive, and angry, at the same time: \n\n   *\"Contentment is a SKILL, it is not an achievement. It is a METHOD, and not a goal. You will never 'reach' contentment, no matter how hard you run toward it.\n\nThe trick is to slow down, walk carefully and thoughtfully, and analyse everything you find critically, sceptically, but with total self-honesy, and hey presto, there contenment lies, you have caught it at last.\n\nUnless you can convince yourself you are 'good enough' already, improving yourself, and caring about others, will be nearly impossible.\"*\n\nI would love to hear what this community might think about this kind of philosophy ❤",
