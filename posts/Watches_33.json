Free The World.”\n\nTitanium is an extremely tough yet lightweight metal, having the highest strength to weight ratio of any structural metal.  Titanium is used extensively in the Aerospace industry in high profile military applications like the structure of the SR-71 Blackbird.  The black DLC coating titanium finish gives the  watch a sleek and industrial style. The machining process is very precise as the whole case acts like an extremely tough egg, tough but brittle, therefore requires surgical precision.  More than ever the new Titanium “Free The Money, Free The World” time piece unfurls the modern and futuristic features of our current generation.  This timepiece is fitted with a perforated aged black strap with rubber inside. The “Free The Money, Free The World” is an exciting chapter in Franck Muller’s story of modern and innovative watches.\n\nEach timepiece comes as a two piece “Deep Cold Storage” set, with its own unique public address etched on the dial and a sealed USB containing the private key.  You add your Bitcoins to your Bitcoin wallet or check your balance directly through the dial.\n\n\nNakamoto - https://franckmullerencrypto.com/product/franck-muller-mens-45mm-carbon-fiber-nakamoto/\n\nFranck Muller is proud to announce the brand new watch, the Nakamoto. Only 100 watches will be made in this unique collection. The Nakamoto is a timeless piece….. Bitcoin is very much about time – through its creation of a distributed timestamp server to create a universal history of timestamped events.  And now, Nakamoto is a moment to honor Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Reflecting the premium nature of the timepiece, it is made with a carbon fiber case.  Franck Muller watches are made with an exemplary degree of hand finishing and hand craftsmanship, as well as mastery of grand mechanical complications. The Nakamoto has the Vanguard shape that is the Franck Mueller brand’s recognizable silhouette. It is so fitting, that Franck Muller is creating a watch in honor of Bitcoin’s creator.  Franck Muller is a master of mechanical watchmaking complications that come together to make an elegant design – just like Satoshi Nakamoto was a master of technical, economic and legal complications that came together for the elegant design of Bitcoin. It’s a fit that is simply . . . timeless \n\nSKU: V45 SC DT BTC NKM CARBON JA",

It can't be beat. It's feature packed, durable and did I mention it was affordable? If you don't have one of these, then I highly recommend it.\n\nNext, the full metal G-SHOCK square--it's a beast. I would say it provides the best value between the resin squares and the MR-G. Perfect accuracy due to the Bluetooth and Multi Band 6 syncing and tough as nails. 10/10.\n\nLastly, my newest pickup, the Grand Seiko SBGP007. I think this watch is absolutely awesome. It has the tweaked 9F quartz movement good for +/- 5spy, not many other watches can provide this level of accuracy not named The CITIZEN or Longines VHP. The proportions are excellent, the fit and finish is superb and it's just an excellent all-around watch.\n\nWould love to hear your answer!",

Every time it costs an arm and a leg (last time CHF 850,-) because it is sent in to the manufacturer for revision:  \nMy question to this group:  \nHow often should I have a watch revised?  \nIs it better to wait until something is broken or to have it done regularly?  \nDoes it have to be sent in to the manufacturer? Or can I trust my local jeweller/watchmaker/\"Uhrmachermeister\" to do a sufficient job maintaining it?  \nDoes it make a difference, if the caliber is from Swatch or actually custom-made by the manufacturer?  \nThanks for enlightening me.

        "author": "dreftzg",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/11kz7tk/daily_news_swatch_has_a_novel_approach_to_fixing/",
        "text": "It's Tuesday and here's some watch news:\n\n# What's new\n\n[The MoonSwatch Mission To Moonshine Gold, but it’s not what we wanted](https://www.fratellowatches.com/introducing-the-omega-x-swatch-mission-to-moonshine-gold/)\n\n/ Almost exactly a year ago, Swatch broke the internet. Love it or hate it, we all ended up hating the Swatch version of the Omega Speedmaster. Some, wrongly, hated it because it was plastic, expensive and a ripoff of one of the most iconic watches of all time. The rest of us, rightly, hated it because we can’t buy it. Since they launched, Swatch has promised that the MoonSwatch will be available online in unlimited quantities. This has yet to happen, as numbers delivered to stores are limited and scalpers are still making bank on resales.\n\nNow Swatch is doubling down on their mistake. They took the Mission to Moon edition of the MoonSwatch and coated the chronograph seconds hand with the Moonshine Gold alloy. That’s it. That’s all. No increased numbers. Just a gold second.\n\nSure, it’s cool. It’s the same metal that Omega used on the Speedmaster Professional Apollo 11 50th Anniversary in Moonshine Gold. This 18K alloy consists of 75% gold (hence the 18 karats), 14% silver, 1% palladium, and less than 9% copper. It gives the gold a paler shade, but it also enhances the longevity of its color and luster. It would have been cooler if we could actually buy any of the versions...\n\nTo make things worse, Swatch says Moonshine Gold-coated seconds hand was produced on one day in February during the full moon. Lol. Good luck getting one, as they will be available in Swatch stores in London, Milan, Zürich, and Tokyo only, but still at an OK price - the markup for this version is 25 Swiss francs, for a total of CHF 275.\n\n[The Gradient Blue Mido Ocean Star Tribute is an almost affordable but nice summer watch](https://monochrome-watches.com/introducing-mido-ocean-star-tribute-gradient-blue-dial-specs-price/)\n\n/ Just last week we gushed over the Ocean Star Decompression Worldtimer, a crazy busy watch that we wouldn’t mind owning. Now they’ve come out with a very nice version of their vintage-inspired dive watch, the Ocean Star Tribute. Mido does amazing colors on their dials, so the gradient blue is now joining the amazing red and green options.\n\nNothing groundbreaking here, just nicely sized 200m water-resistant model with classic designs. With a 40.5mm diameter and a polished steel case with pointy crown guards, the Ocean Star Tribute is reviving the style of the 1960s, so with the light blue color it’s perfect to be worn all summer. It has the entry level Powermatic 80 movement and comes in at a barely acceptable EUR 1,110. If it was sub 1000 it would have been a great watch.\n\n[Don’t have a couple hundred grand for a Cartier Crash? Would you maybe be interested in a Clash?](https://watchesbysjx.com/2023/03/cartier-clash-unlimited.html)\n\n/ There’s no denying that the Cartier Crash will go down as one of the top 10, maybe 15, watches of all time. It has it all - the story, the looks, the rarity. But it’s also well in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. So if you look at Cartier, is there anything that could fill a similar void? \n\nIn comes the new Cartier \\[Un\\]limited collection. It’s completely different to the art deco style that Cartier is famous for. It’s edgy, fun, colorful. In fact, the Clash seems like something from a brand more associated with streetwear, like Louis Vuitton for instance.\n\n[ochs &amp; junior has a different twist on a dual time watch](https://wornandwound.com/ochs-junior-gives-us-two-time-zones-without-the-fuss/)\n\n/ I would say that ochs &amp; junior is trying to bank on the GMT trend if i didn’t know anything about ochs &amp; junior. Even a cursory glance at this ever-more-popular brand will tell you - these people do not jump on trends. They might scrape by them, but they surely do whatever they want. \n\nWhat they did is essentially a 12 hour bezel that’s been set within the dial itself, and made adjustable via the crown. It’s fun and indeed creative, and also a testament to the simple beauty and practicality of a 12 hour bezel. Cool. The watches must be ordered via email with the company, where a 50% deposit will be required. Pricing is set at CHF3,065 without VAT \n\n# On hand - a selection of reviews\n\n[Single hand watches are weird. This SNGLRTY (horrible name) is even weirder.](https://www.ablogtowatch.com/watch-review-snglrty-white-knight/)\n\n[A classy dress watch from a California based microbrand - not bad](https://deployant.com/review-the-new-dumoreau-dm02/)\n\n# Watch Worthy - A look at an offbeat, less known watch you might actually like\n\n[You surely won’t mistake a SevenFriday watch for something else](https://www.ablogtowatch.com/hands-on-sevenfriday-ps3-01-jade-carbon-watch/)\n\nWe don’t particularly like carbon fiber cased watches. Nor do we appreciate looking weird just for the shock value. Both of those things are true of the SevenFriday PS3/01 “Jade Carbon” watch. And yet… We’re kinda intrigued.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis post is part of an experiment to see how watch news changes on a daily basis.
