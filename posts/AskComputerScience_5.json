        "text": "Some background to help understand:\n\nI was playing around with LaTeX, specifically Texmaker, and noticed there's a field in the Quick Build option where you can edit the command that the program uses to call the compiler. I decided to write a small program (in C#, but this isn't a language-specific question), that would do a sort of quick find-and-replace so I could replace some commonly used formatting text with shortcuts, before passing it off to the main compiler. I don't care if there's a better/easier way to do this, it's already done and it's works perfectly. Plus, it gave me a chance to play around with the command line, something I rarely have a need to use.\n\nAnyway, in the arguments it can pass in the file name, but it *doesn't* include the whole file path (\"C:\\\\users\\\\zrice03\\\\blah...\"). Just something like \"filename.tex\". So in my program, all I'm calling is literally 'File.ReadAllLines(\"filename.tex\")'. Yet despite not knowing where the file is in the system (and I know it doesn't know, because nowhere did tell it what folder it's in), it still manages to find and read it. My program's executable is not in the same folder that \"filename.tex\" is, it's in a completely different part of the folder hierarchy. So how does it know to look in *that* specific folder. Or is it just looking for all files everywhere called \"filename.tex\" and I just got lucky that there's only one?\n\nI remember something like this happening when I took a intro to C++ class too. We were learning to read from files, but we were just giving it the file name and extension, not the whole path. I was confused by that at the time, but never followed up.",

Should I give it a shot??? I was looking into my local Community Colleges to start I know I will probably have to take remedial courses to bump up my grades in order to study. But I guess my main goal is to learn this hard skill so that I may be able to do things that require some sort of creativity or uniqueness. What do y’all think? Also I would like to mention I am currently working full time and am considering studying full time as well. But is it possible for someone to trun their grades around? Hence why I never truly gave College a shot until now that I have finally found interest in something and it’s computers.",

If p = #SAT(e1) and q = #SAT(e0), what is the best way to compute p/q using existing SAT solver technology?\n\nSome thoughts:\n\nCertainly we *could* compute p and q then take the quotient, but this just isn't feasible due in part to the runtime complexity, but due mostly to the large nature of p and q. Notably, p/q is in the interval [0,1] since e1 subsumes e0. If p = 1 or some other very low number our solution can't be much better than a solution for #SAT. \n\nIf C has enough clauses we might be able to pick e1' s.t. e1 =&gt; e1' =&gt; e0 s.t. #SAT(e1') is about halfway between p and q. I think a small C would need to have some rather unfortunate and probably unlikely properties for it to also be the case that q is much bigger than p.\n\nContext:\n\nSatisfying assignments for an expression e0 encode objects, the class of which I'm searching over. So the expression e1 = e0 /\\ C can be thought of as a pruned version of the search space, where C is the exclusion criteria. I want to compute p/q at various points during the search to get a sense of how much progress has been made. So if this problem is amenable to an approximation that is acceptable, as long as it's tight enough to still give some sense of how much progress has been made. Ideally, the approximations would still be ordered by subsumption, i.e. if e2 =&gt; e1 =&gt; e0 then the approximation for #SAT(e2)/#SAT(e0) ought to be less than or equal to the approximation for #SAT(e1)/#SAT(e0). The 'progress bar' shouldn't move backwards.\n\nIf the current state of the pruned search space is small enough I'd be happy to just display the #SAT value.\n\nSince this is an incremental search, I don't need to compute #SAT(e2)/#SAT(e0) from scratch if it makes more sense to compute #SAT(e2)/#SAT(e1) and then multiply it by the cached computation of #SAT(e1)/#SAT(e0) instead. I think it's fair to assume that #SAT(e_ {i}) and #SAT(e_ {i+1}) will not be *too* far apart. If they are #SAT(e_{i+1}) is probably small enough to print.",

(Print to screen) rather than me just entering it. So static int frkDrank = 0; \n\n  static int chkPtNum = 1;  would be both values that he would enter in. Thank you for reading through this and if you do help, thank you so much. Also side note if it helps, the IDE I use is Replit and the language is Java. \n\nI hope you all have a wonderful winter.",

I whole heartedly believe humans are only selfish, and evil. I do not care about humans at all. \n\nI was told \"all jobs in tech are about customer support\" and that actual tech skills don't matter. \n\nI'm not the most experienced programmer, I have a degree in industrial maintenance technology and have taken some programming courses in robotics and PLCs, these were my favorite classes. The logic of code makes me feel relaxed and safe. \n\nI wouldn't mind a job creating software, or designing computer systems, I like computers in general, but all of this \"customer support\" stuff sounds awful. \n\nI even like electronics, one of my favorite books is \"code the hidden language of computer hardware and software\". \n\nI keep being told CIT is just a glorified business degree. Which to me, sounds like it's a waste of time. \n\nI don't think business degrees are even relevant in tech. I don't think business degrees are relevant at all. \n\nI want to get a degree that's technlogy focused and challenging. Which seems to me to be CS but I have a hard time finding a online program for CS in my state, but there's plenty of \"CIT\" programs which I am starting to think I don't want any part of. \n\nThe whole management and business part of it turns me off hard. I want to learn a hard-core science. Is CIT even comparable to CS in this regard?",

        "text": "Hi, I'm building a geeky holiday scavenger hunt for a community I am in, and I wanted to use this technique on its forum.\n\nOn image boards you can usually find images displayed with a thumbnail, and click on them to expand them to full size. In the case of shock content, it'll usually turn out to be a screamer gif with an innocent first frame, so the site only displays the first frame as the thumbnail. But I have noticed another technique used for still images.\n\nThe following image is not shock content, but it is part of a forced meme (Log). I'm not part of promoting this meme, it was simply the most socially appropriate example of this technique I could find:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/WvccH7n.png](https://i.imgur.com/WvccH7n.png)\n\nWhen you open the image above, you see a SFW close up of a man's face with some text at the bottom. Its dimensions are 600x646px.\n\nDisplayed at the image board's thumbnail size of `width=\"116\" height=\"125\"` it appears like this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tsux5kz81x5a1.png?width=344&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6d41a24ba160743975de21760940146678ddceb8\n\nHere's what I've determined:\n\n\\- At least one of the images are dithered or interlaced in some way\n\n\\- Because of this, a moire pattern emerges if you scale the image in an image viewer\n\n\\- As you scale the image in an image viewer, it snaps suddenly to reveal only one or the other image at specific dimensions\n\n\\- Both images contain visible compression artifacts\n\n\\- You can break the effect if you resize the image by 1px without respect for the aspect ratio\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have determined all of this but I haven't been able to recreate it with other images. What am I missing? There's probably a lazy simple generator for this effect somewhere and I just haven't used the right keywords.\n\nIf you know anything else about this, or other interesting tricks in the same vein, please feel free to share.

        "text": "\n**Background**: \n\nAlready have a bachelors degree in accounting, been working as a BI/analytics engineer, but not really utilizing much programming beyond simple scripting in python (the SQL I use is different, but obviously declarative is not like traditional programming).\n\nDecided that I want to pursue furthering my CS education formally, originally starting at a larger university, and now at a community college due to costs. I am also one of those people that learn by seeing examples, practicing examples of like kind, etc.\n\n**Situation:** \n\nIn my second introductory CS course (first was a 10 week python course that I ended up not liking, second is a 16 week C++ class and I like it much more), but I am still unsure how to problem solve like a programmer. I have read several posts here that suggest to code frequently and often, to continue doing problems, and to read suggested books like \"Think like a programmer\".\n\nI find that I grasp the functionality of the topics (control structures, input/output streams, types) as these are all similar to SQL. It's the types of problems encountered where I fail to problem solve. \n\n**Example:** \n\nFor example, summing two large integers in C++, with limitations to int and long long int types. I know I have a type limitation here and that I likely will have to loop through an array to calculate it, but the math of it seems super foreign...\n\nI started by reading the required textbook as well as a supplemental C++ book I purchased, and none of the chapters contained anything about solving for integer overflow, besides \"this is your limitation of the types\". So then, I started googling integer overflow and reading about it on StackOverflow. Much of the examples are beyond me as they're dealing with data structures and that's the next class I am taking.\n\nI then gave it the old college try by trying to develop a program that would sum the two numbers. My problem set has 3 tests to pass, and I got 2/3, but this solution is garbage IMHO. This is where I got stuck. I got it to sum numbers up to the limit, but not beyond... \n\nI finally found an article on GeeksForGeeks about summing two integers, and I can honestly say I would have never solved this on my own because:\n\n1.) I haven't seen a problem like this before (so doing more problems would be beneficial..but not from my textbook)\n\n2.) It's not like any of the math upbringing that I've been exposed to since much of that math provided an example and was classified into groups of problems of like kind... is this what an algorithms class handles is grouping these problems together?\n\n3.) No texts or homework problems that have been provided have discussed integer overflow to this degree, so I had to go googling.\n\n4.) The professor only has office hours once a week, and because of work/family/etc, I can never attend them. There's no recordings of said office hours either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Concerns:** \n\nMy concern is that I ***DEEPLY*** ***WANT*** to develop this problem solving ability so I don't have to google so much or at all, and can think through the problem. I also want to be so comfortable with the language that I can recognize what to use and not (given my crappy code solution above). I just don't know where to go to gain and/or develop the acumen.\n\nWhat I am asking for is detailed clarity (something I need in order to understand it best, hence why I went from the python to C++ class as I couldn't understand the concepts until I dug deeper). I really enjoy C++.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1.) is it as simple as doing more problems, every day, and eventually I won't have to google as much? Or is there something I'm not grasping in how the problems and solutions are organized (like in accounting, I know X problem was grouped in Y set, so I knew what mental path to go down). Will reading books help close this knowledge gap?\n\n2.) is it normal in the beginning phases to google everything? I'm not copying code without trying to really grasp what the code is doing because if I just copied the code I would be short changing myself. That being said, I don't think I would have passed this class without coming across similar solutions and then implementing them. It makes me feel like an imposter most of the time.\n\n3.) will I eventually see how these problems are organized? I feel like I'm learning the technical functions/operations/syntax of languages but not really understanding the formation of the problems. They seem rather random right now?\n\n4.) should I be supplementing by reading more solutions on StackOverflow and GeeksforGeeks?\n\n5.) is any of this considered number theory or discrete math? It seems that some of the problems would be best understood from those points of view?",

Also, I don't know what n means in this since I assume its different from N.\n\nAccording to my understanding, the breakdown of the summation would look like this but it doesn't make sense\n\nvalues(n? - 0) + values(n? - 1) + values(n? - 2) \n\nI put a question mark next to n because I don't know what it stands for. And since x is the array, I put 'values' there(are you expected to multiply the sum of the array against what's in the brackets?). and since the upper limit is N-1, and N = 3, that means the series would continue until k = 2.

He describes how he used it to log into his University's computer to work and read news, and also that he used it to log into Usenet groups to participate in debates and announce Linux.  This development took place from \\~1989-1991.  There's just one issue:\n\n*He didn't use TCP/IP.*\n\nI know that he didn't because he talks about the trouble he had implementing it much later  (this \"magical\" terminal emulator predates Linux version 0.01, while Linux + networking is version 0.95, I think).  Moreover, this was a bare metal terminal emulator:  no OS to provide support for connections, so something complicated like TCP/IP might have been difficult.\n\nMy question is:  *How was he able to connect to Usenet and other computers without TCP/IP?*\n\nFrom what I've read, TCP/IP is necessary to access the internet at all, and I always thought that you needed the internet to remotely access a computer.  *What sort of technology did he use?  What sort of protocols?  Can this be done today, or has this mode of inter-computer communication been discarded?*\n\nI would take it for granted that you could do this if you directly wired one computer to another, but we're talking about connecting to servers and computers possibly thousands of miles away.  This is a very old technology, so sources have been difficult to find, launching into somewhat abstruse discussions on BBS systems, modems, and serial lines (don't know how any of that works/worked), but from what I read, it's sort of like making a phone call, only to a computer.  \n\nIf someone could describe in greater detail (or point me to more readable sources that do) how this \"connecting without internet\" worked, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nAlso, if I posted this in the wrong forum, where should I post it?

At best, there's stuff to do with projections and potential business decisions but again the big calls are made by people right at the top so zero impact. \n\nI've been learning python as a bit of a hobby on the side and have very good maths skills. I have been thinking about going into computing for a bit now as just based on what I read online seems fun with the scope to really apply myself, have a decent work life balance and earn as much if not more than what I currently make. \n\nI feel I am in a bit of a niche position as I doubt there are many people who get into CS that are qualified accountants so I really want to make the most of my skills.\n\nI guess my question then is what kind of CS should I get into where I can use my qualified accountancy expertise mixed with CS. I imagine it'll most likely be related with the finance sector (and despite the cash don't think quant is for me). \n\nAppreciate the help.",

It's obviously the diagonal path through 12 and 18 to goal cell 24 is the shortest path. However, from the initial situation we move to cell 12 and discover an obstacle at cell 18. The edge costs into and out of cell 18 are now infinite and so we update edge costs and call updateVertex on cells 18, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19, 22, 23, and 24. By doing this the current/startcell 12's rhs value is changed and thus:\n\n    while ( U.TopKey() &lt; CalculateKey(Sstart) OR rhs(Sstart) != g(Sstart) )\n\nThe left statement of the computeShortestPath is false after our initial path finding, but the right is now true due to the changes rhs value of the start cell and so we run computeShortestPath and find a path. \n\nHowever, in the situation on the left we start at 0, want to go to 24 still, but when we move to cell 6 we discover the obstacle at cell 18. But in THIS situation the start cell is NOT a neighbor to the obstacle, and (as I currently understand D\\* Lite) it's thus NOT updated since the edge cost from 6 to 12 haven't changed. \n\nThis means that for the while:\n\nwhile ( U.TopKey() &lt; CalculateKey(Sstart) OR rhs(Sstart) != g(Sstart) )\n\nNeither statement is true, and thus we never get into computeShortestPath, and for my case I'm left in a situation where the only path to go from cell 12 is back to 6, and thus back and forth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, this seems like an obvious error on my part. However, I can't quite see WHERE things go wrong, other than 'somehow' I imagine that the changes need to be carried back to the current position and it's rhs updated.",
