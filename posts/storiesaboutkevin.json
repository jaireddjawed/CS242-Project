Everyone was standing around waiting, but my dad insisted the eclipse was an hour later because of \"daylight savings time not working on an eclipse. Why would they want to save daylight when the moon is in front of it?\" This is in spite of the 200 people gathered in the middle of this grungy small city\/large town (Grand Island NE) to watch. \n\nKevin says he's going to go buy potato chips at a gas station nearby. I figure this is okay, worst case if he doesn't get back in time he will watch from his car. \n\nAn hour later, totality is over and everyone gets ready to leave.

And the stupidity on display is in the social skills department on both sides. Some context: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy family was military and so by 3rd grade I was on my 4th school (I started in a jurisdiction where kids can go to school or pre-school from age 3 & my folks opted for school because I was G&T so it's not as much as it seems).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nG&T kids seem to run to two extremes: weird quiet ones, and weird ones who are *physically incapable of tolerating boredom or wrongness.* Guess which one I was? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll give you a hint: Once, when I was about 5, my 9YO cousin sat on me because my fidgeting was annoying her too much. \\*So I started wiggling my toes and fingers.\\* (Yes, I'm being evaluated as an adult for ADHD, why do you ask?)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway. Kevina the teacher, for her part, was the kind of old school teacher that cannot admit an error, penalizes kids for mastering the material by basically putting you in time out for the rest of class, and overall a nasty, cruel bully who shouldn't be in charge of a goldfish, let alone 32 kids between the ages of 7 and 9. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe got on about as well as elemental potassium and water, is what I'm saying. YouTube has some cool videos on that if you're not a chemistry type. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBack to the story. This is the tale of my first interaction of Kevina, and how I managed to start my first period of my first day of my first week of a new grade at a new school with my first ever in school suspension, setting a new record for speed of getting in shit in school in the extended family that stands to this day. First impressions, I am good at them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo first period was a bit of a deal because I was young for the grade (because of differences in age cutoffs in different regions and my prematurity I'd effectively skipped a grade) and small for my age, so they actually had to get a kindergarten desk brought up because I couldn't see over my desk (Yep. Was tiny.). Eventually the dust settles with a desk I can actually use and see over. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut by now the entire class is aware that I'm the weird kid who's too short for a normal desk and I'm already getting short joke. Great. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, being my G&T self in a mainstream program for the first time, I'm thinking I got this. Other programs it was cool to be good at math, so I just show off my algebra and pre-calculus and I can recover right? (Current me looking at kid me like, \"Oh honey. Oh honey no.\" Ever heard the phrase, \"For a smart kid they sure can be stupid?\" That was me. Book smart, socially oblivious, too impulsive for good judgement. ) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the teacher starts the review with addition. I am a bit insulted (I'm good at math but in the old district mainstream kids started long multiplication in 3rd grade, and second grade material was multiplication and division and some simple geometry, not addition and subtraction, which was kindergarten\/first grade material. My thinking was along the lines of, They might not be good at math but don't call them stupid, teacher!).  Unfortunately, this sense of being insulted for my classmates doesn't come out. What I say is, \"In my *old* school we did *long division*, this is too easy!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYeah, I was referred for an ASD assessment the previous year. So that tracks with my childhood social skills. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd the teacher replies, \"Well, if it's so easy, you can show the class how to do this one!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd she writes 2 \u00d7 3 = on the board. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTriumphantly, I say, \"6!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd the teacher says, \"No it's not, it's 5. I guess kids at your old school aren't \\*that\\* good at math.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe turned back to write another problem. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI. Was. Shocked. After I recovered my jaw from the floor, I stuttered a bit and finally blurted, \"That's wrong.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe teacher, lemme tell you, knew how to turn around ominously. I grew up in an authoritarian household and I knew it was possible to wash dishes ominously and call someone's name ominously but not turning around. That was new. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Excuse me? What was that, dear?\" This wasn't the dear of a sweet older lady talking to a kid. This was the saccharine fake-sweet Atlantic Canada dear that can mean anything you want it to, and right now it meant a string of profane insults so long I'd probably hit the word limit. Think how US Southerners can say \"fuck you, you stupid idiot\" with a \"bless your heart.\" That kind of dear. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd bless my socially oblivious little heart, I didn't pick up what she was putting down. \"2 times 3 isn't 5. That'd be 2 plus 3. 2 TIMES 3 is 6.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA *reasonable* adult would admit the error and move on, even if I was being a right little paster about it. Not Kevina. \"No, the answer is five. That's final.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA socially savvy kid would've recognized that tone and dropped it. Not me. No, I had the bit in my teeth. She was *wrong* and I couldn't just let her *sit* in her *wrongness* being wrong at me. This wouldn't stand, she's a teacher, she's supposed to know better! \"Why are you being stupid about this?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"*EXCUSE* me?!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"A *teacher* should know the difference between addition and multiplication, Miss. You're wrong, and I can prove it!\" I stood up from my desk. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I am *not* wrong,\" she said as she stalked towards me and my desk. \"You're new, and you want to make an impression on the class but this isn't the way to do it.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe pushed me back into my chair and continued, \"You will sit and *not say another word* if you want to not spend the rest of your first day in the office.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSmugly, she turned to return to the board. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut. I had spent 7 years mastering the ability to walk quiet enough to avoid my father's rage. And she was *wrong*. This wrongness couldn't be tolerated. I followed her. She didn't notice until I was drawing on the board. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI drew 2 sets of 3 lines, and circled each. To the class I said, \"Two threes is *SIX*.\" AND I counted the 6 lines.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen I drew a pair of lines and another set of 3 and circled each. To the class, I announced, \"Two *plus* three is five.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI counted the five lines one by one, stabbing my chalk into the board each time. The last one I did hard enough the chalk broke. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI looked her in the face. Speaking with the blunt, brutal honesty of a socially inept child with no filter, I said, \"You're wrong. If you don't know the difference, should you really be teaching us? Maybe *you* should be in third grade and *I* can teach math.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnnnd that was when she grabbed me by the collar and *dragged* me to the office. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt set the tone for our relationship, and remains one of my funniest memories from third grade.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1677772366.0},{"title":"Kevin\u2019s brilliant fix","author":"Hammer_Unto_Dawn","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/11e0z7x\/kevins_brilliant_fix\/","text":"This is a story from my mother.

Sorry in advance.\n\nThis was back in the early 2000s when vapes were barely heard off. Basically most shops didn\u2019t stock them yet and people were thinking it was a gimmick that would run its course. In fact, most people hadn\u2019t even heard of vapes it was that early.\n\nHere in the UK, the JobCentres would pass people that are having the highest difficulty getting into work onto third party agencies to teach them basic skills etc.\n\nI was sent to one such agency and this is where we encountered an entitled person.\n\nThis agency was a simple one. They had one main room and three private rooms. The Private rooms basically contained a small table and 2 chairs so that you can talk privately with your assigned member of staff.\n\nThe main room was all in one. At the front was the reception desk and a few chairs to sit and wait after signing in. Spanning the opposite side of the room along the windows were the staffs office desks. Then going most of the length of the room down the middle was a row of computers for customers to use for job search or typing up CVs etc.\n\nI had arrived, signed in and was waiting at the reception to be called for. After a few minutes I saw a guy about my age sat at one of the computers and there was smoke coming from him whenever he lifted his hand to his face. As this was early vaping days, the smoke was no thicker than a regular cigarette and was scented like these days so you\u2019d mistake him for smoking an actual cigarette.\n\nI knew straight away that he was smoking. So I quickly told the receptionist who looked over, saw the smoke and went to talk to him.\n\nReceptionist: Excuse me, you\u2019re not allowed to smoke in here.\n\nGuy: I\u2019m not smoking. (He shows her the vape).\n\nReceptionist: Doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re not allowed to smoke in here. Please put it away.\n\nThe guy puts it away and the receptionist returns to her desk.\n\n5 minutes later my adviser comes over to get me and just as I stood up to follow I noticed the smoke coming from the guy again and pointed it out to my adviser who promptly went over to him.\n\nAdviser: Excuse me, but can you put that cigarette out please. You\u2019re not allowed to smoke in buildings by law.\n\nGuy: I\u2019m not smoking. See. (Shows my adviser the vape).\n\nAdviser: Whether it\u2019s a cigarette, cigar or whatever that thing is, it\u2019s not allowed in here.\n\nGuy: But I\u2019m not smoking. (Continues to puff on the vape).\n\nAdviser: It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re smoking a cigarette or not. I\u2019m not going to argue with you. Either stop smoking or we\u2019ll inform the JobCentre of your actions.\n\nGuy: Fine fine. (He puts his vape away).\n\nAfter that I went with my adviser to talk about things.\n\nIf you think this is the end of the guy, you\u2019re mistaken.\n\nThis agency was in an office block with several other businesses. I had to leave my task to go to the toilet when I saw the guy wasn\u2019t at his computer, but his things were. As I went to the toilet which was out the office and down the corridor, I saw the guy stood in a corner of the hallway puffing away.\n\nWhen I\u2019d done my business and return to my assigned computer, I stopped by my adviser\u2019s desk and told him what I saw. He looked angry and started going around the other staff and telling them what is happening.\n\nOne adviser looked through his computer for something, made a few quick notes on paper before logging him out. Another two advisers gathered his belongings and left the room towards him.\n\nThe adviser who logged out the computer went onto her own machine and started working away. Five minutes later, the other two returned but without the guy.\n\nI asked my adviser what happened.\n\nBasically, they told the guy to take his stuff and leave. They will be contacting the JobCentre about his actions and wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they dock his benefits or something.\n\nNever the less, the following week when I went back, there were printed notices next the No Smoking signs with said in big letters \u201cNO VAPING ALLOWED\u201d.\n\nI never saw that guy again before the staff started passing me from pillar to post because they couldn\u2019t figure out how to help me get into work due to my health problems.

It wasn't your paycheck.\nThe part that makes this double stupid is that she openly posted all of this and still wants people to donate to her since she believes it wasn't her fault. What did she expect to happen?\n\nEdit: Info - Apparently she blamed \"the state\" because she works for the STATE GOVERNMENT.

I'd started a few months earlier and got a MacBook Pro from work. Kevin lived near my office so I'd visited her a couple times after work and she had seen the MacBook because I used it at her place.\n\nSo, after seeing I had a new personal computer, she starts asking me what I plan on doing with the MacBook. I'm very confused and explain, \"Nothing, it's my work computer.\"\n\n\"So then why did you buy a new computer?\"\n\n\"Because my work computer has admin restrictions and I can't download anything I want on it.

One by one the teacher would ask who wanted to go first until it reached my turn, which I patiently waited for, while noticing my bullies whispering to one another about what supposed movies I'll be listing off basically the stereotyped asain movies which I wasn't.\n\nMe: ok my first one will be. Small brown alien accidentally gets left behind by his ship, bumps into a kid while hiding in a cornfield and runs away knocking over trash bin, eventually the kid finds him and they become close friends until his ship returns for him.\n\nClassmate: Signs?\n\nMe: no, but I do what scene your talking about though.\n\nSeveral other of my classmates made their own guess, most were close and others weren't, until Kevin says \"you just made up the movie.\"\n\nMe: no I didn't, we literally just watched the movie two days ago and you were here to watch it too. But I'm not going to say what movie until everyone gives up.\n\nWhich everyone eventually did give up and I told them the movie I had picked was ET, Kevin again claimed it was a fake movie and that I made up the movie cause that's supposedly not what happened in the movie, I'm sure he's got the movie ET mixed up with Mars Attack or whatever that movie\/game is called.\n\nMy quick descriptions of Independence Day was \"aliens attack Earth day before July 4th and gets beaten by a Microsoft virus on Independence Day.\" For Free Willy was, \"young Orca or Killer Whale is taken from the ocean and forced to perform in a dolphin tank, until forming a bond with troublemaker teenager and becoming close friends, with assistance from caring park workers frees the trapped whale.\"\n\nKevin continues to claim Independence Day and Free Willy was also fake to the point that I had to go and suggest that he go and watch the movies himself, so he can see for himself that I'm not lying about these old movies, I still like watching these movies whenever it shows on TV cause I haven't been able to find them on DVD and since my parents don't like watching Blu Ray movies either.\n\nTl;dr Kevin claims I made up 80-90s flim, after failing to guess them","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1677340838.0},{"title":"One of my classmates is definitely a Kevina","author":"TVforReddit","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/1194igp\/one_of_my_classmates_is_definitely_a_kevina\/","text":"Alright, let's see if I can make this as entertaining as some of the things y'all post.\n\nIt was the first week of school, and the discussion section of one of my classes was meeting. The class, by the way, was a 300-level film workshop at a well-known research university. It was all about storytelling for film, and had a few prerequisites that essentially made it impossible to take it before second-semester of your Sophomore year. Basically, you have to be *really* into the film track to be taking this class, and you should know your shit by then.\n\nThe discussion section was pretty small, just about 13 or 14 people, and the TA began by giving an overview of the class, then said \"we're going to watch a few shorts, pay attention to how the plot is developed, explored, and resolved in just a few minutes.\" Nothing out of the ordinary here.\n\nEnter: Kevina. Her hand shoots up, and she asks, \"what's a short? Is that like a trailer?\"\n\nI don't think I even need to explain how baffled the TA was by that question, but hey, maybe it was an off-day for Kevina.\n\nCut to: the next class. We're reviewing the guidelines for our first project, which involves writing a 5-10 page script with no more than two characters, and only one location. Pretty simple stuff. Kevina's question? \"Can we have a story where the character is dreaming about all these different places and people, so there are more than two people and one location, but not in reality?\" The TA says no, the guidelines are strict. Kevina thinks for a moment, then raises her hand again. \"Can we write a script about basketball?\" \n\nThis became a bit of a theme over the next few classes, as Kevina would ask the TA *during class time* some very, very specific questions. These included:\n\n- How long should a film title be?\n- How do I introduce my characters?\n- What is good dialogue?\n- What is a nickname for Chloe?\n\nMassive props to the TA for answering all of these questions helpfully and with a straight face. Unfortunately, the TA wasn't the only one in the room, because during class, we also workshopped other people's scripts. Kevina's feedback wasn't always bad, it was just... unhelpful.\n\nTake one script about a bird and a dog, which I happened to think was beautifully written and needed no notes. Kevina's feedback was, \"I think you should tell us what type of bird it is.\" Mind you, the script described the bird as blue, and also, *we're workshopping story and pacing, not bird species.* Other feedback included:\n\n- You should tell us what his job is (the script was about a couple fighting after the wife cheated)\n- The doctor's name is too complicated (it was Dr. Garabedian)\n- This scene reminds me of E.T.! Or was it Wall-E? (none of us had any clue what she meant)\n- I don't understand what's going on in this script (given as feedback at least five times)\n\nShe also asked the TA point-blank what to do if she didn't like the script but also didn't have any suggestions how to make it better. Yeesh.\n\nAnyways, that's everything I can remember. Maybe more will come to mind, but for now, I hope you enjoyed the stories of Kevina, the Film & TV major who seems to know nothing about film.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1677084286.0},{"title":"He Wants to DNA Test Her Kids","author":"Alkuna","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/118nxqd\/he_wants_to_dna_test_her_kids\/","text":"So... I can't even completely wrap my brain around this Kevin, but when my friend \"Sage\" told me this story, I just HAD to get her permission to post it here. She gave it, so here we go. Fair warning, I fear the number of IQ points that may be lost in reading this...\n\nSage started dating Kevin about two years before this incident. Things seemed to be going all right between them. She told me he was a bit of a derp and sometimes incredibly oblivious to some things. He couldn't pick up subtle cues, and even suggestions flew over his head with about a mile of airspace between his skull and the suggestion. She originally chalked it up to him being on the autism spectrum, as she has a few other friends who have similar problems picking up cues. So she just switched her behavior from \"talking to neurotypical\" to \"talking to neurodivergent\" and the bumps smoothed out for a while.\n\nAll is well and good.\n\nThen the talk of taking the relationship seriously came up. Marriage. Becoming a family.\n\nAnd that's when the plane hit the mountain with a cartoonish bang.\n\nKevin announced that he wanted to DNA test Sage's kids. To make sure they were his. Kids who were 5 and 3 when Sage and Kevin started dating.\n\nSage said she had to come to a full stop in the conversation for several seconds while her brain rebooted.\n\nSage: \"They're NOT your kids. You know they're not. My ex-husband and I had them together before I ever met you.\"\n\n(She had still been pregnant with the youngest when she and her ex had finalized the divorce. Whole other story.)\n\nKevin: \"Yeah, and now that we're getting married, they'll become mine. I just want to DNA test them to be sure of it.\"\n\nSage: \"Let me see if I understand this... Do you..... do you actually think my children's DNA will..... change... to become biologically yours when you adopt them?\"\n\nKevin: \"Obviously. I just want the confirmation on paper is all.\"\n\n\\[insert That'sNotHowThisWorksThat'sNotHowAnyOfThisWorks meme here\\]\n\nThere was a long conversation about how DNA didn't work that way, with his rebuttal that adopting them would make them BECOME his. Then there had to be a conversation that becoming his children would only happen on paper, and in the legal system. That no, the children would NOT magically transform into his own biological children once the paperwork was filled out. Him insisting that EVERYBODY said the kids became theirs once adoption happened. Her explaining the concept of \"adopted children are loved just as much as if they were biological\" and that was what that meant. Him insisting that everything pointed to kids BECOMING \"theirs.\"\n\nHis mom eventually had to become involved to back Sage up. His DAD had to become involved to back Sage up. A few books had to get involved to back Sage up.\n\nKevin was furious! He couldn't understand why people would EVER adopt a kid if the kid didn't \"become\" the actual, biological child of the people who took them in. How stupid and selfish it was, for kids to retain the DNA of the sperm\/egg donor! How could any kid who wanted to be adopted REFUSE to change one little thing so they could have parents?! \"DNA doesn't work that way\" is a bullshit excuse!\n\nHe ranted. He raved, and right in front of his own parents, he told her that if her kids weren't going to become his kids, then the marriage wasn't going to happen.\n\nHe told her that he would give them all a week to change their minds and agree to be his biological kids. He said WHEN they stopped being selfish, and WHEN the DNA test proved it, he would take the kids in.\n\nSage to me: \"And that's how the relationship ended.\"\n\nMe: \"Uhhhh, wait, hang on, was he just looking for an excuse to break it off? Did he just get cold feet or want to date around some more or....?\"\n\nSage: \"Nope. He really is just that stupid. His mom called me on the sly and very gently suggested that I just break it off with Kevin, because no matter how much she and his dad talk to him, he's adamant about it. He's even saying that he will NEVER date a woman with kids from here on out unless they agree to change their DNA to become his if the relationship becomes serious.\"\n\nSo Sage is single again, having dodged a tactical nuke.

He was a Salesthing.  Not a Salesperson, nor even a Salescritter.\n\nTo begin, I tend to categorize Sales staff into three groups.  **Salespeople** understand what their organization can provide, and what prospective clients need, and put the two together.  Everyone wins.  Then there are **Salescritters**, whose understanding is poor, or who simply don't care.  Their only interest is in making a sale, regardless of what the client actually needs, then moving on to the next.  They leave a trail of expense and ill will in their wake.  Finally, there are **Salesthings**, who don't grasp what physical law permits, and promise the literally impossible.  They create confusion and can cause tremendous harm to an organization.\n\nI don't know how Cary got hired, or why he was kept on.  To this day, all I've got is bizarre speculation about nefarious doings.\n\nAt one point, he claimed to have been the creator of the American Express Gold card \u2014 that is, the basic concept of tiered credit card systems.  Given his situation, this seemed implausible.  His role in the company, on evidence, was to attend meetings with prospective clients, sit in the back while presentations and discussions took place, then pipe up with suggestions and questions that made him look ludicrously foolish.  And, by extension, made the company look incompetent.\n\nI was told that once, some of the guys in the company took him out to a strip club, where he proceeded to get seriously drunk.  At the end of the evening, they found him passed out in the washroom, wrapped around a toilet.  And they left him there.  I gather that when it comes to public toilets being rated for grossness, those in strip clubs tend to score high.  Cary was not well-liked around the office.\n\nThe year was 1998 or 1999.  Y2K was looming, and the company's main business was supposed to be Y2K remediation.  We had a suite of tools, contractors, and connections, and we were to work with clients to analyze their software systems.  We were to find and fix any instances where 2-digit year values \u2014 for example, \"98\" to represent \"1998\" \u2014 might lead to errors when the year rolled over to \"00\".  It was a real problem, and the fact that so few problems arose on January 1, 2000, is a tribute to all of the preventative work that was done before that day.\n\nMy own job was secondary to that, a computer chemistry research project that was to be funded by the proceeds of the Y2K contracts.  It was supposed to be a longer-term goal for the company, a reason to exist beyond 1999.  So while most of the staff worked out in the nice offices with big exterior windows for the clients to see, I was stuck in a back room with the electronic junk and everything else that needed to be tucked away.  Well, at least I didn't have to wear business attire.\n\nOne afternoon, Cary came to visit me in the back room, extremely excited.  I greeted him with wariness.  Excited Cary usually meant trouble.\n\n\"You're a chemist, right?\" he burbled.\n\n\"Yeees..?\"  Occasionally my colleagues have had chemistry questions to ask.  Some of them are even work-related, such as \"how do I get this glue residue off the equipment?\" or \"how can I get white-board ink out of my nice jacket?\"  I'm always happy to contribute my expertise, such as it is.  I miss working in my field.\n\n\"I was talking with a potential client, okay?  It would be a really big contract, like a million dollars, and like ten percent of that could go to your project, right?  But it's a chemistry problem.\"\n\n\"Liiike what?\"  This did not sound like a Y2K matter.  Which was what he was supposed to be making deals on.\n\n\"They're a mining exploration company, okay?  Which means that they have to do a lot of digging and blasting through rock.  And that's really environmentally destructive, right?  And expensive?  So I told them that maybe we could come up with a chemical which they could just pour on the rock and make it dissolve away, okay?  So that would be faster and easier, and wouldn't cause the environmental damage, right?  So can you invent a chemical like that?\"\n\nI looked at him.  I was reminded of when I was first studying chemistry, when I told people around my own age what I was doing.  Half of them would say \"ewww, I hate chemistry\", and half would say \"oh, can you make drugs?\"  (These days, it's much more biased towards \"I hate chemistry\".)  Maybe he'd been watching too many \"Aliens\" movies, with magic \"molecular acid\" that made solid materials just dissolve and disappear?\n\nSo I tried to explain to him that rocks have a *reputation for durability* that is not unwarranted.  (In much smaller words than that, of course.)  I explained that though there are some minerals which can be dissolved fairly easily, most can't.  Any mineral can be dissolved, but for most, it takes pretty extreme chemical conditions, and the rock has to be finely powdered and heated, and even then the process isn't fast.  And this stuff is much more environmentally harmful than a bit of digging and blasting.\n\nI told him that I'd try to find some contact info for people who were doing research on cutting through rock using extremely high-pressure water jets.  At the time, it was a relatively new field, though now it's pretty mainstream.  The process has some big advantages over classical digging methods in terms of speed and tool maintenance.  I felt a bit guilty about dumping Cary on them, but I needed to divert him from any more stupid things he might try to lay on my shoulders.\n\nThe company went bust a few months later.  I don't think they ever completed a big contract, though there were a few small ones: process evaluations and the like.  When final paycheques and records of employment were handed out, Cary was peeved that all of the other salespeople got commissions and he didn't.  He didn't understand that commissions came from landing contracts.  In all his time with the company, he'd never gotten one.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1676871244.0},{"title":"my assistant manager is.... interesting","author":"ComfortableResort910","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/10z6qif\/my_assistant_manager_is_interesting\/","text":"so I work at a thrift store and my store assistant manager dress coded me for wearing a skirt.

What company are you looking for?\n\nKevin: It\u2019s from [company]\n\nMe: And where\u2019s it going?\n\nKevin: [Street name]\n\nMe: There\u2019s ten different companies on this street.

You need to tell me where it\u2019s going. \n\nKevin: I have a phone number, I will call it\n\n\nAt this point, I looked at the package in the back of the van - it had a delivery docket inside a plastic pouch stuck on the outside. This delivery docket had on prominent display \u201cDELIVER TO [company name (let\u2019s say it\u2019s Fucken Awesome Irrigation)], [person\u2019s name], [Mobile phone number] and the address was given as \u2018c\/o [Street name]\u2019\u201d.

No, Kevin did not; Kevin was continuing to not do anything to help himself to get the package to its intended recipient.\n\nNow, clearly visible on the street just the other side of the car park was a crew of workers laying pipe along the side of said street; Kevin had driven past these workers to end up in front of me.

I am convinced either she is a Kevina, just has brain damage (she was in a car accident and apprently \\[tho her memory isnt good\\] they didnt do a brain scan but she did hurt her hip in it), or both.\n\nIm 21, turning 22. she will be turning 21. She is a business major, so kinda confused on some of these things. some things that she has done or someone been oblvious about:\n\n\\-didn't know how u make ramen (she thought u put the ramen in the microwave? idk with or without water)\n\n\\- she somehow didn't know what chernobyl is. like. she thought it was a person when i mentioned it, (we were talking about how some deaths are more painful, and i mentioned Hisashi Ouchi, the man from the Tokaimura nuclear accident from 1999.)\n\n\\-she didnt know what radiation poisoning\/burns\/injuries are. or what radiation is??\n\n\\-she asked, in 1 convo a week ago, repeatedly, if the email we got for a dorm meeting said something. or where it said it. I had to repeatedly say that no it didn't, but at least one person of the dorm should go if all cant.\n\n\\-I am trans, and last year for a week or two EVERY DAY when eating she would ask how HRT works, and the bottom growth (ftm, if u take testosterone it makes a realllly small growth depending the strength of T)\n\n\\-She later refused to admit she had asked that multiple times, claiming that she would remember if she did.\n\n\\-she has repeatedly asked if she could bring some cat food from her home for my cat, and I get forgetting and all but you can only forget a cat doesn't eat that type of food for so long. she has known this cat since last year. he has not changed.\n\n\\-I have a beanie i wear when its colder out. she has seen me outside. She somehow SUDDENLY noticed i have a hat like 2 days ago. and a coat?? when i've been using it since last month.\n\n\\-she claims to have good memory. but that is just her quoting the same memories when things vaguely similar happen. including without giving ppl context and doing voice imitations. Very easily this could jsut sound like her being weird or an ass cus one of the imitations is basically about her aunt saying a worker wont get a tip. She will imitate whatever the hell right after what happened reminded her of it.\n\n\\-We went abroad in the summer, and when walking with her a whole ass man just looked her up and down (she is taller than me but she is so skinny she wears essentially kid sizes) and she refused to believe that RIGHT NEXT TO HER a man just eyed her up like a piece of meat.\n\n\\-friends that are younger than me did get taught about Chernobyl, and i remember being taught about it.\n\n\\-She only apparently learned how to type like last year????? We both went to private schools, she stayed at one longer than I. But i KNOW my school made us learn the \"touch-type\" method (not looking at the keys, have ur hands at a placement to reach all the keys)\n\n\\-I have a cat in the dorm, the way she tries to pet the cat reminds me of a kid. who is trying to fist grab or pinch the cat. and also after MULTIPLE TIMES mentioning my cat hates being picked up (even by me) she still tried to do so in the most awkward way.\n\n\\-My cat doesn't like movement but most ppl he isn't weary of. She is the one person it took like 5 times for him not to run from her, and that was AFTER he had known her the year before and wasn't 100% weary of her before break. and he still looks like a deer in headlights when she tries to pet him.\n\n\\-she has no idea how to hold any animals. like she loves animals but Her trying to pick up or pet a bunny gave me so much concern for the animal.\n\n\\-everytime anyone is sick slightly, buys anything for being sick or feeling sick (cough drops, the rapid covid tests the school hands out etc) she like. the first thought is \"do you have covid?\" as if us having covid is the only reason, and WHY WOULD BE NOT BE IN ISOLATION IF WE TESTED POSITIVE.\n\n\\-last time she did the accusingly covid statement, she was literally coughing like she was dying.\n\nIDK if its from the past car incident (she was walking across the street, not driving) and she calls doctors quacks so i wouldn't (even if i had money) be able to convince her to see someone about that.\n\nbesides concern, it kinda just annoys me cause I can only repeat information for so long before I get outright peeved. I hate repetition, like its a weird tick thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I know it might seem like i am making fun of her, but those are mostly observations. I don't usually interact with her much and i don't hold a lot of the things she forgets against her, i just try to reiterate the same info i gave her before and walk her through it again. While i try not to judge her for the lapses, i also don't fully trust her with more important things and just end up doing it myself. Her accident is more than 5 years ago so if it was caused by that then i don't know if it will change, heal, or anything. She kinda just goes to someone else and grumbles about me when i tell her I genuinely think she has some memory problems she should look into *( she ig thinks that since most her long term memory is fine\\[aka the 5 or so specific memories and imitations she reiterates on a weekly basis\\], it means her memory generally is fine).*\n\nMost of the concern is for her health and future endeavors in life, as she plans to work in an industry that won't be as forgiving if she doesn't remember something from the day before or based off an assignment given. My brain wants to worry about other peoples futures even if I cant help them. Some of it is because we share a dorm, so whatever she leaves on, doesn't close properly, or breaks or uses incorrectly can be charged to all of us to have it fixed. \n\nI plan to go low contact with her after college, also cus she is moving to another area of the USA anyhow after college. \n\n&#x200B;","upvote_ratio":0.68,"created_utc":1675618577.0},{"title":"I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m a Kevin","author":"LoisLaneEl","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/10qhy7a\/im_pretty_sure_im_a_kevin\/","text":"As I read through these, I sadly think of more ways that I\u2019m a Kevin. A few examples of my idiocy\u2026\n\nWhen I was 14, my brother and I went through the woods in our backyard to go to a playground in the neighboring neighborhood. He took the long way back, but I was too tired so I went back through the woods. A spider landed on me and I freaked out and realized that I was lost. I started crying and screamed HELP at the top of my lungs for about 10 minutes. Finally someone came out of their house and helped me. It was a man who lived two houses down from me. I was about 15 feet from the edge of the trees and literally two houses away. \n\nWhen I was 15 one of my friends made Kraft Mac and cheese for me for the first time and it was amazing. I wasn\u2019t good with a stove, so I found easy Mac. I read the directions and still did not make it right. It was inedible. Back to Stouffer\u2019s for me. \n\nWhen I was 16, my brother took me to dinner for his last night before going of college. We\u2019re sitting there eating dinner like normal teenagers when mid-bite I drop my food. \u201cChicken don\u2019t have fingers. What the hell am I eating?\u201d\n\nAlso at 16, I would get terribly drunk. Knowing I couldn\u2019t drive, I would have my 14 year old friends drive my brand new car because they were too young to drink(in my mind). The only thing they\u2019d ever driven were golf carts around the country club. Somehow there were never any wrecks. \n\n30 years old, my best friend of 2 years goes to the tanning bed so often that they offer her a job and she starts working there. There\u2019s a bunch of skin cancer in my family, so I worry and want to talk to her. \u201cJenny, you are, like, 8 shades past my pasty ass, are you sure you need to keep tanning?\u201d \u201cOP, you know I\u2019m Mexican, right?\u201d No. No, I did not. First generation Mexican-American. Like, born in the US, but both parents were born and now are both back in Mexico. I just assumed she was bilingual because she was super smart. \n\nJust this Christmas I was wrapping gifts. My dog kept barking and pissing me off. I walked to the front of the house where she normally would be and  she wasn\u2019t there and she stopped barking. I went back to wrapping. She started barking again and I went to the back and she wasn\u2019t there and quit barking. I once again went back to wrapping. She started barking again. By now it had been 20 minutes and she was pissing me off. I searched the whole damn house and she was no where. Waking through the kitchen a glimmer caught my eye. She was on the back porch. I have no idea how she got outside. There were no doors open and she was inside when I started wrapping. I was home alone and every door was locked. She is not allowed outside alone because she runs away. The only way she got outside is by me and to this day I have no recollection of doing this. \n\nThat\u2019s all I\u2019ve got for now, but I\u2019ve been a pretty big dumbass through the years.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1675218222.0},{"title":"Lunch time Kevin","author":"Queasy_Butterfly_335","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/10olef4\/lunch_time_kevin\/","text":"I have only just found this sub, and have been reading many stories, thinking, \"wow - this sounds exactly like my ex\"  \n\n\nMany years ago, I was engaged to a Kevin. We had just purchased our first home, and money was tight.   \n\n\nWe sat down together to try to find areas where we could save money. One of our biggest expenses was buying lunch while at work. He was spending close to $20 a day on lunch, and I was spending nearly the same.   \n\n\nWe decided that I would prepare lunches for each of us to take to work. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI purchased lunch bags and drink bottles, and then we planned the food. He asked for Ham, Cheese and tomato sandwiches.\n\nI was purchasing chicken and beef for sandwiches or preparing small meals I could put in the microwave. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne thing to note - I am highly allergic to Ham. Each morning I would get up, and prepare my food. Then I would put gloves on, prepare Kevin's food, and pack it for him, and he would take it to work. \n\nEvery time I asked him what he wanted - or if he wanted some of the leftover roast chicken and veg for lunch, I would get a \"no thanks, Just 2 ham, cheese and tomato sandwiches\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter a couple of months, I noticed that I had been putting more money into our savings, but Kevin didn't seem to be saving any extra. He was a mechanic and earned less money than me, so I thought that might be it.   \n\n\nOne day when I had the day off from work, he rang me - he had left his medication at home. So I got it, and drove down to his work. I walked into the workshop, Kevin wasn't there, and one of the other mechanics called out \"Oh look - its Mrs Ham Cheese and Tomato\" and then the mechanics all started laughing.   \n\n\nI asked him \"what does that mean?\" He replied, \"That's all Kevin ever brings in for lunch haha\". I said \"Yeah - that's all he ever asks for. I ask him every day - and he only ever wants Ham Cheese and Tomato\"   \n\n\nThe mechanic then proceeds to that every day at lunch time, Kevin opens his lunch bag up, and says 'not another f%&king ham cheese and tomato sandwich\" throws it in the bin, and then walks to the shop to buy a burger, fries, some pie, and a milkshake.   \n\n\nKevin then arrived, holding his lunch, which he tried to hide when he saw me. I gave him his meds, and then left.   \n\n\nWhen I spoke to him at home that night, he explained that he didn't want to 'hurt my feelings' and not ask for lunch. I explained to him that I was spending a lot of money on his lunch, and time preparing it, he said \"but you were already making your own lunch - so its not like it costs more\". I told him I was buying $20 worth of ham a week - which was 100% for him. That is $20 I could be saving from not buying it.   \n\n\nHe didn't understand and kept saying \"but you were already making your own lunch - there was no extra cost\".  \n\n\nI stopped making him lunches after that.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1675033055.0},{"title":"I worked for a Kevin","author":"SilentJoe27","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/10nwus0\/i_worked_for_a_kevin\/","text":"Sorry, in advance this turned out to be a bit long.\n\nThis was several years ago. A co-worker from my time at the movie theater hooked me up with what ended up being my first desk job. On the day I was supposed to come in, he sent me a text warning me about the boss.\n\nI wasn't sure what to expect. His description of the guy was pretty cryptic. It wasn't until I made my way into the guy's office that I understood what I was dealing with. The Kevin in question. The first glance of his office gave me all I needed to know. Hunting trophies covered every wall of the office. Deer heads, turkeys, foxes, even a coyote. Then I took a good look at Kevin himself, standing there in a pair of jeans and a camo shirt. He looked like Scut Farkus from A Christmas Story, minus the coonskin hat. He even had the laugh. Having grown up in Kentucky myself, I knew exactly what kind of guy he was. This was going to be interesting.\n\nAs it turned out, I was replacing a guy who we'll call Ken. Ken used to work in our position some time before I got there. He was apparently a massive deadweight, but was a friend of Kevin's (and dealt him weed). He ended up getting fired by the other boss over an attendance related issue. The guy who helped me get the job actually painted an abstract picture he called \"The Ghost of Ken\" and hung it up over where he used to sit as a charm of sorts to keep him from returning. That didn't work. As soon as another position opened up, Kevin decided to hire Ken back, convinced he had learned and would do better. That didn't work either. Ken quit after a couple of weeks entirely out of spite, stating if he was going to leave a job, it would be on his own terms.\n\nDiscussing politics at work is always an awkward issue. Kevin always made it even more so. In his mind, if you voted Democrat, you were an idiot. We used to get copies of Rolling Stone in the office, that is until one day, he was going through one of the issues, and saw an article on climate change, and angrily ripped up the magazine and threw it away.\n\nKevin didn't have much in the way of sensitivity. If he had to fire a someone and they cried, he would be laughing to others, or if someone was getting their wages garnished, he would announce it to anyone in their vicinity. He also had a fiery temper. If he was angry, you could hear him shouting about something or to someone from across the hall. It was always awkward. I always kept my nose down, so I was never on the receiving end. Consequently, I think it cost me from getting promoted the whole time I worked there. Couldn't complain to HR about it though. He was HR.\n\nHe was also a massive stoner. I had quickly learned that if I wanted a favor or time off, the best time to ask him was right after lunch when he would come back after getting high. Going to get high at lunch did cause a bit of a problem. He ended up coming back to work with the munchies one day, and decided to warm up a donut. You know how on boxes of store-bought Krispie Kreme, it says on the box to throw it in the microwave for three seconds to replicate the feeling of a fresh donut? Well, he was so baked, he left it in the microwave for three minutes. We never could get rid of that burnt smell from the microwave.\n\nEventually, Kevin ended up hiring his little brother to work in the same position as me. This guy was a sad sack. I legit felt sorry for him as he was getting out of a messy divorce resulting in him losing rights to see his daughter. That said, I noticed Kevin would constantly pick on him. Calling him a loser and just overall giving him a hard time. I later found out this had been their relationship their whole lives. His brother also had a tendency to get distracted. There were more than a few times where I would be stuck in our room getting backed up with work only to find Kevin had his brother in his office doing a jam session. I was nearly tempted to walk out at one point.\n\nWARNING: The following story is not for the fainthearted. \n\nOne day a co-worker informed me that he saw a rat in the office. It ran off as soon as it saw him but now Kevin was on pursuit.\n\n\"Oh God...\" I replied. \"I kinda feel bad for the rat.\"\n\nSince the rat never turned up where I was, I just went about with my work until I hear a faint, high-pitched squeak from the opposite end of the office. About 30 seconds later, Kevin strutted in my room, proud as a peacock and said, \"Hey! SilentJoe27! Check out what I just caught!\" He then whipped out a glue trap with a freshly decapitated rat stuck to it!\n\n\"GAAAHHH!\" I yelled. \"Why the hell did you show me that?!\" He never answered, just went off to show off the rat to another unsuspecting co-worker.\n\nI was eventually let go from that job due to cutbacks, and was forced to return to the theater until I could find something with better pay in the meantime. Never burn your bridges, folks. A few months later, I got a call from Kevin asking if I wanted to come back in a different position. After everything I went through with that job, 4 years, no promotion, no raise, and ultimately let go so his brother, who was less qualified could stay on. Saying \"no\" never felt so good. A few people who still worked there even told me I was lucky to be out of there.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1674960179.0},{"title":"Kitchen Kevin Pt. 3: The Maddening","author":"CadmiumCurd","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/10lyi1v\/kitchen_kevin_pt_3_the_maddening\/","text":"Well, people, it's been a while (work and life get in the way). Some of you may remember my past dealings with other Kevins in professional kitchens, but let me say that those were nothing. In the meantime, I've been both blessed and cursed to meet THE Kevin. \n\nThe Kevinest, the one Kevin to misrule them all, the ultimate super-Kevin third level with a power of incompetence of over 9 trillions.\n\nLet's begin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\u201cThe most irritating thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the Kevin mind to correlate all its contents. They live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that they should voyage far. The common sense, straining in its own direction, has hitherto harmed them little.\u201d* \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA LITTLE BACKGROUND\n\nThe combination of Brexit and lockdowns has had serious effects on the food and drink industry among others, and workers have been very difficult to find, leading to most retail points being understaffed, and many reopening partially (as in, open bar but no kitchen), never reopening at all for lack of employees, and in some cases even opening, struggling to make ends meet and ending up being closed up and sold off.In other words, especially when getting near Christmas, which is the busiest season of the year, every company is pretty much desperate for personnel and will hire anyone and anything no question asked (you could probably be an insane cannibal showing up for an interview wearing no pants and chewing on a human leg and all the manager would say would be \"can you start monday?\")\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHE SETTING OF THE TRAGEDY\n\nSmall-ish gastropub in central London, tiny kitchen, but very busy with food especially in the months right before Christmas season.We've been looking for people for months with no success, so when THE Kevin showed up he got hired pretty much on the spot. \n\nConsider that by the time Big K came in the kitchen has been severely understaffed for months, running with only one full-time chef (yours truly) and two kitchen-trained bartenders alternating shifts between front and back of house.\n\nTHE MAN, THE LEGEND, THE INSANITY\n\nHe was on the older side, honestly made a good first impression, likeable and sociable, seemed eager and had worked in the same company before (a big plus, means a candidate will not need to be trained from scratch as basic training like health and safety, fire safety and so on are the same).He came in shortly before I went on my holiday (I always get some rest before the big push in winter, it gets VERY stressful), anyway my FOH colleagues were both veterans and he already had his basic training done so it's just learning the kitchen layout and memorizing the menu, nothing major, right?\n\nI come back after my vacation and find my colleague (who was also the holding manager at the time) at her wits' end and pretty much wanting his head on a platter. For reasons that will become clear shortly.Ok, calm down, I say, maybe he just needs to be trained again, I'll do as many shifts as possible with him and re-train him from scratch.Two weeks later \\*I\\* wanted his head on a platter and a truckload of parsnips covered in hot chilli peppers wedged up his rectal cavity.\n\n\"I don't think I've ever been so wrong, we need to get rid of this <expletive deleted> of a <genital reference> before he drives all of us insane\"\n\n\"er, well, there's a new manager coming in to take over and I don't really want to put him in front of a done deed, seems rude\"\n\nOk then, let's hold on to the wanker for a little longer.\n\nNew manager comes in, we talk about the situation (it's about middle November by now, Christmas season is behind the corner), he's worried we might be understaffed at Xmas so he decides to hold on at least until the season is finished.\n\nOne month later, in the middle of December, with bookings left and right, Kevin finally gets fired. It has been too much even for the new manager.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nOk, I admit that was to make you wonder exactly what in the everloving fuck this guy has done.\n\nBut that's for your mental wellbeing, my dear readers, so you would have some time to prepare yourself for the abysmal show of a grown man who reached maturity without even encountering the concept of common sense once in his life.\n\nSo, please, sit down, put down your drink to avoid spitting it at your screen, take off your hat if you wear one because you'll scratch your head repeatedly, and if you are or ever have been a kitchen worker, I strongly suggest you tie a pillow on your forehead so you don't hurt yourself when you'll feel the urge of smashing it into the closest wall.\n\nLet the madness begin.\n\nTHE CHRONICLES OF KEVIN THE DESTROYER OF SANITY\n\nKevin has no concept of multitasking. A ticket is a list to be done in order, completely, from start to finish, with no overlapping.\n\nFor example, let's say you get table 2 ordering a fish and chips, a fish finger sandwich with chips and a portion of chips, in that order. \n\nOh, by the way, for you people on the other side of the Atlantic, chips in the UK are the big fat potato fries, fries are your regular french fries and crisps are what you call chips.\n\nA sane chef would drop three portions of chips, a battered fish and fish fingers, then toast the bread and prepare the plating. Total time for the ticket, the time to cook the fish through, about 6-7 minutes.\n\nNot Kevin.\n\nKevin was probably afraid to anger the gods if he done more than one thing at a time, so what he would have done was:\n\nDrop the fish.\n\nWait for it to cook.\n\nTake it out.\n\nDrop ONE portion of chips.\n\nWait.\n\nTake them out.\n\nPrepare the plate for the fish and chips.\n\nPlate it.\n\nDrop the fish fingers.\n\nWait.\n\nTake them out.\n\nDrop ONE portion of chips.\n\nWait.\n\nTake them out.\n\nToast the bread.\n\nPut the fish fingers in the bread.\n\nPrepare the plate.\n\nPlate the sandwich.\n\nDrop ONE portion of chips.\n\nWait.\n\nTake them out.\n\nPrepare the bowl.\n\nPlate the chips in the bowl.\n\nCall for a waiter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTotal approximate time for the ticket: whatever, too fucking long. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nKevin also had his own concept of portioning, which is to say ALMOST at random: he would put a cubic fuckton of fries on a plate and three chips in number on the plate next to it. I say almost because, *oddly enough*, he would always overportion fish, a LOT. Why? 'Cause the cheeky cunt thought he got to eat the extra fish for free. I realized that a certain point and did a little experiment: one day we got two portions of fish fingers on order, so I asked Kevin to drop two portions... and lo and behold, he dropped FIVE. That was over two months in, by the way. Anyway, instead of letting him have the extra three portions, I threw them in the bin straight away and looked at him. He was pouting like a child that didn't get the candy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKevin also had no concept of quality: if something existed in the kitchen, it was Good Enough. I don't need to tell you that sometimes things get ruined by accident, in that case you just throw them away and write them off as waste. Not Kevin, though. Kevin would take a smashed burger bun that's literally falling apart and serve it, even if it looks like a dog chewed on it.  \n\n\nKevin also applied his policy to pot wash, loading the dishwasher with three or four plates tops, making it run, and doing absolutely nothing in the meantime.\n\nOh, sometimes he wouldn't feel like actually, you know, washing the dishes, so he would just hide the dirty dishes between the clean ones.\n\nPreps?   \nDear cooks, chefs and kitchen workers in general, have you EVER seen a man prepare 12 portions of salad ONE AT A TIME?\n\nHave you ever seen a man take FOUR HOURS to close down? And by close down I mean clean the surfaces, wash the dishes, put away tools and mop the floor after turning everything off?\n\nKevin would also complain, complain all the time about everything. He wanted free food, he wanted front of house to clean the kitchen for him, he wanted the other kitchen staff to do preps and service in his place. He didn't want to do double shifts, didn't want to do solo shifts, didn't want to open, didn't want to close down. Pretty much he wanted to be paid for the pleasure of his company.\n\nKevin would also not accept any kind of responsibility or request for improvement. Not his fault for anything, it was. Always someone else's.\n\n(Example: he doesn't do any preps, so you ask him why and he says, nobody told me to. Ok then, you make a list and put it on the pass. He still does nothing on it, you ask him why and he says he didn't see it. Ok then, let's write another list and FUCKING GLUE IT ON THE FUCKING PASS. I'm talking about an A4 sheet stuck between the shelves with duct tape like a curtain right in the fucking middle. Not even a blind cyclops would miss it. Kevin doesn't do ANYTHING on the list and when confronted he says... I didn't know it was meant for me. DESPITE HAVING HIS FUCKING NAME IN CAPITAL LETTERS RIGHT ON TOP.)\n\nHe would also rant and go on some absolutely bonkers conspiracy theories. My favorite is the one about him being almost ran over by Iraqi terrorists because back in the '90s he wrote a letter to Tony Blair advocating in favor of participation to the Gulf War.\n\nThe final act of this memorable trainwreck of a man consists in three exploits, of which two in the same day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWOLLT IHR DAS KEVIN IN FLAMMEN SEHEN\n\nImagine if you will a busy gastropub in the middle of Xmas season, during lunch rush, two bookings of about 20 people each just came in and the fucking delivery that got so late it's unloading shit right in the middle. My fellow cooks and chefs will understand, for all the others let me just say that this shit is the stuff that nightmares are made of.   \nWe got into emergency mode straight away: new manager handling service, holding manager on the pass, me slamming the fucking delivery away and dropping shit on the cookers and fryers in between runs (later on they made a bit of fun of me saying I looked kinda like the cartoon tazmanian devil). And Kevin? Well, Kevin was... standing around. You ask him to do something, he would move VERY slowly, waste time, or just blabber away and ignore it.\n\nLater in the evening, we got another booking, but as it was confirmed kinda late and in the chaos of the time the kitchen rota wasn't amended, so Kevin was scheduled to finish right when the booking was coming in. Now, in this business an unwritten rule is: don't leave your mates in the shit if you don't want to be left in the shit yourself. Guess what, Kevin, that has already been of absolutely no use during lunch, insisted he was scheduled to finish early and he wanted to finish early. At this point I lost my temper and told him to fuck off and that he's useless. Not even five minutes later my other colleague, the kitchen trained FOH, came in the kitchen, got changed and helped me out without anyone even asking him anything. Fucking legend, that man.\n\nBooking done, I have a chat with the manager and put straight away that this is fucking enough and I don't want to see Kevin alive or dead ever again. \n\nNow at this point there's been a flood of cancellations due to a resurgence of Covid, the Omicron variant IIRC, so the next day we decided to keep the kitchen closed and myself and another colleague from another pub would have gone to a third pub to help them out with their own bookings since they were short staffed (head chef got Covid if i remember correctly). Kevin wasn't noticed of this, planning on having a chat with him as soon as he came in and fire him.\n\nBut everyone underestimated Kevin's laziness, it seems.\n\nHe did know I was in the other pub so he would have had to do a double (not alone though).\n\nSo he called in sick.\n\nThe day after he got the talk anyways and as as predicted he tried to blame everyone else but himself for everything and trying to paint himself as the victim.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHE ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE MINDLESS KEVIN\n\nSome time after, talking with the other coworkers, we all realized that oddly enough Kevin had got worse instead of improving with time, but something felt off, like he was deliberately fucking up on purpose. The most popular theory was that, being a lazy cunt, he was actually doing that hoping someone else would get so exasperated as to take over and do his job for him.\n\nMe, I got the impression I was dealing with an overgrown , lazy, spoiled man-child. And before you ask, no, I don't know if he actually had any mental problems. I doubt it anyway, there was too much method in his stupidity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, that's it, dear readers: enjoy it if you will and be sure to offer thanks to all supernatural entities you may worship that you have never had to deal with the final form of human incompetence.\n\nFarewell and have a good night, all.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1674757113.0},{"title":"Your storie","author":"Minute-Store7135","url":"\/r\/TourStory\/comments\/10mmgxp\/your_storie\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.19,"created_utc":1674830580.0},{"title":"Hospital Kevin breaks a doctor\u2019s arm and nearly gets attacked by an unruly patient","author":"King-Rex420","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/10gq68r\/hospital_kevin_breaks_a_doctors_arm_and_nearly\/","text":"(This takes place in Australia BTW) \nSo my Dad works at a hospital as a \u201cTech aid\u201d (basically he moves the beds around the hospital), there\u2019s a man in his department who\u2019s a total Kevin. To give you a picture of this guy, Kevin is a an out of shape Siri Lankan man in his 50\u2019s. I mention his race because Kevin doesn\u2019t seem to fully comprehend what people are saying. I can\u2019t tell if he genuinely has poor English skills or if he\u2019s pretending to not understand so he doesn\u2019t get in trouble. You\u2019ll see going forward why this matters.\n\nStory 1: The unruly patient.                                                                                                   \n\nWhile most of the patients at the hospital are mentally stable, some of them might have serious mental health problems that can cause them to act out, try to escape, and even try to attack people. Today one of these unstable patients managed break free, so the hospital staff told everyone in the area to clear out incase the patient ended up being violent. Everyone moved to a different area in the hospital, except for Kevin. The staff repeatedly tried to get him to move but Kevin either didn\u2019t seem to notice or just didn\u2019t care.\n\nThe patient started chasing Kevin causing him to panic and start running. Unfortunately for Kevin, he wasn\u2019t looking where he was going and ended up tripping over a small fence. This cause Kevin to fall face first to the ground, spilling his coffee and dropping his phone in the process. The patient ran up, grabbed Kevin\u2019s phone, started running away then threw it to the ground. Kevin was okay and the patient was eventually contained but Kevin\u2019s phone was broken. The hospital staff ended up writing a report for Kevin\u2019s actions, rather than the patient.\n\nStory 2: The pee bag                                                                                                             \n\nSome male patients aren\u2019t able to get up and use the bathroom normally for a variety of reasons. In cases like these, doctors sometimes insert a tube up the penis so the urine goes into this little bag (sort of like a reverse IV drip). Obviously, inserting the tube would be incredibly uncomfortable so the doctors would need to be incredibly careful and delicate. Kevin some how managed to quickly and roughly pull out the patient\u2019s tube by accident, obviously this caused a lot of pain and discomfort for the patient. I\u2019m not even sure how Kevin managed to do this by accident\u2026\n\nStory 3: The broken arm                                                                                                     \n\nSo as I mentioned previously, my Dad and Kevin move beds around the hospital. However, one very important rule is that you don\u2019t walk the beds through any closed curtains. This is because there could be people or equipment behind it. Well around 6 months ago, Kevin was moving a bed and walked right through a curtain. There was a doctor (a surgeon I think) behind the curtain and Kevin ran the bed over the doctor\u2019s arm. I\u2019m still surprised Kevin wasn\u2019t immediately fired for this and the doctor hasn\u2019t sued.\n\nNow you read these stories and think \u201cHow hasn\u2019t Kevin been fired?\u201d. Whenever someone tries to tell Kevin to do something or tries to tell him off for his moronic behaviour, Kevin just claims that he doesn\u2019t understand. His English skills seem okay when he\u2019s talking to people like my Dad though. I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s pretending to have poor English skills or if he\u2019s lying to get away with being an idiot but Kevin is one of the most absent minded morons that I know. And that\u2019s saying something since I went to primary school with kids who didn\u2019t know at 12 years old, that lemonade contains lemons.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1674197963.0},{"title":"Two Kevinas at my high school insist that the know my sexual orientation based on my ear piercing...","author":"Cut-Unique","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/10gb2ux\/two_kevinas_at_my_high_school_insist_that_the\/","text":"TL;DR at bottom. Also if you want to skip the context and go right to the story, scroll down to the fourth paragraph.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few days ago I shared [a story](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/10c3df0\/kevin_thinks_people_literally_worship_toilets\/) from my freshman year of high school in which a kid got riled up when I made a joke about \"worshiping the Porcelain God\" (meaning kneeling over the toilet in order to vomit into it) because he thought everybody should worship Jesus. That story wasn't very juicy but I thought I'd share it anyway because I thought it was funny. I mentioned that I have another story from this same school year involving a kid at this school whom I hated, whose name actually was Kevin. Now Kevin actually isn't the \"Kevin\" in this story, as he wasn't directly involved, instead the \"Kevins\" are two extremely bitchy girls whom I hated as much as I hated Kevin because they were constantly harassing me, but in this particular incident, they proved just how dumb they were.\n\nFirst some context. This incident took place during the 2004-05 school year when I was a high school freshman. Two years earlier, when I was in 7th grade, I had gotten my left ear pierced. I did so because a lot of the guys I knew in middle school had their ears pierced. Back then it was more common for guys to have a single ear piercing, while nowadays you often see guys who have both ears pierced. It was common to have one ear pierced if you were straight, and the other ear pierced if you were gay. It seems like the left ear is often regarded as the \"straight\" ear and the right one is regarded as the \"gay\" ear, though in actuality piercings are just piercings and not an indicator of one's sexual orientation. Most of the guys I knew had their left ears pierced, but honestly I wasn't thinking about my sexual orientation when I had mine done. I simply got it in a vain attempt to be \"cool\" though in actuality I was an extreme geek who had Asperger's syndrome and a lot of anxiety about school. I was actually homeschooled for most of the day; I only attended a couple of classes at my middle school.\n\nIt was for these reasons that in high school, I began attending a school for kids who had social\/emotional\/behavioral challenges which prevented them from functioning well in a classroom and getting a good education. I would like to point out that, although I had Asperger's syndrome and wasn't the only one there who had it, it wasn't a school for kids on the spectrum or who had intellectual disabilities. It was more of an \"educational rehab\" school. There were counselors there whom the kids could go to if they were having any sort of crisis, who were there to make sure the kids got a good education, help them prepare for life after graduation, and encourage the kids to make good decisions and stay out of trouble. The school had small classes (roughly 8-10 kids in each class) and, with the exception of PE, we had the same teacher for all subjects. A lot of the kids had anger issues, problems with drugs, and trouble with the law. As you can imagine, many of them, including the stars of our show, were not pleasant to interact with.\n\nAnyways, onto the story. This happened one day during PE class. There were these two girls, whom I'll call Kevina and Kit (for Karen-In-Training). I was a freshman, while Kevina and Kit were both juniors (the classes were mixed-grade). Kevina and Kit were constantly harassing people about various shit, often times it was completely random and unprovoked. We were out on the basketball court doing laps. Most of us were too tired to run, so we just walked around the court. I passed by Kevina and Kit and, as expected, they started bugging me.\n\nKevina: Why did you get your left ear pierced?\n\nOP: Uh, because I wanted to?\n\nKevina: Don't you know what that means?\n\nOP: Uh, no? (I actually had a feeling about where this whole thing was going, I said no because I didn't want to engage with them.)\n\nKit: It means you're GAY!\n\nOP: No it doesn't.\n\nKit: Yes it does!\n\nOP: Well I'm not gay!\n\nKevina: Yes you are! Otherwise you would have gotten your RIGHT ear pierced.\n\nOP: You have it backwards. The right ear means you're gay, and the left ear means you're straight.\n\nKevina: No, YOU have it backwards!\n\nKit: If you're straight, you would have gotten your RIGHT ear pierced, because it's the RIGHT thing to do! (Oh, so now we're actually being homophobic are we?)\n\nNow here's where Kevina and Kit showed just how dumb they were...\n\nOP: Okay, well Kevin has his left ear pierced!\n\nKevina: Yes, and he's GAY!\n\nOP: No he isn't!\n\nKit: Yes he is!\n\nI knew for a fact that Kevin wasn't gay. Now granted, perhaps he was bi, but he clearly was attracted to girls. He was dating a girl, Britney, whom I liked (mainly because I thought she was hot) but most of the girls, including Kevina and Kit, hated, because she was regarded by most of the girls as the \"school slut\". Not only that but Kevin was a typical jealous, possessive douchebag who threatened to kick your ass if he felt you were making moves on Britney. He had previously threatened me as well as John (the kid in my previous story) who also liked Britney.\n\nOP: Well if he's gay, why is he dating Britney? You're constantly giving me a hard time about having a crush on her, and now suddenly you're insisting I'm gay because of my piercing?\n\nI forget what happened afterwards. It took all I had to not engage with them further, because I knew I'd be punished if I did (they punished everyone who got into any sort of fight, regardless of who was the aggressor), so instead I walked away. Not the most exciting ending I know. Despite growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area which is known for being one of the most LGBT-friendly regions in the US, and despite any anti-LGBT statements or other hate speech being condemned at school, it didn't stop kids from using \"gay\" as an insult, or saying \"I know you're gay because (insert whatever reason here).\" The first time I heard \"gay\" used as an insult was in first grade, and I didn't know what it meant so I had to ask my mom. Kids would never get away with any of that shit nowadays. Back then, most kids agreed that treating someone differently because of their race, sex, etc. wasn't cool, but being attracted to someone of the same sex was more taboo than it is now.\n\nThis is the same generation that now widely condemns homophobia, with many people identifying as LGBT+, and I think it's to make up for being such homophobic assholes as kids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Two girls at my school start harassing me about getting my left ear pierced, insisting that because I did so, it automatically meant I was gay, and if I wasn't gay I should have gotten my right ear pierced as it was, in their words, the \"right\" thing to do. When I point out that a kid who was dating a girl I liked at the time and was a typical jealous, possessive douchebag who would threaten to kick anyone's ass if he felt you were making moves on his girlfriend had his left ear pierced, the two girls still insist that he's gay, and yet they previously had given me a hard time for liking that girl, who was regarded by many of the girls as the \"school slut\".","upvote_ratio":0.78,"created_utc":1674157305.0},{"title":"Kevin the maintenance man.","author":"cdcarson99","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/10fiioz\/kevin_the_maintenance_man\/","text":"Over a year and half ago since I left this job, but I still remember a LOT of stories of my co-worker Kevin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor context, I worked as an HVAC tech \/ Maintenance man for 2 properties, a nursing home and an independent living apartment complex that were connected. Kevin was hired as our team of 3 could not handle the excess work that was 2 buildings. The nursing home had about 120+ rooms, and the independent living had around 140.\n\nKevin was the type of guy to take everything literally and not to think things through. I am not sure if he was oblivious or just didn't care but I remember that on the nursing home side of the building there were units that had trash that needed taking out 2x a day. Kevin emptied one of the bio-waste bins (the ones where poopy diapers and whatnot go to be disposed of) and didn't noticed the bag had a rip. Somehow, he dragged this diaper filled trash bag through the whole unit, through the dining room and was stopped midway through the hall. There was a trail of diapers and little tiny bits of feces... He pled his case that he didn't understand what the big deal was as the dining room wasn't occupied right now. Management made him clean it up.\n\nOther stores of Kevin include:\n\nAlmost wrecking the company van while doing a trash run of the outside public bins on the property. He drives very sporadic and speeds up and slows down by breaking as if a child ran out in front of him. Our parking lot isn't that big so Its a miracle he hasn't hit anyone.\n\nFlooding an apartment by forgetting to turn off the water when doing a repair to a toilet.\n\nCut his finger open on a key cutting machine (we had those in our shops cause the independent seniors tend to lose their keys) and bled all over our shop. Apparently he cut himself by not turning off the key cutter when he was done and just reached for the key in the clamp.\n\nOccasionally we would have to move furniture for room changes and on the times Kevin was driving the cart he would bang into every wall and sometimes ding the very nice furniture and have no idea.\n\nNot knowing how to do some of the most basic maintenance tasks, or troubleshooting.

This coincides with my latest bill, but the utility company themselves says my estimates may have wandered thousands of dollars away from use due to the persistent lack of readings. One quarter I was billed several thousand dollars, probably the entire suburb's utility use, and when I rang they reissued it in a feasible amount and told me to \"forget it\" (like anyone would forget that).  In the last days of oh-so-pleasant telephone conversations with the company, the meter reader has given his employer more cock and bull stories about my non-existent dog or the locked gate, or both.

The classes were small, and we had the same teacher and teacher's aide for all subjects. I had this one classmate, whom I will call John (because I have another story from this same school year involving a kid whose name actually was Kevin, whom I despised). John was a cool guy and I got along with him fine, although we never were close friends as we never hung out outside school. However, he was a little...weird (then again, we all were a little weird, hence why we attended that school).\n\nFor example, John, like a lot of rebellious teenagers including myself, was a big fan of rock\/metal and was learning to play guitar. He occasionally would bring his guitars to school, but because he was worried about them getting damaged, he would often borrow an acoustic guitar which belonged to the school counselor and would play it during break. Obviously he preferred electric guitars because metal. One day we were watching a documentary about the indigenous peoples of Guatemala. John asked if they played electric guitars. Our teacher's aide, who was originally from Guatemala, said no. John seemed genuinely shocked to learn that people such as the Maya traditionally do not play electric guitar and listen to rock\/metal! He just couldn't envision a life without rock n roll! Another thing about John was that even though he was 15, his voice had yet to mature, and whenever he got riled up about something (which he often did), he would shriek like a banshee, and the teachers often had to tell him to lower his voice.\n\nJohn was also a devout Christian and was somewhat on the conservative side, which I'm kinda surprised at considering that he listened to a lot of music that some people insist is \"satanic\" even though a lot of the pioneers of heavy metal, such as Ozzy Osbourne, are\/were Christians. He didn't think badly of certain religions such as Judaism, or atheists\/agnostics, but I don't think he had a high opinion of \"non-mainstream\" religions. And due to his \"Kevinism\", he often didn't know when we were joking or speaking metaphorically, although he did have a sense of humor and often made jokes.\n\nNow on to the story. For some reason, it seemed like many of the kids at this school would vomit on a regular basis. I don't know why that was; perhaps it was due to anxiety, since that was what a lot of us struggled with, or maybe a side effect of whatever meds they were on, or maybe some of them vomited on purpose in order to get out of class (Puking Pastilles, anyone?). In any case, there was this other kid, whom I'll call Ralph, who was one of the kids who vomited regularly. He claimed to have GERD, but it seemed like he was exaggerating the symptoms. In addition to throwing up all the time, he also was constantly burping very loudly to the point where the teacher yelled at him to knock it off (he could burp on command and one time he burped the alphabet). He was one of those hyperactive kids who was constantly disrupting the class (he was funny though).\n\nSo, one time Ralph went to use the restroom and was in there for a long time. We were wondering why he was taking so long, and I jokingly said that he was \"worshiping the Porcelain God\" (meaning that he was kneeling down over the toilet and vomiting into it). Immediately, John went into a frenzy and shrieked \"You're not supposed to worship the Porcelain God! You're supposed to worship JESUS!!!\" The teacher told him to lower his voice. Meanwhile, me and the other kids were explaining that I was referring to Ralph kneeling over the toilet in order to barf, and that I didn't mean it literally.\n\nNot the most exciting story, but I often look back on this and laugh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: For those of you who have said that maybe John wasn't able to understand metaphors due to him being mentally disabled, he wasn't mentally disabled. He did have ADD and also didn't have the best upbringing, and as a result had behavioral challenges which made it difficult for him to function in a classroom. I think he also had some trouble with the law. But as far as his mental capabilities go, he was in the normal range. As I said, due to his religious beliefs, while he tolerated certain non-Christian religions such as Judaism, and didn't try to force his beliefs on others, he didn't think highly of \"non-mainstream\" religions, and I think that the idea of a \"Porcelain God\" was total blasphemy in his view.\n\nI would also like to point out that one should not assume that a person on the autism spectrum (which John wasn't, but I am, and I was the one who made the joke) is incapable of understanding humor. In fact, one shouldn't assume anything about people on the spectrum. The autistic community is very diverse (hence the term \"neurodiversity\") and that's why it's important that the type of therapy a person on the spectrum receives is tailored to their individual needs. What works for one person might not work for another. One of the things that angers me the most is that a lot of therapists who \"treat\" autism have a one-size-fits-all approach. This was a major source of frustration for me and my parents during my childhood and early teens, as it was difficult for me to get the support I needed at school. They considered sending me to a private school specifically for kids with Asperger's, but decided against it because the director of the school, who had previously been a therapist whom I was seeing before she quit her practice in order to start the school, made them uncomfortable with her approach. I'm really glad they chose not to send me to that school because I wouldn't have gotten the help I needed there. Instead they had me go to a school that specialized in giving kids emotional support for whatever troubles they were facing that were affecting their ability to get a good education. For some of them it was Asperger's, for others it was ADD, and for a lot of them it was not having a good support system at home, getting into trouble, etc. It was not a school for kids with mental disabilities; it was more of an \"educational rehab\" school.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: A \"Kevin\" at my high school took the term \"worshiping the Porcelain God\" literally and got upset because \"We're supposed to worship Jesus!\" We had to explain to him that it was slang for leaning over the toilet and vomiting.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1673737175.0},{"title":"Kevina teacher doesn\u2019t think to herself \u201cI can just call on someone else\u201d","author":"Matt4898","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/10c7dpx\/kevina_teacher_doesnt_think_to_herself_i_can_just\/","text":"I\u2019m not 100% sure if this is really a Kevina moment, but this teacher legitimately was not all there.

Swedish. Everyone kept asking me \"A SWEDSH EXHANGE STUDENT!!??\" which was old the first time. This is not her story. She ended up getting paired up with Kevin, who was A. not female, and B. not Swedish, but C. a Kevin, who had been \"that guy\" at the orientation camp. She was not pleased to find a member of my extended family had decided to host a student and got Kevin. LOTS more Kevin in her life. Like siblings, in a kind of Wednesday Addams\/Pugsley way. Once out of the blue he turned and confided in me, \"We must protect our women!\" -- if he tried \"protecting\" Wednesday, she'd have killed him.\n\nKevin wasn't just a little unfortunate in his mind and body, he was a real handful. He would routinely ask his foster parent for insane things; like get him a gun (freaking unheard of in my country), if his gun could possibly be a magnum (...), and so on. Like getting told no once wasn't enough.\n\nHe insisted on starting driving lessons which were a dead end, even if he qualified locally he would not have then been up for an international licence. In any case he was failed for routinely stopping within the intersection (\"My tyres are behind the line!\", he helpfully pointed out.)\n\nHis foster parent was contacted by the authorities; a fauna smuggling ring had been busted and lo; Kevin's name was on their list of couriers. There was no official action over this but he probably got to strip at the airport as he left the country. The turn from lovable clown to bad guy henchman in a Bond film was jarring.\n\nThe single most remarkable thing about Kevin was his running style; all four limbs flailed in different directions as if they were trying to escape, like pistons offset at funny angles.

The whole time Kevin accused another student of stealing the wallet and framing him.\n\nKevin has gotten in trouble at school because he tells people how he has an (imaginary) uncle who owns a marijuana dispensary and how Kevin\u2019s \u201cin the business.\u201d Kevin didn\u2019t even know until last year that pot, cannabis, and \u201cgrass\u201d are all the same drug. \n\nKevin has also gotten in trouble for telling people not to mess with him because he\u2019s an experienced car thief and will steal their cars if they piss him off. Kevin doesn\u2019t even know how to drive. He\u2019s failed the written DMV test twice, probably because 80% of it is common sense.\n\nLast year Kevin bought a disposable vape pen from a classmate. Kevin was pissed off because the vape pen was dead and the kid had already left with his $15. Kevin decided to try the same scam. He walked around offering random people the vape pen for $20. He saw one of the math teachers Mr. Kelly walking by and offered him the vape pen.\n\nIn Kevin\u2019s defense, I also thought Mr. Kelly was a TA when I first had him for Algebra 2. Mr. Kelly\u2019s only twenty-six. He graduated a year early and was able to get a job right out of college since our principal and the staff liked him when he was a student. He can easily pass for a high schooler.\n\nBut also come on, what high school student wears a dress shirt and khakis to school? And Kevin says that people who dress that way are teachers\u2019 pets, so why would he expect someone dressed that way to not snitch on him?\n\nUnsurprisingly, Kevin got expelled. Neither of the other two high schools in our district agreed to let Kevin attend, so he\u2019s currently at a continuation school an hour away. Our parents refuse to drive Kevin so he has to be out the door by six and take two connecting buses to make it to his new school on time.\n\nOn the bright side, Kevin\u2019s been so tired that he hasn\u2019t really done anything that he\u2019s not supposed to for the past two months. So hopefully the problem\u2019s solved for now.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1673058090.0},{"title":"The friend who would be Kevin.","author":"SilentJoe27","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/105227k\/the_friend_who_would_be_kevin\/","text":"Obligatory on mobile, so please excuse grammar and formatting errors.\n\nI used to be friends with a Kevin. He was by no means dim when he actually applied himself. He was from Mexico, and taught himself English at a very young age, and in his mid 20s, was able to speak both English and Spanish fluently without an accent. He was also a techie and within our circle of friends, the go-to guy for computer issues, or for recommendations. He was also a decent artist as well.\n\nThat said, the guy often seriously lacked in common sense, social skills, and was often very lazy, and had poor time management skills.\n\nHe had a knack for trolling and starting arguments, sometimes not realizing when he would go too far. We lived in a rural part of Tennessee at the time, and our circle of friends, excluding Kevin and two other guys were all Black. The other two friends weren\u2019t present for this as we had stopped at a gas station to figure out directions and refuel. Out of nowhere, Kevin shouts, \u201cKILL WHITEY!\u201d And all eyes at the station were directly on us. We then scrambled to get into the car and peeled out. One friend later ripped him a new one over how stupid and dangerous that was.\n\nThere were also occasions where when we were at the Mart of Walls, he would casually whip out a knife he always carried. Thankfully, no one but me saw it as I would quietly fuss at him to put it back because a between the two of us, a knife out would easily land the both of us in jail.\n\nAs for his laziness and poor time management, I didn\u2019t have a car for the longest time, and public transit was nonexistent out where I lived, so since he lived the closest, he was often my ride when the group got together. I tend to have an \u201cif you\u2019re early, you\u2019re on time and if you\u2019re on time, you\u2019re late\u201d mentality. Unfortunately, Kevin was always late for everything.\n\nWe had a few classes together. I thankfully lived close enough to campus that I could just walk to class so I didn\u2019t depend on him. The first class of the day, however, he was always an hour late. Since class took place in the computer lab and our professor was extremely laid back, he never got raked over the coals for it. I did asks him why he was always late for class and he explained he would log into his computer as soon as he woke up and lose track of time (this was right before smartphones). I then asked why he didn\u2019t just skip logging in as soon as he woke up. He never answered and would still come in late.\n\nLater on, the group was planning to do an RPG session. I was excited because I had never really done an RPG before. My friends even helped me to create my own character and his stats. The game was supposed to start at 10:30 on Saturday at Bobby\u2019s house\u2026 and Kevin was supposed to come get me for it. Sonovabitch\u2026\n\nSaturday rolled around and since I knew Kevin was never on time for anything, I had a little extra time to get ready but as it was getting close to the time the game was supposed to start, I still hadn\u2019t heard from him. Finally he called me at 10:30 saying he just left his apartment and was on his way.\n\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cBobby lives on the other end of town, and it\u2019s a 15 minute drive just from your place to mine!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Kevin replied. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Famous last words.\n\nWe ended up over an hour late. The game had long since started and there wasn\u2019t really a spot where the DM could work us in. We just sat there watching them play the entire time, and I would periodically stare daggers at Kevin.\n\nAfter that incident, I asked our other friends to stop sending Kevin to come get me for group get togethers. Thankfully, they did until I was finally able to get my own car. We never did another RPG though.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1673030973.0},{"title":"I Had a Kevin That Would Read in Simlish","author":"ConfidentCar1555","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/104bhqk\/i_had_a_kevin_that_would_read_in_simlish\/","text":"This kid was probably the highlight of 6th grade. During my first year of middle school we had a Kevin. He was this short kid with long black hair that he always wore in a braided ponytail. At first glance, he was adorable and then we saw what was lurking beneath a small innocent face.\n\nThis kid had to be one of the strangest kids I\u2019ve ever encountered. He was part of the magnet program I was in but to this day, I wonder how the heck he got it because his behavior was just so\u2026bizarre. \n\nLet\u2019s say you were by yourself in the hallway. If Kevin was coming the opposite way, the kid would stare you down with a creepy smile that looked like something from the new horror film! He also had this rolling backpack that he would pull around and I don\u2019t know why but the backpack with the smile made it even weirder. In our program we all received MacBooks. This was what led to his expulsion the next school year. Apparently, he chucked it out of the bus window for no freaking reason and just laughed about it despite everyone around freaking out because HE CHUCKED A 2000 DOLLAR LAPTOP OUT THE WINDOW. The kid was chaotic neutral at its finest. \n\nHe would fart and it would be so bad sometimes, that the teacher would have to open the door and spray. The boy would clear the classroom out with those farts and again, they were unpredictable and nuclear. Of course, while we were getting attacked by atomic fart, he would sit with the same creepy grin.\n\nThe weirdest thing he would do would happen whenever we did popcorn reading. Kevin would NOT read in English. Honestly, he didn\u2019t read in ANY actual language. For pages, the kid would read in something that sounded like Simlish (what the sims speak in the video game). We would all look around each other in confusion trying to figure out what the hell he was reading. When he finished he would pick someone but of course no one knows where he stopped because he was NOT reading actual words. Once he called on me and my teacher gaslit me and said \u201cYou weren\u2019t following along?\u201d I\u2019m like \u201cI don\u2019t know what he even read or where he stopped!\u201d He didn\u2019t even know. This happened EVERY TIME during popcorn reading and eventually people would pick him to read because it became so entertaining to watch this kid read in Simlish with full confidence. I also want to add that whenever he would stop, he\u2019d look and yet again, flash that creepy smile.\n\nI don\u2019t know where he is today but my best friend who I\u2019ve also known since 6th grade and I talk about him from time to time and we STILL cackle about the free entertainment we got during 6th grade with our strange Kevin. Almost 17 years later and every now and then I can hear him reading page after page and I can still see my friends and I look at each other like \u201cTf is going on?\u201d Ah middle school.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1672955812.0},{"title":"Kevin thinks being a foreigner makes him unable to be racist.","author":"ReddyIsHere","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/101oe1q\/kevin_thinks_being_a_foreigner_makes_him_unable\/","text":"After reading a few similar stories on here I got reminded of this and thought I should share it.\nA rather important part of this story is that this Kevin was born in Italy and lived there for a while before moving to my home country of Switzerland (the german speaking part to be precise).\nI wanna say this was about 3 or 4 years ago now. I was in school having a conversation with him and some other friends of mine. We somehow got to the topic of different cultures, immigrants, tourists and that sort of stuff. Kevin was making some pretty racist and white supremacist remarks. Someone then pointed that out and told him to stop. Kevin responded with \"I'm being racist?\nI'm a foreigner, how can I be racist if I myself am a foreigner?\". I don't remember exactly what happened afterwards, but I can definitely imagine some confused head turns of people who overheard him and some arguing.\n\nNot a particularly long or crazy story, but I still thought it was worth sharing.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1672695164.0},{"title":"My Father Kevin: The One Kevin You'll Never Forget","author":"PutinSluzheSatani","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/1017pap\/my_father_kevin_the_one_kevin_youll_never_forget\/","text":"My dad is the Kevin in this tale, and my mom the Kevin-handler. Much of my childhood was my mom explaining (often in a futile effort) why Kevin's ludicrous plans didn't make sense. Now, some of these are secondhand stories that I know are true, there's a bit of a \"Kevin Expanded Universe\" of stories about dumb things he did, mostly from my mom and uncle (Kevin's brother). But I will only include the ones I have some confidence are true. Even so, I think this Kevin gives the OG a run for his money. \n\nKevin met my mom in high school- through a in-school suspension, which seems like a good place to start our story. If your school didn't have it, an in-school suspension is basically being sent to the principal for an entire day. It's in between detention and real suspension- even I got a few. Now, Kevin had been sent to the principal after blowing a centrifuge while fucking around in a science class lab. My mom had been sent there for... smoking. \n\nAs Kevin got up to leave for the day after serving his suspension, he \"stumbled\" and put his fist through the Principal's computer screen. This was 1999, so needless to say that was not a cheap fix. Not was it cheap to fix a hand that went through an old computer monitor. Anyway, for whatever reason, my mom became friends with him that day and eventually married etc.\n\nWithout further ado, let's get to some great all-time Kevin moments. \n\n_________\n\nKevin decided to buy a grill for the house and grill some beef on it. Unfortunately, he bought ground beef and couldn't figure out how to make it stick together, so he just *threw the tiny crumbled pieces into the grill*, where they burned. In a fit of rage, he threw the grill and set the lawn on fire. That's right, he couldn't make literal ground beef \"stick together\". \n\nKevin's second grill-related incident (just last month) happened when I was visiting home from college. So, he figured what better way to welcome me back than with some ~~Steamed Hams~~ grilling (on a 30 degree day)! Well, one minute into it he flopped his rotund belly onto the grill, because he read on the internet that if your stomach is fat enough it can absorb heat. It took him 0.5 seconds to realize he was wrong. He also refused to go to the urgent care and is still recovering from the painful infection he got on the burn. \n\nWhen I was younger, Kevin burnt his balls and had to go to the hospital (my dad goes to the hospital for accidents at least twice a year, I'm only listing the really crazy ones). How did he burn them? He tried doing a stunt in the kitchen to impress the in-laws, by throwing a cast-iron pan full of frying fish between his legs like a basketball. \n\nKevin insisted that he wouldn't bleed if he cut his skin \"around the veins\". This was his justification for trying to **perform a \"home tattoo\"** with a ballpoint pen. The tattoo was \"E=MC^2\". I shit you not. \n\nKevin could not be convinced that a small fish can live in a small tank. He bought me a goldfish when I was 7, and insisted on buying a $1000 giant tank (ENORMOUS tank for one singular ordinary goldfish) and filtration apparatus. Unfortunately, he set it up wrong, and on the first night of owning my fish, at 3am, the tank collapsed onto its side and smashed. Miraculously the fish lived, hanging on in one corner. Rocky the Goldfish would go on to live another 6 years in a normal bowl, which my dad was always kept a good distance from by my mom.  \n\nKevin had a pathological inability to understand the difference between a tornado watch and warning. If you don't live in the Midwest US, a tornado watch is issued for like a 100 mile by 100 mile area and means tornadoes are possible for the next 12 hours. Warning means there is a confirmed tornado, and is usually issued for the area in the path (usually about a 5 mile by 5 mile area). This is a distinction Kevin COULD NOT understand. Every single time there was a tornado watch he would INSIST that we all go to the basement, (upwards of 10 days a year- it's pretty common in the Midwest!) and he would peek out the window looking for tornadoes the entire time the watch was on, often up to twelve hours. The last few years he has broken his tornadophobia a little, but not totally. \n\nKevin does not own a single clock. He says one shouldn't have clocks in the house because the ticking can cause cancer. When asked if digital clocks are safe, he says they're more dangerous, because **they also tick, just really softly.**\n\nKevin went to a chinese restaurant and ordered Dingus. He had to be reminded that the word was \"dim sum\", not dingus. Given his reaction, he genuinely didn't know, it wasn't a joke. \n\nKevin refuses to read restaurant menus because \"if they have what I want I will order it, otherwise I won't order anything.\" This has resulted in him ordering 100% of the time, making the waiter\/waitress explain every single dish. \n\nKevin went skydiving with my mom and got the dive cancelled after, 30 seconds before jump, jokingly saying his parachute pack felt too light, \"like something was missing\". The dive instructor refused to dive afterwards, even when my dad said it was a joke. He got a refund, though the instructor was probably a dick too for cancelling. \n\nThere was this old cook on TV from the south who used to say \"I GAR-ON-TEE\" in a ridiculous southern accent. Kevin picked this up (He's from Minnesota...) and would not stop. \"Can you get the dishes?\" my mom would ask. \"I GAR-ON-TEE!\". \"Can you take OP to school?\" He'd reply, \"I GAR-ON-TEE!\". This went on for a month until my mom Gar-on-teed to punch him if he said it again. \n\nMy father tried explaining to me, when I was 16, that I should \"really have a girlfriend by now.\" I told him I didn't like anyone right now, and he suggested that if I didn't like my peers, I should pursue a relationship with their mothers. Thank you Kevin, very cool. \n\nGood old Kevin Sr. (Kevin's Dad) once lectured Kevin (in earshot of me, I was 14) that he should try to have a son. Kevin Sr. doesn't have dementia or anything, he just thought I wasn't a real man because my hair looked like I was a... \"bundle of sticks\". I'm sure you can fill in the blanks. Kevin Sr., for context, was born in 1932. Kevin was born in 1982. I was born in 2003. Bit of a generation gap lol. \n\nKevin bought an ENORMOUS triple computer monitor, like a yard across. Impractically large to use, and my mom was livid when he spent $1600 on it, but the real fury came when it turned out it wouldn't work on our desktop. Why? It was a 2019 monitor setup, and the desktop was the 2006 toaster Kevin has been using with 2010 Linux that Kevin refuses to update. The monitor went to good use when he sold it on eBay and sent it across the country in a gigantic box with no padding, where it arrived smashed to bits. Kevin had to refund the whole cost he sold it for... $300. #stonks\n\nKevin was astonished when my mom got a kidney infection because he thought only men had kidneys. It took him over an hour of \"lively\" discourse with her urologist to convince him that his wife wasn't intersex and didn't know it. Except Kevin didn't use the word, \"intersex\", he said a \"Puss-n-Prick\". \n\nKevin saw the humidity was 100% on a weather app and put on swim trunks because he thought this meant there would be water outside. I didn't even know how to respond to this. \n\nMy dad was once pulled over by the cops for speeding. 69mph in a 40. He made so many 69 jokes the cop wrote 68 on the ticket. Hey, he could be the Reddit mascot! \n\nBut there was one final incident that I think really encapsulates Kevin perfectly. It was Christmas eve and his mother (Grandma Kevina) had COVID (this was back in 2020). We were all together, still, because Kevina didn't believe in quarantine\/isolating. My dad bought my mom a $700 piece of jewelry for Christmas. He didn't buy her anything else except some stocking stuffers. Who buys expensive jewelry for Christmas anyway? Kevin, I guess. Anyway, Grandma was by this point coughing blood but wouldn't go to the hospital for another two days (after which she was in for two weeks!). We all got Covid from her too. \n\nBut back to the story, the story of doom, for poor Kevin's present is about to go boom. He wrapped it up in a hurry and stuck it under the Christmas tree. He had thrown out all the dirty, bloody masks  Grandma had left around, and I'm sure you see where this is going. The time came Christmas morning to open up gifts, and what does my mom get from Kevin but a bloodied, filthy mask! Kevin managed to recover the jewelry from the trash, but not before making a legendary family moment. What kind of bonehead can mistake jewelry for a dirty mask? A Kevin. \n\nHope you enjoyed reading about my dad more than I have enjoyed experiencing him...","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1672648776.0},{"title":"Kevin thieves","author":"Tramin","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/100hu0m\/kevin_thieves\/","text":"Kevin had an extremely fluid approach to property; his was his and yours was also his. He thought nothing of going through your wallet in front of you, or reading your diary and making alterations to the journal entries as he saw fit. Like you wouldn't notice or care. But would scream blue murder if it so much as looked as if you'd dare to touch anything of his. My first encounter with him was when he'd overheard I was ordering a graphic novel and had mysteriously interposed himself in my order; he simply showed up with \"my\" (brand new yet somehow extremely shop worn) graphic novel after visiting the dealer, cash on delivery, NOW please NOW. Like he hadn't bought my mint copy and swapped it out for his poor. I had a word with the shop and never gave him any kind of excuse to get involved financially after that. \n\nBut the belle note were cigarette lighters. He was a cigarette smoker and expected to \"borrow\" anyone else's lighter, having lit up he'd have a moment of contemplation, and invariably place your lighter in his pocket. He claimed this was automatic but would also gleefully boast about the large volume of stolen lighters that lived on his bedside table. Things were far from even; taking the last lighter from our camp site saw me very deliberately shake him down for a replacement the next time I saw him, the loss of \"his\" lighter formed an inordinate amount of his whining after this point.\n\nHis lighter peek-a-boo ended when one of his victims moved in with a flatmate freshly out of the military. Mr Veteran once had cause to ask where-oh-where his lighter had gone, Kevin produced it out of his pocket. Mr Veteran decided not to be a good sport about it, and told Kevin he'd break his hands if he caught him stealing again. Keven didn't test his luck by dint of not visiting again, one of the few intelligent choices in his dumb and antisocial life.\n\nKevin worked for the biggest department store in town, grunt work but if you listened to him he ran the place. In truth he had been a junior sales associate and failed to be promoted, his senior wages led to the business badly wanting him to leave but without the necessary cause to sack him, a legal requirement in our country. One day he showed up all despondent; all he'd done was give some product away to an attractive girl and then immediately found himself getting brought into management where he was threatened with prosecution if he didn't immediately resign. He was stunned at this turnabout as he was of course universally respected, no one could bring themselves to point out the obvious; he'd been set up with a little light shoplifting. Because they also knew he was dumb and light fingered. \n\nKevin's biggest job was some insurance fraud, his family staged a robbery at their business so he put in his wish list; an entire music shop's worth of classical CDs. Christmas presents from Kevin became exclusively classical music CDs from this point, as he found he didn't actually like classical music, or indeed music. It wasn't as if you could smoke them or spend them like underserved senior sales wages.\n\nKevin's weirdest conceit was going around telling people he was going to be a judge, as he neither studied law nor anything else, and was more of a petty criminal than anything. He graduated to low level prostitution and drugs production; no theft involved but a high level of certainty that he'd be the mug who'd go to jail when the time came. If only he'd stuck to thieving lighters.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1672572766.0},{"title":"When you're the Kevin pt. 2","author":"JediBoJediPrime29","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/100ddvm\/when_youre_the_kevin_pt_2\/","text":"A few months ago I ranked down some of the Kevinish things I've done, and I've done more so I'm gonna talk about them.

I was one of her supervisors. Kevina was in her early 60s at the time this occurred, I was in my mid 20s. Company policy at the time was if a customer looked under 40 we had to card them for tobacco and alcohol. If it was a group of people and we suspected all were going to drink then we had to card everyone in the group. ID had to be a government issued ID that was up to date. No exceptions. Our state and local government was very strict on disciplining retailers that did not follow the law and often sent out underage under covers to catch us in the act. \n\nWhen you first started the job the company would make you watch several videos and take several tests regarding the issue of asking for ID. There was also a video telling you of the penalties you as an individual would face and the store would face. You also had to sign a contract before you started cashiering stating that you are well aware of the rules and consequences and that the company would not help or defend you should you break them. \n\nSo one day I\u2019m scheduled to work the 3pm to 11:30pm shift. When I come in the morning supervisor asks if I could clock in early because we have a big problem. I clock in and the morning supervisor explains to me that Kevina sold cigarettes to an underage undercover customer. We\u2019ve received a ticket and Kevina has received a ticket as well. We call Kevina into the office. It was company policy to have 2 supervisors present when it came to employee discipline. We asked Kevina why she didn\u2019t card the customer, who was clearly under 40. Kevina said that the line was long and the person looked of age. We explain that the under 40 rule is there for a reason. We also explained that she would have to go to court, the company would not take care of it for her and the DAs office would get back to us on the store\u2019s discipline. \n\nKevina went to court and was ordered to pay a $250 fine. This was when minimum wage was $8\/hr. The store was given a set of dates where we could not sell tobacco products of any kind for 48 hours. We asked if we could just cover the tobacco with sheets. No, all tobacco products must be removed off the shelf for this time period. You can guess who was tasked with doing that and had to inform customers for a week. \n\nOne would hope Kevina had learned her lesson but unfortunately no. \n\nFast forward 6 months later. It\u2019s a very busy Friday night so I hop on a register to help. I get a group of 2 women who are at most in their 20s buying beer. I ask them both for their IDs. They start fuming. They say that they were just here an hour ago and point to Kevina saying that she didn\u2019t ID them. They had forgotten their IDs. I point to the \u201cWe Card 40 and Under\u201d sign. I also thank them for letting me know because now Kevina is in big trouble since I am her supervisor. I remind them that I will need both their ID. The women do come back fuming and slapping their IDs on the counter but since they are legal age I let them buy beer. \n\nWhen everything dies down I confront Kevina about checking IDs. She says if they look over 21 she doesn\u2019t check because we\u2019re so busy. I tell her again that it\u2019s very easy for a teenager to look over 21 that\u2019s why the rule is 40. Kevina brushes me off and says she knows how to do her job. \n\nI make a written report of me talking to Kevina. The following Monday I tell my manager about what happened on Friday and give him my written report. My manager calls Kevina to the office and again explains the 40 rule. I also show Kevina how easy it is for a teenager to look over 21. I showed her a set of pictures of myself. When I was 21 I decided to donate 2ft if my hair. I decided to get some professional photos taken. In the long haired pictures most people put me at around 15 or 16. In the short haired pictures most people put me around 25. I ask Kevina to guess my age in both sets of pictures. Kevina refuses though my manager does just to prove the point. My manager also reminds her of the court appearance and fine she had to pay last time. \n\nA month later we get word that Kevina is retiring. During a few chats with other supervisors I learn that they all caught Kevina selling alcohol and tobacco to young people without IDing them. Although my manager never confirmed or denied this, we heard a rumor that due to her being such a liability to the company they gave her the option to retire or resign or they were going to fire her. Out of all the stupid moves Kevina did, this was probably her smartest. \n\nSince then company policy has gotten stricter to where every customer buying tobacco and alcohol needs to be IDed.

I'll try to reproduce the conversation best I can and change the name of course:\n\n(Kevin)\"hi, is Emily there?\"\n\n(No, sorry, she's on vacation, how can I help you?) \n\n\"Oh, I always talk to Emily..\"\n\n(Ok, but again, she's on vacation, I'm sure I can help you, what's going on?)\n\n\"....Fine, I'm sure you know who I am... I'm the pain in the ass.\"\n\n(*Looks over at caller ID* I would never call you a pain in the ass, but yes, I see the caller ID,  Kevin McAssly??) \n\n\"Yeah, that's me! Fine, if she's not there I'll talk to you. Just so you know, I don't believe in masks. LNI stopped paying me and I want to know why.\"\n\n(Ok, well, Science does, and..)\n\n*McAssly cuts me off* \n\"well I don't! I don't believe in it, it's bullshit!\"\n\n(That's fine Kevin, but for appointments you have to wear one, and we can provide one for your visit. Looks like we last saw you on Halloween, that's quite a while ago, I wonder if your APF expired due to that large gap, they stop paying if that isn't current. I'll check that, just a second.)\n\n*Still with a significant speech impediment* \"well, I was on vacation, so I didn't come in since then.

The owner, of course, was a true Kevin, who managed his own store- which would eventually lead to his downfall. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's start with the first week I held the job. I didn't expect to stay there more than a month. Two days into my working there, he walks out onto the store floor as the store is closing, then stands in front of the sliding doors as if to block anybody from leaving. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nKevin starts taking storage crates and stacks them up, then climbs up on the stack. Kevin announces to us his intention to make our store the \"greatest grocery store of all time\". And my reaction at this point is basically \\*wtf, you had to do this the week I get the job? Seriously?\\*. Yet Kevin would have us believe we are going into a final deadly battle. He gets off his literal soapbox and tells us to line up as he shakes our hands. Idk, maybe fatso (he was almost 400 lbs and looked like Larry the cable guy) was making up for not being able to join the army. Anyway, we all go home confused and pissed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe very next day there's a giant banner in the store that says \"Starting wage: $23\/hour\", which ends up being true. At that point, myself and everyone else shut up about the weird boss because that's an incredible wage where I live. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA month goes by and one afternoon I'm putting pickles on the shelf when I hear a blood-curdling, guttural scream from the breakroom. I put down the box and go to look, especially as horrified customers glance at each other. Do you realize how loud one has to scream to be heard five aisles across a grocery store? Anyway, Kevin has discovered that someone ate his tuna sandwich in the breakroom fridge. I tell him it wasn't me and so does my coworker nearby, and we are just about to go back to our job when Kevin gets on the intercom. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"ALL HANDS, REPORT TO THE BREAKROOM! ALL HANDS! NO EXCEPTIONS!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep in mind this is in the middle of the day and so by calling \"all hands\" (like a fucking warship) he's telling cashiers to stop, etc. Well, fast forward twenty minutes, Kevin is red in the face with fury and he's got us packed into the breakroom like sardines screaming at the top of his lungs about \"fish-fuckers\" and \"tuna \\[Slur for Italians, no idea why\\]\". There's now a good ten-customer line at both checkouts. We walk out to see people walking away, at which point Kevin does a 180 back to us and yells as a parting shot, \"LOOK! you made me lose money!\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAn asshole to be sure, but where does the stupidity come in, you might be asking. Ah, glad you asked! Kevin has set a trap the next day, set to detonate a flashbang grenade in the face of the first person to open the fridge. He thinks he will catch a lunch thief. Of course, he ends up flashbanging himself and having to go home for the day because he can't hear. He somehow did not consider that someone might open the fridge for non malicious purposes, like to get THEIR OWN lunch, but that's Kevin for you. He was just lucky it wasn't one of his employees or there would've been legal trouble. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward about a year, there's a pandemic in full swing so we are essential workers, nothing too weird happens other than regular speeches from Kevin about how we are all American heroes. At least he paid us well, and so in my case anyway I was just glad to get the money since better jobs weren't hiring during the pandemic. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's now March 2021 and the COVID vaccine is rolling out. Kevin decides he is going to \"buy vaccines\" for all of us. No amount of attempts to convince him the vaccine is free could make him believe it, because his \"friend\" had a cheap box for $50. We finally show him news articles about it, but Kevin knows his friend has a good deal. He walks in the next morning with a giant crate of syringes and is surprised when nobody will take his shady shots off the back of a truck. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nKevin also showed up one day during that same summer wearing a sombrero with the taco bell logo on it and was surprised to find that the almost half Latino clientele were \"looking at him weird\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAh, you thought the lunch thief saga was over, right? Well, it's September of '21 and things are going normal, when Kevin discovers his lunch has been eaten AGAIN. He walks out onto the store floor, grabs a jar of ragu (pasta sauce) off the shelf and slams it on the floor in a childlike rage, then sweeps it up with a broom (wrong tool, all it did was smear and make a mess in the broom bristles) to show how useless we all are. The next day, his lunch is stolen again and this is where things get truly insane. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo realize, Kevin is one of only three people to actually use the fridge, most of us just buy food from, you know, the grocery store we work in. So somebody was eating Kevin's lunch instead. But one of my coworkers, let's call him Jim, has his own lunch in the fridge when he picks up an awful smell. He asks what it is, and Kevin proudly informs Jim, in front of a good four or five employees in the breakroom, that it's a literal shit sandwich. We should've called the health department, but Kevin and consequences always seemed to be mutually exclusive. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe real kicker came this spring, though. A pipe burst in the ceiling, so there was water pouring down into the store. We close down for the day, and call in specialists, but Kevin insists on standing over them to \"make sure they don't steal\".  Well, one of them has to move a rolling display of baked goods to get to the ceiling panel they need. This display is on casters, it's \\*easy\\* to move. But Kevin insists it remains precisely there. Cue the r\/maliciouscompliance as they go ahead and do it without moving the cart. One of the workers slips and falls off the ladder which is spanning the side of the display, and falls into the baked goods, wrecking it all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThings only went downhill from there, and we later learn as the store is going out of business that Kevin won the lottery in 2006 and all of this business venture has been for fun, which makes sense in retrospect. Last I heard, Kevin is in some tax trouble, so maybe you'll hear about this on the news soon.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1672396615.0},{"title":"Kevin asks me to take him on a fishing trip","author":"Thinks_Like_A_Man","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/zyonkg\/kevin_asks_me_to_take_him_on_a_fishing_trip\/","text":"Kevin (his real name) and I had been fishing buddies for years after he hired me to help him with a year long project that was due in a month.

It was a big celebration, something like Christmas, where it was perfectly socially acceptable to drop by someone's house unannounced to give them your Christmas wishes. The rules of hospitality required the host to offer their guests a small drink and a small snack or a sweet, and the guests were similarly expected to bring a small gift.\n\nKevin and his drunkard friends, after having already had a few drinks, had this brilliant idea: They would start going from one house to another, in order to have all the drinks their hosts would offer them. The fact that it would be tacky for, not one person or two, but a whole group of drunkards, to show up empty-handed, didn't seem to be a problem in their drunken minds.\n\nTheir plan seemed to be working, until they went to Kevin's place. By that time, it was already dark, and they had had more than their fair share of alcohol. Now, Kevin was planning to repaint his barn using whitewash, so he had opened a hole in his front yard and left the whitewash in there to cure. Do you see where I'm going with this?... Because Kevin certainly didn't. He fell inside the whitewash in his own yard. Fortunately it was already cured, so he didn't have any chemical burns, he just got painted white.\n\nHaving already shown off his tackiness at a few places before, and having consumed so much alcohol, Kevin didn't let this bother him. So, he followed his friends, who had already started walking into his house.\n\nHis wife was welcoming one drunkard after another, when she noticed her husband, suddenly dressed in white. Now, she thought, it would sour everyone's festive mood if she were to scold her husband in front of the whole audience. On the other hand, letting it go and saying nothing would equal condoning his behaviour.

These are both fairly obscure terms, both mean small or meaningless, \"pissant\" being rude and \"piddling\" being antiquated.  \n\nIt started Monday, I came home from college to the family house for Christmas. Kevin, meanwhile, still lives at home because he hasn't kept a single job for more than 2 months. Now, we've got 11 people here, the whole family, so Kevin sees that he has an audience and Here. We. Go. \n\nThe first thing he does Monday is mock me for going to college, unironically. He calls me an \"egghead\", I take it he's watched some old movies recently. He then spends the whole afternoon guffawing about our uncle having a heel (like, a TINY one) on his shoe and how that must mean he is a gay bottom. \n\nTuesday goes worse, as he's learned a new phrase: \"Pidding Pissant\". Google says it's a quote from the old American president Lynden Johnson, but no, Kevin insists it's Quebecois. I live 100km from Quebec. I have never heard anyone say \"Pissant\" before him. Anyway, he says to one of our cousins (let's call him Rob) during dinner, \"You work as a security guard, do you ever do stuff like die hard?\". And so Rob tells Kevin no, at which point Kevin calls Rob a piddling pissant. They almost ended up getting in a fight but my aunt broke it up. \n\nWednesday went great, Kevin spent it demanding to know if I was a \"piddling pissant\" and trying to build a \"Shaq shack\" in the backyard, he printed off a picture of the basketball player Shaq and slapped it on a shitty \"treehouse\" in the backyard. \n\nThursday- boom, massive f@cking snowstorm. Kevin says he will build a \"snowman\", cousin jokingly asks if he is gendering it by calling it a snowman, so he goes outside and adds an enormous cock. \n\nFriday- day 2 of snow, he decides to spend it preparing us for \"Krampus\" because he watched that movie (bad santa that kills you during snowstorms) and saying he will crush, you guessed it, \"piddling pissants\" like us. \n\nSo yesterday he goes for gold, and insists that he is going to get a job as a brain surgeon. He goes online and brings up some job search website. He sends his \"resume\", (lmao) to 26 hospitals all over North America.

We don't know if it is true or not and frankly does not matter because even bragging about it is just gross and just... dumb.\n\nShe ended up dropping out our junior year to pursue her career in music and the last I saw her I was a senior in high school working at the local grocery store and she came in with her boyfriend (He looked about 30ish and she was 17.

(I\u2019m actually writing this while the Missus thinks I should be working.)\n\nSo, without further ado, lets get right to it: \u201cKevin in a Big Rig: OP vs Dispatch\u201d. \u00a0(and, before you ask, NO CLIFFHANGER!) \u00a0\u00a0\n\nLate one evening, My student and I were trucking north on Interstate 84 through rural Oregon on our way to Portland. \u00a0My student, lets call him Steve, \u00a0was driving and since it was the first time he was driving at night, I decided to ride shotgun and make sure he didn\u2019t fall asleep or run into trouble. \u00a0To Steve\u2019s credit, he was doing quite well for a rookie.\n\nWhile going through a rocky area, I explained to Steve that at night, he had to be aware of sharp curves in the road since taking one too fast could cause him to lose control and flip the truck over. \u00a0He was still doing fine; slowing down before the curve and keeping the truck in the lane.\n\nWhen the road went through a narrow, rocky cut-out, I was explaining to Steve that things such as boulders or stalled vehicles could be a hazard on a road with narrow shoulders. \u00a0Just then, as if on cue, I saw something very close to the road.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a rock or vehicle; it was a deer. \u00a0Kevin saw it too and I could feel him start to tense up. \u00a0\n\n\u201cJust relax.\u201d I told him calmly. \u00a0\u201cSlow down, keep an eye on him and whatever you do, DON\u2019T SWERVE!\u201d \u00a0Steve nodded and backed off the accelerator as we got closer. \u00a0The deer was grazing and my hope was that it would keep on doing so as we passed. \u00a0In my experience, deer that graze near major roadways tend to be comfortable doing so and are not likely to bolt out in front of you. \u00a0\n\nAs it happened, this deer wasn\u2019t as comfortable as I expected. \u00a0With less than twenty feet between us, the deer panicked and ran right in front of the truck. \u00a0\u201cWhoa whoa\u2026\u2026.\u201d I said, signaling with my hand for Steven to start braking; which he did perfectly. \u00a0Unfortunately for the deer, a fully loaded semi doesn\u2019t stop quickly and I felt thud as the animal struck the front of the truck.\n\n\u201cDamnit!\u201d I swore as the truck jarred. \u00a0I looked over at Steven who, while rightly nervous, was still firmly in control and, again to his \n\n\u201cPull over,\u201d I told him. \u00a0\u201cGet us off the road as much as you can and turn on the flashers. \u00a0I\u2019ll check the damage.\u201d \u00a0Steven nodded, pulled off on the extremely narrow shoulder and set the brakes. \u00a0I grabbed my flashlight jumped out; expecting the worst. \u00a0\n\nHitting a deer with a truck was always a crap-shoot. \u00a0Shattered hoods from the impact, flat tires from antlers\u2026I\u2019ve even seen ruptured coolant hoses. \u00a0In other words, it\u2019s always best to check the truck out after hitting a deer. \u00a0I checked the hood first; expecting a smashed grill or, at the very least, a destroyed bumper. \u00a0To my surprise, the only obvious damage was busted headlight and a few small chips in the paint. \u00a0Both front tires were still inflated an there was no fluid leaking from the engine.\n\n\u201cWay to go, Steve-O.\u201d I said to myself. \u00a0Steve had done exactly what he was taught; avoid hitting the deer if possible but, if hitting the deer isn\u2019t avoidable, hit it at as slowly as possible to minimize damage.\n\nI checked out the rest of the truck; looking for flat tires, broken lights\u2026anything that might keep us from going on towards Portland. \u00a0I then tried to find the deer, not wanting to leave a large animal carcass on the interstate that would take out an unwary Prius, but it was nowhere to be seen. \u00a0Since it obviously wasn\u2019t in the middle of the road, I decided to get move along.\n\nI climbed back into the truck and Steve was still in the driver seat, sweating bullets despite the twenty degree temperature outside. \u00a0\n\n\u201cOh man,\u201d Steve said, barely holding back the tears, \u201cI\u2019m gonna get fired.\u201d \u00a0Steve was barely into his second week and any safety violation could lead to termination. \u00a0However, as his trainer, I had decided what constituted a safety violation.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not getting fired, Steve,\u201d I reassured him. \u00a0\u201cLook, you hit a deer. \u00a0It happens. \u00a0But you did everything right. \u00a0You slowed down, you kept the truck right side up and the damage isn\u2019t bad.\u201d\n\nSteve was a little relieved. \u201cDon\u2019t we have to report this?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d I replied, taking the computer. \u201cThere\u2019s a rest area about twenty miles up the road. \u00a0Get us there and we\u2019ll call it a night.\u201d\n\nSteve looked out the windshield and noticed the headlight. \u00a0\u201cUh, can we drive with a headlight out?\u201d\n\n\u201cLegally, we can\u2019t begin a trip with a damaged headlight,\u201d I explained, \u201cBut the damage occurred in transit and since the truck is still mechanically drive-able, we have to continue until we can find a safe, legal place to stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, right!\u201d Steve said and finally started to relax. \u00a0He released the brakes and got us moving again while I sent our report to dispatch. \u00a0I made sure my description of the accident painted Steve in the best possible light. \u00a0Steve had a rough first week and I could tell he was very nervous. \u00a0Like me, he had taken a huge risk by quitting his old job and becoming a truck driver. \u00a0I knew of several trainers in the company that would have read the riot act to him and put him off the truck. \u00a0While I had a reputation for breaking less-committed students, I was equally known for being fair and having my rookie\u2019s back when they deserved it.\n\nBy the time we got to the rest area, I had sent the report to dispatch and informed them we\u2019d be shutting down until the morning. \u00a0I instructed them to inform maintenance to make arrangements with a shop I knew of along our route to get a replacement headlight the next morning. \u00a0I also read the report aloud for Steve\u2019s sake so he would know that I wasn\u2019t going to throw him under the bus. \u00a0\n\nThe next morning, I took over and drove us to the repair shop. \u00a0Fortunately, the weather was clear so the headlights weren\u2019t needed. \u00a0The drive was uneventful, but that would prove to be the only uneventful part of the day. \u00a0I pulled in to shop, conveniently located at a truck stop, and checked in with the front desk. \u00a0To no one\u2019s surprise, the Maintenance department had completely dropped the ball and failed make the arrangements. \u00a0To make matters worse, the shop didn\u2019t have a replacement headlight in stock and, given that it was a Sunday, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get one until the next morning. \u00a0This was a problem since the DOT regulations made it very clear that a trip cannot begin unless all required vehicle lights were in working order and the delivery deadline was set for 6:00 PM.\n\nI went back to the truck and filled Steve in on the situation. \u00a0I had already decided to use this as a teaching moment for Steve about handling maintenance situations. \u00a0I sent a message to dispatch, telling them that delivery would be late due a bad headlight. \u00a0And that\u2019s were things got interesting.\n\nA common theme with trucking companies is that weekend dispatch staff can be graded a lot like high school sports teams. \u00a0Weekday dispatchers are the first string, weeknights would be second string and weekends\u2026well, lets just say that when you put these guys in the game, you really have nothing to loose at that point.\n\nWhen our dispatcher, lets call him Aaron for reasons that will become obvious, responded, he couldn\u2019t understand why we chose to shut down. \u00a0When I explained to him AGAIN that, as per DOT regulations, the truck was not in roadworthy condition. \u00a0It might seem nit-picky, but I had already had an unpleasant run-in with the Oregon DOT and realized that they don\u2019t have much love for commercial trucks. \u00a0Besides, if I got a ticket for faulty equipment, dispatch would deny ever telling me \u201cjust go\u201d.\n\nAaron replied with what had to be the most asinine remark I have, to date, ever heard from a dispatcher. \u00a0His response was, and I quote, \u201cIs it dark outside?\u201d\n\nApparently, this benchwarmer was just promoted from Towel Boy. \u00a0\u201cHey, Steve,\u201d I said to my student, \u201cthis isn\u2019t on your grade sheet, but today you\u2019re gonna learn how to deal with idiot dispatchers.\u201d \u00a0I had his attention.\n\nOne thing all trucks in our company were required to carry was a current edition of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, or FMCSR for short. \u00a0Not exactly a page-turner but it does come in handy. \u00a0I wrote a reply to Aaron, telling him that, as the driver of the vehicle, I felt that the damaged headlight violated regulations and, therefore, we were down until it could be repaired. \u00a0In an attempt to be diplomatic, I told him that once the headlight arrived, I could replace it myself in a few minutes instead of waiting hours for an open spot at the shop. \u00a0Aaron, however didn\u2019t like that.\n\n\u201cYou have to deliver the load TODAY! \u00a0You don\u2019t need to wait for a new headlight.\u201d\n\nWhy did I give this dispatcher the name Aaron? \u00a0Well, a few weeks before this, I had seen a video clip from Keenan and Peele. \u00a0It was the video of a former inner city school teacher substituting for a suburban science class. \u00a0It was sent to me by a former student and we had been quoting it ever since. \u00a0When the last reply came in, a quote from that clip went through my head.\n\n\u201cYou done messed up, A-A-RON! \u00a0You done messed up!\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, Steve,\u201d I said, taking out my copy of the FMSCR, \u201cNow I\u2019m gonna show you how to use this thing.\u201d\n\nAfter my months-long adventure with FK, I learned that a driver has to be able to look out for himself. \u00a0Dispatchers only cared about getting loads delivered and not getting blamed for problems. \u00a0I also learned that, despite a company saying that \u201cSafety is Our Top Priority\u201d, they tend to get amnesia about that when their boss comes down on them for a customer complaint. \u00a0Having a backbone is an unspoken requirement for a trucker.\n\nI went through the book and looked up every single regulation regarding lights on a commercial vehicle and included it in my reply to Aaron. \u00a0I wrote down every regulation verbatim, including the numerical code for each regulation. \u00a0I also pointed out that nowhere in the FMSCR did regulations grant an exemption for clear daytime weather. \u00a0Furthermore, since the company was listed as a forced-dispatch company (meaning I could not refuse an assignment) I had to follow his instructions, but seeing as how I had repeatedly said that the truck was not roadworthy, that the company would be held responsible for any violation incurred since the entire exchange was documented. \u00a0A driver who had a busted headlight would get a ticket, but a company who TOLD the driver to drive with busted headlight would get an investigation that would make a prostate exam feel like a massage by comparison. \u00a0I didn\u2019t wait for Aaron to reply before heading out.\n\nHalf-way to the delivery, I heard the computer ding. \u00a0Steve, who was riding shotgun, picked it up and read Aaron\u2019s reply. \u00a0\u201cHe wants us to wait \u2018till tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo late, \u201c I said. \u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to turn around.\u201d \u00a0That wasn\u2019t a lie since Portland isn\u2019t very truck-friendly.\n\nWe made the delivery and I drove us to another truck stop south of Portland that also had repair shop. \u00a0We managed to avoid any encounters with Johnny Law, although I was somewhat disappointed since that would have been a REAL learning experience for Aaron. \u00a0But you cant have everything.\n\nI pulled into the truck stop and checked with the shop. \u00a0Of course, they didn\u2019t have a replacement headlight in stock either and it would be the next day before they could get it. \u00a0I went back to the truck, filled Steve in on what was going on. \u00a0I then decided to word my update for my new friend Aaron.\n\nI took the computer and wrote, \u201cWe made delivery as instructed and are now shut down at a truck stop. \u00a0I have already made arrangements with the shop for a new headlight. \u00a0The said it will be late tomorrow before they can get us in, so I\u2019ll replace it myself once it comes in. \u00a0Until then, we are not going anywhere. \u00a0I will let you know when we are good to go.\u201d\n\nSteve was a little nervous. \u00a0He was young and had never seen someone stand up to their \u201cboss\u201d before. \u00a0I told him not to worry since this whole ordeal would be on me and I had a history with things like this. \u00a0After all, if they chose to fire me, a little email to the DOT containing a few screenshots would look very good for a wrongful termination lawsuit.\n\nAaron\u2019s eventual reply was only three words. \u00a0\u201cOk. Sounds good.\u201d \u00a0And that was the last I ever heard from him.\n\nThe next morning, the shop called to let us know our headlight had come in. \u00a0Steve and I managed to install it very quickly and let dispatch know we were ready to go. \u00a0After half an hour, my Fleet Manager called me. \u00a0Bear in mind, this was the same Fleet Manager I had during the First Kevin fiasco.\n\n\u201cOP, what the hell is going on?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m assuming you mean the thing with Aaron?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou really scared that guy,\u201d she said. \u00a0She went on to explain that Aaron had taken the issue to his supervisor who, as it turned out, explained to him that you NEVER go against a driver\u2019s assessment regarding safety or mechanical issues. \u00a0He told him that had I gotten a ticket, the company would be liable.\n\nI found the whole thing hilarious. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know what to tell you, FM.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust stop being so hard on the new guys. \u00a0Please!\u201d \u00a0she asked in a slightly motherly tone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try. \u00a0Promise\u201d I said and hung up. \u00a0Before long, she sent us another load and we were off.\n\nAnd there, the story ends. \u00a0I apologize if this tale isn\u2019t in the same league as my previous installments, but this was just a one off. \u00a0I\u2019ve read all the messages you\u2019ve sent to me over the past year and not being able to make regular posts have has been on my mind constantly. \u00a0Unfortunately, I can\u2019t promise Ill post with any regularity, but like I told FM, \u201cI\u2019ll try. \u00a0Promise!\u201d\n\nUntil next time, this is Strongbadjr signing off.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1670866333.0},{"title":"Aunt Karvina: The House Owner","author":"Easterchu","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/zgwyee\/aunt_karvina_the_house_owner\/","text":"Hi everyone, sorry for the year long delay. Things at home hasn't been going so well. I've now ran away from a situation (which I won't say in too much detail for any legal reason) but this might be my last Aunt Karvina story. First is to answer some questions.\n\nDoes my aunt have any mental illness? If she does, no one told me anything. She does have one physical injury and that would be her bad leg. She likes to complain about it like a soldier from WWII telling the story of how they lost their leg from a land mine. Unless she's seen a doctor of sorts like a psychologist, I hope she's seeing one now. One thing I remember is that she loves to drink. This is important later.\n\nNow for my final story. My aunt (no relation) is a weird woman. My mother connected with her when she was at a party. Nothing too wrong there I guess. Then that's when the almost 10 years of torment has begun. \n\nFirst, aunt Karvina can't clean properly, but she works as a cleaner. It was foul how she can do the dishes, the washing but not vacuum, sweep, mop or keep a client.\n\nSecond, she compares herself to Gordon Ramsay when her cooking is shit. She wouldn't survive one second on Kitchen Nightmares.\n\nThird, she's a terrible gift giver. She keeps giving me undies because I might need a lot of them. I felt like an aussie dad on Christmas every time she visits every week. She even throws away the recept so we can't return them. She gave us dirty boxes that gets sticky and attracts bugs. I swore we had not one cockroach infestation before those boxes arrived.\n\nAnd now, the house story. I got hired to do some yard work for aunt Karvina. No harm in that. Just clear up the lawn, clean up some dog poop, then mow the lawn every fortnight right? Oh dear reader I wish that was the case.\n\nAunt Karvina is generous enough to pick me up...in her messy car that looked disgusting. There was old lollies, leftover take out that got mould and that's supposed to be her cleaning care.\n\nThen her Castle of The Decaying Sanity. She lives in what I can call a hoarder house. Not that there's too much stuff, but there will be uneaten food on dirty plates either in the sink or lounge room, fluff from dog toys everywhere, food scattered throughout from the untamed beast assault, flies flying so fondly of her fragrant bird shit, the sound of rats going at the dog food in the other room and the smell....do I need to explain?\n\nAs usual, I do the lawn, have water, do this, do that and I get paid $50 dollars worth of work...which lowered to $30...and then $10...and back up to $20. It turns out that my parents paid her $100 dollars so I can get paid half, but she didn't keep her side of the deal. She would often use the extra money to afford alcohol. That's probably what started this whole mess. She obviously don't drink and drive, but she gets black out drunk at the end of the day and wake up like nothing happens. And my parents tried to talk to her about it, but she still gets away with it. Now my payment is Hungry Jack's (Aussie Burger King) \n\nWhat's even worse, her hoarding somehow influenced my mother and my house is overwhelmed with junk. One of the reasons why I have nightmares. They still never left me after August. \n\nAunt Karvina did eventually moved house, but it's still ended up the same even though she promised to keep up to code. It's frustrating and so far, she's still come over every now and then making mostly me uncomfortable. My parents can tolerate her, but I ran out of patients. No longer I'll be doing her lawn for a Whopper anymore. I now have a stable job away from this nightmare of a life.\n\nThank you for your time to read the ending of Aunt Karvina. I don't know what she's doing now, but I can't say for certain it got better.

He still believes that we were lying and called me as well as wanted to speak to the manager about this new movie he's been dying to watch, I believe it was a Bruce Lee remake called Fist of the Dragon or something along that line, here's how it went.\n\nI'm dumping the used 3D glasses into a cardboard box and taping it so they can be taken to the 3D glass recycling center (a joke my coworkers and I made up), when the phone rings.\n\nMe: hello this is Regalia Cinema, Dragon_Crystal speaking, how may I help you today?\n\nKevin: are you showing Fist of the Dragon soon?\n\nMe: um hold on let me check on the showing listing.

For this assignment I tended to fly in every couple weeks and stay for a few days to help the staff out with specific problems they encountered while I was away and helping them with regulatory requirements they need to implement. \n\nThe development center is small group of people and a mix of young local Thai and expats from mostly Europe and Asia. The expats enjoyed the nightlife in Bangkok a lot, and on occasion I would join them. I\u2019ve seen all the night life, Gogo bars and strip clubs and been in all the right and wrong Soi\u2019s (Alleys) with a good crowd. Good times.\n\nMen being men; from time to time some of them ended up with a girl in their rooms and a couple of thousand baht less in their wallet a few hours later. But all the expats understood that while you can have a good time with a girl like that; you should stay level headed and understand you are just paying for a fantasy. It\u2019s not a maintainable lifestyle. Pay your bills, stay safe, don\u2019t cause trouble and have your moment of happiness and move on. They understood. Kevin did not.\n\nKevin was a new expat in the team. Coming from the main branch and managed to get his way into the Bangkok office because he was having his midlife crisis. Older fellow in mid-40\u2019s but looking closer to late 50\u2019s. He didn\u2019t seem to be too bright or thinking about things much; his work was mediocre at best and his personality was best described as boring; though he tried to be one of the cool old guys. Emphasis on tried.\n\nNot to be exclusionary they invited him to go out with them on a Friday night. I happened to be in Bangkok as well; and as his introduction to the nightlife they decided to hit up places of vice, lust and greed. Mr. boring loved every moment of it; a little too much if you asked me and it would be the start of a wild time in his life with progressively worse decisions.\n\nThe problem is that putting someone like Kevin in an environment like this is they start to feel invincible and empowered by their new found attention by girls half their age (attractive or not) and his decision making \u2013 already bordering on bad \u2013 took a turn for the worse. He was like a kid in the candy shop. While hesitant at first he ended the night in the early hours of the morning going home with a girl that had a look on her face saying \u201cbetter than nothing I guess\u201d. I felt for her.\n\nHe came in on Monday morning clearly hangover and exhausted. Apparently he had caught the bug and spend Saturday and Sunday night in the same districts and sleeping with another few girls. Well; he had his fun. Nobody at the office cared too much and left him alone. Rite of passage they called it. Welcome to Bangkok. \n\nWhen the next Friday came around they wanted to go out again with the boys. But to the usual clubs they went too; avoiding the worst of the lust, vice and greed the city offers and just have some fun between themselves. Kevin became agitated like a little kid and kept pestering them to go to new places he hasn\u2019t been yet. It is creepy seeing an older man be a predatory man-child.\n\nEventually some of them relented and took him to some other places he hadn\u2019t been yet. I left on Sunday. But from the chat I had with one of the guys; I heard he came in late, hungover and exhausted again on Monday. The chat died down after that; I was busy with many other assignments and forgot about it. He was boring after all; and someone sleeping with hookers isn\u2019t exactly exiting material.\n\nWhen I came back 6 weeks later; I got a big update. Apparently Kevin had kept up this behavior and while his work didn\u2019t suffer too much (cause it wasn\u2019t very good to begin with) some people were starting to get concerned enough about him about a few weeks in. One seasoned (s)expat that had seen it all and two of the Thai guys took him apart to talk to him about having to slow down and the cautionary tales of people that had done the same as him. He said he would quit in the end and it seemed to work for a while. But things were about to get a whole lot worse. \n\nWhile he stopped going with them on Friday and Saturday nights; he seemed to go at it alone for most of the week. He knew where to go; and nobody tells him what to do; the girls loved him and understood him; even when they did not speak English beside the little fragments they picked up and quoting the price for drinks and fun.\n\nHe decided to continue and the guys decided they warned him enough and he was old enough to make his own decisions; no matter how poor they are. They would just listen to him complain and laugh it off between them and wait until his year abroad was finished. By the time I got back a few weeks later a lot had happened.\n\n* One of the girls he met told him she wanted out of the business and he ended up offering her an non-existent job as office manager at the company (he has no rights to offer anybody anything) for a salary that was even more ridiculous. Surprisingly enough she had showed up on Monday morning at the office to start her new job confusing everybody there; eventually they got her to go home.\n* At some point in the conversation it became clear that Kevin was not using condoms with his girls unless they were bothersome about it. He never had an STD test done. Thought they were for gays only and genuinely thought condoms were for pregnancy only, and the only STD that existed was HIV\/AIDS and since he wasn\u2019t having sex with ladyboys or gays he was fine. He got worried after he was told that\u2019s not how it is. And when he had the test done and found to have chlamydia he made sure everyone at the office knew he had it, he was going to die and wish he knew about this earlier. Nobody wished to know he had chlamydia.   \n \n* At some point he learned about in-call \u201cmassages\u201d and gave our business address for a girl that did massages. He did not see anything wrong with getting a message with a happy end at work. He was surprised the Thai guys looked at him as if he lost their mind; this is normal in their culture, right? RIGHT!? Needless to say the girl and Kevin were send away that day.\n* He had become regular enough to be recognized by most of the girls in the bars; and if they can get a regular guy for steady income they will play the game and cry crocodile tears about cheating on her when he is seen with other girls. He was very susceptible for this and every other week he would be at work clearly concerned about this fake drama and which girl he should choose over the other one and tell it to everyone who didn\u2019t want to hear.\n* He kept telling everyone he loved Thai food. Thai Sushi is so nice. Turns out he has mostly been in the Japanese restaurants around this area. (Bangkok has a sizeable Japanese population; hence the restaurants). When they eventually took him to a Thai local restaurant he boasted he could do the spicy. He obviously couldn\u2019t. He spend the entire night telling everyone how spicy it was; at least the moments he was able to talk.\n* Though he was warned; he thought looking like a big spender would make him more attractive for the \u201cright\u201d ladies. He got popular enough for sure; at the en of the night the guy was 15.000 baht (\\~425USD\/EUR) lighter and had to replace all his cards; including ID. Not having learned his lesson the first time; he got his wallet stolen another 2 times in 4 weeks\u2019 time. Racking up 50.000 baht in damages (\\~1400USD\/EUR) before he finally learned his lesson.\n* He was told he would need a re-entry stamp from immigration to keep his visa valid if he was going abroad; which he did on a weekend trip. He was reminded by the other expats; company documentation and it is stamped in his passport and he still managed to not do it; causing his visa to be invalidated. But as he was allowed a tourist visa they still let him in; by the time he found out he had been overstaying for weeks and ended up having to hire a visa lawyer to get things sorted out. That\u2019s how he made a 900 baht (\\~25USD\/EUR) stamp and a couple hours of his time into tens of thousands off baht in fees and fines for immigration.\n\nYou would think that by the time I came back to Bangkok he would have got bored of it and straightened his life out. But not Kevin; things only get worse for him.\n\nSo by the time I came back they told me the story he had wandered into a ladyboy bar. Honest mistake. It\u2019s hard to see sometimes, some don\u2019t specify it, some are mixed and well when you are drunk it all blends in together anyway. The guys he was with didn\u2019t mind, and didn\u2019t tell him anything to mess with him. No what they didn\u2019t know was that Kevin was a bit of a bigot about this. Eventually he found out when he was already down a sizable amount of money and Mr. boring became mister Angry who refused to pay for his and the lady drinks (lady drinks are the high priced drinks you have to pay for each girl sitting next to you; around every 10 minutes). Shouting every trans-slur he could think of (and most there did not understand luckily). \n\nEventually he paid and left; mostly because the club called in their security; and Kevin was in no state or shape to do anything to them. Or so we thought. Before he would leave he reached out to hit the ladyboy he had trouble with; though it was more a weak slap. But to her credit; that ladyboy could pull a punch still and gave him a nice bruise on his face.\n\nAfter that incident he was surprisingly silent around the office. I guess it hurt his masculinity and ego. Maybe that was all he needed to bring himself back to reality. I left without further incident and wouldn\u2019t be back for another 6 months because the project I worked on with them wrapped up and the new one would not require me until 6 months in. \n\nWhen I came back Kevin wasn\u2019t there anymore. Asking what happened to this Adonis of the Bangkok nightlife I got the rest of the story. Apparently he had found love in one of the bars; a girl called Tree they told me; obviously not her real name. Quit his job in the days after (which invalidates his visa; and he definitely knew after last time) and eloped with the girl. Nobody had heard from him in months until he send one of the expat guys a message on Instagram telling him Thailand was a terrible country, he had been fined and deported based on the fact that he had no valid visa and wished he never come to Thailand. That he never met all the woman cause all the wanted was his money; Tree had left him as soon as the money had run out. \n\nYeah Kevin; they warned you. \n\n**TL;DR:** Kevin goes to work in Bangkok; searches for love in all the wrong places. Goes off the rails despite ample warnings and advice. Ends up deported.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1669774003.0},{"title":"Kevin, a work colleague, believes in immobile cutlery.","author":"zoopysreign","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/z7lcha\/kevin_a_work_colleague_believes_in_immobile\/","text":"Kevin, a grown man with adult children and who is the head of a global team, decided to take a trip to an Asian country with his family. \n\nHe had never been to Asia and was very concerned that there would be no forks, since he, not surprisingly, cannot use chopsticks. \n\nHis solution?

Kevin sets the groceries onto the counter, but doesn\u2019t quite push the milk far enough in and it topples over the side and onto the floor. The jug cracks open, and milk begins pouring out across the kitchen. Immediately, Kevin leaps into action. He runs down the hall to grab a towel from the linen closet so that he can quickly clean up the mess before it spreads. He throws it over the spill, but rapidly assesses that he will need another towel. Again he runs to the linen closet, grabs another towel, and runs back to the kitchen to sop up the milk.

Our own parents act like I'm crazy when I suggest that Kevin might be intellectually disabled, they just shrug it off and say \"that's how he is\". \n\nOver the last year, my parents have even gotten to the point of saying I am \"disrespecting the family\" by moving to a different state, I lived at home for all of college since Kevin didn't go to college and still lives at home.

They discontinued it and when the waiter told Kevin about this, Kevin threatened to \"break a breadstick off in yo ass.\" \n\nKevin shoved tomatillos (little green tomatoes with thick papery skins) up his ass because he read a post online that you could taste spicy food if you put it up there. Tomatillos aren't even spicy. \n\nKevin explained to dad that a dildo is really pronounced \"did-lo\", then called him a \"fudge packer\" (mid 20th century homophobic slur) . \n\nKevin broke an ankle after jumping down the stairs on one leg and popping his ankle, then falling down the stairs yelling racial slurs and saying that an \"indian guy must have designed the house\". \n\nKevin asked me why I went to college.

There's a car ahead of us!\" Sure enough there was, left diagonally across an intersection. He says \"I bet it's been hotwired!\", leaps out of my car into it and switches it on.

It felt off, and it was said to have an underground stream. The slumlord offered very low rent and this drew the poor, unemployed, early career types, some of whom were Kevins.\n\nKevin One was more of an arsehole, whose only life skill was putting his hand in others' pockets. His social skill was back stabbing and it took a very short leap to work out he would be two faced in your absence too. His physique was akin to a paper clip, so apart from being extremely annoying you kind of felt a magnetic attraction to place your fist in his face. We'll call him \"The Weed\". Weed decided to keep the living room as his bedroom so it was kind of poetic justice when he copped the home invasion.\n\n**Night of the Kevin** Kevin was asleep in his living room\/bed room, behind his privacy curtain, and somehow didn't hear the back door that-never-got-fixed being kicked in. The first he knew was when the light went on. He yelled for them to switch it off and they did. Then it came back on and was followed by a barrage of objects over the curtain. The only one I ever had identified was a huge ceramic ashtray, weighed a ton, lived on the floor and was never cleaned out. He ran out through this rain to meet some guys armed with his frying pan who put forward that he'd ripped them off on drugs. He countered he had not (one of the few times he ever actually told the truth), then they proposed it was time for him to lie on the ground and get bashed, KA-BONG. Nearby Flatmate Two was awoken by the \"No, don't, KA-BONG!\", and proceeded to chase them off with a club, flagging down a taxi to get the cops. Flatmate Three slept through and earned himself a hate boner from The Weed. \n\n**Week of the Kevin** Flatmates Two and Three moved out, that back door was never fixed and would give free access to the next home invaders, plus still no phone. They were replaced by Kevin Two. It was not his fault he had schizophrenia, it was 100% his fault he'd trigger it, maybe a little drugs binge, maybe staying up for a week, and generally when he'd get out of hospital he'd decide it meant he was spontaneously cured and have another week-long stay-up drugs-binge. He stayed up for a week and had a drugs binge and went fully Mr Hyde on The Weed. Every hour made Weed weaker as he didn't dare let down his guard and go to sleep, where every hour made Kevin Two stronger and more schitzo. A friendly visitor stuck his head in that door that-never-got-fixed bursting the bubble, with Kevin Two going back to the hospital and The Weed finally sleeping, then moving out.\n\n**Return of the Kevin** Kevins Three and Four were a pair of right new age wankers whose paltry possessions included a huge chunk of crystal quartz. Kevin Two drove back to the house, let himself in via that door that-never-got-fixed and proceeded to menace them all night with his deranged ranting. In sweet mercy's name he drove off in the morning and Kevins Three and Four agreed they hadn't enjoyed the experience, possibly as they wanted to reach nirvana via meditation, not by having a violent dickhead blow up the house with the gas stove. That evening the car drove back, so Kevin Three took Plan B: run. As Kevin Two was blocking the only exit he climbed a surprisingly high cyclone fence and begged the neighbours to call the cops. Meanwhile Kevin Four was caught unawares in bed by Kevin Two, who smashed the crystal into teeny pieces on his bedroom floor. Lo, comes a new character: Mr Policeman. Kevin Two attempted his \"disguise as human\" save roll, fumbled, going for \"He he he, look at my great big stupid psychotic face\" to \"What could be the problem, officer\" but instead landing on \"He he he -- argh ... uh ... \". Mr Policeman took him away and also disabled the car by taking \"something\" out of the engine and throwing it in the long grass. Kevins Three and Four were not car people, so no idea there. He returned a month later, all stabilised, only to find his car wouldn't start. So he shame facedly went back in through that door that-never-got-fixed and pleaded with his former victims, \"Look, I don't want any trouble, I just want my car.\", Kevin Three showed him the place they threw his car part. He fitted it and drove off.\n\nReading this back, it's less about the Kevins or the house but their possessions; Kevins Three and Four's crystal that got weaponized, Kevin Two's car that baited him to go back and confront his victims when it wasn't funny anymore and most of all The Weed's frying pan.

As children in elementary (or 'primary' from where I live) school, we all had recounts of making mistakes that ended with a scolding from teachers. But there was one Kevin in particular who was something else. He must have been at least 10 years old during that time, considering I was only a grade above him. In our concert band, he was a keyboard player who has gotten on the conductor's nerves more than a dozen of times during rehearsals. Below are 3 of his most memorable antics.\n\n* Kevin would hit a note on the keyboard when the conductor was talking to the whole band, in an otherwise silent hall. This happened not once but several times. My only guess is that he wanted to play a game of making a sound without her noticing, while the instrument is on full volume. It's no surprise he never won.\n* We had trolleys that were designed to hold music stands. One time as we were all packing up and for some reason, Kevin decided to take a little joyride by revving up one of the trolleys before standing on it with both feet. I wouldn't be mentioning this here if it weren't for the fact that he tried zipping past, 1 metre in front of the conductor. Again, I could only presume he was daring himself to not get caught by her. Like the first point I made, he wasn't successful.\n* This last one has the be the most shocking example. One time, we had to perform at a venue which meant some heavier pieces of gear had to be carried to and from the bus. After returning to the school on a rather late afternoon, they had to be returned to the storage room. A few boys were given the responsibility to wheel in the timpanis. I happened to be carrying a few cymbals when I noticed a gnarling sound behind me. Here was Kevin, dragging a bass drum on the playground's asphalt. A split second later, I heard the angriest screech that almost made my nerves short circuit. My band's conductor, mortified and furious, yelled at him to stop on the spot before chewing him out so thoroughly, that he might as well have been a figurative beef jerky that day. Only when we turned over the drum to see splinters on the rim, Kevin learned about friction the hard way.\n\nThese were all the things that I happened to witness. Not much, but felt they'd be worth sharing.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1667308630.0},{"title":"\"The I stands for...\"","author":"Infinityskull","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/yf7jv2\/the_i_stands_for\/","text":"My coworker propelled herself into Kevinhood the other night.\n\nFirst, a bit of background on this girl. She's still pretty new at the job so I cut her some slack even when she makes some really annoying mistakes. I'll admit she's not my favorite coworker, she gets on my nerves a lot, but we can work together. \n\nIt was a quieter night, so we were chatting a bit while we waited for customers to come in. During our conversation, I told her that I'm bisexual and dating a woman. Kevina started asking questions like \"How do gay relationships work?\" \"Who's the man and who's the woman?\" \"Who wears the tuxedo at the wedding?\" I was nice about answering her questions, even if they were rubbing me the wrong way, because we live in a fairly religious area and I figured it wasn't her fault for being a little sheltered about stuff.\n\nAnyway, she asked me what all the letters in LGBTQIA2+ meant, so I started explaining them:\n\nMe: Yeah, so after the Q is the I for-\"\n\nKevina: Oh, I know. Incest.\n\nMe: What?\n\nKevina: I for incest.\n\nMe: No... it's... not incest.\n\nKevina: Whatever, same idea, right?\n\nMe: No, it's not! It stands for intersex!\n\nKevina: Nah, I'm pretty sure it stands for incest.\n\nAt that point, we got some customers, and my shift was over not long after that, so I left without finishing that conversation.\n\nNow, thinking that the I is for incest alone wouldn't be enough to make her a Kevina. No, what makes her a Kevina is the simple fact that after I told her what the I actually stands for, she just flat out rejected the truth. I can deal with ignorance, but not willful ignorance.\n\nThat said, I think there's still hope for this girl to pull herself out of the depths of Kevinhood, she's still pretty young, so maybe in a few years she'll smarten up a bit and get all embarrassed whenever she remembers this conversation. Until then, however, only time will tell.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1666914813.0},{"title":"Part 4 of stories of my Kevin brother in-law","author":"S1mon_B3ufont","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/ydn2dl\/part_4_of_stories_of_my_kevin_brother_inlaw\/","text":"A few months ago I posted three stories about my Kevin brother in law.

Their dislike for each other started after the birth of Kevin\u2019s second child when my grandmother gave my sister and Kevin a thousand dollars and Kevin didn\u2019t thank my grandmother for the thousand a few days later when him and my sister were on a video call with our mother and grandmother. A few months ago my grandmother got my sister a car and again Kevin did not thank her during a call.\n\nKevin the gladiator:\n\nKevin wished that he was alive during the gladiator during the gladiator age. Kevin is also terrified of shots and after a shot he would complain for days about how much it hurts.\n\nKevin and Kevina:\n\nMy sister\u2019s best friend is a Kevin. She can read and she has a job in bio science but she is a big Kevina. Kevina thinks that she is the most important person and has a very out there personality but Kevina is very kind and helpful to my sister. Kevin and Kevina hate each other. They hate each other because Kevina yelled at Kevin because Kevin was hanging out with his friends instead of helping my sister during her second pregnancy. Kevina and Kevina\u2019s mother visited my sister\u2019s house for a week after she was released from the hospital to help her out after giving birth. Kevin knew they were going to visit days before they did but when they arrived Kevin got scared and jumped out of the window and ran away so he wouldn\u2019t have to see them.

Make of that what you will...\n\nI (18M) worked my summer job this year at a hardware store in the Midwest USA. It's a smaller franchised hardware store, not a giant one like Lowe's or Home Depot, so the owner has a bit more freedom to do what they want. In this case, Kevin is the owner's son, and the owner (probably illegally) hired Kevin for $18\/hr, significantly more than we make. And as I will show you below, he *definitely* didn't deserve such a wage. \n\nThere were three main tasks that summer-job teenagers like myself and Kevin had; Cashier duty, sales, and stocking shelves. Kevin did ok, barring a few minor incidents, with stocking shelves- but the other two were chaos every time he got near them. \n\nOn my first day, I was working with Kevin and a friend of mine from school, we will call him Jake. Then there were two full time employees staffing the store, an old guy, let's call him Walter, and an even older woman (the store manager) who will be named Edith (these are the best old people names i've got). Kevin had Cashier duty, Jake had sales, I had shelf-stocking, and Walter was the second cashier. \n\n**A Kevin Welcome:** \n\nMe and Jake both got started on our respective tasks for our first day and did everything pretty much by the book until around 11am. We had been open for a couple hours when Kevin sauntered in, but nobody had really noticed him missing since Jake and I didnt know he existed yet and Walter barely had anyone to serve as cashier anyway, so Kevin wasnt really needed. But soon, he strolled up to me and Jake while we were in an aisle and said, \"Sooooo, we've got some fresh meat\" in the most ridiculous movie bully voice ever.\n\nWe laughed at him, and he walked off to his cashier station huffing and puffing. Then he turned around and yelled back, \"Show me some respect, rookies!\". \n\nAbout five seconds later Kevin walks into a shelf and shrieks in pain. He goes up to the cashier station and about ten minutes later he gets a customer. \n\nNow, I didn't see the initial incident, but I sure heard it. Someone was buying a some lawn decorations, one of which was a giant glass ball in the shape of a frog. I'm sure you see where this is going. Kevin dropped it and it smashed, then refused to refund the customer, a little old lady. By now Walter had got on the intercom and called me up front to open the other lane while they cleaned up. \n\nI run up front and see the shitshow unfolding. Rather than help Walter who is on his hands and knees picking up tiny glass shards, he decides to argue with the 90-year old, yelling at her for buying \"stupid frog art that looks like an anal bead\". I tried to keep Walter's lane moving because three people were in line, but everyone was watching Kevin berate an old lady at the top of his high, squeaky voice. \n\nWalter finally managed to wrest the cashier station keyboard from Kevin and refunds the old woman, and apologizes to her for Kevin's actions. About an hour later, I get the chance to ask Walter what the hell is wrong with Kevin. \n\n\"Oh, he's the owner's son. He's worked here for three days.\"\n\nIt was at this moment I realized it would be a long summer. \n\n**Mexico Will Pay For The Drywall:**\n\nKevin was a conservative. He made sure EVERYONE knew this, starting every second conversation with a political comment. So on my second day, I was cashiering, Kevin was in sales and Jake was stocking shelves. \n\nKevin started the day by walking in yelling at the top of his voice that taxes are too high and nobody needs social security, because \"society is already secure! We have cops!\" No idea why he thought to do this...\n\nKevin decided it would be a good idea to ask a customer who was buying blue paint for their walls at home why they are putting Democrat colors in their house. The customer walked out. Edith witnessed this and reprimanded Kevin, but obviously nobody wants to say anything to the owners son. \n\nNot twenty minutes have passed with Kevin unsupervised when I walk by to find him switching out every can of blue paint with a red one. At this point, my thought process is that I don't get paid enough to deal with this, and it's not my problem. So I keep walking. Well, Kevin felt slighted by me laughing at him the day before, so he quickly walks out of the aisle, gets on the intercom, and yells for Edith. \n\nWell, about ten minutes later Edith walks up to me and informs me that Kevin blamed the paint thing on me. Edith looked at the cameras and saw it was clearly Kevin, but she let me know to try to steer clear of Kevin because he liked to make other people feel bad. \n\n**Hail Damage? Hail Satan:** \n\nA few days of blatant stupidity followed the incidents above, but nothing quite as crazy. \n\nKevin put wasp spray in the paint section since he said it was used to paint walls. He also brought a tube of toothpaste from home and jammed it into the cash drawer during a shift change, leaving the drawer open and unattended for over an hour. \n\nBut things really ramped up again after about a week. There was a forecast for severe storms later in the week, so an older couple, both wearing Metallica shirts, came in to buy some plastic sheeting and stakes to cover their garden. Kevin was doing sales that day. The shit hit the fan. \n\nThe husband explained that he had tomatoes and wanted to keep them safe from the storm. So Kevin, being who he is, explained to them that \"if you didnt listen to devil music, god would keep you safe. Try praying once in a while.\" Well, the customer just didnt find this amusing. The couple walked out and left a cart with $300 in other merchandise. \n\n**Kan't Kancel Kevin:**\n\nAbout a week on from that last incident, Kevin got in trouble (i wasnt there this day) for doing a \"shitler salute\"- a Hitler salute while grabbing his ass. He claimed it was anti Nazi. But his dad the owner came into the store and let us all know he \"talked to him about it\". \n\nWell, Kevin came back the next day and at this point me and Jake had just learned to ignore him. But Kevin approaches us during a break and asks without any prior conversation, \"are y'all [gay slur]s?\"\n\nWe stand slack-jawed in amazement that he would ask that, and Jake quickly responds, \"no, thats kind of not okay, man...\" \n\nKevin goes absolutely ballistic. He begins explaining in detail how any man who spends time with another man is gay, and how being gay makes god cry. Kevin claimed, \"you fucked last night and that's why it's raining outside now, cuz god is crying.\". I really had no words, but Jake did, who told him to \"go fuck his cousin in a log cabin\", referring to Kevin's love of country music and camo t shirt. \n\nJake got a call from the boss that night, telling him he'd be fired if he ever spoke that way to his son again. Jake tried explaining what Kevin said, but to no avail. The boss just said his son had good Christian values. \n\n**Kevin Doesn't Understand Goats:** \n\nKevin developed a weird obsession with goats around the middle of the year. Turns out, he saw a post online that jokingly said Russian troops were having sex with goats, so pretty soon Kevin started printing online art of goat human hybrids (mostly furry art) and posting them up in the livestock feed section with the caption, \"Warning: No Goatsucking\".  Because these ideas logically connect if you are a Kevin. Plus, to me a \"goatsucker\" means a desert cryptid, not a practitioner of beastiality, but I guess that's just me. \n\nBut the goat thing didn't stop there, oh, no way. He later tried explaining to me that humans are really descended from goats. His logic for this was that goats are called goats because they decided to \"go\" when other animals weren't evolving. Again, I feel insane just writing that out. \n\n**Duct Tape Kevin: Vent Problem?:**\n\nDuring the summer we had an issue where one of the air conditioning vents for the building wasn't working, which made that corner of the story really hot. He came up with the unusually coherent plan to close all the other vents and try to force air to that vent so we could see if any air was coming through at all. If there was some tiny amount of air, that would mean it was just blocked, not broken. Well, I tell him this is an OK idea and have him go do it. \n\nBut this was Kevin. Would anything be done the simple way? **Hell no!** Rather than pull the little lever on the side of each vent, he duct taped all eight other vents shut with three whole rolls of tape, which he of course took from the shelves without replacing or logging in inventory. We spent the next hour peeling tape from the vents, which was especially hard given that he **Crazy-glued the tape to the vents.** \n\nStill, the vent problem was still there. We didn't include Kevin in the next brainstorm, and Walter came up with a plan to just shove a garden stake from the outdoor department into the vent, and try to dislodge whatever was up there manually. \n\n\"Whatever was up there\" turned out to be three soccer balls. We didn't have a camera in the vents, since this is a hardware store, not Freddy Fazbear's. Nonetheless, I have a sneaking suspicion as to who put three soccer balls in the vent- and it ain't Lionel Messi. \n\nIf I'm being honest, this was way above all of our pay grades and maybe the real Kevin in this part was his dad, none of us were HVAC specialists. Still, I'm sure he couldn't afford it considering all the free passes he kept giving his son! \n\n**Karen Vs. Kevin:** \n\nKevin was bad enough with the normal customers that when we finally got our \"ultimate Karen\", Walter and I just stood around watching the show. \n\nThis woman walks in five minutes after the store opens and buys a GIGANTIC bird bath. This thing is like 4 feet tall and 150 pounds. She needs help to lift it, but Kevin sneers at her and makes me help her even though he's on sales for the day. \n\nWell, she comes through my lane and I ring it up for $220, which is the right price as shown on the tag. Karen, though, insists that it's $30. I ask why, and she walks over with me and points to the shelf, where a $30 clearance tag is hanging for the bag of bird feeder seed above. \n\nI explain to her that it's not $30 for the bird bath, but she points to it and says \"BUT THE TAG IS RIGHT THERE!\" \n\nI turn and whisper to Walter, and we decide to release the Kevin Kraken. \n\nI go back to the line, apologize to the other customers, and wave her to go see Kevin, who's standing at the customer service desk. \n\nAbout fifteen minutes later, I notice the two are still arguing. At this point, the woman is screaming at him, and he's giving it back to her. Except he's not talking about the product, he's trying to explain to her that \"birds don't need to bathe, they have a built in shower. That's why they're always scratching themselves.\" Give 'em hell, Kevin. \n\nKaren decides to take her phone out and start recording, and when Kevin keeps telling her she is a \"stupid boomer\" for wanting to \"give birds what god already gave them\", Karen demands to see the manager. Edith walks up and tells Karen to leave, and Karen then finishes the recording by saying that Kevin was defaming her by calling her a stupid boomer, and the store would soon be hearing from her lawyers. \n\nWe actually did. The woman sent a legal threat in the mail. Jake got fired for \"not helping his coworkers to deescalate the situation\" while he was on shelf stocking duty, even though nobody called him to the front. In the boss's opinion, Jake was willfully ignoring Kevin's (unspecified) intellectual disability. None of us had ever been told Kevin had an intellectual disability, though we'd be the Kevins if we didn't know considering all that he did. The next day would be my last at the store. \n\n**Hardware Hard-On:** \n\nThe day after the Karen incident, we ran out of metal poles. This is one of our more popular items, and we usually just get them in huge bulk and load ten or so out onto the shelf at once, so that if they fall to the floor, it isnt too much to deal with. I told Kevin to print out an \"out of stock\" message, assuming the guy could just go scrape something off Google images and put it out there. We of course don't have our own out of stock labels, since Kevin burned them when he set the microwave on fire in the break room, but that's a story for another time. \n\nKevin did not use Google images. Rather, he printed an... interesting image. \n\nToward the end of the shift that afternoon, I was walking by the metal section when I saw a strange image on a piece of paper hanging off the empty shelf, though I couldnt tell what it was. I walked up closer and could not believe what I was looking at. \n\nOn the left of the page was a map of Poland. On the right was a nude photograph of Kevin with a boner taken in the employee bathroom. \n\nBelow the two images was a caption: \"Metal Poles not found. Try these other poles.\" \n\nJust gonna present this one without comment. Anyway, I quit at the end of the day because Kevin blew up in a rage at me for throwing away the picture, yelling at me that I just threw it away because I hate polish people. Nothing about, y'know, the dick pic. \n\nKevin has called me a total of 67 times (I counted) since I quit from 13 phone numbers.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1666496172.0},{"title":"The Saga of the Deli Dumbass","author":"Fredrick_Denning","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/y78664\/the_saga_of_the_deli_dumbass\/","text":"For the past couple of years, I have been working at a local supermarket. Not a high paying job, but I'm not too worried about money at the moment. After finishing senior year of high school, being 18, I was given the opportunity to work in the Deli. Overall, it was a change of pace and meant better pay, so I jumped at the opportunity.\n\nMy first week went well. I joined up at the same time as another guy who was also pretty good at the job. Then, one week into the job, another employee joined up. Kevin was an interesting guy right from the start. On day one of the job, he was half an hour late getting back from his 15 minute break because he needed to finish his cigarettes. Not much of a big deal, but it was annoying. Things went downhill from there.\n\nFor three months, I dealt with the guy. I was still very new and trying to learn the ropes, but working with him made me look like a seasoned veteran of the culinary arts. The most complete list of his stupid actions that I can offer up:\n\nOverflowed the sinks on a daily basis - Kevin was put on dish duty on multiple occasions. Every time, it went down the same way. He turned the sinks on and watched them fill up. Nothing else. He didn't run dishes under the flowing water, he just sat there staring at it. This increased focus didn't help him either because everytime, he filled those sinks half a centimeter below capacity and then threw in a big pile of dishes, pushing the water past the limit.\n\nRuined the rotisserie oven mitts - Kevin also hated putting his hands in the water after he filled the sink. Reaching to the bottom to pull the plug was something he just couldn't do. This was an understandable situation. I don't like doing that either. We had a pair of rubber gloves by the sink for anybody that felt this way. Kevin preferred to grab the oven mitts for the rotisserie. These oven mitts were thick rubber gloves with foam inside. Because the sink was so overflowed however, when he did this, he soaked the gloves inside and out. Foam doesn't dry quickly. This also became a repeat occurance too, so we had to resort to hiding them in the bakery section of the store. This didn't stop him from looking for them every time he overflowed the sinks though.\n\nDark Web Deli - Kevin also worked REALLY slowly. Seriously, the guy took 40 minutes to do a five minute job. Flipping meat is simple. Pull tray, put lunch meat on new tray, put back in case. Repeat 7 more times. He realized that he wasn't good at it, so he chose to look up better meat flipping tactics on the internet, and when that failed, he chose to look for, and I am not shitting you, \"forbidden tactics off the dark web\". As I said earlier, there is one tactic. Pull tray, put meat on new tray, put ne tray in case. But if he wants to look up criminal deli tactics, who am I to stop him?\n\nMinor incidents:\n\nOffered to tape my tortilla wraps back together after I cut them in half to fit in the container.\n\nTook 5 hours to cut a small bag of broccoli. Still, didn't cut it small enough.\n\nDidn't give up the search for the rotisserie oven mitts. Even after two months trying\n\nDidn't close a big bag of shredded cheese, which basically ruined the entire bag. Also, he didn't label whatever meat or cheese he cut properly, so that had to get thrown out too.\n\nWhenever we asked him to speed up his work a little bit, he got defensive. After one of his five hour sessions cutting broccoli got to be too much for our cook in the back, he asked Kevin to speed up a bit. Kevin proceeded to walk into the back and for 15 minutes straight, just kept on asking, \"How do I work faster, huh? How do I work faster, huh?\"\n\nDumped Chicken Grease down the sink on two occasions. This is pretty much when everybody gave up hope on the guy. For anybody who doesn't know, chicken Grease turns into a jelly when left out. Imagine what that does when it is left in a pipe.\n\nDespite all of these incidents, he claimed to have been a professional, working delis for over 10 years. He also claimed he had NOTHING wrong with him in the head.\n\nTowards the end of his time with us, came the hot case incident. Kevin was dishing out food to some customers from the hot case, but rather than grab metal silverware from the drawer next to it, he grabbed a plastic spoon from the back that we would normally use in the cold case. Our cook asked him a rhetorical question, \"what happens when you put plastic in the hot case?\". Kevin, in a moment of Kevin intelligence, revealed that he didn't know. He spent 30 minutes trying to guess however. Good on you Kevin. Show them that intelligence.\n\nThe next day, I wasn't working, but I wish to GOD that I was. Kevin revealed that he had done research into what happens when you put plastic in the hot case. Somehow, his research brought him to one conclusion: plastic, when left in a hot case for too long, turns to metal. This wasn't just a throwaway comment. He kept this going. He and our cook went back and forth in this conversation, which quickly led to an argument, and eventually the two had to be separated because everybody else working the deli that day was almost certain that the two were going to throw hands. We still can't figure out what led him to think that heating plastic would turn it to metal, but at this point, this part of the story gives us so many laughs, that we just don't care.\n\nAround the end of the summer, I was just about to start college. I was one week away when I went in for another Kevin shift. Only this time, I found out that he had been no-call\/no-show for three days straight. As a result, management considered it quitting and pulled his name off the schedule.\n\nThat last week, working shifts without him, we got more done than if he had been working. In the end, Kevin faded away to a simple bad memory. \n\nDespite this, we all still laugh whenever somebody asks the question, \"what happens when you put plastic in the hot case?\". And wherever Kevin went next, I hope he's gotten a better handle on things and I thank him for giving me this story.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1666102344.0},{"title":"Kevin and The Art of Idiot Maintenance: My Brother is The King of Kevins","author":"Ssareuonaga","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/xzvtld\/kevin_and_the_art_of_idiot_maintenance_my_brother\/","text":"My brother (22M) is the kind of Kevin who is a bit different than most. Most of the people on this subreddit are just random and do dumb things. Kevin, my brother, to his credit- does show some kind of intelligence. But he uses it on doing the most spectacularly dangerous and illogical things ever. The guy has \\*great\\* problem-solving skills, which is why he's still alive. Because god knows, this motherfucker gives himself lots of problems to solve.\n\nI'm (24M) not going to bore you with context- we'll get to that on the way. Let's just open with a moment that I think really shows the spirit of this guy. So, during my senior year of high school, Kevin was a sophomore. I did not go to homecoming senior year, because I had zero interest and nobody i'd want to go with anyway. I was a pretty lonely, introverted teenager. Kevin went with his clown friends. Kevin decided to steal my driver's license from my wallet before the dance, got super drunk afterward, and threw a guy down the stairs, who broke his ankle. The guy called the cops, and when they showed up, detained Kevin- but he claimed to be me.\n\nSo I'm in my room playing CS:GO at midnight when my mom gets a call from the sheriff (this is a small midwest US town). He tells her that he has me in custody. She's shocked and bursts into my room to find me Rushing B site like usual and her jaw drops. My mom puts the phone on speaker and this conversation unfolds:\n\n**Mom:** What do you mean you have OP in custody, he's right here, he's at the house playing video games!\n\n**Sheriff:** Nope, ma'am, I've got him down at the station, he punched a guy while drunk!\n\n**Mom:** The hell you do, he's right here, want to talk to him?\n\n**Sheriff:** Oh wait- you're the OPname family! I forgot about you! Yeah, it's Kevin. I understand now, he's got OP's ID on him!\n\nKeep in mind I am completely unaware that Kevin has taken my ID, so I'm shocked and get up and run to my wallet to find my drivers license gone. Kevin ends up getting precisely zero consequences and my mom pays a $100 fine for him. That is, even with the fact that he stole my ID, which proves that he knew he was going to do something illegal that night, he probably figured they'd slap me with the underage drinking charge. Cop is a bit of a Kevin too, he could've taken a look at the ID photo and realized it wasn't me...\n\n\\---\n\nAlright- next incident. In his junior year of High School, Kevin went to work at the local fried chicken restaurant. \\[Insert breaking bad joke here\\]. Now, I had just left for college two weeks earlier, but I get a FRANTIC call in the middle of the night from my mom. She lets me know Kevin is in the hospital, and obviously I'm worried for him. So, what actually happened, I find out an hour later, is that he stayed out all night, sent his mom a photo of a burnt hand-shaped piece of chicken, and claimed his hand got fried and he was in the hospital. She believed it. He came home that night at 3am with a wrapped-up, bandaged hand- reeking of weed. She had him unbandage his hand and it was fine. It makes as much sense to me as it does to you.\n\n\\---\n\nKevin did not get into college. He had a GPA of 2.1 at graduation. He was 67th of 68 in his High School class. Only the guy who failed because he never went to school was lower. About a month after graduation, he decided to buy a plane ticket to Boston. He stood outside Harvard (the campus itself), sent an email to his high school principal with a photo saying, \"Looks like YOU are the stupid one, I got into harvard!\"\n\n\\---\n\nWhat a guy.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1665348278.0},{"title":"Happy National Kevin Day!","author":"drfsrich","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/xulmua\/happy_national_kevin_day\/","text":"[https:\/\/nationaltoday.com\/national-kevin-day\/](https:\/\/nationaltoday.com\/national-kevin-day\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCelebrate all the Kevins in your life!","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1664808827.0},{"title":"I work with a cheap Kevina pt.2","author":"OverlyAdorable","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/xrk8t0\/i_work_with_a_cheap_kevina_pt2\/","text":"A couple months back, I posted about the Kevina at work https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/venv7r\/i_work_with_a_cheap_kevina\/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share and I thought I'd add more. \n\nLate last year, she got signed off sick and didn't come back until January. In July, she tried again to be signed off for the school holidays but the doctor would only give her a week at a time. Eventually, the doctor refused to give her another week off. I don't know the full details but Kevina says her doctor hates her and wants to have a break from seeing and hearing from her so often. This caused her to moan for days until a customer somewhat politely asked her to stop and get on with things like everyone else does. She spent the next hour in the ladies because she was upset. After coming out, she spent 5 minutes on the till before saying she needed to go take her medication. She spent 20 minutes taking them and then asked for her break. She still forgets to take her antibiotics and the infection keeps coming back.\n\nLast time, I mentioned I had had a week off and she forgot me. The same thing happened with someone else recently. I would put this up to a poor memory but she recently messaged someone that used to work with us to say how much she misses them. \n\nShe's fallen off and crashed her moped a couple more times. I passed her once waiting at a junction. She apparently pulled out and almost hit someone, fell off trying to avoid them, and almost got hit by a car going the other way. I didn't see this happen but she said she was sure it was me who'd almost run her over. They were going away from work and driving a car I've never had. \n\nNot sure how it is everywhere else but where I live, you need to take a test every two years to ride a moped\/ motorbike and you're limited to 125cc. These tests are so easy to pass, they're pretty much just jump on, ride down the road, turn around, and go back and last about an hour or two. Until I met Kevina, the only person I'd heard of who'd failed had crashed and fled the scene, taking himself off home. Kevina says she tries to get away with not doing it but gets in trouble each time and then fails it two or three times every time.\n\nHer sister recently drove her in to do some shopping. She was wearing her bike gear without her helmet (waterproof hi viz jacket and trousers). The next day she was working, she asked if she could wear it over her uniform because she felt less threatened. Of course the answer was no. \n\nAn old lady said she came a while back and was too scared to leave her car because Kevina was in the car park and was very angry. She was throwing a basket around and stamping on it. Why was Kevina doing this to a poor defenceless basket? It was put on her moped\n\nWe used to have this board in the break room that was meant to be to put people on when they went above and beyond. It's the sort of thing you'd expect to see in a primary school \"Well done Jimmy for not pushing Amy during break.\" She forgot she was allergic to bees until she got stung by one again. She wrote on that board to thank people for helping her when she got stung. She wrote stink from be instead of stung by a bee.\n\nMy mum and younger sister went on holiday abroad a few weeks back. I didn't go, nor did the rest of the family, just the two of them. She asked whether I enjoyed my holiday, despite us both being at work together multiple days when they were on holiday. I told her I didn't go but she didn't believe me and demanded to know what I brought in from that holiday and why I wasn't tanned. \n\nI mentioned last time how she only took \u00a320 worth of euros (around 23\u20ac) for both her and her mum for a two week holiday. I found out through Facebook that she borrowed 20\u20ac from her sister to buy a 40\u20ac unicorn statue. She was later talking about it at work. She said she tried taking interest off of what she borrowed but her sister wasn't having it. Someone asked why her sister was charging her interest and she said normally people borrow money and they have money taken off those loans so she thought she'd do the same and take 20% off of what she owed but her sister wanted her to pay the full amount. She genuinely thought the person borrowing the money had money taken off the amount they had to pay back over time and they call it interest because it gets people interested in taking out loans","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1664488710.0},{"title":"A former coworker was \u201cspecial\u201d","author":"LawnGnomeFlamingo","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/xpmn2t\/a_former_coworker_was_special\/","text":"My job is to make deliveries to hospitals. Our company provides vehicles to allow for these deliveries and provides gas cards. I work the graveyard shift and Kevina clocked in at 7:30 am. We often used the same company car. Our products need to be dropped in a secure and locked room for security reasons. To enable this, we use a combination of our IDs as authorised contractors, key cards, door codes, and keys, as well as the occasional security guard escort. Our deliveries are fairly predictable and consistent. In addition to our contractor ID we have a fob to scan in the cars we drive so our company can track certain safety and efficiency metrics. If we don\u2019t scan our fob, we have to make our deliveries with the GPS beeping the whole ride.\n\nNo matter how many times Kevina was trained on her routes, I\u2019m convinced she asked for directions in every hospital she delivered to, every day. Weeks into delivering to a certain site she was training a newer employee. In spite of having made at least a dozen deliveries here before, she still had to make a phone call to get the code to open the door. To add to my theory that she wandered the halls for help instead of remembering where to go, here\u2019s an example. One morning she was making a delivery, NBD. Instead of going directly to and from the appropriate room, she got so lost she stumbled upon a woman in the middle of changing clothes. The startled woman was a nurse and was changing in a room with the door CLOSED. Kevina actively didn\u2019t know where she was going in spite of having delivered to this particular location several times before.\n\nAgain, for security reasons, we had to deliver to a secure and locked room. Due to her inattentiveness she didn\u2019t have the appropriate key card to a particular room. In theory she should have made sure she had the key card before she even left to make the delivery. Once she got to the hospital and realized she couldn\u2019t access the appropriate room on her own, I nstead of seeking out security or calling work for help or advice, she left the delivery behind a trash can.\n\nA few things about sharing a company car with her: where we\u2019re located, it\u2019s snowy and icy for months. She refused to fill up the gas tank because \u201cit\u2019s cold\u201d. Girl, you\u2019re driving when the sun\u2019s up. It\u2019s colder at 4 am during my regular route. One day she took the gas card home with her and I didn\u2019t have enough gas to finish my route. I still don\u2019t know why she took the gas card home with her when she didn\u2019t even use it? I ended up having to spend my own money to get back to work. I was reimbursed later. I was furious. \n\nOne day she left a note with the car keys- \u201cdon\u2019t use! Oil problems!\u201d Since we didn\u2019t have extra cars I had no choice but to use the car anyway, stuff is time sensitive and had to be delivered. I loaded up and started the car. The problem? A pop up alert saying \u201coil change required\u201d. \n\nApparently Kevina lost her car key fob a few weeks before her last day. Instead of telling our manager so she could get it replaced, Kevina decided the car beeping during her entire route (sometimes a trip could last 3+ hours) was preferable to being scolded and having to cope with a day or two of embarrassment.\n\nHer memory was horrible. I was taking a week\u2019s vacation. The Friday before my week off I trained her on my route since she would be covering for me. One stop in particular she spent a good 10-15 minutes asking questions about that particular location. All the while I was explaining how I chose my parking spot (some spots are reserved for on call physicians), when and where to use the key card, how to contact security so she could enter the building, etc. The following Monday, only 48 hours later, she didn\u2019t remember a damned thing about this particular stop. She was on the phone with our manager for a good 20 minutes trying to figure out what to do.\n\nI know I\u2019m petty, but my final comment about Kevina is suuuuuuper petty. She asked me *twice* if I missed Omaha. I reminded her both times I\u2019ve never been to Nebraska without adding that I\u2019m from Oklahoma.\n\nEdits:\nShe was constantly late and was told to call so we\u2019d know she was still coming in. Instead of calling work directly, or even the supervisor, she\u2019s call one of the other drivers. \n\nDuring her interview and hiring process, she was told repeatedly that she would have to work the graveyard shift for two non-consecutive weeks every year to cover time off for me and the other person who clocked in a midnight. Our supervisor wanted to  be absolutely sure Kevina was aware of this and was ok with it. Kevina got it in her head that it was 2 NIGHTS a year and was unhappy when she had to fulfill this requirement. It was a contributing factor in her decision to quit.\n\nSince she started after covid, we had to take our temperature every shift. Out thermometer had a battery that would run out quickly because of how frequently it was used. She often wrote down her temperature as \u201clow\u201d, not realizing that the battery needed changing.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1664298825.0},{"title":"Kevin doesn't know how heat and pressure works","author":"TechnoVicking","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/xmgdmn\/kevin_doesnt_know_how_heat_and_pressure_works\/","text":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/mildlyinfuriating\/comments\/xm512n\/bad_product_design_i_boiled_raw_milk_and_cant\/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1663985975.0},{"title":"Two Kevins Miss an Obvious Problem","author":"catcul","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/xkfory\/two_kevins_miss_an_obvious_problem\/","text":"This story takes place when businesses were changing from Windows XP to Windows 7.

Our team was needed to help run tickets at a hospital because someone tried to force Windows 7 through the network, causing severe bottlenecks throughout the entire hospital complex.\n\nI was helping with a service ticket where a nurses' computer was having issues with a printer driver in XP.  Of course, I upgraded their computer to Windows 7 to resolve the issue.  Keep in mind that that 6 nurses use this during their various shifts.\n\nCast of characters:\n\nMe: Field technician\n\nDana:  Day nurse\n\nNancy: Night nurse\n\nRick:  Help desk technician\n\nKevin:  Field technician and co-worker\n\nAfter I finished upgrading and setting up this computer for Dana, I closed the ticket as successful.\n\nA couple of day later, Nancy started her shift and had trouble logging into this workstation.  She called the help desk and Rick answered.  Nancy reported that she was locked out, but Ricked looked up her user ID and found that her ID was not locked out.\n\nWhat did Rick do?  Did he:\n\na.) realize that Nancy was trying to log in with the wrong ID?\n\nb.) determine that the installing tech (me) screwed up the computer?\n\nRick chose b.  He decided that the computer needed to be fixed by a field technician.\n\nCue Kevin.  Kevin looked at the ticket and the computer, and he decided that I screwed up the computer somehow.  He decided to delete the computer's account from Active Directory.  In doing that, he really did screw up the computer by making sure that nobody could log into the hospital's network using that workstation.  He didn't know how to get the workstation to rejoin the network.  What did Kevin do?  Did he:\n\na.) Call help desk for help?\n\nb.) Call a fellow field technician for help?\n\nc.) Go down to the basement and retrieve a new computer with Windows 7 and set that computer up?\n\nd.) Do none of the above and abandoned the ticket?\n\nThat's right, Kevin did d.  When I read the ticket, I went to visit an irritated Dana.  I found out what was going on with the computer.  I got the workstation to rejoin the network and made sure the nurses' accounts were set up and their data was intact.\n\nTwo weeks later, while I was working on another computer, Dana passed by and greeted me.

When he finally showed up instead of getting on with the degree, he joined a mob of political outsiders who were fleetingly successful in taking over the heavily stitched up student union before getting run out of town, all tar and feathered and riding a rail. Somewhere he missed the memo that his side had been run into the sea, routed, couped, lined up against a wall and shot, and would still go daily into the student union and demand ... a free cup of coffee. Thick skinned and self serving, he simply couldn't take the hint he was more likely to be sealed in a 44 gallon drum and dumped in the harbour than given free drinks. Going in the enemy's bunker and demanding condiments. \n\nHe decided to play this loosing streak into a real life job and started fancying himself an organiser for a new third way style political party. He held weekly meetings where I would show up at out of pity. So, both me AND Kevin. He finally told me what these alleged meetings were for, name droping his mate \"the union organiser\" as a potential guest speaker. I knew full well his mate wasn't into this whole third way party himself, so I was pretty shocked what farce I'd been wasting my lunch hours for. Strike one.\n\nThen he asked me and another graduate to come with him to \"hand out\" leaflets. Instead we went into a lecture theatre where he proceeded to switch on the PA and address\/harang the students in an attempted hijack, until the lecturer glared him down and he left. Strike two.\n\nStrike three was when he got me to go to an actual political rally for the third way party. Talking to him outside the venue, I knew he wasn't interested in the politics but cynically saw this as a career move. I recognised a stranger in the crowd; I'd seen him at the university and noted Kevin's other mate had been talking to him in the street, so potentially a new friend for Kevin. I discreetly mentioned this to Kevin, Kevin's reaction was indiscreet. Like, REALLY indiscreet. \n\nHow indiscreet, you ask ... he leaned across the gap in the crowd and proceeded to start jabbing the stranger in the face with an accusatory finger -- \"That guy? THAT GUY? He doesn't go to our university, he goes to [rival] university! And he's in the COMMUNIST PARTY YOUTH WING!!!\" That kind of indiscreet.\n\nAt the centre of a crowd of maybe one hundred, still face to face with this startled and bewildered stranger. Kevin then lifts his beer to his lips, holds it up for a second in the \"cheers\" motion before having a swig, like that explained all. Then he spotted a girl he recognised and blurted, \"Oh, uh, uh, HI!\" before proceeding to leave this tableau and begin following her. This left myself and the stranger still face to face with this massive turd of getting poked in the face and screamed at by way of introduction. I briefly considered trying to explain it to him, but elected to sadly leave and resolve to NEVER help Kevin out with his flights of fancy ever again. \n\nNo, Kevin did not succeed in the party.

He was taught how to properly do the work and IF by some miracle they got him to work, someone had to fix everything he made. With this I heard for the first time that my uncle had a saying that 'Putty covers up what the eye fucks up', poorly translated as english isn't my first language. Putty didn't fix up this Kevins mistakes though, my brother worked back then in metal industry. Mostly though they had hard time to even get him to work. He had self made medical reasons to avoid everything. \n\n'You know my bad knee, I can't kneel down to make that.' or 'You know my bad shoulder, I can't lift this.'\n\nSo when listed what he can't do by these reasons, he would have been able to stand accompanying the real workers and smoke with them on breaks. After the two weeks my brother 'didn't need him anymore.'\n\nHe asked my second brother to teach him to fix cars. Ended up with my brother fixing the cars and him drinkin beer by the car. He would try fixing his car by himself and my brother had to fix his fixes to even find the actual problem.\n\nLatest I know he got a job right next door to his home in a constraction company. Got fired the first day after going home midday to call his doctor his muscles hurt and he needs sick leave. He never told anyone he left. 'Disappeared after starting' probably hurts his resume, but he still don't know what he did wrong.\n\nI've really tried my best to have a conversation with him, but no matter the topic he can barely voice an opinion as he knows nothing. I've tried to ask even about his hobbies, no luck. Seems like his vocabulary is dependant of booze and even then has mostly 'yeah' 'aaahh?' 'I guess' and different kind of 'mmhhmm's.

I\u2019m not gonna do a lot of backstory in this one. I\u2019ve known this person a very long time and I have endless stories. This is just the latest. I\u2019m going with Kevin, and using the they pronoun. Just to make my life easy. \n\nKevin informed me today that they don\u2019t need to pay taxes. I probed further, needing to know the reasons they\u2019re about to put themselves in a lot of risk. They make six figures, they are not getting out of paying taxes. There will be serious consequences. Yes folks, even Kevin\u2019s can make an incredible salary. This is why I can\u2019t sleep at night. \n\n\nWhat I found out from Kevin shook me, I can barely process the stupid. It was declared as fact that it\u2019s not illegal to not pay taxes. This reminds me of the IT sub Reddit where the users think their monitors are the computers. It\u2019s that moronic of a conversation. I now put forth the reasonings of a Kevin, one who is diving deeper and deeper into conspiracy theories, to my horror. Here are Kevin\u2019s thoughts on taxes. \n\n\nKevin informs me that \u201cThere's a bunch of asshole\nsolicitors sending me mail like\nevery day trying to get me to pay\ntaxes and shit. Thev're mad I didn't pay taxes I guess. They can get over it tbh.\u201d So I of course tell them they have to pay taxes, it\u2019s not optional in the US. \n\n\nKevin wants to know why they should pay the government and I explain. Kevin then tells me this whole thing sounds unconstitutional. Kevin thinks that if the IRS garnishes their wages Kevin can sue them because \u201cThat\u2019s illegal.\u201d\n\n\nAfter a long sigh and a few forehead smacks, I tell them to just hire someone to do it for them. They can afford it and it\u2019s one less thing to stress over. Plus I have little faith Kevin can correctly do their taxes at all. \n\n\nKevin explains further that \u201cyou don't have to pay taxes. You just have to deal with them getting huffy and stealing your money, it sounds like. If I hire anyone, it'Il be to get them to cease and desist this shit. \nFuck Britain\nThe queen is dead\ntell her to stop stealing my shit.\u201d \nI kid you not. I don\u2019t know how the queen got dragged into this, but I guess it\u2019s a trending topic anyway atm. \n\n\nWhen I tell Kevin there\u2019s no way around this, their genius solution is to quit their very well paying job and be homeless. Very practical indeed.\n\n\nKevin then explains they\u2019re worried that the people mailing them are not the IRS, so I tell them what an IRS mailing looks like. After that I get this gem, \u201cI don't think the IRS would mail anyone. They're bankrupt now.\u201d The what now?! They are also still unconvinced that it is illegal to not pay your taxes. Kevin logic is magical. \n\n\nI try my best to pull data proving that taxes are mandatory and being ignorant of this will not make it go away. Kevin is unmoved even after I explain that the IRS can and will get their money. \n\n\nPeople, Kevin somehow has a 6 figure job. No way the irs will overlook this. I cite the laws, I cite the cases where it\u2019s gone to court and been unsuccessful over and over again. It\u2019s a moot point, obviously a fools errand. If a grown adult doesn\u2019t even know that not paying taxes is illegal, how are they going to understand tax codes and constitutional law? But you know Kevin\u2019s, Kevin knows the laws and they\u2019re in the right. According to Kevin there are no such laws and anything that\u2019s been provided that says otherwise is a \u201cmisinterpretation.\u201d \n\n\nI\u2019d like to tell you dear reader that I got through to them, but we all know there is no getting through to a very determined Kevin. Kevin has decided to ask a lawyer to help and if they have to pay, then \u201cI'm signing it V.C.\u201d Kevin seems to think that this is somehow sticking it to the man. Even after pointing out all the penalties that they are receiving each month they don\u2019t pay taxes, on top of lawyer fees if they go that route, this is only hurting them. That went over like a lead balloon. I have failed.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1663041019.0},{"title":"Kevin in the Lab","author":"azrael4h","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/xd2jum\/kevin_in_the_lab\/","text":"This is about a former co worker who has become legend in my field because of his antics. Mostly short little blurbs of shit he's pulled.\n\nFirst off, I work in an asphalt lab, designing and testing road mixes. We have the same job. There is also a road tech component. Which he also did.\n\nSo, Kevin:\n\nForgot some equipment used to cut core samples from paved roads. Repeatedly. \n\nWrecked the lab truck, three times.\n\nGot the truck and the trailer stuck in mud repeatedly, several times delaying jobs because it was in the way. \n\nSet the lab on fire. He set a bowl of highly flammable solvent on the stove, it went up, and the only reason it was put out, and he escaped the building, was because the plant foreman literally drug him out the door, then went back in and put it out. \n\nReached inside a 1000+ degree oven bare handed. How I don't know, but he did it. \n\nThe bad thing is even all of that wasn't enough to get him fired. Him cursing out one of his neighbors, and getting filmed going on a long, racist, and insane rant about running said neighbor over, with the lab truck in view and the company logo proudly seen in the video? Finally got his ass fired. \n\nThe more hilarious thing was that he was using his company phone to get hook ups. So when he had to relinquish his phone, he neglected to tell some of those hook ups his new number. Cue my other co worker, who is homophobic as fuck and slightly psychotic getting dick picks at 2am. We're still making fun of him. I put up a gallery of pictures called <coworker's> favorite artists, including Elton John, George Micheal, and the Vanilla Midget Kevin Nash. \n\nSomehow Kevin managed to get a job at one of the contractors who do the same lab work, just for the state. His response to that is to threaten to fail any tests he was a part of unless the lone woman who worked with us (escaped now) slept with him.  She didn't, and he wasn't allowed to work on one of our jobs until this year, where we found out he doesn't know how to do anything he supposedly did while he was with us. We had to hand hold his ass through each step of the testing process, each and every day.

Some Kevins just do random shit- think that guy here who fucked vinegar or the glass eater, that kind of thing. Kevin's a whole different breed. He got 100% creativity stats at birth but god spent all the intelligence points on that and none on safety or analytical thinking. \n\nI think a good story to attune you to the Kevin frequency will be this one: the time he set the shed on fire. It was pouring rain one afternoon and Kevin decided it would be a good day to barbecue because it'll be safer to do when it's raining to prevent fires. Lmao. Except, Kevin did it \\*inside the shed\\*. He managed to set the shed on fire and barely escape alive, with a very toasted right foot and $4000 in hospital bills by the time it was done. \n\nAnother moment of spectacular stupidity was him applying to over \\*four hundred\\* scholarship opportunities as a high school freshman instead of a college freshman, because he thinks universities are \"high schools, they're higher than the last place I went!\" How the hell he even got into college I have no idea. He got a 740 on the SAT (REALLY bad) and a 2.52 GPA in high school. He fucked another man in the school bathroom (he is Bi, not a problem to me that it was another man, but this did not please the school district in the state we live in) and spent two weeks of senior year suspended. \n\nKevin was also a complete dipshit to me personally when I was starting college though we've more or less buried the hatchet. Unlike him, I went out of state for college because I have half a brain and don't want to live in a shithole (unspecific for anonymity reasons but I go to school in California and my family+Kevin live in the Midwest USA). Not a week after I leave for college do I get a text from Kevin demanding I call him immediately for a family emergency.\n\nI do that only to hear him tell me about a rumor he heard that David Ortiz (famous retired baseball player) likes putting baseball bats up his own ass. I think maybe Kevin was just projecting. Kevin said he needed to call me because I \\*used to be there to talk to him\\* and proceeds to give me an insulting spiel about how I'm a stupid liberal for moving away from the family. Ironically, my parents encouraged me to do it, it's not like anyone but Kevin disagreed with my decision. \n\nOh yeah, back in Freshman year of HS (actual, not kevin definition), he googled \"How does an IED work\" on a school computer. He claimed later he meant to search IUD so he could know whether he could make his girlfriend get one. Not only dumb but I see why he became a republican...\n\nKevin once went to lift weights and came back home 3 hours later with a gruesome bruise on his cheek and blood around his mouth. I ask him what happened and he says a random \"nutbag\" (word he uses, I have never heard this one before...) attacked him on the street but he fought back and beat him away. I ask why he didn't go to the cops, etc., the more I ask him about it the more inconsistencies pop up in his story. When confronted, he admits he dropped a 35-pound dumbbell on his face. He got pissed off and yelled back at me while walking away that \"you couldn't even lift that much, all you do is sit on your ass alone.\" I decided to engage him which resulted in my dad having to keep me from punching him. \n\nAnother time, and this was back when he was 14, still hs freshman, Kevin tried to run alongside the school bus shirtless in the morning  because \"buses move real slow and the girls will see my gains\". He could obviously not keep up with the pace of a moving school bus. \n\nHe also bought a bag of frozen fish at the store and tried eating frozen cod filets before we explained to him that it didn't work like that, and frozen fish isn't a snack food.\n\nBut the story that really takes the cake is the time he tried to do geoengineering on our neighborhood. Kevin went outside early one evening and nobody noticed until about midnight that he wasn't back. I step outside and see he's dug a trench, maybe two feet deep, all the way from my mom's garden to the creek in back of our house. He's squatting at the bank of the creek, yelling at the water, \"just fucking flow upward! It's not that fucking hard!\". \n\nThat's kevin for you.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1663029619.0},{"title":"Kevin Parks There","author":"catcul","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/xcga16\/kevin_parks_there\/","text":"One time, our project manager invites our team to have lunch at a popular restaurant with a tiny parking lot.

One of them was my friend from high school, the rest were strangers. And one of these strangers seemed to lack any sort of common sense or knowledge about society - especially related to food. He said he was from Arizona. I thought he was from another planet. Meet Kevin, my roommate.\n\nBecause I am a generally friendly person, I started to build a relationship with him, as I did with all my roommates. He clung to me and didn't really interact with anyone else while he was there. He trusted me as if I was some sage of wisdom, knowing all and dispensing timeless advice. Such thought-provoking questions such as: \"Is tuna fish good for you?\" I told him that yes, tuna fish is good for you. For the next 2 weeks or so, he ate nothing but tuna fish sandwiches. One of the other roommates made him stop because he was sick of the smell of tuna everywhere.\n\nThen there was the time when Kevin generously gifted me a loaf of bread. Being a starving college student, I gobbled up a couple of slices of it and was on the toilet 10 minutes later. Turns out, the bread had green mold covering the bottom couple slices. I neglected to confront him about it, choosing to believe that he simply didn't notice the mold - after all, I didn't either.\n\nAround this time, one of my other roommates started bad-mouthing Kevin in a language me and him spoke, but that Kevin did not. I don't agree with the ethics of insulting somebody in a language they don't understand (while they're still in the same room), but I couldn't help but agree that this kid was his own brand of nuts.\n\nThe highlight comes a bit later in the semester. Kevin hasn't been feeling well. Not that he's complaining or whining, or anything. He looks and acts completely normal. But whenever anybody asks how he's doing, like a casual greeting sort of question, he would go \"Oh I'm okay. I've been throwing up the past couple of days.\" Well, one day his roommate happened to be in the bathroom while he was throwing up. Turns out he neglected to mention that he had been throwing up BLOOD for the past several days. Yeah, time to go to the hospital, Kevin.\n\nWhen he gets back from the hospital, he must once again embark upon a journey to the chambers of the sage (my bunk) to seek yet another pearl of ancient wisdom in response to the profound philosophical question: \"Do doctors lie?\" His doctor told him he had a stomach ulcer and would need to go on an extreme diet for the next couple weeks. Basically the only things he could consume were veggies, bread, and rice. Kevin did not want to accept the reality of his condition, nor the medical advice from a trained professional. I assured him, with the pure Zen of the Tao: no, doctors do not lie.\n\nKevin, if you're out there, I hope you learned enough about planet Earth to finally integrate into society.

I met Kevin at the end of my first day and that was the end of peace as I knew it. Here's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThough I didn\u2019t know this until much later, Kevin had never hiked a day in his life yet he had decided to take on this journey of over 500 miles (and despite being non-religious, though we had that in common). There was an extreme heatwave the week we started (which was a bad idea for us both, to be fair) and the second day of walking was over a huge mountain, with no shade and with just two opportunities to get more water (one to buy water at a food truck, one fountain). That was our first day walking together and Kevin brought just about 1 liter of water, no food, and ran out before the food truck, and then again well before the fountain.\n\nThere were plenty of other signs that he was unprepared - his backpack was hanging extremely loose and crooked, he was carrying books and other unnecessary items so he was always complaining about his shoulders hurting (which should never be the case with a well fitted backpack). His shoes didn\u2019t fit well (and were heavy boots instead of lightweight trail runners as most recommend for this journey) and he kept stumbling and actually did fall and scrape up his leg within the first 30 minutes of our 2nd day walking together. On that 2nd day, a few of us helped him fit his backpack correctly but he thought it looked stupid and always wanted it loose.\n\nKevin also had a bit of an anger issue. Not towards others, that was never an issue, but towards minor inconveniences or otherwise expected annoyances. For example, each time he stumbled over his shoes he would curse loudly and forcefully at himself and his shoes, \"awggh fuck!\" Another is when sometimes on the trail you\u2019d come into sections with very annoying gnats that would fly right into your face and hover there and you'd have to keep blowing them away or swatting at them. More than once I\u2019d be behind him and see him swatting at the gnats, swearing loudly and repeatedly at them, \u201cfuck off, fuck off!! Fuck off!\u201d \n\nHe also hated \u201cpush showers\u201d. At some of the hostels, the showers would be the kind of taps that you\u2019d push in, the water would flow but after 15-20 seconds the water would stop and you\u2019d need to push again for more water. No big deal, annoying for sure but it conserves water and isn\u2019t the end of the world. Kevin, however, would be in the next stall and each time his water stopped, I\u2019d hear, \u201caghhhhhh for fucks sake!!\u201d When we\u2019d be booking hostels, he\u2019d say \u201cas long as they don\u2019t have those push showers\u201d but it\u2019s not like you would ask about that before you checked in (he let others make his reservations as he wasn\u2019t comfortable in the local language) and they were unavoidable.\n\nAt some point I learned that Kevin has a fear of heights. Very normal, ok. But he went on to clarify that it\u2019s not just looking down, but that high ceilings and looking up inside places with high ceilings gave him the same sensation and fear. He asked me if I thought the cathedral (the one the whole pilgrimage is based on getting to) would have high ceilings. All I could say was yes, I\u2019m pretty sure it does. Also keep in mind that every town or city we passed through had a historic church or cathedral often worth seeing, and Kevin could barely step inside them. I ended up finding him a bucket hat in a free pile and the large rim made it possible for him to go inside and never have to see the ceiling so I guess I'm a saint.\n\nHe never quite seemed to know what was going on or what the plan was. Each day we'd walk 20-30km depending on where the next town we wanted to stop at was (most pilgrims would stop in the same places). More than a few times we\u2019d already be a few hours into the day (or nearing the end) and get a message from Kevin in the group chat asking which town we were stopping at for the day. Blew my mind that he was walking for hours on end without any idea where he was walking to or when he'd get to stop. He'd be sitting with us each evening as we talked about the plan, looked through hostel options, usually made phone reservations and included him in them but he didn't internalize any of the information and would ask us about it the next day.\n\nHe got lost a fair amount as well. In one town, our friends were messaging us all that they had found an area to swim by the river and sent us a photo of a map their hostel had given them with it circled. Kevin was M.I.A. while two of us decided to meet our other friends there, interpreted the map and went to the river for a bit. After not long there (water was freezing), we went grocery shopping, headed back to our hostel, prepared dinner and were eating together (so A LOT of time had passed and we hadn't heard from Kevin) when we get a photo message from Kevin of the highway a long ways away asking if he was heading the correct direction to the river. I had to let him know that he was not only not going the right direction at all, that we were all eating and that he should stop by the grocery store if he wanted to have something to cook and eat too.* He turned up at the hostel empty handed and some of us tried to share what we had before he finally decided to go to the grocery store on his own.\n\nHe would listen to music in his headphones on the trail, which is totally fine IMO. But there were also bikers and cars that we would have to avoid and he would never hear them coming up behind him or any of us yelling \u201ccar!\u201d He was actually a pretty fast walker so he'd often be in front and miss trail markings, so we'd have to scream him name to get him to look back and realize. \n\nSomewhere along the way Kevin's shower loofah fell apart and he didn't have one. He kept asking our group if anyone had a sponge or loofah he could borrow. We didn't. After a few days of him asking (days during which we passed through towns where he could have easily bought a new one) he finally asked, \"why don't any of you have a sponge??\" I answered that it wasn't exactly something you'd consider sharable and everyone agreed. He just didn't think there was anything odd about it. I said, \"I don't want your dead skin cells mixing with my dead skin cells!\" and he said, \"it's not the dead skin cells, it's my acne\" and told us he and his friend back home had shared loofahs in the past. I made sure he found himself a new sponge in the next town.\n\nAnyway sorry this got so long but that's just the start...I could get into how he almost bought a puppy planning to bring it with him for hundreds more kilometers, the jar of cooked lentils he carried for days without refrigeration, his affinity for underage-looking boys, all the things he managed to lose, and how sorely and vocally unimpressed he was with the destination city we were all bubbling with excitement to reach.\n\n*Disclaimer: some of this reads like our group was purposefully excluding him and that wasn't the case. It was really normal that we wouldn't always walk\/eat\/sleep in the same hostel together or be constantly checking in on each other to include each other in plans. We would usually buy and prepare separate meals as well which is why we didn't have anything to share with Kevin. Though at some other points, I'll admit, I almost wanted to test him to see if he would do things without our help, initiate a plan or ask for information instead of being fed it.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1661917767.0},{"title":"IT Kevin Seems to Be Computer Illiterate","author":"catcul","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/wwrw9z\/it_kevin_seems_to_be_computer_illiterate\/","text":"\"If you make anything fool-proof, nature comes up with a better fool.\" - Anonymous\n\nHere's the cast:\n\nMe: A worker who had experience with server replacement\n\nMike: Project Manager\n\nPaul: Assistant PM\n\nAngel: A teammate with experience\n\nMarshall: A new teammate\n\nKevin: Another new teammate\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBackground:\n\nWe were starting a project installing servers into secured offices in town and across much of our country.

We noticed that Kevin had a habit of constantly showing up 5 minutes late.  Our team traveled to our first remote office, an office that was practically next door to our home office. Mike instructed Kevin to move the mouse pointer to the bottom of the screen and right-click on the Task Bar.  Kevin had to be shown how to do a task that even the most technologically phobic office worker would be able to do easily.\n\nLater that night, Mike instructed  Kevin to select a file name that started with the letter \"S.\"  He had trouble because the Windows File Explorer window only had file names that started with the letter \"N.\"  He literally had to be shown how to scroll down and find \"S.\"  He failed a task most of us learn by the time we turn 6.\n\nThe next week, Mike wanted to see how Marshall and Kevin would do on their own, so he paired Marshall with me and Kevin with Angel.  Marshall was able to follow the instructions needed to do his job so easily that Paul decided he didn't need my help.  Kevin was a different story.  Angel was ready to tear her hair out trying to help Kevin with his servers.  One time, Angel had to take a phone call and step outside to take it.  Instead of following the directions, he followed Angel outside because he didn't know what to do next, despite having the directions printed.  These are the same directions Marshall was easily able to follow, and were written so even the biggest fool could easily follow.  However, Kevin proved to be a better fool.\n\nThat Friday, both Marshall and Kevin were scheduled to show up to the offices they installed servers  for the preceding Thursday.  Kevin didn't know what office he was supposed to report to despite being at that office the previous night.  He called Angel, but she didn't answer because she doesn't answer her phone at 6 am.  Then, he called Marshall.  Marshall couldn't help Kevin because Marshall was assigned to a different office and Marshall was driving.  Then Kevin called me asking where he was supposed to go.  I had arrived at the home office by this time, so I gave him the correct address.\n\nLater that Friday, Mike announced to Marshall, Angel, and me that Kevin had been fired.  It turned out that Kevin reported to his Wednesday office on Friday instead of his Thursday office.  That's right, dear reader.  Kevin reported to the wrong office in the wrong city.\n\nI am still baffled on how he was able to graduate from a technology college.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: TLDR\n\n1. Kevin was consistently late.\n2. He couldn't follow simple instructions.\n3. We had to hold his hand for his server replacements.\n4. He was fired for showing up in the wrong office in the wrong city.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1661368082.0},{"title":"Kevin the Pizza Artist","author":"Kazbob48","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/ww5l5q\/kevin_the_pizza_artist\/","text":"I used to work for a take and bake pizza chain in high school. Kevin, at age 30, joined our team. We learned that Kevin was the owner's son.\n\nWhat Kevin had done in whatever his previous career was never understood, but we learned quickly why Kevin landed this job at his age.\n\nKevin can't do basic conversions, which was a pretty important part of the job. Stuff like understanding that 8 oz of cheese = half a pound.\n\nKevin can't memorize basic codes for input for product at the register. The codes 3 digits. The first digit is the size (1=small, 2 = medium, 3= large). The second is the number of toppings. The third is always either a 0 if it is a regular pizza, or a 1 if it was some sort of specialty. Example: a large pepperoni pizza would be 310. Every 15 year old at the place can comprehend this. Kevin basically can't run the til.\n\nKevin cannot understand that putting soap in the same sink as sanitizer and dirty dishes does not equal sanitize.\n\nAnyways. Kevin is using the machine which turns the dough balls into rounded shapes. There is a safety feature on this machine where the dough enters. It is only about half an inch wide meant to prevent a finger or hand from going inside and getting crushed.\n\nThe problem with this safety feature is eventually risudual dough builds up. The way to fix this is to turn off the machine, and use a scraping to clear the excess. If it's really bad you can take the cover off and wash it. Kevin knows all of this.\n\nWhile working in the front we hear a scream and clash of falling equipment. Kevin's right hand has gone through the machine all the way up to his elbow. Apparently, he took off the safety mechanism and just kept on pushing dough through which caught his hand \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nThe fire department arrives and saws \/ disassembles the machine to get him into the ambulance. \n\nBest part is he got a promotion after that driving to each of the owners stores, asking how things were going (as if he had any clue what to look for), so maybe Kevin knows what he's doing more than any of us.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1661302970.0},{"title":"My son is a human Kevina\u2026","author":"HaddaHeart","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/wvu9dj\/my_son_is_a_human_kevina\/","text":"Years back I was managing a woman\u2019s clothing store and had a few high schoolers working part time.

He\u2019s a flat earther and believes in a lot of conspiracy theories. \n\nLast week I\u2019m in the office doing some paperwork when when Kevin comes back from lunch telling me a certain celebrity has died and that her funeral is tomorrow. I won\u2019t mention which one but it\u2019s a household name. I\u2019m just going to call the celebrity Wanda. So I take out my phone and go to several major news sites. No mention of Wanda. Had Wanda died every major news outlet would have reported it. \n\nI tell Kevin there is no mention of Wanda dying anywhere. Kevin tells me he has the YouTube video to prove it. Kevin goes to his Watch Later list and starts scrolling down. Most of the videos I\u2019m seeing are flat earth videos. He then scrolls to the video about Wanda dying. It\u2019s the same channel as his flat earth videos. He also shows me another video from the same source that another major celebrity had died as well. I tell Kevin that is not a major news source so I would question its credibility. I try to explain to Kevin that every major news source would have reported Wanda\u2019s death had she died. Kevin goes on a rant saying that\u2019s what they want to to think. Wanda\u2019s family just doesn\u2019t want you to know she died but this place found out. I tell Kevin to go back to work. \n\nFast forward 30 minutes later I hear Kevin ringing up a customer and he\u2019s telling the customer that Wanda died. The customer is trying to hold back laughs and saying \u201care you sure?\u201d Kevin is very persistent. I confront Kevin that he can believe what he wants but no more talk about Wanda dying to customers. \n\nThis is now making me wonder what\u2019s the next crazy thing I\u2019m going to hear out of Kevin\u2019s mouth.\n\nEdit: Wanda currently stars in a very popular TV show. So if Wanda died her co stars would have reported it as well.\n\nEdit 2: I will not be revealing who Wanda is for several reasons. Main is because I don\u2019t want to accidentally add fuel to a rumor that\u2019s barely off the ground. Second, in recent years Wanda has stirred up some controversy. People have asked for her to be fired from the TV show she\u2019s on. She doesn\u2019t need a fake death story adding to it. Third, this is a story about Kevin. Who Wanda is shouldn\u2019t really matter.\n\nEdit 3: Since people are trying to guess who Wanda is I will clear a few things but I\u2019m still not revealing Wanda\u2019s identity. Wanda is not young. Wanda has been in the entertainment industry for several decades. Should Wanda die tomorrow it wouldn\u2019t be a complete shocker vs if someone in their 20s or 30s died. The name Wanda has nothing to do with the actual celebrity. It was the first name that popped into my head as I was writing this. As of right now 8\/23 none of the guesses are right.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1661225152.0},{"title":"Kevin scams himself out of free upgrades in a hotel","author":"Zombiefrom53","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/wqa6am\/kevin_scams_himself_out_of_free_upgrades_in_a\/","text":"English is not my first language, so sry for any errors in this text.\nAlso fair warning this is a long one, written on mobile\n\nA couple of weeks ago I had a reservation coming in an hour before the end of my shift(late shift until 11 pm).\nIt was a guaranteed, non refundable reservation, but his CC didn\u2019t work (not really important, thought I\u2019d mention it for context)\nHe came in 45 minutes later, filled out the paperwork and paid in cash, including city tax(standard procedure if CC doesn\u2019t work).\nHe and his family (wife and young looking child, maybe 6 y o)went to their respective rooms and came back down, saying they didn\u2019t like their rooms, so I gave them free upgrades (hotel was not booked out and since it was pretty late the rooms wouldn\u2019t have been sold anyway).\nSince it was the end of my shift anyways and the Night Shift was in already I showed them the way to their new rooms, because our dressing room \/ Terminal to clock in and out was on the same floor anyways.\nThey took one look at the rooms and said they don\u2019t like the way they looked (old hotel, with baroque looking furniture, like it is seen on every website you can book our hotel through), so they wanted to cancel. We went back to the reception and on the way down I explained what he booked and what that entailed.\nSince his English wasn\u2019t the best and he didn\u2019t speak German I showed him his reservation, after printing out an English version, were it clearly stated that this reservation was guaranteed and if they want to cancel the they need to pay 100% of the room rate (standard procedure for short term reservations in every hotel as far as I know)\nHe didn\u2019t understand (or want to understand) that a non refundable reservation is \u2026 non refundable, so he called a friend of his to translate.\nI said the exact same thing to him and the guest was pretty pissed at this point, demanded his money back.\nSince I was in overtime at this point I thought ok f this and gave him his city tax back.\nHe was not happy with this and called the customer support of the website he booked through, telling them their rooms were filthy and the hotel stank, wanting a full refund.\n5 minutes later we get a call from said booking website, asking if we can refund the reservation, because of all the issues our hotel allegedly had (customer support guy didn\u2019t seem to buy it either, because we had a couple of guests from their website in our hotel and no one else complained). Long Story Short, the answer was still no.\nAfter that didn\u2019t work the guest demanded the bill, saying they will look for another hotel in the city and he will be back tomorrow, most likely to complain about my treatment of him and to get his money back or for us to pay his bill in the other hotel.\nOk, you got it Boss.\nGave him the bill for no show rooms thinking that that was it.\nGuest went outside and I (finally) got to change .\nWhen I came down again the same guest was in the hotel again (or still), wanting to know my name (we got tags on our uniform and he just spend an hour arguing with me).\nSo I told this gentleman my name and wished him a pleasant night and good luck with finding another hotel (that was not malicious, but an honest goodbye and good luck, since almost all hotels in our small city are understaffed due to covid , so there were like 3 options with ns I could think of).\nI went home (an hour late but at least I could relax now) and thought that was the end of it.\n\nSweet karma part, you almost made it\n\n2 hours later ( I was playing Elden ring , because I got a horrible sleep schedule)I got a call from our night shift, the guests are back.\nHis wife and child came to the reception, (maybe he was to embarrassed, don\u2019t know don\u2019t care), asking if they can still have their rooms(the Upgrade once), since the other hotels were booked out.\nWe had a quick laugh (ns in the back office) and I told her to tell the guests that these rooms were already book and they could only have their original rooms, since they were marked as dirty in our system and we couldn\u2019t sell them anymore anyway. They paid the city tax(again) and went to their respective rooms.\nThe next morning they left in quiet a hurry , for some reason and we never heard from them again(until now).\n\nMoral of the story\n\nTake a look at what you are reserving and If you are not sure about the hotel don\u2019t book a non refundable reservation last minute, just drive to the hotel and asking they still have rooms for the night, most staff members will gladly show you some rooms to choose from and you are not on the hook for a non refundable room.\nOr if you stay for only one night just swallow your pride and take the free upgrades.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1660695499.0},{"title":"Kevin Bombs the GUARANTEED Job Interview With a Stupid Answer","author":"Rare-Dragonfruit7673","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/wpeuvp\/kevin_bombs_the_guaranteed_job_interview_with_a\/","text":"Been watching many videos about Kevins and had to share this one. \n\nBack in the mid-90's, my mother decided to date a Kevin.

It was a really neat place. He brought in a bunch of niche tools and gadgets that the big stores and even a lot of the smaller hardware stores didn\u2019t have. One of the things my dad\u2019s friend brought into the store, neodymium (rare earth) magnets. These are the shiny, metallic looking magnets that are incredibly strong for their size. He bought them in all kinds of shapes sizes and strengths. \n\nAt the time of this story (around 2000) my dad and I started working there on Saturdays for extra cash. It paid pretty well for that type of job. \n\nMy boss liked us to show cool stuff off to customers. The magnets were one of those things. They weren\u2019t all that common to see back in those day. They were mainly used for commercial purposes and we\u2019re just coming onto the consumer market. My boss\u2019s favorite way to show off how strong the magnets were was by picking up metal objects with the magnet through his hand (magnet on the back of his hand, metal attracted to the magnet through his palm). I liked asking guys to try pulling the bigger magnets, off the metal door frame in the store and then showing them the trick of getting it off. This was really fun to see the reactions on their faces when the teenage girl got it off when they couldn\u2019t. Other employees also had their own ways of showing the magnets off. \n\nMy dad had his own special trick he liked showing the customers. He liked sticking one of the wrenches we had laying around in the store, sticking it to the magnet and show how strong it was by holding the magnet and shaking it. Until the day that he chose one of the larger adjustable crescent wrenches in the store. This this was MASSIVE. It was probably close to 2ft long and weighed a good 20 or more pounds (~9 kg). He stuck it to a magnet rated for about 500 lbs (~226kg) and shook it. The magnet was strong enough to hold the wrench under gravity, but NOT under the strain of my dad\u2019s shaking. The wrench flies off and hits my dad smack dab on the toenail of his big toe. His toenail turned purple and black and I think he ended up losing it. \n\nThat was the last time he worked at the store without wearing his steel toed boots and he never tried that special trick with the magnets again.","upvote_ratio":0.94,"created_utc":1660605648.0},{"title":"My dad didn\u2019t want to hire professional tree trimmers.","author":"RedheadRae04","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/wmttnk\/my_dad_didnt_want_to_hire_professional_tree\/","text":"My dad is a very smart and intelligent man, but sometimes doesn\u2019t think things through. He thinks he can do it himself and pushes to do it even if it isn\u2019t the best idea\n\nBack in the late 90\u2019s my parents bought a house that was large enough for the 7 of us and my dad\u2019s parents since my parents were caring for them. My dad was constantly making improvements to the house and property. One of which was to cut down some trees behind the house and next to a stream that were tall enough to hit the house if they fell that way. Rather than hiring a tree company, he decided to do it himself\u2026.. with \u201chelp\u201d from his father and my maternal grandfather. As previously mentioned, my parents bought the house so they had room for all us kids and enough room to care for my dad\u2019s parents. My dad\u2019s father was fairly frail and had dementia. My mom\u2019s dad was still as strong as an ox, however he had no hearing in one ear and this was only a year or two before my grandmother had to put him in a nursing home because his Alzheimer disease got so bad she couldn\u2019t manage anymore. \n\nSo, my dad and grandfathers cut down one of the smaller trees and that went really well. He was able to lay it out practically parallel to the stream that ran behind the house. Then he set his eye on a tree that wasn\u2019t tall enough to hit the house, but it was leaning that direction and would take out the pool and deck behind the house if it fell. He tried to cut it so it would fall next too the stream and he had my grandfathers on ropes around other trees to try to keep it pulled the right way. \n\nWhen the tree started to fall, my dad saw it was heading the way he was afraid it would go, towards the deck and pool. His father was getting pulled by his rope right under the tree. My mom\u2019s dad was on the other side but wasn\u2019t reacting. So my dad ran to the rope my mom\u2019s dad was on and hauled on it as hard as he could he was able to swing it away from the pool and deck, but the trunk landed right on top of a small kids play house they were using as a pool shed (stick built construction with real siding and shingles) and the canopy of the tree whipped the top of my cousin\u2019s car (she was there giving my sisters piano lessons) breaking the wind shield and leaving hundreds of small dents in the metal. If the play house wasn\u2019t there, her car would have been crushed. My dad\u2019s father was also just fine, aside from being rather soggy because he held onto the rope and got pulled into the stream. \n\nNeedless to say, my sisters weren\u2019t very happy about the play house being smashed even though they didn\u2019t use it much and my dad wised up and hired a tree company to take care of the rest of the trees.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1660332771.0},{"title":"Kevina broke her phone screen while showing us .. how she previously broke her phone screen","author":"Lonely-dude","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/wmj6ut\/kevina_broke_her_phone_screen_while_showing_us\/","text":"Very short kinda silly story of a classmate(not actually on my class she was on my school 1 or 2 years over me) that i just realized was a kevina story.\n\nSo one time my school was making a play or something and the whole school was on the  yard my friend haven't arrived yet so i approached a random group, one of the girls there was talking Abt how she recently got her phone screen replaced because it was broken and some guy asked her \"well how did it broke?\" So she takes out her phone and says \n\n\"I sometimes bite my phone on the corner and one time i did like this-\"\n\n*\/* Procedes to bite phone *\/*\n\nSilence \n\n*\/* Gasp *\/*\n\n\nShe had infact broken it again","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1660304572.0},{"title":"Kevin doesn\u2019t understand wifi","author":"Historical_Rhubarb89","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/wm6iia\/kevin_doesnt_understand_wifi\/","text":"I have a Kevin that works for me.

I suspect he had been held back a year, he was thick as two short planks and his body had met puberty and liked it. In a classroom of children there was one large, dumb adult and it wasn't the teacher. We'll call him Gorilla-boy.\n\nThe other one allegedly was the teacher, a psychotic woman with a personality disorder. She had an unconventional approach to the syllabus, instead of formal classes and academics we spent our day in a kind of political re-education camp. She was quite taken with Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Evita, and we listened to it daily, This was accompanied with us literally being indoctrinated against the Perons. We were expected to sit in a circle and denounce Juan and Eva Peron, as if, say, we'd been taken prisoner of war in North Korea. A disturbing comer of my childhood, we'll call her Mrs Kevina.\n\nMrs Kevina had a set temper tantrum she'd throw when things didn't go her way or a student got hurt or other things she was the author of; phase one she'd talk, yell, shriek, phase two she'd make incomprehensible undulating screaming noises and wave her arms as if she was trying to demonstrate semaphore, phase three she'd silently contemplate the disaster of whatever she'd done with a pale wan face.\n\nI set myself up on first meeting her; an exercise where we were supposed to match inventors and inventions I questioned the inclusion of Marconi and the radio, leading to her changing the parameters to \"invented or popularised\". Little did I realise this was going to come back on me! The high point of the year was when she had a tantrum and smashed out a window, then tried to pretend she hadn't, a bit difficult as the headmaster had happened to stroll past and see her doing it. \n\nThis is the story of Mrs Kevina, Gorilla-boy and his motorcycle. And the sweetest revenge a child ever tasted.\n\nI read *The Great Brain* and a phrase had stuck with me; \"That boy's plumb useless.\" I used it upon Gorilla-boy as he'd fail in another endeavour, which was often. Mrs Kevina heard this and decided to make me eat it. Gorilla-boy owned a motorcycle so she thought an impromptu demonstration would be the way to do this, pointedly and repeatedly telling me \"SOME people don't think he's any good at things.\"\n\nThe next day Gorilla-boy appeared in riding leathers and helmet, resembling the cast of *Mad Max* rather then a primary school student. We were duly led out into the yard where his grunt machine awaited. I was made to stand in front of the crowd, a pointed and obvious little exercise for my benefit. Having successfully thrown his leg over the nightmare machine, Mrs Kevina was now telling Gorilla-boy that THAT'S ENOUGH NOW, possibly having a rare insight into how stupid her plan was.\n\nSo, she'd arranged for Gorilla-boy to show off on his motorcycle in front of his peers. And so shall ye reap. First he over-revved so's we could hear and feel how powerful it was. She was well into phase one, speaking, yelling, shrieking. Then he started to move, riding a circuit around and around the yard, she's still shrieking. Then he gave it some stick, and popped a couple of wheelies back and forth, now she's into phase two and doing her noises and waving. Finally he attempted a jump, a small step onto the lawn area stood in for his ramp, he only really managed a bit of a hop, she had finished her tantrum and was now all thin faced, sad and defeated. \n\nShe turned and looked me dead in the eye.

Where I'm from, most people go their entire lives without ever seeing a gun in real life unless it's strapped to a cop, let alone killing someone with one. \n\nThis is the story of how Kevin decided to shoot his brother in the head with an empty gun. \n\nKevin and his brother were taken shooting in the country by an uncle. In Kevin's retelling about how privileged and exceptional he was, the uncle had an unlimited gun licence.

Aka \"Pulling a Bob\". This is not a \"I hate this and I'm sad\" posting it's basically a POV of me, someone who is too big for most environments. I'm not good with spacial awareness or my own strength which leads into my clumsiness, and my Kevinness.\n\n**How \"pulling a Bob\" began.**\n\nFor the most part I am a pretty intelligent guy, but sometimes I say or do something so stupid it's worthy of \"pulling a bob\"\n\nThe first time I pulled a Bob I was in a dollar store with a bamboo stick. I used to attach flags to the stick like a pole and tape them to my fence (This btw ended up destroying the fence after a while LMAO). I was walking down the aisle, and yelled out \"I'm a Jedi!\" and swung the fucking stick **into all these glass cups on the shelf.** SMASHHH CRASHHHH BOOOOMMM is what followed. Plastic and glass cups hurled onto the floor of the store or were pushed into the shelf. One customer goes \"Well that's why stores have insurance\". I ran my fatass outta that store after paying for the stick and glasses. Shit. When I got back into the car my fam and I burst into laughter and someone said \"wow you've been pulling Bob's today\" (I said something stupid earlier) and pulling a Bob was born.\n\nThe second time was in a mall. I have a massive ass backpack and when I turn it \"swing shwongs\". My sibling had be nerve racked watching me all day and I couldn't figure out till we got to Indigo. A large display of fiction books in the middle of a narrow aisle. Me \\*no spacial awareness\\*. Backpack: HELLLOOO BOOKs! Did you know if you **backhand** a book display with a bag shit goes EVERYWHERE!!! yeah me neither.\n\nThe third time we were having a fam convo and I can't remember what I exactly said but it was on such a level of stupidity of me just not paying attention that \"Pulling a Bob\" was engraved into my memory. So let's just go through some stupid shit I've done:\n\n\\- Sat on a chair and realized \"wow this is gonna break, don't sit there\" got off and forgot. An hour later I returned and well: \\*chair breaks\\* \\*I fall\\* \\*House has mini earthquake\\* My sibling: \\*runs down the stairs\\* DID THE TV FALL DOWN???? Me: AHHHH I HAVE SPLINTERS IN MY ASS!! (I didn't lol) Sibling: \"Didn't you say to not sit there?\" \\*realization\\* Me: I pulled a Bob... S: \\*Maniacal laughter ensues\\*\n\n\\- My last house's front porch was a deck and some boards were rotten\/weak. On a tipsy Friday morning around 1 am I decided for some fucking reason that I would \"fix\" my birdhouse that didn't need fixing. Step on one rotten board, nothing. Another. Nothing! I finish up and begin to walk inside, and the board no one expected decided to peaced out like a wishbone. I remember hearing that like show sound effect of breaking wood and next thing I knew my foot was touching the mud\/dirt underneath. Also I left my phone inside. I wasn't hurt more of just a \"Wow I'm a fuckin dumbass\" and laughter took over. I pulled myself up, bandaged my small cuts and my sibling came down: S: \"Hey are you ok?\" Me: \"I fell through the deck... again (I fell through the other deck in the backyard too)\" S: \\*sees\\* \"OMFG WTF JEDIBO WHYYY\" Me: \"I was trying to fix my birdhouse\". Something not privy to me until later was apparently I called out \"OHHH SHHHhhhiittt\" as I fell through but my sibling was like \"I don't wanna know\".\n\n\\- The Smarties incident. So you know how Smarties, being the fun environmentally friendly candy made their once plastic bags paper? Well this fucking dumbass thought they'd be able to take a small toss into a METAL shopping cart. And I'm talking the big ass bag too. It was on sale at the sketchy walmart and the last one. Naturally I sauced it into my cart and it **EXPLODED.** Suddenly there's a tsunami wave of the treat. Smarties pilling up underneath the cart, up the aisle, under the shelfs. I. was. FUCKED. I ran away like a few meters and was trailing smarties behind me. I was announcing out loud \"OH FUCK WHAT DO I DO???\" This old man came to my rescue. He grabbed the still leaking bag and sauced it onto a shelf and then said \"Let's pretend it's gone and move outta here\" to everyone in the aisle. We did. A worker had already showed up with a broom. I went back there the next week. Still smarties on the floor. Still feel bad.\n\n**These are my personal \"Pulled a Bob\":**\n\n\\- I went to the zoo with a friend. We came across the Zebras. I stood there for a moment. I forgot they were a thing.\n\n\\- Idk how to spell most words without spell check, or proper grammar for that instance. My first college semester was in Journalism. I changed programs. You probably can tell why.\n\n\\- I can't spell convenience store, I had to spell check it and even then after years of spelling it wrong spell check now spells it how I spelt it. That also goes for Chief, which I thought was Cheif. Captain, Capitan or Captian. I can't spell soldier. I spell it soldeir. This makes tweeting about Marvel or Halo a pain in the ass. Turns out I can spell Dc comics shit just fine, especially the super fake names, though I used to spell Darkseid as Darkside. Most of the big words in my phone are autocorrected wrong bc Siri is done with my shit. So this makes texting me, intesting. I also can't spell character, spelling it charecter.\n\n\\- I have to use a calculator to do simple ass equations. Ik I'm not thrilled either.\n\n\\- I fucked up making Jello. FUCKING JELLO.\n\n\\- I popped a sink off a walk trying to \"see myself in a mirror\" by jump pull myself up. Bathroom = FLOODED. Luckily it was an industrial bathroom at my dad's work and I was 7 and they were \"getting a new one anyways\" apparently.\n\n\\- I couldn't find my movable work station until I ran right into it. It was in the same spot I left it btw.\n\n\\- When this giant storm cloud was moving through my town I tried to cross a bridge over a highway not realizing that the wind would be crazy. That was fun.\n\n\\- repeated this 3 more times...\n\n\\- I went down to Lake Ontario to drive my RC boat, was told it would thunderstorm, thought it was BS. I got soaked.\n\n\\- Tried to make it to the bus stop last year when that massive circular green storm ripped through Ontario. It felt like I tried to swim in the ocean.\n\n\\- Tried to balance my popcorn bag on my chair in the movies. I knocked it over and it made the smarties look like nothing.\n\n\\- Knocked over my drink after saying \"I won't knock it over\" and ruined my shoes.\n\n\\- I was going down a steep hill, no helmet, no pads on a sketchy scooter my cousin owned trying to be \"super fast\" when I was 10. The scooter begun shaking itself to pieces and the front wheel buckled and broke. I was thrown. I had a choice. Dive to the grass or embrace the road burn. My dumbass tried to recreate what Optimus Prime did in the video game \"Transformers: War for Cybertron\" [trailer here](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QFZrL0x63c8) 0:56 - 1:00. I tried to superhero pose like a fictional character in a fictional world. Reality basically laughed at me and I ate shit.\n\nThis was but a taste.

Korben's always been a great guy, but he's not the sharpest straw in the bucket.\n\nWe used to play Dungeons & Dragons a while back before he moved. If you're familiar with D&D, a big part of the game is rolling dice to determine results of certain actions. Most people are familiar with the [six-sided die, or D6](https:\/\/i.etsystatic.com\/5360212\/c\/3000\/2000\/0\/0\/il\/ed8123\/3235192485\/il_680x540.3235192485_crv3.jpg). But the game also uses other dice with various other amounts of sides; the D12, D10, D20, and even D100 (which can be an actual one-hundred-sided die or two D10s rolled together).\n\nBut the topic of this story is [the four-sided die, the D4](https:\/\/cdn11.bigcommerce.com\/s-70184\/images\/stencil\/1280x1280\/products\/3076\/7524\/4-sided-black-dice-top-read__83042.1624458542.jpg?c=2). As you can see, it's a simple pyramid-like shape with four sides (a tetrahedron). When you roll it, whichever side is pointing up is the side that counts, naturally.\n\nAfter a few years of playing some great games, Korben remarks one day how cool it would be to have a D3 while holding a D4 and looking at it intently. (side note, [D3s actually do exist](https:\/\/www.pippd.com\/products\/d3-dice-translucent-3-sided-dice-6-pieces-choose-your-color?variant=40637525655720), which I found out just now as I checked when I remembered this story, but Korben still pulls off a great Kevin move)\n\nI asked him, \"How would that work?\"\n\nHe said, \"You just have to hollow out one of the sides,\" matter-of-factly.\n\nI told him that wouldn't work, as it doesn't matter if there's a hole in it; there's still technically a plane there connecting the other sides, and it's still a pyramid with four sides.\n\n\"But you just wouldn't count one of the sides,\" he argued.\n\nI pointed out that even if you \"didn't count one of the sides,\" there are still two other sides showing the same number.\n\nHe tried to prove his point by suggesting some random side was hollowed out, and then rolling the die.\n\n\"Okay, so now, if we count *this* side as hollow, then, it's...\" and then it finally dawned on him how stupid this idea of his was.\n\n\"Yeah, you're right, that wouldn't work at all, I'm an idiot.\"\n\nAll this time our dungeon master and Korben's wife were watching us in disbelief and we all busted out laughing.\n\nI miss that guy.\n\n(Edit to clarify the D4 is a *pyramid-like* shape, a tetrahedeon, not an actual pyramid)","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1659504864.0},{"title":"Kevin the Professor","author":"xenonyxen","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/wd70o6\/kevin_the_professor\/","text":"Of all the possible paths in life that Kevin could have taken, I never would have expected him to become a college professor. A while back, I unwittingly took a music appreciation class with Kevin to fulfill a general education requirement. Just for some context, it was a two-and-a-half-hour-long class that only met once per week, and it only covered the most basic, well-agreed upon aspects of music history.\n\nSo, without further ado, here\u2019s my abbreviated list of Kevin\u2019s many highs and lows throughout the semester:\n\n* **Kevin\u2019s First Day of Class:** On the first day of class, Kevin showed up late. He struggled to connect his Surface tablet to the projector for several minutes before he realized that he would need to buy a new adapter. Kevin felt that he couldn\u2019t teach without using the projector, so he dismissed us after less than fifteen minutes.\n* **Kevin\u2019s Syllabus:** Kevin apparently didn\u2019t have a copy of the course\u2019s syllabus, so he had nothing to give us with our assignments, grading criteria, etc. on the first day of class. He eventually got a copy, or perhaps just wrote a new one, and sent it to students four weeks after the start of the semester. What makes this all the more fascinating is that he supposedly had taught this class at my university before.\n* **Kevin\u2019s Learning Management System:** Kevin couldn\u2019t figure out the university\u2019s online learning management system. We only took two tests during the semester because it took him several weeks to write each assessment and put them online correctly.\n* **Kevin\u2019s Textbook:** On the third week of class, Kevin nonchalantly mentioned something about the required textbook. No one knew about this textbook; he had not told us about it before then, nor had he set it as a required text on the university\u2019s website (and at this point, he still hadn't given us a syllabus, either). He was mildly surprised to learn that no one had purchased it yet.\n* **Kevin\u2019s Curse of Knowledge:** Kevin often talked about having *The Curse of Knowledge*.  According to Kevin, this meant that he often forgot that his students were not as educated as he was. When he gave lectures, he would typically speed-read the textbook publisher\u2019s slides and skip over things that he thought were either unimportant, he didn\u2019t agree with, or didn\u2019t understand. When someone asked a question, he typically just gave a short, terse, response or told them to, \u201cask Dr. Google,\u201d before returning to his speed-reading.\n* **Kevin\u2019s Commute:** As well as teaching my class in Ohio, Kevin was apparently a band director at a university in North Carolina. Kevin FLEW back and forth between Ohio and North Carolina every week. I can\u2019t imagine the bill.\n* **Kevin\u2019s Thermostat:** On several occasions, Kevin exhaled on the automatic thermostat in an attempt to turn on the air conditioner.\n\nThat\u2019s about it for now. I do have a few more stories about him if anyone is interested. After the first few weeks of class, seemingly over half of the students decided that the class just wasn\u2019t worth it. Many used his class as a study hall. Others were never to be seen again. I wonder how Kevin felt about that.\n\n**EDIT:** I'll post some more Kevin the Professor stories soon :)","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1659324340.0},{"title":"Kevin's drunk tattoo.","author":"ronaldHucklebee","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/wczace\/kevins_drunk_tattoo\/","text":"Hi everybody, it's Ron back with another story about my absolute Kevin of a brother, Donald, and this time he may have just done the most Kevin-like thing that he has ever done before which is truly saying a lot. At this point, I would almost consider his Kevinness more of a talent then a problem.\n\nSo last night Donald went out to a bar with a couple of friends and, long story short, he drank way too much. Apparently this brought a brilliant idea to mind, he would get a tattoo, but he couldn't just go get something normal like a cross, or a skull or something like that, no, he had to get something Donald worthy. And what else could he choose but his favorite billboard. And which billboard would that be? You ask. Well, you know those weird Jungle Law billboards that would make you never want to hire one of their lawyers? Yeah, Donald loves those. So by the end of the night Donald was out about $2,000 and had a pretty decent outline of this: https:\/\/images.app.goo.gl\/VC95RXQMBuZanZ6w7 which was obviously a horrible choice, but hey, he was drunk so at least there is an explanation for it right? And let's look on the bright side, since it is only an outline at least it will be easier to have removed. \n\nBut no, when I suggested this to Donald he just laughed and said \"what do you mean 'get it removed'? I'm going to have it finished, Jungle Law baby!\" \n\nSo yeah, today he went back and I would say that his tattoo is about 2\/3 of the way done, his wife if pissed, I'm confused, and Donald is quickly becoming a walking, talking Jungle law billboard. AND HE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER ABOUT IT. \n\nI can just imagine the confusion of the tattoo artist when Donald told him what he wanted, got the outline done, and then actually came back the next day.

He is generally a very nice and zen dude but there are a lot of things he has done that absolutely make him fit into this stereotype. Today I'll focus on our experience with him playing Ark. \nArk is a game like minecraft without the blocky design and where you can basically build bases, focus on survival and most importantly tame animals including dinosaurs and have them as pets. Kevin started playing Ark along with the group about 2 years ago. An experienced friend explained how the game works and set up a sped up and modded server for us to play in private. Within three weeks of playing Kevin had: \n- Killed a friend's pet otter because he wanted to see if it dropped a pelt or sth.\n- Killed a tamed dinosaur we had with us for carrying stuff. We were on an expedition for supplies and had the dinosaur with us the whole time. About 5 minutes he started attacking it and killed it before we could stop him. He said he saw it suddenly next to him and got scared it would kill him.\n- He kept breaking apart the walls in the base because he wanted to build other, useless, stuff and when asked why wouldn't he just gather supplies he responded Noone had showed him how.\n- He had, on three separate occasions just afked while we were traveling, without saying anything to us, resulting in him getting killed by wild animals. He bitched about it all three times.\n\nBonus story because it is the most incomprehensible thing he has done. Now I know this story may seem fake, I know it seems fake, but I swear it is absolutely true. Kevin works in IT support and if you have worked in it you know that clients can be extremely irritating. Kevin decided to make a fake fb profile in order to insult and complain about clients on his company's fb page's posts. Kevin also decided it would be a good idea to use the name of someone in the friend group for this profile. Along with his location and some other identifiers. So for weeks he would log into this profile and insult people with our friend's name. And when this friend found the profile, because he had use enough identifiers that it came up as a suggested friend, and asked us to report the profile, Kevin was shocked and acted all pissy because \"it wasn't harming anyone\" and \"you don't really work there anyway\".","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1659274061.0},{"title":"Kevin gets scammed by teens","author":"bsojazzy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/wcaq8g\/kevin_gets_scammed_by_teens\/","text":"This particular Kevin is an ex of mine. He was a security officer during the week, a club bouncer on the weekends, and a complete idiot all the time. The smartest thing he ever did was refuse to get a new job after quitting his last one, which gave me an excuse to kick him out. How he thought I could afford to support him working as a delivery driver is beyond me. \n\nIn any case, one balmy Saturday night, Kevin decided to pick up a random group of three teenage girls on the street downtown and give them a ride. They promised to give him cash and he figured it wouldn't be a big deal. Not a great idea, but whatever, he's a grown man.\n\nThen they tell him they want to stop at a gas station for cigarettes. Somehow NONE of them \"remembered\" to bring ID, so they asked him to go in and grab a couple packs for them. This absolute genius decided to leave these girls he'd never met before in his running car with his phone mounted on the dash. \n\nNeedless to say, his car was gone when he came back out. He had to ask the cashier to use a phone to call me for a ride. It took me a solid hour of arguing for him to only halfway get how ALL of that was a terrible idea. I guess no flags are red flags when they're attached to a group of pretty girls half his age.\n\nWe reported the car stolen, got him a new phone, and cops found the car several days later. The girls apparently went on a shoplifting spree and abandoned the car when it ran out of gas. Some stolen merchandise was still in the trunk when we got the car back.\n\nHe figured it worked out because the stuff in the trunk was in my size.

I went to a drug store with a Canada post in my area that was sadly closed. As I was walking out with my package to my friend covered in stickers I ran into another guy in the lot. I tell him he's closed and he tells me \"Awww this is the only one in the area that's open till 5PM!!\" this part was true but then what followed up was odd. Kevin notices my package after his kid went \"oooo space stickers\". Kevin says \"Woah cool box! Nice stickers! So, how did it get so cool??\" It was probably only .5 seconds before I responded with \"...the stickers?\" Kevin stares at me and says \"Huh?\" and then more silence and then \"Well they are cool. Let's go bud.\" and they walked away. Oh Kevin, you told me why you thought they were cool but damn man.\n\n**Kevin thinks bus drivers are psychic.** I take public transit and while Instagram would have you believe this is a fun aesthetic, it is not. This guy used to be on the same bus I was, every day. And every day he would scream \"YOU MISSED MY FUCKING STOP AGAIN YOU STUPID FUCK. PULL OVER. PULLLL OVER. PULLLLLLLLL OVERRRRRRRR\". As the bus driver would pull over he would scream \"FOR FUCK SAKES. WE GOTTA DO THIS EVERY DAY REALLY???\" For weeks this was the thing. Different driver each day mind you so they had no clue. Now sometimes the bus driver misses the stop, but Kevin never pulled the cord, talked to the driver or pushed the \"push to stop\" button. Never. One day during a tirade the driver, an older fellow just simply said \"Sir I do not appreciate your behaviour. Why are you so upset?\" Kevin: \"BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS MISS MY STOP\" BD: \"Sir this is my first time on the route during the day, I don't know you nor your stop. You didn't pull the cord or the button so how would I have known?\" Kevin: \"NO. You do know my stop!! I told you it! I told you when I got on the bus!\" Kevin then tells him and in turn all of us because he was yelling that bus drivers are psychic and it was really rude for them to ignore him. When questioned further he truly believed this thus why he never pulled the cord or pushed the button or talked to the driver EVER. If there were psychics Kevin I don't think they'd be bus drivers.... Also thankfully a new route that was more convenient changed it's way a bit to go near my area so I just started taking that one to get around town. I took the old route after the better one was canceled due to covid and he wasn't there. Hope I never see Kevin again.

Tens of teens\/early twenties canvassers would convene in the office in the PM and be driven out to turf in a small bus\/buses. We'd take a short break and then follow prepared maps around the neighborhood, the main error being people not correctly reporting houses done on a master map, leading to repeating recently done turf. \n\nKevin was next level in all aspects. His only known asset was a leather jacket, not appropriate sales garb. He'd wear it out to the field, hide it in a tree and then retrieve it, in theory. On the day I saw this, he stuffed it in his backpack, swing it around a few times and threw it into the tree. This took a couple of goes until it caught. Several hours later as we pulled back into the office he raised the fact he had left it behind. The driver let us off to cash out with admin, then drove out to the tree with him, adding maybe an hour to his work day.\n\nFriday was knock off day and usually involved a pub crawl. A party of us walked off to the first pub, one guy apparently trying to light a joint (moderately illegal locally at the time). Kevin couldn't wait for the pub toilet and decided to try his hand at public urination (quite illegal). He chose a car park and walked on in, unzipping as he went. This was the backside of the local fire station, with his unwanted presence tripping an alarm. An older woman in civilian clothing appeared and summed up the situation at a glace, screaming at him that This Was Not A Toilet. Kevin ran off with her following, trying to get the zip back up on the move, resembling a Benny Hill sketch but with less lingerie. If the guy had gotten his joint lit there was a distinct chance of some arrests and consequences, but Kevin's gotta Kevin, right?\n\nKevin's downfall was the day of the crash. He'd driven his parents' car in, surprising he got that far, and saw the work bus at an intersection ahead. He may have been trying to say \"Hello!\", or \"Look, I can drive a car now!\", in any case he simply rammed into it at right angles in a configuration known as a \"T-Bone\" with zero attempt at stopping. He wasn't formally sacked, he took his pay that day and left with the car to go to a panel beaters to try and fix the front end before telling the parents. And that's where his attempt at responsibility ended, apparently there was some vague promise at fixing the side of the bus he'd run into but he never returned. \n\nSome months later we saw Kevin while we were out on one of those pub crawls. He'd been telling his Kevin version of \"why I am unemployed\" to the bar flys, as one turned to us and declared, \"I wouldn't pay to get the boss's car fixed if I ran into it! Would YOU pay to get the boss's car fixed if you ran into it?\"\n\nIt wasn't the boss's car.

So I (24F), met my friend Kevina (25F) at a warehouse job 5 years ago, we were the only two girls in the warehouse except for the office ladies upstairs who we never saw, so we became fast friends. \n\nLet me just preface this by saying she has a heart of gold and is extremely generous, and she is now part of my small friend group of 15+ years because she's very loveable in a strange way so she fit right in. \n\nThe first day I met her was my first day at that job, later found out she was also new as she had only been there 2 weeks when I arrived. Well I was sat in the packing room learning the ropes, wearing my black jeans and black t-shirt because I figured I would get dirty on the job (I did, it's a warehouse, so), Kevina walks in wearing pure white, thin leggings, and a floral top, bright pink handbag on her arm. She parades in with a 'morning guys' (if you're from the UK, she's from Birmingham, imagine her lines in a Brummie accent. We're in the west country, she moved here). She heads to the computer to clock in, bends over the desk to do so, flashes her underwear clearly through the white leggings. I was sat there like 'welp, I admire this gals confidence for sure'. \n\nSo we became friends on that first day, like I said, only two women there, and man have I got more stories about her than I could even include in this one post, she's a whole 10 book saga. My earliest memory of her being...well, her, was when I was in the factory floor office, which unlike upstairs was all male office men, and I was just grabbing some paperwork for a build. I would hear all sorts of conversations from these office lads when I would be in there getting something, and that particular day for some reason they were talking about hemorrhoids? Well in walks Kevina to also get paperwork and she's a curious creature so says \"what you lot talking about?\" an office guy says \"hemorrhoids\", Kevina bellows out \"OH, I have them\", the entire office went silent and looked at her, she goes \"ye, too much cock up the ass\", turns around and walks back out with her paperwork. This was when I realised she's REALLY something. \n\nAnother memory from that particular workplace that actually came up much later, was the fact that when she worked there she was 20, but we all thought she was 21, because she told us she was 21. So when her birthday rolled around, June 10th, we believed her to be turning 22 of course, wished her happy birthday and whatever. We had a tradition in that place that on your birthday (or usually the day you work nearest to your birthday because people usually book the actual day off) you would bring in cake for everyone, and by doing that you could eat the cake all year round that was there for all the birthdays, because you just provided your own, it was cleaner that way. Kevina didn't bring in cake even though she would always eat the cake on other people's birthdays, but we thought oh well she can barely remember our names let alone to buy cake on the way to work. Fast forward to a couple years later, we're good friends and she invites me to Amsterdam with her and her friends, I say yes and we start preparing. We're at the travel agency booking everything and she has her I.D on the table ready, I take a glance, her birthday is November 22nd? So we finish up and leave and I said \"22nd November? I thought your birthday is the 10th June?\" she just casually goes \"oh, no, it's not, I just didn't want to pay the pension\" I just stared at her, \"pension?\" she says \"yeah because if you're under 21 you have to pay the pension at work but if you're over 21 you can choose so I had to say my birthday was different to make me 21, I wanted all of my pay I didn't want to pay it to pension\" I said \"one that is not true at all why did you think this? And two you do realise \\*workplace\\* HR knew your birthday anyway because you brought in your passport to photocopy on your induction day just like me, the only people you told that you were 21 was us...the packing department, so it made no difference\" she just says \"oh, oh yeah. Fuck sake I had to come to work on my real birthday and spend my 21st packing boxes and pretending it's not my birthday when I didn't have to pay the pension all along\" what?! \n\nThis post is getting long but I have 100s of stories, from the time I spent an entire week in Italy, told her I was in Italy, sent her pictures of Venice, and she says 'nice pictures, is that France?' to the time that she browsed porn sites on a work computer, on work wifi because she thought Jeff the forklift driver was a pornstar. So just let me know if you want more Kevina stories, because she's really one of a kind.

We went to Taco Bell tonight and I told him that I will cover the meal so we can just have it all on one order. I mostly wanted to do this because it was late and didn't want them to cut us off if we tried to make it two separate orders, this has happened to me before.\n\nKevin was driving and so I just told him my order, which was just three soft tacos no lettuce, instead he says two, and when I correct him he says one extra instead of just saying he meant three, which confuses the person taking the order. Then he says he is done with that order, forgetting that we're doing it all in one order, so I needed to correct him again.\n\nThen he tried to order a 5 dollar box. I don't even know if that is a thing or not, don't visit Taco Bell often, but regardless they didn't have it. So he orders something else that comes out to about $8.\n\nOnce we pull up to get our food, they asked to clarify if we were one or two orders. I told them we were on one order and that I'd be paying for both. I payed and they gave me my food, apparently it didn't click with them at all that yes Kevin's food was part of that order, despite them asking for clarification and me giving it.\n\nSo we had to tell them we still needed his food which they still weren't done preparing and once it was ready they needed payment for that since they didn't charge me for it, I assume. I was prepared to pay it like I had intended, but Kevin begins gathering up some loose change and says he has it. I asked him to make sure if he had the correct amount of money, because I know for a fact he can't count. He said yes. Well turns out he was $3 short, since he only had enough for a $5 dollar box. Which he didn't get, because they didn't have it. The only reason he was so sure he had enough, is because he apparently asked another one of our coworkers to count it and tell him if he had enough money for Taco Bell, but again, he asked if he'd have enough for a $5 box, which again he wasn't getting.\n\nSo I not only had to cover the whole bill, but had to be there for this whole awkward affair, all for some bland tacos that didn't sit well in my stomach.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1657166487.0},{"title":"Kevin compared himself to african slaves and called me a racist for Selling him cheap vape liquid","author":"Tall_Thinker","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/vsxsc4\/kevin_compared_himself_to_african_slaves_and\/","text":"To Begin with i want to apologize for any grammatical errors. English is my second language. \n\n\nSo this is a story about my former Friend Kevin. I met him through school for people between 18-35 years of age when i wanted to become a Sound engineer. This is very important to the story. Kevin liked music and was actually a decent singer, but lacked any form of self awareness and couldnt take any constructive criticism whatsoever. \n\n\nWith that being said, lets start from the beginning. When i first started at this school to become a Sound engineer, we All sat down and said hello to eachother, told a bit about ourself etc etc. Then our music teacher asked us if we did anything fun during our summer vacation. Kevin was very eager to say something so our teacher let him start. He said he went to Germany with his family and bought a ton of very \"cheap\" cigarettes. Our teacher asked him \"well how cheap?\" Kevin almost yelled out \"10 euros Per pack!\" Most of us laughed a bit and asked him if he knew what the exchange rate was. Kevin sat dumbfounded and asked \"whats that?\" \nMy teacher then asked \"do you know what exchange rate means?\" Kevin ofcourse said No. He was Then told about currency and what the exchange rate is. The following conversation went more or less like this \n\nKevin: but the pack said 10\n\nTeacher: but it was another currency, you paid almost double the price\n\nKevin: but the pack said 10, how is that more than 40? (Our local currency) \n\nTeacher: because euro's are a different currency than our own. \n\nKevin: but..... But it said 10..... I dont understand\n\n\nFast forward 6 months\n\nEvery december our school set Up a Christmas theater Play for kindergardeners to enjoy during the first week of that month. Totally free, made kids happy, let our musicians and Sound engineers get some experience in, fun week honestly. Anyway. We practiced this stuff from october until the week of the live shows. Kevin always wanted to be the \"lead actor\" which means santa. Kevin was a big guy and our school only had 1 costume for that part. When it was time to do costume testings we found out that the big black belt for the santa outfit, did NOT fit Kevin at all! So when Kevin Saw that, he flipped the f*** out. We were all yelled at. One of our guys had enough and told him \"lose 30 kilos in 3 days or figure something else out\" \n\nLater that day our actors for the play had to practice their lines and some scenes. Kevin was pissed everytime somebody took more than 0.5 seconds to react for their lines. Think Sharpay from high school musical, that kind of diva. So he made himself very unpopular, very fast. The fun part about this, is that even though he got pissed at others during practice, he was the person most notorious for forgetting his lines. \n\nQue the live shows. Every single one of us took it seriously. Even though it was a free show for children, we still wanted them to be happy. The show starts, everything runs smoothly. That is until..... Kevin walks on stage. 30 seconds in and he stares blankly at the other actors cause he forgot his lines. This continued for most of the show. You would think that it would be stage fright, right? RIGHT?! no no. Kevin did this every single day throughout the entire week. Never bothered to read the script, never bothered to ask the others for advice. His excuse? \"Im santa, im the Main lead, if you dont like me you can f*** off!\" Followed by hours of Facebook updates with \"nobody likes me, im a warrior of justice! Shoutout to the real bros!\" Etc. \n\nAnd im not done. This school was for musicians, Sound engineers, camera guys, even game development. We All knew we had 4 years, taking classes, visit venues, concert halls, All the big Boy stuff. But ofcourse our regular classes were the usual thing. Now Kevin, Kevin decided he knew Better. Kevin didnt see this as a school. Kevin Saw this as a place where he would sing, eat, shit, repeat. Through the 4 years he went there Kevin participated in 1 class. 1 full hour class. His excuse? \"Im here to sing, not learn, deal with it\" so ofcourse we let him believe that. Finally me and my producer talked to him and said \"look, you sit on a expensive chair in a million dollars studio and stare at the screen, All you have to do is stay awake\" so he went to class. Did he stay awake? Absolutely not. He fell asleep not once, not twice, but THREE times! After class was over we went out for a cigarette. I asked Kevin \"you fell asleep three times dude. How?\" \n\nHis answer almost made me slap him in the face. This...... Waste of air looked me in the eyes and said \"the teachers doesnt have to be so hard on us, we are students, not african slaves\" i asked him if he was serious and he said that he was, so i simply walked away. \n\nLater that day we had a big discussion about him thinking he could compare himself to african slaves. This turned into a big fight where Kevin dragged the entire school into it. Nobody sided with Kevins slave Theory so he got the upper management to get a meeting with Kevin, me, and 2 others. The head of the school board told me \"apologize to Kevin or you wont leave my office\" i told him that he would have a long Day ahead of him, cause i didnt want to apologize for Kevin comparing himself to slave trading. After a 30 minutes staring contest, he decided that me and the leader not backing down was dumb, and i should go back to class. I agreed and told him that football was on tonight (we both cheered for the new Orleans saints) \nAfter This i met Kevin outside when i was smoking. He very humbly asked \"can we talk? I cut myself with razors last night cause i was so mad\"\nI asked him why on earth he would cut himself. Kevin looked at me and said \"cause i read online that its the popular thing to do when you are sad\" i shook my head, called him an idiot but gave him a hug and said that all is forgiven. I did feel very bad since had actually cut himself. He had never done self harm before or after that. \n\n\nNow. Kevin was a straight moron, No lying about that. But he always made the jobs harder for sound engineers. To paint you a picture. You have to adjust All the Sound levels to create a nice mix as the end result. Does the drums drown everything out? Turn it down, cant hear the guitar? Turn it up. This idea was baffling for Kevin to understand. We were at a big conference for schools and educational places. We ofcourse highlighted our Sound engineering, music department and game development classes. So we were doing a few live songs to gather a crowd around our booth. Kevin had a few songs and my producer was doing the Sound. Suddently Kevin decided to \"cup\" the mic. Which is when you hold your fingers around the grille part of the microphone. This is the worst thing you can ever do to a Sound engineer (rappers are notoriously hated for this on a global scale) the reason that Sound engineers hates this, is because it will create feedback from the monitors and make the very annoying high pitched sound that Will make your ears bleed. So my producer kept adjusting the EQ and try to turn the Sound level on his microphone down. This did not sit well with Kevin. Everytime the Sound was lowered, Kevin sang higher. In the end my producer had to simply turn off Kevins microphone. Kevin was Furious. Yelled at everyone in sight. Walked Up to my producer and asked \"wtf is your problem?! Why did you do that?!\" \n\nKevin was not happy when he was told \"your voice annoyed the microphone, speakers, and everyone around you\" Kevin didnt talk to us the rest of the Day. \n\nNow, A year after This we were all pretty much done with Kevins moronic way of life. We were at this small festival where our school got to Play some songs. The band before us started 15 minutes late. Everyone of us just thought it was No big deal. Then there was Kevin with the big brain comment. The band on stage which was another school just finished a song. The front singer was just about to say something when Kevin yelled \"WHEN ARE YOU GOING OFF STAGE SO WE CAN PLAY?!!\" At this time i had enough. So i smacked him in the back of the head and started yelling at him \" stfu you retard! Those are 13 year old kids, its not their f****** fault!\" \nHe turned around and said \"my girlfriend is right there man, i was just kidding!\" I just told him i didnt give a f*** and that he should keep his mouth shut. \n\n2 years after This, we were both done with the school. I started working, he was..... Well he wasnt doing anything with his life. He couldnt find a job because he expected a months Pay for 2 Days of work and working 8 hour shifts are hard. He showed Up to job interviews in sweatpants, long greasy hair he never combed, and he rarely showered either. Yet he didnt understand why he couldnt find a job. Then covid happened and concerts werent a thing at that point. So i started working in a vape shop to keep a steady income. Kevin vaped as well, so i sold him some liquid for wholesale price so he saved money instead of getting ripped off. Because of this, Kevin thought i was taking advantage of him and called me every name in the book. I got kinda annoyed by that and told him \"whatever dude, you saved more than half off of everything because of me\" so by me saying that...... Kevin called me a racist (Kevin was a german immigrant) and told me i hated germans. So i blocked him and havent talked to Kevin since. \n\nIm sorry this dragged on, but these a but a few of the stories of my Kevin.

Jiriah is the character of one of his favorite animes. The baby turned out being a girl and was given a good name. While my sister was in labor Kevin hade bronchitis.

He hit poison ivy and it went all over his body. He was allergic to poison ivy and had to go to the hospital. He also some how hurt the bone at the bottom of his spine. He refused to go to the doctor for three days and the next day it started to hurt so bad that he had to go to the hospital. The hospital didn\u2019t really do anything and sent him home, after that he was fine.\n\nKevin and his D&D friends:\n\nKevin went out every Friday night to play D&D with his friends, he would miss anything to play, LITERALLY anything. The D&D group eventually broke up because one of them found out someone else in the group was with thief sister.\n\nKevin\u2019s keviness:\nKevin has a strong opinion about everything even if he doesn\u2019t understand it. We were once talking about Star Wars because of his Star Wars themed D$D game and he started telling me some weird conspiracy theory on how George Lucas didn\u2019t actually make the movies and they were someone else\u2019s concept and George Lucas only took the credit. The only Star Wars experience he had was the Han Solo movie and the book that he claims he read but probably didn\u2019t read. He also spoke about how stalking celebrities is a morally gray action because how else are you going to see them.\n\nKevin\u2019s second daughter: \n\nHe wanted to give this baby weird anime names again. If it was a boy he got to name it. The names he came up with was Odysseus and Jiriah again. The main problem is that he can\u2019t even spell odysseus. When they found out the baby was a girl he came up with the name Ophelia which was from an obscure anime from 2006. He had bronchitis during this baby\u2019s birth as well. My sister gave the baby a pretty good name this time as well.\n\nKevin and the icy hot:\n\nA few days ago Kevin came home from work at the paper factory tired and sore, he decided to rub icy hot all over the upper part of his body and when that didn\u2019t work he did it again. He had to go to the hospital due to harsh pain in his skin. At the hospital he was losing so much liquid, he couldn\u2019t lay down on his back without agonizing pain everywhere. It turns out he had two types of influenza and the doctors said that the icy hot made the influenza much much worse. \n\nThank you for reading this whole thing if you did. Kevin will definitely continue to stuff like this so I will keep you all updated.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1656559308.0},{"title":"Kevin loses his banana (yeah really)","author":"ronaldHucklebee","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/vn2lky\/kevin_loses_his_banana_yeah_really\/","text":"So last night at 2am I got a call from Donald. He was pissed. I shit you not, he had literally counted his bananas and came up one short, I was at his house the day before and he was pretty sure that I was the thief. First of all, who the hell counts their bananas? And second of all, it is *food,* people *eat* food, why are you mad that a banana is missing? Bananas are like $2 and I know that he has the money to eat.\n\nAnyway, I explained to him that I didn't take his banana and told him to chill out. He has kids and a wife, one of them probably got hungry and was like \"hey look, a completely normal banana which hasn't been counted, I should eat it.\" He seemed to calm down a little and said that he was going to bed so I thought that all was well. Sadly I was wrong.\n\nAbout noon today Donald's wife calls me and says that he hasn't talked to her all morning, and he won't stop running around the house looking for something but he won't tell her what it is. Apparently he had moved the couch three times, taken everything out of their refrigerator and put it back, checked under every bed in the house, and was now sitting on the out of place couch looking extremely confused. I still don't know what he would have done if he had found it under the couch. I can just imagine him pulling a smashed ass banana out of the depths of the couch and holding it up in the air for all to see like it was Simba from the lion king.\n\nWhen I told her that he was looking for a banana she thought that I was joking. It turns out that the night before, she had eaten one thinking that it wouldn't cause any problems. And now Donald keeps complaining to me that his wife went behind his back and ate his banana, he needs potassium, how could she do that to him? He feels so betrayed.\n\nI guess that the moral of the story is do not take Donald's bananas, he counts those.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1656463676.0},{"title":"Kevin the artist","author":"Throwaway1two34","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/vmn8a3\/kevin_the_artist\/","text":"I volunteered for a non-profit for 20 years, and met many people with personality disorders. Some were good, some were bad and one was Kevin. Kevin was an older man who fancied himself as an artist, no one else has ever ever ever agreed with either assessment. Kevin followed a mate into my life, a talented artist who was wiling to indulge Kevin's fantasy. The mate made an excellent contribution to our free publication, Kevin decided he could too.   \n\n\nFirst he gave us a bunch of small sketches which we ended up using as marginalia, because it didn't matter how crap they were. Then he started doing text stories. This put us somewhat in a bind, what with his unconventional approach to language I would ordinarily proof them and notify of any changes. These were drawn images. Take them as is or not. The editorial committee decided to run them, and I shuddered to see them in the finished copy.  \n\n\nI tried to indulge him and put him onto an online art community, set up for soft praise no matter how crap, so he could possibly get some positive feedback. He asked how he could progress to becoming an editor and I gave him the advice; produce a dummy version as demonstration. This he duly did, albeit via the unusual choice of Microsoft Front Page (a web page development tool) for desktop publishing. Having shown he could get text and graphics on a printed page he made his play; he wanted us to let him do a publication for the organisation. \n\nThe stumbling point was quality control. We wanted to encourage him, but all knew he was wildly incompetent. Kevin assured us he had help, two professionals outside our organisation were going to proof the magazine for him for free. We'd do it ordinarily but he insisted his friends would, and they were working in the industry. He told us he produced a draft but we refused to pay for it sight unseen. He somehow kept forgetting to bring it. This standoff lasted maybe six months until we let him draw from our account at the printers; while they couldn't care less about the content we got some disturbing feedback on his behaviour as they too noticed he was wrong.  \n\n\nFinally the day came when he showed up with a cardboard box, copy hot off the press!!! and then ...  \n\n\nFirstly, it wasn't by him or indeed anyone associated with the non-profit. He had simply downloaded tens of pages from the self-same art community I'd shown him. Like a screen print version of those galleries to absolutely no purpose. The one thing I repeatedly asked him was whether he had permission from these artists to print their work; he swore blind he did but given everything else was a tissue of lies, still a grey area.   \n\n\nSecondly the typos. Many, many typos. Not just grammatical and formatting, he had literally screen captured whole web pages with the greyed out URLs visible and unformatted. Someone with a softer touch asked him about the proofing by two industry professionals, as it turned out this was not a thing. It'd be too charitable to call it a misunderstanding, he lied in order to get us to pay for his crap. Determined to fail. As to the magnitude of the foulness, I ran out of patience counting but assuming a constant error rate from the first dire pages, well over one thousand typos in a mere 80 pages, a remarkable figure.  \n\n\nFinally just to add a cherry on top; a full page ad for his dummy draft copy, something we would not have authorised. Just to add insult.  \n\n\nSo we went ahead and distributed it. Never got one word of feedback, one correspondent said they were looking forward to reading it, then ... radio silence.   \n\n\nThen came the retaliation; Kevin walked away from the non-profit even though we never said boo to him; a level of insight that was stunning coming from him. The others warned me; he had taken to blaming me for the bad publication. Then he commenced telling people I was talking about them behind their backs. As effective as his decision that I was to blame or his editing prowess, I was more offended than anything.   \n\n\nIt was revealed Kevin had stood for office in the annual elections the non-profit held, not because he wanted to help but because he thought it belonged on his CV, totally in line with his greed and self indulgence. If that's not stupid enough he tried to get a teaching qualification only to have the technical college exit him from the program on a technicality. I was sympathetic and suggested he approach the union about getting his fees back, but really, I'd say they knew full well he wasn't right; his incompetent and ultimately retaliatory behaviour marked him out as unfit for any responsibility.

This is like an introduction to him. I am going to start with how Kevin met his wife. She was a waitress at his favorite restaurant and he asked the manager of the restaurant if he could date his now wife. Back then he seemed alright we had not met him yet so we invited him to stay for a little time so we could meet him. We had made pancakes for him and his wife the first morning they were here, he started complaining on how there is too much sugar in pancakes and how he doesn\u2019t wanna eat unhealthy. So he leaves our house to go buy himself som breakfast, and what does he come back with for breakfast? Well for breakfast he had a whole 2 liter of Pepsi because Pepsi was too unhealthy. The next day we took him to New York City. When we arrived in the city he looked out of the window and said \u201clook at all of those people where do they go at night\u201d. Later when we were walking to a restaurant Kevin shouted at the top of his lungs, \u201c HOT DAMN those men be holdin hands\u201d when he saw two random men holding hands. He also would refuse to wear a shirt while he was here so he could show my family his berserk tattoo.\n\nFor the most recent story about this guy was that he was very dehydrated one day after work and decided to put icy hot all over his body and once that didn\u2019t work he did it again and again. This made him sick because he had to go to the ER and he just got out.\n\nThere will definitely be more stories about this guy coming when he does more Kevin things.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1656334235.0},{"title":"A mechanic Kevin doesn't think seatbelts are needed.","author":"Abandonedkittypet","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/vlj7je\/a_mechanic_kevin_doesnt_think_seatbelts_are_needed\/","text":"So, I found this sub via rSlash, and I think my dad kinda belongs here.

He and my Aunt Meghan, Kevin\u2019s biological mom, had an amicable divorce, and she\u2019s still a part of the family and our lives. \n\nI don\u2019t know who the \u201cKevin genes\u201d were inherited from. Possibly a grandparent of Kevin\u2019s on Aunt Meghan\u2019s side? I will likely never know for sure. My cousin has always done poorly academically and clearly lacks any ounce of common sense\/critical thinking\/logical reasoning abilities. He provides examples almost daily, but none of it is really interesting enough to mention, except for him getting expelled and the bus incidents. \n\n**About our old high school:** Kevin and I attended the same high school, me graduating high school in the same year that he graduated middle school. This high school is **massive**, more than 3,000+ students when I checked recently. Kevin also took the same afterschool bus as I did, the \u201cBlue\u201d route at 3:00. On any given day there will be at least fifty kids waiting for the Blue route.\n\nTo accommodate all the students, there is a huge bus, almost twice the size of a normal school bus, that arrives to take everyone on the Blue route. Some relevant information is that there is empty space in the middle of the bus that\u2019s reserved for the main emergency exit. The ventilation\/air conditioning system is also positioned over one of the front-middle rows instead of the back.\n\n**How Kevin got suspended from the bus:** Sometimes kids will walk or have fights in the empty middle area of the bus. For whatever reason, some kids offered Kevin money to dump a party-sized bag of chips on the empty area of the bus floor, pour an entire jar of both salsa and cheese sauce on top, and then eat some of the floor nachos. Kevin did it. They offered Kevin more money to lick a can of Monster off the same dirty-ass floor. Kevin did it.\n\nKevin got in trouble for using food to \u201cvandalize school property\u201d (the bus being the school property) and got weeks of detention. He also was suspended from riding the bus and would not be allowed back on the bus until the second semester. Neither Uncle Drew nor my Aunts could be off work by that time, so our grandma would need to pick him up after school. Kevin got grounded at home too but told me he was happy that he got to keep the $60.\n\n**How Kevin got banned from the bus**: When the second semester started in January, Kevin was allowed to ride the bus again. These kids started pissing Kevin off, how or why, I don\u2019t know. But Kevin decide to solve this issue by bringing a can of Axe body spray to school and spraying people with it like pepper spray. Which, is honestly worse than pepper spray, because it\u2019s fucking Axe. He told me he would just do it out of boredom after a certain point.\n\nKevin got a few days of detention whenever he did this. The school would also send an email home to his parents. They got rid of all the Axe in the house, but Kevin would still manage to find a bottle. I\u2019m pretty sure he wasn\u2019t able to buy it at a store; I tried buying body spray recently and had to show my I.D. because apparently, the store had a problem with teenagers trying to use Axe as an inhalant. So Kevin probably bought it from kids at school.\n\nRemember I mentioned the bus\u2019s air conditioning\/ventilation system earlier? The final straw happened when Kevin got dared to spray some of his Axe into the vent system. Kevin emptied the entire can into the vents and made the entire bus **REEK** of Axe. Kids started having trouble breathing because of how thick it was. The bus driver had to pull over, make everyone get off the bus, and then call the school so they could contact everyone\u2019s parents to pick them up. \n\nKevin got in a world of shit for this, both at school and at home. He was banned from riding the bus for the rest of the year. Then when the next school year started, he would need to have a good citizenship report in order to be allowed back at all. Kevin got over a month of school detentions too. Then Kevin\u2019s parents grounded him for the rest of the school year and the entire summer. They also had him stay at our grandma\u2019s when she picked him up so that he could do all her household chores as punishment. \n\n**TLDR:** Kevin got suspended off the bus for pouring nachos and soda on the floor and then eating it. Kevin got in some more trouble for using Axe as a pepper spray. And then he finally got banned for gas bombing the bus with Axe.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1655879025.0},{"title":"Kevin meets a parking lot panel beater","author":"My_bones_are_itchy","url":"\/r\/creepyencounters\/comments\/vh3u06\/at_a_stop_light_a_guy_motioned_to_the_back_of_my\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1655810983.0},{"title":"Kevin the Barista","author":"gh0st_hat","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/vfby3v\/kevin_the_barista\/","text":"I used to work as a supervisor in a popular chain coffee shop. The baristas I supervised were most often high school or early college age and understandably didn\u2019t take the job very seriously or made mistakes because it was their first job. There were times I had to retrain or coach people. There were times I had to go to my manager because someone just wasn\u2019t picking it up. \n\nThere was only one time, however, that I unilaterally made a decision to fire someone without consulting my boss. \n\nThat was Kevin. \n\nKevin was probably between 19-21. He wasn\u2019t the brightest crayon in the box, but he was an adult who could presumably handle simple tasks. Right? \n\nWrong.\n\nI have no idea what possessed my manager to hire this guy. Kevin must have had a total alter ego in the interview because, while my boss kinda sucked, even he would never have hired anyone even a fraction as incompetent as Kevin turned out to be. \n\nKevin couldn\u2019t do even the most basic things right. It took him hours to sweep the (very small) cafe area. He didn\u2019t look at customers or talk to them. He didn\u2019t respond when they asked him questions. He didn\u2019t take orders right. I never even let him *near* the bar to make drinks. He couldn\u2019t follow simple instructions. He didn\u2019t even lift his feet when he walked and instead shuffled everywhere, very slowly, staring at the ground. He got high on his breaks (which is fine by me as long as you can still do your job. Kevin couldn\u2019t.) He made everything he did take at least 3x longer than the absolute maximum amount of time it should take. \n\nCustomers were irritated that he wouldn\u2019t even acknowledge them, wouldn\u2019t answer questions, and got their orders wrong 90% of the time. The rest of my team was irritated that they had to pick up his slack, often being slowed down even more than if he just hadn\u2019t been there. I put up with it for maybe 2 weeks before I cracked. The final straw came when I asked him to brew coffee one day. \n\nHe was on front register, since that\u2019s where he could do the least damage, so it was his duty to brew the coffee. \n\nI told him to start a fresh batch and I saw him start the machine. Later, I went to get a coffee for a customer and only water came out. Confused, I checked the brew basket to see what had happened. \n\nHe didn\u2019t grind the beans. \n\nHe put whole coffee beans in the brew basket and started the machine. \n\nI was flabbergasted. I tried to let it go and just teach him the right way. Everyone makes mistakes. Maybe he just wasn\u2019t a coffee guy and didn\u2019t know how to make it. Maybe his trainer glossed over this bit since most people know how to make coffee.\n\nI showed him, step by step, how to take a scoop of beans, put it in the grinder, run the grinder, put a filter and the coffee grounds in the brew basket, and brew the coffee. He said he understood and I moved on. \n\nThe timer went off to brew another batch so I reminded him to do it. A bit later I went to get a cup of coffee for a customer. Only water came out. \n\nHe didn\u2019t grind the beans. *Again.*\n\nDespite the step by step instructions I gave him, despite seeing the old coffee *grounds* in the brew basket when he emptied it, he refilled it with whole beans. *Again.* \n\nI couldn\u2019t have come up with another excuse for his ineptitude if my life depended on it. \n\nI went to the other barista closing with us and asked if she would be ok with it if I sent him home and we had a two-man close. She said it was fine and agreed we\u2019d be faster without him. \n\nI sent him home and texted my boss to explain what happened and told him that, while I couldn\u2019t officially fire him, he was being sent home and that he was not, under any circumstances, welcome back on my shifts. My boss formally fired him the next day.  Our two-man close took half as long as a normal close took, and a fraction of what it would have taken if Kevin had stayed.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1655576113.0},{"title":"I work with a cheap Kevina","author":"OverlyAdorable","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/venv7r\/i_work_with_a_cheap_kevina\/","text":"I work with someone who seems a little slow at times. There have been so many things she's done in the last 3 years of her working with us. She is so far only one of three people to be given an interview and not get a job offer. She constantly has to go to the doctor. If her doctor had a penny for every time she went, she'd have seen at least 2 doctors to an early retirement since starting with us. \n\nI had last week off. On my first shift back, I picked a couple bits up before my shift started and went to her till. She told me how much my shopping was I handed her my work card (discount) and she looked at me very confused and asked what store I work at. I've been there longer than she has.\n\nAround Halloween, she got an infection in her ankle. She saw a doctor who prescribed antibiotics. She forgot to take them and the infection got worse. She was signed off for 2 months because she kept starting them and then \"forgetting\" to take them when it got better and then it would get worse. \n\nAbout a month ago, Kevina fell over at work and the infection flared up and her doctor prescribed her some more antibiotics but she said she still had some from last time and took them. \n\nShe rides a moped to work. She fallen off and crashed it several times. One that made me laugh (although I do feel a little man for laughing) was the engine cut out because she forgot it needed fuel and she thought no engine means no breaks. She decided to jump off and let it come to a stop on its own. You'd have thought go to the hospital if injuries were serious enough, maybe phone of the next day but no, she went to her doctor surgery the next morning and they signed her off for a week. She's constantly off work for one injury\/sickness or another. It wouldn't surprise me if all the time she's been signed off would be more than a year in total. She can't pass her car theory test. No theory test, no actual driving test. No driving test, no driving a car on your own. She recently purchased a bench from work and asked people to not only deliver it to her house but pay her to do so because she didn't want anyone knowing where she lived. Why that would make a difference is anyone guess. Of course, everyone refused to pay and go out of their way. After two weeks of it taking up space in the break room, her sister came out to get it and the next day she was moaning that not only did we refuse to deliver something, her sister made her pay for fuel. To add to this: she once bought some Smart water. Someone she knows asked what she's getting and she said someone called her stupid so she's going to drink it in order to fix it.\n\nAbout a year or two ago, her dog died. I couldn't help but think from the get go that she was somehow to blame, whether fully or partially. Soon after, her mum was rushed to hospital. Kevina tried to get her discharged into her care. She was complaining about it to someone at work and she said \"I hate that hospital, they denied my request all because my dog recently died of what they call neglect. I don't even know what that is.\" Her tortoise (I thought it was a turtle) died recently. She was due to go on holiday a couple days later\n\nShe took her mum on holiday and met her sister and nieces there. When she got back, she said it was an incredibly boring 2 weeks and moaned non stop about it. She actually jumped in the pool at the deep end and only then remember she couldn't swim. She only took \u00a320 worth of euros (around 23\u20ac) for both her and her mum and didn't want to waste it on anything so shopping was out of the question. She bought a box of Turkish delight for work and asked people to chip in for it. I found on Facebook that she doesn't 40\u20ac on a unicorn statue and had to borrow 20\u20ac from her sister to buy it and she didn't spend anything else. Her mum had to borrow money from her other daughter. Her sister offered to pay for a few things but she said she would've wanted to be repaid. She didn't want to go to the beach or hike because she thought it was too hot, boring, and she'd probably get lost. She didn't want to drink because they only had limited free drinks and again, little money. Her phone died the first day and didn't have a charger because she was told it would need an adapter to fit the plug sockets and she didn't know where to get one (we sell them at work). There was no TV in her room and she doesn't like reading or puzzles so no books or magazines. She uploaded a video to Facebook and someone asked me to look. It was one of those in loving memory videos focusing a lot on her mum and it wasn't until her nieces appeared near the end I realised her mum hadn't died and it was about the holiday she found incredibly boring. \n\nEdit to add: a few months back, someone made a face out of blue tack and stuck it to the bottom corner of the till while Kevina was off sick. It became a known thing and people would joke about it like \"I got a little till buddy.\" I was told that, on her first day back, Kevina got upset by it, started screaming profanities on the shop floor and punched the till screen. She didn't get in trouble because, even though it was witnessed by a supervisor, they refused to believe any adult would actually react that way. The supervisor quit shortly after for being called a liar because of it and a couple of other minor reasons.\n\nWe have an app for our rota. You put appointment and holiday requests in through it. When booking time off for an appointment, it needs to be done in 24 hour format so if your son has football practice at 7pm and you want to be there for it, you need to put 19:00. It gives a reminder of this every time you go to book time off. The app automatically allows it, providing the rota for that week isn't already up and you aren't working at that time, otherwise it's up to management to decide. Management don't see it unless they try go to do that rota and it just has a dark area covering the time you have off. One day, she comes in rather angry and upset because she needed to do something at 3pm one day so requested it as an appointment but they put her in for it. I looked at the daily rota for that day (it shows who requested time off for appointments) and it turned out she ignored the reminder on the app and requested it for an hour starting at 3AM. When she resubmitted it, she put 0300 again, then 0700 because it was 7 hours after we opened, then 0060 because it was for 60 minutes, then she finally let someone help. \n\nThere are so many other things she's done over the year but these are the things that stand out","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1655493699.0},{"title":"Kevin the \u201cKevin\u201d","author":"WishIwasaHoe","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/veqqmc\/kevin_the_kevin\/","text":"I met a Kevin with \u201cKevin\u201d antics and didn\u2019t know how terrible Kevin\u2019s could be since I had grown up with a smart Kevin in elementary school. \n\nCue pandemica.

I would have to ask him EACH TIME as well as explain how many feet\/ where to place his feet to get out of my way (kitchen space was incredibly small in my ex\u2019s place)\n2) Kevin would ask why I was not cooking the rice in a rice cooker (he\u2019s been at my exs place for over years and KNOWS ex doesn\u2019t have a rice cooker)\n3) Kevin would keep watching how I cook over my shoulders and say \u201cthat\u2019s not how my mom does it\u201d (Kevin has never cooked & I came from immigrant parents that made me learn early)\n4) Kevin would ask for food after criticizing how I had been cooking the whole 1-2 hours and even after I said I only intended the cooking for 2-3 portions so ex would have leftovers for work tomorrow. But he would take half the pot of food. \n5) Kevin was half Japanese (mother was incredibly Fluent and the stereotypical cute Asian mom) and he would wear shoes in the house\/ on carpet, say he eats\/love sushi but actually could only eat California rolls, and didn\u2019t know that rice gets scooped on the plate first before pouring the curry on top\n6) Kevin asked why get plates when I asked him to help serve the Japanese curry and why put rice on before the curry (I refused to believe he was any bit Japanese after this)\n7) Kevin asked \u201cHow?\u201d when I asked him \u201cCan you please remove the chicken from the skewers into a bowl?\u201d I literally said \u201cumm.. with clean hands. Maybe wear disposable gloves and wait for it to not be too hot to the touch??\u201d He still hurt himself a bit bc I heard him say \u201cOUCH\u201d while removing the tray of chicken skewers from the oven WITHOUT oven mits. \n8) Kevin said my pasta was surprisingly good even though I \u201cput weird stuff in it\u201d (the \u2018weird stuff\u2019 was basic seasonings and garnishes like oregano, basil, and parsley). \n9) Kevin refused to play card games bc they either were \u201ctoo hard\u201d or \u201ceveryone else is way more experienced than him\u201d. We were trying to play Go Fish. \n10) Kevin cut off jet skis when I told him the only rules on the water he needs to look out for his other jet skis and boats, staying on the right, and rocks. After doing so he said \u201cwow those people need to be careful. We\u2019re really close to rocks too.\u201d \n11) Kevin refused to apologize for a list of things I told him were troubling to me bc it was disrespectful to my traditional Asian parents who need basic manners & thanks bc \u201che never did anything wrong and doesn\u2019t say sorry unless he\u2019s truly sorry which he is not\u201d. And only called back to say \u201cI\u2019m saying sorry bc [your ex] called me and I don\u2019t want to get cut off from jet skiing.\u201d\n12) Kevin quit his job bc he thought that would make him gf come back to him after she broke it off (in his defense she first said it was bc Covid and he worked a risky job seeing so many ppl\/day. But later she talked to him again and said she just didn\u2019t see a future with him. But he still thought it was bc of the Covid thing and quit working to prove how Covid safe he was.) Hid ex gf tried to tell him to go back to work and the store was willing to take him back but he said no. \n13) Kevin finished EMT classes and didn\u2019t know what HIPAA was when I referenced it in a sentence\/story. Kevin wanted to become a firefighter. \n14) Kevin didn\u2019t study for his nremt bc studying was boring. And still didn\u2019t understand why he failed 2x. Then gave up bc \u201cit was too hard.\u201d\n15) Kevin wanted to travel when he heard how fun traveling was and thought the only thing holding him back was friends not inviting him. He didn\u2019t have a passport and didn\u2019t want to do airbnbs or hostels. And couldn\u2019t afford hotels unless his mom paid. \n16) Kevin didn\u2019t know how to book anything. Not even schedule his nremt exam. \n17) Kevin was 26-27 yo throughout all of this and said most college grads were morons. He was a dropout and his younger sister was in an mba Program. \n18) Kevin wanted to get a dog but said \u201conly thing holding me back is my mom\/moving out I guess\u201d (and this was when Kevin was jobless)\n19) Kevin told everyone He bought both his R6 and bmw so ppl need to Become financially independent too. Kevin lived at home rent free. And his dad had purchased everything so Kevin could make monthly payments to his dad at 0% interest. \n20) Kevin knew what time we scheduled lunch (12pm) but still ate before\u201dbecause he got hungry\u201d so he ended up refusing to eat because he was full. Turns out he was scared my mother would cook \u201cweird Asian food.\u201d It was burgers. Everyone including Kevin, Kevin\u2019s gf, etc knew it was burgers. We had all discussed for 2 weeks for it to be burgers so Kevin could be included. \n\n\nKevin was basically a cushy kid that never experienced hard consequences in life. And had no malice or Ill-will. But he was a 100% Kevin.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1655501796.0},{"title":"My bestfriend named kevin","author":"InvestmentFar1944","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/ve1wq4\/my_bestfriend_named_kevin\/","text":"Oh god, how do I start this,  \nI've been listening to a lot of r\/ (If your read this hey!) and realized my best friend was a Kevin.

He doesn't go to his classes and goofs off with his friends. Stupid college kid stuff, but this story goes above and beyond.\n\nSo Kevin is an alcoholic who buys beer for all his friends. All of them are underage. Every time my stepbrother sees alcohol in the room, he will report it. And yet, Kevin decided to brag to my stepbrother about his fake ID. So he reported that, too. Campus security took away his fake ID. He bought another one and told my stepbrother again. But before he could report it... the story starts.\n\nSo my stepbrother gets home to his dorm at around 6pm, and immediately goes to sleep, as he didn't sleep last night. Kevin decides this is the perfect time to throw a party. Apparently the booze stores were still accepting his fake, so he gets multiple cases of beer and some hard liquor and turns the entire floor into a party room. Since the party was mostly outside of my stepbrother's dorm, he slept through the whole thing. \n\nThat is until, at 2am, campus security barges through the door.  My stepbrother answers the door. They get pissed and accuse my stepbrother of getting drunk and throwing the party. Since he slept through it all he wasn't able to defend himself, until Kevin comes through clearly drunk and yelling \"it wasn't my fault! it wasn't my fault\"! But, then campus security drops the bombshell: Kevin had brought a girl into the room, and she *somehow* got so drunk, she was in the hospital and unlikely to make it. Kevin tries to defend himself, but is drunk, so he ends up admitting to the fake ID instead. They breathalyze both people, Kevin is drunk, my stepbrother blows a 0.00. \n\nLuckily, the girl survived, but everyone in the room got in trouble, even though none of the other people were involved, likely because they wanted to dodge liability. Kevin then bragged about getting a *third* fake ID. Luckily, my stepbrother got a room change.

I found a place (condo with own two patios, 1.5 bathroom and both washer and dryer) where we could each pay $700 per room. She complained that that was expensive. Keep in mind, this is with me and other roomie driving her everywhere and her taking the bus with her bus pass (free for students). \n\nNeither had paying jobs throughout college, but neither seemed THAT rich to me until we lived together. Neither of them knew how to properly wash, dry, and store dishes (or food). Neither knew how to clean up after themselves. \n\n2Kevin left fruit in a cabinet and went abroad for the summer. Fruit flymageddon. I dealt with this on my own, I cleaned the apartment on my own (landlords did not clean), and I moved most of our stuff in on my own as they both immediately left for abroad (back home). \n\nKevin acquired annoying boyfriend literally named Kyle who was around all the time and also did not clean up after himself. \n\n2Kevin's sister (after I asked her not to smoke cigarettes on our patio) used the dry leaf pile i had swept to the side as an ash tray.

Crime was crack, he had no impulse control. His career as a juvenile offender escalated until he went up in front of a diversion panel, the last step before institutionalisation. Hopefully his now adult mind has been able to do more risk assessment so at least his crimes are worth getting caught for. On the whole he reminded me of Alex from a Clockwork Orange, a hefty prison sentence on the lookout for a warm body to settle on.\n\nKevin and his mate went out exploring and found an air compressor on a building site. They gave it a damn good vandalising and then set off. Later he heard their descriptions over police radio on his scanner. You'd think this might be a hint to stop at this point, but then you'd probably question the point of vandalising an air compressor anyway. \n\nKevin liked his recreational drugs, and heard about an interesting quirk; if you were busted for cannabis and the police took your metal drugs pipe they were obliged to give it back, cleaned of resin. He became obsessed with this, questioning the method of cleaning they used -- was it some form of dip that ate away the tar, or possibly a uniformed police officer set to with a pipe cleaner over several hours to give you the best possible result before giving it back to you? Despite there being no evidence of this ever having happened or any kind of source for this interesting factoid, Kevin persisted with this belief in the face of literally everyone telling him it wasn't a thing. \n\nKevin's even more Kevinoid mate got a car (impressed he could pass the exam) while still being a high school student. Soon a posse of Kevins and a Kevina drove throughout the night, helping out here and there, wherever they were needed. One of their targets was an amusing sweet dispensing vending machine outside a shop, which Kevina pressured the others into stealing. As per the adventure of the air compressor, what the purpose was escapes me. \n\nThe other was a suburban petrol station, closed after hours. The mighty crowd of Kevins broke in, finding the till empty and filling their pockets with sweets. Knocking off small businesses for tobacco products is a common crime 'round here, this was more dickhead kids stealing chips and chocolates. Kevin was interested in computers and tried to steal the terminal for the financial network, not that I imagine this was going to actually go anywhere. They rode off into the night triumphant, fatter, dumber, and leaving some guy a huge repair bill. \n\nThe next night started out well with the Kevins and Kevina gathering in the car for another night of spreading joy, only for the Kevinoid driver to announce their mission; the same petrol station. Even Kevin, carried away with the romance of crime, realised the extreme juvenile detention peril this was putting them in. He pleaded with them to turn back and finally put his foot down, they let him out a block before the target. The ship of fools continued, directly into the police's hands. One block wasn't far enough for Kevin, to his dismay he found himself face to face with a policeman lookout standing in the shadows exactly where he was let off. \n\nSo they got busted, again. Between the legal troubles and fees the Kevinoid experiment in having a car and renting a flat with other Kevins was abandoned and they moved back with their families, good thing too.

There was small town party evening, and Kevina was not sure what to drink, so she mixed coke with beer, basing on what other people was drinking. Swapping that two mostly for whole evening, as there was not much of a choice. This was the grave mistake she was aware of and warned about, but hoped that it wouldn't turn out that bad. But it did. As she described later, after few hours she felt her stomach rumble, but wanted to stay there with friends, still hoping it would not turn out to be that bad. That hope didn't let her go even at time she couldn't stand and dance. She stayed until early morning hours, it was so long, that her pain let go for most part, probably because she got drunk from strong shots she took after. As we walked to friends place to stay overnight, the delivery moved on, as her pain in belly and memory of what she ingested moved away. This Kevina used to fart in presence of good friends, often, so she proceed to release as usual, but this time it went terribly wrong... She just stopped all of sudden, and screamed something like \"HEeEeEee!\" standing convulsively, like if she stepped on lego and got frozen in that instance. At that time I looked at her, the shit was just pouring out of her tight shorts, from all exits that this small peace of clothing has. That unstoppable stream was so powerful that it was going up to her back too. She shat literally all her clothing, including shoes she had on her. She said later that even the bra got hit, probably as she was taking the shirt down. Well at that moment we could help ourselves and bursted to laughter so intensive that we fell from foot. There was just way to hold it. It was so intensive and spontaneous, that Kevina started laughing too, couldn't help herself when she saw us twitching on the ground, which resulted in even more of it coming out of her. She was probably crying too, laughing, crying and shitting herself at same time. Luckily, it was in early morning hours so no one saw, and near our good helping friend's sleepover place that we where going to. She choose to help Kevina best she can, by taking care of evidence. They threw it in washing machine. But this wasn't just bad coincidence, and collision of poor Kevina with existence, this was not any ordinary shit happend, this was curse, original hex from Satan himself specifically designed for Kevin type of beings, and that clusterfuck curse just hited us along, including that washing machine. As if it has radius of hit by flying clusterfuckups around Kevina. That damned thing just stopped, full of that shitty water, clogged filter, on and off is no use, only takes up more water. I fell to Kevin's curse too, and wasn't able to even find where that filter opening is. The sun was about to get up, and so will friends parents, there was no way to cover it up all in time now. We had to change a plan. 1. Clean the washing machine. 2 burry that clothes beneath garbage, in container outside. 3. Make a cover up story for Kevina's parents where are her clothes. 2out of 3, it worked. Friend's parents didn't found out that it was the shit that clogged the washing machine filter, they fell to theory they came up with, that it was mess that accumulated over time, as it was never been cleared. But Kevina didn't managed to lie. She confessed when her parents pressed on her, because she used to lie when she fucked up something, and wasn't good at it. Thanks God Kevina's and friends parents who owned that house and washing machine where not in contact. \n\n\n\nThis would be pretty much boring life if there where no Kevins and Kevinas.

Presumably because the students are out and most people seem to think that the pandemic is over despite rising case counts, now they can have more conferences. \n\nAmong these is apparently a Kevin conference. Within the past few days:\n\n* I watched someone grab onto the push bar of a door, then start pulling on it with all their might - and spend several minutes trying to pull a \"Push\" door. open. The sad thing is, this isn't even the first time I've seen people do this here... \n* Someone called to ask about placing an order at the sandwich place. There's an app that can let you place remote orders - as well as GrubHub. When he asked how he knew it would be this particular store, I told him *three times* that the apps usually told you the location of the store. He *still* didn't understand that apps typically let you select which store to place the order at.\n* Said person also asked \"You take credit cards, right?\" and was shocked to find that yes, a store that exists in the year 2022 does in fact take credit card payments. \n* Someone was told to go across the street to the building that was literally in plain view of the door. They got lost. This wasn't a kid, ftr. \n* Someone asked what kind of meat comes on the Turkey. \n* A teenaged Kevin tried to steal a \"Wet floor\" sign. In front of employees. When confronted, they said \"it's mine\". \n* A Kevin was playing TikTok videos with his phone on full blast. When asked to turn the volume on his phone down, he said \"That's not *my* phone\". Even when there were videos *playing on his phone*, *Right there in front of us*, he said \"How do you know it's not *your* phone playing that loud music?\" \n* A Kevin stood *right in front* of a doorway and vaped.

For those of you who don't know Donald yet, let me introduce you. Donald is my brother, and probably the biggest Kevin that I know of. He is a good guy, he just does endless amounts of stupid stuff. Today's post will be about his latest and greatest idea, a TV show.\n\nSo earlier today Donald asked me if I would watch the first episode of his new TV show for him before he sends it in to try to get it aired. I reluctantly agreed knowing that this was going to be bad. \n\nThe first problem that I see is the name of his show. He has decided to call it \"Harry's haunted houses\" which isn't necessarily the worst name ever, (not that it is great) except for the fact that we don't even know anyone who is named Harry. When I mentioned this to him he just said \"that's not important, it's catchy.\"\n\nThe second problem is that he filmed it on a camera from the 80s \"for a more spooky feeling\" he says. He has a better camera, he just didn't use it.\n\nThe show starts with a random minute and a half of footage of a heavy metal band on stage screaming their heads off and throwing their hair around, and then it randomly cuts to a view of Donald's face from about 2 inches away, and he whispers into the camera \"haunted house.\" And that is the intro.\n\nThe episode starts with him sitting across a table from a married couple. The wife is crying and the husband says \"yeah, she gets like this when our house gets haunted sometimes\" and then Donald responds \"Its ok mam, I'm an expert, my grandfather is dead.\" This seems to completely deal with all of her worries and she immediately starts thanking Donald.\n\nIt then cuts to him walking through the couple's house with the husband. As they walk, Donald taps on random things and then looks at the man to tell him if that specific object is haunted or not. After about 2 minutes of him tapping on random things and saying that they are definitely all very haunted, he looks at the guy all wide eyed and just screams \"I SMELL FISH!!! DID YOU COOK FISH?!?!\" The husband, acting extremely afraid, replies \"no, is that bad?\" Donald then calmly replies \"exceptionally\" and then they start running around as fast as they can with no explanation as to why.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes of them running around, they somehow end up in what seems to be the home's living area, blankly staring into a wall. You then see the camera man toss a doorknob onto the ground. You could literally see his hand as he tosses it, but they didn't bother to edit that out. Donald hears the doorknob hit the ground, whips around, looks at it like he has never seen a doorknob before I his life, and then whispers to the husband \"we are definitely going to need better technology for this one.\" \n\nThe next scene is of Donald randomly swinging a baseball bat around. He does this for about 30 seconds in each and every room of the house, and then tells the couple that the ghosts are pretty damn afraid now and they might not come back, and if they do, to call him. He then winks at the camera and the credits roll which was only four names.\nI didn't have the heart to tell him that it wasn't good, I guess that that will be the job of whatever TV station that he decides to send it to.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1654107283.0},{"title":"Part 5 of my girlfriend\u2019s sister being a Kevin","author":"desk2118","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/v2h6v5\/part_5_of_my_girlfriends_sister_being_a_kevin\/","text":"\nAnother month and my (18m) girlfriend\u2019s (19f), sister (15f) is continuing to be as Kevin as ever. She just turned 15, meaning she somehow made it another year on Earth. Sadly, she hasn\u2019t gotten any smarter with the new year. Here is part 5 of dumb things she did, this months list is a doozy, now that college is over for the summer I\u2019ll also be spending more time with my gfs family \n\n122. On her birthday she asked what would happen if we put the candles in the fireplace instead of using the \u201cfire stick\u201d (she meant lighter)\n\n123. She went on some weird rant about how furries are going into schools and trying to use litter boxes in the bathrooms, I don\u2019t even want to know where she read that\n\n124. As I have mentioned before, her boyfriend likes game shows, he was watching Blockbusters, a game show that uses hexagons on letters, when she saw the hexagons she called them \u201cstop sign shape letters\u201d\n\n125. She believed a rumor that a girl she knew was pregnant, the girl is openly transgender\n\n126. She almost got stuck in one of those swings for little children after swinging in it, she was all by herself, she was thankfully able to get out\n\n127. We went to Taco Bell the day me and my girlfriend came home from college, and she challenged her boyfriend to eat more then her, he\u2019s an athlete who\u2019s quite a bit bigger then her, she complained about stomach pains after losing her bet to her boyfriend \n\n128. She genuinely thought Elon Musk was African-American because \u201che was born in Africa but converted to being an American\u201d\n\n129. She was caught by her brother trying to dry grapes with a towel, when asked why she said she wanted to make raisins \n\n130. She asked if we thought Joe Biden was a clone because she saw an article on it and wanted to know our thoughts, we were able to convince her he wasn\u2019t \n\n131. After learning about the Milky Way in astronomy class, she asked why they would name a galaxy after a candy bar\n\n132. She said a civil war \u201cwouldn\u2019t be a big deal because we were fine after the last one\u201d\n\n133. One of her boyfriend\u2019s teammates has a younger brother who is 12, he\u2019s very flamboyant, wears makeup, drinks iced coffee, ect, basically every gay stereotype. She asked him if he had a girlfriend, when he told her he was gay she said that she had no idea. \n\n134. She\u2019s friends with a girl in her grade who has a twin brother, the boy also goes to their school, and is in their grade, and he likes to collect antique weapons, he has firearms from like the 1800s and before, not regulated by government due to them being antiques, but he\u2019s not into shooting really anyways, only does it a few times a year at a gun range with modern guns, his family are not gun owners, when she went his room and saw them, she asked if she could try one out, the boy explained they were for display and he liked history, it\u2019s terrifying to think of her with a weapon\n\n135. Her younger brother is gay, and he told her that gay people used rainbow condoms  and that normal condoms didn\u2019t when they had sex, and she believed it, and she was asking a gay friend about it and he recorded it and posted it on Snapchat because he was so confused by her behavior \n\n136. She\u2019s always been into \u201calternative media\u201d, her boyfriend has usually pushed back on her conspiracies but didn\u2019t care much about the actual content she was watching until he caught her watching Nick Fuentes, an alt-right content creator, she said he couldn\u2019t be a white supremacist because he\u2019s part Latino, he told her he didn\u2019t want her watching him anymore and she agreed \n\n137. Me and my girlfriend were in the driveway coming home from picking up a rare book my little brother had ordered, she ran to the car with her thumb all black, she saw a TikTok about sticking a key in an outlet and decided it was a good idea, luckily she didn\u2019t get severely electrocuted but we wonder why the hell she thought that was a good idea\n  \n\nThis is more stuff from the past that was just remembered recently \n\n138. She used to run into glass doors frequently as a child, hasn\u2019t happened in a few years \n\n139. About a year ago, she had a male friend who wanted to buy some racy magazines, which you had to be 18 to buy, he was 13, she thought it would be a good idea to have him go on with a fake beard and try again, they could tell it was fake and told him to come back with a parent if he really wanted the magazines, he eventually got his older brother (who was 18 at the time) to get them, she wondered why a gay man would by magazines of racy women when she knew it was for her straight friend \n\n140. A few months ago she asked her boyfriend what plastic surgery she should get, he got very defensive and said \u201cwhy do you need plastic surgery? you\u2019re the hottest girl I\u2019ve ever met\u201d and she said because she saw BBLs and lip fillers on TikTok and \u201cif celebrities do it it clearly means it makes you prettier\u201d, he reassured her on her looks and told her how attractive she was, kinda sweet cause you could tell how genuine he was \n\n141. She said that she wanted to try what Coca Cola tasted like before they took out the cocaine\n\n142. A few months ago she had a hickey and when her parents asked her about it, she said she fell off the bed and got it, her parents called her out and she admitted it was from her boyfriend and they told her they weren\u2019t mad because a lot of teens get hickeys and it\u2019s fairly normal \n\n143.  A few months ago, she was at the mall, her boyfriend was in the Nike store and she went to go see him, she was playing with the shoe boxes and a bunch fell on her\n\n144. She said that autism was caused by milk and vaccines once\n\n145. She once accidentally was chocking herself with a drawstring bag\n\nThat\u2019s all I have for May, happy she made it to 15 but also wondering how.

We met while working at the golden arches while in high school. He was, special. There are many stories but these are the two I have fond recollections of. \n\nThe first one, where Kevin blows himself up. His family used to own a small tire shop in town and we\u2019d work on cars there at night when it was closed. We show up and pull our cars in to the bays and close the doors. It was cold that night and the bays aren\u2019t heated. He was looking around for some wood and paper to put in to the 55 gallon metal barrel we\u2019d use to burn stuff in to heat the area. I was talking to his dad about some stuff, probably football, when Kevin came in to the office and asked where that day\u2019s newspapers were. He pointed to a box beside the door labled \u201dOld Newspapers\u201d. They are there everyday.\n\nOne thing to note is that it\u2019s been raining and the shop\u2019s roof has been leaking so the barrel has been used to catch water. Kevin puts some pieces of wood from a chopped up pallet in to the barrel, the bottom inch has water in it and has been soaked up by ash and some trash from previous burns. Kevin takes a lighter and lights the newspaper on fire and tosses it in the barrel. Nothing happens. He repeats a few more times and gets it to start smoking. It might be on fire, or might not. \n\nMyself and Kevin\u2019s dad are watching this and laughing about how he should have just tryed to light the top of the pallet wood first. Kevin then disappears behind the wall of tires  to get to the storage area. He comes out holding a metal can used to fill the kerosene office heater. His dad starts slapping me on the chest saying, \u201dWatch this, watch this, this is going to be good!\u201d He seemed enthusiastic. So I watched.\n\nI watched Kevin lean over the barrel and pour kerosene into the barrel. He must\u2019ve had a small fire going because it shot a big ball of fire out of the top, it was a quick flash but looked big. Kevin\u2019s face was right in it. He falls back on to his butt. Me and his dad walk out to see how badly he hurt himself. He got some 1st and 2nd degree burns obviously. He wore is hat on backwards and burned off all the hair sticking out of it and around it, he had a hat shaped burn on his forehead where his hair used to be. His eyebrows and eyelashes were singed off along with any facial hair he had, which wasn\u2019t much.  He looked shocked and you could tell he was trying to figure out what happend. \n\nHis dad hands him some burn cream and says the funniest thing at the time to Kevin, \u201cThis is the 3rd time you\u2019ve done this, how many more is it going to take for you to learn not to pour flammable liquids on a fire?\u201d I kept thinking, \u201c3rd time\u2026\u201d It took 4 times, there was a bonfire.  \n\nWe drifted apart a few years later and have crossed paths over the years, not much has changed.

He wasn\u2019t evil, just plain idiot and kinda naiive with a splash of inappropriate behaviour towards 30 years younger tenant, me. This happened about 10 years ago, I was young and stupid. \n\nIn my last two posts I consentrated to his lack of skills and way too high selftrust to fix piping and waterproofing. This post is about his behaviour. \n\nHe was touchy(not grabby type, he patted butts and backs, gross I know), liked to compliment young girls looks and kept it appropriate if the girl was underage. I was 18-19 yo when he got honestly worried if I get laid often enough. My boyfriend at the time visited only once a week due me being a side piece(I didn\u2019t know) and landlord was sad the guy obviously didn\u2019t love me enough. \nHis friend was the first to wink at me that the landlord could fix the problem and visit instead. I frowned and removed myself from the yard so to not to hear any more idiotic ideas. \nAfter that the landlord started slight harrasment, which was a big part in the chaos for me to move out, aside from the salamanders, sewege water from ceiling and mushrooms on basement floor. After a few compliments about my lingerie among my laundry I never took them to dry outside, where he could possibly see them. \n\nOne evening only weeks before I moved out I had a friend visiting. It was past 8pm  and door was locked. Then we heard the door open and my landlord came in without any warning with his own keyes. I was on my pj ready to ho to sleep right when my friend would leave. \nHe said he\u2019d came to fix the insulation problem in one of the rooms. He was baffled I told him to leave, it was late and I was going to sleep. \nMy friend left after my landlord left. Half an hour later landlords wife called me. \n\n\u2019I heard you didn\u2019t let him fix the insulation?\u2019 She asked. \n\u2019Yeah, he came after 8 pm with his own key, without a warning and I have early morning at work.\u2019 I answered. \n\u2019Oh, I see\u2019 she said and sounded negatively lightened. \u2019Well good night, he will behave better from now on.\u2019\nI guess my landlord got a talking to, as he broke at least two laws coming in that evening. \n\nReading my own posts, no wonder I got anxiety and paranoid seasons during my depression after living there 5 years. \n\nThe insulation problem? Downstairs bedroom insulation was done wrong and heaters hadn\u2019t work in a few years(I asked him to fix them plenty of times), I lost 80% of my potted plants as the room went from 10 to -8 celcius during one winter night. He had no idea why, it was only -30 outside. No heat, corner room with big windows on two walls, messed up insulation and he had no idea why the room froze as \u2019It\u2019s inside the house. \u2019 \nDude, inside isn\u2019t warm during winter without heating.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1653605244.0},{"title":"\"Nurse\" Kevina almost sabotages house purchase by buying a bag but it still goes through.

His wife was smart, pretty and a nice person and I really regret not having her as the person to call when something broke. \n\nLike a fireplace in the sauna. I begged a proper fireplace for 4 years, but as the landlords dad had made it by hinself, there couldn\u2019t be anything wrong with it.

I didn\u2019t get out of the hot sauna for about half an hour, waiting the cover to cool down enough to move or step on. He finally bought a legally certified fireplace. \n\nNext there was yet another water problem of which gravity he didn\u2019t understand. The sauna and shower were in the second floor, when kitchen was on the first floor, this is important. \nOne day I noticed water dripping from the ceiling right on top of the oven(fire kind, not electric) right after I took a shower, and once again I went to talk with the landlord. \nHe said it\u2019s just rainwater so nothing serious.

Being the smart one in their relationship, she said \u201cno\u201d for obvious reasons. D spent roughly 5 minutes negging his girlfriend to do it. Now, something I should mention is that D is one of those people who prefers to learn by experience. He\u2019s always been this way and never heeds warnings when an obvious bad idea is obvious. Since he\u2019s 23 now, me and the rest of my siblings have basically accepted that that\u2019s how he is and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. Believe me, we tried talking him out of obvious bad ideas before and he ends up doing them anyway. For example, we wanted to have a bonfire and he thought it would be a good idea to light a lighter in the spot we poured the fuel instead of lighting wood and tossing it on top of it. Anyways, D\u2019s girlfriend realized that the only way to get D off the topic was to give him what he wanted, so the two went outside and she sprayed him in the face with her pepper spray. He felt fine at first and took this as undeniable proof that mace didn\u2019t actually work and went back inside. Then D fell to the floor screaming about his eyes burning. He ran into the kitchen and tried to wash his eyes out with milk only to realize it wasn\u2019t very effective. So, he took an unopened gallon of milk (roughly 3.74 liters for those outside of the US) and ran faster than Speedy Gonzalez into the bathroom. His girlfriend is saying she told him so and he ends up taking a shower while simultaneously pouring the entire gallon of milk on his face. When he got out of the shower, he spent the next couple minutes blaming his girlfriend for his current state. Then he called everyone in his contact list and told them \u201cmy girlfriend maced me\u201d. She spent the night at her mother\u2019s for the next few days","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1653499655.0},{"title":"My landlord who could do no wrong","author":"No_Syllabub_4264","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/uxmtpr\/my_landlord_who_could_do_no_wrong\/","text":"I\u2019ve been wondering quite long on where to post about my first landlord, and suddenly figured that he might be a Kevin. \n\nFor exmple, he was renting his farmhall to a tractor\/farming machinery reseller and kept his own on sale tractors in there too. Someone wanted to buy his tractor, but there was something wrong with with it. Landlord fixed it with a couple of beercans placed in a right place, and was baffled when the buyer returned the tractor after first drive wanting a refund, as he thought the cans were easier to get than the real part, could last a day and were cheap to replace so he didn\u2019t know what the issue was. Don\u2019t ask what part he replaced, I only know something was too loose and he tightened it with the cans, which were perfect size filler until they were crushed within the first meters and fell of within the first kilometer. Something to do with the tires I recall. \n\nSo the issues with me. In my country it\u2019s mandatory that the tapwater in every house or building must be drinkable. It\u2019s in the law. I didn\u2019t know, I was a teen and in my first ever rental outside of studentapartment provided by my college. \nThe first two years I was mysteriously ill with a stomack bug quite often. I also was frustrated with low waterpressure. \nThen my kitchen tap got clugged and I opened the head of it. It was full of hair. I had lived in rutal areas long enough to see it was from some sort of rodent. \nI started to boil water and my mysterious illness was cured. I told my landlord, but he was cincerely dumbfounded that the rathair, yes it was rats, was a problem. My friend came to inspect, took us a while to find the well and the concrete cover was broken. Two half rotten rats were floating in the water\u2026\n\nAnd landlords reaction when told?\n\u2019Gosh your a tough girl as you can live in a place like this!\u2019 With honest respect in his voice. The well never got fixed, but during third year he paid to install nearby citys water pipes to the property. \n\nThe the wall. Before I moved in my friend lived there, didn\u2019t warn me beforehand about the house, but later shared me that the walls inside the house were made with the soft plastic carpet you use to make flooring. Behind it was styrofoam pieces stuck like a jiggsawpuzzle, not neatly nor well put. I live in the northern hemisphere, where good insulation is everything. My landlord had been supprised when one day the flooring carpet, that wasn\u2019t well enough secured, just fell and the styrofoam pieces with it. He was so sure it was perfect, he had made it himself. \n\nHis motto seemed to be \u2019It can\u2019t fail, I made it myself!\u2019 And whatever he made, was sure to fail. \n\nI lived there full 5 years, and yes I know I was stupid. Still wondering where to post the rest of my stories from that house, which aren\u2019t this harmless. \n\nIf I\u2019m wrong and this guy isn\u2019t a Kevin, please tell me what he is and I\u2019ll post in better suited sub.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1653500758.0},{"title":"Kevina, company director","author":"Tramin","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/uxb4sb\/kevina_company_director\/","text":"Joe was a school mate who'd left without any qualifications or plans. At a loose end he was offered the lowest rung in the computer shop his \"aunt\" Kevina worked at. He'd been raised by a single mother and had an extended crowd of honorary aunts, a common arrangement as I understand it, but Kevina was special; dumb, incompetent and highly entitled. As such she wasn't really capable of any position at the shop but they found a special niche for her; signing the directorship papers. For those who don't know what that means, she was now liable for the company with zero benefit; all the responsibility, none of the power. \n\nSo, surprisingly, it was a scam. A really obvious one too, say the shop was called DumbFuckSignsPapers Computers, one of the employees who had a brain did a corporate search and found the owner's immediate previous shop was Computers DumbFuckSignsPapers. Joe's first sign of trouble was invoices not being paid, then a staff meeting where they were told the shop was being wound up as some supplier was being unreasonable in wanting to get paid, then the offer of cash in hand to help do a midnight flit. He showed up at the site and carried stock onto a truck, retuned for a second shift only to find lawyers and the Sherriff but escaped when they weren't looking and caught a bus home.\n\n\"Aunt\" Kevina was soon raked over the coals, no tax had ever been paid, there wasn't just one creditor. Her only defence was to give the lawyers Joe's name. From gofer to Machiavellian mastermind! So he was duly deposed, with the statement running into tens of pages. He did get to find out her reasoning in the whole liability issue; apparently the owner had a thing called an \"Ex-\", so of course he couldn't possibly place the business in his own name!\n\nSo, she was destitute and threw herself upon the mercy of the state for emergency housing for herself and her kid. Being Kevina her preferences were the central business district and the most expensive leafy suburbs. Being resident in this particular reality, emergency housing was a remote hole in the ground. Things didn't work out and after a spell in the rental market Joe returned to the family home only to find Kevina and the kid were now also resident there, with the kid having trashed up Joe's room good and proper. \n\nKevina, the gift that keeps on giving.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1653459884.0},{"title":"Kevin Crockett, king of the wild frontier\u2026","author":"GrunthosArmpit42","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/uwzuqv\/kevin_crockett_king_of_the_wild_frontier\/","text":"Edit: Sorry, it\u2019s a long one. Good luck with it. There\u2019s no TL;DR lol \n\nI\u2019m posting here because of a recent related post and there was some interest in a comment I made on it.    \n\nOk so let\u2019s paint a picture first.     \nThis Kevin and I made friends years before this story. He fancied himself as an anarcho-punk with gutterpunk sympathies.    \nThis was in the early aughts.    \nThis was in my dirtbag days (aka kind of voluntarily homeless) living outside mostly due to some existential issues, one might call it a walkabout (not sure if PC but it\u2019s a word) for lack of a better term.     \nWe met at a \u201cpunk house\u201d for a show and he called me a conformist.     \nHe said I looked like a construction worker because I was too clean.     \nI pointed out that I was the only one in the room that looked obviously different and the working man\/proletariat is a common theme in punk. Hmm, checkmate?    \nThis made Kevin confused. We hung out fairly often afterwards.      \n\nFast forward, so I leave again to travel to sort out whatever, and come back years later with my now, but unintentionally met, yet awesome SO in a very legally binding sense, and we get in touch with Kevin. I ask if he has any clue about a place for rent. He does. It\u2019s one room where he\u2019s currently living at the time.    \nNeat. Sounds good. Cheers!    \n\nSide note:     \nHe had had the same dog for ages. We\u2019ll call him Leeroy.     \nTurns out Kevin buys loaves of what I call Bunny bread, or gingham dress white girl bread several times a week, because Leeroy steals it off the counter religiously. Like every g\u2019damn time.     \nI buy a breadbox at goodwill for $3 and explain how it works as a gift\u2026 to me, to avoid the inevitable chaos of him yelling, \u201cCome here Leeroy! Drop the the damn bread!\u201d And then chasing him around pointlessly.     \nLeeroy has zero recall training.     \nLeeroy\u2019s theme song is the outro to \u201cKilling in the Name of\u201d by RATM.    \nI\u2019ve got a cabinet for my dry goods in the house that\u2019s to be ignored by the roommates so it\u2019s not my problem, but it kind of is.    \nI also explain butter is more shelf-stable than what he\u2019s been led to believe, and what a butter dish is, and to please stop putting my half stick of butter in the fridge every g\u2019damn day.       \nIt makes making toast a pain in the A.     \nThis is a revelation to Kevin.     \n\nKevin insisted on shaking peoples hands when they enter the apartment in some strange genteel southern aristocracy kind of way despite knowing full well this makes Leeroy angry and bite the guest.     \nHe thinks it\u2019s rude to be impolite. I say it\u2019s rude to let your dog bite people and risk your dog getting put on doggy death row.     \nThis is a revelation to Kevin.    \n\nBackstory:     \nIf I go camping in a group I\u2019m normally the guy that has a multi-tool, some random length of p-cord (550) or whatever.   \nI don\u2019t harangue people or gatekeep \u201creal\u201d camping or whatever. Those people are obnoxious. I try not to be that person.   \nThat said\u2026    \nI was raised by a weird military dude and was taught orienteering and other survivalist things as a kid. Not something I desired to do, or I bring up in conversation or use as an identity, but it happened.         \nI\u2019m no SurvivorMan or anything, but I\u2019ve defo been dropped off in the woods with a lensatic compass, an analog wristwatch, a shitty map, a canteen, and a buck knife and was told to find my way to the truck on the other side. Thanks, dad?     \nI don\u2019t bring this info up casually unless you\u2019re my therapist.      \nThis will be relevant\u2026    \n\nHere we go\u2026     \n\n>\t\u201cI ain\u2019t never been lost, but I\u2019ll admit to being real confused for several days.\u201d\n-Daniel Boone, probably\u2026\n\nSo months go by with Kevin in our apartment and Old Man Winter had come\u2026 all over the face of Mother Earth in our specific geographic location.    \nKevin walks into the common room of the apartment while I\u2019m watching some some reality cooking show with our other roommate, and Kevin asks me and my SO if we\u2019d like to go on an overnight winter camping trip for the long weekend that he has been doing annually with his HS buddy and their girlfriend\u2026 for years.       \nHe\u2019s really excited about this.      \n\nMy inner voice is quietly whispering in Bartleby the Scrivener\u2019s voice \u201cI\u2019d prefer not to.\u201d     \nThing is, houses are nice, but I digress.    \n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun\u201d, they said. \u201cWe have a cabin in the woods and everything. It\u2019s only a few mile hike,\u201d they said.      \n\nMy SO agrees. \u201cWhy not? It\u2019s not an epic trip or anything.\u201d    \n\nMe: Ok, sure. My bag is still pretty much ready to go. We just need to get food and water an\u2019 whatnot.     \nNarrator: this is a mistake.    \n\nKevin: No worries. I was in the Boy Scouts, and I have the map and a plan, so I\u2019ll be expedition leader so you guys can just hike with us. It\u2019ll be fun. \n\nNarrator: you know what this subreddit is about right? \n\nWe get sorted largely ignoring Kevin\u2019s gear situation. Load up.   \nNow, I notice an external frame backpack in the back of the truck. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that per se, but it\u2019s legit a vintage bright yellow Boy Scout one with shit like cups and utensils tied to the outside of it like an out of time 50s hobo comedy scene. \n\nI giggle, and point this out to my SO with a \u201cwtf? Look at this shit.\u201d We decided to ignore this.     \nWe\u2019re all Kevins on this blessed day.    \n\nNow, we\u2019re at the trailhead. Kevin dons his backpack in all its clanky glory.      \nThis is when I notice he\u2019s wearing military surplus Vietnam era boots. He\u2019s in his twenties. I am Jack\u2019s visible confusion.      \nThese are terrible hiking boots.      \nI make an Oregon Trail joke.      \nI realized then I\u2019m ~6 years older than him and the max post HS winter camping trips is at most 3. Meh, it\u2019ll be fine, probably.     \nSomewhere deep in the recesses of my mind my homunculus was warning us. \nI ignored him as well.      \n\nI have my watch and \u201cranger beads\u201d (it\u2019s a way to approximate distance for me) I know my gait and time walking and flick a bead on one side to make a klick on the other\u2026 more or less.     \n\ud83c\udfb6 1 Klick, 2 Klick, 3 Klick, 4! Hey bud how many more? \ud83c\udfb6     \n\nWe\u2019re now on top of a bald mountain top. Even trees know it\u2019s a dumb place to be. It\u2019s currently snowing up in spite of physics and gravity.  The wind is being a bitch. I\u2019m starting to using the clear winter nose snot as a protective layer on my face as it\u2019s getting super dry, it\u2019s gross but effective.        \nI had been following my SO and she had one of those nalgene type water bottles on the outside of her pack at the time. I\u2019ve been watching it slowly starting to freeze for miles.       \nI have a dromedary bag and am blowing air into it after drinking to keep it from effing up the tube with ice. I mention this and that it\u2019s important to keep our water liquid so keep some near our bodies to prevent this problem.    \nI ask to look at the map.    \nI\u2019m losing faith in \u201cour leader\u201d.    \nMe: Where\u2019s this cabin, bro?    \n\nKevin: I\u2019ve got some whiskey if you want some. The destination is only an extra inch or two away.    \n\nMe: Wtf does that even mean? And fuck it, yeah, I\u2019ll take shot.        \n\nI get the map, and am dumbfounded.     \nMy dude doesn\u2019t understand topographical maps. It was as the crow flies in his head. There\u2019s two more mountains to go. I explain what the little squiggly round lines mean. Fml      \n\nIt\u2019s nighttime. It\u2019s surviving shit time.     \nIt\u2019s mutiny time. I explain to my SO and we start setting up camp on the trail.     \nKevin thinks this is poor etiquette.     \nWe explain that if someone is hiking on this trail tonight they\u2019re also subscribed to the hurtin\u2019 plan, and would benefit from some help.     \nKevin says we should walk down to the valley where there\u2019s a \u201cproper\u201d campsite. \nWe walk down and point out the gale force winds blasting snow through there and how the little trees are damn near sideways. \u201cIt\u2019s a windy winter death trap down there, bro.\u201d       \nThis is a revelation to Kevin.    \n\nDay two:    \n\nKevin\u2019s HS BF and their girlfriend are lagging behind. I mention this to my SO, and we both make note of this.    \nWe make a take a snack break (I mean I want some of Kevin\u2019s whiskey and some chocolate peanut M&Ms because fuck it) and when they catch up we\u2019re told we don\u2019t need to stop and they\u2019ll always catch up. This is almost always a lie.     \nI get it, but no need to embarrassed.    \nNot everyone has the same skill set or whatever.  We leave it at that.    \n\nNow, I fall back and follow the slowest person. No one gets left behind. My SO is in front slowing Kevin down on purpose. Kevin thinks we\u2019re sabotaging the plan.        \n\nKevin informs me on the next break, away from the group, that the young lady has asthma and that\u2019s why they\u2019re slower. \u201cThey just need more time to do things.\u201d     \nI did not know this. He did. Sonofa\u2026 \nI am Jack\u2019s visible anger.      \n\nWe continue in the same fashion.    \nKevin is upset by this new situation.     \nHe probably thinks he\u2019s been usurped.     \nIt\u2019s true and he would probably be angry if he knew what that word meant. \n\nWe make it to the \u201ccabin\u201d it\u2019s a two plank A-Frame rain shelter. It apparently was basically designed to be a wind tunnel with a raised deck to make sure you freeze to death in it to make it easier to collect dumb hikers in the wintertime.     \n\nKevin is disappointed by this fact and wants to speak to the manager.     \nI am zero percent surprised at this point.     I\u2019m now laughing maniacally and pointing at the \u201ccabin\u201d and my SO is now concerned about my mental health.     \n\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just so absurd\u2026 I mean just look at it! Bwahaha!     \nI had to let it out. Okay, let\u2019s do the things.\u201d\n \nWe make campsite \u201ccabin\u201d mildly less terrible with tarps and tent gear, and then start a campfire against god\u2019s will.    \n\nDay two dinner time:       \nKevin has a vintage Svea 123 stove.    \nI find this fascinating and neat.    \nHe\u2019s never used it before. Because of course not. I also laugh at this because he thought he could feed 5 people on this but doesn\u2019t realize it\u2019s not only tiny, but doesn\u2019t know how to warm it up to make it work.    \nI can\u2019t be bothered at the moment, but told him to warm it up.    \nThis is a dumb thing for me to say.     \nKevin places the gas tank next to the fire.        \nI meant warm it in his hands.       \nWe\u2019re all Kevins on this blessed day.     \n\nWe make dinner for everyone on our \u201cmodern\u201d camp stove. Not Kevin\u2019s.       \nKevin is amazed by this technology and that lightweight 2 liter camp pots with lids and windscreens for camp stoves exist.   \n\nWe also have extra food. I\u2019m not over resource hoarding at this point in my life, and I hate rationing food.      \nKevin is amazed that those 7 minute rice\/pasta packs and tuna in a foil pouch are a thing.      \nI make toast over the fire with a sturdy loaf of crusty bread, not bunny bread.      \nThis is another revelation for Kevin.    \n\nLike the other post this inspired. This Kevin had cans of food. So many cans of food and a bottle of whiskey that was basically it.     \nKevin didn\u2019t have a can opener.     \nIf you\u2019ve read this far, your lack of surprise is reasonable.      \nOf all the jangly metal shit, and of all the military surplus shit he had\u2026. \nHe was going to use a knife. A folding pocket knife. Not the locking type.    \nI lend him, and then of course proceeded to show him how to use a P38 cam opener which is the only \u201creal\u201d military shit I have.         \nThis was a revelation to Kevin.    \nHe put cans of beefaroni next to, but basically in the fire.     \nHe burnt his hand trying to retrieve one.     \nWe intervened and had a discussion about the Leidenfrost effect and that perhaps grabbing some snow first and moving quickly might help.      \nThis was a revelation, erm, I mean a black magic fuckery moment for Kevin. \n\nDay three.    \nDid I mention this was supposed to be an easy overnight camp hike?     \nWe head back with minimal talk.    \n\nDay four.   \nNow we\u2019re walking back in silence.    \n\nDay Five.   \nTook a shower and I happily went back to watching trash TV with our other roommate on the couch.    \n\u201cHow was the trip, bruh?\u201d   \n\nMe: Fine, I guess. Hey, is that a joint you got there? Can I hit that?    \n\n\u201cSure man, I thought you didn\u2019t smoke this stuff?\u201d\n\nMe: Thanks, boss.

Also, I wasn't there when the story actually happened. But a friend of mine was. Now for the context. \n\nWe all work for the Bullseye Mart in this story. Everyone in this story does. Of all of us, Kevin and I have worked there the longest (6 years. Him at other stores and me at this one), Tom has worked for about 3 or 4, and Molly has been there about a year and a half now. \n\nNow Kevin is a jerk. No way around it. He's this middle aged man who does as little as possible but passive aggressively complains as much as he can. Not to mention he's a very sexist man. Any woman under the age of 25 has received some backhand compliment or insult or been mansplained by him. A couple managers even got it. He once mansplained the job I've been doing for two years to me like he was the one who originated the job. Needless to say, I was happy to hear this story. \n\nThis story takes place in the OPU room. For those unfamiliar with that term: The OPU room is the large room dedicated to storing orders for in-store and drive-up orders? Wondering why it's taking so long for the drive up person to grab your order? Its because they have to search the hundreds of sometimes thousands of orders in this room to get it ready for you. The OPU room is also where the Pickers go after, well, picking your order. Once they've searched the entire store for your items, they go place it in the OPU room.\n\nThe OPU room is also where Kevin--the designated stock boy of the area--keeps all the dollar spot merchandise he can't push out yet. I'm not sure how it is at other stores, but my Bullseye Mart has a large, spacious back room large enough to fit multiple shelves, big bulky boxes, various types of unboxed products, two grown men, two 3-tier carts, and still have room for my self-esteem issues to boot.\n\nThere are two entrances to the OPU room. The main one at the front that sees 98% of the foot traffic and a small back grey door clearly labeled employees only and is often used for employees to sneak away to bathroom breaks or lunches but also qualifies as a fire exit, given its proximity to the actual fire exit. \n\nOn this day, Molly was prepping a drive up order as Tom, a picker, went to a quick bathroom break. Kevin then walks in, pushing a 3-tier cart full of merchandise he can't push out yet. Kevin walks to his large backroom, parks his cart in right in front of the grey door (despite the size of the room and how easily he could fit it in there) and proceeds to start shelving merchandise. \n\nTom walks in not to long after and, unprepared, smacks right into Kevin's cart. Kevin kinda gives Tom a look and says \"That's a bit of a safety hazard there, huh Tom?\"\n\nTom gives Kevin a look back, \"What'd you mean? This is your cart.\"\n\nKevin: Well yeah, but you can only use that door to exit. Not enter. \n\nTom: ... What?\n\nKevin: That door is only for exiting no one uses it to enter. That's against the rules! (Side note: Kevin has exited AND entered through the door in question)\n\nTom: No, this door is a normal, employees only door. Enter and exit at will. \n\nKevin: That can't be right. That's against the rules!\n\nTom: I guarantee you it isn't. People use this door all the time to go to the bathroom or to lunches or breaks. That way they can sneak away and not risked getting pulled aside. \n\nKevin: I NEVER use that door to enter. I walk around to the front entrance. Like you're suppossed to. \n\nTom: Good for you, Kevin. But not everyone is like you. \n\nMolly, while picking her order: Couldn't that door technically be consisted apart of the fire exit path? Like if there's a fire near the other doorway I can run back here and get out?\n\nTom: Yes exactly!\n\nKevin: No! That's against the rules! You're supposed to exit and enter through the main door only. \n\nMolly: So if there's a fire by the main door I should set myself on fire trying to get out?\n\nKevin, clearly frustrated, yanks his cart inside his room: Oh whatever!\n\nEnd of story right? Wrong. Remember the story title?\n\nWell about an hour or so later, after Tom had gone to lunch, Molly was taking a breather after having to run a bunch of orders out at once. That's when Molly overhears Kevin calling out to one of our HR managers, Annie. \n\nAnnie walks over and Kevin says he'd like to report Tom for unsafe behavior. Molly, an avid fan of tea and it's subsequent spilling, slides up to a nearby wall. The perfect vantage point to hear but not be seen. \n\n\"Report Tom for unsafe behavior?\" Annie sounds skeptical. She hired in Tom herself and knows that Tom is one of our safest employees. Kevin continues. \n\n\"Yes! Tom was participating in unsafe behavior that if continues could be a negative impact on the team but also be a negative influence on all team members, especially new hires.\"\n\nAnnie doesn't say anything at first, probably still skeptical, but tells Kevin to explain what happens. And Kevin does. Kevin explains Word for fucking Word what happened. From when he parked his 3-tier cart to right when he got huffy and yanked it in. \n\nAfter the whole story, Annie pauses before asking \"Wait, you placed your 3-tier in front of the grey door?\"\n\nKevin proudly declares \"Yes I did.\"\n\nAnnie: Kevin that is very unsafe!\n\nKevin: ... Huh?\n\nAnnie: That grey door swings out for a reason. Since its so close to a main fire exit, if employees and customers are stuck here and a fire or other such emergency breaks out, then that's the safest way for them to get to the fire exit. Do you always park your carts like that?\n\nMolly, still hiding, has to physically stop herself from shouting out that he, in fact does park his carts like that. But Kevin, poor dumb Kevin, says \"Well yeah, I do, but that's just because--\"\n\nAnnie: Kevin, that's a very hazardous thing to do. Don't you remember the yearly safety training? All exits--especially fire exits--must remain clear at all times. And most doors do open two ways you know. I'll have to talk to your immediate manager about this. I might even have you retake the safety training again. \n\nMolly says she had to shove her hand over her mouth after Annie walked away to keep herself from laughing. Kevin was sulky for the rest of the day and the next day, when Annie and I were walking upstairs to go to our respective breaks, Annie saw that Kevin had placed his 3-tier in front of the door again.\n\nAnniw popped her head in and, sweet as pie, says \"Kevin, don't forget about our conversation yesterday!\" I didn't see Kevin's face, but Molly said he looked like a baby who's candy was Just taken away. \n\nWhen Molly told me the rest of the story later on, I didn't hold back my laughter.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1653333059.0},{"title":"Kevin somehow got into university","author":"silveretoile","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/uwde1d\/kevin_somehow_got_into_university\/","text":"So I just started university, ancient Middle Eastern cultures, and luckily made a group of friends rather quickly.

There are a few quotes and actions that haunt me. \n\n- \u201cwas this built in 1380 BC or AD?\u201d Well it\u2019s a pyramid, so take a guess. \n\n- \u201chow was I supposed to know the head of the Roman pantheon wasn\u2019t the pope?

Kevin was disgusted when the man proposed marriage and decided to teach him to respect women. Kevin did this by texting him non-stop and sending memes. Kevin was shocked he thought she was into him. \n\n- Kevin has a very strained relationship with her parents because she still gets an allowance, which makes the parents think they have the right to decide how she lives her life. Kevin fixes this by punishing her parents. She does this by asking for even more money. Kevin is shocked they then demand lifestyle changes. \n\n- Kevin had made a presentation for our class on presentation skills that turned out to be way too long. Instead of skipping one or two parts, Kevin cuts her presentation off in the middle and instead of finishing the thing, stares at the professor until he realizes she\u2019s, in fact, done. Kevin then corrects the professor when he\u2019s giving her feedback. Kevin is very upset at the resulting bad mark and finds it extremely unfair. \n\n- Kevin thinks takeaway Chinese food is too ethnic, foreign and scary.

I am younger and stupider, as were we all, but none so much as Kevin. A group of us, all coworkers in our late teens or early 20's, decided to take a backpacking trip in the Alberta rockies. We plan to pack our gear in, camp overnight, and hike out. The amount of camping experience varies among the group, with Kevin being completely inexperienced. This shouldn't be a problem because those of us who know what we're getting into are more than happy to give direction. Of course, it was a problem, because Kevin's gotta Kevin...\n\nThe day before the trip, the group hits up a supermarket. We explain to Kevin that as we need to carry all food in, he should pick lightweight, non perishable food items. The rest of us stock up on ramen, powdered soups, tuna and crackers, easy mac n cheese, beef jerky and pepperoni, ect. Kevin complains that he doesn't like soup. We explain that he doesn't have to get soup, we've just all chosen to grab Ramen because, again, lightweight and non-perishable. We show him the other items we have in our baskets. Kevin grabs a few of these, as well as SIX JUMBO CANS of hearty beef soup for lunch and dinner each day. We caution against this: these cans are extremely heavy and our backpacks will already weigh a lot. Kevin refuses to be dissuaded. We are unimpressed because he will not have room to carry his fair share of supplies in, but it isn't worth the argument. Carrying the cans up the steep slopes will be punishment enough. \n\nThe morning of the trip, we pick Kevin up. He's very excited that he has come up with a solution to the problem of the heavy cans! The night prior he opened all six cans and used a funnel to get the soup into three 2 litre plastic soda bottles. When questioned as to how this solved the problem, he explained that plastic is lighter than metal. When asked if the cans felt particularly heavy once emptied, he failed to see the relevance. When cautioned that his food was now neither lightweight nor non perishable, he became defensive. Offers to stop at a grocery store to pick up more appropriate food items were refused with a tone of hostility. \n\nCut to: Kevin, with food poisoning, pooping his guts out an 8 hour hike away from civilization.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1653311794.0},{"title":"New Dad Kevin","author":"Spudsalicious","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/utqlnx\/new_dad_kevin\/","text":"I realize I do have a Kevin tale about my ex-husband and it still makes everyone I tell it to wonder what the hell?!\n\nTo set the scene, Kevin and I were living in Minnesota at the end of February many moons ago.  Kevin was 26 at the time and we had just had our first child, a girl.  Now Kevin is the third of four children with his brother being 13 months younger, while I had a sister 10 years my junior (sort of important for later).\n\nOn the first day home with our new baby we were both fairly nervous.  Time rolls around for the first diaper change and hubby and I are gonna do this as a team.  As a big sister I had changed my fair share of them. I take off the diaper and am rewarded with a lovely fountain of pee (yes, this happens with girls, too).  My husband is dumbfounded and said, \"What's wrong with her? Why is she peeing from there?\" Uh, what?  I just looked at him.  He repeated himself, \"Why is she peeing from there? Is something wrong with her?\"  I looked at him as if he had grown a third head.  \n\n\"She's fine.  That's just because it's a little cold in here. \"  I was failing to see what he was so concerned about.\n\n\"No.  She's peeing from the front. Why?\"  he asked.  I told him that is perfectly normal.  That is where girls pee from.  What did he think was going on? Where did HE think girls peed from?  I still can't believe his reply.  He said that he thought girls peed out of their a\\*\\*holes and that's why they had to sit down to go to the bathroom!!  I absolutely lost it!  \n\nFirst thing I did once I wiped away my tears from laughing so hard was to call his younger brother.  Was this some weird thing their parents had told them growing up?  Nope, Brother confirmed that he knew how female anatomy worked.  I know back then (mid 80's) health classes in middle and high school did little to nothing to let you know about contraception and LGBTQ issues but the one thing they did teach you was about the basic plumbing differences between boys and girls.

It is our 12 year anniversary (yay!) and he surprised me by making a nice dinner. Steak, asparagus, roasted potatoes, appetizers, you name it. He called me down to the kitchen because dinner was almost ready. \nWe wait until the timer goes off. He opens up the oven, no smell at all. He cuts into the steak to show me, it is lightly browned from where he seared it, but otherwise raw and cold. He had been in the kitchen over an hour at this point. I look at him and asked if he followed a recipe. He said yeah, on the package it said 170 degrees for medium rare and went by the weight to determine the number of minutes. I tried to hide a stupid grin on my face as I explain to him that it needs to reach an internal temperature of 170 to be medium rare, and that it\u2019s not a \u201crecipe\u201d on the package of raw meat, but rather general guidance on how not to get food poisoning from bacteria. As he goes back to cooking, he sees me trying not to laugh while typing something on my phone. He says \u201cUh huh, get that shit eating grin off your face, call your mom so I can hear it\u201d. Mom and I cackled and couldn\u2019t stop while I was telling her about it over the phone. I told my Kevin that was the best anniversary present he could give me, a funny memory while he was doing something so sweet. \n\nOriginal post:\n\nMy(33f) husband (37)is wonderful in so many ways. He is an excellent provider, hard worker, honest to a fault(part of the Kevin problem), will do anything at all to help me and our family. He has his masters degree and is an Eagle Scout. But he is still a Kevin. Here are a few examples\u2026 I am embarrassed to mention them.\n\n1. When we got married, we were in a vacation home with his parents and siblings. We were super young (21 and 25) and had packed all of our stuff in his backpack. When We were  about to leave my husband was packing and found my pair of spanx\/girdle\/whatever you want to call it embarrassing looking beige undergarment I wore under my dress. I had rolled it up and put it in the bottom of his backpack because it was embarrassing. He brings it down to breakfast shows it to everyone and says \u201cmom are you sure these aren\u2019t yours?\u201d And I am looking at him like \u201cwhat?!?\u201d. And his mom said \u201cno I told you yesterday they weren\u2019t mine.\u201d So apparently after the wedding, I hid the embarrassing underwear in The bottom of his backpack. He thought, \u201coh, my mom must of put these in here\u201d. He asks his mom that day she says no. Apparently, that is not good enough for him. He then Brings them back to our room and puts them on the bed. I see them later, put them back in the backpack, thinking I must of forgotten to do it earlier. So he pulls them out again and brandishes them at the breakfast table in front of his whole family. I almost died. I guess I should pat myself on the back because he could never picture me wearing something like that? \n2. He has started karate in the past year and is obsessed with it. My little sister and I have started a quote book of him talking about it. I also often record\/take pictures of him demonstrating his \u201cforms\u201d and weapons. He has a very Dwight from the office vibe. He will often come into the kitchen while I am cooking dinner and say things like \u201cattack me\u201d or \u201ctry to see if you can punch me, I promise I won\u2019t hurt you\u201d. \u201cWhen I tried for my next belt, you are supposed to demonstrate the new form. I don\u2019t do that, I do every single form back to back.\u201d. His karate teacher recently got a higher degree black belt, and he is now classified as a \u201cmaster\u201d. My husband has started referring to him in conversation as Master Smith (made up last name). I asked him if he calls Smith that and he said yes. I asked if his teacher asked him to call him \u201cmaster\u201d and he said no. I told him that it is very odd and gives me a BDSM or slavery vibe, but he refuses to stop. It just weirds me out as he is there with our kids and lots of other kids calling another man master smith while everyone else calls him Mr. Smith , but what do I know? \n3. He is not very good about the kids clothes. Not meaning, \u201coh, he can\u2019t match stuff\u201d or \u201cthat shirt is on backwards \u201c. It is MUCH worse than that. I am a nurse and go to work before the kids get up(7m and 6f). I am home when they get off the bus. My som gets off the bus one day  wearing his little sisters sweat pants that she outgrew. Instead of wearing underpants he had on a pair of basketball shorts underneath the skin tight, pedal pusher sweats(they were obviously \u201cgirl\u201d, fitted and flaired, sweater material, stylish). The basketball shorts were Bunched up and sticking out of the top of the stupid sweatpants. It looked very uncomfortable and ridiculous.My son could not care less about getting dressed, he literally grabs the first thing he sees. I take pictures of the boy and confront H with the evidence. His response is \u201c but what about all the days I got him to school wearing regular clothes?  You never talk about that\u201d\nSMH.\n4. The icing on the cake and the tipping point for me is last week when he took our daughter to Girl Scouts. I normally go with her but I wasn\u2019t feeling well. Before \nThey leave my daughter calls up the stairs \u201cmom, do I need to wear my Girl Scout skirt?\u201d I yell back down \u201cno, just your vest\u201d. Mind you, it Was cold, jacket weather. My husband has Always Been OCD about the kids wearing jackets. She comes home at the end of the night all excited, clutching an award(it was their special thanksgiving night and awards night) and talking all about it. She is wearing her white polo, Girl Scout vest, little blue Beret hat and white stockings. That is it. I ask my daughter where the rest of her clothes are she says \u201cdad said it was ok\u201d I confront my husband, he looks at me confused \u201c you told her she Could wear that. I asked her to go upstairs and see if her outfit was OK and you said yes. I thought it was a little strange but you said it was ok\u201d I told him \u201cWhat I meant was, if she was wearing blue jeans from the day, she could keep wearing those, not literally all she has to wear is her Girl Scout vest.\u201d\n\nCouple more Random things I just remembered. One time, he made gravy in the morning not with flour but powdered sugar. Another time, I had Marinated chicken strips and put them in a bowl in the fridge. He asked me if they were ready to eat and I said I don\u2019t know I can\u2019t remember. He heated them up in the microwave, and started eating them. And he had this disgusted look on his face, but kept eating it. I walked over and looked  and it was raw chicken! To this day he has a fear of chicken and rarely will eat it.\nI could Go on and on and on, this kind of stuff happens all the time. I love them to death but I Get a shaking my head rolling my eyes headache vibe far too often. Thankfully I can laugh at all the stupid things. And the funny thing is, he knows I think it\u2019s hilarious and he doesn\u2019t care. My Kevin has a full-time job at a university that he has had for eight years. He also does carpentry work on the side for fun and brought in over 30 grand last year. He put it straight into A savings account for our kids college.It may sound like I married an idiot, which I did, but he hides it well for most other people.I feel like I have to stress that because he is my husband and I am talking about how stupid he is on the Internet to strangers. I love him so much and we are very happy.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1652912946.0},{"title":"Kevin in the kitchen","author":"Remodulate_It","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/usu3pt\/kevin_in_the_kitchen\/","text":"I worked with a Kevin for a short time in a diner. This poor kid was so sheltered, his parents gave him everything he wanted, and he was devoted to his mom. So much so that it got a little creepy, referring to time spent with his mom in the hot tub as \"mommy and me time\" but maybe that was just our sick kitchen worker sense if humor.\n\nHe was really absent-minded, never took anything seriously, \n\nSome examples of his Kevin-ness include:\n\n- He cut his hand on the tomato slicer, immediately after being told exactly how to handle it without cutting yourself. \n\n- He would start cleaning and putting away ingredients at 1pm. On Sundays we do brunch and close at 3. He just figured we wouldn't get any more customers from 1-3.\n\n- He only worked Sundays. his parents wouldn't let him work the dinner shift after school, and he had high school band practice saturdays. But that didn't stop him from non stop bitching about how he wanted to go home, and he was tired, and how work sucks. I understand he's a high schooler and he didn't want his whole weekend taken up by obligations but damn it pissed me off when I'm at the end of my 5 day workweek and here's this rich spoiled kid complaining about his one 4 hour work shift a week.\n\nHe also told us that his parents didn't even want him to have a job. He didn't have any bills to pay, honestly I don't know why he stayed as long as he did.\n\n-He claimed he wanted to get a band scholarship to go to college, he also claimed to hate band and the instrument he played (French horn)\n\n- He kept asking me if I knew what specific fetishes were, and when I would confirm that I did know what that fetish was, he would laugh and go \"ewww\" as if saying I knew about a particular fetish confirmed in his mind that I had that fetish.\n\n\n-His parents would come to eat, and tell him how to do his job, counter to our bosses instructions. Like insisting that he (not a waiter) ask customers what temp they wanted their burgers. Our menu states burgers are cooked medium-well, but customers can ask for any temp they want.\n\n- His parents would try really hard to find something to complain about every time they came to eat, which (mercifully) wasn't often. \n\n-The last straw with him happened one Sunday I actually had off, so this is all secondhand. he was sitting down next to the freezer looking at his phone, (nono while we have customers) he had already burned 3 orders if pancakes because he would put them on the griddle, go back to his chair and look at his phone.\n\nOne waitress says to him \"Kevin, I need gravy\" to which he responds \"I don't know where that is\" the waitress points at the freezer he's sitting next to. He opens it, gets a little foam cup of frozen cream gravy, and hands it to her. Then proceeds to sit back down with his phone. It's his job to heat up the gravy either in a pan or the microwave, depending on how slammed we are, and put it in the window for them to take to the customer. \n\nAt this point the waitresses are all yelling at him, the boss is yelling at him, the dining room can hear the boss cussing him out,  \"Kevin get off your fucking ass and work what the hell is wrong with you!?\"\n\nThat decided his fate, and he was gone from the schedule the next Sunday. I'm sure his parents were pleased.\n\n(Edit) sorry about formatting, on mobile","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1652930401.0},{"title":"Help these people are annoying and I need advice.","author":"Far-Two7434","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/usp2ia\/help_these_people_are_annoying_and_i_need_advice\/","text":"Hi,\nSo I\u2019m a younger person and I\u2019m still in school, I go on the bus EVERY SINGLE DAY, and I rarely ever miss it, but there have been these girls bothering me and my friends, my friends who will be called E, and D, and the annoying girls are going to be called, A, B, and C, for asshole bitch and Cunt, (I know not very nice of me) and I will be of course what everyone is called here (usually) OP.

Now this happened in the fall of 2020, just as things in my Province were semi-opening\/semi-closing because our Premier is dumber than rocks and truly belongs in this subreddit as well. But I digress:\n\nI'm walking towards my mall's Indigo to catch up on the adventures of Batman kicking the Batman who Laughs ass and some legos. YES I am way behind on my reading lmao. Anyways I'm walking towards Indigo and I hear the shrieks of a Kevin, even while I'm in an ELEVATOR going down. The door opens to Kevin telling a poor Indigo employee he quote \"I DON'T HAVE TO WEAR A MASK BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT SAID SO. IT'S UNPATRIOTIC AND IDIOTIC SINCE THIS ISN'T EVEN REALLLLL \\*cough cough\\*\" Yes he did cough. The \"I just came outta a FIRE coughing\".\n\nUpon seeing this walking Facebook \"f\\*ck doctors because I know everything\" post, I doubled my masks and approached. Now why would Kevin think I was a cop? Well back then I had a black coat\/sweater that was covered in patches I'd collected over the years and one of them was a \"Toronto Police Dept.\" logo patch. Not too proud of that considering how abusive those cops are but in 2019 I was a different person. Tik Tok changed my life is all I'll say and the sweater \"mysteriously\" got destroyed in the wash. Hmm tragedy.\n\nAnyways Kevin sees my double masking and is infuriated. He shouts \"HEY PIG DON'T TELL ME YOU BOYS IN BLUE HAVE FALLEN FOR THIS BS TOO?\" He rhymed and it was a crime lol. The Indigo employee stared at Kevin. I then follow up and tell Kevin to Fuck off, to take his \"president\" BS back to the states, to take the piss and basically went off on him. I NEVER insisted I was a cop by even throwing out \"Man I'm no cop, never want to or will be but bro no don't address ANYONE like this\". I do not appreciate someone holding me back from the adventures of the World's Greatest Detective, nor do I appreciate someone giving an employee this BS.\n\nKevin then brought us to his stupidity. He told me ***AGAIN*** he didn't need to wear a mask and blah blah blah. I tell him \"We're in CANADA so no your American BS patriot shit don't carry weight up here\" the equivalent of saying \"This is Chicago\" at the end of a mic-drop. Kevin then stared at me and I got the wonderful \"No it DOES apply since Canada is a territory\". He then proceeded to explain to me that Canada is a territory (like Guam or Puerto Rico) the US earned when they \"Won the War of 1812\". I wasn't shocked but I then asked \"what state are you from\" he then smudging replied \"See you can admit your one of us (didn't but ok Kevin) I'm from Maine\". And then followed with these things which are just the best, and by best I mean SCARY STUPID:\n\n\\- Mexico is a territory as well and that the states inside of Mexico are all myths\n\n\\- Canada only consists of 6 provinces (I'm giving his credit because he called them states too) these being: British Columbia, Alberta, Sask, Manitoba, Ontario and before you guess it no, not Quebec but Newfoundland (even though it's Newfoundland and Labrador as they are technically one),\n\n\\- He believes Quebec belongs to France as \"Everyone there speaks French and no English it's really sad\" (Quebecers do speak both English and French and their French is actually different from France French).\n\n\\- He ignored the existence of Nunavut, North-west territories, and the Yukon as \"those are made up places\"\n\n\\- He also believes that Prince Edward Island is fake because \"Nothing that small exists\" but clearly Kevin has never looked down and that Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are \"owned by the British\".\n\nAnd then brought everything back to \"and that's why I don't have to wear a mask since this is America, it says so in the name North America\". He then turned his attention to the Indigo employee and just arriving security and was asked to leave. He threw a fit citing: the first amendment, the constitution and basically turned into a walking Maga poster. LMAO. Even though I wanted to punch this pos in the face, he fascinated me. I wanted to know if he thought the sun was hot or if water was wet.\n\nHe also shouted that I was a cop and believed him or some BS. Security took one look at my coat and turned to Kevin saying \"um that's a patch... not a badge\". According to other fellow patrons surrounding the graphic novel section, Kevin lost his cool before he could enter the store, telling the Indigo lady she was \"just like the same fake ass border people\" meaning he even gave border security shit.

And the only reason it did was after I told him to piss off thing calmed and we tried to reason with Kevin which is how I was able to ask where he's from, and to explain to us **why** he believes he doesn't have to wear a mask. I figured after so many arguments with the maskless masses out there why not reason with him? Yeah, no. Not the best idea out there.

But once I got to know him I realised why he kept getting chucked out the kitchen.\nOur usual way of working was to get all hot meals served and any deserts were done when we had down time. But the amount of times we all had to yell at Kevin for working on deserts while there was loads of hot food to be taken out. And when he did the ice-cream sundaes, instead of just putting the 3 scoops in as per the company guide book, Kevin would force the ice-cream in so it becomes a solid ice-cream mass. This meant a tub of ice-cream that would normally last 2\/3 days lasted just an hour for Kevin and complaints from customers because they couldn't eat their ice-cream.\nWhen Kevin was doing the washing up, he'd put the hot water on to fill the sink, then leave it to go work the bar. And put 6 or 7 shots of washing up liquid in the sink when instructions ON THE BOTTLE say 2 max! This meant everything came out with that greasy washing up liquid film on it even after going through the dishwasher! When the kitchen manager asked why he did it, a he could do was shrug his shoulders. So the kitchen manager empties the sink and stands there watching Kevin fill up the sink property. And I kid you not, literally the moment the kitchen manager turns his back, Kevin adds another 6 shots of washing up liquid into the sink. If I hadn't witnessed it with my own eyes I wouldn't have believed it. Kitchen manager yells \"WHY KEVIN?\" and got nothing more than a deer in the headlights look in return.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1652266320.0},{"title":"REAL KEVIN MOMENT.

Camo\u2019s antics were very crazy.\n\nCamo once broke a weeding tool by attempting to twirl it around, claiming he had bo staff skills.\n\nCamo clocked me in the head with a part of a branch that was cut from a tree. Let me explain. We cut some branches from some trees in one of the parks, then cut them up into smaller pieces and loaded them into a trailer. We drove the trailer to a wood pile that used to be located behind the wave pool. Then Camo decides to jump in the trailer and throw pieces out in random directions, and I caught one in the head.

It wasn't to go to the bathroom or get something from his car, he just gets up & leaves & comes back 5mins later like nothing happened.\n\nSo while I was working on a customer's recycling, he just goes back to his seat, grabs his book (It wasn't a Bible) and starts reciting something from Psalms & I told him \"Kevin, Go weigh the plastics please.\" He just finishes reciting Psalms & then goes to weighs it.\n\nAfter the customer leaves, my Supervisor starts to tell him that he can't be preaching his religion to customers because it's not professional. I tell him the same thing saying that I'm religious too but I keep it to myself & the only religious thing I have visible on me is my cross necklace & even then, I don't talk about it unless a customer mentions it. Even if a customer mentions it, I thank them, & continue working on sorting & weighing their recycling.\n\nLike 5mins later, we had a family come in with their recycling for us to sort. Kevin, again starts to tell them that their kids are gonna be future saints & that the church welcomes them.

I could write a small book on the stupid of the town, but here are some of the highlights.\n\nThe local diner that all the locals thought was awesome, was always serving meals with meat still frozen in the middle, and almost everything was freezer burnt. The entire place stank of rotting food and pig shit, like, farmers would walk in with shit literally sloughing off their clothes, and that was normal. All bread products had that distinct aftertaste of mold. Thing is, a solid portion of the town\u2019s population truly believed that to be fine dining.\n\nThe whole town *hated* outsiders, to the point of hurting their own businesses. What makes someone an outsider? Your family doesn\u2019t live within a few counties. If your grandparents weren\u2019t a 20 minute drive away, many would unironically think you are working to bring about the town\u2019s downfall or whatever dumbass shit, and will do petty garbage. Local realtors would try to sabotage \u201coutsiders\u201d if they think a local might want the house. When you eventually get sick of everyone\u2019s stupidity, those same realtors will try to force you to sell for insultingly low prices to one of their relatives.\n\nThe local school system allowed the same bumpkin teachers to use literally the exact same material for the entirety of elementary, for who knows how embarrassingly long. Kids starting first grade will be given the exact same lessons as their 4th graders. They just go over the alphabet repeatedly. A solid half of their high school aged kids were unable to read their textbooks, and would struggle with math because those same teachers would just have them count on their fingers instead of actually teaching them. Some teachers also teach old wife\u2019s tales as fact, like toads causing warts.\n\nAs far as more specific stories, one of the dumber local families moved in next door. I only knew one of the kids before this, who was a really dumb pathological liar and a thief. Someone must have told him early in life that his nose shrinks when he lies, because he would puff up his nostrils every time he would lie. I last saw him in his mid teens and he still was doing it. However, the youngest was considerably dumber. He couldn\u2019t reliably dress himself, I don\u2019t mean like a 5-6 year old putting his shirt on inside out, I am talking this dumbass wouldn\u2019t put on underwear and wouldn\u2019t pull his pants up over his ass, well past 10 years old. He always had the most annoying tone to his voice, as if he was trying to imitate a baby, and would sit his bare ass on the ground and cry for a minute every time someone told him off. The oldest of the 3 seems to have inherited all the brains, and from what it seems he rightfully tries to spend as little time as possible with his siblings.\n\nThey for whatever reason got multiple dogs, they kept one inside and one chained up in the back. I doubt either of them were taken care of, there was a layer of dog shit covering everything the dog in the back could reach with it\u2019s short chain, and it would bark and cry literally 24\/7. It seems they often let the dog they had inside shit inside the house, whenever their door opened you could smell it. When they did let it out to do it\u2019s business, it would shit in our yard. They all left really weird garbage everywhere, I have found raw meat tossed into our yard from them, and there was often parts of random cars, lawnmowers, appliances, etc. randomly strewn about. \n\nPhone\u2019s starting to lag, will continue in comments.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1651852841.0},{"title":"Twin Kevins","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/ui9igf\/twin_kevins\/","text":"I taught high school for 7 years. I only truly encountered Kevin twice, and they were a set of twins who insisted on taking every single class together. I taught foreign language to them. Or rather, they sat in my class while I taught everyone else foreign language.\n\nThe highlights:\n\n* They would both routinely stare at the walls. Not like wandering off \/ daydreaming as we all do, but hyper fixation on the cinder block walls. The first time I asked why, their reasoning was that \"they didn't think we had class that day.\" I guess me lecturing and putting notes on the board wasn't a clue.\n* They were both convinced that they were \"extremely smart but just didn't apply themselves\" which honestly makes little sense to begin with. When I asked them if smart people would think it prudent to apply themselves enough to at least pass, they had no answer. Their *combined* grade in my class (and in most other classes they took) was not high enough to pass. They would routinely end quarters with ~10% each.\n* Very seldom did either of them ever turn in any work whatsoever. Homework, projects\u2014even tests and quizzes. They'd just keep them, completely blank, and refuse to turn them in. Then a few weeks later they would try to just claim they were absent on the day of the test or quiz and ask to do it after school. We kept an electronic record of absences, so their success rate on that ploy was 0 for probably 30.\n* Despite never doing a drop of work, they were both vehemently convinced that all their teachers were out to get them and failing them on purpose because \"school is easy, it is impossible to fail.\"\n* They routinely cheated on virtually every assignment they tried to do. But they cheated so poorly it was comical. I frequently caught them with poorly hidden cheat sheets for things like vocab quizzes where the words written were from the wrong chapter.\n* Every now and then one of their hands would go up in the middle of my lecture. Their question was *always*, \"What are we doing?\" They quite literally meant: \"What event is currently taking place in this room?\" They never had the slightest clue if I was lecturing, we were taking a test, or if we were somehow in the midst of a fire drill. Just 0 knowledge of the events going on around them.\n* When they started driving (a terrifying thought), they would routinely leave school as they pleased. When questioned about it, their response was typically that they just thought school ended early that day... despite no one else leaving the building.\n* For a solid semester, they both became unnervingly obsessed with Reddit to the point where after anything occurred, one (or both) of them would say R Slash [insert noun] as though it was the funniest thing known to man. For example, if I said the word homework, one of them would chime in with \"R slash homework!\" which absolutely no one found entertaining in the least.\n* Their English class took them to see a stage play adaptation of The Birds, the Hitchcock horror movie. For probably 2 months after seeing that play, they would both constantly mutter \"the birds the birds the birds the birds the birds the birds the birds the birds the birds the birds the birds the birds the birds\" under their breath for seeming every minute of their waking existence. Then one day that (thankfully) just stopped.\n\nThe most soul rending interaction I had with them was at one of our frequent meetings between me, usually a few other teachers they had, the administration team for the school (principal and 2x VPs), and both their parents:\n\n* They were seniors, were short on credits to graduate by an alarming amount, and had the intellectual capacity of young children. I asked the two Kevins point-blank, \"What skill do you believe you have or at least have the ability to attain that someone in the future is going to pay you for?\" Absolute blank stares from both of them. The silence dragged on. Minutes went by while all ~10 of us in the conference room just waited. Their parents just sort of looked dejected. Finally, maybe 3 or 4 agonizing minutes into the dead silence, one of them said, \"video games.\"\n\nLast I heard, their parents made a large donation to the school (private catholic school), they took \"summer classes\" to make up their missing credits, both graduated, and both were accepted to a very highly ranked engineering college in a neighboring state. I do not know what has become of them since. They would be seniors in college right now.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1651679012.0},{"title":"Kevin has a memory lapse","author":"siriusbalackey","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/uii2t2\/kevin_has_a_memory_lapse\/","text":"I dated a Kevin.

My self and my colleague were running our monthly parkour workshop. \n\nI\u2019m going to say this before all the parents who think they know better then me about parkour but have never done it once in their life say anything: Parkour contrary to popular Karen like opinion is not very dangerous, like with all sports it has its risks, and like with all sports it has coaches (me) to train properly to avoid and lower the risk of injury but just like in American football for example broken bones and concussions still happen. \nI myself have been doing parkour for 6 years and I\u2019ve never broken anything I\u2019ve fallen, winded myself and had some scrapes and hard bangs against the floor but I\u2019ve also played rugby for 7 years and received way more injuries from that then I did parkour.\n\nBUT BACK TO THE STORY\n\nDuring this workshop parents were there watching as this is only 1 hour long, so they stay to take their kids home afterwards. We had kids as young as 6 I think that day to as old as 13-14. \nKevin was an older kid who was about 14 he didn\u2019t look like a Kevin and had done most of what we showed him to do on either his first or second go so far. His mum was not a Karen, she ironically was a doctor.\n\nSo We had just gone over our landings and shoulder rolls and were going to put them into practise, so what we did was gather them all together, and I told them the next steps.\n\nIn parkour we roll to disperse the impact so it doesn\u2019t hurt our joints. Now this wasn\u2019t exactly a high jump and I\u2019ve had the little kids in previous workshops do it with no problem. The jump was about 170cm high down on to grass\n\nMe: This is what is next guys, you\u2019re going start down one end of this block. Jump over to the other end, then jump down, remember landing feet first, bend you legs, hands out and turn your head as you roll and push forward to roll out. (Explained it once)\n\nI then climb up and show them while saying the steps as I do it (explained it twice)\n\nWe then split them up into groups, the other coach takes Kevin in his group and I have mine but while I\u2019m coaching I can he the other coach quickly explain the interruptions again on his block, and I see him demonstrate it again quickly but just the end part. (Explained it 2 more times)\n\nKevin had now heard the instructions 4 times.\nSo far everyone is landing it perfectly, they\u2019re all jumping down to their feet and landing it. Then it\u2019s Kevin\u2019s go, I didn\u2019t see him do it I just turned around to see him half way getting up and cough as the people in that group and some of the parents went \u201cWOOAAHH\u201d\n\nI asked the other coach was happened, he said in stead of jumping down to his feet he decided to drive roll from the top to the ground. For context, someone like me could do that, and be fine might hurt somewhat but I know how to take impact like that, I just wouldn\u2019t do that coz that\u2019s an unnecessary move to do off the end and it is a lot of impact. So for a beginner like Kevin something like this would hurt a lot. Also a dive roll is where you dive like you would into a pool but you change your end into a roll, look up project dive roll on YouTube to understand better.

Not only that, but this year the Super Bowl was held in California, which isn't all that far away from Las Vegas. \n\nSo last December Kevin was out drinking, and with football on his brain and the Super Bowl being so close, he decided that he would like to attend a Super Bowl once in his life, and with it right over in California this year he should just buy some tickets.\n\nLike I explained in the other post, Kevin doesn't really follow sports, or really understand most of them, but he likes to occasionally do sports things. He's bought tickets to NFL games before, so he knows football tickets aren't cheap, and he has some idea that Super Bowl tickets cost more. He didn't however, realize how much more they cost. When, while drunk, he looked them up on his phone and found out how much people were selling tickets for he was floored.\n\nUndeterred Kevin decided to keep looking for Super Bowl tickets to see if maybe someone was selling some really cheap tickets he could afford. You know, in case some scalper was having a clearance sale or something. \n\nHis diligence paid off, and after much searching and scrolling Kevin found someone selling tickets for just $400 a piece. Knowing these tickets were priced too low to last, Kevin quickly entered his credit card number and purchased two tickets. Kevin had no delusions that these were good seats, but it didn't matter because he was going to the Super Bowl, and he was taking one lucky friend with him. Knowing Kevin he was probably on cloud nine right after imaging everyone he knows fighting each other to prove that they were his 'best friend' like some sort of sitcom episode. And he would be King Kevin, lording his extra Super Bowl ticket over everyone right up to the start of the game.\n\nUnlike Kevin, you probably know that there's no fucking way he bought two Super Bowl tickets for $800. Alarm bells went off in my head as soon as my uncle told me the price. I just assumed he got ripped off, but no, Kevin got exactly what he paid for.\n\nYou might be thinking he misread the price. Maybe he did get a really good deal on cheap seats and paid $8000. Kevin would be hurting if he paid $8K for anything, but at least he would have gotten to go to the Super Bowl and always have the story of that time he went. That's a TIFU, not a Kevin story. Kevin only paid $800.\n\nSo what did Kevin buy? He bought two parking spaces near the stadium on Super Bowl Sunday. He realized his fuck up weeks later when he went to check the tickets he bought. Even if Kevin got Super Bowl tickets, he was going to take the bus, because he doesn't own a car, let alone two cars.\n\nBecause he wasn't actually scammed, and got what he paid for, he couldn't dispute the charge. He tried to resell the spots, but they weren't very good and not worth anywhere near what he paid for them.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1651178635.0},{"title":"the adventures of Donald, chapter 4: Donald doesn't know where Mexico is.","author":"ronaldHucklebee","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/udee0g\/the_adventures_of_donald_chapter_4_donald_doesnt\/","text":"Hey everyone, it's Ron back with more Donald. Today's story is about the time that Donald met my Mexican friend (we will call him Carlos).\n\nSo me, Carlos and a few other guys bowl together on Friday nights. This particular Friday Donald was in town and so I invited him to come bowling with us. That was a mistake.\n\nFor the first 20 minutes, he seemed to be watching Carlos extremely closely, so I pulled him aside and asked him what was wrong. He responded \"where did that guy come from? He looks really strange.\" So I told him that Carlos was from Mexico which seemed to confuse him, but he just said \"oh okay\" and we went back to bowling.\n\nSo about another ten minutes go by and then he just looks Carlos dead in the eyes and exclaims \"I remember what Mexico is! It is that place with the flag that has the stripes and stuff!\" Carlos then started laughing and said that that wasn't very descriptive so Donald, understanding that he needed to go into more detail said \"well it has some other shapes too.\" \n\nAt this point Carlos was just having fun with Donald and so he asked him where he thought Mexico was. Donald replied \"it is in Canada.\" When asked where in Canada he said that it was \"in the middle.\" \n\nSo I looked up a picture of a world map and asked him to point out Mexico. He sat there looking at it for a few seconds scratching his head and then said that this was one of those maps that didn't have Canada on it and how could he find Mexico if there wasn't any Canada? So I pointed to Canada for him and he just said \"oh, then it is directly in the middle of that.\" Thankfully Carlos has a sense of humor. Donald on the other hand does not.\n\nCarlos, trying to be nice, then pointed out Mexico on the map. Donald thinking that Carlos was making fun of him, exclaimed \"Just because you are from Mexico that doesn't mean that you know where it is better than me!\" And then stomped off, and now anytime that there is a chance of Carlos being at any event which Donald is considering going to, he comes up with an excuse not to go.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1651094869.0},{"title":"Kevin: eat meat to save the cows","author":"SmellTheFoxglove","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/udbo9k\/kevin_eat_meat_to_save_the_cows\/","text":"He told me in all earnest that he was worried about the future of cows, I asked him how so?

On her boyfriends phone, she saw a text from someone named Madison, that said \u201clove you\u201d, she got upset at her boyfriend  and tasked him to explain it, it\u2019s one of her brothers teammates, a male, someone who she has met multiple times \n\n97. Her boyfriend was talking about the presidential election in France, she asked if why they named cookies after the president, she thought macaroons were named after Emmanuel Macron\n\n98. Her boyfriend took her golfing, she kept making shots that were terrible, before she asked him why he was trying to get it in the hole because the hole gave him a low score, she thought a high score was good in golf cause it is in other sports \n\n99. She saw a classmate with pink hair kiss his girlfriend, he looked shocked, she got in trouble because she said \u201cI thought you were gay\u201d, her logic? He dyed his hair pink\n\n100. Her boyfriend took her on a picnic, they were lying on the grass together and she started to complain her eyes were hurting and she didn\u2019t know why, she was looking directly at the sun with no sunglasses \n\n101. She tried giving a Peep (as in the Easter candy) to her 3 month old cousin and wondered why he wasn\u2019t eating it, the baby obviously doesn\u2019t have teeth yet to be able to eat it\n\n102. Over the break, her family and her boyfriend went to Norway, when they got to the hotel, she needed to use the toilet, she started screaming saying something was attacking her, she had put her hand on the bidet\n\n103. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, her boyfriend is a Maoist and when they were in Norway, he got some stuff from Maoist groups he saw protesting out there, and she got so confused as to what he was doing, despite him explaining his politics to her before \n\n104. She asked her history teacher which nations have \u201cexpensive speech\u201d, she thought free speech was referring to how much it cost monetarily\n\n105.  She thought Alaska and Hawaii were right next to each other because some maps put them next to each other \n\n106. Last month, I mentioned she was watching a video on Victorious with her boyfriend, he was playing the sims a few weeks ago and downloaded some Victorian era cc, she asked \u201cthat doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s from Victorious\u201d\n\n107. She left a cloth towel on the stove when it had a hot surface after her brother had finished cooking, the towel caught flames but luckily it was quickly put out by the sprinklers in the kitchen\n\n108. She found out that Turkey was a country, when she did, she asked if that\u2019s where turkey (the animal) comes from\n\n109. She clogged the toilet after trying to flush down some rocks, she had gotten them at the beach and wanted to see what would happen if she flushed them? Why, she said she thought it\u2019d be cool. She has no logic.\n\n110. She was shopping at the antique store with her boyfriend and a few of their friends, the store had some crystals and she bought them, insisting she saw somewhere online about how they cure headaches, period cramps, bowl issues, and much more, when her mom saw, she even said she (the mom) didn\u2019t know if they\u2019d work, but she insisted they would \n\n111. She said she wanted to run to be on the student council next year, so she could be with her boyfriend, her mother asked her what policy ideas she had and she couldn\u2019t come up with anything, she tried copying some of her boyfriends campaign ideas but very badly botched the point of them \n\n112. Their youngest brother was watching a completion of stupidly gendered products, she tries to defend why pens for women actually makes sense, basically going on nonsense about how women write different and need different pens then men, without explaining why, she also uses the same pens her brother used, when he pointed this out, she told him that she was doing something wrong\n\n\nThis stuff here isn\u2019t from the past month, but more stories my girlfriend remembered \n\n113. When she was in 5th grade, a classmate spilt milk on her desk, she suggested to get the cat that was always outside the classroom to drink it (to be fair, the cat was domesticated, and was a pet of someone who lived near the school), but she didn\u2019t get why it may not be safe\n\n114. She was in the car with her friends when they saw a rainbow, she suggested they drive to the end to find a leprechaun, she thought leprechauns were \u201creal Irish dwarfs\u201d\n\n115. At the 6th grade dance, she decided it would be a good idea to ask out her crush, he was wearing a suit with a gay flag lapel pin and holding the hand of a boy, she didn\u2019t realize he was gay (but as I mentioned earlier in the post, apparently now she thinks pink hair = gay)\n\n116. When she was around 12, she tried painting her room without her parents and spilt paint on her carpet, she thought the best way to try to get the paint out was to mop it\n\n117. About a year ago, when on a date with her boyfriend, she asked the waiter bathrooms didn\u2019t have showers\n\n118. She bullied a boy in 4th grade for wearing a tie die shirt, calling it \u201chippie\u201d and calling him \u201cweird\u201d, when she got in trouble for it, she insisted only women could be hippies\n\n119. When learning about the bald eagle in 6th grade, she asked about the hair eagle, she thought because a bald eagle was called a bald eagle, that some eagles have hair, as in like human hair\n\n120. A few months back, she got a point off of a test because she spelt her own name wrong (at least she doesn\u2019t usually do that)\n\n121. She once said she thought Montana was in Canada\n\nThat\u2019s all I have for now, but I\u2019ll be sure to update y\u2019all in May, the longer the relationship between her and her boyfriend go on, the more me and my girlfriend wonder how he does it, I also feel bad for her parents, like I said, I\u2019ve known the family for years and she has never exactly been the brains of the family to put it mildly","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1650961560.0},{"title":"the Kevin's of my life, part one: AT MY YOUTH GROUP!!!","author":"Emo_Dell","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/udbuk5\/the_kevins_of_my_life_part_one_at_my_youth_group\/","text":"So I ofc was at my youth group .im not Christian but I'm forced there and just go along with it.\n  we were going into worship I was standing next to my friend .For context we've been friends two years we don't talk about religion as she knows I'm atheist .

To be frank if you look at him you would guess he is a nerdy guy, but my man has ISSUES. At the start of uni so about 2,5 years ago in lab practice he has almost killed us in more than one \"experiment\". He almost poisoned me with cyanide gas after the teacher specifeied you can't do this, but yet he did, and why you may ask? Because he wondered if he can smell the bitter almond scent of it, so when he did not he offered a sniff for me. BTW not many can actually smell it only about 1 in 5 people so he could have poisoned himself on the first lab practice by accident, but alas he prevailed. Next time he opened all gas burners to the top and then left them open after, if the others don't notice the smell we would have died in an explosion. BUT this is not even close!!! He has poured concentrated acid on other people by tripping only a few drops but still their lab coats were destroyed. The next time he had conducted his own experiment with burning a piece of red copper and some other stuff I don't remember because the nex thing he does he lifts the still fuming piece out of the ventillated chamber and proceeds to sniff it, the smoke alarm gets triggered and the emergecy shower kicks in. I have never seen so rusty water before or ever since. Even the teacher was gasping on how could he have done it so badly, then he said that this shower hadn't been used since it was installed about 10 years earlier, so yeah this magnificent individual could do anything.\n\nAt the end of the semester we betted on which exam he would fail out since he didn't seem to be a very intelligent one. But he suprised and saddened all of us, even the teacher hoped he wouldn't continue this major. The we his desk victims have then banded together and have made the statement to remove him from our desk and the faculty placed an extra teacher to monitor him and to avoid any further incidents. But this was cut short due to COVID and going online. \n\nDuring this period of 1.5 years he has somehow amazed all of us and is somehow still here, but he has no idea most of the time about what is he doing and to be honest he kinda has some mental issues but does not aknowledge them. This and his literally lifeless mindset resulted in many many HOLY SHIT, how is this guy even alive? moments some as following:\n\nHas never been to a McDonalds or any fast food restaurants before, a groupmate invited him out and ordered for him a classic McChicken, he liked it and 2 weeks later he goes in and forgets the name of the dish so he asks the groupmate and he sends him the name, which he butchered and the poor cashier gave him some other sandwich we guessed, because he said it was not the same.\n\nBTW we are not in an english speaking country, and it is mandatory for us to get a language exam in either english or german, but if you ask this Kevin he will inform you that he choose to learn latin, bacause he can't imagine speaking in such unintelligent ways as these languages, his words not mine.\n\nHe asked us what a Tablet is, and then he called it the big phone thing.\n\nHe does not understand any memes or recent popculture things. \n\nHe has no hobbies at all. \n\nHe went out into the city in full lab coat on more than one occasion.\n\nHe has broken so many lab devices that if something drops we look over there firstly.\n\nHe has no understanding of social boundaries and will akwardly stand around you silently.\n\nHe has asked a teacher for her phone number and he got it, for what reason? To remind her to do things. (That teacher is also weird)\n\nHe has no siblings and his parents are religious nutjobs after his description.\n\nOne time he had to do a small group project online and before the presentation he has RUN INTO A F\\*CKING CUPBOARD so fast he had an open wound on his stomac and the others had to present is for him, did he fake it maybe you ask? NO, because he literally sent a bloody photo of the hole in him.\n\nThere is a guy in our country that is similar to Michael Jackson for the US and he didn't know him at all. \n\nSometimes he speaks or sends you some random shit on messenger in latin, and sometimes he insists on using it in the original latin even if the modernised version is not even close to that so even the teachers are left wondering if he is posessed or something.\n\nThis is not even close to what we experienced during this almost 3 years,  and we only hope and brace ourselves that we are not even the proximity when he will start to work in the field alone unsupervised. \n\nI hope you enjoyed it, I have more to tell later.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1650740330.0},{"title":"Kevina, the hospital aide (again)","author":"pinkduckies","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/u9uwvh\/kevina_the_hospital_aide_again\/","text":"I've posted here before about her [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/tfcgar\/kevina_a_hospital_employee_doesnt_know_what_an\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) but she's done more stupid things since.\n\nKevina works as a hospital aide that was a new hire... >5 months ago.

(regardless of what books said).\n2. All snakes were poisonous. (There is no such thing as venom; that's the incorrect and out-of-date term for poison. Constrictors are poisonous too, by the way).\n3. Frogs and toads can give you warts (because the human papillomavirus (HPV) can be contracted from amphibians)\n4. Cows are animals, NOT mammals (because the two are mutually exclusive)\n5. Ants are NOT animals, they are insects (again, mutually exclusive)\n6. And the crux of our story: the giant birds circling over our town were red-tailed hawks.\n\nAs I watched our condor population soar (pun intended) from 6 to 20+ individuals over the years, Kevina and I had several verbal altercations over the identity of our birds. This sums them all up:\n\nKevina: \"Oh the hawks are back!\"\n\nMe, looking up: \"Nope. Those are condors.\"\n\nKevina: \"No, they're hawks! Want to know how to tell the difference? The shape of their wings. The wing shape of those birds says they're red-tailed hawks.\"\n\nNote: these birds were circling and coming down to land on our eucalyptus trees at a height of about three stories up in the air. They would land awkwardly, flaring their huge wings until they got their balance. Even from this distance, you could see that their heads were naked of feathers.\n\nMe: \"Kevina, these birds don't have feathers on their heads. Their tails aren't red. And their wingspan is huge.\" (Condor: 9.5 feet, Red-Tailed Hawk: 4.8 feet at most, y'all).\n\nKevina: \"Nope. You're wrong. You just can't see the red of their tails from below. This is one thing I know more about than you.\"\n\nMe: \"No.. no you don't, Kevina.\"\n\nKevina: \"Yes I do. The shape of their wings says hawk, so you're wrong.\"\n\nShe turned her back and walked away the instant I held a science book about animals anywhere near her. She wouldn't even acknowledge anything that could possibly prove her wrong. On the plus side, this provided me with a very \"cross vs vampires\" way to making Kevina shove off during my school years.\n\n22 years later, Kevina is a staunch anti-vaxxer. She found me after a 20 year gap and spent far too much of the next two years yelling at me on social media to wake up, do my research, and stop injecting my body with autism, before I blocked her. Yes... Vaccines don't GIVE you autism, the injections ARE autism.\n\nI just can't even, anymore.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1650416090.0},{"title":"My Kevin Boyfriend","author":"The-Broken-Puppet19","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/u6vp6y\/my_kevin_boyfriend\/","text":"Most of the time my boyfriend is a complete Chad. However, he has his moments where he is a complete Kevin. Here are just a couple of examples of how far his Kevinness can go: \n\n1. Kevin thought pickles were a subspecies of the cucumber family until just recently. For some reason, he thought that they didn't grow in Japan, proving the existence of Kappas farming them for food. \n\n2. Kevin loves eating lettuce. Not a salad. The damn head of lettuce or cabbage, with honey mustard only, eating it either like chips and dip, or an apple. \n\n3. Kevin grabs hot pans of food from the oven, without protection, because he can't feel the heat. He thought turning the oven light switch on was the same as turning the oven on. I still correct him on it. He rubs it in my face that I'll never taste a fresh cookie straight out of the oven. \n\n4. Kevin tries to use chopsticks with EVERYTHING. He's eaten ice cream, with a fork, balanced by the chopsticks. He peeled a banana while using chopsticks to hold it. \n\nI have to give him creativity points, but sometimes I wonder if he'll one day give me an aneurysm trying to understand his brain.

But first, please read the back-story of the last post as it is assumed you have done so. This story takes place about 5-6 months after the last one.\n\nCast: Me and Kevin (the IT team lead)\n\nWhat do you do when the battery in a UPS dies and you want to replace it?  \nMost people would schedule downtime for any devices plugged into it, buy a new battery\/UPS and swap them. Well, Kevin is not most people, and this story would not exist if that was all he did.  \n\n\nAs far as servers go, there are some that can go down without people really noticing and on the other end of the spectrum there are those that cant go down at all but for a scheduled reboot (sometimes with an uptime of years). The server for this story is, the same as the one from last, our database server (hosting about 60 DB's at the time) and falls somewhere in the middle, being critical for company operations (everything from purchase orders, punch-in punch-out times, employee HR records... were on this server. If it was in a company database, it was on this server)  \n\n\nDepending on the type of system you are intending to take down, there were different times you were allowed to do so. Because this server was used almost 24\/7, we were only allowed to take it offline on the weekends or late after hours, neither of which Kevin was inclined to do since he was salaried. The obvious solution to this dilemma was to find a way to unplug the server without shutting it down. Seems impossible, right? Well, not to a trained and seasoned Kevin its not.  \n\n\nThe [Dunning-Kruger effect](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dunning\u2013Kruger_effect) in short says that people with limited knowledge about a topic believe themselves to be far more knowledgeable than they are. This was most assuredly the case for this Kevin. You see, snice you can plug a server into any 120v outlet, this must mean that they are all the same, right? WRONG, very very wrong.  \n\n\nThe U.S. electrical system (in simple terms) has a bunch of 240v transformers that create a neutral and 2 positives, each 120v off the neutral. Think of it like a line with each end being 120v and the mid-point being the neutral. When each of the 120v phases are in-phase, the other is out-of-phase so combining them in the same wire creates a 240v potential, not a 120v. (I'm a software engineer, any electricians have a better analogy?)  \n\n\nAnyway, Kevin's solution to not shutting down the server was to cut the insolation on the servers power cable, and solder on another plug, then plug that one in before unplugging from the UPS. This would have worked if the 2 120v plugs he used were on the same phase, well, they were not and according to the security camera footage the server was less than happy. But i'm getting ahead of myself.  \n\n\nThere i was, at my desk, finishing up some work to an application (To allow PLC's to talk to our DB, if anyone is interested) when, same as last time, flashing computer screens, text messages, slack messages, and of-curse the air raid siren all beckon my attention informing me of the long and stressful evening ahead. I am pleased to see that the application is informing that only one system is down, but brace myself as this is our database server. I try to open a connection to the DB, and sure enough my connection is timing out. Over to the server room i go, yet again.  \n\n\nBefore i even enter the room i can hear UPS's beeping informing that the power is out and they are running on battery. In short, this is going to get worse before it gets better if not resolved quickly. I pull out my phone to dial our electrician and before i can place the call i enter the server room. I see Kevin with his back toward me, our mobile work cart which has been setup with a soldering iron, a plug with black scorch marks all around it and a server still smoking from whatever crap just went down in here.\n\nAs i approach, in shock, wondering how soldering shutdown an battery backed-up server i am stunned to see that this perfectly functional power cord has been modified into an abomination that i am sure OSHA would have some choice words for. In a fit of rage (which in hind sight was totally unprofessional) i shout at Kevin to get out and i will take care of it before having the mental clarity to get HR\/Safety involved. You see, as a manufacturing firm we have robots, mills, drills, fork lifts, presses and more all of which will gladly destroy any part of you that get between them and where they want to go, usually our safety personal were supervising employees on camera to ensure that no-one was breaking procedure in a way that could get them or someone else hurt or worse. Today, they were going to join me in the server room.  \n\n\nI make a couple of calls, block off the server room with red danger tape akin to that used by police to mark a crime scene, and pull up the camera footage on my phone and just wait, not wanting to touch anything until directed to do so and informed safe by our safety and electrical teams.  \n\n\nIt takes them about 5 minutes to arrive and i hardly needed to say a word as the electrician pieced together what must have been going on. And described the danger of such a procedure to Safety and HR. Then i queued up the camera footage and showed about the last 30 seconds of the clip before the server was plugged in (frankly i'm shocked that he didn't short the 2 leads in the servers power cable during the process of soldering them).  \n\n\nNeedless to say, no-one was happy, a company of 300 employees all contacting their managers about system down time, managers contacting the GM\/owner about missed deadlines if things don't get back up and running, GM\/Managers\/Owner yelling at me\/Kevin about what happened, HR\/Electrician\/Safety yelling at Kevin about how dumb of a move this was... It went on for about 10 minutes before everyone had said their piece.\n\nSafety had to do an investigation that took a couple of hours before we were even able to get our server to try to triage it, and , to no-ones surprise, the PSU was dead, cooked beyond hope. At that point, i just decided to go and get the backup server and port over a DB backup and go from there.  \n\n\nMoral of the story, hire in intern to supervise your Kevin (even if he is the team lead).  \n\n\nOutcome, Kevin (finally) lost his server room permissions and permissions to do any physical work on any system without prior written approval from someone else on the team, and we seldom gave that permission insisting it was easier to do the work ourselves than to clean up the mess left behind by Kevin.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1650129603.0},{"title":"I don\u2019t know, I never met him!","author":"iiS4R4HxXx","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/u53tfp\/i_dont_know_i_never_met_him\/","text":"I forgot to post another story about an old friend of mine she wasn\u2019t the brightest, but this one I heard from my sister is was a conversation they had about drinks like spirits a liquor, here\u2019s how it went \n\nSister: I love a glass of wine after a long day.\n\nKevin friend: oh me too sometimes if I don\u2019t want something too strong I usually go for a vodka and coke.\n\nSister: do you like Jack Daniels?\n\nKevin friend: I don\u2019t know?

He's 24M and still living at home. For context I'm 19M and at college right now but I live in town so still drop by the house frequently to meet Kevin and my parents. \n\nThis week, Kevin did one of his most egregious acts yet. My mom and dad were looking for a good Italian restaurant to get dinner at, and Kevin inserted himself into this. Long story short, Kevin sent them to a shoe repair shop on the OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN (40 minute drive where I live) because the shoemaker's name was Italian so he \"figured it must be a really good restaurant\". They got out to find a closed shoe store and ended up eating at Olive Garden in a nearby suburb. I found out about this when he called me to let me know I was an \"idiot\" for \"confusing him about Italian food.\" \n\nIt turns out that when I was 10 (and he was 15) I told him jokingly that Italians all own restaurants because there are a lot of Italian named restaurants in our city. This apparently stuck in his brain of jelly and I got to hear him call me a \"dildo eater\" because I \"confused him\". \n\nSo, are you saying, \"what the fuck?\" yet? Because I'm not. This is 100% par for the Kevin course. \n\n___\n\nBack in high school, there was a girl that I really liked. I was considering asking her out and Kevin overheard my conversation with my friend about it. Kevin immediately proceeds to send an email with his old school email (from when he went to the same high school a few years before) to the entire school, announcing that I \"wanted to f@ck\" this girl. Let's just say we didn't end up together. \n\n___\n\nKevin believed that chickens invented electricity because he heard about \"battery cages\" and thought they were a natural power source. \n\n___\n\nIn another incident when I was 10, I was playing little league baseball one afternoon and my parents were at the game watching. They told Kevin to stay home if he wanted (he hated baseball and preferred surfing the internet and causing trouble). As the park was only five minutes from home walking, we walked, leaving the car with Kevin. \n\nRight as the game was ending, Kevin drives into the dirt parking lot of the little ballpark and DRIFTS LIKE FAST AND FUCKING FURIOUS, probably 75mph+, skidding into the light metal guardrail around the parking lot and knocking it over. It ended up completely ruining the paint on that side of the car, but there was thankfully no serious damage. As he gets out of the car, he yells in front of the horrified families, \"[OP Last name] FAMILY TAXI SERVICE!\" \n\nThe kicker? He explained to me in the car, \"you said you wanted to be a pro ballplayer right? Don't you want a driver?\" \n\n____\n\nLast year, Kevin convinced my dad to give him $2000 (a serious amount of money for us) to \"invest\". Instead, Kevin spent it creating a website for and promoting a fake business offering \"sky-diving lessons\". He booked 30 people for classes, invited them out to a small local airport, then told them the plane wouldn't be available that day (he never rented one). Instead, he suggested jumping from a nearby cell tower. He then gave everyone their \"parachutes\", which was a backpack filled with a refund of their class fee. He was making a stupid video the whole time that he still laughs at. I still don't get why it was funny? \n\n___\n\nLast year at Thanksgiving, Kevin waited until the end of dinner to announce that he \"fucked the Thanksgiving turkey\". He explained that this was a meme online and proceeded to laugh loudly at my parents for not knowing about the meme, and thinking he actually fucked the turkey. Even I didn't but he just assumed i did. \n\n___\n\nSpeaking of Turkey, when the Ukraine war broke out Kevin asked me (in a 2:30 AM phone call) if this meant Istanbul would be renamed Constantinople \"when Russia takes it\". I told him Istanbul was in turkey, not Ukraine, but he insisted he saw on YouTube once that it was in Ukraine and that I was \"fucking the history professor while high on crack\" if I thought otherwise. \n\n___\n\nKevin also told me that \"god wouldn't have made people taste good if he didn't want us to eat them\". I haven't slept well since.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1649918061.0},{"title":"My IT teacher Mrs. Ing. Bc.

Also excuse my english as it is not only my L1 but I am also trying to translate\/explain things that kinda do not always have nise equivalents in english or if they do I do not know them. \nAlso formating on phone.\n\nIn my country we have the school system such that there is a \"basic\" school, 9 yrs mandatory, and then optional \"middle school\" from about 15 to 19, where you get your matura exam done so you get better job options (some have mature mandatory) and it is also mandatory to pass it to get to any uni.\n\nMy \"middle school\" had at the time three study fields or branches (or what to call these) for students - IT, machanical engineering and technologies lyceum - the last one was basically just jack of all trades maths focused thingy made for ppl who just wanna go to uni.

She was kind of against us using computers in the computer classroom, wanted us to use paper for nonsensical stuff.\n\nShe was not taken seriously by many of the misbehaving adolescent boys, but she seemed oblivious to it or unable to comprehend that?\nShe had no respect, I admit, these kids been assholes for no reason, but she did not get that.\nOnce such a butthole boy made a bet he is going to larp he has coprolalia in her class. (as I said - adolescent buttholes) She did not notice he does this to troll her. She got shocked and insulted as the faintibg ladies in the stereotypical old movies do, and then said \"You... you... you vulgarian!\" (my attempt at translating a non-existing word)\n\nShe once asked if we are here bc we have to (to get the matura exam you had to attend classes) or bc \"we want to learn something new\" expecting the latter to be the obvious answer (laughter was the answer).\n\nShe made a very basic powerpoint presentation about malware from which she just read, trying to make misbehaving teen students focus on that and make notes on paper about it. \nI do not know if she made it herself or not.\nShe read the presentation as if the things in it been new to her, and eagerly tried to draw our attention to the proper english pronunciations she read from the presentation that stated among other things that backdoor is pronounced as with 'oo' sound as in \"moon\" and without the 'k' sound.\nThis became her nickname in our class.\n\nI recall we told our math teacher about Kevina's teaching, bc the math teacher tried to reflect on something in math being related to IT suff we might know. \nShe regretted not teaching us instead of Kevina.\n\nKevina's husband was also a teacher there, he was not a Kevin, he was bit of a control freak butthole to students tho.\n\nI do not remember much else but I can ask some ex classmates if they do remember something I don't.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1649953062.0},{"title":"Kevin on a hiking trip","author":"__helloworld123__","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/u3cgbv\/kevin_on_a_hiking_trip\/","text":"So I just found this sub and it made me think about an experience I had some years ago while hiking on the Untersberg in Austria \/ Germany (not sure where the border is exactly).

And then he straight up asked us whether this hole was a shortcut to the a mountain hut further down the mountain (the Toni Lenz H\u00fctte) and was really adamant about going down this hole. Of course we urged him to stay on the path and not enter any caves without any gear \/ experience \/ plan.

Relevant to this story is an application to monitor our network and servers. It was a lightweight application that ran on my office computer and monitored all critical servers\/networking equipment (database, website, phone system (PBX), phone\/fax-line VoIP converter, domain servers, backup servers, networking switches\/routers\/firewall, VPN...) you get the idea, if it was on the network and important, my application made sure it was online. If for any reason it went down, all IT staff were immediately notified via text and Slack message and a monitor in the IT office dedicated to this application showed which systems were down, and guessed on what single point of failure could be the cause if multiple systems were down. Ooh and did I mention the air raid siren?  In the event that something went down it would override my computers volume control and play an emergency air raid siren to get the attention of anyone in the office.\n\nCast: Me, and Kevin the IT team lead.  \n\n\nIt was a cloudy afternoon sometime in mid-January about 4:30, I was staring out the window of my office considering heading out early for the day and thinking about what I was going to have for dinner when I got home. Suddenly, I am drawn back to reality by an air raid siren blaring in the office, seconds later I receive slack and text notifications indicating that most of our equipment is down. Surely this must be a mistake? A bug that was never caught when developing this program? Right?\n\nI look at the included list of the disconnected systems and quickly conclude that, if accurate, this is a huge issue. I open a terminal and attempt to ping some of the down equipment with the few IP addresses that I can remember in the moment, sure enough, none of them are responding. I look over to the application and silence the alarm, and see that it is unable to determine which device could be causing this failure.\n\nFrom experience I know that this means that there are multiple devices down. I quickly glance at the list of devices and conclude that they are all across into our second building, I breathe a slight sigh of relief thinking there is a chance that one of our fiber optic transceivers had just died, or a wire has been cut.\n\nI rush across the parking lot, past numerous people trying to interrupt and tell me that they cant seem to access the database, or that their calls cut out, or internet is down and so on, ignoring them all since I already know that the issue lies ahead into the server room. I enter bracing for what lies ahead, as I enter the room, the first thing I notice is that it is eerily quiet.\n\nFor anyone unfamiliar with servers and networking equipment, they are loud, numerous fans spinning as if trying to takeoff like a helicopter, but not today, not now. Something is seriously wrong, I think to myself as I round the corner. Next thing I see is Kevin, standing in front of me, I briefly think to myself: wow, he got here fast, before ever noticing the wile-e-coyote-after-running-off-a-cliff like look on his face and the vacuum cleaner in his hand.\n\nNo! Surely he isn't that dumb, right? (For context our servers ran on multiple dedicated 20AMP circuits each using aprox. 15-17 AMPS, each with a battery backup(UPS) for if we lost power. It takes me a second to notice him unplugging the vacuum, its plugged into one of our spray-painted-red power strips indicating that nothing should be plugged in or unplugged from this strip. instantly I know exactly what happened. the 10-12AMP vacuum paired with at least 15AMPS of servers has tripped an over-current-protection on our UPS.\n\nI share a frustrated look, and Kevin sulks out of the room and starts answering questions from the crowds gathering outside, I quickly cast a prayer to any deity wiling to listen, and start diagnosing which systems may be fried. I quickly begin bringing systems back online, first network, then internet, then phone intentionally leaving our servers and DB's for last as i'm sure some of them will not start back up. When i get to the DB server, i am not at all surprised that 14 of our 60 DB's are corrupted from the loss of power with active clients.\n\nAt this point I begin reassessing my life choices, wondering why I didn't leave when I had the chance. and begin the hours long process of recovering from a backup and trying to merge that with any non corrupted records from the databased that would not boot up. By midnight I had them all back up, and everything was humming along as if nothing had happened. I got some nice OT, and Kevin learned a valuable lesson on following procedures, right?

It was in the descriptive advertisement part of the packaging, describing the cheese as decadent. \nAgain, I'm not the smartest person so I assumed she just misread the word and once I pronounced it to her properly, she would understand.\n \"No, 'decadent' is what it says.\" I said with a smile, careful not to make her feel silly. But she just stared at me and said \"well okay, so what is that?\" I was shocked. She was old...how had she gone her whole life without hearing this word?? I explained that it was just a descriptive word meaning it was rich in flavor and essentially just good cheese.

So I entered this eatery at 11:20, went to the counter and asked for some lasagna. The young woman on the other side of the counter looked at me as if I just asked her to solve Schrodinger's equation, glanced over her shoulder at the manager who saw her, sighed, got up and came. This is how it went (not the exact words because this is translated from French) :\n\nWorker : - The gentleman asked for lasagna\n\nManager : - That's OK it's the first hot dish of the day you'll just have to pre-heat the oven first\n\nWorker : - Eerrrm and where are the lasagnas?\n\nM : - In the fridge\n\nWorker (Walks to the fridges, there are only 2 of them and they have glass doors) : - Which one?\n\nM : - The right one\n\nW (opens up the right fridge) : - Where ?\n\nM : - Middle section, it's the wooden boxes with \"Lasagna\" written on it...\n\nW (searches for 10 solid seconds and picks up a box with \"lasagna\" written on it) : - This one ?\n\nM : Yes...\n\nW (opening the oven): Should I open the box before putting it in the oven ?\n\nM : Yes but as I just told you you have to pre-heat it first !\n\nThe manager then proceeds to show her how to pre-heat and operate the oven and leaves. I go on my computer and work for a bit. 30min later I realize in only have 10min left to eat. I remind the worker that I'll have to go  in less than 10min (I had already told her in the beginning). She answers she's really sorry and it will be ready soon... and the proceeds to take the lasagna out of the oven, and put it in the microwave.  I assume she didn't manage to make the oven work and didn't want to ask the manager..? She then sets the timer for 5 FULL MINUTES at the default full power (the portion wasn't really big).\n\nAs i was going to object my coworker calls me and tells me he's there early. I hang up the call after 3min and tell the worker I have to leave now. She says she's sorry and runs to the microwave to take my lasagna out. She obviously burns herself on the steaming hot box of lasagna.

I feel bad about making her feel bad, and tell her that's a good choice, credit unions are great, I really like mine too.\n\nShe asks when I'm leaving to deposit my check , I say I'm really lucky be a member of the employee credit union and already walked by the office on campus to deposit it.\n\nKevina gets excited!  There a credit union here??  I'll just go there to deposit my check.\n\nThis confuses me.  I thought your credit union was back in Hometown?    \n\nOh it is, but it's all the credit union, so I can use the branch here.\n\nIt turns that Kevina believes all credit unions are the same institution.

We are in a dead zone & the GPS wouldn't reroute because of no internet, so I had to look at the map manually & strategize a way there.

I can't even tell if he's messing with me or being serious. I even questioned his middle school years.\n\n---\"\n\nMe: Bro, the sun always rises at the east every morning. It's not possible for the sun to rise wherever it pleases since the earth rotates towards the east all the time. We learned this in middle school science class.\n\nKevin: Nah you're messing with me. The sun rotates around the earth in random positions. It's not always east to west. Sometimes it could be from North to South.\n\nMe: The sun doesn't rotate around the earth! The earth rotates around the sun! And it's always the same rotation around the equator!\n\n\"---\n\nI thought that his Kevin-esque has reached its limit. I thought that I had successfully cured him from his Kevin disease, but nope. Seems like I dug myself a rabbit hole that leads me to his pure Kevin form.\n\n---\"\n\nKevin: The country in Africa?\n\nMe: What are you talking about?\n\nKevin: Equator. Isn't that one of the country in Africa? Why does it rotate around one country?\n\nMe, probably twitching an eye, staring blankly at him: First of all, that's Ecuador. Second of all, it's a country in South America, not Africa. Third of all, it's equator, not Ecuador. You don't know what equator is either?\n\nKevin: Not unless it's that country, no.\n\n\"---\n\nMe, completely done by this point, pulled out my phone, and started fact checking everything we just argued about. Every answers from google 100% supporting what I said earlier, but Kevin still didn't buy it.\n\n---\"\n\nKevin: You know people can lie on the internet right?\n\nMe: But this has been proven as a fact throughout the history! People researched this over and over and over, making sure that, in fact, the earth rotates around the sun, and so the other 8 planets, at the exact same axis! Also, the earth always rotates to the east, that's why the sun comes up at the east every...single...morning!\n\nKevin, thinking for a second: Nah, you're just messing with me bro.

Since then he's been hanging out on facebook a lot of the time - and like many people his age? He's *very* susceptible to propaganda and never once learned how to evaluate a source. \n\nUnfortunately? This isn't the *usual* kind of stuff that people get \"Radicalised\" by. \n...instead of getting radicalised into a raging racist who listens to a personality whose station argued that no sane person would take seriously? He got radicalised by *PETA*. So he's become Vegangelical. \n\nHere's the sort of nonsese he has tried to convince us:\n\n* Vaccines don't cause autism - Casein does.\n* you have to skin the sheep to get the wool, When I showed him a video of how sheep are actually sheared, he insisted that was the same as skinning.\n* Sheep were also skinned *alive* for wool. Even when I showed him multiple sources for how sheep were, he said those were \"Propaganda\" and \"No different than cutting a dog's fur\". I even explained that yes, it is like cutting a poodle's hair, but like poodles it grows back. \n* You shouldn't wear Faux fur or Pleather - because it will make you want to wear the real thing. \n* Humans did not evolve to eat meat, and as a result it's empty calories. \n* Chick-Fil-A is not only bad because of their known evangelism, but because the workers consciously kill chickens themselves. \n* PETA has never killed any animals. \n* Lyme Disease is only the result of being close enough to cows that ticks can transmit a bacteria that protects cows. If you get allergic to red meat? It's because a tick transmitted the bacteria that evolved to protect cows from predators to you. \n* Chicken wings are obtained by cutting the wings off living chickens and leaving them to their fate similar to how sharks are mutilated and killed for their fins. I asked him what his source was and he said \"The BBC\". \n* Is oblivious to how much environmental damage is placed by ordering products from other countries and states. Last year he laid out a \"Sustainable diet\" for us that would have not only tripled our grocery bills, but would have required us to mail order things (That aren't even available off of Amazon) from very far away. We wouldn't be allowed to eat \"common meat substitutes\" because \"They don't actually believe in sustainability or efficiency and just want money\". The fact that these companies are in fact *charging money* went over his head.\n* The eggs bought in a supermarket were fertilised and thus could have been chickens. When I asked him to prove it by hatching one, he said it wouldn't work because they were \"Dead\" due to being stored for so long. I asked how and he didn't answer.\n* It's impossible to overcook, burn, or undercook plant-based substitutes for meat or any other kind of protein. He said this after burning an impossible burger to a crisp. \n* You shouldn't eat fake pork because it will make you want to eat \"The real thing\". \n* Antibiotics kill just as much people as they do bacteria. \n* Dingoes never attack humans - period. Even though statistically speaking you're very *very* unlikely to be harmed by a Dingo (as dingoes don't go near humans typically) the dingo attacks on Fraser Island in the past 3 years never happened \n\nI've pondered giving him some kind of a Grandpad or installing some kind of filter to keep him from looking at these sites. Every time he brings this crap up, he tells us something like \"BBC\", \"Cambridge\", \"Harvard\", \"Reuters\", some other university.

Again, I would apologize for the loss of brain cells which will occur while reading this story, but you guys asked for it so it really isn't my fault.\n\nAlso, if you are a new reader, I suggest that you go back and read my previous two posts in this sub, it will really help give you a good understanding of Donald. Now let's get started.\n\nThis story is about the time that Donald bought a truck.\nSo a few years ago, Donald had become obsessed with trucks and had saved up about $8,000 to get himself one. \n\nWell, it took him about three months of searching Craigslist but he finally found the one that he wanted. The truck that he had chosen was about 20 years old, had been spray painted camo, had no exhaust pipe, had about a two foot lift, and massive tires, along with numerous other modifications which your average person would think added nothing more to the truck than a constant sense of danger, but not Donald. Donald loved everything about that truck, which is great, and I was honestly happy for the guy, but then the stupid shit started. \n\nIt is going to take several posts to tell you all of the stupid shit that he did with and to that truck, so I am just going to tell one of the stories for now and you guys can tell me if you want to hear the rest.\n\nOn this particular occasion, Donald had come up with his own version of the saying \"when the only tool that you have is a hammer, everything is a nail\" but his version was \"when the only vehicle that you have is a truck, everything is a trailer.\" And that is exactly what he told me when I suggested that he rent a trailer to transport a junk car that he had to the junkyard. He then hooked a ratchet strap through the grill of the car and tried towing it that way. Luckily he never made it to the road because he had forgotten to release the car's emergency brake and take it out of park. So after about 10 seconds of dragging the car along at a painfully slow pace with his foot to the floor, all the while making awful grinding and skidding noises, the grill ripped straight out, and he rammed the truck into the neighbor's mailbox. Yeah, that one sucked to explain.\n\nBasically he told the guy that he thought that one of the car's tires was flat, or the brakes were just seized and needed some breaking free, and it was just putting up more of a resistance than he had expected. He was correct, the brakes were seized. That is what the emergency brake does. \n\nNow if I am being honest, I probably could have stopped him and forced him to think like a normal human being, but I was pretty pissed off that he wouldn't listen to me about the trailer and figured that he needed to learn his lesson. I guess that we can just be thankful that the only thing that he destroyed was his neighbor's mailbox. I would say that he had harmed his neighborhood reputation, but that was already too far gone to change for better or for worse.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1649349178.0},{"title":"Three time a week and twice on Sunday","author":"Ghost7579ox","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/ty9xsq\/three_time_a_week_and_twice_on_sunday\/","text":"This is a story my dad told me when I was a kid, (39 now).\n\nDuring the mid 1970's my parents worked as kitchen staff at a holiday camp called Pontins.\n\nMy dad was a chef and my mom was part of the waiting staff.\n\nOne thing you should know about my dad is that he doesn't suffer fools gladly, and hates stupid questions, or what he thinks is a stupid question.\n\nHe was at his prep station chopping some onions, when one of the kitchen porters distracted him for a moment, in that moment he accidentally chopped the tip of his finger off.\n\nActing quickly he grabbed a clean towel and wrapped it round his finger, and held his arm above his head to control the bleeding.\n\nA member of staff drives him to the A+E (ER for people across the pond) and my mom followed, he is told to sit in reception and wait to be seen by a nurse.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity the nurse finally shows up.\n\nEnter our Nurse\n\nN=nurse \n\nD=dad\n\nN: OK i have to ask you a few questions before we start, is that OK?\n\nD: sure, iv'e got a few pints to spare.\n\nN: Great thanks, so what's your occupation?\n\nmy dad sat in full chef whites.\n\nD: I'm a traffic warden.\n\nN: and what seems to be the problem?\n\nmy dad sat there with blood poring down his arm and a towel wrapped around his finger.\n\nD: I hurt my foot.\n\nN: and your sex?\n\nD: Three times a week and twice on Sunday.  \n\nI asked my mom if he really said that.\n\nshe sighed, literally facepalmed and nodded.\n\nMy mom was a nurse before she met my dad.\n\nhe said stuff like that a lot.\n\nAt the time these sound like a series of stupid questions, which is why my dad acted like that, but these questions actually prevent negligence and malpractice, which is why he\u2019s the Kevin.\n\nLaters\n\nEdit: thanks for the comments about how I was writing this, I told it as I was told by my dad at the time and realised it was a little insensitive, and just wanted to share a funny story.","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1649326825.0},{"title":"one of my (former) classmates asked dumb questions","author":"Particular_End3903","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/tynzbe\/one_of_my_former_classmates_asked_dumb_questions\/","text":"So Eliza(actual name) once asked what's an apple tree once.

So i thought I might share.  \n\n\nThe story basically starts with a message I received a few days ago from my landlord.   \n\"*Hey OP, are you home on thursday morning around 10am? We need access to your balcony. Kind regards, Kevin*\"\n\nTo which I kindly responded:  \n\"*Hello Kevin, no I am not home until few weeks after that. What is it about? I could arrange letting you in.*\"\n\nI was confused at first about this because also my landlord was INSIDE my apartment a few days ago (when I also wasn't home, but my neighbor let him in) to check something on the balcony.  \nMy neighbor letting him in (without letting me know first) wasn't much of a problem for me.  \nBut it got me thinking now that he sent me this message.  \n\n\nSo his wife got back at me with this   \n\"*Hi OP, this is Kevina and we are taking part in a survey to measure air quality \/ pollution in our city. We are installing a measuring station on your balcony.\"*  \n\n\nMy first reaction was like: *\"huh? why? what? Do I get to say something against this? Will this affect my balcony \/ view?!\" \\*confused nick young-meme\\**\n\nBut since I couldn't be there anyway I just texted him back: \"*Sorry Kevina, please contact my neighbor if he could let you in. In case he is home at the aforementioned date.*\"  \n\n\nI know that my neighbor would not let him in (because I told him not to), but I wanted to be kind and see if we could rearrange so I could be physically home to see what they are doing to my apartment\/balcony.  \n\n\nThe next message caught me off-guard and this is what I have been giggling about the most since that:  \n\"*Hi OP, We would need your WIFI + Password for the measurement station. Could you please send it to us?*\"\n\nAgain my initial reaction: *\\*confused nick young-meme\\**\n\nI won't give him access to my WiFi under any circumstance (especially not for free lol) so I basically just texted him\n\n*\"Hi Kevin, I don't have WiFi. Sorry.\"* Which is technically true since I share the cost \/ wifi with my neighbor.\n\nMoving on until today (this has been a back-and-forth for like a week) - the day they wanted to install the station.  \n\n\nMy neighbor receives a text message this morning (note: he has not been contacted by my landlord whatsoever until this point):  \n\"*Hey neighbor, today at 1pm I, the technician, need access to your neighbors apartment. Also I need your WiFi + Password for this.*\"\n\nAgain: \\**confused nick young-meme\\**\n\nHe then texted him: \"*Sorry I am not home. What is it about?\"*  \nTo which the technician dude then replied: *\"Your landlord told us he arranged an appointment at 1 Pm today and we are here to install a measurement station.\"*  \n\n\nTo which he then replied: *\"I don't know about any of this. I am not home.\"* (well I told him everything but my landlord never did... so...)  \n\n\nUntil now this is the end of the story. The technician did not show up (why would he.. nobody is home anyway) and my landlord has not been texting me again.  \n\n\nThe audacity to basically demand WiFi + Password from his tenants for something he will most likely earn money with (or get a tax deduction), while not taking actions against any issues in our house baffles me. This is what makes this a Kevin + Kevina story for me.  \n\n\nI hope you enjoy this story as much as I did. I still cant stop giggling when I think about this and I hope I can still giggle when this goes on to round 2. I guess they still want to install that station :-D","upvote_ratio":0.8,"created_utc":1649339827.0},{"title":"My sister might actually be a bit of a Kevina","author":"PudgyElevator","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/txfha9\/my_sister_might_actually_be_a_bit_of_a_kevina\/","text":"I've known about this sub for a while, but recently started reading tons and tons of stories from here and I started thinking about my sister that I love so dearly.\n\nLet me start with saying that legally she's slightly intellectually impaired (basically caused learning difficulties in school, she was too slow for normal classes but excelled better than anyone in her special ed classes), so nobody would know unless it was mentioned as it doesn't affect her social intelligence.We're the best of friends, no one knows me better than her and no one knows her better than me, but there's still things she does or says that baffles me and I don't understand where it comes from.\n\n* From a very young age she learned how to pinch people with her toes. Why did she need this skill? That will be a mystery for the rest of my life. *When I share a couch with her I can't sit close to her if she has her legs resting up on the couch towards me.*\n* A couple years ago she had bought some expensive shoes (100-200 usd or something) which ended up being a bit too big for her feet so she asked me if I wanted them. As I was about to try on the shoes to see if they fit she said \"If they don't fit you I'll just throw them away\", considering that we weren't able to buy expensive things when young and basically grew up with anti-waste in order to save money I suggested that she could donate the shoes (i.e. to a shelter for homeless, poor, etc) and her response was in a tone as if I had said something really offensive \"Wtf no?! I paid XXX amount for those shoes! Why would I give them away to some random person?\" *They fit me btw, very comfy shoes*\n* Recently she's been complaining about wanting to hang out *(a lot I might add. I've gotten too comfortable with staying at home thanks to 2020 I'm so sorry sis)*. One day she sends me a link about a store that has opened up in a town nearby. It's a japanese themed store and seems to have a lot of cute stuff and even candy. I respond with saying how cool it is and asks if she's interested in going there too. She tells me yes and I, in an attempt to be the one to get myself outside and meet her, ask her \"Any specific day that you wanted?\" I don't know if it's normal to ask it like that in English but me being without a job atm and her living a couple hours away + studying I guess it basically meant \"Let's do it, just tell me when you're available\" and she knows this, but she replies with \"No\". That's all she said. One week later she complains about wanting to hang out.\n* One time her and her boyfriend bought a lil puppy. Poor little guy didn't adjust well with the city, was so scared by the outside world. I.e. he would try and attack bikes passing by cause they scared the shit out of him. My sister returned the puppy very early. My dad was a professional dog trainer for 30+ years (and we've seen him turn some really bad cases into a lot better ones on older dogs), she didn't mention anything about the puppy to him.\n* She woke me up in a panic to tell me she had overslept for her appointment that day. It turned out to be 3 am so I said she was fine and to go back to sleep, I guarantee that I was very bitter at how fast she could fall back asleep once I said those words.\n* I don't really know if this would count as a Kevina thing but to this day nobody, not even her, has been able to figure out how it happened and we've all agreed that it's only because it's her that it managed to happen. When we were very young she was trying to climb over a very tall metal fence. She was at the top of the fence, slipped and the back of her knee slammed into a metal bar that was sticking out. She was bleeding heavily at the top of her knee, everyone was 100% sure that it had gone through from the back but- No, the damage was only at the top of her knee.\n\nThere's so many years of my life to unpack and rethink whether it was a \"stupid shit young girls do\" or a Kevina thing, but for now I'd like your opinions on if my suspicion is valid or not.Now excuse me as I need to go and be a good sister again and hang out with her more *if she'll say yes this time.*  \n\n\nETA: She's 27, not a teenager","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1649225336.0},{"title":"The Kevins of r\/kevin are adding their name to r\/place","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/tvbifg\/the_kevins_of_rkevin_are_adding_their_name_to\/","text":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Kevin\/comments\/tv8air\/can_i_get_help_making_this_a_thing_in_rplace\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf","upvote_ratio":0.89,"created_utc":1648998875.0},{"title":"My brothers and their total Kevin Moment","author":"Competitive_Ad3474","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/tuqy31\/my_brothers_and_their_total_kevin_moment\/","text":"So, I have four brothers, but two of them have nothing to do with this story.

Fortunately, the tedium was occasionally relieved by the antics of some of my coworkers, the above-mentioned Kevin and Kevina. Now, they were generally nice people overall, but essentially, they were both dumber than a bag full of hammers. Anyway, on to the stories:\n\n**Kevin fails American geography**\n\nKevin is apparently setting up a new account for a customer, and asks me, \"Hey Bela, what state is Washington D.C. in?\"\n\nMe: \"What do you mean, what state is it in? It's not in any state.\"\n\nKevin: \"Sure it is - it has to be in a state.\"\n\nMe: \"No Kevin, it's not. Here's a hint - what does the 'D.C.' in 'Washington D.C.' stand for?\n\nKevin: \"I dunno... I have no idea.\"\n\nMe: \"The District of Columbia. It's a separate federal district.\"\n\nKevin: \"So it's its own state, right?\"\n\nMe: \"No, Kevin, not a state - a federal district. It doesn't even get its own star on the flag.\"\n\nWe went on in this vein for a while, and I'm still not sure that Kevin ever grasped the concept of the District of Columbia. I didn't dare try to ask him if New Mexico was part of Mexico. I'm not that cruel.\n\n**Kevina does not know who the current President is**\n\nThis happened in the summer of 1989. The previous November had seen the Presidential election, where Bush had defeated Dukakis. Somehow, Kevina and I had gotten on the topic of the election, where she declared that she \"really didn't follow politics that much\".\n\n\"Well, did you vote?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, I didn't bother,\" Kevina replied. (Slight pause.) \"So who won, anyway? Was it Dukakis?\"\n\nYes, folks - 8 months after the election, and 6 months after the inauguration, Kevina had no idea who the President of the United States was, but she thought it might be Michael Dukakis.\n\nIt's probably just as well she didn't vote.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1648780997.0},{"title":"the adventures of Donald, chapter 2: Donald gets a job at Best Buy.","author":"ronaldHucklebee","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/tszjpp\/the_adventures_of_donald_chapter_2_donald_gets_a\/","text":"Hey everyone, it's Ron back with another story about Donald. And remember, it's not my fault if you lose brain cells while reading this, you guys asked for more. Now, for new readers, if you are wondering why I am calling him by his name and not Kevin, go back and read my previous post in this group, but the short version is that he wants me to use his name online.\nNow this story is about the time that Donald tried working at Best Buy, hope you enjoy, his boss did not.\n\nSo Donald had recently been fired from his job as a landscaper (I don't know why, I don't want to know why) and was now looking for work. A family friend was a manager at our local Best Buy, and was stupid enough to offer Donald a job to get him by while he looked for something more permanent. Donald accepted.\n\nHis job was supposed to be simple things like sweeping the floors and stocking the shelves, but he was also allowed to help customers when needed... until somebody asked Donald for help finding a smartphone. Donald informed the customer that flip phones would actually be the better option. When the customer said that no, they actually wanted a smartphone, Donald smugly refused to help them find what they needed, and was soon yelling at the customer that they had insulted his knowledge of electronics (of which he has none) by suggesting that they needed something other than what Donald liked. The manager quickly brought Donald to the back office to cool off, and warned him that if he ever yelled at a customer again, he would find himself unemployed. He then moved Donald to working in inventory where he thought that he couldn't cause any harm. He was wrong.\n\nAt some point in the next couple of days, Donald overheard the manager say that laptop sales where slightly lower this month than they had hoped they would be.\nSo Donald, being the great employee he was, decided to take it upon himself to fix this problem.\n\nDonald then printed out posters claiming rediculous deals like \"buy one laptop of any price, get three free\" and placed them all over the store when nobody was looking. That caused some confusion.\n\nWhen the manager figured out what was going on, and asked Donald why he had done this, Donald explained that now they now sold four computers to people who only wanted to buy one. The manager then had to explain to Donald that they had  to make profit on those computers to which Donald replied \"oh, I thought that we just wanted to get rid of them.\"\nAnd then he was informed that he was fired.\n\nSo that is the story of Donald's employment at Best Buy. This is a second hand story which I have heard both from his manager, and Donald himself. Both stories line up so I can only assume that this is pretty accurate. \n\nAgain, let me know if you want to hear more.

It\u2019s a small job but i really do enjoy it, and my younger sister (15) also works there as well. \n\nFor a while i had quit to pursue another job that paid a bit better, but it didn\u2019t end up working out as i absolutely hated it and i ended up returning to the cafe. \n\nBefore i left, i\u2019d worked at least 7-8 months here, so it didn\u2019t take me very long to fit back in. all that was really different was the new storage room and a few new employees i hadn\u2019t met. \n\nEnter the Kevin. \n\nHe was about 15-16, young lad from my school that i\u2019d never really met before. my younger sister who never left said he was a piece of work, and i was yet to discover just what he was about. and seeing as we were short on older junior staff at that time, my boss, who we\u2019ll call M, asked me to show him what to do and what not. \n\nhere we have the first instance. so an afternoon shift starts at about 3:15, meaning that i have to walk from school directly to the cafe which was never an issue for me given the weather was okay. M never made us change out of our school uniforms given it was only a clean up shift and we didn\u2019t have to serve anyone. i show up on time, but there\u2019s no kevin. i think \u201cokay, i\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be here in a few minutes, i\u2019ll just start on dishes\u201d. \n\nthe kid ended up being 20 minutes late and came in with an iced coffee and a chocolate bar. M scolded him for being late and he complained that he was hungry. fine, i don\u2019t care, just as long as he helps me out here. i tell him that he can start sweeping out the kitchen, as i\u2019ve already done all the dishes, and i\u2019ll vacuum. i told him that while he was at it, he could sanitize the kitchen too, which included cleaning out the dishwasher, wiping down benches, etc. i left to go vacuum out the empty restaurant while M was in her office in the storage room. took me no more than 15 minutes, and when i came back into the kitchen Kevin was standing there on his phone like there wasn\u2019t still things to do. i frustratedly told him to fill up the mop bucket, trying to keep my cool as it was almost past the time i usually end my shift, meaning i\u2019d have to stay longer. while he did that, i went and brought all the tables and stuff in from the pavement, thankful that the aussie hot weather hadn\u2019t kicked in because it was a tough job on its own. \n\nonce i\u2019m done with that, i go back inside thinking that while i was doing that, he would\u2019ve mopped the restaurant out. \n\nagain. he was sitting on his phone, only there was a full mop bucket at his side. \n\n\u201cwhat the hell Kevin?\u201d i asked, trying to keep cool, \u201ci thought i told you to mop the restaurant\u201d\n\u201cno, you only told me to fill the bucket up,\u201d he said, irritated that he had to look away from his phone, \u201cyou didn\u2019t tell me to mop\u201d\n\u201cthat part was implied,\u201d i said through gritted teeth, it taking everything to hold me back from calling i\u2019m a fucking moron. \n\nHe only huffed in annoyance as he pushed past me with the mop bucket and went into the restaurant. With my own huff of annoyance, i checked around the kitchen to make sure he\u2019d sanitized everything. there wasn\u2019t any problems until i noticed the fridge switches were off. the kid had accidentally switched them off while wiping them down, and if i hadn\u2019t found it we would\u2019ve had to throw out a good heap of food. i made a note to myself to let M know about it so she could handle the situation and went out to the restaurant to see how he was going.\n\nThis absolute moron had mopped himself into a corner and tracked his dirty shoes through his already shitty mop job. honestly i almost lost it at that point. \n\n\u201cKevin, you can\u2019t just walk through the places you\u2019ve already mopped, you\u2019re leaving footprints.\u201d\n\u201chow else am i supposed to get around to mop?\u201d\n\u201cyou mop from the front of the restaurant to the back, and then wait for it to dry. it\u2019s not a hard concept to grasp.\u201d\n\u201cwell why don\u2019t you do it then?\u201d\n\u201cbecause, kevin, we were both rostered on for today. that means we\u2019re both working, genius.\u201d \n\u201cyou don\u2019t have to be a cow OP.\u201d\n\nat that point i could feel the steam coming out of my ears. without a thought, i stomped up to the kid and snatched the mop out of his hands, telling him to just go to the kitchen. he did without a word, and i mopped the restaurant myself. \n\n\nthat day was only the start. \n\n\nperhaps the worst case was a weekend day shift. some poor customer was unfortunate enough to have Kevin serving them their meal. at the cafe we have two chefs - A, the strict scary chef, and MM, the fun nice chef. that day we had A. \n\nsince i was busy, A asked kevin to serve, which he went and did. as he came back into the kitchen, i peeled through the door and saw there was a table that needed to be cleared, so i headed out. \n\nthat\u2019s when i was stopped by this elderly woman, who called for me politely. \n\n\u201cexcuse me,\u201d she called.\n\u201chow can i help you, ma\u2019am?\u201d \n\u201ci think someone in your kitchen touched my food,\u201d she said, pointing to it. \n\ni look down and to my horror i saw a thumb sized hole in her toasted sandwich. \n\n\u201ci\u2019m so sorry ma\u2019am,\u201d i apologised, \u201cdo you know who served you?\u201d\n\u201ca young blonde boy.\u201d\n\nOf course. it was Kevin. \n\n\u201ci\u2019ll have your meal remade right away ma\u2019am,\u201d i said, taking her plate and rushing back into the kitchen. \n\ni told A about the situation, and when i tell he was mad, i mean he was really mad. he glared a hole through Kevin\u2019s head and then proceeded to scream at him, telling him that this meal was gonna come out of his paycheck. while he screamed at kevin, i watched as another junior, R, who was in my grade, timidly took the meal and made a new one based off of it. Kevin wasn\u2019t allowed to serve food for the rest of the day, and was stuck with clearing tables only as well as having to clean up the pavement by himself too. \n\n\ni have some more stories, but i\u2019m too tired to write them rn, so if you\u2019re interested please tell me n i\u2019ll provide some more. thank you :)\n\n\nedit: \n\nso this got a bit popular for it being my first post n it made me happy so here\u2019s a few more little tales. these will also include his Kevina sister i mentioned in the comments. \n\nalso i thought i\u2019d clarify this kid does know what he\u2019s supposed to be doing by this point, he\u2019s been in the job for at least 5-6 months during most of these stories and is just an absolute treat in the workplace. \n\nto begin, it was a somewhat normal day. the juniors typically do small jobs like dishes and cleaning, and that\u2019s what myself and kevin were doing at that time. the system was that dishes get washed by hand, then put through the dishwasher, and then they get polished to put away. that day, we had MM as the chef and either M or A was always at the cafe considering they were a married couple and ran the cafe together. M was there that day. MM asked Kevin to go serve food and while he was at it clear some tables, and because i needed the dish rack, i went on to polish the dishes myself. M comes into the kitchen and she stares down at the pile of plates next to me. \n\n\n\u201cOP, you see this?\u201d she asked picking up a plate. \n\non it was a smudge of leftover food. this often happened when the chefs hurriedly threw plates and other things straight onto the dish rack and whoever was washing dishes didn\u2019t have time to wash it off properly. as a polishers job it was their job to pick up on if any dishes weren\u2019t properly washed so they could be sent through the dishwasher again. \nthe dish in my hands was the first dish i myself had picked up in that moment. \n\n\u201cthis could kill someone. it could cause really bad food poisoning and put us at risk of being sued.\u201d\n\n\u201ci\u2019m so sorry M, but this stack of dishes wasn\u2019t me,\u201d i reasoned, \u201ckevin was polishing dishes until he had to go serve food.\u201d\n\na wave of realization washed over her face, and she sighed, apologizing to me before going to give Kevin that same lecture. \n\ncoming back to the aussie weather, that day was a horrid heat wave, being in the midst of summer. Kevin was still polishing and putting some dishes away, and i told him that once he was done he could come help me clear the pavement. \n\n\ni went out in that 33 degree celsius weather and carried all those tables into the shop\u2019s alleyway myself, and i literally felt like i was gonna pass out. because there was no kevin, i came back into the shop drenched head to toe in my own sweat, and of course see Kevin leaning against the sink on his phone. \n\n\u201ckevin!\u201d i exclaimed, mad as i grabbed a piece of paper towel and wiped my face off, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you come help me with the pavement??\u201d\n\n\u201coh, i thought you had it covered,\u201d he shrugged, not even looking up from his phone.\n\n\nMM looked at me like he was holding back laughter, as he always liked to make jokes about Kevin and his idiocracy. \n\nbefore i could burst in all my anger, MM simply sent Kevin out to sanitize the tables in the restaurant while he told me to go sit in the air conned storage room to cool off - figuratively and literally. \n\n\nnow onto Kevina, she was a real cow. i got my first bad vibes from her when she ignored me when i first met her and said hi. i knew she heard me, she flashed her eyes at me for a split second and chose not to say anything. i was irritated but didn\u2019t bother again.\n\ni\u2019m a young woman with three facial piercings (septum, nostril, labret) - note that my work has no problems with it - and M knows me for being really into heavy metal etc. \n\nKevina started calling me \u201cemo girl\u201d because of not only my style but my negative attitude towards her. she thought i had this attitude towards everyone, but it was very much just for her. no matter how many times i told her not to call me it, she\u2019d always order me around by first calling out \u201chey emo girl.\u201d every time she did, i was one step closer to shoving my head in the dishwasher and closing it hard on my neck. \n\non a few occasions she\u2019d cry after i asked her to do the dishes, because \u201ci broke my nail and the hot water hurts it\u201d or \u201ci\u2019m not feeling well\u201d. like i\u2019m not talking a few tears, i\u2019m talking full on sobbing. and because i tend to get uncomfortable when people around me that i barely know cry (bc im neurodivergent) i simply go along with it and let her do whatever job she wants, which is usually the basics.\n\nshe feels the need to try and insert herself into every conversation i have with the senior workers, especially our joke conversations, for example:\n\n\nA: oh yeah, everything on the internet is 100% true\n\nOp: yeah like the earth is flat. \n\nA: yeah and the sun isn\u2019t real and neither is australia \n\nOp: oh true we\u2019re all just paid actors\n\nKevina: you know he\u2019s joking right, op? \n\n\nwe both look at her absolutely perplexed.\n\n\nOp: uh\u2026 yeah, i know. so was i. \n\n\n\nshe always felt the need to be the favorite, at the top, the goody two shoes, but really she was no one\u2019s favorites. \n\n\nanyways, that\u2019s all i can think of right now, if i think of anything else or if anything else new happens i\u2019ll let you guys know, but for now, ciao!\n\n\n\nedit 2: \n\n\njust came back from work, Kevina asked me if i fell face first into a tackle box and started crying when no one else in the kitchen laughed at her unfunny joke.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1648639244.0},{"title":"my brother is something special","author":"ronaldHucklebee","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/trjhwa\/my_brother_is_something_special\/","text":"Hi everyone, I'm Ron, and my brother is a Kevin. I would just call him Kevin, but he has specifically requested that if I ever mention him online, for me to use his name (Donald). Why does he want me to use his name? So that he can become famous of course, but what does he do that is fame worthy? Nothing. And he knows this, and will proudly tell you that he is going to be the first person to ever become famous for doing literally nothing.\n\nAnd his Kevin-ness does not stop there. His most firm belief is that laws are just suggestions. No really, he will literally tell you this with a straight face.\n\nOne time, he was trying to sell weed on a street corner which just happened to be right in front of a Catholic Church, when a priest came out and asked him to leave, he called the cops on said priest, and told the police officer \"it's a free country dude, and I have the right to sell weed wherever I want.\" Ill have you know that marijuana was not legal in this state.\n\nWhen the officer told him this, he told the officer that he just didn't understand laws as well as Donald did. I guess that the officer thought that Donald was probably mentally feeble (he isn't stupid, he just does stupid stuff) because he just confiscated Donald's weed and drove him home to tell us the story of what had happened. *The very next day* Donald tried going back to the same street corner to try and sell weed again. When I stopped him and asked him what he was doing, he replied \"the way I see it, that priest is selling his own weed, and just doesn't want me to steal his business. Well if I keep going back, then he will just have to leave. Think about it dude, why else would everyone sit through that boring speech unless they were high? Yeah... They wouldn't. And weed makes your imagination better, how could the speaker come up with all of those words if it weren't for being high.\" And when I told him that he actually read them out of a book, he told me that that actually wasn't true, and that he only held the book to make himself look more powerful. He literally thinks that if you were to look inside a Catholic Bible, it would just be blank pages, and the priest just makes shit up as he goes.\nSo that is one of my many stories about Donald, let me know if you want to hear more.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1648585994.0},{"title":"\"Amazon is my favorite store, I shop there all the time.\"","author":"singwhatyoucantsay","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/trvdhl\/amazon_is_my_favorite_store_i_shop_there_all_the\/","text":"I work at a factory with this dude.

Rotting Tuna)","author":"Drummock","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/tqtp99\/kevins_amazing_adventures_feat_rotting_tuna\/","text":"This story begins last friday, when I (26M) had taken the day off for a visit to my in-laws' house. My wife (25F) had introduced me to them before and they came to us last thanksgiving and Christmas the year before, but this was the first time we've gone up to their place, which is a six hour drive (Illinois to southern minnesota). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy brother-in-law, who's only 17, is a Kevin on a level that's hard to express. He raised hell at his two visits to our house at the holidays, but he never really got a chance to do anything because he locked himself in his room loudly watching porn. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, shortly after we arrived Friday evening and said hello to my MIL (52F) and FIL (53M). But of course, Kevin was nowhere to be seen. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo, my MIL told us, \"he's in his room.\" There were no sexual sounds this time, but we all knew. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, dinner time rolled around and my MIL had cooked a nice beef roast for us. Kevin drags his ass into the dining room, and proceeds to sit down, open a \\*fucking bag of Cheetos\\*, and pour it over his beef. These are puffy Cheetos, and he actually cried when they didn't taste good. He ate another serving, and poured Cheetos over it again, even though he knew it would be bad. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd what explanation did this paragon of intelligence give? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I didn't want to waste the Cheetos\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs dinner was finishing, my FIL asked Kevin to do the dishes, which he agreed to with suspicious agreeability. Of course, Kevin wasn't really going to \"do the dishes\". Kevin's idea of this was to wait for everyone to look away, and carry every single plate upstairs before throwing them in the bathtub and cleaning the plates with shampoo. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, that sort of served as a Kevin appetizer. Around 4am Saturday morning, my wife and I were fast asleep in the guest bedroom when Kevin opens our door, starts playing \"Wet Ass Pussy\" on his phone and loudly shouting, \"are you having sex in there?\". I tell him to please go away, not wanting to curse out my wife's brother, but she gladly does it for me, telling him to \"fuck off to his room\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I figure, things have gotten off to a bad start and this freak is going to make sexual comments about his own sister. Okay... I can brush that off. We were going to go drive to the lake and go out on my in laws boat later that morning, so I just kind of let it slide and decide along with my wife that Kevin can still come along. Big mistake. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat morning, upon arriving at the lake, Kevin jumped out of the car and ran into the lake, screaming \"I'm a duck!\". Again, more spectrum behavior than Kevin, so I just gave it a pass. Noticing a pattern?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKevin's \"skills\" raised their ugly head as we reached the middle of the lake. We begin to smell something terrible, at first we assume it's algae from the lake or something like that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut my FIL, all of the sudden, has a look of terror on his face, and I ask him what's wrong. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Look under Kevin!\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe all look, and lo and behold, this motherfucker is sitting on a \\*giant\\*, we're talking two feet deep, four feet long, two feet thick \\*vat of tuna fish\\*. Kevin goes, \"oh shit!\" and sits up, but he's covered in tuna. The vat had ruptured under his weight and our boat was now filled with rotten tuna. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, why, you may ask, was there a fucking vat of tuna on the boat? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, in Kevin's words, \"I've been buying like five cans a day from the grocery store, it's for chumming the water\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nChumming the water is a fishing technique involving pouring rotten meat into the water. Not storebought tuna. But you know the real kicker? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe weren't even fishing that day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, we get home, get cleaned up, and are eating dinner again when Kevin decides to chime in with helpful advice. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"You know, I was reading about Ukraine, and they have Molotov cocktails. We should make some Molotov cocktails since we live next to Canada and they might invade!\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI laughed, assuming it was a joke, but no, that would be too logical and actually funny. Instead, Kevin gets offended that I laughed and starts to cry about how \"nobody likes my ideas\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to Sunday morning, and FIL is cooking breakfast. Kevin walks downstairs and announces to all of us that he \"wants to know what chicken sperm looks like if their eggs are so much bigger than ours\". Our dumbfounded expressions said it all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLater, Kevin was in his room, this time playing some video game instead of watching porn. All of the sudden, I hear a LOUD bang and we run in to find him laughing into his phone camera. He explains to us, \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I was making a video and I needed a sound effect, so I fired \\[FIL\\]'s gun!\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThankfully it was a blank. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, that's a weekend with Kevin. Sorry if this post was a bit incoherent or poorly organized, I haven't slept in 48 hours.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1648536182.0},{"title":"Part 3: My girlfriend\u2019s sister is a female Kevin","author":"desk2118","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/tqsc17\/part_3_my_girlfriends_sister_is_a_female_kevin\/","text":"I (18m) recently posted about my girlfriends (18f) younger sister (14f) and how she was a female Kevin. You guys really liked the post, and asked for an update. Here are some updates from the past few weeks, as well as some more stuff we remember her doing. First I will start with the recent stuff (happened from March 1st-March 28th). Also, she was IQ tested yet again and scored average intelligence.\n\n  \nfirst post: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/t3as11\/my\\_girlfriends\\_younger\\_sister\\_is\\_a\\_female\\_kevin\/?utm\\_medium=android\\_app&utm\\_source=share](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/t3as11\/my_girlfriends_younger_sister_is_a_female_kevin\/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\n\n68. In her history class they were talking about the appointment of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the the Supreme Court, she asked what channel showed the Supeme Court, her teacher had to explain to her that they only allowed audio recordings in the court and that the justices on the Supreme Court are different types of judges then Judge Judy\n\n69. She was standing on her desk when a teacher left the room for a few minutes, she fell and bruised her leg and arm\n\n70. She tried giving the cat a cookie laced with weed to see how he'd act, her boyfriend stopped her (it didn't have chocolate so she thought they were ok)\n\n71. Her boyfriend collects old antique sports related stuff, she was playing with an antique baseball of his by throwing it up and down, and hit her head and got a small bump on her head\n\n72. She was taking a test in her science class, the unit was on astronomy, multiple choice, teacher put obvious fake answers on there, she said the International Space Station launched in 1492\n\n73. She asked why we drank cow pee. She thought milk was cow pee.\n\n74. She claimed the government was rising gas prices so we would all buy electric cars and then the government could track us. I asked her what she thought gas cost a gallon, she said $12. I also come from a very wealthy family like her, but that gives you some context into how she sees the world financially.\n\n75. She got in trouble (again) for teasing boys who said they loved each other (in a platonic way), she recorded her mocking them, posted it to tiktok and thought the boys who reported it would get in trouble for \"snitching\"\n\n76. Her teacher asked her to turn on the AC in class, she was pressing the wrong buttons and broke the machine\n\n77. She wanted to try eating rocks after seeing it on a TLC show\n\n78. This one isn't as bad, but she was confused by the term French kissing when her boyfriend mentioned how they French kissed and she said \"we've American kissed\", he was so confused by her but he clearly loves her\n\n79. She asked where McDonald's gets their clovers for the shamrock shake\n\n80. She thought extra virgin olive oil meant the olives didn't have \"plant sex\"\n\n81. Her boyfriend was watching a very long video essay on the show Victorious, she joined him and was confused at practically every joke made and it annoyed him a bit\n\n82. One of the guy\u2019s on her boyfriend\u2019s teammates likes watching old game shows, he was the 50\u2019s version of The Price Is Right with her boyfriend, she watched cause she was bored and said \u201cthe prices don\u2019t make sense\u201d, they had to explain to her that furniture in the 50\u2019s cost different then furniture today\n\nThe rest is from previous stuff me and my gf remembered, not stuff from the past month\n\n83. A few months back she licked a table at a restaurant to show COVID \"was not a big deal\"\n\n84. Her boyfriend was wearing a mask with Mao on it (as mentioned previously, since he's a Maoist), he explained to her who Mao was but she kept calling him \"China guy\"\n\n85. In 8th grade, she cheated on a History test by copying a boy word for word, the boy was the valedictorian of the 8th grade, it was immediately clear who cheated off of who based on the language he used in his free response\n\n86. When talking about plastics in the ocean she asked \"how could a bird even eat a Barbie doll\", that was the first plastic that came to her mind.\n\n87. She almost got involved in a pyramid scheme, when explaining the company to her boyfriend he had to explain it was a scam\n\n88. Over the summer she was making s'mores, her wooden stick repeatedly caught fire when no one else did\n\n89. She asked her science teacher who invented gravity\n\n90. She asked her history teacher why the government didn't just ban inflation\n\n91. She said that she had \"serious questions\" about the moon landing\n\n92. She told her boyfriends teammate that ADHD was \"made up by big pharma\"\n\n93. She once spent over 10 minutes trying to push a door open, it was a pull door, her boyfriend was so embarrassed when he arrived at the building to see what was going on\n\n94. Last summer, she was at the beach and saw a gay couple with a young boy, the couple had started talking with other family members so she asked where he was adopted from, they explained that he was biologically one of theirs and it took her a long time to understand the concept of surrogacy\n\n95. Her boyfriend was talking about WW2, she asked why we sent photos of naked people to Japan. She confused \u201cnukes\u201d with \u201cnudes\u201d.\n\nThat is all for now, but I will update at the end of April if anything else comes up (knowing her, it\u2018s bound to happen), over spring break, why her boyfriend why he stayed with her and he said he loved her, and that her prettiness played a part, he also just loves her. He\u2019s a sweet kid, I wish him a lot of luck if he has to deal with her for the rest of his life (obviously they aren\u2019t thinking about marriage yet, but who knows).

Packing pills really doesn't require more than wearing gloves and a hairnet, certain things additionally require a mask (as they produce fine powders, fumes, a nasty smell, etc.), and then there is the worst thing I ever packed: monochloroacetic acid crystals (used to burn off warts). \n\nTo pack these crystals, you had to wear a lab coat, two layers of gloves, the sleeves of the lab coat tucked into the gloves, hairnet, eye goggles, respirator  mask (ordinary masks just wouldn't cut it), you could only handle the crystals with tongs, and you carry out the packing in a special box (can't remember the name of it, but it's some kind of negative pressure box designed to prevent any dust particles of the crystals from getting into the atmosphere). You then had to shower immediately after you were done,\n\nOver the three or four times I packed them, even with all the above protection, I still once ended up with some very minor burns and a blister on my wrists (where my lab coat had come a little loose from inside the gloves and small amounts of the crystals came into contact with my skin). This didn't rate a \"reportable\" incident, just needed some Nivea cream to take the sting off, a couple of antihistamines to take care of the itchiness from a small outbreak of hives, and an examination from a doctor to confirm I was fine. \n\nNow on to the story of Kevin packing these crystals. When he started working in the department I thought Kevin was just one those people who liked to be contrary for contrary sake. He'd never wear a hairnet, he would wear gloves only if he was actually touching the medication, and the way he labelled things you'd think Stevie Wonder had done it. But boy oh boy, the monochloroacetic incident proved this was a guy did not play with a full deck.\n\nOur pharmacy lead for the day went through all of the safety precautions with Kevin, reinforcing why each one was necessary. Kevin went off to do his thing, and we all went off to do ours. I do remember we were short-handed that day. If we hadn't of been, then things almost certainly wouldn't have been quite so bad.\n\nAfter an hour or so, I was given the task to help make a cream for a patient being discharged from a ward. Due to one of the components (I can't remember, but it may have been vitamin A or vitamin E powder), it was advised that female staff shouldn't be involved in making creams using it (I think there was some kind of pregnancy risk?? - any pharmacists out there please feel free to jog my memory).\n\nIt was then that I discovered Kevin, and I hit the alarm. Kevin was unconscious on the floor, and thankfully he was breathing.  I called for the emergency medical team, and he got taken to A&E(ER), needed a bicarbonate bath to wash the acid dust off, had his eyes washed out in case any acid dust had gotten into them, had some rather nasty localised burns on his arms, had a massive outbreak of hives across his chest, and spent a week in the hospital recovering.\n\nWhen we were compiling the incident report we found out that Kevin had decided not to use most of the protective equipment because it really slowed down how quickly he could pack the crystals. Never mind all the protective gear is there to make sure you don't end up losing a layer of skin, being blinded, cooking your lungs from the inside out, or worse.\n\nEven after everything he went through, even when he sat through the various incident meetings, even when he was being followed up six weeks later to ensure he had fully recovered, he still didn't understand what happened or how he ended up in a hospital bed.\n\nThe pharmacy's safety protocols underwent a rigorous external review, and it was decided that although everything we had in place was more than adequate, one recommendation was made, and that was that when someone was packing monochloroacetic crystals in future there had to be another member of staff physically in the department.\n\nKevin was lucky to have survived as he could have been on the floor for hours before being discovered. He was even luckier to keep his job.\n\nYes, Kevin actually managed to keep his job. Although a month later, the pharmacy underwent a restructure that meant we had to lose a member of staff. We all had to apply for our own jobs, and guess who was the one member of staff who didn't?\n\nIf you said Kevin, then you are today's winner.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1648322010.0},{"title":"\"You Demand Compensation In Chicken?

It was a Saturday and we were incredibly busy when a guy came in, demanding to speak to the manager. My manager walked over to the counter to talk with the man but they were within earshot of me so I heard most of the conversation.\n\nThe man was claiming that he and his girlfriend had come in earlier and ordered boneless chicken wings (glorified chicken tender pieces) and that they made his girlfriend violently ill. My manager said he remembered their earlier order and asked to know exactly what had happened when they'd left the store. The man says they left and his girlfriend took a bite of chicken, only to see that it was cold, raw and pink in the middle.\n\nOur chicken pieces not only come pre-cooked to the store to avoid such a problem, we blast the nuggets in our huge oven, which more often than not result in complaints of OVER cooked chicken, not UNDER cooked chicken.\n\nMy manager asked if he could see the wings to confirm his story. The guy proceeds to explain that he and his girlfriend ate them all. The supposedly RAW chicken. Because \"they were so hungry.\" \n\nMy manager, being the great manager he is, offered to make it right for him with a refund. (Even though he knew this guy was lying, and very poorly, our franchise very much still believes in a \"the customer is always right\" mentality. This means we get people with crazy stories in to get free food all the time.)\n\nThe guy began yelling that he didn't want his money back, he was still hungry. My manager explained that, normally, we would happily remake an incorrect order at the customer's request but, since we had no bone-in wings (COVID shortage) and the boneless wings had, according to the Kevin been \"raw\", my manager had assumed he'd just want a refund. \n\nThe Kevin keeps screaming that he's still hungry and that he wants MORE BONELESS WINGS. The supposedly \"raw, girlfriend sickening\" wings. My manager smiled and said that since he had reported an issue with the wings, we could no longer sell them until we assured they were safe for sale. He, again, offered the refund, but the Kevin just stormed out and yelled that he'd call corporate. He stood outside, staring into the store for about 30 min until he finally left.\n\nOne of the weirdest, dumbest encounters I've ever witnessed.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1648299737.0},{"title":"Kevin thinks the Soviet Union was in America?!","author":"Big_Man_9750","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/tpvwh3\/kevin_thinks_the_soviet_union_was_in_america\/","text":"I met this Kevin when I was in the doctor's office I am an expert in geography so, I was talking about geography with Kevin and when we talked about where countries were he got every question incorrect for example, Where is the Soviet Union, where is Japan. pretty easy right he thought I was lying when I said real answers?!","upvote_ratio":0.21,"created_utc":1648423344.0},{"title":"Kevin the NPC","author":"low_myope","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/tn5glx\/kevin_the_npc\/","text":"Early in my career I used to work for a medical supplier. Basically the company would supply a wide range of items including consumables (gloves & masks), equipment (stethoscopes & pulse oximeters), first aid kits, scrubs, single use instruments amongst other things. We sold to a wide range of businesses ranging from hospitals to universities, and also would sell to the general public.\n\nWhere the company really made its' money was putting together customised packs. For example, first aid kits containing specific contents, starter kits for medical students, or simply adding business logos to equipment. It is pretty amazing how much more a hospital will pay to have \"Peak View Hospital\" emblazoned on first aid kits, pen torches etc.\n\nThe company was small, and consisted of:\n\n* Boss - Pretty much retired, only comes in to deal with some of the biggest clients.\n* Manager - Daughter of the boss, who \"works from home\" (i.e. doesn't actually do any work)\n* Receptionist - General Admin\n* Stock - Responsible for assembling all of assembling the orders, and sending them out to clients\n* Sales - I liaised with clients to determine what they needed, and what we could supply. I also chipped in a bit to help with stock.\n\nSo stock consisted of one fella (lets call him Steve) doing everything solo. Basically, without Steve, the company would've gone out of business fairly quickly. He was incredibly efficient, and never made mistakes. Even though he was only meant to assemble and send the orders, as the manager and boss were AWOL. He took it upon himself to do all of the ordering too. After being monumentally shafted by the manager, Steve pretty much quit on the spot (after 20 years with the company). This left the company in a really bad state as basically he was the cog which kept the wheels turning.\n\nTo replace him, the boss decided to take advantage of a new scheme run by the local authority. Instead of advertising at the local job centre, this scheme would supply a 'suitable candidate' on a 12 week free trial, i.e the local authority would pay the wages for 12 weeks so the business will take someone on. At the end of the trial period, the company can choose to employ them permanently, or let them go. **This all brings us to Kevin.**\n\n**Kevin was a pretty remarkable individual, and I can only summarise some of his odd behaviours etc below:**\n\n* On his first day, Kevin was nowhere to be found. One hour after we opened, a delivery driver told us that there was 'some weird guy' hanging around outside. It turns out Kevin had just turned up and stood outside for an hour waiting for someone to get him (our front door was physically open, all he had to do was literally walk inside!).\n* At the end of his first day, Kevin asked us how to get home. Despite living no more than 400m away from the company, he literally had no idea how to get home (I had to walk him the first time)\n* Kevin didn't know what days he was working, so would turn up on days when we were closed. We found this out as the receptionist spotted hims standing outside the business on a Sunday. It turns out he would just turn up every day for work (even his days off).\n* Kevin would go AWOL for hours on end during the day. We literally couldn't find him. He didn't see this as a problem.\n* We managed to lock Kevin in the business overnight. He just stayed in the store room when we turned the lights off, and didn't bring it to our attention that he was still onsite (his shift in theory had ended 2 hours before). We found out when we arrived in the morning and found him sleeping under the desk in reception.\n* Six weeks into his trial period, Kevin asked me where the toilets were. Right next to his desk was a door with a massive sign on it saying 'Toilet'. Stevie Wonder could've seen it.\n* Kevin had absolutely zero initiative. I had disconnected his computer by accident, so he just sat there quietly for 2 hours until one of us spotted him.\n* Kevin only had competence for the job when he knew he was being watched. When left to his own devices, he would literally stand there pretending to work. He looked like an NPC from a video game.\n* Someone (the boss) thought it would be a bright idea to leave Kevin in charge of ordering. This was until he managed to order $40000 worth of stock by accident. \n* Kevin was completely incapable of packing the orders, and sending them to the right address. He would often confuse orders, or just seemingly pack whatever we had in stock. Which meant some people who ordered masks would also receive a free stethoscope! But conversely the person who ordered the stethoscope would end up with a first aid kit.\n* My favourite moment was when we found out Kevin had been posting stock back to the suppliers as he confused the addresses on the system.\n* During one of our more enlightening conversations (trying to talk to Kevin was like trying to talk to a microwave oven), Kevin revealed that he thought American Football and soccer were the same sport.\n* Amazingly Kevin had a girlfriend, who he decided to give the guided tour of the premises, in addition to giving her 'stuff' to take home, most notably, the tax documentation from the office.\n* In the rare cases where Kevin would engage conversation, he would repeatedly ask the same 3\/4 questions (like an NPC)\n* Kevin couldn't walk and talk at the same time, it was either one or the other.\n* On more than one occasion, Kevin would just stand in the middle of the corridor looking into the distance doing absolutely nothing. \n* Kevin broke his work PC twice. The previous one had lasted over 10 years, he broke it twice in 12 weeks (we have no idea what he did). \n* In the 12 weeks he was with us, Kevin always arrived with a packed lunch, but I never once saw him eat it. He never once ate on the premises.\n* Kevin thought coffee & tea were the same thing\n* Kevin thought that I was his boss, and kept asking me if I was going to keep him full time. Despite me explaining ad nauseam that I was just his colleague.\n\n\nAfter the 12 week trial period was up, Kevin was unceremoniously dumped from the company, and was told in no uncertain terms that he would not be offered a permanent contract. Despite this, Kevin continued to turn up to work for the next few weeks until his mother came to pick him up one day (he was 32), and the receptionist informed her that he wasn't an employee anymore. I have no idea what happened to Kevin. In a way I miss him. But I can see how he ended up on this scheme, as he seems genuinely unemployable. I do not think he had any particular disability, it was more that he was stuck in neutral, and couldn't get into gear.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1648156596.0},{"title":"Kevina, Windmills, and Kangaroos","author":"Kazbob48","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/tkdkko\/kevina_windmills_and_kangaroos\/","text":"I worked in Europe for the US Government a few years back.

Our train was passing by some very large windmills, and one of my friends mentioned how it's just a matter of time until all energy will be green energy.\n\nKevina is puzzled.

Here are a few of the things he did :\n\nBefore the first year officially started, the school organized some teambuilding activities for the students to meet each other. One of those was a sort of scavenger hunt ; we'd be given a hint, that would lead to a QR code with another hint, and so on, and you were competing with other teams to finish first. Kevin was on my team. One of the hints we got clearly pointed to the roof of a bus stop. Kevin looked at the roof of the bus stop and found nothing, so we kept wandering around searching for another solution. After 30 or so minutes, I got fed up and looked myself. The hint was there, clearly visible, printed on white paper taped to the dark grey bus stop.\n\nWe started the first year by getting thrown into a week of doing a bunch of programming exercices of increasing difficulty (the school's approach to teaching was very much sink or swim). We were encouraged to work in pairs or small groups. Everyone knew Kevin by the end of that week, because he would mooch off of different people everyday, and he was so useless no one would accept him into their group two days in a row.\n\nKevin had his laptop stolen while riding the bus home one Friday. He only reported it when he showed up to school without it the next Monday.\n\nWe had exams where you'd work in randomly assigned pairs. I got assigned to Kevin once. He spent 40 minutes searching for his old desktop background since this was his replacement laptop (I let him do it because this was a good chance for me to focus without him distracting me), and 10 more explaining to me that he picked it (a picture of Connor from Assassin's Creed) because he also did archery. I did not particularly care, nor did I ask, but he told me about it in detail anyway. While I was trying to fo the exam.  \n(I should mention this was more than a week after he had received his new laptop. He had plenty of time to get a new background before, he just figured an exam was the right time to do it)\n\nToward the end of the first year, we had a special serie of exams. You'd work in pairs, be given an assignment, and three hours to work on it. After the three hours, you'd be immediately present it (basically take your program to the teacher, show it works as intended, and *answer his questions correctly*). If you had a passing grade, you were good, if not, you had to try again the next week.  \nThe assignment started **hard** (way above the level of a typical first year student) and gradually dropped down in difficulty as time went on. The general assumption was that you'd fail three or four times, and then you'd start getting stuff appropriate for your level. For this exam, Kevin was \"randomly\" paired with the best student in our class. That student somehow managed to do the assignment despite it being very hard and carrying some deadweight. When they went to be graded, the teacher asked a very simple question to Kevin. Kevin answered \"I don't know, I didn't read the assignment\". Both students had to answer all questions correctly, so this got them a failing grade. (The good student threw a massive stink after that and managed to not have to drag Kevin along for their next run, allowing them to ace it, alone)\n\nStill in the same serie of exams, Kevin failed week after week. Eventually the teachers took pity on him and decided to not LOOK for mistakes. Just test the bare minimum required by the assignement (and since, as I said, the assignements got progressively easier, by that point they were stuff we learned in the first trimester, even the first *week* by the end). Kevin still failed all of them.\n\nFor one of the last group assignment of the year, the director had to forcibly insert Kevin into one group, because nobody wanted him in their group. He then didn't show up to the final presentation and tanked the group's overall grade.\n\nAt the end of the year, Kevin was, unsurprisingly, supposed to fail the year. At which point his mom came to the school (this is college equivalent, Kevin was an adult) and talked the director's ear off until he agreed to just let Kevin pass to get her out of his office.\n\nAt the start of the second year, for the first large group assignment, the director convoked all the group leaders. He then begged for one of us to take Kevin into their group. We remembered what happened last time though, so no one budged until he promised Kevin wouldn't be required to speak, or even show up at all, when presenting the assignment for grading.\n\nFinally, about midway through the second year, Kevin dropped out. It took us more than a month to notice because we had gotten so used to ignoring and avoiding him.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1647877311.0},{"title":"This Kevin makes Lloyd Christmas look like a genius","author":"benjiblack243","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/tiu04y\/this_kevin_makes_lloyd_christmas_look_like_a\/","text":"Note: Sorry for any typos I wrote this on mobile.\n\n\nSo I\u2019ve known this guy for years, and to keep his info private I\u2019ll be calling him Kevin.\n\nHe is hands down the dumbest, most neck beard motherfucker I\u2019ve ever met. \n\nHe sits in his room all day, in government assisted housing. He refuses to get a job after being fired as a security guard. Why did he get fired you ask? He fell asleep on the clock and three women in labor were stuck outside for thirty minutes while he was in their view. Now he just sits around all day playing Xbox, eating chips and feeling sorry for himself. \n\nHe switches between the idea that all women are whores and the idea that no woman will ever want him. He\u2019s even considered going back to his ex girlfriend, who has a restraining order against him. I told him it was an awful idea but more on that later. \n\nHe does some of the stupidest shit too. \n\nThe floor in his apartment is scorched from multiple incidents with fire and it\u2019s always filthy. I don\u2019t go over to see him a lot because honestly it just kind of smells bad. He sleeps with a cum blanket next to his face and I\u2019d bet all my money he\u2019s never washed it. It\u2019s completely stained and I, stupidly picked it up once and it\u2019s stiff as a board. He claims it\u2019s drool though. \n\nHe\u2019s not independent in the slightest, and I come over to cook for him on occasion when he\u2019s too focused on a game to eat for days.

He\u2019s saving no money and anything he has goes to buying himself more weed. \n\nAnyways that\u2019s a bit of what\u2019s going on currently, but let me take you back to when I lived with him. \n\nHere\u2019s a bullet point list of all the stupid shit that he\u2019s done:\n\n-punched multiple holes in his wall because he didn\u2019t wanna clean his room.\n\n-Threw temper tantrum\u2019s constantly even though he was an adult and just destroying his own property\n\n- he was a senior in high school when I lived with him but he refused to get up for school.\n\n- as per usual, refused to get a job and refused to do chores around the house.\n\n- constantly complained about being single even when once of my friends was throwing themselves at him, but they were \u201ctoo ugly\u201d for him. (He\u2019s not exactly Prince Charming)\n\n- Swore he was going into the army but cried when asked to do dishes and was taken out for an hour, curled up in a ball crying when I halfheartedly kicked him in the leg for snapping a belt next to my ear and making me deaf in one side for a few hours. Still can\u2019t hear as well out of that ear. \n\n- Refused to feed or clean up after his dog and threw a tantrum when his stepmom came by and took the dog to her house. \n\n- Ripped open his 360 because it wasn\u2019t working and, you guessed it, threw a tantrum when it wouldn\u2019t turn back on. \n\n- a favorite pastime of his was lighting cotton swabs on fire and dropping them into a pop can filled with rubbing alcohol. Then he complained constantly that his room smelled like burned crap. If you\u2019ve ever smelled burning cotton you\u2019d understand how bad it is. Not to mention how stupid and dangerous dropping fire into a can full of alcohol is. \n\n- he didn\u2019t feed his fish, which were so hidden that I didn\u2019t even know they existed, and when they died, he just left them there to rot and stink up the entire house. \n\n- Decided to get engaged to a girl before even dating her and got mad when I talked him out of it.\n\n- Flew to LA with no money and no way back and I was unable to convince him that it probably wasn\u2019t the best idea.\n\nThose are just a few of the things off the top of my head. \n\nBut today he just did, hands down, the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard about in my life.\n\nSo this morning I was rudely awoken by a phone call. I worked late so it was about 12:30 pm: Half asleep i pick up the phone and low and behold, it\u2019s Kevin and he\u2019s been arrested. He called me from the station, as if I\u2019m gonna be able to help him. \n\nHe has this crazy bitch of an ex girlfriend. When he dumped her because she was physically abusive towards him, she lost her mind. Instead of just moving on like a normal person, she went to the police and told them that he was abusive and she got a restraining order against him and got him fired from his job. That was a little over a year ago, but the dumbass decided that he\u2019s still in love with her.\n\nHe\u2019s been telling me for months that he\u2019s depressed without her, and of course I\u2019ve been telling him that he\u2019s a moron because she was horrible.\n\nWell today the idiot decided to show up to her house and beg for her back, breaking the no contact restraining order.

Now, to set the stage I'd like to establish that this girl was a hs freshman when I was in 8th grade. She was also a hs freshman when I was a junior.\n\nSocially Kevin wasn't super well off, most people found her to be unbearably annoying and the constant lying she would do was too much for pretty much everyone. Her lies ranged from made up tinder dates to claiming she was assaulted by a friend's brother while she slept and then the following medical appointments. [Yes I am 100% certain this was a lie] So I felt a little bad for her in that she clearly wasn't okay and probably needed help she wasn't getting. However, that doesn't excuse some of the absolutely batshit things she'd say.\n\nShe once tried to convince a teacher that her name was Souvenir Blanc, which is a wine. This was also during exams and frankly just very inconvenient. \n\nShe was quite honestly obese and kept going on about how she was going to start working out. She even got a personal trainer [supposedly] and started jogging. By \"started jogging\" I mean she did it once, claimed it was impossibly hard, and gave up.\n\nAnd my personal favorite: she believed that to film a sex scene the actors had to actually have sex, and to film a death scene they had to kill the actor. This girl deadass believed that any movie or television death was an actual death and that this was just a normal thing the world accepted.\n\nAt some point in high school she moved to a neighborhood with \"plantation\" in the name and was unsure about living there because she was black and didnt want to be a slave. [This is like, maybe 2015 ish btw]\n\nThat's all I've got for now but I'm sure I'll remember more as time goes by so I'll update when that happens.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1646940268.0},{"title":"She-Kevin makes a racist comment by accident in a Korean restaurant","author":"Ottatabi","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/tbhj4n\/shekevin_makes_a_racist_comment_by_accident_in_a\/","text":"(Edit: Not exactly racist but still racially insensitive)\n\n(Edit) I know this was a one time occurrence, and because they are a younger child this doesn\u2019t fit the rules of the subreddit completely, but I hope it\u2019s close enough to be enjoyed and not taken down.

However, there is one that really sticks out to me.   \n***Kevin: Master Pizza Innovator***\n\nThis happened a few weeks after I had become a shift lead and had just started assistant manager training, when my General Manager put me in charge of training new employees. He claimed it was part of my training, but actually it turned out he was just lazy and made me do his job for him so he could goof off. But, that fiasco is a story for another subreddit. \n\nKevin had been working at the store for about two months and ideally we would have trained him on how to work the line after his second week. However, this was a Kevin so things were not ideal. I devoted a lot of time to helping coach Kevin through simple things although he seemed to understand in the moment I would regularly have to re-teach him after a few shifts. Honestly, I didn't mind too much because at the time our store was extremely understaffed due to the GM just not hiring anyone and I was just happy to have a body to fill a position on the busy days. He would tag things on the wrong boxes despite there being a clear guide with pictures right next to the tagging area. He would forget to take card information. I even caught him sleeping multiple times during day shift in the view of the carryout. However, no customers ever saw and I really needed the help so I never said anything.\n\nThe trouble with Kevin came when I was asked to train him on the makeline after one of our insiders turned in their two weeks notice and we would need more help on the makeline.  I was especially hands on with his training on the makeline because I needed him to be at least somewhat competent. Unfortunately, he was called to action far before he was ready when the quitting insider stopped showing up a week before his two weeks was up. When dinner rush hit the only people there were Me, Kevin, and my GM. Our store had a conveyor belt oven and typically during a dinner rush on a day with  that volume of sale we would have needed two people on ovens, one person stretching dough, and three people on make line with a fourth working on sides. My GM decided that he would catch ovens and left me and Kevin to work the makeline.\n\nI had managed to prepare a good amount before the dinner rush had started and we started off strong. However, once my prep was exhausted we began falling behind despite my best attempts to shift into maximum overdrive. I simply could not make up for the lack of people. There was one bright side, while he was much slower that I needed him to be Kevin was doing better than I had hoped. He did not mess up a pizza until about thirty to forty-five minutes into rush when I catch a glimpse of the oddest thing.  It took a few moments and three hastily made (and beautiful) pizzas before I realized what I saw. Kevin had taken a pizza and folded it in half. I looked back over and Kevin was turned to face me an uncooked pizza folded into a burrito looking shape held out stretched to me. Then I hear the words that I can still clearly hear in my mind to this day. \n\n\"It's a pizza roll\" \n\nI just picked up the pizza I had just finished and took it to the oven. Then I continued working I had neither the time or patience to deal with that at that moment. He tossed the pizza roll away and began working on his next pie. After the rush was over I pulled Kevin aside asked why he would make a pizza roll during dinner rush.\n\n\"I slobbered on it\"\n\nI was probably more caught off guard that I should have been hearing a grown man tell me he \"slobbered\" on a pizza, but whatever. However, to this day I have no idea how he \"slobbered\" on the pizza because we weren't talking, he made no noise, he wasn't even doing his normal obnoxiously loud sing-a-longs that he did when he was cleaning. I am likely reading too much into it though. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR, Kevin slobbered on a pizza and made a pizza roll.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1646890866.0},{"title":"Kevina crushes new years eve party","author":"ZerosWolf","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/ta5z3m\/kevina_crushes_new_years_eve_party\/","text":"Some years ago, I had a run in with a Kevina.

I was paired with this shizz stain of a human, and found out quickly that this guy was a TOTAL Kevin. He outweighed me by about 130 pounds( that will become relevant in the story), and considered himself one of \u201cGod\u2019s Gift To Women\u201d and a country boy at that. Upon entering the truck together, I realized that this guy is gonna be difficult to work with, to say the least. \n\nWell, we run our first few loads together, mostly myself running nights, he running days. This Craptastic guy kept complaining about the weight of the loads, that he had to scale out practically everything, and that he wasn\u2019t able to get any driving done because of all the traffic. I offered to switch, but he said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t see at night\u201d. (How do you have a CDL if you are night blind?! Oh well.) \n\nOne day, this human stain goes to plop down in the driver\u2019s chair(as is custom, he never actually Sat down in it, but rather plopped down), when I hear a pop from under the chair, followed by hissing air as he sank practically to the floor. \u201cUm, OP, I think the airbag under the chair is busted.\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what happens when you jump in the chair like that. You get us going, I\u2019ll set up for a maintenance request.\u201d I replied, rolling my eyes. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t drive like this, you\u2019re going to have to do it.\u201d He replied casually. \n\n\u201cI just got off shift, I have no hours left to drive. You\u2019re gonna have to do it.\u201d I said, as I grabbed the Qualcomm and set us up with maintenance. That was strike 1, and the beginning of the end for our team. \n\nStrike 2 was when we were late for a delivery, because he decided he wanted to spend 14 1\/2 hours, trying to get a girl to come back to the truck with him to do lord knows what. I told him I wasn\u2019t cool with it, and he about lost his mind. \u201cIs it because you\u2019re gay, and the thought of a female body makes you gag?\u201d \n\n\u201cMy sexual orientation has nothing to do with this. I just don\u2019t want to be in the truck with you and whoever while you are getting it on. That\u2019s disrespectful on my part for one. Also, the fact that you didn\u2019t even mention you had a co driver is disrespectful on your part. So quit the bullshit, and let\u2019s go! We\u2019re already late.\u201d \n\nStrike 3 came when, instead of being routed close to both of our homes for hometime, he asked to be routed to Texas, to spend some time with his brother. I was ok with that. I was even ok with him first telling me that I could sleep at his brother\u2019s place, then told me, closer to the hometime, that his brother wasn\u2019t really comfortable with that, and it would be better if I stayed with the truck anyway. What I wasn\u2019t ok with, was the nuclear fallout that was about to unfold that weekend. \n\nWe had made it to Texas on a Wednesday, and were scheduled to roll back out the following Tuesday morning, as this was our first hometime in almost 4 months. Friday afternoon, I get a call from dispatch, asking me about the whereabouts of my co driver. \n\n\u201cUm, he\u2019s not here. He is spending time with his brother.\u201d \n\n\u201cOk. It\u2019s cool. I\u2019ll talk to you guys Monday, to see if you\u2019re available for a run.\u201d Fast forward to Sunday afternoon, and my dispatcher, who is not in on weekends, calls me in a panic. \u201cHey, is your co driver back to the truck yet?\u201d \n\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s spending the weekend with his brother. I\u2019m guarding the truck.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need to speak with him, it\u2019s urgent.\u201d She insisted. About that time, he and his brother roll up to the truck, and he gets out, and proceeds to pack up all his stuff from the truck, telling me that he needed to take care of a family emergency and would be back on the road soon.\n\n\u201cWell, Dispatcher needs to talk to you.\u201d I said, with dispatcher in my ear, \u201cHe\u2019s there?! Ok, hang up with me, I\u2019ll call him.\u201d I noted the urgency in her voice, and was thinking, \u201cWhat the Hell did he do?\u201d I was about to find out. \n\nHe and his brother got back in their pickup, and took off. No sooner that they had cleared the parking lot, my Qualcomm had lit up, flashing a bright red triangle, which meant one thing: a VERY urgent message had came through. I was like, \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d As I opened it, to see my name in ALL caps as the subject line. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about Pre tripping the truck, if you have stuff going on in the truck stop, pull it, and get out of there! Don\u2019t tell your co driver either. As of today he is no longer employed with us. Get about 200 miles away, and call me!\u201d \n\nI called dispatcher immediately. \u201cDispatcher, what the hell is that about?!\u201d \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say right now. You have your orders, do it!\u201d *click* \n\nOk\u2026 proceeding to panic. I took off, headed West. I ended up at a Hole In The Wall Truck Stop(anything that is not part of the major 5 companies; TA\/Petro, Pilot\/Flying J, and Loves). I call her back. \u201cWhat the Fuck happened? I need answers!\u201d \n\n\u201cYour co driver threatened to murder you in your sleep tonight.\u201d My dispatcher said. \n\n\u201cSay what?!\u201d \n\n\u201cYeah, he said that you were trying to get down his pants, and threatened to make him your bitch at night, so he said that since he was scared of that happening, he was gonna shoot you.\u201d \n\n\u201c(Dispatcher Name), I never said that. Yes, I may be gay. But I have standards, and with him being about 120 pounds over my weight, that\u2019s definitely not my type! Besides, the guy was a slob, and was an arrogant prick, and wasn\u2019t that smart.\u201d I added. \n\nShe chuckled. \u201cWell, be that as it may, I made the call to fire him. Which brings me to the next topic; who broke the seat in the truck?\u201d \n\n\u201cHe did. He had a habit of jumping into the seat, and he did it one too many times, and the airbag busted.\u201d \n\n\u201cI figured. I\u2019ll be sure to bill him for that as well. Since we put you in a toxic work environment unknowingly, your contract with us is Null.\u201d \n\nWait, what? Back the hell up! \n\n\u201cThere is an embedded clause in the contract that states that if, for any reason, a contractee is endangered, the contract is terminated upon discovery of danger.\u201d I had pulled the signed copy I had and started looking at this point. \n\n\u201cOk, I see that now. What does that mean? I don\u2019t have to work with you guys anymore?\u201d \n\n\u201cWell yes. That also means, that should you leave this company tomorrow, you wouldn\u2019t owe the schooling fees.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d \n\nI got another driver 2 weeks later, and he became one of my best friends, that we still talk to this day, 6 years later.

Like, bent in half broken. He said he got hit by a car but had no bruising and it was just the phone that was damaged. Most were broken when he worked on a phone stall in an indoor market.\n\n- Lost his house keys. Turned out, he'd been dared by a friend to stick them where the sun doesn't shine, he did and ended up in hospital. He then dared his friend to do the same but the friend asked him to do it first so he did and ended up in hospital a second time. His parents refused to let him have any keys after that. My mum handed him a spare key to our house because she didn't believe what had happened until his dad showed her a video he was sent of him doing it \n\n- He tried buying lottery tickets at 15 (legal age was 16 at the time). The first time he provided ID and was refused, the second time he just showed a selfie that he'd written \"I'm old enough to buy lottery tickets\"\n\n- He tried the same with alcohol several times. \n\n- He tried stealing bottles of alcohol but got caught every single time. On at least three occasions, he tried saying he bought it from a certain till. The first time all tills near where he said were closed. The second time he chose someone who was on but said he hadn't been through with anything. The third time, security had watched him walk in, grab a bottle and go to walk out with it and before security got to him, his mother just so happened to be walking in. She made a scene and then tried buying it for but was refused. She ended up getting banned from there along with her son and his friends. \n\n- He asked if he could borrow a ladder to get on our roof. He said that this time was to prove a point (after the phone on the roof incident). The point was that an umbrella could be used as a more effective parachute. He plays (or at least played) a lot of Fortnite. He was never any good at it but that's where he got the idea. \n\n- He called his stepmother a \"butch bitch.\" Neither she nor his dad liked that and he was banned from going there until she received an apology. His apology? \"Sorry you married a man in drag, dad.\" Edit to clarify: the apology was said to his stepmother, not his dad. I found it funny enough until he mentioned this part.\n\n- Talked his friend into doing the ice bucket challenge 4 years after the popularity died down. When the friend sat on the ground, he teabagged the friend. The same friend managed to trick him into letting him do it back to him the same day and recorded it. This was the same friend who dared him to shove the key up his bum \n\n- Supposedly forgot where we lived and walked into the house opposite. There was a single woman with a young child opposite. Rumours of break ins and thefts were on the rise in the area so they were terrified when he barged in.\n\n- The next day, he walked straight into another neighbour's house where he got pinned down and he started crying. This was about a month before they broke up for good.\n\n- Came over crying and saying his girlfriend broke up with him and won't leave until she takes him back. My sister was his girlfriend and hadn't broken up. He managed to convince her and my parents it was a dream. \n\n- Accused my sister of cheating the next day. When my sister mentioned this is suspicious, he let her look through his phone. He had at least three numbers saved as mum and four as dad. His step mum was saved as dad and my sister was saved as mum. He was chatting the other five up. His parents were saved under their first names. There was also someone with the same first name as his step mum he'd also been massaging as well but most of them seemed out of context, it was almost too obvious he'd been deleting messages. (My guess was one of them were the girl who'd broken up with him the day before)\n\n- He got banned from the petrol station down the road after he managed to get a shopping trolley and not only tried to go through the car wash, he tried filling it up with fuel. The nearest place he could've got this trolley is 4 miles away from us in the opposite direction to him.\n\n- He was fired and banned from the local indoor market because he kept loudly daring people to take a shit in the clothes stall opposite. He was fired and went over to piss on the clothes. He was banned until he can pay for the damages, which he refused to do. \n\n- Came over to talk to my sister at 3 in the morning because he thought AM was the afternoon. His logic was AM and afternoon both start with A and people start the morning with a pee, which is apparently just one letter. He also added he goes for a poo in the morning which starts with P, just like PM. The fact that it was dark outside meant absolutely nothing to him.\n\n-  Gave my sister a ring and a necklace for her birthday. Sounds great but his dad phoned and asked if we'd seen him with any jewellery recently. He described the ring and necklace perfectly. Turned out, his dad gave them to his wife for their 10 year anniversary a month prior. They were returned and a few days later, he brought over another ring and necklace and 2 pairs of earrings that he swore he bought. His mother came over the next day and had a very similar conversation as we'd had with his dad only days prior, only these had been given to her by her deceased grandparents\n\n- I wanted to add that his dad took him camping for a little over a week (left Friday, returned a week on Monday and saw my sister the Thursday morning before leaving and Tuesday evening after returning). His dad told his mum not to worry as he had everything packed. Turns out he just meant for himself and the kids had to sleep in the mud and go clothes shopping the next day covered in mud. \n\n- When he returned said he hadn't seen my sister in 4 days. His reasoning? The first day he didn't see my sister was a Friday, the last was a Monday, the week between didn't count\n\nI thank the people for the silvers","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1646140702.0},{"title":"Continued: My girlfriends sister is a female Kevin","author":"desk2118","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/t3qq2i\/continued_my_girlfriends_sister_is_a_female_kevin\/","text":"I recently posted about my (18m) girlfriends (18f) younger sister (14f), as I said, those events weren't all of it, and people really seemed to enjoy it, and asked for more, also asking for updates, which I will post every once in a while in the future if more stuff happens. This will be a continuation of my post from yesterday, I kept it to 30 for brevity. I was talking about her to my girlfriend and she mentioned some stories about her I didn't even know. Some other events that have occured:\n\nOriginal post \nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/t3as11\/my_girlfriends_younger_sister_is_a_female_kevin\/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\n31. About a year ago, she tried to purchase alcohol from a gas station, she misspell \"license\" on her fake ID\n\n32. She has lost 6 pairs of airpods at school this year. I honestly don't know why her parents keep buying replacements\n\n33. For a while she \"didn't believe in pronouns\", and had to have her boyfriend explain them to her\n\n34. She likes smoothies, she makes them frequently, on 3 or 4 occasions she's forgotten to put the lid on the blender, at least it's been a while since that last happened \n\n35. My girlfriend told me when she was in 3rd grade she pulled the fire alarm after a boy dared her to\n\n36. She has broken 3 chromebooks this year, dropped one down the stairs, split coffee on another and we do not know how the third one broke, but it no longer works\n\n37. She once asked if she was going to catch autism from a classmate (hes a very smart kid, in general ed but has an IEP)\n\n38. She has left the window open in her parents car on a night it snowed. Twice.\n\n39. I know this is fairly common, but when she was 7 she ate a bunch of vitamins thinking they were fruit gummies and got sick\n\n40. When baking, she confuses sugar and salt often \n\n41. She did one of those tiktoks where you call teachers by their first name, got a detention and then continued to do it \n\n42. She has gotten her backpack stuck to her jacket a few times\n\n43. Her and her boyfriend were reviewing the Boston Tea Party for school, she was shocked to learn it was not an actual tea party\n\n44. She has eaten raw egg before after a dare by a boy in her class \n\n45. She once had to go to a doctor after kicking a vending machine to get a snack out\n\n46. She is the type of student who always forgets to charge her chromebook (and she's on her 4th one)\n\n47. When she was a toddler, she always tried to open up the cabinet with chemicals, throwing toys at it to try to get it to open, her parents always had to get her away from the area \n\n48. In 7th grade, she was misgendering a trans student, this girl was friends with a bunch of boys on the basketball team, she challenged one to a fight after school, needless to say after that fight, she hasn't bullied a kid for being trans since \n\n49. Gf told me when she was in 1st grade she ate a penny the teacher had dropped on the floor, they had to take her to the doctor where he assured them she'd poop it out\n\n50. She has tried to put all kinds of items from batteries to food packaging to a metal pencil sharpener in the recycling bin when it didn't belong there \n\n51. When she was 8, she accidentally sat on a pencil, luckily after looking it up online, her parents realized the graphite wouldn't hurt her\n\n52. Her boyfriend watches Jeopardy sometimes, she hates it and considers it a \"nerd show\"\n\n53. She once tried raw chicken because she saw a YouTube video of a family doing it on the show Wife Swap\n\n54. When she was in 4th grade, she broke her teachers pencil sharpener since she tried sharpening a pen \n\n55. My girlfriend once said she vaguely remembers her sister mentioning a video she watched claiming LBJ killed JFK\n\n56. You remember the stories teachers told of students who cracked their head after tipping their chairs back? While she never cracked her head, she did fall back multiple times in elementary after tipping the chair, luckily she was never hurt bad\n\n57. Gf said once in 2nd grade she tried using the dog ate my homework excuse, she didn't have a dog at the time\n\n58. She once took her boyfriend out for dinner and said she'd pay, she searched her purse for 15 minutes looking for the money before she realized she put it in the coat of her jacket (he had the money and offered to pay, but she insisted she had the money)\n\n59. She once decided to skip school by going to the mall, she bought clothes there, then when she got home placed them on the kitchen counter and went in her room after making food, when her father asked why their were clothes on the counter she said her brother had bought them, her brother was picked up from a club that day by her father \n\n60. She will not be careful when its icy out and walk normally, this has led her to fall a few times\n\n61. She once hit herself in the face because she was playing with a tape measure\n\n62. She thought the electoral college was an actual college at one point\n\n63. She thought the US Senate was \"gerrymandered\" (that only happens at the House level)\n\n64.  She tried managing her boyfriends campaign for student council (which he won), he denied her request after he noticed numerous spelling errors in the transcript of an announcement speech she asked him to transcribe, he had many press releases and did not want the risk of her misspelling shit\n\n65. She doesn't understand why she should monitor her sugar consumption because \"sugar is natural, so it's good for you\"\n\n66. Once when she was younger she didn't want to eat her vegetables, so instead of hiding them under the plate like a normal kid, she tried hiding them under her shirt, and they fell out when she got up\n\n67. She actually believed the Kayne-Jeffery Star relationship hoax from TikTok for several months\n\nThat is all me and my girlfriend could think of for now, we will definitely update in a few months if we can with any actions we remember or anything new that comes up. She has done so many stupid things its impossible to keep track.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1646084424.0},{"title":"SIGH\u2026Uncle Kev STRIKES AGAIN!","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/t3vr1o\/sighuncle_kev_strikes_again\/","text":"I feel like it would have been longer before I updated y\u2019all on the Family Tumor: Uncle Kevin. While I don\u2019t have a new list today, there has been a couple INCIDENTS since I\u2019ve last talked to you guys. \n\nLike always, fuckle your seatbelts.\n\nSo, Kevin finally agreed to be screened and guess what? Nothing\u2019s wrong with him! He\u2019s mildly anxious but that\u2019s it. He\u2019s just\u2026THAT stupid. \n\nMoving on-\n\nBecause Uncle Kevin is now currently living in a crummy hotel in a new state, and needed to find a job ASAP, he had to open a bank account where we live. So, my mom makes an appointment with our bank and decides to drive Kevin there to sort things out. Simple, right?\n\nWelp, because he is incapable of getting ready and out the door without you circling him like a shark, he sat in the hotel doing nothing until my mom showed up. She told him beforehand when he had to get up, and because of the area we live in, to look AT LEAST presentable.\n\nUncle Kevin not only skipped the shower all together, but he didn\u2019t brush his teeth (you could smell his breath through the mask) nor even wipe the very noticeable gunk from his eyes. He wore obviously worn out clothes and a Bronco\u2019s baseball cap. \n\nBecause they were already late and getting him to do this much already drove my mom crazy, they went to the bank. When they arrived, Kevin treated the bank staff like doctors and his sister like his mom. \n\nYou remember how when you were a kid and your mom took you to the doctor, you\u2019d kinda stare at the floor while they talked? And when you were asked a question, you\u2019d look at your mom for her to answer? Yeah, that\u2019s what he did. \n\nWith the way he looked, smelled, and acted\u2026do you know what the bank people thought?\n\nThey thought he was special needs. \n\nSO, they treated him as such. When they talked to him like \u201chey, buddy! Nice hat! Gotta love those Broncos!\u201d, KEVIN WAS NOT HAVIN IT. He was PISSED, especially when the bank staff just overlooked him to speak directly to my mother. \n\nBut what set him off was when they asked my mom, \u201cSo, is he living with you or is it a facility situation?\u201d \n\nHe finally spoke up and said he wasn\u2019t special needs with an attitude, and that he didn\u2019t appreciate not being asked questions. Cue shock horror. \n\nIn other news, he accidentally got mail that belonged to us and couldn\u2019t figure out how to mail it or even how to buy a stamp. So, my mother told him to just scratch out the name with pen and write one of our names below it. He decided not to do that and was shocked that the hotel front desk clerk didn\u2019t hand the letter to my father when he picked it up.\n\nThat\u2019s all I have today! At times I wonder how he\u2019s still alive\u2026","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1646098364.0},{"title":"My girlfriend\u2019s younger sister is a female Kevin","author":"desk2118","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/t3as11\/my_girlfriends_younger_sister_is_a_female_kevin\/","text":"My (18m) girlfriend\u2019s (18f) sister (14f) is a female Kevin. Me and my girlfriend have been dating since 7th grade, we are currently in college together a few hundred miles few away from where we are from. Because we have been together so long, we are very close to each other\u2019s families. I have 3 siblings (21m, 20f, 16m), she has 5 siblings (20m, 16f, 14f, 13m and 12m). We are from very affluent families in a very affluent suburb in the US, the schools in our area are amazing and we all had private tutoring and many other opportunities available to us as kids. My girlfriend\u2019s 14 y\/o sister is a stereotype of a privileged blonde white girl, but way stupider. Here are some things about her:\n\n  \nedit: continued post here: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/t3qq2i\/continued\\_my\\_girlfriends\\_sister\\_is\\_a\\_female\\_kevin\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/t3qq2i\/continued_my_girlfriends_sister_is_a_female_kevin\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. A bit more then a month ago, when me and my girlfriend were over for winter break, her brother (13) came out of his room balling, his sister had accidentally texted him saying \u201cthat little \\[f slur\\] needs to shut the fuck up\u201d, she meant to text it to a group chat of her friends, the text was about a classmate she found annoying (and we later found out, she was teasing), the 13 y\/o brother is openly gay. Their parents had a LONG talk with her and took her phone away to see what she was texting, and found offensive messages on there, they have made her write an apology to the boy, her brother, and have made her learn about LGBT history. Obviously what she did was horrible, but out of all people to accidentally text, she texted her openly gay brother.\n2. A few months ago, her boyfriend asked her if she wanted to go to Paris with them (in front of my gf\u2019s parents), she asked him what state that was in. He told her it was in France, not the US. She then asked how long the drive was. He had to explain to her that they were flying, because there was an ocean between the US and France.\n3. When they got to France, a few hours later, she had Facetimed my girlfriend, she asked why certain places had \u201cweird words\u201d on their signs, my girlfriend was confused and asked her to show what she meant, the \u201dweird words\u201d were French. My girlfriend explained that to her but then she asked \u201cbut people speak English here\u201d, she had an incredibly tough time understanding the concept of bilingualism.\n4. Her boyfriend is much smarter then her, he is currently taking French, he is also very into politics, he is actually very left wing (and was upset to hear about his gf\u2019s bigotry), he had bought some Maoist pamphlets in France (which his parents were not thrilled about) and on another Facetime call she said, \u201cCayden got books with a weird symbol on it\u201d, we asked her to show the book to me and I explained to her it was a hammer and sickle, symbol of communism and socialist countries, she then asked \u201clike Japan?\u201d\n5. In 7th grade, she had her phone taken away after getting in trouble for bullying a boy in her class, she had also had her allowance taken away for a month, she decided to steal her parents checkbook and try to buy something at the mall for $200, she used the wrong spelling of two and wrote \u201ctoo hundred dollars\u201d. When an employee told her to leave, she tried convincing her she was an adult who \u201chad height problems\u201d. Security had to get her to leave, and her parents picked her up extremely upset.\n6. About a year ago when I was over at their house, the parents found a vape, they gathered all the kids together in their library and asked whose it was, she said it was her 12 y\/o brothers, he vehemently denied it. They have security cameras in every room of their house with the exception of the kids bedrooms, all of the kids know this, the camera showed her with the vape going into their library, she later defended it being a good hiding spot because \u201cno one would expect it\u2019s me\u201d because she doesn\u2019t like to read.\n7. She decided to put a spoon and fork in the microwave to see what would happen, luckily her younger brother was there to see her and stopped her, this was two months ago, she\u2019s a freshman in high school\n8. Speaking of school, since middle school she has failed multiple classes a year, including core classes like math and science. She says school isn\u2019t important because \u201cI can just start a business\u201d.\n9. I was on vacation with them to the UK right before the pandemic hit, the night after we got there we were in the hotel and she asked \u201cwhy do all of the people here speak weird\u201d, we had to spend multiple hours explaining the concept of accents to her.\n10. Remember the tide pod challenge? Well back in 2018 (so she was 10 at the time), she decided to participate in it and post it on Instagram.\n11. She also decided to participate in the \u201cdevious licks\u201d trend last year, she stole a hand sanitizer dispenser and when it fell out of her backpacks in one of her classes, she tried to blame it on a boy in her class, despite the teacher seeing it fall out of her bag, she claimed he planted it in there, he\u2019s a good boy so the teacher said she would check the cameras to see who stole it, she told her teacher \u201cgo ahead\u201d, and of course, the footage showed her taking the dispenser, she then said the video was deepfaked.\n12. I was once talking to her about Elon Musk\u2019s space travel, talking about how humans want to reach Mars eventually, she then asked \u201cwhat about the sun\u201d, I was confused and tried explaining to her that the sun would literally melt them if they got remotely close to it, she said \u201cbut the sun is only 90 degrees today\u201d, she thought the temperature of the sun = the temperature of the Earth.\n13. She doesn\u2019t believe in sunscreen or sunglasses and refuses to wear them, despite getting sunburn frequently in the summer.\n14. I was watching a Jimmy Kimmel skit where he asked Americans if they could identify an outline of the US as the US when flipped upside down, I printed out a picture of the us, flipped it upside down and asked her what country it was, she guessed Rome. I told her to try again, she guessed California. When I told her it was upside down, she turned it to it\u2019s right side up and then guessed Canada. I was speechless. I told her it was the US and she looked genuinely surprised.\n15. She is an anti-masker and has refused to wear a mask throughout the pandemic saying \u201cit makes you breath toxic chemicals from your body\u201d, she also refuses to get vaccinated like the rest of her family is.\n16. She has forgotten her birthday on multiple years, acting surprised when people wished her a happy birthday and asking \u201cit\u2019s my birthday?\u201d\n17. She, up until a few months ago, believed that everything in the 50s and before were black and white because TV shows, movies, and photographs from that era were black and white.\n18. She doesn\u2019t believe Hellen Keller existed\n19. A few years ago, one day she thought it would be a good idea to do a backflip on the top of the stairs, she fell down and broke her leg.\n20. When she got her first detention (when she was in 6th grade, for cursing out another student), she thought it would be a good idea to eat the detention slip so she wouldn\u2019t have to go. When she didn\u2019t show up, the next day, she told the teacher she never got detention, the only reason we found out was one of her friends admitted she did it because he couldn\u2019t stop laughing at what she did, she then got a day of OSS, and her parents had to pick her up from the school.\n21. She burns herself when cooking constantly, never wears oven mitts when cooking. She\u2019s only allowed to cook when a parent is home because she almost started a fire by leaving a plastic tray on a hot stove.\n22. She once tried killing a spider by hitting it with a glass cup and the glass shattered.\n23. In 7th grade, she tried cheating on a test by writing the answers on her arm, she was wearing a t-shirt (so her arms were showing) that day, the answers were wrong anyways, she asked a boy who she had called gay for telling his best friend he loved him (in a platonic way) for answers, he gave her answers that were very incorrect to anyone with common sense, her teacher noticed the writing right away and gave her a 0, she said she trusted the boy since she knew him from detention (good kid who\u2019s just a bit of a troublemaker, and he is really intelligent), but he was known to pull pranks and jokes all the time.\n24. She tried auditioning for her schools play, she was allowed to have her sheet music, but messed up because she couldn\u2019t pronounce the words of the song, she thought it was a good idea to only play with the karaoke, she had been mispronouncing the words the whole time.\n25. She was talking to one of her boyfriend\u2018s lacrosse teammates, he was drinking water and she asked him if he knew who invented water, he was confuse, trying to explain to her about H20 and the big bang, she was not getting it and asked \u201cwho put the hydrogen and oxygen together?\u201d.\n26. She, on more then one occasion, has confused Barack Obama with Osama Bin Laden\n27. When she was in 8th, she tried forging her mom\u2019s signature for a field trip, she misspelt her mom\u2019s name, the parents were not opposed to her going, she just forgot to ask her parents to sign the form\n28. When she was 11, she thought it would be a good idea to throw a rock at a bee\u2019s nest, me and my gf were with her, it\u2019s a miracle none of us got stung but we had to run away fast\n29. They went on vacation to Vermont in December of 2021, she only packed t-shirts and shorts and when they got to Vermont, they needed to buy pants and long sleeve shirts because \u201cshe didn\u2019t know it\u2019d be so cold\u201c\n30. When she was in theatre in middle school, she was messing around and fell off the stage a few times, once she did it twice in the same day\n\nThat\u2019s not even all of it, I just wanted to post some of the highlights. I don\u2019t know how she\u2019s made it this long or how she will function as an adult, she has been tested for disabilities by numerous psychologists, yet she never meets the criteria for any diagnosis. She is just plain stupid. I hope the business idea works out and that she finds someone to manage her finances, because I doubt she has the math skills to run a buisness.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1646036518.0},{"title":"Kevin is a free thinker who reads one website","author":"thabeef","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/t27mts\/kevin_is_a_free_thinker_who_reads_one_website\/","text":"I posted about Kevin [last month](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/s8zav1\/kevins_too_smart_to_be_understood_by_women\/). Here are a few more nuggets from the time I wasted with him.\n\n* Kevin thinks people who live in the hood like it there, so that\u2019s why they don\u2019t move.\n* Kevin always needs a far right hero to worship. When he got into Jordan Peterson, everything he didn\u2019t like was suddenly \u201cpost-modernist\u201d or \u201cMarxist\u201d. When I unwisely asked him if he believed in QAnon, he said he didn\u2019t know anything about it. A few days later, he started talking about globalists in every communication.\n* Kevin claims that pasteurization is fake and was just Louis Pasteur seeking glory and prestige.\n* Kevin wanted to go to a coding bootcamp. He asked me if he would be guaranteed to get a job that paid over $100,000 within 7 days of graduating. When I said no, he said he knew it sounded like a scam.\n* Kevin asked me if there were any openings at the firm I worked at at the time. He said he was looking for a job where he could get his own clients and keep 100% of the money, but also needed to be paid a base salary in case he wasn\u2019t able to get the level of clientele he needed to maintain his desired lifestyle.\n* Kevin said that he was going to buy a rental property in the college town where his oldest goes to school. Kevin and his wife\u2019s shopping addiction take up all his money, so I had no idea how he could afford a down payment on a rental property. Kevin said he was going to get a loan with no down payment. When I asked how he was going to pay to fix things when they broke or get the property ready for rental, he said that his daughter and his friends could live there and fix it up for him for free.\n* Kevin claims to be a free thinker who \u201creads all sources\u201d. I found the site where he gets all his news and was able to anticipate what topics he would try to use to stir the pot in the group chat. He said he \u201clooks at that site from time to time\u201d, while he talked about everything on their front page in great detail every day. One day, when he decided to start trying to talk in the group chat, I figured out that he was just going down the list of links on the front page. I began calling out the next topic he was going to bring up. He said I was pissing him off.\n* Kevin likes to jump from topic to topic rapidly when talking to people so it\u2019s hard to keep up with which conspiracy theory he\u2019s talking about.

I\u2019m talking 3+ jumbo cups of tiger milk tea ( a mix of black and Thai tea) a day. Now, I like boba, but I really like tea. So, I invited Kevin and a few of my other friends over for tea and dessert. So, Kevin carpooled with another friend (D), and they were the first to arrive. I had the water boiling, so I ask what kind of tea they want. Kevin and D both want chai (super caffeinated black tea, this will come into play later). So, we talk a bit more and then the tea is done brewing. And I ask if they want milk and sugar. Kevin proceeds to ask me what kind of person puts milk in tea. I tell him that milk and sugar in tea was popularized by the British. He says that, \u201cit\u2019s gross and he\u2019d never heard of anyone doing that before\u201d. I ask him what he thinks is in his BOBA MILK TEA. He acts super surprised. D and I laugh it off, as other people arrive.\n\nFast forward a month or so later, I go out with Kevin to a boba shop and we hang out. We get boba as soon as we get there and then spent about 2 hours walking around. As we\u2019re leaving he wants to get another cup. So we do and I tell him he\u2019s never going to get to sleep tonight, as it was around 8 PM. Keep in mind this was his third cup that day. He ask why. I tell him that it has a lot of caffeine. He is confused and argues that he hasn\u2019t drank any caffeine. I explain that both black, Thai, and chai have lots of caffeine. And he asks why I\u2019m bringing that up, and I quote,\u201d why are we talking about tea? All I had was boba?\u201d. I had to explain to him that there was TEA in his milk TEA. It took a lot of googling to convince him.\n\nDefinitely not as bad as some of the posts here, but he still got into arguments because he didn\u2019t think. at all. \n\nWhat did this man think he was drinking three times a day?

I would email my timesheet to one of the agents (The Kevin), who then sent the total amount to a payroll company to handle taxes and cutting the check.\n\nOne day, about 2.5 years into working there I happened to look a little more closely at the hours listed on my paystub. It said 70.3 hours. The \".3\" caught my attention cause Kevin had mentioned when I first started working there to just round the total for the pay period to the nearest 15 mins (and I of course made sure to actually work for the time I was listing). So reporting 70 hours and 18 mins would have been very strange for me.\n\nI looked back at my timesheet for that pay period, and it was 70 hours and 30 mins. I always formatted my hours with a colon (70:30), so wanting to believe the very best I thought maybe Kevin just hadn't looked closely and read the colon as a period, thus submitting \"70.3\" to the payroll company. Somehow. But in going through previous paystubs I figured out she'd been making this same mistake the last two years. It was only applicable once every couple of months, though, so were were talking about a difference of less than 20 bucks in total. And frankly I was counting down till I could quit anyways for other reasons, so I didn't want to go through the hassle of getting them all corrected. Instead, I just started sending my hours in as decimals so it wouldn't be an issue.\n\nBoy was I wrong.\n\nA month or so later I had a pay period with an even 72 hours. Paystub came, and I was surprised to see 72.4. I look at my timesheet to figure out where in the hell that .4 came from, and it took me a while to work it out. Then it clicks. On my timesheet, most of my days were an even 8 hours, except for one day where I worked 7.5 hours, and then worked 8.5 hours the next day.\n\nTurns out, despite the fact that I totaled everything for her as 72 hours, she was \"correcting\" my math after the fact. Specifically, she was reading \"7.5\" and \"8.5\" to mean \"7 hours and 50 minutes\" plus \"8 hours and 50 minutes, which equals 16 hours and 40 minutes, which then gets written down and sent to the payroll company as \"16.4\". **\\*brain implodes\\***\n\nAgain, I wasn't far from leaving this place, so I waited until the next time it came up and gave it one last shot to passively nudge her in the right direction (she was also notoriously bad at taking any criticism). So I sent my timesheet as usual, but included a note in the body of the email saying \"57 and 1\/2 hours (57.5)\".\n\nA few minutes later I have this conversation across cubicles:\n\nKevin: \"Sooo... when you put '57.5' you mean...?\"\n\nMe: \"57 and 1 half hour.\"\n\nK: \"Okay, so it'll be 57.3 for 30 minutes, gotcha.\"\n\nM: \"Um, it comes on my paystub as a decimal number like what I sent you, so it shouldn't need to be converted.\"\n\nK: \"Well except last paycheck she put .15 on the end, and that's 15 minutes, right?\"\n\nM: \"I did have 15 minutes, yeah, but it should be .25 for a quarter of an hour, not .15.\"\n\nK: \"Well I don't know how she calculates it on her end.\"\n\nIn my head: *PRETTY SURE SHE CALCULATES DECIMALS THE SAME WAY THE REST OF THE F\\*CKING WORLD DOES, KEVIN.*\n\nOut loud: \"...k.\"\n\nBest part, next day:\n\nKevin: \"Oh okay, so she does the decimals in hundreds, the same way you do.

I genuinely would not believe a human could be so devoid of intelligence and common sense if not for them. Like, I love them, but I honestly have no idea how they\u2019ve even survived up to this point. Here\u2019s why I say all that;\n\nI showed Jay this mermaid mockumentary, *Mermaids: The Body Found*, as a joke, and they actually believed that the \u201cfootage\u201d was real and that we have proof of mermaids.\n\nJay\u2019s family moved into a new house, which has a flat electric stove. Jay tried to see if the stove was hot by pressing their entire ass hand onto the stove. Jay got a first-degree burn and spent twenty straight minutes bawling while their mom had Jay run their hand under cold water.\n\nFor my 14th birthday, we had a big barbeque and my dad brought out the firepit so we could make s\u2019mores. Jay saw a video of someone\u2019s fart catching fire, so they decided to try it for themself. In front of all my friends, Jay pulled down their pants and their shorts caught fire. Luckily, Jay knew to roll on the ground and didn\u2019t get any serious burns.\n\nOur family hung out at Jay's house one day and I brought my switch over so we could hook it up to Jay's TV. Jay and I played *Mario Kart* online and they started raging because they kept getting blue-shelled. They accidentally threw their controller and it hit and fucking **broke** the TV screen. Jay tried to hide their TV in the outside trash bin as if their parents weren\u2019t gonna notice the 50-something inch flatscreen was missing. Jay got grounded for the rest of the summer (it was mid-July) and their parents refused to buy them a new TV.\n\nJay for three weeks refused to get dressed out for their PE\u2019s swim season because the only rashguard they had was red and *\u201cIt\u2019s the Bloods\u2019 color\u201d* and *\u201cI\u2019m a Crip for life.\u201d* (We live in an extremely affluent area and don\u2019t even have gangs but sure Jay, you\u2019re totally a Crip.) Jay\u2019s parents got an email explaining that Jay was only receiving a 50% participation for every day they didn\u2019t dress out and was currently failing the class. Jay\u2019s parents grounded them and took away their phone but Jay still refused to dress out until their mom caved and bought them a blue rashguard.\n\nJay grabbed a bottle of hard multivitamins from the medicine cabinet and tried to sell them at school as ecstasy pills. Someone snitched on Jay and the school security officer caught them. Apparently, the cops would have been called if there was actual ecstasy, but luckily the school just asked Jay to leave and now they\u2019re at a continuation school.\n\nJay is one of **those** people who watch YouTube on max volume with no headphones in public. They always watch the loudest, most profanity-filled shit too (think Brandon Rogers.) I ordered a huge pack of those little white earbud cases online and I gave them to Jay as a gift. Jay lost\/broke all six earbud sets in a week.\n\nJay will **not** stop flirting with their art teacher, Mrs. Lambert. And we keep telling Jay, dude, you\u2019re sixteen and Mrs. Lambert is married with two kids like it\u2019s never gonna happen. But Jay still insists that someday Mrs. Lambert is gonna leave her wife and daughters to run away with them.\n\nJay thinks that \u201cMy body, my choice\u201d can be applied to them not wearing a seatbelt and therefore they can\u2019t be legally punished for not wearing a seatbelt. They constantly unbuckle themselves, get told to put it back on by one of our parents, and then unbuckle it again as soon as they look away. Recently, we got pulled over because Jay threw their McDonald\u2019s bag out the window and a highway patrol officer saw it. When the officer got closer, he noticed that Jay also had their seatbelt off. Jay tried arguing \u201cMy body, my choice\u201d with the officer. Jay\u2019s dad got fined like $500 because Jay wasn\u2019t wearing a seatbelt and another $750 because Jay was throwing garbage out of a moving car. Jay\u2019s parents made Jay give up their birthday\/Christmas money to help cover the cost of the tickets.\n\nJay says how teenagers nowadays have too much stress because of school and the pressure needs to be lightened, which I completely agree with. The Kevin part is how Jay is on a one-person homework strike until homework becomes optional. Jay was shocked when they failed **all** their classes last year (except for PE and Art.) The school offered a deal to Jay\u2019s parents that if Jay got at least a D in all of their second-semester classes that they failed previously, then Jay could validate their first-semester grades and be passed to the eleventh grade. Jay still refused to do any of their work and is now repeating the sophomore year.\n\nJay (should be) a junior and still doesn\u2019t understand PEMDAS. Jay\u2019s geometry teacher allows them to use a notecard with the order of PEMDAS written on it for classwork and tests, but they still try to solve all of their problems from left to right.\n\nSpeaking of math, Jay hasn\u2019t memorized their multiplication tables either. (Note: Jay\u2019s parents have had them tested several times and Jay does not have Dyscalculia or any other kind of disability that inhibits their mathematical abilities. If Jay had a disability then I would never post about them on here.\n\nJay's English class had them write an in-class paper based on *To Kill a Mockingbird*, which the class just finished reading, for their Winter Final. It was a fairly simple assignment and they had two hours to do it: Write a minimum of two paragraphs summarizing all of the book's major events and possibly earn extra credit by adding in any smaller details. Jay never read the book and tried to BS their way by reading Sparknotes the night before and writing the answers on their arm. The problem with this is that Jay read the Sparknotes for *We Were Liars* instead and tried to use the information from there on the paper. Jay got an automatic 0 on the final because most of it had been plagiarized from Sparknotes, and their parents grounded them for Christmas Break.\n\nJay refuses to shower and the smell is **rancid**. Jay\u2019s parents have to turn off the wifi until Jay takes a shower for at least three minutes. For a while, Jay tried faking by just letting the water run and their parents yelled at them for being dishonest and wasting water.\n\nThat\u2019s everything I can think of right now, I\u2019ll update this if I remember anything else or if Jay says\/does anything else that\u2019s profoundly stupid.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1645471722.0},{"title":"I live with Kevin","author":"WickedEclipse","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/sy7pxp\/i_live_with_kevin\/","text":"Me 29 and husband 30 live with Kevin 26.

It had snowed a ton the past few weeks so it had piled up quite a bit. Kevin decided to play in the snowbank for laughs across the street for fun. We thought nothing of it.\n\nBus comes barreling around the corner, this kid books it towards the street and eats it on the last step, doing a scorpion as he hits the ice covered pavement. He gets up like nothing happened, walks over to the bus while we are all boarding and sits with us all at the back. We had a large group, so to accommodate everyone we sat in back.\n\nWe are about 15 minutes into the ride when I look over at Kevin, and he was incredibly pale (he is first nations\/native so he was naturally darker) but when I say he was pale, he had almost no pigmentation to his skin.\n\n\"Kevin, you okay buddy? You don't look too good.\"\n\"Yeah, I'm fine man. Just really tired. Gonna go to bed when I get home\"\n\nHe gets off at his stop, and goes about his way. We worried for him. A week passes before we see Kevin again. As easy going and cheerful as ever, he greets us after being gone. \n\n\"Hey Kevin, you good? Haven't seen you in awhile.\"\n\"Yeah, I almost f-ing died.\"\n\n Turns out that when he tripped and fell he landed on a glass bottle, it had gone up his shirts (it was only -10\u00b0C so he wasn't wearing his coat) and stabbed him in the stomach, leaving a huge gash. It wasn't until he had gotten home that his mom noticed that he looked really pale, he took off the button up he was wearing that his white shirt was painted crimson with his own blood. He had to go to the hospital to get stitches. I'd have never believed it happened if I hadn't seen them myself.\n\nBy all accounts if he had just went to bed rather than check his shirt he probably would have died.

We were friends through freshman year but I started to distance myself from him in sophomore year for the reasons I'm about to explain.\n\nIn my sophomore English class (15-16 years old) we had a project assigned during second semester. We were put into groups of three and told we had to give a presentation of a historical event (from a given list) and explain why that event was important. We had three days to research and make our presentation, then we would present. This project was, if I remember correctly, 30% of our grade and was given in the place of a final exam. I was partnered with Kevin and a girl I was friends with who I'll call Kate.\n\nThe following Monday we were taken to one of the school's computer labs and got to work on our projects. I should note here that Kevin was absent on Monday, for reasons I would find out later that week. Kate and I had decided to cover the launch of Sputnik, and so got to work researching and making the presentation. Tuesday rolls around and things are going smoothly. Kevin is once again nowhere to be seen. Kate and I work well together and got a lot done in the two days we'd worked so far; the project was basically done - it just needed touch-ups and tweaking on Wednesday and it should be good to go.\n\nFinally Kevin shows up to class on Wednesday. Kate and I explained what the project was again and showed him what we'd put together. I want to point out that our presentation was professional and visually interesting without being distracting: simple transitions, pictures relevant to the topic when needed, etc. \n\nKevin decides that he doesn't like it. \"It's too boring,\" he had said, or something to that effect. He then proceeds to start changing things: adding off-the-wall transitions like he was an eight-year-old just discovering them, I recall this the most, and using a frame from the movie WALL-E where the character has Sputnik on his face - despite the fact that Sputnik burned up in the atmosphere less than three months after launch (we had this in the presentation).\n\nI'm a non-confrontational person, and I believe Kate was too, so Kevin was able to bulldoze over us for these decisions. However, it did eventually get to a point where we both were like, \"No, we aren't changing anything else,\" and forced him to stop. The presentation was ruined, in my eyes anyway, and I was so nervous about our teacher giving us poor marks on our project that I legitimately almost started crying before class the next day - Thursday - when we would be presenting. I was hyperventilating and everything, I was that stressed out over this presentation. The teacher noticed this and sent me into the hall so I could calm down. We ended up getting like a 92 or something, but *man* I did not need that kind of stress.\n\nNow as the title suggests, Kevin had an incident with Viagra. According to him, someone else in the school had dared him to take a Viagra pill for $20, and over the weekend he'd actually done it. He himself described it as, \"the most painful four hours of my life.\" I can't confirm this last bit, but from what I heard Kevin only got $2 from the guy who dared him, as he didn't have anything more on him and said he'd get it to him later; as far as I know, Kevin never got the other $18.

In our workplace, it's a bunch of rowdy men who mess with each other all the time. But ever since we hired this kevin, it was a combination or entertaining and many face palms. Off the bat, he said that he is a combination of a car guy, player, martial artist and business man. He said he owned over 20 cars, planning to make projects out of all of them, owned car lots and hosted events with big name people, sponsored by big car brands, studied martial arts in China for 15 years when he was younger, and had many hook ups with various women. We already smelled bullshit from far away but we might as well get entertained by him. Also note, he only made $12\/h. Apparently he only got his job because, \"always have time to make money\". \n\nWhere to start? So he said he studied martial arts in China and I asked him which province did he study. (I loved watching kung fu movies when I was younger and know bits and pieces of the culture). He said Hong Kong, which is not really in China and that arent that known for martial arts there. I also asked him what style he knew and he said Muay Thai. That style is known in Thailand. I didnt bother to ask him more details after that. \n\nNext he said he owns many cars and car lots and often sells cars. I was actually looking for one and he showed me a photo of a Toytota mr2. I wasnt into cars like that and asked him to bring it over to work. He said sure. Next shift when we worked, I asked him where it is. He said he needed to change the lug nuts, which only takes 10 minutes to change if you have the commercial power tool. I told him this and he didnt say much but said, \"I got a lot of things going on, i am getting evicted from my apartment\". I was puzzled and said, \"evicted? Just sell all your cars and business. Dont you need to feed your family?\" He got pissed and said, \"you dont know what im going through, I dont need to explain shit\". I dropped it but couldnt help but laugh. I cant even tell if he's actually getting evicted but it's hard to feel sympathy. \n\nHeres my favorite. So some employees drive heavy loads and required to take a physical for a DOT certification. Most of us have one and Kevin for some reason wants to look cool in the bigger trucks we drive. Our managers assign us to a physical and we have the option to go during work ours or our own time. Kevin said he went on his own time to go to LAX airport to take the physical. Yes.... he actually said he went to the LAX airport. We were all stunned to reprocess what the hell he said. The manager even said to him, \"I never set up a physical for you\" and Kevin said, \"I made one for myself\". We couldnt believe our ears and snickered. We asked, \"well did you take your physical?\" and he said, \"yeah and got examined\". We all started laughing so hard and said, \"Kevin, we think you just got raped. Did they make you cough when they were feeling your balls?\". I shit you not this is what happened. Kevin got speechless and didnt know what to say.

First of all I am from Sri Lanka and excuse my English as I am still struggling with it. So this Kevin is from my university. For context we study software engineering. I also want to clarify that this story have lot of tech related words. So bear with me.\n\nKevin tries to insert a HDMI cable into a USB port in his laptop during a presentation because he thought it was the right port. When he broke the port because he pushed it so hard he had to pay 35,000 LKR (173 in USD) for a new motherboard. Kevin decided that he knows better than IT department and tried to fix the common room's network hub. His fix is to disconnect all the cables and reconnect them. He disconnect all of the cables and didn't knew how to connect all back correctly. He managed to connect them all wrong and got a earful from the IT Department and Deen. His reason to fix the hub because he can't download games with the connection. Our IT had put blockers for most sites and he thought it was all network hub fault. Kevin thought to charge his laptop with my laptop's charger because the port looks same. He had a notebook type laptop and mine is a Acer Predator which took more watts than his. He fried his motherboard again. Kevin removed key caps from his keyboard so he could clean it properly. He had to bring an additional usb keyboard with him because for few months until he got money to replace his laptop's keyboard. He fully formatted his C drive to install windows because his laptop was slow. He managed to install windows but forgot to remove bitlocker from his other partitions before he fully formatted the C drive. He didn't had a backup key. Kevin had I phone and tried to jailbreak it only to get it in to a boot loop. Thankfully a friend helped him to fix it. Kevin tried to remove the old temperd glass on his phone by breaking it with a hammer, cracking the screen too. He brought a 2TB pen drive only on AliExpress only to find out 2TB is the brand name. The Pen Drive was 8GB.\n\nIn our 2nd year, during the covid rise and island wide lockdowns in Sri Lanka we had to participate all lectures from home. Most of us decided to build PCs. Kevin also wanted to build a PC. Without asking he online ordered all the stuff. He ordered a AMD Ryzen 7 3800x processor. He got a Asus Rog Strix H470-I motherboard for it because he likes RGB lighting. That motherboard is for Intel 10th\/11th Gen processors. Thankfully the shop agreed to exchange it for a matching one. He brought a RTX 2080ti. He spend more than 500,000 LKR for the whole PC. He brought a low quality, Chinese 850w power supply from ebay. It lasted 2 months. He got another power supply from the same brand again through ebay. Fried it within weeks. His parents got mad and decided not to lend more money for another power supply. He sold RTX 2080ti card. Got a lesser graphic card with a Corsair power supply.\n\nKevin decided to ask out his crush he saw on the very first day of the university on that day. She said no. He got obsessed. He decided to stalk her. She got sacred and told her boyfriend. BF beats Kevin up near her house. He decided he will die for true love. Kevin slapped our Student Union president when he tried to convince Kevin to let it go because the girl's BF is from another university. Got beaten up by our guys too. Nevertheless he still stalk the girl.\n\nHe did lot more but this this is already long enough.

And yes, I do think It's a red flag.\n\nShe has also asked me if we live in a bad neighborhood. We do. She said she thought it was safe because of all the cops at our apartment complex. I then had to explain that there were cops at our complex because people were having to call the cops. And also we had to call three times one night because of an attempted break in?\n\nCurrently we are driving back from picking her up. Why were we picking her up you ask? Because she got off at the wrong bus stop. Actually she got on the wrong bus entirely. We've lived here for 2 years.\n\nEDIT:\nSo turns out for the bus situation she did in fact get on the right bus. She just got off at the wrong stop, meaning she looked out the window, said \"yes I live here\" and got off.

She was sure that the spells in Harry Potter were real and would work if you said them out loud, so refused to read the books. But was quite content to watch the movies and let actors say the spells because she \"wasn't the one saying them.\"\n* While watching \"Mr and Mrs. Smith,\" she said she hated Angelina Jolie because she was \"a home wrecker.\" No word on how she felt about Brad Pitt's role in that.\n* Dropped out of comparative religion course on the first day because she \"wasn't ready for that right now.\" (\"That\" being awareness of other religions.)\n* When we went to the dance club, she would stand on the side of the dance floor and waggle her finger at people dancing to Katy Perry's \"I Kissed a Girl.\"\n* This girl had never written an essay during her whole public school career. It took three people to help her through her first draft.\n* One night, we all went out to the park to watch a meteor shower. The rest of us were pointing out constellations, and she was looking for the sun because she knew the sun was a star.\n* She shared with us the story of her first boyfriend, a guy who apparently faked his own death to avoid dating her.

You also asked if he has a job or children: he currently has one of his first jobs right now and has no children. Some of you also said that you don't think he's a Kevin but more of a general asshole, which, yes he *is* an asshole but he's also a Kevin at the same time. SO, without further ado, fuckle your seatbelts for more on Uncle Kev: \n\n* Has 0 concept of time. Kevin will ALWAYS be SUPER late to something no matter what, so if you need him to be somewhere on time, you have constantly circle him like a shark and make sure he's actually getting ready. You can't just tell him he has to be somewhere in the morning the night before (because it's in one ear and out the other), oh no, you have to bang on his bedroom door, make sure he's awake and make sure he's doing everything to get ready. THEN when it's time to go, you have to constantly yell at him to hurry up. \n   * \"Have you tried lying about the time?\" No, and that's because it wouldn't matter. You'd still have to do this just to get his ass out the door. \n* Thinks cleaning is just pouring water on things and sloppily wiping it up with paper towel. We're honestly not sure why he does this, and no matter how many times we've told him \"there's disinfectant spray, you're just making a mess and wasting paper towel and water\" he like...can't compute. Like, you know how you can look in someone's eyes and you just KNOW that no neurons fired? YEAH. It severely pissed off my younger brother, because he's in charge of keeping the kitchen clean (which is something he really likes to do) and Uncle Kev will galumph in after it's sparkling clean, pour water on the counters\/tables\/stove, and then poorly wipe it up. \n* He doesn't sleep at night because of all the copious amounts of coffee he drinks throughout the day and then sleeps all day. He often gets headaches because of this, but he was convinced that my grandparents (who he was living with up until they passed away suddenly) were the cause. They smoked outside the house and he thought the smoke was seeping into the house through the cracks and giving him migraines. He'd throw tantrums every time my grandparents would smoke outside and even did it when they weren't smoking at all. He still didn't put two and two together. \n* When he takes a shower, the bathroom is DESTROYED. He just CAN'T step in the shower, wash, and then get out. It has to be a fucking EVENT that you can hear from outside the door, sounding as though he's an alien who's trying to learn how a bathroom works. We don't know what the actual fuck he does in there, but he can't take a shower without: \n   * Water EVERYWHERE \n   * The toilet flushing MULTIPLE TIMES \n   * The entire bathroom SMELLING LIKE SHIT\n* He doesn't understand how watching TV works. He will talk over the entire thing and then ask you a billion questions about what's happening. No, it hasn't clicked in his mind that maybe you *shut up and watch the episode??* And this is EVERY TIME, dude just CAN'T watch. He has to talk over it about anything that comes to mind and then when the episode is over, it's up to you to tell him everything that happened. You'd think he'd wait a minute between episodes to ask, but he doesn't. He just talks through the whole thing, then the beginning of the next episode is you explaining what happened in the last, then he talks through the rest of it. \n* Got it in his mind that him not ever being around myself and my siblings for YEARS because he couldn't be arsed didn't matter and that he still had an authority over us simply because he was older. He talked shit about each of us to each other, thinking that our trust in him was due to him being older, and honestly didn't believe that we would talk to each other about it. And we did. And he's STILL CONFUSED as to why we're upset. \n   * Further on this, because he's older, he just assumes that he's now all knowing and thought he could add to or teach my older brother about his own major (which is a very complicated science). And yeah, Uncle Kev went to college...but took mostly philosophy classes and could barely write his final paper to graduate.\n\nThis is all I remember about good ol' Uncle Kev. If anything else comes up, trust and believe, y'all will be the first to know.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1643171762.0},{"title":"Kevin And The Bike Tyre","author":"The_V8_Road_Warrior","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/sayzp8\/kevin_and_the_bike_tyre\/","text":"My sister used to go to school with a Kevin, and growing up we just never managed to get rid of him.

When I moved in, I moved into his old bedroom, and he switched into the other room. In his old room, there was a roll-up window blind. First thing I did was to attach a string so I could reach it when it was rolled up. He said \"that's smart, I had to climb onto the radiator for 5 years to get it\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) Our water kettle broke, and he went out to get a new one.\n\nHe texts me \"I bought a cordless kettle, but this is a scam! There is actually no cord, how should this even work!

So instead of completely stopping at a red light, he would drive back and forth and back and forth... on the spot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5) His way to clean the toilet was to sit down in front of it, dip some toilet paper into the toilet water and use it to wipe down the seat and the bowl.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6) When he was supposed to clean the kitchen, bathroom and hallway, he would take one of these flat mops on a stick, get it wet and push it through the entire space in one run. No rinsing, no back and forth, all in one smooth trajectory. From there, he would push the mop, on its stick, into the closet, where it sat, dirty and wet, until the next time.\n\nWhen there still were wet spots on the floor, he would use a tea towel, wipe the floor, then wipe the kitchen counter with the same towel. I complained that this was unsanitary, and he said \"but I just mopped the kitchen floor\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n7) Last one, Kevin had trouble with his printer's ink running out constantly, so he went to get a new one.

The Kevin in this story was my boss, who ran a large mining pool, as well as a datacenter full of ASICs, and a small team of people.\n\n\n\n1. Kevin started the pool by paying 15% above standard PPS payout as a way to entice people to join the pool, thinking it would ultimately attract enough miners to the pool to sway the network in our favor and make it work out. Even if you don't understand the specifics of Bitcoin, it's pretty obvious to anyone that you can't pay out 15% above normal returns in the long term. Somewhere something is missing. Ultimately the end of this was a bunch of pissed off miners owed money they would never get.\n\n\n\n2. As if things weren't already doomed, we had an instance where the pool wallet was \"hacked\" and we lost some coins. Turns out if you don't put a password on a crypto wallet, it's not hard to access it's funds. But Kevin \"didn't know about wallets.\" Mind you at this point actual millions had been invested in ASICs and data center space as well as employees, travel, etc. The logic being that since Kevin had some moderate success in email marketing, he would do great at Bitcoin mining and running a pool.\n\n\n\n3. Kevin stored all his passwords for all the wallets, backend servers, etc. in a keeper on his phone. The phone however, did not have a password. Kevin took said phone on a trip to China. His plan was to just show up and find a chip maker that would make ASIC chips for us based on his specs. He somehow decided it would be a good idea to have a rep from one of the less reputable, more questionable ASIC makers to host him and take him around. When he got back, a few days later he told us all he had lost his phone. Did not bother to cut it off, change any passwords, etc. So once again, massive funds go missing from the pool wallet and it's not a hack because they have the friggin credentials.\n\n\n\n4. We reached a point where the original ASICs were obsolete and needed to be replaced. There were several options. The cheapest option was one we'll call White Spear, because they were known to overheat and catch on fire. Not rumored, known. Vids of early units were everywhere. So in spite of the majority of the team advising against this, Kevin \"couldn't resist a good deal.\" He also listened to the one member of the team also worthy of the title Kevin (Kevin2 had made travel arrangements for the entire team to have a booth at a conference and made arrangements for the conference booth himself. He somehow booked his own ticket for a week later and missed the event). In spite of that, Kevin still listened to Kevin2 on the subject of the ASICs.\n\n\n\nAs best as I can recall, they were powering up the 3rd unit when the first one caught on fire, and so forth. They stopped around 10 units, leaving the other 200+ on the shipping pallets. The company we had purchased them from stopped returning any calls, leaving us to negotiate with AmEx since we had used a Black Card to buy them.\n\n\nThe problem is that the vendor we purchased from never paid White Spear, so as far as White Spear was concerned they were considered stolen and we had them.\n\n\nThe best part is that the guy who stole the phone in China and took all the coins from us was from White Spear.\n\n\nI get that you need to understand a bit about crypto for this to make sense.

On one occasion, he was arguing with a female friend in my Facebook comments about how women don't have any actual medical need for for birth control pills. When my friend saiid that women sometimes need to take birth control for other medical reasons, he told her she was a silly girl and didn't know what she was talking about. When she (correctly) began tearing him a new one, he blocked her and messaged me about how irrational she was being.\n* Kevin decided Alex Jones wasn't enough and began following a Catholic fortune teller. This fortune teller made a prophecy that Barack Obama wouldn't peacefully transition power to Trump in 2016. When it became apparent that the fortune teller's prophecy was incorrect, Kevin refused to admit this was the case and sent us videos of people protesting several blocks away from the inauguration.\n* I am an immigrant. One day, me and some friends had an extra ticket to a baseball game and invited Kevin. At the end of the national anthem, Kevin yelled \"Build the Wall!\" as he stood next to me. When I confronted him, Kevin said he was just play acting as a jingoistic American.\n* Kevin claimed that he had proof that the Sun revolves around the Earth and that there's no way the Theory of Relativity is possible. When I sent him scientific papers proving him wrong, he said that only \"high priests of science\" could understand that stuff.\n* Kevin claimed that ventilators were what killed people who were diagnosed with Covid. He said that when we stopped putting so many people on ventilators, Covid deaths went way down.\n* My cousin's wife died of Covid. I told Kevin I didn't want to hear anything about his conspiracy theories regarding Covid at the same time I told him my cousin's wife had passed away. He sent me a conspiracy theory article 2 hours later. When I called him out on it, he refused to apologize, going only so far as saying that he might not have chosen the best time to send the article.\n* Kevin was in a fantasy sports league with me and my friends. We'd bust each other's chops and make jokes about each other. He'd say all types of crazy things to all of us, but if someone said anything even remotely negative about him, he'd throw a literal tantrum. This is a man who is 48.\n* Finally, we all decided to cut ties with Kevin on January 6, 2021.

My poor, innocent friend Kevina. I sometimes can't tell where to begin with this girl.\n\nKevina and I became friends because little me had befriended a DIFFERENT girl, also named Kevina (who is usually not much of a Kevin. Much.). Kevina discovered this and sought us out, deciding that because both girls were named Kevina, they were destined to be best friends. And because I was already best friends with Kevina-not-Kevina (who I'll differentiate as Sharky from here on in, because I'm already confusing myself), I got yanked along for the ride. I, in fact, still am on the ride.\n\nAlmost ten years later.\n\nI've known Kevina for almost *a decade* now and she still somehow manages to shock me with her pure...Kevin energy. So, in my dear Kevina's honor, here are some of her best Kevina moments to date.\n\n1. Kevina, Sharky and I were goofing around at my house one day. Kevina and I, for whatever reason our preteen brains dreamed up, decide to get into the dog's crates. I had a dog on my lap, Kevina was just sitting in the crate. My mother pulled into the driveway and because human girls really aren't supposed to be in dog crates, I immediately pull the latch open and hop out to greet her. NOTE- this was not a crate with a complicated door or latch. Just a simple metal bar-slides-in-the-other-bar type deal. Kevina, for whatever reason, couldn't get out. Instead, I had to explain to my mother why Kevina was sitting in the dog crate, screaming for Sharky to come let her out.\n2. Kevina doesn't understand video games. Sharky and I both love playing video games together, and it's come in handy over quarantine. Kevina also loves playing games with us. However, Kevina can't *for the life of her*understand that any game except for Roblox. We've tried to get her to play the *simplest* games. Kevina couldn't play Minecraft because she kept forgetting which character was hers and constantly needed saving (note-we were playing Creative Mode). Kevina couldn't play Mario Kart because...well, Kevina just couldn't play Mario Kart. Sharky (who can best my ass at most games even on a bad day) would have to finish her race and take Kevina's controller, just so we could move on to the next race. Kevina *just barely* understood Animal Crossing, and we still had to rescue her a few times (she got into a house and couldn't figure out how to get out). We've long since given up trying. At this point, the Kevina crew and I just play a lot of Roblox.\n3. Which leads into our next Kevina moment. Sharky and I are guilty of playing a lot of pranks, both on Kevina and each other. At some point over quarantine (when Kevina, Sharky and I were playing a *lot* of Roblox, just as a way to spend time together), I stumbled on a TikTok reading something along the lines of \"Breaking news! Roblox will shut down on February 30th!\" Thinking it was funny, I shared it to our little group chat. I didn't witness it personally, but according to Sharky, Kevina was absolutely devastated. Kevina also believed me until March.\n4. Kevina oftentimes makes up new meanings for words without telling anyone what the meanings are. She spent a few minutes today over the phone giggling over herself saying 'fish sticks'. Her favorite thing to tell Sharky recently is \"I disgrace you!\" whenever Sharky does something she doesn't like. When Sharky asked her what she meant, Kevina shrugged and replied \"I don't know.\"\n5. Kevina is no longer allowed to participate in group projects with me, for the sake of both our sanities. This is because at some point, during a world history project with me and another friend, Eve, we ran out of time during class. Thus, Kevina was left unsupervised to finish her part of the project- one slide's worth of notes on the Colombian war for independence . Eve texts me the next morning, *enraged*. I log on to see that Kevina had written a complete mess of a paragraph with absolutely no sources in sight. Upon some investigating, I discovered that Kevina had written about the Colombian Civil War, a person from the District of Columbia, and cited a source about drug trafficking in Colombia. So the wrong war, wrong country, wrong topic and *wrong century*. Kevina first claimed that she fell asleep while writing, then that Eve was supposed to do the Colombia slide. Needless to say, Eve and I were not amused. Kevina was promptly kicked off of the project and I haven't done another with her since.\n6. And finally, the most Kevina thing she's ever said. Kevina is an only child of fairly well-off English parents. I mention this because Kevina is used to traveling (she goes to Europe at least once a year and actually once got mad at Sharky because Sharky admitted she'd never been). So during quarantine, no one was especially surprised when Kevina called us up and told us that since their trip to France was canceled, they'd be visiting family in Arizona (where they wouldn't have to fly). Sharky and I just smiled and congratulated Kevina, going on with our day. At some point, we were on the phone and playing Roblox (as usual) and Kevina starts telling us about her upcoming trip. I'm biting my tongue and listening when Kevina says, \"Ugh. The thing is, I always get so dehydrated when we go to Arizona.\"\n\n\u00a0I (who also gets dehydrated easily) actually could sympathize with this. I nodded along and said something along the lines of \"Oh, yeah. I get that. It's *so* hot and it's so easy to not drink enough water, even here. (CO)\". Kevina nods enthusiastically. \"Yes! But also, they don't allow glasses by the pool!\"\n\n\u00a0I pause. Sharky, apparently thinking along the same lines, asks Kevina what she means. \"Well, they don't let us bring glasses of water down to the pool. And I don't *like* tap water!\"\n\n\u00a0We were just about as confused as anyone reading this is. Sharky asked Kevina why she didn't just bring a water bottle. Kevina reiterated that she didn't like tap water. I reminded Kevina that she could drink water places *other* than the pool. Kevina replied that the whole reason they were *going* was to be by the pool. Apparently, the pools at hotels near us weren't satisfying enough. As near as I can figure, the hotel wouldn't let guests bring their own beverages down by the pool and Kevina objected to the drinking fountains. When asked why, Kevina replied that \"Tap water tastes gross!\" I asked her what she thought the water from her sink was. She replies \"Better water!\" I'm assuming she meant filtered water (I also have a filtered water tap). I asked Kevina to clarify one more time. \"So, just to get this straight. You always get dehydrated in Arizona...not because it's hot or dry, but because your hotel won't let you bring glasses down to the pool?\" Kevina nods enthusiastically.\n\n\u00a0Sharky and I really didn't know how to respond to any of this. Sharky kept trying to coax logic out of Kevina. I, being the petty and dehydrated brat that I am, promptly went to my own sink and filled my water bottle up with the evil tap water. I then came back to my phone and chugged the entire bottle in front of Kevina, who made gagging and retching sounds the entire time. Kevina apparently had an excellent time in Arizona, and Sharky and I never asked how she worked around the problem. But we do occasionally tease Kevina about it today, and she finds it almost as funny as we do.\n\nSo that's the story of my best friend, Kevina. She is, without question, the walking embodiment of the dumb blonde stereotype. She's also one of the sweetest, most die-hard loyal friends I've ever had in my life. I wouldn't trade her for the world. If you made it this far, thanks for reading! Maybe I'll show Kevina and Sharky this post. They'd probably find it funny :)","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1642522995.0},{"title":"Kevin and his enabler mom.","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/s6f9bc\/kevin_and_his_enabler_mom\/","text":"Oh boy, where do I even begin with this twat. I met Kevin in middle school and he was a flat earther and would not shut up about it. He had a huge superiority complex and believed that he was the most intelligent person in the world, and would boast about it every chance he got. Kevin was also a crybaby that would literally throw a tantrum when he didn\u2019t get his way, and his mom supported every bit of it.\n\nOnto the stories.\n\n1. On the first day of 7th grade we all had to introduce ourselves to the class. When it was Kevin\u2019s turn he said he was the most intelligent person in the world. We thought he was joking so we laughed. But Kevin got annoyed and said he was being dead serious. He then said he was a flat earther. You could feel the entire class cringe. Kevin was about to say something but the teacher cut him off and went to the next student.\n2. In LA class, we had a project where we had to choose a topic that we would make a slideshow presentation on and explain it to the class. When Kevin presented it was about flat earth. Everybody saw that coming. The presentation was full of sketchy sources, cringe worthy explanations, and simply bashing people who believed in round earth. His goal with the presentation was to try to convince the class that the earth is flat. Here are some quotes (My memory is foggy so these won\u2019t be exact but the meaning behind them is the same):\n\n\u201cIf gravity is strong enough to pull down buildings, then how are bugs and insects not stuck to the ground?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the earth is round then how can there be flat surfaces?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou round earthers are so gullible. If only you would do as much research as me!\u201d\n\nHe ended his presentation saying we need to open our eyes and push back on government deception. By the end the teacher looked exhausted. The class wasn\u2019t really paying much attention and Kevin just stood there like he was expecting something (maybe he was expecting an applause?) The teacher told him to sit down and that was the end of that.\n\n3. We had a science project where we had to make a model of a cell. The groups were decided at random. I ended up with one of my friends and Kevin. Kevin started drawing a diagram of the model and wasn\u2019t listening to us. Kevin then showed us the diagram, which was just an oval with a smaller red oval in it. The outer layer was labeled \u201ccell\u201d and the red part was labeled \u201cDNA\u201d. We told him this was very inaccurate but he said that we were wrong. Kevin wouldn\u2019t listen to us and said that he was the smartest so we should just do what he says.\n\nWe realized Kevin was not going to budge so me and my friend started making our own plan for the model. Kevin snatched the paper and tore it up. He called us r\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*s and we told him he wasn\u2019t as smart as he thinks he is. Kevin then literally threw a tantrum. He started crying and stomping his feet. The teacher came to see what was going on and we told her what happened, and some kids around us backed us up. The teacher tried to take Kevin out of the class, but he was throwing such a loud and destructive tantrum that he practically had to be dragged out of the class. Half an hour later class was over and we headed off to our next class. On the way we ran into the teacher, the principal, Kevin, and someone we would soon find out to be his mom outside of the office.\n\nThe mom was screaming that her son did not deserve any punishment. Kevin saw us and pointed at us to his mom and said that we were the ones that \u201cbullied\u201d him. The mom screamed that this school was full of r\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*s for not punishing the people that hurt her baby. The principal told us to just head to our class and so we did. Kevin wasn\u2019t in class for the next week so he probably got suspended. We did the project without him.\n\n4. Last story. Remember that LA project? Well one my classmates did a presentation on geology that didn\u2019t feature a flat earth, so obviously that triggered Kevin. Since then, Kevin has been constantly pestering that classmate (we will call him CM for simplicity) to convince him of flat earth and to \u201crevoke\u201d his presentation. Kevin wasn\u2019t making any progress so he switched to insulting CM. Kevin would call him a r\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*ed government shill. CM just ignored him but then Kevin put a paper on CM\u2019s locker saying that CM liked to suck Obama\u2019s d\\*\\*\\* (Obama was president at the time.)\n\nLater that day in the cafeteria, Kevin came up to CM. CM started yelling at him for putting that paper on his locker. Kevin just laughed and said that CM was on the wrong side of history, and he hoped CM could find the truth soon. Kevin then said:\n\n\u201cThe anti-government revolution will come at most in the next 5 years. I\u2019ve tried to get you to open your eyes but you keep refusing. I hope you\u2019re happy with your decision, because once you are the minority don\u2019t come crawling back to me.\u201d\n\nI was laughing so hard I almost fell off my chair. Kevin got angry that I was laughing so he grabbed CM\u2019s lunch tray and started hitting me with it. I pushed him away from me and he fell on his butt. Kevin started crying. The lunch monitor came to see what was going on and CM told him what happened and other kids around the table backed him up. Pretty much the same fiasco that happened during the science project, he threw such a huge tantrum he practically had to be dragged out of the cafeteria. A couple minutes before lunch period was about to end the mom came into the cafeteria with Kevin in tow. She shouted that whoever \u201cassaulted\u201d her son deserved to rot in hell. The principal and the lunch monitor came running behind her and told her to leave. She and Kevin left. I never saw Kevin again so he was probably expelled or his mom removed him from the school.\n\nSometimes I wonder how Kevin is today. Did he grow up and become a decent human being? What was his reaction when he found out that the anti-government revolution did not start 5 years later? Did he graduate high school? I do hope the kid has grew out of his idiotic ways, but considering how his mom is I don\u2019t think that is very likely.\n\nEdit: Sorry about the inconsistent formatting I've tried to fix it.\n\nEdit 2: This story along with every other story I posted on this account are fake.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1642454511.0},{"title":"I think my uncle is a Kevin with a capital C","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/s5peri\/i_think_my_uncle_is_a_kevin_with_a_capital_c\/","text":"My uncle on my mom's side of the family, I realized after reading the posts here, is the Family Kevin. He is a 40 year-old do-nothing blob of disappointment, fat, and lies. The kicker is that he often thinks he's smarter than everyone else. To answer the question if he has mental issues (because learning disabilities run in my family, I have them): we don't know because he refuses to get tested and is thoroughly convinced that nothing is wrong with him and that it's everyone else with the problem. But in the same breath says he should be excused for a boatload of things because he has \"a little dyscalcula.\" (yes that's how he says it). \n\nHere are examples of his Kevinness (fuckle up folks, this ones long): \n\n* Washes dishes with his bare hands no matter how many times he's told to use the sponge and then wonders why the dishes aren't clean enough. Gets grossed out when getting a cup he washed and it's not completely clean, wonders who the hell isn't cleaning the dishes properly.\n* Could barely get a job and most of the jobs he did manage to get turned out to be total scams. Not just scams, but EXTREMELY OBVIOUS that they were scams. Very much a \"too good to be true\" situation. Like, even high school bullies who turn into MLM moms would see these jobs and turn them away.\n* Tried to prove to us that he didn't need a job because he has an app on his phone that, apparently, pays him money for working out?? (It doesn't, also total scam). \n* One of his favourite activities is proving that he is smart by giving out medical advice...that is *wrong.* For example, he had the whole house in a panic because my younger brother was bleeding! Oh no! From where you ask!? His nose! It was a fucking minor nosebleed and we thought my younger brother was bleeding out and needed an ambulance. We had technicians over working on our circuit board and even *they* were concerned. He then instructed my brother to pinch his nose and hold his head back as far as possible and that this was VERY serious, which is again NO DON'T DO THAT YOU ARE SWALLOWING BLOOD AND\/OR COULD GET IT IN YOUR LUNGS (which can result in vomiting)! My mom was so done, he was running around like a chicken with its head cut off while she gave my brother a cold towel and told him to hold is head forward. \n   * Now, you may think \"well, he should be quite relieved to learn that what he knows is wrong and that everything is fine\" but OH NO. He throws a temper tantrum when you tell him he's not right. He actually refused to talk to me for several days when I told him he was wrong about nosebleeds, that they weren't serious as long as the bleeding stopped after ten or fifteen minutes, the cause could literally just be that the air in here is too dry, and that you never hold your head back. His response, \"Well, I had them a lot as I kid, I would know.\" then harrumphed to his room.\n   * He also thought he could cure my mother's fibromyalgia by trying to coerce her into taking this concoction of vitamins. He just couldn't understand that nerve pain issues aren't solved with milk of magnesia. \n* Another way he likes to prove that he's knowledgeable is through conspiracy theories about history. He is the guy that believes ancient Egypt was run by aliens. He is the guy that thinks the holocaust was probably not real or as bad as it was. He is the guy that worships the Romans and tells grandiose tales of them that didn't happen. He believes that all the \"embarrassing\" things about evolution (like the species of human evolving from primates) only belong to white people and that white people are the way they are because they're incestuous monkeys unlike all other races. If you show him evidence that says otherwise, you are lectured about his time in college.\n* He loves the title \"comicbook nerd who was bullied for it but now its cool\" but makes it painfully obvious that he never reads (or probably has never read) any of the comic books. If you ask him about any DC character, he will go into a fantastical story that was never written. How I know? Well, I'm not the most avid reader (I have pretty basic knowledge) but my brother is an avid reader and every time he asks \"when did that happen?\" or point-blank says \"that never happened\", my uncle will just shut down and say \"yes it did\" even when you prove to him that it didn't\n* He's confused and dismayed as to why he got kicked out of a family member's home, thinks she was being unfair especially since he got a job. This is because this family member is at-risk for covid, so much so that she can't get the vaccine because it would just be too risky. When Kevin was figuring himself out and applying for jobs, she told him several times that he couldn't get a job at a covid testing facility because the risk of her getting covid was too great. A covid testing facility was the very first job he applied to and worked at in secret. He then came clean and couldn't figure out why he got thrown out. \n* Thinks that women have their own version of testicles, they're just tucked inside our bodies, but if you punch the spot where they are, you can stun a woman for a few minutes. (I had to punch a wall and scream after typing this, excuse me)\n* Almost didn't graduate from college because he didn't understand why writing a final essay was necessary and didn't want to do it. Claimed his \"dyscalcula\" is preventing him from even seeing the keyboard. Because my grandparents sank so much money into him, they basically had to beg my mom and dad to write it for him. They did. He graduated. He then went on to do nothing with the degree.\n* I caught him snooping in my mom's room while she was out, told him he couldn't rifle through her things for medication she didn't have (tried to say he was looking for hydroxycut, my mom doesn't take it and that he had permission to snoop through her room when he knows we all overheard her yelling at him to stay out of her bedroom). To keep the anger to a minimum, I told him that he'd have to ask her and wait for her to come back but for now, he can't look through her stuff. His very next move was to try to convince the family that I was a drug addict just like his older sister, a woman he has no memories of (she passed away when he was 2 or 3, was never home to boot) and she had no issues with drugs. \n* Saw my mom's really nice iPad and started complaining about his tablet, that he knew how to use and never had issues with, was not working. Asked my mom for a free trial by using her iPad for a while to see if he liked it. She told him no. He is upset and confused as to why this didn't work and called her selfish. Immediately went back to using his \"broken\" tablet with no issues...right in front of her.\n* He has to shove things in your cornea if he wants to show you something because if he has bad eye sight, so do you. Thinks you jerking back is funny and that he intimidated you...sir, you are fat, wear a greying culdesac, and shorter than ME (I'm 5'3, the shortest person in the family), who are you intimidating???\n* Laundry! Laundry is simple, right? RIGHT!? Now, I understand people who were neglected by their parents who don't know how, but Uncle Kev is a different story. So, he doesn't understand that laundry has to be done pretty regularly, especially with items you use a lot. He doesn't wash anything until it smells so bad that you smell it through the walls. THEN when he finally decides to wash his sheets\/clothes, it's a JOURNEY. In the laundry room in our building, the directions for how to use ALL the machines are on the machines, written in easy to read font and with very simple sentences. He not only needs the directions constantly, but three people to show him exactly how to do it, asks a million questions...every SINGLE TIME. \n* Doesn't at all think he's overweight. He says it's muscle. Tries to say it has to be muscle and that he's burning fat because he \"never eats\" and I believe he had to have weight loss surgery. If this is the case, then WHY are you looking for weight-loss supplements and WHY do you eat several plates of unhealthy food in the middle of the night to the point that we never have leftovers or snacks? WHY are your eating habits ten-times worse than the fucking party sub guy?\n* Drinks copious amounts of coffee with all the cream and sugar. Doesn't understand why he can't sleep and why his stomach always hurts. \n\nThis is all I can think of about Uncle Kev for now, probably more that I missed. All I can say is that thank god him trying to be a veterinarian didn't work out. He does not live with my family anymore, he's currently in a crusty hotel somewhere because his Kevinness makes him unable to live with anyone without driving them crazy.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1642377497.0},{"title":"My former coworker was a Kevin","author":"BlacnDeathZombie","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/s51wrf\/my_former_coworker_was_a_kevin\/","text":"I worked with this guy who was 22, sales and extremely eager to succeed in life.

He ha a belt witch spelled THOMMY HILFIGER and a \u201cgold\u201d watch larger than any sized I\u2019ve seen. Though enthusiastic, he wasn\u2019t very bright with a touch of casual ignorance racism ans  even though his father was Mexican he was, as he phrased it himself, \u201cwhite passing\u201d. I spent 8 months with him (I\u2019m at least 20 years his age), trying to open his mind. Important to ad is that I am myself an immigrant from a Scandinavian country. Here is my stories:\n\n\n- A lady said she was from the UK and Kevin managed to forget this since he a few hours later tried to figure out where London was located. His first guess was \u201cis it like next to Paris?\u201d. I\u2019m a bit unsure if he actually knows the difference between UK and England, but I just didn\u2019t had enough spoons to ask\u2026 the reason he went down this rabbit hole was because \u201comg did you see how fucking beautiful she was and are they all that beautiful over there?!\u201d.\n\n- He\u2019s thinks Bolivia is in Europe \u201cwho expects anyone to remember all the countries in the world anyway\u201d. On the other hand, he doesn\u2019t know Denmark is actually a country either.\n\n- \u201cPeople with diabetes can\u2019t be firefighters because if they get hurt, like on their axe or a huge rip over their back, then they will develop gangrene and die\u201d. Then he spent an hour arguing with me how dangerous diabetes is. Now, to be fair, this is the US and diabetes is definitely not handle very well. I am though sure that even people with diabetes can be firefighters in the US.\n\n- I explained that I wasn\u2019t so sure about taking my husband names because why should I? And Kevin got extremely upset \u201cI will never marry someone who doesn\u2019t take my last name because that\u2019s how it is. Unless she makes six figures then I do it of course!\u201d So apparently\u2026 Misogyny is not as important as money.\n\n- my boss had to had surgery and Kevin cut off her just to ask about \u201cWhat type of sedation do they use for surgeries? Venom?\u201d\n\n- \u201cIt\u2019s always the man who pays for dates and if they are like two gay ladies, then the one who is most manly, will pay.\u201d Note that our boss was actually lesbian so we of course poked him about his pompous \u201cmen always pay\u201d and that\u2019s when he explained that it\u2019s apparently the more \u201cbutch\u201d lady who pays if they are lesbian.\n\n- \u201cI feel sorry for blind people because they can\u2019t work with anything because they are disabled and once you\u2019re disable you\u2019re not allowed to work\u201d. Kevin had never before encountered the possibility that disabled people do indeed work.\n\n- After I explained that my dog has allergies and need to see the vet because he\u2019s been shaking his ears, Kevib immediately asks if my dog is allergic to \u2026peanuts.\n\n- Kevin\u2019s geography knowledge was not very good and he guessed if Venezuela is in Europe.\n\n- When I (an immigrant) talked about The Donner\u2019s Party, Kevin (born in Southern California) didn\u2019t believe me that that it happened in California and was convinced that it was \u201csomewhere in the Himalayas\u201d. We googled it. He was of course wrong. Which I knew but at this point I tried training him in searching for sources instead of rely on hearsay.\n\n- When describing the movie Alive taking place in the Andees (South America), Kevin is confused because it wasn\u2019t either the Rocky Mountains, Sierra Nevada \u2026or the Himalayas. He couldn\u2019t neither wrap his head around the fact that the Andees aren\u2019t covered in rainforest, even if they are in Latinamerica.\n\n- Kevin has several times trying to convince me how ghost are real by \u201cshowing me real cctv fotage\u201d on YouTube and he won\u2019t accept that they may have been manipulated. I mean, don\u2019t take my word for it but YouTube videos?! \n\n- Kevin claims that the pyramids are alien because no one knows how they are built and I explained that they aren\u2019t alien and that we actually have a good idea of how they are built. I also happen to have a degree in  archeology but since Kevin doesn\u2019t believe like stuff, I decided to show him how they were made by using a YouTube video \u2026since we apparently have established that to be a proper scientific media source\u2026 he did not believe me.\n\n- Kevin hardcore beliefs in god and to prove me wrong he googled and find the first  article about a 4-5 year old kid dying in the operation and was brought back to life and told everyone he saw Jesus. My coworkers main argument was \u201c4-5 year olds can\u2019t make up that type of lies so it has to be truth\u201d. \u201cThis is fact, right there\u201d pointing at the article\u201d so you can\u2019t argue against it!\u201d. Also, hell exist and when we die we \u201cgo to sleep and our soul will leave our body because that\u2019s the only things can be true\u201d. He does though acknowledge other religions and whatever people believe in, is where they will end up \u2026except atheists because not believing doesn\u2019t count for not ending up somewhere and \u201cwe will see who\u2019s speaking the truth when you die\u201d.\n\n- Kevin thinks Portugal is close to Japan.\n\n- Kevin doesn\u2019t know that Native Americans was once incorrectly named \u201cIndians\u201d because Columbus thought he was in India. But he knows that that\u2019s a bad word and won\u2019t use it since \u201cthat\u2019s a fighting word dude\u201d. Note that he\u2019s a full born and raised American  and I\u2019m the immigrant.\n\n- He\u2019s not against gay people but he explained to me how having \u201cgays in the army won\u2019t be a good idea because they are more feminine\u201d. He didn\u2019t quite explained how that is and I honestly didn\u2019t wanna ask since he\u2019s just too uneducated\u2026 When I explained that the army probably already has a ton of gay people without him knowing, he looked a bit puzzled \u201cyeah maybe\u201d.\n\n- He believes HIV will immediately be transmitted via a kiss on the forehead. \n\n- He finally asked me how we celebrate Thanksgiving in my home country and after the longest 30 min, I realized that he assumed all \u201cwhite\u201d people has colonized their lands so it\u2019s therefore natural that we also celebrates some sort of thanksgiving too. I had to explain to him that no one lived there before and we were first and no, we did not in fact conquered anyone to settle there because before us, since there was kilometers of thick ice covering this area 10 000 years ago.\n\n- \u201cDiabetic cutting toenails have to be careful because if the cut wrong they can get an infection, sepsis and die.\u201d Kevin was very obsessed with people immediately dying by diabetes\n\n- Person enter my work to ask for assistance with their problem but leaves shortly after. My coworker and I discussed why he left so soon, and I suggest that he might not have understood us based of his thick accent which made it obvious that English wasn\u2019t his first language and this may have act as a barrier to understand what we could provide him.

We were talking and I was just trying to be nice since he had no friends on the street. This was when he dropped this bombshell and his convoluted conspiracy theory about Goldfish. The animals, not the snack.Thatsmilesback.\n\nK: \"Did you know that Goldfish are smarter than a Supercomputer?!\n\nMe: \"Uh, K... They are NOT smarter than Supercomputers. Trust me.\"\n\nK: \"No, they ARE smarter than Supercomputers! I know they are!\"\n\nMe: \"No, K. They forget what they did three seconds after doing so. It's how come they are so easy to overfeed.\"\n\nK: \"No! They do that on purpose to hide the fact they are so smart! They don't want to reveal their secrets!\"\n\nI resist trying to facepalm and figured this was why he had no friends. Then what he said next made me worried, not for him to hurt himself, but because of what it implied.\n\nK: \"I will prove it! I will get my parents to get me a Goldfish and I will teach it to speak so that it can reveal it's secrets!\"\n\nK then stormed off and headed home, determined to get a goldfish and teach it to speak. He never spoke about his project again, and avoided speaking of it if asked. To this day, I still have no idea how this project panned out, but I feel he never managed to teach a Goldfish to speak to him. I hope y'all enjoyed this small story about my Kevin! If anyone wants to use this anywhere else, I don't mind. Even though I doubt anyone will even find it interesting.\n\nEdited to fix some mistakes.","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1642314005.0},{"title":"Don't Eat Bro's Cooking!!!","author":"GrizeldaLovesCats","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/s4ig43\/dont_eat_bros_cooking\/","text":"My brother is a Kevin in many ways. He is especially Kevin-ish with food. On a visit to our grandparents, he insisted that pancakes were best with French dressing instead of syrup. Grandpa was \"out of touch\" to think that anyone still used syrup. Bro then drowned his pancakes in French dressing. Grandpa made him eat it. After a few bites, Bro was begging not to have to eat that mess. \n\nWhen he was 16, he got a job in a diner. He was NOT a cook. One day he swore that western omelets are made with pickle relish. \"It looks like green pepper but it is always pickle relish no matter where you go for one.\" By that time (I was 14), I pretty much refused to eat anything Bro cooked. He was \"nice\" and fixed dinner for the entire family that night. Because I questioned his expertise in cooking, he made us each a western omelet using pickle relish. He didn't tell our parents what he did, just said they were western omelets. Both parents spit out the first bite and asked him WTF????? He called them low class Westernized peasants for not liking his cooking. He made a huge stink about us refusing to eat what he cooked. Because he was incredibly rude during his tirade at our parents, he did not get any of the pizza we ordered. \n\nWhen he was 20, he came home from the Army. He wanted to cook breakfast for us. I was hesitant about eating anything he cooked, but I figured I could be nice and at least try. Surely he got better to keep from poisoning himself? Nope. He made breakfast. The toast was good. The sausage wasn't fully cooked because \"that is the best way and of course it won't make you sick\". The scrambled eggs looked weird, They were gray. And they were gritty. He explained that his new recipe for scrambled eggs made them so much better! Instead of milk, he used coffee. And some of the grounds for \"texture\". It was just so awful. Our parents couldn't believe he wanted us to eat that.  Of course he had a tantrum because we were being \"rude, low class and horrible\" for not eating the food he put in front of us. That he slaved over for a whole half hour. It took quite a long time for either of my parents to want to eat anything he cooked.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1642246307.0},{"title":"\u201cI go to university with a little goblin man\u201d","author":"babybreadcrumb","url":"\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/rz2ci3\/i_go_to_university_with_a_little_goblin_man\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1641734756.0},{"title":"Kollege Kevin","author":"saltysnatch","url":"\/r\/TrueOffMyChest\/comments\/rz2ci3\/i_go_to_university_with_a_little_goblin_man\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1641705495.0},{"title":"Kevin the Copper","author":"low_myope","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/rvvat3\/kevin_the_copper\/","text":"These short stories pertain to a friend of my family whilst I was growing up, and is from around the year 2000. \n\n\nSo for context, Kevin was an AFO (authorised firearms officer) in the UK. As gun control in the UK is much more stringent that in some other places (i.e. the USA), it is not the norm for police officers to be trained to use firearms. In fact, they have to go through a series of interviews, psychological and physical fitness tests, and must undergo annual refresher training and testing. With this in mind, it is somewhat remarkable how Kevin ever ended up being certified to carry a firearm.\n\n\n**So for the first story:**\n\n\nAs Kevin was an AFO, he was regularly assigned to patrol near the local military base whilst military exercises were being undertaken. The reason for this was to ensure that no civilians accidentally managed to get onto base and be put at risk during live fire exercises. There weren\u2019t always fences to mark the edge of the base as it lay next to a large beach (several miles long) with rolling sand dunes. \n\n\nDuring such an event, the police received a call to say that a \u2018group of young men are racing their bikes around the sand dunes, please remove them from the area.\u2019. So Kevin drives to the beach and finds two young boys (no older than 10) riding along the beach. He takes action by putting on his sirens, and racing along the beach in his 4x4 chasing these boys. It doesn\u2019t take long to catch them, and he arrests them and throws them into the back of his vehicle. In addition to this, he arrested their mother for trying to intervene in these arrests.\n\n\nWhen he returned to the station, it turns out that he had driven to the wrong beach (nowhere near the base), and had arrested three members of a family enjoying a holiday outing. The young men on bikes who he was meant to apprehend had inadvertently entered into the base leading to the exercise (involving hundreds of troops, APCs and tanks) had to be suspended. For this he received a formal warning, an apology was issued to the family, and Kevin became the laughing stock of the station.\n\n\n**The second story:**\n\n\nSo following on from the first story, Kevin\u2019s annual training and testing for his firearm certification were brought forward due to his warning. \n\n\nKevin was a big fan of the old wild west films. I think that in a way he saw himself as some sort of town sheriff since he was issued with his pistol. So at the certification, he was due to undertake a firearms test at the firing range. During the assessment, Kevin decided to emulate the famous trope which is endemic Hollywood movies - blowing the barrel of the gun after shooting it.\n\n\nSo after firing each round, Kevin was blowing the barrel. Why no one intervened is anyone\u2019s guess. But the inevitable happened, where Kevin accidentally reversed his cadence. So instead of shooting, and then blowing the barrel, he pointed at the target, blew air out of his mouth, then pointed upwards just in front of his face, and fired the pistol directly upwards. Amazingly he hit the only object in the room which wasn\u2019t bulletproof (the fire alarm sensor was above him), which led to the entire building being evacuated. \n\n\nAfter this moment of lunacy, his firearms certification was removed from him for life, and he was temporarily suspended due to his actions (after receiving a second warning in as many weeks). \n\n\n**The third story:**\n\n\nWould you believe it, but Kevin was happily married. Whilst on his temporary suspension (as mentioned previously), he and his wife chose to go on a romantic retreat to Tenerife. I mean, what could go wrong?\n\n\nA few nights into their stay, Kevin and his wife were invited to drink in a small bar off the main strip. After suitable \u2018lubrication\u2019, the barman asked Kevin if he wanted to enter into a competition to win a 2 week all expenses paid Mediterranean cruise. Kevin couldn\u2019t say no to this, so entered this competition. An hour or so later, the barman informs Kevin that \u2018he has had a call\u2019 telling him that Kevin had won the competition. The catch was, that to secure his place, Kevin had to pay a \u2018booking fee\u2019 to secure his spot. \n\n\nFor most people, this would throw up so many red flags, it is unbelievable, so surely Kevin, an experienced police officer with 20 years under his belt would not fall for this. Kevin isn\u2019t most people of course, and before the night was out, he was been defrauded out of his, and his wife\u2019s entire life savings.\n\n\nTo top things off, when he returned to the UK, Kevin asked to have his story put into the local newspaper. I don\u2019t know why he did this, as it made the entire county know that he had been stupid enough to fall for a blatant con when on holiday.\n\n\n**Finale:**\n\n\nThere is no real happy ending here. Not long afterwards, Kevin developed alcoholism, and lost his job with the police due to being intoxicated on the job. He also lost his driving license for being caught drink driving by one of his old colleagues. He is still with his long suffering wife, but is on the shortest leash imaginable. To say that his marriage is on the rocks is an understatement.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1641305571.0},{"title":"Kevina is annoyed someone had the audacity to stop her from killing herself and her neighbours","author":"QueenElsaArrendelle","url":"\/r\/EntitledPeople\/comments\/ru2pg1\/somehow_im_the_bad_guy\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1641165583.0},{"title":"Kevin and getting rid of bugs","author":"PopTartsArePeopleToo","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/rusxbr\/kevin_and_getting_rid_of_bugs\/","text":"This was a few years ago at a backyard gathering.

In order to do so, I had to act as a secondary agent for someone who had purchased an agency for six weeks as some sort of ritual to be sure I understood all their systems. Well, I got saddled with a new agent who had never worked in insurance in his life but his parents each ran very successful agencies with the company so via nepotism he got to skip the vetting process. It quickly became obvious that that was a mistake. Here's a list of just some of the fun things I got to endure with this particular Kevin being my boss.\n\n- Kevin is deeply studying his business card for several minutes as though he's deep in thought. I am him what he's doing. He says, \"Can you help me figure out what this word is? I can't sound it out.\" It was 'Insurance' and later that day he got into an argument over the fact that everyone spelled 'round' wrong because you couldn't have two sound letters (vowels?) Next to each other.\n\n-He was putting the decals on his window with his name on it. He couldn't get the air bubbles out so he decided to use a hammer to try to pop them. He cracked his plate glass window and asked if we could hide the cracks for him.\n\n-When his first client came in (the agency was inherited so there was already a book of business) he offered him a $50 gift card to stay with us as we were beat in price by a competitor(Highly illegal). He then proceeded to run the customer's card for an additional $50 and gave him the gift cards that he purchased. He then purchased several more $50 gift cards with the gentleman's card and offered them to other people who would come in for insurance. \n\n-He purchased security cameras, not knowing that they had to be plugged in and nailed them randomly around the rooms. He nailed straight through the body of the camera and did not use any of the included mounts. \n\n-He hired a girl in a wheelchair and asked if she was born with the wheelchair and if it hurt her mom when she was born with the chair. \n\n-He ripped up all the hard wood flooring in his office and got upset that there wasn't carpet underneath. \n\n-He tried to delete the 'Do Not Call' list so he could call those people. When that didn't work, he deleted the operating system on his computer. We were unable to conduct business for three days as a result.\n\n-He set off the sprinkler system ruining all of our equipment three times in three weeks by microwaving aluminum foil. Each time he told the wheelchair girl, \"Can you take the blame this time? I don't want the fire fighters to know it was me.\"\n\n-He would regularly close his blinds and turn off his lights, then within ten minutes ask if I knew how to unblock sites on his computer.\n\n-He drove into the pillar in front of the tae Kwon do place next door severely damaging his car and leaving paint all over the pillar. He moved his car one spot over and when the tae Kwon do guy addressed the issue he denied the whole thing. This happened twice. \n\n-The ethics committee of the parent company came to investigate\/shut him down and he locked them out and tried to sneak out the back door setting off the alarm getting the police out for unethical business practices. When they actually got to address him he said, \"You're not the boss of me. My name is on the building.\"\n\nThere were definitely more instances but these were definitely the most telling instances that came to mind. I tried to survive as long as I could but after three weeks I went to work with another agency.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1640640476.0},{"title":"Kevina thinks any event with a 1 in 20 chance is so unlikely it can't happen, and that an odd number can be exactly divisible by 4 if it is large enough (I will include her proof in the comments)","author":"Jonseroo","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/rpr1nz\/kevina_thinks_any_event_with_a_1_in_20_chance_is\/","text":"I dated this Kevina for a while and after we split up we lived together as friends for ten years. She was very dear to me, and often kind to me, but I can't help thinking her world view was so different to reality it was like she was trying to navigate in New York with her map upside-down, and it's a map of London. That's rather unfair. She never literally did that. But she did do all these things:\n\nWhilst we were dating she didn't think she needed to use contraception because the chance of conceiving is only 1 in 20 so it can't ever happen. I always insisted on it, because I felt I was too young to be a parent, but I was happy to help out with her children after she got pregnant instantly with the first boyfriend she had after me, and with the next one.\n\nShe was a pagan and she thought she could use Tarot cards with her friends to predict her future. She also thought she could just do them over and over, all day, until she got the future she wanted where she dated an American film star.\n\nShe also thought, like Terry Pratchett's guards, that if an event had only a one in a million chance of happening then it was almost a certainty. She was obsessed for years with her film star. To preserve his anonymity let's call him Johnny Depp. That's not his real name. She saved up for a trip to America to meet him, because the cards and other occult signs had told her they were \"soul mates\". What are the chances? Must be one in a million! She was delighted to discover that the first guy she hitched a lift with in Los Angeles was a friend of Johnny Depp! What are the chances? One in a million, surely! Sadly, Johnny Depp didn't pick up when the guy called him (he's a busy man) and when this guy hit on her she had to have sex with him as he was still her best chance to meet Johnny Depp. I thought, and you may think, that she'd been taken advantage of, but she didn't regret it. It was all part of the adventure. I kind of admire that about her.\n\nI realize as I'm typing this that I could come across as a bit of an incel\/redpillock\/etc, jealous of her seeing these other men. That's not a good colour on me, is it? But I always had my own romances going on, and I was supportive of hers, although I sometimes urged caution, as in the next example:\n\nThis guy was interested in her, and I didn't think she should go with him because he was in a relationship. Plus, his girlfriend had wanted to be in an open relationship but he'd vetoed that, whilst still thinking he should be able to have sex with other women. That didn't sit right with me. It seemed caddish. He was quite a character. He was a very manly man's man, for example he insisted on mansplaining the concept of centre of gravity and sword pommels to me despite me repeatedly telling him I have had training with swords and this isn't new information to me. He was proud of his combat ability too. He told me he could take any number of punches to the face. We had an impromptu game of strip Trivial Pursuit with him once and found out he wore a thong. I liked that about him. Also he said he was up for the idea of bisexuality but when he imagined himself doing it he just didn't get excited, which I thought was open-minded for a straight guy at the time. Anyway, Kevina wanted to go with him, as far as I could see, just for the lols. I'd recommended keeping it on the down-low, to avoid drama, and she told me, \"What's the point in having sex with him if I can't tell anyone about it?\" She delighted in telling us how he had taken his shirt off and said, \"Look at my chest hair. Do you want to touch it?\" Sadly, the relationship didn't work out because he said something mean about Johnny Depp and she tried to light him on fire. Which he was most offended by, as he claimed he had a phobia about being set on fire. As if everyone else is okay with being set on fire?\n\nKevina was chaotic with her belongings. She didn't believe in cupboards, so all her stuff was just all over the floor at all times, on the stairs and in the bath. Brace yourself for this one: she could never find her gloves because when she got in she would take them off and drop them in different rooms. What kind of person doesn't keep both their gloves in the same place?\n\nFor years I filled in her housing benefit forms so she could get her rent paid. She wouldn't do it herself because. \"I shouldn't have to fill in a form just to have somewhere to live.\" I'd go with her to the benefits office to make sure they didn't mess her about. Once I gave her the forms as we were leaving the house, we walked three miles to the benefits office, and then she realized she'd put the forms down somewhere before we left.\n\nI am a bit of a health and safety nut. Kevina and her friends used to call me \"Emergency Man\" because I would always be worrying about accidents. For example, I objected to the way Kevina balanced her burning joss sticks. A joss stick doesn't have a pommel, and its centre of gravity changes as it burns. She thought it was quite safe stuck in the net curtain, but I worried it was a fire risk, not just because of the balance issue, but also WHY IS IT IN A NET CURTAIN? They are notoriously flammable! She said I shouldn't have made a big deal of it as she was \"only in the next room.\"\n\nHer kids would get nits. That's not uncommon or blameworthy. But they would keep on getting them. I always had to have my hair shaved. Each time I'd insist we go to the chemist, we'd get the treatment, she'd take them into the bathroom to apply it, and then have to do it again a couple of weeks later. Eventually I found out that this was because she only washed the hair of one of her children each time, because it was \"such a faff.\"\n\nShe got into what I saw as an unrealistic diet, believing she could just live on universal energy and not eat anything. She had a book about it. She said I was cruel for pointing out that the picture of the author on the cover made it look like it was a book of schemes to defeat He-Man, although she did admit that the author had since died.\n\nI've got so many more examples, but they veer off from her being a Kevin to her just being a bit careless and wild. She would definitely say I am the Kevin, and In fairness she could offer just as many examples of things I had done:\n\nShe sneered at how I was content just to be in a relationship with a \"mediocrity\".\n\nShe was annoyed I wouldn't bet my house on a poker game like she suggested. \"We could have had two houses!\"\n\nShe said I got burgled because I built a portcullis to keep my PC safe, which is what \"attracted the burglar\". As I have explained before in another Reddit post, the portcullis is only visible from inside the house. She thought I had imagined the burglar so hard I had made them real.\n\nObviously I've chosen those examples so she still looks like the ridiculous one. What she'd really say about me was that I only hung around with pagan ladies for the nudity. She's got a point. I mean, it wasn't for intelligent conversation with rational people. Every time I write about a pagan friend there will be a pagan in the comments telling me they are not all like that, and it gets funnier every time. I know there are some charming, kind, sensible pagan people. Do forgive me for assuming, from my time spent among pagans, that the Venn diagram of people who believe in the healing power of herbal teas, homeopathy, the gambler's fallacy, astrology, the world as a goddess, unicorns, a horned god of the woods...is a circle. Like if you believe one magical thing you have to believe all of them? Can't just one magical thing be true? I mean, I once took a chance on wizards being real but I never believed in Reiki.\n\nI thought this would be amusing but I do feel mean for writing it. I am looking at her foolishness in the past with the wisdom I only have from age. She will have grown wise and aged away from her own idiocy as I have. I'm not in touch with her now. We fell out ten years ago over something disrespectful she said about World of Warcraft.\n\nFinally, the other maths issue: if anyone wants to give their reason why an odd number cannot be exactly divisible by four I can write her rebuttals in the comments. She had an answer for every proof I tried to assert. Go on. It'll be fun. You might learn something. Like in a Socratic dialogue. Well, it's more like a stress test for your sanity.\n\nEdit: I have had so much fun chatting about issues arising from this post, but please no more maths comments. I set it up so I could just keep replying, \"But what if it was an even bigger number?\" which is what my friend thought was an absolutely sufficient proof that her feelings about numbers were right. In the end isn't it an epistemological question? We trust that our brains \"know\" what is right, just as she trusts hers. Who is to say which is right? Us? Doesn't that seem biased?","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1640622195.0},{"title":"Kevin ruins Christmas","author":"philmtl","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/rp5apc\/kevin_ruins_christmas\/","text":"  \n\nKevin in this story how did he ruin Christmas, well let\u2019s start that Kevin is having a midlife crisis he is well off, his kids are becoming adults and he is starting to gain some weight from living comfy.\n\nEvery year we have Christmas as their house though its over hours drive and its a pot luck style where each family brings their own food. the real competition is baking seeing which aunt or mothers baking gets eaten the most at the event who \"wins\" best desert, its nothing official but between them they know and show their love to the family through delicious food. \n\nWell, this year Kevin decided he would provide desert, and told all the family not to bring any desert as he had bought enough for everybody from a renowned bakery.

And I mean SUPER HOT. You can turn the shower faucet on cold and water will still be too hot. Like when I come to visit, I never know how to shower, wash my hands, or anything involving water.Don\u2019t get me wrong I love hot showers and warm water but it\u2019s to the point where my mom told him that if someone gets burnt that they could sue him.  And here\u2019s one example of where it came to bite him in the ass. \n\nLast weekend my dad worked out and wanted a hot bath in my his bathtub. It\u2019s one of those bathtubs that are kinda like a hot tube it\u2019s super deep, spacious and has the jacuzzi jets. He started the water and the water was not hot enough for him, so like the crazy person he is he went downstairs to water heater and turned it up higher. He took himself back upstairs, got in and enjoyed himself. The windows and doors to the bathroom were closed so the steam built up and he got dizzy. He got out let the water drain and went on with his day. \nWhile eating dinner, the dining room is over looking the family room, he saw a shit ton of water on the floor. He freaked out and ran over there to figure out where it was coming from. The ceiling was cracked in three places and the ceiling, couch, fireplace and floor was covered in water. \nTurns out that the water melted whatever was holding the the tub up underneath. So when the tub melted, it went straight under the tub which is built into the floor. The water drained into the hole and melted it\u2019s way through the ceiling. \nAnd he still has the water up super hot-_- I just got home to visit for Christmas and burned my hands while washing them.\n\nEdit: So what from  what I'm reading in the comments about how the ceiling probably didn't melt and from further looking at all the damage: Something in the tub did crack from the heat, it is like to big splits along the faucet. The ceiling didn't melt but it did crack open from the water damage in four not three places. In all my dad has to replace the tub, the hard wood floor, and has to get the ceiling\/fireplace fixed.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1640403826.0},{"title":"Kevin thinks he is a Time Traveller.","author":"Jonseroo","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/rno2fd\/kevin_thinks_he_is_a_time_traveller\/","text":"  I had a friend who was a pagan, who sometimes brought home to our sofa examples of pagan manhood. I don\u2019t intend to be disrespectful to anyone\u2019s religion, and to be fair she only introduced me to two pagan men who claimed to be the reincarnations of historical figures.\n\n  The first puzzling thing was that there was an overlap in who they claimed to be reincarnations of. They both had Jim Morrison down in their lists. Even more puzzlingly, one of them had been born before Jim Morrison died. I am not an expert in metempsychosis (or psychosis), so maybe I am just revealing my ignorance of reincarnation by assuming it follows linear time? If this esoteric subject interests you then please do keep reading, because I am leading up to a practical magical demonstration of how time is not in fact linear!\n\nOne of these Kevins needed help from his fellow pagans with a time travel project. A time travel project! He needed them to help him perform a ritual to send his astral body back in time to give his earlier self relationship advice. Which would admittedly be a useful thing to be able to do. But is such a thing possible? Now, you're a hardened, Reddit sceptic. I know (from how slightly implausible stories of my own life have been received) that you are unwilling to believe anything a little out of the ordinary. And I would be right there with you in this case. Except that Kevin provided EVIDENCE of his claim! Well that puts it in a completely different light, doesn't it, you doubting Thomases? Not so sure now, are we? Oh, you still want to hear the evidence? Ah, okay. His evidence was that last year he had met his time travelling future self and been given good advice by him. So now he just needed his pagan pals to help with the time travelling ritual to complete the circle and make sure it did already happen. Which it already had did was going to.\n\n It's like Back to the Future but instead of a scientist and a car there's a bonfire in a field and a near fatal dose of ketamine, which Kevin insisted he needed to detach his mind from our physical reality. Did he, really, though? He seemed quite far along in that process already. Maybe I shouldn't judge. I am not an expert in horse tranquilizers or time travel.\n\n What advice would you give your earlier self? Personally, in this instance, I would have passed back advice relevant to the time travelling ritual itself, such as, \"Perhaps take a smidge less ketamine,\" or, \"Don't stand quite so close to the ritual bonfire.\"\n\nIf I was telling you this story face to face I would pause there for dramatic effect. Just so you can imagine possible consequences. Burnt shoes? Flaming trousers?\n\nNo, it was a little worse than that. During the ritual he passed out, fell head first into the bonfire, and his friends had to drag him out by his feet. Days later, when he was coherent again, he claimed that it had been a resounding success.\n\n But success comes at a price. Galileo lived under house arrest for heresy. Marie Curie was buried in a lead coffin. Kevin had to wear a bobble hat until his hair grew back.\n\n\nAddendum: I checked my diary because I like to be absolutely honest with you, and it's not quite how I told it. One pagan Kevin said he was the reincarnation of Aleister Crowley and Jim Morrison, whereas the other, older, pagan Kevin claimed to be the reincarnation of Aleister Crowley but had Jim Morrison as his spirit guide. So I shouldn't have mocked him. Also, who are we to say they were wrong? You wouldn't tell the Dalai Lama that believing he's the reincarnation of a historical figure is attention-seeking teenage nonsense and he needs to grow up.","upvote_ratio":0.96,"created_utc":1640358294.0},{"title":"\"So, I Go On A Date With This Guy Kevin...\"","author":"BurntSchmidt","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/rng4wn\/so_i_go_on_a_date_with_this_guy_kevin\/","text":"So my friend Jason sets me up on a date with this guy Kevin.  I'd been unlucky dating, so he shows me a picture.  I think he's somewhat nice looking, so I agree on the date.  He calls me the day before and we have a conversation.  He seemed nice enough, though he did go on and on about his career as a 5th grade teacher for longer than I'd asked, and he hardly asked me any questions aside from what kind of restaurants I liked.  I named several, but at one point, which I guess he'd taken a little too literally, I mentioned that I liked spicy food.\n\nSo he's supposed to pick me up at 6:30.  It's 6:41, and without so much as a courtesy text letting me know he'd be running a bit late, he comes speeding down my street and literally slams his brakes once he reaches my driveway, skidding several feet and leaving tire marks which remained out front for about a year.  He sees me standing at the door, and as I exit my house and begin walking in his direction he suddenly slams on the horn.  I wave frantically to get him to stop, but he continues until I reach the door.  \n\nI hear the lock click and get in.  I say hello and hang onto his stare for just a moment.  He remains silent and looks me up and down as I'm pulling the seatbelt across my lap.  I sit back, exhale, and notice he's staring somewhat \"intently\" (creepily) into my eyes.  I think he was trying to be \"sexy\", but he lacked the swag to attempt this \"ladies' man\" stunt.  Feeling a little uneasy that we were still sitting in front of my house, I break the ice with \"you ready?\", politely smiling.  \"Nice shoes.  They look expensive\", he says, despite my shoes being shrouded in darkness underneath the glove compartment.\n\nSo we're driving along, and I immediately begin to sense his lack of confidence, which I kind of felt bad about.  I understand the pressure on guys when they take a new girl out.  He's asking me what kind of music I like, feverishly clicking through stations anticipating my response.  I decide to test him.  I want to see if he has the  backbone to stop at a station HE prefers rather than pandering to my preference, so I casually throw out \"country\".  Disappointingly, he starts desperately turning the dial until he gets to the country station, and then quite literally BLASTS it when he reaches the station. \n\nAt this point I know that unless he's some sort of magician, there's nothing he could do to save himself from the flaming dumpster fire that this date has turned into, so I just mechanically begin going through the motions.  The drive was an exercise in futility.  There's no icebreaker or even awkward conversation.  At this point I'm mostly convinced that he's just inexperienced and timid rather than weird.  He's driving erratically and glancing over at me nervously over and over.  I'm afraid he's going to run a red light and we're both going to die.\n\nWe get to the restaurant finally - Selam Ethiopian Kitchen.  I shit you not.  If you're ever in the Chicago metro area, look it up.  Guess he really took to heart the whole \"spicy food\" thing.  \"Ethiopian?\", I ask.  \"Is it good???\".  \"Awe, yeah.  I love it\".  \"Okay\".  My bullshit barometer is through the roof, but I set aside a sliver of hope that maybe he knows what he's doing.  We sit on some pillows on a floor.  I'm wearing a bit of a skimpy dress, so I'm instantly uncomfortable.  He leans back and begins flexing his chest through his button down cloth shirt, unbuttoning the top button and commenting \"it's getting hot in here\" while suggestively shooting me the most gracelessly cumbersome bedroom eyes I've ever received.\n\n\"I was right...\", he begins in a weirdly \"whispery\" voice, followed by the uselessly redundant comment \"...your shoes do look expensive\".  I actually giggled and covered my mouth, giving a knee - jerk apology for basically laughing in his face.  The waiter comes over and hands us menus, asking us what we'd like to drink.  There's a short pause, I presumed to be chivalrous, allowing me to order first, but as soon as I begin speaking Kevin holds up his hand, and says \"eh...the lady will have a water with lemon, and a glass of Chateau St. Pierre\".  I interrupt with \"actually can I just have a Diet Coke?\".  Kevin then interrupts me once more, looks at the waiter, and comments \"I insist\".  The waiter gives me an awkward glance which I reciprocate, and looks back and Kevin, and politely asks \"so...what am I bringing?\".  Kevin's overconfident masquerade instantly melts away and he says \"Diet Coke\".\n\nAt this point I just want out.  I'm not a difficult girl to take on a date.  I've had many dates where a guy doesn't display the utmost degree of confidence, and understanding the pressure they're under, have granted them a break, and many times, even a second date.  But this was an utter trainwreck.  I start to generate surface - level small talk in hopes that he might start asking me questions, actually wanting to get to know me a little, but instead he starts going on and on about his \"kids\" (students), calling them \"bastards\", callously referring to one as a \"shit head\" (yes, he used that term on a date), and even brags about other female teachers who, to quote him, \"would kill to be in (my) position right now\".  At this point I'm trying achingly hard to hold back laughter.\n\nThe food eventually comes and we begin eating.  He orders a plethora of appetizers, which he voraciously begins inhaling, very impolitely.  I'm convinced he's asking me useless questions like \"where did you grow up?\" and \"what is your job history?\" (is this a fucking job interview?) just so he could shove food into his mouth.  He's dumping copious amounts of hot sauce on his food while reminding me that he \"loves spicy food\", though before the main course comes, I notice that he's dripping with sweat.  I ask him if he's okay.  He's chugging water like Aron Ralston after five days in the canyon and repeatedly calling the waiter over for piles of napkins to dry off with.  His arm pit sweat is branching out toward his ribs. And then I get an ill feeling when his stomach starts grumbling and he's sitting forward straining his neck so hard his carotid artery looks like it's going to burst and start showering me in his blood.\n\nBy now I'm in such disbelief that I feel like I'm watching a movie.  \"Are you sure you can eat more of this stuff?\", I ask him, genuinely getting concerned.  \"Oh...\", he begins before holding his fist to his mouth and burping.  \"I always react this way to Ethiopian, but I love it\".  I begin to recoil, thinking he's going to projectile vomit rice over my shoulder while pleading silently with God that the date end as soon as possible.  Because I knew nothing about African food, I had absolutely no clue what he'd ordered.  So the waiter shows up with this tray of half a dozen plates.  He sits two in front of me.  I ordered some chicken dish with vegetables.  And then he removes several of Kevin's appetizer dishes and sits down four plates piled to the fucking ceiling with meat and rice and whatever.\n\nI try to continue the conversation, but realizing he only likes to talk about himself, I ask him some mundane question about his dating history, to which he replies, in between more rapid burping, \"wouldn't YOU like to know...\".  I decide to abandon all polite decency at this point since he's made the decision to act like a complete dick wad, trying to play the \"mysterious\" card with the wherewithal of a thirteen year old, and I say \"okay.  Well I guess this date has hit a wall\".  I suppose I did him a favor ending the date before it had actually ended.  \"I'll be back\", he mutters, jumping to his feet and pretending to take a call (despite his phone not ringing), and he walks off to the men's room.  And he's gone...for fifteen minutes. \n\n I start to wonder if I can catch an Uber or maybe even leave with a random, possibly murderous stranger before he comes sauntering out with the phone still up to his face, the entire front of his shirt so sopping wet that whatever patches of dry spots left appear like a cluster of tiny islands on a world map.  The rest is the ocean.  He sits back down and starts unbuttoning to halfway down his shift.  I can see his soaked wife beater underneath.  I'm frantically texting friends at this point, begging to get picked up, and I actually score.  My friend Melody agrees to hurry down now. I want whatever traces of excretion that are on his fingers from whatever the hell went on in that bathroom to stay where they are, and seeing as he awkwardly placed his hand on the small of my back (and partially on my ass) when I entered, I assumed this to be a certainty.  \"Yeah, yeah...okay, I HAVE to go\", he nearly yells into the phone.  \n\n\"Ugh...\", he burps.  \"Fucking principal is on my ass.  Sorry I was gone so long\".  Treating the date now as a source of entertainment, I indulge him.  \"What was THAT all about????\", I question, sending a text to my friend to hurry.  Mind you, this was the very first time I'd touched my phone all night.  This asshole just got up and left me alone for almost twenty minutes, and he then has the balls to say \"I'm giving you five seconds to stop looking at your phone or you're paying for dinner\".  \"That's it...\", I say angrily, throwing my hands up.  \"I'm leaving.  Please don't follow me\".  \"Calm down\", he says.  And the last thing that came out of his mouth, spectacularly, was \"so...do you like Italian food?\".  I jump up, drop down a $10 for the tip (which I would have at least insisted on anyway), and graciously left him to stew in his own perspiration.\n\nAs I'm leaving, the waiter catches my eye, smiles somberly, and laughingly whispers \"I'm so sorry\".  I wished he'd have taken me out.  I waited in the freezing cold on a random street corner on Broadway in the city of Chicago for ten minutes until I finally get picked up.  I exhale, and let the anger and anxiety wash over me.  I text Jason, who set us up, and told him it was a disaster.  His response - \"haha... damn, I'm sorry.  I hoped for once he wouldn't be like that\".  \"For once\".  Jesus.  It didn't end there.  Kevin began sending a barrage of angry texts calling me a \"whore\", \"bitch\", and bizarrely, \"Indian - giver\" (I'm still trying to figure out what that even means).\n\nLater that night, Jason sends me a text.  Mind you, I've blocked Kevin.  I open the text and it's a screenshot.  Kevin went on his own Facebook wall and posted \"(my full name) gives shitty blowjobs\".  I immediately begin freaking out, when Jason sends me another, reading \"don't worry.  I told him he could lose his teaching license for it\", telling me Kevin had taken it down.  I searched this guy just to be sure, and it turns out he did, in fact, delete it.  Still, a piece of me died that night.  My hope in humanity is several degrees lower than it was before, and will remain that way forever until I hear that this guy has been struck by lightning and extinguished from the face of the earth.\n\nMaybe a year later, I brought Kevin up at a party where Jason was, discussing bad dates around a fire.  Jason, after my story, expelled one interesting little anecdote about Kevin which evidently took place after me.  He'd been set up on another date.  I have no idea who the girl was or how it occurred, but she ended up going home with him.  Apparently they pulled up in front of his house, and Kevin said \"hold on, I need to just clean up a little.  Gimme a second\".  He shut the car off and left the girl inside in the freezing cold for a half hour while he cleaned his filthy house.  She said that when she entered his house, it was \"absolutely disgusting\".  When I asked what happened next, Jason said \"I don't know, but after she got home, she called me crying\".\n\nNot even Kevin has ever disclosed the details of that night.  My guess is...well, now that I think about it, that's a guess I'd rather not take.\n\nThe End","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1640327564.0},{"title":"Kevin the backroom manager","author":"Kazbob48","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/riufdn\/kevin_the_backroom_manager\/","text":"I used to work for a major beverage company. Kevin was the backroom manager for a major grocery outlet. We delivered twice per week to Kevin's store.  \n\nThe loading bay for intake is supposed to open precisely at 6am. There is lots of competition in the mornings between drivers to get first dibs in dropping load off, then moving on to the next drop.\n\nMy job was to move product out to the floor and organize whatever is leftover into the backroom.\n\nKevin is constantly late for drop days. Sometimes so late that drivers exit their vehicles to chew out the store manager or give Kevin a piece of their mind when he does arrive.\n\nThis is the worst Kevin moment i ever saw though.  On this particular day Kevin is over an hour late. As usual, he makes no acknowledgement about his tardiness. \n\nMy driver is first up, and already backed into the bay  waiting for Kevin to open the receiving door. It is a holiday, so the truck is packed to the brim for a larger than usual load.\n\nWhen Kevin sees that it will take awhile to process the load, he decides it would be better to process one of the smaller bread vendors through the side door ramp first.  Of course, this only makes the situation worse as there are several other vehicles waiting in line for the bay my driver is parked in.\n\nMy driver doesn't give two shits what Kevin wants to do, and has me start helping him move the load into the backroom.\n\nKevin tells us to stop cuz it will clog up the floor while he is working with the ither vendor. My driver tells him that's his problem and continues unloading. \n\nNormally Kevin is supposed to scan product as it is being unloaded to confirm receipt, but that obviously is not happening. Normally the driver waits, but my driver has had enough and gives me the invoice, then departs for the next load.\n\nI can't start to move product until Kevin confirms receipt of items on the invoice. But now the beer guy has backed into the bay and he is also moving his drop onto the floor. Kevin also tells him to stop and he gets the same response as my driver.\n\nKevin finally decides he better attend to my delivery, and literally stops scanning the bread vendors items. Now the bread guy is pissed. There are now 3 vendors with product waiting to be unloaded.\n\nBay 2 is only used by the store's own trucks delivering their products. Some of this stuff needs to be scanned in, but a lot of it doesn't. This truck has now arrived, and employees are heading into the back room to throw freight.\n\nExcept all our crap is in the way because Kevin was late and decided he didn't want to process in the order of deliveries. Now the employees are mad at the vendors because the product is in the way, and of course the vendors are mad at Kevin.\n\nFinally the store manager arrives to assist scanning the product, and he really lets Kevin have it. Kevin informs the manager that he is overdue for his break, and leaves the backroom. I thought the manager was seriously contemplating murder.\n\nThe manager tells him he is gonna write Kevin up and Kevin just \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f and keeps walking.\n\nI worked that store for over 2 years. Kevin never got fired, nor did Kevin's behavior ever change much. \n\n\nTLDR Kevin doesn't care about his job or how his actions at work have a domino effect on anyone else.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1639785815.0},{"title":"The Kevin I Work With","author":"cwu007","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/ribff3\/the_kevin_i_work_with\/","text":"I\u2019m a Shift Manager for a retail drug store chain.

A story the semester in the making. \n\nOur first suspicion of Kevin was that he had, somehow, cheated his way up to this course. He just seemed perpetually confused, and strangely antagonistic of the professor. The weirdest example of this was when he asked what an ion was (in a third year class?), and was informed that it referred to any positively or negatively charged particle. It would have been strange enough to ask, but his reply of \"Either? That doesn't sound right\" sealed him in as a well known character in the class of 19 people. \n\nThe real tipping point in our perception of him during a lecture where the professor mentioned practical uses for a neutron beam, and Kevin asked if a beam could be made out of some other neutral material. When asked \"Like what?\", he replied \"An atom with all of its electrons removed.\" When we pointed out that the protons would make that abomination extremely positively charged, he just replied with \"So what if we removed those too?\" and then was baffled when we informed him that would just be neutrons. \n\nThat's high school level chemistry. Not knowing it was so incredibly strange that I felt like something was off, so I asked him if he'd like to grab lunch. He accepted, we chatted, and I finally began to get a sense of his origin story. \n\nSee, Kevin wasn't a junior\/senior electrical engineer like the rest of us. Kevin was, in fact, three notable things: A business major, a sophomore, and a hardcore Catholic. All three of those are essential to understanding his scenario. \n\nWhat had begun all of this was actually a conflict with Kevin and his roommate. Kevin frequently had his fundamental belief in Absolute Good, Absolute Bad, and Absolute Anything pushed back on by his roommate, who was in STEM. Said roommate kept invoking quantum mechanics as his proof against Absolute Knowledge. Kevin had gotten tired of having something that he didn't understand thrown at his beliefs, so he decided to take a quantum course to settle things once and for all. \n\nDespite not having any of the pre-reqs. \n\nHe'd actually tried to take quantum for physicists first, but the school's physics department wouldn't let him. It's actually pretty strictly regulated, because it is a mandatory class for physics majors. However, because quantum is not mandatory for electrical engineers, there aren't really any built in requirements for the class. It's just assumed that nobody would actually try to take it until their third year because doing so would the be the mental equivalent to slamming your nuts in the door. Just, pure suffering for no good reason. \n\nApparently, the counselors had tried to talk him out of it, but if Kevin was one thing, it was stubborn. He'd actually had to sign some papers basically saying \"I was warned that this is incredibly stupid, but I refused to listen\" in order to take the class. \n\nHe was actually pretty nice, if currently unaware of how bad he'd just fucked up. I paid for the lunch, wished him the best in the class, and reported back to the discord me and about eight other people in the class had been using. We'd all been curious about this guy's story, but now that I had the truth, I could share it with the world. \n\nFeelings were mixed. Some people thought he was going to drop out any minute now. Others thought that he wouldn't, be also that convincing him to drop now, while he still could, was the only ethical thing. Others figured that a policy of non-interference was best. The counselors couldn't dissuade him, and if we tried to do the same, he'd probably just think it was STEM elitism trying to guard its little clubhouse. He'd figure out how hard things were, or he'd fail. Either way, it would help him learn more about the world. \n\nWe wound up taking the approach of non-interference. If nothing else, understanding his origins gave us more patience when he asked bizarre questions. He wasn't trying to waste our time, he was just trying to cram three years of pre-reqs into a one semester course. He did get a little bit combative sometimes, and we could tell that he was really wracking his brain to try and find some sort of contradiction or error that he could use to bring the whole thing down, but he never could. \n\nFirst test came by, and he bombed it. Completely unprepared. He'd taken Calculus, but he didn't know how to do integrals yet. Worse, he was far past the drop date. I imagine most people in his shoes would've stopped struggling. They'd realize they were fucked and just let themselves fail, at least salvaging their other classes grades in the process. Why waste resources on an unwinnable battle?\n\nKevin's don't ask questions like that. If they're stupid enough to try it, they're stupid enough to finish it. God bless them. \n\nHe invited me to lunch after the test and said that the class was more fascinating than he'd ever imagined, but he didn't know if he'd be able to pass it. He asked if I could help, and I said maybe. I brought the request to the discord, and from the eight people I got three volunteers who admired this dork's tenacity. He was in over his head, miles over his head, but his fighting spirit was fucking glorious and we were willing to bust our asses to see if we could get this guy to pass the class. \n\nSome of the stuff was just extra homework we gave to the guy. We told him he needed to learn integrals, stat. We sent him some copies of basic software that can be used to teach the basics of linear circuit equations, and he practiced that game like it was HALO. Just, hours sunk into it. Absolutely godlike. \n\nHe was still scrabbling for air at just the surface level of the class, but he'd gone from abysmal failure to lingering on the boundary between life and death. Other people in the class started to learn about Kevin's origin story, and our little circle of four volunteer tutors grew to six. Every day, he had someone trying to help him either catch up in some way, or finish that week's homework. He'd gone from being seen as a nuisance that wasted class time to the underdog mascot. \n\nHe was getting twelve hours of personal tutoring a week, on top of three hours of classes, on top of six hours of office hours, on top of the coursework. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that this kid was doing 40 hours a week just trying to pass this one single class. \n\nSecond test comes around and he gets a 60. He's ecstatic. We're ecstatic. Kid's too young to take out drinking so we just order a pizza and cheer like he just won gold at the Olympics. \n\nAfter that second test, things hit another tipping point. With so much catch-up under his belt, he was able to focus a lot more on the actual material for the class. A borderline cinematic moment happened when I was trying to get ahead on the homework so that I could put more hours in on my senior project. Nobody else had finished it yet because it wasn't due for another week, nobody else knew how to do it, and when I went to the professor's office hours, Kevin was there. The professor was trying to help me, but I was still struggling. After leaving the office, I got a text from Kevin asking me to hop onto zoom. \n\nKevin had finished it earlier, because Kevin starts all of his homework the moment its assigned in order to make sure that he can get it done. He'd finished it the day before, and was able to walk me through it. \n\nFrom student, to teacher. I'm not exaggerating when I say that he probably saved me eight hours on that assignment. Glorious fucking moment. \n\nFinal comes around. As soon as we're done, we six ask Kevin how he did. He's nervous, there's so much new material for him in this class that his retention hasn't been great. Us six are also a little stressed: We're going to pass the class, but the final was *hard.*\n\nWe wait. \n\nWe wait. \n\nWe wait. \n\nTable with final scores, and overall scores is posted, curve included. From our class of 19 people, 4 withdrew within the deadline, 4 failed, 1 got a C, 8 got B's, and 2 got A's. We can see that the curve for a C is set at 59.2% overall. \n\nWe call Kevin. He's crying. End score, 59.2%. Teacher curved the C just to him. \n\nIt's a week into winter break so we can't gather the forces around for a party like last time, but we're all losing our shit. Kevin's losing his shit. He can't believe how stupid he was to try this course, he can't believe that six people busted their ass just to make sure he didn't die, and he can't believe that the professor basically just passed him out of effort alone. \n\nHe says it's the stupidest thing he's ever done, and while I doubt that, it *was* outrageously stupid. And yet, I've never been so invested in a fellow student before. I'm prouder of Kevin's C than I am of my own B. I've been walking on sunshine since I got the news. \n\nGod bless you Kevin, you fucking idiot. Don't take the class the next time the counselors say not to. Now go out there and kick some ass. You've got a lot of people cheering for you.\n\nTL;DR, Kevin takes a Quantum Class with no pre-reqs in order to try and own his roommate in a religious debate they keep having. The curriculum eats him alive but people are impressed with his struggle and take him under their wing. He winds up basically as the class mascot, people bust their ass trying to help him pass the class, and in the end the teacher winds up curving the class juuuuust enough to get this kid a C.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1639444062.0},{"title":"Went to high school with a female Kevin.

Here is the [original post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/r2yev4\/my_first_ever_roommate_kevina\/) for those interested.\n\nTo fully understand this story I must properly introduce you all to Kevina's boyfriend, Stoner McGee. Kevina and Stoner McGee met during the first month or so of our sophomore year of college. They started dating and soon enough Stoner McGee became a permanent fixture in our apartment. Stoner McGee dealt weed and was somewhat of a Kevin himself. An illustration of his specific brand of Kevin-ness is how he conducted his \"business\". At some point in his weed dealing career, someone must have explained the concept of laundering money to him. However, I don't think he really understood that the point of laundering the money was to put some distance between your money and the drugs it came from. The reason I say this is rather than having a fake side hustle or investing in something non-conspicuous, he chose to flip what he called glassware, what the DEA would call marijuana paraphernalia, and what most people would call bongs. A side note: I have never seen such ridiculous bongs as the ones Stoner McGee purchased. There was one that was as tall as a 3-year-old child, there was one that looked like Alien but with giant tits, there was one where you smoked out of a wrinkly, bald old man head puking up a rainbow, there was one that was shaped like Oscar the Grouch holding a bottle of malt liquor, the list could go on. Anyways, the reason why Stoner McGee had enough money to buy (and then re-sell) all of these was that he was not only selling weed to other university students but was also shipping pounds of weed to people in different states. As you may have predicted, something goes awry in this scheme and that is where our story begins.\n\nKevina comes home in a frazzled whirlwind one evening. She gets out a giant suitcase from her closet and begins hastily stuffing it full of clothes. As she is dragging her suitcase from her room into the hallway, I stop her and ask her what's going on. She explains that Stoner McGee had shipped weed to someone in another state, but the person never paid. When he contacted the person about it they told him that the police had confiscated it. Kevina and Stoner McGee, who do not question or in any way try to confirm this story, decide that their only option is to flee to.... Canada. After a long and exhausting conversation trying to explain why, on so many levels, it was not a good idea to flee to Canada, Kevina was still dead set on going. No matter how hard I tried, I could not convince her that there was less than a 1% chance that the story Stoner McGee was fed was true and that they were not on America's Most Wanted list. Even if it was somehow true, she did not seem to see a problem in the fact that she and Stoner McGee have only been together 3 months (she \"really didn't see them breaking up any time soon\" so that was a non-issue in her mind), that if she went through with it she would never be able to see her family again, and that Canada, unlike Mexico, will extradite you if the US government asks. So, with her bag packed she runs down the stairs to meet Stoner McGee to begin their new life North of the Border.\n\nKevina and Stoner McGee never get to Canada. At some point in their journey, Stoner McGee's parents get in touch with him and he spills the beans on the whole situation. His parents decide to hire a lawyer whose $400 an hour advice basically amounted to: \"Sorry, kid. You got ripped off\".","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1639111165.0},{"title":"At the sandwich shop","author":"Internal_Use8954","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/rcbdun\/at_the_sandwich_shop\/","text":"I ran into a Kevina in the wild. \n\nI was at a firehouse subs grabbing dinner.

Every single inhabitant here knows about that.\n\nWell, then comes the day, we had a botanics practice, which were used for students to bring samples for identification. At the start of the day we were, ya know, doing the deals, you got too many of one plant and swap it for one you don't have. Then comes Kevin, saying he had an ultra rare plant he had never seen and he would swap it for 5 other samples. As he opens up his folder all of us fall silent and turn an ivory shade of pale, there it was, a full Teide violet. We tried to convince Kevin not to bring it to class and dispose of it quietly, he did not listen, said we were jealous cause his plant would be worth an A+ by itself.\n\nThen comes the botanics period. Teacher starts doing the rounds on our tables untill she sees it. The shriek she let out still rings in my ears 6 years later. She started lashing violently at Kevin saying she sould be calling the police and he was an idiot. Of course he failed not just that assignment but the whole subject and was forced to retake it the following year\n\nFor anyone who still doesn't get how grave this was, imagine going to china and shooting a panda bear in the face then posting the pic on instagram with a smile.

There are many mysteries about Kevin, and most of them we have not solved.\u00a0\n\nKevin has made [several unsuccessful attempts\u00a0to kill us](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/qo50ig\/kevin_the_scientist_trying_to_kill_us\/), and this is a story of how he tried to make all of our jobs obsolete.\n\nPerhaps I should preface the story by saying that Kevin does very little work. He might go into the lab once that week if the moon is aligned with Venus and Mars is in retrograde. Otherwise, he sits at his desk all day, but doesn't respond to emails or requests for scientific inputs.\n\nWhat we did eventually learn was that the reason why Kevin contributed little to discussions was because it took him forever to figure out a response. I suppose by the time he had a response, we would have wrapped up the discussion DAYS prior.\n\nOnce in a while, Kevin would still grace us with his belated responses, and this was one of such inopportune times... (Sorry for the long preamble).\n\nWe had a very urgent call from our manager to design a study. The email said to respond by the end of the following day. By the deadline, our team (sans Kevin) had hammer out the scope of the study and specific details that we needed to know.\n\nThis was an extremely high priority project, so the team got to work ASAP and started performing the tests.\n\nTWO WEEKS LATER, Kevin sends out a long email detailing why each of the study objective that we have laid out is pointless, and that we had better off contracting the entire study to a contract research organization.\u00a0\n\nAt this point, the team is already in full swing, with everyone is devoting full time to the project. So convincing the higher-ups to contract out the whole project would make our jobs obsolete.\u00a0\n\n(As well, you couldn't actually contract this work out at the time. There was no commercial service available that was validated for what we wanted to do.)\n\nThe best part is that Kevin had emailed the ENTIRE company, including everyone on the board of directors, the c-suite, all the consultants. Unsurprisingly this sounded alarms with the higher-ups, who started to question the value of the whole department when they could just \"easily\" contract the work out instead.\n\nFortunately, our manager put an end to the madness and restored faith in us handling the project, and we all still had jobs. Phew!\n\nNewest update: most people in the department had recently left due to problems with senior management (r\/antiwork stories), leaving Kevin as the sole remaining scientist!

Here are some of the highlights from our friendship.\n\n- Kevin spray-painted his entire truck neon green because he didn\u2019t want to pay a professional to detail it. He did not do a good job. There was spray paint covering his headlights and all over the wheels.\n\n- Kevin once gleefully told me that he had found a loophole to \u201cbeat the system.\u201d I was intrigued. He said that when he drag races, he puts a different license plate number over his license plate so that cops won\u2019t know who he is.

When asked why, he said \u201cher thing had... hair on it. Is that normal? Do you think she might have a disease?\u201d Kevin was 17 years old when he learned that women do, in fact, have pubic hair.\n\n- For this next story, I would have loved to be a fly on the wall. When we were in high school, we had a school-wide assembly to address the consequences of sexting\/sharing nudes. There was one assembly for freshmen and sophomores, and one for juniors and seniors. Kevin was two grades below me, so unfortunately, I had to hear this story second-hand. One of the main topics of the assembly was the legality of nude photos. The police officer doing the presentation warned that sending and receiving nudes of yourself\/others while underage is illegal (obviously). At the end of the assembly, there was a Q&A section. Kevin stood up and asked, in front of his entire grade and the grade below him, \u201cOfficer ___, what if I took a picture of a girl\u2019s camel toe? Is that illegal? I don\u2019t want to get in trouble.\u201d I wish I could have been there to witness this moment of legendary Kevin-ness, but alas, I had to hear the story from one of my friends who was in his grade.\n\n- I once had the misfortune of being a backseat passenger in Kevin\u2019s car. He had containers of gasoline sloshing around in the backseat. The lid was loose and it nearly spilled on me. Keep in mind, Kevin was a heavy smoker.

And welcome to my strangest case of shit-talk I ever had to post. Bare with me!\n\nSo to set the stage, I'm in a type of fraternity (and no it's not my full personality I also enjoy anime, cooking, etc.) that is linked to a tight-knit community with other fraternities and sororities. Practically everyone knows someone and there's always a chain of friendship that leads to another person on the other side of this really small world. There is also this event called a formals. It's a formal dinner and ceremony in which potential members are congratulated for finishing whatever pledge process they had, are bestowed with full active privileges, receive many gifts, and followed by an afterparty. Today we will be talking about pledge Kevin and his various antics.\n\nKevin is a pledging for fraternity 2, along with my little brother's friend A. My little brother and A has warned me about Kevin's behavior and how he has been on his own active bros' nerves for a very long time. I had to see it to believe it, for I believe in always giving people a chance, and that's why first impressions exist.\n\nThe first time I met Kevin was at my girlfriend's sorority's fundraiser. We made small talk and traded vapes. As I smoked out of his, he let me know not to \"hit it too long\". I'm taken aback a bit because I'd hate to be a freeloader, so I hand it back and apologize. Not a minute later, I witness him ripping a blinker on my friend V's weed pen (when you smoke it in one hit so long, that the device begins blinking). Now I understand noone is ever entitled to each other's property, but what I couldn't wrap my head around was the instant hypocrisy I just saw. That night, my girlfriend, V, and I went home with a mild topic but we wrote that down as a one-off thing and just thought we were never going to see him again.\n\nBoy were we wrong. 2 weeks later, my girlfriend has her formals in which she brings me as her date and two of her sorority sisters bring V and Kevin, respectively. Suffice to say, Kevin was not only an hour LATE but also got so drunk he ended up on a couch in the lobby of the venue by the time dinner service starts. Now I know greek life gets a bad rep for being on their worst behavior, and after witnessing this, I can confidently say Kevin was a participant and perpetrator of this stereotype.\n\nFlash forward to the afterparty, everyone's having fun drinking and participating in all sorts of extracurriculars (that was an innuendo).  It is notable that this party was at an Airbnb, closed-invite to Greek affiliated members and non-affiliated DATES ONLY. Me and my girlfriend have a room reserved for us, which we share with my bros, her sisters, and VERY CLOSE MUTUALS to enjoy more private conversations and a certain particularly white, flaky extracurricular. Kevin immediately barges in like he's the man of the room and begins to ABSOLUTELY LEECH back to back servings from my bros. I mean it's a party and if you come correct, you may just be blessed with our generosity but damn we just met him. He-who-knows-no-boundaries-or-manners was jumping from person to person every 5 minutes practically begging until someone finally cut him off. When my girl went to the restroom and returned, he basically tried to gatekeep her from entering a room full of people closer to her than him.\n\nBut that was just the beginning. Other instances included him not tending to his date whatsoever. At a formals, those who are being congratulated drink the most and it is basically a man's duty, NOT JUST IN FRATERNITIES, to take care of his date. However, while he was running off trying to find the next person to fiend drugs from, his date was being monitored by Kevin's own pledge brother and my girlfriend. Kevin also invited a completely random person, despite being told very clearly that this was a closed-invite party. I couldn't help but feel sympathy for the unexpected guest in question while my girl ripped Kevin a new one in front of the entire room, for even he had better manners in a house where he didn't belong. We let him stay.\n\nBonus: I'm the type of guy at the party going around encouraging others to drink. Disclaimer, when it comes down to it, I'll back off if I have to especially if I find out my target is driving. My favorite card to use is \"Oh you're representing (insert organization's acronym here)? Better drink to it then\". In the case of Kevin and his pledge bros, they must say that they are a pledge of \"The Great \\*full organization's name here\\*\". So I went up to Kevin (again, just being friendly and hoping to give him one more chance at comradery) and in a joking tone, inserted the entire phrase into my peer-pressuring bit when his pledge bro pulls me aside. I think to myself \"Great. I probably just offended someone.\" but to my surprise, the guy that pulled me aside asked me not to drink with Kevin specifically for the reason that Kevin gets belligerently aggressive and touchy when under the influence. So I back off, reflecting on how that is the most embarrassing reason I ever had to hear from his OWN bros not to encourage someone not to drink.\n\nDon't be like Kevin everyone. Whether you are part of a community with a shaky reputation or simply going out to have some fun, HOLD YOURSELVES AND YOUR FRIENDS ACCOUNTABLE! If you gotta ask yourself if you're being too comfortable with another person's stuff, you probably are. If you gotta ask yourself how your date is doing, go fucking check up on her. Read the goddamn room. Thank you for listening and have a nice day :)","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1638469844.0},{"title":"My Older Brother Is A Kevin and BOY, Do I Have Some Stories For You!

It was a fun, family trip for both me and my teenage niece, because we practically share a birthday and we both *love* camping and outdoor activities. While we were staying at his house, it happened to be my birthday, and so my niece, who isn't the most experienced of bakers, decided to make me a birthday cake. It was really sweet of her, but the cake didn't exactly come out all that well.... Well, to be precise, while it *did* come out of the tin, it turned out to be a pineapple *inside out* cake. So she left it on the counter while she tried to figure out how to save it and, this is the most important part, ***told everyone in the house, except for me, not to eat the cake bits on the counter in the kitchen.*** This included Kevin. Multiple times. I was not told, because she wanted it to be a surprise.\n\nBut did Kevin listen? Of course not! His sins were discovered when she went back into the kitchen, armed with the knowledge she so desperately sought and ready to fix her mistake, only to find a nearly empty plate on the counter and Kevin, sitting at the table, with a chunk of cake in his hand. Turns out, not only had *he* eaten most of the cake, but he had been passing it out to the *kids.* I got none of it. Not a bite, not even a morsel of my own birthday cake.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStory #2: Kevin likes to rag on people he thinks are \"too fat\", especially girls, and tell them how to \"get healthy\" (according to him). Now, one of my older sisters (we'll call her Mina) has a hormonal disorder called PCOS (PolyCystic Ovary Syndrome), which basically means that she has more male hormones in her body than she should and her ovaries will occasionally develop cysts. As a side-effect of her condition, she has a tendency to gain weight and be unable to lose it. \n\nOne 4th of July, Kevin starts in on Mina about how she needs to lose weight and how eating only boiled chicken breast, plain rice and broccoli or weed\/mushrooms will cure everything from being overweight to depression and allergies. So, Mina tells him \"No, you don't understand, I have a *medical condition.* I literally *can't* lose weight that easily!\" to which Kevin responds; \"Yeah, 'medical condition', I have the same thing, and you were probably diagnosed by a *woman* doctor.\" Said in the most condescending and passive-aggressive tone you can think of and topped off with a smug sh\\*t-eating grin. Mina stared at him, mouth agape, for a solid 20 seconds before laughing so hard she almost slid   \nunderneath the picnic table. It was at this moment, somewhere deep in that lizard brain of his, that Kevin realized; *he f\\*\\*ked up.* \n\nHe demanded to know what was so funny, and from in between great shocks of rolling laughter, came my sister's response: \"So tell me, Kevin, how many cysts have *YOUR* ovaries had lately?!?!\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nStory #3: This Thanksgiving, I brought my boyfriend of 2 years to a sister's house to celebrate with us and finally meet most of my siblings. Kevin was also there. He said nothing about coming over, just kinda showed up on his motorcycle. Now my boyfriend (who I'll call \"Jordan\") was actually really excited about this. Why? Because I told him stories and he was excited to see this man in-action. \n\nSome time passes and Jordan starts getting grilled by my family. One thing you should know about Jordan, is that he is very quiet and super awkward around people he doesn't know. He's a very introspective and observant introvert (INTJ, for all you 16 personality weirdos), who was suddenly thrown into a sea of loud Irishmen and Italians. So, needless to say, he was feeling a bit overwhelmed and got really quiet. Then he got to talk to Kevin.\n\nKevin had determined that Jordan was *autistic*. How, you might ask? Because Jordan was being quiet in a house full of strangers. The two of them start talking about something or other and pretty soon Kevin drops this little nugget of special: (to Jordan) \"You know, you're pretty okay, although it's pretty clear, you're autistic as f\\*\\*k.\" \n\nJordan and I stared at each other for a little bit, trying with all our combined might to keep a straight face. We let him ramble on for a minute, before I gave him a polite smile and told him that no, Jordan is in *no way* autistic, with Jordan himself backing me up. Kevin didn't listen. In fact, he spent the next *THREE DAYS* telling me that I was wrong and trying to prove it to me.\n\nI'll end this here, as it's getting a bit long, but let me know if you want to hear more of my Kevin stories!

Kevin doubles down and says he can do a 4 wheel burnout. Kevin then on dry pavement and a Jeep with 100K+ miles puts it in 4wheel drive. Redlines it and drops the clutch.

During the worst of the pandemic, work had installed a second help desk for social distancing. This was Kevina\u2019s desk during her shift. When lockdown eased, the desk was no longer needed and we went back to using the central desk that is basically the focal point of the building. *Many* emails were sent about this.\n\nKevina arrives for her first shift, post-change, and finds the desk is missing. So, she takes a chair\u2026and places it where the desk *used* to be\u2026and sits down. We all side-eye her to see how long this will go on for, until a new coworker arrives and was able to genuinely ask, \u2018Kevina, *why* are you sat at on a chair in the middle of the room?\u2019 Kevina explains she\u2019s supposed to be on the desk, but she can\u2019t find it. Coworker points, with gentle pity, at the desk about 10ft away and suggests that she ask someone if she gets lost again at work.\n\nMy cat sometimes tries to sit where objects or furniture used to be. I hypothesize Kevina is actually a cat living in a human body? She was also notorious for being entirely incapable of self-directed work - if not explicitly told to complete a task, she would go to distant corners of the office and nap ~~in a patch of sunlight~~","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1638025326.0},{"title":"My first ever roommate, Kevina","author":"sun-showers","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/r2yev4\/my_first_ever_roommate_kevina\/","text":"This story takes place a few years back during my sophomore year of college when I lived in my first ever apartment with my first ever roommates. Being 19 and having never truly lived on our own before, many rookie mistakes were made that year when it came to being an adult. However, the level and severity of the mistakes made by my roommate Kevina were mind-boggling even by those standards.\n\nMy favorite story of Kevina, and the one that I think so perfectly encapsulates her Kevina-ness, happened during the first few weeks we lived together. I was making myself some lunch when Kevina came into the kitchen just to talk. We chitchat for a while before Kevina stops and stares at the food I'm making. She looks at me with a big smile and says \"Oh my god!! That is *such* a good idea!\". Not knowing what she's referring to, I give her a look and ask her what she means. \"You know, putting lettuce, tomato, and avocado in a bowl together!\". Kevina did not know what a salad was until that very moment.\n\nMy second favorite Kevina moment was when she decided to audition for The Voice. Kevina would sing constantly in our apartment. Please believe that this statement is not hyperbole: I have never heard a worse singer than Kevina. She had no sense of pitch, rhythm, range, or, apparently, the concept of auto-tune. She would choose to sing songs that were autotuned into oblivion and would consistently try to replicate sounds that clearly were generated by a computer. Despite all of this, Kevina thought she was a great singer and decided to seek her fame and fortune by auditioning for the TV show The Voice. So, she and her boyfriend Stoner McGee packed up their belongings and drove the 14+ hours to LA. After making the full 14+ hour drive Kevina arrives at the studio only to find out that the auditions had been held several weeks prior. She had heard that they were holding auditions \"soon\", but did not think to check the actual dates before driving to LA.\n\nThat's all for now on my first ever roommate, Kevina. If people are interested I can make another post as I have plenty of Kevina stories up my sleeve.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1637965584.0},{"title":"Kevina wants to be a mermaid","author":"You_MayBeRight","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/r2rxsc\/kevina_wants_to_be_a_mermaid\/","text":"I went to college with this Kevina and bear with me because I'm going to start off explaining how smart she is then get to the good stuff. \n\nKevina is very 'book smart' she graduated double major with honors and a 4.0 GPA. We both studied Marine Biology so we had many classes together. \n\nIn one of our classes early on my good friend was the TA. She exclaimed how easy her job was that semester due to Kevina.  I asked what she meant and apparently Kevina came to EVERY tutor session and would answer all her peers questions and teach them while my friend just unlocked the door and sat in the back all while getting paid. \n\nShe also would re-write every worksheet\/assignment we got to add more details and organization before turning it in.\n Example: Lable this diagram of a cell with the names of organelles.\n She would find a better diagram (or draw it herself) and label that with extra parts not on the original and answer her own added questions that weren't on the sheet.\n\n I heard her planning with her fiance to open tutoring Saturday morning session (without the TA because heck no) and then she sighed and said. \"We have a hard enough time getting people to come to the Friday night session, everyone here has their priorities backwards!\" \n\nAll quirky yes but Kevin no, so here's what you've been waiting for. \n\nOur first week at campus she posted a photo of her kissing one of the toads that were all over campus. She had some cute caption about looking for her prince. She was out sick  for about a week after and kept warning people against kissing the toads because they'll make you sick. Although she did find a guy shortly after. They got engaged after about a month of knowing each other. \n\nHer fiance was a Biology major so he was somewhat intertwined in our course work. We all took Genetics together and had to do a presentation on a genetic disorder. He chose female pattern baldness and went on for 15 minutes about how women are just as prone to baldness but are too weak to handle it unlike men. I'm surprised the teacher didn't stop him as his conclusion was pretty much that women were lesser than men and inferior in every way. She kissed him when he finished and sat next to her. \n\nHe was from the Philippines and was on a study visa. His entire family was still living in the Philippines. So I asked her how they planned on doing holidays. I suggested Thanksgiving in the states with her family since it's an American holiday and Christmas there with his. She looked utterly confused then disgusted and asked. \"Why on earth would I ever go to the Philippines??\"\n\nShe was blonde and claimed that she didn't need to shave her legs because you can't see it on blondes. (Personal choice I don't really care) However she had the thickest leg hair I've ever seen it was VERY noticeable. Other students made fun of her for it while she continued to claim no one could see it because it was blonde. It serious looked like a layer of wool. \n\nShe would always try to talk to me as we left class and sometimes when I was in the cafeteria. I once set a timer when she started talking with the intention of stopping it when I said something in return. It went for 15 minutes before I had to leave for another class having never said a single word in return as she just talked at me. I wasn't hostile or ignoring her she just talked over anything I tried to say and I got sick of it and stopped trying to reply. \n\nI said she was a Marine Bio major. Our school had a program with a traditional Hawaiian canoe. Every 2 years students would get picked to be the crew and they would take it out to sea. In order to be the crew you had to take a certain classes in sailing and Hawaiian culture which she had done. You also had to be able to tread water for 30 minutes. Kevina came to me (the head lifeguard at the pool) very concerned and asked me to teach her how to swim so she could apply to be crew. I agreed but she could never make time for it amidst her academics. \n\nFinally one day I asked her why she chose Marine Biology as her major. She got giddy and pulled out her phone. She showed me beautiful pictures of professional mermaids (yes a real profession). Some were at kids parties or amusement parks while others were swimming with whales or turtles for companies to take pictures. (Really cool photos) I actually had heard of one of these women who swims with humpback whales she is a freediver who can hold her breath for 5 minutes and no surprise an excellent swimmer. She wears a very long and heavy prosthetic tail and takes really amazing photos. \n\nWell that's what Kevina plans to do with her degree. I asked her about the swimming and she said that her credentials will be so impressive they'll have to overlook her not being able to swim. (Just like the canoe application didnt) Kevina went on to explain that swimming with a tail was easier than swimming without one and how they are basically big flotation devices. \n\nKevina is working harder than anyone I know to double major in Hawaiian studies and Marine Biology to do a job that requires no degree, only a skill set that she doesn't have and doesn't have time to work toward because of school. \n\nI'm sure there's more I'm forgetting at the moment but you understand the strangeness of this girl and how smart and hardworking she is but also how clueless. \n\nTL:DR Kevina cannot swim so she studies Marine Biology to fulfill her dream of being a professional mermaid through her credentials that no one could turn down.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1637946508.0},{"title":"Kevin called Kevin does the right thing to do","author":"BaarfTheCheekun","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/r3zr0y\/kevin_called_kevin_does_the_right_thing_to_do\/","text":"Okay.

He was not a dumb kid by any means- He was just lazy, and came to creative measures to expose this laziness. One time - This kid had his computer taken off him (He was playing games in class) and so this kid straight up jumped to his feet snd took the computer (Like it was nothing). While he wasn\u2019t *too* dumb in the academic level - he did\/said some of the most fundamentally retarded things on the planet. One time at a Water Park, when a friend of his was thirsty- He un ironically said \u201cBro derth water over dere everywhere why not just drink it dumb fuck\u201d. Another time - when his glasses were dirty - He ranted on about how he could \u201cThee Atomth bro\u201d. \n\nAnyway - This is off topic. The real kicker was in \u201cLiteracy Support\u201d.

But for those that haven\u2019t read them, I work as a kennel tech in a pet store that primarily sells dogs, which means I take care of the dogs every need including feeding, bathing, weighing and temping them, making sure they are healthy, cleaning their kennels and taking care of any sick dogs. Basically there is no way to avoid interacting or staying away from the dogs and at the worst of times there can be up to 100 dogs in the kennel at a time, but apparently Kevina never got that memo cause she applied and was hired as a kennel tech, I can\u2019t say if she was a true Kevina or if this was just a massive lapse in judgment but I think this fits this sub. \n\nKevina: is the new employee\nMe: me\nSL: is shift lead\nKT: is the only other kennel tech working that day\n\nSo we\u2019ve been having a serious problem at the store where we are hemorrhaging employees, to the point we have more kennel techs in training than we do experienced kennel techs who have been working for more then a month so we\u2019re basically hiring anyone that applies at this point which as this story shows isn\u2019t a good thing. The day started off normally with me coming to the store and seeing a new employee who we will call Kevin who I\u2019ve never met before, waiting at the front door and she\u2019s wearing the kennel tech uniform which is a good sign since most of the new employees haven\u2019t gotten theirs yet so it shows some initiative, she was very quiet and didn\u2019t seem very social while we wait for SL to open the door and let us and KT in. Everything is normal for the next 3 hours as we finish opening procedures, that is until right before the store opens and my SL steps out to get a bite to eat and a moment later Kevina approaches me.\n\nKevina: where did SL go?\n\nMe: she just stepped out for a second she should be back soon, why is something wrong?\n\nKevina: yeah I\u2019m not feeling too good\n\nMe: are you okay?\n\nKevina: no my dog allergies are acting up\n\nIt takes me a moment to comprehend what she just said and just stare at her blankly\n\nMe: you\u2019re allergic to dogs, why would you apply here if your allergic to dogs?\n\nKevina: well I like working with animals and I didn\u2019t think it would be that bad\n\nDumbfounded I decide I really didn\u2019t know how to deal with this situation I went to go find SL who was eating in another part of the store with the inventory manager \n\nMe: uhm SL we have a situation Kevina isn\u2019t feeling too well\n\nSL: what\u2019s wrong is she sick?\n\nMe: no her dog allergies are acting up\u2026\n\nSL and the inventory manager look at me with the same dumbfounded expression\n\nSL:\u2026 why did she even apply her if she has dog allergies?\n\nMe: she told me she didn\u2019t think it would be that bad\n\nSo SL decided to talk to Kevina and figure out what she wanted to do from here, as it turns out Kevina had no way home due to her bf having her car and not having Lyft or Uber to get home. SL offered to buy some ointment for her from the supermarket next door but Kevina declined and left the store, we didn\u2019t hear from her after that so I\u2019m guessing she called someone for a ride.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why or how she got the job since one of the interview questions was if you have any allergies to animals but I don\u2019t think we will be seeing her again.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1637802455.0},{"title":"More about my Co-worker Kevin","author":"AmethystWitch1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/r15l9h\/more_about_my_coworker_kevin\/","text":"Our company works alongside a similar company. We work upstairs and they work downstairs.\n\nMy coworker will often go down there and bug the other company all the time.\n\nHe complains that it is too bright up where we work so that's why he goes downstairs to \"Take a break.\" (NOTE: The downstairs lobby has MORE lights and its a completely white room so the lights feel brighter down there.) \n\nThey are doing renovations on our floor and just recently painted a few of the walls white. I came in to relieve Kevin and as he was walking away he goes: \"Oh hey they painted these walls over here.\"   \nI was thinking: 'Kevin you have been here for 8 hours and you just now noticed the walls?'   \nWhat I actually said: \"Yeah I think they want to change the color to fit the lobby better.\"\n\nWe used to have camera's that showed us the parking lot. We ended up getting moved up a floor and they had to disconnect the cameras from our computer. After a few weeks of no cameras he commented: \"Why do we still have no cameras. All they have to do is plug them back into the computer.\"   \nIn my head I think: 'No Kevin the have to completely reroute wires from the floor we were on to the floor we are on now. It's not as easy as it sounds. Not to mention we are only at a temp desk till they finish the lobby. So if they were to connect us back up then they would have to disconnect us in a few weeks to reroute it to our new spot.'  \nI just shrugged at him. Reason I didn't say anything to him. He was told this. At least 4 times. By multiple people.\n\nWe once had a homeless man walking around the outside of the building. Kevin found out about this and went down to bother the other company. The other company had already called their boss about it and the boss said, \"It's not illegal to walk around outside while being homeless.\" The other company didn't do anything. Kevin complained at them and said they just HAD to do something. The other company told Kevin what their boss said and Kevin said: \"NO! You have to override what your boss said and call the cops.\" The other company just waved Kevin away and ignored him. (Needless to say Kevin got chewed out by our boss.)\n\nKevin has a habit of leaving half empty open liquid bottles on the desk after many talks about him cleaning up after himself and being told he can't have open bottles on the counter. He complained to me the other day.  \nKevin: Joe got mad at me the other day because I left some open bottles out on the desk. I don't see what the big deal is.  \nWhat I was thinking: 'You are leaving OPEN bottles that you placed your mouth all over on a PUBLIC desk while COVID is still a thing and you AREN'T yet fully vaxxed and you don't see a problem with it.'  \nWhat I said: \"Damn Kevin I'm sorry.  \nKevin: Yea it sucks. Joe's just being picky.  \nI internally rolled my eyes.\n\nOur boss happened to get COVID from her young son. She is fully vaxxed. She came into work one day not knowing she had COVID yet. Spent a little under 30 minutes in the office then went home for not feeling good. Kevin hadn't even seen her that day and barley saw her the week prior. (NOTE: None of us knew she had COVID till she came back 2 weeks later.) He decides to complain to me.  \nKevin: Do you think we all have COVID cause Boss has COVID?   \nMe: No Kevin I don't think we have COVID. I don't think she has COVID.  \nKevin: Boss is sick though so she probably has COVID. Should we go get tested?  \nMe: If that will make you feel better go for it. I won't go get tested till corporate tells us to.  \nHe ends up just leaving after that mumbling to himself. \n\nKevin once asked me a question. (Don't remember what it was.)

I told Kevin about this once in passing.   \nKevin: You have to use that time up man. I'll beat you up if you don't use it.   \nMe laughing uncomfortably: Yeah I will use it up soon.  \nI ended up taking a few days off for Halloween.  \nWhen I came back Kevin was there to complain.   \nKevin: Man OP I am so glad you are back. I couldn't stand working all those hours. I worked for like 16 hours straight.  \n(NOTE: Our company doesn't even like us working more than 12 hours a day.)   \nHis 16 hours he was talking about... He worked an 8 hour shift. Was off for 8 hours and then came back for another 8 hours.   \nKevin: I did the math and I worked like 70 hours this week alone. I think I have like 24 hours of overtime pay.   \n(If the 70 hours were true. He'd have 30 hours of overtime. He's already full time. So 40 hours and he worked a max of 3 extra shifts. So yes he had about 24 hours of overtime, BUT only worked 64 hours.)  \nKevin: Please don't take anymore time off OP! That was too hard on me. (Sadly for him I still have like 80 hours of vacation time left.)\n\nKevin wants thanksgiving off but can't have it because he 1) Never filled out the proper form and 2) Another co-worker already requested the time off properly. Kevin complained to me.   \nKevin: Man I don't see why I can't have the time off. I talked to Boss about it like a month ago and she said it was okay.

Besides that they are going on a vacation for Christmas and I don't like flying it freaks me out.  \nMe: Well that sucks then. \n\nKevin has caused so many problems for our company that our boss requested that he be transferred to a different site.

Thankfully I don't have to spend too much time with him during the day but the small time that I do have to deal with him I have to hear him constantly complain.\n\nWhen he first started working there he was told and agreed to work the hours that he does. 8 hours Monday-Thursday and Friday and Sunday 4 hours each. So in total 40 hours a week. He was happy about working 40 hours at first. About 2 weeks into working with us he begs our boss to let him have Friday and Saturday off because he can't stand working so much. (Note: He works a 12 hour shift at a different location on Saturdays \"For fun.\") \n\nWhen he tired and failed to get his hours reduced he would complain to me about working so much and that he didn't think it was fair that I worked less than him.   \nMy hours: Monday-Thursday 8 hours a day and Sunday 8 hours a day. So 40 hours. Same as him.   \nHis logic: \"Well I did the calculations of you hours and it only came out to 32 hours a week.\"\n\nOur work has an app where our schedules are posted and what hours we are working.

He never showed up. He came in at his regular time. When the boss asked him what was up.   \nKevin: Oh haha. I guess I just forgot. Sorry.  \nNext day our boss gets a call from her boss demanding to know why she had changed Kevin's schedule without properly notifying him of the change. My boss did say that she talked to Kevin about the change and that he agreed to it and it was updated in the app.  \nBosses boss: Well I think for the future you should have a paper schedule that he can see.  \nWe DO have a paper schedule. At our desk. In plain sight that was updated. Pinned to the wall at head level. Next to our desk.\n\nKevin likes to talk a lot. He once told me that he likes to write.

But this semester he got Kevin. A brief sampling of Kevin\u2019s misadventures in the four hours a week he spends clerking in my husband\u2019s storefront: \n\n\u2014One of his biggest jobs is to answer the phone. On his first day he was instructed to pick up and say \u201cCustom Quality Plumbing, don\u2019t forget to ask about our seasonal maintenance deal specials, how can we help you today?\u201d Instead, he was answering the business phone, \u201cKevin residence, who\u2019s calling please?\u201d When confronted he explained he forgot the greeting and this is how his mother had taught him to answer phones. \n\n\u2014On his first day of work my husband did the standard welcome he does for all new employees, he brought in donuts and gathered everyone around to meet the new guy. When asked to say a few words about himself he said he \u201cI chose this job because all the good ones were taken,\u201d and when asked what he knows about plumbing he told a detailed story of a toilet-clogging dump he took a few months ago. \n\n\u2014One day he was asked to clean the break room kitchen. Someone had happened to bring in bagels. He threw out all the poppyseed bagels because \u201cthey had mold on them.\u201d \n\n\u2014My husband took him to a job site once to get a feel for interacting with customers and basic repairs. Kevin asked the client if he could take home a framed photo of the client\u2019s teenage daughter hanging in the living room.  \n\n\u2014For the first couple weeks Kevin kept stealing lunches from the break room, then denying he had done it when the other employees called him on it (it\u2019s a small business and obvious when someone has your food) then trying to pay them to give him their lunch. \n\n\u2014The first day he brought his own lunch he brought a pound of raw chuck and complained of an unsuitable work environment when my husband informed him there was nowhere for him to grill it at the store.\n\n\u2014He ate it raw. He got sick and had to go to the hospital. \n\n\u2014The company was hosting a holiday coat drive and asked Kevin to type up the flyer. Understanding his limits by this point they just instructed him to alter the date on the previous year\u2019s flyer. He managed to mess that up even still, and didn\u2019t notice until he had printed 250 full-color copies of the flyer. He thought if he threw the flyer out no one would know. But he threw it out in the main office trash can.\n\n\u2014Kevin\u2019s definitely never so much as seen drugs in his life but he\u2019s always talking like he\u2019s a original gangster. He approached a large tattooed African American employee at the business (who is actually a church pastor, an addiction counselor, and a volunteer sheriff) and tried to buy drugs from him.\n\n\u2014To impress a girl Kevin volunteered to watch her dogs. While working. I don\u2019t know the circumstances of why she asked a stranger to watch her dogs, but after about fifteen minutes Kevin got tired of waiting for her, and let the dogs loose. She came back looking for him and he pretended as though he\u2019d never net her. Edit \u2014 my husband says Kevin walked out of work to chat her up and she asked him to watch them while she went into a \u201cno dogs allowed\u201d store. So he knew where she was when he let them go! But he also says she got them back. \n\n\u2014Kevin had a decent amount of money saved from birthdays and Christmases (he often liked to \u201cflex\u201d on the other employees that he didn\u2019t need to work, he was just doing this for school, he had all the money he\u2019d ever need) but turns out he didn\u2019t even have it anymore because he lost all of it going long on GameStop at the height on the frenzy. He is irate that he could not sell his stock back at the original price and still on some level believes he was scammed. \n\n-He has aspirations to be a famous TikToker so would always be setting up these asinine \u201cpranks\u201d like trying to bust in on people while using the toilet, rigging heavy objects to fall on people, or yelling \u201cFIRE\u201d when there is no fire. That was when my husband and the others in charge met to discuss cutting him but decided the entertainment value of his Kevinness was worth sticking it through to the end of the semester. \n\n\u2014It all made sense when we met Kevin\u2019s mother. Kevina recently came in and confronted my husband as to why Kevin wasn\u2019t being paid for his work. He explained that it was a for-credit program through the high school (thinking Kevin might\u2019ve intentionally misled his mother) but no matter how he explained it, she didn\u2019t get it, and kept insisting he pay Kevin. And kept taking about \u201cpoints on the back end\u201d as well?\n\n\u2014Kevina knocked over an entire display on her way in and did not acknowledge it, try to clean it, or offer to pay for what was broken. In fact she charged right ahead with making her original demands. \n\n\u2014Kevin\u2019s dad is not in the picture and he\u2019s been calling my husband and a couple of the other guys at work \u201cdad\u201d semi-jokingly.  When Kevina came in, after making her demands for payment, she asked my husband how he plans to stay in Kevin\u2019s life if this is really only a semester. \n\n\u2014Kevin turned 18 last month. He celebrated by getting a \u201cCalvin pissing\u201d tattoo over his left peck, with his nipple serving as the penis. We know, because he showed an infection on the site to a young family who\u2019d come in to buy an L pipe. \n\nI\u2019ll ask my husband if there\u2019s anything I\u2019m missing but that\u2019s the crux of Kevin the Junior Plumber for you.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1637446859.0},{"title":"Kevin microwaved his food on a cast iron skillet","author":"A_Chair_Bear","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/qwho34\/kevin_microwaved_his_food_on_a_cast_iron_skillet\/","text":"I just don\u2019t even know anymore.

I hope we are doing well this evening and that we are all having our favorite snacks!!!! \n\nSo, my life has changed a lot recently. A lot for the better, a lot for the making me question my life decisions. \n\nThis, is the making me question my life decisions portion.\n\nI have been a student teacher at a high school for almost a whole semester. So far, it has been a fun experience, a lot of fun. You meet Kevins and Kevinas all the time, you know, high schoolers.\n\nHowever, this one moment with this one student made me realize, they don't teach you everything in college. \n\nThey. Really. Fucking. Don't. \n\nFor legal reasons, I have changed all of the names in this to protect all privacy, and those in this tale are under the age of 18.\n\nThe day started like a normal day. I had my normal students, a few Kevins\/Kevinas here and there, nothing new. However, I have this one student in the last hour of the day who is on a whole new fucking level. Lately, he has been off my radar, because he has been pretty wrapped in his work. However, recently we just ended a unit, and started a whole new one. So, he was pretty amped up. We will call him Kevin.\n\nSo, my desk for the student teaching, is located at the back of the class. Not the front. I like the back, so I can observe. Because my desk is at the very back, I am near Kevin and this girl named Saige. \n\nBy my desk, was a broken student desk. One of those desks with the desk connected to the chair. Well, these desks are kinda crappy, and the screws come undone a lot and you need to tighten them. The desk was messed up and needed to be tightened, so it was on put upside down till somebody could come get it. For some odd reason, students like the broken chairs. They will fight for it. SO, I put it at the very back of the class, by my desk, away from the others. \n\nNow, Kevin typically does what I tell him to do, but today he was pretty amped up and I just got done introducing the new unit.\n\nKevin stole the desk and replaced it with his PERFECTLY FUCKING FINE DESK with my back turned. I realized what he did, and took the desk from him. \n\nMe: Kevin, leave the desk alone, you can hurt yourself with it.\n\nKevin: it's a desk Ms. Blah(changed my name), how can it hurt me!?\n\nMe: I can think of a lot of different ways dude, leave the desk alone.\n\nKevin: yeah yeah whatever Ms. Blah!\n\nI turned my back to grab my energy drink and I heard Saige, \"kevin, what did she just say!?\"\n\nIn that moment, I turned around to find Kevin on the back of his perfectly fine desk chair, and  slamming BOTH of his hands down on the broken desk behind him, on one side and then the desk top flying up and face palming him right in face. It was seriously some shit out of Tom and Jerry.\n\nKevin then fell sideways off his chair and tumbled onto the floor.\n\nI will admit, I was in shock in what just happened. They don't teach you what to do when a kid literally Tom and Jerry's himself in the fucking face! \n\nKevin slowly stumbles up and sits back in his desk.\n\nMe:.....Kevin\n\nKevin: yes?\n\nMe: what did we learn today?\n\nKevin: like, in general?\n\nMe: no, in this moment?\n\nKevin: Don't sit on the back of a desk?\n\nMe: you literally smacked the information out of your head just now\n\nKevin: What information Ms. blah?\n\nMe: about not messing with a broken desk!\n\nKevin: we have a broken desk?\n\nI sent Kevin to the nurses office to get checked out, the nurse called his mom to have her take him to get checked for a concussion, because it was a loud \"SMACK\" on his forehead and he has some memory loss from the SMACK\n\nKevin does not have any concussions from the desk, he is still a Kevin though. \n\nAfter this incident, I called my old mentor teacher, at my college we all have these, and he laughed so hard he started coughing and yelled, \"THIS IS WHY I AM A TEACHER\"","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1637031303.0},{"title":"Kevina Floods Her Yard With Shit","author":"BillyBlueStems","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/qtxpy7\/kevina_floods_her_yard_with_shit\/","text":"Kevina and her 2 daughters just moved to our area from California.

I think that's right. My ex-wife's stepbrother. He was a gem in any number of ways but one story jumped out at me today while listening to a podcast I'm sure a few of you know. \n\nI was working as a mobile games tester at a small tech company in the pre-smartphone days. Great pay, easy job, fun start-up environment. Kevin was about the same age and a self-proclaimed gamer and PC expert so he asked me to set up an interview with my boss.  The first advice I gave him was not to mention the disaster that was the liquid-cooled gaming rig he'd built himself. \n\nSo the interview arrives. Mind you this was clearly advertised as a permanent position with opportunities to advance. Early on, Kevin was asked where he saw himself in 6 months. He immediately replied that he wasn't sure, he was figuring things out, but he thought this job would be cool while he figured out what he really wanted to do. \n\nOf course he didn't get the job. I knew why almost as soon as he left his interview because my boss was so shocked by that jackass answer and wanted to share with me. I told him I was fine with Kevin not being my coworker. \n\nSo of course my ex MIL and Kevin's dad come to me as if I have any control over any of this and ask me to see if he can get a second chance. After all Kevin was being honest, and honestly should be rewarded. I made it clear I was not going to stick my neck out when Kevin had so obviously given a dumbass answer.\n\nFortunately he went on to attend the state police academy then fail out just prior to graduating because of an alcohol-related shoulder injury.

The first meeting was bumpy since some of us forgot to install zoom until minutes to the meeting, and of course Kevin was 10 minutes late, because he needed help installing zoom.\n\nYou'd think that should be the end of his zoom troubles... but you'd be wrong!\n\nHe continued to be late for meetings for some reason. He even missed an external project kick-off meeting because he couldn't find the meeting invite,  assumed that he was uninvited to the meeting and so didn't bother asking anyone.\n\nOne time I had a one-on-one meeting with him. I received an email saying that he had signed into the meeting (a few minutes early), but when I signed in, he was not there. Apparently instead of waiting to be admitted into the meeting (as the pop-up window asks), he just closed the window and then went to our manager to ask for the meeting invite (for a meeting that our manager was not part of!)\n\nAnyways, we did find a work-around solution to all of Kevin's meeting problems: an hour before each meeting, another coworker would email the meeting invite to Kevin again.

(Side note, a \"kit\" in lab work is a product that contains all the reagents needed for a lab procedure and a very detailed protocol. I've had students with 1-2 months of lab experience being able to use these kits with no problem.)\n\nFor the fellow labrats, Kevin was doing a very standard qPCR from cDNA.\n\nSince I had the most recent experience with this experiment in the lab, Kevin asked me if I could take a look at his experimental design. I agreed. For some reason, his experimental write-up lacked any specifcs (like how much sample to use, what setting to use on the machine etc). I gave hims suggestions on these specifics.\n\nSo he did the experiment, and it failed. He then did it again and it failed again!\n\nThis might be a good spot to mention that Kevin doesn't like to ask for help... And it is impossible to offer him help either... so he worked away at this on his own.\n\nA week later, he came to me, and said he has solved the issue! He was using the wrong amounts of samples. I looked at his magic numbers, and they were basically the same as what I told him to do! (He was orders of magnitude off before).\n\nSo I'm not sure why, but he decided to disregard my recommendations, and then spent a week to arrive at what I had recommended.

I'll have to explain some of the procedures in order for you to get a feel of how wrong situations can turn, if you studied biology, genetics, microbiology or anything related you might already know and you can skip ahead.\n\n**\\[explanation 1\\]** So for seeding bacteria one of the methods is using an L shaped glass stick, said stick is disinfected by dipping the L part into a jar containing alcohol (about 70-90%) and then burning it so anything on it burns. We also have to work with a bunsen burner right in the middle of the workspace since hot air rises so it creates a kind of shield that prevents biologic contamination. A jar of alcohol and a fire source right in the middle, you can already see where this is going\n\n**\\[Kevin story 1\\]** So we were disinfecting the L shaped glass sticks and suddenly a burning drop of alcohol falls from mine into my jar, it catches fire instantly and I rush to put the lid on to drown it. My labmate looks at me like I almost killed us.Enter the Kevin of the story. He, like us, was in the middle of disinfecting, and, like me, a droplet falls on his jar and sets it on flame. I'd expect him to react like I did, but he just stares at it, and drops the L stick as if he was a tribe chief dropping a person into a volcano to calm it down. Not only did that not work, the weight tipped the jar and it spilt its content, the whole table was burning and Kevin tried to grab the petri dish as if he was gonna save it from the fire. Somehow Kevin hands catch fire, I dunno why he also rubbed alcohol on his hands (this was 2013, way pre-covid so no reason to be disinfecting your hands like crazy) then he runs aroun the class panicking with his hands outwards as if he was playing tag (fire tag that is). Luckily teacher grabbed the extinguisher and put him out. After all settled I look at my labmate and say \"Now you're glad I reacted like I did right?\" and he says \"you can't compare yourself to Kevin\" Pretty true\n\n**\\[Explanation 2\\]** So in many procedures for extracting DNA and RNA we use, among other chemicals chloroform (Pretty sure everyone knows the effects of chloroform but if breathed for too long it can also be toxic and deadly)\n\n**\\[Kevin Story 2\\]** So we were extracting DNA from plant leaves and by the time we were at the last steps the class starts feeling a bit dizzy and sleepy (my medication prevented me from being sleepy as it's used to treat narcolepsy) by the time my labmate started to feel heavily sleepy I was very concerned, so I get up and look around (teacher had left us to do this last part alone since it was pretty simple) And I discover that not only our dear Kevin has left the chloroform open inside the fume hood (he was the last to use it), he didn't even bother turning it on, and since by then teacher already had left he couldn't check that no one did that. So I put the lid on the chloroform, turn the fume extractor on and scold Kevin \"why the hell did you leave the chloroform open, you could have killed us all!\" and he looks at me, dead in the eye, and says \"I thought chloroform only worked in movies\".No offense Kevin but I hope whichever path of biology you went down has nothing to do with contagious diseases, animal control or health in general cause you'll destroy earth yourself","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1636355055.0},{"title":"Kevin doesn't know how to use oven.","author":"TobaWentBang","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/qoj69r\/kevin_doesnt_know_how_to_use_oven\/","text":"I work at a popular fast food chicken restaurant.

From Google: \n\n>Xylene is a colorless, flammable liquid with a sweet odor. Exposure to xylene can irritate the eyes, nose, skin, and throat. Xylene can also cause headaches, dizziness, confusion, loss of muscle coordination, and in high doses, death. Workers may be harmed from exposure to xylene.\n\nThis might also be a good place to point out that our lab did not have a chemical fume hood, which one would normally use to prevent exposure to things like xylene. The lab was converted from an office space and lacked the ducting that was needed to install a fume hood.\n\nWith that said, we had a really good process in the lab to minimize exposure, and no one had issues before. \n\nSo one day we came into the lab, and it smells off. Sometimes there are weird smells in the lab, and with the HVAC in the building, it could be from other units in the building, so we don't always investigate right away, unless the smell persists.\n\nAt some point, we were starting to get a bit light-headed, especially my one coworker (let's call her Victoria), who was feeling particularly dizzy close to fainting.\n\nSo we started investigating.\n\nAs it turns out, Kevin had started doing this procedure. For some reasons he decided that the xylene needed to be refreshed after every use (it didn't). He did find the designated waste bin for xylene (has a special seal to prevent exposure and the whole bin goes to special chemical waste disposal eventually).\n\nWhere he went wrong was he had spilled the xylene, and didn't tell anyone! (There are special protocols in-place for dealing with chemical spills. In order to work in a lab, you need to pass a test and this was part of that test. Kevin had done the test 6 months prior.)\n\nSo he spilled this chemical, and just soaked it up with some paper towels and put all the soaked paper towels ON TOP of the waste bin.\n\nRemember Victoria who was feeling the effects most strongly? The waste bin was under her work bench!\n\nIt's not the first time Kevin had tried to kill us, but this has been the most elaborate attempt... Or so we say in the team.\n\n......\n\nOther attempts: basically there were a lot of fire alarm tests in our building for some reasons, to the point where we ignore fire alarms until a firetruck actually shows up. Well, a couple times, the alarm turned out to not be tests. \n\nSince Kevin literally did nothing at work most days (another story), he was usually the one to investigate the alarm situation. We soon realized that he was the wrong person to sent, because when it did turn out to be a real alarm, Kevin would not tell any of us...","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1636219729.0},{"title":"Kevin the Scientist","author":"CongregationOfVapors","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/qo3z19\/kevin_the_scientist\/","text":"I am a research scientist in biotech and at my last job I had the pleasure of having a Kevin on my very small team.

Has been and always will be.  The following account needs no exposition.\n\nKevin, though nine years into a serious relationship (with a nice girl who once was pretty, but now, after all this time with him, looks emaciated), has an impulsive proclivity to creepily and vividly explain what types of sexual acts he'd perform on his co workers.  Quotes of critical acclaim around our circle include the brilliance of \"I don't go down for any bitch\", \"I'd slam my c*ck sideways inside her a$$, and, my personal favorite, \"when they tell you to \"fuck off\", what they're really saying is 'fuck in'\", whatever that means.\n\nKevin has an interesting body type.  I'm not even sure you could classify him as an endo, meso, or ectomorph, but moreso a hybrid of the three.  He's got a receding hairline on the right and left sides of his head, except for in the center, which, when he grows it out, looks like a blonde mohawk, which he spikes with gel, making him look even more like a sleaze bag. Despite his light blonde hair, he claims to be 100 % Italian.   He's got a big nose, wears glasses, is barrel chested (71 inch bust), has a roughly 60 inch waist, and tiny chicken legs.  As far as his personality goes, he's a bit of a sparkplug.  Meaning that the littlest thing could send him into a psychotic rage.\n\n He's so top heavy that he often has balance coordination issues, such as tripping over his own feet and running in a zigzag motion for several blocks, unable to stop until he either runs into a wall or parking meter.  But back to the sex.  A few years back, Kevin met and slept with a girl you'd probably classify as a respectable 8.  He bragged that the sex lasted, to quote, \"from 5:00 - 5:55 am\".  She had an injured rib which evidently he re - broke during \"the pounding\", and even mentioned that her cat licked his ass during the sex.  I'm not making this up.\n\nHe bragged that she said verbatim \"you're very enthusiastic\".  He told her \"you ain't seen nothin' yet\", and proceeded to perform cunnilingus.  When I asked what happened next, he just put his head down and indecipherably mumbled, the obvious indicator that it didn't go well.  I'd have loved to be a fly on the wall for that.  Fast forward ten years.  Kevin has since moved to North Carolina, and we haven't spoken often, but one night recently, I received a frantic call from him.\n\nI felt like a 911 operator.  He was hyperventilating and unable to speak.  \"Something happened\", he stated.  \"Something bad...\".  \"What is it?\", I asked inquisitively.  \"I...ah....God.  Ah...sorry I'm trying to catch my breath\".  \"Okay man, just calm down.  Breathe easy, and compose yourself\".  \"Right\".  The tension began to rise.  The suspense fueled by an adrenaline rush of curiosity.  I thought maybe he was in trouble or hurt, until he said it - \n\n\"I have erectile dysfunction...\".  I was taken aback.  \"Wait, WHAT???\".  \"My cock.  It won't...fuck.  I'm going to have a break down...\".  \"Chill, dude.  Relax\".  \"I'm calling from jail...I got arrested\".  I've always secretly hated Kevin, so I was gleaming inside learning about this revelation.  His perceived indignation.  \"Why are you in jail????\".  As the story goes, Kevin proceeded to explain that his anti - convulsion medication was affecting his erections.  Why is he on such meds?  Mostly because when he trips over his own feet, he doesn't understand the concept of putting your arms out to break the fall, so instead he just faceplants into the pavement.\n\nHe told me in vivid, gory detail that he cheated on his girlfriend, but got caught when the other woman showed up on his doorstep.  The other woman had no idea Kevin was in a relationship.  This woman was a teacher at the school he taught in, and after cultivating the truth about his deception, told everyone at school that Kevin couldn't get it up.  It spread through school and the community writ large like a wildfire, so Kevin, out of his animalistic, brutish rage, did the unthinkable.\n\nActually, that last statements a bit dramatic.  Maybe \"unthinkable\" isn't the right word.  I'd say \"extraordinarily bizarre\" is more fitting.  He walked into a school board meeting intentionally late, after everyone had been seated, grabbed the microphone, and said \"Are you laughing now?\", as he unzipped his pants and exposed himself, not completely, but through the outline in the fabric of his boxers.  \"Sup, Kayla\", were the last words he said before bolting and being pulled over roughly fifteen minutes later.  Typing this up truly has me embarrassed that I'm even in semi - regular contact with him.\n\nThe charge - indecent exposure.  He was fired immediately and arrested.  He spent four months in county jail before being released and returning home.  He's been ostracized out of embarrassment.  Everyone knows the story, even here in Pennsylvania.  He now keeps a low profile, but repeatedly posts quotes on Facebook, emphasizing certain words like \"just had a really HARD day\", or \"Five Dolla'...Five Dolla' FOOT LONG\".  It's truly pathetic, but nevertheless something he'll never live down.\n\nHe even posted pictures of the girl from his school, and added quotes like \"it's not my fault you're too ugly to get a FIVE DOLLA' FOOT LONG!\".  I keep reminding him that these quotes are getting old, and really stupid.  Especially the Subway jingle.  His account got suspended indefinitely because the girl threatened a lawsuit for defamation.  Now he's faded back into obscurity.  He lost his teaching license and now works at a steel mill.  His coworkers have dubbed him with the moniker \"Soft Serve\".  I know this because he told me, oblivious to the fact that I'm only gonna post his BS on Reddit anyway.\n\nThis will be his legacy.\n\nThe End","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1636077432.0},{"title":"Is it audacity or Disrespect?

But today she might have pulled her last Kevinmove. As in she *royally* fucked up. She pissed off not only the manager trying to fire her, but the manager that defended her through *everything* else she's ever done. The one person in her corner just walked out.\n\nToday was one of two days she had to work this week. She 'has a lot going on'. It was going to be her first day back after three days off. She'd just been warned not to come in late. *Yes, Kevina, two minutes does count.* In fact, we were having a mandatory staff meeting that afternoon to discuss getting to work on time (even though she's literally the only member of staff that shows up late.) You would think it would be the *one* day she would make a point to be on time.\n\nBut, no. 7:00 am rolls around. My uber shows up, five minutes after my shift ended (fifteen minutes after she's supposed to already be there.) Nothing. I call the manager. The manager calls her. She won't answer. I had to cancel my uber, and now I'm stuck working until someone shows up. Both managers are racing to get here, but they both live far away. But both are keeping me updated, telling me they're both spamming her phone with no avail.\n\nAt 8:20 I finally get to leave. I'm excused for the noon meeting, because I'm leaving late. She's just getting back to the managers as I'm walking out the door. But not only did the managers get there, but so did her replacement. So, after being over an hour late she's a no call no show.\n\nBut by some miracle for her, and curse for me, she still has her job. She's reminded of the meeting at noon. She comes in late. *She comes in late.* She comes in late with a full face of makeup, hair done and with an attitude about having to be there at all. She's at the door asking 'if this is over, because I have things to do?'\n\nI don't think she ever planned on showing up. She was set to work from 7-3pm. She was supposed to still be on shift technically. So, for her to have plans at 1pm? A little suspect.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd, side note. She thinks she'll get off Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Years Eve, and New Years Day. Not only is it bold to assume she would be given all that time off when there's people with family and children on staff- but also, pretty bold of her to think she'd have a job.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: I forgot to post the lead up to this.\n\nBut, she's late. As in, always late. And we got into a spat about her being late. And when the manager confronted her, her response was to send the manager screenshots of the past two weeks. She clocked in on time twice out of ten days. And considering we are supposed to clock in 5 minutes before and be there at the desk at the start of shift. . . she clocked in late every time.\n\nBut I do have a post on another sub ranting about all of that and the problem that caused me- if you want to look?

Because of this - and because we have to be able to trace absolutely everything we install on an aircraft (be it a split pin or screw costing a few cents, or a jet engine costing seven figures) back to the point of manufacture - the Company I work for has specific procedures to follow, in order to get spare parts from the delivery truck to the aircraft.\n\n\nOne of my colleagues is the antagonist of this story. \u201cKevin\u201d has been working on aircraft for decades and has worked for our employer for about four years now. Kevin is somewhat difficult to deal with and he has a reputation for making Strange Decisions.\n\nAnyhoo, one morning a couple of months back, I was tasked with installing a part on an aircraft (not expensive by aviation standards, but still worth a few Kilomonies). I could see in The System that the part had been requisitioned and issued out of the stores to the aircraft, so I went to the \u2018Parts Awaiting Fitment\u2019 storage shelves to get it. It wasn\u2019t there. I asked the stores guys what had happened, one of them said, \u201coh, I had it sitting on the bench [a shelf just in front of a window that we slide open when we want to talk to the stores guys] ready to put on the \u2018Parts Awaiting Fitment\u2019 shelves and someone grabbed it while I finished booking it out to the aircraft in The System\u201d. So it never actually made it onto the \u2018Parts Awaiting Fitment\u2019 shelves. Cue me running around for half an hour fruitlessly looking for the damn part. Then I had a hunch and approached Kevin.\n\nMe: \u201cHey Kevin, do you know where the [part] for [AircraftRegistration] is?\u201d  \nKevin: \u201cI have it, it\u2019s on my toolbox\u201d [we all have big-arse toolboxes on wheels, fitted with wooden tops that can be used as work benches].  \nMe: \u201cWHY??!

There has yet to be a day where she didn't say something or do something that made me glance around to see if I was being filmed and this was all some elaborate joke. \n\nI met her about 3 months ago. I work at a newly opened hotel, so the first month was a lot of work. But day one was just the standard 'getting to know' one another and going over the expectations of management. Right away I pegged her as someone I wouldn't ever really be fond of. She felt the need to put in her two cents where ever she could interject. She was a suck up and attention seeking and just overall not the person I'm drawn to.  She's like a parrot, repeating your own words back to you as a question or like it's just a response to what you said. \n\nWhile annoying, the problems didn't start popping up until a week in when we were actually able to start setting up the property. Immediately she began to dictate, even though most of her instructions were not what was supposed to be done. \n\nThe first red flag was when I found another coworker who seemed to be going at my same pace and flow, Jenna. Jenna and I were working well together and had a good system going. That's when our Kevin stepped in and offered to help, apparently she'd finished her side of the hall. Sure, no big deal, right? She can put a coffee pot in each room. Everything was going great until we noticed she would wander into the room with the coffee maker, and leave with said coffee maker in her arms. But she would take the time to mark it off the checklists we were using to keep track of what still needed to be put into the rooms. \n\nThe next day Jenna and I decided that we would break off on our own and just make sure one floor was completely done as much as possible (we were still waiting on shipments of things to arrive). We went back over the rooms and started noticing almost nothing was in the rooms. But there were things marked off. We caught our Kevin walking around with a clipboard and pen and when asked what she was doing she said *she* was the one that was going to check the rest of the rooms, because 'Fuck the checklist'. She was going into the room and writing everything that was in the room down. That was what she was doing. Oh well, not our problem. \n\nAfter a lunch break another shipment came in- the last one we needed to complete rooms. We notice she left all of her things including her clipboard in the middle of the hallway and was nowhere to be found. Oh well, again. Not our problem. We fix the entirety of the floor (having to go back over what she had done herself yesterday and what she had supposedly went back over that day.)\n\nWe found her hours later. (Mind you this was a week before opening and we had already lost a lot of prep time. We were cutting it close.) When the manager called everyone up so we could do training to make the bed the correct way. So the entire staff, who had just finished loading boxes onto the floors then distributing the stuff inside to rooms, got off the elevator to find a floor that was supposed to be at least somewhat completed, a complete wreck. There were trash cans everywhere and everything was piled out in the hallway in front of room doors. \n\nShe peaked her head out of a room to giggle about the mistake she made. The massive mistake. The one that was going to set us behind an entire day. This floor was supposed to be completed. Beds and all. Now that was going to be impossible. All because of her. Of course nobody thought it was as cute and quirky as she did. So, she ran down to cry to the manager. But- preserver we did. Me and Jenna made it our mission to fix all that Kevin did. And there were many many mistakes. Things that she'd checked off and things that she put into rooms on days when that was her *only* job. So, knowing everyone was mad at her, she called out the next few days. Getting out of doing any of the hard labor that was left to be done.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few days later we opened and the new problems began. She had a habit of telling people they can do things they aren't supposed to, then saying 'just tell them Kevin said it's fine.' This happened when she invited a bunch of people into the hotel to have breakfast (without asking for permission from anyone.) And these people were not the most. . . classy people, and instead of leaving when asked, they argued with the *owner* because 'Kevin said we could!'\n\nThen I walked in on her one night telling a guest of the hotel that he could park in the business' across the streets parking lot. That it was okay 'Kevin said it was okay!' As if that business cared who she was and wouldn't just have his car towed. \n\nShe *forgot to charge someone. She just didn't get a card. Didn't make him pay. That's her one job.*\n\nShe over charged a woman $1500. *Nobody can figure out just* ***how*** *she did it.* \n\nOn the computer was a day-glow green post it with 'DO NOT RENT 235' On it. Clear as day. When I came in she was in the process of checking that person in. I didn't realize, because I was literally walking through the door. But then I got the backlash from it, because she was gone before they realized the room was still very dirty and came back down. Then, upon further investigation I saw that she had changed the room number SPECIFICALLY to 235. We had a whole empty property and she chose the ONE room she wasn't supposed to rent out. Not only that, the person was already preassigned to a different room, so it shouldn't have been changed, and it wasn't a mistake. You have to click through a LOT of 'are you sure' type screens to change that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd outside of work she might be worse. She told me a story about how she was sitting out on the porch and she heard screams for help coming from the woods. And she was going to investigate until her husband stopped her. And she didn't find it suspicious at all that the person calling for help was having a full blown conversation with them. Not just screaming or trying to come *out* of the woods.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1635146345.0},{"title":"Police dispatch Kevin tries enlisting me in the bomb squad","author":"MichaelGale33","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/qcvfg5\/police_dispatch_kevin_tries_enlisting_me_in_the\/","text":"So this was about ten years ago when I was in college.

Kevin decides to custom build a monstrosity of a computer to replace the desktops.\n\nWhile I was gone at class, Kevin has decided that there is not enough space in our room for the ogre he is building, so he moves MY bed out into the hallway. Kevin is gone at the computer store when I get back and see this. I return the favor by moving my bed back in and his bed out to the front yard. A fraternity brother is taking a nap on it when Kevin returns and bitches a fit.\n\nKevin keeps tripping the circuit breaker. His computer is drawing way more current than it was designed for. Kevin tries to solve this problem by placing a gas generator precariously on the window sill and plugging into that. This works until a variety of bugs and one very confused squirrel attempt to make our room their new home. I tell Kevin the generator has got to go which of course results in him bitching a new fit.\n\nKevin has hired an electrician to install a new circuit for our room for his computer. It is winter, and the average temperature outside is in the negatives. Our room requires no heater. The computer is so large and energy intensive that if we DON'T open up the window with the snow outside the room turns into a sauna.\n\nOur fraternity rents our internet from the University. I'm on door duty. The IT guy knocks on the door. He tells me that he think there is either an error or a hardware malfunction as it shows our single house is consuming a substantial portion of the entire university's bandwidth. I show him to the router box.\n\nHe confirms that there is no error. Our house is indeed consuming a large amount of data. He tells me I have 72 hours to solve this problem or the University will both throttle our speed way down and put a cap on overall data. I head strait to Kevin.\n\nKevin is trying to argue that the billion files he is downloading are encrypted so IT has no idea what the data is. It takes awhile for Kevin to understand that IT doesn't care what he is downloading, but that if he continues this behavior there will be NO internet for him or anyone else in the house.\n\nKevin now works for NASA.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1633310451.0},{"title":"Kevin forgot how to drink","author":"dado_stark","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/ptrxn7\/kevin_forgot_how_to_drink\/","text":"My friend's actual name is Kevin.

She wasn\u2019t the brightest and believed some of the most ridiculous things. The one time that stands out the most in my mind, was once when we went to a restaurant. \n\nKevina was always telling us she was a vegetarian. She wasn\u2019t quite rabid about it, but was always touting the health benefits of going vegetarian and how she had been one since she was in elementary school and was doing great. Well, I went out to eat once with a small group of friends, plus Kevina. We all placed our orders and I was surprised when she ordered a cheese burger. After the waiter left, I asked:\n\nMe: So, you aren\u2019t vegetarian anymore?\nKevina: I\u2019m vegetarian, not vegan. I eat dairy and eggs. \nMe: But the burger is made of beef. \nK: Yeah\u2026 and\u2026\nMe: \u2026.You know beef is cow meat, right?\nK: No it\u2019s not\u2026.\n\nTurns out, Kevina was NEVER really a vegetarian. She thought because beef, pork and mutton weren\u2019t called by the same name as the animals they came from, they weren\u2019t meat. She had been avoiding chicken, turkey, fish, lamb, veal (because she somehow heard veal was from baby cows), goat, etc. but all the while eating beef, pork, bacon, mutton etc. \n\nIt turns out, her parents were mostly the blame for this, initially anyway. She came home from school one day dead set on being a vegetarian. They didn\u2019t want to give up meat so convinced her that these certain meats weren\u2019t meat. \n\nHow she made it to her freshman year of college without having this bubble burst, I have not a clue. \n\nAfter we convinced her that what we were telling her was the truth -this was the early 2000\u2019s so none of us had smart phones, we had to go to her dorm and make her type \u201cwhat is beef\/pork\/bacon\/mutton\u201d into google- she tried to go vegetarian but decided it was too much of a hassle as we kept informing her that certain things she really liked eating\/drinking weren\u2019t vegetarian.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1631545069.0},{"title":"The difference between a fart and a shart","author":"MissElyse1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/pn8nnm\/the_difference_between_a_fart_and_a_shart\/","text":"I am the Kevin.\n\nI have had really bad gastro the last week, Im talking, in hospital on a drip bad.

And this year, they started opening the class up to freshmen. One such freshman is today's protagonist, Kevin. \n\nKevin (14M) is one of those guys so stupid it's draining to interact with. He's CONSTANTLY joking (serious Kevin doesn't exist) and screwing around. He's always saying horribly inappropriate things and fucking around in dangerous ways. He is the ultimate Kevin. \n\n-----\n\nIt was the first week of school last month and Kevin introduces himself by screaming constantly and bragging about how he can \"lift 53 pounds\". Kevin looks a bit like drew Carey pre weight loss. At 14. And keep in mind I ain't exactly light as a feather, so you know i mean it when I say he is not ready to lift 53 pounds. \n\n------\n\nKevin started showing up in an anime shirt on the daily, puzzled as to why we didn't think it was cool. He has latched on to me since I'm the only older guy in the class, and the teacher has basically designated me \"Kevin Duty\". That is, i am tasked with making sure he doesn't kill anyone. \n\nSo fast forward a few weeks and we are bench pressing dumbbells. I know I'm weak and so I only try lifting 15 pounds each arm, whereas Kevin gets overconfident and insists he can bench 40 in each arm, swinging the dumbbells around like a madman.\n\nWe are assigned to work in partners and I'm Kevin's caretaker for the day. Kevin \"tries\" for about thirty seconds, and our job is to stand behind and spot each other to make sure nobody drops a dumbbell. I tell Kevin as I'm getting onto the bench to spot me, and I begin. I close my eyes for ten seconds to push through the bench press. \n\nWrong fucking choice. \n\nI open my eyes to see Kevin grinning like a motherf@cking trollface. I launch up faster than Usain bolt on an ICBM to when I see him gazing into my eyes holding a pair of 30-pounders about a foot above my nuts, and he's barely able to hold on. I launch backward and Kevin drops the dumbbells onto the ground. \n\n-----\nKevin also thinks it's hilarious to tell \"the vegans are coming, run!\". And other such inappropriate things. He even yelled into the girls locker room and ran away, and left me there to catch the blame. \n\n----- \nKevin could not figure out a simple combination lock. No, not how to get the numbers right, I'm not good at that either. I mean he literally did not understand that it was a dial to turn. \n\n-----\n\nKevin claimed he would \"eat\" anyone who broke into his locker even though he doesn't lock it. \n-----\n\nKevin pounded the locker in anger trying to \"force it shut\" even though it was already shut. Apparently he thought that if you kick the locker enough it will lock. \n------\n\nKevin managed to get away with lying down on a bench for an entire class where we were supposed to walk a mile on the track, with the teacher only discovering after class. He tried walking the first quarter mile but gave up when the whole class passed a full lap in front of him. \n----\n\nKevin screamed like a banshee when I had the intestinal fortitude to commit the heinous crime of ... opening a soda that spilled some foam onto his empty unused lunch tray. To Kevin this is the end of the world. Yeah. \n\n----\n\nOh yeah, and he runs around yelling \"i have the power of anime!\" and repeatedly joking about how he should identify as a girl to get into their locker room. Haha, so funny Kevin, i forgot to laugh. Considering x-posting to r\/talesofneckbeards lmao. \n\nSo that's it for stories from a Kevin containment specialist.

Some of you wanted more stories about my former room mate Kevin, so I\u2019ve compiled some here I think you\u2019ll enjoy. This is a long post so buckle up.\n\nBut first I\u2019d like to explain a few things about Kevin and our living arrangement. Me and Kevin had been casual friends for about two years prior to us living together for a year. It was his apartment, and I just rented a room in it. Ultimately I had no say in some of the shenanigans he got up to because his name was on the lease. I mean, I did try to talk him out of it, but Kevin was a determined and motivated lad with a passion for destruction. \n\nI don't think Kevin had any mental issues. His Kevinness was just the perfect combination of cluelessness, arrogance, impatience, curiosity and a healthy dose of bad genes. I do love the lad and he was a good friend, but living with him and constantly worrying for him made me absolutely insane. Enjoy! \n\n**Kevin can\u2019t remember his passwords**\n\nKevin would always forget his password for everything. Not remembering a password isn\u2019t a \u201dKevin\u201d thing.. But it is if you only have one password for everything and that specific password is TATTOOED into your left arm. \n\nHe would sit there for a few seconds\u2026 thinking\u2026 Then he would remember the tattoo\u2026   \nBut where was it again?? He would search his arm, every day\u2026 Eventually find it\u2026 Type it in, and then exclaiming *\u201dOh, thank god!\u201d*\n\n(In Kevins defence: He had a massive sleeve and you wouldn\u2019t be able to see the password if you just looked at the tattoos quickly, so it wasn\u2019t on full display for the world to see. But I knew where it was by heart and he didn\u2019t so there you go.)\n\n**Kevin thought all gingers smelled the same**\n\nYes. Kevin was convinced all gingers smelled the same. He described it as the scent of sour milk and didn\u2019t want to be near anyone with red hair. \n\nHe went through a lot of trouble to avoid them. One time he was supposed to take the train, and ended up getting off on the wrong stop because a ginger had sat down next to him. He was stranded in the middle of nowhere for half a day - but happy with his decision. Why didn't he just find another seat? Who knows. \n\n**Kevin was lactose intolerant, but thought he could \u201dhack\u201d his body**\n\nHe figured if he kept eating food containing lactose he would eventually become immune. He did this during the three years I knew him and he did not become immune. In fact, I witnessed him shit his pants on numerous occasions.\n\n**Speaking of shit: Kevin was banned from the local water park**\n\nSo the story goes Kevin and his cousin (who from what I hear is also a Kevin) had been there when they was 15-16. There is no delicate way of phrasing what happens next, so I\u2019m just gonna be blunt. \n\nThe Kevins decided to shit in the shallow pool full of small children to see how long it would take before someone noticed the two logs and blamed one of the little kids. \n\nBut since this is a story about two Kevins, y\u2019all already know it doesn\u2019t end well for them. They was found out immediately after shitting in the pool because one of the life guards had seen them giggling entering the pool and grown suspicious. \n\n**Kevin and his secret bottle**\n\nAs I stated in [this post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/pelvpq\/kevin_takes_out_the_trash_in_creative_ways\/), Kevin didn\u2019t like unnecessary trips anywhere. If he could do the thing he was supposed to do without taking any steps that would be ideal. \n\nSo Kevin had concocted the most \u2019elegant\u2019 plan. Sometimes, during the night, we all have to go. Most people get up and walk to the bathroom, but Kevin wasn\u2019t like most people\u2026 He had a special piss bottle under his bed. It was mostly used for night time, he assured me, but sometimes when he was playing video games he used it too. \n\n**Kevin ordered a sex doll**\n\nHe decided on a whim he wanted one, but the ladies wasn\u2019t in stock and he sure as hell wasn\u2019t gonna hump a man. So he ordered a sheep and humped that instead. \n\n**Kevin loved messing with metal**\n\nKevin became inspired by TV shows where people would make things. One particularly terrifying session of complete madness inspired by these TV shows was when Kevin tried to melt precious metals in the living room. \n\nIn the show people found old electronics and extracted the gold, silver and other metals from them and sold it. Kevin liked this very much, and tried it with his stereo. He took it apart and found some metal he figured was silver. It was attached to plastic which he couldn\u2019t remove, so he decided to melt it. Indoors. With a tiny lighter. \n\nI walked in on him burning the plastic. He was sitting on the floor with all this junk around him, saying *\u201dow..\u201d* over and over as the lighter burned his thumb. Black smoke rising from the plastic. I tried to reason with him, saying breathing in plastic is bad. He didn\u2019t care, but eventually stopped as he grew impatient. \n\nIt turned out the metal he was trying to extract was steel. This was not the only time he tried this. I can\u2019t even remember how many times Kevin was trying to mess with metals and plastic in the living room.\n\n**Kevin didn\u2019t believe in WW2**\n\nHe was a firm believer that the WW2 was just fiction, pretty much. He had read a conspiracy theory about the Holocaust being fake and believed every word of it. This was true for most things. If it was on the internet, he would believe it. \n\n**Kevin read a book called \u201dThe Game\u201d and told a girl she looked like a giant ham.** \n\nApparently in the book the author tells you to be *ever so slightly* mean to a woman and this will somehow make her like you. \n\nKevin was not familiar with ever so slightly. He found a girl he thought was cute. She was wearing fishnet stockings, and was a bit heavy just the way he liked \u2019em. \n\nHe told her she looked like a massive uncooked ham inside a net, and then laughed at her. Kevin got slapped in the face. I doubt he\u2019s read a book ever since. \n\n**Kevin and the beeswax**\n\nAnother time Kevin got inspired by a TV show was when someone talked about beeswax. Kevin learner you could:\n\n1. Make candles with it (Boring)\n2. Eat it (Boring)\n3. Use it as glue (Kinda fun)\n4. Waterproof things like boots with it (Somehow more fun than glue..?)\n\nKevin didn't quite understand condensation and was always complaining about how our windows would fog up. He thought if he waterproofed the window with beeswax that wouldn\u2019t happen. So he smeared melted beeswax everywhere on all the windows and the wood surrounding them in the hopes it would \u201dKeep the fog from coming in\u201d. (again, his apartment. I didn't have a say in this) \n\nObviously the beeswax eventually hardened and all the windows was streaked with it.\n\nSilver lining: The living room no longer smelled like burnt plastic. It smelled like burnt plastic AND beeswax. \n\n**Kevin and his sword**\n\n\\*sigh\\*\n\nHe had this \u201dsword\u201d.. It was barely even a sword. He made it himself during one of his TV-inspired adventures. He tried to make an actual sword, but gave up after he couldn\u2019t figure out how to make metal \u201dglow\u201d (his words not mine) so he could bend it. Instead he just cut open a beer can and super glued the sharp metal pieces to a thick stick he had sanded down. \n\nAnyway\u2026 He kept the ugliest sword in the world in his car \u201dfor protection\u201d. Kevin was a large lad with lots of tattoos and a hint of insanity in his eyes so people rarely messed with him, but it made him feel safe. He did get in trouble for it though, but that\u2019s a long story for another time.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve been getting lots of messages about posting some more stories about Kevin. Maybe I\u2019ll do another post focusing on more of his TV-adventures and the car sword story in the future. I had no idea people would enjoy this so much. It *almost* made living with him worth it lol.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1630434177.0},{"title":"Kevin takes out the trash in creative ways","author":"Boopmister","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/pelvpq\/kevin_takes_out_the_trash_in_creative_ways\/","text":"A former buddy of mine is a Kevin of the highest order.

He'd offered me a job at their store, which was closer to campus and offered to pay me slightly above minimum wage, so I was happy to accept when they invited me to meet their yogi outside of work (they followed some small yoga cult that I won't even TRY to explain because it involves magic diaries and a guy who psychically monitors your mental health). I ride with them to a large city 2 hours away, and am surprised to find that this religious leader I was meeting was an *extremely* pregnant 22-year-old white suburban mom who hosted private meditation sessions in her living room while entertaining her toddler son. This is our Kevina. (Fun sidenote, her husband wound up being a storyboard artist for a particularly-amazing animated show that had just become massively popular at the time, and he showed me the \"ultraviolent cubist lesbian erotica\" comic that had allegedly earned him the job, so that was neat.)\n\n*The Kevinry*\n\nNow, the first step to this meditation crash-course was for Kevina to just have a casual conversation with me to get to know me a bit. Fair enough. We get to talking about how Boss and I had met during an astronomy class, which triggers the following conversation:\n\nKevina: Oh my god! I **LOVE** astronomy! You know, I bet you can't guess what we're naming this one when he's born! *\\*gesturing at her belly\\**\n\nMe: Oh, uh, there are a ton of great astronomers you could name him after, so I wouldn't have the slightest clue what to guess, haha. What did you pick?\n\nKevina: You have to GUESS! I'll give you a hint; it's the biggest star!\n\nMe: Oh, so something relating to VY Canis Majoris? That's pretty cool. *\\*Kevina looks at me like I'm speaking gibberish\\**\n\nKevina: Huh? No, that's not a star! We're naming him Sirius! It's the biggest and most important star in the whole sky!\n\nMe: Ohhh, okay, sorry, haha. That's still cool, though. But what do you mean by 'most important'?\n\nKevina: I thought you studied this? Sirius is the *highest level* of star. It's got the most points possible!\n\nMe: I'm...sorry? What? I don't follow...\n\nKevina: Ugh, it's simple. So, you study stars, right? So you know that most of them are just basic 5-point ones. Some are bigger 7-point stars, but they're rare and more powerful. But Sirius is the only *9-point* star! It's like the king of stars! \n\n(I should note at this point that I can be kind of a dick when it comes to people saying stupid things, and by this point it's become physically painful trying to contain my laughter, but I was less successful at containing my sarcasm.)\n\nMe: Oh, uh, that's weird, because, in astronomy, stars are physical objects that are basically just huge 3D blobs of super-hot plasma, big enough to fit thousands of Earths inside them, not the little shapes you draw. I think the points are just there to represent the general shape of a twinkling point of light, y'know? Sirius is still a good name, though! (I was genuinely trying NOT to insult the kid's name or be rude and didn't want her to take my correction the wrong way.)\n\nKevina: Huh? That's dumb. If stars were like that, then shooting stars would be WAY bigger!\n\nMe: ... *\\*looks at Boss with an \"is she serious?\" expression on my face\\**\n\nBoss: *\\*looks at me with a look of embarrassment\\**\n\nMe: Shooting stars aren't actually stars. They're meteorites. Little chunks of rock and dust burning up as they pass through Earth's atmosphere, and only occasionally leaving behind big enough chunks to find on the ground. We get a really big one every several hundred million years or so that's a few kilometers wide and causes a lot of damage, like the one that killed the dinosaurs. But mostly they're tiny.\n\nKevina: That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard! You should get your money back from that school!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point, seemingly mistaking my incredulity for embarrassment, Kevina gets back to the whole meditation thing and the rest of the visit goes on in awkward, meditative silence. Boss never invited me to a second meditation, and I don't know if he was more embarrassed about her beliefs or my willingness to argue with her over them. I'm still flabbergasted by the fact that this woman is apparently seen as a perfectly reasonable religious leader by a guy who literally majored in astronomy and physics.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1630075546.0},{"title":"Kevin and his friends don't want to wait for their train","author":"Thatlittlewildwolf","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/pc4lji\/kevin_and_his_friends_dont_want_to_wait_for_their\/","text":"On mobile and English is not my first language, so excuse formatting issues and stupid language. Also it's gotten longer than I expected so bare with me. \n\nFor some context: I work at a train dispatcher at a station where my signal box is right in between the platforms. To make things simple I have platforms 1, 2 and 3. To get to platform 3 you need to walk over the tracks of platform 2 (platform 1 is all the was on the other side of the station and has nothing to do with the rest or this story), so you're only allowed to go there when a train arrives there, the rest of the time we have chain to block people's path and signs to tell people to stay away when the chain is closed (both as a picture and in writing) but because Kevins and entitled people above the rules exist, we need to walk out and make sure that no one runs over the tracks whenever there's a train coming in on platform 2.If we don't and someone gets killed out of their own stupidity, we face prisontime.\n\nOn to the story:\n\nIt was sometime in between lock downs and I worked the evening shift and it was already dark, around 11pm, not long until closing time. A cargo train, transporting trailers (think flat carriages with the trailers on top and some empty carriages in between) was coming closer so I set the signals that they could just drive through. This train was supposed to drive over platform 2 and it did. Shortly before the train arrived at my station I went outside to make sure, no one was on platform 3 or on the tracks.\nEnter Kevin (K) and his friends. A group of maybe five teenagers was hanging around the waiting area and came closer as they saw me leave the building (most passengers know that me walking out means a train is arriving). These boys were the only people other than me at the station, we don't see many passengers here which makes it nearly okay that we have to interact with them whenever there are questions even though that's not our job. \n\nK: Guys, come on, our train arrives!\n\nMe: Nope, actually not, yours will arrive in 10 minutes though.\n\nK: Oh, doesn't that one go to [next station]?\n\nMe: It does, but it's a cargo train.\n\nKevin looked disappointed but shrugged and walked back to his friends. The train arrived (going through the station with 60-80km\/h) and as soon as it got on the path over the tracks, I started walking back to my warm signal box.\nI had nearly reached the door as I heard Kevin loudly adressing his friends.\n\nK: I don't wanna wait, let's just take that one! Come on!\n\nI turned around, not expecting anything, it's a bunch of teenage boys who want to be cool but Kevin actually walked towards the train, his eyes fixated on an empty carriage. His friends followed but more reluctantly. Peer pressure is a b*tch. \nI started worrying but still kinda hoped he stops and has a good laugh. Nope. Kevin got faster and I was too far away to grab him (grabbing him would also come close to assault so not a good idea anyway). I couldn't stop the train in time to prevent Kevin from killing (or at least severely hurting) himself but maybe I could stop Kevin. \n\nKevin stepped on the white line that you shall not cross, especially when there's a train driving through.\n\nMe: HEY!! (I yelled that as loud as I could, while starting to come closer again. I wouldn't go to prison for that little AH)\n\nKevin and his friends hadn't realized that I was still standing outside so they got startled and jumped backwards, before turning around to me. I gave them my best death glare and the boys understood, walking back to the waiting area.\n\nI still waited outside until all 500m of the train had passed through and left my station just to make sure Kevin wouldn't have another stupid idea.\nAs their train arrived 10 minutes later, I watched them approach and enter really closely because after the stint with the cargo train I didn't trust Kevin not to try and jump in this train before it came to a stop (he actually looked like he was thinking the same thing but actually waited until the doors were open so he could enter).","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1629999948.0},{"title":"Kevin In A Deli (Part 2 of 2)","author":"Hammer_Unto_Dawn","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/pc3bnk\/kevin_in_a_deli_part_2_of_2\/","text":"Hurray!

Kevin and Female Coworker decide to try and weaponize the health department against the deli, swearing up and down that there was black mold. Kevin was so sure of this \u201cblack mold\u201d that he even involved the health department. One store-management-panicked health visit later, the health department deemed the \u201cblack mold\u201d to be\u2026black tile grout\n\nStill hungry for the main course? Good. When I was helping train Kevin, especially in closing duties, i stated that there are certain \u201cshortcuts\u201d that one could take\u2014such as using the little shop vacuum for debris for cleaning the meat slicers and fryer resting station. I regret that phraseology. Aside from the fryer and slicers, the deli had the hot bar where you have the essentials and then the rotisserie oven. Every night, the grease trap underneath that had to be dumped. Instead of dumping like how it\u2019s supposed to be dumped, he has an idea for a shortcut. A bad idea. Savvy readers will have guessed correctly that he used the shop vac to empty the grease trap. No, he did not clean it after and it sat for days. The rest of us all had the same idea: \u201cI wasn\u2019t the one who had such a boneheaded idea, I\u2019m *not* gonna pick up the responsibility\u201d\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! This is r\/StoriesAboutKevin, after all. A few days later after the Grease Trap Vacuuming, the department manager told him to take the vac and vacuum out the cold case slider thresholds. \u201cWell, I won\u2019t do that because the vacuum stinks and it will drive down sales!\u201d *Record scratch* _did Kevin really say that?_ yes. Yes he did. The department manager, being 100% done with him the moment he was hired, disengaged. Perhaps out of sheer confusion and frustration.\n\nNow, dear Redditors, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve smelled days old chicken grease that\u2019s been sitting at room temperature; but it is the most convincing argument for vegetarianism I\u2019ve ever come across. I\u2019d like to say I have an iron stomach, but that was the closest I\u2019ve come to vomiting from sheer odor. It was clear that Kevin, in his infinite pig headedness, wasn\u2019t going to clean it. Likely because of the odor.\n\n\n\nSo, what ever came of Kevin? Shortly after this, a wholesaler owned by the same company opened up in a new development of the town. Kevin was among the first wave to transfer out there, much to our delight. Later, we met someone who worked at the same branch and same department he transferred to. She said that Kevin didn\u2019t change much, focusing more on sabotage; he was still trying to pin health code violations on them, and was too daft to plant them. Kevin and his previously mentioned \u201cfriend\u201d remained together, until she wisened up and metaphorically defenestrated him.

But the Kevin I\u2019m about to tell you about was definitely the dumbest coworker I\u2019ve ever worked with. Here are a few of his most memorable moments.\n\n- I\u2019m normally a third shift grocery worker, but the frozen lead was on vacation for the week and asked me to fill in for him while he was gone. While I was working, Kevin came up to me and asked me, \u201cyou doing frozen now?\u201d Me, being a smart ass, said, \u201cnope I\u2019m doing drug GM.\u201d He just looked at me confused and replied, \u201chuh?\u201d I basically had to explain to Kevin that I was making a joke. Even after explaining it to him he still didn\u2019t fully get it.\n\n- Kevin was 45 at the time. He would often use midwestern or southern words (ope, y\u2019all, reckon). But I will never forget his use of the word \u201cgots.\u201d I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t know a single person over the age of 8 that uses the word \u201cgots\u201d. He uses it very often and it blows my mind every time.\n\n- Kevin started off as a cashier\/bagger. But he was so poor at both of his jobs he was reassigned to janitor. His biggest problem was that he would often drop what he was doing to talk to employees or customers. To give him credit, he is a nice guy but never was aware of his surroundings. On a random day when I was getting my groceries there, the cashier was checking me out while Kevin was right next to her talking her ear off. Finally she snapped and yelled, \u201cGO ON YOUR BREAK, KEVIN!!!\u201d He complied but he never fully understood why he was yelled at that way.\n\n- Kevin also didn\u2019t drive. The only vehicle he ever used was a bicycle and his wife would never let him use it. I don\u2019t know what the circumstances were for that, but that is just sad when you\u2019re that age and not allowed to ride a bike.\n\n- Kevin\u2019s wife is also 10 years younger than him and they have two little kids together (they\u2019re doomed). On a random day, he and his wife were in the store shopping and they put on a show. Kevin was over looking for a cart at the corral and his wife was in line at customer service. The corral and the service desk are about 20 feet apart from each other but that didn\u2019t stop Kevin and Kevina from screaming at each other from both ends. They were told multiple times to knock it off but they just kept arguing. It eventually led to the manager stepping in and threatening to throw them out if they didn\u2019t stop. Once again, Kevin complied but didn\u2019t fully understand what the problem was.\n\n- as I stated above, Kevin was still a genuinely nice guy but was strictly tolerated by most people in the store. One of my other coworkers would straight up insult him, ridicule him and roast him right to his face. Kevin would always laugh and say that that\u2019s what buddies do. Kevin had no idea that this coworker was being serious. Kevin also had it in his head that he was going to join us on third shift. My supervisor firmly said no and stated that Kevin would be found in a pool of his own blood by the following morning.\n\n- Kevin would also regularly take huge dumps in the bathroom and never flushed. His regular diet of Taco Bell and fruit snacks didn\u2019t help either. He was asked multiple times by management to please flush but he never would for some reason. We knew it was him because he would always probably state that he didn\u2019t flush.\n\n- Kevin eventually had to move back to Kansas to his old hometown but on his last day he wanted to take selfie\u2018s with several coworkers. Many complied just to be polite but Then he tried to hug and even kiss a few of the female coworkers. He was firmly told no and, you guessed it, had no idea why. Kevin is still in Kansas as far as we know and we haven\u2019t heard from him since.\n\nThat\u2019s about all the stories I have about Kevin.

I am very thankful for the criticism from my last post (due to my illiteracy). It helps a lot so I hopefully learn how to type better like learning the difference between Except and Accept. And among the comments I get are also questions. I will happily answer them before we get into the story.\n\nFirst one is \"Why didn't the cleaning agency pick out this pattern of events when my mother took over Karvina's jobs?\" Well like most businesses, they mostly rely on computers and it is the computers job to calculate who gets which job. My mother has a fairly high star rating while Karvina has an average 2 stars. Since mum (No matter how sick or injured) will go to work, do her job properly and go home. So the computer calculated this and almost always my mum gets Karvina\u2019s job.\n\nSecondly, \"Why didn't the old folks complain to the agency about Karvina's actions?\" Well, old people are usually more polite to complain and it is a problem. There is even a list of elderly homes being under investigation for reports of maggots in elder's wounds and sexual assault. With my mum being polite and Kenny (The old man from the previous story) had enough of Karvina, he knows he picked the right cleaner. R.I.P for Kenny as he recently passed and some of his last words was to say to my mother \"Thank you\"\n\nLastly is \"Isn't my aunt going deaf?\" I can confirm that she isn't going deaf. She can hear fine, but she likes getting people listening to her so she can be the centre of attention. Trust me, this story shows she does listen but doesn't do what she was told.\n\nNow onto the story with an added character\n\nOP. Me also known as Easter. I am disabled and don\u2019t mind any criticism. I obviously live with my parents, but I am used to it. Due to the lockdown, they definitely need me.\n\nMy mother. She is our Mount Vesuvius. She is calm at some moments, and yet erupts if there\u2019s a problem. She is also caring and can put her ego aside to help people.\n\nMy father. He is tougher than you expect an older man should be. He had years of living on the streets from the age of 14 because he ran away from his abusive household and managed to build himself up by finding work. Nowadays he\u2019s a handy man and helps my mum with cleaning sometimes.\n\nThen lastly, my aunt Karvina. No relation. The type of woman you want to vote off the island first after spending an hour with her. She has an inflated ego, but is kind and generous when needed. \n\nIt was before the dreaded plague and we are always too tired to cook anything since my parents work and I was going to TAFE. So we often cook up some minute meals or take out. Then my aunt Karvina decided to make us some food. It is nice for her to do it, but it turned out her cooking nearly killed my dad. She made mushroom stew one time and I can tell by smelling it, something was off. My dad has Diabetes and he can\u2019t have certain foods due to his medication. One of those ingredients is garlic. And guess what she put in her food? A lot of it.  Mind you, he at least knows how to cook food without poisoning anyone. So my dad, being the best cook in the house, gave her some piece of advice.\n\nDad: To cook something, you don\u2019t need to add so much garlic. Besides, I am not allowed a lot of it because of my medication.\n\nAunt Karvina: But the recipe requires it. If there\u2019s less, it might ruin it. \n\nDad: What was the recipe?\n\nAunt Karvina: It\u2019s online and it specifically said 2 tablespoons of garlic.\n\nDad: You can add less. Less is more.\n\nAunt Karvina: But it might ruin it.\n\nI searched for the recipe for mushroom stew online while they chat and using my inner Kevina brain, found the first result and checked it out. I read it carefully to be sure and\u2026\n\nMe: Ahh, you said it requires 2 tablespoons, right?\n\nAunt Karvina: Yeah\n\nMe: It said 2 TEASPOONS, not tablespoons\n\nShe took a look at it and shrugged it off while saying \u201cYou\u2019re not the chef.\u201d \n\nMe: I have a Cert II in Home Economics and even I know you don\u2019t add half a jar of spices and-\n\nAunt Karvina: Whatever, just try it. \n\nYou can see visible steam coming out of my father\u2019s ears when she cut me off. She even proceeded to give my dad a bowl of this death stew before we, including my mum, gave her a crowded death stare. That many stares on one person is enough to kill you more than the witch's poison in dad\u2019s hands. We decided to give it to the dogs and went to get KFC. \n\nEdit: Sorry for scaring you guys about giving the dogs that much garlic and your right. We shouldn't have done that\n\nYou think after that, she at least learns from her mistakes. NOPE, she even cooks most of her food in water. I don\u2019t mean rice or eggs, I am talking about a perfect pork roast, succulent lamb and roast beef. I can understand it can save on cleaning dishes and using that method for stews (and that can work), but you don\u2019t add a cold roast on a deep pan, add water and not have it seasoned. My dad once again gave her cooking advice. \n\nDad: Why does the pork look like it\u2019s been through the gates of hell and back?\n\nAunt Karvina: I don\u2019t know, I followed the recipe carefully this time.\n\nDad: How long did you have it in for?\n\nAunt Karvina: For about 2 hours. I even checked the clock.\n\nIt later turned out that her clock was broken and she left the roast in for 5 hours. She didn\u2019t realise this because she was getting the tin asparagus, carrots and brussel sprouts ready for the dreadful looking meatloaf. To be honest, I was hearing \u201cLife Is A Lemon And I Want My Money Back\u201d by Meatloaf ringing in the distance. We ate that meatloaf and we got food poisoning.\n\nShe repeats this ongoing cycle of bad cooking and we later give up on her. She is a waste of brain cells at this point. She still is to this day cooking bad food for us, but we have a secret. As I am now out of TAFE and mainly spend my time at home, doing chores and among other things, I decided to do the cooking so my parents don\u2019t get sick like last time. As for the food, we normally give it to the dogs.\n\nBy the off chance we invite her to dinner, she will often get excited when either dad and I cook. I guess she hates her own cooking as well. I don\u2019t know. All I know is this is the end of the terrible cook.

I would like to see Rob of Karma Comment Chameleon pick this up, honestly. \n\nFirst, a little bit of background on Kevin. Kevin and I went to middle school together (little after the Xbox 360 released but was still red ringing) and were acquainted from that. It was about 7, 8 years since then (circa Nintendo switch release).  I _hated_ my middle school self so I wasn\u2019t so keen on identifying myself. Kevin, on the interim, somehow managed to become a sailor with the US Navy. I don\u2019t think he got up the ranking ladder, like at all.\nKevin was proud of his service, but not in the way you may think. He didn\u2019t share about his time serving, but he had that \u201cproud veteran\u201d thing under his name badge. His proudest moment? He bragged about pulling a knife on his \u201cfriend\u201d and spending time in the brig. He wore this like some sort of badge of honor, like someone spending a night in the drunk tank and claiming that they \u201cspent time behind bars with the real thugs and gangstas\u201d\n\nIt seemed like the military didn\u2019t teach him a damn thing about discipline or work ethic. When he hired on and finished his training, he had a serious problem keeping focused and preferred to stand around and socialize. It never crossed his mind to pull out a salad or sandwich kit to maintain productivity (something that really ground the department manager\u2019s gears). Then he took a liking to another deli employee. What little shred of productivity he did have, evaporated like a puddle of water in the Arizona sun. Him and the female coworker would stand behind the counter for hours and just shoot the shit just like it was a punch bowl social that they were getting paid to attend. At one point, they decided to sneak off for her first break and his last break. They were gone for HOURS and both came back extremely sweaty and breathing hard. The other deli employee realized what had happened, he went home out of pure shock and disgust.\n\nOur story ends here, dear fellow Redditor. But fear not, because Pt.

I flew with him for two years when he was a copilot, almost a year with him as a pilot in command.  I knew him for a year after his wings were clipped when he was a receptionist until he left the org.  He did improve so much as a pilot over three years that it got down to just once a flight did I think he would kill me.  As if that wasn't enough, I had to deal with Boss Baby who was persecuting any good aviators and forcing us to keep flying with Manbaby.\n\nOnce, Manbaby was the pilot flying on an instrument approach into an airport when we got a call from ATC.  \"(Callsign), Approach, I have a Navy bird at your twelve o'clock, five miles, co-altitude.  I need you to do a left three sixty in place for spacing.\"\n\nManbaby: ... ...\n\nMe:  \"They're calling you.  You need to do something.\"\n\nATC:  \"(Callsign), Navy bird twelve o'clock, now three miles, I need you to do the left three sixty now.\"\n\nManbaby:  ... ...\n\nMe:  \"They're calling you.  You need to turn now.\"\n\nManbaby:  ... ...  (happily flying towards the Navy bird)\n\nMe:  \"I have the flight controls.  Approach, left three sixty in place now!\"\n\nATC:  \\*big sigh\\*  Thank you.\n\nMe:  \"Manbaby, didn't you hear that call?  What were you thinking?\"\n\nManbaby:  \"Oh...oh?  Oh, da call?  Da call?  Oh...da call.\"\n\nI just flew tonight with a guy who was Manbaby's main copilot.  He gave me this gem.  Copilot was the pilot flying and Manbaby was the pilot monitoring for a night landing at a small, very dimly lit airport.  Crossing the threshold of the runway, copilot is frantically searching for the runway.\n\nCP:  \"Manbaby, I can't see the runway.  Where's the runway?\"\n\nManbaby:  \"Oh...oh?  Oh, da runway?\"\n\nCP:  \"I can't see the runway!\"\n\nManbaby:  \"Oh...oh?  Oh...I forgot to turn on the lights.\"  \\*click\\*\n\nPoof, there's the runway.\n\nAbout every third landing he would want to land on the wrong runway.  Our main airport has two sets of parallel runways.  One example:\n\nTower:  \"(Callsign), winds 060 at 12, cleared to land, Runway Four Left.\"\n\nManbaby:  \"(Callsign), clear to land Four leff.\"  \\*Lines up for 4 R\\*\n\nMe:  \"Manbaby, what are you doing?  They told you Four Left!\"\n\nTower:  \"(Callsign), what are you doing?  There's a jet coming in right behind you for Four Right!\"\n\nMe:  \"I have the flight controls!\"\n\nAnd he would frequently tell me to land on the wrong runway or level at the wrong altitude.\n\nSo, I called people from his previous office to get the scoop and he was utterly worthless, but it was a case of pass the poop sandwich.  I do wish I had known all of that beforehand though.  One guy told me that Manbaby had to do an orientation for a new hire and he was asked by the supervisor to go along with Manbaby.  Manbaby mixed up the files and told the new hire that he was fired and the guy freaked out and the other guy had to save the meeting.  The supervisor then told the other guy to do all of the reports and orientation, but to give Manbaby the credit.  \n\nI don't know it for a fact, but I'm pretty sure it was that supervisor who pulled strings to get Manbaby the flying position.\n\nAnd one final Manbaby reception story:\n\nManbaby was tasked to deliver a package to a high level VIP and to fill out forms that went with it.  Manbaby arrives in the neighborhood and he's forgotten the package and forms, but what the hey, just press on right.  Manbaby knocks on the door and there's no answer.  It's a safe, gated community, so the door is unlocked.  Manbaby just walks on in.  He wanders around for a bit before two women see him and start screaming.\n\nMother and daughter:  \"Ahhhhh, get out, who are you?  Get out!\"\n\nManbaby:  \"Oh...oh...I have to deliver a package.\"\n\nM & D:  \"What?  To who?\"\n\nManbaby:  \"Oh?  Oh...oh?  Oh, da package?  Ummm, I don't know.\"\n\nM&D:  (Starting to think they know what this is about)  \"Well, where's the package?\"\n\nManbaby:  \"Oh?  Da package?  Oh...oh, da package...da package.  Ummm, I don't know.\"\n\nI heard the story from a third party and so I went to the daughter, who works admin in our office.\n\nMe:  \"Hey, D, I have something I need you to confirm for me.\"\n\nD:  \"Sure, OP, what's up.\"\n\nMe:  \"Manbaby.\"\n\nD:  \\*audible growl\\*\n\nMe:  \"Ohhhh, must be true!\"\n\nThe best part was that Boss Baby had the ever loving stuffing beaten out of him professionally because he assigned Manbaby the task.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1629272234.0},{"title":"Kevina is unable to describe the difference between a cow and a chicken","author":"Sweet_CeilingCat","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/p6dwt6\/kevina_is_unable_to_describe_the_difference\/","text":"I used to know a young girl, approaching her teens who was considered \"troubled\". This budding teen was bound and determined to experience all life had to offer, though it was not to partake in the cultural arts or intellectual stimuli that was abundantly available to her; she'd have none of that. She preferred a more dramatic life (much to her family's chagrin), something more likely to be made into a dramatic TV mini-series or an after-school special.\n\nPart of Kevina's grand plan included assisting the local crack cocaine dealer with weighing and packaging his \"goods\". This after school activity would in some ways indicate that Kevina had some basic intellectual capacity. I was wrong. I learned just how wrong I was the day I was asked to take Kevina to see a psychologist to have a battery of tests run to determine where she was cognitively\/intellectually. In other words - and IQ test. \n\nAs a \"reward\" for not cursing out the test-giver and not hitting kicking, or biting anyone, I took Kevina to get some ice cream. On the way, I asked her about the test and how she felt like she did. Kevina was certain she \"made an A\" and said it was easy - \"well, except for when the lady asked if I could tell her what the difference was between a chicken and a cow\". I waited for her to go on, but since she just left that oddity hang in the air, I prompted her - \"so how did you describe the differences?\"\n\nKevina turned and looked at me and shrugged her shoulders - I asked her \"do you know the difference between chickens and cows?\" - Kevina said \"not really\".\n\nOk. I began to ask her how many legs a cow has and how many a chicken has. I asked if both had wings. You know - basics. I didn't want to confuse her with mammals vs birds just yet. Kevina was unable to answer these questions. \n\nThat night I thought back to how I learned about animals - besides seeing real animals, I was read to and learned to read AND I had a \"See and Say\" - you know the toy that you pull a string, the arrow spins and points to an animal and goes \"The cow says moooo\"!

His problem was listed as \"FBIP\" which a nurse explained meant \"Foreign Body In Penis.\" I found a middle-aged, slightly disheveled hippie lying on the bed looking dazed. His girlfriend was standing silently behind him. His story was as interesting as I'd expected.\n\nSeveral days previously he was smoking marijuana while his girlfriend was out of town, and he decided to see what would happen if he snaked a three-foot length of aquarium tubing into his penis. When 6 inches still protruded, he tried to pull it out -- but it was stuck!\n\nThis predicament apparently didn't teach him a complete lesson. He then threaded some Weedwacker wire through the center of the tubing, which also became stuck. He decided to sleep on it and hope for the best.\n\nThe next day, it was still stuck. He tried to go about his day as usual, hoping it would just fall out on its own, but had trouble doing his gardening with tubing hanging out of his penis. So he cut the tubing flush with his skin. Another day went by.\n\nHe finally realized that the foreign objects were impeding the flow of urine, and despite his embarrassment he needed to go to the Emergency Room.\n\nWe tugged and pulled on what little we could grab of the tubing, and he wasn't kidding when he said it was stuck. X-rays showed the tubing and Weedwacker wire kinked and knotted in his bladder. A urologist took the man to surgery and, using a scope forced through the already-crowded urethra, managed to cut the knot and pull out the tubing.\n\nNeedless to say, that is one stoned experiment the hippie will not try again.\n\n(Note: Since he was probably able to get the tubing into his penis without it hurting him, there is reason to believe that he had probably done this sort of thing many times before.)","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1629247002.0},{"title":"Kevin thinks that VTubers are real entities.","author":"CookieDog800","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/p59krk\/kevin_thinks_that_vtubers_are_real_entities\/","text":"Mandatory disclaimer, I\u2019m on my phone\u2026\n\nAlso, Disclaimer about this SubReddit, please leave all brain cells, logic, and your shoes at the door before entering the world of Kevin\n\nOne more thing, this is more of a rant to take the weight off my chest, so sorry if I speak rudely.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t understand the title, I have a Kevin who thinks that VTubers like Snuffy on Twitch, is a real life raccoon girl.

I felt my soul die, my brain go off to hang itself, and my faith in public schools go belly up\u2026\n\nI shut off my computer with Ctrl+Alt+Delete and walked away. For the next hour he started in on how I could keep the girls to myself and how selfish I am\u2026 \n\nMe fed up with his crap: If you want to go see them, you should get a job and get at least $50,000 to pay for the trip and a hotel for when they do meet you.\n\nHonestly I was expecting him to ask me to call them and see if they\u2019re were available. No, this guy went job hunting and texted me, thanking me for giving him a reason to get a job. His parents called me later that week to also thank me.\n\nI felt bad that I used fictional CGI raccoon girls and whatever Taiga is to trick him, but him getting a job and getting an honest pay to see them made me feel even worse\u2026\n\nThen a week later he came back and asked me if I could hook him up. I no longer felt any guilt.\n\nMe giving up on this idiot in front of me: No, they just announced that they were dating someone.\n\nBK: Oh, damn I wanted to feel what fur in bed was like.\n\nBack to VTuber avatars being real entities walking down the street. My brain just threw in the towel and peaced out\u2026\n\nI just went inside and told every mutual friend that he was hopeless. He still bugs me about it. Dammit BK take a freaking hint!!!\n\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the response, though the first Kevin I mentioned was the good Kevin. BK (Bad Kevin) is just a brain dead friend\/lunatic who lives near me and is the subject of this story.\n\nBut here\u2019s where things get interesting. About a week after this story took place, he found what VRchat is. Here\u2019s yesterday\u2019s debacle\u2026\n\nBK: Hey I heard that VR has a Skype!\n\nIn all fairness, VRchat is kinda like Skype, so I\u2019ll let that one slide.\n\nMe: Yeah, so? \n\nBK: Could I use it to call them?\n\nMe: Christ almighty! Take a hint BK!!! They are already dating people, live hundreds of miles away, and are NOT REAL!!!\n\nHe looked like I told him Santa wasn\u2019t real\u2026\n\nBK: Wha?\n\nMe: It\u2019s just CGI avatars, it\u2019s a costume made by a computer!\n\nBK in his most glorious moment: They can bend air?\n\nWhen I said avatar, he thought The Last Airbender\u2026 I want to save any last bit of brain cells and get him out.\n\nMe: No, that\u2019s just a cartoon, NOT real. These VTubers are people in costumes, NOT real. You have no brain that exists, REAL.\n\nBK: I thought that girls like a buff guy, not someone with brains.\n\nMe: If that was true, you would need a personal security team to keep all the girls off of you, but it\u2019s not. Girls don\u2019t want some brain dead git causing them trouble and embarrassing them.\n\nBK looked like I just told him the winning lottery numbers.\n\nBK: So all I need to do is get a security team and girls will want me?\n\nAt this point I was done with him, I called my dog who promptly came over. Now I\u2019ll give BK some points for IQ when he saw my dog and bolted. My dog is a pit bull, cattle dog mix. She\u2019s a big girl, a nice 127 pound 5-year old who acts like a puppy and has never hurt a human or other dog in her life. She\u2019s a teddy bear, looks scary, but is sweet as pie. BK saw Big Doggy and ran, she looked at me and gave me a look that basically said, WTF just happened? She got a treat and extra head pats. Also, she\u2019s taller than a 6 foot person on her hind legs. \n\nIf anything happens more with BK, I\u2019ll post. He\u2019s a danger to everyone and himself\u2026\n\nUpdate\/Edit 2: \n\nHe saw that I wrote this on Reddit. This was the phone call I got\u2026 End my suffering from his stupidity\u2026\n\nBK: Hey I found the story on RedBot.\n\nMe: What?\n\nBK: RedBot, you know, where people talk about parents?\n\nMe: You mean Reddit?\n\nBK: RedBot. It\u2019s RedBot!\n\nI wasn\u2019t wanting to get into it with him again\u2026\n\nMe: Ok, so you found the story, why did you call?\n\nBK: Now the VTubers can see me and will want to get to know me!\n\nHe said this like he was a genius who discovered something incredible. His ego was inflating by the second\u2026\n\nMe: Not likely, they don\u2019t like crazy simps like you.\n\nBK: What\u2019s a simp? And don\u2019t girls like crazy guys?\n\nI put the phone on mute, went to the freezer, grabbed an ice pack and put it on my forehead. I wanted to try and calm down. This guys makes calm go out the damn window.\n\nMe back on the phone: They don\u2019t want crazy, the only girl I know who wants crazy is the neighbor down the street!\n\nBK: So the neighbor is Snuffy and Taiga?!?\n\nI realized that I just escalated this far more than it needs to be. With every bit of my brain killings itself off to be on his level I said.\n\nMe: The neighbor down the street is dating someone, and Raccoon Girls, Mouse Girls, any kind of VTuber girl is gonna stay with the one they\u2019re dating, because the animal that they are stays with their mate\u2026\n\nBK: So they have a permanent date!\n\n*Angels singing Hallelujah! Balance restored in the Force! My brain performing necromancy on itself!*\n\nMe: Yes!\n\nBK: Ok, so does that me-\n\nI hung up, blocked him, blocked his family, blocked him on EVERY SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT I HAVE!!! I then locked the door, turned on Netflix and watched DeathNote for the second time.\n\nIf he sees this post update, Take a f******g hint you dumb**s! They are not real! They are computers! I WON\u2019t TAKE ANY MORE OF YOUR CRAP KEVIN!!! IF YOU CALL ME OR COME NEAR ME, I\u2019M CALLING THE POLICE!!! YOU STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM ME!!!\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nEdit 3: He saw this ending part\u2026 His answer was through another phone call from someone else\u2019s phone. His mother let him use the phone after he begged her to call me for a hook up\u2026 BK, but you need to stop.\n\nBK: Why can\u2019t you let me meet them?\n\nI was done with him and his antics.\n\nMe in an Australian accent: Sorry mate, I don\u2019t reckon I know who ya mean. \n\nBK: Oh, sorry wrong number\u2026\n\nHe hung up. Then called again\n\nBK: Dude, tell me where-\n\nMe now in French (thanks French teacher in high-school): Bonjour monsieur, que puis-je faire pour vous? \n\nThat translates to: Good afternoon sir, what can I do for you?\n\nBK: SPEAK ENGLISH THIS IS AN AMERICAN PHONE!!!\n\nI internally groaned\u2026\n\nMe: J\u2019ai peur de ne pas comprendre, qu\u2019es-\n\nHe hung up. I tried to say: I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t understand, what are you telling about?\n\nHe didn\u2019t call back, he came to the door to see if I was home while.\n\nBK: COOOOOKKIIEEEEE!!!!!! THE NAZI\u2019S HAVE STOLEN YOU NUMBER!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI swear I\u2019m done with his BS. I just called the cops saying that some crazy person was screaming about Nazi\u2019s at my front door and wouldn\u2019t go away. He kept knocking\u2026\n\nMe using a fake voice (I can mimic a voice, like Kermit, and Arnold Schwarzenegger): I don\u2019t know who you are but you better leave!\n\nBK: Sniffy is that you? Or is it Tundra? \n\nSniffy = Snuffy\nTundra = Taiga\n\nKevins everyone\u2026 \n\nI just waited and watched the cops pull him away from my door he was screaming the whole time about his friend not setting him up with dates and how the Nazi\u2019s stole his phone number. One cop came to the door, I knew who she was, having a cop as a family friend can be useful at times. \n\nFFC (Family Friend Cop): Cookie, what the hell happened?\n\nI just shared the post with her\u2026\n\nFFC: Why am I not surprised?\n\nThey took BK away and he\u2019s not allowed within 100 feet of me. Not allowed to call, text, or follow me on social media. His parents were not angry at me, they were just apologetic AF, and I couldn\u2019t blame them, they tried for 19 years to help that moron. They told me that they won\u2019t let him near me, and they\u2019ll send him to his uncle\u2019s farm in Texas so I don\u2019t have to deal with him. Sometime in the next 3 days, he\u2019s gonna be in Texas. No more BK.\n\nIf y\u2019all want more stories, just let me know!\n\nGo Texas, God help you with that dumbass\u2026\n\nEdit #4: He called me from Texas\u2026\n\nKILL ME NOW LORD!!! \n\nThis brain dead git had decided to call me earlier today, he called and here\u2019s the convo\u2026 roughly, I kinda zoned out and ignored him after a bit\u2026\n\nBK: Hey OP, did you get your phone back from the Nazi\u2019s?\n\nMe internally groaning: Yes, and I\u2019m busy getting ready for work what do you want?\n\nBK: Is there a way to call Tundra or Snoffy here in Texas?\n\nMe finally snapping: NO THERE\u2019S NOT YOU BRAIN DEAD F===!!! JESUS F=====G CHRIST, LEAVE ME ALONE!!!!!!! YOU WILL NEVER CALL ME AGAIN!!! \n\nBK: But I want to get a date man, it\u2019s been a while and I\u2019ve worked up\u2026\u2026.\n\nI tuned him out and continued getting ready for work. I went over my mental checklist for work:\n\n1. Badge, Check\n2. Bag, Check\n3. Lunch, Check\n4. Water Bottle, Check\n5. Uniform (it\u2019s more of a safety vest), Check\n6. Earbuds, Check\n7. Schedule, Check\n8. Car Keys, Check\n9. Face Mask, Check\n10. Phone, where is my phone\u2026\n\nI went to my desk and saw that BK was still on the line trying to guilt me about not having a date with VTubers\u2026 I spent 26 minutes getting ready and this dumb==s was talking the whole time. I picked up the phone, and hung up on him when he talked about how amazing of a guy he is\u2026 I blocked any number that is associated with him, programmed my spam filter for ANY calls and texts from Texas.

This tech was hired at least 6 months after I. Kevina had the caring nature roughly the equivalent of sand paper. Kevina also didn\u2019t understand or care about HIPAA. Certain things don\u2019t necessarily fall under it, but it\u2019s on a need-to-know basis. I recognize one of our regular patients and greet her as Ms. [last name]. I make a soft quip to Kevina in passing how she\u2019s a regular. Kevina, at full volume, responds with \u201coh, like [firstname lastname].\u201d Regular patient doesn\u2019t need to know who else fills with us. If we wouldn\u2019t talk about Johnny Depp (for example) filling with us, why should Joe The Plumber be any different?\n\nNot many techs *LIKED* the drive-thru. Kevina was no exception to this. But she had a tendency to bellyache about everything. Her claim to fame was how our city\u2019s demographics were (and I quote) \u201cassholes\u201d. Most of our patients aren\u2019t entitled and a majority are either silent generation\/boomers, or young Gen X\/older millennial family units.

She retired a year after I graduated so there's no more strange stories about her around the school.\n\nFor a soft start, Kevina never understood personal space. She would come uncomfortably close while talking to someone. If you stepped back, she'd follow no matter if you were a student, parent or teacher. She actually scared my mum away with that behavior alone.\nBut that wouldn't make her a Kevina.\n\nBut these two anecdotes do:\n\nOne day Kevina came to school with a huge cast on her arm. We had hoped for a singing lesson so we wouldn't actually do something but as she couldn't play the piano with the cast we changed tactics, knowing that she tends to talk a lot when asked.\n\"OMG Mrs Kevina, what happened?\"\nShe then started to tell us that she was mowing her lawn and something got stuck in the mower. Kevina decided to pull out whatever it was and reached between the blades - while they were still running! It's like a miracle that she didn't lose a finger that day. We all were shocked and told her, she was lucky that her arm would recover fully.\nKevina didn't share more details but let us listen to a CD instead of actually teaching. I believe it was Mozart but I can't remember correctly.\n\n\nAnother time we came to her lesson with Kevina nowhere to be found. The class she should've taught before us told us that she never showed up and that neither the other teachers nor the school's secretary knew where she was - she didn't call in but had missed out on three lessons at that point.\nWe kinda hoped that she wouldn't show up for our lesson as well and it seemed like we would be lucky - until Kevina showed up, half an hour in the lesson.\nAgain, we didn't want to learn and were honestly curious so we asked why she came that late and if she was okay. And again she told us:\nFor whatever reason Kevina couldn't open her front door as she wanted to leave. She was sure someone had stuck dirt in the lock so she couldn't unlock the door. She never thought about calling in, getting help or whatever but instead stood in front of her front door for three hours, trying to get out.\nIf you read attentive you may have realized that I talked about a front door, implying there's a back door. And there actually is one.\nIT TOOK KEVINA THREE HOURS TO REMEMBER HER BACK DOOR SO SHE COULD LEAVE THE HOUSE!\nAt this point I need to say that Kevina always had a trolley with her since a handbag or a backpack would be way too easy choices and for whatever reason she couldn't just carry the trolley like a handbag. But since the area around her back door wasn't even enough for the trolley she needed to walk around the house open the front door (which was magically possible from the outside) to get her trolley out.\nProps to her though, she didn't lock herself in again.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1628778284.0},{"title":"Kevin calls the pharmacy","author":"genetixJ","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/p268mt\/kevin_calls_the_pharmacy\/","text":"Not sure if this belongs here as I recently found this sub, but here it goes:\n\nI work in a pharmacy chain. If you ever want to know why your meds took so long to fill it\u2019s because I just spent 20 minutes talking to Kevin\u2026. On my 3rd day on the job I get a call from Kevin\u2026 Kevin is very upset, it seems he \u2018almost\u2019 put his arthritis gel for his hand up his rectum and he\u2019s very concerned. \n\nKevin: How can a major chain run a pharmacy and not know how to put warning labels on medications. I almost put my arthritis gel up my rectum! I just had rectal surgery and I filled my pain meds at your pharmacy. When I picked them up <cue sarcastic voice> \u201cthe cute girl at the register gave me my meds packaged in a bag with a fake smile. How was I supposed to know it wasn\u2019t supposed to go in my rectum?\u201d\n\nA medication mix-up is a major thing. Arthritis gel isn\u2019t used after surgery. So I need more details. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that (and I was- I\u2019ve spent a great deal of my professional life looking at errors and trying to fix them in an error-prone system). \u201cWhat medication was it? It has recently been available without a Rx, did you ask for it or have you had it before?\u201d\nKevin: \u201cYes I\u2019ve had it before, I got 3 big tubes of it for my hands two months ago, its how I knew it was arthritis gel!! Does nobody there check the meds before they go out?\u201d\n\nMe, now thinking this is a setup\u2026 \u201cYes, I see that you did get three tubes, and that was a one month supply. Did your surgeon tell you it was also for rectal use?\u201d\n\nKevin: \u201che didn\u2019t need to tell me that! Why did you give it to me? It burned so much around my incisions that I called the surgeon\u201d\n\nSo now we\u2019ve established that Kevin did indeed shove his arthritis meds up his rectum, yet more juicy details are needed for a report.\n\nMe: \u201cOK sir, I see that you did get your post-surgery pain meds from us last week along with more arthritis gel. I\u2019m not seeing the link that led you to use it rectally\u201d. By now I was enjoying the conversation and using the term rectally loudly. Kevin was on the phone, so there was no concern about violating his privacy or embarrassing him. \n\nKevin: \u201cI was getting my pain meds for my surgery. You should have told me they\u2019re not for rectal use\u201d.\n\nMe: \u201cI\u2019m looking at the label that was attached to each box and tube of the rectal gel. The directions are quite clear, stating \u201capply to hands up to 4 times a day\u201d. At this point Kevin was getting annoyed I wasn\u2019t understanding things.\n\nKevin: \u201cWell I didn\u2019t see it. When someone gets surgery meds they aren\u2019t expecting arthritis meds\u201d. Hmm\u2026 fair enough I think. But we fill prescriptions for people for multiple maladies very frequently. \n\nMe: \u201cOK Kevin, now, how are you taking your pain pills for your rectum?\u201d\nKevin: \u201cI swallow them, do you think I\u2019m some kind of moron?\u201d Ahh\u2026 Kevin has laid down the gauntlet.\nMe: \u201cwell Kevin, tablets and capsules can be taken by any orifice. \u201c\nKevin: \u201cit saws on the bottle to take a tablet BY MOUTH every 6 hours for pain. Jesus you must be dense. Is there a manager I can speak with?\u201d Oh, now he\u2019s gone Karen on me. \n\nMe: \u201cI am in charge of the pharmacy today. Now, let me get this straight so I know I have all the details. You put your arthritis gel up your rectum. This is a gel you\u2019ve previously gotten before. And your pain medication you took by mouth, and you\u2019ve never had this before. You read the directions for the pills but not the gel\u201d.\n\nKevin: \u201cyes that\u2019s exactly the problem! You should have told me not to shove it in my rectum.\u201d\nMe: \u201cI can understand your dilemma. However, you receive medicaid. Federal laws dictate that we must counsel you on each and every fill. I can see your signature from where you signed stated you received counseling- both times in fact from getting your arthritis meds. I\u2019m not seeing the issue here. They were clearly labeled, you\u2019 ve had the medication before, and you indicated you haven\u2019t read it. What do you want me to do?!?\u201d\n\nAt this point Kevin seem resigned that he was not gettting through to me. \u201cI\u2019m going to call the surgeon and talk to him. We\u2019ll see about getting a lawyer- you\u2019ve been negligent\u201d. With that Kevin slams the phone down. Who still has a land line anyway?\n\nWell, I better document this. I send patient care notes to his  surgeon and arthritis doc stating the problem, puttting a hand gel up his rectum, and not following directions (Or common sense). In case he does more Kevin \u2018things\u2019 with the  doctors- best to have a continuity of care and understanding his kevin antics.\n\nAfter closing I see a tired lady in scrubs looking at an endcap filled with junk. I ask if I can help-she\u2019s also in healthcare and just looks drained from dealing with the burden of humanity. Turns out she\u2019s a nurse with the surgeon and she had received my care note but wanted to find out more. She also informs me the rectal surgery was to fix damage from objects Kevin had inserted to relieve constipation.\n\nWell, Kevin never got through to me that it was my fault he put his arthritis meds up his butt. I suppose that makes it a Kevin story? This was a 20 minute conversation, by the way. So the next time you\u2019re wondering why your prescription takes so long to fill, its because we\u2019ve spent 20 minutes telling someone not to put something up their butt.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1628657697.0},{"title":"Kevina and the Unmeasurable Rice","author":"AnonymousGriper","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/p29rwc\/kevina_and_the_unmeasurable_rice\/","text":"My mother was a Kevina in some ways, if not others. She had incredible social smarts, as she had Narcissistic Personality Disorder which meant that she could wind people around her fingers with no problem at all, but her problem-solving sometimes left a lot to be desired.\n\nTake dinner portion sizes, for instance. When I was a kid we'd have enormous dinners. Whenever the topic of starvation came up (this was the era of Live Aid, after all), she'd say that it was criminal to throw away food. Yet, she'd continue to make too much and throw it away after the meal. She took to calling my dad a \"rubbish bin\" because he'd eat whatever was put in front of him, and I was a chubby kid for the same reason. After I left home she continued to cook huge portions just for my dad and her, and sometimes had an extra bowl of potatoes or whatever leftovers there were from dinner as an evening snack rather than throw it away. \n\nSeveral years after I left home I happened to talk with mum about measuring uncooked rice while preparing dinner to make sure you only get as much cooked rice as you need. 1\/4 of a cup of uncooked rice per person makes enough cooked rice for most people, which made feeding the people in my household - all 2 of us - dead easy: 1\/4 cup + 1\/4 cup = 1\/2 cup. Cook it, give each of us half, and everyone's happy. \n\nShe got angry with me as \"there's no way of knowing how much the people you're feeding are going to eat,\" so on that basis you just *had* to make plenty so people didn't go hungry. Which, in her household, meant piling people's plates up just high enough that it wasn't ridiculous, just over-generous, then throwing the uneaten rice away or eating it that evening.\n\nDid I mention that me and dad weren't slim? \n\nI stuck by my guns and insisted that measuring rice is easy, and works. She just wouldn't have it. At the time this conversation happened we had a lot of other things going on - I was outgrowing the abusive patterns she'd taught me, and that had made our relationship rocky at times. I stuck by my argument that you can absolutely predict how much rice to cook because I was done with her madness. We talked about it for some time and she eventually realised I wasn't going to believe her, and went into \"I'm only agreeing to this because you're bullying me into it\" mode. \n\nHolding boundaries with arcs is fun \/s","upvote_ratio":0.95,"created_utc":1628674883.0},{"title":"My Aunt Karvina: The Cleaner","author":"Easterchu","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/p23pdc\/my_aunt_karvina_the_cleaner\/","text":"Hi everyone, this is my first story on this subreddit and I thought long and hard about it.

You can call me Easter for the sake of this story. I am in my 20's and still living with my parents because of Covid and I am disabled with some mental illnesses, but I am getting better. I am kind of naive but at least I can accept any criticism (give me some in the comment if you have any for me).\n\nMy mother is a big lady but she at least the most competent person I know. She cleans for a living and is essential services. All you should know that she is like Mount Vesuvius if pissed off, but is a very nice woman with a sense of humour.\n\nAnd lastly Aunt Karvina. She is a cleaner like my mother and she is also very nice, but on occasions she can be quite obnoxious. She has no relation to my family tree, but the is a friend of the family and that what matters. She is also dyslexic and think she has eyes of a hawk. Reason why she's the 'best cleaner' around.\n\nNow for the story. My mum old clients started to panic over Covid hitting Australia and lay her off. Now for a while, we are a little stuck. But at least my Aunt Karvina suggest she comes to work for a cleaning agency. That way she can make money, become essential services and still clean for people. Imagine mum's face light up when she heard about the opportunity. She applied and got accepted IMMEDIATELY after applying. She not only get to clean, but she gets to help out elderly people with basic cleaning and chatting.\n\nMum was doing her job in her first week and she done so much work, she asked me for 5 cups of tea, which I don't mind. Than the next month happened. She got a call from the cleaning agency asking to help with one of Karvina's clients for some basic cleaning because Karvina called in sick with the flu. Mum accepted and drove to work. After she got back home at 6pm, she told me this gem of a story.\n\nMum told me when she got there, there was an old man who we'll call Kenny (obvious name change for protection). He was very polite and welcomed her to his home. As she was told to do some 'basic cleaning,' she noticed that this place needed MORE THAN BASIC CLEANING! The mats in the bathroom hasn't been swapped for months with the plastic imbedded itself onto the tiles, dust all over some of the pine furniture (cupboards, shelves, chairs, desks etc...), cobwebs in the corners of the rooms and the windows are as foggy as an ocean fog in the early morning. There was some obvious clean places like the sink being empty of dirty dishes, the floor vacuumed and mopped, but not clean enough to considered safe for an asthmatic to live in. As you couldn't tell, this has disgusted mum, so she cleaned the place as best she could. After mum was done, she fixed herself and Kenny some tea and biscuits.\n\nShe later founded out that he was in the same place as her father in the Vietnam War and she immediately lit up. Kenny enjoyed her company and asked \"Can you clean for me again?\" So with that, mum told him how he can arrange that simple change by calling up the agency and tell them what needs to be done. After giving Kenny those instructions and left for her next shift, she got a call from the agency to ask her to work for Kenny again. She obviously said \"Yes\" and smiled with joy.\n\nIt later found out by Kenny that Aunt Karvina not only didn't do her job properly, she often triggered his PTSD by talking over top of him and raising her voice further. Kenny is going deaf, but Aunt Karvina will often raised her voice a lot, even when he has his hearing aids in while claiming she's the BEST cleaner.\n\nAs Aunt Karvina continued to work there, there's a noticeable pattern of Karvina working for someone and later lost that job because of my mum who happens to take over. Aunt Karvina didn't take noticed because we never told her about it. I think it's for the best because she can get useful and she is getting to the point that she is starting to clean better. And Karvina is getting to the point to that she is trying not to lose another client by not raising her voice.\n\nThere are more stories of Aunt Karvina. If you are interested, I would like to know. See you guys later then\n\nEdit: I did some editing error clean up and if I missed any, let me know\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the people who helped me with my spelling errors.

She was very impulsive and that sometimes got in the way of her thinking clearly.\n\nAnyway! Kevina loved to garden, and at the start of this one particular year she bought a grow-bag and a half-dozen strawberry plants, which she planted in the grow-bag.\n\nThey grew, and reached a point where they'd produced quite a few strawberries. Now, anyone who's grown strawberries will know that when the plants produce fruit they put out a 'hand' of tendrils which have a total of perhaps four or five strawberries, one on each 'finger'.\n\nKevina noticed these tendrils with their unripe strawberries in spring and said, \"Look how many strawberries we're going to get!\" She was excited about the bumper crop to come!\n\nFast-forward a couple of months. The strawberries on any given plant tend to ripen at an uneven rate, ie., one at a time. One day, she saw that one strawberry was ripening on one of the tendrils. She got excited and pulled off the whole tendril so she could eat the one strawberry. I watched her pick the ripe strawberry off, eat it, and throw the rest of the tendril, green strawberries and all, in the trash and felt my heart sink. I don't think I pointed out that she'd prevented three or four strawberries from ever ripening because when she feels like she's done something wrong, she tend to go into attack mode, so I quietly hoped she'd realise what she'd done and just pick the one strawberry next time.\n\nA few days later, another strawberry ripened and she did it again. And then a few days later, again.\n\nLater that month we were both in the garden and she looked at the strawberry plants in the grow-bag. There weren't many tendrils left, so she complained about how bad the crop had been this year.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1628497721.0},{"title":"Kevin cannot work out how an online calendar works","author":"AnonymousGriper","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/p1048l\/kevin_cannot_work_out_how_an_online_calendar_works\/","text":"I've just realised I can't post images to this subreddit, so [here's my screenshot on Imgur](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/qhY1pKv).\n\nContext: Kevin's been making noises about booking a consultation with me for months (I'm a sort of writing coach\/worldbuilding facilitator\/character psychology specialist), and keeps trying to get my attention by showing me bits of his creative work that he's done.

He posts these to his Discord server with the full expectation that people will be impressed, even though his invitees rarely responded. The @ everyones got so regular and intrusive that I left his server in the end for some peace. So what did he do when he couldn't show me his pics by posting them to his server any more? He sent them to me in person.\n\nMonths ago, he drew some traditional (as in non-digital, with pen and paper) art of a logo for his project. I happened to know someone who's well up on their branding and logo theory and suggested he approach them for a logo (as his logo looked kind of uninspiring) and he said that he could, but that would have to be his \"unofficial logo\".\n\nHe tried to 'wow' me by telling me how the musical score was being made by him and one of his friends.

We were only friends with him because he would always join us in our wacky adventures. It didn't matter what we would plan, he would always join so he kind of stuck with us for a while. \n\nDome background: I first met him at my studies, which was an associates degree in film. After a while, I learned that he had already acquired his bachelors degree in IT. When I asked him why he didn't follow that field, he simply told me: \"I didn't really feel like doing IT\". It kind of makes sense that people don't want to follow a career path which they're not passionate about, so I didn't think too much of it. He had a pretty hefty loan for the film studies but before the first year was over, he dropped out. In the new school year, he would enroll in something completely different again: construction. \nHe then started a pattern of not liking his new studies but loaning huge amounts for the first year and then dropping out. Everytime, it would be something radically different from the last time. It sort of became a running joke in the group until after a few more years I finally decided to have a conversation about what the hell he was doing. He was currently doing another IT studies, but this time as an associates degree in the hopes that \"the work would be easier\".\n\nI asked him: \"Kevin, you keep switching between studies and it seems like you're wandering around aimlessly. If you could picture yourself doing anything you'd like, doesn't even have to be a job, what would it be?\"\n\nKevin: \"Oh easy, truck driver! I've felt that way for years!\"\n\nMe: \"What? That's fantastic! Why haven't you started working towards that sooner?\"\n\nKevin: \"What are you, an idiot? Haven't you ever heard someone say to first get a proper degree first and then do what you like on the side?\"\n\nA few seconds of silence pass as I try to process his reasoning\n\nMe: \"But you know being a truck driver is also a proper paying job right? You could totally do that as a career!\"\n\nKevin: \"No,\" Kevin stated firmly, \"that'll be for on the side. First, I need to get a proper degree\"\n\nI dropped the conversation after that, knowing that there would be no talking sense into him. Not long after that, due to something else completely we told him he wasn't welcome anymore to the friend group so I sort of lost touch. \n \nThat was a few years ago and now, a friend of mine works at a community college where Kevin was studying again, this time something in media marketing... \nI just hope that he I day realises that being a truck driver is fine so he can drop the loans...\n\nEdit: Some people in the comments asked why Kevin got kicked out of the group. In short, he also had a temper problem and would get salty over the dumbest things. I have three examples which perfectly portrays him. \n\nFirst one, everyone in the group games together. This one time, we had a game in which you could level up and the difficulty of the game scaled to the level. Basically, level 15 players can't play with level 60 players. \nSo one day, friend A asked in the group chat if I could help him with a level he was stuck on as we were on the same level, when Kevin started complaining: \"Oh hear that friend B? Guess we aren't good enough to play with them...\" \nFriend B: \"Right, our levels are too low\"\nKevin didn't care about logic, his feelings were hurt so all he could do was be angry for a few days. \n\nSecond story was in a bar. Four of us were drinking and three of us had empty glasses. The waitress shows up and asks us kindly and playfully: \"shall I pour four more?\"\nEveryone looked at Kevin but he just stared with this fake half smile, pretending to not exist to avoid this \"awkward\" situation, I guess. \nI told her: \"I guess three will do for now, thanks\"\nSome jokes were made, I don't fully remember but everyone was laughing so she thought she could ask Kevin to chug the last three sips in one go so she could bring four more. \nKevin was now certain that he was being swindled, the establishment had it out for his money so he told her, quite rudely, to back off. \nShe stopped serving him after that and we tipped her extra for the good time. \n\nLastly, four friends of the group decided to go on a vacation. We went to the grandparents of one of the guys in a different country. Everyone tried to adapt and at least try to speak the language a little, but not Kevin. Everytime the grandparents said anything, he would just rock that fake half smile again and pretend not to exist. \nAt one point, as a thanks, I paid for something small for grandma as a gesture of being thankful. Later that night, she handed me something to drink and snuck a 5 euro note along with it. The next few days, we kept giving eachother the five euros back and forth in all sorts of funny ways as she thought I didn't even need to pay in the first place. \nThe last night, I was thinking of a way to have the upper hand and leave grandma the 5 euros without her being able to give it back. When I came up with a suggestion, Kevin snapped:\n\"Dude, stop it! She doesn't want the five euros!!! So either shut up, or I'll shut your mouth for you!\"\nThat didn't sit right with any of us, so after the trip, I sent him a break up text on behalf of the group. \n\nPs. I completely forgot this, but for those who are still reading, here's a little bonus. Kevin didn't understand questions with two options. If you asked him: \"Kevin, what would you prefer?\" He would usually answer in ways like: \"Yeah!\", \"sure\" or \"let's go!\"","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1628462051.0},{"title":"Kevin doesn't understand storage storage space and physics.","author":"Kazbob48","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/p0mns6\/kevin_doesnt_understand_storage_storage_space_and\/","text":"So I used to work for a major soda company as a merchandiser. Basically my job was to stop by stores several times per day and refill shelves.\n\nTwice a week, though, was load day. On that day a truck would drop off pallets meant to supply the store until the next delivery. Those days were pains.\n\nThe problem is that everyone else is also dropping off stuff and soon enough everyone's pallets are in everyone else's way. You are trying to move your stuff to your area in the backroom, work new product into store, change store displays, etc.\n\nNeedless to say when done incorrectly you are quickly at the receiving end of other grumpy merchandisers and the backroom manager.\n\nSo my supervisor is Kevin. Kevin is a big believer in always over-ordering.  There was this tiny convenience store in hickville that maybe had a population of 500 people. Their backroom is tiny. We have enough room for 2 pallets. We stack those pallets 2 high for a total of 4 pallets. But that's it.\n\nThis store has a sale. My boss orders TEN pallets of stuff. When I arrive to work through the delivery the manager is bent out of shape because there are pallets OUTSIDE the store that anyone with sticky fingers can take. \n\nI call my boss and explain the situation. He explains to me that I need to somehow make room in the store for the extra units. So I'm doing my best to do so by putting product where it is NOT supposed to go, and now the manager is even MORE mad. \n\nSo I call my boss AGAIN. Now he's mad at ME that I somehow can't find room for 4x more product than should have been ordered. He dispatches a truck to come buy back some of the product. It's the same driver who dropped it off. He said he thought that delivery was going to be a bad idea when he dropped off \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude2d\n\n1 more story. The 4th of July is the busiest day of the year. Every store has sales and people buy more soda than they ever plan on drinking. Every year 4th of July has problems as stores start to run out of stock before more trucks arrive to restock.\n\nEvery single vendor tries to solve this problem by over-ordering which means the back room is completely 100% full the night before.\n\nThe store that I am working has this old soviet union relic of a fork lift. The vertical forks are hydraulic, BUT the machine doesn't do the actual pushing forward. In order to move this type of lift you have to physically push it forward and backward. Obviously this takes some muscle and is a HUGE pain in the rear when maneuvering 200 12 packs per pallet.\n\nTo make matters worse, the wheels on the forklift are made of ceramic. What that means is if there is even the SMALLEST piece of debris on the floor (say a small piece of broken wood from a pallet) the lift WILL get stuck.\n\nAnyways, I'm trying to get the last pallet stacked. Generally speaking, we try to avoid 3 high because of how dangerous it is. But it's 4th of July so here we go with Kevin's order. This will create a stack 3 high of pallets. The forklift can't reach the top of the 2nd pallet to out the 3rd pallet on top.\n\nThe way to fix this is to bring the pallet back down, throw some product on the existing 2nd pallet onto the pallet currently on the fork until the 2nd pallets height is reduced enough to stack the 3rd pallet.\n\nMy boss stops by and is aggravated I haven't finished stacking product. I tell him the problem. To his credit he helps me throw some product.\n\nHe decides he is going to use the lift. He has never used it before. He hits a piece of debris on the floor with the pallet raised as high as it goes. Instead of lowering the pallet my boss decides to literally get a running start and attempt to \"push\" the lift over whatever is stopping the ceramic wheel.\n\nIt looked like it worked at first. He definite got the wheel over the debris. But now the entire forklift starts to tilt  it is on a collision course with the OTHER soda company's stacked products. It his and causes a domino effect with all the other stacked pallets.\n\nIt is a glorious old faithful of sodas as pallets hit the floor and explode. It literally sounds like a war zone.\n\nI got paid overtime that night to stay HOURS cleaning up the mess while my boss got to go home.  The backroom manager was lava hot mad the entire time. No matter how many times they cleaned that floor it was sticky to the day I quit.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1628455704.0},{"title":"Kevina didn\u2019t know there was apricots in dried apricots","author":"__Pulchritudinous__","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/p0at2i\/kevina_didnt_know_there_was_apricots_in_dried\/","text":"I have many stories from high school about this Kevina but something happened that recently reminded me of this story in particular.\n\nNow this kevina was in my home group, and during a break while everyone was sitting down someone brought out a bag of dried apricots, kevina asked the person \u201cwhat are those\u201d and the person said they are dried apricots and asked kevina if she\u2019d like one.

We are run by...business people not aviators.  We lost a very good pilot to retirement and the slot opened up.  Manbaby was a copilot in the section and was barely adequate for the position, but he spent most of his time being the pilot monitoring and not the pilot flying so his flaws were hidden for a while.  He put in for the position and the manager, a non pilot, asked the section's opinion.  Myself, one male aviation and one female aviator told the manager that Manbaby was not cut out for the position, so management gave Manbaby the job.\n\nAnd so it begins.\n\nOn his first flight as a Pilot in Command (PIC) we flew to a nearby airport, had lunch and then flew back.  I did for him what my mentor did for me, I sat in the jump seat and let him and a copilot fly us home.  Immediately after takeoff he realized he did not program the Flight Management System with the route.  Not a huge deal, but fly the aircraft and do it when you are in a less critical phase of flight.  He looks down and starts programming the FMS and it's like looking down and driving.  He's weaving all over the place.  Alarmed, I look out the front windshield and all I can see is the ocean.\n\nWe had a long debrief.\n\nNext, we were carrying passengers.  He sat in the copilot's seat, but I told him to fly the aircraft as another gauge of his skill...or lack thereof.  At 400 feet I noticed that he had backed off the power and we were slowing down and our climb rate was anemic.  We have a three warning system before you have to do something.\n\n\"Manbaby, you're getting slow.  Add power.\"\n\n\"Manbaby, add power.  Get your nose down.\"\n\n\"Manbaby, power power power!  I have the flight controls.\"\n\nHe had no idea he would stall the aircraft if he continued.\n\nSo, I brought this to the attention of Boss Baby, the manager, and was ordered to keep him flying.  Boss Baby was a career destroyer and bragged about getting people fired so we pressed on.\n\nOne rainy, windy night we were coming back on a VFR arrival and Manbaby was the pilot flying.  He reduced the power to descend to the check in altitude of 2000', but did not put the power back in.  So, we descended below 2000'.  In slow motion I watch as the the altitude drops to 1800', which was 1500' above the ground.  He then snap rolls the aircraft to the left.  We fall below stall speed and he's cross controlled on the rudder, which means we would spin into the ground.  I took the flight controls and he was completely unaware that we could be a smoking hole in the freeway in a few seconds.  I brought it to Boss Baby's attention and was promptly ignored so I started a file.\n\nManbaby would always get lost on VFR flights.  I showed him a way to identify his location so he could call it out to ATC when checking in.\n\nManbaby:  \"(ATC), (callsign), three mile wess of da fix.\"\n\nMe:  \"You're east of the fix.\"\n\nManbaby:  \"(ATC), (callsign), three mile wess of da fix.\"\n\nMe:  \"You're east of the fix.\"\n\nManbaby:  \"(ATC), (callsign), three mile wess of da fix.\"\n\nMe:  \"I have the flight controls.\"\n\nManbaby was also the Maintenance Officer and had to coordinate maintenance service.  One example of many was this.  He was supposed to receive parts and get them to the mechanic on a Tuesday so the aircraft would be out of service by Thursday.  On Thursday I called the mechanic and the aircraft was still down because Manbaby didn't deliver the parts.  I tracked the parts down and they were still in transit, but Manbaby should have kept up with this.  I approached him while he was reading the comics.\n\nMe: \"Manbaby, the parts didn't come in.

The parts didn't come in.\"\n\nMe:  \"I just told you that!\"\n\nHe was also supposed to get one of the life rafts serviced.  I tasked him to do this in March as the raft was due no later than July 17th and it typically took 11 days to ship, service and return.  I told him he had to ship it no later than July 6th.\n\nMarch.\n\nManbaby:  \"Oh, the life raft...the life raft?  Oh, the life raft.

I once carried all of the survival gear and other equipment while he walked behind me carrying nothing.  I sarcastically said, \"Well, I guess I'll do it all by myself.\"\n\nHe smiled and said, \"Oh good.  I go my son's music practice.\"  He turned on a dime and all I saw was car exhaust as he drove away.\n\nAs a PIC, Manbaby would often fly with less experienced pilots and they finally told me their horror stories.  One female crew member was on the rotation with him and she told me, \"OH HELL NO!\"\n\nI started getting aggressive with Boss Baby and would march into his office and say, \"Boss Baby, I need to talk to you about that man!\"\n\nExamples:\n\n\"Boss Baby, that man nearly taxiied into a 747!  I know that's such a tiny plane and easy to miss!\"\n\n\"Boss Baby, yesterday I worked a 15 hour day and that man worked a 15 minute day.  How is it fair that we get paid the same?\"\n\n\"Boss Baby, that man is going to kill someone and that someone is likely to be me!\"\n\n\"Boss Baby, I'm doing three jobs.  I have to find what Manbaby f'd up and fix it.  Then I have to do his job.  Then I have to do my job.\"\n\n\"Boss Baby, I'm going to make your life easier.  For Manbaby's performance report, all you have to do is say OP will fix it.\"\n\n\"Boss Baby, that man has a 10 kilobyte brain running a 10 GB program.  I can literally see the hamster on the wheel in his head dying.\"\n\n\"Boss Baby, that man has two brain cells to rub together.\"\n\nThankfully, all of the crews, the FAA and our HQ backed me up when Boss Baby fought tooth and nail to keep Manbaby flying.  We brought in a check airman to evaluate Manbaby and the check airman needed a drink after.  On the checkride, this happened...\n\nCheck airman:  \"Manbaby, I'm not even from here and I'm telling you you're going to the wrong airport.\"\n\nI finally threw down on Boss Baby.\n\n\"Ok, Boss Baby, I'll make you a bet.  On the rainy, windy night of my choosing, Manbaby will fly you to the airport of my choosing.  If you guys survive, I'll fly him as much as you want.\"\n\nSo, Manbaby was transferred to reception.  He took a call and then reported the information to the appropriate section.\n\nManbaby:  \"Oh, the caller wanted me to pass on X to you.\"\n\nSection chief:  \"Ok, good, just give me the number and I'll call her back.\"\n\nManbaby:  Oh...oh?

Oh, da name.  Da name.  I didn't get da name.\"\n\nI could write a book on Manbaby, but those are just the highlight.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1628333173.0},{"title":"Military Kevin with some TIFU.","author":"Ottobonie","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/oywwes\/military_kevin_with_some_tifu\/","text":"Very new to Reddit, but most of my experience is from the YouTube, I have trouble reading and I like to listen to the stories. This post has a little bit of Kevin with TIFU, wasn\u2019t me but I witnessed it. Not sure if this belongs here and if it doesn\u2019t please let me know, now the story.\n\nBACKGROUND!\n\nThis happened around 10 years ago while I was in the army. After basic training I spent a little time in Korea, this has its own stories to tell. I came back from Korea to a base back in the States. The unit I was assigned to was brand new and I already had a year and a half in. Most of the soldiers were new so I was placed in a squad leader position as a private first class, PFC. There were other PFC and even Specialist, SPC and a rank higher then me, but they received the rank based on college or JROTC. \n\nSTORY!\n\nAnyways, one of the first soldiers I had under me was Pvt Kevin. Kevin was always late to formations and I was forced by my platoon sgt to conduct \u201ccorrective training.\u201d Kevin was always losing sensitive items causing lock downs, failing to qualify on the range and making our days longer and just a living hell. Kevin did not understand the concept of personal hygiene. Waiting in a room with him was unbearable. In addition to weapon systems we made hygiene items apart of his sensitive items, meaning at any point a team leader or NCO could ask for these items and he had to produce. Kevin needed to keep deodorant, body wash and shampoo on him at all times, queue the field problem.\n\nWe had just entered into our field cycle and were gearing up the HMMWVs and loading the radios. After all the radios were ready to go I try to conduct a radio check, nothing happened. When I checked it turned out the radio had been zeroed, wiped of the information needed to make them work. It turned out Kevin wanted to help, zeroed the radio and left because he had no idea how to fix it.\n\nSo the area we would be training in was a wide open space surrounded by a thick forest. The area was leveled and had a layer of rock, making it difficult to steak down GP Mediums, our tents. There was only a few hard sites, actual buildings, that could be used so our platoon was designated as using a tent, go 3rd plt. After clearing a spot of rocks and steaking down our tent as best we could we started tiding up the operating area and setting up an antenna. This antenna was so large it needed support cables, which also needed to be steaked into the ground.\n\nTowards the end of the day clouds started to roll in. In this part of the US it was not abnormal for weather patterns to change so suddenly, so we did not think much of it. Unbeknownst to us, there had been a tornado warning issued and top brass decided not to tell us.\n\nAt the end of the day the wind started to pick up and we started to bed down. The tent was a piece of fabric that was held up by two or three Y beams, as far as I can remember. The outer portion of the tent was supported by this round pieces of wood and cables causing tension to keep the tent from collapsing.\n\nAfter checking for sensitive items we all start to lay down, but mother nature had another plan for us. The wind picked up to the point that it was starting to slip under the tent, opening our flap. It got to the point where we could actually see the Y beam support starting to lift. SGT Z saw this and yelled at us to jump onto the Y beams to try and hold them down, so we did.\n\nAfter a couple of seconds hanging off the support mother nature said \u201cnope\u201d and threw a powerful gust, lifting a support that did not have anyone at it at the time. After the first support went down, the rest of the tent went down with it. Grabbing my sensitive items and making my way out of the tent I assisted SGT Z with getting soldiers out and to the hard sites for safety. \n\nNow let me say this, when you bed down there is no particular uniform you have to wear, so people would wear pt shorts, ACUs or civis, civilian clothing. Normally this isn\u2019t a problem except it was cold, very cold.\n\nAfter getting most of the soldiers out we were still down one, it was Kevin. We could see a bulge in the tent moving around, he couldn\u2019t find the exit. After finding the exit Kevin immerged holding all his hygiene items, but no weapon system or NVGs. We had to send him back in to correct this mistake. Finally Kevin came out and ran for the hard site. \n\nNow it was dark, very dark, with only lightning lighting our way; which gave me the weird sensation of running in slow motion. Ahead of me I could see SGT Z running towards the antenna, not seeing the lines holding it up. I tried to warn him, but the wind and thunder drown my voice out. SGT Z ran headlong into the cable, cloth lining himself and falling on the ground.\n\nAfter getting to safety SGT Z started yelling at soldiers and other NCOs, trying to bring order to the chose. Across the tent was a group of soldiers huddling for warmth, some only wearing boxers and underwear. Before SGT Z and I could return to the tent to gather something to help them keep warm, the commander, I for get her name but we\u2019ll call her CPT M, arrived driving her nice personal vehicle. CPT M ran outside to get a blanket, she returned with a pink swaddle blanket that could barley cover half the back of one soldier.\n\nI got to give her credit though, at least she tried.\n\nSGT Z was still yelling orders and giving commanders, not paying attention to CPT M. CPT M walked up to SGT Z and told him \u201cSGT Z, yours balls are showing.\u201d Now SGT Z, being a former Marine, took this as a complement. \u201cThank you ma\u2019am,\u201d he replied, excited his efforts were not going unnoticed. \u201cCPT M, looking him dead in the eye said, \u201cNo, your balls are hanging out of your boxers!\u201d SGT Z looked down to see his family jewels hanging out for the world to see. SGT Z, with a shrug, tucked his over sized manly bits back into his boxers and continued on with giving orders.\n\nThe next day we all emerged to sunlight, like I said, weird weather. The tent had been completely flattened and our uniforms were scattered all over the area in the woods, in trees and under bushes. Before we could completely gather our items and reorganize ourself 1SG F arrived on scene and called a company formation. We then got berated for not being in proper uniform, before being dismissed. We spent the rest of the day trying to reclaim our lost possessions.\n\nI don\u2019t know if anyone ever talked to the 1SG, but I did serve with her in Korea and she is an excellent 1SG. Its been so long since this happened so past this I cant remember what happened. Thanks for reading and if you\u2019re interested in anymore stories from the military I may post them later.\n\nAlso, if anyone was wondering, Kevin ended up getting discharged for cultivating Marijuana in the Barracks and trying to sale it from his closet.","upvote_ratio":0.93,"created_utc":1628214346.0},{"title":"Kevin, His Fart Collection, And Other Anecdotes","author":"BurntSchmidt","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/oy8kpe\/kevin_his_fart_collection_and_other_anecdotes\/","text":"  I met Kevin working in Kiddie Land at my local amusement park when I was eighteen.  Somehow we became friends, but I can't remember why.  The first time he invited me to his house, Kevin and his twin brother Kevin, both named after their dad, both appearing indistinguishable from one another, my friend, who we'll call Kevin # 1, was in the midst of a violent brawl with Kevin # 2.  For some reason #2 was totally naked, chasing #1 around the house screaming \"I'm gonna make you eat my asshole!\".  It was profoundly disturbing.  Their dad broke up the fight, yelling out very vividly \"if the two of you don't stop then you're gonna have to eat MY asshole!\".\n\n  Their mother, who was the most normal human being I ever met, was in tears, desperately reminding them that they had company (me).  She looked emaciated.  God only knows the horrors she's laid her eyes on in that house.   Kevin #2 locked himself in his room, and the crashing of lamps, and whatever else has the ability to shatter, rang out for the better part of an hour.  Kevin # 1 apologized, and we hung out in his room.  Everything was copacetic until he said \"wait til you see THIS\".  He opened his closet and a pile of seemingly empty Maxwell House containers tumbled to the floor.\n\n  His room looked like twenty sticks of dynamite had went off, but miraculously hadn't broken a single thing.  \"Check out these beauties\", he said with an excitable disposition.  Each can was labeled in black marker with the integers of different years - 98', 99', 00', etc.  I asked what they were.  He said \"the real present is inside\".  Suddenly I felt ill.  He didn't even have to say it, and I prayed he wouldn't have the impulse to open one of them.  It was his fart collection.  \"99' was a doozie.  Shall we?\".  \"No, Kevin.  Please don't\".  \"Okay, but you don't know what you're missing\".  We played Madden and I left, partially traumatized.\n\n  The second time I went over, Kevin # 2 was inebriated.  He was an absolute prick.  A few years later he moved to Vegas to be an accountant and became a degenerate gambler, coke head, and alcoholic.  He also did amateur fetish porn where he played a submissive gimp who liked getting ball busted (i.e., kicked and kneed in the balls for pay).  Except he wasn't in it for the money.  He genuinely enjoyed getting kicked in the balls.  At one point our friend Brooks found some of his videos.  I clearly remember a dominatrix busting his balls and asking \"do you like that, bitch?\", to where he replied with \"kick me until I'm infertile\".  We must've rewound that part a thousand times.  \n\n  Kevin # 1 didn't like it when we'd watch it.  Brooks used to ask \"why?  You both have identical DNA\".\n\n  As far as that first year working with Kevin, I can recall a slew of bizarre things he did.  He'd repeatedly put kids into ride seats backwards.  That's what got him fired.  He was already on thin ice after telling a four year old to \"keep that fucking thing in your mouth (referring to a pacifier) or I'll shove it down your throat\".  He told a couple that their rambunctious child \"probably has a mental disorder\".  He once buckled in a group of kids in a ride, turned it on, and then walked off to a concession stand.  Luckily I or the parents didn't rat him out, since I stepped in during my break.\n\n  He was also a pig when it came to eating.  He picked up a half eaten corn dog off of a bench and ate it.  His excuse was \"I saw the guy eating it and he looked pretty clean\".  He would trip over his own feet often, but would never put his arms out to brace himself for the fall.  He'd just smash his face in.  When I explained what \"brace yourself\" means, he said \"I don't wear braces\".  One day he showed up to work covered in dirt, cinders, and blood.  His eye was swollen shut.  When we worriedly asked him what happened, his response was very simply \"fuck humanity\".  A girl working at a game nearby said he \"just fell, got up, and angrily asked who put 'that stick' on the ground\".  There was no stick.  He tripped over his own feet.\n\n  As far as him tripping over his own feet, it was immediately apparent that the reason was because his shoes were about four sizes too big for his feet.  He looked like a clown walking around.  When I asked him his shoe size, he said \"I have to special order them.  They're 16s\".  When I commented that he was shorter than me and all I wore was a 10 1\/2, his response was \"you know what they say about guys with big feet\".  \n\n  Anyway, all of the former occurred within a year of me knowing him.  Once we got to college and lived together for a full semester, well, that's a whole other story.  A story so insane, so vast, and so riddled with incidents, that it will take some serious preparation to even begin to get into that story.\n\nTo be continued....","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1628131859.0},{"title":"Kevin doesn't know what mold is","author":"KentuckyFriedSoy","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/oxcrv8\/kevin_doesnt_know_what_mold_is\/","text":"My brother, the Kevin in this story, has never been the sharpest tool in the shed. He believes that dolphins cause cancer, but we aren't here to discuss that. One day, Kevin was eating a croissant and asking when we got \"blue-cheese\" croissants. He was saying how delicious they were and when was the soonest we would have more. This was odd, because the last time we bought croissants was WEEKS ago. I saw him holding a croissant that was covered in blue mold and happily munching away at it. I told him it was moldy and not safe to eat but he insisted it was fine because \"it tastes all good to me\". I threw out all the rest when he wasn't looking so he couldn't eat anymore \"blue-cheese\" croissants.\n\nEdit: Y'all want to know about the dolphins. OK, well 5 or 6 years ago Kevin was a young adolescent and we still had some hope his brain would develop further. He is very curious and loves to ask questions, so I was explaining how electromagnetic waves work in simple terms and that electromagnetic waves with really high frequencies can cause cancer. He looked shocked and asked \"Wait, so does that mean that dolphins cause cancer?\" I had to keep questioning Kevin to figure out how on Earth he came up with this conclusion. He thought that 1. Electromagnetic waves and the waves in the ocean are the same. 2. That all waves in the ocean are created by the movements of dolphins. He thus concluded that dolphins cause cancer.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1628024282.0},{"title":"Kevin doesn't understand keeping his personal stuff in his personal spaces","author":"Kazbob48","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/ox562i\/kevin_doesnt_understand_keeping_his_personal\/","text":"So I had this Kevin in my fraternity. \n\nGranted, storage space in the house is limited, but this guy took it to the next level with leaving his crap all over the house.\n\nWhen his mini fridge wouldn't hold all the stuff he bought, he went to another members fridge and put the remaining beer and hoagie sandwiches he bought in that members fridge without telling that member. Then he all but got into a physical fight when he went to retrieve items only to find out said member consumed them already.\n\nKevin decided to go to a yard sale. He decided to purchase a giant L shaped couch at the sale. Only 1 section of the couch fit in his room, so he left the remaining pieces out in the narrow hall which created a giant pain for members trying to get through.\n\nMembers had enough of that couch I'm the way and moved it outside. It rained that day. When Kevin returned he threw a giant 2 year old tantrum that the couch was ruined.\n\nKevin decides his truck needs new tires. He orders them online. These giant tires show up, and instead of directly taking them to get installed or even just putting them in the tailed, Kevin puts them in the entryway to the house.\n\nThey sit there for a week. At a house meeting Kevin is informed those tires need to find a new home, namely either on his truck or in his truck. Kevin does not reply.\n\nDuring a house party some intoxicated members decide it would be funny to roll the tires. Our house is at the top of a hill. As they release the third tire Kevin sees it happen and chases after it on foot. All 3 of the tires hit another fraternity house at the bottom of the hill, and now their members are outside.\n\nThey think Kevin rolled the tires, and Kevin is trying to roll the tires back up the hill and is now mad at the other house because they are hassling him.\n\nKevin decides he wants to get into the amateur radio scene. He decides his small radio is no longer sufficient and decides to install a large antenna on the top of the house's roof. Kevin installs the antenna without permission. \n\nThere is a problem. Kevin's room does not have direct access to outside. Kevin drills a hole into another members room to feed the cable through. Kevin makes no effort to tack this cable to a wall, under the carpet,  etc. Kevin then drills another hole to feed this cable out of that members room, across the hall, and into his room. Again, giant cable laying on the floor.\n\nAnnoyed, the member in the room he drilled into cut the cable and threw it out the window. Kevin becomes irate about damaged property, and reinstall s a new cable while the member is at class.\n\nWhen that member returns to see the cable back, he goes up on the roof and pulls the whole antenna down and drops it in the front yard. Kevin barges into the members room and starts spouting off verbal sewage. That member was a lineman for the football team. When he stood up, Kevin realized the fight was a poor idea, walked back to his room, and slammed the door.\n\nThere were so many episodes of stuff like this \ud83e\udd23","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1628002613.0},{"title":"I'm done with my roomate and longtime friend \"Kevin\".","author":"KittyKatt_97","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/oy3cqm\/im_done_with_my_roomate_and_longtime_friend_kevin\/","text":"This will partially be r\/storiesaboutkevin and r\/amItheasshole but I want to post it here. Here's the basic back story: Firstly, many apologies now for the cluttered details of this story. If I put every detail in order in of how everything went down, this would be the worlds longest thesis. It may be confusing but I'll try to make it make sense. Disclaimer: no real names in this post. Okay, here it is. \n\nI've been living with my bf for years now; with the help of his family, it's made things less painful to deal with money wise. We've been together for over 8 years now, me being 24 and him being 26. My bf is a full time university student getting his BA this year and has always had relatively consistent work where as I've struggled with working for literal years due to disabilities and illnesses springing up every 2 years or so. I'm not gonna give a sob story about me today, though. He takes good care of me and I swear I don't deserve it. Blah blah anyways, on with this story. \n\n3 or so years ago, we insisted on our friend to move in with us. She's 22 now. She was in an extremely toxic situation at her families house prior so moving her out was pretty easy. She's my sister basically. Our other roomate moved in shortly after she did and was kicked out by my bf's family six months into him staying with us (at the time, we were still under my bf's families roof and it wasn't our decision to kick him out). After we finally found a place elsewhere to actually move to, we decided to bring him with; I'll call him Kevin. \n\nI've known Kevin for years and my bf has known him even longer. All went to high school together before meeting our other roomate; I'll call her Gem, in University. They both lived in pretty toxic, shitty households. In similar yet very different situations. The long and the short of it, he was essentially groomed into being useless in decision making and reliant on others for guidance with everything, and she was bullied into believing she wasn't good enough and always needed to try more, do more and be better. \n\nBoth of them have autism so it make it a lot harder and took a lot more effort for them to get to where they are now. With Gem, I honestly couldn't be happier. She proved to herself and her parents that she can be responsible, move out, pay bills, take care of herself, get a dog, live her life and everything in between. \n\nI'm already biased a bit due to my hatred for Kevin's mother due to my own issues from the past involving me and things said about my own mother so... I try to not let that affect the way I see Kevin but after a year + of him living with us under OUR roof, we've noted too many things to count that Kevin has done. \n\nOne quick storytime example of his Kevin-ness is that at our place we first had before recently moving again with Kevin and Gem, he noticed our airfryer had melted our power outlet in the kitchen down to the wires and decided to not say anything for 3 days. He moving it back in front and act like it wasn't there. When I decided to clean the kitchen, I discovered it and panicked thinking it just happened. I contacted the other two only to get back from him that he'd know for 3 days and just didn't say anything. He'd used the fucking thing after he found out. We rent and we were in a complex. He could've burnt our place down our others and cost us or security deposit, damage costs, fines or worse. I cannot describe how mad I was. How mad we all were. THAT should've been the final straw, but no, my boyfriend insistent he could change and that he'd try to be a better person, blah blah blah. The only reason I'm writing this post is because the other day, it just hit my bf like a cement truck just the overwhelming weight of EVERYHTING. He fell into a pretty bad depressed state that night and struggled to comprehend all of it. Yeah, we are waaaaayyyy too patient sometimes. I want to be a nice person, and by no means do we with ill-will on Kevin at all. He's still a good friend and a well-meaning guy but the damage from his mother has seriously taken a toll over his childhood, adolescence, and adulthood; controlling him and reinforcing many behaviors at every turn. He has a scued idea of responsibilities and just being mature. Sorry for all the rambling. I've listed a bunch of his BS below. \n\nFrom my notes, this is what I've written over the span of 8ish months: \n\n- Remarks on the past without thinking it through\n- No genuine or proper apologies for behavior in the past\n- Created trauma through insistent friendship with my ex for 2 years\n- Showing many instances of apathy or simply not caring for a situation or wanting to learn more of a situation\n- Created conflict with my relationship due to immaturity, not respecting personal space with \"directly\" affected, and creating an awkward presence with current behavior\n- Doesn't know how to read a room before saying\/doing something entirely inappropriate or uncalled for\n- Hovering constantly\n- Using his autism as an excuse\n- Using his depression as an excuse\n- Having pretended to be suicidal over the idea of us messaging in a friend's chat he wasn't a part of because he thought we weren't going to be his friend anymore (yeah, taking himself to see the pearly gates or taking a blade to the wrist are the correct responses to that - not trying to be insensitive but have to be specific with terms)\n- Doesn't interact with friends unless it's for a given purpose only he wants\n- Struggles to understand the importance of separation between art\/artist regarding real world problems or fictional media (supporting people who are garbage humans)\n- Inappropriate behavior surrounding negative issues\n- Being antisocial when outside friends come over to visit\n- Not understand many basic cooking skills\n- Can't be bothered to clean up messes he makes\n- Having confidence in decisions\n- Finding a new job (commitment)\n- Being more serious about getting his driver's license\n- Obvious physical health issues\n- Taking pride in activities\/himself\n- Taking accountability\/stop making excuses\n- Addiction issues (goes with health problems)\n- Understanding logical situations\/having common sense with literally anything\n- Responsibility over individual tasks (half-assing things)\n- Not being so informative about daily events (get a journal or something)\n- Income privacy issues (talks too much about it)\n- No sense of space or sound (makes a lot of noise and is quite disruptive)\n- Lives by a 'must be told what to do' lifestyle (too dependent) \n\nDaily Lifestyle Schedule:\n- Wakes up\n- Goes to work\n- Cleans only his stuff unless asked otherwise\n- Lays in bed watching TV all day\n- Eats a lot\n- Sleeps \n\nOkay... after all of that now, I don't know where else to go. We've had, if I need to put a number on it, about 11 conversations with him about these exact things. \n\nSome I already know are gonna say \"wtf are you still friends with him?\" And the answer for me is that I want to think myself as understanding, forgiving and patient... I'm too patient, though; patient or stubborn. My bf and I are similar. He takes friendships to heart. Almost more than family at times so it's intense and extremely hard for him to let friends go or even confront them, but after the amount of stress, feeling down, anxious, having mental breakdowns, and so on, we're done. \n\nWe are done with him and don't know where else to turn. Gem gave me the idea to do a reddit post a month or so ago but I was hesitant. It only came up again 2 nights ago when I suffered a serious panic attack due to ptsd from my ex. I seriously don't know how many more details I can or even should add to this because on my screen right now, it seriously does look like the bad REALLY outweighs the good but at this point in our lives it kinda has. There's too much to talk about, too much to remember and too much I've probably forgotten. I feel so numb yet I cry probably once every day or so about it all. I want to help and be a good person, but I know I can't be everyone's savior. (Thats what my mom said to me growing up but I kinda didn't listen to that) We might try convincing him to move to his own place and then way he can still have \"independence\" and not have to go home to mommy dearest. Oh, keep in mind, Kevin is turning 26 this year. \n\nSorry now and again for the mile long post and any spelling errors potentially. I just want to see if any one has any outside opinions and unbiased views on this situation. I'll respond if anyone has any specific questions. \n\nKevin won't change. I'm not convinced he will. \n\nI feel like I'm the one in the wrong constantly for criticizing him on anything. We are truly, truly exhausted. I'm exhausted. \n\nReddit, what do you think of all this?","upvote_ratio":0.46,"created_utc":1628114133.0},{"title":"Kevin drives a big rig","author":"TheDigileet","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/ovnt68\/kevin_drives_a_big_rig\/","text":"I got my commercial license in November 2016 through a company sponsored training program.

One of the terms in that contract said I have to work for 6 months in their expedited division, meaning I share the truck with a teammate who drives while I sleep, I drive while he sleeps, and the truck moves for about 20 hours a day.       \n\nI got along with Kevin pretty well before this when we were sleeping in different hotel rooms, so I thought he would be a good teammate. I could not have been more wrong. The main reason I quit 3 months into that contract was that they refused to give me a new teammate, so now I was a trucker by night (I prefer the graveyard shift), and a babysitter by day of someone almost the same age as my dad. He was good at making sure the truck didn\u2019t kill anyone on the highway, but that was about it.       \n\n*He didn't seem to understand his life was in my hands when he was asleep, and would constantly wake me up to ask for help with something he didn't even try to figure out himself. Things like the radio, the GPS, the seat adjustment, even the cruise control which works exactly the same way as it does in every car I've ever driven. So when my turn came, I could do maybe 100 miles before I had to park the truck and pass out from exhaustion.         \n\n*He went to insane lengths to blame his fuckups on anyone but himself. I'm pretty sure he has a gold medal in Mental Gymnastics.      \n\nHe didn't swing a turn wide enough when exiting a truck stop (despite 2 giant signs warning him), so the trailer wheels went into a ditch and we got stuck. He got a $150 ticket for blocking the road, and the company paid $300 for a winch-out. When a safety manager called him the next day to ask what happened, he said \"the truck stop is working in cahoots with the city to keep the ditch there because it generates revenue for the towing companies and the police.\" When they didn't buy it, he tried to blame me even though I was asleep when it happened.      \n\nThe GPS is a tool, but he treated it like a God that would rain hellfire down on him if he displeased it. When we arrived at the customer on another trip (middle of nowhere, only building in sight bigger than a house), he ignored the giant sign that said \"[customer name] truck entrance\" because the GPS told him to keep going. Turns out we came just close enough for it to think we arrived, so it started directions to a fuel stop over 500 miles (800 km) away, and he followed it without question. 2 hours later, I woke up to a call from dispatch asking why we drove right past the customer without stopping and got back on the interstate. Eventually I put it all together, got in the passenger seat, and confronted him about it in as calm of a manner as I could after being woken up at my equivalent of 3:00 in the morning to clean up another one of his messes. His excuse was \"the GPS told me to keep going, and I don't mess with computers like that\", then he tried to blame me because I put the route in. It wouldn't surprise me if he pulled a Michael Scott and drove the truck into a lake because it told him to.      \n\n*Truckers are required to log every moment we spend in the truck so we can prove we're complying with hours of service laws, and this was done on the same computer that we used for messaging the company, GPS, etc. Somehow he expected the computer to just magically know who is driving, so he constantly forgot to switch to his logbook when his shift started. This meant he would log his driving in my book right after I logged 10 hours of driving (law caps it at 11 hours per day) and ignore the lights and alarms warning about an hours of service violation, and I'd get a phone call from a safety manager asking why and how I drove 18 hours in one day. That happened 4 times.       \n\n*It was damn near impossible for the company to reach him because he ignored his phone if he didn't feel like answering it. I even once saw him delete a message on the computer, then pretend he never received it when dispatch called him to ask for a reply. Don't want to answer a question? Just pretend they never asked. It even works if they can see when the message was opened.       \n\n*He was pissed off that they kept sending our 18 wheeler to the ugly parts of the city. \u201cOh I'm sorry. Your next pickup will be shipped from that warehouse on the beach in Miami.\u201d \/s.      \n\n*He was too scared to drive in North Carolina because of the sharp turns on I-40 at the Tennessee state line, which can easily be managed if you stick to the truck speed limit. He took it as a personal insult and tried to chew out our dispatcher every time we got a load going anywhere in that state.      \n\nAs soon as I had a job lined up with a better company, I waited for a load going through my home town. Then I met my brother at a Walmart near my house, threw all of my stuff into his car, and called the office on the way home to say \"I quit. Kevin is on his own\".","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1627802733.0},{"title":"Things my cousin does.","author":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/ova3t2\/things_my_cousin_does\/","text":"My cousin (whos name is actually Kevin) is the single most stupid person i know.

Here are some examples of his weird, weird world:\n\n1: He eats cigarettes after he smokes them, he thinks that if he eats them, he will poo out the smoke later and thus, no lung cancer (he has asthma btw).\n\n2: Kevin has had 6 cars in one year, all of them have been bought for him, all of them he has crashed in the exact same place in my area.\n\n3: He claims that he is directly related to the British royal family, not only is everyone in my family scotish, we decend from Italy as far back as the 1700s.\n\n4: He used to bully people for being fat, he was obese and would break down into tears when people didnt want to talk to him for bullying everyone.\n\n5: Kevin tried to steal my Xbox 360 because i had an achievement on Halo Reach that he didnt. What was this achievement? Beating the game on Legendary All Skulls On.\n\n6: My family keep our sewing machine locked away from him when he visits because he thinks he can grab the needle while its stabbing away at the fabric. He has tried this hundreds of times, he has also been hospitalised by this twice. (He turns the machine on himself to catch the needle).\n\n7: Kevin once fitted a lock to his door and somehow locked himself out of his own bedroom with the key inside. His bedroom doesnt have any other exit besides a window with a 2 story drop.\n\n8: He refuses to play PC games because apparently \"console is better in every single way\", whenever i ask him if his xbox series X is backwards compatible to all pc and console games, has cheaper prices for titles or can be played with multiple different input devices including those made for people with very specific disabilities, he will say no, but insist its better anyway. He turns 22 next month.\n\nI have many, many more stories about Kevin, like the time he called the police on me for saying i was too busy to talk to him because i was \"robbing a bank\", i was playing Payday 2, but ill stop the stories here for now.\n\nIll share more if there is enough interest.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1627748565.0},{"title":"Lived two days in the pandemic with a kevin who wore a facemask he found on the ground","author":"puya191","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/ov4q88\/lived_two_days_in_the_pandemic_with_a_kevin_who\/","text":"I was living in a sharehouse at around August  2020.

I'm just looking for a specific breed. you wouldn't happen to have a Siamese cat, would you?\" yes ma'am. we would most definitely have a purebred Siamese cat at a rescue and adoption center for stray cats.\n\nkevin 3 : a lady called us asking about adoptions, and i quote, if we did home deliveries for the cat and if we had a list (she was trying hard to say menu) of cats which were up for adoption. i'd had a long day and was tired and thought it was a prank call so i responded, \"sure ma'am, would you like your cat cooked or uncooked in addition to that, how finely do you want it diced?\" my boss heard me say that and gave me a look. she was a really chill person and burst out laughing when i explained what happened. turns out the called was very serious and called my boss complaining about me and how rude i was to her.\n\nkevin 4 : a person kept refusing to wash his hands because, \"stray cats are used to living on the streets so their immune system is stronger than domestic cats.\"\n\nI cant remember any more people I've encountered, but if I do, I'll be sure to add it to the list.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1627625540.0},{"title":"My roommate's indoor Olympics","author":"Pidarnahui420","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/oui2po\/my_roommates_indoor_olympics\/","text":"The ongoing Olympics reminded me of what happened last time back in 2018. I was in college and my roommate Kevin was the stereotypical crazy guy. He would piss in buckets and throw them off the 4th floor of a dorm, he would play porn on any unsecured tv, et cetera. But the dumbest thing he ever did was try to recreate the winter Olympics inside. \n\nIt was February 2018 and the winter Olympics had just started, but I was paying it little to no mind as the only sport i like is baseball and it was winter. Kevin, however, was determined to live up the Olympics. I first realized something was wrong when I walked into my dorm to discover a MASSIVE amount of dry ice on the floor, and Kevin standing on it with a hockey stick swinging at his alarm clock because he didn't have a puck. I helped him get rid of the dry ice, but I realized Kevin was going to be doing this shit for a while. \n\nIt's now 2 AM, day 2 of the Olympics coming up. I have a long day of hard work ahead of me in college, but Kevin has a long day of skipping classes and playing winter sports. All of the sudden I jolt awake to see Kevin OPENING THE FUCKING WINDOW (it's Minnesota in February, about 10 degrees Farenheit, -12C). I leap up to stop him, but he's just stuck his head out the window screaming, \"WAKE UP! THERE'S HOCKEY ON TV! WAKE UP!\". Campus security actually comes to check it out. \n\nThe next night i tell Kevin, \"frankly dude i don't have time for your bullshit so stay quiet\" or something like that, but he ignored it. Once again it's the wee hours of the morning when I hear Kevin singing in swedish and watching Kevin spray paint a swedish flag ON MY OWN FUCKING SHIRT.

Then we went around looking for sticks to whittle down to make little spears then we found a pen to write names on our sticks i will not say the names as they are not appropriate. Then an old guy with two dogs went to where those trees were, he looked at the twigs that were on ground and looked at us and said \"you guys like what you did here\" to which we replied \"yeah its like art\"  \"excuse me\" he replied i dont know what he was expecting from two teenagers and we said louder \"yeah its like art!\" he scoffed and walked away then he left about 15 minutes later. Then we went back to the trees then a kevina appeared on her front porch she saw all the branches on the ground and came over to us the conversation went exactly like this and said \"look at the fucking mess you made\" not the best first impression is it? we said \"im sorry what?\" in a very confused tone \n\n\"dont be idiots pretending your confused\" she replied, \"but we are confused\" we replied \"look at the fucking branches on the ground you know what you did\" oh btw we were just teenagers having fun outside we weren't intentionally trying to hurt the trees \"were just teens having fun though\" i replied \"stay right here i'll be back\" we said \"okay\" then she came back with a bag of cheesie puffs and tried to bribe us with them so we would tell her where our parents were so she could talk to them we said \"no\" quite firmly then she replied saying \"eat these fucking cheetos\" we said \"no\" again then she threw the bag on the ground and left i called her out and said \"but you just left a plastic bag on the ground\" then she said \"clean it up yourselves\" we again said \"no\".

I think she fits the Kevin archetype because, if you knew her for two hours, you would start wondering how she managed to survive to this day.\n\nHer name is V. She is the most Kevin person I have ever met, not because she was particularly dense, but because she got everything wrong. Literally everything. There was nothing in her life that she was not messing up. The worst part was, she didn't even realize. Allow me to give you some real life examples, that is, things that I have seen her do\/have heard from her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Her father was abusive towars her family, sometimes physically. She excused him and loved him because \"he's still my dad\". No thought process behind it, just blind acceptance of a terrible situation.\n\n\\-She had no job, didn't go to university, did nothing all day. Literally just sat on her arse playing Fortnite or going for walks with friends. Did I mention she wasn't even 30? She was wasting away her best years not improving in any field, and she was obliviously happy about it. I saw her bringing a half-assed CV to a call center where they told her \"The heck are you doing here? Just send it online like everyone else\". She was just clueless and was happy with it because mama paid the bills.\n\n\\-She played Fortnite all day. Wouldn't even be that bad, except she asked me to play every night, even if I told her from the get go that I absolutely did not like the game. I stopped replying after a while because I really did not want to play and she really did not want to shut up about it.\n\n\\-She was on a \"\"diet\"\". The \"\"diet\"\" was her skipping meals every day and eating fruit for dinner. If you know a thing or two about dieting, you know that this is basically starving your body to death, and the only results you get out of this are a weight gain and a muscle loss, not to mention the loss of appetite since your eating habits are all out of whack. If you told her about the dangers of her \"\"diet\"\", she would laugh and say that she does what she wants. Last time I saw her, despite her marvelous ideas, her physique had gotten worse.\n\n\\-Along with her \"\"diet\"\", she also did physical exercise. Her physical exercise was biking for 10 minutes every two days. Achieved absolutely nothing, but would post stories about it on Instagram.\n\n\\-She littered. Cigarettes, tissues, you name it, she threw everything on the ground.\n\n\\-She only listened to a specific subset of songs, which were love songs written in her regional dialect. I live in a country where dialects are massively different among each other, and these songs, apart from being super bland, were frustrating to hear for folks unfamiliar with them, because you could understand maybe two-three words every two sentences. Of course she blasted these songs all the time in her car, so everyone on the street could be disturbed by the loud noise.\n\n\\-She wanted to be an Instagram model of some sort. Now, if you are into the social scene, you know you have to market yourself in a certain way to rise to \"fame\". Well, she posted the wrong things, with the wrong tags, at the wrong times of the day. Everyone can use social media the way they like, but don't say you want to be a social media star if you are actively sabotaging youself.\n\n\\-Every time she got with someone, she sent an audio to our common whatsapp group telling how awesome it was. In one of the audios you could hear the guy talking in the background. Absolute cringe for days.\n\n\\-She had no interests or hobbies, she did not care about anything. She wasn't even good at Fortnite somehow. The only thing she did once in a while was going shopping to get a lot of expensive stuff using her parents' money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the end, we had an argument because I didn't ask her how she was doing every day. No, I am not joking. We were not that close (I distanced myself after seeing what kind of person she was), and when she got covid, she wouldn't shut up about it. She got an incredibly tame form of it and didn't even have symptoms, but she still expected everyone to feel pity for her.\n\nDid I say that we had an argument? SHE had an argument, I just stood there dumbfounded while she insulted me through message, and told me to off myself. I was working during her tirade so I had just a few minutes every now and then to look at the endless angry messages. I was done with her BS at that point, I made copies of her messages, went to the police, and threatened to bring her to court. She finally stopped.\n\nI felt immediately relieved because I didn't have to be afraid of Fortnite every evening from then on. She kept looking at my social media stories for a while, now she has disappeared for good.\n\nIf you are out there, V, get a clue and stop being dumb in literally everything you do in your life.","upvote_ratio":0.43,"created_utc":1627554839.0},{"title":"Mom is doing your job?

Been a while since I posted but most things have been quiet on the Kevin front at my job lately. This one, however, was a doozie and I couldn't wait to share!\n\nSo I work at a popular Midwestern pizza chain and, one night, we were very busy. Orders were being delivered and picked up at lightning speed and we were all very much in the zone when, suddenly, one of our delivery drivers comes from the back of the store and says, \"Someone is knocking on the back door. What should I do?\"\n\nI'm confused and concerned because that door is very clearly not for public use. Think an unused emergency door behind a section of strip mall with no welcoming sign and a steep hill. I say, \"Well, definitely don't let them in.\" The driver confirms he wasn't going to and leaves on a delivery.\n\nThings start to slow a bit and we start taking phone orders again. I pick up the phone and give my store greeting. This is what followed:\n\nKevina: Hi, I'm with [popular delivery app].\n\nMe: Oh, okay. Just go ahead and come in. We'll hand you your delivery. (Having delivery app drivers assume we'll run the order to their car is a common thing and I assumed that is what this woman wanted.)\n\nKevina: Um, but are you open?\n\n(I'm confused at that because A) I picked up the phone B) Our sign is lit and people are coming in and out and C) I just told her to come in.)\n\nMe: Uh, yes, ma'am.

There are little carnival games and face painting and bounce houses. \n\nMy wife of course gets caught in a conversation so I'm alone at it with my son and Kevin.  They go in a bounce house with 2 other kids and at the end of the five minutes they come out. My son comes out and puts his shoes on.and I look around and can't find Kevin. Then I hear him crying. I turn to find him somehow behind me a good 40 feet from where the kids leave their shoes just out in the line of traffic nearly being trampled. He's got this pathetic whimper and says \"Mr Love, Mr Love my shoe won't go on.\" I kneel down to help him and see that he is trying to put on 2 left shoes. Then I notice that neither shoe is the same. Not the same brand or color or design. I know from habit that he has black slip-ons with the brand on the tongue. He's got one of that brand that is a different color and has an animal pattern and one that is a completely different everything, brand, size and has velcro which he can't operate. As a point of reference all the other boys in their peer group can operate velcro. I drag him back to the bounce house to get his shoes and he's still having a meltdown because he still can't understand why two left shoes, none if which are his will go on his feet, But I track them down and resolve it\n\nI really stayed on him for the rest of the hour and he only had 1 more meltdown. In the end he was very happy because he got his face painted like a ladybug. It was actually a butterfly but if he was happy calling it a ladybug I'm not going to correct him. \n\nMaybe this seems mild but it is just one in a very long chain of events of incurable numbskull behavior that to me can only be explained by the fact that the kid is a Kevin.

Let\u2019s start with the first story.\n\nThis story takes place at my Grandparents cottage. At the cottage, we would of used the fire pit, but we are using a barrel. CK is 9, and decided that he would sneak out of the Bunky (small house with a living room and a bedroom. Nothing else), and put wood into the barrel. Then lit it up. At 11 pm. The logic I think he thought of was: \u201cHey, I could start a fire at 11 without adults watching because why not\u201d? The only reason he was caught was because my Grandma was up at time. I think he was going to try to be a fire bender from Avatar?\n\nOnto the second story:\n\nThis story took place at my moms house. In this story, BK is 10. My uncle is single with an adult daughter. For Christmas, he got me and my brother a PS5 bundle, which includes a pair of headphones.

I'm Kevin. \n\nMy brother loves to ride the four-wheeler around the backroads by our house. Last night, He did just that. When it started to get dark, my dad left in his truck. Then, my sister came inside with a cut foot, so I took care of it. I went through all the bathrooms of the house looking for medicine to put on her foot and knocked on the locked bathroom door. My brother answered and said it wasn't in there. I put the bandaid on her foot after just using hydrogen peroxide. \n\nAnyway, I noticed my mom pacing around the front porch. I went outside to see what was wrong and she asked if I had seen my brother. The memory of just talking to him completely slipped my mind, so I said no. She said he never came back from riding the four-wheeler and dad was going to look for him because it was getting dark. All three of us were calling him and he wasn't answering. Getting increasingly worried, we started contacting neighbors. Dad came back and asked if my brother had come home yet, and we said he hadn't, so he went back out to look again. \n\nWe were about to call the police when my brother frantically runs down the stairs on the phone with dad saying \"I'm right here!\" He wasn't answering the phone because he was in the bathroom. (I swear he's always in there for hours) He's not supposed to have his phone in the bathroom so he left it in his room like he's supposed to. He had gone down the road on the four-wheeler and come back and put it away in the barn like he was supposed to. The only thing he didn't do was tell someone that he was back. \n\nHe was confused that I was worried because I had talked to him, which I had completely forgotten about. \"You spoke to me, Kevin!\" he said. I feel that this was somehow partially my fault... \n\nWe're glad he's ok and mom told him to just check in next time. I can't believe I could forget almost immediately that I talked to him.

Since my last post Houdini has figured out how to use the opening she creates and physics to break open the kennel door, I know I couldn\u2019t believe it either. So one day I\u2019m cleaning, and I look over to her kennel and see she is not only out but her kennel door is wide open, which was strange since I thought I had locked it, so I put her back in and make sure it\u2019s properly locked, but I still have my suspicions so I watch her, and she begins doing her normal routine of going through the opening until I see her push her legs through the bottom of the opening, and too my horror uses the pressure to cause the metal latch locking the door to fail,?and the kennel door to swing open. So I put her in a new kennel which sometimes calms her down (thankfully it worked) and tell my manager what I just saw, and she\u2019s just as exasperated as I am at this dog, so she decides she\u2019s done with this dogs antics and tells us to put a heavy bag of dog food in front of her kennels door. This works for a few days, but just the other day while we\u2019re moving the dogs around, for space for the new dogs coming in. She started chewing on the metal bars to the kennel door. (it\u2019s not fully metal it has a wooden frame and the bars are held to the frame with these zip ties) She managed to break a tooth while chewing on the bars and later that night, she managed to chew through the zip tie things (not sure what they are called) causing the bars to literally fall off. Night shift never told anyone what happened, so when I got in the next day I\u2019m panicking as I see it\u2019s her kennel, and the bars are inside the kennel and there is no sign of the dog I look around the store and she\u2019s nowhere. I later find out she\u2019s fine and that a coworker took her home for the night, until the kennel doors can be fixed since we just got new dogs there wasn\u2019t a free kennel for her.","upvote_ratio":0.9,"created_utc":1626703624.0},{"title":"Village Idiot: the Kevin D'etat and more stories","author":"Spoopyice","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/om19w6\/village_idiot_the_kevin_detat_and_more_stories\/","text":"I'm the first of my family to go to college. My family comes from a tiny town in the Nebraska sandhills, about as close to an uncontacted tribe as you will find in America. Our town had about 800 people, and very rarely did any of them leave at all, let alone move away. Our town revolves around the church and everyone knows everyone else by name for the most part, or at least their families. \n\nI decided to go to college, and left that town forever, but sometimes I still go back to meet with my family. It's then that I receive updates on Kevin, my younger brother. He's 17, I'm 23. I graduated college this summer and have work in the city, but over the 4th of July I visited Kevin. Usually I am told by my parents of Kevin, but this 4th I got to see it myself. \n\nOn the afternoon of Friday the 2nd, I pulled up to my parents' house. We eat dinner and Kevin is behaving for the most part. I catch up with all the small town drama, and my parents make clear they are still irked by my decision to leave. Next, I ask about Kevin. \n\n\"Oh, he bought a bunch of fireworks for this weekend! It's gonna be awesome!\". \n\nFUCK. \n\nIt's Saturday morning and my mother is frying up some eggs when Kevin slides down the stair railing holding a lit orange firework, screaming \"oompa loompa!\" He throws it at the window, which is rattled hard by the small explosion but it's underwhelming given the size of the firework and it doesn't even break the window. Still, awfully dumb. My mom amazingly seems totally unbothered. \n\nBy afternoon we head to the town center for the \"[town] days\" celebration, which is a shitty festival held the day before the 4th so that you can get two days of drinking beer in public and shooting off fireworks in a row. \n\nKevin steals a giant bowl of potato salad from an old woman and runs with it like a football. Apparently in Kevin's mind everyone plays along with him, but in reality we stood in horror as he chucked the glass bowl into the street and it smashed on the cobblestones. \n\nWe leave him alone (TIFU) for the rest of the evening, and he and his friends chill at the town restaurant, but we can tell they're planning something. Unfortunately we're kind of helpless especially given my parents and I were already somewhat cold to each other due to my decision to leave and couldn't get on the same page. So nobody has a plan for his insane 4th. \n\nIt was 7am on the morning of the 4th when Kevin and his friends (7 of them, somehow) are running around the middle of the town with GUNS. EVERYBODY here has guns, but it's even more troubling in the hands of Kevin and his henchmen. They're running around the town square holding rifles. They do this for a few hours and apparently nobody thinks anything of it except me. These are all things that seem normal in small town life. \n\nKevin and his Kevin Krew barge into our house for lunch, which my mom gladly serves up and my dad acts like they're his own friends. At this point I feel like I'm taking drugs, seven dudes with rifles are eating lunch in my house! \n\nKevin then does one of the most idiotic things I've ever seen. He yells to one of his friends, \"hey Josh [fake name]! Have you ever seen me clean my rifle?\". Josh replies, \"no!\" \n\nKevin then *pours an entire fucking jar of pickle juice down the barrel of a loaded gun*. \n\nBut that's not even close to Kevin's amazing stunt that evening. Did you think those fireworks were really just for a wholesome backyard show? Oh no. Kevin shows up to the mayor's house and starts shooting them off. Directly over the mayor's house. \n\nThe mayor (keep in mind this is a small town, we know the mayor) is sleeping in his home when a firework goes through the window. \nThe mayor charges out with a shotgun thinking Kevin and his friends were armed, and he fires a warning shot as they scatter into the bushes, slowly surrendering as they say something to the effect of, \"it's just a prank bro!\". \n\nTo recap, Kevin made the town mayor think someone was attacking his house. But this is far from his dumbest stunt, only his most dangerous one. \n\nLet's go back to a few years ago. Kevin was feeling too warm, so he had a genius idea. Just get ice \"inside the body\". He shoved a bag of ice cubes up his ass. We had to visit the rural hospital when he got a twist tie that was on the bag lodged up his anus. \n\nKevin had an obsession with how \"salami looks like a penis\". To the point where he used \"salami\" as his word for \"penis\". \"My salami hurts\" meant he needed to piss. \"She makes my salami stand\" for an attractive woman. \n\nKevin stated that mowing the lawn was pointless because it would \"just grow back\". \n\nKevin claimed he fucked a goat. To a friend who had a farmer for a dad with goats. He then reassured his friend he didn't fuck THAT goat. \n\nWhat an idiot.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1626515265.0},{"title":"Dumb and Dumber: My Kevin roommates","author":"justiceforharambe49","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/olefm6\/dumb_and_dumber_my_kevin_roommates\/","text":"So, around 10 years ago I spent a couple of months volunteering overseas. Due to rotations in volunteer housing and programs, I kept running into this pair of dudes who were very friendly overall, but quickly gained a reputation for being absolute Kevins. The funny part is that they had gone there together, had been friends since childhood, looked very much alike, and even shared the same first name. So, Kevin A and Kevin B. As they say: Twice the Kevin, double the dumbness.  Everyone called them Dumb and Dumber. For a few months we were actually roommates in a rented apartment, and that\u2019s when they unleashed most of their kevinness upon us. There were 5 of us, with opposing schedules, so we\u2019d usually come home wondering what crazy new situation we\u2019d find. Here it goes:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* They\u2019d come back from work\/parties late at night, and walk past a street that has lots of restaurants and grocery stores. Now, in certain places like these, distributors leave boxes full of products leaning on business doors, so the clerks bring them in when they open. Dumb and Dumber would bring those boxes home because they thought they were \u201cfree stuff\u201d. We tried explaining to them that there is no such thing, but they just didn\u2019t understand. So, once a week or so, we\u2019d wake up to a giant sack of oranges in the kitchen.\n* They\u2019d have horror film marathons on our free nights, scare themselves to death every time and complain about nightmares, then do it all over again two or three days after. They\u2019d take the movies super seriously and spend the next few days following the in-universe rules until they forgot. For example, if they watched Silent Hill, they wouldn\u2019t go out if there was fog, and stuff like that.\n* In one of those movies they learned about Astral projections, so for around two weeks, they\u2019d spend hours in the apartment living room attempting it. After a window slammed once, they got scared \u201cof their own powers\u201d and stopped. We solemnly concurred that it was for the best, since such powers are difficult to contain.\n* Kevin A apparently didn\u2019t know how showers worked, because every time he took one, he\u2019d flood the entire bathroom and half the apartment. We told him to figure it out, and he did for a few days. No floods. Turns out he was using our towels\/laundry to wedge the bottom of the door from the inside, making a fucking pool we\u2019d all then had to empty with buckets. He really thought there was no other way. When we explained that he could slide the shower door to keep water from gushing out, he just shrugged.\n* When getting ready for going out, they\u2019d go into the recently salvaged bathroom and make a huge mess, experimenting with everyone\u2019s products like mad fucking scientists. Of course, they saw no problem in grabbing other guys\u2019 hairgel, cologne, deodorant, etc. and dropping them, mixing them together, or spilling them on the floor. When confronted, they kindly apologized and stole a crate of products from outside a pharmacy to replace ours.\n* They\u2019d leave the TV turned on to the HDMI \u201cblue screen\u201d all day, and complained if someone turned it off. Their logic was that they wanted it on \u201cjust in case someone wanted to watch something\u201d.\n* They\u2019d throw improvised after-parties and bring in people from the street. Like, they\u2019d be drunk coming back home and started inviting random people they saw, usually other drunks. They saw no problem in having complete strangers using our stuff and hanging at our place.\n* Kevin B would try to put metal stuff in the microwave. Pans, utensils, and ramen cups with tinfoil lids. We\u2019d usually stop him since we, well, didn\u2019t want to fucking die, and he found it super annoying. He thought we were the stupidest guys on earth because \u201cit can\u2019t be that bad\u201d. So, we let it happen once, and after we heard shrieks coming from the kitchen, he came out scared af and apologized.\n* They\u2019d experiment with recipes and cook large meals (simple stuff like pasta and rice), make a huge mess, but then forget them over the stove and go eat outside. They would return home and refused to clean up\/wash the pans because \u201cthey didn\u2019t even eat at home that day\u201d. Additionally, when they actually had to clean the kitchen, they\u2019d try to \u201ctrick us\u201d and put all the dirty dishes back in the cabinet instead of washing them.\n* On the other hand, one of the other guys was studying to be a chef, and took cooking very seriously. He\u2019d make fancy dishes to share, but Dumb and Dumber were skeptical. They\u2019d say \u201ctuna croquettes\u201d sounds a lot like cat food, and therefore probably tasted like cat food as well. Chef guy took offense, but it was funny seeing these guys missing out on dinner.\n* They got tired of being called dumb all the time and challenged my other two friends to an \u201cintelligence contest\u201d, where they\u2019d ask them questions they themselves didn\u2019t know the answers to, so there was no frame of reference. The  fact that the other guys accepted the challenge kinda makes them a little Kevin as well. I remember one of the questions was \u201cWho invented the regular plane? Like those where people fly on\u201d. The whole episode was fucking hilarious.\n* We had a long discussion with Kevin B because he thought going to college was a scam and a complete waste of time. After all, none of his family had gone to college (go figure) and he \u201calready knew all there is to know anyway\u201d. Destiny was kind to him, as I ran into him in a business expo and for all I know he owns a small company. Let\u2019s just hope it\u2019s not microwaves and kitchen utensils.\n* We were taken on a trip where we were offered a couple of payed courses. We chose scuba-diving and so did Insane Kevin Posse. They somehow managed to sit through the whole course without learning anything. The instructor, who was a no-chill grumpy old guy, was very worried because he didn\u2019t want to be responsible for these guys drowning or whatever. He was actually the one that named them Dumb and Dumber in the first place. So, on in-water practice day, he\u2019d lost his patience because they were in the diving school van throwing shit around and laughing. They hit him on the head with an empty coke bottle, and you could tell the guy was fucking pissed. We get in the water, and like 3 seconds later both kevins\u2019 equipment starts going crazy, leaking air and not sinking. They both panicked and had to leave the water \u2014 ended up missing practice day entirely. So, either they managed to screw up in less than a minute, or the instructor messed with their stuff to have an excuse to kick them out. Probably saved their lives anyway.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1626432542.0},{"title":"My Ex-Friend Kevin Always Tried To One-Up Me","author":"Pineapple_Forward","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/olthql\/my_exfriend_kevin_always_tried_to_oneup_me\/","text":"What's up guys, gals, and non-binary pals! I'd been listening to StoriesAboutKevin on YouTube and it reminded me of a Kevin I once knew back in high school (quick note - high school in the UK runs from age 11\/12 to 16). I've wrote about him in TalesOfNeckbeards but thought a lot of his antics would fit in here\n\nNow, Kevin (not his real name obviously) and I met when we were 11, at a social skills group for autistic people - yes, we're both autistic. We both happened to be going to the same high school soon, and since said school was known for its good support for autistic students, we encountered each other a lot.\n\nAt first, we didn't get along, but we started to become friends once we discovered we had similar interests, such as watching shows like Drake & Josh and SpongeBob SquarePants. It turned out to be a toxic friendship which I'll explain in this post, but it took me years to realise it. Now that I've gone through a brief origin story of our friendship, here's some of the Kevin stuff he did.\n\n* He absolutely HATED any kind of work. Sure, nobody likes to do work that much. But with Kevin, if you asked him to do any task he didn't like, you were automatically his enemy. I remember all the times he'd complain to be about the 30 minutes of labour he had to do, even if it was important. He'd then rant about the person who asked him to do it.\n* When we had to do work experience as part of a school project, whilst many students did something like spend a week at the office, he just spent the week watching TV and playing video games whilst his mum did all the work for him.\n* He had anger issues that were easily set off. Unfortunately, I was often the target of his frustration. Sure, he never hurt me, but it was always as if it were my fault he forgot to do something like bring something important for school.\n* Adding on to the work thing, he was also rude to people who wanted him to do stuff he didn't see as fun. Like when we were at a youth club, he'd always moan when we were asked to go off the computer and do something like a sport for fun.\n* He seemed to develop a little crush on me, but didn't seem to understand how attraction worked. Back at the time, neither of us had ever had girlfriends. I remember him saying something like, \"I'm tired of never getting a girlfriend, guys like us will never get one. Maybe I should just try going for guys.\" When I pointed out that I cannot just change my sexual orientation, he got offended and asked \"Why not??\" Additionally, pursuing guys doesn't raise the chances of finding a partner....\n* He always tried to one-up me, I don't know if it was because he was insecure or something, but it always bothered me. The first time was when we finished high school, I went to sixth form whilst he went to a community college. For some reason, he seemed to think the fact that he could call professors by their first name, whilst I had to refer to mine as \"Mr\/Ms\/Mrs (surname)\" meant that he was in a better school environment.\n* Another thing he would commonly do to one-up me would be to try and constantly act as if he were the better looking one. I don't really care which one of us looked better, but when he had a girlfriend for a week, he sure loved to point out how he had a girlfriend and I didn't.\n* Another example of trying to one-up me: He would constantly act like him going to community college whilst I was still in \"high school\" (my sixth form college just happened to be ran by my old high school) meant he was smarter. I remember one night he just kept going on and on so I had enough and reminded him I was the one going to university, not him (I don't think university means one is smarter, but I'd had enough at that point).\n* He could never keep a secret. One time I confided in him about a crush I had on a girl in the youth club we both attended and soon after, not only did my crush know, but also my entire school year - and she didn't even attend my school!\n* Things were always someone else's fault, never his. I remember one time he made a really offensive comment to another friend of mine, let's call him Jake. Jake told me how he was never going to speak to Kevin again after the incident and I couldn't blame him. However, Kevin would always lament to me about Jake whenever Jake refused to speak\n\nI'm sure I could go on and on, but I'm sure you get it. Eventually I broke off the friendship as one night my dad accidentally referred to our autism as \"having problems\" (as in like the difficulties we face socialising) whilst driving us, and Kevin responded by slamming the car door hard and flipping the bird. Somehow seeing him behave like that to my dad made me realise being the doormat to his anger and insecurities was not a healthy friendship, and as I was just about to go to university anyway, I cut contact with him. I spoke to a friend some years later who still has contact with Kevin, and apparently Kevin is mad at me for never having time for him and his mother thinks I was rude for never speaking to him again. Whatever. I've had much healthier friendships since where I wasn't the doormat. Anyway, hope you all enjoyed the post!","upvote_ratio":0.87,"created_utc":1626480819.0},{"title":"Kevin, the security guard","author":"bp_on_reddit","url":"\/r\/talesfromsecurity\/comments\/olnqg2\/how_did_he_get_hired\/","text":"","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1626466905.0},{"title":"my sister is a kevina","author":"supermanden123455","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/olc7tn\/my_sister_is_a_kevina\/","text":"she isn't the typical kevina but she has her moments, once she was on our trampoline and she ran inside to tell it was broken in the corner, we have a round trampoline and it was only one of the springs that was of. another time she was sleeping in a tent outside in our backyard, she chose to lock the zipper to itself, then we heard a scream from outside, we then discovered her head was locked outside her tent, it was the funniest thing I have ever seen, she said she couldn't come free, the zipper was locked to itself so it was working as it should. it took her 30min to come free without help.","upvote_ratio":0.68,"created_utc":1626421823.0},{"title":"Kevin can't cook either","author":"dj_magician","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/okb1fw\/kevin_cant_cook_either\/","text":"This one isn't as insane as some of the other posts here, but I still think this is a genuine Kevin experience. I had a roommate for a couple months who was a Kevin, and while I didn't know him too well, the one thing I did see were all his cooking mishaps. Kevin had never washed dishes, and didn't know \\*how to use dish soap\\* until I showed him how. Kevin bought TWO George Foreman grills, because he thought you had to buy the top and bottom halves separately. Kevin would constantly store jugs of juice\/cold brew\/iced tea in the fridge horizontally, without securing the lid properly, ensuring the drink would leak out all over the refrigerator. However, his greatest achievement was his brownies. He wanted to make some brownies for his girlfriend, so he went out and bought one of those Betty Crocker type brownie mixes. When he tried to make it, he insisted that since it was \"instant\" brownie mix, he didn't have to add anything. We tried to tell him that you have to add the water and oil and stuff, but he wasn't having any of it and we were tired of his BS. So he just dumped the mix into the pan as a dry powder and threw it in the oven. He didn't quite start a fire, but he did have to throw the pan away.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1626289026.0},{"title":"Kevin\u2019s actions are just \u201cprecious\u201d","author":"SilentJoe27","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/ojr28f\/kevins_actions_are_just_precious\/","text":"Obligatory I\u2019m on mobile post, so please excuse formatting errors. \n\nYears ago, I worked with a Kevin at a movie theater. Not too many people enjoyed dealing with him. He was grossly incompetent at his job. He would constantly make mistakes, and mess up the till, if he joined me in cleaning the auditoriums after a movie let out , I would have to tell him to pick up trash only while I swept, or he would spend five minutes or more sweeping one spot (and sometimes, he would still try to sweep). \n\nHe would also talk CONSTANTLY whether you wanted to talk or not. Mostly it was incoherent babbling, or it would be a conversation about sports, cars or girls. I\u2019m not big into sports, I don\u2019t care about cars, and I\u2019m gay, so that\u2019s three for three right there. He practically alienated the girls on staff with inappropriate comments (if you saw his Facebook page around that time, he was groping the breast of a nude statue if that gives you any idea). Our GM had a hard time bringing himself to fire people so there was no use complaining to him, and as a local theater, there was no HR.\n\nThings came to a head one night. I had already clocked out hours prior, but that evening, I received a message from another coworker saying, \u201cHey, Kevin got fired! Enjoy.\u201d\n\nCurious to find out what happened, I checked with several other coworkers who were on shift that night. Turns out Kevin had been working the box office that night, and a customer, a heavyset black woman, came up to the box and he called her \u201cPrecious\u201d. Please note this was only about a year or two after the movie, Precious, had come out, in which the titular character is an very overweight black girl, so she immediately starts crying. After a talk with the manager on duty that night, he fired Kevin on the spot. The entire staff meanwhile felt bad for the customer. Even some of the more apathetic ones told her if she wanted to kick his ass, they could pretend to have not seen it.\n\nThe very next day, I was walking to work when I encountered said manager, who was also on his way in. I couldn\u2019t help myself. I had to say, \u201cSo\u2026 \u2018Precious\u2019, huh?\u201d\n\nHe just groaned and replied, \u201cOh god, that. Yeah, he went too last night. I felt bad for that lady too. I thought she was gonna deck him.\u201d\n\nWhen we got to the theater, I\u2019ll give you three guesses as to who tried to show up and come to work like nothing had happened. The manager spent a few minutes yelling at him to get out. To this day, I have never seen anyone that oblivious.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1626216716.0},{"title":"I lived with Mr and Mrs Kevin for 2 years","author":"TheArgyleGargoyle","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/oj8gwd\/i_lived_with_mr_and_mrs_kevin_for_2_years\/","text":"My former roommates are born Kevins.

He is continually amazed when other people can get places faster than him. \n\n- Mrs Kevin asked me one day what two colors mixed together to make orange.  I suggested taking some good coloring and glasses of water to play around and find out, thinking it would be a teaching moment.  She gave up and went to ask her husband. \n\n- Mr Kevin can only cook in the microwave.  Spaghetti, scrambled eggs, everything gets microwaved. He will boil water for tea on the stove though,  so there's that. Of course,  he boils the teabags in the water for 10+ minutes. \n\n- The missus often gets into minor car accidents.  She forgets to check her mirrors or her blind spots.\n\n- When they decided to do a keto diet, Mrs Kevin argued with her husband about whether or not potatoes were carbs.  She insisted that,  \"they're not carbs, they're starshes\"\n\n- I once had to stop the two of them from locking her chihuahua in the closet for a \"time-out\". \n\n-  One day I came home from work to find the missus cleaning the kitchen.

It was bleach and ammonia.\n\n- Mr Kevin got a text one day and he goes, \"huh, Mrs Kevin just sent me a picture of herself holding some kind of animal and I don't know what it is.\" It was a Guinea pig.\n\n- They went on a cruise in the Caribbean.

I\u2019m gonna try and simplify things for non military members, but if I don\u2019t make sense let me know.\n\nThis is about a prior service (means he was enlisted. As in a Private before) Officer who commissioned from a military academy (what\u2019s considered the best kind of school in making officers).\n\nKevin was already weird to begin with. He spoke about all these things that he knew nothing about and was considered insufferable to most people. He would act like he knew all these things, but when asked about it or asked to perform it, he would fucked it up spectacularly.\n\nThis isn\u2019t quite about his poor technical skills though. There\u2019s plenty of it since he was armor officer (tanks). I\u2019ve seen him seriously fuck up basic soldier tasks. This is about him trying to marry a girl he knew for less than a month that was a gold digger. I mean, even Stevie wonder could see through this shit. \n\nBasically my boy Kevin met her and started dating immediately. She pushed hard to get married as all dependas (a unflattering term of spouses who live off military benefits. Hence are labeled \u2018dependents\u2019) do and Kevin ate that shit up. Among privates this kind of behavior is somewhat common. You may have seen various memes of desperate military dudes proposing\/getting married after a week. It\u2019s a meme because it happens with PRIVATES, usually NOT officers. \n\nNow this girl is known around the base we\u2019re  stationed at. She was a serial marry and divorce girl who would steal half of whoever\u2019s shit. So knowing this information Kevin proposes to her. With Kevin being a private before and then going to a prestigious military academy everyone expected absolutely not this. I know officers are immune to this kind of stuff, but this was next level\n\nNow most of his peers weren\u2019t his friend, but watching him do this was like watching a really slow car wreck and it just hurt to watch. So his peers actually staged an intervention confronting her and him. They caught her in a crazy string of lies and blasted away her credibility, but old boy Kevin knows better and can change her!\n\n*clap clap clap*\n\nSo Kevin is still on the path to marry this girl. This shit got so ridiculous and pathetic that it went up to the company commander and the battalion commander (high ranking dude to be put bluntly that usually aren\u2019t involved in this kind of matter) telling him that this is a bad fucking idea. But nope! They don\u2019t know her like he does. \n\n\u201cI love her, sir!\u201d\n\nOne of the guys that she married even called Kevin and said that he got tricked and how she\u2019s just trapping him. But nope! He knows better because he feels the chemistry!\n\nFast forward to today. They\u2019re divorced. \n\nSurprise surprise surprise. \n\nShe took half his shit and now he constantly talks about his \u201cdumbass bitch ex wife tricked him\u201d, but nobody has any sympathy for this fool anymore.\n\nGood people honest to god tried to help kevin from making a giant mistake but he just wouldn\u2019t listen. This was more sad than anything. Kevin isn\u2019t mean or aggressive, but horribly naive. I guess this also serves as a cautionary tale. If a bunch of people are telling you this is a bad idea, then it\u2019s probably a *fucking bad idea*\n\nIf any military members are reading this fucking DON\u2019T marry a stripper or a girl you\u2019ve known for less than a month without a prenup! Talk to your platoon sergeant and if they say it\u2019s stupid, then it is likely stupid.\n\nThanks for reading!","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1626032872.0},{"title":"I don\u2019t think the police do that","author":"SailorKarna","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/oidot0\/i_dont_think_the_police_do_that\/","text":"My first Kevin story.

A couple of her incidents really stick out in my mind. \n\n-She comes into class with a full face of makeup on. It's really poorly done but I wasn't gonna comment on it, because that's an asshole thing to do. But then she turns to me and asks me to give an honest opinion about how her makeup looks.

I CAN DO MY MAKEUP HOWEVER I WANT TO.\" And I'm all like, \"Um...you asked?\". Our other classmates pitched in at this point to tell her that she shouldn't be offended when SHE'S the one that asked. She got huffy and turned away. \n\n-A year later, we're in class and we have a substitute.

Socially they would discuss marches and act interested, only to go behind the patrons backs and buy up as many of the chickens as possible under the guise of taking them \u201cup state to fight\u201d. In reality, they took them to my grandparents small farm where they could lay eggs, free roam and peck around as they saw fit. One of the biggest birds they had was the star of our story, a black and white Asil chicken named Mr Koo. He had apparently been the chicken champion before my uncle Charlie won him in a poker match. On the ride home, Charlie didn\u2019t know how this super aggressive chicken would react in the cab of his pickup. Sure enough, he gets in, plops his butt down and all he heard was a \u201ckooing\u201d sound all the way home. Evidently even champions enjoy the concept \u201cbye bye\u201d. \n\nWhen they got home, Charlie took Mr Koo inside the house to get him cleaned up. Evidently Mr Koo decided at that point he wasn\u2019t leaving. Over the next day he would attack anyone who tried to get him to walk out the door. Yet, as mighty as he was, when the hens started calling and clucking about, Mr Koo decided there were greater things in life than chilling on the couch. He even impressed my grandpa when he actually managed to kill a fox that got into the chicken coop. Not only that, but he barely had a scratch on him. When he was found, he was sitting on the fox like a trophy. When you think about it, technically we had a pet attack chicken. \n\nNow that we\u2019ve caught that up, let\u2019s learn about the Kevin in our story. In Uncle Eddie\u2019s words, Kevin was an idiot. They had worked together at local trucking company. They mainly ran auto parts to Laredo, Texas and back to several locations across the Midwest. \n\nSimilar to the Kevin in the first story, this Kevin was cocky. Yes he could run. Yes he knew well how to operate a truck. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t know how to keep from running his mouth on people. Every time Eddie stopped with him at a diner or some small mom and pop to get fuel, he complained. Got coffee? \u201cPft it\u2019s too weak\u201d. Food? \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let my dog eat that but I guess I\u2019ll have to suffer\u201d. Shower? \u201cWater was too cold and there were spots everywhere\u201d. \n\nFlash forward to the week of the incident we are all here for. Uncle Eddie and Kevin happened to be near the farm and decided to take a week off for a clean bed, home cooked meals and some fishing. As they roll up in the trucks on Sunday, my momma happened to be there. She was barely 18 at the time and Eddie and Kevin were in their late 20\u2019s. Kevin took this as a perfect time to flirt. Eddie, already sick of his BS from the road, slammed him upside his truck. \n\n> Eddie: \u201cNow son I\u2019ve seen you whine and cry for months now. I\u2019ve put up with it. But you get within an inch of her and these chickens will eat good for a while\u201d. \n\n> Kevin: \u201cokay okay, sheesh.\u201d -brushes himself off after Eddie lets him go- \u201cYou have my word\u201d. \n\nThey shook on it, and proceeded inside. Kevin of course had a retort. \n\n> Kevin: \u201cBesides, chickens don\u2019t even eat meat\u201d. \n\n> Eddie pointed toward Mr Koo, who happened to be glaring a hole in Kevin: \u201cTell that to him\u201d.\n\n>Kevin: \u201cPft, just throw a fox in there with him and you\u2019ll see who\u2019s the meat eater\u201d\n\nMomma had walked up and given uncle Eddie a hug at this point and heard what Kevin had said, and laughed \u201cWell considering he killed the last one, I think they\u2019re all afraid to come around anymore.\u201d\n\nKevin\u2019s eyes got big as Mr Koo still glared at him from the yard. Dinner that evening was a great time. According to Uncle Eddie and Momma, my grandma went all out with all the \u201cfixin\u2019s\u201d as we call it. Having had 4 kids, she still cooked for an army so there was plenty to go around. As for Kevin\u2019s complaints? Grandma shot it him down. As soon as they sat down, she led the table in a simple prayer, which included the line \u201cand we are going to remain grateful for the food we have received\u201d while giving him a quick glare. \n\nMonday morning comes and goes with everyone sleeping in, except grandma of course. She\u2019s up with the chickens, tossing seed and other small bits from dinner the night before. Eddie wakes up and strolls over to the bathroom to handle his morning business. Upon returning to his room, he notices his drawer where his wallet was kept had been left ajar. \u201cStrange, hmm\u201d he thought, but grandma appeared behind him. \n\n> Grandma: \u201cNow I done went through ya wallet and didn\u2019t see no money. You got a savings account?\u201d\n\n> Eddie: \u201cYes, ma\u201d\nGranny glared at him with that look she has had for years. Think of that meme of Fry from Futurama, only an older southern belle with the sass of Sophia off the Golden Girls. \n\n> Eddie: \u201cYou said I didn\u2019t have any money in there though? I could have sworn I had at least $40\u201d. \n\n> Grandma: \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything, but you might have gotten better at hiding things though\u201d.\n\nThey hugged, Grandma told Eddie it was nice to have him home for a bit and they parted ways through the house. About this time, Kevin stepped out of the bathroom. \n\n> Kevin: \u201cSo you\u2019re missing money?\u201d\n\n> Eddie: \u201cSo you\u2019re eavesdropping?\u201d\n\n> Kevin: \u201cHey man, I just didn\u2019t want you to think it was me.\u201d\n\n>Eddie: \u201cDid I say it was you? No? Okay then. Now get your head out of your a** and come help me get this fishing gear together.\u201d\n\nThey got the pick up truck loaded up and headed to the far end of the land where our local river had an amazing little beach. When they arrived, some of the local women were down stream about 100 yards swimming. Kevin took this as his perfect time to make a move, despite Eddie telling him not to. \u201cI got this\u201d he says. Yeah. He got over there, one of the girls boyfriend happened to be a guy Eddie knew had previous boxing training. So what does Kevin do? He runs his mouth. Eddie tells it like this. \n\nHe glanced over at Kevin while tying his hook to his line. He hears Kevin say \u201cSo? What are you gonna do about it punk?\u201d, he hears a loud thwack, and Kevin on his back in the sand. Dude stood over him, fist balled up ready to hit him again when his girlfriend grabbed him. They get their things and leave. Uncle Eddie proceeded to finish baiting his hook and cast his line, take a seat, crack open a cold beer and enjoy himself. Kevin is still 100 yards down stream laying on his back for another 5 minutes or so. He mouths off something toward the group as they\u2019re leaving, then noticed Eddie kicked back on the bank. \n\n> Kevin, at the top of his lungs: \u201cAINT YOU GONNA HELP ME?!!!\u201d\nEddie just looked at him and took a drink of beer. Kevin gets himself cleaned off and comes back over to where Eddie was. Kevin starts to say something but Eddie cuts him off \n\n> Eddie: \u201cIt will serve you best to keep it in your pants while you\u2019re here. If you can\u2019t, go ahead and hit the road. I ain\u2019t your keeper. You\u2019re welcome to stay but I ain\u2019t saving you.\u201d\n\nKevin didn\u2019t say another word about it. By the next morning, they rolled in with a whole mess of catfish for dinner. My grandma had breakfast ready for them. They washed up, ate breakfast and decided to take a couple hour nap. After everyone got up, they went out on the porch before dinner was ready. Mr Koo was pecking around the base of the steps when Kevin kicked a small stone from the porch at him. Mr Koo glared at him. \n\n> Eddie: \u201cYou do that again and he\u2019s gonna attack you\u201d\n\n> Kevin: \u201cYeah whatever, it\u2019s just a stupid hen\u201d and proceeds to do it again. \n\nUncle Eddie said it was like something from the freaking Matrix took over Mr Koo. When the stone was near him he jumps up and over it, wings flapping and talons out going straight for Kevin. Not quite having time to process this Rambo fowl\u2019s fury, he begins to laugh, only to turn it into a \u201cOH SH\u2014\u201c as he trips out of his rocking chair to run inside. Mr Koo is right on his ankles. He claws at his jeans and his boots while pecking at his calf muscle. Luckily Kevin throws him back long enough to get inside the screen door. \n\n> Kevin: \u201cHa now, ya stupid bird\u201d -kicks the bottom of the screen door-\n\n> Grandma, carving knife in hand: \u201cYou kick my damn door like that again and I\u2019ll show you a stupid bird\u201d. \n\nUncle Eddie had picked up Mr Koo and took him to the other side of the house and came in the side door. \n\n\u201cEddie honey, your friend here is about to get it if he kicks my door again. I ain\u2019t saying it again. Now y\u2019all come in here and get some of this fish\u201d\n\nKevin just looked around with a scowl. Not much was said over dinner, but Kevin finished early and excused himself to bed.  Very early that next morning, everyone is woken up by a thunderous crash inside the hallway.  Thinking grandma had fell, Eddie ran outside to find Grandma standing over top of Kevin with a frying pan. \n\n> Eddie: \u201cMomma what happened, what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\n> Grandma: \u201cI caught this one here was rummaging through my chest of drawers I keep in the hall closet. That\u2019s where I always keep my jewelry and some emergency money.\u201d\n\nSure enough, Kevin had a pair of earrings in the floor next to his hand. He had just started to come to when Uncle Eddie punched him as hard as he could. \n\n> Eddie: \u201cSo I bring you here as a token of friendship and you steal off me and my family? Nah you\u2019re gone\u201d\n\nEddie went into the room Kevin was staying at and went through his bag. Inside he found the $40 dollars he was missing, he found a disposable camera, 2 other pairs of earrings and a small gold chain necklace my great grandfather had given my grandma. All in all it might have been worth a couple hundred at best but it was the principle behind it. \n\nMy grandma just collected her belongings, put everything back as it was and placed Kevin\u2019s bags outside. Uncle Eddie drug him outside until he woke up. He immediately tried to swing on Eddie but ended up tripping himself. As he got up, Mr Koo came close. He proceeds to punt Mr Koo toward his truck. Uncle Eddie wanted to run after him again, but my grandma stopped him. Instead of threw his bags at him. Kevin opens his bags to check for a rag to clean up the blood on his busted lip, when he notices the missing goods.\n\n> Kevin: \u201cHeh, it was just a bunch of useless costume jewelry anyway, I ain\u2019t worried about it\u201d. \n\nHe opens his driver side door, and gets the truck started to warm up and inflate the air tanks. He then takes his bags over to his passenger side. My grandma then notices Mr Koo hopping up on his bottom step, then his top step, then as he shut the passenger side door he hops in the cab.   \n\n> Grandma: \u201cDid you jus\u2014\u201c\n\n> Eddie: \u201cYup\u201d\n\nA sly grin comes across their face as Kevin flips them off and hops in the cab. As he catches 3rd gear he begins to swerve historically. His trailer is tipping hard while his truck slams into a large rock. He then rolls off to the left and into a small creek embankment. The door opens, and Kevin staggers out of the truck and lands on the ground. A few moments later, Mr Koo casually struts out of the cab, onto the step, flogs at Kevin on last time before doing that characteristic \u201cpeck walk\u201d chickens do back toward the house. \n\nThey ended up calling 911 because they figured between a frying pan, a hard right hook, a severe chicken flogging and a truck wreck he may need medical care. When the police showed up, he demanded Mr Koo be put down. The cops laughed at him, especially once they heard our side of the story. According to Uncle Eddie, the company they ran for let him go due to the accident. He also ended up with over 50 stitches from the cuts and pecks he got. Mr Koo on the other hand got all the chicken feed and worms his heart could desire. He also got a vet visit to ensure Kevin didn\u2019t do anything major. The vet actually laughed and said he probably jumped with the kick and was basically doing a chicken version of the Bob and weave. \n\nMr Koo lived another 8 years after all this. He often spent time either chasing hens, dogs, cats, rando\u2019s who would come up on the porch asking for stuff. All the like. To this day, Uncle Eddie still misses his pet attack chicken.","upvote_ratio":0.99,"created_utc":1625703196.0},{"title":"Kevin and the Newborn Rocks","author":"SweetSouthernBreeze","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/ofzl0s\/kevin_and_the_newborn_rocks\/","text":"The kevinest Kevin I've ever known was my stepfather's brother-in-law. Kevin was in his sixties when I first met him, and I don't know how he had actually made it that far in life. There are many stories about him, but there is one that just stands out in my mind.\n\nMy stepfather, mom, and me were helping Kevin with a garden. The first day, my stepfather plowed the ground, while Mom and I were throwing out the rocks. It was really rocky ground.\n\nThe next day we were dismayed to see how many rocks were still in the garden. Mom made a comment about it seemed like there were more rocks today then there had been the day before, and Kevin overheard.\n\n\"That's because there are more,\" he said.\n\nI was confused and asked what he meant. Looking rather confident, he said, \"The rocks had babies.\"\n\nAt this point, I thought he had to be joking, so I said that it does seem like that sometimes. Kevin was not laughing, however, and he repeated his assertion that the rocks had had 'babies' the night before.\n\nMy stepfather heard all this, and he pulled Mom and me aside. He told us that Kevin was 100% serious. My stepfather had heard all this before, and he explained that Kevin genuinely believed rocks reproduced.\n\nThe rest of the day, Kevin decided to educate us about the mating habits of rocks. It was hard not to laugh, but it did give us a story to tell.\n\nUPDATE: A few of you are wondering how Kevin thought rocks reproduced, so I figured I'd explain a bit more. He thoughts rocks could move, but they only could move a little and only at night. This was his explanation as to why you never saw it. He didn't  go into more graphic details as to how they actually mated though.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1625717267.0},{"title":"A rose by any other name is still Kevina","author":"Midas-toebeans","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/ofs2ng\/a_rose_by_any_other_name_is_still_kevina\/","text":"Years ago, I was part of an online writing group that also included young Kevina.

We ask her what kind of flower it is and she says she doesn't know, but she'll send a picture.  The picture was of a Hyacinth.

He started out great, but his behavior started to turn from laziness to outright malevolent stupidity. \n\nKevin was one of those cooks who, instead of unwrapping a plastic-wrapped container, would just punch a hole through the top and leave it that way. You can easily get plastic in peoples' food and the health department will absolutely write you up for doing this. I reminded him countless times not to do it, but every time he'd get so much as a salad, he'd act like we were in a huge rush and do it again. I'm sure he convinced himself that he'd take care of it later but he'd forget every single time and I'd find it and have to give him the same talk. \n\nA common theme of Kevin's work ethic is that he'd try to take shortcuts that he thought I wouldn't notice. He would make an absolute mess during his prep work if I wasn't monitoring him. But then I'd come in the next day and find tons of evidence of his utter laziness. \n\nKevin would prep a lot of our sauces and most of the time, they went even remotely close to the way they should have come out. Bechamel sauces that should have been on the thick side and were supposed to be rich and flavorful ended up as basically... milk. I'd ask him \"what the fuck happened to your sauce?\" And he'd always respond that he followed the EXACT recipe in the book. Well here's the thing, Kevin. If you followed the exact recipe IT WOULDN'T LOOK OR TASTE LIKE THIS. \n\nAny time there was something on the prep list as *optional if you have time* he would just cross off, then ask to leave early. \n\nOn certain days when I wasn't opening, Kevin was responsible for starting the fire in the pizza oven. This is an involved process. You stack fire logs in a Lincoln-Log structure and stuff the bottom with cardboard and newspaper. We always had tons of cardboard and newspaper around. If, say, you show up late and need to get it blazing faster, we keep a bottle of super cheap vegetable oil which you can use. \n\nThen I heard rumors about what Kevin was doing in the mornings he opened in my absence. He was taking our CLEANING RAGS, dousing them in EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL, and using them to start the fire. Our kitchen rags are not only super important and valuable, but our cleaning service CHARGES us for every one that's missing and has to be replaced. EVOO is not only more expensive, but LESS effective at this particular application because of its low smoke point. It doesn't burn as hot. \n\nAnd on top of all of this, several people saw him do it and warned him that what he was doing was incredibly stupid. And he would say \"don't worry about it just don't tell u\/dreadway90\". When two different people told me about it, I went to the GM and we had the biggest rage-laugh of our lives watching camera footage of Kevin doing this. \n\nI called Kevin and told him that despite the GM and I being furious with him, that he wasn't fired and that his pay rate wouldn't be cut. However, his hours per week would be cut from 40 to 30. So we could have on someone who, ya know, doesn't do dumb shit like that. He whined and bitched but he agreed. \n\nUntil the next day. I had planned a nice day off with my mom, who was leaving the country for two weeks the day after. He informed me that he had no choice but to resign immediately so that he could find a better job. I pleaded with him to just give me ONE day. I tried to explain to him that not putting in your two weeks notice is a really bad look. But he said \"it doesn't work that way! Most restaurants want you to start immediately!\"\n\nI left that job for a couple years and they hired him back.

Kevin, once again getting his ideas from TikTok, tried to cut out the middle part of the pizza to save for himself, like Richard Watterson Style. Kevin was caught immediately and given a second chance. He was then caught doing the same thing the next day. He got fired\n* Kevins parents signed him up for guitar lessons. Kevin sat on the guitar and broke it.\n* Kevin lack of geography skills is legendary. Unlike most of his classmates, who at least have a basic grasp of European countries and city's, Kevin is completely useless, no matter how many times it is explained to him. He thinks Europe was the capital of Paris, Antarctica is in Russia, Africa is a city and much more\n* Speaking of geography, Kevin thinks that Switzerland is an island. He lives in Switzerland. He goes on holidays to Italy by car every summer. Yet he is adamant that Switzerland is an island, no matter how many maps are shown to him.\n* Kevin thought Cars was based on a true story\n* Kevin believes in aliens, and frequently sends pictures and videos of '' UFOs'' he spotted on the class groupchat. These usually of airplanes, helicopters, stars and on a few occasions, streetlights.\n* He was convinced that his house was haunted, so he hid in his kitchen at night with his phone to film the ghost. At 6 am, he saw a figure, panicked, and threw his phone at the figure. It was his older sister getting ready for work. Kevin broke his phone.\n* He somehow got hired as a cashier for a supermarket. In Switzerland, there are two major supermarkets, Coop and Migros. He got hired at Coop and was supposed to start the next day. He then went to the local Migros and tried to start working until a manager told him to go away. He then did this the next day. Unsurprisingly, he got fired from Coop for not showing up.\n\nThis is all I can really remember right now, I might post more after the summer holidays when I see him again","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1625560109.0},{"title":"My brother is a total Kevin","author":"Feeling-Tourist-3512","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/of1auv\/my_brother_is_a_total_kevin\/","text":" So my brother(14m)took this IQ test seven years ago and his IQ was supposed to be really high. but he has no common sense and he\u2019s an idiot. but because the IQ test was high he thinks everybody else is below him and that everything that he says is right and it makes for some pretty stupid words.

As an international study course people from all around the world (mostly Germans an Swedes) there was an open and including culture on campus (all before covid).\n\nHowever, our little study group was perhaps the dumpster for some of the students that didn't really fit anywhere else - this was due to our smaller than average group size. I made two close friends there and we didn't really socialise much with the rest (got better in later semesters). Most in our study group fit that \"weird, but lovable\" trope, with maybe some creepyness(I don't even know which Reddit Forum I would post the creepy guy), annoyance, friendliness and fun thrown in. The person I am about to speak today is the most friendliest, happiest person you and I will ever meet.\n\nNow University is not a place you would expect a Kevina, especially not abroad in a country she has never been, doesn't speak the language of or has no connection to. But not only was she going to study medicine, but also started a month late. This did not raise any red flags, as our group was still disjointed in the early days and we got some new faces in the preceeding weeks - and maybe the admission process took just longer - who knows? Honestly, I didn't know. I didn't care. I remember something about her and her father(not sure how much involved he was in the admission process) not understanding the uni starts a month earlier than the unis in most countries? Not sure who messed up there - I never met her father.\n\nIn the first week she was there with us, she obviously joined the rest of the study group to the cheap restaurant across the street from the Uni. The few first things I learned from her came from this restaurant visit. She had just graduated (within the last year) and this was her first time being without her parents etc. So far, nothing out of the ordinary. She told us that so far she has not cooked for herself since arriving here. That's fair - money for delivery\/restaurants were no problem for her and insecurity about cooking isn't uncommon if you are without any prior experience. You might have noticed how much I am trying to give her plausible deniability.\n\nBecause the flow of the conservations led to her telling us how she attempted to cook some rice.\n\nShe comes from a Asian country known for rice consumption (India) - but she was young, had no prior cooking experiences etc. No big deal. I would have to look up minutes, water content, etc. myself back then (at her age\/experience level that is - now I know). No amount of Kevin stories can immunise you against the surprise\/confusion you will have once you hear a story like hers in person: you would be like - \"huh? but, why?\". Now, when a normal person wants to cook some rice but has no idea how - asking for help or googling a tutorial might be the sensible and correct thing to do. She has her iPhone - she surely is be able to do this. But no, she explained how she put rice in a pan - no water, not even oil, nada. She burned her dry rice black. Yeah. Understandable how that would make it easier to order food delivery. I didn't really think much of it except for it being a funny story a person could have in a lapse of mind, or during ignorant first attempts at cooking - I have some funny stupidities in my cooking history as well.\n\nExcept for the occasional class participation I didn't have many interactions with her, I kept mostly to my small circles of friends and wasn't interested in expanding it too wide.\n\nDuring our First Aid test we then had to show that we know how to do chest compressions. She was among the last to perform - so had plenty of people to imitate if she so wanted. But it was a test under direct supervision of the teacher - benefit of the doubt is given, nervosity is a thing after all. She forgot all the things: no call for ambulance, no checking of consciousness and\/or breathing (as far as I remember) and chest compressions starting at the stomach area... The teacher corrected her a bit, but after a while I was wondering if she lets her compress until \"the ambulance she didn't call arrives\". Either not or she gave up after a while. Well, the course was very lenient and I assumed at first she was given a pass - but it later turns out she didn't. She was the only one of the class and possibly the semester that failed the First Aid class. There is also a theoretical\/written part, but the teacher wasn't in the room so cheating was a given. No one cared for First Aid enough to study properly. (I already had 3 first aid courses in the 24 months before that and had no intentions to learn it again.) It is possible that she was given a pass for the chest compressions but failed the written part - idk.\n\nThis is about the extent I learned of Kevina's moments - until over the course of the next semester I learned more details. I was opening up a bit more to the other students in my study group - we had lost most of the \"dead weight\" and were now a study group with good enough social cohesion and unity. (Dead weight were like people who only attended 3-4 classes the entire semester, had only one course with us, ghosted us in the third month etc. \/ Again, we were the dumping ground for such students.) In a social event I ended up talking to one in my study group (let's call him Ivan) who had more stories to tell about her. Oh boy.\n\nWell, first of all there is a sequel to her cooking attempts. Now I'm trying to retell the story as accurate as I am able to. I have heard the story once from Ivan and once from her as I once came across her in the mensa (she repeated the first semester, was not in my study group anymore). Sometimes after her first failed attempt she tried again. She had learned from her burned corpse of incinerated rice that water is needed to cook it. He told me, that she did not remove the plastic the rice came in (plausible deniability: some rice can be nought in these packages and maybe she just made a mistake or his retelling is sorta inaccurate), but that somehow translated in her cooking breaking the pot itself. (This is more likely a product defect than her cooking). She did confirm that the lid of the pot was cracked - and she sort of took blame for it? Something in her expression was there that makes me think she believes having done a lapse of judgement the plain story didn't convey properly.\n\nI'm not sure if I have ever broken a pot\/pan, but I wouldn't think twice over it. Probably happened to me already and I just forgot about it. Accidents happen, products can be faulty - irrelevant and in no way indicative of her Keviness.\n\nOther stories Ivan told me: In the chat Ivan had with her they were talking on how to ride from the Uni to the Hospital (First Aid classes). She mispelled \"tram\" as \"tramp\", which was a funny mishap, until he noticed that is how she pronounced it as well. I still call the tram tramp now, one of my favorite inside jokes. Well, it is not the tramp, but the bus that goes directly from Uni to the hospital. But she seemingly did not understand it. She kept asking him \"when does the tramp come?\" (he appearently didn't correct her on the tramp thing - or if he did, he failed) and him answering \"we are taking the bus, not the tram\". Fed up after repeated questions Ivan went full meme and said pointing both hands at the road: \"BITCH DO YOU SEE RAILS?\" ok, unwarrented (but funny) outburst aside - she didn't let that stop her. But now understanding they are waiting for a \"Bus\" thing. She didn't know what a bus was. Okay... She then proceeded to ask him repeatedly for any unordinary larger vehicle (even cars) if that was their bus. (It was a major bus station tho, I don't understand how he struggled to explain it to her??? Honestly, half of this probably comes from \\*his\\* inpatience with her, not her Kevina antics.)\n\nShe also went through 3 iPhones in her first semester. She has a spare one ready in case one breaks. Daddy\/Mommy pays. These individual phones have probably seen more screen use than my singular phone that semester - and I'm a Youtube addict.\n\nEDIT TO ADD: Alright, I talked to Ivan he told me stories I forgot about.  First two corrections:\n\n1. I might have confused the Rice story regarding the plastic bags. It might be not two different stories after all from what I can guess (he wasn't there when she told the first rice cooking attempt story). The plastic bags were likely a part of the first story. Which makes her first attempt even worse: she burned rice plastic bags without water or oil in the pan - burned plastic ain't nice.\n2. The Tramp Story happened \\*after\\* not before First Aid. He was also not in the mood to explain to her what a bus was therefore didn't even bother. After First Aid wanting to go back to the Hostel the questions about the Tramp and the \"Bitch do you see rails?\" was uttered.\n\nNow to new stories:3. Ivan said there is a proverb \"too dumb to boil eggs\". Well...First time is hard for everyone. Boiling Water? Check. Eggs? Check. Nothing out of the ordinary After 10 min Ivan asked about the eggs. Ten. Minutes. He figured, well they will be hard-boiled now, but still edible. She refused: \"No, it's not doen yet.\" - \"What\/Why?\" - \"The shell is still there.\" - \"But you are supposed to peel it off after...\" - \"No, it's fine.\" - \"Ok, whatever\". Well, after 20\/30 minutes of cooking Ivan who left the room came back and said \"the eggs are mush now, just coming out of the shells mush\". She said \"Okay, then they are done now.\"Suprise surprise: she didn't like those eggs.\n\n4.She orders Hamburger, takes a bite and decites she doesn't like the meat. Takes out the patty, eats the rest. Well, maybe she has never eaten one before. (Ivan doesn't believe she never had a burger before.)  At another place food is ordered and she asked if they can order a burger for her. The same thing happens again: takes a bite, doesn't like beef, throws it away.\n\n5. On a trip to the supermarket Ivan met up with Kevina. She needs to buy food. Ivan is already annoyed for her inviting herself to his immediate surroundings, but she has a right to buy food he reckons. She asks where Chicken is and he gives her directions. Well, she eventually comes back with a food product (he doesn't remember exactly what it was, but it wasn't chicken) and asks: \"is this chicken?\". No. She comes back with a portion of chicken breast. It has a chicken drawn on the wrapping. \"Is this chicken?\" Well, yes? FFS Kevina, leave me alone I want to shop.\n\n6. I already mentioned her parents just throwing money at her and missing half the time. Well, Credit Cards when used abroad typically have a fee. She bought something for 4\u20ac. The Fee was 20\u20ac.\n\n7. She used a Russian Tinder rip-off (Badoo?) and was chatting with 3(?) men. One of them was Russian so she asked Ivan to chat for her - but she became paranoid and clawed into his hand. Ivan goes fuck it, gives the phone back. New boyfriend comes to the city, Ivan met him and first thought he was older than the new boyfriend, but nope - new guy is 10y older than her. They have been a couple for 2y now. Either he is like her, likes her enough to not care and\/or loves her for her parent's money. Ivan does not know, but is happy not to be her object of desire anymore. Yes, Kevina was into Ivan for a long time. He was not into her.\n\nEDIT OVER.\n\n(Edit2: I removed a part that in hindsight I believe is just not appropriate or that relevant, it's just too sad and really shouldn't be in public I think. I was trying to hard give as many examples as possible but it's better to keep this post on the funnier\/positive side.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI do have a really negatice opinion about her family tho. They are either as compromised as her or do not like her enough to be decent parents. Sheltering a kid to the point she doesn't know how to cook and ride a bus is bad enough, but to then just send her away across the continent into a high demanding academic pathway without any restrictions or warnings about dangers she might encounter? I honestly think they just want to boost her profile \"she studied some medicine abroad\" and marry her off or something. (They are wealthy enough for that to be a viable strategy.) I don't know enough about Indian culture or society to make such statements, I only see what their parenting resulted in - their motives are irrelevant for me.\n\nKevina is to this day the friendliest and happiest person I have met and conversed with. I hardly doubt anyone can take that gold medal from her. (She is only rivaled by one psychiatric patient I interacted with, but that is a different story.)","upvote_ratio":0.58,"created_utc":1625570446.0},{"title":"An entry about biology","author":"FailingUpwardsInLife","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/StoriesAboutKevin\/comments\/oe60q9\/an_entry_about_biology\/","text":"In my extended family, as in most, there's a Kevin, who's married to a Kevina. You know, the regular stuff.. Unfortunately, I can't tell many stories about them, as I don't meet them often, and my brain developed a spam filter because of them. But one story is so wild, so Kevin like, than I think I'll remember this bs till the day I die.\n\nKevin and Kevina are 70ish years old, and they have two daughters and four grandkids (who are my cousins). That means that, luckily, I don't share any genetic material with them.

Although, in this case, anyone (I hope) would be able to see that Kevin is, oh, so wrong.\n\nAfter he had a couple of glasses of wine, Kevin started loosening up and talking. He often likes to \"put me in my spot\", my guess is because he has an inferiority complex that a 18yo is already more successful than he ever was. So after a couple of drinks, he spots me, and calls me. My brain lits up with red warning flags, but seeing as how I'm an atheist, argument loving pos, I put on a smile and answer \"yes?\". But nothing prepared me for what's about to come.\n\n\"Hey FailingUpwardsInLife, you know evolution?\"\n\"Yes...\" Oh no\n\"So you know how people say that humans evolved from monkeys?\"\n\"Yes...\"\n\"So that's only half true. If you look at monkeys, they're hairy. And if you look at men, they're also hairy, and have body hair. That's proof that men evolved from monkeys. Women, however, don't have body hair. So they evolved from aliens.\"\n... What? I couldn't even say a word. This Kevin has a wife, two daughters, as well as one female granddaughter. How can he think that women have no body hair?? Also, how can men and women be different species??\n\"Actually,\" I try to put some sense into him, but he cuts me off.\n\"I know, it's hard to believe. But it's true! I also have proof\"\n\"Proof? What is it?\"\nNow, I'm a logical person. If he presents me with some concrete evidence I might even consider this... Lovely theory. But no.\n\"Women are very different from men. For example, women can multi-task, while men can't\".\nSeriously? That's your proof??\n\nI spent about 10 minutes trying to explain how evolution works, and that this isn't doctor who, different species can't reproduce. But all for naught.

Once again, 100% kudos to Strongbadjr for opening this can of worms. So here we go!\n\nAs I mentioned before, I come from a family that is deeply rooted in the trucking industry. This story is from my uncle Eddie who was the dispatcher for a decent sized dump truck and equipment hauling outfit near our home town. The Kevin in this story was a new hire with nearly zero dump truck experience. Now it may seem like dump trucking is easy, and once you\u2019re used to it, generally, it can be. Yet anyone who has operated a dump truck for any decent length of time will tell you an experienced operator is invaluable. \n\nKevin was the son of a friend of the boss with about 3 years over the road experience. While he did know how to get from point a to point b and back, he was hard headed when it came to instruction. On his first day, Uncle Eddie had assigned Kevin ride with Joey who was a 5 year veteran with the company. By lunch time, Joey was back at the yard asking that Kevin get off his truck. Uncle Eddie walked out where Joey stood with two other men and asked what the issue was. Evidently, Kevin saw fit to fart in the truck every time it would hit a bump, then proceed to laugh hysterically. Uncle Eddie just let out a snort, as did the other men. Joey didn\u2019t find this funny at all and threatened to call the main boss. Kevin was removed from the truck and put under the patient wing of an older gentleman named Frank, who thankfully, lost his sense of smell in Vietnam. \n\nFlash forward a year and Kevin is still attempting dump trucking. When at all possible, Uncle Eddie puts Kevin on extremely simple tasks. Need 8 loads of dirt dumped in this large field? Done. Need gravel dumped in one big pile? Done. Anything else, Kevin complained. On one job, Eddie had him follow Frank down with a load of sand to spread across a spot on the ground for a pool. The entire time Kevin was on the phone with Eddie, groaning about everything. Keep in mind, this was a 30 year old man.\n\n&gt; Kevin: \u201cEd, Franks driving too fast\u201d \n\n&gt; Eddie: \u201cokay, Kevin\u201d\n\n&gt; Kevin: \u201cEd, Why can I just dump dirt?\u201d \n\n&gt; Eddie: \u201cWe need you on this job Kevin\u201d \n\n&gt; Kevin: \u201cyeah but I don\u2019t want to have to\u201d\n\n&gt; Eddie: \u201cHate it for you, Kevin\u201d\n\n&gt; Kevin: \u201cI\u2019ll call the boss and he will yell at you\u201d\n\n&gt; Eddie: \u201cwouldn\u2019t be the first time, won\u2019t be the last\u201d\n\nThe next day, Kevin goes straight to the boss\u2019s office. He comes out with him in tow, and approaches the window where Eddie put his dispatch orders. \n\n&gt; Bossman: \u201cEd, Kevin tells me you were mocking him and have previously made fun of him with others. Is this true?\u201d\n\n&gt; Uncle Eddie, toward Kevin: \u201cFirst off, how is me needing you on a job mocking you? And second, when exactly did I make fun of you?\u201d \n\n&gt; Kevin: \u201cWhen you put me on a job that\u2019s clearly below me, then saying I hate it for you when I simply voiced my concerns wa-\u201c\n\n&gt;  Uncle Eddie cut him off \u201cYou do realize this past year I\u2019ve had to go out of my way to ensure you had the simplest of jobs, right?\u201d\n\n&gt; Kevin: \u201cNo you didn\u2019t but whatever. You still made fun of me with Joey when my tummy hurt\u201d\nBoth the bossman and Eddie looked at each other and back at Kevin. \n\n&gt; Eddie: \u201cTummy? Really?\u201d\n\n&gt; Bossman: \u201cI\u2019ve heard enough. Just let me know if we have any further issues.\u201d\n\nUncle Eddie said at that point, he knew he was definitely going back over the road. Office drama, stupid customers and whiny drivers moaning about their \u201ctummies\u201d made him realize how bad he had the itch. Besides, he had just the perfect job for Kevin before he left; Ms Karen. (Obviously not her name). \n\nMs Karen (MK) was notorious among the drivers for being, well, a Karen. She was the owner of several acres of real estate and often sought the services of the company for her dump trucking needs. She had recently made her biggest investment yet, a 3 building, 3 story apartment complex. It was touted as having all the amenities: Pool, a gym, in home laundry, basketball and tennis court. It was really going to be top of the line. \n\nDuring the final days of construction, all of the electrical and internet lines were attached to the buildings. At the same time, the company was also helping to pave the parking lot. Anyone who has worked on or near a paver can attest how hot this work gets. Kevin was placed on the final crew to finish the last end of the parking lot. Karen, ever the watchful, came out to see the finalized product and to inspect anything she might not like. Immediately she noticed Kevin, munching away at a slim jim in his truck with music blasting. She proceeds to call uncle Eddie at the dispatch office to complain. \n\n&gt; Eddie: \u201cABC Dump Trucking, can I he-\u201c\n\n&gt; Karen: \u201cyour driver looks like an idiot\u201d\n\n&gt; Eddie: \u201cexcuse me, what?\u201d\n\n&gt; Karen: \u201cthis stupid driver you have in the blue dump truck looks like an idiot\u201d\n\n&gt; Eddie: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, who is this?\u201d\n\n&gt; Karen: \u201cMs Karen from XYZ Realtors. The one who\u2019s paying for component drivers, not mouth breathing idiots\u201d. \n\nThe phone then goes quiet. \n\n&gt; Karen: \u201coh no...NO STOP HIM NO!!! -random men screaming in the background-\u201c\nLoud buzzing noises commenced followed by a thunderous crash. \nKaren began panting. Karen began seething. Karen began screaming. \n\nYet above all that, what did Uncle Eddie hear? Kevin in the background declaring \u201cDon\u2019t get mad at me, it ain\u2019t my fault the bed of the truck didn\u2019t go down when I drove off\u201d. \n\nKaren began yelling what could only be compared to, and I quote Uncle Eddie on this, \u201ca f*cking Balrog mating call\u201d toward Kevin. Uncle Eddie grabbed the bossman, hopped in the company truck and hauled as much a** toward the job site. When they arrived, everything was in shambles. Kevin had pulled down every single power and internet line for the complex. He also tore down the upper half of the utility pole, which was attached to the main line. \n\nUpon seeing the boss, Kevin ran to him immediately like a kid who knew he done goofed. Thankfully the bossman wasn\u2019t having any of it and fired him on the spot. One would think that upon encountering these state of affairs, you just grab your things and leave, right? Nope. Not Kevin! He demands to be rehired on the spot. He was told to pound sand.\n\nKaren was heard yelling at everyone she could, so the bossman and Eddie walked toward her direction. Kevin, still not taking the hint, followed closely behind. As soon as she saw the boss, she got in his face, finger out stretched, wagging it and telling him how much he now owes her. The boss was listening to her rant when she noticed Kevin. \n\n&gt; Karen: \u201cYou. Do you realize how much money this cost me? Time? Effort?\u201d\n\n&gt; Kevin: \u201cFrom where I was in the truck, all I could see was your hand on your hip and your finger wagging at anyone who would listen. Don\u2019t seem like that requires much effort, I\u2019m just saying\u201d. \n\nThe boss and Uncle Eddie wanted so bad to laugh. The boss later admitted that was the only time he half considered giving Kevin his job back.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1625281908.0}]
