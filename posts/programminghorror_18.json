        "text": "I'm going to start by saying I wish I had a copy of this code.\n\nLast year in college, we were made to learn Perl of all things.\n\nEveryone had to submit mutually exclusive ideas for a final project to be signed off by the professor. A friend of mine decided that he wanted to write a simple script that would take a string, encrypt it with his own algorithm, and then send it via email, where it could then be copy pasted into a file which would then be parsed by the same program on the other end for decryption and output.\n\nI know this is small peas, but keep in mind this was a second semester, first year project, and this guy hadn't really programmed before.\n\nSo we have to present these projects, both code and functionality, on the last day to an auditorium filled with all the other students in the program, as well as faculty.\n\nSo my friend goes up and starts presenting. He explains the encryption algorithm works something to the effect of:\n\n&gt;String entry is looped per character\n\n&gt;Character is referenced to a hash whose mapped values are three characters long\n\n&gt;There are 3 possible 3 character values that are mapped to the original character (so 'f' could be 'abc', 'xyz', or 'jkl'), and the value is randomly selected out of the three\n\nIm not sure if thats all correct, but it was something akin to this.\n\nSo he goes through explaining this, and then...\n\nHe says \"The issue is that once I wrote it to be this way, I wasnt exactly sure how to decrypt it back...\".\n\nIMMEDIATELY, the audience collectively makes subtle, but definitely noticeable \"wat\" noises.\n\nSURELY you would think that he would just reference the hashes values, and insert the keys.\n\nNow keep in mind, this guy wrote this to work for lowercase, uppercase, numbers, punctuations, and some special characters.\n\nIn total, that meant that he had 106 characters to work with.\n\nAnd lo and behold, to the gasps and jaw drops of the entire packed auditorium, in order to decrypt, he had 1 if statement, **317 consecutive else if's**, and 1 else statement, for an error check.\n\nI have to give the guy props. He KNEW how bad it was, but he stayed professional the entire time in the face of the crowd.\n\nBut the sound of the decks upon decks of people as he was forced to scroll through this monstrosity to get to the rest of the code is something that I will never forget, nor want to face down.",

        "text": "While trying to refactor a Python project for performance, I decided to change my use of collections.deque to a Queue.Queue because it has a blocking .get() method; I theorised that this would be less load on the CPU than a very short sleep in polls against the deque to see if it had anything to .pop().\n\nObviously, as a coder, I'm very lazy- so I decided to make my deque replacement \"quack like a deque\" by wrapping it in an object with the same interface as a deque (append, popleft, etc).\n\nBecause I am extremely lazy, I didn't want to rewrite my unit tests, so I also implemented some magic methods on the wrapper object to make it compare as true against a deque of equal contents- and for ease of debugging during testing, I implemented the __repr__() method so that it looked like a deque when you printed it.\n\nNow you can't access all of the Queue.Queue contents at once, so my compare and my __repr__ methods all did the same thing- completely unload the queue into a deque, completely reload everything back into the queue (and return the created deque for comparison or printing).\n\nDangerous, but I told myself it was only for unit testing purposes.\n\nMy unit tests passed and during isolated testing, performance was much better.\n\nHowever I did not consider that I was doing some debug logging of the old deque object in the wider application, so when I deployed this change, the server running the application came tumbling to the ground under 100% load across all cores. Apparently it is quite a heavy operation to completely load and unload hundreds of queues of 30 odd deep every second.\n\nOops!",

This is a story about our electrical engineering intern who overall was a decent intern but made one huge mistake. \n\nHis project was to create a board and develop the software to go along with it. Now I don't know much about hardware but he had plenty of help in that department. At the end of the summer his project turns out to be one of the better ones from the interns. He is told to save his semantics and code to a shared folder. He proceeds to take screen shots of all his code and upload that to the folder. 22 images in total of his python code! The best part is he is obtaining a minor in computer science!!\n\nThe worst part is his laptop is sent away where it might of already been formatted effectively losing 60% of his project for the summer. \n\nI've laughed so hard tears ran down my face. Feel bad for the guy in charge of project now. ",

        "text": "Background:\n\nThis app (well, the idea of it) was highly praised and won in a competition. A development agency in Eastern Europe (based on what little I've been able to track down) was first contracted to build the app; it's an iOS app and an API. The API is written in the PHP framework Laravel. The codebase is complete crap (md5 passwords, 1200-line classes), agency got fired, and a new one has been hired, for which I am contracting.\n\n---\n\nSo the other day, I looked at the Apache config of the production server, and found that they were using pretty much default, okay, it could be better, but not too bad I thought to myself. So the root points to `/var/www/html`. Now, that directory holds a CodeIgniter site which is the frontend (marketing) site for this iOS app.\n\nHere's where it gets bad: the API is placed in `/var/www/html/API`. For anyone not familiar with Laravel, requests are served from the project's `public` directory (so `/var/www/html/API/public` in this case). Now what happens when you have `/var/www/html` as the root, use a default Apache config, and you aren't hitting an unknown path? Well, you get the file you ask for of course.\n\nIf you can't see why this is bad, let me give you a hint: `https://www.website.com/API/.env`. That exposed the environment, including database password, username and name, and a set of AWS credentials, among other less crucial things.\n\nI spent this morning figuring out how to write the `/var/www/html/API/.htaccess` to make sure this doesn't happen. Until then, I set the permissions on the environment file to `400`, and took the entire production app down while I figured it out.\n\n**To anyone building web apps:** please don't do this. Ever.",

And when they needed to add a dict to the final output, they just concatenated it with the result of json.dumps (which doesn't output a string representation of a dict, by the way). \n\nWHY, OH, WHY are those people so freaking afraid of installing libraries? I mean, I get that one shouldn't add dependencies lightly, but for fucks sake, it's not like it's a binary extension written in brainfuck!",
