I’m based in Brisbane, Australia at [The University of Queensland](https://iash.uq.edu.au/profile/1240/dr-charlotte-rose-millar), but my work takes me all over. I look at the cultural and historical aspects of witchcraft and hauntings – why do people want to see ghosts? How come women were more likely to be accused of witchcraft than men? When did the term witch go from dangerous insult to a signal of feminine power? More than 45,000 people were executed as witches in Western Europe, and people are [still being accused of sorcery](https://theconversation.com/can-we-learn-from-the-past-in-tackling-witchcraft-related-violence-today-102337?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=twitterbutton) in some countries today. While my expertise is in the cultural study of witches, I’m happy to chat about anything witch, ghost, or paranormal related – just note that it would be my opinion, rather than backed by research. u/KatieRowneyRambles is helping me out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I don't answer your question here, I might have answered it on [this podcast.](https://www.uq.edu.au/changemakers/article/2018/09/podcast-spellbinding-world-witchcraft-and-supernatural)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Proof here: [https://twitter.com/UQ\\_News/status/1040007590535557120](https://twitter.com/UQ_News/status/1040007590535557120)\n\nAnd here: [https://imgur.com/SQpNyAi](https://imgur.com/SQpNyAi)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT 10:07 AEST: Ok, I'm off to do some work.

        "text": "[Updated]: Thanks everyone for joining our AMA about mental health. If you’re looking for more resources on signs to watch out for, starting the conversation or following up with a friend, please visit: www.SeizeTheAwkward.org. \n\nAs doctors who have spent our careers focused on mental health and fighting suicide, we know that talking about mental health can be awkward, but we also know how much it can help! Whether you’re reconnecting after the summer apart or starting a new friendship, the start of the school year is an especially important time to check in with a friend about how they’re doing. Just starting a conversation with a friend, no matter how awkward it may feel, can make a real difference in someone’s life. \n\nI’m Dr. Victor Schwartz and I have over 25 years of experience as a psychiatrist working in college mental health. I am a Clinical Associate Professor of Psychiatry at NYU School of Medicine, and prior to becoming Chief Medical Officer at the Jed Foundation (JED), the nation’s leading national nonprofit organization that exists to protect emotional health and prevent suicide for our nation’s teens and young adults, I was the medical director of NYU’s Counseling Service, and served as University Dean of Students at Yeshiva University.\n\nI’m Dr. Christine Moutier and after losing colleagues to suicide early in my medical career, I decided to dedicate my career to fighting this leading cause of death. As a practicing psychiatrist, professor of psychiatry, and as the Chief Medical Officer at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP), the nation’s largest suicide prevention organization, I am focused on helping people be more open about their mental health, seeking help when they need it, and identifying ways to optimize care for those living with mental health conditions. \n\nFriends can usually tell when something is “off” with their friends, and they are often the first to recognize the early signs of mental health problems. They want to do something to help, but don’t always know what to say or how to start the conversation. Seize the Awkward, a campaign developed by JED, AFSP and the Ad Council, aims to encourage young adults to create a safe space for their friends to talk about their mental health, and educate them on how to have those conversations and support a friend in need. Watch the campaign videos [here,] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r47l4eUU1bc&amp;list=PLdSSKSOSBh4l56j7S7HxdZPTmO5iqvKCe) or visit www.SeizeTheAwkward.org for more resources. \n\nWe’re looking forward to answering any questions about how to help a friend who may be struggling with their mental health – ask us anything!\n\nProof: \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/cefeynhcphl11.jpg\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ytmdtlvaphl11.jpg\n\n",

        "text": "**Office Space** came out the year I graduated from university and started my first \"real\" job. Talk about serendipity :)\n\nAt a time in my life when I most needed affirmation that it was OK to admit that cubicles and corporate ladders weren't for me, I got it. \n\nThere had to be a better way.\n\nAnd while it took well over a decade of trial &amp; error to figure it out - my wife and I are pretty confident we've finally worked out our great escape.\n\nAlmost 10 years ago now we were teaching English in Chile (we'd previously met while teaching in South Korea and also taught together in Vietnam) when it dawned on us that ESL forever wasn't going to be the right solution. Having worked for almost 7 years as a tour guide in Europe before we met, my wife suggested that we try to get into the tourism industry.\n\nNo problem.\n\nExcept how do we do that? Particularly when most jobs related to tourism are awfully low paid.\n\n# The only logical solution was to start our own business\n\nNot only would running our own business (theoretically) allow us to earn a decent living in tourism, it would also provide us with full control over our vacation time. We love to travel and one of our biggest fears when looking at alternatives beyond ESL was being able to find a job that would allow 2-3 months off per year. Yes, a lofty goal but our goal nevertheless.\n\nAt any rate, after toying around with a bunch of different ideas, from a traveling English school that would essentially blend a European tour bus and English camp into one to a hostel or other types of guided tours, we were open to anything. But we kept coming back to the idea of potentially opening up our own beach hotel.\n\nIt just seemed to implausible.\n\n# Back to Korea\n\nWhile we were working on the particulars we decided it was best to return to Korea where the money was better. We could start saving capital while we figure out what we wanted to do.\n\nSlowly but surely our plans came together.\n\nWe decided on Mexico. And planned to build a very small boutique hotel where we would also provide 3 meals per day. Sort of like if a Bed &amp; Breakfast and a beach resort had a baby. \n\nOur concept was to provide a legitimate alternative to the giant soulless corporate resort. A place where perhaps less-adventurous travelers could both relax and have an experience that wasn't a Costco Vacation.\n\nAfter 3 years of saving like maniacs - we moved to Mexico and made it happen.\n\n# The old-fashioned way\n\nThe only problem was that we'd never built a beach resort before. \n\nAnd while we certainly had 'some' capital saved up for the project, it was a fraction of what any sane person would figure was reasonable for a project of this magnitude.\n\nSo along with our life savings, we added a whole lot of elbow grease. I made [this album](https://imgur.com/gallery/bnREQ) 4 years ago for /r/DIY and while not exhaustive, it provides a pretty good idea of our construction process.\n\nIn short, we figured it out as we went. Often using Google to teach us construction skills we needed on the fly.\n\n# Fast forward\n\nLong story short, after a bumpy beginning we're finally to a point where the business is relatively mature. Not exactly where we want to be numbers wise but good enough that it's no longer stressful to watch our inbox for reservations. \n\nWe've been given a [Certificate of Excellence from TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g153373-d4076432-Reviews-Gecko_Rock_Resort-Puerto_Escondido_Southern_Mexico.html) a couple times, which is from being consistently ranked in the top 3 of your category for the year...and we get a lot of return guests, which is the ultimate compliment for all the hard work we've put in. That out of everywhere there is to go in the world on vacation, people choose to come back again with us instead of trying something new.\n\nIt's hard to believe that next month we'll be opening for our 5th full season at Gecko Rock.\n\nAsk me anything.\n\n[Proof](http://geckorockresort.com/iama/)",

I am Zellnor Myrie, a candidate for State Senate in New York's 20th State Senate District. My district includes the neighborhoods of Brownsville, Crown Heights, East Flatbush, Gowanus, Park Slope, Prospect Heights, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, South Slope, and Sunset Park. I was born and raised here in the district by my mom, who moved to this country from Costa Rica over 40 years ago. After college, I worked in the New York City Council as a legislative director where I helped write and pass the City’s Tennant Bill of Rights. I then went on to graduate from Cornell Law School. \n\nI am running against former-IDC member Jesse Hamilton to represent my community as real Democrat. I believe the issues facing my community are too grave and too urgent to sit on the sidelines. My platform will expand affordable housing, fully fund our public education system, protect our immigrant communities, and reform our criminal justice system.\n\nI will be here from 1-3 p.m. EST to answer your questions. AMA!\n\nPlease check out our website: [https://zellnorforstatesenate.com/](https://zellnorforstatesenate.com/) where you can sign up as a volunteer: [https://zellnorforstatesenate.com/volunteer/](https://zellnorforstatesenate.com/volunteer/) and if you can, donate to our campaign.

I have been the Medical Director of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Emergency Department for 9 years, working approximately 400 admitted youth and families and over 1,000 emergency department patients per year.\n\nMy primary research interest is suicidology. I have published articles on the utilization of emergency departments for psychiatric services, the use of psychotropic medications, and authored and edited textbooks on Emergency Psychiatry and Psychopharmacology.\n\n\n\nToday is World Suicide Prevention Day – where a (hopefully appropriate) spotlight on suicide prevention raises awareness to the tremendous amount of resources and support that exist out there in the world for people who are struggling with suicidal thinking.\n\nSo please, Ask Me Anything about the science of suicide, suicide prevention, suicide prevention training, the media’s reporting of suicide, risk documentation, or other topics you can think of!\n\n\nWARNING: Suicidal thinking can be increased by reading about, or discussing, topics relating to suicide. Please be aware that the topics inside this AMA could be triggering or overwhelming for some. If you find yourself needing to reach out, please be aware of local and national crisis lines (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines has a helpful list), find someone to talk to, or seek help at your local emergency health facility. Help is available and people with suicidal thinking receiving help experience significant relief and positive outcomes!\n\nProof: https://imgur.com/a/7GZEZGg\n\nToday is a work day for me so I will be responding throughout the day starting at 8amPST/11am EST. I will be replying through the day.\n\n**Edit** 1230EST I am slowly pecking away at responses throughout the day, between patients and work.  Please be patient!  I'll focus on the most upvoted for now but I will look for unique questions as well!\n\n**Edit** 1400EST 838 new messages in my inbox - it's unrealistic at my pace I'll respond to everything but I'm doing my best.\n\n**edit** 1530EST - I'm replying and now it's at 1125 new messages.  Thank you all for your contributions and I am continuing to work at my plodding pace.  I couldn't dedicate today to replies like I have done previously, so it's nowhere near fast enough to reply.\n\n**edit** 1800EST I have to formally say here, and sorry that those who don't get a reply,  that I can't provide specific medical advice on reddit.  I'll do my best but there are many people who are posting their personal stories.  I've read them. I care.  I hope help is available and I feel my other responses have addressed a lot of what my general advice would be.  I will reply where I can but there is an overwhelming amount to get through. \n\n**edit** 2030 EST I have to tap out now... I will try my best to get to questions I feel are left unanswered but I should probably turn off the faucet now.  For those who have shared stories, thank you, and I'm sorry I couldn't get to everyone.  Today was truly epic and eye opening to how much more I need to get more public messaging out there.  \n\nIf there's one thing i want everyone here to know, it's the following phrase for the people in your life:  \"hey just to let you know, if you ever need me, give me a call, I really care about you.\"\n\n**edit 0430am: thank you all! I put my best effort in and thank you to amazing redditors who also stepped up.  Good night reddit!**",
