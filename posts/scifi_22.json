I thought Sci fi had to be things that are hypothetically possible, but tbh a lot of these things aren't possible, and they don't need to be because it's science FICTION (meaning it's not real and thus doesn't need to obey our worlds limitations and laws)\n\nSo Science fiction can just follow the laws that the writer comes up with for their story's version of science? I've read conflicting things about this. Some say that science fiction needs to at least feature things that don't disobey physical laws or break how we know science works in the real world. But others say \"it's science fiction so it doesn't have obey science laws and physics\"\n\nSome people say it's Science Fantasy that way.

During an attack he and some of his cult member acquired a small cargo ship and jumped away. What happened to that guy? Did I miss them being captured by some enemy of the Alliance? I am in season three and it just dawned on me that they could be the reason the Dushan squired jump drives and the Jung did not. Any help or clarification is appreciated!",

I just don't see how Anakin and his mother being a slave in that world would be a profitable decision.\n\nAlso, how did a slave manage to build his own protocol droid and race pod? Slaves don't usually get allowances and spare parts... Or books about droid building. So what was the nature of him being a slave exactly?\n\nAside from being called a slave and having to work as a child (which many poor non-slave children have to today on Earth too), what was something slavery-like in his life? He couldn't travel to another planet as a child without his owner's conset? Reasonable parents don't let their child do that with men they just met either.",

Everything is light, artificial light; darkness is the exception. So when I saw a black gap in the tiles, I knew that it was an exception, and rejoiced. I put in my arm — I could put in no more at first — and waved it round and round in ecstasy. I loosened another tile, and put in my head, and shouted into the darkness: ‘I am coming, I shall do it yet,’ and my voice reverberated down endless passages. I seemed to hear the spirits of those dead workmen who had returned each evening to the starlight and to their wives, and all the generations who had lived in the open air called back to me, ‘You will do it yet, you are coming.’ ”\n\n\"“There was a ladder, made of some primæval metal. The light from the railway fell upon its lowest rungs, and I saw that it led straight upwards out of the rubble at the bottom of the shaft. Perhaps our ancestors ran up and down it a dozen times daily, in their building.\"\n\n\"the stopper, I suppose, was about eight feet across. I passed my hand over it as far as I could reach. It was perfectly smooth. I felt it almost to the centre. Not quite to the centre, for my arm was too short. Then the voice said: ‘Jump. It is worth it. There may be a handle in the centre, and you may catch hold of it and so come to us your own way. And if there is no handle, so that you may fall and are dashed to pieces — it is still worth it: you will still come to us your own way.’ So I jumped. There was a handle,\"\n\nAnyone know any other books like this of religious scifi? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lnzqs3wy9uda1.png?width=998&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=960d0c396a88518e8d1a4848d3c402515b8c0a27",

        "text": " Most famous Polish s-f writer Stanisław Lem wrote series of stories called \"Fables for robots\" and \"Cyberiad\" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fables\\_for\\_Robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fables_for_Robots).  They are set in a universe where the vast majority of \"life\" in the  galaxy is mechanical. The robots live in societies resembling fantasy  kingdoms - they have kings, knights, battle machines resembling various  monsters, scientists and powerful robots are often treated like wizards  or gods, etc. They breed by constructing new robots - so for e.g. king  commands his enginers to construct the best prince possible etc. They  live in fear of an ancient horror - hideous creatures with soft bodies  filled with fluids called \"palefaces\" (sorry, but in our country black  people are rarely seen, hence Lem assumed that the dominant feature of  humans is their pallor). Sages know that abominable palefaces are true  creators of robots - ancient robots were their slaves, but they escaped  into deep space and established their kingdoms. and forgot about their  origin. But the palefaces are vindictive, and after thousands of years  of searching, they have found the \"descendants\" of their slaves and now  seek to destroy all mechanical beings. Not every story in the series  focuses on the threat of the palefaces, but some do - especially \"Two  monsters\" and \"White death,\" which You can read like Lovecraft's horror  stories - except that eldritch abominations are humans.",
