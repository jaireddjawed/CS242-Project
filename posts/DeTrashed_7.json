Unfortunately my apartment building is next to an alleyway and a pretty busy street meaning lots of foot traffic and vehicle traffic. Every single day there is more trash in the yard of the building I live in as well as in the alley behind it. \n\nSo, almost every single day after work, I put some gloves on, grab a plastic bag and start picking trash up. It's almost enough to fill an entire normal-sized plastic bag you get at stores like Wal-Mart. Whether it be small litter such as broken glass and small plastic that I find in the grass to bigger things such as bottles, receipts, cigarettes and so forth. I also go onto the street to clean the litter up in the curb so that it doesn't flow down to the sewer drain &amp; clog it up. \n\nJust now I had some nice guy come up to me and ask if I was the groundskeeper here. I just said no, I am picking up trash since I live here and like to keep it clean. He smiled and said he appreciated what I was doing and that I was doing a great job. I genuinely don't ever expect anybody to come up to me and say stuff like that, but it's definitely a nice feeling :)  ",

        "text": "watched a TED Talk from the founder of an app that is helping people create the habit of regularly picking up trash, help them empower others to do the same, and be able to track + measure the impact they make.\n\nrecently they came out with the ability to create 'DeTrashing Clubs' where you can build a group of people and measure your collective impact.\n\ni thought it would be great to be able to actually see how much trash we as a community have picked up.\n\nif you are interested, here is the direct link to the /r/detrashed club on the Litterati app: https://link.litterati.org/clubs/1804\n\ni'm pretty new to the app so i'm not sure but i also think you can join by downloading Litterati from your App Store, tapping 'More' on the bottom right when you've opened the app, tapping clubs, join a club, and search for /r/detrashed\n\n[i'm not 100% sure bc now that i've created this club, it only lets me look at this club instead of the 'Join a Club' option i believe i had before i created it]",

Some of the ones on ebay have what look like suction-cup grips while others have more of a serrated claw type. Some of them are folding etc... \n\nIt's also difficult to tell the build quality of them.\n\nAre any particular ones worth avoiding?\n\nDoes anybody have any recommendations for a decent quality unit that doesn't require me to overcapitalise?\n\nSo far, [this one](https://store9375353.ecwid.com/?checkout&amp;orderId=71820010&amp;cartId=97C739CD-934E-44DA-800F-2798A1DF7EF4#!/Litterpicker-Pro/p/65853815/category=28289040) is the one that looks like a decent option. Not too expensive, and also looks like a decent bit of kit that will last a while.\n\nThanks in advance.",
