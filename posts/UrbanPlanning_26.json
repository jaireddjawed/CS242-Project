        "text": "Hey Guys,\n\nI'm a a semester a way from an MPA with a focus in community development, and I'm considering a Ph. D in planning as one of my two post MPA choices (2nd masters in GIS is the other option). \n\nI'm not sure what area of planning I would focus on but housing, infrastructure are areas of interest. \n\nSome might ask the reason I want a Ph. D. Well to be honest I have zero interest in academia. I do not want to teach but I want to be able to continually get promotions in the field. \n\nI've heard it said many places (maybe inaccurately) that a bachelor's is the new HS diploma. If that is so then it would seem that masters degrees are the new bachelor's. Not *everybody* has one, but they are common enough. If so, then I suspect a Ph. D is education that truly makes one stand out.\n\nI work for state government (though not in anything planning related) so cost is not an issue as I receive tuition waivers. So other than the price of books and maybe my sanity, a doctorate won't cost me anything. \n\nWith that said, do you guys think going for a Ph. D with no interest in academic would be a good move? Any advice is appreciated. ",

Existing housing that violated the new rules was allowed to remain, but anything new, had to be only \"detached single family\" housing -- in the vast majority of the city. At the same time, 5,000 square feet became the new minimum lot size for new lots, even though almost half of the existing lots where smaller, and many exist in the 3,000 square foot size range.\n\nToday, depending on how you measure the zoning and what you include in the denominator, between 50% and 80% of the city or the city's \"residential\" land is restricted to only \"detached single family\" housing. \n\nI'm curious how common this was in other similar US cities? And is there a general understanding around why these rezones were done? \n\nWas there some nationwide, post WW2, love fest with cars and suburban housing types in a lot of US cities?\n\nThere are a lot of theories around why this was done in Seattle, but I'm curious if there are general patterns or themes that cover many US cities?

So, obviously there is a lot of research and people related to water and cities here....but it wasn't until I arrived that it hit me: how do I even decide on something? How do I come up with a question that hasn't been explored much, that is worth asking, in a place I am in for only the first time?\n\nNot to mention I haven't really done a big project or paper like this before (my degree in undergrad tossed out the thesis requirement just before I declared the major). Something seems just so gargantuan about dedicating part of my life to such a massive, unprecedented piece of research. I fear losing steam or interest in a topic even if it excites me in the beginning.\n\nIf any of y'all were/are in such a position, do let me know any advice, or anything you know now that you wish you did then.

I'd be interested in your thoughts.\n\nThere shouldn’t be much concern about the practice of AirBnB (and similar) rentals beyond basic nuisance laws and income tax collection. Historically, there have been short-term accommodations (hotels, bed and breakfast, etc.) and housing (both rental and owner-occupied), existing as two separate markets. AirBnB has erased that distinction and made them relatively interchangeable. If the number of AirBnB rentals is increasing, that just means that the ‘hotel’ market is currently more profitable than the ‘housing’ market. Eventually, if the practice is allowed to continue, the price of hotels will drop and the price of housing will rise until these markets come into equilibrium, and there would be no new net conversions of housing into AirBnB units. If a municipality wanted to prevent the conversions naturally, it should allow its supply of short-term accommodations to increase (basically, build more hotels). If it doesn’t want to do that but is still worried about housing prices, then it should allow its supply of housing to increase to offset the conversions.",

        "text": "Hello, I grew up in a very suburban town, what my parents called downtown was a single 10-story office building next to a highway surrounded by parking and some strip malls. Even the downtown in the big city of which we were a suburb was not really that mixed-use; we never went there as a kid because it was only offices, no recreation.  \n\nEverything changed when I went to college in a small 'standalone' town with a walkable downtown, street grid, bike lanes and trails, historic buildings, pedestrian-centered design, and so on. This got me to where I could recognize urban design as good or bad but not really understand why I preferred certain areas over others.  \n\nWhat I am looking for is something I can share quickly and easily with intrigued friends and family on this topic. Not a college course or a long book, but maybe a 5-15 minute fun and interesting YouTube video that covers the basics of what makes a good place. For example, narrow car lanes, awnings over sidewalks, pedestrian protection features, and so on - something that highlights the good and the bad and makes it easy for people to recognize these things.  \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions? Thanks in advance!",

        "text": "Hey guys, I had a new concept, and submitted it for UNESCO'S Youth Citizenship Entrepreneurship competition. Looking for criticism, tips and votes (please)\n\n**Youtube Video Pitch:** [**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6TDvSFAFyQ**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6TDvSFAFyQ)\n\n**For details, and to vote and comment, go here:** [**https://www.entrepreneurship-campus.org/ideas/16/10823/**](https://www.entrepreneurship-campus.org/ideas/16/10823/)\n\nMetamorphoSpace is the answer to expensive real estate in developing cities for local businesses in the tertiary sector. We aim to transform urban environments to provide accessible locations at affordable rents for local businesses, and optimise real estate distribution. This will promote economic growth in developing cities, allow local businesses and SME'S (Small and medium-sized enterprises) to flourish and provide services to the community. MetamorphoSpace helps create sustainable cities, and ameliorates real estate crisis in urban settings. Lastly, MetamorphoSpace promtes the set up of industries and infrastructure. Therefore the project tackles UN Sustainability Goals 8,9 and 11. What is a MetamorphoSpace? Lets take an example to understand the issue. One one hand, we have Mary, a travel estate agent in a growing city. She wishes to rent an office for her company but rent is expensive, and a majority of her customers visit on weekdays, and in the daytime. Therefore, her space is vacant on evenings and on weekends. On the other hand, Thomas is a local chef who wishes to set up a take-out restaurant, but a maximum number of customers buy on weekends and in the evenings? Similarly, there exist many service businesses, that only need a workspace for certain hours in a day. A MetamorphoSpace is a workspace in a prime location of a city, that can be rented out to different businesses for different times in a day. For example, a real estate/tourist agent can use the space as her office in the mornings, teachers could conduct workshops for children in the afternoon, and at night, chefs like Thomas can use the space as a restaurant. The local businesses benefit, as they can provide their services at a prime location, and only use the space for the required time, spending less on rent.\n\nOpen to all ideas and criticism. Keep in mind, the idea is still in the conceptual stage",

Does anyone know of a reasonably priced option for this type of thing?  I know expensive custom options like metro quest surveys or arcmap online can do this, but I was wondering if there’s an off the shelf solution akin to how survey monkey functions?",

        "text": "On our way back from work (we carpool together), I casually mentioned having to take the bus once. That conversation somehow shifted to the attitudes of people in regards to Transit users. I complained it was unacceptable that people tended to stereotype Transit users as being poor or criminal or somehow morally corrupt for the mere quality of not owning/using a car. This, in turn, led to a long debate about how most roads are meant for cars and cars only.\n\nNow, being someone who enjoys walking and biking, I assumed it would be a perfectly rational thing to want. Sidewalks and bike paths, in comparison to the rest of the road, would take a relatively tiny amount of space.\n\nShe disagreed. Every time I repeated my point (roads should be designed with more than cars in mind) she would dismiss my argument, saying that nobody needs to drive in this day and age, and so sidewalks and bike paths are useless anyway.\n\nI had never really faced such a degree of skepticism toward the idea of not driving everywhere. Is this how the average person thinks? Sorry for being so wordy, just really frustrated about this.\n\n&lt;/rant&gt;",
