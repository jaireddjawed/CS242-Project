That effort carried on in the Qing Dynasty, in which the Beijing dialect had become dominant and actually began to be considered as the Guanhua. \n\n\nWhat I can't seem to understand is the link between the late Qing Guanhua (Beijing dialect) and Standard Modern Chinese. I imagined the late Qing Guanhua continued to be used by its successors. However, now, when I listen to speakers of the Beijing dialect talk in Beijing dialect, I can detect some slight differences it has with Putonghua/Standard Modern Chinese. If the Beijing dialect has successfully become Guanhua since the late Qing dynasty, what made the slight differences happen between the Beijing dialects and the standard dialect? Is Standard Modern Chinese actually somewhat of a dialect of Chinese that is not identical to any local dialect the Chinese language?",

In Britain, there seems to not be the negative connotation to the word that there is in the States. Sure, here in the US, we use \"lighting scheme\" or \"color scheme\", but we would NEVER call a government program (for example) a \"scheme\" unless we thought very negatively of it. It seems that in the UK, calling any type of plan or program a \"scheme\" is perfectly acceptable without any negative light. Can someone explain why a US \"scheme\" is a bad thing and a UK \"scheme\" is not? Thanks in advance!!",

I'm curious if the Sanskrit word for \"give,\" French's donner, and Spanish's dar are all from \"give\" in PIE.

The uvular trill is the first sound I learned to do and I haven't been able to stop making it. I can do the unvoiced uvular trill just fine (like in a word trois) and I do not get it confused with a trill whatsoever, but in words where I'm supposed to do a voiced UF it turns either into a trill or a combination of both a UT and UF.\n\nI know that in French, saying the uvular trill isn't a problem in terms of people understanding me, but I want to make to learn how to make the voiced UF sound. I can make the unvoiced variant and I thought just adding some humming to it to make it voiced, but whenever I try to say it in a sentence the trill comes out or I say all the R's unvoiced to prevent from trilling.\n\nThe most useful trick I've read on how to make the voiced UF is to say aga, then ara, and it works, but like I said earlier, when I try to pronounce it in a phrase/sentence it quickly turns into a trill.

Are more elaborate registers (like in Japanese) a dialect that could be considered a sort of very related second language? I know that many contemporary Japanese people basically have to study formal speech if they discover they'll need to use it a lot, so that is what is making me wonder where registers fall from a linguistic standpoint. The fact that children don't acquire them seem key to me in this regard.",

A new Q&amp;A thread goes up every Monday, but we have people who read them regularly throughout the week.\n\n**What counts as a “quick question”?**\n\nAny question that can be answered in a single comment and is unlikely to generate discussion is a quick question. While it’s impossible to predict which questions will generate disscussion all of the time, here are some examples: \n\n*Quick questions:*\n\n* Asking for an explanation of a technical term\n* Asking if there are any languages with a particular feature\n* Asking how we would transcribe something\n* Asking how a feature works in a particular language\n\n*Not-so-quick questions:*\n\n* Asking about the theoretical or methodological motivation for a particular claim\n* Asking for reading recommendations for a particular subject\n\nIf you’re not sure where your question belongs, just use your best judgment. The mods might ask you to move your question—but if so, it’s no big deal, and has nothing to do with the quality of the question.\n\nAlso, before asking a question, please be sure to check [**our FAQ**](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/wiki/faqindex) and to do a quick Google or Wikipedia search. We’re happy to answer questions, but we appreciate it when people have tried to do some basic research first.

This could be because you posted it soon before the new Q&amp;A thread went up, or it could be because it the answer requires specialist knowledge.  If this happens, feel free to repost your question in the new Q&amp;A thread, or to post it as a separate thread.",

So for example, in English we used to have almost ad hoc, myriad ways to spell many words.  but in the last few centuries, we've sort of frozen all that crazy spelling evolution.\n\nso, can we not make the same argument for pronunciation? after all, i can easily understand an accent from an American of the year 1900, and i suspect that an American in the year 2100 will be able to, as well. \n\nhere's an example: lets say by the year 2100, the USA and UK are a shadow of its former glory, and India is the new great, big empire (LOL).  so obviously Hinglish is a thing, and Indianized English is a thing as we all know, and perhaps that may be the new \"dialect of prestige\".  but despite this reality, thanks to mass communication, we (by which i include Indians as well) will not stop being able to understand those old Bugs Bunny cartoons from the 1940s, or that radio announcer screaming that the Hindenburg has caught fire.....\n\n\n",

For instance, many languages have gender-neutral pronouns (the same word is used for he and she) but are spoken in cultures with very poor levels of gender equality. This might seem obvious – it’s Orwell’s Newspeak (from 1984) in action. In Orwell’s dystopia, the word “free” was stripped of all meaning of individual freedoms and could be used only in the sense of a dog being free from lice, which in turn was supposed to remove the ability of the citizens of Oceania to conceive of such freedom. But it is not just science fiction. There is an important note of caution that linguists are always aware of: making claims about other cultures risks “exoticising” them. At worst, this results in racism. The Hopi people of Arizona, who are sometimes claimed to have no way to express time based on a misunderstanding of Benjamin Lee Whorf’s work on their language, were assumed by some to be incapable of following bus timetables or arriving at work on schedule, a mistaken belief that led to obvious problems. But even an apparently benign conclusion about how some Australian languages encode space with compass directions (“north”) rather than ego-relative position (“my left-hand side”) suggests English speakers often miss out on knowledge about language and cognition because they are busy measuring things against an arbitrary English-centric benchmark. Different language conventions are usually not exotic or unusual; it’s just that English speakers come from a position of very great privilege because their language is the default. People who speak other languages are seen as different, as outsiders.”\n\nhttps://theconversation.com/language-untranslatable-words-tell-us-more-about-english-speakers-than-other-cultures-100841",

Nowadays Gutnish is, more or less, regarded as a dialect of Swedish because of the extensive influence, however back in the days it used to be it's own branch along with Old West Norse and Old East Norse.\n\nI've also read that East Germanic was a branch that split off of North Germanic quite early, further supporting its connection to Old Gutnish, but I'm not entirely sure of the certainty of this piece of information.\n\nIs there any solid evidence that would prove the connection between these beautiful Germanic languages?

Does anyone have links looking at other forms of it?\n\nI'm a corporate communication trainer in South Korea, but I was raised in Colorado cowboy country and come from a long line of sheep ranchers and Baptist ministers. If I don't code-switch, I piss people off. \n\nI'd like resources that I can use in my classes to help explain the concept to my clients. East Asian communication, particularly in Korea and Japan, has this type of thing hard-coded into the conjugation (e.g. Korean inflects on four levels of familiarity. There are regional dialectic differences in the conjugation, so switching between them isn't motivated the same way for them as for us). There are objective rules for how you communicate with different people, so the ad hoc systems used by English-speakers is baffling and my clients are frequently put off when they encounter it.\n\nDue to a generally poor understanding of African-American culture, I'd prefer to use resources that directly reference cases of code-switching in white English-speakers. If anyone can help, I'd appreciate it.",
