        "text": "Quantum mechanics is a field of quantum physics that studies the behavior and interactions between atoms and molecules. It's an incredibly complex topic, but it can be broken down into some basic concepts. The idea behind quantum mechanics is that even though we cannot see or touch them, there are tiny particles all around us! These particles behave in strange ways that break from our everyday experience with matter. Quantum computing is a relatively new way to use these particle waves to do calculations much more quickly than traditional computers can do today. In this post, I'll introduce the most basic concepts of quantum mechanics and explain why it's important for understanding quantum computing! \n\nGet started here: \n\n[https://deepboltzer.codes/the-incredible-world-of-quantum-mechanics](https://deepboltzer.codes/the-incredible-world-of-quantum-mechanics)",

Last year was literally my first interaction with the tech world (public static void main(String\\[\\] args) typed out every single day) but as I do research I see people getting laid off of work from big businesses (twitter etc) meaning they will find other tech jobs which I reckon will affect me. \n\nOnline I also researched about Leetcode and Hackerrank which I tried and can't even do some of its easy questions like half of the words I don't even understand. Plus the added pressure of seeing other people being miles ahead, some of my mates already know the language we are learning and just flying through it, this guy on YouTube what's his name high school student doing google kickstater or something?? Absolutely mental. \n\nYea so is there any advice from you guys on how to progress and stuff?\n\nMany thanks!",

        "text": "This might be a dumb question but I've been wondering why graph algorithms based on edge information considered NP? Isn't it unfair to calculate complexity of an algorithm in terms of node count when the algorithm itself is based on number of edges (which is always n! in worst case)?\n\nI've been trying to think about this from information theory perspective. Here's my progress so far -\nLets take the hamiltonian cycle problem:\nThe hamiltonian cycle problem itself is based on edges and visiting a node doesn't provide any new information that is helpful for the problem. It always the edge (or basically pair of connected nodes) that provides helpful information towards solving the problem. The limitation of any universal algorithm is that we can only traverse one edge at a time. So in the worst case, at each step we only gain 1/(total number of edges) information towards solving the problem. Consequently, I assume we need information from all edges before we can solve the problem. The number of possible edges is n!, so the complexity is also O(n!) but it feels weird computing the complexity in terms of something that doesn't provide any information for solving the problem. \n \nOn the other hand, if we consider number of edges as our metric, the complexity becomes O(e) which is linear and from this perspective, its not really NP. \n\nAt this point I know I'm grasping at straws here but this is just out of curiosity and trying to get a deeper understanding of P vs NP.",

The AWS option is 16 weeks as well  and prepares you for CCP and Solutions Architect Associate.\n\nI  am trying to figure out which one of these courses would be better for  someone like me. I recently separated from the military, have a  bachelor's degree in an unrelated field, and a secret clearance. My goal  is simply to secure employment after the program. It doesn't even have  to be great money, but I do need to start working soon thereafter.\n\nAny advice is appreciated!",

Anyone can participate.** [**Learn more and apply at alignmentawards.com!**](https://www.alignmentawards.com/)\n\n\\-----\n\nWill advanced AI be beneficial or catastrophic? We think this will depend on our ability to align advanced AI with desirable goals – something researchers don’t yet know how to do.\n\nWe’re running contests to make progress on two key subproblems in alignment:\n\n* **The Goal Misgeneralization Contest** (based on [Langosco et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14111)): AIs often learn unintended goals. Goal misgeneralization occurs when a reinforcement learning agent retains its capabilities out-of-distribution yet pursues the wrong goal. How can we prevent or detect goal misgeneralization?\n* **The Shutdown Contest** (based on [Soares et al., 2015](https://intelligence.org/files/Corrigibility.pdf)): Advanced AI systems might resist attempts to turn them off. How can we design AI systems that are open to being shut down, even as they get increasingly advanced?\n\nNo prerequisites are required to participate. The deadline to submit is March 1, 2023.\n\nTo learn more about AI alignment, see [alignmentawards.com/resources](https://www.alignmentawards.com/resources).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7jc5ylnydw9a1.png?width=1529&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f7bb7ac2310f617835c729c89c0520f8ac8036f",

        "author": "Knaapje",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/102cd0f/weakest_preconditions/",
        "text": "I'm looking at implementing weakest preconditions for a simple imperative language ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate\\_transformer\\_semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_transformer_semantics)) in Prolog, but there are two things gaps in my understanding that are blocking me from progressing at this point. What I have so far is very minimal, but already sort of working:\n\n```\n:- member(Operator, [+=, -=, *=]), op(990, xfy, Operator).\n\nwp(skip, C, C).\nwp(abort, false, _).\nwp(S1; S2, Pre, Post) :- wp(S2, Intermediate, Post), wp(S1, Pre, Intermediate).\nwp(X = E, Pre, Post) :- atom(X), ground(Post), substitute(X, E, Post, Pre).\nwp(X += E, Pre, Post) :- wp(X = X + E, Pre, Post).\nwp(X -= E, Pre, Post) :- wp(X = X - E, Pre, Post).\nwp(X *= E, Pre, Post) :- wp(X = X * E, Pre, Post).\nwp(if(B, S1, S2), ((\\+ B; Pre1), (B; Pre2)), Post) :- wp(S1, Pre1, Post), wp(S2, Pre2, Post).\nwp(while(C, B), Pre, Post) :- false.\nwp(do_while(B, C), Pre, Post) :- wp(B; while(C, B), Pre, Post).\nwp(for(Init, Test, Step, B), Pre, Post) :- wp(Init; while(Test, B; Step), Pre, Post).\n\nsubstitute(Variable, Expression, Variable, Expression).\nsubstitute(Variable, Expression, Term, Substituted) :-\n  Variable \\= Term,\n  Term =.. [Functor | Arguments],\n  maplist(substitute(Variable, Expression), Arguments, SubstitutedArguments),\n  Substituted =.. [Functor | SubstitutedArguments].\n```\n\nSo far, this allows me to check pre- and postconditions of loop-free code, e.g. swapping can be verified to work through the query: `wp(temp = x; x = y; y = temp, (y = temp1, x = temp2), (x = temp1, y = temp2)).` I.e., if at first y=temp1, and x=temp2, then after executing the given fragment, then their values will be reversed.\n\nThere are some problems I have though:\n- Any pointers on how I would implement the semantics for while? The linked Wikipedia article uses a confusing &lt;= notation, instead of actual equality, without really explaining what that entails.\n- Equivalence between predicates often seems to be taken for granted. E.g., in the Sequence section of the Wikipedia article linked above, the transformation `(x-5)*2&gt;20` to `x &gt; 15` is taken for granted, but in practice this actually requires some intricate system for symbolically transforming (sub)expressions, that is never really expanded upon in slides and articles I've come across. My current implementation can definitely generated predicates of the former type, but not rewrite it to the second one.\n- How would I implement break/continue? The logical implementation seems to be to let these statements be sugars for goto's, but I'm not sure if this is the correct approach. Inclusions of these statements seems to complicate the semantics by quite a lot.\n- Does anyone know a good existing program that applies weakest preconditions, that I could study w.r.t. usability? I remember applying wp to Java in uni, but I don't recall the used program.",

The following problem is : \n\nsuppose we can only use the number 4 once and  the  operations :floor ,square root and factorial. Those  operations can be used as many times they must and in whatever order in order to find the correct path of operations that will lead from number 4 to target number n . this problem is a graph theory problem that tests all the possible paths by brute forcing and finds the correct chain of operations. Keep in mind that evevy time  we try each operation we feed it as prompt to the next one. \n\nSome extra thoughts: \n  1.the result of sqrt can be fractional.\n 2. we should avoid computing the factorial of a fractional number .\n 3.we need to  avoid cycles\n4.we will need big numbers\n\nFor example in order to get from number 4 to target number = 5 we need to get the following chain of operations (left to right ) \n\nfactorial,factorial,sqrt,sqrt,sqrt,sqrt,sqrt,floor \n\nThis algorithm can only be solved by bfs and iddfs. I can provide you with the code I tried in DMs.  I'm so tired and desperate that if it comes to this I will provide a payment to solve this for me . Thank you so much for your time",

        "text": "Making money is important to me, but I don't need 200K/year. I do however want a safe job with good work life balance and decent pay. I want to be able to spend a decent amount of my life making friendships and spending time with friends.\n\nPlease help me decide Management Information Systems vs Computer Science, I'm losing my mind lol.\n\n# Computer Science (CS)\n\nPros:\n\n* More likely to make a lot amount of money.\n* Probably more work from home jobs.\n* If AI starts stealing everyone's job 15 years from now, CS might be a good place to be if I can get into machine learning and help run the AI.\n* Problem solving can be cool\n* Maybe way worse work life balance than MIS in college, but way better work life balance than MIS like 2 years out of college??\n\nCons:\n\n* Courses are much harder than MIS, thus less time to spend building friendships.\n* To be competitive for internships and jobs you also need to spend a significant amount of time outside of classes learning actual skills. So even less time free time as if the classes don't demand enough time.\n* Supposedly there is huge saturation, at the very least there is in the entry level. This is maybe one of the biggest cons. The big issues from my understanding that causes this and why it is a real issue and not just short term like the recession/tech layoffs are as follows:\n\n1. The huge rise of social media selling the idea that everyone can make 100K if they come into the industry. Now seems like everyone is doing boot camps.\n2. Even without the self-learning and boot camp craze, the computer science graduates per year have doubled from 50K ten years ago to now over 100K new CS grads per year.\n3. Global outsourcing.\n4. ChatGPT/AI will advance exponentially, and will allow for workers to be more efficient leading to less workers needed, if any at all eventually.\n\n# Management Information Systems (MIS)\n\nPros:\n\n* Supposedly it's pretty common for people to make 80K starting from Temple University with MIS, I can easily go to this school.\n* MIS is mix of CS and business stuff, so I'd imagine I'd have way more jobs I can get into with this degree for way better job safety. AND if I want to, I can always self-learn most CS skills if I wanted to get CS jobs. And I could get masters in CS if I wanted to.\n* Probably was less competition and saturation than CS field.\n* MIS is known to be an easier degree, plus I don't need to learn a hole bunch of stuff on top of the courses just to get hired, so more time for friends.\n\nCons:\n\n* Maybe easier job to replace with AI?? If AI takes over every job, it will be harder to get into the AI/ML stuff with MIS\n* Probably slightly lower average pay and lower ceiling for pay??\n* People call it the CS drop out degree\n* Maybe not as many work from home jobs, although honestly it's probably comparable??\n* Maybe initially work life balance is better than CS, but not long term??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo matter which degree I choose, I am still a dedicated student and will work hard to be competitive for internships and jobs, I just really value work life balance so I can spend time with friends.\n\nWhich path do you think makes sense if I want to make decent money, but also be able to have plenty of time to touch grass and hang with friends?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: MIS will maybe give me more free time than CS with only a bit less money???",

I know it's tidy, easier, and makes life easier and safer. But are folders really essential for a computer to function? In an abstract sense, not necessarily on current filesystems/OSes. I googled a bit and all the answers I'm getting on how useful folders are, but not whether we can do away with folders or not for a computer to run even if it means having to create a new filesystem/OS.\n\nI know we can set permissions on folders especially when we want to share them across networks, but we can potentially do the same on files levels and set some sort of flags on metadata for permissions and such. Maybe names could be a problem, but we can refer to files by some GUID or something and include the name in its metadata (And probably version too).\n\nI personally dump most of my files in a single folder and look files up by name, type, size, date and get to needed files almost all the times without hiccups.\n\nWhat do you think, are folders really important for a computer to run in terms of functionalities and technicalities?
