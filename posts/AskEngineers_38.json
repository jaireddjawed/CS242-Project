        "text": "I am trying to visualise a motorised mechanism which could freely traverse a 2 dimensional grid. It is fine to do this by starting at 0,0 before first traversing the X axis until it reaches its destined column, and then moving along the Y axis until it reaches its assigned X,Y coordinates. There would be multiple units on this grid, which is why I don't think something like the rails that something like a 2D printer would work, as that only seems to allow for one unit.\n\nthe challenge is that the grid would be suspended, and the unit would itself suspend something in its centre that would sit below the grid.\n  \nThe problem I keep coming up against is that any design I've tried, the axis' themselves would block traversal due to the suspended object colliding with it. So I guess the grid would need to be hollow slits, with the motorised mechanism sitting above the grid. but then the wheels/ball bearings that move the unit would need to be able to pass over the slits unimpeded, and with a level of accuracy so that can align with the grid when it needs to change direction.  \n\nI have considered that if the Y axis was all straight rails, with a single X axis rail along an edge, a rail system could simply reach the relevant row before heading down it, but that seems to require either a guiding rail to lock off any further traversal along X, or a mechanism on the unit capable of swapping direction of traversal. Plus, if a unit is needed in another column, it has to come all the way back to 0,Y in order to switch, which seems inelegant.\n\nHopefully this makes sense. Does anybody have any technical terms I could Google that might get me closer to a solution?",

        "text": "I recently graduated uni in May with a BS in Chemical Engineering &amp; minored in Chemistry/Mathematics. I've been working as a Process Engineer at a waste treatment facility since March. I didn't get the chance to have an internship or co-op while in school due to family issues (dad died of cancer). So when I was given this opportunity to work in my field, even if it isn't in my desired, first-pick area... I wasn't going to turn it down. Though, anyone knows that O&amp;G plants pay way more than waste treatment plants. I saw this when a friend was offered over 6 figured before we graduated, and I was offered $20k less.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to the now. One of the managers likes working with me and offered the Reliability Engineering position to me since I already am somewhat familiar with the unit. I jokingly told them that the only way I'd accept were if I got a pay raise. This position has been approved for over $30k than what my current salary is. The money aspect is of course very appealing, but this would require me to go from a Process Engineering mindset to a Reliability Engineer's, which typically a MechE's role. \n\nNow, I am conflicted on taking this position. Sure, they have seen some potential in me and that's the reason why they would offer me the role in the first place, but what does being a 'Reliability Engineer' really encompass? Especially when compared to Process Engineering? Considering I have very little experience and have solely worked here in engineering, I don't think it would be a big issue; however, I don't want to bite more than I can swallow. I know meche and cheme courses overlap in some sense, but not completely, and I don't want to make myself look a fool. I don't want the money to be my sole driving force to wind up hurting my career. I may also be overthinking it, but I wanted to get an insight in other people's experience working as one and observing the other or been in the same boat and transitioned.",

        "text": "Hearing more and more about current and future water shortages, i wonder what a good scale of a desalination plant is, and if it can double up for other purposes.\n\nMain question : in the US, using new desalination tech (graphene nano tubes or teflon filters), would it make sense to build a few huge desalination plants and build arge pipeline(s) to get it inland to farms and homes. Say, near Las Vegas which is short on water, but also to pipe excess inland.\nPipeline would pump \"grey water\", desalinated and sanitized by light but local water utilities would use it as rainwater essentially.\nOr, are smaller more numerous plants the better option?\nBeing near water, and remote, could also build solar wind and tidal to power the operation and also supply power to surrounding areas.\n\nSynergies:\nCleanup:  the ocean is polluted with harmful stuff, (trash, heavy metals, c02) while we're pumping all this water, say we pump and clean 2x what we need to use. The extra water is not desalinated, but is cleansed of everything else and returned to the ocean. Primary goal of cleaning is decarbonizing through electrolysis, or whatever the most efficient method would be for water. Profit from future carbon incentives/market. I assume decarbonizing cleaner water is easy, and pumping less acidic water preferable.\nAll that salt: a nearby chemical plant could make use of all the salt we're pulling out, maybe turn a profit on it through chemical production.\n\nSo, more potable water, c02 sequester, cleaning the ocean (however slightly).\n\nThoughts from smart people? I realize it's all half baked, but give me a more realistic version, or tell me it's no good haha",

Thus I‚Äôm hoping that someone with more experience can help me. \n\nMy most probable design has been a small co2 canister (around 16g), with a valve that punctures the top of the canister when activated, leading the co2 out to inflate the balloon. But the valve itself will be very large, at least using my design. \n\nI haven‚Äôt been able to find any valves that does what I want (solenoid require having a punctured canister, which would allow the gas to seep out over time, right?)\n\nThe balloon itself is not a normal balloon (again, think airbag), and the rapid inflation will not break it. \n\nIt is a requirement that it can be set off close to the body, and thus explosives aren‚Äôt an option (tho I have considered it)\n\nHope this is the right sub for this, and I hope someone out there has the perfect solution:)",

This was a simple bracket to fit a different turn signal to an existing part, but.. baby steps, right? \n\nIm finding myself wanting to expand my skillsets with prototyping and development - looking into things like modeling foam to carve samples, as a step in between caliper measurement to CAD model. \n\nI suppose there are two questions here really:\n\n1) What would you consider \"must have\" tools for prototype development at a hobbyist level? \n\n2) Any resources for education on process flow, tooling, skillsets or best practices would be much appreciated. \n\nThanks for your time.",

The idea is that the robust cast iron chandelier can be lowered but not turned and the user would push against it with their upper body while applying the opposite force to the stone floor with their feet, rotating the room. Would this would, could it work better the other way. Any ideas would be super helpful. \n\nJust for some context, the room is a hidden entrance to an evil organisation's secret lair.

I took part in 3 major projects and my staff liked me. I want to stay proficient in engineering because I loved the stuff I did at my old job. I occasionally read my electrical engineering/automation books whenever I have time. I'm wondering if there's any chance that there are job opportunities to work remotely or part time as an engineer?

Is one way better than the other? Do I need any additional circuit components for safety? This is my first circuit outside of a breadboard so I want to make sure I'm not going to burn my house down.

Anyway, it all depended on vacuum, which I didn't have access to. Solution I came up with was ordering the water aspirator adapter and just using some fuel pump I had laying around. It came in and after testing it, it didn't produce any significant vacuum. \n\n\nMy 2 options are: 1) salvaging a broken pressure washer(I don't know if the pump is intact) or 2) using an overkill af jacuzzi pump(a dxd315a). \n\nFrom what I've read it depends on the velocity and is limited by the vapor pressure of the liquid, but it's all I've really found. I guess what I'm asking is if going the jacuzzi pump route is even worth it and if I should just risk it with the pressure washer(because the fittings already match up, I wouldn't have to do any janky conversions, and it's a pressure washer, so the water velocity should be quite good). \n\nSide question: Could I use compressed air with a water aspirator? I hadn't explored this idea because I hadn't found any formulas to calculate the vacuum, and the schematic on wikipedia looks slightly different from a standard water aspirator. I have a decent compressor and could work up to the vacuum required doing it in bursts having a valve in the middle of the vacuum line.",
