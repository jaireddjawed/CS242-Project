A friend of mine kept telling us about how he gave him all the right answers yet he was scolding him for no apparent reason and when my friend told him that something wasn‚Äôt in our curriculum the examiner kept exploded in his face and told him ‚Äú Don‚Äôt debate me ‚Äú.  \n\nNaturally, I tried to avoid going into that exam room and was making my way into the next room when suddenly I was ushered by a dr to the first room where the scary examiner was. \n I gave in without a fight and thought to myself it‚Äôs alright you do what you have to do to survive lol. \n\nI was doing okay with the patient while the scary examiner was boring holes into my back and breathing down my neck. He asked a few questions that were relevant to the case and told me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre free to go you got the full-mark, it was the pulse examination that saved you‚Äù we had 2 examinations palpation of the spleen and examining the pulse and commenting on both, he didn‚Äôt even ask me to comment a full comment and he just let me go. Other students gave him a perfect full comment and he wasn‚Äôt satisfied yet he let me off the hook without even having to complete the examination. \n\nSo, that taught me that  grades have nothing to do with your competence and that sometimes luck is on your side. So regardless of your grade the real assessment is when you graduate and practise medicine for real.",

Here's the case:\nMr. J, age 21, came to your pharmacy complaining of severe nasal congestion with headache and blurred vision for 3 days. Mr. J works as a painter and decorator. The patient said he had recently experienced flu-like symptoms. The patient also used 2 paracetamol tablets to relieve his headache even briefly. Mr J's friend told him to use antihistamines to treat his complaint. Therefore, Mr J would like to consult and seek your recommendation. Mr. J would like to consult and seek your recommendation as a pharmacist in the pharmacy.\n\nIt is known that Mr. J has a history of asthma since childhood and a history of allergy to penicillin.\n\nQuestions:\n1. What questions did you as a pharmacist ask the patient to assess Mr. J's medical condition?\n2. The patient was found to have yellowish-green nasal discharge for the previous 3 days along with facial and nasal pain. The patient also complained of loss of smell and taste since experiencing flu symptoms in the past week. No fever was found in the patient. Based on the symptoms, as a pharmacist you suspect Mr. J has acute sinusitis. What are the factors that can trigger sinusitis?\n3. What is the appropriate treatment recommendation for Mr. J's condition?\n4. Should Mr. J need to be treated with beclomethasone nasal spray? J need beclomethasone nasal spray therapy? If yes, please explain how to use the medication?\n5. Mr. J's complaints were not improving so he decided to see his general practitioner as Mr. J had a fever, dizziness, slight hearing loss and ear pain. The doctor then called you to ask for a recommendation of an appropriate antibiotic for Mr. J, what antibiotic did you recommend? Explain the reason for prescribing the antibiotic?",

He received multiple rounds of epinephrine and over 2L of IVF but he is still hypotensive (70/P) He also has an elevated troponin (0.01 ng/mL -&gt; 1.08 ng/mL ) I'm assuming the troponin indicates that this patient is having an MI due to the increased oxygen demand from epinephrine as well as reduced supply due to persistent hypotension.\n\nHere's what I don't understand: we are given two sets of lab values taken a couple hours apart, one in the field and one by the hospital. The first set has a Hct of 43% and Hgb 14.0. The second set has Hct 22% and Hgb still 14.0.\n\nI have looked everywhere (Harrison's, Rosen's, Dr. Google, etc) trying to understand if, and how, hematocrit could fall this much while hemoglobin stays the same. Unless there's something about the way that these two assays are performed in the lab, I can't understand why this patient's hematocrit would have fallen while the hemoglobin remained the same. I tried googling \"hemolytic anemia anaphylaxis\" but all I got was a few references to hemolysis in mice.\n\nShould I email my professor and ask if this was a typo? He's a very smart guy but also not a doctor so it wouldn't shock me if this were the case.",

        "text": "The top two posts today and yesterday were just about dental students thinking their program is harder than medical school, and then subsequently bashing the fuck out of them. \n\nFirst off, why dental students? They‚Äôre about the closest thing to med students besides med students. Their curricula in preclinicals is basically a light version of  medicine preclinicals plus teeth. They have to take full body anatomy, they have to take pharmacology, they take path and oral path‚Ä¶ things that have nothing to do with dentistry like Crohn‚Äôs, xeroderma pigmentosum, reading an EKG, MS, liver failure, and osteoporosis are all part of the curriculum although obviously to a much lesser degree considering they also have to do teeth (which are way more complicated than I thought before I met my roommate). By the way, MD/DO students don‚Äôt know shit about the tooth which is honestly kind of a shame, but I digress.\n\nI doubt this is a popular opinion especially in this subreddit, but dental school is HARD. I won‚Äôt speak for M-3/M-4 year, because I haven‚Äôt been there yet, but for preclinicals at least the difficulty is at least on par if not slightly worse. I literally live with a dental student, and their life is so much worse than mine. Not only do they have to study roughly as much as I do, they have to go into lab and do a ton of micromanaged drilling/crown/veneering work every weekend. They put in *effort*, and I find it sad that the knee jerk reaction from this subreddit when dental students say this isn‚Äôt ‚Äúman, dental school sucks too, we‚Äôre all in this together‚Äù. It‚Äôs ‚Äúhahah you little bitch your program is so much easier than mine so stop complaining.‚Äù \n\nIn terms of clinicals, they likely have a better schedule than we do, and residency is optional for them. But for preclinicals I‚Äôd definitely say dental school is no cakewalk. A dentist and maybe a pharmacist are the only two professions I would feel comfortable referring to as ‚Äúdoctors‚Äù in a healthcare setting besides an MD/DO.\n\nRe: ‚Äúif medical school is so east why didn‚Äôt you do it‚Äù? Well, asshat, it‚Äôs cause they wanted to do *dentistry*. If you had your heart set on dermatology or optho and they were separate programs from med school like dental is, wouldn‚Äôt you go to that program over med school? The dental students I‚Äôve met have been, bar none, the most enthusiastic about their field across all the health professions. They just really like teeth. I don‚Äôt get it but there it is.\n\nIs med school hard? Sure is. Does residency suck? More than 90% of other jobs. But that doesn‚Äôt mean other things aren‚Äôt also difficult to do. Your own suffering doesn‚Äôt give you the right to laugh at others. The natural human reaction is to think that you have it worse than everyone else, and that‚Äôs true for medical and dental students both. Don‚Äôt fall into the trap.",

        "text": "Hey lol.\n\nSo I have been carrying this incorrect opinion/mentality with me for all my life that has made my life more difficult in key moments and is now keeping me from doing as good of a job as I can as I apply to residencies and prepare for future interviews. I know it's wrong, but I'm pretty stubborn about it. I know I need to do some self reflection and prove to myself how silly/immature I'm being, and so I'm reaching out for someone to just lecture me to the point of regretting even posting this. Tbh I already feel pretty cringey for posting this, but I'm also looking to find out if just maybe my idea has some merit to it and see if anyone has tried anything similar with positive results.\n\nAnyway, I have a really hard time writing Personal statements, Letters of Rec, etc, or answering interview questions that ask me to highlight positive personal attributes and things of this sort. My \"incorrect opinion\" is that all the suggested responses I find online feel so synthetic, so typical, so uninspiring. Worse than that, it paints this picture of this perfect student who always knew what they wanted and never stumbled on their way. It also bothers me that we are asked to describe ourselves with this impressive list of adjectives that would make for a good physician as if that is proof of anything. Like \"look at me, i spent an hour on [thesaurus.com](https://thesaurus.com) and rehearsed these sentences so that i can say with confidence that I am empathetic and hardworking\". I have also never understood how professors and attendings are able to write letters of rec for all these students. Like how do they have the energy to pump out the same BS phrases and descriptions for a bunch of students they barely know?? I'm terrified of being in that position one day. \n\nIn my mind I have this fantasy that residency approval officials are secretly miserable having to read another paint-by-numbers application and wish someone would just take a chance and submit a personal statement or answer an interview question by highlighting all the mistakes they've made and how they have grown as a person, and how they seriously wished they didn't do medicine halfway into med school, and how they only realized they wanted to do specialty X instead of Y during the last year of the program and now their previous clinical experience or shadowing seems less relevant, etc. Is there really no room for being authentic and open about your hiccups and demonstrating how you have grown into a person that would make a great physician? Are the only ways to grow as a med student through clinical experiences?\n\nOkay so that's my childish little rant. Be as critical as you'd like, it's very much welcomed and appreciated. I realize that this mentality is immature and holding me back and I want to be rid of it. I'd like to point out that I do realize that it's all just part of the game. As much as I hate it it's not like I could come up with a better method of selecting candidates for residency. I guess I just want someone to let me know I'm not crazy? I am alone in feeling this feels so fake/gross? I guess it's also  obvious from my description that I am someone who stumbled a lot through medical school and realizes they have a lot to own up to and so I just can't stand the thought of trying to act like it's been all sunshine and rainbows and that I never experienced a doubt about any of it. I don't think it would be dishonest of me to describe myself as having the qualities needed to be a good doctor, but I just feel disgusted at having to present such an idealized version.\n\nThank you for reading this. It was therapeutic for me just to write it all out haha. I look forward to any insight I can get from your responses. And especially to be made to feel like a little child ;)\n\nTL;DR: is there any room to be authentic about your mistakes, your doubts, your mess of a medical school experience during your residency interviews or in the application? Am I alone in feeling this feels fake and gross? Thanks!",

        "text": "I dont know if this a hot take, but I would consider Boards&amp;Beyond a very overrated resource. Everyone in my school spends all day watching his videos, but I don't think BnB is very good at all. \n\nDr. Jason Ryan is often just reading off facts from First Aid, and he rarely takes the time to explain things conceptually. If Step 1 was still scored and knowing low-yield facts was still the name of the game, perhaps I could see the utility of his videos as a supplement. But I think that watching Pathoma + doing a supplemental QBank is far more effective in actually understanding physiology &amp; pathology, and will prepare a student much better for Step 1 and the wards.",
