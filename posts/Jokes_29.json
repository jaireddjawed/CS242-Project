I know a ton of old jokes and I see many of them here in English, even though I first heard them as a kid in Croatian from people I know don't speak a word of English.\n\nMany of them kinda spread around Europe, I'm guessing through the 20th century. Probably by publications translating 'joke books', or putting jokes in those cheap little magazines that used to exist, with the puzzles, crosswords and 'funny' comics\n\nI wonder about their origins sometimes\n\nWhen I was a kid I had a database of jokes downloaded from the Internet (that I didn't have access to at the time), but I know most of them predated the Web.",

But it's not like the psychic is just guessing or anything, because the answers they give are very specific, and pertain to the most random shit imaginable.\n\nKnowing this disconnect between the reality the psychic is predicting, and the potential to break the timeline, you can see the psychic's relief when people ask the correct question. The psychic will even say things like \"that's correct\", just to confirm that all is good after one of the people he's talking to completes the odd time loop.\n\nIt's funny, even though you never see any sign of danger, there's still the prospect looming overhead that someone will say the wrong thing and shatter the timeline.
