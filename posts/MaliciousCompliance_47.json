The first half of the test was multiple choice and the second half an essay based off the prompt. It had been like an hour and I was getting hand cramps and exhausted so when I got to the essay section. The prompt was right about having a positive attitude and the little engine that could. Now I am and always have been a huge pessimist. The glass half full bullshit always annoyed me. And especially at the time I was kind of emo stressed as hell I thought the people who we're all smiley telling me I needed a more positive attitude we're annoying. So I wrote an essay about how positive attitudes are bad. Mostly tongue and cheek I didn't really Believe it but I didn't feel like writing the essay they wanted. So I wrote a outlandish fake story about breaking my leg playing track and said if the engine had failed it would have been more devastating because he thought he could. I filled the whole page and got a three out of four score despite my mom being pissed ",

They let you customize your items, and I've been using them to my own nefarious ends.  I always order a You Pick Two combo - half a sandwich, half a salad.  However, I futz with the ingredients, because they let you specify light/normal/extra in many cases, and it's free for most toppings and veggies.  \n\nI'd routinely order my half salad with added extra spinach, added extra arugula, etc. to basically get something like double the normal amount of greens.  Same for sandwich toppings: double tomatoes, double onions.  This resulted in comically big (but still relatively healthy) sandwiches and salads.  They couldn't have been fun to make.  \n\nWe don't really go to a single Panera too frequently so I doubt I was recognized, but I'm sure I wasn't the first person to try this technique.\n\nToday, my uppance came.  I did my usual hacked salad, only instead of the normal half-size salad bowl, I got what looked like a full-size salad bowl, densely packed with spinach, Romaine lettuce, and arugula.  It was one of those \"you want it?  Okay, we'll give you EXACTLY what you wanted!\" moments.  Classic \"don't waste food!\" guilt kicked in.  I ate that entire salad, and the comically large sandwich (there were five slices of tomato in there along with thicker than normal slices of red onion, resulting in a jaw-buster).  The apple on the side I saved for later. \n\nIt's roughly three hours after I ate that salad and I still feel bloated and disgusting.  \n\nPanera staff, well played.  I will save my salad hacking for extra cilantro and basil next time and leave the core veggies alone.  ",

I knew that if I took it down, the guy who made it would just make another and put another up, so I decided on another method.

Never click links in emails blah blah blah. This in conjunction with a few other policies and procedures leads to an interesting chain of events every few months.\n\nOne of the metrics that upper management considers the most critical is staying up to date with security and integrity training. This system sends out an email every time we need to re-up our training. With a link to the training web page. The security training, ironically, always includes a section on email security which says to never click links in emails.\n\nIT security has seen fit to give us a handy little tool in Outlook called Phish Alarm. When we click the button the email we have up is deleted and a report is sent to them. So every few months the following chain of events takes place.\n\nThe training email is sent out with a link. ~120 phishing reports for that email are registered. IT security sends out an email the next day saying that it's alright to click the link... and includes the link. ~120 phishing reports for *that* email are registered. Lower management steps in and sends a similar email. With predictable results. Higher and higher management are involved with increasing levels of urgency as the deadline approaches. All of which are responded to with 120 phishing reports.\n\nFinally, every single time, an email is sent out from the CEO's assistant without any links directing us on how to access the training page and how to complete the training.\n\nTL;DR Never click links in emails! Always click links in emails!",

        "text": "This happened yesterday, and though it might seem like a confused child, it was really my mistake for giving the wrong rule at the wrong time.\n\nSo my husband, my housemate, my 3 and a half year old and I went out by a creek to cut some willows. While they figured out where to start cutting I sat with my son throwing rocks in the creek. It was a cool day out (45Â° F) and my son asked to play in the water so I told him \"No, it's too cold. We don't want your feet to get wet cuz you'll get cold and you could get sick.\" My son said \"Oh, Ok. Well... Can I put my hand in the water?\" I told him that it was very nice to ask and yes he could. When he touch the water he said \"Oh yep, you're right! Its cold! I like that water!\" We spent a little more time throwing rocks before moving down by a driveway bridge to cut the willows and he only accidentally stepped on a wet rock once, but not actually in the creek.\n\nHere's where the Malicious compliance comes in. While the guys were bundling the cut willows my son was playing with a couple sticks, throwing things in the creek and a puddle on the driveway. Of course the whole time I'm reminding him to not get too close to the creek because he could fall, we don't want his feet wet, don't step in the puddle etc, and the whole time he was repeating and following the rules perfectly. At one point he's dropped a stick in the puddleand he comes and tells me and without thinking (it's so easy to get stuck in parrot mode) I say \"remember, we don't step in the creek, now grab your stick\" and he looks at me and says \"Oh, Ok! That makes a lot of sense.\" Before smiling and stepping right in the puddle. \n\nI know the rules say \"no confused children\" but I also know there wasn't an ounce of confusion in that boy in that moment. He knows puddles from creeks, and he knew he wasn't stepping in the creek, he was stepping in a puddle. It was the cutest malicious compliance I've ever seen and I couldn't even be mad at him because it was really my fault.",

        "text": "I was reminded of this when reading the comments from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/7vmq9e/travel_expense_compliance/).\n\nBack at a previous employer my team used to do a lot of travel to various datacentres. Some of these were in places that it was easy to drive to, some where public transport was more efficient and a few where either was viable. So the sensible thing, which we did was to use the most efficient for of transport for the occasion. \n\nAll was good in the world until those responsible for travel decided that they needed to know more about our cars and driving. This was explained as a the company having a duty of care. Now some of the questions regarding the state of maintenance of the vehicle and medical fitness to drive were fine and I had no issues with those. Other questions such as how often we wash the cars and where they are serviced seemed much less relevant. Some questions were much more personal and from advice I obtained, were not legal to ask. We queried this with HR and were told to just ignore the forms.\n\nSo we carried on as before and just ignored the forms, submitting expense claims as usual. Fine until one way the automated system would not allow the mileage to be entered as it had been blocked for not completing the intrusive detail form. Spoke again to HR who said that there was noting they could do as it was a finance issue. Spoke to finance who would not lift the block until the form had been completed.\n\nSome people completed the form under duress. I am more stubborn. That was the last day I drove on company business.\n\nOne of the datacentres was in a place I could fairly easily drive to. It would generally take not much over an hour each way. When I was working there I would generally arrive around 8 and leave sometime after 4, so would be on-site for 7+ hours, allowing for a lunch break. Now getting there by public transport was a real pain. It involved 2 train journeys and a bus. If I left home at the same time as I would when driving, I would arrive sometime between 10:30 and 11. To get home for the usual time, I would need to leave around 2:30 in the afternoon. With the contracted lunch break, I was not on-site for more than 3 hours. As you can imagine, productivity dropped.\n\nAnother datacentre was in a rough area. Fine during the daytime, but not an area I would feel safe walking at night. This is one that could be reached fairly easily by car or train. If I knew I would be working late, I would previously always drive. Now that it was train or bus everywhere, I got agreement from my management that if I was working after normal working hours, I could take a taxi. My original intention was to just take the taxi to the main station in the city, but on sever occasions I was working until after the last train, so had to take the taxi all the way home. Never had any trouble getting the Â£100 taxi fair reclaimed.\n\nTL;DR Company rejected mileage claims and paid a lot more in taxi fairs and lost hours of work.",

        "text": "This is a long one. So, let's cycle back to my junior year of high school.\n\nI was in our school's program \"gifted and talented\" for art. This is just a program that is supposed to ensure my spots in art classes and provide me with resources to further my education. It's actually kind of a broken system but we're not focusing on that today. \n\nWe had 2 art teachers at my school. One was a younger man who taught freshman art (art 1&amp;2), and the other was an older woman, about 60 something, who was in charge of senior art (art 3,4,5 which was all one class). Let's call the man M and the woman H. H has worked at the school longer so she always saw herself as the better and more experienced teacher. (Imo, I consider that false.)\n\nSo I'm in H's senior art my junior year. Myself and another boy in her class, call him L, are both supposed to be advanced level and be getting our own projects. Now, H is definitely a hippie, I wouldn't be surprised if she comes to school high. She gives off a \"idgaf\" vibe a lot. That year, she was going through a divorce and would have terrible mood swings in class. She basically just lets everyone do what they want, it doesn't even have to be art related. Some people just sit around and talk the whole time. She has no curriculum to speak of. I had friends in the class so we would sit around and doodle in our sketch books and talk.\n\nL, however, was fed up with H not teaching and went to the junior councilor. The councilor placed L in M's class as an independent study student. This is where the trouble starts.\n\nH takes this as a huge insult that L would leave her class. She stands up in front of all us after finding out L was no longer in her class, and starts making fun him. She calls him a mama's boy and that he's too much of a wimp and crybaby to be in her class and that she better not see him in her room again.\n\nAll of us are very weirded out and uncomfortable by it. We don't say anything and none of us mention it to L.\n\nHer mood swings get even worse from then on. Our class is the last of the day. The bell hasn't even rung yet and some of us are still filing in. H starts yelling at all of us to shut up and take our seats. As soon as the bell rings she slams the door and starts lecturing all of us on how rude we are, how we take advantage of her letting us do our own work, and how we talk too much. She says we're loud and awful students. Mind you she hasn't ever really said anything about talking, other than once or twice to some girls to not talk so loudly. (We found out later than the class before ours was actually the loud ones).\n\nAnyway, H hands out a sheet to everyone. On it are a list of various quotes about silence and a prompt. She tells us to pick a quote and write a two page essay about silence based on the quote we pick. Everyone goes home angry about the essay.\n\nI tell my mother about it as my mom was a teacher at an elementary school in the same district. She's also bothered but tells me to do the essay anyway. That's when I get a smart ass idea.\n\nObviously, H wanted people to kiss up to her and tell her they'll be good quiet children in their papers. HOWEVER, the prompt never detailed that we had to write that silence is good. It just said we needed to relate the quote to our essay. So I pick a quote; \"silence is a friend that will never betray you.\" I take it and I write an essay on how silence is actually BAD and leads to bullying because people are scared to speak up, lowkey taking a shot at H. My mom approves.\n\nNext day, we turn in our papers. All my friends know what I have done. My paper just happens to be the one on top. H reads it and immediately calls me to the front of the classroom. She gives a fake laugh.\n\nH: What is this?\n\nMe: The essay you asked us to write.\n\nH: No, I want to know what you think this is.\n\nMe: It's an essay. I did exactly what the prompt asked. \n\nH then gets extremely pissy, proceeds to read it outloud to the class, trying to nitpick my paper on grammar (which my English major sister had checked so I knew was right) and then crumples it up and throws it away.\n\nH: Rewrite it. I want it tomorrow or you're failing the class.\n\nI shrug and go back to my seat. I didn't really care at this point. Overhead, the announcements for club meetings come on, and I and several people leave.\n\nThe next day, all my friends come up to me in the morning. Everyone is in a tizzy. Apparently, after leaving for clubs, H tried to accuse me of skipping class. My friends had spoken up and said I went to a club. Bitter, H said:\n\n\"I hate that girl. She's such a fucking bitch.\"\n\nTo the whole class.\n\nEveryone heard her.\n\nI immediately send an email to my mother explaining what I had heard and what happened yesterday. My mom is at her own school and gets very upset. The principal at my mother's school knows me very well and likes my mom as an employee. She catches my mom upset and after explaining what happened, now the principal is mad. The principal is a battle axe of a woman, lemme tell you, and her husband works for the central office AKA the big bosses of all the school district. She immediately calls her husband and tells him to get to our high school to figure out was is going on.\n\nSo basically our high school principal (who was only a vice/sub bc our real principal was on Coast Guard duty at the time) suddenly has his big bosses show up, everyone in H's classes gets called in to give their details of the story, they take a copy of H's paperwork for supposed grades/curriculum  (which has barely any), and they take a copy of my essay.\n\nH gets booted on extended leave, and also has to wait 6 months to come back to school. The class gets a sub for the rest of the year. \n\nShe didn't get fired but she came close.\n\nTL;DR \n\nI wrote an essay with a vague enough prompt to piss off my teacher, and she called me a bitch in front of the class and I almost got her fired. The end.\n\nEdit: spelling",

I didn't want to \"tattle.\" (I wasn't the only person who had a problem with this woman. Multiple people quit because of her, and almost everyone hated her.)\n\nI applied for the job in October and interviewed in November. In February (three entire months later!), they finally had me in for a \"performance review.\" They told me that my work was fantastic, everyone loved it, and some people were requesting that I do their stuff instead of my coworker who had the same job.\n\nThe catch? I had bad \"teamwork skills,\" and there had been some \"negative instances.\" This was bullshit, completely. Most people in that company loved me, and multiple people begged me to stay.\n\nThey told me they couldn't offer me the full time position, yet. I could either work to improve these vague, one-sided issues, or I could train my replacement when they found someone. I chose the latter. They hired this girl temp too (but she got more hours than me). I taught her how to do my entire job, including maintaining the website (unrelated to my actual job, but I was the only one who knew how to use Wordpress).\n\nShe confessed to me that she was looking outside the company for a full time position, especially after seeing what happened with me.\n\nI talked to my (good) coworkers in the weeks after I left, and they said it was awful.

        "text": "This happened years ago when I was in high school, during a Christian Education exam. Basically it was an open book (bring a Bible) exam that quizzed you on Christian ideals, stories, blah blah.\n\nOne question tried to gauge our response to a scene they laid out in the question where someone is challenging organised religion. However, they had actually used one of the early scenes in the film \"Dogma\" (without any reference), where the angel Loki is deliberately trying to confuse a nun and shake her faith just to 'keep the clergy on their toes' as he puts it. If you haven't seen the movie, it's a pretty vulgar film about someone losing and regaining their faith but also two angels going crazy and killing a lot of people. Not exactly the most family-friendly Christian movie!\n\nThe question was:\n\nRead this dialogue. What is your response to it?\n\nNun: So, you don't believe in God...because of Alice in Wonderland?\n\nAtheist: No, Through the Looking Glass,Â that poem \"The Walrus and the Carpenter\" that's an indictment of organised religion. The walrus, with his girth and good nature, obviously represents either Buddha or, with his tusks, the Hindu elephant god Lord GaneshaÂ â that takes care of your eastern religions. Now the carpenter, which is an obvious reference to Jesus Christ who was raised a carpenter's son, he represents the western religions. Now in the poem, what do they do? What do they do? They dupe all these oysters into following them and then proceed to shuck and devour the helpless creaturesÂ en masse.\n\n*\n\nAs it happens, I had watched Dogma the evening before and this scene was fresh in my memory, so knowing that they copied the dialogue from that movie, I decided to answer the question by continuing the scene, denunciation of organised religion and swearing included! They couldn't mark me down for literally completing the scene they copied word for word right?\n\nMy answer:\nTo me it says that following these faiths based on mythological figures ensures the destruction of one's inner being. Organised religion destroys who we are by inhibiting our actions and our decisions out of fear of some intangible parent figure, who shakes a finger at us from thousands of years ago and says \"Do it, do it and I'll fucking spank you!\"\n\ntldr:\nI got full marks in a Christian Education exam for denouncing religion and swearing by catching the teachers out in some plagiarism.\n\nEdit:\nI know it wasn't actual plagiarism on their part. I just meant they copied a scene but didn't say where it was from and probably assumed people wouldn't know the context of the dialogue.",

        "text": "My High School English teacher told me this story from when he was a young teacher in the 60's.  The teachers were negotiating with the school for better salaries and either being unwilling or unable to strike chose a work slowdown instead.\n\nBack then, there was no time clock to punch in.  Instead, teachers signed in at a single sign in sheet on a clipboard affixed to a desk in the main office.  Teachers signed in when they showed up to be ready for 1st period at 7:30.  But, according to the teacher's employee handbook, the exact wording was all teachers must sign in AT 7am.\n\nSo, the first day of the slow down, every teacher arrived at work and got on line to sign the sign in sheet at exactly 7am.  The sheet had a single pencil on a string, so besides everyone signing in slowly, several of the teachers pushed too hard in order to break the pencil tip, wasting more time sharpening it.\n\nSome teachers didn't get to their first class until 4th period.",

If he wins, they have to give him 30 tunics; if they win, he has to give them 30 tunics They have until the day of the wedding but canât figure it out.

Without telling him her motive, she gets the answer out of Samson and divulges it to his opponents. They tell him the answer and he immediately knows they cheated and his bride-to-be told them. This is where the compliance comes in. He goes to a town of the people he was selected by God to overcome and kills 30 men, removed them of their tunics and gives them to his opponents per their deal. Perhaps the first ever recorded malicious compliance ",

        "text": "When I was a teen, I worked a department store that we will call J-Mart. One of the things that J-Mart is/was known for is their \"red light\" specials. For those of you who aren't aware, back then, there used to be a literal \"red light\" on a wheelable stand with a \"red light\" on a pole that you could turn on to announce to shoppers that there was a temporary sale on one item or other. The hope was that the flashing \"red light\" would attract shoppers to buy whatever item was on sale for an even greater discount than normal.\n\nI worked in one of the specialty departments at that store and since the department manager or any of the full time employees hated working evenings or weekends, they would leave those shifts solely for the part-time high school kids, like me. On my shifts I was frequently given a list of items that my manager wanted \"red lighted\" and the discounts to give. I hated doing them as I had to get on the store overhead microphone and announce it. I would usually do one per shift and just report to my manager that I was too busy with customers or my other job responsibilities. This was rarely a lie. I was always working my ass off. After several months, she figured out I was doing only a small fraction of the \"red light\" specials I was asked to do. She got pissed off one Friday shift and said that weekend (I was scheduled to work both Saturday and Sunday) that I had to do a \"red light\" special every 20 minutes all day, both days. Not only that, I had to get the store manager to sign a log that she specially made that I did so. Okay. Fine. You want a signature from the extraordinarily busy store managers?  I can do that.\n\nSo, from 8am to 6pm, both days I got on the store overhead mic and announced my 10 minute sales for 10% off winter gloves or air filters or whatever. So, every 20 minutes, I called overhead for the manager to come to the Sports/Auto counter, so he could sign my form. The first 4 or 5 times, the assistant manager came. After that, he would just ignore me and sign them off *en masse*. On the second day, the store manager was working, and he only lasted 3 or 4 signatures before he asked why I was doing this. I told him that my dept mgr required me to do this and to get a store manager's signature. He told me that she had not asked them first and that they were way too busy to keep doing it. He told me to stop calling him and to just do my \"red lights\" as I was able.\n\nMy next shift was several days later and the rumor was that my dept mgr was called into the storm manager's office on Monday morning and torn a new one. That rule for a manager's signature was never repeated. We had to continue doing \"red lights\" but they were secondary to our other myriad of job duties, just as it was before.\n\nUnfortunately, for the rest of the time I worked their, my work friends all referred to me as \"Mr. Red Light\". But knowing my boss got reamed out over it, made it okay.",

Itâs mostly about my troll of a father, I was just a man caught in the crossfire.\n\nOne day at school I received a packet of homework, a few sheets of paper with various assignments. Standard fare kid work along the lines of âwrite about your favorite animal and draw it in the boxâ. \n\nOne of the pages asked me to draw myself in a blizzard.\n\nI thought for a few minutes about what a blizzard might actually look like. Now this is in coastal Virginia and the most snow I had ever seen at this point in my life was a few inches. Hell, a light dusting is enough to shut the city down. But then I remembered my dad... He was born and raised in rural Minnesota where snow is a fact of life. So I asked him what a real-life blizzard is like. \n\nâLeave it blank. Thatâs pretty much how it looksâ\n\nSo the next day I turned in my work along with the rest of the class for the teacher to mount on the wall. The other kidsâ drawings contained purple snowmen, orange blobs, about what youâd expect from a bunch of 5 year olds. When the teacher got to mine, she paused and then motioned for me to come have a word with her.\n\nâDid you forget to do the assignment?â\n\nâNope.â\n\nâWell you didnât draw anything. You were supposed to create something using your imaginationâ\n\nâWell thatâs what a blizzard looks like. My dad told me so.â\n\nDad got called in for a parent-teacher conference. Looking back, it was absolutely ridiculous to organize a meeting over something so petty, but dad was ecstatic about going in to defend âthe drawingâ. He was savoring every second of the petty. I can clearly remember him revving up before the meeting by putting on a suit and tie and telling my sister and I stories of life in the Arctic extreme and hunting deer in 3 feet of snow. This teacher didnât stand a chance.\n\nThe next day I went into class and my blank piece of paper was pinned on the wall with the rest of the drawings complete with a âgreat jobâ smiley face sticker.",

It will be a little over or under. If I went over or under, I would always ask the customer if the amount was ok before printing the label and most people were fine with it. If they weren't fine with it, I was fine with fixing it. Within reason.\n\nThis older gentleman came in. He wanted 1 lb of potato salad and was very demanding and rude. I scooped the salad, weighed it, and it was slightly under 1 lb. I asked if that was OK, and he said no, I asked for 1 lb, no less. So I added a little, and this time it was slightly over 1 lb. I asked if that was OK and he said no, I asked for 1 lb. Getting irritated, I took some out. Too much, and I knew it was too much, but I did it anyway. I weighed it, looked at the customer and he shook his head. So I added more, too much again. Customer is still not OK with this, so I took too much out. He wasnt OK with this, so I added some more. He finally got sick of this and said it was fine.",

        "text": "So this is not quite as malicious as others I have read, but I thought it fit in well.\n\nENG: English Teacher\n\nIn my sophomore year of high school I had an an English teacher that would make us write these things called âPerfect Paragraphs.â What these were were hand written paragraphs about a topic he chose and we had to make sure there were ZERO mistakes. If you did have a mistake on the Perfect Paragraph, you had to rewrite the entire thing and turn it in again. You had to do this until you got it ârightâ and received a lower grade every subsequent time you turned a new copy in. ENGâs reasoning behind these were to prepare us in case we ever had to write a paragraph where a computer was not present (this was in 2008 so itâs not as if computers just came out).\n\nAlso, as a reference to how absurd these were, once my friend turned one in but ENG told him he indented the entire paragraph and made him write it again [friend was a quarter inch off the blue (red?) line on the piece of paper].\n\nOne week ENG assigned a Perfect Paragraph on âWhat is it that you wish for?â Upon hearing this I got the great idea to write what I had always wished for in his class: To Not Write Perfect Paragraphs. I wrote out the paragraph about how they were a waste of time, would not be useful in my future endeavors, and how if I really needed to write a meaningful paragraph I would always be able to type it out. This took about 2 hours to write as I meticulously wrote out each word and ensured my grammar (and spacing!) was spot on.\n\nThe next day rolls around and Iâm giddy with excitement to turn it in. I tell my friends in class about it and they think itâs the greatest thing since sliced bread. We all turn in our papers and then proceed to read a book we were assigned (I believe Interstellar Pig) while he grades the papers.\n\nAbout half way through his grading I hear a small laugh from him and then he says loudly to me from across the room âThatâs a bunch of crap JimTheReader!â He walks across the classroom to me to hand over the graded Perfect Paragraph. A perfect 20/20. \n\nCompliance never felt so good.\n\nTDLR: English teacher made us hand write paragraphs on a topic he chose; âwhat do you wish forâ was a topic one week; I wrote one about how I wish I didnât have to write them; turned it in and got a perfect score : )",

Once in a while our front line leaders (FLL) will walk around and check on the cumulative footage. My machine is the only one in the plant that does not have a computer. So I can't log my footage. Now back earlier in the old ancient times before computers were even made, you were supposed to write your logs down and have a FLL sign off on the daily log. Now front line leaders come and go every couple of months, some of them are so nosey to see what your footage is like. The first FLL I talked with asked me to fill out a paper here, and not worry about him signing it, so I did just that, for almost a year. I started last May. So I have roughly 280 sheets of paper in my locker of unsigned log sheets.\n\nMy current FLL comes up to me and asks me what my footage looks like, hes been particularly nosey lately and has been pissing pur department off a lot lately. I told him I got the document here, and he sees that a FLL should be signing it every sheet. He started going abeshit over the fact that he hasn't been told to sign a document that has almost nothing to do with him. I said \"I don't have a computer so I've been writing them in these things. I have more.\" He signs it and says \"bring me anything else you got.\" And takes my log along with him.\n\nI went to my locker, brought 280 pages of logs from last year, put it on his desk when I walked in his office and his jaw dropped.\n\nFLL: \"You kept a lot\"\n\nMe: \"Yep, every single one of them. They all need signatures.\"\n\nNow this plant is a \"zero waste\" place. I told him he needs to sign every single one of them and not just throw them out. He comes back to me a day later and gives me my stack of documents and says:\n\n\"If its been going on like this since you started, I think we'll keep it that way.\" And he stopped bothering me about it.\n\nThey're still not signed. Im waiting for the next guy to ask me about it. Or I could just get a computer at my machine. That would fix every single problem I've been having.\n\n**Tl;dr**: front line leader sees he has to sign a \"daily log\" document, realized I kept roughly 280 pages of documents since I started, ends up not signing them, and leaves me alone.",

        "text": "I just finished binged reading this sub and wanted to share my own story. \n\nThis was a couple years ago (2014) \nI was in college working for a pretty well known retail clothing store letâs call it Perpetually 21 (P21). I started as a floor associate but pretty quickly moved up to a cashwrap associate and eventually ended up being a cashwrap lead. This means you are in charge of the register area counting money, approving discounts, and line deletes. A line delete is when one of your cashiers accidentally scans an item twice or scans the wrong one and you or a manager have to be called over to input a code to remove the item. And you must do this for every time for each line. It got annoying at times especially with new hires but it was my job so I dealt with it. \n\nAnyways, P21 is a corporate ran company so every couple months a District Manager (DM) would come in and evaluate the store. Our DM took her job way too seriously and tended to forget that the majority of her employees were high school/college aged kids just trying to make money. She would also pull a floor associate to be her personal shopper when she would come visit which all of us dreaded. After one of her âshopping spreesâ she came up to the register and I was the one checking her out.  We exchanged pleasantries, had normal conversation and she left with her purchases. I didnât think much of it until later on during my shift, when my associate manager (AM) pulled me aside and this conversation happened: \n\nAM:Hey Maeheda727, DM wants me to pull off cashwrap. Iâm sorry. \n\nMe: What?! Why? \n\nAM: She said you talked too fast during your check out and she felt rushed. \n\nMe: Oh, well okay then, whatever, so do you want me to go the floor then? \n\nAM: No, weâre short on cashiers so Iâll need you up front but I have to take down your clearance code. \n\nSo Iâm pretty bummed but itâs not like I was getting more pay at being in one position or the other (trying to get a raise there was trash). We start to get a little busy and this particular P21 is MASSIVE the building used to be a department store. So to communicate with other employees in other sections of the store we use walkie-talkies. So I call up some extra help over the walkie and they send over two new hires (NH1 &amp; 2). A couple hours into my shift, this happens: \n\nNH1: Hey Maeheda727! I made a mistake can you delete my line?\n\nMe: Actually I canât, DM took away my clearance this morning so my code wonât work, youâll have to call AM. \n\nSo they call over AM but for those of you who work in retail know that managers never come immediately when called. NH1 is just staring apologetically at the customer because all we can do is wait. 10 minutes pass. \n\nNH2: Uhhh Maeheda727! I made a mistake can you delete this line? \n\nMe: Nope! You gotta call over AM again, sorry! \n\nWe now have 2 out of 3 registers at a stand still and a line forming. I have NH1 take over my register and go look for AM. Turns out that AM was in a meeting with DM in the office and they had their walkies off.\n \n*Knock knock*\nMe: Hi sorry to bother but we need a line delete at the register. \n\nDM (looking annoyed that I interrupted their meeting: Why canât you do it? dO i hAVe tO Do eVeRyTHInG?! \n\nAM: Uhm you had me take away their codes this morning. \n\n*Phone rings* \n AM jumps to answer it to avoid awkwardness. \n\nDM: oh right, well Iâll go deal with that real quick and come back. \n\nSo we walk back to the registers and there is a now a large line. One of the new hires,bless their poor soul, got a customer who was making a return (which, yes you need special clearance to approve). Customers are furious. One comes up to me and asks to speak to a manager and I kindly direct her to my DM. Iâm trying to suppress a smile as sheâs getting chewed out by this lady for âinsufficiencyâ &amp; âlong wait timesâ &amp; that sheâll be hearing about this on Yelp which DMâs hate because then Regional Managers can hear about it too. \n\nAfter the rush, I clock out and go to buy some stuff I had on hold. Which I deliberately waited to do till my DM had already left the registers, just so they could call her back over the walkie to approve my employee purchase. The look of pure disdain for me when she has to walk back made it totally worth it. \n\nAll of this could have been avoided if she didnât demote me because she felt ârushedâ during our transaction, WHICH IS USUALLY WHAT CUSTOMERS WANT.  I quit a couple months later. The whole store got shutdown a year later too because a water pipe busted and half the store was flooded. \n\nSo glad I donât work in retail anymore. Whew. ",

Except this time he put a 5 foot concrete wall underneath it.\n\nThe neighbour reported him again, but the HOA couldn't do anything about it. Since the law specifically states that fences couldn't be taller than 5 feet, it wasn't technically illegal to have the cement wall under it. \n\nApparently the neighbour moved out a few months later\n\nEDIT: apparently my teacher stole this from facebook. still relevant tho",

        "text": "Obligatory, this wasn't me and it happened several years ago, but one of my professors tells this story in class every year. \n\nSo the typical workflow for commercial theater is that a designer will design the set, and send it off to a shop that builds and paints everything. So if there is going to be a painting, the designer will make a small version and the shop has to make a big replica. Well the show in question required an enormous drop (think really big painting that hangs at the back of the stage). Well it was clear with this one that before sending it the designer had left a mug of some sort on their drawing and so their was a huge circular stain on it. The head painter figured it was probably not supposed to be there, but you can't really be sure in theater  so he called the designer to check. Conversation goes:\n\nPainter: Hey I had a question about the drop\nDesigner: Just make it exactly as is\nPainter: But...\nDesigner: AS IS\nPainter: all right\n\nSo the painter tells his crew to include the stain in the drop. When the designer comes by to check over everything he sees the stain (now enormous on the big version) and freaks out, but because it was on the original drawing the show ended up paying the paint shop several thousand dollars to fix it. (labor costs and what have you, space in a theater shop does not come cheap). \n\nTLDR: Designer includes unwanted aspects in design by mistake, tells shop to make it as is. They do. ",

        "text": "When I was inâ¦either 9th or 10th grade, I donât remember anymore, I had a class with a teacher who would become my favorite teacher of that year.  He was a second year teacher here, but had taught for three years at another local high school, one notorious for problematic students.\n\nEnter my class, which included a girl, weâll call her Psychobitch because that is what she was.  She emotionally tortured me from age eight to age sixteen.  She was also the only person I ever got into a fistfight with.\n\nShe also enjoyed screwing with young teachers and walking all over them.  Seriously, she sat in our 7th grade math teacherâs desk for an entire semester.  So when Mr. Awesome said this was only his second year here, she got that bitchy, game on look.\n\nShe proceeded to spend the next three days interrupting him, talking loudly to her friends and popping her gum when he actually told her to stop.  Lots of BEC stuff, but nothing too bad.\n\nOne day he told her to be quiet and she said, âLike youâre actually gonna make me.â\n\nHe said, âIâm not going to ask you again.  Be quiet or I will have you removed from this class.â\n\nShe actually stood up, bouncing on the balls of her feet, clunky jewelry and decorative keychains on her hoodie clacking together (I canât believe that used to be stylish).  âYou gonna make me leave, huh huh huh?â\n\nMr. A. sighed and left the room.\n\nâYeah, thatâs what I thought!â she yelled through the door, falling back into her desk.\n\nWe past the five minutes whispering or reading, waiting to see what would happen.  Mr. A. came back with a security officer and one of the Deans.  âMiss Psychobitch, Dean and Guard are here to escort you to the office.â\n\nâWhat the hell?â\n\nMr. A. gave her a smirk.  âYou did ask me to make you leave.â\nShe made the nastiest âcut-a-bitchâ face Iâve ever seen, grabbed her stuff, popped her gum as loudly as she could and knocked the supplies tray off the teacherâs desk as she went.\n\nIn addition to a three day in-school suspension (meaning youâre suspended from class but you still have to show up at school and, essentially, sit in detention all day), she was transferred to another class.  It was the first time in six years that I didnât have to suffer a class with her for a whole year, making him my favorite teacher.\n\nEdit: words are hard",

        "text": "I posted about this story about 1-2 months ago, but it got taken done since it wasn't completed yet I guess.\n\n~~Here is the link to the original for people who are curious:~~\n\n~~https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/7wiesk/when_the_directors_son_thinks_hes_punishing_me/~~\n\n~~The story is kinda complicated and too long to summarize, so I think it's best if people go check that one out first.~~\n\n&gt;Long background. My current company is a bit dysfunctional and not very well managed. The biggest issue is that our QA department is combined, managed by single harridan and she has brought her useless son into the company.\n\n&gt;Now I have nothing against family members being hired in if theyâre competent, but he clearly wasnât. They shoved him into managing lab equipment and his job is to basically ensure our basics like gloves hair nets or whatever are stocked. And he gets called on to help move heavy equipment around and do some deliveries.\n\n&gt;Harmless enough, but he fails at even that, he buys things that arenât up to spec and Iâm pretty sure heâs pawning things off on the side. Either way things are always low or missing, so recently he tried to make his job easier by mass ordering âone size fits allâ stuff and talking about how we donât need varieties of glove materials and sizes since it makes his job harder.\n\n&gt;Like fucker really? Is it that hard to maintain a constant stock of XS, S, M, L, XL gloves of different materials? With powder and no power, and clean room grade and not, and whatever? He has literally one job and all he does is sit around complaining about how dumb the company is and vapes for like 5 hours a day outside\n\n&gt;Anyways I managed to piss him off for calling him out on being lazy, so he went crying to mommy dearest about what a bully I was. She rallied up her entire department and they've been on a crusade to make my life hell.\n\n&gt;Now they're in the process of rewriting the procedures for how I test this one product by making it over the top stringent. As in to test a basic circuit board, I need to completely suit up into a full body coverage clean room suit and work in a clean room, where before I only needed a single ESD wrist strap in a controlled area. Everything must be packaged in a specific way. Oh, and they're changing the enforcement procedures so you can get terminated after multiple violations. This is all for a single assembled piece that was considered bomb proof before. Suddenly it needs to be treated like the most sensitive of semiconductors or something.\n\n&gt;I can read the writing on the walls, they're making it so my job is so fucking regulated that it'll be impossible for me to follow everything, and they'll be watching like hawks for every violation so they can get rid of me.\n\n&gt;Now the thing is, the specific board in particularâ¦is something QA is supposed to be testing. A long time ago that part required some special training to know how to use, so we figured itâd be easier for Engineers to handle it. However over the last few years, weâve developed a way to test it so any brain dead idiot can. The fact that Engineering department is still doing it is a bit of a holdover, and Iâve discussed with my boss about transitioning the testing of the board back to QA, and he agreed. Obviously they donât know it yet, but theyâll get the bomb dropped on them within the next 2 or so weeks.\n\n&gt;In the meanwhile, Iâve been egging them on. Telling them to raise the standards even more. I smile and agree with every suggestion they have to improve our testing standards. Little do they know in 2 weeks, instead of me being stuck in a stuffy, sweaty, uncomfortable clean room in a full body suitâ¦itâs going to be them.\n\n&gt;Iâm sure theyâre all crackling in their office about how theyâre going to make my life hell and catch me in a million and one violations. Jokes on them though. I guess if Iâm especially vindictive, Iâll be the one watching them like a hawk and catching them in violations.\n\n&gt;There's a pretty high chance that the son is going to be the one testing them since everyone knows he has nothing else to do, but if mommy interferes and dumps the job on another QA guy, it doesn't matter. Either way the job's getting returned to the QA department, so whoever is caught violating the new procedures will still reflect badly on the mother as a whole.\n\n&gt;Edit: Holy shit this blew up. Yeah I'll keep you guys updated, probably will make a new post in a few weeks.\n\n\nAnyways it took a LOT longer than I expected for the new changes to go through. Basically everyone had approved it EXCEPT the mother, and I was sitting on eggshells for a month wondering what was up with it, and sending her [request approvals once a day](https://imgur.com/a/SyzeD).\n\nWell she FINALLY approved it.\n\nBut when everyone approves it, I still have to be the one to promote the request, and then it can take a while to get officially released.\n\nNow a few weeks before, I'd gone to my manager complaining of hand pain. I mentioned it might be RSI from testing all those circuit boards, but I was going to see a doctor. Then I actually went to the doctor and they confirmed that my joints did seem to be slightly inflamed and I mentioned it might be from work. (Of course it's most likely from all the gaming I do, but no one needs to know that. But I guess it's a good wake up call to lay off on the gaming too.)\n\nSo she gave me a note and officially I am to \"avoid the repetitive motion involved with circuit board testing as this is exacerbating the arthralgia, wear and tear, and parestehsia in the left hand.\"\n\nSo right after the mother approved it, I took my note to my boss and made my regrets on how I can longer test those boards. And reminded him of the discussion we had about transitioning the testing of the boards back to QA since this is a good time. So said he was going to have a part-timer QA guy do it, and that should be that.\n\nSo I go back to by desk and happily hit the last button and promoted the change request. Now officially people testing that board must with in the clean room, must be completely gowned up in a full protective suit, covered hair, face mask, and goggles.\n\nThe part time QA guy...is nowhere near as thorough as I was. The reports he made weren't as good, and he wasn't outputting the quantity I was. Which is fine, he's new to it, and it probably doesn't help that he has to be suited  up in an uncomfortable outfit in an uncomfortable room. But word got around that those boards were taking longer and there were errors in the test report, and the son stopped by to gloat at me, as though I was the one still testing it.\n\nI guess word hadn't gotten out on the transition, and the son was too stupid to realize a different person was testing it...not me.\n\nI listened to his complaints, and nodded and acted like I was the one still doing the testing. Apologized and said I'd me on the look out those mistakes (for the guy replacing me).\n\nA week or two go by, and people finally start to notice it's a different person doing the testing. The son stops by to gloat again, and asks what's going on. If I was getting fired for messing up so much.\n\nI smile and tell him the part has been transitioned back to QA since it shouldn't be tested by engineers in the first place. He looks blank, then confused. Like he can't comprehend that it should be the quality guys doing the testing in the first place.\n\nHe leaves, and gets his mom. His mom comes up to MY boss and asks what's going on, and she didn't agree to this. My boss finally grows a pair for once and says it's not the engineers job to do quality inspection for parts, that we'd only done it for so long because it was originally too complicated, and now it's reverting back to the way it should be.\n\nThe mom looks blank and confused, and she backs off saying she needs to doublecheck this.\n\nA few days go by, and the part time tester is *still* too slow. People came to complain to me about it, and I redirect them to the Quality department since that's whose in charge of it. They start getting complaints from inventory guys who can't meet job orders, and sales people who aren't getting as many products as before the sell. Upper management starts frowning about how our inspectors can't keep up with a critical part and it looks bad for the mom. The mom comes back to my boss to complain saying it wasn't fair to dump a full time job on a part time employee, and that I should still be helping.\n\nI point out that I have a doctor's note preventing me from doing that task, and it's already been filed with HR. Plus I now have new duties and responsibilities.\n\nAnyways I wish I could've forced the son to be the tester, but I'm guessing he whined too much about it. His mom ended up pulling another random quality guy to help do the testing and that's was it. I walk by the clean room and chuckle at seeing them suiting up in completely unnecessary protective gear each time.",

        "text": "The simplified background important to this story: I work in purchasing for a major production facility, specifically in the construction project department. We have several projects we manage with teams dedicated to a single project, and people like me who work on all projects. My company is also undergoing a massive computer system upgrade which requires system blackouts of certain functions for two weeks. One such system is the one used to approve purchase requests which I then pull to make purchase orders. Our corporate office has guidelines to create purchase requests during the blackout, but it is limited only to purchases that would shut down the facility if the part is NOT purchased. Basically, nothing I would ever order in new construction. Due to this, I was able to weaponize malicious compliance twice.\n\nThe story: We recently had training on the new systems which provided valuable information that our project teams would need to know. We've all known about the blackouts, but didn't have specific dates. During training we learned the blackout was effective the next day. My team is usually quite behind on emails, so I figured I would bring it up during a project specific meeting right after my training. Most of the managers would be there, and they could notify their teams for the other projects to get in any orders to me immediately, otherwise it has to wait 2 weeks. Manager \"John\" had other ideas.\n\nJohn is a middle-aged man with a dicky-do (\"My gut sticks out farther than my dicky-do!). He has a permanent stick up his ass about my department, which is surprising since he needs us to buy the materials for his team to build. There is a reason my job is full-time: I buy a lot of stuff and have little downtime (other than right now because, duh, blackout). If he could fire me, he would, but he has zero power in my department. So he asserts his dominance in any way possible. One of his favorites is during *his* project specific meetings. This started by purchasing not being invited to such meetings. I showed up anyway and had to constantly remind him that engineered or specialized equipment takes a while longer than a week to arrive from across the country. Who knew that it takes time to build complex structures? John relented and started inviting me, so his tactic changed to trying to cut my portion off when he heard something he didn't like.\n\nAnyway, when it gets to my part of the meeting, I begin to explain some of the new information when I notice a smirk appearing on John's face.\n\n&gt;John: Is this information specific to this project?\n\n&gt;Me: No, but it will impa--\n\n&gt;John: Then it's general information and belongs in our Monday meeting. You'll have better information then for the right audience.\n\n&gt;Me: Hopefully this project doesn't come to me tomorrow wanting to buy something.\n\n&gt;John: It is what it is.\n\nI hate that phrase. But, sure, John. I won't say a peep to you until Monday (MC #1). A few people in the room wanted to know what I had to say, so we were quitely discussing it when John interrupts us saying we are taking away from the next department's section. I grabbed my things and left. Back in my office, I pumped out every order I had before the blackout and clocked out at my normal time. \n\nThe following morning within minutes of getting in one of John's team members (Eddie, good dude, hard worker) enters my office and hands me some drawings. He has a few items highlighted that he can't locate and is wondering if they were even ordered. He further explains that John was supposed to talk to me about it, but since he hadn't, Eddie was taking the lead. I tell Eddie I'll do some digging and get back to him ASAP.\n\n&gt;Me: By the way, in the event these were not ordered, how soon do you need them before it impacts construction?\n\n&gt;Eddie: Within a week.\n\nI held back my laughter and began searching. Within 15 minutes I had confirmed that not only had they never been ordered, it was never listed anywhere as something I needed to purchase. I'll take the blame if I missed something, but this was something John should have caught months before. I was probably skipping as I went to Eddie's office to deliver the ~~good~~ bad news: We're SOL. Eddie shrugged because he knows it isn't either of our fault and walked off to inform John.\n\n*Technically,* I could have made a purchase order without a purchase request. It is an incredibly cumbersome process which only a few people know to prevent people like John circumventing the system. Company policy dictates that the ONLY time this is allowed if the cost of the delay outweighs the cost of the part(s). This usually only happens if the approver is unavailable for extended periods of time and the part(s) are less than $1,000.\n\nIn this case, the parts alone exceed the cost of the delay. However, I have an agreement with this vendor to discount invoices if paid within an allotted time. The discount would ultimately bring the cost below the delay cost, justifying me to place the order. So, MC #2 was following corporate policy to the letter. If someone audited me, they'd see the PO value and not the paid amount. It could be easily explained, but I figured the questions weren't worth bailing John out. \n\nJohn asked our general contractor to buy the parts instead, which results in a snowball effect costing the project nearly 10x what it would be if I bought it. First, not only does the contractor not get a discount, they'll mark it up 15%. Second, the only supplier they can purchase these items from will take an extra week. My supplier would have been slightly delayed, but easily managed on site. Contractor's supplier will cause a delay holding up construction meaning John will have to ask the contractor to expedite their schedule which is never cheap. And finally, the contractor and John will now have about 3 hours worth of paperwork to perform the purchase order change process John instituted. Once complete, it will come to me to update the PO. It'll take me about 5 minutes after the blackout is over. All on a budget he is accountable for.",

        "text": "Derrick (Newly hired VP of sales) was to take over the vacant position that our previous VP got head-hunted out of. The new guy came with outstanding marks.  He was head of sales for our competitor 10 years early, started his own smaller rival company and had just sold it for a substantial sum. The guy was the Goose that laid the golden egg in the eyes of management.  As bad luck would have it, he got assigned a desk right next to mine while his cushy corner office was being built to his specifications.   \n\nDerrick (Further known as Entitled Prick. AKA EP) and I have little in common in terms of what we both do for the company.  During our first introduction and upon hearing a short summary of what I do, he somehow got in his head that Iâm on the low end of the totem-pole, not the lead company report writer and developer of our invoicing and client notification software. I didnât feel the need to correct him when he made the snide remark as he was leaving, âHey, gotta start at the bottom to work your way up, right?â   \nI didnât like him from that very moment and vowed to make his life a living hell while he was here.  Heâs not my boss, nor do I report to him.  EPâs first request was to ask for a Sales report for all products âORDEREDâ for the previous year to present day. I knew he meant âCOMPLETEDâ but hey, he said âORDEREDâ in his request.  No problemâ¦ I provided him with a detailed report of every order our numerous clients have **placed** within the past year.  EP leans over to my desk telling me â*The report you gave me is wrong.  The numbers didnât add up to our posted stats on the internal company website*â.  I confirmed that the request was for âORDERS PLACEDâ and the information is 100% accurate and presenting correctly.   â*You asked for a report on orders PLACED within a month. Many of those orders get completed in different months.  Did you want a report on orders completed?*â.  EP just looked at me like he was going to throw down right then and there.  This was our new VP of Sales all. It only went downhill from there.  \n\nEP was convinced that I was an idiot and had it out for me from that moment on. Every report that got sent to him, he would scrutinize my formulas and numbers with a fine-tooth comb.  â*Draidr, these numbers are wrong! The total average per day isnât accurate. Do this report right.*â  â*Your request was for [Client averages]. The client profile is for BUSINESS DAYS not Calendar days worked. There were 21 business days last month. Did you want a [Company] report for total averages? Because you asked for [Client Averages]*.â  EP was seething as every report he requested took 3X as long to get and requiring multiple revisions because of his wording.   \n\nI found ways to twist his words at any opportunity. â*Can you give me the Raw Data on all orders completed in February for Client XYZ*â â*Sure, what year would you like that pulled?*â â*2017*â â*Ok, what fields would you like to see*â â*the standard ones*â â*which standard? Can you give me a current report that mimics what youâre asking for?*â. â*Just give me the standard data. Whatever report I received in my email each day. I need to call this client now before the rep leaves for the day*â â*Not a problem, which of the 17 reports you receive each day did you want me to mimic the fields for*â.  \nMind, you, heâs seated 4 feet from me on my right.  He canât talk to me about this as he must reply to all requests via email so that thereâs a ârecordâ of the transaction request. After nearly 2 hours of back of forth, I would then say, â*Ohh that report, yeah you can just go to the Report server and pull this data yourself here. *[Screenshot] *These instructions on how to pull it yourself.*â This would have taken him 2-3 minutes tops even for a first-time user. Itâs Ikea style simple instructions so literally anyone can do it.  He never replied but I could hear him muttering profanities under his breath.  \nNobody in the company liked him. His label of Entitled Prick was living up to his namesake as company gossip about him was spreading like wildfire. \nTo top the list of things this idiot was doing around the office, it shows a whole new level of incompetence. â*Whatâs the company policy on removing the k-cups after making a cup of coffee?*â Mutha fucka, throw it away, if you see the previous cup in there, throw that away. Itâs not rocket science.  â*Do I have to dial 9 to get an outside line?*â For the 20th time, No just dial!  â*Why does the color printer only print black and white?*â because, for the 10th time, thatâs a black and white printer. You have to switch printers to print Color. No, we canât make the color printer default for you. No, you canât print your emails in color. No, it will not help you do your job better.   \n\nâ*I need a better chair, can you order me the $4400 executive chair from SuperExpensiveFurnitureCorp*â Umm, No, youâll get the standard $700 executive chair that even our CEO uses that weâve ordered for all our executives. They will arrive in your office at the end of next month when itâs finished.  â*But I need this chair for my back.*â  Mutha fucka, you have a framed photo on your desk of you driving a car in a demolition derby taken last year!  He bragged about it during his welcome speech he gave to the monthly company meeting.    \n\nEP eventually got let go a mere 5 weeks after being hired.

The unofficial reason was that he told off the CEO in a meeting about how incompetent his staff was. â*Surprised you were able keep your company afloatâ was the words he was quoted saying to the owner.

        "text": "Sorry for the formatting, I am on mobile.\n\nSo this happened this past weekend and I am just now reaping the rewards of my compliance.\n\nA little backstory, I just graduated from college this past May of 2017 and my parents let me move back in with them until I got a job and could afford to move out on my own. Growing up I was always the âgoodâ child out of my siblings and was always regularly compliant with everything they asked. I just wanted to keep my parents happy and didnât like making a fuss. I continued helping out when I moved back in (like doing chores without being asked, taking my sister to appointments, etc.) just to help out my parents for letting me live there. Now the thing about my dad is he is a major control freak. After I moved back in he started giving me rules to follow and if I didnât comply I would be kicked out. These rules kinda sucked, the worst being he gave me a curfew, and I know he was doing it to motivate me to get a job and move out so I wouldnât live in his basement for forever. I just dealt with them and figured he would cut it out when I got a job.\n\nFast forward to the beginning of this year, I got a full time job in my field and informed my parents of my plans to move out this summer when I had some money saved up. I figured this would be the end of my rules I had to follow. WRONG. \n\nFast forward again to three weeks ago. I had just gotten home from a long day at work and find a big piece of poster board on our kitchen table with âbucknation_âs list of chores written on it in big letters with 6 chores written underneath it. Now most of these chores where things I already did without being asked like yardwork and keeping my room clean. The only one I didnât do was that every other week my mom was supposed to give me a grocery list and I would buy all of the groceries on it. I realize I am making money now and have no problem helping out with groceries if they had just asked me to. Thatâs not the problem here. The problem is that he put it on a huge poster like Iâm 5 years old. I stewed in anger for a while but ultimately forgot about the list.\n\nThis is where the malicious compliance starts. This past Saturday as my family and I are all watching tv together, my dad brings up the groceries and asked my mom to make a list. She hands it to me and my jaw dropped when I saw how long it was. It was so long mainly due to my mom not having bought groceries in a while so the fridge was empty. I then noticed how vague my mom had been with the list assuming that I knew what brands of each item my family liked and that I would automatically know to pick out what we liked to eat. This is where I started forming my plan. I told my parents I would be back in a couple hours and I left.\n\nLike I said earlier, I very well knew what brands and types of food my parents liked but I also knew which brands they hated. I bought all of those wrong brands. For example one item on the list was âburgersâ. I knew they meant hamburgers but I got turkey burgers instead. Also things like getting skim milk instead of the normal whole milk we drink, fat free items instead of the regular versions, you get the point. I did this for every item on the list even going so far as grocery store âAâ being out of the wrong brand so going to store âBâ across the street to buy it. \n\nWhen I got back home and started putting everything away, my dad came to make sure I got everything and was speechless when he saw what I had bought. Noticing the look of disbelief on his face I said, âwhat? I got every single thing on the list.â He then asked for the list and when I gave it to him, he said I knew what food my mom meant and called me an asshole. I grinned and walked away. Iâve overheard him complaining to my mom about it multiple times this week and the satisfaction I get each time is fantastic. \n\nThe other thing is since the fridge and pantry were empty. I bought way more of each item then they expected me to and filled both the fridge and pantry to the brims. My dad being the anti wasteful guy that he is, he will be eating this stuff for weeks.\n\nTL,DR; my dad treated his adult son like a child and now he will be eating foods he hates for every meal.  \n\nEDIT: fixed a typo",

At the time we had more than a few ill patients so the nursing dept. was quite busy. On this occasion I came in at 8:30. Immediately one of the part-time PSWs accosted me and âorderedâ me to take phones immediately. I looked at her and reminded her my shift didnât begin for another 30 but that I would of course take the phones, just like I always did when I came in early.\nWithin 15 the GM called me into her office to ream me out. Apparently the PSW took exception to what Iâd said. Note: I was a manager at the time, she was a part-timer. I was told that it was my duty to take over the phone as soon as I came in. Pissed as I was, I simply smiled and said sure thing. The next day I sat in my car until 2 minutes to 9. When I came in the GM was at the front desk being over-whelmed by calls. I did the same for the next 2 days before I returned to my early arrivals. She never said a word about my malicious compliance. \n\n\nedit: responding to comments. No longer work there. Was a salaried employee and supposed to have time in lieu of which was never honored. GM was the worst manager I've ever had so I left. Because I had them over the proverbial barrel (over some contract failures on their side) I got 16 weeks severance (I worked there less than 2 yrs). Best thing I ever did was leave \n",

I would also introduce myself \"Hi, I'm plipinfit. Whats your name please?\" ( it was pretty important for me to make sure I picked up the right person, so I'd always ask their name.)

I would answer the phones and see if I could help the person real quick (usually questions about a due date, our hours, etc.) before sending them back to the account reps.  Well, at least until Tracy spoke up during a company meeting.  Tracy brought up that I wasn't trained as a account rep and shouldn't be answering customer questions since I was just the 'tech guy'.\n\n\nSince you are here, I am sure you can imagine what happened next.\n\n\nImmediately after that meeting, every call that came in where a customer had a question, went to Tracy first.  I imagine I doubled or tripled the number of calls that went back to her on a daily basis.

(for those who don't know, powersports has to do with jet skis, sea-doos, boats, atvs, 4x4s etc.)  \n\nThe shop was in a really crappy spot, right next to the highway, over summer it was about 100+ degrees F everyday. Besides that we were a pretty good shop (for the most part) so we were always PACKED over the summer with people's \"toys.\" \n\nThere were two main mechanics here, one who was a super hard worker, would work outside on boats over the summer, would drop something if we really needed help. The other one, we'll call Travis, was a basically a drama queen, refused to work outside because it was \"too hot\" (in reality it was but everyone else at the shop didn't so why couldn't he), because of this we would have to drag everything inside the shop for him to work on. Jet ski needs spark plugs changed? Drag it inside and 2 min later take it back out. Don't know what the problem is yet? Drag it inside for 5 minutes and take it back out. \n\nNaturally we were inclined to help the mechanic that is willing to help us.  I had worked there for a while so we knew what needed to be done first and what didn't need to be done immediately. \n\nOne day apparently Travis was not happy we were lagging on bringing him the jet skis he needed because it was a pretty busy day. He told the owner of the shop that we were just slacking off and ignoring him. Later that day the owner called me and the other guy who worked outside in and told us that we needed to step it up and doing what Travis needed immediately instead of waiting a bit to do it. I tried to tell him that we were only waiting because we had things that needed to be done at that moment. The owner didn't want to hear it and told us, \"Drop whatever you're doing and do whatever he tells you.\"\n\nThe next day we were definitely pissed that Travis would tell the owner we were just slacking off and ignoring him, without listening to what we had to say. So we decided to maliciously comply  and that's when things stopped getting done. Have a jet ski half loaded onto a trailer but Travis needs something? Bring Travis a jet ski and then get back to loading the trailer. Halfway through washing a boat but Travis needs a ski? Get Travis his ski and start washing the boat all over again.  Basically the shop grinded to a halt that day and the boss was pissed and couldn't understand why things weren't getting done. We explained that since Travis needed everything right this second nothing else could get finished since he wouldn't go outside or help us at all. \n\nNeedless to say he told us to go back to what we were doing before and Travis had to help get his own skis and work outside. \n\nTLDR: Drama queen mechanic tells owner that we weren't listening to him, owner tells us to do what mechanic wants immediately, we comply and the shop comes to a grinding halt.

        "text": "I work at an office that opens at 8:30am but because of the transit schedule I usually get there at 8:00am and if I missed that bus I would be late by 5-10mins.\n\nNormally, I've been answering the phones as soon as I got there, calling back the messages that were left on the machines and just starting work half an hour before we technically open. I find it easier, as I hate the rush of people coming in that happen right at 8:30am and having to answer the calls, calling people back from missed messages and having to do all the other opening duties all at the same time. It just makes us look like we are running around like chickens with our heads cut off and being disorganized. Note: when I start early I also clock out early so that my employer doesn't have to pay me overtime.\n\nSo recently, my employer gave me the talk about how I've been starting early and tells me that I should only start when we open at 8:30am and that if I want to do the other opening duties earlier or answering calls that I should do it \"out of the goodness of my heart\"... basically no pay for working.\n\nWhen I start earlier I am making it easier for my employer to start their work as everything has been set up and ready for them.\n\nSo after that talk, I still get there early as usual but just sit in the break room playing on my phone or eating breakfast. Employer usually gets there 8:20am and when the phones ring, they ask me why aren't I working?? I just tell them I'm not starting until 8:30am. So now everyday they get stuck with the flood of calls, getting backed up with all the messages and are slow to start their work each day while I do the rest of the opening duties.\n\nI guess I just don't have any good in me Â¯\\\\_(ã)_/Â¯",

While my dad was working he got in touch with the IT which was doing maintenance on equipment. My dad asked the IT to change the WiFi password since other employees discovered the WiFi password and they slowed the internet down. When the technician asked my dad what the new password should be he said \"I don't know\" so the technician changed it to what my dad said \"idontknow\" my dad got the joke and stuck with it as the new password so he could use it to his advantage. So the next time other employees asked for the new WiFi password my dad would just say \"I don't know\" and he would be technically correct. It took the employees about a week to figure out that the password was literally \"idontknow\".",

        "text": "Okay Redditors, this takes place in  small town America where both Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and firefighters are volunteers.  \n\nStuff You Should Know:\nAll small EMS (emergency medical service) departments have \"frequent flyers\", those people, often on their last legs, who need frequent trips to the ER (emergency room), usually for legitimate reasons.  Our small town is 20 minutes to the nearest hospital. Fire departments are often called upon to assist in calls when :\n1) there might be CPR required\n2) the patient is larger than two or three EMS volunteers can handle\n3) the patient is in a difficult to extract area (patients often collapse in little bathrooms or in bedrooms up steep stairwells)\n\nOur patient was a frequent flyer, a hypochondriac, who was both very large and in a hard to access narrow hallway to her bedroom so fire had to come whenever EMS was paged.  When the fire department is called we don't just page 3-4 people but all 30+ volunteers are expected to drop everything or wake up in the middle of the night , hurry to the station and help.  \n\nLarge Patient (Larpa) had called emergency services several times a year for several years.  When we arrived there was never any sign of actual distress other than she couldn't get out of bed.  Her husband would be in the living room ignoring this as he'd seen it so many times.  She would enjoy all the attention, we'd put her on a cot and manage to wriggle it out of the house into the ambulance.  \n\nOn Revenge Night we were called to the much dreaded address.  Among her other vague complaints were back pain.  Alert! If you have back pain we can't sit you up on the cot and extricate you out of the house as usual!  No, EMS and Fire came up with a little more involved solution.  She was backboarded (immobilized with straps to a hard-as-rock backboard to prevent any further injury) and , over the course of the next hour, her large bedroom window was removed and she was brought out slowly and carefully and protestingly through the window opening.   This was the last we heard from this particular patient.\n",

        "text": "This is borderline MC, but it doesn't fit anywhere else.\n\nIn fourth grade, we all got brought to one of the library classroom, along with another class, to have a guest lecture about child abuse.  Mostly the normal stuff, excluding sexual abuse since we hadn't had sex ed classes yet.  They went through the whole spiel: if you or someone you know is being abused, please report it to the proper authorities.  They meant teachers.  They wanted us to report things to teachers rather than police or...y'know parents.  This is relevant to their mentality toward what happened next.  \n\nAt the end of the lecture, they said that any books spoken about in the lecture were available at the school library.  I politely raised my hand and asked about one book in particular, **A Child called It,** because I would like to check it out when we were done with the lecture.  A librarian stepped in at that point and said I would need written consent from my parent to say I could check it out.  (I work in a library so censorship gets my back up now as much as it did back then.)  Being a good kid, I nodded and let other kids ask questions until we were released.\n\nTeacher gave us ten minutes to browse the library and check out books if we wanted.  I went up to the librarian and asked what exactly the note needed.  She said it had to be in writing, specific to the book I wanted, and needed a parent's signature at the bottom.  I remember thinking about how I was glad that my mother, having been divorced from my father for the last year, hadn't changed her name yet because the admins were notorious for being sticklers about parents' surnames.  (Changes had to be made in writing or at the beginning of the school year and my mom found this crap annoying.)  I checked out a different book and left with my class.\n\nThis was a Thursday.  I went home and asked for the permission slip.  Mom wrote it out without batting an eyelash and I took it and folded it into a book.  I forgot the book the next day and, being Friday, I didn't wanna wait until Monday so, instead of lying to the teachers or telling them I forgot it, I went to the public library after school and checked it out.  The note was forgotten.\n\nMonday, I brought the book with me to school to read and an admin saw me.  She asked if I had permission to check it out and I said that I'd gotten it from the public library.  This is supposed to be the part where they grit their teeth and let it go.  I hadn't broken their rule.  They said I needed permission to check it out from the school library, not that I couldn't check it out somewhere else.\n\nBut no.  Stupid grownups.\n\nShe yanked the book out of my hands and dragged me to the office by my wrist.  She threw the book (Actually threw a library book!!!!!) behind the secretary counter and told me to sit in a chair.  I sat and glared while she called my mother and said she needed to come and collect the library book as it contained inappropriate material.  She must have gotten some blowback, not very surprising considering my mom was doing daycare out of her house at the time, making going anywhere a pain, so she said I would not be able to leave the office until the matter was resolved.\n\nTwenty-five minutes later, about the time I was going to try crying to see if that would get me out of the office, Mom (M) stalks into the office with a squalling two year old in one arm and clutching the hand of a very confused four year old.  \"What is the problem?\" she snapped, looking from the receptionist already calling the admin and to me, where I working up a set of fake tears.\n\nThe admin (A) came out and said, \"Your daughter was caught with illicit materials.\"\n\nM: A book is illicit materials now?\n\nA: She needs permission to have it.\n\nM: Why?\n\nA: Because it's illicit.\n\nM: It's a book.  It's not porn.\n\nA: Ma'am, I must ask--\n\nM: Exactly.  If it's not got naked people in it, she's hardly going to be showing it off.\n\nMe: MOM?\n\nM: Besides, no one at the public library stopped her.\n\nA: Be that as it may, this book is not available for checkout here without permission.  You need to remove it from the premises.\n\nM (to me): Is this the book you wanted last week?\n\nMe: Yes.\n\nM: Where's the book?\n\nMe: She grabbed it and threw it behind the counter.\n\nMom knows how I feel about books and she rounds on the admin, who is a bit red-faced.\n\nM (in the scary cold voice that moms get right before losing their shit completely): You took and threw my daughter's book?\n\nI braced for an explosion, but instead, she handed me the two-year-old and turned to the secretary.  \n\nM: Can I have a piece of paper and the book, please.\n\nThe secretary handed her both and she wrote, in all caps and taking up half the page:\n\nLURKING CAN HAVE, CHECK OUT AND READ ANY BOOK SHE WANTS TO IN THIS SCHOOL AND ANYONE WHO TRIES TO STOP HER OR TAKES AWAY ANY BOOK NOT PROPERTY OF THIS SCHOOL WILL BE BROUGHT UP ON CHARGES OF THEFT.\n\nShe signed it in big, flowing letters, shoved it into the admin's hand and handed me the book in exchange for the baby and said, \"Go to class.\"  I scrambled past the admin, who was pissed but, after all, I had permission slip now.\n\nBonus: The admin dinged up one corner, which I explained to the circulation staffer when I returned the book and they promised to call the school and have a word about proper care of other people's property.  I don't know if they did it or not, but I was just happy that they weren't mad at me about the damage.\n\nEdit: forgot a quotation.\n\nEdit Edit: HOLY SWIZZLESTICKS GOLD??? Thank you kind stranger! Seriously, wow.\n",

        "text": "Hello MaliciousCompliance,\n\nAfter having stumbled upon this subreddit I've decided to post all of the malicious compliance I've been forced to go through in the past two years that I've been working at a new unnamed startup, which is a whole lot. The inability of our higher-ups to organize between themselves effectively has led to years of malicious compliance and a Cover-My-Ass mentality, which leads to many rich stories that I hope to share here, episode-by-episode. I should add here that I'm an american expat working in a local company somewhere in North Africa. I'll try to keep it chronological and every episode should happen later in the years. Happy reading!\n\n-------------------------------\n\nIt was in the earliest days of the startup, when the whole thing was still just a bunch of ideas jotted down on cafÃ© napkins in the upscale district of the capital city between suited men, our future CEO, investors, my manager... It was summer at the time, and the whelming air would come down over the sea and descend through the open windows of my apartment, the rays of the north african sun piercing through the mosquito netting.\n\nI worked from home those days, from that small, noisy apartment overlooking the busy streets below where merchants would sell their goods, fruits and vegetables and grilled meats, the smell of which would waft up and mix with the petrol from the dozens of scooters passing by.\n\nOur office location was not \"technically\" ready yet, as we didn't have any furniture which had been delivered. We had our office room, working electricity and no wifi, so no one ever bothered to come in. After a couple of weeks, we decided to meet up there at least once a day, usually in the afternoon, to discuss our progress on the various tasks we had been undertaking. We would work from home the rest of the time, with our computers and phones.\n\nThis was also the commercial prospection phase of the startup launch, where we were constantly contacting our future clients and handling their returns. Since these clients work in the gulf, we would always handle these things in the earlier hours of the morning, fielding phone calls and e-mails from about 8AM to 9AM before things calmed down and we could continue with our regular tasks.\n\nThis arrangement continued for a while, before one day my manager waited for the CEO to depart before sitting down with me after having received the delivery of our new desks and office equipment. She told me that from now on, we were required to show up to work at 9AM. I tried voicing my complaints to her, firstly that we worked irregular hours in this phase of the commercial launch: we would sometimes work all night on a proposal for a client, spend all  morning on the phone with them, and then have the afternoon for individual tasks or rest time. Furthermore, the facilities that we had at the time had no wifi and were quite far away from where I lived at the time. Since we  had been working from home with the occasional meeting without issue, we were pretty sure that this would hurt our effectiveness. She was adamant, however, and so I accepted. Monday morning, I would be at the office at 9 AM.\n\nAs she was leaving, I turned to her and said \"Boss, you do know that I don't have a car or a moped\".\n\n\"Take public transportation\" she waved me off while she walked out the door.\n\nI have to take a minute here to explain that in the city we were in, public transportation was not what you might imagine in North America. There are some overcrowded, indian-style busses that often break down and sporadically serve different routes at a time. Then there are smugglers that fit 8 people in an old Lada, including in the trunk, and drive around the the city on  a pre-determined route. My current route would force me to take a smuggler, and then a bus, meaning that I would never be able to work or even answer my phone while on public transportation (if your phone goes off in the crowded bus, or in the smuggler's lada, people will know you have a smart phone and they may mug you on the spot).\n\nOn Monday morning, I woke up at my regular hour, got ready, stuffed my PC in its bag and began my journey to the offices. I shut off my phone, and waited in line for the smugglers. After a while, a smuggler's car pulled up and the crowd of people mobbed it, grabbing the doors and trying to get inside. It took about three or four cars before I was able to force myself in, handing a coin to the driver. A journey down the oceanside boulevard wedged between the floor and the seat later, and we had arrived at the downtown hub. A bus was then boarded that took its sweet time to mosey on, slowly, towards the offices, as people sat in the windows to escape the stifling air inside.\n\nA long while later, I finally walked up the stairs of our office building and entered our new office just as I opened my phone to see a plethora of missed calls and text. I was greeted by my boss, who immediately got up and, with a distressed voice, started roughly questioning me about where I had been.\n\n\"What in the holy hell was going on? Where were you? Why didn't you answer the client or your cell phone? Did you see the urgent e-mails? Did you not read the excel file I sent to you this morning?\"\n\n\"I journeying here on the bus, so I could arrive at 9 AM, like you said on Friday\".\n\nShe scowled, walked back to her desk, and while sitting down shook her head, muttering to herself \"problem\", over and over again.\n\nThat day the 9AM rule was rescinded for another month until we completed the prospection phase of our launch. We continued mostly working from home until we started regular, 9-5 business hours and had Wifi and other amenities installed in our office.",

        "text": "I didn't actually do this one, I wasn't creative enough. I did try, though. But one of my good friends in Middle School did, was supremely successful, and it is pretty funny, so here it is.  \n\nTo set the stage, we were in 6th grade English class. Now, in case you forgot, 6th graders have crappy vocabularies. Somebody long ago decided that the best way to get students to learn more words was to assign homework, forcing them to use new vocabulary words in a sentence. And you couldn't write a fake sentence (\"*Notarized* is a cool word.\"), they had to be real, with context clues and all that.  \n\nWe were assigned this assignments nightly. We would be given 10 words, and then write stupid sentences for them. After 2 weeks, we would have a vocabulary test to make sure we actually learned the words, instead of writing them in a sentence and just forgetting about them later. Which we all did, to be honest.  \n\nNow, I really hated doing this homework, as did everyone else. Coming up with 10 novel sentences for words was really annoying, and the vocabulary words could be strange. At one point, our class asked if we could put multiple words into a single sentence. It's only fair, if we could make correct sentences, we should get credit, right? Our teacher didn't want us doing that at all, she wanted us to write those 10 damn sentences.  \n\nAfter weeks (it was probably days, but my memory of that time is a bit spotty), she relented and we could use multiple words per sentence as long as it still made sense. And if the sentences didn't make sense, even if a single word wasn't used properly, we would lose full credit for all words in the sentence.   \n\nSo now all of us would do our best to include as many vocabulary words in a sentence as possible. We would write these run-on sentences that barely made sense, all so we could shave a few minutes off of our homework time. Our teacher hated it, but as long as the sentence made sense, we were alright and wouldn't lose points. To be honest, the fact that our teacher made us do this stupid assignment, coupled with the fact that she hated it, made us try even harder.   \n\nThen one week, we got a list of very... interesting words. Let's just say we were all giggling. I can't remember all of them (there were 10), but here are the ones I do recall:  \n\nconsternation  \nconstipation  \naggravation  \nfrustration  \n\nNow, I'm not that creative. I may have put together a sentence like \"My *constipation* caused me major *aggravation* because I couldn't poop.\" Lame, but it got the job done. But one of my friends, man, he had an imagination. He managed to use all 10 words in a sentence. I can't remember the whole thing, but this is how it ended...   \n\n\"...feelings of major *frustration*, *aggravation*, and *consternation* were sweeping across the nation due to major *constipation*!\"  \n\nWhen I read the sentence, I burst out laughing. It was beautiful, glorious, syntactically correct, semantically correct, it had a rhyme scheme, and it was just plain awesome. Plus I was a 12 year-old boy, my friend wrote a poop joke for homework. Anyway, he handed it in, we were all laughing, and he ends up getting a perfect score. The teacher wasn't pleased at all, but he followed the directions to the letter. It was a glorious day, even as constipation was sweeping across the nation.  \n\nTLDR: friend handed in a poop joke for his vocabulary homework assignment, got a perfect score.",

        "text": "This is my first post in this sub and i am just hoping it fits here: if it doesn't please say so. The first half is just trying to explain what the situation was and please note I was just turning into an Otaku/cosplayer over the course of this time\n\nSo, back in 2013, when I was in year 10, I was at a school that treated me like shit. This was the type of school with very strict rules, you had a strict uniform (think of the typical Christian private school rules), mandatory lessons, mandatory extra curricular lessons (such as choir) and very unusual regular lessons (known as P.A.C.E)\n\n for example: There was a mandatory join in to the school choir for the students in years 7-10 (was a prep to year 10 school), yet somehow I was excluded (every week the others went to the lesson and yet never noticed I was excluded), another example was that when there were sports lessons and there were even people, I somehow got left on my own almost every time. I did run into a teacher a couple years after this and they said I was in the wrong every single time (how, when i followed school rules?)\n\nI have a couple bits of malicious compliance that I can share, with the first being that when I found out that I was excluded from the school Choir (this choir entered a contest), it turned out that the time the others were singing, it was essentially a free period for me. Even though it was a free period, there was still a teacher keeping a close eye  on me. So I decided to watch my current anime during all those free periods, whilst still obeying the school rules (turns out the school hated anime) with the teacher not being able to never do anything about this. They wanted to exlcude me from a mandatory thing, so when they didn't i treated it as a watch whatever you want within reason lesson.\n\nSecond story: I ended up being part of the student council only because noone else wished to be, and I was fine with that! considering how most elections are popularity contests, this worked out well. As the student council does, it ran small fundraisers and events such as raffles and pancake days.\n\nThis is about one of those Pancake Days, the one around early September, where it was also a casual dress day-so long as you stayed within the dress code. I had just been to my first convention a couple weeks prior and got my first proper cosplay (think of an excorsist anime based in the 1850s), and I thought \"this is about a character chosen by God, who kills demons and wears a cross, how could a Christian school oppose this?\" so I snuck it to school on Pancake Day in my bag.\n\nWhen it came to actually getting ready to set up for giving out the pancakes, I got my cosplay on with the wig and it apparently scared a few kids (not caring at this point). I kept it on as it was well within the dress code, with the teachers hating it from what my foster carer later telling me (never got told off by this foster carer for this).\n\nTL:DR-school treats me unfair and exlcudes me from mandatory choir so I sit and watch anime, then a casual dress day comes up so I cosplay, both thing they hate but can't do anything about as I was obeying school rules.",

        "text": "I used to be an internal helpdesk tech for my company. We were consistently understaffed, and all of our users treated us like garbage. Well, after getting tired of getting requests like, \"It's 4:55pm on a Friday, but we need 100 computers moved by 8am Monday,\" (after they knew for weeks the move needed to be done) my boss decided to institute SLAs.\n\nMost of the SLAs were reasonable, like 24h for a single computer move, 72h for a whole department move, etc. The one that wasn't strictly reasonable was 8h for basic requests. Most requests can be handled in about 10 minutes, usually an hour tops if we had a queue of requests.\n\nWell, if someone pissed us off or treated us like garbage, guess who got to wait 8 business hours to get their request handled? I had several issues that required a few mouse clicks to solve that weren't handled until 7 hours 58 minutes. If there was only 1 hour left in the day, tough shit.",
