Season one was a big downer and Michael was more meaner and crass than the later seasons, so I feel like the change in his hair was emblematic of the shift in the show from British Office to US Office, making it their own with their own identity.\n\nWhat are examples you can think of where a change in appearance made at least some sense on screen?",

The cult leader in question, Larry Ray, taped all his \"counseling sessions\" with a bunch of young Sarah Lawrence students. As you listen to those tapes, and watch those same people being interviewed today, you see and understand how someone gets their psychological hooks into people. ITs really crazy and kind of scary how it happens. \n\nThe man is actually clearly brilliant and very, very insightful. He had a knack for zeroing in on people's core issues. Could have done a lot of great things with his life. Instead he decided to leave a trail of utter psychological devastation and ruined lives in his path. \n\nCraziest part of the docu is that one of the people he fucked with the worst and forced to do horrible horrible things STILL to this day defends him! Absolute insanity. \n\nThis doc is wroth viewing IMO, especially if you are interested in mind control and cult programming and deprogramming.",

But I watched the first episode, and it was good!\n\nWell the other day my partner and I sat down to start the Last of Us, but it wasn't up yet, so we decided to put on Velma as a joke while we waited. Fully intending to laugh at how bad it was. We ended up laughing *with* the show instead of at it.\n\nIt's crude and lewd and gross, but it made me laugh. \n\nI saw the screenshots that claimed the joke were basically just \"white man bad\" but they were so out of context. Velma is a bad person in the show. She's wrong about everything. Most of the characters are bad people. That's what the joke is. It's ironic humor.\n\nAnd before you say anything, yeah, I've always been a scooby doo fan. I don't care the scoob isn't in it. I don't care that all the characters are different from how they used to be. Frankly, I prefer it this way rather than the same old shit. Give me a new spin on it. Just like how Mystery Inc was way different from previous incarnations.\n\nTL;DR: Velma made me laugh.",

As a fan of British comedy like Monty Python &amp; Rowan Atkinson, this was a refreshing new batch of that style of humor that I’d like to see more of here in America. I’m also a big history buff, currently working on a degree in it. And while the events “covered” here are very broad and well-known, I think the subject matter played a role in my enjoyment.\n\nThe jokes are really funny, often brilliant in their simplicity. There were a ton of writers on each episode, but it was the same writers for each one, which might be the reason for the consistency across the series.\n\nAnd Diane Morgan is just hilarious as this character. Despite saying patently ridiculous things, she imitates the cadence of actual BBC reporters remarkably well. If someone wasn’t paying attention, I almost think you could trick them into thinking this was a real documentary, at least for a bit. And much like the work of Sacha Baron Cohen, I was amazed how she was able to avoid simultaneously laughing and cringing during the interviews with the experts like I was.\n\nAnd it’s not actually completely devoid of educational value. Through all the absurdity, the experts are occasionally able to sneak a real interesting fact in there. So it’s thoroughly entertaining and also informative once in a while. Thumbs up from me.",

        "text": "Recently watched Chernobyl. A couple of shots will haunt me forever: the guy on the rooftop looking into the radioactive smoke and children playing in the radioactive ashfall without realising its permanent damage. The most effective thing about it was the sense of dread - the monster is invisible and it's a race against time to stop even greater damage. Avoided it for the longest time cuz I knew the series would be heavy. Wasn't expecting the horror elements to hit just as hard. I mean concrete being poured over welded coffins of first responders....just speechless! I hope HBO and Craig Mazin make another miniseries for Fukushima, Bhopal, or even 9/11.",
