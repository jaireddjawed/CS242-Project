I'm not an unsociable person by any means, I'm usually quite outgoing with my classmates and such, but I'm also very introverted. Specifically, about two weeks ago, a new girl came to my class. My close friends and I sort of adopted her into our group, she sits with us during lunchtimes and all, but I can't help but feel like it's going too fast (my social battery has been pretty drained from other friends I've made a little while back that have moved pretty quickly, but they were both very understanding with boundaries and somehow knew to take it slow), especially since my other friend added her into our private group chat. I don't do well with change + I don't really know her well, so this has been very overwhelming. I don't know how to approach my friends to talk about it, if anyone has advice I'd really appreciate it.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/11r5nhm/am_i_the_problem_for_refusing_to_answer_a_yes_or/",
        "text": "\nI was just on the phone with her over the weekend and for like the fourth time going back to New Year's Day (and including the time she asked my dad about the same question) she brought up the topic of my grandmother who was returning to her home country (Taiwan) this month. I had told my mom previously that she was returning in March when my mom asked. Prior to that (January) I told her it was gonna be in spring. She first started asking a yes or no question regarding my grandmother's return when she called my dad over birthday gifts. My dad lied and said yes (probably because he didn't feel like it was my mom's business).\n\nLast Saturday she asked me the same question that she had asked my dad. Knowing this I refused to answer her questions and instead sarcastically suggested to her to reach out to my grandma directly. But here's the catch. My parents are divorced for 20 years. My mom and grandmother have been estranged and neither have they seen nor talked to each other for 15 years. Deep down I just didn't want to answer for another family member or for anybody else regardless of the matter, not to mention she had asked a similar question couple of times already, yet I never conveyed that point across. Instead I began to tell her that I had informed her of this matter and implied that no further discussion was needed. She shot back that there are 31 days in March, and then I asked her is that important to her? My mom accused me and my family of being secretive, mysterious, and defensive for refusing to answer a random yes or no question...traits I later found out can be associated with narcissism. She even questioned if this was our \"family culture.\" She stated her intention was not to probe but only to ask a simple question. But she had asked a similar question for four times! I asked her why she asked my dad and then me the same question. She answered that it was one thing to ask him and another thing to ask me. I was frustrated at this point, and I retorted that I was never a part of my family's plans. Too late. My mom felt hurt and upset from my sarcastic remark and then ended the conversation abruptly. \n\n40 minutes later I texted her that I used a poor choice of words that rubbed her the wrong way and used poor communication skills to get the point across that I simply wanted to close chapters in my grandmother. During my mom's marriage, she lived with my grandparents and resented my grandma. I then told her I didn't want to talk about my grandma anymore and wanted to move on from this topic instead. I understood my remark was inappropriate and why she was upset, and I concluded by hoping that we were able to reach a sense of closure \n\nTwo days later my mom texted back starting with \"Now you decided to inform me that you wanted to close chapters. She went on to say that it would've been better had I informed this to her earlier instead of shutting her down, making that hurtful suggestion, and refusing to answer a simple yes or no question. She was unsure if I realized how sarcastic my suggestion was and reminded me that she was always there for me when I wanted to talk about my feelings and share my issues with her.\n\nAfter doing some research I realized I wasn't completely wrong where I was coming from. I was caught in the middle of a conversation intended for someone else but couldn't materalize due to their estrangement. Therefore my mom had to use me and my dad to gain information about my Grandma's plans. And yet when I had the opportunity to speak up about this, I didn't. I should've told her that I didn't want to be a part of this conversation, but at the time I wanted to say \"it's none of your business.\" For fear of sounding too harsh, I instead tried to deflect. During my research I came across information about how narcissists don't like to answer questions to keep other people uncertain, and I began to wonder to myself...is she right after all? Is my family on my dad's side being secretive and defensive? Personally my dad and grandma believed that this question was none of my mom's business.\n\nI write this because I would like to know if it's me being defensive or is she gaslighting/baiting me into triangulation? Why do I need to answer for somebody else? I hate this kind of family dynamic, especially for being labelled as part of a family culture! My family is dysfunctional, but I am not defined by it.",

I mean, people who don't know me just stare at me kinda weirdly when i finish talking but the ones who know me, don't, they just listen and smile and hug me.\n\nI just want to talk like normal people, how can i achieve this?

        "text": "Not too long ago, I almost never left the house except to go to work and my only hobby was video games. The result was dreading small talk with anyone - I had nothing to contribute to the conversation when it came to good bars/restaurants or fun places to visit. I was also ashamed that I could only speak passionately about video games so I never talked about my personal life. \n\nNaturally, I'm sure everyone saw me as boring, reserved, closed-off, etc. But what else could I do? How could I experience more to life without any friends to go with me? It felt like a vicious cycle. Not having friends meant not getting out of the house, keeping me forever boring. \n\nBut that's not true at all. You have to start somewhere. Keep doing what you're doing and you'll keep getting what you're getting. I had to break the cycle. It's perfectly fine to do some things by yourself. Some solo hobbies that get you out of the house: biking, hiking, running, gym, geocaching, plenty of others. Pick one or more and just do it. \n\nWhile you're out and about, reward yourself by visiting places nearby: museums, specialty shops, places you haven't eaten at before. Dining solo is perfectly normal. I don't have the courage to eat by myself at a fancy Italian restaurant. But sure I'll sit down by the window at a cafe. \n\nThe goal here is to see and do things to add to your experiences. Soon, you'll have confidence you didn't have when you were a homebody. That confidence makes it easier to put yourself in social settings to have interesting conversations and possibly make friends. Please don't fall into the trap of thinking having no friends dooms you to staying boring. Friends aren't a requirement for getting out of the house.",

There was also a funny exchange where a person thought they were fooling me and I was oblivious, but once they got to know me they got shy and embarrassed because they could tell I was aware of what they were doing. I just didn't show I was on to them, and noticed more than they thought I did. It wasn't a big deal, but it was funny to me.\n\nMostly, though, I'm pretty much a hermit. This fear of being seen as stupid, and going through it again, is very painful for me. If I could just get over it and relax I'd be fine. It just causes too much heart ache and issues with others. So much misunderstanding and mistakes await me if I just go out now and try to at least form relationships. I hate being aware of what's going on, but I can't do anything about it without coming off as needy or desperate to people.\n\nIs there a way to fool or convince myself it's okay to look stupid?

From PreK to 5th grade I was completly silient. Other classmates even offered me $20 before to talk and I refused. IT even got to the point I was only willing to conversate by writting in a notebook rather than talking vocally. I did talk a little at home, but nothing significant.\n\nFrom 6th grade to 12th grade, I usually only talked if someone talked to me. I never got involved in a conversation that lasted for more than 1 minute. I went to college to get a BS in Computer Science. During college I never interacted with anyone unless I had to do a group project. If I had to do any presentations in front of the class, I usually didn't show up and the professor would deduct like 10-20% off my grade. Resulted in a low GPA, but it didn't effect future job prospects much.\n\nI graduated and was able to get a job a few months later. I have been at the job for 3 years now. COVID started a year later and I stay indoors for long periods of time working remote.\n\nIt has come to the point where they are wanting people to come into the office since COVID is over and they don't want everyone to be remote 100% of the time. When other team members/leads/managers come to my desk to talk to me, I am only capable of talking about work. Once we finish that it usually ends up in very awkward silience.\n\nI am hoping my lack of social ability won't affect my job too much, but I definitely see a lot of issues with how I interact with people.\n\nIf I am completetly honest, it isn't just about my job. I want to have friends and someone important in my life, but I really can't see how that would be possible if I can't even have basic conversations. I currently have no friends and my family lives accross the country. Also wanted to point out that even with my family I am not able to have a meaningful conversation.\n\n**TLDR: I am very socially awkward and struggle to have conversations with people. I feel like my social skills are way too under developed in my 30's. The most frustrating part of this all is that I want to be social, but I don't understand what I am supposed to do to achieve that.**",

        "text": "The fundamental issue I have is that I'm standoffish even around family. People can tell I'm very repressed around them, mainly because I don't trust people to make sound judgements with me, so I can be closed off and conversations don't go too deep. The notion I get from others, is that I'm like a Tin Man with a poker face or RBS all the time. Romantically, if I decide to open up with someone showing interest in me, they seem to back off after a little while. I think my vibe romantically is I'm too obvious or come off too intense(?) it's obvious I guess to another person. \n\nThe reason I'm so closed off is because in the past I'm just use to people genuinely giving me grief, pushing my buttons on purpose, and trying to embarrass me or make me feel bad. The moment I show emotions and that I'm happy, people really want to push me down. A lot of the time it seriously feels like people develop an underlying grudge with me, and the most common issue is them being sarcastic with me and implying that I'm stupid. A lot of people seem to assume that I think that they're stupid, which I don't even think about at all. \n\nThe best and worst part about me, is I can always empathize or understand why a person thinks or does something. The bad part is I make excuses for people who cross the line and do something unfair or bad. \n\nI guess people just don't get me, and like I've learned recently, I'm a blank slate and don't express anything that much. So people fill in the blanks with me, and they are always defensive or guarded - they assume the worst about me with my character. I can be an awesome friend! I care about people, and sure at this point in my life I haven't amounted to much, but I have potential to grow and really come out of my shell. But, no one seems to care or have the patience, and they always look for excuses not to be around me. \n\nAlso, am I just in a unique situation, or are people really shallow? They make judgements so damn quick, it can be exhausting spending time with someone because I feel like if I don't pass their test with a 100% they find a reason to get rid of me. I don't know how to get rid of this feeling. \n\nAlso, I don't know if I'm stupid, but I can understand why some people would think so. I have good days and bad days, but when I'm in conversation with others it's like my mind checks out and I have trouble remembering things that I really know about. Makes it even harder to connect with someone, because I forgot something they told me, or had trouble really wrapping my mind around their own ideas so they think I don't care or lose interest. I feel trapped around people. They are so hard to please.\n\nI know what it feels like to connect with someone, and be able to have a really smooth meaningful conversation and sharing ideas. Times like this, I'm so clear headed to where I can truly understand a person and get them. I just want times like this to happen more often.",

By this I mean, I can socialize pretty well with others and I have many friends that I maintain a friendship with. \n\nBut basically, I do not like hanging out with friends outside of school (I am in high school). I know this stuff is not a big deal, every person is different and has different preferences in life (including how they spend their free time). But everyone I know spends time with their friends outside of school. Even if it's as simple as spending a couple of hours with 1 friend at your local mall. \n\nI CAN do this. My parents encourage me to hang out with friends, and I do get invited once in a while. But I just don't WANT to do it. It's not like I have social anxiety or anything like that. I just simply prefer spending some time alone. And to be honest, I like having my personal space and me time. And my friends totally understand and respect that, lucky me :) (they're awesome people).\n\nto be clear, I DO LIKE socializing with people, but only to a certain extent. I am considered by myself and many of my friends to be a warm and chatty person. \n\nWhat I want to know is, is it normal to feel this way?",

When I came back, she was upset and told me I needed to communicate better. \n\nEver since then she has not been so cheery. I'm not sure if it's because she dislikes me now or because she's been working late nights and weekends. \n\nHowever, today, she said \"Hi\" to me, so I said hi back, but then she insisted that she wasn't saying hi to me, she was saying hi to the people in the computer lab. I'm worried maybe she hates me now and there's nothing I can do to fix it. Maybe I am overreacting. What do I do?",

I’m also pending an autism assessment as my sister also believes I displayed symptoms of autism as a child, so I think I may be high functional autistic too. \n\nI always make myself practice socialising and have gotten pretty good at it, but I feel like I’m just missing the last piece of the jigsaw. \n\nI can logically find a response in conversations, like if somebody mentions their work I can ask how long they’ve been there for? Do they enjoy it? Is it working from home? And direct the conversation from there. \n\nHowever MOST of the time when I’m in conversation, there’s literally nothing in my head. It’s almost as though if you could cut my brain open and take a look, there’d just be tumbleweed or a clapping monkey. Even when I’m communicating with coworkers via Teams or Slack, I often feel the need to google the topic of conversation just to get inspiration and figure out wtf to say as my mind is blank. \n\nIt seems no amount of conversational practice helps with conjuring up thoughts though. \n\nReally hoping people here could point me in the right direction. What should I watch, read or do? \nAny advice is much appreciated.",

        "text": "My internet friend(and crush, but I'm ok with friendzone) live in abusive family(there was one situation when her father had beaten her and make death threats, and many smaller incidents). She suffer on depression and social anxiety. She is now writing matura exams and i always was hoping that she will free herself after that on studies. Few months ago she cut off all contact with me. It was in peace, she had written me that she will always think about me good and she feel uncomfortable with our contact because of high introvercy. I had written bechelor paper few weeks ago and thought that maybe it would be good occasion to renew contact so I told her about it by her brother. She reacted with anger. It was quite unexpected for me, because this brother told me that few weeks from that moment she told him that she will someday for certain renew this contact. I feel completely helpless, all the time I'm overthinking what she written to me, that she is very stressed about living high school, that she would rather die than leave it(i hope it was just stupid talking, but she had 2 suecidal attempts so I'm just worry), that she may stay in this sick home for many years, that she won't go on therapy and end up in relationship with abusive partner(i know women who have abusive fathers more likely end up with abusive partners) and i don't even know if everything is alright with her. Maybe I'm overreacting but i still remember when she was writing about suecidal thoughts and abuse she survived, and i will probably long time more worry about her. I have no way to contact her, my psychiatrist told me if i will be stronger she will help me with find this contact someway, but I'm afraid it will only make her angry, or make her thought I'm some creep or stalker. But I'm so badly worry about her, just one message from her that everything is ok would probably calm me very much. We were knowing each other almost three years, talked really hard topics, i was always supporting her, and make her feel as comfortable as I can, but suddenly she just ended it all in time i know she will have difficulties to go through and i can't even help her anyway. I feel so badly helpless.",

        "text": "Going to try and truncate my story as much as possible to make it readable\n\nI’ve always been a ‘one best friend’ kinda person growing up but for various reasons (moving away, death of a friend, growing apart, etc) I don’t have any super close friends anymore. I remember at school we had a talk about how friendships are essential for a fulfilling and healthy life, and this talk has always stuck with me and almost put the pressure on for me to maintain good friendships.\n\nI’ve got a very anxious attachment style though (lots of crappy past relationships: family, friends, romantic, etcetc) and I’ve come to realise that I struggle to feel relaxed with close friends and feel a lot of pressure and stress with them. I make friends very easily, but eventually my anxious attachment style means that I overthink things and sorta can push friends away. I’m very extroverted on the surface but I can’t maintain this over the long term.\n\nWith my last group of friends, I noticed my mental health was really suffering with my overthinking. I start off very strong and part of a close friend group, but over time my social energy kind of dwindles and I stop making such an effort and kind of accidentally fade into the background of friend groups. My overthinking and anxiety about what other people think about me then really affects my mental health and I get consumed with thoughts that they don’t really like me and it turns into a vicious spiral where I withdraw because I don’t feel wanted in the group, so spend less time with them, and then because I spend less time with them there’s no positive reinforcement that they do like me, and the cycle repeats. I’ve always judged myself so harshly for this, thinking that I’m the issue and can’t maintain friends, and that this is a huge personality flaw.\n\nIm trying hard at the moment to just be happy with who I am and not judge myself so harshly. I’ve been thinking recently that Im actually really content with living quite independently and don’t need to constantly be in contact with multiple friends to be happy. But is this a toxic thought that will hurt me in the long run? It just feels at the moment that even though I love having close friends, the friendships don’t last and I end up feeling worse about myself and wondering what is so wrong with me that no one wants to be my friend. I’m starting to think it wouldn’t be the worst thing to take the pressure off of myself, enjoy socialising every now and again, but then come home and not expect anything more of myself and my friends.\n\nI am really happy when I’m not consumed with anxiety around friendships, but will I look like a freak that no one wants to be friends with if I just accept this? I always feel so embarrassed that I don’t have friends to go on holiday with or big group chats where we tell each other everything ): but maybe I just need to accept that that’s not for everyone and it doesn’t mean somethings wrong with me to be happier without close friends",
