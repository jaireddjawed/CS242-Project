The problem is that I’m from Mexico and specialty coffee isn’t too popular yet, being that the reason that I don’t know a lot of good coffee roasters in Mexico and buying coffee from other countries is very expensive or imposible since they don’t make shippings. Do you know any good coffee roaster in México or that makes worldwide shippings? I have only heard about and tried coffee from Buna, Cafe estelar and Ilustre…",

Anyway, all of that to say that my husband has literally been the sweetest most caring partner who literally never asks for anything or buys anything for himself. So I just want to get him something he can enjoy for him. He loves coffee and spends a lot of time watching videos to learn more. I’m looking for preferably something under $150 but not sure if I can get anything of quality for that price so let me know! \n\nSorry for the rant. I’m hormonal and emotional af. \n\nTLDR: Hormonal wife wants a good burr grinder for gem of a husband and wants recommendations :)",

I figured I'd get the plastic 02 v60 and the 02 carafe and filters. \n\nI think my biggest question comes to grinders. All the videos I watched had grinders upwards of $150 or more.  I'm looking at one on Amazon, \"Manual Coffee Grinder by JavaPresse\" for $35 it has pretty good reviews. Is this a decent option for a newb to start out with?  Does anyone have a better suggestions for around the same price? I could probably go up to about $50 but am not ready to jump in to a $150+ grinder just yet.\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013R3Q7B2](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013R3Q7B2)\n\nI do want a manual one, because part of what is drawing me to this is the ritual of it all.\n\nI'm also looking at the Cosori electric gooseneck kettle on amazon. Good reviews, $70. If anyone has any suggestions for good options that might be a bit less, that'd be awesome. I don't mind splurging on a kettle because I don't have one at all, electric or otherwise, so even if my foray into pour-over ends up being just a phase, I'll still get lots of use from the kettle and I need one anyway.\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T1CH2HH/](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07T1CH2HH/)\n\nLastly I'm looking at this just kinda cheapy $20 scale.

Kenyan, medium-light roast. Did a few brews, and I just don't seem to like it overall. Currently 10 days old (roasted 7/1/23).  \nI also have, from the same roastery, a light roast from El Salvador. This is a coffee I've bought before and like quite a lot. The bag I currently have is 42 days old (roasted 6/12/22).\n\nSince I'm struggling with the new Kenyan beans, I decided to cup the two. Used James Hoffmann's videos as guides for prep and tasting.\n\nSurprisingly, the Kenyan is objectively better. Nicer aroma, sweetness, body, etc. The El Salvador is ok, the flavours I know are there, but they're very faint. Even a bit stale.\n\nSo, what gives? Is 40+ days too old? I suppose I need to cup closely roasted coffees for the comparison to be accurate, right?  \nI'll try my usual Aeropress brew with the El Salvador coffee, and see how it is.\n\nObviously, I need to refine my brew method for the Kenyan, since it tasted way better than my previous brews with it. Most of which were astringent. More with the Aeropress than the V60. I'll try coarser and reduce brew time. Do I need to use more coffee? Up it to 20gr from 18gr for 300ml?",

        "text": "Making a cup of coffee takes two ingredients, Coffee and Water. Achieving a delicious cup is all about balancing the ratio of coffee to water, and the least considered component is the temperature of water you’re using to brew. This is an essential part of brewing, and we’d like to help you adjust if needed to achieve the best cup.\n\n**How does water temperature affect coffee?**\n\nHave you ever been to a diner and received a scalding cup of coffee only to wait and realize it’s a flavorless cup of darkness that needs lots of cream and sugar to make it palatable? Well, I’ve been there, and the cup stays on the counter untouched. There are two reasons to dislike the average diner's coffee: one, it's usually robusta coffee, which is much lower in quality than Arabica, and two, the water temperature is intentionally too high, which masks the acidity and flavor of the beans.\n\nWhen boiling water is introduced to coffee grounds, the extraction of acids, oils, and caffeine is much quicker, and it’s harder to control the extraction rate as the water temperature increases. Each compound has a different impact on the flavor of your cup. Higher temperatures lead to over-extraction, making coffee taste bitter and astringent. When the water temperature is too low or you under-extracted it, coffee will lack body and doesn’t possess the sweetness it should. The exception here is cold brew which is made with room-temperature water. By extending the brewing time, you can compensate for the temperature difference.\n\n**What Is the perfect temperature for brewing?** \n\nAccording to Don Pablo, 195˚F or 90˚C is the perfect brewing temperature. Much above 195˚F or below 185˚F, and coffee loses a lot of flavor. The ideal temperature for all brewing methods is well below boiling. We recommend investing in a gooseneck kettle with a temperature gauge for easy and precise brewing if you prefer the Pour Over, Aeropress, or French press method.\n\nCheck Out This Article by The Spruce Eats: [**The 8 Best Gooseneck Kettles of 2022**](https://www.thespruceeats.com/best-gooseneck-kettles-4842831)\n\nThis may seem extreme but having a thermometer or temperature-controlled gooseneck kettle makes all the difference when brewing your morning cup. Helping you achieve the most incredible cup of coffee is our goal, and don’t forget, the most crucial factor is beans! We roast when you order it, so you receive the best-tasting low-acid coffee. Check out our coffees today and start your day off right.\n\nStart your day off with Don Pablo Coffee!",

I have to hide it from my kids (10 and under) for now, so I can't have an obvious coffee-only type machine, can't grind beans, can't store coffee in the fridge, and it can't smell too strong. It would also need minimal clean up. I've never had great coffee before (just Starbucks, McDonalds, Tim Horton's, that sort of thing), so I won't know what I'm missing yet.

Whenever I use vanilla in something cold it often benefits from heat but even when making something like whipped coffee which uses some hot water at the start its still a little funny tasting. \n\nIs it the cheapness of the extract or the alcohol? Would I have better flavor for cold drinks if i got vanilla bean paste instead?
