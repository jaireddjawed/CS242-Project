Right now I'm booked for three classes at College 1 (1:15 from both my house and my girlfriend's) and two courses at College 2 (1 hr from my house, but 15 min from my girlfriend). The grand total would be $14,100 for the semester. There was also some talk of seeing if I can get full-time at College 2 due to a retirement, but not holding my breath.\n\nA Guy I Know at College 3 out of the blue offered me a 4/4 or 4/3 contract (1:45 from my house, 2:00 from my girlfriend) at $5k/course, with benefits (that's $20k total for this semester plus bennies). There's no guarantee of the contract continuing past this year, but they desperately need me to fill a hole. I would have to drop all on-ground courses at College 1 and 2 due to scheduling.\n\nDo I stay where I am, simply burn my bridges with both my current schools, or ask them for a counter-offer?",

The input field only allows a number, so I cannot differentiate between the two. \n\nOf course I would like to count the papers where I am acknowledged since it shows that my work was good enough to be included in a publication, but I do not want to do this if it will be viewed as dishonesty. \n\nMy profs have had mixed feelings on this, so I am wondering what everyone here thinks.\n",

I can't really see myself doing anything else, or finding anything else because my subspecialty is a little niche.\n\nThe problem is I am paid well now--I'm able to take a few international trips a year and afford an apartment in the heart of NYC... who wouldn't want that in their 20's? I know I would have to make big sacrifices, but I think I have to apply. I feel an intellectual need to, despite being able to earn the salary a professor would within the time it would take to complete the PhD.\n\nSo, any thoughts on chances or similar stories?\n\n\\--\n\nUG GPA: 3.59, in honors college, did thesis. I really tanked my last year, and got a C in a psychotherapy internship course. I am worried about this.\n\nGrad GPA: 3.87 - with an INCOMPLETE for one semester of thesis -- was still reeling from some personal problems when I enrolled. Was still with a lab during grad though.\n\nResearch experience: complete immersion for the past 3 years as detailed above, been in 4 diff labs over the past 6+ years, 8 posters, second author on 2 conference papers/talks, first author on a paper in a well-ranked journal with more coming but probably not by the time I apply.\n\nClinical experience: child counseling internship in college, volunteered at a psych hospital, and the internship mentioned above that I probably shouldn't mention -- so  not much\n\nGRE: V161, Q154; Psych GRE: 780. These scores have expired and I'm confident that I will bring the Q score up to at least 158-160 by studying. I also do a lot of stats for my job, not sure if that would compensate some.\n\nLORs: one as strong as could possibly be from the professor I now work with, one of moderate quality from the director of my grad program (didnt REALLY know me), and one that is very strong (an undergrad prof who changed my life and thinks the world of me).\n\nMy advisor is pushing me to apply, is well-connected, and has personally introduced me to several leaders in the field. But still, it's a crapshoot. I'm also not sure how my red flags from years ago will factor in even though I feel I've redeemed myself.\n\nWhat kind of schools could I shoot for? And can anyone please tell me about their transition from working adult back to student? It seems so much more overwhelming than going straight from undergrad.",

I moved from the Midwest to CA a few months after I turned 18, where I lived for free with someone for about a year and then got a roommate to whom I pay rent though I am NOT on the lease. I work full time and have for two years (part time for one), registered to vote, all that good stuff. I am behind on filing taxes but mostly because this has me stumped. \n\nBut I have had zero contact with my parents. None. For the last three years, so I don't know whether or not they're claiming me on their taxes still. Again, they have provided NO support. I haven't even CALLED them. They don't know where I live. But they're well off enough that I wouldn't get financial aid (even though I am very not myself lol) and more importantly, I don't know if I can get in state tuition because they might be claiming me!\n\nCan they do that if they've had no contact? Can I do something about that? How in the world am I supposed to file my taxes?\n\nAny advice would be amazing. Obviously things aren't super stable for my life but I already feel like I wasted half of it being 21 and not even in college yet, so I'm pretty desperate to figure this out. And of course, it's expensive out here so I can't juggle cost of living and out of state tuition.\n\nThanks everyone/anyone! ",

Becoming a professor would be most ideal because I could spend the rest of my life in research. However, forums have discussed that option is costly and competitive- with no fall back plan. I am thinking of a career maybe as a grant writer, a journalist, or a school teacher.  A school teacher would require me to double major in philosophy and biology (BA) plus get my teacher's certificate. I wish there were more clear career options for liberal arts majors. ",

It was a subject that I thought because of its interdisciplinary orientation would come close to my actual interests which are cultural studies and media, both of which don't have commendable centres where I live, ie India. Instead I realised that I don't quite enjoy the subject and have been planning to leave ever since. But due to parental,social and peer pressure I find myself unable to do so. I have been stuck in this for 4 years now. I am entering my 5th year now and I have done absolutely no work with regard to my doctorate, not even a good proposal. I also don't have a scholarship and am dependent on part-time/freelance work, which pays peanuts, and my parents who are quite well off generally.  None of this is appealing though. At this point, most people suggest that I should just study and finish my doctorate. But I know that this would have absolutely no value. My professors are not from my field and don't have any interest in my work. Most of what they suggest is useless or from schools of thought/fields  that have no bearing on my work. In summation, I have no money, no moral high ground to claim I am learning even if I am not earning and moreover I have lost all interest in academics as I have gained nothing. Even if I write it will be an embarrassment. \nMy question is what should I do, apply for a job and quit or just try and finish? And if so, how do I write with no research, money or time to get either? I am qualified to teach in colleges in two subjects but jobs are not easy to come by in the field. And i have no skill set for or inclination towards any profession at this point. I am almost 30 now. \n\n\n\n/Edit: I was pretty prolific writer, writing both papers and poetry regularly albeit without publication but my experiences since graduation (personal and professional) have made things so difficult that it can take me weeks, if not months to write just a few pages. After feeling completely hopeless and despondent for a good 7 years I am finally trying to regain parts of my life that I cherish. To final want to take this decision stems from this desire to change. And also, perhaps, wanting to evade that final moment of action. ",

Since my project didn't specifically require too much lab work, I have also been helping out in the lab in a couple other (of his) projects, doing data collection.  This data collection occurred almost daily back in June and July, but since mid-July now it has been weekly which was definitely not an inconvenience to me at all.\n\nAnyway, yesterday was my final research presentation where I presented all of the work I did on my specific project at a conference, and even though I was super anxious about it, I am fairly happy with how it went.  I was told that the postdoc would be attending but he unfortunately didn't end up coming, and he ended up leaving a message explaining how he woke up late and couldn't come in time, but hopes that I did well.  He thanked me for continuing to do the weekly data collection, but then he asked me if I could call him back to discuss helping him on a bunch of tests he was doing over the next little while, which would involve coming in daily (starting tomorrow) for the rest of the next week or two.  This wasn't really something I anticipated, and had planned the rest of August under the assumption that I would just be continuing with the weekly data collection, as I have been doing for about a month.  As well, I also have an exam for a summer course coming up next week, and am definitely in need of time to prepare for it.\n\nMy question is: is it fair for him to ask this of me (with barely 24 hours notice), even though the terms of my research funding are explicitly tied to the project that I just completed, and don't require me to help out in (his) other projects?  Also, is it fair of me to tell him that I am unable to help because of the exam that I am preparing for?\n\nThis is my first research position so I am very new to how things generally work in academia with undergrad interns, so any advice or thoughts are appreciated.  Thanks!",

I am very confident that this is something I can do, namely because many of my interests come together for what promise to be a very exciting project. I have no doubt in my mind that I want to do this PhD, but my academic record relates very little to the content/objects of study. \n\nIn short, I am theoretically sound and confident, I just lack content at the time of this application.\n\nSo here is my question: Should I be honest about my shortcomings? Or do I emphasize that I am willing to put in the time and work necessary to fulfill what is expected of me? Both? How do I approach what is a pretty obvious blind spot in a manner that is conducive towards being considered for this position? \n\nSo you have an idea, this is my academic track so far:\n\n* BA - French and Francophone Studies, Literature track\n* Research MA - Literary Studies, emphasis on Ecocriticism\n* PhD position I'm applying for: *Imagining the Rural Post-Brexit*\n\nIf it matters, the principal investigator for the PhD project is my MA's second reader and she gave me good feedback and constructive criticism. The PhD position is at the same university I did my RMA. \n\nAny advice is very welcome!\n\nCheers!",

        "text": "\nI’m a Life science Master student. At my Uni, we have to apply to a Lab for a one year research position to do research and write our master thesis there. I had found a very interesting project about ADHD using a method I really wanted to learn more about and applied. During my interview I mentioned my ADHD as one of the reasons I’m interested in the project. I got the position but should have been evaluated first by my lab team during an internship I wanted to do anyways.\n\nTo make it short, the lab is a shit show. The team is great! But unfortunately the prof lied to the other employees about the actual status of the project (which is causing one by one to leave), doesn’t think the old methods are problematic (which they are) and the PI talks bad behind the back of others etc. I also realized that the actual research work I would be able to do for my master thesis isn't what I expected and what I wanted to learn. That’s why I went to the PI yesterday to explain to her that I’m rejecting her offer (which I received from her after she had found out I also applied to another, very similar master position the week before). I focused my reasoning on my lack of interest in the specific type of work I would do (not the general project) and that I wouldn’t feel it’s fair for the project to work on it if I’m not 100% committed to my work. After asking if I had another offer (which I hadn’t thanks to her meddling), she then basically told me that I don’t know what research is about and that I should be careful because of my ADHD as every project sounds exiting on paper but gets boring after 2 months. I then clearly said that Im not rejecting her offer due to my (fucking) ADHD but that I want to be passionate about my project and I don’t think this would be the case here due to the specific type of work I would be able to do at this stage of the project. This wouldn’t be fair for the whole project and for me. She dismissed my reasoning completely and just said again: “yeah, yeah but just be careful.” I thanked her for her ‘input’ but told her again my reasoning and ensured her this is not an impulsive decision for me (and my deep interest in her project is of course still there,I just learned what I want to do). \n\nAs I have said, she likes to talk bad behind the back of her employees about them and she is working in a field I’m interested in in general at Uni. So, it could be possible that my future employers know her and will contact her for reference. I know she told my direct supervisor than I'm an example master student and that she is looking for people like me but I’m worried that she will now talk bad behind my back to other professors and say I’m flaky, not dependable, inconsistent etc. (she did that to another master student that had left her lab after a few weeks of being there).\n\nI still have one month of my internship left and I see her every day during lunch. Should I talk with her sooner or later and tell her that I appreciate her wanting to advice me but that I thought it was inappropriate of her to mention my ADHD as my reason of leaving or should I just leave it be? I’m quite mad but I think I should be able to talk with her about this calmly. I’m tempted to do it as soon as possible.\n\n✌️\n\nEDIT:\n\n**SOLVED (?)**: I decided to ask my PI for a reference letter after my internship so I won't be afraid that she will talk bad behind my back. \n\n=&amp;gt; Thanks for all your replies and advice! Your stated some fair concerns and I'll try to answer them the best I can:\n\n1. **I seem to make a 180° interest switch:** For me, the *Project* is very interesting, but the *Work* I would be doing there is not what I imagined to do:\n\n* I told her in my interview, that my main interest in her project is because they it work with specific research technique, specifically in neuroscience I want to learn more about. ADHD is a good plus, because of my personal interest.\n* I asked the PI what my Work would include. PI told me that she can't tell me exactly but the idea is when I would start in 10 months, I could work on what I would be interested in (in general), but it could be that I would be doing 'research' on the *methods* section of the whole project (***she later told others from the lab that she basically just needs technicians for her project and she knows that master students wouldn't learn many different techniques***).--&amp;gt; But I should have asked more questions and be more specific of what I was looking for in the very beginning. I definately learned that.\n* One of the reasons I started the internship to see that state of the project, learn the techniques and be able to start with my research immediatly when I would start in 6 months now. I soon realised that I wouldn't be able to do the work I was hoping to do, because the project just isn't developed enough for my interest.  \n\n* A big reason for my decision was also her lack of management, supervision/mentoring and honesty in her work. I don't trust her in general because she has lied in several occasions to the other lab members (and they were big lies), doesn't treats them correctly and doesn't really care about them their work. This was a **big red flag** for me as well, as when I will start my master thesis in a few months, I would be working all alone in the lab with no one else working with me i.e. no support in any case. But this is something I obviously couldn't have told her about... so I kept my lack of interest in the specific work I would do as my main interest. \n\n1. **Research can be boring and tedious:**\n\n* I'm definitely very aware of that! But that's exactly why I want to learn something I'm actually interested in. So, even in the phases where I'm bored and desperate, it will be easier to regain my motivation.\n* I want to like what I'll be doing and I want to care about the outcome of my research. I know I could be doing very good work for her and exactly what she is looking for but I wouldn't be learning that what I was looking for and what I know other labs could offer me, even without me using that specific technique I'm interested in.",

        "text": "To preface, I'll try to be vague to not out the group. Sorry if this is a bit rambley; I'm feeling very overwhelmed by the situation.\n\nI am an early career scientist in the process of preparing my first lead author publication. I inherited this project as a research assistant. It was my job to update and improve a novel research method and prepare a manuscript presenting our results for peer review (the preliminary work was published as a report, but not peer reviewed). We submitted early this year and it was rejected with some harsh but valid criticisms. I have been completely reworking it to address all of these issues, including confronting the PI about some content they inserted that was highly criticized by reviewers for being too abrasive (and in some cases, factually wrong). At the time, they assured me this was the \"right way\" to present it and I was too scared to say no even though I felt they were overstepping. The PI is a well known, highly cited member of our field and I've never written a manuscript before. After some long discussions, they have finally agreed to the changes. I wrote them up and the manuscript was sent to the PI for approval before submission last week. I stopped formally working for the PI in April but intend to see the project through to completion. I have since started graduate school at the same institution in a different but related department.\n\nWhile I worked on my revisions, a paper came out in a top tier journal in our field that refutes some work the research group has done. Our lab made a spatial model to predict global patterns and the data presented in this new paper has been \"ground truthed\" and shows that our model isn't correct (this isn't the exact situation but close enough). The work I have been updating is one input dataset for the model, but my work is not explicitly linked to it. This has really bruised the PI's ego and they are looking for ways to save face (there is also rumour this rival group will publish a subsequent paper to further discredit other work the research group does). Their plan is to insert a new section into my paper that addresses the new paper. They have just pitched their solution to me informally and want to have a formal meeting this week to hammer out details. They now want me to present some of the output of the model in my paper and that they will come up with a method that makes this output look closer to the rival publication's results. My original results will not be presented in their \"raw\" form (without manipulation). This seems highly questionable to me, and when I ask how the new method will work, it sounds like they will simply fudge the data to make it look better with some weak scientific rationale.\n\nI don't want anything to do with this. I've worked tirelessly on this project for almost two years and I'm watching it crash and burn. It will be credited to my name. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills and the only one thinking rationally about this. If can't talk the PI out of this, I will have to remove myself from the paper and sacrifice my first lead author publication. It will be highly damaging to my professional and personal life. Even though I am no longer a member of this research group, I am on friendly terms with the PI and senior scientist (who wrote me stellar reference letters for graduate school) and consider some of the other research assistants close friends. I am a collaborator on several other papers in review and in prep with this group and who knows how I'll be treated if I back out.\n\nAm I right for having this reaction? Is there any situation where the PI's actions can be justified? I feel as lead author I should have the ability to say no and have final say, but that doesn't seem to work with the PI. Should I just wash my hands of this whole mess and move on with my graduate studies?",

How ever I feel like my PhD advisor does not respect me, he does not listen to me very carefully, when I am explaining my argument I feel like he does not give much attention etc. This pisses me off deeply, and highly demotivates me. Also he ia micro managing me, by giving very specific tasks like calculate this and that, but I feel like a calculator rather than a scientist. I dont get a good guidiance but what I get is just directives. \n\nI have been sucsesful in my bachelor degree, and I had a good pape rin masters. But when I get too much micro managing and disrespect, this affects me and I can't focus. I feel like a moron and a child. How do I stop him getting under my skin, and start to work like a dynamo like I did before? The ADHD is I think makes people not respect me because it makes me too exicted and makes my mind runes a mile at a second. SO people just see me as a kid, with mediocre intelligence. I mean I agree that I asked him some trivial questions. But I don't deserve disrespect, and I had been very sucsefful in the past. So I know I have the potential. I really need some advice and directions. thank a lot.  \n",

Not only because - due to factors that fall outside my responsibility - I don't have much time on my hands as I wished, but also because I'm starting to feel like I'm bullshitting too much. Are the questions new? Yes. Do I actually believe I can answer them? Surely. But are they important? Well. Probably not. I mean, my whole PhD sounds, to me, irrelevant to most people. I'm an evolutionary biologist but most of my research is dedicated to basic knowledge. I love basic knowledge, but I can help but feel that this whole thing is pointless. I'm not even sure that I would give money to my own application if I was the one judging it. \n\nI know that, part of this, is impostor syndrome because I'm a biologist that spends his time mostly doing maths. But it has to be more than that. What I really want to know is: did you go through the same when first trying to be independent? Did you have the same feelings? I know that, at this point, I should just ask for feedback from people (my collaborators, mostly). And I will do that. But I want to make sure that what I'm feeling is normal or if I should heavily change the program of my application. Just want a sanity check please. ",

        "text": "Hello everyone. I last posted here a little while ago with this thread - [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/8izug0/regular\\_coauthor\\_coresearcher\\_and\\_close\\_friend\\_no/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/8izug0/regular_coauthor_coresearcher_and_close_friend_no/). Succinctly, a long-term co-author and friend had totally stopped pulling her weight, and it was becoming a problem with a co-authored book looming.\n\nWELL. A lot has happened since then, and although a lot of steps have been handled, I now find myself at a strategically tricky situation I'd appreciate any insight on.\n\nSince the last update, we just hadn't done much work together as there were no more deadlines looming, and I knew we'd be able to see each other in person before we had to commit to the book (around 20k / 80k has been written, 75% by me, and the proposal document was 100% me). When we finally did see each other in person after around nine months, initially things were friendly. At the start of the chat she actually floored me by suggesting after this first book we write a second, shorter book, a “popular” book, as a kind of “popular introduction” to our field of research. Given how little she has been doing on our project, I was amazed, to say the least, but expressed noncommittal interest and moved on.\n\nHowever, although it was clear neither of us had planned it, we somehow got into a “showdown” situation, where it became clear we were both unhappy. The main points of this argument were:\n\nOne. That stuff I wrote in the previous thread, she just doesn’t agree happens. She just remembers, or claims to remember, black being white. I have literal textual evidence in emails and on Slack of things not being how she claimed, but she just did a “No, no, that’s not true”, even when I pointed out the evidence was there. This really startled me, as I didn’t expect this kind of psychological warfare tactic from her. She insists she didn’t forget about the paper I wrote and was going to put her name on, that she did actually contribute to it (she wrote zero words, and made a handful of commented suggestions), etc. I just... yeah, I just didn’t expect this, and I wasn’t sure how to handle someone saying black was white. In hindsight, this floored me a bit and I think I could have been better later in the argument had this not happened, but I suppose it is what it is.\n\nTwo. She claimed that paper she left me to finish after promising to write 100% of it, she was going to swing in to finish. This is of course one of those classic situations where I cannot \\*technically\\* disprove that statement, but that’s exactly why she said it, because there is no hard evidence otherwise. But I know for a fact she wasn’t going to do it; she dumped it on me, made it clear she considered it “almost done” when it was nothing of the sort, disappeared, and hadn’t touched it when there was basically no time left, and I just had to come in and finish the entire thing.\n\nThree. She said “\\[Name\\], you’re just very hard to write with”. That came out of nowhere completely, and never before had she expressed anything of this sort. My pride demands that I point out two other co-authors have told me I'm the easiest person they've ever written with, and multiple people have badmouthed her to me in the past (during which I always defended her...). I am pretty damned confident the fault does not lie with me. I will acknowledge “we write in different ways”, but that’s nobody’s fault. Again, though, shifting blame onto me.\n\nFour. She acknowledged it was my primary field and not her primary field, and that the book is essential to me, entirely non-essential to her. So that’s something. She also acknowledged that this was originally my project, which I brought her into, which I think could be valuable.\n\nFive. She said we need to find a “new style of working together” if we want to do the book... but then refused to tell me what this entailed. She said she didn’t like the fact I wrote long paragraphs and long sentences (this is certainly accurate of my writing style) and she always writes very short paragraphs and short sentences, but that’s not exactly something to jeopardise a mutually profitable writing relationship over; we can just find a middle-ground, right? When I asked for more detail, she just dissembled, dodged, and wouldn’t be drawn any further. Not quite sure what to make of this element.\n\nNow, I try to always be a very critically-minded person. I have reflected hard since this on whether there is some substance to these, but... I just don't think there is. It’s psychological warfare. As above, other people have said very negative things to me about her behaviour before, but I’d never seen it; I \\*have\\* seen it now, however, and it’s devastating, both in terms of our friendship, and when our professional lives are so entangled it’s so worrying. Especially because this is \\*my\\* field, I am entangled with her more than she is with me. I just wish I'd listened to all these people telling me how vindictive and nasty she could be before I got so entangled.\n\nThe conversation concluded with her saying I needed to go away and decide whether I “wanted” to write the book with her. After that, we made up a bit, and made proclamations to still be friends, although I am somehow not convinced this is the case (though I hope it is).\n\nAround ten days go by, and I ponder.\n\nThen I send her an email saying \"Okay, I've thought a ton about this, but I cannot say whether or not I still want to write the book with you or not unless you tell me what your issues are\", in a very nice, constructive tone. She replies saying \"You're trying to put the onus on me, the onus is actually on you to decide\". Again, more psychological warfare. What?! That's like going to a mechanic, the mechanic asks about the problem with your car, and you say \"I shouldn't have to tell you that! You're supposed to just fix it!”. Anyway, I then realise we might be using \"want to\" in different ways, i.e. she might mean \"would you LIKE to\", whereas I had the impression it was being used in the colloquial sense like \"do you want to go to the shop?\", meaning \"are you going to come to the shop right now?\", and therefore I thought she was asking me to commit, rather than express desire. Maybe this is unrealistic, but I just wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt, just one last time. So I write back, asking for clarification on this point, and she replies, saying she has thought things through and now she doesn't want to write the book with me.\n\nSo... in some ways, this simplifies things. I just write it myself. The problems are now several, but the main one is her suggestion of a popular book, and that she said in her final response that we should “talk about what to do with our data” but she is still \"committed to working together\" on future work aside from this book.\n\nThe big issue is that it would be very problematic for me for her to put this book out first, even if it's a \"popular\" rather than \"academic\" text. Same goes for her going off and writing single-authored papers that give out our data; I want us to keep co-authoring. But I’m also just deeply, deeply shocked and hurt in a personal sense; I just had no idea she had this side to her, this very manipulative, deceptive, psychological-warfare-y side to her, and it's just so upsetting to see it from someone I thought was a friend. At the risk of being unduly emotional, I must confess I shed a tear or two during writing this. It's just so upsetting and unpleasant.\n\nSo... any thoughts on what to do? I have some ideas, but I'm open to suggestions. Any that might, somehow, save the friendship would be lovely, but the professional issues have to come first. Naturally, my intention is now to write my book as fast as possible, the last 60k in the next 4 months, but that’s going to be hard. ARGH. Ideas? Thanks, all, for reading such a monster post, and I hope your academic lives are going far better than mine right now.",

        "text": "I've tried to find help on the Mendeley site but with no luck. I store my articles locally, and they sync to a shared group. The problem is I have multiple articles that others have too, often with minor alterations (e.g., mine has the author full first name, another has the author's first initial only). So, whenever I want to cite in word, often Mendeley with think they are two different articles. It's causing a lot of confusion. Has anyone had this problem and found a way to overcome it, rather than manually deleting each duplicate - cause it just refreshes again every time it syncts.",

For yourself, not for academic papers you write.\n\nRight now I'm quoting using copy-paste and citing below each quote with the MS Word, which is really inefficient and disorganized.\n\nAny recommendations for programs/management tips?\n\nThanks!",
