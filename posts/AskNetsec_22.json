When I get DMARC reports from providers to whom I've actually sent e-mails from my domain on my server's IP, they do not bounce and they show as `pass` on those reports.\n\nBefore the spoofing began, my `p` and `sp` values were listed as `none` and set to get reports only. After the second day of spoofing, I switched the DNS records for both to `reject`.  The DMARC reports are showing that both before and after this change that all of the spoofed e-mails had failed both DKIM and SPF.   The only difference between the reports pre- and post- is that it reflects the change I made from `none` to `reject` in the \"disposition\" field.\n\nIt believe that I am set up correctly with DKIM/SPF, especially since the e-mail that I send reliably goes thru, and these spoofing attempts are all showing that they failed, but this is the first time I've been spoofed like this and I wanted to make sure I'm doing everything I need to keep my domain off spam lists.  From what I understand, you can't really prevent someone from spoofing your domain to send e-mail, and I'm already doing best practice by having these records published to let anyone know that any e-mail that doesn't come from my server's IP address is spam.\n\nMy question is do I need to do any action with these DMARC reports or should I report these IP addresses to anyone?   Almost all of the IP addresses from which the spoofed emails came from are already listed on Spamhaus, so they seem to be known offenders.\n\nI hope I've provided enough info to ask a good question, without giving so much that I'm confusing the issue.

My girlfriends friend has traced the IP of these accounts to an IP adress of the city we live in, but we know for sure no one in the server who would for some reason want to send these messages lives in our city or even country. This is what makes us believe someone is trying to frame my girlfriend so she gets banned from the community or something like that.\n\n\nWhat is also important is that this person also has had access to my girlfriends discord account and accessed private messages.

I've honestly hit a mental &amp; research roadblock, and invite a wide open forum for ideas.  I'll offer a little background and then questions:  \n\nI've got 20+ years of infrastructure security engineering, systems administration/hardening, and infosec experience primarily through my time in the US Air Force.  I'm now an ISSM in civil service.  Practically all of my experience is in government or gov contracting, so I have little private sector experience.  In that time, I picked up a crazy number of certifications (e.g., CISSP, CEH, CPT, Sec+, ITIL, SSCP, etc), a double Masters (Business, and Cyber Sec), and experience in a wide variety of domains (pen testing, compliance, crypto, hardening, incident response, infra eng, and several years in various management over these areas).  My overarching goal is to continue ascending into higher management eventually reaching Senior Executive Service (SES) level.  \n\nI've hit or exceeded every goal I've set for myself personally and professionally over the last 15 years, and rather than feeling elated... I feel a profound sense of loss, and extreme difficulty in choosing \"what's next\".  Additionally, my new agency is fairly open to paying for any relevant training courses, college courses, conference attendance, etc.  This leaves me almost too many choices to consider the best path(s). I could really use the advise of those with government experience (to help with a new roadmap based on exp), and private sector individuals (to better understand what's coming in our field, since gov usually lags in IT... which further helps me develop a roadmap).  \n\nQuestions: \n\n- What do you recommend to further solidify my skillset towards higher leadership positions?  I have experience leading 100+ military and civil service employees concurrently.  \n- Thoughts on applicability of a DSc or PhD in Cybersec?  I'm heavily leaning towards pursuing it, but I'd like more input.  This depends on getting scholarships, grants, and tuition assistance through my agency (requires a waiver at Director level for post-grad).  I've managed my education so far entirely on tuition assistance and scholarships, so I'd rather not \"come out of pocket\".  If you don't recommend a doctorate, why and do you recommend another BS or MS to complement?  \n- Are there specific domains or technologies I should pursue that's bleeding edge in the private sector that may have government applicability later?  \n\nThanks!\n",

Anywho...\nI think my laptop (Toshiba from like 2010 or something) has been hacked. But I honestly have no clue. So what happens is, when my laptop sits idle (not in sleep mode) (it sits idle a lot because I’m an artist and pull up reference pictures on my laptop to draw from) my cursor starts “controlling itself”- it opens a new tab, types in amazon, and attempts to log in. The first time this happened (about two weeks ago) I WAS logged in to my amazon account- and “it” tried to buy a gift card. As soon as I realized what was happening I quickly “regained control” of the cursor (wasn’t hard at all, just had to manually move mouse) and closed out of the tab. Since then, I’ve logged out of my amazon account (and changed my password). This has now happened 3 times since then. It’s the same pattern as the first time, but now when “it” gets to the amazon sign-in page, “it” goes away. (Because it doesn’t know my log in info) \n\nAt first I was scared, but now I’m just annoyed and a little worried. Can “it” get access to my login info? How about my login info for other site? If it knows I’m no longer logged into my amazon account, why does it keep trying? And most importantly, is there a person behind all this or is this some weird virus?? \n\nWill gladly answer any questions anyone leaves below!! Thank you smart people &lt;3 \nI also have a video of this all happening if anyone would be interested. I didn’t get the whole process (it happens pretty fast) but I got the end\n\nEDIT: y’all got any clue how this could have happened? I hardly use this computer, mainly just for art references and Spotify. Watch YouTube occasionally. \n\nEDIT PT 2: woah this kinda “blew up” ha ha I’m famous jk anyways thank you everyone for your help sorry I’m bad wth computers and don’t know what a lot of this stuff means but I am taking this very seriously. my dad has wiped this computer before when it got a virus a couple years back so we’ll just have to do it again.

So, I need some guidance on what to do. Is it a good a idea to switch degrees and jump straight to cybersecurity degree? Is a cybersecurity degree from a community college plenty enough to try to get into the field? I've been trying to get an entry position in any sort of helpdesk position or entry IT position to gain experience, but they want you to have at least a cert and work fulltime. I've  taken classes that will \"prepare\" you for comptia a+, network+, security+ and even a Microsoft's client cert but, It's too much and I can't focus on my school's curriculum and focus on the cert. \n\nThe sole purpose of my degree is to prepare me for CCENT and CCNA, but If I really want to go to security should I stick to networking? My school also offers CCNA Security, but it's not even part of the networking degree or cybersecurity degree. I've been in school for so long now, and honestly I want to get working soon so I can get experience and get paid too!\n\n",

        "text": "Hi all.\n\nI had an interesting discussion with a colleague about the secrecy of user names. I think most of us will agree that the way we use credentials today makes user names kind of public information. Every time you write an email using your gmail account you will give away your account name, twitter, github, wordpress, whatever all publish your user name.\n\nIt follows that you can not rely on the secrecy of the user name for anything, it is public data. This resulted in the following question:\n\nIf user names are public data, why is user enumeration, the ability to get essentially public data, a vulnerability?\n\nKnowing the user names makes brute force attacks on a service exponentially easier, so I guess we can say that knowing user names decreases a system's security and indeed makes it more vulnerable. So, should user names be kept secret after all? Is the way we treat user names actually insecure?\n\nI think the way we use account names is indeed technically insecure, mitigated by implementing measures like limiting the number of login attempts or optionally requiring more factors for authentication. \n\nI'd be happy to hear what you think about this. Should user names considered secret? Is user enumeration even a problem? Why/why not? Is the answer to this a clear \"it depends\"?",

She been there for a long time and i was brought in three years ago to build up the security. I don't feel like i did anything wrong nor did I know about her displeasure in the policies till after she quit.\n\nSo she was working on two unpatched machines. The latest version was Rhel 7.4 and the ones she was working on was 6.4 and 7.1. These machines can't be patched. They go through firewalls, but traffic is not being actively monitored. If you ran am agent scan on them, they would return 220 vulns and 78 respectively. None of them could be patched. We couldnt sandbox the machines off.\n\nThe user wanted full root access and wanted to be able to reach the internet. Saying it was essential. From my eyes, it was convenience. They had a fully patched monitored machine next to them. No proper business justification was given, just kept saying she needed it. We said no, if we give you full root you need to be sandboxed off and can't access the internet. \n\nUser, a sw engineer, got mad and quit to go work for a it service company that specializes in security....\n\nWas there a better way to handle this? I couldn't sandbox. They didn't want sudo. I couldn't implement a monitoring solution. SAs wouldn't allow patching cause of dependency breakage and such. ",

Full disclosure, this is a real fund investing in small enterprises however my position on the board is purely educational and I do not possess a vote for investment decisions. This board was interested in bringing on a \"younger\" perspective, hence my role. I do not stand to make any financial gain from this position and in fact the board itself is a non-profit government organization.\n\n5 of the 6 companies I have reviewed to date have been SaaS business models. By the time they get to the investment board due diligence work has been done with respect to their Financials,  accounting, market sizing, competition, etc.. however I have not seen a single mention of how they handle their data, what protection (if any) they have in place, what their consent strategy is, who has access to the data, if they are compliant with privacy laws. I don't come from an IT background (I am a mechanical engineer in an MBA program), so I am having trouble coming up with concise questions I can pose to the board and the companies to make sure they have thought about these things, which is a question I wanted to pose to this community: if you were performing due diligence on a small SaaS enterprise, what is one question (or however many you need) you could ask be addressed to give you comfort that data security and privacy have been taken into consideration?\n\nThanks in advance for any insight. I think this is an important topic that gets looked over until something bad happens. These are companies with &lt;50 employees and &lt;$1MM in revenue so I think these matters might be pretty low priority to them, and in fact any expensive IT measures could render their business model unprofitable (.. and some are already in a negative cash flow position). However for a few their data is key to their model, and so any event that compromises their data could also render them unprofitable.",

        "text": "This is a long one, but it's good. If it's against the rules I will gladly remove, but I think this is something some people in this field need to hear.\n\ntl;dr, the OSCP course showed me I needed to get help for my mental illness and its the best thing I've ever done\n\nThis morning I received my coveted email from Offensive Security that I passed my OSCP exam.\n\nSome of you may recall my post a few months back ([https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/827y3n/i\\_have\\_failed\\_the\\_oscp\\_5\\_times/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/827y3n/i_have_failed_the_oscp_5_times/)) that was met with mixed responses. A lot of people insisted that the exam SHOULD NOT take this many tries. But I'm not afraid to admit that it took 7 ATTEMPTS for me to finally nail this beast.\n\nI started the OSCP curriculum last March and took my first attempt last June (today is my year anniversary of that first attempt) and since then have taken an exam as often as I could. In those 3 months, I squandered my 90 days of lab time, clueless as to what this certification offered. I got 10 lab machines, finished the exercises, and called that that. It was a huge waste of time, and I deeply regret not digging deeper. I had to compensate later and ended up getting 3 more months worth of lab time to nail 32 machines.\n\nMy first exam I failed with 50 points\n\nMy second I failed with 60\n\nThird and Fourth were the same\n\nFifth I had 65 points, just barely not enough\n\nWe don't need to talk about the 6th (I used an illegal tool for a 25 pointer so I went from 75 to 50)\n\nEach exam I faced some of the same challenges and some new challenges. But one challenge I couldn't overcome was myself. Every exam I went into a fit of malfocus. I struggled to eat, sleep, and shower during the exam period. I thought it was just testing nerves. My husband, however, could see something was very wrong.\n\nI was diagnosed with OCD as a teenager, but never got treatment beyond counseling. For me, it seemed like a boon. I could work extremely long hours on a large number of tasks without issue, and literally did not have the ability to relax. I was suffering, but I was so excited with how it fed my ambitions I didn't care. High school was a breeze, college was a breeze, even getting into my dream field felt like a breeze. I attributed that to my OCD. It let me make the progress I wanted to make, or so I thought. For years I pushed the constant anxiety, fear, and deeply disturbing thoughts that come with OCD on the backburner, because I was so successful for my age. Bachelors degree at 19, in the industry by 20. I feared that if I were to ever address the issue, I would lose everything I had worked for. I had never truly felt challenged by anything but myself, so I had no idea how deep the issues were. \n\nAfter I failed my first OSCP exam something happened. My obsessive compulsions turned sour, rather than helping me move forward. I started performing bizarre habits, stayed up way too late, woke up way too early. Even when I wasn't working on OSCP related material, I constantly thought about how I could be better. And it was not healthy. I started neglecting other important things (not my work or my pets, luckily, but my marriage? Friends? OH YEAH).\n\nI kept failing, but never felt discouraged. It just meant I needed to TRY HARDER. But, trying harder wasn't doing favors to the people in my life. After my third attempt, my husband pulled me aside, and explained that there was something terrifying about my behaviors, my sleeping patterns, and my complete rejection of what was good for me in life. I had been losing weight, taking on too many projects at work, and not putting on the breaks for anything. He finally told me to get some help, knowing it was likely my old demons calling.\n\nI waited until after my fifth try to get with a psychiatrist. I started taking medication after the 6th. And within the last month and a half, something has changed completely. \n\nI won't go into the gorey details, but OCD is a bizarre trip of a condition. It's not just cleaning the house and perfectionism. It's a dark, terrifying shadow over everything you do. It causes anxiety, violent thoughts, nightmares, the works. The day when I could feel the medicine working, I actually got scared. Because for a moment, the world was so quiet. I ate breakfast without feeling like I was committing a crime for not doing something at that moment. I actually think I had a religious experience with a pear because I hadn't tasted fruit in so long without the constant thought that eating was a waste of time. And since then I feel like I'm experiencing life in a completely different light. I still have a long way to go. But I've also found, facing this beast didn't change my ambition.\n\nI finished my 7th try in 12 hours. 75 points and the 5 bonus points. Wrote my report before hour 19. Took a nap, and played on the last host a bit longer. Even got close to a low priv. I was able to sit, and enjoy what I was doing. The exam was a blast and somehow, a breeze, even thought most of the hosts I was up against were brand new. And since the exam on Sunday I've been happily able to research problems I had and tools I used at my leisure, without any pounding, terrifying thoughts. One machine at a time, good meals, good breaks.\n\nGet help guys. It won't stop you from being great. You don't need to be sick to be successful. In fact, it might just save your skin.",

My skills are mostly security related, but I'm fairly fluent in general linux systems administration and C/Java/Python. I have only informal experience running linux servers and some very small coding projects to point to, but I'm certainly capable of answering questions on a whiteboard or nailing an interview if I can get that far.",

        "text": "So I've been debating getting a password manager as of late, to help me combat my poor password habits. I've been reading in to password managers, and most of the content I've found is tales of people leaving manager A for manager B, because of reasons XYZ. I'm a little bit overwhelmed with the options, and was hoping someone could help me out.  \n  \nFirst off, I'm technically savvy but not interested in setting up my own local DB for a password vault. I know that KeePass is highly recommended since it's open source and let's you handle your own  keys, but it seems a bit too involved for me. I don't mind paying for a service, provided it's not outrageously expensive. I am a Windows/Android/ChromeOS user, so selecting a service that's friendly with those OS's is preferable to me. The couple that have stood out to me so far are BitWarden and LastPass. Are there any others I should consider? Is there any reason to avoid the aforementioned services?\n\nI understand that there's a trade-off between security/convenience in this case. Right now, I'm leaning more towards convenience. I currently don't use a manager, so if it's complicated I likely won't bother or will give up. I also don't currently use a manager, so my rationale is that SOME manager is better than my currently poor password habits.  \n  \nThanks in advance!  \n(edit: sorry if I've butchered the terminology in my post. Clearly this is a new area for me)",

We are happy with FileVault's level of protection in that 1) cipher text is stored on the disk and 2) It would be cryptographically infeasible to brute force the password (if it was sufficiently complicated) whether at the boot screen of the machine or if you ripped the hard drive out and tried offline.\n\nFor Bitlocker on Win10, I'm trying to figure out if TPM-only mode is enough. I believe that the TPM handles the keys so that the data written to the HDD is ciphertext. How about an online attack? What if someone tries booting into a different OS? If TPM-only still requires the user account password to login, what's difference between that and TPM + PIN?\n\nThank you.",
