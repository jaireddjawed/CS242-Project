When I go to places like /r/bluemidterm2018 I see stuff about candidates all the time. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like this sub generally agrees with certain urban-related policies such as reduced parking minimums, improved public transportation, bike lanes, freeway removals, and the like.\n\nHere in Maryland I personally have strong views against Governor Hogan, given that he's pretty much ignored Baltimore as a whole with the cancellation of the Red Line and the [State Center debacle](http://baltimorefishbowl.com/stories/1-5-billion-redevelopment-plan-canceled-state-center-studied-arena/), all but killed the Purple Line, and wants to [build even more roads](https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2017/09/a-9-billion-highway-that-promises-to-pay-for-itself/541119/). I'll go ahead and add on the [Potomac Pipleline](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/public-hearing-tuesday-on-natural-gas-pipeline-that-would-cross-the-potomac/2017/12/18/9c3e6a42-e419-11e7-833f-155031558ff4_story.html?utm_term=.ef9d77ac0c16) as well.\n\nI'm also a bit put off by the fact that Hogan still enjoys a high approval rating and that his top democratic challengers aren't hitting him particularly hard over issues like these, but maybe that's just because I'm the type of guy to hang around places like here and city subreddits.\n\nI'm not advocating for flooding the front page with candidates (that is the #1 purpose of those political subreddits anyway), but I feel it would be a nice addition if we dedicated some focus to candidates dealing with urban-related issues.",

Very well explained and demonstrated (showed how design affected pedestrian traffic, how some places were better for socializing due to sitting places, etc.) anyone know what I'm searching for? 90% sure it was on Vimeo.\n\nAlso, any other recommendations are welcome.\n\nIn exchange, [here's a YT Playlist of a very cool 23 part documentary series about architecture.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyhrMZB-WLo&amp;list=PLABA0239EA68C47B6&amp;index=1) \n\nThank you for your time.",

My practice is mostly insurance litigation but I've long had a huge fascination in municipal law and the legal structures of local governments... whenever we get real estate or commercial work that interfaces with local governments, I do my best to get involved.\n\nI'm finding litigation repetitive, though, and am seriously thinking I'd enjoy something more constructive for the long term. \n\nAdditionally, my wife is German and we've talked about moving to Europe. I wouldn't be able to practice there but am open to studying again and finding work in the EU, perhaps Germany. I'm fluent in English and French and working hard to get my German fluent. Plus... I love many of the planning components that have gone into post-war Germany and can imagine it's an exciting place to work.\n\nWith that said, what do people think? What is the schooling like and the career itself? Do you enjoy your work? What are some challenges I'd face, and what are some benefits based on my background? Also, are there any schools in particular, especially in Canada or Western Europe, that you would recommend?",

The only way that a planning decision is allowed to go to court is if there as been some violation in procedure, not substance. \n\nTL;DR: You can't sue someone if you don't like what they want to build.\n\nIn contrast, it seems like in many US states, such as California and Montana, the first choice of anyone who doesn't like some proposed development is to lawyer up and take it to the district court. To me, this seems like a big factor in increasing development costs, because a lawyer is probably a lot more expensive than a planner. ",
