I am taking three courses, and I messed up in my TA duty to some extent due to course pressure and adjusting to a foriegn country, and I do consider myself responsible. Everytime I messed up, I tried to make up for that by doing some alternative work. \nRecently my department sent me a notice that they will put me in academic probation if I don't do well for the rest of the semester in TA duty (I agree that I messed up, but it was not really the case that I was not doing anything or was doing a bad job, I did everything that was asked, later if not immediately). Also my grades till now happen to be very good, pretty much every class I am taking I am one of the top three and those courses were difficult even at grad level. After that mail, I kind of broke down and think I did make a mistake by choosing this unforgiving department. They are being highly inconsiderate and used terms that are very rude. They told me to \"recover\" as if there was a problem in me in the first place and think the enormous amount of work on a first year is not the problem. Again, I know I am to be blamed because that's what I signed up for, but it hurts because it's not that I have been enjoying my time partying or anything, I even worked during every weekend. I don't know how to deal with this.",

        "text": "So I am from the UK. My PhD was in mathematical physics, I now work in the USA.\n\nI've been lucky and unlucky in academia after I graduated nearly 10 years ago. \n\nMy first postdoc was in Germany. We had a project for 18 months, then we wanted funding to expand this idea for 2-3 more years. We published work and it was good work, but part 2 wasn't accepted. I ended up having to leave that country.\n\nMy next postdoc in the USA. It was for 3 years but my final years salary was \"taken\" by the department to pay for someone else's salary. So I ended up only do 2 of my 3 years.\n\nNow I'm a research scientist, at a different place in the USA. Been here nearly 3 years. I've written two proposals, one HR didn't submit in time (they did it 2 months after the deadline) and the other wasn't submitted because \"this would be competition with our American scientists, so we can't allow it to be submitted\" (literal quote). I also asked if they have spare funding etc, they said \"we do but only for Americans\". I am guessing that's not xenophobia, it's probably to do with the funding call, it might be Americans only or something.\n\nI've been lucky in the way I've done some great research, met some good people and travelled... but I've been really unlucky with how things end. If funding ends, you pretty much have to just go. That's so depressing. \n\nSo now, I have a job offer in Korea. It's for 7 or so years so it's quite secure, but it just means I will be looking for a job again at 45 years old. It would be nice to be financially stable at 45 and have my own home in a place I can be forever... but academia seems to be the opposite of that unless you are lucky. Side note, relationships like this are horrible. You meet someone, don't find funding, get deported and break up... I've been with my gf for 3years, academia doesn't help us here.\n\nThe point of my post isn't just for me. I know what I need to do in general and I've been unlucky. I do want to know how other people feel about security in academia (in all aspects)? How do you try and make it more secure giving the crappy system? I am hoping this post can also be helpful to students who might want to stay in academia too.\n\nThanks :)",

For most of them it's their first weeks at the university, the aim of the class is to help them start their university life and teach them some basics of the field; we also have quite friendly relations and have enough time to chat in class about university in general. We also covered plagiarism and intellectual properly.\n\nLast week I gave them a rather simple homework which most of the class failed in extremely creative ways, their answers really flabbergasted me :). We will cover that material step by step in class tomorrow morning once again, but I also got one plagiarized homework. One of the most ambitious students in my class sent their homework a week ago, and some days later I got that very same homework – with very lazy minor changes – from a student who was very quiet in class (they're one of very few not native speakers in my class and clearly a shy person).\n\nI decided not to report it to the person supervising my class (even though it's in the rules) – my university treats plagiarism extremely severely (as it should of course), but I really want to give the student a second chance. Instead I decided to call both of them out in class, criticize them in a calm manner and use this chance to remind entire class that this is a very serious transgression of university rules.\n\nDo you have any advice on handling that situation? I must say I feel quite anxious about it all.  \nThanks!",

This week, he straight up lied to me - he presented a problem that he claimed not to know the answer to and told me to work on it for a week, and then when I showed him what I had after this week he revealed that he actually did know the answer, and got frustrated (again) that I couldn't come up with it on my own in a week. He'll ask me to stop him if I have questions, but when I do he's unhelpful and dismissive, claims my questions are too basic and usually questions whether or not I'm capable of doing a PhD. I actually started crying during our most recent meeting after some of his comments and had to turn off my Zoom camera because I didn't want to show myself crying to him. I have an appointment with the ombuds office next week but that's more of a means to generate a paper trail than anything.\n\nThis is a far cry from the extremely strong and productive (multiple publications) working relationship I had with my MS advisor, and I cannot see myself continuing with my PhD mentor into an advisorship. In all honesty, I'm rethinking the branch of CS I want to go into *entirely* after this experience, given that this guy effectively rules the roost on my current subfield at this university.\n\nI guess I'm not sure of the following:\n- How do I gracefully switch advisors? There is another professor who I have been in correspondence to begin a project with and I would much much rather have him as my advisor than my current one (he's a lot more reasonable in his week to week expectations)\n- More generally, if I've been admitted to the CS PhD program and my background, papers, and MS thesis are primarily in subfield X, would it be a major mistake to push to switch to subfield Y (which is still CS but quite a bit different) if I find it much more interesting and relevant? My reasoning being that I only have limited exposure to Y via seminar courses and papers in the like.\n\nAny advice would be helpful, I would like to continue in academia but not if every weekly meeting is gonna end with me staring at the museum across the street wondering if I should've been an artist instead because then I'd be poor and fulfilled instead of poor and dejected.

How can I reconnect with a learning-focused community, either online or at my university?\n\nI work as staff (I work in marketing) at my alma mater in the southern U.S. I desperately miss being part of a learning community. As an undergrad, I loved learning alongside others, being part of discussions, writing papers, etc. Now that I've graduated, I feel so cut off. My university is primarily undergrad, and I'm 27, so I don't feel extremely comfortable becoming friends with 20-year-olds living in dorms. Meanwhile, while I'm dating a professor, he's 15 years older, and we usually hang out with my friends and his graduate students when we host parties (because he's kind of young at heart and an oddball). We occasionally hang out with his professor friends, but I don't feel extremely comfortable because I'm so much younger. So I'm caught between being too old for the students here and being too young to be genuine friends with the professors. As for grad students here, the university offers few grad programs, and most of them are professional-oriented (my boyfriend teaches future school principals, for instance, not researchers). \n\nI just feel like I miss having conversations with my peers and sometimes professors about humanities subjects, like philosophy or language or sociology. I miss collaboration. I've applied to get a Higher Ed Admin degree here, but that's professional, and while I'll have the chance to do some research, I think my classmates will be focused more so on their current or future careers as administrators rather than the theory of it all, which is my primary interest. What am I to do? \n\nThanks for any and all advice!",

This means that it was written without me and that I don't know any of the \"diplomatic\" stuff that is generally discussed during grant writing. Including how partners where selected.\n \nMy task would be to learn a completely new topic for me (which no one in my group knows) and then act as a bridge between what our institution does (topic I know) and what a certain partner does (completely unknown field to us).\n\nI actually moved for 2 months to the partner institutions and the more I work with them less I think of this. Most days there isn't anyone in the office (we're paying a fortune out of project money for this foreign travel so that I can \"interact continously with the experts\").  But I have understood that this is this nation's culture so whatever... Then I've asked multiple times who I can talk to to understand why in the literature sometimes people do X and sometimes they do Y. And I haven't received an answer. Apparently there's no person with experience in this topic.\n\nI've looked at scopus and the PI of the lab (55 yo full professor) has the same h-factor as me (tenure track 35 yo)...But maybe it's just because we work in different fields. \nTheir flagship research product, which is what they pushed forward a lot as fundamental to the project, was introduced in a 2018 paper that has 4 citations now. Another popular (yet different) approach used in the same field that I stumbled upon has &gt;3k citations.\n\nAll of this smells a lot to me of people just pretending, without knowing at all what they're doing. However I understand that things might be different, especially because I don't have any idea of this specific sub-field (I'm starting now). \n\nSo... How should I approach this? How do I understand if they're experienced or not? I don't want to report back to my home university and say \"this is a huuuuuge disappointment\" just because of misunderstandings. But I also don't want to give them a free pass if they're just bullshitting (if it's indeed the case)",

In a really exciting turn of events, I just came across an open call for book-chapter proposals connected to a topic I've had on my \"would love to write about this someday\" list for a while. They are \"only\" asking for an abstract and a resume or cv so I don't think there's much to lose even though the idea of a book chapter seems much more intense than an article. \n\nThe issue is that I'm not sure if I'm better off rewriting my resume to be more tailored toward academia or preparing my first academic CV. The call says they'd accept either and no preference is indicated. I intend to get a Ph.D. eventually, but for now, I'm a recent MA grad with exactly one thing to list for many of the major CV sections. This includes:\n\n* One article that I will submit to a journal before this proposal is due — it just needs a final copy edit. I saw on this sub that some people list these as \"under review\" or something like that. This is an edited/improved version of something I wrote during my MA and is very related to the topic of the book-chapter proposal.\n* One competitive grant for independent research ($10K, with one partner) during undergrad. Kinda related to the book topic, but less so.\n* A conference presentation (that we had to apply for) and a poster presentation (required for the grant) for the above research.\n* One formal research assistantship in undergrad. Completely unrelated to this topic. \n\nOther possibly relevant info: \n\n* I did my MA in the UK (long story), but I'm an American citizen and my BA was in the States as is the editor of the book.\n* On paper, my academic affiliation is \"Most Relevant Department, Top 3 American University\" but the reality is that I am a coordinator for a lab that is not really related to the book topic.\n* There are two unpublished research projects that I have on my regular resume as they tend to be conversation starters and one of them is extremely relevant to this topic.\n* The majority of my work experience is education-adjacent. I'm currently in my non-research role at the lat and before grad school, I was teaching high schoolers in a non-profit context\n\nI could put together a CV but it would be pretty thin since I only have only one of each thing and no appointments or confirmed publications. Would it be better to just send a good resume and be done? \n\nApologies that this post is *so long* and thanks in advance for any advice you have!",

I've been unhappy since my first year because of my advisor and the way things turned out. I'm 1.5 year into my PhD so far and I have no research or publications to show. It's mostly because I went into a really bad depression in my first year and was basically non-functional. I'm starting to get better now but I feel behind in my program now. My advisor told me to find a new advisor or to master out. So I've been thinking about both of these options. I like the work of another professor and he has agreed to advise me on a project next semester, and if it goes well, he would take me as his PhD student. But it's still uncertain and will depend on how the project goes. Also, since I've no publications so far, I guess I'll have to work even harder from here which might bring additional stress and affect my mental health.\n\nThe other option is taking a master's and leaving the program. In this case, I'll have to start preparing for the software engineering jobs as I don't have industry exposure because I joined the PhD program straight from the undergrad. But if I get a job, I think I'll be happier and it will be less stressful overall. I can even try giving one more shot at PhD after working for a couple of years.\n\nSo I'm really confused if I should start the project with a new professor and see how things go or if I should just master out and find a job. I'm thinking I might get back on track and have a successful PhD if the project works out but I've no idea how stressful the program might get in later stages. But I also don't wanna be in a position where I regret dropping out. For those who were in a similar situation as me, I'd love to hear your thoughts!",

The problem is, they will all want the letter to say that they are exceptional/outstanding/etc, and most of them aren't. If a student is performing ok, but I won't have anything laudatory to say in their letter, do I have an obligation to tell them that and/or release them from the lab?",
