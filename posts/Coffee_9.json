        "text": "Hey folks - I have obviously submitted this to Fellow support too. My new Gen 2 Ode was just delivered today. The magnets in the catch cup and grinder base are installed incorrectly. Basically, instead of getting that satisfying ‚Äúsnap‚Äù into place, the catch cup gets pushed around in a circle around the base magnet when I attempt to align the magnets. This also, unfortunately, results in the catch cup moving around while the machine is grinding. This obviously makes a mess. Grinding with the catch cup lid off helps but obviously this is not a premium UX with what should be a premium product. \n\nHas anyone else had this experience? I can‚Äôt see a way to uninstall either magnet without potentially damaging the base or the catch cup. I also wonder whether a new catch cup would resolve the issue - if the incorrectly installed magnet is the one in the base, I‚Äôd be having the same outcome.  \n\nAny thoughts? Thanks!",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/11egnao/is_it_justifiable_to_talk_to_a_roaster_because/",
        "text": "Hi all, I'm still relatively new to specialty coffee as a hobby, although I have certainly tumbled head-first into it. I've bought quite a few beans, experimented with what I liked, and given away those I haven't. So although I don't have a wealth of experience in terms of time in the hobby, I have put in orders from 6 different roasters now, and each time I've always received the beans within one week of their being roasted, usually 3-4 days (with all orders being online, through the post/mail).\n\nMost recently I ordered from a new, well-regarded roaster, with the reason for the order being that they had some pure gesha beans in. I thought it would be a nice experience to try, and the cupping score was the highest I've seen by some distance, so I paid the premium compared to other coffees I've ordered (¬£18 for 150 g). I was however disappointed when the beans arrived today to see they were roasted on 10th Feb, which is 18 days ago. \n\nI understand that being 2.5 weeks old, the beans supposedly are around their peak, although the company has a graph of the Q score over time on their website and shows a slow degradation in score between weeks 2-3 and then quite a sharp fall-off in the third week onwards. I have made one cup with the beans today and was disappointed with them - they didn't seem to have the complexity or depth of flavour that was advertised, and were overall quite mediocre for me - but that is a) purely subjective and b) only my first impression, and I know I need to make more cups and try a variety of brew methods before reaching a final verdict.\n\nI think I'm disappointed due to a combination of the premium I paid compared to other coffees I've had so far, the disappointing flavour, and the fact these beans are substantially older than anything I've received from any other online roaster. I was wondering if I am within my rights to feel disappointed, and to mention this to the roaster. If it was just the price and quality that was disappointing, I don't think I'd say anything, but the roast date does compound the issue in my mind.\n\nI will say that I ordered two beans in the order, and the other (substantially cheaper) ones are very good (and were roasted 4 days ago, in line with my expectations), so I'd make sure the roaster knows I'm pleased on that front. The question really is if there's any point mentioning that I'm disappointed in receiving 18 day old beans which they themselves point out may already be past their very best, when their assurance on their website is to always send beans from their latest batch (which could well be the case here, I just assumed they would roast more frequently than every 3 weeks).",

Think of this as an AUA directed at the back room of the coffee industry.\n\nThis may be especially pertinent if you wonder what impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the industry (hint: not a good one). Remember to keep supporting your favorite coffee businesses if you can - check out the weekly deal thread and the coffee bean thread if you're looking for new places to purchase beans from.\n\nIndustry folk, feel free to answer any questions that you feel pertain to you! However, please let others ask questions; do not comment just to post \"I am _______, AMA!‚Äù Also, please make sure you have your industry flair before posting here. If you do not yet have it, contact the mods.\n\nWhile you're encouraged to tie your business to whatever smart or charming things you say here, this isn't an advertising thread. Replies that place more effort toward promotion than answering the question will be removed.\n\nPlease keep this thread limited to industry-focused questions. While it seems tempting to ask general coffee questions here to get extra special advice from \"the experts,\" that is not the purpose of this thread, and you won't necessarily get superior advice here. For more general coffee questions, e.g. brew methods, gear recommendations for home brewing, etc, please ask in the daily Question Thread.",

My exams are horrible and I'm almost always required to pull all nighters. \n\nI've tried coffee from everywhere, but I never liked it. Now, when I'm pulling all nighters, I need some caffeine to keep me up. That's where the coffee comes in, I buy a sachet of nescafe's coffee and a small pouch of sugar. my flat does not have a drinking water supply which is why I take water in bottles to my flat. My family likes to think that I sleep at 12:00 a.m. which is why they don't know that I am pulling all nighters. I never tell them about it and I have to hide it. I boil the appropriate amount of water and while it is boiling I put my coffee and sugar in an empty bottle. I pour the boiling water in my bottle and shake it hard to mix. I let this cool and then drink it. you may ask why I don't go for energy drinks, it's because they are expensive. I told this to my friend who said that coffee enthusiasts would love this. that's when I remembered that Reddit has a lot of coffee enthusiasts. I hope this is the best subreddit to torture.\n\nwhat are your opinions on this",

The physical part is the worst, heart palpitations and shakyyy and if I have it after 2pm I probably won't sleep a wink. This is seriously after like, half a cup, and it lasts for HOURS. Makes my thoughts run pretty wild too, hard to focus or concentrate on anything cus they're whipping around so fast. \n\nI am obviously prone to being anxious and flighty, I think it's just my physiology. I'm pretty well otherwise, and eat healthy and exercise. But it never used to be a problem!! I try decaf which is a little better but seems to make me grumpy for some reason. \n\nI know the effect coffee has on the body so I know why it happens. Although I haven't met many who seem to have such an extreme reaction. I've tried so many suggestions for things to try so this is my last attempt to see if anyone has any personal redemption stories. It's just my favorite flavour in the world and I either miss it like crazy or have a miserable time when I do drink it after the first fun 30 minutes have worn off.

Over the past few weeks I've learned that I would like to place more attention and care into coffee drinking. \n\nThat said, all I have is a Kuerig and I'd like to eventually get to a place where I'm roasting my own beans, making my own espressos, etc. \n\nI've found this kit from a vlogger I used to watch who has gotten into coffee, but I'm not sure if it's a good deal or not. The kit is $120 and comes with:\n\nTimemore French Press (450ml)\nTimemore Manual Grinder ( I *think* it's the C2)\n3 different bags of beans (250g each)\n\nIs this a good deal? I've also thought about purchasing an Aeropress.",
