The security rules are very strict so we cannot leave the compound. Therefore, the only social interaction we have is with each other. \n\nThere are about 7 Francophone people in the team but they all speak perfectly good English. However, they immediately switch to French when a fellow Francophone is around. I have to admit this is mostly prominent in the people from France, and less so in people from Congo, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. The 3 French people in the team always speak French to each other and other Francophones, even when we are all eating at the same table, or we are playing cards with each other, or casually conversing. I don't know if they also do it during work because we are not in the same department so let's focus on the social aspect. Even if they do it during work, the line is clear and I can talk to HR about it, because then it would be unprofessional.\n\nHow do I deal with it during our social activities? My favourite friends in this mission are not Francophones, but when these 3 people start doing this, it affects me a lot. I find it rude, exclusive, inconsiderate, distasteful, and borderline disrespectful. Imagine playing cards with 5 people and they only address you in English to tell you \"it's your turn\" and then switch to French and giggle without including you. \n\nI understand that speaking ones native tongue makes them feel at home. However, been excluded like this makes me feel twice as homesick and twice as upset. They can always talk to each other in their own language when they are alone. But when we are 15 expats in a foreign land trying to socialise with each other, it's damaging for team life! \n\nAm I overthinking and exaggerating? Maybe. We are all tired here after all. But the feeling of exclusion is legit. I have already communicated to them that I don't like it. They didn't change anything. Which now makes me even angrier. Other non-francophone colleagues are divided. Some don't mind it, some do. But I think it affects me a lot more than everyone else. \n\nSo far I have decided not to hang out with them when they start speaking in French. I just get up and leave many times. But being alone here is tough! You need social interaction to survive in a humanitarian mission. Otherwise you will burn out. \n\nWhat can I do? Please help! üò©",

And me not having any other friends, I just started to feel left out and jealous, and I was messaging her quite often asking to hang out or if Im the reason we don't talk like we used to. \nThen some time later I decided that it would be a great idea to tell her how I feel left out, and since then everything went downhill. We had fight because of that then she also talked about some other stuff that I was doing and she didn't liked (I don't really want to talk about it here, but I know I was the one who was wrong and know how annoying I was when I was doing that). After that we haven't talked, I was trying to reach out to her so I could apologize but I ended up being blocked.\n\nFew months later I was finally able to contact her and tell her that Im sorry for everything I did, she was kind of confused since I just came out of nowhere but from my point of view it seemed like she wasn't mad at me anymore. I think like 2 months after that she messaged me and we talked about stuff like if nothing happened before and I was really happy but also confused. After that I sent her a message asking her if she would like to be friends again. The massage still shows \"sent\" but few days after I sent the message she messaged me again and we talked again and we even follow eachother on social media again. I tried to start a conversation too but it didn't last long it was only two replies, and I really don't know what to do and if this means that she wants to be friends again or not.

        "text": "I'm 24F and I've always been the type to keep to myself. When I was growing up I changed my personality to be more animated and I was miserable. When I met new people, I felt this irrational pressure to be an interesting person as to not bore them. I would overthink so much that i would be in a constant anxious state. As I've grown older, I've become comfortable being my boring old self üòÜ. Many people suck, honestlyüòÇ a lot of people I met are hypocrites, condescending, talk shit behind your back, they just want a new gossip topic and they could care less about your well-being. I've experienced cliques most of my life and they've left a bad taste in my mouth about socializing. Though I do acknowledge there are good people out there, I don't feel the need to invest my energy to socializing. I don't wanna be forced to socialize because it's always a gamble on whether the people you talk to are ones you vibe with. If they suck, I've wasted my energy I would feel like shit, why would I do that shit to myself when life is already depressing enough. However, my parents and siblings are worried that I only have 1 friend I constantly talk to. (I do also have 3 friends from university that I talk to once in a while. I fell out of touch with my college friends because I was having a really hard time in university and I just couldn't move past the shame I felt to contact them because they've been graduating and finding jobs whereas graduating alone was tough for me.)\n\nI guess I don't really understand why me being antisocial would be that worrying to them? I do understand its their way of caring and that it comes from a good place but the way they say it makes me upset for some reason. They talk about it like I'm the black sheep of the family, like there's something wrong with me and that I'm being lazy for not changing the way I am. I've seen my family bitch about their friends and coworkers all the time, just listening to it makes me stressed, imagine being the party involved ughhh *shivers* . Besides, what's wrong with limiting my exposure to socializing (an activity that i often want to end as soon as possible)? To me, its an act of self-preservation, to protect myself from being hurt or stressed. I'm already going to be stressed from other things like work, paying bills, surviving on my own, etc, why add to it? I don't even feel safe confiding my problems and worries to my family, let alone random people I meet.\n\nI don't want to put myself out there because in my pov, the cons outweigh the pros. If I do happen to meet a good apple that becomes lifelong friend, that's great! I would welcome it. But I don't want to seek it out because interactions like that feel more \"forced\" than natural to me and I would rather do things that actually make me happy and not make me want to run away. I don't know. Just my two centsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",

But things have been continually rougher over the last many years as I feel like I've been taken for granted. I don't get my calls or texts returned for long periods of time, and I just haven't felt like an effort has been made in a long time. But meanwhile I've still been called the best friend the whole time.\n\nI'm not completely without fault here. I have been a bit insensitive at the darker times in my life, but I feel like I've made a big effort to change. She hasn't tho. And it's been a long time since we started talking about these problems openly.\n\nI'm omitting a lot here for the sake of brevity, because it's all besides the point, which is this: I don't know what to do.\n\nI've tried fixing things and that just doesn't work since she won't put in the work. I've tried having a more casual friendship but even that she won't hardly engage with. Signs point to that I should end the friendship, but when I try it always leads to a big sad drama and I end up trying to give her another chance. Meanwhile, I crave closure, so I can't seem to just let us drift apart naturally. She's been such a huge part of my life for so long.\n\nI realize there's no easy option for me but idk. Nothing seems doable.\n\nI need advice.",

        "text": "I‚Äôve been at this place for 5 years and barely say anything to anyone. I had a change-up with how my job is done so there is this woman whose desk I have to go to to pickup paperwork from. \n\nThe other day I was getting some papers and I had my earbuds in. She asked me what I was listening to, and I told her ‚ÄúMegadeth‚Äù. Which is abnormal for me to say. Like‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt stress how much I panic when someone asks me something. Normally I would have flinched and said something like ‚Äúuh‚Ä¶just‚Ä¶music‚Äù. \n\nBut here I was just outright saying it. She was like ‚Äúreally??‚Äù And made some comments about how she didn‚Äôt expect me to be a metal fan. \n\nAgain today she brought it up saying ‚ÄúYeah, I just still can‚Äôt get over the fact you like metal haha‚Äù. And I managed to follow that up with saying I‚Äôve been a big fan since high school. Again, I wouldn‚Äôt normally be able to do this but today I was somehow. She mentioned she had a pantera phase when she was younger. \n\nA guy came up while I was still getting papers and told her that he had gotten the ‚Äústrap‚Äù she needed. I‚Äôm typing of course but I‚Äôll try to capture exactly how I speak because I do these awkward pauses in order to take a second to think. When he left I said ‚ÄúHeh‚Ä¶I uh‚Ä¶thought he said‚Ä¶he had a ‚Äòstrat‚Äô for you‚Ä¶like you were getting a guitar‚Äù. \n\nI cringe. But she laughed. She made a comment like ‚ÄúThat would be awesome but I wouldn‚Äôt be able to play a lick‚Äù \n\nNow‚Ä¶this is where I start stressing. Trying to imply that I am bad at guitar I say ‚ÄúHeh‚Ä¶yeah. I think‚Ä¶trying to watch me keep rhythm is‚Ä¶entertainment in itself‚Äù. \n\nShe looks at me. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶say that again?‚Äù So I do. I think she *kinda* got it, paused for a while and said ‚Äúso I guess we shouldn‚Äôt ask you to dance? Lol‚Äù I laughed and said ‚ÄúYeah probably not‚Äù. \n\nI don‚Äôt know why that bothers me so damn much. Know that in the 5 years I‚Äôve been there, that is the most open I‚Äôve ever been with someone there. \n\nI saw a post here stressing that sometimes we‚Äôre the problem in situations and we shouldn‚Äôt blame others for how we fail at communicating. I do agree. And Look, I believe there are definitely people who have had a toxic attitude about my silence and I wouldn‚Äôt want to win them over even if I could. But this‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt explain. I just feel like I deserve this person thinking I‚Äôm super weird. \n\nLike‚Ä¶I keep thinking maybe I might have accidentally implied something sexual? That‚Äôs my biggest fear. I didn‚Äôt mean it like that. maybe there was some bit of context that I didn‚Äôt express which made what I said sound like nonsense to her. \n\nI just can‚Äôt get that interaction out of my head and how gross I feel after.",

Last week I practically was insomniac, sleeping two hours in total per night. I finally took my sleeping pills, I couldn't carry anymore without sleep.

I really wanted to go, I still want to, but my shame and whatever the state my mind is in after anxiety attacks called, kinda holds me back.\n\nTo add to this I'm dependent on a coworker to give me a ride there and back, and that friend wasn't responded messages yesterday, so I don't know if it's even still possible to get to that party. \n\nAnd I just sit here, trying to decide what to do and my mind being my mind, looking frantically for an excuse why not going is okay. I'm just confused, and sad. It happens almost everytime something cool takes place.",

He has abused others that I care about, but his family doesn't know that. I don't think they know how much it affected me and I feel like it's part of the reason why I feel so out of place. Because I did not grow up in a loving household, it feels so fucking weird to be around my extended family, who are all very loving people.

        "text": "I was on a cheerleading team last year. I got along with everyone, from what I could tell, but didn't make close friendships with any of them. I did try. There was Girl A, who was in my hotel room at a competition. She and I got talking and she even told me I was one of her favorite people on the team. We got icecream after team awards and she said that she'd come to my vocal recital the next week and expressed that she was excited. However, last minute something came up, she didn't tell me until I texted her, and she never reached out since. \n\nI just recently went to a basketball game to see two of my former teammates perform. One of them knew I was coming. While I was there, before the game started, two of my other former teammates were there. One of them, Girl B, didn't say hi or talk to me, but the other one, Girl C made conversation and we caught up. \n\nNeither of the teammates who I came to see came up to me to say hi. Only one of them waved at me when I waved at her. I know that people might be busy, but I know how the team works. During half time you can go out and say hi to your friends and family. The teammate who didn't wave at me, Girl D, did go out to see her sister. But she took the long way around the outside of the gym, so she didn't cross in front of my section of the bleachers, and she didn't even look at me when she walked past me. The teammate who waved at me, Girl E, also didn't come up to say hi to me. \n\nIt's really confusing because Girl E will comment on my posts, she's said she loves and misses me and thinks I'm a really good person, and she was the one who knew I was coming to the game. Girl D will sometimes reply to my instagram stories, and I in return. \n\nI also saw one of my former teammates, Girl F, in the parking lot. I said hi and waved and she just smiled back and didn't really say hi. She also had plenty of time to see me and say hi, so that's why I got a bad feeling from it. \n\nTonight I saw Girl B and Girl F were out the other night, and they don't normally hangout. And Girl B and another teammate Girl G have been hanging out and so she might have been there too. \n\nThis just makes me worried that I did something that I don't know I did and people are mad at me. Am I reading into things too much or are my suspicions justified? It just makes me sad because I'd never intentionally hurt someone's feelings and it seems like everyone is hanging out without me. Yet most of them have said they like me.",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've been living like a hermit for a very long time and am trying to make a solid attempt at building a social network and friends but I can't even seem to hold conversations with strangers (see examples)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. There was this one girl at my skating rink today that kept staring at me while I was practising some turns. I asked her once about a cool move she was doing a few months ago and this was the 2nd time I saw her. I thought maybe she was trying to figure out why I looked familiar so I went to say \"hey - do you still remember me\" as it had been some time and she said yes while continuing to skate backwards so I left her alone. \n2. I went to a social meet-up and got seated next to a random girl on my left. There was no one in front of me or to the right yet as people were still coming in so I tried to talk to her. I noticed from the start that her body was titled away from me to her left. I tried to make some small talk by asking how long she'd been a part of the meet-up etc... The minute another convo started (to her left) she tiled to the left and stayed like that. It was literally 30 seconds and I felt like I'd already scared someone off.\n3. A coworker (Alex) introduced me to one of his friends (Bob) who was joining our team 3 years ago. Alex left the team and got married during the pandemic (not really known in the organization). Bob is still in our team so I tried to catch up once we all returned to the office for the first time in 3 years by asking how Alex (they're BFFs) were doing and all he said was \"great\". It's really hard to engage with such short responses.\n4. I go to boardgame meet-ups and people don't even take a minute to ask me what my name is and just refer to me as \"him\" the entire night. I feel so invisible and worthless. \n\nI genuinely believe people are good and nice in the world and want to make friends but I can't seem to break through and feel like I've done something wrong in my past life and am earning these crappy experiences as karma. I know that is unrealistic but what would you do in my case?",

There is a subreddit about it if you want to learn more. \n\nI saw her over the holiday break (late December) and we talked a lot about my condition. I felt more understood than I have in the rest of my life. She was telling me about a device for it and that she'd text me with information about it. Hyperacusis is an *incredibly* rare disorder and most audiologists know very little about it, so I was very excited to learn about this. About a week after I saw her, her dog died. She texted me to say she was sorry she hadn't gotten the info to me yet, but that she would soon. This was mid January. It is now March. I know she is very busy, but I need her help. How do I politely reach out to ask for the info? Or is it still too early?",

I have changed jobs several times and without fail, at every job, I get left out of office friendships. Let me explain: people are friendly to me at work but I'm never anybody's \"friend\". Nobody is particularly mean to me or anything but I see \" work besties\" and friend groups forming at work that don't include me. \n\nI've noticed some new issues at my current job that I have never experienced at any other place, which made me want to make this Reddit post: \n\nMy coworkers make plans to hang out in front of me, they talk in code words or walk out of the room when they want to talk about their personal lives. I see on social media that they hang out outside of work but not a single person asked me to go with them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBackground**:**\n\n I'm a 22 yo masculine presenting gay woman. I am a little introverted but I still enjoy a healthy dose of social interactions.  I don't think I'm unpleasant to be around. I'm not the funniest person in the room but I can make decent/average conversations. I've never had anyone point out anything negative about my social skills ( at least not to my face or in an obvious way). People are usually friendly to me and I don't sense any hostility from most people I interact with. I make an effort to initiate conversations with people at work.  I shower and wear clean clothes. My mouth doesn't smell. Average looking...  \nbefore anyone jumps to conclusions, My coworkers aren't homophobic or anything like that.  This is not me playing the gay card.\n\n**I have noticed a pattern of getting left out of office friendships at every single place I work at. So I figured this is a me problem that needs to be addressed. I'm asking you to help me improve my social skills.**",

Same things happen in 1 on 1 conversations, but here I can also never think of anything to add or to ask. \nI'm not shy or awkward I think, I used to be an open kid, but there's just nothing going through my head, it's empty in those moments.\n\nYet when I talk with close friends, like my brother or best friend, I have no trouble. I can be witty and make jokes, tell stories and actually be funny. It seems like my brain is faster and is in the moment.\n\nAnyone else experiences this and are there any practical fixes?",

For example, giving **one-word answers** and not asking you questions.\n\nOr, they may use **‚Äúexit statements**‚Äù such as:  \n\n‚ÄúWell anyways‚Ä¶‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúWe should talk soon‚Ä¶‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúI just really have to finish this..‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I have to take this phone call/text‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIt was great to talk to you‚Ä¶‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúI should really get back to work on this‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Body Language**\n\nIf they have unengaged body language the conversation should probably end.\n\nBasically, they will do something else while talking to you, to show their mind is elsewhere at the moment. They may constantly look away and check their phone. Shift their legs to prepare for departure or physically start backing away. Especially the positioning of their feet. If their feet are pointed away from you, it may also be a sign they want to leave the conversation. We can usually gather from these hints that it‚Äôs time to end the conversation.",
