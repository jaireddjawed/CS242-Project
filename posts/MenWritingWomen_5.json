I mostly do contract work, and right now I‚Äôm working on an NFT game (I do not support NFTs, I do not support this game, but they pay me well, money is money). They have me write backstories and dialogue for characters that their artists come up with, which is generally a pretty easy gig. \n\nWhenever I write a woman, I consult my wife to make sure it‚Äôs all good, and I always, always think, ‚ÄúWhat would r/menwritingwomen think of this?‚Äù before finishing anything. I have never once written any line describing a woman‚Äôs breasts, legs, or ass (I‚Äôve never written anything erotic), though I have described arms being muscular, sew me.\n\nAnyways I‚Äôm writing the backstory of this new character, and I thought I got her down pretty good. From a failing noble house, she wants to save her family, now she‚Äôs threatened with assassination attempts because in the process of saving her family‚Äôs status she ruined the status of others‚Äô. I also described her as a bit of a flirt.\n\nI submit all of this to my boss. And in response he sends me a video of the male gaze of women in media. Tells me I should follow what it says in the video. And the video‚Ä¶ praises *Belle Delphine* as the prime example of the modern male gaze of women. So‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt base her on Belle Delphine. Just gave her an obsession with guns to satisfy my boss‚Äôs ‚Äúone of the boys‚Äù request.\n\nI‚Äôll update you on what he says.",

        "text": "Overheard a church sermon recently about how two sinful daughters seduced their father, Lot. I thought about how often r*pists and sexual predators twist a narrative to claim that the victim wanted it and realized the Bible is classic [men writing women](https://www.bibleref.com/Genesis/19/Genesis-chapter-19.html).\n\nFor starters, when their father, Lot is approached by angels intent on destroying his city, Lot so graciously offers up his daughters in exchange for the safety of his men:\n\n&gt;Look, I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do what you like with them. But don't do anything to these men, for they have come under the protection of my roof\n\nAfter their city is destroyed, Lot and his daughters move into a cave. \n\n&gt; He and his two daughters lived in a cave.  One day the older daughter said to the younger, 'Our father is old, and there is no man around here to give us children--as is the custom all over the earth. Let's get our father to drink wine and then sleep with him and preserve our family line through our father.'\n&gt; \n&gt; That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and slept with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up. The next day the older daughter said to the younger, 'Last night I slept with my father. Let's get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and sleep with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.' \n&gt; \n&gt; So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.\n&gt; \n&gt; So both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father. The younger daughter also had a son.\n\nThis Biblical tale was written to cover-up Lot's r*pe of his daughters while placing the blame on the girls. I'm sure there is more revising history in the Bible to cover horrible acts against girls and women, but this one stuck out to me because when I heard it I knew the girls would've had a very different side of the story.",
