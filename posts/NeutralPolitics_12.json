        "text": "[As it stands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution_by_region), most of the west handles prostitution with some degree of prohibition or criminalization, whether it be on purchasers, sex workers, related acts (running a brothel, pimping, etc.), or all three. While some nations like the Netherlands and Germany have fully legalized the industry, restriction is still the status quo.\n\nAssociated with this issue are a wide array of problems and questions, such as human trafficking, the role of the state, the morality of the act of prostitution itself, the freedom and health of women involved, and so on. Many support full legalization, for reasons that typically include minimizing harm, promoting health and safety, and eliminating non-violent/victimless crimes ([example](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-raphael/legalize-prostitution_1_b_4251956.html)). Others support continued criminalization or restriction on the basis of traditional moral rejection of prostitution. Other still support continued criminalization for buyers because they view the industry and inherently predatory and abusive, and fear legalization would expand it and increase instances of things like sex trafficking ([example](https://nordicmodelnow.org)).\n\nHow should prostitution be handled in the west?",

The United States is special in that it also claims [foreign income](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-current-system-international-taxation-work) as taxable, but only when the profits are repatriated to the USA. This creates a stronger incentive to invest in foreign countries.\n\nLarge multinationals have developed convoluted structures to avoid paying taxes on foreign profits, like the well-publicized [Double Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement), where a set of nested sub-corporations across USA, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Bermuda pay royalties on intellectual property to each other. This allows the overall entity a legal means of avoiding a large amount of taxation.\n\nOne proposed measure in Europe is add a ~3% [gross revenue tax](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/threat-to-irish-tax-take-from-eu-proposal-to-levy-digital-giants-1.3426071) on tech companies (which are most able to cheaply move around intangible assets). This is much less manipulable, but a gross revenue tax kills low-margin businesses and arbitrarily incentivizes vertical integration.\n\nIs there a corporate tax policy that could be uniformly adopted by all countries to disincentivize tax havens and bizarre corporate structures, while still ensuring that countries get a reasonable source of tax from activity that reasonably happens within their borders?",

        "text": "[Bloomberg's original story](https://biglawbusiness.com/homeland-security-to-compile-database-of-journalists-bloggers/):\n\n&gt; The U.S. Department of Homeland Security wants to monitor hundreds of thousands of news sources around the world and compile a database of journalists, editors, foreign correspondents, and bloggers to identify top “media influencers.”\n\n&gt; It’s seeking a contractor that can help it monitor traditional news sources as well as social media and identify “any and all” coverage related to the agency or a particular event, according to a request for information released April 3.\n\n&gt; The data to be collected includes a publication’s “sentiment” as well as geographical spread, top posters, languages, momentum, and circulation. No value for the contract was disclosed.\n\n&gt; “Services shall provide media comparison tools, design and rebranding tools, communication tools, and the ability to identify top media influencers,” according to the statement. DHS agencies have “a critical need to incorporate these functions into their programs in order to better reach federal, state, local, tribal, and private partners,” it said.\n\n&gt; The DHS wants to track more than 290,000 global news sources, including online, print, broadcast, cable, and radio, as well as trade and industry publications, local, national and international outlets, and social media, according to the documents. It also wants the ability to track media coverage in more than 100 languages including Arabic, Chinese, and Russian, with instant translation of articles into English.\n\n&gt; The request comes amid heightened concern about accuracy in media and the potential for foreigners to influence U.S. elections and policy through “fake news.” Nineteen lawmakers including Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions last month, asking whether Qatar-based Al Jazeera should register as a foreign agent because it “often directly undermines” U.S. interests with favorable coverage of Hamas, Hezbollah and al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria.\n\n&gt; The DHS request says the selected vendor will set up an online “media influence database” giving users the ability to browse based on location, beat, and type of influence. For each influencer found, “present contact details and any other information that could be relevant, including publications this influencer writes for, and an overview of the previous coverage published by the media influencer.”\n\nI haven't found who the \"users\" referred to in the last paragraph would be.\n\n[The DHS Press Secretary tweeted](https://twitter.com/SpoxDHS/status/982372727309963264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw):\n\n&gt; Despite what some reporters may suggest, this is nothing more than the standard practice of monitoring current events in the media. Any suggestion otherwise is fit for tin foil hat wearing, black helicopter conspiracy theorists.\n\nIs the database new or is it standard? Is this statement accurate?\n\nWhat is the DHS trying to accomplish, how are they trying to accomplish it, and what was the decision making process?\n\nThanks.",

        "text": "10 days after taking office, President Donald Trump signed the executive order \"Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs”.\n\n The four-page document outlined two key changes to current government operations. First, any new regulation an agency enacts must be met with two regulations that will be eliminated. And second, there will be a cap on the cost of new regulations for the federal government, which will be $0 for the fiscal year 2017.([Source)](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/smallbusiness/2017/02/06/trumps-executive-order-limit-regulations-what-means-your-business/97441676/)\n\nHas this had any impact on how regulations are passed or upheld?  Has it had any meaningful change on how government works?",
