But it's starting to grow on me now[.](https://imgur.com/a/42e8xnM.jpg) It's obviously egregiously wrong, but what are your thoughts on it? (\"You\" being the only people I can think of who would even have an opinion lol)\n\nHaving worked as an editor for many years, I know that jobs have been lost over failing to include and punctuation. So seeing it the first few times was unnerving. I talked about it with my Gen Z kids who told me they even go out of their way to make sure they omit the period. It's part of my son's proofreading ritual to delete end punctuation where he inadvertently includes it out of habit\n\nSetting aside for a moment that it's just downright wrong, what do you guys think about it? (Note: I'm assuming it hasn't spilled over into professional writing yet and is still found predominant in social media writing)\n\nWhy do you think it has become so commonplace that it's now more the rule than the exception?",

The second one I am totally confused about this use.\n\nSource material (The blade itself, chapter 1, by Joe Abercrombie)\nLogen plunged through the trees, bare feet slipping and sliding on the wet earth, the slush, the wet pine needles, breath rasping in his chest, blood thumping in his head. He stumbled and spawled on his side, nearly cut his chest open with his axe, lay there panting, peering through the shadowy forest.\n\n\nPart 2\n\nI thought maybe if I tried this it would make more sense. I am not sure if my use is right. If someone could let me know so I can improve that would be great!\n\nMy practice:\nGerald pitched forward running through the alleys, bare feet slapping on the cobblestones, chains rattling with every step. His breath was rasping, his heart was pounding, he knew they would be after him.\n(normally I might write, \"**and** he knew they would be after him\", but that is not how it appears in the second sentence by Joe Abercrombie)",
