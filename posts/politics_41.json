This is a weekly thread posted every Monday, in order to facilitate more discussion on local issues on /r/politics. Since this is intended to be a thread about local politics, top-level comments that are exclusively about national issues will not be allowed. When commenting, please include the state you're living in, and don't forget to link sources. **Also, please actually describe what happened. Things like \"I live in X, you know what happened\", \"Nothing happened\" or \"[Politician] continues to be an idiot\" isn't helpful to users and will be removed.**\n\nIf someone from your state made a news round-up that you think is insufficient, feel free to comment to that round-up with further news stories. Enjoy discussion, and review [our civility guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_please_be_civil) before engaging with others.\n\n---\n\nHi there, /r/politics. Because this thread is about local politics, I'd like to reiterate that **news about President Biden, Donald Trump or any other national political figure is off topic in this thread and will be removed**. Thank you, and have a good week.",
