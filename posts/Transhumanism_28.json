Would you?\n\nI would certainly, without a second thought, replace my flesh and bone arms and legs with cybernetic augmentations that could out-perform my natural equivalents. Hell, I'd even replace some of my organs, like my lungs or my eyes, with synthetic versions if the implants proved to be more efficient and superior to the biological originals. I think the only organs I'd want to keep \"intact\" would be my...errr...genitals...cause even as a cyborg a guy still has needs.\n\nThe only thing that would make me reconsider would be the potential for side-effects like artificial implant/organ/limb rejection or some other negative side-effect caused by the body's immune response.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?
