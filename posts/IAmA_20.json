I am the Director of the Women’s Media Center [Speech Project](http://www.womensmediacenter.com/speech-project/), which is dedicated to raising public and media awareness about online harassment. I also recently appeared in a documentary film about online harassment called [Netizens](https://www.netizensfilm.com/).\n\nMy new book [Rage Becomes Her: The Power of Women’s Anger](https://www.amazon.com/Rage-Becomes-Her-Power-Womens/dp/1501189557/ref=sr_1_1_twi_har_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1538146992&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=rage+becomes+her) explores all of the ways women are forced to resist their rage and how this affects them in many areas of life. Since rage is really the most powerful tool we have, I urge women to embrace their anger and harness it as a tool for lasting personal and societal change.\n\nI’d love to answer any questions about rage, but I also write and speak often about wider issues related gender, media, tech, education, women's rights, sexual violence and free speech.\n\nPlease ask me anything!\n\nProof:\n\n[https://twitter.com/schemaly/status/1045670855638994944](https://twitter.com/schemaly/status/1045670855638994944)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I'm about to sign off.

Trial by fire. That story on the [DailyWorth](https://www.dailyworth.com/posts/4380-helping-my-dad-put-me-in-debt).\n\nAfter that experience I've made it my life's work to leverage business credit so that people don't have to go through what we went through.\n\nI have a new program coming out about building credit in your business name, without your personal guarantee.\n\nI've done my fair share of raising money for a business, so feel free to ask about SBA loans, friends and family rounds, angel investing, VC, private or hard money, structured finance, etc. I also have a deep love of slow money strategies.\n\nI've got a free video course over on [my website](https://wealthgenerationcollective.com/) that will give you custom advice about what to get better personal credit. None of that generic pay your bills on time. Yes, you should pay your bills on time, but that will only give you a 10-20 point jump.  I go over some of the counterintuitive things, like when you should apply for more credit, even right before you get a mortgage.\n\nI'm not a lawyer, so this isn't legal advice. That also means I can tell you things that lawyers sometimes won't. I'm US based, but Canada has similar systems.\n\n**Proof:** [https://www.facebook.com/WealthGenerationCollective/photos/a.1882858508606696/2650635731828966/?type=3&amp;permPage=1](https://www.facebook.com/WealthGenerationCollective/photos/a.1882858508606696/2650635731828966/?type=3&amp;permPage=1)\n\n**My website**, where you can take my quiz and get custom advice for your personal credit and find out more about business credit with and without your personal guarantee/credit check.\n\n[https://wealthgenerationcollective.com/](https://wealthgenerationcollective.com/)\n\nEDIT: As you can tell by my few replies below, I give a lot of detail. It's because I don't want to give half ass advice and get people in trouble. I'll keep answering, but it's going to be a bit slow.  \n\n\nEdit: I'm wrapping up for the day! You can find me on my website and if you reply here, I'll get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I’m excited to answer your questions today about the podcast I host, Dr. Death from Wondery. It’s not only a story about the deranged neurosurgeon Christopher Duntsch, but a look at the medical system that failed to protect its patients. All six episodes of Dr. Death are out now, and you can listen to them right [here](http://wondery.com/drdeath).\n\nFor more information -Check out more of my work on my [website](http://laurabeil.com/) or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LJBeil).Follow Dr. Death on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DrDeathWondery/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DrDeathWondery).Learn more about patient safety and check up on your surgeon at [Propublica](https://www.propublica.org/).\n\nProof: [https://twitter.com/LJBeil/status/1045355951623204865](https://twitter.com/LJBeil/status/1045355951623204865)\n\nIt’s my first AMA—so bear with me if I screw something up!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Hey everyone-- I have to jump off now.

We're signing off, but you can learn more about our search at https://go.nasa.gov/2Dzgz2J \n\n\nIs there life out there, beyond the edge of our solar system? Are we alone? People from all walks of life have pondered those questions. For decades, NASA has lead the charge in finding out. Astrobiologists—scientists who study how life could live on other planets—search for clues in acidic lakes, deep under ice, or at searing hot hydrothermal vents in the ocean. They also think about what signs of life could look like on other worlds, including planets in our own solar system and exoplanets, which are planets orbiting stars outside our solar system. These signs are called “biosignatures,” and include things like certain types of molecules or traces left in a rock.\n \nAt the same time, other scientists have pioneered a different kind of search for life. These scientists look for signs of intelligent life who might be trying to reach out to others in the galaxy with radio or laser transmissions. These signs are called “technosignatures.” Other types of technosignatures include evidence of pollutants in an exoplanet atmosphere or signs of an extraterrestrial structure around an exoplanet or star.\n \nWe’re a group of scientists who study astrobiology, exoplanets (including potentially habitable ones!) and potential technosignatures, and we’re here to answer your questions about this exciting field!

Two years ago, I ran against Debbie Wasserman Schultz, then the chair of the Democratic National Committee, in the August 30, 2016 Democratic primary that's still mired in controversy since the Broward County Supervisor of Elections illegally destroyed all the ballots cast in the primary. I was motivated to run against Wasserman Schultz because of her fundraising and voting records, and particularly her close ties with big Wall Street banks, private insurers, Big Pharma, predatory payday lenders, private prison companies, the fossil fuels industry, and many other big corporate interests that were lobbying for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). In this rematch, it's exciting to run as an independent in a district that's less than 25% registered Republicans. I have pledged to take no PAC money, no corporate donations, no SuperPACs. My campaign is entirely funded by small donations, mostly online at:  [https://timcanova.com/](https://timcanova.com/) We have a great grassroots campaign, with lots of volunteer energy here in the district and around the country!\n\nAsk Me Anything!",

I was working a job I didn’t love, and constantly found myself daydreaming about starting my own business.\n\nI decided that I wanted to give it a real shot and started to prepare to exit the job.\n\nAt the time I quit my job I was able to get to the level of making about $1,000 per month dedicating about 10 hours per week to selling online.\n\nI was confident that if I could dedicate full time hours to the project I could get to at least $4,000 per month working 40 hours per week.\n\nIt was still a bit of a risk, but a calculated one. It’s turned out that leaving that job was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.\n\nOver the past 5 years, I’ve built a great team of 10, expanded selling platforms, and learned a lot along the way. Today we sell products on Amazon, eBay, Jet.com, and our own websites. In 2018, we’re on track to break $5 Million in sales.\n\nI have three businesses now - the one I originally quit my job for, a Shopify-based store that I bought and recently turned profitable, and [a blog](https://onlinesellingexperiment.com/) where I aim to help others build their own online retail businesses by sharing my experiences.\n\nFor all the reasons listed above, quitting my job to pursue my own business turned out to be one of the best decisions I ever made. It has given me more money, more time, and has allowed me to help other people in meaningful ways.\n\nAsk me anything about selling online, quitting my job, running your own business, or anything else!\n\nProof of Amazon sales YTD in 2018: [https://imgur.com/QVzUofM](https://imgur.com/QVzUofM)\n\nProof I am who I say I am: [https://twitter.com/walkaway50K/status/1045037655946416128](https://twitter.com/walkaway50K/status/1045037655946416128)\n\nEDIT 1 @ 6:50PM CT - Thanks for all of the great questions so far!

I'll plan on checking back in a couple days for any questions that continue to come in. So if you have more questions keep them coming! \n\nIf you find this interesting and would like the longer version of my journey over the past 5 years, I just did a write up about it on the blog I mentioned.

Today, ProtonMail provides security and privacy to millions of people around the world.\n\nI’m happy to answer any questions you have about online privacy, why it matters, and what are some of the challenges we face in trying to save it. Also happy to talk about entrepreneurship and what it was like transitioning from science to tech.\n\nTo prove it’s me, here’s a [picture](https://truepic.com/wz2ymw34/) my colleague just took of me here in our Geneva headquarters.\n\nLooking forward to your questions!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT 21:10 Geneva: Thanks to everybody who participated! It was a pleasure to answer many of your questions, and I'm sorry that I was not able to get to all of them. It is heartening to see so much interest in privacy and security, and it gives me a lot of hope for the future. As it is now past 9PM in Geneva, I will have to sign off for now although I may be back to answer a few more questions later.

        "text": "Hello Reddit,\n\nIt’s great to be here with you today!\n\nMy name is Frank Blake -- I was the chairman and CEO of Home Depot for seven years. Now I tell inspiring stories about people who do amazing things for others on the [Crazy Good Turns podcast](https://crazygoodturns.org/).\n\nOne of the powerful lessons I learned at Home Depot was you get what you celebrate.  When you celebrate people who do something right, the results are usually more good work by that person and others.  The Crazy Good Turns podcast is bringing that idea to the world at a larger scale.  If we celebrate those who do good deeds, will we see more of them? If you hear a story about an inspiring person doing something amazing for somebody else, will you try to be a little better too? We invite you to join us on the journey and see.\n\nBefore we get started, here are a couple of my favorite podcast episodes:\n\n[Team Rubicon](https://crazygoodturns.org/episodes/team-rubicon/)\n\nWe’ve heard too many times the stories of military veterans struggling to find a place in the civilian world.  Jake Wood of Team Rubicon unites the skills and experiences of military veterans with first responders to rapidly deploy emergency response teams.\n\n[The Gift](https://crazygoodturns.org/episodes/the-gift/)\n\nIn this episode we did something a little different, you hear five stories of incredible gifts or acts of kindness.  One of the five stories that stood out for me was the story of Janis Martinez, who caught fire at the age of two and was saved by a trucker who was willing to donate his skin for a skin graph.\n\n[Proof](https://imgur.com/a/OiX938Q) &amp; [Proof](https://www.instagram.com/p/BoHgX-EHYdH/?taken-by=crazygoodturns)\n\nLet’s get started -- Ask me anything Reddit!",

Thanks to all for your questions on the ever-confusing world of voter reg. \n&gt; 1 in 8 voter registrations are invalid. Double check your reg status here: www.vote.dosomething.org. \n&gt; If you need anything else, catch me here: www.twitter.com/@m_beats\n\n---\nI’m Michaela Bethune, Head of Campaigns at [DoSomething.org](https://www.dosomething.org/us), the largest tech not-for-profit exclusively dedicated to young people   social change and civic action. I work everyday to ensure that young people, regardless of their party affiliation or ideology, make their voices heard in our political system by registering and voting.\n\nIn doing this work, I’ve had to learn the ins and outs of each state’s laws and make sure that our online voter registration portals, our members who run on-the-ground voter registration drives, and our messaging strategy are completely compliant with the complexities of voter registration rules and regulations as a not-for-profit, 501c3. \n\nToday is National Voter Registration Day! Since 2012, every year on the fourth Tuesday of September, hundreds of thousands of first-time voters register to vote on this day. It’s an amazing celebration of our democracy -- a time for all Americans to come together and get ready to vote. \n\nCurious about your state’s voter registration laws and how you can get registered? Or about the first voter registration laws? Or which state asked the question, “How many bubbles are in a bar of soap” for a literacy test to register to vote? Ask Me Anything about the world of voter registration, voter suppression, rights at the polls, or any other topic you think of! \n\nWhile you’re waiting for an answer, take 2 minutes and make sure you’re registered to vote and that your address is up to date by heading to [vote.dosomething.org](http://vote.dosomething.org/)\n\nProof: https://i.redd.it/kmzl31d6j8n11.jpg",
