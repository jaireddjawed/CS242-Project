Most will require you to purchase something first and have your physical card present, but stores like Food Lion (my favorite) all you need to do is just ask the cashier for a cash back transaction and you can use touchless pay (apple/google pay) on your phone or use the card and there is literally NO FEES or ANY EXTRA PURCHASE. \nThis also works if the store has self-checkout. You just need to scan a 30¢ item and then you can get up to $150 back (at food lion). You can download this more than once too, just go to each self checkout!\nMuch better than a $3.50+ fee if you ask me.",

        "text": "I've been fighting mice for 20 years in our home in the woods. Hard to keep them out, they can get into the smallest holes. But I finally found a solution about three months ago. Strobe lights.\n\nMice usually came into my house through the garage or attic. So I set up cheap strobe lights in both places and put them on a smart-plug timer to come on and off at sunset and sunrise. They may still try to get into the house, but the strobe lights must freak them out and they leave. So far since I started doing this I've had no mice. First time in 20 years I went through a winter without them trying to live in my house.\n\nPoison's are the worst solution, the mice just end up dead in the walls and stink up the house for weeks. Traps are fine, but it doesn't stop them from coming in and breading and it's a huge hassle and disgusting to deal with traps constantly. The strobe lights are genius, as is the person that discovered using them (wasn't me) against rodents. Wish I would have found this out years ago. \n\nOnly downside is if you have mice from the 70s that like discos.",

        "text": "In high school and college no one told me how revolutionary spreadsheet tech is. It wasn't until I got to an accounting job out of college that I really learned how to use formulas, links, vlookup, summary tables, etc...\n\nAt my environmental compliance job, I automated chemical calculations so we just had to copy/paste results from a contractor, and then the report we needed to send into the state would pop up at the end. Spent 2 hours on a template to save myself 1.5 hr of work each month.\n\nIn grad school for engineering, several of my peers were crunching data manually, whereas I could spend 20 min setting up some formulas and graphs, and then copy/paste data in for different trials and be done with my analysis within an hour.\n\nI tutor in math/science on the side, and try to get my HS students to check it out. When I showed one of them how to do an averaging formula, it blew his mind because he had been typing everything into a calculator manually. \n\nAt my current engineering job, there was no component tracker to keep tabs on what equipment we had available, where it was, what features it had, etc...I spent 2 days inventorying our components and created a 10 tab spreadsheet with a data entry tab where if you take out a component for testing, you change the status from \"System #4\" to \"bench\" in a drop-down menu, and if you check the \"System #4\" tab, the list of components inside it automatically updates to show if a component is present and what serial # is there.\n\nI have a spreadsheet to inventory my floss colors for cross stitching, another one for calculating disc golf scores when we play, one for finance, etc...\n\nYou don't have to be a math genius, you don't need to be an expert and spend a year learning to use it. There are tons of free tutorials online and once you get the basics, you will see a use for it EVERYWHERE. It can also help your career by being able to demonstrate ways you contribute by cutting down time spent on tasks and your initiative in solving problems. Literally cannot emphasize enough how much I love spreadsheets.",
