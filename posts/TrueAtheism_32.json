It feel like a lot of people would simply ignore this advancement in science and chock it up to \"God's Will,\" but I still have a feeling plenty would react differently. \n\nMy view is that a lot of Religious folks view our 'creation' as an act of God and that we are all unique in our own special way. Well, ultimately, the one thing that really makes us unique(at least as far as personality wise) is our brain. A body is just a means to allowing our brain to transport itself if you think about it. \n\nBut, I'm more or less curious as to what religious communities will say if this man in fact leads a relatively successful life following his transplant onto another 'unique' human beings body.\n\nEdit per mod's request",

It's refreshing to be able to read intelligent conversation regarding atheism instead of the \"born-again-atheists\" you so often encounter.  The ones spouting hate from their naturalistic pulpits. \n\nI'm a recovering Baptist (one is never completely recovered from such a trying experience). I used to want to be a youth minister. Quickly I moved to militant atheism and I reveled in pissing off Christians. Militant atheism turned out to require too much energy. I just couldn't be angry all the time. Bad for the bowels. I toyed with Apatheism for a bit but found it didn't suit me. I have ideas that I care about. I've finally settled firmly in Agnostic territory. \n\nMy question is this: As an atheist, how do you reconcile the fact that, as far as I can tell, Atheism is belief in nothing. Belief. It purports to know that there is nothing and, in my opinion, that is possibly just as detrimental as faith based religions. \n\n\n\n\n\n**edit**:  everyone who has posted so far seems to've seized on the fact that I don't understand what atheism actually entails. forgive me for not participating in arguments of definition, which seem to be what most everyone here wants to argue. \n\nallow me to reiterate the question. religion claims belief. atheism claims nonbelief. two extremes. how is atheism different from theism in terms of what it assumes to have knowledge of (the non existence of a diety)? \n\n why I'm asking this again I don't know. maybe it's because I'd like to give you all a chance to redeem yourselves with real conversation as opposed to assuming you have the intellectual high ground (which, I might add, is the same bullshit you see in r/atheism). being an atheist doesn't make you smarter or better than anyone else and to attempt to belittle someone for asking a serious question when none of you can provide an answer congruent with the others is more than nonsensical. it's asinine. no wonder people don't like these subs.

Seth talked extensively about christian rock, and I, having grown up a fundamentalist christian, recognized all the big names in Christian Contemporary music. It actually made me quite nostalgic (singing was always the best part of any religious activity, at least for me). I got in my car after work and turned on a praise and worship station on Pandora. Singing to those songs (which I still knew, after being an atheist and not attending church for ~4 years) made me get really emotional; I even teared up several times, just on the way home. It was not spiritual in any way, just the right chords and harmonies occurred in just the right way for my brain to release tons of dopamine. If I was religious it would have been an \"experience\". \n\nThat's the thing: religious experiences are just dopamine, and for some people or most people it doesn't take much to trigger that kind of state. Even though I'm not even slightly religious, those certain melodies made my brain have a emotional high. I've seen atheists wonder how adults could go to religion after not caring/believing. This is how: dopamine. You don't have to already believe to have it happen. If you can convince yourself that there's something \"more\" than your brain, then poof, you're a theist. \n\nI feel like I've added another weapon in my arsenal against the arguments from theists; if someone tells me they had an \"experience\", I can reply that \"so have I, but it doesn't mean anything is actually going on other than chemicals in ours brains\".\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

        "text": "To kick off this discussion I would like to use a simple scenario to illustrate a point.\n\nImagine John lives deep in the bible belt and he is a Republican.  Pretty much everyone he knows is a Republican.  John thinks the liberal point of view is bad; however, he has heard that some people have such a point of view.  He has even seen such people on TV.\n\nFrom his personal experience he draws the conclusion that most Americans are Republicans and very few people are liberals.  This is completely in line with what he experiences in his every day life.  He's never even met someone who claimed to be liberal.  He has family up north, but he has never heard them say they are liberal, so he assumes they must be Republicans since he considers them such nice folk.\n\nHow would you expect John to react when he's told that polling has shown there is a very large portion of the American public that is liberal?\n\nNow imagine he asserts that the polling data is inaccurate.  Now imagine he asserts that the polling data is inaccurate *despite a liberal president being elected*.\n\nThis would seem very strange of John, would it not?\n\nI've noticed a trend of something like this among liberals and atheists.  I first noticed this European atheists using anecdotal evidence to claim their country is less religious than some statistics might show.  However, I noticed a much more drastic example in American liberals willingness to accept how the public views LGBT rights.\n\nWhen I talk to my liberal friends about LGBT rights, they often bring up the Westboro Baptist Church.  They point them out as a church of hate and extremists.  However, they seem to think that all anti-lgbt people are like this.  It's like every state has one or two bad churches and they'll just go away soon.  It doesn't even cross their mind that someone they know, who is otherwise a very nice person, could be anti-lgbt.\n\nWhen I've given my friends and fellow redditors stats regarding how many Americans believe same-sex relations is wrong, they question the validity of the statistics.  Even if I provide multiple sources, I still get responses like \"I just don't think that's right\" and \"that's not a good representation of Americans.\"\n\nTo be clear they *believe* that the polling is wrong and that there are less anti-lgbt people than actually exist.\n\nThis really confuses me, because there are tons of states which don't have enough support to pass legislation of LGBT marriage, but there are plenty with enough support to ban it.\n\nI began to wonder, how can my friends know that states are voting against LGBT rights, yet still hold onto the notion that anti-LGBT views are just from a few bad apples?\n\nI think the answer to this is actually pretty simple.  They don't want to acknowledge there is a real problem, because then they would have to acknowledge the source of that problem (religion).\n\nPerhaps there are a significant chunk of people who refuse to accept that religion is a problem because they simply don't want to live in a world where it is.  It's much nicer to just imagine everything is hunky dory. \n\nI think we would actually benefit more if, rather than the WBC, a calm, collected, pleasant, and charitable woman aired her views on LGBT rights.  I think it would do more to drive home the point that these are every day people who hold these views.  Just because someone is nice to you, doesn't mean that they support equal rights.  ",

My reasoning mostly stems from my own interpretation of what I have read about the brain, and related readings. \n\nI'd like everyone to answer the following questions, as I think this might make a discussion easier to follow:\n\n1. Why do you/don't you believe in free will?\n\n2. Does this belief come from your religious beliefs, or somewhere else?\n\n3. In what ways could the theory of free will be tested?

        "text": "Original thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/31lpyb/an_examination_of_why_churches_dont_pay_taxes_and/).\nThis will mainly focus on Christianity in Britain and Ireland. I will connect this to American history later.\n\nThe tradition of churches not paying taxes goes back thousands of years. It appears to start in the Bible. Genesis 47:26 says\n&gt; So Joseph established it as a law concerning land in Egypt—still in force today—that a fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh. It was only the land of the priests that did not become Pharaoh’s.\n\nSimilarly, Ezra 7:24 states\n&gt; You are also to know that you have no authority to impose taxes, tribute or duty on any of the priests, Levites, musicians, gatekeepers, temple servants or other workers at this house of God.\n\nAt the Synod of Macon in 585, tithes were [officially made an obligation]( http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09507a.htm)\nTithing then became required (at least in medieval Britain) and enforced by [threat of excommunication]( http://www.historyforkids.org/learn/medieval/religion/tithes.htm#!) You'd pay if it meant not burning in hell, right?\n\nFast-forward to the 1180s. Saladin (a Muslim) captures Jerusalem, a city the Crusaders just won, and Europe is furious. To get money for another crusade to win Jerusalem back, a tax called the [Saladin tithe](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2848077?sid=21105901897521&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;uid=3739976&amp;uid=2) was instituted. All people (regardless of faith) except Crusaders were required to pay, and pay they did.\n&gt; The Crusade taxes of 1166 and 1188, the latter the famous Saladin tithe, are well-known as levies made by the kings of France and England at the request of the Pope and paid both by the clergy and the laity for the support of the crusade to the Holy Land.\n\nThis tax was different, however: it was collected by the authority of the royalty (state), not the church. This is where you're probably thinking, \"What the hell! Why can't the church collect its own damn money, instead of making the king get it?\" Me too.\n\nAt the Council of Trent, [excommunication was established]( https://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/trentall.html) as the penalty for failure to tithe.\n&gt; The payment of tithes is due to God; and they who refuse to pay them, or hinder those who give them, usurp the property of another... And they who either withhold them, or hinder them (from being paid), shall be excommunicated; nor be absolved from this crime, until after full restitution has been made.\n\nAdam Smith argued against tithes in his The Wealth of Nations, saying\n&gt; The tithe, as it is frequently a very unequal tax upon the rent, so it is always a great discouragement, both to the improvements of the landlord, and to the cultivation of the farmer\n\nNot content with using tithes to fight a war, they actually fought a war about the tithes. [And it was brutal.]( http://www.traceyclann.com/files/carrickshock.pdf)\n&gt; ... people began to wrench heavy rocks from the walls and heave them down upon the constables. ‘The stones hit each other [in the air] they were so thick’, recalled one who was there, ‘they were like a shower’. Others attacked the police with pitchforks, clubs, hurling sticks and their bare hands. Minutes later, 13 constables – including Captain Gibbons – and the process server Edmund Butler lay dead or dying, most from shattered skulls and appalling stab wounds. Another 14 officers suffered severe injuries; only 11 of the 38 came away unharmed or with minor scrapes. Of the crowd, three were killed and an unknown number injured.\n\nThe Tithe War in Ireland from 1830-1836 pitted Irish Catholic farmers, angry at being forced to pay for the Anglican Church, against the English government. The government gave in, as [\"It cost a shilling to collect tuppence.\"]( https://books.google.com/books?id=gC93bLKtMqMC&amp;pg=PA475&amp;lpg=PA475&amp;dq=it+cost+a+shilling+to+collect+tuppence&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=88bndalWxB&amp;sig=uJVmuOP8cVZ8AkwBrVkD_ZvalGQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GRgiVZeeBsTSsAXw9YHgDQ&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=it%20cost%20a%20shilling%20to%20collect%20tuppence&amp;f=false) In other words, it wasn't worth the effort.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Anglican Church had been losing members, [but the remaining were giving more money]( http://i.imgur.com/O7tGvpv.jpg).\n\nHowever, this will not hold long. According to this [2007 article from the WSJ]( http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119576921737201375),\n&gt; Church leaders say tithing isn't just a theological issue, but a financial one. Americans gave an estimated $97 billion to congregations in 2006, almost a third of the country's $295 billion in charitable donations, according to Giving USA Foundation, a nonprofit educational organization in Glenview, Ill. But giving to religion is growing more slowly than other types of giving, says Patrick Rooney, director of research at the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. That's partly because people are attending church less frequently, says Mr. Rooney, and are giving to a wider array of causes, including secular ones.\n\nIn the next part, I'll examine how tithes are used in not-so-great ways (read: megachurches) and how the elimination of tax-exempt status of churches could let the government use that money (which the churches clearly aren't giving exclusively to the poor, as I'll show later) for social welfare programs.\n\nTL;DR: You had to pay tithes back in the day, even if you didn't believe in that church (tough luck). They were both used for wars and the subject of wars, so you could say it was a pretty contentious issue.\n\nI'll leave you with a little joke about [the ridiculousness of tithes]( https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/d7/3e/63/d73e63c3beb5ffa4b0855d428a970cd9.jpg).Hopefully knowing the history behind tithes will allow you to understand both how tithes were used for violent purposes and enforced by threat of eternal torture.\n\n",

She is a reluctant theist and knows I'm an athiest so she sometimes brings up topics with me. \n\nWe were discussing what was necessary for a person to have a belief in god and it struck me that my wife's god concept was really nebulous. She could only really explain god in two ways:\n\n- By actions he supposedly undertook (created the universe/people). \n- By transcendent attributes outside the scope of the human mind to fully grasp (omniscience, omnibenevolence, etc). \n\nIt seems to me that we can only define things meaningfully if we use other things that we already understand to explain them. This seems to present problems for human brains supporting a coherent concept of god (given the most popular definitions). \n\nThis made me wonder: how many believers actually have a coherent god concept in the first place? And, if someone has a god concept that is nebulous, fractured, or vacuous in this way, is it really a god concept at all? \n\nI'm betting this has been discussed before but I've not found much on it.

        "text": "Throwaway acct, this is probably boring to read, but I'm struggling at this point and am hoping someone has been through similar and throw some experience at me.\n\nI've been dating someone I like very much for the last year, we had an argument about 2 months into our relationship about the existence of god (read 'I argued/yelled **at** her'). That was a poor decision on my part, and I didn't realize how heated I got till too late, and though I apologized for my rude behaviour it set the stage for her being afraid to discuss religion with me ever since that point, even almost a year later now.\n\nFrom then on, I tried to show by my actions that this wasn't something that was integral to me, not being confrontational on religion, and saying how I don't have any answers about anything and could be wrong about any of it, but it's always been this unspoken topic between us.\n\nNow that we've been together for a while, I care more about her now, the relationship doesn't feel like a fling anymore, and that means I care about how she approaches things in life/philosophy. She's brilliant (into machine learning), and we have great conversations on several tech topics, but every so often we hit some topic (most recently say Scientology news on reddit, or education, or recent movies) where religion is within the topic and it's like walking on eggshells for both of us. \n\nI tried broaching the issue recently, again trying to re-assure that I don't think I'm right and she's wrong because I don't know the answers, but she says she feels judged by me (and I am at fault here for having said things to that effect in the past). I don't know how to fix that, I thought hard about why I had judged her in the past and realized some of my issues, and now I don't feel like I'm judging her, tbh I don't even know what her thoughts are on many of those topics, since we don't talk about it. Honestly I am not helping because I have been pretty straight-forward about my thoughts on religious topics before. I wish I could turn back time and have never thought or said them, because I was/am naive.\n\nSome things I read say to take an active interest in her side to understand, so I try asking about her spirituality/philosophy, but that has the wrong effect as she thinks I'm just trying to attack her. I want to be with someone who likes talking about how we approach problems, how the future will be, etc., and not be afraid to say things that will offend one of the two of us. I feel like I can't say anything now without worrying that she'll take it the wrong way. I have tried showing that I will listen to her thoughts on any topic without judging, but she hasn't yet.\n\nI know I'm the one to blame here, I'm looking for some guidance on what I'm doing wrong, and/or what I should be doing to help salvage this relationship. I want someone I can talk about anything with, even/especially if we don't agree on everything. We have so many more positive things going on in our time together than to let something as silly as this destroy it.\n\n**TL;DR - I scared my gf out of talking about religion and it's still hurting our relationship months later, looking for help to fix my mistake.**",

Carried this on through college (now sophomore). I go to church often, am confirmed, etc. Haven't had sex, waiting til marriage as of now.\n\nI was going strong, getting into longwinded debates with my friends, girlfriends, even strangers about God. They only made me believe more. I was well set and unferstanding, not in blind faith. Everything changed one night.\n\nCame back to my room pretty drunk. Sat on the couch for a sec before going to bed. Pulled out my phone and checked facebook before bed. Wound up finding a comedian talking about gun violence (very clever. Tangent, http://youtu.be/Jl--YVnni0I) but check it out  and thought I'd look at some more of his stuff. He had some really clever points, and comedy is the best way to start a discussion, because only a nitwit gets angry at a guy for being funny. Anyway, I found this video: http://youtu.be/tOgW8y2jakw\n\nI didn't know what to think. Keep in mind, I'm still drunk. Not exactly a great time for an existential crisis.\n\nI didn't see it as a disproval of God - Jim didn't say anything that contradicted A God. But it contradicted MY God. I still can't quite grasp this: Catholics believe that original sin is passed on to us in birth and we must be cleansed. But we don't knowingly cleanse ourselves. We are told God is merciful, but He's gonna say \"fuck it, you're all bad people until someone else makes you do this\". \n\nI've been searching all morning for a forum for people with doubts. Didn't find anything that wasn't incredibly biased. One site said, paraphrased, \"Adam's sin is transferred to us just as our sin in transferred to Jesus\". I'm not God, and I'm not Adam. I didn't eat the apple, and I'm not the Son of God. That explanation goes nowhere.\n\nSo here I am. Can't stand behind that doctrine (a very core one) but I also can't deny that I agree with the overwhelming majority of Catholicism.\n\nI was searching reddit for a doubters subreddit, but I didn't find anything. Figured yall might be able to help. Have you ever doubted atheism? Did you go through something like this? Even just sharing an anecdote might give me some direction.\n\nEDIT- tl;dr: was very religious, now questioning. Looking for some discussion, advice, etc as there is no r/catholicdoubt or the like\n\nEDITx2- I've gotten a lot of really good stuff here. Quick point- I'm not here to be talked out of religion. I'm here to talk. Say what you have to say, but keep it respectful. This is a discussion, I won't slander you, please don't do it back.\n\nEDITx3- To anyone I was an ass to last night, I apologize. The combination of little sleep and long hours of thought didn't leave much room for patience. I'll make a point of being much nicer about how I approach this from here on out. Thanks to /u/Otiac for pointing this out much more nicely than I deserved.",

        "text": "So last night after just watching Interstellar my family and I got into a conversation about the science of it. I was talking about how objects would act at the event horizon of a black hole. Of course this conversation was a perfect way to put in a jab about how \"Science doesn't know everything so there is room for God.\" Of course I got very defensive about my life-long passion. The only issue is, is that my family are not very knowledgeable about science and are unruly in arguements. I was trying to explain things in layman's terms but of course deep questions of the universe aren't easily simplified. It ended with me being very flustered and them having a 3 on one attack session. I went for a walk to cool myself but they ended up following my to \"Finish their point.\" My family has had this conversation before but this one got out of hand more than any other. I felt very uncomfortable, even today I still feel uncomfortable. The premise of their arguement is that:\n\n1. I don't know enough.\n\n2. I'm to young to make these choices.\nThey think I'm going to have some supernatural experience in life that will turn me to God.\n\n3. I'm closed minded.\n\nWhat frustrated me is that I'm the only one who wasn't presupposing anything. I guess I find it hard to assert my views to people who either don't understand or don't wish to learn. Does anyone have any tips to deal with these kinds of issues? Should I be more aggressive with my views? Lately I have been trying to evade the conversation for the simple fact that it is more of an attack on me then an actual debate. I can never get a word in edgewise.",

Of all the things to take as axiomatically true, I think \"Ideas should be tested by experiment\" is among the most reasonable. \n\nThing is, I try to be skeptical. And it feels weird to make such a broad statement like that. But, I can't think of a good reason not to without breaking into some wishy-washy philosophy. \n\nSo, what do you all think?

About a year ago my parents got involved with a new church and have been really active in that community. And it makes me happy knowing they have an active social life and aren't just sitting at home doing nothing while they aren't working.  They often ask me to go to church, or church related events, to which I usually politely decline and life goes on without any trouble.  So this year my dad's birthday happens to fall on Easter and I was going to go to church with them that day to make them happy.  The church also has an Easter egg hunt like event on Saturday, to which I did not agree to go to because I work until midnight on Friday and the event starts early in the morning and I would just be tired and grumpy the whole time and would bring the mood down.  Here's the part that really irks me.  To go to this event the participants have to sign a waiver.  My mother, without my knowledge, forged my signature and gave the church my email address.  I know it's not that big of a deal, but it really pisses me off that she would do something like that.  The worst part is I would have signed the thing if she would have just asked me.  So I guess my question is am right to be this upset , or is this just no big deal.  \n\nTL;DR my mother forged my signature on a church document, and I'm a little upset.",

        "text": "We have a lot of discussions in this sub about why we think theistic traditions are groundless, and about our interactions with our theistic peers in day to day life.\n\nSo let's talk about something without a theistic side.  What do you base your morals on?  I think that personal morals come from three main sources in varying measure:  Desposition, Cultural environment, Education.  Given this triangle, I can broadly break down groups of people into three categories based on which one influences them the most.\n\nDisposition:  These are the black sheep, the misfits.  Dare I say, this group is most inclined to anti-social (criminal) behavior.  They act first for self, then temper to reduce the amount of trouble they could receive from society.  This is how many people where early in human history, and it's still common today.\n\nCulture:  These are the go with the flow types, excelling at group think and conforming.  They'll follow the rules because they are there, not because they have determined them to be just.  This group takes the morals of the past, then takes it on the trust of their elders that they are worthwhile with having to think them through themselves.\n\nEducation:  This group, which accounts for many atheists and people who have rejected the way they were originally raised in general, have the most enlightened comparative morals.  Being able to take the broadness of the human experience from history, and then developing a set of standards to fit your own life is the methodology for reaching truly universal morals.\n\nNow obviously, I don't think these are equal, quite the opposite.  disposition and culture are stepping stones in the development of a modern frame of mind, an educated mind.  It's easy to see the sequence here.  Disposition is how animals work, you're born and you get a random personality.  Culture is how humans \"have\" worked since we invented it.  And it's a heck of a lot better than disposition.  Most of human history, education was rare and it the hands of the elite.  In order to shape society and keep control of it, the elite would establish traditions, proven ways of thinking and acting, so that future generations wouldn't have to rediscover everything for themselves each time.  Now, within the last few centuries, we've entered a new era (I think it became with the Renaissance) were the information available to the next generation is greater than the information available to the last generation.\n\nYou see it now in the slow uptake of new technology in older generations, and the rejection of new social constructs like LBGT rights.  I think we'll have more in common with our Grandchildren than we have with our grandparents because we started in a full information age, where our grandparents did not.  Not that their concepts won't be wildly different than ours, but I think we'll be more willing to accept newer better ways of being as they become available.\n\nMy personal example; I've based my way of thinking on the teachings of Socrates.  The scientific method, social contract, the pursuit of virtue, and the rejection of the idea that I have all the answers.  I did not grow up being read the Apology as a kid, and I wasn't exposed to it before high school, I had to stumble across this way of thinking all on my own.  But i was ready to expand my horizons by learning just by the fact that I grew up with limitless access already a given.  I'm thirty now, and I look forward to learning for the rest of my life.\n\nTL;DR:  Universal morality is a new concept that has come about in the last several centuries because individuals can now educate themselves like never before.\n\nClarification edit:  I don't think the universal morality is a new idea, but rather that access to the concept is now much more wide spread than in previous centuries.  My own role model Socrates was a pioneer for the concept of universal morality.",

I actually haven't even searched for articles or data on these ideas so feel free to rip them as they stem from my own political leanings (liberal) which have no connections to atheism. Both of these are based on the assumption that the left is less religious than the right. \n\n1. Conservative Christian politicians are to blame for much of what I dislike in US politics, and social policy. Gay rights, immigration reform, universal health care, promotion of science, gun control are all stunted more often by the most vocally Christian politicians than by the least religious ones. Also, conservative Christians are friendlier to corporate powers who's bottom lines then take precedence over citizens rights.  See [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/31581y/great_npr_podcast_on_in_god_we_trust_and_one/) about how big business co-opted Christianity ages ago. Essentially I think *religious people with dogmatic beliefs are the easiest people to be used and then abused by people in power, namely politicians and corporate interests*.   \n\n2. The lefts inability to discuss and understand Islamist terrorists as an Islam problem is largely due to years tolerating conservative Christians that heavily influence American politics. Essentially when the left hears of odd or oppressive or violent practices in the Muslim world the mental response is \"well, we have the crazy Christians here, *we have to accept and tolerate Christian beliefs in order to have a functioning society. We should do the same for Islam*. They are pretty much the same thing. Just two different crazies\". They then take the Reza Aslan apologist approach that all religions are the same and the texts don't matter. This aligns with my understanding of Islam and Muslims was sort of flung apart after the Charlie Hebdo massacre which made me dive into Hitchens, Harris and Hirsi Ali and others. It then makes sense when Harris and Hitchens say the only the (Christian) right understand the major issues with Islam as they actually believe what Islamist Muslims say. \n\nThanks.\n\n",

        "text": "A couple months ago, I planned to write about this here on /r/TrueAtheism today on the 1st of April, not because it's a bona fide April Fool's Day prank, but because it might be seen as one and that would be funny. Now I find more understanding and less irony in my story, but here it is anyway.\n\nWhen I was 12, my father married the worst kind of Christian, one with views in line with the Klan and the WBC. Hated blacks, hated Hispanics, hated gays, but, as it affected me, hated secular music. My father got an exception, but didn't stand up for anybody else. My rock and metal tapes had to stay at my mother's house, where I was only able to visit every other weekend. Being a teenager in the early 90s, music was important to me. So, this was a problem.\n\nA couple guys from church invited me to a party, and the music they were playing was, to my ears, pretty amazing. It was somewhere between Def Leppard, Van Halen, and Bon Jovi. Of course, all the lyrics were God this, Jesus that, but I've never been one to say I identify with lyrics. I groove to the guitar and my heart beats with the drums. I like vocals as a musical instrument. The sound of the voice. So I don't even care if music is in another language, as long as the vocals sound good.\n\nSo I got the name of the band, and ran it by my evil stepmother. She had heard of them, so we went to the Christian bookstore, and bought their tape. Our church's youth group went to see them in concert, but they only had CDs, so I bought the CD of the tape I owned, plus the new one. I had no CD player, but was bound to get one sooner than later.\n\nI would later learn that the band, Petra, was the biggest Christian band, and that they had been making music since the 1970s, taking popular rock music and adding praise lyrics, to rope in secular listeners. But the music was legit, their guitarist can legitimately shred with some of the best of them — he's no Eddie Van Halen, but he's got chops. Typical late 80s, early 90s hard rock. Heavy guitar, lots of synth... I actually liked it.\n\nFast forward however many years. Conflicts came to a head and I moved back in with my mother. Dropped all the Petra stuff in a drawer and went straight back to secular rock and metal. I don't know what I did with my Petra tape, but the CDs, I got rid of, though, before I did, I \"ripped\" them to my computer. And there they sat for years and years, kind of as a joke. I considered deleting them many times, but never did. I never needed the space, and I felt that they served as a reminder.\n\nFor Christmas last year, my wife got me a 64GB memory card for my phone, so I proceed to load up ALL THE MUSIC. I mean that figuratively, as my Music folder is 150GB. So I get all my favorites. Many classics. Secondary favorites. Tertiary favorites. At this point when I'd get bored I'd look for music to put on my phone. \"Oh I might play that. Sure, copy it over.\" The Petra folder catches my eye. I laugh... then copy it over. Sort of to troll myself as I'm scrolling in Poweramp (my music player of choice). Then, a couple months ago (bringing us back to the beginning of this story), I'm looking for something to play. Something I hadn't heard in a while. I scrolled past Petra a few times, but started noticing it. It didn't \"call to me\" or anything like that. But I thought, what the hell. I hadn't heard it, at this point, in over 20 years.\n\nAs an atheist, the lyrics were straight up cringe worthy, but the music itself was as powerful as ever. I found that I still really like it, and 2 months later, I still do. I don't agree with what the lyrics are saying, but I don't usually agree with a lot of lyrics. That has never been a requirement for me. So I'm struggling with this, and the solution that I came up with is two-fold:\n\nOne, Christians like my evil stepmother, are limited to Christian media that reaffirms their faith. There's a lot of secular music that doesn't that they can take or leave, but probably just as much anti-theist music as there is theist music. Or media. But I feel that atheists should not be similarly limited. Should we only listen to anti-theist and secular music? (Deicide is an anti-theist band; aside from their name meaning \"to kill a god,\" they have expressed their anti-theism in interviews.) I say no. I say we don't have arbitrary borders. The only borders we have, we set for ourselves. They aren't decided for us. While many atheists will put Petra's music outside their borders, that's their choice. It wasn't decided for them by an organization, a parent, a church, etc.\n\nTwo, there are a lot of rock stars out there who do things we may not necessarily agree with. I neither drink alcohol (except for Irish creme in my coffee, and the occasional craft beer) nor do drugs, but a lot of rock stars do. I mean, Aerosmith — coke, and/or heroin almost killed them, and fueled some of their greatest early songs. Eric Clapton. Duh. Jimi Hendrix, who put LSD in his headband and, when he would sweat, it would drip down into his eyes. So many of them do drugs. There are a lot who abuse their spouses and kids. One rock star was convicted of child pornography, a pop star prosecuted for molesting children. There are some bad people in music. People do shitty things, yet the music they like speaks to us in such a way that we can't help but like it. I think that's okay on some level. You don't want to support them, but you want to support all the other people who worked on the music, like the producers and engineers. Or maybe you tell yourself that you separate the music from the person.\n\nAlso, I think I have an interesting view on Christianity (and other religions). I think some share it, but I also think it's a relatively new approach to religion, by atheists. That is, I don't think of the Bible as fiction, per se... I mean, I do, but I don't actively, I guess, make that a point. I think of it more as like a fandom. Do I tell Spider-Man fans that there's no such thing as Spider-Man? No. Of course I know it, but I don't feel the need to tell them. I assume they know it full well, and they choose to like what Spider-Man represents. Of course a lot of Christians believe their religion, but how can they? They say all other gods are false, but theirs is right, even after it being proven to them that Christianity was adapted from the very religions they said and still say are false. You can't have it both ways. But I let it go. I think of them as a fandom. A dangerous one, sure, but they wouldn't be the only dangerous fandom. Ask any con crowd, there's a fandom they all generally hate. It isn't Twilight, it's some web comic. Someone here probably even knows the name, but I forgot. Homestar Runner comes to mind, but that isn't it. At least I don't think... Anyway, as an atheist who is not an anti-theist, I just look at Christians as another passionate group of nerds who love a fandom I don't. When they quote the Bible chapter and verse, it's just like Trekkers who can speak Klingon, or Warsies who can cite Imperial history going back to the Old Republic. It's like, \"I love the fact that you found something you love, that you can dedicate that much grey matter to, but shut the fuck up, you're making my head hurt.\" And I mean \"shut the fuck up\" in a nice and playful way.\n\nBut wait, it gets better. So I'm listening to the original album, \"Beyond Belief,\" and some of the lyrics actually start to make sense to me. I'm sure the band would hate this, or at least not approve, but what do I care? I bought two of their albums (one twice), so I don't owe them anything. Anyway, in the title track, he's singing about a higher place to go, beyond belief. What lies beyond belief? Isn't faith the be-all, end-all of religion? Have faith and don't look too hard for answers? To me, atheism is what lies beyond belief, if you look hard enough. Right? Then there's the song \"Underground.\" At first it's typical Christian persecution complex. Oh no, the horrible atheists are persecuting us. That load of crap. But I listen again, and the only thing in the lyrics that makes his cause Christianity is \"the cross I claim.\" Well, what is a cross? The cross was the burden that Christ carried up a hill. He's saying Christianity is the cross he bears and he's being persecuted for it. But the cross can be anything. He could very well be singing about gay rights. The cross he claims being hated by society. The cross is metaphoric to whatever struggle you go through. But mostly, I just like the guitar and drums.\n\nFor a few weeks, it was most of what I was listening to. But that was mostly because I hadn't heard it in 20 years. Music is weird like that. Now it's still in rotation — I listen to the two albums together — but I'm back to playing all the stuff I was before.\n\nMy experience with atheism on Reddit is mostly limited to /r/Atheism — you either hate all Christians, or you're a Christian yourself. That's the impression I got. If you're active there and that isn't you, know that I'm not judging you personally, but that seems to be the impression I got. So for a while I did not identify as atheist, I tried to identify as anything else that was closer to my views. Apatheist (I don't care if there's a god or not), Secular humanist (we're good because we want to be, not because we're afraid of Hell or seeking Heaven), etc. But, basically, I'm an atheist. I live without theism. In my book, being atheist doesn't include set opinions of Christians. It's like vegetarians don't need an opinion on how best to cook a steak, and non-Potter fans don't need to have a favored House (Ravenclaw represent!).\n\ntl;dr: I believe being atheist means Christian media doesn't have to be excluded — we can reject it, but we aren't compelled to, in the sense Christians are at times compelled to reject secular media.\n\nWondering what others here think. A couple months ago, I was thinking about posing the situation as a question looking for some kind of validation. Like, does this mean I'm not an atheist? Am I crazy? Then I realized, yes I am crazy, and if I don't fit a label, that's fine too. Or maybe it's normal to color outside the lines a little. Maybe it's my drug. While drugs attack the user's body and the response is enjoyable to the user, maybe my drug is music whose lyrics contradict what I know and believe. Who knows.",

        "text": "I have been trying to better understand the mechanism of belief and the mechanisms of religions. In the past week, it has dawned on me that all religions (that I can think of at least) are based around the idea of purity. I would like to get some feedback from you guys here. Below I attempted to list the major religions and there corresponding purity doctrine. After, Ill try to discuss why they may have these in common. \n\n**Christianity** - You, and everyone else around you, are infected with \"sin\" which has to be \"washed away\" by \"blood.\" If this \"sin\" is not cleansed, then God's favor is not on you and you may go to hell. \n\n**Scientology** - You, and everyone else around you, are infected with Thetans, which are \"alien spirits\" that form your \"reactive mind\" which need to be cleaned out into a state of \"clear\" where you are finally clean from your worries. \n\n**Islam** - God will ultimately judge you based on your actions. Any \"bad\" actions (those which go against God's law) are \"dhanbs (sin)\" which weigh on his decision to punish you. These \"dhanbs\" can be cleansed through \"tawbah (repentance)\" in order to be sent to \"Jannah (paradise).\"\n\n**Judaism** - God will ultimately judge you based on your actions. Any \"bad\" actions (those which go against God's law) are \"chata (sin)\" which weigh on his decision to punish you. These \"chata\" can be cleansed through \"shuv nacham (repentance)\" in order to be sent to \"Olam Ha-Ba (afterlife).\"\n\n**Buddhism (theistic)** - By cleaning oneself from all desires, you may reach a state of Nirvana, which is pure from unhappiness. \n\nIt's easy to see why these sorts of purity doctrines would have been desirable in a time before germ theory and modern medicine. It would make sense that we are evolved to seek out purity, in a physical sense, to help us live longer. The problem today is that we live in a pretty pure environment. Not many of us get sick from tainted food and die, or don't know basic hygiene to prevent the spread of illness.  We are drawn to purity in any form, and religions tap into that desire by giving us an out. They tell us we are sick, but they have the cure. \n\nEdit: I forgot one major religion, [Shinto.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/shinto/beliefs/purity.shtml) \nI'd also like to point out that I am not directly talking about sexual purity here, although that often plays a very large role. Instead, I am talking about the idea of purity more generally.\n\nEdit 2: Thanks to /u/wren42 for reminding me that I had forgotten Hinduism. [Here](http://ir.minpaku.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/10502/2891/1/KH_010_2_007.pdf) is an article talking about \"pollution\" and \"purity\" in Hinduism. ",

        "text": "Hello reddit, I am currently stuck in a theology class (please do not ask how I got into this situation) where I am the only atheist among maybe 6 people being Christian/Catholic and 11 believing in Islam. Tomorrow there is going to be a \"round table discussion\" and the teacher requires that everyone bring a question pertaining to theology that can be discussed. Please Help me find the perfect question, I am sick and tired of the teacher asking 'questions' that presuppose an answer in order to reaffirm his current beliefs.\n\nEdit: Hello everyone, I am going to have to disappoint you. I was not able to ask my question since the way my theology teacher set up the discussion was by having someone ask their question based on getting their name in a roulette, two people would generally comment with mostly the teacher answering and then the flow would break by having the person who spoke spin the roulette and choose another one and so on.\n Here are some of the 'highlights' though:\n \n- A guy who is Christian asked wether anybody was concerned with the validity of the bible, which is a sensible question. A blonde girl who is Catholic basically said we didn't need to concern ourselves with that since the fact that religion has lasted this long means that that its true. Great logic. A Christian boy next to her followed up by saying that if it weren't true people wouldn't have died in the name of it, which is a repetition of what the teacher had said in the previous class.\n\n- A Muslim asked ( since they believe that Jesus was merely a prophet and Catholics/Christians believe he is the son of God and God himself), why Jesus would pray to God(himself) in the forest and ask God to forgive everyone.\nNobody knew how to answer that, but the teacher, although he spoke at length, didn't answer the question either.\n\nI didn't want to leave you guys empty handed so [here](http://i.imgur.com/3hxXhY7.jpg)\n[and here](http://i.imgur.com/aJPM0J4.jpg) is just one of many assignments our teacher has given us.\n\n Maybe it’s just me looking at it the wrong way. I don’t know, but if you believe in God this assignment is pointless. You would change nothing.\n\nI actually got into an argument with the blonde girl, because someone asked if life was fair since to everyone it was agreed that pain was necessary, that it was part of God’s plan because you could learn from it. I distinctly remember how the teacher compared it to the pain of small children when their teeth are coming out.\n Nobody could answer me when I asked what was the necessity of a child starving to death.  This girl just cut me off,\n “My life is good, yes life is fair,” she said.\nShe didn’t take to kindly to me disagreeing, (since we were in the same group); I specifically addressed everyone, including myself. Us here, in this classroom, coming from privileged backgrounds, cannot possibly make that decision.\n “That doesn’t mean I haven’t gone through shit!” she replied, to which I told her that that was not the point I was trying to make. \nShe glanced at my assignment and saw that I had answered nothing, and said\n“God’s shoes are pretty large to fill.” \nShe has hated me ever since, but openly treats me unusually nice to make herself seem like the better person, neither of us are.\n What was funny and kind of sad is that I was probably the only one that didn’t answer the sheet, and everybody laughed off a Catholic brunette as if she didn’t know any better, when she innocently voived she would change natural disasters, making them not occur. Where is the ‘spoiled goodness’ in that? So many stories, it’s weird. At least I have gotten to read C.S.Lewis's and Athanasius’s accounts and many others, which have actually reaffirmed my position in all this. Ironically enough we read more outside sources than the bible itself in the course. \n ",

        "text": "Please excuse me if these thoughts are muddled, but it's 4 am and I'm exhausted. I have two thoughts that I'd like to discuss.\n\nThe first is dealing with Pascal's Wager. We all know how ridiculous this argument is and how often it's used in so many forms. The most common is a theist saying \"what if you're wrong?\" I don't have many interactions with theists that I just met, so it isn't often that I hear \"what if you're wrong?\" I am just thinking that it would be interesting to see what would happen to preempt the theists attempt at Pascal's Wager and say \"Oh you're a Christian? But what if you're wrong?\" I think the key to this is saying it without a hint of sarcasm. You could say it from a Muslim's point of view, or a Hindu's, or a Jew's, or whatever. Preferably with a religion that has a hell equal to or worse than the Christian hell.\n\nSo I would say, \"Oh my goodness, you're a Christian? Don't you ever worry what is going to happen if you're wrong? You'll burn in hell forever! I am just worried for you\". Next time I have the opportunity to use this I will, but if any of you have done something similar or have the opportunity, let me know!\n\nThe other thing I was thinking is that all of these debates about where morals come from without a deity telling you what to do are completely pointless when it comes to a practical reality. They may be in a interesting discussion to have from a philosophical point of view, but when it comes to reality they are pointless. We can sit here all day arguing about where we can get morals without a god, but at the end of the day it is clear that whether or not we know (and we do) where morals come from, we know that atheists CAN be moral. We see this just by looking at people like Bill Gates. So if someone is saying, \"Where do your morals come from without a god?\" I simply respond \"it doesn't matter, because we do. Look at the world, and look at the atheistic community, and you can see all the moral acts done by them (us) as a whole, and you can see that we are capable of moral actions. So even if we didn't know where we get these morals, it's clear that we have them. Any discussion beyond that is frivolous\".\n\nThoughts?\n\n\nEDIT: Rather than respond to individual comments, I'll just post here. I don't think that Pascal's Wager is a good argument. I think that it's a terrible argument but I believe that by using it before the theist has an opportunity to, you can expose the flaws to them by having them counter it themselves. How many times are Christians asked \"but what if you're wrong?\"? I'd say close to zero. On the other hand, they ask this question so many times without realizing what a bad argument it is. I just propose flipping it around on them before they can say it to you.",

        "text": "I found this argument in the /r/atheism index, and did some further research myself.\n\nThe argument states that:\n\nI. \"What it is\" vs \"That it is\"\n\nConsider the definition of something. A dog. A dog is a carnivorous mammal with four legs, a tail, and a snout. But just from knowing what it is, we cannot tell that it is. I.e., that it exists. We have to go out into the world to see if dogs actually exist:\nOr consider the Higgs boson. This is the elusive particle that physicists were looking for using large particle accelerators or \"atom smashers.\" They knew that the Higgs boson had certain properties, such as a specific charge and spin. But they did not know whether it existed, and for this reason built atom smashers such as the Large Hadron Collider. Again, we could know what a Higgs boson is but just from that not know that it exists.\n\nSo for most objects of our experience, their definition, or essence, does not entail their existence. In other words, these objects are not the source of their own ongoing existence. So since their ongoing existence does not come from themselves, it must come from outside them. In other words, they must be dependent on other factors for their existence. For example, a lake does not entail its own existence; its existence is maintained by warm air, gravity, and so forth. But these factors also do not entail their own existence, and we see that warm air depends on a source of heat, and gravity depends on mass, and a source of heat depends on nuclear reactions, and so on.\n\nThis leads into a regress…\n\nII. Dependent Objects Imply an Independent Object\n\nWhat kind of regress are we talking about, here? We don't mean a regress stretching back in time, but rather a hierarchical regress of dependent members here and now\nIf object A does not entail its own, ongoing, existence, then it must depend on other factors for its own ongoing existence, as we saw. But the same applies to those other factors. Now consider a chain of clamps that only stay closed if held by another clamp\nThe only way this chain of clamps will stay closed if there is at least one \"permanent\" clamp holding shut one of the clamps, which then in turn holds together the rest of the clamps. One clamp must be \"independent\": not held shut by any further clamps\n\nSimilarly, if object A is receiving or dependent on further factors for its ongoing existence, and those factors are themselves dependent upon further factors, then this must terminate in something not dependent upon any further factors.  \nTo put it another way, all these objects whose essence (what it is) is separate from their existence (that it is) must trace to something whose essence is its own existence. That is to say, existence itself.\n\nIII. Existence Itself = God?\n\nNow that we have arrived at the conclusion, existence itself, what must this thing be like? It must be eternal, as existence cannot not exist. It must be immutable, as nothing cannot exist and so existence must always exist. It must be unchangeable, because change entails a gain of something that was lacking, and a lack of something is the non-existence of something, and existence itself cannot have non-existence. It cannot be material, or have spacial location, or exist in time, because all these things entail change. It must have all positive properties to a maximum degree, because anything less than maximum would entail a lack of something, which is non existence. This would entail such properties as maximum power, maximum knowledge, and maximum goodness.\n\nThe original explanation of Al Farabi's cosmological argument (with pictures) is found [here](http://rocketphilosophy.blogspot.com/2013/12/al-farabi-and-avicennas-cosmological.html)\n\nIs this argument sound?\n\n",

        "text": "Hey Trueatheism, I've studied a lot of apologetics/anti-apologetics arguments and want to share some of them with you guys.  The first one I want to show you is the problem of hell.  I've got a **TL;DR** at the bottom if you want to see if the argument seems interesting before you read.\n\nThis problem is an argument against the idea that (the Christian) God can be in any way just/good/fair while still having hell.\n\nFor our purpose here, we will interpret hell as being a place of infinite punishment (a claim I don't think too many would disagree with).\n\nThe problem with hell is that the entry requirement is either impossibly vague or arbitrary.  I'll explain.  There are really only 2 ways I've seen Christians say will determine your afterlife: sin and belief in Christ.  First, let's assume it's sin that determines your afterlife.  \n\nIf this is the case, then how much sin gets you hell?  Is it 300 sins?  Does each sin get a point value and its your sin points that sends you to hell?  No matter which way you do it, there's going to need to be a clear cutoff for heaven vs. hell.  And that's the problem.  One single sin would be the difference between ETERNAL PARADISE and ETERNAL TORTURE.  This is a huge justice problem, since people who are almost identical in worth are getting completely disparate rewards/punishments.  This cannot be a just system.\n\nNow let's suppose the Christian says that only belief in Christ will get you heaven.  How much belief?  Belief isn't an all or nothing matter, we all believe things to different extents.  You believe in gravity more than you believe that your drive to work tomorrow will be safe (maybe you only believe in your drive's safety to be 90% certain).  What's the belief cutoff for Christ?  Just like in the sin problem, we have an arbitrary cutoff that determines paradise or torture.  That ain't right.\n\n**TL;DR:** *The difference between going to heaven and going to hell is a microscopic difference in your level of sin, and the cutoff line would have to be arbitrary.  This isn't justice.*",

Even if you embrace the \"discussion\", you're still left with him talking over you the whole time, so there's never really any kind of discourse. \n\nWell needless to say his behavior and general uselessness has landed him in the position that he will almost certainly no longer be working here after his contract period is up. But in the meantime, we are having to deal with him. \n\nThis past week someone in my office (a Christian girl) mentioned her approval of equal rights for gays, and I voiced my agreement. I admit we shouldn't have been talking politics in the office, but anyway, he heard this and stormed out and didn't return for like 3 hours. During those three hours, he sent me several HUGE walls of text telling me that he left because we were saying things that are offensive to him \"as a christian\" and that we are out of line by talking politics in the office (holy shit, right?). So I bit my tongue and replied to him, \"I'm sorry. We will try to be more sensitive in the future.\" \n\nRegardless of my clear disinterest in a discussion, he started sending HUGE walls of texts for the next few hours, during which he (unprovoked) ranted about gays, blacks, and muslims and how they're all oppressing Christians. I did my best not to take the bait because I know a debate with him would be useless, but I did fall into it a few times. \n\nI know stories like this seem made up so I will upload some photos of his rants to me. Keep in mind I did not bring up most of the topics he rants about, and many of his posts seem to be \"responding\" to an invisible person and he rarely responded to what I said directly. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9lJEoWG.png\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/7TEusJW.png\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0JwPrBK.png\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/RCJSItv.png\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/kj6juFf.png\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3aPwAyK.png\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/KFuzKjt.png\n\n\nAnyway, later that day he came into the office and continued his political rants and conspiracy theories with another coworker, all of which were anti muslim and playing victim. He even had the nerve to say that Muslims are \"too sensitive\" when it comes to being offended about their religion. What a... fffffffffffffffffff\n\n-----------\n\nIn spite of his hateful ranting, he also opened up to me about how he feels so stressed out about these thoughts every day. He's a student, so I did mention where on campus he could get free therapy, and told him not to be ashamed to do it. I told him I went there a few times so that he realizes it's really ok to go there. \n\nAnd he told me a few things later in person that were pretty troubling. It went something like this: \"Man I come across A LOT of arguments that make so much sense and I don't know how to make sense of them with my faith, but then I just have to stop and remember what I believe and realize that Satan is a MASTER liar, and will make things make a lot of sense.\" \n\nI really think he has an anxiety disorder and maybe more. He's only 25 years old and I don't know how to help him. But also I can't fucking stand being around him. He's told me that he wants to make a YouTube channel where he talks about these things, and part of me wants to see it happen but also I realize he might be mentally ill and it could be wrong of me to let him ruin his reputation knowing his possible condition. But then again, maybe he's just really religious? I have no idea what to do any longer. I have to put up with it for another few weeks. \n\n-----------\n\nEDIT: Many of you are asking why I don't go to HR. Here's a quick explanation of my work situation: I work at a small company (smaller than 50 people) with no HR department. There are two departments here consisting of about a dozen people. There are two bosses; one of them is only here one day of the week and the other is pretty indifferent unless his income changes. They basically don't care about an employee until their review, which his will be coming up in a few weeks. ",

It would mean that something can exist and not exist at the same time. The logical ends of this explanation are tantamount to saying that your mother gave birth to herself!\n\n&gt;Recently, the world renowned physicist, Stephen Hawking in his new book The Grand Design argues that the universe did self create due to the law of gravity,\n\n&gt;“Because there is a law like gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing…”\n\n&gt;But his view on nothing, as previously mentioned, is not really nothingness but is space filled with the quantum vacuum, which is part of the universe. In essence Hawking is telling us that the universe can create itself, but it has to already exist for it to do that!\n\n&gt;Concerning the law of gravity, well that is just a mathematical equation that describes nature. This law is part of the universe, which can also be described as a force of attraction between material objects. Therefore, how can this force exist before matter, in other words the universe?\n\n&gt;To assert that the universe created itself would be absurd and self refuting, because in order for something to create itself it would need to exist before it existed!\n\nI'm not well-versed in Physics or Cosmology to argue against this,so to those who understand the topic well enough.Is this sound,did our universe really not come from quantum fluctuations?",

Sustainable species are ones that are able to cohabit their environment without taking advantage, right? So, as a 21st Century society who knows history, science and evolution, a remarkable feat for any species, and knows of the amazing technological things we do, should be able to realize the place we have in the universe, how we can extend our progeny through the generations as the ones before us have, why do we continue to pretend we are doing ourselves any good with how we live, pertaining to energy consumption, societal and economic injustice, things religion prides itself on dealing with, and, yes, global climate change? Is it really just religion and human apathy? Is it political weakness in facing oil prices and whatnot? We may procreate like the dickens, but unlike past human cultures, we don't seem to look to the future, to protecting those future generations. Am I alone in thinking this? Why do we do this?",

At least the Christians have morals so they are free from judgement. I sat fairly quiet when this was said because I am not out as an atheist yet. My question is So Christians can't be judged because they have morals. Where is this imaginary line of morality? How does someone determine whats moral to me isn't moral to you? Where is the standard? Is there no standard? Are we all making our own standard? I'm not advocating the bible as a standard or anything just curious.

        "text": "Apologies if this goes on for a bit, I'll put a **TL;DR at the bottom** so please feel free to skip to that if this ends up being too long! But I really feel like I need some help leveling my head again, it's late and I have 5 hours to pack up all my university stuff and get some sleep ahead of going back home tomorrow for spring break so I'm a lil bit rushed.\n\nSo we started off by casually discussing one of my housemates projects on her degree, which is currently concerned with the four types of immortality which are found in Stephen Cave's book \"Immortality\", a book which I actually already own and am half way through, which said housemate hasn't actually bothered reading. She's a graphic designer, and so even though ultimately they are going to be designing logos or brands, they are required to think in depth about the concepts first.\n\nThe conversation was long and very broad, and my other housemate joined in - as I've already alluded they're both \"semi\" religious.\n\nWe got on to the issue of whether god exists, and a plethora of circular and stagnant arguments occurred and circulated between us (very much them vs. me), which I'll list as concisely as I possibly can in bullet points so as to save time and energy (if required I am happy to elaborate on a bullet point in the comments):\n\n* The idea that the \"reward/punishment\" dichotomy of religious thinking (heaven/hell) as being a highly immoral and bad reason for people to do *good* or *bad* things - they argued that **everything** people do is selfish *anyway*, there's \"no such thing as a selfless good deed\" etc, so why is heaven and hell such a bad reason to do things? Which I argued against citing how human beings are quite social creatures and are capable of performing a good deed/helping another human for no selfish gain. Can someone point me in the direction of some sociological literature discussing these issues - i.e studies of social groups/beneficial community interaction?\n* Repeatedly, when I brought up examples of things which religion does or what religious people believe (i.e homosexuality being an abomination, that heaven/hell exist, the authority of religious texts etc) - my housemates would fall back on that trustworthy caveat of \"well those aren't *my* religious beliefs - **you** can't define my beliefs\" -- how can you debate or converse with people who's views are so nebulous and, for lack of a better work, fickle? It would seem that the more you question a \"moderate\" religious person, assuming they're not hard-line and entirely theocentric in their arguing (luckily that type of person is rare here in the UK), the more it seems that they don't actually solidly *believe* in anything? And it seems to be massively offensive for some reason to ask people to directly outline what they believe - sure, I want to know because I'll probably want to dispute it, but why does that situation exist in the first place?\n\n* I was accused of seeing everything far too \"black and white\", and not enough \"grey area\" - aside from this possibly being an actual character trait of mine (as a practicing artist and pretty liberal guy I really don't think it can be), surely the nature of scientific experiment and adaption is to exist in the grey area, to be open to all possibilities, and to only be certain of things which have sufficient evidence - is that being \"black and white\"? I don't like the idea of appearing so binary in my assertions, it makes me feel weird and ultra-dogmatic.\n\n* They said that I had \"faith\" in science, I pointed out that faith is the belief in something without evidence, and used the iphones which they had in their pockets as my evidence for scientific theories and the scientific method as being much further along than \"faith\" (the proven astrophysics of putting a satellite in orbit, the mechanisms and computing which make up the technology in a smart phone etc), they seemed to accept this, but still insisted that their belief in religious things (as nebulous and undefined as they admittedly seem to be) and my belief (re: understanding) of scientific things were fundamentally the same - are they?\n\n* A lot of talk about fate and destiny, specifically about the \"perfect\" conditions of the earth and solar system to allow human life to come into existence - surely this is a *very* biased and anthropocentric view of circumstances, seeing things from a purely human perspective - what is some good literature to read in response to what I believe to be naive and incorrect assertions about \"destiny\"; things about confirmation bias for example. I know quite a bit about the issues of predestination, but always welcome further discourse on the topic.\n\n* They said I used too many \"long words\" and I was too \"articulate\" to argue against, and that I was being belittling by doing so - I definitely don't want to belittle anyone or be rude, I really just want to converse with other people, was it my bad and is it okay to \"dumb down\" when around people who, by their own repeated admittance *\"don't read as much\"* as I do? Or is it okay to just stick to the way that you normally speak? I swear I don't try to fluff up my language or use unnecessary words, but maybe I do.\n\n**TL;DR** - have a look through a couple of the bullet points which are summaries of a long conversation I had with a couple of my religious housemates, any advice or information regarding books/essays etc that could help me out would be greatly appreciated.

I'm starting to become a bit worried that I might not be able to hold my own in an argument against a room full of staunch Christians, while not being rude or completely dismissive. \n\nSo I'm asking: do you guys have any advice/points/arguments for me going into this meeting?

For every emotion that you are capable of feeling, there is surely a belief that could invoke it in a matter of moments. Consider the following proposition:\n\n&gt;Your daughter is being slowly tortured in an English jail.\n\n&gt;What is it that stands between you and the absolute panic that such a proposition would loose in the mind and body of a person who believed it? Perhaps you do not have a daughter, or you know her to be safely at home, or you believe that English jailors are renowned for their congeniality. Whatever the reason, the door to belief has not yet swung upon its hinges.\n\n&gt;The link between belief and behavior raises the stakes considerably. Some propositions are so dangerous that it may even be ethical to kill people for believing them. This may seem an extraordinary claim, but it merely enunciates an ordinary fact about the world in which we live. Certain beliefs place their adherents beyond the reach of every peaceful means of persuasion, while inspiring them to commit acts of extraordinary violence against others. There is, in fact, no talking to some people. If they cannot be captured, and they often cannot, otherwise tolerant people may be justified in killing them in self-defense. This is what the United States attempted in Afghanistan, and it is what we and other Western powers are bound to attempt, at an even greater cost to ourselves and to innocents abroad, elsewhere in the Muslim world. We will continue to spill blood in what is, at bottom, a war of ideas.\n\nEven in context, I find Harris' argument flawed because it depends on the premise that if you know a person's beliefs, you can predict their actions in any given situation.\n\nLet's use his example. Say I truly believe that my daughter is being tortured in an English prison. In such a situation, I have no moral problem with using violence to save her but that doesn't mean that l intend use violence to save her. There are many factors that influence my ultimate decision. Perhaps I have other children and I have to care for them. Perhaps I believe that my chance of success is so low that I don't want to throw away my life just to do something that won't help my daughter. Perhaps I'm just a total coward. Even if someone believes that violence is permissible in a certain situation, it does not follow that he intends to use violence.\n\nAll you can get from a religious text is the belief that violence is morally permissible in certain abstract situations. There are a myriad of ways that this general moral belief can be applied to a certain situation. All you can be sure of is that a person *might* use violence under certain situations. And that's true of everybody, religious or otherwise. **There is no belief that automatically makes the believer resort to violence.**\n\nTL;DR: Harris argues that certain beliefs will automatically lead to violence, which justifies killing them in self-defense. I disagree. There is no belief that automatically makes the believer resort to violence",

I've dabbled in thinking about the idea of there being some sort of ethereal \"force\" in the world that we have no control over or idea of, but these are just thoughts that I play with sometimes. At the end of the day, I generally believe we are bags of meat who are basically just highly evolved animals. I *do* firmly believe that human beings should strive to help each other and make the world a better place for all of us through good works/attitudes towards fellow humans and philanthropy, but this doesn't really have anything to do with religion. Aside from being an atheist by definition, I like to consider myself an egalitarian-Humanist (buzz words, basically). I was raised Catholic but denounced the faith as soon as I moved to America and turned 18 after having some brief but powerful personal experiences and analysing my own religion. I've never looked back and never considered another religion.\n\nMy wife is hard to describe. She was raised as/by a pretty stereotypical by-the-book Christian. However, she rebelled a lot and did not follow many of the Christian teachings. Yet she still holds on to the belief in a God and the power of prayer/positive thinking, and she is one of the most philanthropic/charitable people I know as a result of the teachings focused on serving others and being generally good to others. She doesn't preach to people and doesn't force her beliefs on anyone, least of all me. But in recent years she has struggled to reconcile her beliefs in a higher power and her rejection of a large part of Christian teachings.\n\nToday she sent me some links. She claims to have found a religion that better suits her belief structure and attitude, and she wants to have a long discussion with me about it on our roadtrip tomorrow. The links she sent me are [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1'%C3%AD_Faith) and [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-r-friberg/bahai-creation-evolution-debate_b_4721219.html). It's called the **Bahá'í Faith**.\n\nI've flipped through what she sent me, and I honestly can't find too many things to disagree with. Their basic principles are striving to serve others through good deeds and philanthropy, using prayer and meditation to become closer to God, humanity, and nature, and that all races and religions are to be treated with respect/admired. They seem to believe that all religions come from the same place/one God, and that their God has basically left things up to interpretation. The Bahá'í God is too big to understand or bother him/her/itself with our lives, but being a generally good person is basically the best way to do this Gods will.\n\nThe only main contention I had was with their teachings on homosexuality and sex and drugs; they supposedly believe that sex should only be between a man and woman inside the sanctity of marriage, and that non-prescribed drug use is a bad thing as physical health is of large importance in their religion. *However*, modern teachings are basically inconclusive on homosexuality; they emphasise that we shouldn't judge or shun homosexuals and they shouldn't preach that it's wrong, so the religion is basically undecided on how to approach it because they claim to accept homosexuals into their faith. So that's a bit of a sticking point.\n\nBasically, I'm not looking to discourage my wife from pursuing this new interest; she's never given me shit for being an atheist and I've never given her shit for believing in God. We both agree that unless it negatively impacts someones life, our personal beliefs are our own and do not warrant attack/ridicule.\n\nWhat I am looking for, those of you who know about Bahá'í Faith and/or read the links I posted, is some talking points. We've got a long drive tomorrow and I want to address any important factors that she/you may think are pertinent. Top of my list is their thoughts on homosexuality/drugs/sex, but I'm looking for more.\n\nAgain, I'm not actively trying to discourage my wife from pursuing this new religion as on the surface it seems like I'd be a lot more comfortable with her identifying with *this* religion than Christianity. It's always irked me that the charity work we do is marred by unnecessary preaching and proselytising, claiming that the only reason \"we're\" doing these nice things is because God told us to. This Bahá'í Faith seems to advocate doing nice things for our fellow humans because it's the right thing to do, not because God demands it/is blackmailing us for entry into heaven. I fully support her subscribing to a faith/religion that makes her happy so long as it is not detrimental to anyone in any way.\n\nI just want to be able to chat with her about it.\n\n**TL;DR** - Wife wants to talk about a new religion she's discovered that she feels fits her belief structure and attitude more than Christianity. I don't want to discourage her from it, I just want to point out/discuss anything that could be a major sticking point if she decided to subscribe to this new faith.",

        "text": "For many years now I've considered myself an atheist.  I grew up an evangelical christian, but other than being expressly told that the god of Abraham is the creator I saw no evidence to support this claim.  So, I looked elsewhere for answers.  I studied Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Taoism, and any other religion (ancient or current) I could find, but still found no answers that made any sense.  \n\nSo, after my studies failed, I came to the conclusion that the gods of man are little more than stories.  Just men barking in to the darkness, trying to peddle an ideology or social control.  Funny enough, when I stopped believing I was no longer terrified that the invisible forces of Satan were trying every second of every day to take my mind away from me.  Essentially, the monsters went away when I stopped believing in them.  I still hear them from time to time, but I now know they are just the machinations of my own minor psychosis, so I ignore them.\n\nBut I digress, I've always prided myself on having a very open mind.  That is, I always want to consider any and all possibilities.  If there's one thing I do believe it is that all things are possible until proven otherwise.  This includes the god of Abraham and all other gods of man.  It isn't that I believe they exist, it's that I believe that there is a remote possibility that they do.  However unlikely it is, I still consider it a theory, as we have no definitive way of determining if there is or isn't a \"god\".\n\nUpon further mulling of the god question I hit on an idea that to me seems more likely than the concept of a personified, the universe itself makes for a pretty convincing 'god'.  I don't mean god in the sense that most would think of it, I don't claim to know if it has a will, a plan, or a purpose.  What I do know is that universe is responsible for the making of new elements, atoms, planets, stars, galaxies, and even the basic laws of physics (gravity, particle reactions, the speed of light).  And from these mechanisms we have been born, the material that makes up our bodies must have first been cooked in the heart of a star, then that material had to find its way here.  \n\nFrom the universe comes everything, life, death, and everything we can conceive of that is between the two.  For it a new thought might be a star, a nebula, a galaxy, super nova, black hole, or even a new species (sapient or otherwise).  It isn't that I'm endorsing this idea as truth, but to me it seems far more likely that the natural forces we can observe are responsible for our existence, not some magical absentee father figure that blinked us into life.\n\nMy question is this: Is there a man-made religion that sates the theory I just put forward?  I'm mostly just curious about it, all knowledge is worth chasing.",

        "text": "My girlfriend and I have been together for about 6 months and things are great. Our relationship is loving and supportive, generally just really healthy and awesome. I can see things going right and us spending the rest of our lives together. However, there is always a little nagging thing in the back of my mind that probably shouldn't worry me, but does: she is Christian.\n\nOur religious beliefs are no secret from one another; she knows that I'm an atheist and I know that she's Christian, and up to this point it hasn't been an issue. She loves discussing the ideological differences that are there, so talking about them never turns into a fight, just a good discussion. We've talked about it a few times, and this is what I've gathered:\n\nHer father is the son of a pastor, and married her mother when they were both in their 30s, largely due to their equally devout belief in God. She now attends church largely in part due to the social aspect and the family pressure to continue to go. She does believe in God, but that belief doesn't play into her day to day decision making save for attending church. She says that the combination of the social, community, and worship is just a feel good experience for her, which I can understand. Her religious upbringing has certainly had an effect on many of her morals, though she says that she's currently in a phase of reworking her religion and her reality. Socially she doesn't carry any of the conservative ideals associated with Christianity, and she also doesn't let it interfere with her understanding of science. I guess what I'm trying to say is that religion is certainly no cornerstone of her life, but it's also not just a remnant of her upbringing. It is something that will be a lasting part of her life.\n\nAs I write this I continue to think how silly it is that I would even have to ask such a question, but I suppose in the same way that she gets comfort from the community in church, I can get comfort from the community on reddit. Does anybody have any thoughts about dating a theist?",

        "text": "So there are only a handful of pre-schools for my son.  He just turned 3.  \n\nHere's an example of Hobby Horse's curriculum.\n\n**Spiritually**\n\nWe believe that God is the center of our universe. We share with the children Bible stories and religious songs that are child appropriate and provide a Christian lesson. We pray before our daily juice or snack time.\n\nThis bothers me so much that my son will be taught these things at such a young age.  But in order to avoid it, it looks as though I have to avoid school prior to public school.  I feel like it shouldn't bother me this much.  He will believe in Santa, and when he's old enough he will be told these things are not true.  He's 3.  He doesn't really care if Adam and Even REALLY existed or not.  \n\nThere are a lot of churches and religious organizations that do these types of pre-schools.  There are barely any secular ones.  And the ones that are secular usually require that your child be under developed in some way.  He doesn't have to enter the 3yr old pre-school, but I would like him to.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEDIT:  Just wanted to clear a few things up.  That description was just one of many, but it was the only one that talked about religion.  I think it would be a smaller part of the overall class.  Also this is pre-preschool pretty much.  3yr old preschool, there will be another 4yr old preschool next year.  Then kindergarten.\n\nThanks everyone for your thoughts.  I have decided that he will be going to some pre-school.  Assuming my thoughts are right and they focus much more heavily on the kids and not the religious parts.  I will of course want to see curriculum and probably come sit in one a class or two.  But I think it's worth it.\n\nAlso a side note, I will not be teaching my kid that religion is malarkey and only stupid people believe it.  I will only merely be telling him it is what some people believe, and he needs to take a look at everything in his life skeptically, reasonably, and logically and only then make the decision for himself.  I don't really want him \"indoctrinated\" in either direction.\n\nI don't know if it was here or somewhere else that I read about a good idea of using Santa as a good stepping stone for reasonable thinking.  So once he is old enough to question Santa, you ask questions as to why he doesn't believe.  What doesn't make sense about it?  Don't listen to your friends, just decide for yourself if it makes sense.  It's a good critical thinking exercise to question what you have so far always thought was true.",

How far can one take it till it is hate speech? Where to draw the line? One popular example is WBC harrassing people at funerals, however I've done some reading and here in Europe street preachers have been arrested, and I even read of a pastor being arrested for a homophobic sermon. I guess my question is the following:  is there a line where your right to **religious expression and right to free speech** impinges on the rights and freedoms of others(i.e. gays, women), or is acting on these beliefs where a 'line' is crossed.

        "text": "EDIT: I suppose I should have given more details. I was probably about 10 years old at the time, so I never knew much of the back-story but here goes... \n\nIn the 80's my family attended an evangelical church with about 200 members. The church was somehow associated with a larger group of churches, and a group of about five pastors came to town one week to hold what I think they called a \"presbytery\" (google disagrees, but whatever). Each night of the week, a set of families would take turns going on-stage to be prayed over. The family would go up there and kneel in front of a set of empty chairs, resting their elbows on the seat cushion, fold hands, close eyes and pray silently (no eye-contact involved). The visiting pastors would then take turns praying out loud over each member of the family and make statements and predictions about each person and how they fit with Jesus' plan. We actually still have a audio tape of this somewhere at my dad's house. \n\nAnyway, when they got to me, there are two things that I remember vividly. Firstly, they said I had a natural desire to take things apart and put things back together again, so I was going to \"take apart the word of god and put it together so other people could understand it.\" This was a definite hit. I was always a tinkerer, and am currently an engineer, so this always stuck with me as some sort of real supernatural thing. The other main thing I remember, which was a definite miss (mostly) was that they said I was very organized, which I was not - am generally not - and likely never will be. But I can be very organized, if I put my mind to it and my laziness doesn't get in the way. \n\nAnyway, that's about all I remember for my own so-called prophesy, but there were other things that were dead-on for my brothers, sister, and parents. ...But there were definite misses too.
