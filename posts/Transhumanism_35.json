        "text": "Allow me to elaborate.\n\n\n\n\nThe Six Million Dollar Man, Captain America (Marvel MCU), Gabriel Vaughn (Intelligence), Daniel Jackson (Stargate), Kiera Cameron (Continuum)  are all transhumans. They were given augmentations to enhance their physical and physiological capabilities to beyond that of ordinary humans. \n\n\n\n\nThe Six million dollar man is a superhuman cyborg, Gabriel has complete mental access to the internet, Captain America is a peak/superhuman, Kiera is physically and cybernetically augmented, and Daniel Jackson has been a demigod like being at least twice. In all those portrayals, their enhancements have been presented as overwhelmingly positive, and the characters even more so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there are transhuman*ists* in pop culture who do get bad portrayals, e.g. the Red Skull,  the tranhumanist in Intelligence, the guy in Agents of Shield, etc.\n\n\nSo, it seems slightly confusing, no? Why would the ideology/its adherents be portrayed as creepy, slightly (or fully) sociopathic individuals, while the end goal of tranhumanism is portrayed as cool? \n\n\n\n\nMy theory, the transhumans themselves arent transhumans. At least, they dont adhere to the common ideas and goals of transhumanism. In addition, the actual human enhancement itself is never really referred to as transhumanism with any frequency.\n\n\n\n\n* Six Million Dollar man? He got his abilities after an accident. He didnt choose them\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Captain America? He just wanted to fight bullies, and he saw the enhancements as a means to an end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Gabriel Vaughn? He wanted to find his wife, and saw the enhancements as a means to an end.\n\n\n\n* Daniel Jackson? He wanted enlightenment, and the abilities were more of a bonus.\n\n\n\n\n* Kiera Cameron? Shes a cop, and its part of her equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNone of them really went \"I want to be better for the sake of being better\", they went \"I want to be better because this will let me help people/will let me get what I want\". \n\n\nNow, one could argue that its anti-intellectual to a point \"portraying the results without the hard work involved\", but no, in many cases the people responsible do show up, and their work to get the results is acknowladged.\n\n\n\n\nSo what is it about transhumanism itself that makes it seem creepy in pop culture? \n\n\n\n\n\nIt all seems to come back to the whole concept of \"I want to be better\". While I'd wager many transhumanists mean themselves and the whole of humanity, the idea of transhumanism seems, at a glance like a selfish power fantasy to many. Like a more realistic version of wanting to fly, and shoot laser beams. \n\n\n\n\nBasically a guy can have incredible power. He just cant get it for wanting its sake. It needs to be under duress, or to achieve some higher noble goal. And nearly as important, *he needs to be like us*. Maybe a bit smarter, or stronger, hut still fundamentally an average Joe, with no grand wishes of transhumanism. Because if he does, then hes power hungry.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there are more positive portrayals of transhumanism in thing like comics e.g. Iron Man. For a while he was a blatant transhumanist, and transhuman with the Bleeding Edge Armour. He even referenced the frailty of ordinary human tissue after he enhanced his eyes. And unlike the others, he didnt neccessarily *need* to get all those enhancements, but he did it anyway for want of being better.\n\n\n\n\nAnother example is Warhammer 40k. One of the most popular groups there (Space Marines) is all transhuman, and transhumanism is portrayed as a good thing for the most part.\n\n\n\n\nSo, what do you think? Do you agree/disagree?\n\n\nTl:dr being transhuman is fine, being transhumanist is thought to be power hungry.\n\n\n\n\n",

Rather quickly I made up my mind that it would be my number one goal, aside from ensuring my families continued existence, that I would \"bring him back\" as it were once the technology became available hopefully in a few decades if the technology arrives rapidly enough. From there the connection between my own thoughts and Shinji Ikari's father Humorously entered my mind although I'll assure you I am neither a genius nor intent upon turning humanity into an ocean of orange goop to reanimate my significant other so do not worry. I was just wondering if there were any others out there with similar ideas?",

        "text": "After having received a surprising amount of support and interest from academics all over the world, I'm glad to share that our website is almost done and our forums are now live. For those out of the loop, you can read more about TIATA [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/4akdga/ata_the_academic_transhumanism_association/).\n\nWe are now encouraging those who were previously interested to either contact us by email at AcademicTA@mail.com or send me a PM answering the inquiries below this paragraph, along with credentials ( [example](http://www.kth.se/profile/nioe/) ) and verification ( [example](http://i.imgur.com/XRcSoWT.png) ) . Those who have already verified themselves previously do not need to do so again, and have been provided with the forums and website link by PM. Please PM me if you have not received a message.\n\nFull Name: \n\nEmail: \n\nCity, Country: \n\nEducation: \n\nLevel of Education: BSc/BA, MSc/MA, PhD, Other.\n\nWe're currently in the middle of talking to several entities of a possible affiliation, and a lot of excitement is on the horizon. In addition, we now have the capital funds to start up our website and we are looking for writers and curators with academic background whom wish to reach out to both academics and the represent transhumanism to the general public for educational and argumentative purposes.\n\nWe already have members ranging from doctors to engineers, from all over the world. We hope we can reach out to more academics (undergraduates, graduates, and professionals) to join this intellectual collective movement towards accomplishing great scientific feat together, and further advance human boundries. Every academic is welcome, whether you are an engineering student or hold a degree in Philosophy or Ethics.\n\nImportant to note: We require all members to adhere by rules in argumentation theory and refrain from using any fallacies, manipulation of information, or irrational bias within the community. Default moral stance in scientific discussions is amoral. Individuals consistently irrational and/or incapable of logic reasoning will have their membership terminated.\n\nIn case of inquiries, simply contact me by PM or [Halfspire](http://www.reddit.com/user/halfspire). You can also reach the association by email at AcademicTA@mail.com . You can also leave a comment on this thread.\n\nThe website and forums link will be public once they've been entirely set up.",
