By October I had read 26 and so I thought I would push on to do 30 books by the end of the year. Come October and my dad passes away, the week he passed I read On The Road by Jack Kerouac as I had just started a few days prior, then after that. Nothing. Come 2023 and I set my goal of 30 books once again, see if I can smash it this time, I read Kafka on the Shore in Janurary but it took me 3 weeks. Now it seems like everytime I pick up a book I just get bored after a few pages and my mind wanders and I put it back down again.\n\nI've tried reading different genre's to get me back rolling into it, tried the Siege of Terra series, tried finishing Lord of the Rings, tried going back to Dune, 1Q84 since I love Murakami so much but nothing is sticking for me. I'll get about 100-200 pages in then just stop either due to boredom or I'm just not soaking in the words themselves.\n\nHow do you guys keep motivated to keep reading? I try setting myself goals but then I just constantly look at page numbers everytime I turn a page and it becomes a chore. I've tried reading different books but I feel guilty about starting new books as I've already started the previous 3 and I just can't be arsed with them. So I'm a little stuck on what to do since I want to read but it's not working out for me.\n\nAnyone have any advice on how to knock myself back into the swing of things?",

I thought that reading a GOOD book from a woman's perspective could help him see the world differently.\nI'm not hoping for his enlightenment, but for him to understand that he's on the wrong page.\n\nAre there any good books that show women's everyday struggles, the pressure on them in society, their worries? It would have to be modern, so nothing too vintage or he'll justify it by saying that \"everything has changed\".\n\nI'm looking forward to your ideas! :)",

That includes POC LGBTQ+ and people of a different gender. But I got some replies to that post saying that it doesn’t matter what gender or race an author is, and that it’s fake to want to be inclusive simply to be inclusive. I even received a few messages bashing me for being a troll and virtue signaling. And I was genuinely a bit taken aback by this. I never once though that my request for books by women would lead to negativity. I just wanted to diversify my bookshelf and read some good books that were written by women because they deserve to be read just as much as any book. Can someon enlighten me on why there was such discourse over this? Was I actually in the wrong in some way? Is it bad to want to read diversely simply to read diversely?\n\nBy the way, for context that I didn’t think mattered, I am a woman.",

Six clones wake up on a spaceship not at all according to schedule, and they try to find out why their sudden awakening happened, why the control room is full of blood and why the artificial intelligence that runs the ship is unavailable. This is where the investigation begins, seasoned with the discussion of many ethical issues related to clones.\n\nThe best is the flashbacks of the characters, from which you can learn a lot about the world in which the story takes place. The scenes taking place in the spaceship, which most intensify the conflicts, were overwritten, a lot of them could have been cut.\n\nUnfortunately, the AI ​​is completely characterless, not interesting, neither evil nor mechanical - even though it is one of the most important characters in science fiction, which is partly why we read this genre.\n\nBy the end, the story gets tired, the characters talk and behave in the same way, and instead of a unique, characterful detective, they find out who the killer is together.\n\n7 points out of 10 for all of this, overall a pleasant and entertaining novel, it didn't put me off the author, I'm curious to keep her new book, [Station Eternity](https://murverse.com/writing/station-eternity/), on my radar, as it is considered even better by the SF critics.",

(Idk, one or two after they live at the circus.)\n\nI wish I’d seen the series to the end, but … I dunno, I got bored with it.  At some point the books required too much cumulative suspension of disbelief to be taken at face value, and had too many open plot holes to be taken as effective fantasy.  Each subsequent book was reading, at least in basic plot, like a clone of the previous ones:\n\n1. The orphans go somewhere new (Point in the “win” column: Handler does have an art for writing imaginative and macabre settings, not one of which I remember finding dull.)\n\n2. They are welcomed by one or more authority figures.  About half are downright malevolent; the rest are stupid, craven, or both.  None of them show any sympathy for the poor kids — two homeless, recently-orphaned middle schoolers and the baby they are raising alone.  Well, some do, but none who live to tell the tale.\n\n3. Enter Count Olaf, the world’s dumbest villain and distant-2nd dumbest human being overall, with Mr Poe and all the other guardians (except Monty and Esmé) in an ignoble tie for first).\n\n4. The man wears disguises that any blindfolded orangutan could see past, but when the plucky kiddos try to tell an adult they are scoffed at, in a conversation with more or less this structure:\n\n*”Yo, you know that new teacher/firefighter/accountant/concert pianist named ‘F.O. LaTunco’?  He isn’t [occupation] at all!  He is a COUNT — a count named OLAF!”*\n\n*”Nonsense!  I specifically asked him ‘Are you Count Olaf?’ and he said ‘no’!  And just to be sure, I made him promise he wasn’t lying!*\n\n5. With no outside support, whatsoever, from anyone (poor babies), they put their respective skills to work in ways that — another solid W — are clever and even instructive.  I like the literary and scientific references; kids’ books where the heroes are avid readers and learners are rare gems.\n\n6. Mr Poe shows up to yell at them for something stupid, they unmask Count Olaf, everyone is *absolutely stunned at this revelation*, and he runs away.\n\n7. The cycle of doom repeats.\n\n\nNow about those plot holes.  Yes, I get that there’s a magical-realist-steampunk motif, but two big ones still bug me:\n\n* In the first book, they are whisked away from Justice Strauss — not even allowed to spend one night with her — because she is not a relative.  But with the exception of Olaf himself, *neither are any of the other guardians*.  There’s an old Chinese proverb that says “you can’t be related to a village.”  Wise words; you also can’t be related to a boarding school.\n\n* Seriously, was Mr Poe working with Count Olaf?  Even setting aside the first plot hole, I simply refuse to believe that any independent adult — never mind a wealthy bank executive — could be *that* dense.  The first time not recognizing Olaf, fine: the kids could be traumatized, having flashbacks, whatever.  The second time?  I’ll allow it: it may well seem far-fetched that he’d put on a second disguise given how sort-of-miserably the first one sort-of-failed.  I will not allow a third chance, Poe, let alone a sixth or seventh.  Get yourself examined for brain worms *immediately*.\n\nTo be fair, Handler did make things interesting by adding new puzzles to each books (the eye tattoo, the Quagmire triplets, “VFD,” etc.).  These were effective cliffhangers for the first, say, six books.  But even fantasies need internal logic, and with fundamental, show-stopping questions — at least the two big ones listed above — remaining unanswered after twelve or so books, that logic started falling apart.  All the codes and secret organizations and schisms were like bricks being added to the top of an increasingly wobbly Jenga tower.\n\nThe books lends itself well to the visual, and I like the Netflix series a lot and am not too far in.  Given all the above plus the roughly-20-year hiatus since I stopped reading the book series, I’ll probably just fill in the gaps with the Netflix show and move on.  So please, stop me now if I’ve got it all wrong and need to go back before I finish watching.  \n\nOr — yaknow — just tell me your own thoughts :)",

I've heard all sorts of things against him, and I never thought seriously about reading his books. Only recently I read his book from 1919 and was blown away by his introduction, which is brilliant and perfectly poetic.\n\nAnother author who surpassed my expectation was Jack Black, a thief from the 1900's. *You Can't Win* by Jack Black is one of the greatest books I've ever read. It hit me so hard the first time I read it that I was crying even before anything had really happened. It has all the elements of a great story and yet it was written by a person who based his life on stealing from other people. \n\nWhat author surpassed your expectations?",

So for her birthday, I would like to take her to a library where she is surrounded by books, can choose any book she wants, and read for a whole day. I think a library would be perfect for that, but most libraries are either meant for borrowing books, for sitting down and doing research, or just nice to browse in and look at. But I'd like a really cozy library, where you can lay down somewhere, maybe on a nice couch, or even a bed, order drinks, snacks, maybe even a meal.\nUnfortunately, I cannot find a library like this. Or a bookshop. If I Google for it, I just find beautiful libraries (usually old ones) that are just pretty, not cozy. \nIt would be best if this library were in Europe, but not necessarily.\n\nI hope this question fits this sub.",

        "text": "Hi everyone! First post here, so I’ll give some back story to what just happened:\n\nBackstory:\n\nCurrently, I’m (25 f) SERIOUSLY struggling with choosing a career path. I had a decent idea of my direction, then covid happened. I made a big move to another state living with relatives and I’m overthinking everything because the careers I’m thinking of are VASTLY different… it’s gotten to the point where I haven’t made a career move in 2 years. It’s been debilitating for me. Anyway, my mom has a friend who works with people that are struggling with situations like mine and got me in contact with her to help me out.\n\nLong story short, today she and I went through situations that I tend to overthink and she mentioned that they all seem to deal with things in the future- things that we don’t know will even happen. Said that [rough translation] a lot of times she sees this when people fear losing control in their lives, and they sometimes end up actually losing control by overthinking to the point where they don’t do anything-like me.\n\nBack to the title:\n\nShe then randomly asked me what were some of my favorite books growing up. I instantly thought of (1) The Hunger Games, (2) A Thousand Splendid Suns, and (3) the “Matched” series by Ally Condie- read #3 in elementary school so they’re very easy reads lol.  Then she asked me do I think I relate to the main characters at all- to which I never thought about and said “I don’t think so I just really liked the stories”- especially dystopian ones because I know I enjoy the escape. So then she had me think about the general themes of those books.\n\nAnd then it hit me: In all of those books the main character(s) have no control whatsoever in the society they live in and throughout the books they are continuously trying to gain control of their lives. And it was insane to me how almost all the books I’ve enjoyed over my life (there’s more as well) have to deal with the complete loss of control. And even more insane is that I’m now at a point in my life where I’m realizing that I have that fear.  Absolutely blew me away.\n\nSo my question to you all reading: what do your favorite books say about you? And if you haven’t thought about it I urge you to and you might find something there.",

        "text": "I only learned about how the book series when the movie adaptation came out and how it got panned by the fans. Now, terrible book-to-movie adaptations are nothing new. Just look at Eragon, Girl on the Train, etc…but most of the time the book fans just go “Welp. That sucks” and move on.\n\nWhat surprised me is how Percy Jackson has the most PISSED OFF fans! It’s like it’s impossible for the fans of the books to simply ignore the movies. Everyone of them have something angry to say about it! If you go to any comment sections of any reviews of the Percy movies, I guarantee half of the comments are something like “In the books, they xxx….this movie missed that.” \n\nMeanwhile, reactions are more lukewarm outside of America, or at least in Asia. When the movie was announced in my country, a lot of people just go “meh”. Yes, it’s not great, but we don’t really care about it. I guess some children will get entertained by it, but most of us just see it as “diet Harry Potter” and nobody gave a lot of attention. Almost nobody heard of the books.\n\nThat’s why I’m so surprised at how angry Western fans are! Is this book series part of every American’s childhood or something!?",

This sentence was passing through the mind of our fighter, just before the enemy soldiers clashed with the shields of the standing heroes, unyielding and with hearts full of courage, to defend their beloved kingdom. Not long ago, it was proud like a maiden, and now invaded by occupying forces that attempted to crush its purity.\n\n\nA bloody and ferocious fight takes place. Here, beasts take the place of men. It is a battle where the weak die and the strong lose, a fight devoid of sense and reason where all the military discipline that these soldiers have is drained into an incomprehensible chaos. Out of fear, pride, love, or pleasure, humans kill each other without knowing if luck is on their side, without knowing if their army is winning or losing. All that goes through their minds is 'kill or be killed.\"\"\"\n\nThats it, hope you enjoy..",
