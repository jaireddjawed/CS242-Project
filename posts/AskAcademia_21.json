        "text": "I'm a geoscientist by training and work with dynamical models, but my current work relies on a lot of biological literature, which tend to discuss statistical models. Very commonly,[ I come across graphs like Figures 1\\(c\\) and \\(e\\) in this paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abg4351). These graphs plot statistical models and the associated uncertainty, on top of a scatter plot of observations the model was fit to. If I were to eyeball the scatter plot in Figure 1(e), I'd say the two variables look completely independent, and the uncertainty associated with the model does not appear to bear _any_ resemblance to the actual scatter of the data. I'm assuming this is because of my lack of understanding of the methodology so, if there are any biologists or statisticians who know what I'm talking about and could point me towards an explainer, that would be appreciated!",

This advert is actively discriminating the young generation of male astronomers who have nothing to do with the choices made by other males before them.\n\nImho having these kinds of adverts will not solve EDI issues in academia. In fact, adverts like this only highlight the incompetency and biases of interview panels and selection committees, who should undergo proper EDI training challenging them, instead of just sweeping dust under the rug by only having women apply. If a university is truly committed to EDI, then surely this seems like a more effective strategy. \n\nBesides, I think it's hard to justify this approach without recognising further discrimination against other groups. Black males are also massively underrepresented. Those who were born female but identify as men as are also discriminated by this ad. \n\nAny thoughts anyone? I'm genuinely open to hearing views that differ from mine, because I don't understand how Universities can pull this off.\n\n [https://jobregister.aas.org/ad/1fe76d8e?fbclid=IwAR015sy5hLEkLNd84AxTKhEjzkYGKLaujjaorO7ctYtI0RYM\\_T\\_xszz88Tc](https://jobregister.aas.org/ad/1fe76d8e?fbclid=IwAR015sy5hLEkLNd84AxTKhEjzkYGKLaujjaorO7ctYtI0RYM_T_xszz88Tc)",

Or I could wait until January after classes resume, but honestly Im really stressed out and don’t like when things are uncertain and I feel like I need to do something instead of waiting... Would it be best to wait until January or should I just send emails now?",

It has been really difficult getting both the courses I want and research positions in labs I wanted to work in while applying. I want to know how I can make the most of the 2-3 semesters remaining. I will be joining a research group next semester,so that's a positive at least. \n\nA few things I would love to tackle-\n\n1) It's super hectic,or am I just not good enough so I feel that way? One stark difference from my UG days in India is there's not enough time to address issues,not explore outside of what's being taught! In my undergrad if I tripped up on an advanced concept there was ample time to go back and work on it ground up. Another thing was when I was taught a concept I had time to go around reading relevant literature. The past semester I haven't had time to do either of these things,which has been very disheartening.\n\n2) Why coursework? So somehow I am not able to grasp the idea of how I can use the course to my benefit. Like it's okay,I do well in assignments,homework,exams and projects but I am not seeing the bigger picture.\n\n3) How to publish?! So if this is the state with coursework,how am I supposed to publish? I joined the Master's program because I was rejected by all my PhD applications and this was my fall through option. But if this is the state I am not confident if my profile would be as good as it was out of my UG! How do I change this?",

My research interests are in cybersecurity and I have already explored some of the areas and have gone through some research papers. My supervisor has suggested the below ideas. So,  I would be grateful if you could look at the below ideas and let me know how I should start implementing them as my goal is to publish a paper at the end of the thesis work.   \n\n\nIdea 1 : \n\nThere are a lot of methods for password generation and cracking. Example, we have hashcat, john the ripper, markov models, adversarial/GAN based models and grammar based models which are used to compare the hashes of a desired password against a dataset/wordlist. And we have standard datatsets like rockyou, ashley-madison datatset, linkedin leaked datasets, etc. But, there is no concrete paper on evaluating all the above models on a standard password dataset and benchmarking these. So, we would like to propose the results of evaluating all existing models on a standard dataset  \n\n\nIdea 2 : \n\nMethods like dictionary attacks use a wordlist that consists of most probable passwords. By comparing this wordlist against the input password, one can crack the password. However, the wordlist size is limited and contains passwords of the entire world. We could customise this wordlist based on regions. Ex: we could create a new wordlist for Indian region, and another one for Chinese region, etc so that the passwords can be cracked much more efficiently (for this we assume that we have the region from where the password hash was collected). And, we could build this dataset and evaluate the results of running hashcat or dictionary attacks on this dataset and prove that this dataset helps in increasing the number of password hashes cracked.   \n\n\nPlease feel free to suggest any other ideas as well in the domain of \"password cracking\". The only concern is that the work should be novel and I'm really looking forward to publish at the end of my thesis.   \n\n\nI would be very grateful for your help !",

The negative one seemed to not really understand and even fully read the paper, so my collaborators and I decide to resubmit the paper to PRL after careful revisions. (For those who are from a different field, PRL and PRA belong to the same publication organization -- the American Physical Society, so they share the same database. The biggest difference is that PRL is a more prestigious journal and receive papers from all fields within physics, while PRA is less prestigious and is specialized in publishing the papers from certain fields of physics.)\n\n\nMeanwhile, we received an email, just a week after our PRL rejection and before we resubmit our paper, from an editor from PRA, which reads the following:\n\n\n&gt;The editors of Physical Review A and Physical Review Research have examined this manuscript and all related correspondence. We encourage you to transfer it to one of our journals as a longer more detailed Regular Article.\n\n\n&gt;In choosing the journal, please be aware that Physical Review Research is a fully open access publication and, thus, article publication charges would apply.\n\n\n&gt;The prior correspondence suggests that further review is required, but a complete and persuasive response to the referee comments and/or a suitably revised manuscript may make this unnecessary.\n\n\n&gt;In the longer format you can include any material that would benefit our readership. To publish the strongest and most useful paper possible, it may be better to present some or all of the current Supplemental Material in the paper itself.\n\n\n&gt;If you transfer your manuscript, please include the usual summary of changes made and a response to the previous reports.\n\n\nWhat does it mean? Does it implies that the paper is interesting enough that the editor of PRA deemed it worthy of publication such that they even sent us an email, encouraging us transfer the paper, just in case we submit it elsewhere? Has anyone experienced this before? Can someone share their experience? Thank you!",

I also started my paper (and turned in a literature review) a few years before the academic paper came out. the section I am worried about is two paragraphs in a 50 page paper. \n\nmy thesis is public online and while I don’t think that many people read it, I am a journalist and it comes up in my first page of google results. the plagiarized article is from a small magazine/journal that is heavily paywalled and if you run my thesis through a plagiarism checker nothing comes up.\n\nthe plagiarism was not intentional - I was a bad and sloppy student then, working full-time and it took me four years of random cobbled together work to finally turn in a thesis. what I think happened is that I put notes/quotes in an outline unattributed (or attributed and I ignored or missed) and when I went back to it, months later, I wrote them into my paper. it was stupid, not the way academic work should be done and is not how I work now. not sure if the fact I cited the paper itself elsewhere helps my case.\n\nfeel sick about this and wondering if you had advice on what to do? get in touch with my department and ask to amend? not sure if that’s common after multiple years? volunteer to give up my masters degree?\n\nthank you so much.",

And I recently heard in school that the Internet was originally meant for academia.\n\n\nI don't doubt the educational side of the Internet can supplement or even rival school, however optimistic this sounds. \n\nExamples of such online resources:\n\n• YouTube channels like 3Blue1Brown, Amoeba Sisters, CrashCourse, Numberphile, Mathologer, SmarterEveryDay, The Action Lab, Tom Scott, Vsauce, and Zach Star.\n\n• Online tools, like Khan Academy, Desmos, and Geogebra.\n\n• Regarding both previous bullet points, they also often have Twitter accounts, which can act as another platform of communication with their communities, and I have no doubt they have insightful communities.\n\n• Sub-Reddits like this one, r/AskComputerScience, r/AskHistorians, r/AskPhysics, r/askscience, r/biology r/chemhelp, r/chemistry, r/computerscience, r/learnmath, r/math, and r/Physics.\n\n• Discord Servers, like the main mathematics server, the main science/technology server, and the Coding Den.\n\n• Wikipedia is pretty informative, even if it is not 100% accurate or reliable.\n\n• This is the biggest counterstereotype here, but even (other) social media has educational influencers, like @Why_axis_ on TikTok. These are more of small supplements though.",

I’m hoping to get one or two published papers before I apply to boost my CV since while it’s not unheard of in my discipline (theology) it’s not very common and would make me stand out (and help with my slightly subpar GPA as a result of Hebrew).\n\nI’m really proud of my term paper this semester, I think with a few tweaks it could be at the level of a publishable article but I know that technically my professor owns it. \n\nWhat I’m asking is, is it a waste of time to ask my professor about working with him to turn it into a journal article? Is there even a process for that or do I just have to accept that the work I put in will only go as far as a grade? \n\nAny tips from people who have tried similar things or from professors would be helpful.\n\n(Edit: grammar and formatting)",

I went on the job market this fall and recently received an offer to interview for NTT full time instructor position (Southern US) w/benefits at an R1. It’s a 3/3 teaching load, with research and light service commitments. Bonus is that the position basically lines up perfectly with my area of expertise. Not sure what the salary is but after doing some research it looks like 55k is the median. I’m single with no children so that amount is adequate.\n\nI figure that there’s no harm in interviewing. Worse case I’ll get rejected and get some experience with the process, etc.\n\nHowever, my question is more hypothetical in nature. Say everything goes well and I’m offered the job. It’s 12 hours away from my hometown and I’d be on a 9 month contract w/the possibility of yearly renewal. The uncertainty of the job is a bit unnerving and I’ve also heard that being in an instructor for too long kills your chances of moving up the ladder. \n\nWould it be worth it to consider the position should I get an offer? I feel like with the job market the way it is, I should be grateful for anything and jump at the first offer but….I’m not sure.",

        "text": "Hi y'all… I know a similar question has likely been asked in the past but I'm in a bit of a predicament.\n\nI'm applying to grad schools next month, and all my schools require 3 letters of reference-- I sent out emails to my prospective referees with the request around a week ago. Since I graduated more than 3 years ago, and didn't take some of these people's classes in like… 5 years or so, I was skeptical of whether or not they'd agree to my request.\n\nSurprisingly, the referee I was LEAST confidence in saying yes (because while I did really well in her class, it was in 2017 and I really wasn't sure she'd remember me) ended up responding within an hour to my email agreeing to write me a letter (mind you, I sent the email on Sunday night). As for the other two, it's been complete silence since then.\n\nI sent another follow up email yesterday, and still, nothing. In similar reddit posts I often see commentors advising for people to go to the prof's office hours and ask in-person, but that wouldn't be an option for me on such short notice, because I no longer live in the country I attended university in.\n\nI'm starting to feel really antsy and nervous because if they don't respond, I won't be able to submit my application. I have one professor in mind as a potential back-up whom I will be emailing soon, but I have no back-up plan if BOTH professors don't respond. I'm sure I can scrounge together a letter from a random prof but I don't think it would be very strong.\n\nI'm really stressing out right now. On average, how long does it take for referees to respond to reference requests? I had a pretty strong relationship with both of these professors, and thought that there's no way they'd refuse (my back-up was in case my third professor declined, since I thought she wouldn't remember me). Now I'm feeling really panicked that I won't be able to apply to grad school after all.\n\nAs you can tell, I'm clearly spiralling. Does anyone have any advice for how I can act in a situation like this, if I'm unable to see them in person? At what point do I just give up and realize applying for my Masters just may not be in the cards for me?\n\n\nEDIT: Given that I'm applying for a 2-years Masters in Social Work, an alternative option is to just apply for the Bachelor's in Social Work instead (also a 2 year program), and then do my MSW as 1-year after that. It would take me a year longer than my current plan, but at this point I'm really worried about my options. The BSW only requires 2 letters of reference, and once I'm admitted I can then get more recent, FRESH, reference letters from profs that are actually teaching me in real-time when I apply to my Masters.\n\nThe only thing is that if I decide to go that route, I'm not sure how I'd explain it to the first prof who already agreed to write me the letter. I don't want her to perceive me as fickle and unreliable if I'm changing my plans so last-minute and end up reconsidering the reference letter, but I feel like my options are really limited right now.",

Right now, I am doing a 60 ECTS MSc in Social, Health &amp; Organizational Psychology with a focus Social Influence in Utrecht, Netherlands. One of my bachelor thesis and the master thesis I am writing right now both focus on Human-Computer Interaction. Additionaly, I worked for multiple years in advertising creating digital concepts, quite a few of them data driven of AI focused. I have an okay-ish statistical understanding and know the general methods of social sciences. After this master, i plan to start another one either at the University of Amsterdam or in Tilburg, and I struggle deciding a little right now. In Amsterdam I would  focus on [political communication](https://www.uva.nl/shared-content/programmas/en/masters/communication-science-political-communication/political-communication.html), which is super interesting and a gateway to politics, which could be a possible field for me. Additionally, Amsterdam in the #1 University for the subject worldwide and I think this is kind of a big deal. How often do you get the chance to study at such a top-rated university? On the other side, I would love to get a general understanding of data science, since i believe this is booth a safe option career-wise and a good way to boost my chances for a PhD-Position afterward. That is why I also checked out the [MSc Data Science](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/education/masters-programmes/data-science-and-society) and Society in Tilburg. Now again, I am not sure wether I will be able to finish that degree, since I have no coding experience at all and never worked with any form of big data so far. Additionally, since I might wanna do a PhD afterwards anyways, I believe I could be able to build that knowledge alternatively while do so? But maybe somebody can share their experiences: How hard is it to get an acceptable level of understanding of Data Science on your own?",

I would get a technician for the first handful of years and lab space... but the amount of funding is about half of what I was hoping for. I am of course going to see if we can bump that up.. but it seems ridiculous to think they would double it.. and that value was kind of the low end of what I was hoping.\n\nI could see myself happy at the TT position, but I would have to move states. It's not so much losing the community I've built (although that's part of it), but more so the fact that my research is in agriculture and building relationships with local producers and agronomists is important, so it has to be a consideration.\n\nI am someone who enjoys academia, but I would not be devastated if I was not a professor, although I hope to be one some day.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/zmnraw/considering_to_do_a_phd_in_international/",
        "text": "Hello, \n\nEver since graduating with a MA in European Studies in 2011, I've been thinking about doing a Ph.D. I've always loved university environments, from when I first toured Cambridge University at age 16 through my time studying at universities I've attended in Europe and abroad. I feel so energetic just being there. I've been told I'm the teacher type (which I could see myself doing, specifically at a university), and I think I would love to earn my money undertaking research, publishing, teaching, attending conferences, etc. If I would win the lottery, I'd travel with my family for fun and research/write/surround myself with books for purpose. I've tried all sorts of other careers and I've never felt at home or happy with the work. I feel like if I don't do this, I'd always regret not trying.\n\nPreviously, my financial/family situation didn't allow me to undertake this intense \\~5-year project while making NO money etc. But now, financially we might just make it work. That being said, I'm extremely insecure. I cannot recollect the number of times I've reached out to people to ask them for informational interviews, only to feel too insecure to move ahead. I have so many thoughts that hold me back:\n\n1. Is my picture too romantic? I don't even know what the reality of doing a Ph.D. is like, what are the downsides? \n2. Related to that, I have a family with young kids so that's a fact, but don't other people with kids combine busy, hectic jobs with deadlines, too? Genuinely interested: how bad does it get? \n3. My knowledge feels stale and I feel like I forgot a lot. How do I bridge the gap?\n4. How do I get back to working and thinking academically after working at such a 'tactical' level all this time? Writing newsletters vs. a thesis? Would employers see me as equipped for the job if I get a Ph.D., after working operationally for so long?\n5. Related to the previous question, how would employers view my 'colorful' resume (several relevant internships but no publications to my name, working in IT for a couple of years, then freelancing as a copywriter, and now working as a communications officer)? The purpose of the Ph.D. would be preferably to pursue a career in academia, perhaps someday work as a researcher/adviser in a think tank. \n6. Am I too old? How could I compete as say, a postdoc, at age 40  (am now 34), with the kind of 23-year-olds that have finished 5 internships by the time they were 19 and are currently running for president?!\n7. What if I can't find a relevant job at all after I complete the Ph.D.? We're hopping from one global crisis to the next, job insecurity abound, and if I'd again fail in getting the job I want I'd feel like an even bigger loser. All the effort of getting a Ph.D. and then ending up as a comms adviser again (nothing wrong with comms, it's just that I want to do something else), only set back by 5 years. :/ (P.S. working as a comms adviser in a university setting no, too confronting/depressing.)\n8. Is it a bad sign that I don't have a specific research idea yet, as I'm now just considering whether to do a Ph.D. or not? I previously contacted a potential supervisor, and he said only to do a Ph.D. in case of a Burrrning research question, whereas I was thinking I would explore and research a topic through the Ph.D. and then teach/expand on that knowledge later on in my career. Again, too naive?!\n9. Is it a bad sign that, besides raising our two kids and working in unfulfilling jobs, I haven't had the energy to follow developments in the field I'd love to work in? \n10. On top of that, my former BA thesis adviser told me that only high-potentials (ambitious internships/work, publications, etc.) get into paid Ph.D. programs (not in those words, but that's what she meant, also subtly pointing out that I don't fall in that category, \\*note taken\\* LOL). What does that mean, I couldn't teach as an unpaid Ph.D.?!\n\nI wonder if after so many thoughts anyone is left reading, but would love your thoughts/insights on ANY of my questions! :) \n\nThank you, thank you, thank you.",

I plan to use some of it for the thesis, but the initial literature review that I am doing is perhaps more useful because it helps identify gaps and overlaps - That provides the rationale for my work.\n\nSorry but I am finding it challenging to organize my thoguhts, and narrow the scope of my topic so that i have concrete questions.\n\nThank you",
