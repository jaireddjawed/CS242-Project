        "text": "Hi r/Watches! A few months ago I became obsessed with watches (thanks to you all), and have been reading everything I can about Horology, the history of the industry, what makes one watch better than another, and how movements have evolved over the years. \n\n\nOne problem with this is that the more I see, the more I wish I could own everything I come across, which just isn't sustainable. So, to keep this new habit under control, I made a spreadsheet. Every time I come across a watch from this sub, or /r/Watchexchange, that I would love to own one day, or just think is interesting, or (in the case of the first 25 or so), want to remind myself exist for less than $300, I add it to the spreadsheet. I've hit 100 today, so I figured I'd share this monstrosity with you all in case there's another new addict out there who wants a tidal wave of possibilities. \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ3zGgw5RY3k77U5cRxgghkoeRHbCpyfXtNY1o1tGfV5zLE1BjicMIdixWBfLgbQEtU2AKDsSrLWoCK/pubhtml\n\nI've published the sheet to the web to hide my google account, so I apologize if the formatting is terrible. Also, please feel free to shout out anything I should add! It's FAR from an exhaustive list of what I see here, and looking back over the past few months, I actually hate a lot of what I've added previously, which just goes to show how quickly my tastes change and why I shouldn't be trusted to buy everything I like. \n\n\nThank you all for the new hobby, it's driving me insane.",

The person at the boutique informed me that they had none of the white divers left unless I was willing to buy one with a damaged box, he assured me that only the box was damaged and as a result I would get a £400 discount. I wasn’t really bothered about the box but I loved the design so I bought it and went on my way, and keep in mind this is an official Bell &amp; Ross boutique. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\non January 10th the date indicator stopped moving. I had taken it swimming the previous day so I assumed it was my own fault and I didn’t properly set the crown. So I schedule a service and send it away. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2 weeks later I get a call directly from someone at B&amp;R telling me that the watch I sent them was fake and they ask a bunch of questions including where I bought it, how much I paid etc. The person who phoned me actually refused to believe that I bought it from a Bell &amp; Ross boutique, she even called me a liar, anyway she put me onto someone who had authority and more than 3 brain cells and I explained the situation about the damaged box, discount etc. He was very understanding and seemed to know what he was talking about, he casually mentioned that if a watch is returned within 30 days it can be resold as new without so much as a warning to customers as long as it’s in the same condition, however he admitted that I shouldn’t have been sold a damage box at all. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked what I can do going forward and he said that he’d have to check to see if they can replace the watch for me or if other steps need to be taken, he said that I should start proceedings with my bank to report the error and try to get a forced refund there. He said in the meantime he’d open a case for me and update me when something happens, I get a case number email an hour or so later.\n\nAbout a week later I get \\[this email\\]([https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/294603307199102977/1084252197900009613/6538e0f3e6baf90ade4009cfe0263214.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/294603307199102977/1084252197900009613/6538e0f3e6baf90ade4009cfe0263214.png)) directly from B&amp;R where they shut down my case because they don’t deal with fakes. \n\nThankfully I had enough proof that my bank were willing to refund the payment under their fraud protection policy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy personal theory: someone bought the watch, swapped it with a fake, returned it to B&amp;R who either didn’t know or didn’t care to authenticate it and then sold it onto me.",
