I also have a number of ungrounded metal components surrounding it which are getting quite hot, almost certainly from eddy currents. If I ground these to a ground plane at multiple points across the components, would that reduce their heating, or make it worse? I see transformer design reduces the size of conductive regions to fight eddy currents, so would grounding help? The ground plane isn't getting warm, likely due to its large size and high thermal conductivity.\n\nA very rough image of my situation.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/zDU1l5S.png\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/7jxtms/bootstrap_capacitorswhy_do_they_work/",
        "text": "It seems like bootstrap capacitors are used often as an easy way to drive the gate of a high-side NMOS, but I don't quite understand why the mechanism works. \n\nFor example, let's say the high-side NMOS initially has its source at 0V. One end of the bootstrap capacitor is connected here and thus is also 0V. The other end is charged up via a diode to, say, 5V. Then the NMOS turns on and let's say it brings its source up very close to its drain (let's say 8V). So, now the source is at 8V, so this terminal of the bootstrap capacitor should also be 8V...and the theory says that now the other end of the capacitor is now 5V + 8V = 13V...but I really don't see why it wouldn't just stay 5V. It seems the voltage across the capacitor stays constant...but why? Why don't you just end up with -3V (5V on one end at 8V on the other)?\n\nI guess my question applies to voltage doubler charge pumps as well, for example:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6_JKemTKzo\n\nI understand that with the first set of the switches you get \"V\" voltage across the top capacitor, and with the second set of switches you get \"V\" voltage across the bottom capacitor. The conclusion then is that you have two capacitors in series with each having \"V\" voltage, and thus you get \"2V\" across the series combination...however, it seems like to me that as soon as you charge the bottom capacitor to \"V,\" you effectively end up with 0 on the top capacitor. I know that is wrong (otherwise these fundamental circuits would never work)...but I can't see why it is wrong.",

I find that my current antenna isn't too reliable (it was cheap, no wonder) so I'm in need of an upgrade. However, it leaves me pretty confused which antenna would even be suitable for me (my budget for this is up to about $30)\n\nSome info: it will be placed inside a metal box (there is no way to place the antenna on the outside of this). I also will be unable to position it in the right direction, so it should be omni-directional. It will have to connect to the 850/1900 MHz bands, and can have any type of connector (uFL, IPEX, SMA, FME, doesn't matter). Due to the format of the metal box it should be compact, no more than about 100mm in length.\n\nAfter a lot of searching I finally came across this thing: http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/398/TG.22.0222-1220968.pdf Which costs $10, judging by the figures is omni-directional (almost perfectly circular on all axes) and has up to about 4.2dBi gain at 1900 MHz (which will be my main my frequency). For the record, I'm not planning to use it with the Sierra GL module mentioned in the sheet, but with my own MCU.\n\nAm I missing something here, or would this be a great pick? Anything I find that claims even higher dBi are huge and would never fit in a 100mm box.\n",

I have an indicator LED for the motor I'd like to drive at 5V. \n\nI thought I'd simplify this by instead of driving the LEDs from the MCU, to have them light off the motor supply. Less pin usage on the MCU that way, less complex software, and they couldn't possibly get into any sort of faulty state since if the motor is off, so is the LED and vice versa. \n\nMy initial solution is to just get several 5V regulators and hook them up to each motor power line. This strikes me as inefficient in terms of board space. Searching for something like a \"voltage regulator array\" yields things that seem far out of the scope of this project. \n\nIs there a more common/elegant way to do this? I suppose I could use resistors to make a voltage divider but that strikes me as wasteful by drawing unnecessary power. ",

One thing that has alluded me and is concerning IMHO that I can't seem to grasp is how they define values for static mismatch.\n\nIt seems that the consensus in PV designs is that mismatch accounts for 0.5 % of the losses including aging this can sometimes vary up to 2.5% although It boggles my mind (and I might just be thinking stupidly) that the value used is 0.5%. It seems to me that there are a large amount of factors, for instance have some modules aged more than others, is PID present, is soiling present, how much degradation has taken place and of what kind(adhesional,packaging, moisture) The type(thin film, poly,etc) and quality of the module. \n\nHow is this all quantified into a 0.5% value that is generally used in plant design. Even in literature, I have found a lot of variation in the value, although the companies I've spoken to swear by 0.5%.\n\nI'm a recent grad just trying to understand losses and the courses I've taken really only provided a vary basic base knowledge in how to design plants and how renewable work.\n\nHonestly any help to help me overcome this hurdle in understanding will be appreciated, or even a book,article or anything that can provide a form of assurance in the measurement methods.\n\n\nMy apologies if this is a very idiotic question and again thanks for any help!\n\n\n\n**EDIT: Wrong sub?

Architecture team for large chip company X, dealing specifically with power architecture and analysis, might also involve performance modelling, etc.\n\n2. A verification role for CPU cache systems with another large chip company Y. Involves advanced comp arch knowledge of everything cache related. Interested because inner details of CPU interests me, but I am worried about how much I'll care for cache coherency, virtual addressing, OoO systems, etc.\n\n3. Another verification role but for an SoC dev team focused on HW security, also at company Y. This one seems interesting due to the combined aspect of functional and security verification.\n\nThey all sound interesting, but architecture and verification are very different and they all deal with different domains. I'm hoping there are some people that can answer some of my following questions and/or share some insight with regard to my jumbled thoughts:\n\n1. My concern with architecture is that I may be stuck doing more C++ modelling of new arch ideas instead of being closer to the hardware (verilog models). The role changes depending on my focus with power stuff (more focused on prototyping, especially with Verilog) and performance stuff (C++ modelling). Any insight into what chip architecture involves and career potential there?\n\n2. My concern with the verification roles is that I'll be stuck in verification forever. So even though I like working with Verilog and like being in the “nitty gritty” of the designs, I do want to eventually move to a more implementation/design focus. I’m just wondering how easy it is to move from verification to design or even architecture eventually if that’s what I end up wanting to do.\n\n3. Which verification team (CPU cache vs. SoC HW security) seems more useful and/or has more exciting opportunities in terms of career growth, tech innovations, etc.?\n\nApologies for the jumble of ideas here.

Just the HP IOs on the middle Pmods.\n\nOur **fall-back** is to just take **image data in via** the **Raspberry Pi and** squirt that via **UART or SPI into the Arty** to demonstrate parallelized image processing.\n\nHowever, the disparity between input-output rates and the rate at which our configured logic can process the image is so significant, we feel it's a waste of an FPGA.\n\nI have perused **XAPP894, IOSelect resources for Artix-7 devices, and the IP catalogs in Vivado for CSI-2 Rx/Tx IP, etc.** I think we can get the IP on a uni license.\n\nA faculty member helping us is keen to fabricate a custom PCB for bridging MIPI to other standards (like the LVDS_25 on the Arty). If I can bring him a viable design for this bridge he will get it fabricated. I think he might even take care of the PCB design as long as I can bring him a circuit schematic that will work. \n\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**My questions to y'all :)**\n\n1) should I go with a passive RC network (p10 of XAPP894) for D-PHY compliance or use a vendor-bought bridging IC? \n\n1a) if an RC network, then how precise/accurate/tolerant do my passive component values need to be?\n\n2) should I be simulating this bridge for signal integrity, say with Ibis in Altium, before submitting the design? (I have zero exposure to Altium, let alone simulating for signal integrity)\n\n3) should we just consider **switching to a Zedboard** (there are a few floating around upstairs) if it has MIPI D-PHY compliant ports? Or is the challenge of a custom bridge worth it? (I am a virgin with this stuff, very little experience)\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\n*any other advice, comments, recommendations, jibes or anecdotes are more than welcome*\n\nThank you.",

I have tested all the components individually, and they all work as intended.\n\nMy problem occurs when I connect the components at the same time, where the Arduino kind of shuts down, and I am unable to communicate from my computer to the Arduino.\nIs this a power supply problem?\n\nCurrently I have only tried it while powering from my PC USB port, and from a powerbank USB (2 Amps) port. Should I buy some other power supply.\n\nFurther the project is supposed to be portable, so this kind of limits my options when it comes to power. Would something like a 9V battery be able to supply more power than a 2 A USB powerbank can?\n\nI am using a Arduino Uno, a Grove Base Shield V2, Grove CO2 sensor, Grove GPS module and a SD Card module. The system will also feature a few other sensors, but not untill a find a solution for this power issue.",

Primarily, what I need to get familiar with are System Verilog, Python, and Assembly Programming (probably more towards the ARM side rather than x86). Now please don't think that my school doesn't teach this stuff, long story short I transferred into Computer Engineering so I missed out on the classes that teach this stuff and etc. I found an old course website from my school on Python, so I'll use that as my primary source for that, but the other two I feel like I need better/more material. I've found another old course website over Digital Logic from my school I can use, as long as one from U of Michigan. I think I need to really try to get better w/ my assembly programming, because my prof really didn't spend as much time on that subject as I thought he would (we only had 3 Assembly Programming assignments for this entire semester, all at the end).",

        "text": "I've been working on a project for over a month now which involves some wireless control of outdoor lights, and chose to use the RFM69 packet radio (based on Semtech SX1231), since I used it once before on some Adafruit dev board with Arduino.\n\nI'm current writing all the firmware for the project for an STM32L0-based MCU, so I have to port all of the code over from the RadioHead library that I originally used for the proof-of-concept in Arduino. I've spent a few weeks slowly porting the the RadioHead library, and have had some success so far, but it's far from complete, and it's quite painful getting this thing to work properly with my STM32L0 MCU. \n\nDoes anyone have any experience in developing firmware for ISM band / sub-GHz packet radios like the RFM69, RFM95, LoRa transcievers, etc. for simple wireless control applications like my lighting project, or have any advice to share about that? I've seen simple (but expensive) sub-GHz transciever modules that basically act as a serial-over-radio sort of link  (like those HC06/05 BT modules), but they're way too expensive for the design. Also, I've thrown the idea of using ZigBee or Bluetooth out the window due to interference and range issues in the 2.4 GHz band; 915 MHz transceivers are what I'm looking for at this point.\n\nI'd love to hear any suggestions or past experiences any of you have in this area; RF links isn't really my strong suit at the moment, lol.

While previous versions of usb were just set at 5V and they varied their power by changing their current USB-C seems to be different.\n\nUSB-C, if I am understanding correctly, has several possible voltages to chose from, and the device being charged and the charger make a handshake before transferring power, to agree on the maximum voltage level that they both support.\n\nHaving said that, I am currently trying to find the cheapest USB-C charger for my 15 inch 2017 macbook pro, and have no idea what to look for. Is there a way to find what the minimum voltage the charger has to produce to be able to charge the computer? Is there a minimum current? I dont really mind how fast it charges it, as I plan to use it overnight while the computer is turned off. I know that my usb-c phone charger cant charge it, but not why. Also, aren't most computers now using lipo batteries which can be charged with low voltages? Why would there be a minimum voltage then?\n\nSorry for all the questions, having a bit of a hard time wrapping my head around the subject.",

I need to install a case mounted speaker for playing audio (i.e not an audio jack, but case mounted speaker).\n\nThere is, of course, a configurable audio header on the MOBO that supports either HD Audio or Legacy AC'97 audio. It's tempting to just wire up a speaker directly to that, but I can't seem to find any information on the load driving capability of those headers. I think they are designed for headphones, but I would like to drive something like this.\n\nhttps://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/cui-inc/GF0668/GF0668-ND/304440\n\nBy my calculation a 3W speaker at 8 ohms is going to take 5Vrms and 600mA. That seems like a lot for a MOBO to drive, but do they build these things with power amps built-in? From your experience, would I need a power amp between this and the HD-AUDIO header? 8ohms seems like a big load to me. If a power amp is needed, is there a nice compact solution for fitting in a computer case sized enclosure?\n\nThanks for any thoughts you may have. I know I could hack something together, but I'm curious if there is a go-to way to do this.\n",

I have a good understanding of electronics, c++ programming, and digital logic. My uncle, who is a computer engineer, gave me this MCU: http://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/cy8ckit-059-psoc-5lp-prototyping-kit-onboard-programmer-and\n\nNow I don't have any experience in embedded systems, but he said that this is a very good MCU and has excellent documentation. Would this be a good MCU for learning as a beginner, or too advanced? It is very small and I would have to solder header pins onto it to mount on a breadboard.\n\nBefore receiving this MCU, I had planned on getting an arduino, but have heard that they are not very thorough when it comes to learning. What do you guys think?",

I want to start getting into some ARM stuff, so I'm pretty sure the M0 is the entry point.\n\nJust wondering about how we access peripherals and GPIO using the M0. It seems to me like every chip that implements the M0 has the same baseline core inside them, then the manufacturer memory maps all their peripherals/GPIO as needed. When programming in C, there should be a library for the specific chip that abstracts all this away, no? I'm used to PIC uCs (in MPLABX) where if I want to write to let's say the SPI buffer, I just write to a variable that's defined in a header file to access that memory location. Can I expect the same level of abstaction, or do I have to create my own headers as for a chip from lets say ST or infineon?\n\nAlso, I've read a bit into one of ST's chips and it seems they use a DMA unit which has a circular buffer populated by a bunch of peripherals like the SPI and I2C ports. Assuming the answer to my above question is yes (that I can expect manufacturer-built libraries for peripherals), is this the case with peripherals that are accessed through a DMA?\n\nSorry if I'm being incoherent or missing the point. I just started looking into the M0 earlier today. Thanks.",

        "text": "Hey everyone, I stumbled across this subreddit while trying to find communities for the EE/CE field. I know my title pretty much states my overall question but let me give you guys a little bit of background on me and what I'm looking for. (TLDR at the end)\n\nI graduated back in May and had a job lined up as an Embedded Software Developer for a very small company (12 people in the office, about 5 of which were engineers) in North Austin. Fantastic, every engineers dream to actually have a job straight out of school. Well, long story short (I'll go in more detail if anyone really cares) they weren't a good company for new graduates/entry level employees. No training or onboarding program, nobody ever seemed to have time to be bothered with my more basic questions etc etc. I tried my best for about 5-6 months with them but they ultimately let me go after they realized it was going to take way too long to get me up to where they wanted me to be. I just don't think they really knew what they were getting when they hired a new graduate in ECE.\n\nThis was about 3 months ago, and have since been looking for a new job. I've had interviews, but mainly just those constant automated rejection emails. I've been reading a lot of old books and notes, going over code, writing some code, just trying to keep my skills up and be prepared for anyone to ask some obscure technical question. \n\nI've been in contact with technical recruiters as well, one actually who has a very good connection at National Instruments who I'm very interested in working for. I know that they don't make very competitive offers for entry level employees, but at this point compensation is the least of my concerns. I've heard they have a great onboarding program, are super good with new engineers, and actually make you feel like part of the team and teach you a lot of relevant stuff. Pretty much what I'm going for, just a good foot in the door of industry since I didn't get that from my previous job. \n\nNow, I worked really hard tailoring my resume for them and writing out a cover letter as well to try and show them how serious I am about working for them. Sent it over to my recruiter who sent it over to NI directly, however a few days I still got an automated rejection emails. I talked to a few people and ultimately ended up with this email from the hiring manager for the position: \n\n&gt; I spoke with the recruiters and hiring manager and the reason for not considering [My Name] further came down to his classes (the curriculum offered at [My University]) and class work experience being too high level for the open positions that R&amp;D has available at the moment. They are needing some very low-level driver programmers and didn’t feel this a match for him based on his resume. Please let [My Name] know we appreciate his interest in NI and to continue to look at opportunities on our website. If there is anything I can do for him, don't hesitate to let me know.\n\nNow, apparently (according to my recruiter) I'm not out of the waters yet since he's going to talk to them more this week about it. The position is for 2018 anyway, so I also figured I'd have some time to brush up on some super low level driver development (HAL stuff), FPGA/HDL stuff, and even just basic embedded concepts. Possibly with nice cheap boards and easy DIY projects that can be done quickly to illustrate and refresh someone on a lot of important low level/embedded C concepts. Or even just general advice, maybe from people who are familiar with what NI looks for. I'm planning on redoing my resume and trying to hit all the things they want so they can consider me further. \n\nSorry for the wall of text, I'm sort of all over the place since I lost my job and it put my in an awkward spot of being entry level and having 2-3 years of relevant industry experience. At this point, I'm just going back to the entry level jobs and hoping someone sees something in me and wants to talk further. \n\nTL;DR: Graduated with ECE degree, had job out of graduation, since lost job due to it not being a good fit, looking for new job, have nothing but time on my hands to read and do projects on my own, very interested in working for NI but concerned with how they think my experience in software is \"Too high level\", looking for solid online resources or courses to go through at my own pace to refresh/brush up on a lot of ECE concepts.

By connecting engineers into a community many great ideas will arise. You can use your own knowledge to help an organization. In exchange you will receive new insight from other engineers which is a great way to learn. Besides that, you will gain practical experience and the best idea(s) will be rewarded. In my opinion it’s a great way to show your knowledge and get rewarded for it. I think it's worth sharing with you guys. If you want to know more visit https://netsquads.com/",

Long story short, I'll be reporting regarding FM Noise Suppression, and though I think I got the low down, I just need explaining how the circuit actually limits such as the purpose of the components.\n\nI've already looked at multiple references but none really explain what I'd like to know. Here's the [circuit in reference](https://imgur.com/a/Sx423).\n\nI do get that it limits when the circuit reaches either saturation and cut off, but what are the purpose of those resistors, capacitors, varactors, and even R3 and transformers. Those I don't get.\n\nIf anyone can help me out, or even help me understand better how limiters work, that would be awesome.\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "\n\nAt least some hard drive file system formats have some ways for reducing harm from physical bit flips. ZFS might have best, from what have I heard. Some errors can be corrected and some bigger errors reported. That is on top of the methods that hard drive firmwares have in themselves.\n\nWhat if error happens in processor or ram memory? For some users who are willing to trade lots of performance for safety, there could be some software-only solutions.\n\nMaybe some programs should work such a way that everything gets computed 2 or 3 times and stored in ram in 2 or 3 places duplicate or triplicate. If someone tries to do such in source code, the compiler might optimize it away and if optimizing is disabled the program would be needlessy slow. So a special compiler or new compiling options for existing compilers such as gcc and clang would be a solution. Also, should be possible to choose in source code the safety levels, what to compute once and what twice and what 3 times, or on how many cores something should be computed in parallel.\n\nHow about interpreted languages?\n\nOperating system kernels would seem to be the highest priority for such hardening, for those who want that extra option.\n\nIf a radiation hardened, bit flip hardened Linux kernel, Minix kernel or FreeBSD kernel is wanted, is it enough to compile the existing source code with a different c-compiler, or should there be some other changes too?\n",
