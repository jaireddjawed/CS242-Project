        "text": "(Reposting because I would like more answers)\n\nHow do I get over the mental block during conversations?\n\nRecently I’ve realised that I do have interests that I am passionate about (I could still do with getting more, but I do have them), it’s just that I seem to have a confidence issue or mental barrier that holds me back from saying things. Either I’ll be 1 to 1 with someone and my mind will be completely blank most of the time with no clue what to say, or I’ll be in a group conversation and people are talking and whenever I have something to contribute I’ll end up not knowing when to actually contribute or being scared to do so, which I end up regretting at the end. This happens especially when someone says their part and then someone else contributes and I struggle to find a wide enough gap to contribute and then the conversation ends before I say anything.\n\nI know I have to get over this block but it feels like it’ll take a long time of undoing.",

        "text": "In some face-to-face events (like language exchanges) I often ask or get asked for Instagram handles, by both guys and girls and even if I have barely talked to them. Most of the time I don't talk to them on IG but in some cases I do and then meet up. Sometimes I avoid asking because I'm not sure what to do if they don't have one.\n\nIf just before leaving you ask someone \"Hey, got Instagram?\" and they say no. What do you do? You don't push it and say something like \"Ah ok, see you next time then\"? If they want they can give you their number anyway. Asking afterwards for their number would look to pushy and not being straightforward. Is this reasonable? Or would it be expected to ask for their number too?\n\nThe doubt is focused on asking girls I'm interested on but would also be interesting when asking guys I get along with just in case I could grab a beer or something with them.",

        "text": "Being a pushover is a turn-off to most people.\n\nAnd it kills your confidence and self-esteem.\n\nIf you want to stop being a pushover, there's a skill you need to learn.\n\n**Setting solid boundaries.**\n\nWeak boundaries with other people is one of the biggest reasons for a lack of self-esteem, social anxiety and poor relationships.\n\nBut what is a boundary?\n\n*“A personal boundary refers to a psychological or emotional limit that a person sets for themselves in terms of how they allow others to treat or interact with them.”*\n\nBoundaries are the rules you establish to not let anyone f#ck with you.\n\nThey’re essential to living a great life where you’re free to be yourself.\n\nBut why do so many men struggle with boundaries? A few reasons…\n\n* **Guilt.** Feeling selfish for setting boundaries or sticking up for yourself.\n* **Fear of rejection or abandonment**. Thinking that people will leave you.\n* **Fear of conflict**. Thinking that things will get out of hand and you can’t handle it.\n\nThere’s many more.\n\nIf you have weak boundaries, for whatever reason, **this needs to stop.**\n\nA lack of strong boundaries costs you self-respect, creates inauthentic relationships and robs you of your personal power. By letting people walk all over you you’re telling yourself you don’t deserve better. It makes you low-status and lower value.\n\n**So here’s the game plan to implement boundaries on your own...**\n\n1. **Identify your values and priorities**. What’s important to you here? For example, if it’s important for you to be respected at work by your colleagues then you know what your goal is. Another example might be with your woman you might value alone time to feel free in the relationship. Get clear on what’s important to you and what your goals are.\n2. **Know your patterns**. What do you normally do? Let people walk all over you how? Do you pretend you didn’t hear them? Smile and laugh even if you’re offended? Say “it’s no problem” even when it definitely was a problem? When you know your patterns you can catch them before it’s too late.\n3. **Define your boundaries**. Once you understand your values and priorities, it's time to identify your limits and needs. Think about what you're comfortable with and what makes you feel uncomfortable or stressed. Write it down.\n4. **Communicate clearly and assertively**. Use \"I\" statements to express your needs and preferences, and avoid blaming or criticizing others. Be firm and confident, but also respectful and empathetic.\n5. **Stand your ground**. You will be tested on this. Expect it. Sit with the intense emotions of guilt and shame. Resist the urge to go back on your boundary, over-accommodate or apologize just for communicating it. Remember, you don’t need to fix their feelings if they have them. It isn’t up to you to make everything nice. You can leave the interaction at any time. You always have that freedom.\n\nA lack of boundaries invites a lack of respect.\n\nBoth from other people but most important a lack of respect for yourself.\n\nTake care\n\nOliver",

Allow, me to demonstrate why this is bad.\n\n\"The duck is on fire\"\n\n\"The, like, duck is, like, on, like, fire\"\n\nNotice in the second sentance you get twice the words but half the meaning. And notice how it sounds a lot less genuine? Because you say the duck is \"like\" on fire, it subtly implies that the duck is not actually on fire but the duck is in a state akin to being on fire, when we all know that the duck is, in fact, on fire.\n\nAnd second of all, just talk slower. Take a deep breath, and say each word about twice as slowly, that should give you enough time to think of the next word. Now, I won't pretend that this is easy, in fact, I still struggle with it, but this sort of thing is not only hell on neurodivergence, but it also you're the kind of person who doesn't think before acting. Now, you don't have to completlely  remove filler words from your speech, in fact even the greatest speakers of all time have used them in pre-written speeches, but if you use them way too much, it'll become way less fun to talk to you.\n\nWhile I'm here, there's a similar problem with the filler \"y'know.\" Unless you're genuinely asking, you're  essentially mocking  the other person for their knowledge, or lack therof.",

She was pretty cute, helpful and kinda seemed interested in talking, so she showed around the isle for some recommendations. I was reserved when talking to her and I came off a bit dry because I got a bit flustered. Then I ended our interaction an awkward way. I didn't buy a book that day but I could come again.\n\nThe following week I find myself in the store again looking for a novel, and I asked one of the employees for some help. Through sheer coincidence I was talking to the same girl but it took a minute to register. By then she already took me to an isle, and this time to recommended her favorite book while also cracking up jokes. I finally realized it was her again and I became defensive; basically shot down her book recommendation and replied \"I'll keep looking around\" and she promptly left.\n\nI walked a bit in the shop and had re-evaluated what I have done. I knew I gave off the wrong vibes and I wanted to amend my image. I took my time to gain my back my composites and see if could also ask for her @. After some time I asked her colleague for her whereabouts and she said said she was on break. I said I wanted to talk to her about a book and she went to look in back for her. About a minute passes and the colleague comes back to tell me she isn't there. Then I took that and said I'll be back in an hour. I walked around, came back, and checked from the entrance if she was there. Nope, just the colleague by herself. So I left for a chance of next time. \n\nThen this morning it suddenly hit me. What if she was actually chilling in back the whole time and with the help of her colleague, sneakily shoo'd me off. Did I do too much in this situation? Can I come back and try my luck again? I haven't really done anything like this before but I really want to get her @ to start something off.",

        "text": "I walk in life seeing everyone speak perfectly. I know not everyone speak perfectly, but even the people with speaking issues sound normal compared to me. Over the years I tried everything in the book, but no success. I can't stand hearing people talk and they sound clear as day, even those with raspy voices seem to have some character in there. That's how bad it is for me, when I'm comparing mofos with \"bad\" voices to mines. I don't aspire to have the best voice, just a tolerable one. Not to be a emo or anything, but this shit really sent me to depression. I don't talk to people or leave my room because of this insecurity. My dream was to be a youtuber, and that requires speech. Nobody wants to hear a guy that sounds rough with a hissing s. I will say one thing positive, my s sound has improved, but my tone is fucking jacked. I talk in recordings EVERYDAY and it's depressing. I try to change my voice all the time to see what works. People say talk slower, but that doesn't sound natural one bit. Then the diaphragm breathing advice that I hear all the time. I feel like most people don't speak from their diaphragm and I also feel like most people speak clear (compared to me). I never heard a person that sounds like me, or my kind of bad. I have a open bite so I chalked it up to that for a minute, but one of my fav freestylers have missing teeth in his front and he still sound normal/clear. I'm like WTF, why am I nerfed?! If any of you want to hear how I sound, give me your email and I will send you voice notes. My tone is all kinds of bad, airy, lispy, and sloppy. It lacks character. You know how most people sound a way, I don't sound a way I feel. I just.....sound.....inaudible.....it ruined my life. Even people with flawed voices have a consistent tone, even if it's considered awful. Why doesn't my tone have a characteristic? The only tip that helped me was learning how to talk with my mouth more open. That helped resolve my s problem Other than that, nothing worked. Not the diaphragm, nothing. Again, I feel like most people have bad breathing, but still sound tolerable.",

I have told him basically all of my secrets, my interests, hobbies, goals, deep thoughts, thoughts on the world, thoughts on people we know, personal stories, and what not, and the same can be said for him. I don’t have anything else to talk about. Pretty little happens in my day.\n\nI can feel it quickly getting boring. We’re busy with school work and can’t have cars freshman year, so 90% of are interactions are in the dorm, where we can really only talk or watch tv.\n\nI have a huge fear of abandonment and worry I’m gonna lose him if I don’t find new things to talk about.

The problem is that it’s been so long that I don’t even know what people my age do for fun.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas of things I could ask my friends to do with me? I’m generally not a big drinker so activities that don’t involve a lot of alcohol would be preferred.

I honestly feel like I am being under-appreciated, but I really can't hate them. They actually care about me and my interests, talk to me, get excited when I am around, the good old classic friend hugs lol, but they just have this group chat without me. \n\nI asked about the group chat, and they always ignore. Then one day, they told me to get a game so I can join in the group chat. I thought to myself \"sure, why not.\" I got it and told them. I STILL didn't get added into the server. I actually tried to be interested in the game they gave me, but I just wasn't since no one was there to play with me. So I deleted it.\n\nI'm honestly beginning to think if I am annoying. They actually care about me being around them and they really love me as a close friend, but I just feel like an outsider whenever I am not included into stuff.\n\n(Also, I might be fishing out that I give personal information about life too quickly to people I met, but I'm not sure??? It would be nice to know if this is an issue so I can stop it in the future)\n\nThanks.\n\nAlso, I am a girl.",

I'm in a new city and the only social interaction I receive is with one family member. The isolation has been going on for a couple of years now. What makes it worse is that I'm having trouble finding a part-time job that will work with my school schedule, so I haven't been practicing interacting in that space. Also, the students I'm going to school with are almost 15 years younger than I am. I feel awkward and shameful all the time and I think it's exacerbating the issues.\n\nThe problem: I've always had a bit of social anxiety but it's grown to a totally different level since the pandemic. I'm having difficulty making eye contact, particularly while I'm sitting in the lectures because I'm unsure of where to place my eyes. Am I supposed to look the instructor in the eyes? How often? It just feels so intimate. When our eyes meet it feels like I'm almost being called out or something, I don't know how to explain it.  It makes me very self-conscious.  I already feel awkward and like a fish out of water already.  Obviously, I've been spiraling about it.  So what's been happening is that I \\*haven't\\* been making eye contact with the professors at all and staring at the PowerPoint, the walls, and their pants (lol)!  Anything to avoid it.  Well, I think it's coming off as really creepy and not helping my situation. \n\nSomebody, please help.",

I feel guilty posting this because some people have gone through trauma and bullying, but no, I haven’t, one day I just stopped making friends ):",

I’m not at all frustrated over the fact that they don’t want to be friends with me but rather how they lack manners towards me compared but to have towards anyone else who they’re suddenly all buddy-buddy with, I can’t help but be pissed.

        "text": "So I was reading about the 5 levels of communication by John Powell. 5 is shallow, and 1 is deep. Level 5 translates to cliche conversation - that is, we ask things like how are you without expecting or wanting a response. \n\nThen there's level 4, reporting facts about each other. Which in the end may translate into gossip or meaningless/useless facts.\n\nWhat I'm interested in is level 3 and below (level 3 translates to sharing ideas and judgement while level 2, is all about communicating feelings). Level 1 is peak communication.\n\nAt my job, all I talk about with other coworkers are facts. This is not deep conversation for me. To me, deep conversation translates to spiritual matters/someone's faith life and discovering what the everyday Paul or Emily looks like.\n\n I'm not asking to fully know someone (epiginosko, Greek to know fully) - which could be a dream come true to many or a nightmare to some. But at the same time, I understand that it's best to live a quiet live, and to mind our own business (this is in the Bible, 1 Thessalonians chapter 4). \n\nBut It's unfortunate because as much as I would like to have deeper conversations, we all have boundaries and we give people limited access to our lives. With all this in mind, how could we go beyond reporting facts about each other in conversation. \n\nWhat is more, if a person's boundaries are too rigid to a point where they build walls, cut people out, or never share, maybe it's best to give up on them and move on?",

I’m in a place where I’m seeking job after my internship but I’ve been trying to land a job for the past 5 months and I have no luck yet. Our family is pretty well off so I haven’t had the situation with money. These friends had to go through a struggle with money and experiences to get to where they are. And this makes it weird for me. That I didn’t have to go through many struggles and experiences makes me feel like I am not worth it. But I had other issues when I had to go through as child like parents were not in good terms for a long time, I did stupid stuff as a child and betrayed my friends few times because of my stupidness. I use to get suspended from school and did lots of embarrassing stuff. I was very playful. When I got my degree I started smoking up and that often got me over thinking stuff and thinking low of myself and I would hate myself for living like this. And the crazy part is I wouldn’t stop smoking that.

It was interesting seeing his face because I saw a brief glint of surprise. People don’t answer that question properly so I think it was just a pleasant change of pace. We then had a good session &amp; had a natter throughout.\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nI should answer the question: how are you, with the most up beat I can with strangers. I don’t know why I wouldn’t. It seems to have a positive contagion on those around me.\n\nOutside of just being slightly more upbeat, creating a happier conversation, I have found myself just having little conversation with strangers as I go about my day. People that I otherwise would have just ignored but instead, I make comments about the weather, ask questions about them and that’s quite amazing. I’m a really big fan of self development but I do think that there’s really no point until it’s practiced, so much time can be spent just looking at content of people doing things and me feeling like I’m getting something out of it just by listening. Doing the work like this feels very me and it's actually getting results which is amazing.\n\n**If you have any thoughts/ideas for prompts which I could use to slowgress towards confidence with strangers then lmk.**",

What I’m embarrassed about is that these conversations are always dry and go nowhere.\n\nGod forbid I ask to hang out, plans are always a “maybe” and I have to be the one who follows up or it definitely won’t happen. It’s exhausting and quite honestly hurts.\n\nWhat things have you guys done to help with this?",

I'm trying to get to know my cohort even though it's been already 1 semester in. There's a girl and a guy I talk to since we have the same advisor and they truly helped me to adjust, but they already have their own set of friends. I would really like to hang out with them more outside of school or create study groups. I do have a friend a year above me but it gets boring talking to the same person and I realize we don't really have similar interests. Usually when I'm with their friends or people in general I feel awkward or totally out of the conversation. Not sure if it's my introverted nature in me. I would really like some advice to get to know their friend group outside those two since I don't want to graduate school without doing having an established set of friends. \n\nThanks!",

Then they blame it on you.\n\nBasically for a good portion of my life, maybe the first half of it, I took shit. A lot. I was nice, and did not stand up for myself in the way I would like to. I had trauma from this and one day decided to finally start going \"no, it's time to stop\" \n\nYears later I've noticed my friendships have decreased massively. I am left with fewer friends but the ones I have are better, more friendly relationships. \n\nHowever when finally having confrontations with past \"abusers\" if you can call them that, I have almost always been gaslighted. Like I hurt them. It's my fault. I should have taken it. They're innocent. Etc\n\nBut what I've noticed is the newer friends in my life don't have this. Everything is fine. But the hangers on from the past, well when I fought back they didn't say sorry; they straight up left and made it look like my fault! Like I have issues! \n\nI am aware this is normal. But why would the older friends leave so quickly? Was I really just a punching bag for these narcissists and when they realised they couldnt use me like that anymore they left? Could they be that shallow?",

He starts breathing weirdly, walks differently, doesn’t know what to say or respond when I speak, which makes the situation really awkward.\nAt the beginning of the year he asked for my number (in kinda shy-awkward way) and asked if I wanted to go to the pub with him and his mates. I went, and he almost didn’t speak to me the entire time, even tho he told me to come. The next day he almost avoided me so I just came to the conclusion that he didn’t like me. \nA few weeks later, he randomly texted me asking if I wanted to go to one of his mates house party. I didn’t understand why he asked me (because I thought he didn’t like me) just responded that I wasn’t there in a kinda cold way. He never asked me to go anywhere since. It’s only when I saw him again that I realised that maybe he was acting weird / awkward  because he was shy. I wanted to ask him why he was acting so weird, but thought he would be even more uncomfortable if I pointed it out. It’s so awkward when we’re together that he started avoiding me and idk why he’s acting like that. Does he like me?  Does he hate me? I’m terrible at reading body language so please someone help.",
