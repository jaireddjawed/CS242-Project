Long story short: abusive childhood, diagnosed with a serious chronic illness at 17, multiple physically/sexually abusive romantic relationships in my adulthood. I’ve struggled with depression since childhood, and I know the root of it is self-hatred. \n\nHas anyone here gone from real self disgust/self hatred to self love? If so, how did you do it? \n\nThings I have tried: Therapy (on and off since I was 21. Multiple styles including EMDR, multiple therapists. None of it helped), meditation (nope), exercise (nope), changing careers (improved mood, but not the fundamental self hatred), getting a pet (helpful), reading about childhood trauma/mental illness (nope). \n\nOpen to ideas, want to try just about anything.",

        "text": "So I am dating a girl in med school since 3 weeks and when she was at my home and we studied together, I was on the phone in the kitchen while I was cooking with my ex girlfriend. Then the girl I am dating somehow felt that it was my ex and she asked me who I was on the phone with. I did not directly tell her it is my ex , and then she asked me again. I told her that my ex is nearly calling and texting me every day. She cancelled the date tonight and I called her, she explained that she is annoyed when I talk to my ex on the phone while she is with me. I told her I am sorry and that my ex and I are only friends, I suggested that we should meet up today which she agreed to, but now she texted me this:\n\n\"We should move on and forget about this. You showed me where your priorities are, hence, you would rather talk or text to your ex on the phone instead of talking to me while I am with you, so I think your path is not clear yet for dating someone new and you clearly do not respect me. I am not fine with someone talking to their ex so frequently and in front of me, I think it is rude and I would rather spend time with someone who sets clear boundaries and is not carrying the baggage of a previous relationship. I think we have different ideas of how potential commitment could look like. You are not ready to not talk to her and I am not here to tell you what to do or how to live your life, you have no obligations to me since we are not a couple and only have been dating for a few weeks. I really really liked you but this does not feel right to me. You might feel different about it and thats ok. askI want to keep med school and this stuff separated, so all is well. Thanks for understanding.\"\n\nDid I mess this up or is she being dramatic?",

Mind you I never once ignored him and instead of being concerned of my well being i have been bombarded of accused text messages. I texted him back with “i haven’t been ignoring you, I’m sick and in hospital” of which he replied apologising and saying he was just “worried” but he’s “sorry”\n\nBut now I’m not sure if I want to continue seeing him anymore and just so annoyed",

My longtime very close friend lived right in the neighborhood. Another casual acquaintance lived just a few blocks away, too. I met a few new people thru a local meetup. My acquaintance introduced me to her old coworker who was moving to my area. Great, I'm building my own friend group! Right?\n\nBFF and I had a falling out, and one of my new friends (who I had introduced to BFF)... well, she took my (now-ex-)BFF's side and I'm pretty hurt by that.\n\nAcquaintance is lovely but I've long stopped trying to make plans with her because she'd always flake at the last second.\n\nThe acquaintance's old coworker I'm also on great terms with and I consider her a friend, but... I have initiated all but, like, one of our hangouts and she's cancelled a few times without always trying to reschedule. Of my other new friends, I adore all of them but I feel like I have been the one to initiate in *every* plan. We have a great time when we hang out and it's clear they enjoy spending time with me but it feels really lonely to always be the one initiating the plans. I just wish *someone* here was as excited to spend time with me as I was with them.\n\nYes, I'm in therapy. It's great. It's helped a ton. Yes, I know *how to make friends* \\- the problem isn't that I don't know *how*, I am just... chronically ill and have pretty limited energy sometimes. I'm moving to a new city soon and while I don't expect that to fix my problems... well I can either be lonely in a place I don't want to live, or I can be lonely in a new city that I'm excited to explore.\n\nI would really appreciate any support or commiseration if you've in the same boat. It's just another Saturday night where I have no plans and I'm feeling kinda lonely.",

I'm super appreciative of how welcoming they've been, but I've realized this group is not really the right people for me. Everyone is very nice, but I think the only thing these people have in common is that they love to drink. All they ever want to do is drink.\n\nI have chronic health issues and so a few years back, I started limiting my alcohol intake a ton. I try to only drink occasionally and only have 1 or 2 drinks. If I try to suggest a non-drinking activity to anyone in this friend group, they decline and suggest a bar instead. (I also should note they never make me feel bad or anything for just 1 drink)\n\nI know the primary solution to that is to find other friends but that doesn't happen overnight. I do plenty of activities on my own and genuinely like being by myself, but socializing is important to my mental health. \n\nI'm extra frustrated because tonight I tried to reach out to a few of them asking if they wanted to come over and watch a movie and order takeout. Instead they suggested I meet them for drinks. I'm planning on declining at this point because I just want to chill at home, but I'm frustrated because I really felt like it would have been nice to have some friends to relax with after a frustrating work week.\n\nI guess I'm really just venting, but any advice would be appreciated. I'm joining a book club and workout class that I'm hoping will help me meet some new people here, and I've used Bumble BFF a bit but it always feels a little slow to connect with people. In the meantime, I'm really missing that real genuine connection with people.",

We were each other's first loves and went through many of life's milestones together, eventually getting engaged and buying a house.\n\nHowever he always had anger issues and eventually these caused me to end the relationship due to him shouting at me, giving me silent treatment, name calling over petty disagreements and issues. I tried to resolve these but he refused any counselling or help. I myself suffer from fairly severe anxiety and I found the relationship triggered this badly, for example having a week long panic attack at one point due partly to the silent treatment from him.\n\nWe broke up about a year and a half ago and since then I have been living with my parents temporarily saving for a deposit on a flat and now very close to buying something of my own. I have done online dating for the last half a year however this has been pretty disappointing and hasn't led to anything good.\n\nThe thing is I am constantly now doubting my decision to end the relationship and thinking back to many of the happy times we shared. It's almost like I can't imagine a life ahead of me without him ever being a part of it despite the pain he caused me.\n\nAt the end of the relationship I left our house and moved back with my parents and haven't seen him since although he has reached out to me on numerous occasions and is still keen to get back together. I found it unbearable to say a final goodbye though have made it clear that we are no longer in a relationship.\n\nHow do I move past this? I am considering meeting him again to talk, how do I know this relationship is over or if we have a chance in the future? I am finding the idea of buying a home of my own terrifying as it seems like the final nail in the coffin for our relationship, although a part of me also feels like this will give me a greater security and stronger position to decide what I want going forwards with my life. \n\nThank you for any helpful advice.",

When I was at his place to study I noticed a girl texting him on WhatsApp daily. He has other female friends but with her it seemed differently. I wondered if this is his ex girlfriend but did not ask because I thought this would be too rude and not my business. Today we met again to cook and study and then he was on the phone. I heard a female voice and was like ok, probably this one girl so I asked him who was on the phone and he just rambled something like oh I have so much work to do. Then I asked him again \"so are you dating several people at the same time, maybe a girl in your home country?\" and then he said his ex girlfriend is calling him nearly daily and she texts him every day. I was like wow how nice of you to talk to your ex girlfriend while I am here. I also asked him why he did not tell me that it was her on the phone and how he would like it if I am on the phone with my ex boyfriend while he is with me. Then he said they broke up 2 years ago and that things can change, that they are only friends now and that she went through a hard time etc. He said he does not want to lose me because of something stupid like this, he said he liked me and that he normally takes his time with relationships but that I am very special to him.\n\nI told him that I am not here to tell him what to do but that I dont like it that he talks to her on the phone in front of me since he is also speaking a different language so I dont even understand what he is talking to her (He is from Italy and she is living there). In the chat I also saw that they are sending each other heart emojijs but he really said they are only friends.\n\nI am so freaking disappointed because my other ex boyfriend cheated on me and this is not a good start at all. I feel so weird because he spends so much time with me and then he talks to his ex girlfriend on the phone while I am there. Isnt that so weird? He probably thought I wouldnt notice but come on, my intuition is so strong, I knew what was going on. What do you think, is that ok or not? I am about to cancel all plans with him tonight. We are in the process of becoming a serious couple so it is just weird someone would do that.",

I was really having a hard time at work and I needed to know I wasn't wrong for thinking this way.\n\nThe day after my original post, I updated my resume and scoured the internet for job opportunities. I applied to over a dozen job ads and I think half of them reached out to me for interviews. There was one I really liked during the initial interviews, but continued with the process for the other ones to get more interview experience.\n\nIt was a crazy week trying to schedule all of the interviews while working during our busy month, but I didn't care. \n\nFor the one I really liked, it took a week to go through the interview process. I cannot stress enough how stressful those days were! Every day/interview that went by, I got more and more excited. The Hiring Manager and I were chatting and talking like we've known each other for years. Every time I brought up my way of thinking or something I've achieved, they got really excited.\n\nI had a really good feeling about this opportunity. In the final interview, I, once again, talked about growth opportunities and my desire to learn and absorb as much as I can to help the company continue to succeed. They already talked about what type of paths I can take within the company and what they will do to help me achieve my goals. They gave specific examples, which is more than I've ever received from my current Manager for the 10 years I've worked for him.\n\nThey offered me the position! Bigger title, 20% pay bump, hybrid, competitive PTO, good bonus potential and better benefits.  I accepted the position and will be giving my notice this week. It also checks several other boxes that I'm looking for. I am beyond excited for this opportunity! \n\nI should note that I will not accept a counter offer.",

It's about my personal issues and questions I have. \n\nI have received my first Biontech in Nov 2021. I was sick for 4 weeks flat after. I gained 10 kg/ 22lbs within those 4 weeks. I had always been a healthy weight up until then. Nothing else had changed in my life at the time. The second dose I received a day late as Biontech then had been restricted in my country and I couldn't get it anymore where I was initially scheduled for it. The second dose I had almost no initial side effects, I was starting to recover from my almost one month long sick stint and things were fine. I did miss my period though and was almost a month delayed, which was something I hadn't experienced up until then. My period continued to be disrupted and not regular for 6 months post vaccine. It was much more strong for a while too. Then my cycle became regular again but it remained much shorter than previously. It went from +-28 days to +-25 days. The weight gained in those 4 weeks I unsuccessfully tried to shed ever since. I am not taking hormonal contraception nor have I in the past 17 years.\n\nI had a first full blood scan including thyroid check in March 2022. All my results were fine except low iron. This has been addressed and has also been in the green for almost a year now. \n\nIs this just normal for mid 30? Are there any checks or illnesses my regular doc may not have concidered that I could look into?Anyone here experienced premature menopause and does this sound like it could be that?",

        "text": "I (33f) live with my partner (34m) and I have my son (7) live with us one week with us and one week with his dad. We live in a big city not in the US. I am American and my partner is English. \n\nWith that said, I have a question because I’m not sure if I’m overthinking this and getting myself upset over nothing. I’m mildly autistic and not sure if I’m thinking about the situation correctly. I need to explain a bit of background in case it makes any difference to the situation.  \n\nMy partner has always liked to spend Fridays with his friends and coworkers. When we first met, we worked at the same place and would often end up having after works at the office bc it was a fancy tech company that had free beer and snacks. I left the company about 2 years ago now but my partner still works there. I did not have a good experience at the end and much prefer not to be around that place of work anymore since it brings back horrible memories. \n\nOn Fridays that I have my son, I’ve asked my partner to please be home by midnight because we often have activities or chores planned for the Saturday with my son. If we have to quietly tiptoe around the 90m (900ft) apartment it stresses me out to no end. My son is autistic and doesn’t really understand the being quiet part. Now I get that you might give me the advice not to stay quiet, it was his choice to stay out. Etc etc. But let’s be honest. We all suffer when someone is chronically tired and around. \n\nThat said, he promised he’d be home by midnights. He was honoring that mostly but even still sometimes he comes back at 1 or 2am. He will say he left before 12 and had to walk bc the metro wasn’t running anymore. Or he lost track of time. Didn’t have his phone on him. Or he’ll say he wasn’t drinking or stopped at 10. Etc etc. heard it all. But what I’m upset about is the lack of respect he’s giving me by just ignoring what we’d agreed to and talk about often. \n\nOn top of that, on the Fridays we don’t have my son, he still stays at work and parties with his friends. I don’t want to go to the office bc I hate it there. I don’t drink, and I feel uncomfortable in the environment. They never want to go anywhere else bc the city is expensive. \n\nI have a chronic pain condition which doesn’t really allow me to stay up late otherwise I’m in a lot of pain no matter the drugs I take. So I’m my eyes, it feels like I either have to be uncomfortable and go to the office to have a Friday with him or I stay home and we don’t hang out. If he stays 99% of the time he’s very hungover the next day and doesn’t want to do anything. So Friday and Saturday are now useless on our weekend without my son. \n\nI don’t want to nag and require him to stay home sometimes. He gets upset that I go to bed at 10 and complains what was the point he should have gone out. The thing is, he goes to clubs to dance and it’s usually just him and his one friend. My gut says no way, going to a club to dance and I’m not there? That feels risky to me and if he’s as drunk as he’s been who knows who he’s dancing with. \n\nI donno. To me this seems like something he’d be doing in his 20s not at 34. I feel left out and not respected. He never “plans” to stay out late because he says he never thinks ahead. But that seems really selfish and childish to me at this age.",

        "text": "I just find is strange when women mimic other women’s voices in a derogatory way when they’re telling a story. I just watched a huge influencer on instagram out of nowhere put on a vocal fry voice and say something like “instagrams our job omg”. She’s teasing other women who speak like this. I can get that the message women give out sometimes with what they say isn’t great for our gender, but why would women then make fun of that? Like aren’t we all supposed to be in it together?\n\nI have a “friend” (she’s an acquaintance) who will mimic words that we say. I said I was a digital nomad last summer and she goes (in a vocal fry voice) “omg I’m a digital nomad”. I don’t get it. And she’ll go on about how she doesn’t like certain types of women because they speak a certain way, or act a certain way. People she doesn’t even know. \n\nIt reminds me of the mean girls quote: “You all have got to stop calling each other sluts and whores. It only makes it okay for guys to call you sluts and whores.“\n\nI dont see men walking around putting on macho douche voices when they talk about other guys.\n\nTruly it just seems weird to me. Is it a sort of projection?",

        "text": "So, I turn 40 next year and want to start planning for an amazing once in a lifetime solo holiday for a couple of weeks, as something to look forward to. I’ve not been away anywhere for a few years through covid. \nAs a forever single I’ve travelled solo a lot over the years, almost always searching for paradise 🏝️. I also really love adventure, ticking off a bucket list thing and building a holiday around that (swimming with sharks or safari for example). I’ve always travelled more as a backpacker though because I wanted to meet people but there are certain holidays and destinations I feel like i might miss out on because they’re so honeymoon/couple focused.\nThe Maldives and Iceland/Norway for Northern lights (for example) are places I’ve always wanted to go but they’re just not really set up for singles and don’t offer single options which makes them crazy expensive alone. I guess I’m just using you lovely ladies as a sounding board in case you have any experience or ideas? \n\nI’m happy to pay a few grand (£) as I have a bit of time to save and as it’s such a milestone birthday. I’d like more luxury than my usual backpacking trips staying in hostels and less of the mad go go go pace that usually comes with. I’m also a bit beyond hanging out with 24 yr olds now, and I think most hostels stop accepting over 36yr olds anyway. FML 🤦‍♀️ Also not much of a city person, prefer far flung, off the beaten track. \nI expect lots of people will suggest the yoga/retreat options as good for solos but it’s not really my vibe, I do like the option for a bit of adventure but still potentially meeting other people. So far I’ve not even found solo travel companies that aren’t extortionate and many still seem to want you to share rooms. \n\nIn terms of where I’ve been (outside Europe); Philippines, Thailand, Mexico, Caribbean, Zanzibar/SAfrica (for safari), Aus/NZ, Fiji, India, Nepal, Indonesia, Panama, Belize, Costa Rica, Honduras, Malaysia/Borneo, Canada.\n\nHit me! 😁",

(It’s called a relationship but whatever) so that’s why I left. I left bc I genuinely needed help with childcare while I worked and bc we always argued about his kids on his weeks. So I said I’ll make it easy and just go to my moms for a bit. It was originally only supposed to be for a month while I went through training and he could refocus on school/work. \nSince he’s on this 30 day no contact faith journey (I made another post about it) \n\nI’m not returning home. He can keep the house and the stuff.\n\nNow my issue is being at my mothers is my father is 100 percent handicap. It’s tough with her being a caregiver me working, a baby running around, I’m doing a whole lot more than I bargained for and my mom is pretty demanding too. Needless to say I’m overwhelmed and stressed. I can’t go “home” but I don’t want to stay here anymore. I don’t have a home to go to. I feel trapped\n\nWe live in completely different states. Our home is in California and im from Florida. (Where I’m at now)\n\nI don’t know if I should just get a rental here or there or stay with my mom until august and buy and again here or there?\n\nI’m not concerned about custody arrangements at all. If he wants to see his child he can find a way. I did all the thinking for him so it’s his turn at this point.\n\nAny advice on what you would do? Bc I’m going crazy n my family home. \n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Hey all,\n\nI’m trying to plan something for my birthday, and I’d like to spend it with my friends. I’m an introvert, and have a lot of medical issues, and I moved a few months ago so I don’t see my friends often.\n\nHowever, I’ve been hesitating to plan something because every idea I come up with seems inconsiderate. I’ve been mulling over this for a month now, not knowing what to do, and at this point my birthday is only 3 weeks away (April 1) which I realize leaves even less time for my friends to plan.\n\n1. My first idea was a girl’s night. I think that would be loads of fun. I’d get food and drinks and pot and we could watch movies, listen to music, paint, chat, just have a good time. And several friends have mentioned wanting to visit me where I live now. \n\nThe thing is, I work weekends and I only requested off Saturday (the day of my birthday). I didn’t think about the Sunday until just now. Friday night would be perfect for me, but seems like it might be difficult for my friends (particularly those with regular work schedules and/or kids) because I live two hours away. The ones who said they want to visit me might not mind, and most don’t have traditional work schedules either, but the ones who haven’t mentioned wanting to visit…how can I even ask them to make the drive? \nAnd then those with kids, Friday night seems terrible. \n\nBut I know I can’t stay up all night Saturday carrying on, and then get up for work to be on the next day at 8am. Unless it was like a Saturday party ending at midnight? (Of course I would have sleeping accommodations) \n\n2. I have wanted to do a proper English tea for a long time! I thought it would be nice to invite a couple friends, but again, the distance. I could make the reservation for Saturday, but the closest tea places would be an hour and a half drive for them. (For me too, which is fine)\n\n3. Rage room. I definitely want to do this, birthday or not. I found ones nearby where most of my friends live, and I found ones where it would be about an hour drive for all of us. But then I thought, I can’t afford a rage room for everyone. \n\nWhen I looked online for etiquette for paying for birthday stuff, I found a whole range of answers from: if you can’t afford to pay for everyone then you shouldn’t be doing an activity for your birthday, to: just tell people they will have to pay for themselves upfront. \n\nI mean, rage room would be hundreds of dollars and I just personally can’t afford that. $100 minimum for two people, one session. I could do that. I would want to invite 6 people, so plus me that’s 7. I can’t afford that. \n\nIs it really bad to say hey I’d love to share this experience with you all, we’re all paying for our own entry fee, let me know if you can make it! \nOne person online said that is rude and tacky. I don’t want to be rude and tacky. \n\nBut other people said it’s not a big deal. I don’t know if it’s a cultural thing?\n\nI have never done this before as an adult, meaning spent my birthday with friends. Last time I did that I was a teenager. I’ll be turning 33.\n\n\nAlso, my husband asked me if I would like to spend the day with him or if he could join in if I do something with my family. I really don’t want to spend the day with him or my family. Oh no. I’m trying to have a good time, not feel bad. For context, we have been living separately for 2 years, and have had very low contact with each other for over a year now. I did say yes to him coming over for my birthday last year. It was weird. I don’t want to do that this year. I’m much happier and doing better in my life and want to spend the day with people who bring me joy. \n\nThanks for insight here. I haven’t asked anybody anything yet!",

It also freaks me out to think about all the other things that might physically change over the next few years. I've never really (consciously) subscribed to the youth=beauty narrative, and there are many older women who I find attractive independently of physical signs of aging, but apparently I'm having a hard time living these values when it comes to myself. I'm judging my appearance and feel less attractive than I used to. \n\nI know I could just resort to Botox and hair dye and be done with it, but would much rather see this as an opportunity for growth and learn how to accept the physical changes that are coming my way, and keep loving my physical appearance the way I did before they kicked in.

        "text": "I know this will be confusing and I apologize. I tried to explain with as little personal detail as possible. I just need to know if I am super crazy or maybe just a little crazy at this point. Please feel free to ask questions for any clarification.\n\nAlso, it should maybe be known that with my ADHD I tend to spiral. I have been treating it recently and trying to work on the spiraling and hyper-dwelling on certain situations, so I know this may come off that way because, well, it is what's happening :)\n\nI work in an office department with about 15 other people aged 30-45 mainly women. There is lots of typical work drama that I found out I guess is normal in office environments, but I avoid it for the most part because gossip makes me uncomfortable.\n\nThat being said, last week I was sitting at my desk working, when coworker A (who I consider one of my closest relationships at work) came in and asked if I had heard about all the “drama” with coworker L who was apparently in the process of quitting.  According to A, L had been planning it for a while, and doing interviews for other jobs during our work hours. L told coworker B all of this (I’m guessing in confidence it was just between them two), who then spread it around to a few others (lol how sweet right). This is what I was told by A. I am getting all of my information about this from A who apparently needed to unleash this on someone who hadn't yet heard it, which happened to be me. So I take all this for what it is which sounds just like basic gossip to me.\n\nIn passing during this convo with A, I mentioned something to her that was private information that eluded to the fact that I already knew L was going to quit because something I was told by a very close contact in another department about a month prior. This is info I kept to myself this whole time because it was obviously not my business to share. It was nothing offensive, hurtful, personal, or anything negative that way. It was just specific info that wasn't my information to share because it would basically confirm L was going to quit her job. I mentioned it to nobody and never really thought twice about her maybe quitting.  I did go on to tell A to please not mention that info to anyone else, though, so as not to get the person who originally told me involved. Basic request I thought she would have no problem understanding.\n\nShit hit the fan when, not even an hour later, I know that this private info had been spread amongst our department, and it had gotten back to the quitting coworker L (who was off work that day actually). Coworker B in my department actually called L and said that everyone knows she is quitting because of this specific information that I shared to ONE PERSON ONLY WHICH WAS A, and that she should probably tell our boss before it gets back to him. This caused L to send a nasty, mean message to my close friend in the other department basically blaming them for everything. Remember A had told me that L told B everything about her plan to quit, and that B for some reason spread it around amongst a few loose lipped people in our department. I HAVE NO IDEA IF THIS IS TRUE because A told me and I take it with a grain of salt.\n\nSo at this point, my close friend in different department is annoyed and hurt by the whole thing coming back to them when really it was blown 1000% out of proportion. So I feel guilty for that big time.\n\nMY MAJOR PROBLEM IS that my friend/coworker A is completely denying telling anyone this info. She is literally the only one who knew. The close friend of mine in the other department would 100% never be the one to mention this to anyone else, and A is the only one I told thinking it was just a private convo between us. I called her that night and told her I was confused because I just don’t understand how suddenly everyone could know this very specific info I told her when she was the only one I told. and the fact that it got back to L literally by the end of that work day was quite puzzling. She is still denying it. She is saying that someone else knew and spread it around and she must have heard it (????) and just repeated it “or something.” I have asked people around here about it, saying I’m confused and just don’t understand, and nobody will give me a straight answer. Like WHO TOLD??? If it was A, just admit it!! I am being gaslit and it’s driving me insane!\n\nI feel like Truman when he's figuring out what's going on in the kitchen with his wife, and she just keeps feeding him random ads instead of answering the question. \n\nWhat should I do? What would you do? I am usually a pushover, and don't really voice my opinion as much as I should. This is really eating away at me for a few reasons. The main reason being that I trusted A and have no idea why she would instantly spread something around to people after I specifically told her not to, especially because it was not necessary and the only reason was literally just for gossip and entertainment. It just seems out of character for her, but I can see her being easily influenced by others because she does always want to fit in. Mind you, these are 40 year old women. I have second hand embarrassment for them but also for myself at this point, lol. Because I'm letting this get to me. I know it's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but I don't appreciate getting treated like such an idiot. When I asked who could have told this if A didn't, I get literal shrugs and they will change the subject. I feel like I’m in the twilight zone. I wish I could, but I just cannot let this one go. I cannot just avoid A either because I work VERY closely with her every weekday.\n\nPlease send advise as to either how to approach this so get some sort of solution, or how to best let it go within my own soul. I want to stand up for myself, but I understand some things are just a lost cause.",

She was dealing with internalize homophobia, and our relationship had to be secret.\n\nBut those weren’t the issues. I wanted the basics of what a relationship entails, and that was lacking.\n\nMy needs weren’t heard let alone fulfilled, it was all how she wanted it when she wanted it. If I had a concern she would dismiss it as bs. I had to watch what to say, how to say it, how to behave in public, in private, watch out for what outburst she might have, or what mood she was in. Then it became violent. At first she pushed me, then she hit me, at last she put her hands around my throat during an argument. It didn’t happen often, maybe three or four times, but somehow it was always my fault; she was defending herself, I made her feel like she couldn’t escape the argument she said. I started therapy, tried to encourage her to go, but she wouldn’t, so after time we separated. For months we didn’t speak or see each other.\n\nThen, I reached out. I needed her, or maybe I needed to know that those 3 years together weren’t in vain. I don’t know why, but we reconnected.\n\nWhen it happened she told me her father passed away the previous month, and it hit me hard. I knew how much she loved him. I immediately offered every support I could. Time, money, help, anything she needed.\n\nI would’ve loved to go to the funeral but I couldn’t arrange to leave in time. She left for two weeks, and we didn’t talk much in those days. I understood, she was busy.\n\nWhen she got back I felt like she was distant, or maybe I was childishly jealous that she was would confide more in friends and family than in me, but that was an old wounds. She didn’t seem to want support from me, if not financial, but she was open with family and friends. \n\nThen we had a fight. Petty, but it sounded so familiar. I told her I was disappointed she didn’t call when she went to dinner with her daughter in law who I would’ve loved to meet. I didn’t think much of it, I didn’t want a fight, but she took it as an attack.\n\nShe said that I don’t know how to behave, that those people are not in my category, and that I was starting to show my true ugly colors.\n\nHer reaction had nothing to do with her grief. Even before she would indulge in these little pleasantries, with added insults. Even before she would disregard completely what was said and aim straight at the jugular, sometimes literally.\n\nI told her that what she said was unacceptable, then I kept quiet for a few days thinking that she would understand, apologize, try to talk it through. Of course she didn’t, she never did.\n\nSo I called, thinking that we could lay an olive’s brunch and carry on. She said she was going to call me back because she was watching something, she never did.\n\nThat’s when I told her that it was it, I had enough. She didn’t say anything, except that she just lost her dad and couldn’t deal with my rubbish. \n\nI’m torn with guilt, I keep thinking that I had to be patient, that I did not have to make it about me because she was grieving, and that this time I should’ve put my needs aside and be there for her however she needed me.",

        "text": "I've kept in touch with a childhood friend for over the past 28 years. We were close mostly in the 7th grade, then lost touch till roughly my junior year of high school when she worked where I did. She moved across the country shortly after high school and had a baby. I stayed in touch with her through Myspace, then eventually Facebook. We saw each other a handful of times when she came back to our home town to visit family. She is always sweet and seems like she really cares that our friendship stays alive.. she is the last childhood friend I have in my life. \n\nFast forward&gt;&gt; she got into some boyfriend drama &amp; decided to leave where she was because a relative offered to fly her back to my home state about a 30 min drive from my home. I was nervous because in between all this time, she seemed to have erratic behavior like jumping from man to man, losing jobs, possessions, family support &amp; she once borrowed money and promised to pay it back till I got tired of awkwardly asking multiple times. \n\nWhen she got here, the very next weekend I picked her up and knew something was off. She was long winded and told me about her life without taking a breath for me to speak. She hardly asks me how I am doing or what I have been up to. If I tell a story, it's like a rubber ball bounces back to her to take over and tell more stories. lol.. it's exhausting \n\nLater in the evening when she was staying at my house she began to tell my husband stories of a secret Italian family she discovered through DNA testing. She said her mother had an affair and the dad I knew she had growing up, wasn't biological. This seemed so strange because it was never mentioned and this is uhm.. kind of a big deal. \n\nWhat made it more strange, is she said on another occasion when she got her LPN certification/license she had to go through some medical tests &amp; was informed that she had canine DNA. She said she's discussed this with members of her Italian family and they said there is a long line of wolf-hybrids in the family..... \\*clearing throat\\* \n\nSo I sat there in shock, not wanting to chime in much and she went on how she'd have x-rays done on her back to figure out some back pain &amp; was told she had extra vertebrae. This apparently further confirms the wolf DNA that was discovered. \n\nThere is more, so much more from possessed electronics in her home, mysterious books bound in skin that had secret powers, witchy stuff, ghost encounters, alien spaceship sightings.. all things weird she has somehow captured a slice of an experience to confirm it's real. \n\nWHAT DO I DO? haha.. I'd love to hear from some others as to whether a long friendship is worth keeping when it's unbearable to listen to tall tales and have the energy sucked right out from the first hello. \n\nShe signed up for a travel job and once again is a rolling stone, rolling off to somewhere else for a while because her promise to getting a house next to me was broken which is fine.. really it is. I think she will be back though because she is on temporary assignments. Do I confront her? It's all too weird and I think she habitually tells lies because she even lies about the money she makes as a LPN.. so it's not just weird stuff, it's about her every day life as well. This causes trust issues.",

I didn't understand a healthy relationship but realize now that anyone who cares about someone would not treat them the way I was treated.  I don't know how to reset myself and stop dwelling on it.  I almost would say it's like PTSD reaction but I've never been diagnosed so I can't say for sure.  \n\nI just want to move forward and get past this feeling.   I need to focus on work and positive things, not negativity and past trauma.  Any advice on how to regroup myself?",

Kids are still young. \n\nLately she was venting to me about hating life and feeling suicidal at times. I of course told her to see Gp and get referred but also asked what was causing it, to her feeling, she basically wants to run away from her life. And her partner sounds so cold emotionally and physically. \n\nNow she’s back to beaming about him and good stuff he does. \n\n…do I say something ? Or let it just run it’s natural course… it’s hard to watch her cycle in and out of this pattern.",

I actually have quite good taste I think, my confidence has always been rock bottom and I get overwhelmed owning a lot of stuff and trying to coordinate outfits. Anyway.\n\nSlowly I’m getting there. I think what’s been most effective is trial and error, and realising what does and doesn’t work. Also, I pick celebrities or Instagram people and just flagrantly steal their outfits or general personal style.\n\nHow did you do it?",

I just want to be alone but I am kind of financially stuck at my exes place (not physically in danger). My car broke this week (over $3,000 to fix), I’ve got to find a place that allows me and my two cats to live in a super expensive city, and I could just vent on but… is there any advice of just how to pick myself up right now? Usually I’m great at breakups but I just feel like I’m in a vulnerable position here and starting to lose hope in people, and myself. I have pretty good self awareness and work on myself a lot, but I just feel like a piece of dirt right now. Or if you know of any cheap rentals in Seattle that would allow two lovely cats and me.. I’m about to pay everything off but man March is starting off with a big poop on my life, hopefully I can turn it to fertilizer",
