There's a bed, table, chair, closet, and bathroom — plus a kitchen that folds behind doors when not in use.\n\nIt's cool, sure, but that's what it says about the Housing Market in Boston. And this is one of the least expensive neighborhoods they're talking about. It's shameful. ",

I just found */urbanplanning* and have been trying to get an overview of what the discussions are about and which schools of thought are out there.\n\nI have checked threads on book recommendations, and it seems like the different books like *How Cities Work*, *Suburban Nation* and *Death and Life* have clear ideologies, zeitgeists and agendas. I could of course read them all, but I doubt I will, and I would like an overview first anyway. Are there any articles, books, documentaries, podcasts or sources that compare these schools of thought?\n\nAlso, it seems like most of the material concerns modern American cities. While that is fair, I would love to get a bigger perspective – how do old European cites compare to modern car-based American cities or post-2000 Chinese megacities?",

If I can create a synopsis, it would be something like this - Bike Advocates think that infrastructure is the answer, and that it doesn't ask how to get the traditionally disenfranchised on bikes. \n\n&gt;When I moved to Washington, D.C., to work on bike equity issues on the national level, I started to realize that this focus on infrastructure had become so dominant that there wasn’t really a lot of room for other strategies. We weren’t asking for funding for the community-run bike shop at the local high school where young people could be learning to repair bikes.\n\nTo me, it would seem that this had been rendered somewhat moot given the proliferation of bike shares and dockless companies, but also, there's some assumption that bike shops or educational centers would be a better investment here. I have my own opinions, but rather than lead with them I was hoping we could get a discussion going. ",

It will lie at a distance of 1 km to the current shore line. [Like this](https://imgur.com/3kSkNJb). The dutch are really good at reclaiming land, so you need to have a concept ready on Wednesday morning.\n\nYou can take away land from your island, but you can not add land to it.\n\nThe dutch have done this in real life on a much larger scale with [Flevoland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flevoland).",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/91l2mz/synthesizing_marchettis_constant_transport/",
        "text": "I'm looking at synthesizing the concept of a travel time budget ([Marchetti's Constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marchetti%27s_constant)) with transportation planning and urban morphology, especially in fast-growing developing-world cities. First, is this crazy? Second, here's my thinking so far:\n\n1. Time spent on travel [is effectively constant](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11116-016-9694-6) across a population, roughly [60-80 minutes per day](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01441647.2014.946460?journalCode=ttrv20).\n2. This implies that the median maximum commute time is around 40 minutes each way.\n   1. Given that 90-minute commutes are common for about 2% of the population, there is a long tail outwards from there.\n3. This also implies that leisure or errand travel on weekends is similarly limited, such that only stuff within a 30-40 minute radius of home is viewed as effectively accessible, with stuff closer-in viewed as more \"yours\" than stuff further out, because that stuff you can access even after or during your commute. (I have a hunch that quick or easy errands are about 1/3 of your maximum commute time: a 30-minute commuter will only go as far as 10 minutes, but that requires research I haven't found or done.)\n4. Lastly, the travel time budget implies that there are \"bands\" of land-use out from the city center defined by travel time from the center rather than physical distance, each of which is nested within the next ring:\n   1. Central city areas are about a 30-minute diameter across, with the downtown core in the middle\n   2. Inner-ring suburbs have a 60-minute diameter (so 30 minutes to the core)\n   3. Outer-ring suburbs are 80 minutes\n   4. Exurbs are as far as 180 minutes\n5. Each transport mode has an average speed at rush hour, and the dominant mode of a region will influence where these bands locate. In ascending order of speed, they are foot &gt; bike &gt; local bus &gt; BRT/LRT &gt; subways &gt; commuter rail &gt; HSR, with cars coming in somewhere around subway speeds depending on local travel conditions.\n\nOn to what this has to do with developing-world cities:\n\n1. Especially in very large, fast-growing cities (Accra, Karachi, Manila), transportation development is done absent a future needs analysis: what should the city look like? And how far ought it spread? How far will it spread at realistic developed-world densities?\n2. If the rings of central city to exurb are defined by travel time, then controlling how a city spreads will depend heavily on the transportation modes built, and which modes those could realistically be are dependent upon the future population of the city.\n3. So, BRT might work in smaller cities of 1-5 million but certainly wouldn't in larger cities of 10-20 million because the outermost travel-time ring will simply be too small to support the populations that want to live in each of the rings.\n4. Good planning in the developing world, then, should be based on what the city could look like in 50-80 years, not just what it looks like today, so the right modes and right alignments are chosen.\n\nThoughts? Critiques? *Am I totally off my nut??*",
