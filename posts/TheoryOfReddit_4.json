        "text": "I've realized recently, that I keep making the same mistake over and over again, when I discover a new subreddit.\n\nTake for instance /r/loadingicon. I don't remember exactly how or when I discovered it, but in all likelihood, I found it in a comment on another gif, maybe on /r/gifs. \n\nGenerally, what I'll do when I discover a new sub, is I'll go over, read the community info blurb to find out what the sub is all about, and if it looks interesting, I'll take a look at Top Posts of All Time. I like to look at the most upvoted stuff to see what the community considers to be the finest examples of the type of content that belongs here.\n\nAfter browsing 10-20 of the top posts (or more), I'll think, \"Hey, this is pretty nice stuff! I'm interested in apps and software development, maybe I should subscribe to this sub so that I keep getting inspired by interesting and clever loading icons.\"\n\nThen I'll hit Subscribe.\n\nThis way of discovery seems to have two flaws:\n\n1. **Top vs. Everyday**\n\nI've realized that there can sometimes be a large disconnect between the Top of All Time posts and the Trending now posts that get included on my front page. A lot of subs have great top-all-time content, and just really boring and repetitive everyday content.\n\nI remember finding the top posts of /r/ProgrammerHumor absolutely hilarious when I first discovered the sub, so naturally, I subscribed. However, I think I unsubscribed in record time, when my frontpage started getting flooded with this one meme they have -- audio volume controls implemented terribly. I mean, the first time a bad volume slider got posted, it was funny and it rose to the top. A few of the better parodies made their way there, too. But day in and day out, people were posting and upvoting the same joke over and over again. I've never seen any sub beat a dead horse so much outside of the \"circlejerk\" subs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. **Thematic and community overlaps**\n\nAnother problem inherent in this approach is that, when I discover subreddit B through subreddit A's comment section, it tends to mean that there's a certain overlap between them themes and communities of those two subs. That's not a problem *per se*, but the more overlaps exist, the more stuff tends to get cross-posted between A &amp; B.\n\nI guess the more people subscribe to the same subreddits, the less they need to explain inside jokes to one another, and the more opaque that community becomes to outsiders, people who are not \"in\" on the joke.\n\nFor instance, there was a gif of foxes running in a circle around a tree, posted to /r/gifs. Then, someone in the comment section might make a reference to /r/loadingicon in the comment section, because it reminds them of a spinning buffering icon. So now, someone will post the gif to /r/loadingicon with a title like, \"Does this count?\". In that or the original comment thread, someone will also make a comment about how this is /r/AnimalsBeingDerps, and so then it gets posted there, too. And so on.\n\nThe more you discover new subs through the comment sections, the more likely you are to see inside jokes spread from one sub to the other.",

However, game subs now have become more akin to something more tribalistic or political.  People are only allowed to praise developers and are terrified of any posts that might call out bugs or really any faults in the game (concepts, mechanics, etc).  It really seems like people are attaching their personality to the games they play and try to prevent anyone from criticizing the game.  This seems to be more apparent in survival game aspects but I am seeing it grow in all genres.  What has happened?  It is lame and kind of ruins the point of a game subreddit.  It is just mindless support and squashing any negativity on the sub.  It feels like a weird insecurity but I can't really understand/emphasize with this perspective.  It feels fake and lame.

        "text": "A ton of subreddits that encouraged hate speech were recently banned from reddit. To be fair most of these subreddits were terrible, and I think its fair of reddit to want to purge their platform of communities like the ones in question. \n\nIn the subreddit discussing these bans (which was recently made private), there were tons of subreddits named who'd been identified as potentially bannable. I looked at some of the medium sized subreddits named and found that many of the members of their communities were concerned. They were concerned about their sub being banned, but there were some people who were concerned about the increase in redditors who were looking for a new forum for their hate speech. In many cases these were the communities that were not banned for a reason. They were not explicitly hateful, but from time to time the content gets a little edgy which has the eyes of the ban supporters on them, and some community members don't necessarily want more of that type of content there.\n\nI can't help but feel like this raises a valid concern. When a subreddit gets banned, does it really eliminate that type of content from the site, or will that content just end up naturally finding itself in other places? \n\nBanning subreddits when literally thousands of others exist and it's not hard to find similar ones, in my mind is not enough of a motivation to get some of these people to stop posting this content.\n\nIf the goal is to remove hate speech from the site, why do it like this when the people can just waltz into new communities and start posting there?\n\nIn no way am I defending the content posted in those subreddits, but in my opinion this approach seems to be ineffective. If a bunch of shitbags are off doing shitty things on reddit, the platform is built so that you never have to see it if you don't want. At least before the bans, all of the garbage was together and avoidable, but now these assholes are getting all the attention in the world and I'm afraid of their content could start spreading.",

For example, the top post about from doing a search on Colombia is about a dog - beating stories about news about indigenous people having their rights violated en masse or that flood that killed 250+ people (the latter which got almost no upvotes or even got downvoted).  \n\nGenerally speaking, the only time I tend to see stories about atrocities against locals in non-Western countries getting tons of upvotes (relatively) is when it deals with stuff like weed, sex, etc. or politics.  I get that a lot of people care more about animals than people in general and that there's that \"people suck and animals are better\" mindset, and I understand the reasoning behind that.  However, I don't see misanthropy as the cause here given that when those stories occur in the western world, they get upvoted to the point that they reach the front page of Reddit (like 50-100k upvotes).  \n\n\nCan someone here try to explain why?",

I pulled info from the June 2018 reddit data stored on google's bigquery and ranked active subreddits based on what fraction of high-scoring comments get removed. Below is a bar graph I made showing the top 17 subreddits. There's also a red line indicating the site-wide average removal rate for high-scoring comments. Note that all listed subreddits have rates above the site-wide average and that /r/science has by far the highest rate.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Chart](https://i.imgur.com/dNlFtzg.png)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSuch a high rate of comment removal for even the best-scoring comments reflects a disagreement between the community and the moderators on what constitutes good discussion. Perhaps this is representative of the general problem of the communication gap between science experts and laypeople. *edit - Yet presumably this gap exists in other technical subreddits, and still the data indicate that /r/science has about double the rate of removal of the next highest technical subreddit. So its hard to see how expertise gap alone can explain this exceptionally high comment removal rate.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm still exploring this data, so I'd love to open this thread up to discussion about /r/science and reasons why highly upvoted comments are so frequently removed.",

        "text": "\n\nLike the social networks, Reddit has found itself in the business of judgement, this is something that they had wisely avoided in their original design. They wisely moderators on the various subs take on the responsibility of judgement in most circumstances, this leaves Reddit squeaky clean. Reddit has become large enough now that the entire system must be moderated, perhaps it could be outsourced as well? It’s too big of a job for any individuals in the community to take this on, but it could be done by institutions and organizations outside of Reddit.\n\nLet’s look at LinkedIn as a simpler example, they presently have an in-house rating system to rate their clients, this makes them vulnerable to being judged for their judgement system. \n\nIf the goal of LinkedIn was to build a trusted institution over all else, it would’ve been wise for them to outsource their judgement systems and concentrate their efforts on accurate data collection. They would then need to have an outside institution such as the American medical Association rate there clients who are in the medical field, and then LinkedIn would display that rating, as well as the ratings from one or two other top medical institutions.\n\nLinkedIn would be removing themselves from the vulnerability that every institution has had till now, it may be a little more complicated for Reddit, but it might be possible.\n\nOne way I see this happening would be to allow outside sources who are supported by Reddit users, through voting, they would be granted a stamp, or the ability to label users that they consider a problem. For example a suspected Russian troll would be labeled as a Russian troll.\n\nPerhaps the American medical Association might be granted this ability to label users, they could go after those who spread misinformation in regards to medical issues as “problematic”. Ideally there would be more than one organization judging users in specific or multiple categories, then when trust becomes an issue with anyone of them, they can be dropped, while others who have more integrity take there place.\n\nI think a users account should only be deleted when there is a request from more than one of these judgements systems, and even then there should be a clear record of what took place available for anyone to see.\n\nWe have to find ways to build solid institutions that are not subject to judgement, the way to do this is to separate data collection from the judgement dilemma. I would like to see the creation of new judgement systems that rely on their reputation.\n\nI don’t think I have everything worked out here, but I think it is clear that we must learn to separate judgements from data collection. For the sake of trust in our institutions.\n\nEdit: made some corrections \n\n\n\n",
