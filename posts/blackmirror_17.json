I saw Nosedive, got thinking about the episode (and China) and watched Friends for a while. I always watch one Black Mirror episode a week, leaving me time to think. So a week later I watched Playtest.\n\nI still have dreams about that episode to this very day; it scarred me probably for life.\n\nI ended up not watching Black Mirror for about 2.5 weeks, but got back into it when a dance at school was coming up and I started to get a little depressed because I can't find a date (it was a formal.). So I watched Shut Up and Dance.\n\nThat episode did 2 things to me. 1) I wasn't depressed anymore, I was kinda scared and 2) I became really paranoid with anything that has a camera.\n\nShut Up and Dance is one of my favourite episodes, but the WTF factor was really high. To be honest I couldn't think about anything else other than that episode for a week.\n\nI decided I can't watch Black Mirror until I \"calm down.\"\n\nThat was about 2 months ago; I watched San Junipero about 2 weeks ago. I still remember San Junipero, but it was too positive (lol) for me to continue Black Mirror for a little. But 2 months is kind of weird for a break. I started thinking about the episode more thoroughly, and it feels like I am watching the show again for the first time.\n\nI started watching Black Mirror again (after Shut Up and  Dance) because I started falling in love and I wanted to deny it and get it off of my mind and now I am bored so I may watch the next episode either today or tomorrow.",

Being stuck in that thing, even if Nish would treat it with affection and take it everywhere with her to see the world when travelling, she's still stuck in the fucking monkey. I'd probably ask Carrie if she wants to be deleted. Then again, we don't know if destroying the actual monkey would put Carrie out of her misery anyway.",

        "text": "There are some companies in BM like TCKR, that create machines that are cruely inhumane. Also nearly all research is done by private organisations.\n\nEven we learned that the EU banned the archangle program and the UN banned the Teddys, there are many technologies that clearly should be banned, but aren't. This kind of reminds me of some sort of night watchman state.\n\nAlso after the bee catastrophy some privat company took over ... and saved the UK from the apocalypse?! A pretty big resposibility for a company.\n\nEven a war against large scale of people is fought by a private milita instead of the US army or another federal force.\n\nWhile federal science seems to have been consumed by private science, federal legislation for scientific research is also nowhere to be found. I don't know whatever tech is behind the White Bear attraction park, but my guess would be in our world some federal agencies would test this tech before it could be used on anyone ... yeah also convicted killers.\n\nWhile this seems very strange, the shift of federal science to private science has already started. With a company like Alphabet Inc. \"owning\" 1,2% of the WORLDS GDP some sort of anarcho capitalism isn't that far fetched.\n\nIn todays science we also see private companys slowly out passing federal organisatons. For example: Space X, Blue Origin (NASA, ESA) or TAE Technologies in the field of fusion power.\n\nWhile private companies are far more after money than the goverment and far less concerned about public safty they test unfinished products in order to make more money quickly (Playtest, Archangle, Black Museum).\n\nIf you aren't convinced by now I have a last clue that hints directly to my hypothesis. Nosedive, Entire History of You and White Christmas. In all these episodes we see eye lenses, that are most likly designed by some private corp (I'm only 100% sure about Entire History of You, we see an add for the lense.) But even if they are private they are used by the goverment in Nosedive the Security Guad on the airport sets her on double damage and removes one star, in EHOY the airport security checks him with a look into his implant and in White Christmas they block his vision and block him from the other people. That all reminds me of the punishment for cyber crimes that these users aren't allowed use the internet anymore, but are in a waaaay more cruel way.\n\nTl,dr: There are quite a few hints that BM warns us also about the growing influence big companies have these days and are goint to gain in the future.",

I like this episode a lot, and it poses some difficult questions, such as:\n\n1) Can an artificial intelligence have a moral status, or is the mere fact of it being artificial enough to rule it out of the moral story?\n\n2) What are the ethics of blocking someone? Does the technology here portrayed create new and distinct issues; or does it merely exemplify already existing issues by pushing the idea to the extreme?\n\nI think these get at themes that run throughout the show more generally. Also, the suicide scene continues to haunt me.\n\nWhat do you all think?\n\nhttps://25yearslatersite.com/2018/03/26/black-mirror-white-christmas/",

When we got to Hang the DJ we were very perplexed watching it, but by the end it made us think of how we met online because of Black Mirror and how the episode fit so perfectly given our situation. It's become my favorite episode now and it just makes me smile thinking about it.\n\nNothing more, just wanted to share.",

Yorkie sees the timer count from 3 to zero and then the car crashes, foreshadowing the ending of the episode. It is also a reference to her own car accident that paralyzed her.  \n\n- Wes makes multiple comments about how much time he has left, implying Wes is a tourist and not a resident. Kelly also asks Yorkie if she is a tourist or resident, to which she replies it is her first time in San Junipero. \n\n- Yorkie makes reference to the fact that\nher family thinks she can‚Äôt do anything while she and Kelly were talking in the rain, obviously a tip to her paralysis. \n\n- When Kelly tries to come on to Yorkie, Yorkie makes the excuse that she is engaged to someone named Greg, who Kelly notes as ‚Äúelsewhere;‚Äù we learn later that Yorkie wants to marry Greg, her doctor in reality, in order to be euthanized and become a resident. \n\n- After Kelly and Yorkie have sex, Kelly notes that she was married once, alluding to the fact that Kelly‚Äôs husband, Richard, died and chose not to be uploaded (for he believed in an afterlife). \n\nPretty neat how they managed to shove all this in there, and still not give away the big reveal of what San Junipero is.",

        "text": "So in Playtest one of Cooper's fears is that he'll get early-onset Alzheimer just like his dad, it's a pretty big part of the episode. But what if he's already showing symptoms? When he tries to buy his ticket back to the US he's unable because someone had apparently stolen his credit card number and made a purchase but what if his number wasn't stolen? What if it was him who in a moment of abscent mindness made the purchase and was unable to remember it? I actually thought this would be the episode's twist when i saw it.\n\nSo yeah, that's my theory. There's really no more evidence to support this, in the time before he gets into the simulation Cooper's  memory seems to work just fine. Like, maybe i could also point out at when he almost forgot his passport or when he didn't know what SaitoGamer was despite having played one of their games but i feel like these are pretty normal things and it would be a bit of a stretch.\n\nAnyways, what do you think? Was it a clue left by Charlie Brooker or just a plot device to make Cooper stay in London?",
