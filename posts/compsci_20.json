I was pretty proud with the final thing so I decided I'd post it here.\n\n[The entire calculator in view.](https://i.redd.it/qogznsyhuud11.png)\n\n[Here's my little \\\\\"control area\\\\\" if you will, the red circled switch is essentially a 1bit memory address, just to save having two 16 bit input rows. the blue circled button is the reset button just to clear both pieces of memory on the calculator. You can also see the current values of the two memory units in top left in BCD, and the sum of them on the right \\(Also in BCD\\)](https://i.redd.it/yy3dz3unuud11.png)\n\n[The memory, two 2byte modules \\(The simulator I'm using allows you to create circuits and make \\\\\"integrated circuits\\\\\"\\) so I will show the inside of each of my created circuits.](https://i.redd.it/rqu98jqzuud11.png)\n\n[This is the inside of each of my 2byte memory items, it's just 16 1 bit modules stacked](https://i.redd.it/riy9dme6vud11.png)\n\n[This is my 1bit module, top switch resets it, second switch sets it to 1](https://i.redd.it/hfh30r6cvud11.png)\n\n[This is my adding chain to add the two values that are currently in memory. I tried to stay consistent with having the least significant bit on the left if horizontal and at the top if vertical.](https://i.redd.it/h83boswgvud11.png)\n\n[Each is a standard full adder circuit](https://i.redd.it/kg7p5itmvud11.png)\n\n[Then there's my binary to BCD converters \\(Binary Coded decimal for those of you who don't know\\) just because I really disliked having my answers in hex.](https://i.redd.it/35h5p38rvud11.png)\n\n[Here's the converter's inner workings, just a long string of conditional adders performing what is called the Dibble Dabble algorithm \\(I'm pretty it was called that\\)](https://i.redd.it/zqnh5a8wvud11.png)\n\n[Finally is my conditional adder, Just simple adds 3 to the input if it's greater than 4. I didn't take stack overflow into account here because in my usage it would never occur.](https://i.redd.it/hgkvqlz1wud11.png)\n\nAnd here are some examples of it working!\n\n[Easy one to start off](https://i.redd.it/g7ixwv09wud11.png)\n\n[Another one just to try and demonstrate the BCD's functionality](https://i.redd.it/u66u6r7dwud11.png)\n\n[And yet another](https://i.redd.it/9qpul66iwud11.png)\n\nI'm open to all/any feedback you can give on ways I can improve this and such :)",

But I want to know more!\n\nI talk frequently about API integrations, User Provisioning, Security, Architecture, SAML SSO, Salesforce ecosystem, etc at a VERY high level. I'm pretty good at it even. But there's not much behind it.\n\nWhat I want to know is - EVERYTHING!

As an example, I'll use Intel and their development of the 8700k: \n\n-Intel's CEO says hey I want new processor to compete against AMD's Ryzen.\n\n-CEO's message relays to a product manager(PM) \n\n-PM gathers the system/computer architect(s) and say \"hey we need a new CPU. it needs to fit these costs, speed, power.\" \n\n(meetings are held)\n\n-system architect designs the chipset using a hardware simulator software and builds the blueprint\n\n(more meetings are held)\n\n-architect(s) now hand off their blueprint to engineers.\n\n-using the blueprint, the engineers create the implementation using hardware description language for the defining of the elementary logic gates.\n\n(more meetings)\n\n-once done, it is sent off for photolithography.\n\n(production)\n\n-boom. now you have an 8700k? \n\n-happy Intel CEO?\n\n\nIf you don't mind, could you use any real life example to explain to me their process of tackling the creation of a chipset. It doesn't have to be Intel or whatever. \n\nWhat's the order? Does the system architect have to design the architecture first then the developers can engineer? Who's in charge of the microarchitecture vs instruction set architecture. For example, Intel creating the 8700k processor. There's multiple modules within the processor: ALU, Control unit, Memory(registers and cache). Are these modules designed by the system architect?  Within those modules, I'm guessing they are comprised of other modules which are composed of logic gates? Are these logic gate modules designed by the developers? Within those logic gates, there lies the circuitry? Who does what? \n\n\n",

The Masters will have theory math courses and CS courses that will range from understanding statistical data mining, machine learning to learning core computer science courses that cover large scale distributed computing, etc. I am hoping after graduating I can get a really good CS career and hopefully land a really good job with these drop dead skills. The only problem is I will be taking out massive loans 30k per year. The way I look at it is that its worth gaining the top core CS/data science skills then impress companies with real raw talent. (I also am itching to do research in the summer with a professor who is currently designing apps for disabled patients). Do u think I am putting myself into a tight pickle here. What are my options after graduating realistically? I have no advice besides the academics at university",

You could hash the user's source IP address this way and publish that hash.  Neither the public nor the poster could reverse it realistically, even with the poster knowing their own IP address.

I was wondering if any of you have strategies for systematically writing your tests. \n\nBesides hearing about personal experiences, I'm also willing to do some reading up on the topic, if you have recommendations. I've already read the chapter in code complete 2, but not much else. ",

I plan on seeing how organic goes, and if that's also a struggle i plan on making the switch to cs. I figured it'll probably take me an extra year of undergrad, but probably worth it if i don't have to go to grad school to make money. I also have no prior knowledge of CS \n\nAny advice would be appreciated ",
