        "text": "This  is a comprehensive deep-dive about one of my favorite renditions of the  song \"Louie Louie\" by John Belushi for the movie \"Animal house\" and its  soundtrack.\n\n**What is Louie Louie?**\n\n[Louie Louie](https://youtu.be/xKt75jUuKJY) is a r&amp;b song written by Richard Berry and released in 1957. It is best known for the 1963 hit version by the Kingsmen.\n\n**What is Animal House?**\n\nAnimal  House is a 1978 American comedy film directed by John Landis and  written by Harold Ramis, Douglas Kenney and Chris Miller. The film is  about a trouble-making fraternity whose members challenge the authority  of the dean of the fictional Faber College.\n\n**The soundtrack**\n\nThe  AH soundtrack has 14 songs, most of which (8) are the normal recordings  of songs that appeared in the movie that you can listen to anywhere  else, 4 songs are original compositions, and 2 song are rerecorded with  John Belushi as the singer. [https://music.apple.com/ua/album/national-lampoons-animal-house-original-motion-picture/1443075373](https://music.apple.com/ua/album/national-lampoons-animal-house-original-motion-picture/1443075373)\n\nOn  YouTube, there are always going to be re-uploads of songs/soundtracks  to listen to for free, and the AH sound track is no exception. You can  find it [right here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmzP977za2bJvtCF8V4XST68Ts-72u2BA).  If you go to track 2 and listen to Louie Louie, it sounds different  than the free preview on the iTunes stare. Weird, isn't it?\n\nI thought this was weird too, so I searched up it up and watched a different video, this time [a video of the original vinyl record](https://youtu.be/3EV-wlliZCs). And it was the iTunes version.\n\n**The differences**\n\n[The vinyl version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EV-wlliZCs) has a more mellowed out, tired sounding Belushi, with washed out background music in my opinion. Where as the [YouTube soundtrack version uploaded by snakech16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nU5KO65bOOs&amp;list=PL3NA9nqI8HGOtRYdaToWqF_31ARtzHVMe&amp;index=2) has a more upbeat, while still a bit tired, version of Belushi.\n\nWhile  I do concede that the snakech version sounding a bit could be different  due to the lower quality of the upload,  but that would not change the  \"tiredness\" of Belushi. I would think that pitch would be the factor on  why they are different, but I don't know how to manipulate pitch of an  audio file, let alone if that is the issue.\n\nAnyway,  what you you all think? also is this the correct subreddit to post  something like this? is not please tell me where to post and I will  remove post immediately. Thank you for your time.",
