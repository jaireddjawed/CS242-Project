        "text": "I saw people last night\n\nDay :1\nLast night I woke up at 2:00 am and was in bed until I saw three figures in my closet. I was scared shitless. it reminded me of my family .the figures consisted of a man abt 5’10 a woman abt 5’5 and a small child abt 4’10.I didn’t believe it was true so I punched my wall until my hand bled and then. I fell asleep and when I awoke the blood was gone and no scab or scar.but everything felt real it hurt when it happened.\nDay:2 \nI called my friend which I’m not gonna name so imma call her Ann. Ann told me to sleep with a sharpie so if it happened again I could draw on the walls and see if it stayed.Then they came back and it was the same bunch of figures the three but they came and stood at my closet looking staring down at me. Before I fell asleep I wrote on the wall everywhere I wrote till the tip broke then I fell asleep.\nDay:3\nI awoke and the sharpie was gone and I was freaked out but the sharpie was still broken. I called my friend which I won’t name but we can call him John.I called John in the morning and he told me to sleep with a knife and my bible incase they’re demons and a note to communicate with them. I started to hallucinate again and then the only one now was the girl and she started to giggle and I couldn’t breathe and was paralyzed in fear then I blinked and she was gone then John called and we talked.

        "text": "Years ago, I witnessed something I should not have. For the sake of discretion, I will adopt the name Sarah for this post, although it doesnt really matter. I was born and raised in a small town in germany. Where exactly is irrelevant. I am certain that what is happening isnt just limited to me or to my country, which is why I have decided to make this post. \n\nFor some context, I live alone with nothing but my loving grandma and our dog. We live in a small appartement consisting of my grandma's bedroom, my own room, a larger living room, a very small kitchen and an even smaller bathroom. This will be important later as I detail what exactly is happening. \n\nFurthermore, important to understand is that our apartment is build with an hallway-type system, where you have one long, thin hallway with the entrance on one end and the small bathroom at the other, four doorways leading to the remaining rooms I have listed prior. The living room also has a door leading to a decently sized balcony. The balcony can be overseen through a very large triple window hetup we had installed recently, courtesy of our landlord. Especially at night, half the living room would now be cast in a dark blue shadow, mixed from both, moonlight and the night itself.\n\nIt was the home I grew up in, with a beautiful view out of every window and only a handful of morally questionable neighbors to irritate me. I was happy here, until precisely two years ago. \n\nTwo years ago, June 2021, I was awoken from my safe and deep sleep when I heard a weird noise coming from my window. Now, we are on the second level of our building and while we do have a tree behind the house, it's way to far away from any window to disturb us. \n\nI was, for obvious reasons, confused and irritated, but didnt think much of it at first. However, I personally struggle with keeping up on my hydration on a serious medical level, so whenever I wake up I have this unquenchable desire for some Water or fruit Juice - anything to stop my stomach from aching. \n\nFeeling the pain once again, I decided to quickly go through our hallway into the kitchen to fix myself a quick drink before heading back to bed. \n\nAt night, our hallway always unsettled me. Sure, I had the glorious beam of light coming from our hallway lamp to protect me, but the switch was literally on the other end of the hallway. There was something off about this hallway at night. Not necessarily the darkness, either. Due to my grandma being claustrophobic, we leave pretty much all the doors open. Walking through our hallway just makes you feel exposed, there's a doorway providing a corner to hide behind every two steps. \n\nBrave as I was, i carried on, getting to the kitchen and pouring myself a nice, cold glass of water. And there it was again. The noise. A tapping of some kind? I wanted to chalk it off as some animal, maybe a bird having interest in our windows. But I got curious. This lead me to making the biggest mistake of my life. \n\nI decided to listen for the tapping, trying to pinpoint the exact origin of the noise. The livingroom. \n\nBeing brave as always, I quickly turned on the hallway lights, then peeked into the livingroom - only for my heart to almost stop. \n\nOutside, on the balcony, a tall, slim figure with a massive, disturbing grin observed me. He stood there, his head leaning to one side like that of a puppy after he saw that I noticed him. I was paralyzed by fear when his grin grew larger and he slowly pressed himself against the window, making more of his physical features much clearer. \n\nHe seemed humanoid in form, having a slender human-like torso. He had two wide, thin shoulders leading to two extremely long and thin arms! His legs seemed to mirror the form if the arms, abnormally long and slender. His neck seemed almost human in a disturbing way, while his head was anything but human. He had this almost cartoon-like oversized grin with Massive teeth, grey eyes with clearly visible veins bulging out of his face and a heavily scarred nose that reminded me of Chris Walker from Outlast! \n\nIn retrospect, you couldnt reasonably blame me for thinking I was just dreaming or hallucinating! However, there was something off. I wanted to go the child's route, storm my grandma's room and cry myself out about the freshly discovered monster! But I did not dare to look away from it. With some courage, I turned to face the direction my grandma's room was in, then quickly turned back to whatever this thing was.\n\nHe slowly lifted one of his arms, revealing a long, spindly hand that honestly reminded me more of a spider than of a human appendage. The fact that his fingers where adorned by long, yellowish fingernails did not help. He lifted his finger against the glass window, tapping three times before pointing at me. He then pointed into the direction of my grandma's room, shushing at me. He tapped three times again, leaving some kind of black mud on the window. I passed out and Fell unconcious shortly after. \n\nWhen I woke up, I was in the local Hospital, sorrounded by doctors, nurses and my grandma. A tube was connected to my arm, slowly pumping blood into my veins. I tried to explain what happened but the doctors quickly brushed it off as the delusions and hallucinations of a dehydrated mind. I was given medication and allowed back home after enough fluid had been pumped into me. \n\nI was almost inclined to believe the doctor's explaination on what I saw, but when we returned home, I saw that the black mud was still on the window just like it was when I passed out! This made me wary, and for good reason. \n\nI never forgot the noise of the tapping, it felt distinct and threatening. More so did I never forget the amount : He tapped three times, and my First encounter with him was two years ago. Ever since, I constantly see him stalk me in some way or another! I find claw markings on random wooden furniture, get random goosebumps whenever passing the livingroom and constantly feel like im being watched by something! \n\nFor the last two years, this \"Mud-Man\" as I've come to call him, has been stalking me im ways no Human could. I find tiny drops of black mud in my closet and occasionally see a shape similar to his in the corner of my eye. \n\nI have tried to do research on this entity, but all I got where results for the Slenderman and the Grossman, which is am ancient german folktale about a tall, slender figure that kidnaps children. \n\nNo one wants to believe me, thinking I just have some brain trauma or unsolved delusions since I passed out. I have no ways to find out what it going on or how to defend myself. And we are getting closer to june : the month I first saw the Mud-Man. Im afraid. \n\nThe last few months, we repeatedly found deep clawmarks and drops of black mud on our windows and balconydoor. My grandma believes this to be some sort of animal. She doesnt believe my Story and neither does she show any interest in the mud. But due to being scared that it's a burglar, I atleast maned to convince her to repeatedly swap out the locks. I dont think that will be enough. \n\nWe are closing in on the third tap, the Mud-Man wants inside and I doubt I'll be able to stop him. I am spending this night, wary of my sorroundings, to type down this post. To warn you all. To inspire you to prepare yourself before HE arrives. And I am certain that He will. Maybe not today or tomorrow, but eventually, He will. I can hear him clawing at the lock, tapping on the windows. Never investigate. Do *Not* let him in. You may wish me luck for the remainder of my time, but I do not suppose it will be of any use. He's here. Soon.",

        "text": "I've always been a fan of history.\n\nWhat can I say? I like hearing about the stories of the times. The spirit of them. Every time my teachers sent an assignment home from school about talking to family members who'd seen some time period, I would practically bounce off the walls. I love it all, every aspect of it, from documenting everything to hearing the stories themselves.\n\nI always gravitated toward a particular family member; my grandfather, Daniel. When I was a really little kid, he was about 80 to 85, stooped low from years of hunching, clutching onto his cane like his life depended on it. He was always... quiet. My mom and my aunts always doted on him, constantly telling any outsider of the family that he was the best father, best role model, best everything. But I didn't really see it. He was just silent whenever I came into the room. Sometimes I would play next to him, attempting to break him out of his shell, but he always averted his gaze from mine, old-person shakes dominating his demeanor. Still, when I asked questions about his life from the 1930's to the 80's, he would always answer. \n\nHis stories were always entertaining, to say the least. He told me a bit about his father, my great-grandfather, Peter, who died before I was born. How he grew up in London, eventually moved to America, fell in love with a woman and had kids. How he watched the wars, how he was lucky enough to dodge the draft for Vietnam because of... something. He never did tell me what.\n\nHe died when I turned thirteen. It was a suicide, he downed his sleeping pills, drank a half-bottle of vodka, kicked the bucket right next to my grandmother, Alice. She was a no-nonsense type of woman, washed my mouth out with soap once for saying \"damn\" in the kitchen in front of her, but I'd never seen her so solemn at the funeral. She didn't exactly cry, but I caught her out of the corner of my eye wiping tears away with a proper, crisp black handkerchief. He killed himself the night of Valentine's Day. They had a picnic that day, same as every year.\n\nAbout a week later, Alice decided to clean out his old study, I guess in a half-hearted attempt to forget the betrayal Daniel forced on her. Dozens and dozens of full boxes of documents, records, letters, and newspaper clippings were generously dumped into our attic, locked away by my mother who'd seen a black widow spider up there once and forbade me from even looking up there in case the spider had other ideas for us. So everything sat, creaking and collapsing under the weight of years passing by, and soon, I turned 22, freshly graduating out of college.\n\nMy mother had invited me over to help her pack up. Alice was long gone, I was grown up, and she decided that she would start spending her pre-golden years over in a condo by the ocean. Hey, I respect the hustle, I would wanna get away from the town of Butt-Fuck Nowhere, too (fake name if it isn't obvious). So I came over to the house around noon today, and began to work.\n\nThings were going well. We managed to pack all of her clothes in the span of about twenty minutes, started stacking books and trinkets she had lying around the house and placing them gently in boxes next to the front door. Soon we were done. We only needed to pack her personal belongings, and the movers would handle the furniture, the appliances, and everything else.\n\nBut somehow... my mind wandered to the attic. To what was in the attic. So as my mother sat down to rest on the couch, propping her feet up and dozing off easily, I snagged the attic key from the vase she had hidden it in eight years ago and sneakily pulled the attic's ladder down.\n\nDespite the fact that nobody had been up there in at least eight years, there wasn't much in the way of a foreboding, unforgiving, loud sound emanating from the ladder's rope that would give away what I was up to. In fact, it was like it also went out of its way to make sure I could get away with my investigation. Like it too wanted me to uncover the secrets left behind by my grandfather.\n\nI wish now that it didn't.\n\nThe attic was damp, and that was never a good sign. I inwardly groaned, because I knew some of the papers and boxes were already gone. Humidity likes to crawl into the confines of papers, warping and bloating them, making them illegible and hard to even pick up, let alone to read. But even from where I stood, I could see that quite a few of the initial boxes actually intact, set on top of Alice's old antique dining table she never wanted us to throw out.\n\nAnd on the small stack of boxes sat a journal.\n\nIt was definitely dilapidated, but it wasn't really too destroyed, even for its age. And from there, I could see that it was... old. Way too old for me to look at comfortably. But it also seemed... preserved. Like someone was trying to take care of it. Something didn't seem right.\n\nI figured it was okay to take a peek. I mean, I love history, and this seemed to be important to my family's records. So I delicately opened the hardback cover, and immediately realized that the handwriting was different than anyone in my family's. It was loopy, quite fancy, and the word choice, diction, and spelling suggested that the writer was British. Okay, made sense. Daniel's father, my great-grandfather, Peter, was British. Explained a bit.\n\nThe writing started normally. Mostly letters to Daniel, who was a fully grown adult at the time, asking him about his life like he couldn't have been asked himself. I could tell that things were tense between Peter and Daniel, and perhaps that was why Daniel never seemed to keep pictures of his family around the house like Alice did with hers. There was some sort of huge falling-out back in the 60's, and both Peter and Daniel never seemed to recover.\n\nEverything was written in about the span of two months, but the journal was completely full. Like Peter had so much to say. So I planted my butt on a dusty, canvas-covered seat, and began to read.\n\n*\"To Daniel. I have so much I desire to say to you. But I am on the last of my days, and though I wish you would come visit, perhaps it is best that you do not. I have a story I would like to tell you. Something that happened to me in 1858.*\n\n*I was a young man at the time, perhaps twenty-one. A friend, George, and myself, had decided to visit Whitechapel for the winter season, to see our families. I was not married to Florence at the time, but had been courting, and I missed her terribly. So the trip had been needed. While we travelled, the weather had grown so horrible. To the point where ice on the trees turned into spikes, and wind blew them into the ground at full-force. It became dangerous, and we were forced to reside in a bed and breakfast for a few nights.*\n\n*It was... unusual, to say the least. I had frequented Whitechapel for years, and I had never seen it before. It was cozy, quite large, homey and warm. George and I were immensely thankful for the accommodation, and I could tell that this would be our favourite bed and breakfast yet. It was clean, well-kept, and as we shook the snow and sludge from our coats, tromping out the ice from our boots on the pristine flooring, a woman descended the staircase to greet us.*\n\n*She was also unusual, just like her abode. She wore all black, a classic mourning dressed donned with a black shawl, her raven hair massed high on her head, and on the crown of her hairline sat a circlet of fine red rubies. She smiled politely at us, and we were helplessly smitten without even hearing a word.* \n\n*\"Welcome to my inn, gentlemen. My name is Lady Amelia, and I am the governess here. I have beds to offer you if you can pay, of course.\"*\n\n*Lord forgive me, for I was not thinking of your mother then. It was like Amelia had gripped my mind with claws and kept it close to her heart without even saying a word. Before either of us realized, we had payed for a week's stay.* \n\n*\"Thank you very much, sirs. Before I show you to your rooms, I would like to state that there are three rules I have for my affairs. The first is that i do not establish personal relationships with my tenants. I hope that is understandable.\"* \n\n*\"Oh, very,\" George whispered, licking his lips once as he stared at her. Amelia's eyes were captivating but... there was something wrong. It was like she was looking at us with desire. With... hunger. Like she was assessing us and our sizes, but not with benevolent intent. \"I can't imagine wanting to bed tenants like us.\"* \n\n*Her mouth had twisted into the ghost of a smile, pulling the shawl around her arms a little tighter, and I could have sworn then that I saw something. George was much too entranced, too tempted by lust, but I could not stop repeating what it was that I saw in my mind.* \n\n*Something in her hair... moved. It had the appearance of an arachnid's leg, segmented and furry, as it pulled itself into the elaborate mass she sported on her head. I suppose it thought itself as far too exposed, and it occurred so quickly that I had no idea at the moment what to even begin thinking.* \n\n*\"Such a fine sense of humor you have. My second rule is that I mustn't be disturbed past nine. When that clock rings true, my door will be locked, and you will have no way of reaching me until morning.\"*\n\n*That rule struck me as unusual, as well. What sort of governess refrains from assisting her tenants, especially those who pay to stay? it seemed as though she was using all humanly restraint possible from even establishing trust with us. A pinprick of awareness snaked through my head, and soon I was able to listen to her honeyed words a little clearer.*\n\n*\"Lastly, I expect you both to live up to your commitments. You paid for a week, and for a week you shall stay. Nothing more, nothing less.\"* \n\n*There was something wrong, indeed. Her words were delivered kindly, but they were threatening in nature.*\n\n*She had just let us know that we were not allowed to leave until the week was out.* \n\n*Amelia clapped her hands twice, and a servant came darting out from the kitchen. Her eyes were covered in a dirty rag, her hands wringing in worry.*\n\n*\"Drosophila, take these fine gentlemen to their rooms. Breakfast will be served at nine.\"* \n\n*Drosophila nodded hurriedly and practically dragged us up the stairs. The rooms were of a stately sort, and there seemed to be nothing out of place, nothing of worry at all.*\n\n*But Drosophila pulled me aside as George flopped into bed, swaddling himself with the sheets as he drifted into a deep slumber.*\n\n*\"Please leave. Leave now.\"* \n\n*The door down the hall clicked shut as she whispered.*\n\n*\"W-what? Why?\" I demanded, but she just shook her head fervently.* \n\n*\"Please listen to me. You must leave. Your friend is much too far gone now, but you have a chance. Think of your family.\"* \n\n*That gave me pause. My family? Who did this servant think I was? But I was inexplicably drawn to the mental image of my darling Florence, my wife, and you, my dear Daniel. How you were waiting for me at our summer home, wondering with your bright eyes when I would come home to see you once again.* \n\n*\"Please go--\" Drosophila whimpered, pushing her damaged hands against my polished chest, and as I glanced downward, I noticed that she was missing fingertips. Three out of five of the fingers on each hand were shortened artificially, or gone entirely. As I looked closer, it was as if a veil was lifted from over my sight, and I could finally understand the morbid realization tugging at me from the moment I'd set foot into the abode.* \n\n*Parts of her were missing, like they had been taken out of her with nothing left behind. She had puncture marks all down and through her neck, and the dirty rag was stained with rusty brown blood, like her eyes had been taken, too. She had little to no hair, several large clumps missing, the scalp a furious red and pulsing with pus and blood, like something had feasted on her skull. She wore rags as if they were a dress, walking with a pronounced limp, gaunt and emaciated like she had no opportunity to eat in weeks.*\n\n*\"She has no interest in you! You can still walk free, lest she change her mind,\" Drosophila cried desperately, just as George sat upright in bed. \"Please, just--\"* \n\n*I pushed her slightly to the side as George volleyed himself out of the made bed, his eyes a glassy white as he shrieked bloody murder. It was as if he were set alight with flame. He danced and writhed as if his skin were being burned as he awoke, throwing himself into the door of our room before breaking it down with impossible strength.*\n\n*\"Arachne! Let me free, sow your many withered fields with my ruby red blood!\" George screamed as he vaulted towards Amelia's door. \"You set my heart alight, you beautiful thing! I have nothing more to lose, nothing left to give except my very soul!\"* \n\n*It was as if he were under a trance, cast with an incurable spell, and as he forced open the door to Amelia's room, I was helpless. Helpless to run, I could not bear to run without George. I was forced to watch, to watch and listen, as my dear friend toppled onto the woman's floor.* \n\n*Amelia was topless, her corset flung to the floor for the night as she prepared for bed. She was incredibly curvy, shapely, and I felt the tips of my ears and cheeks bloom with color as I witnessed her. But I brought Florence to the forefront of my mind, believing that there was no room in my heart for this wicked seductress, and that seemed to break my curse entirely.* \n\n*She had been brushing her hair, long hair that touched the backs of her knees, but it was as if the hair itself was alive. It throbbed and shivered with movement, and I could only stare as the rubies of her circlet blinked. As Amelia looked down upon George, her eyes saddened with pity, before she uttered a tiny, \"oh, again.\"*\n\n*Then I could only watch, as Drosophila screamed, when the spider atop Amelia's head swallowed her face with its strong pincers. Soon the neck, the torso, the waist, the legs, were all ingested, as if they were never there at all. The only thing that remained was a shadowy silhouette of a strangely furry black widow spider, lunging itself towards George. It was impossibly huge, standing at well over nine feet tall, and each thud of the hairy feet against the floor felt like a miniature earthquake.* \n\n*\"What the hell is that!\" I shouted as it grabbed George up, releasing an unearthly, demonic screech. It tossed him into the air, his lifeless body snatched by the jaws of the unholy thing before his body exploded with force, blood and gore showering both Drosophila and I. George broke in half, never blinking, breathing, only releasing a small and weak groan, before the spider began to eat him alive.*\n\n*\"Please, follow me, sir!\" Drosophila wept as she grabbed for my hands. She wrenched me towards the staircase with amazing strength, following on my heels as we descended, and she practically threw me out of the small abode. She stayed still in the doorway, hands on the threshold, as if she were attempting to drag herself out with me.* \n\n*\"Never return to this place! You are marked by the curse of Arachne, and if you dare to search for her, everything... everyone you've ever held dear will perish. She will know,\" Drosophila warned tearfully, pulling up her rag from over her poor eyes to rub them without much conscious thought. I realized then that they were not missing, not gone, like some other parts of her. No... they were poisoned, resembling runny eggs as her left eye ran with acidic tears. They were red, blue, purple... so incredibly infected it was a wonder that they had not just fallen out of her skull entirely. \"Please. Just forget. Forget what happened. Forget you came here. And forget Lady Amelia.\"*\n\n*I must do the same. I must forget Lady Amelia. Daniel, you should know that woman is the devil. She is evil, and she will stop at nothing to find you. I hope you can forgive me someday, but I was curious. The curiosity, with mystery of it all... it ate me alive. And I doomed you. Doomed your family, your descendants. I only hope God can properly judge me for what I've done.*\n\n*Arachne is the devil, and she will stop at nothing to find you and your family. Just like she found me.\"* \n\nHoly shit. \n\nI'm typing out everything. I read it about ten minutes ago, and I'm still in shock. I expected something different. Like... I don't know. A falling out, an argument, something. \n\nPeter did eventually go looking for more information, according to some library slips in the 1920's. He wrote some of his findings in the journal, but at that point, his handwriting had deteriorated so much with age and madness that it's impossible to read. All I can make out is the name \"Arachne,\" \"goddess,\" \"bloodline,\" and \"Daniel.\" it's so strange. What did Daniel have to do with all this? He never went on the trip, and only Peter came out. Did he tell his family what horrors he'd seen, and did searching for Arachne cause a chain reaction? \n\nBut the real kicker was when I picked up the journal to put it on the table. A photograph and a letter came tumbling out from somewhere within the notes, hitting the floor with a soft hiss. As I picked up the photograph, cocking my head a little, I realized what I was looking at. \n\nA soft-faced woman, with dark, intense eyes, shrouded herself in a shawl, covering a mourning dress, a small, evil smile quirked up on her face as she faced the lens. Behind her was what I can only assume was the original bed and breakfast, and the back of the photo only stated, \"Bed and Breakfast, 1858,\" in Peter's loopy, slanting handwriting. \n\nAnd the letter just reads...\n\n*\"Dear Daniel.*\n\n*I was incredibly saddened to hear of the death of your father, Peter. He was a good man, a committed family man. There aren't many of those in the world anymore.* \n\n*He visited me once with a friend, they both had shown up for dinner. I hope you'll do the same.* \n\n*I'm located in Whitechapel, London. You should visit me, and bring your family. You'll never be amiss at the bed and breakfast, I assure you. I would love to savor your company.*\n\n*Yours truly, Lady Amelia.*\n\n*February 14th, 2015\"*",

I don't know how to handle this situation, and I'm both afraid and paranoid. This whole situation has been affecting my daily life, and I feel completely lost. Any advice would be appreciated regarding this, I barely feel safe in my own home anymore. I'll explain what happened recently to cause me to feel this way below. I also have some previous posts on my account and a link to my YouTube channel where I go more in-depth on stuff that is going on so you guys can get a better picture of what I'm going through right now.\n\nI had an old Rottweiler-Pitt Bull mix named Wyatt. I’ve had him since I was a baby, he was probably around 16-17. Huge dog, around 120lbs, but a big softie. He was very protective of me, and he would even chase away foxes and coyotes back when we had chickens. He would never hurt anyone, unless they tried to harm me or my animals. I would let him outside every few hours or so to prevent him from having any accidents inside the house because he was getting older and couldn't really control his bladder. He also had bad arthritus so I would have to help him up if he layed down. He usually would stay outside for 10 minutes or so (sometimes longer so he could lay in the sun,) then he scratches at the door to be let back in. No barking or anything, he only barked to alert me if something or someone he didn't recognize was outside. I let him out about 2 weeks ago in the evening, he never scratched on the door. After 45 minutes or so I began to get worried, so I went out to check on him. I spent a good 20 minutes searching before I found his body behind my shed, his head torn off from his body. I couldn’t find his head.\n\nHis body had no bite marks and no wounds, just his head ripped off. It wasn’t a clean slice, like a sword; it was like it was TORN. There was no signs of struggle around, and I didn’t hear him yelp or bark, absolutely nothing. Just a pretty big puddle of what looked like fresh blood under him and around his neck where his head was torn off. I have no idea how long he was dead for before I found him, but his body was still kind of warm and stiff, like he hadn't been dead for that long. He also had fresh blood under him, and seemed to still be bleeding a bit from his neck. Safe to say I booked it out of there, and only came back the next day to retrieve his body and bury him.\n\nThis same exact thing happened to my cat Smokey a while back, but he was covered in bite marks. I came to the conclusion it was probably coyotes, as those are pretty common around here. I don't know if it's just me being paranoid, but I think both of them dying very similarly must mean they were connected in some way. But, I don't think coyotes can just kill a 120lbs dog without any sounds or struggling, let alone tearing his head off of his body. I'm not sure what could've killed them anymore. I don't have any wolves nearby, so the safest conclusion that I can come up with is some human. But then again, a human doesn't leave canine bite marks. I've also been considering that creepy ass deer could be the cause for their deaths, but I don't want to think about that thing right now.\n\nSpeaking of the deer, I haven't actually seen it around recently. I saw it once really late at night, I'm talking maybe 1:00am. It was just standing near my pool on all fours, it's jaw just hanging. I don't know if it was just difficult to see because it was night, but it looks like it lacks eyes now?? I can't tell if this is the same deer that is somehow changing, or if it's several different deer. I don't think it saw me when I peeked out of the blinds, it was just slowly walking around and making these weird gurgling sounds. That was 2 days before Wyatt was killed, and I haven't seen it since.\n\nAside from that, I also had 2 of my cats dead a month or so back, too. Their heads weren’t torn off, but they were laid in front of my door in a way that means they could’ve only be placed there by someone or something. They were laying on top of eachother, streached out with their nose touching the others tail, right in front of my front door.\n\nI’ve called the cops, and they’ve come to my house and told me they literally cannot do anything without evidence of someone being on my property. They told me not to worry too much because it probably was coyotes or some stray dogs. I’ve set up 4 motion detection security cameras around my property, and the cops recommended that I leave the house until I feel safe. I’m currently staying upstate in a motel until I feel safe enough to return. My friend Malory is watching the animals for me.\n\nI’m just really scared and don’t know what to do. I already set up cameras and I’m staying upstate for a few days to get my bearings back, but I just feel so uncomfortable and unsafe in my home. Any advice on what I can do to protect myself and my animals would be appreciated.\n\nAlso, as a quick side note; if someone who is reading this did this to my poor animals and you're unlucky enough that I catch you, I'll slith your throat then rip your head off like you did to my animals. You don't deserve to rest easy at night knowing what you've done, and I'll make sure that you die slowly and painfully. Rot in hell.",

        "text": "*[On the killing fields between a pillow and a head]*\n\nBy mid-winter the war was already lost. The soldiers mustered rank and file, thin and slouching. For all their brave victories, they had suffered a defeat of morale. None of them had expected the war to rage quite so long, nor to drag as it had in the quiet between the screams of battle where a failing breath during the night was as devastating as any other grievous bodily wound. \n\nLieutenant Nameis should have been a Captain by now. Captain Casco had fallen three nights prior but the fighting hadn’t ebbed long enough for an official change in command. If Nameis had stopped for his moment of self congratulatory pomp, it would have been for his honour alone and likely soured the men against him. He couldn’t appear so callous, so he remained a lieutenant to no one but death. \n\nSuch was their endless struggle. A thing that now seemed pointless and surreal, an automatic routine of brutality for brutality’s sake, inuring one and all to the smell of blood and the slippery feel of aging entrails underfoot.  Victory was now couched in the rush of novelty, of new violence that could be mistaken for creativity—art—to a mind that knew only pain. \n\nOn this particular day, the soldiers mustered again and Lieutenant Nameis walked the line and a trussed girl from a nearby village screamed to be released. She spoke the language of the enemy and that had been enough. Now she begged in her bastard tongue. Nameis couldn’t speak it himself. He had relied on Captain Casco for things like that. But he knew a few words from repetition alone. \n\n“Eska! Molo Dalime!” *Please. Have Mercy.*\n\nThe soldiers were slouching, thin, starved for victory. Nameis owed it to them and the girl would provide. \n\n—\n\nI was too distracted to enjoy my meal. The tater tots were fine, I’m sure. Rachel’s Aioli was probably excellent. I had made the burgers and knew exactly what to expect from them. Sautéed shiitake mushrooms, melted double cream Brie, lean beef, arugula, a lemon zested Bernaise and a lightly toasted brioche bun. Sweet and bright and nutty and fatty, all in perfect balance that was perfectly lost on me. \n\nI had stolen the recipe from a restaurant that we used to love. The first time we went, I had ordered the burger and Rachel had ordered something less memorable and halfway through we switched plates. Within a month, the waitstaff knew what she’d order ahead of time. And then we had Eddie and going out became a rarity. \n\nDuring the first few years, my making her favorite burger at home would have made her wet. If Eddie was down for the night, we would have fucked quietly:, giggling and hushing and biting pillows like we were the kids and Eddie was a tenuously sleeping parent just down the hall. \n\nNow, the burger smelled the same, tasted the same, but Rachel seemed lost in a staring contest with her wine glass as I watched Eddie with an uneasy knot in my stomach. \n\n“You didn’t cook this right, Paul.”\n\nI had been ‘Dad’ once and Eddie was far too young to be such a shit. \n\n“It’s white bread, cheddar and a patty, Eddie. I made it how you—“\n\n“No! You made it gray! It’s not supposed to be gray!”\n\nRachel shuddered as she always did when Eddie went from a simmer to a boil. Cooper’s face twisted into distress as his plastic spoon clattered against the tray of his high chair. A moment later he was wailing and Rachel looked wedged between despondency and tears. \n\n“Stop fucking crying, Pooper! Wahh!—“\n\n“Eddie! Enough!”\n\n“—Waaahh! Waahhh!”\n\nRachel didn’t look anywhere in particular as she addressed the table. She didn’t make any real effort to be heard. \n\n“I—I can’t. I’m sorry, honey. But—“\n\nShe stood, lifted Cooper into her arms and in a movement that seemed more reflex than thought out, reached for her wine glass. Her fingers were inches away from the stem as Eddie’s hand darted across the table and swiped it onto its side. The wine spilled, the glass shattered and Rachel deflated even more. Her eyes welled and Eddie stared at his mother—my loving wife—with complete indifference. \n\n“I’m not cleaning that up, mommy.” Flat. \n\nRachel left crying and I felt hollow and the untended wine dribbled off the table to join a dozen other stains on a carpet that Rachel and I had chosen together. Then I watched as Eddie separated his burger into ragged halves. He dragged one through the puddle on the table. Held it up and watched the red wine drip from his meat and cheese and bread. Smiled. \n\n“I’m full, Paul. Nameis and I are going to go and play.”\n\nHe lifted his toy leopard by the head and left me alone at a table with three uneaten meals. I was too tired to fight, too tired to insist, so I gathered the broken glass for the trashcan and mopped up the wine and thought of how the meals would taste if things were different. \n\n—\n\n“Every parent feels guilty, Paul. It doesn’t mean we’ve done anything wrong. But you know as well as I that children don’t come with an instruction book.”\n\nDoctor Foster had a tone for public radio. A sleepy English drawl that might’ve been calculated to soothe. Rachel liked him. She’d say that one day, he just might say something useful, that all of his advice seemed pragmatic. But I saw him cynically, as the purveyor of a dream. \n\n“I know why I feel guilty, Doc. And I know I haven’t done anything wrong, but every blog and podcast says that I have.”\n\n“Do they?”\n\n“They don’t tell children to change themselves. I’m the one with the responsibility to do something different so of course it’s my fault when Eddie does something—Jesus Christ—you know what? Just tell me how to feel nothing. Can you do that?”\n\n“Why don’t you tell me about something specific that you’re having a problem with and we can work on that.”  He smiled pleasantly, eyes patiently receptive. I loathed the man at times like this. \n\n“He pissed on his brother two days ago. Rachel had just changed Cooper and Eddie waited for the first opportunity and pissed on him. Let’s work on that, Doc. Go ahead.”\n\nRachel squeezed my arm. I was being combative, I knew that, but I was annoyed. I was always annoyed. But I hadn’t always *been* annoyed. The thought made me sulk which might’ve been functionally as good as being cowed into a participatory mood. \n\n“Rachel, how did you feel when Eddie did that?”\n\n“Small.”\n\n“Hmm. And Paul, do you think Eddie might have been feeling small as well?”\n\n*No*.  “I don’t know.”\n\nDoctor Foster steepled his fingers and nodded as though doing an impression of a therapist. It was punchably theatrical and for the next ten minutes I all but checked out. He knew Eddie like his teachers did. A pleasant child, talkative and polite and inquisitive. Eddie always commented on differences in the office or in Doctor Foster’s appearance. *I like the pattern on your socks, Doctor Foster. Are those new flowers in the front, Doctor Foster?  They’re very beautiful.*  Doctor Foster probably thought we were crazy. Sometimes, I wondered it myself. \n\n“Until next time, remember your homework: try to be present; work together—all of you—when you’re caring for Cooper. If Eddie feels included he won’t feel unattended. And keep journaling. Sometimes writing your feelings down is enough to assess them objectively. I know it’s helping Eddie, but it’s not just for him.”\n\n—\n\nThere was no rape in war just as there was no murder. Lieutenant Nameis knew that fact, but it did nothing to make the screams less grating. The screams somehow persisted as something to nag at the ears even when the sight of blood became rote. \n\nThe enemy scout had bled plenty as the men had pulled him down onto the pike, but the blood no longer bothered Nameis. The way the man flailed and then squirmed and then twitched didn’t bother him either. Piked or cut down in battle, most men died the same: there was pain, then shock, then stillness. The process was one governed by biology. But the screams were individual. Born by psychology. They lacked the sameness that death did. \n\nThe girl had screamed. So had infantryman Cuddle Bunny after he had deigned to question Nameis’ humanity. If anything, Nameis had more humanity than most. He fought to protect something important. And he did it valiantly. And he was a leopard—decidedly *in*human, and yet bound to human ideals. Glory. Victory. Legacy. \n\nThe screams were human though. Disparate as his enemy.  Born by a psychology *of weakness*. But Nameis was strong—too strong to be so affected by something as ever present as a scream. And if violence could be art, why couldn’t screams be music?  Desperation and fear and agony all weaving together into something melodic. \n\nSergeant Bluey had reported the capture of two enemies that morning. Useless as prisoners, but as instruments…\n\nNameis felt like humming for the first time since the war had begun. He trotted past an orderly row of pikes—his old gallery of sloughing flesh and heavy bones. It wasn’t far to the pillow nook where the prisoners were kept. But pillows were soft, and at this moment, what Nameis desired most was a hard place with pleasant acoustics.\n\n—\n\n“I hear you Paul, but look at him now. Maybe we are crazy. Can two people be crazy about the same thing? Fuck. Maybe we have—I don’t know—a gas leak in the house or something.”\n\nRachel's left leg bounced incessantly, hooked over her right. She bit at her fingernail, oblivious to the chips she was leaving in her nail polish. And Eddie was laughing with another little girl he’d just met. \n\nThe other parents at the playground seemed blissfully aloof or lovingly watchful. Soft hands ready to assist in a tumble. Fast thumbs pecking away at phone screens. I wondered if any of their children were monsters too. \n\n“I don’t think we have a gas leak, Rache. He’s just…clever and manipulative and—I don’t know.”\n\n“He’s not a sociopath… no—he’s not—he’s a kid, right?”\n\n“I don’t know. I don’t think kids can be sociopaths. Or at least they can’t diagnosed as—Hey buddy!—leave your friend’s socks alone, okay?”\n\nEddie was following the girl up the ladder of the jungle gym and pinching the backs of her socks. He stopped when I called to him, smiled, waved. The girl didn’t seem bothered. Why was I? \n\n“What if we’re overly sensitive? Maybe he’s just a dick and he’s fine?”\n\n“Don’t call him a dick in public, Paul. People will say things.”\n\n“Let ‘em.”\n\nRachel sighed. “God I could use a cigarette. And there’s a mom over there. I could ask and she’d bum me one.”\n\nI chuckled. “People will say things…”\n\n“Fuck ‘em. I’m going over. Watch Cooper? Thanks for not judging me!”\n\nShe was fifteen feet away before I could think to respond. Then she was huddled next to the smoking mom, guarding the end of her cigarette with a hand as the mom lit it. The way mothers spoke upon meeting at the playground always looked like flirting to me. A part of me was more envious of that than Rachel’s nicotine fix. Maybe I could flirt with a dad and get a beer…. I chuckled at the notion, pushed Cooper’s stroller back and forth absently as he slept, felt strangely okay. Then I returned my attention to the jungle gym. \n\nThe little girl I saw immediately, in her violently yellow dress. Eddie was wearing something drab. Blue maybe. I couldn’t remember. The girl was meandering near the squat wooden castle that sat between the jungle gym and the swings. She seemed almost grumpy. Perhaps Eddie had left her for a new friend. I searched for him among the taggers and ball kickers. Where was he? Smoking mom had lit another cigarette and was happily chatting with Rachel. The girl was climbing the ladder of the jungle gym again followed by a smiling boy who wasn’t picking at her socks. And Eddie was…where? *Fuck*. I began to stand and—\n\n“Hi dad!”\n\nPaul at home, Dad on the playground. I recognized his voice. Searched for its source. \n\n“Eddie?”\n\n“Over here!”\n\nI squinted at the castle, at the thin mock arrow slit window on my side of it, at the thin sliver of Eddie’s face, one eye watching me and the curl of a smirk. My heart was racing a bit. Foolish. He was just being a child like the rest. \n\n“Ten more minutes Eddie! Okay?”\n\n“Okay, Paul!”  \n\nBack to ‘Paul.’ \n\nHe darted out of the castle and toward the jungle gym. Made for the high ladder to the slide. The little girl stood at the top. *Was she crying*?\n\n“Paul! Come over for a second!”\n\nI turned my attention. Rachel beckoned me as smoking mom now held a phone in her hand and Rachel reached for hers. Maybe Rachel had made a friend too. The woman looked hip, like she might be fun. \n\n“On my way!”\n\nI stood, glanced back over at the jungle gym. A crumple of violent yellow and skinny limbs lay at the bottom of the ladder. Eddie stood at the top, alone. He stared at me for a moment, his face emotionless, more jarring than a smirk. He peered downward. And then stepped off the side into open air. \n\nAbove the sound of his scream, I almost didn’t hear the crack as he landed on the little girl below. \n\n“Oh my god! Eddie!”  Rachel ran. Smoking mom and half dozen other parents followed. Most tried unhelpfully to make sense of it. \n\n“Did anyone see what happened?”  \n\n“No, I was watching my son, Theo.”\n\n“Did they fall?”\n\n“Is she okay?”\n\n“The ladder is too high. I’ve said it a dozen times.”\n\n“But what happened? Does anyone know?”\n\nA crowd of parents shrugged bashfully. Guiltily. None of them had seen what I had. They tended to the children, mine and someone else’s. Eddie wailed. The ambulance that came wailed too, a stand in for the silent little girl in the violent yellow dress. \n\n—\n\nShe said she would tell. Nameis would’nt like that. And Nameis is a god. He is strong. He is a protector. A leeder. \n\n—\n\n“Tell him what happened, Eddie.”\n\n“Paul, I really think we should let him get to it on his own.”\n\n“Respectfully, Doc, I don’t. Tell him.”\n\nEddie’s arm was in a bright blue cast. He dislocated his elbow. The girl had nearly died. She had a punctured lung from two broken ribs but her ruptured spleen had been worse. She’d have scars now. And it was Eddie’s fault so it felt like mine. \n\n“I saw you. I’m done protecting you. Now tell him, Edward. Now.”\n\n“I—I fell. I’m sorry for being clumsy dad. You’re right—I’m a f-fairy. I don’t wanna be, I swear.”\n\nThere are times when indignation feels like rage, *looks* like rage. My face burned and I knew how I must’ve looked. But I had never once called my son a fairy. I never called him clumsy. Doctor Foster looked predictably concerned, all the same. \n\n“Are you fucking kidding me Eddie? Doc, he’s—“\n\n“Sorry dad. I forgot—um—I fell. And my dad wasn’t even there. My dad and mommy love me. And—um—they would never—um…”\n\nIt was a damn good act. His eyes brimming with tears, his posture tense and guarded, his gaze pleading with me for an answer to a concocted question. It was a fucking *masterful* act. A tearful, shaking weapon leveled at me. \n\nDoctor Foster’s concern had morphed into something accusatory. I saw him inching toward Eddie. A subtle defensive movement. I hadn’t done anything. Where the fuck had Eddie gotten all of this? The maliciousness, the manipulation—he was a child working a room full of grown men.\n\nI found myself feeling miserably alone, wanting my wife to defend me against my nine year old son. But *I* hadn’t wanted to gang up on Eddie. I had tried to protect him even as he’d sat in our living room, staring darkly, silently, as I’d screamed about the girl. \n\n“I’d like to speak with your son alone, Paul.”\n\n“This is *fucking ridiculous*.”\n\n“If it is, then I’d like to hear it from Eddie.  He knows the difference between the truth and a lie. Don’t you Eddie?”\n\n“Yes sir.”\n\n“Doctor Foster, I don’t think he does—or—he does, but he doesn’t care. I’m worried that he might be a…sociopath. I know that you can’t—or he’s too young, or—“\n\nHe wasn’t listening. He’d already made up his mind about me. I was angry. An abuser. A man deserving of his contempt. And my truth was a poor substitute for Eddie’s lies. Foster clicked his pen pointedly. \n\n“Paul, I really don’t want to involve the authorities unnecessarily.”\n\n“They’ve already been involved, Doc! I did *nothing* wrong. I’m not abusing my son or whatever it is you think. And I sure as hell didn’t break his arm.”\n\n“Paul, I’m not saying you did. I’d just like to hear Eddie’s story without influence.”\n\n“Oh, this is fucking insane. But sure. Be my guest. Talk. Jesus Fucking Christ.”\n\nI was heaving venom by the time I got into the hall. I couldn’t sit. I wanted to scream, to punch a wall and be the bad man they were probably gossiping about. I checked my phone out of habit. One message from Rachel: *how’s it going?*.  My mind was a non-verbal clot of helpless fury. I didn’t have words for her or anyone else. And…\n\nMy anger and my fear and my frustration were all about my son. My little boy.\n\nAll of a sudden I couldn’t stand. So I slumped to the ground and stared ahead and wept. There was a display of pamphlets for some program on a side table between a clipboard and a potted plant. On the pamphlets was a father carrying his son on his shoulders. They were smiling. Happy. Everything we probably couldn’t be. \n\nI had held Eddie when he was small and felt nothing but thought-vacating awe. He was potential then—everything and nothing more. Now I was supposed to love him. I did love him. But I hated him too. And I hated me more. I had done something—or hadn’t done something—and now he was broken and I didn’t know how to fix him. And when he looked at me with his impenetrable eyes, I saw potential once more, but I didn’t know for what. And I was terrified of that. \n\n—\n\nLeftenant Nameis had a god that he worshiped whilst staring at the mirror in his tent. His god was just. Fearsome. Resolute. And his god was his alone. For now. \n\nHe had offered his god to the first of his two prisoners. It was an act of mercy that had surprised his soldiers, but not half as much as it had surprised Nameis himself. His enemy deserved no enlightenment or beneficence and yet he wondered if there might be more to them than artful meat and blood. Perhaps, he thought, one day they might call him Nameis the Wise. Nameis the Prophet. Nameis the Divine. \n\nDisappointingly, his captive—his *enemy*—had refused his kindness. He had babbled in his insufferable language and prostrated himself in fear for his life. *His* life. Selfish. Nameis was no shepherd of egocentric livestock. He was a leader of artists and holy men, cut throats and kings of the field of war. He would not be diminished by a heathen and his rage had flared so cacophonously that he could not even hear the music of the man’s screams. \n\nThe second captive was more promising. He spoke Nameis’ tongue. He didn’t cower and quail at the sight of his countryman’s blood. He simply knelt and stared. \n\n“Tell me, boy. Do you like music?” Nameis knew the question was an oblique one. But he had no desire for philosophers and second guessers. And the boy did not disappoint. \n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Good. And what gods have you?”\n\n“I have no gods.”\n\nNameis searched the black of the boy’s eyes for a lie, but he found nothing. Endless depth. An honest void. \n\n“Well.” He smiled. “Would you like one?”\n\n—\n\n“Come again?”\n\n“I asked if you’d like one, dad. They’re cookies.”\n\nEddie held out a plate of cookies, awkwardly perched on his cast and steadied by his uninjured hand. There were four of them; store-bought snickerdoodles arranged in a tidy square. Each was topped with a slouching dollop of whipped cream and a few green sprinkles we must’ve gotten for Saint Patrick’s Day. They were almost cute. And a small part of me was frightened to eat them. \n\nHe smiled like he did in public. His smile he saved for others. He’d been like this since the last meeting with Doctor Foster; pleasant at home. Polite. Deferential. Odd. \n\nDoctor Foster had expressed plain misgivings about me, but said that in the end, Eddie had been insistent that I hadn’t hurt him. I had plenty of misgivings about Doctor Foster too. He could be an absolute prick without trying, smug in a quietly academic sort of way. But maybe he’d done something good. Or maybe Eddie had done something bad and he was pretending at contrition. What might be worse than nearly killing a stranger?\n\nI eyed the cookies suspiciously and felt crazy for it. \n\n“Sure buddy. Thanks.”\n\nI managed a smile as I took one. \n\n“You’re welcome, dad.”\n\nCooper was quietly observing a mobile that hung over his play mat on the living room floor, bright eyed and seemingly thoughtful at each rattle or jingle that the dangling clouds and birds and hot air balloons produced. He babbled occasionally, growled like a hatchling dinosaur might, cooed sweetly. \n\nWith all of Eddie’s difficulties, I’d lost time with the son of mine who didn’t make me wince. It wasn’t fair. I resented Eddie for that. But now he was being good and my resentment didn’t seem fair to him. \n\n“Mommy, cookie? I tried to make them as pretty as you.” Saccharine. \n\nRachel took one without my measure of distrust. “Thank you, sweetie. They are pretty.”\n\nHer tone was tired, lilting thinly as she gave him an equally thin smile. \n\n“Is it okay if Nameis has one too, mommy?”\n\n“Whatever you’d like.”\n\nNameis sat on the sofa in the living room, spotty and vaguely cute. Of all Eddie’s toys, he seemed to like Nameis best. He kept track of him as others got misplaced. One would almost think that he loved him. \n\nOnce or twice I had wondered if nine years old was too old for a stuffed animal. I couldn’t remember what I had played with at his age. Action figures maybe. Video games. Eddie made pillow forts on his bed and played with stuffies and spoke in a made up language that he never translated for us. And as I thought about it, I realized that it all seemed normal. Eddie was a child. Maybe my judgment was the problem. \n\nEddie talked to Nameis in his indecipherable patter. He ate Nameis’ cookie for him, spilled crumbs on the sofa. There was a time when I would have chastised him for that. But now, I was a hostage of a good mood and a remarkably peaceful home, so I said nothing. \n\nSitting at the dining table in the next room, Rachel wrote feverishly in her latest journal. Doctor Foster gave them out like prescription medication. Pocket-sized blue books with ruled pages and a little red string bookmark attached to the spine. Rachel had filled three since we’d started therapy. Eddie hid his journal and shared it only with Doctor Foster in their one-on-one segments of our group sessions. I hadn’t had the heart to write much of what I felt.\n\nAfter our cookies we went to bed. Eddie didn’t fight us. He didn’t shout and claw and wake up his brother. He told Rachel and me that he loved us and I watched those foreign words level the armature of Rachel’s dismay. She hadn’t cried all day. And before waking around midnight, I think I had been having a pleasant dream. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI woke in ordinary darkness beside my wife and the familiar rectangle of Cooper’s bassinet that stood on her side of the bed. Her steady breath and Cooper’s said that both were sleeping soundly. The streetlight outside our window cast a dim shape across our bed, fractured by the shadow of a bare-limbed maple tree. I felt warm between our flannel sheets, comfortable beneath the plush weight of our duvet. And yet I shivered all the same. \n\nI had never dealt with proper anxiety. I took no regular medication. I didn’t spiral like Rachel sometimes did. But I wondered if my mind wasn’t succumbing to the frailty I felt in my nerves. Unhelpful. \n\nI closed my eyes again, tried to drift, rolled onto my back, my side, my back again. Sleep wouldn’t come so I went to my Kindle and tried to read myself into fatigue. \n\nAn hour passed before the dull backlight and tiny print began to burn my eyes. I was re-reading paragraphs unintentionally. Tired but not sleepy. I lay the ebook on my chest and stared into the dark.  I thought about journaling. I’d have to do it downstairs but maybe it would do something about the prickling in my skin. I’d need a hoodie, slippers. The armoire toward the foot of the bed seemed painfully far away. Maybe I could write in the dark. My eyes were adjusting away from the light of my screen. It’s not like my handwriting needed to look—\n\nMy mind paused. I squinted. At the space beside the armoire. At a shape that didn’t belong. At—\n\n“Eddie?”\n\nI whispered. Quiet. Not as quiet as Eddie who stood completely still, staring at me from the corner in the dark. Our bedroom door had been closed since I woke. He hadn’t moved an inch. And I shivered once again. \n\n“Eddie—why are you—“\n\nI lifted my Kindle and cast him in its anemic light. He cradled Nameis in the bend of his cast. His other arm dangled at his side and as I learned forward, something glinted in his hand. \n\n“W-what are you holding buddy?”\n\nHe took a step towards me. Silently. \n\n“Buddy?”\n\n“I found it on the floor where mommy wasn’t eating her cookie.” He whispered. Took another step. \n\n“What is it, Eddie?”\n\n“A piece of mommy’s wine glass, Paul.  The one that broke.”\n\n“Eddie…”\n\n“I wanted to give it to you.” Step. “So that no one gets hurt.”  \n\n“Okay Eddie. Good. But you don’t wanna get hurt either, right?” Step. “So just put it—“\n\nHe set the shard of glass on the foot of the bed and took another two steps along my side of it. I tried to exhale normally but my breath shuddered out in spite of my effort. \n\n“Did you know you can make music with glass, daddy?”\n\n“What?” \n\n“If you move a wet finger around the top?”\n\n“Eddie, I don’t—“\n\n“Do you like music, daddy?”\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\nEddie smiled and clutched Nameis to his chest. \n\n“You and mommy sleep so soundly, daddy. You’re all so tired. I wish I could sleep as well as you.”  His gaze turned to Rachel and he sighed. “Goodnight, daddy. Sweet dreams.”\n\nHe left without another word and I didn’t sleep a wink. \n\n—\n\nHe never tired of hearing the music of pain. Lieutenant Nameis had taken to closing his eyes to better appreciate the nuance; the shallow breaths like woodwinds playing pianissimo, the clack of teeth—subtle percussion, the symphonic crescendo of a guttural scream, rising from the lungs like the irrepressible aria of a well-tuned violin. \n\nThe boy—his first disciple—was a prodigy. \n\n“Bravo, boy!”  Nameis didn’t mind being effusive when it was well-warranted. The boy was humble enough that cautious praise was unnecessary. He knew his place. Nameis knew his potential. But the war would not turn on potential alone. \n\nNameis’ war was now a holy one, ordained by a god who hungered for aesthetic perfection. And if the boy’s raw talent demonstrated their god’s blessing, then Nameis would make an idol of the boy. A zealot. A crusader.\n\n It was not something his other soldiers truly understood. Those with the stomach for art worked like craftsmen. They were useful, certainly, but they lacked creativity. \n\nThe boy made transcendence—synesthesia woven from the medium of suffering. A nocturne in the vagrant hues of coagulation. Impressionist whimsy in the cartilaginous pop of a hyperextended knee. Nameis might have been envious, were he not so proud. \n\nIf only he could simply feel that pride without the bore of tactics and strategy. But the enemy vexed him as ever. Devils, all—in the space beyond the pillows and blankets that were his home. His consecrated ground. His holy land. \n\n—\n\nPilgrim’s Medical Center had treated both Eddie and the girl in the yellow dress. *Tansy*. They had traveled in separate ambulances. Tansy was unconscious, her lips had been slightly blue, so she went first. Eddie had wailed and moaned. I’m sure it had hurt like hell, but as we traveled with him, all I could think of was the look on his face before he dropped. \n\nNow, Eddie was in a cast he found irksome, but he was fine. His arm would heal. Rachel and I knew that, though we avoided talking about any of that day on the playground as we sat in the hall outside Doctor Foster’s office. Rachel wanted to believe that her son would make her cry but wouldn’t make a child bleed. She’d kept in touch with Tansy’s parents, sent them flowers, lied to herself. And I stayed silent. \n\nRachel sighed as I stared once more at Doctor Foster’s pamphlet and its portrait of forced familial bliss. \n\n“What do you think they talk about?”\n\nI clicked my tongue. “Us.”\n\n“Did we fail? Like—are we bad parents?”\n\n“No. We raised an angel who makes cookies and screams.”\n\n“Paul. I’m serious.”\n\n“I don’t know. Bad parents? Maybe. I’m sure Headmaster Foster will let us know.”\n\nRachel giggled. \n\n“Ravenclaw *cannot* lose anymore points. So if I have to, I’m throwing you under the bus...for my House.”\n\n“And what am I, then? Slytherin?”\n\n“Hufflepuff, clearly.”\n\n“Hufflepuff? You mean bitch.”\n\n“Classic Huff. *Badgering* people.”\n\nI laughed at ‘Huff’ and missed the pun. She just laughed. And for a moment we were younger. A couple with a baby sleeping in his stroller, happy. \n\n“Huff? If you’re making slick nicknames for Hufflepuff you’re clearly one of them.”\n\n“No. Headmaster Foster gave me a personality test last—hang on. Text.”\n\nShe pulled out her phone. I kept up the bit. \n\n“Evasive. Clever. Maybe you are a—wait. What’s wrong?”\n\nHer brow furrowed. Tears crowded her eyes a moment later. \n\n“Rachel—what?”\n\n“There was a complication last night. A—a clot. Tansy, the little girl from the playground, she—“\n\n“…Fuck.”\n\nRachel wept and I stared ahead and a few minutes later the session concluded.  Eddie emerged, holding Nameis in his arms, smiling like an angel with [blood upon its wings](https://www.reddit.com/r/decogent/comments/v85m4g/you_found_me/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)",

        "text": "  \n\nOn the outskirts of town by the old obsolete highway is an old crappy restaurant. It is open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, sometimes longer or shorter. \n\nIf you were to go inside you would see old worn-down tables, chairs, menu boards, a stained floor in the lobby, and paint chipped walls. \n\nWe also have a drive-thru and if you were to go through the drive-thru you would see chipped and cracked pavement, grease stains, old menu boards, and old signs. Most of the customers come through the drive-thru, but the brave ones still go into the lobby. After eleven the drive-thru is closed and people can only come into the lobby. We do this because after eleven there is at most two people. We also must let the drive-thru system reset every night. People in town have heard the stories of this place for example how we have shadow people\n\nWell to be fair there is one and we call him bob. Bob is known to stand at the edges of your vision and watches you. Some people even claim that he takes their food when they are not looking. Bob is harmless though he just enjoys watching. \n\nIf you were to go through the drive-thru you might hear a mysterious voice over the speaker. The voice is described as a very deep gruff male voice. This voice is known to ask customer what their favorite color is and even pretends to take their order. The worst part is that he will ask customers if they want items that we do not have hotdogs and chili. So that’s always fun trying to explain to a customer that we do not have those items even though a voice over the speaker asked them if they wanted it. The voice just enjoys pulling pranks on us and messing with us.\n\nI have worked at this restaurant full time ever since high school so about five years and many oddities occur here.\n\nHi, my name is Gunner, and I am the night shift manager. I oversee the night shift, but half of the time I am by myself. I take orders, make the food, unload truck delivers, make sure the place does not burn down, do maintenance on the fryers, and the store. I decided to start writing a journal about all the strange stuff that occurs here. I think I should mention that I have serve sleep insomnia. Which means on most nights I get 3 hours of sleep and some nights I do not sleep at all so the nights kind of blur together. Hopefully with this journal I can keep track of the strange things that happen. I usually bring my laptop at work so I can surf the web when I am not busy so that works out with me making journal entries. \n\nMost nights I do have at least one person with me until 1am. Most of the time it is Jason or Alex. We do have the occasional part timer that works a night shift but most of the time it is these two. Jason and Alex are both cooks that work in the kitchen. Jason is a chain smoker and tends to indulge in drugs, but he is a cool guy most nights. He tends to have a I do not care attitude, but it is the night shift so that is the motto around here. \n\nAlex is a quiet guy who tends to keep to himself. He does seem to talk about anime frequently. \n\nThey both are cooks and tend to stay in the kitchen, but sometimes they help me with cleaning the lobby and handing out food to customers. I work with those two all the time and have become friends with them. They have also seen many of the strange things that happen here.\n\nBefore you ask why I chose to work night it is because, it is more peaceful and quieter and this time at night. You can do whatever you want most of the time. I read books, go on my phone, or watch YouTube videos. The owners know this, and they have yet to say anything to me. It might be because I have been the night shift manager for three years that is longer than anyone else. The past night shift managers or workers do not last awfully long. The average year of employment for night workers is a year. I heard the last night manager still will not leave his house. \n\nThe night shift is not for anyone. It can be crazy, dangerous, strange, or most of the time incredibly boring. The long hours from nine pm to five am feels almost like an eternity somedays, but I am what you call an expert on the night shift. I have seen it all, but the most important thing is to not care or just think not my problem. You hear cries for help in the forest two in the morning not my problem. Bloody clothes in the parking lot well time to throw them in the trash and forget about them. Ice that appears out of nowhere. I do not see cleaning that up in my job description. \n\nBefore I post any entries from my journal, I will tell you a story I think deserving to be my first story. I call it the **midnight truck driver**.\n\nSo, this story happened one year ago. It was a dark and stormy night when I got to work for my night shift. When I got there the afternoon manager Ruby told me that truck never showed up and never called. It was Wednesday night, and we needed the truck supplies for the weekend. I just figured that the truck was going to come tomorrow and thought nothing more about it. We were running low on supplies, but we should be fine for a day or two before we start to run out of supplies. \n\nAt 9pm I took over and all the afternoon workers went home. It was a slow night. I got some work done I emptied the grease traps, cleaned the parking lot, and cleaned the ice machine.\n\nIt was around eleven thirty when I got a call on the store phone. I answered the phone. “Hello, this is Gunner how can I help you?” A gruff, old voice responded saying “I’ll be there in thirty minutes.” “Is this the truck driver calling?” I asked. “Yes” said the voice over the phone. “Why are you coming at midnight?” as soon as I asked the question, he hung up the phone. I did not mind him coming so late, because of how slow it was. I had fifteen customers since I got here. I was confused on why he was coming so late. I do know that the truck drivers work twelve-hour shifts and sometimes they are late by a couple of hours, but I have never heard of a truck coming eight hours late. At this point I was by myself. Jason went home early since how slow it was. I was going to keep him here to unload the truck with me, but he kept asking me to go home so I let him.\n\nAfter getting my work done, I sat on a chair by front counter, watching YouTube videos on my phone. I kept seeing bob on the edges of my vision, so I went into the kitchen and made him a cheeseburger. I put the sandwich on a booth table in lobby then went back to watching my YouTube video. I learned that if you give bob something to eat, he will leave you alone. I think he is simply curious and watches from affair, but he was annoying me. I looked at the booth where the plate was and now it was empty, but what I saw surprised me. There was a semi outside in the parking lot seemed to be the one truck drivers drove. I never herd it pull into the parking lot or seen it but then I walked outside to start unloading it.\n\nWhen I walked out the first thing, I noticed was how old, beat up, and rusty the semi looks. It looked to be ancient probably around thirty years old and never had a car wash. I just figured that it was a spare old semi that they had laying around. I walked to the stock area and opened the door so the driver can bring the supplies in. He was already unloading the boxes, but the strange thing was that there was an ominous red light coming from inside the truck. Also, the boxes had blood and mold on them. The thing that really creeped me out was that one of boxes had a label on it that said fish nuggets. Like what who in their right mind would eat fish nuggets! \n\nThere was a foul smell coming from the truck. The truck driver appeared walked out of the loading area of the truck and looked at me. He wore a large trench coat and blue jeans. They looked worn out like he had owned them for ten years and never washed them. His face was hidden behind his hood. He then proceeded to ask me to come inside the truck and help him lift a box since it was too heavy for him. I stood there for a minute and realized all the red flags, then I heard a scream coming from the truck. I yelled no thanks and then ran inside and locked the door. \n\nI hid in the freezer for around ten minutes and only came out after I started showing early signs of frostbite. I looked outside and the truck was gone, and they were no traces of the truck ever being there. I looked on the cameras and the cameras facing the parking lot just stopped recording for thirty minutes and never got the truck on film. \n\nAfter that night, the midnight truck driver has called at least ten times at midnight. I have learned to ignore the truck and it will leave. It only comes when I am alone. I just added it to the list I started about the oddities at the Restaurant. \n\nOddities at the restaurant: The New Moon Paper\n\nAt least once a month I find a newspaper by the front door. It appears at midnight and has a strange story in it. It is weird but interesting. I have no idea who keeps delivering the paper. I thought they were just random stories until a New Moon paper had a story in it that came true. The story was about a man named Kevin Addams that worked at a factory and lived a normal life. He found out his wife was cheating on him, and he went through a terrible breakup. She always made the food, and he did not know how to cook besides heating up frozen foods. He went out to eat every day. One day he went to the shitty restaurant to get lunch. He was in the lobby and died of a heart attack. I thought it was a messed-up story, but nothing more. That changed when a man named Kevin Addams died of a heart attack in the lobby during lunch. He worked at a factory and was going through a terrible breakup. Ever since then I started to wonder if all the stories were true. \n\nNot everything in the paper came true but about half of them did. The New Moon paper only ever got delivered once a month during the new moon phase of the moon. Also, on the paper it called itself the new moon chronicles. \n\nOddities at the restaurant: The Thing in The Forest\n\nRight next to the restaurant is a forest. In the forest there are creatures you would expect in a forest in the Midwest bears, cougars, deer, etc. There is also something else in there and we are not sure what it is. We have found claw marks on the trees and footprints by the restaurant that are too big to be bears. At night you could see a large creature with glowing red eyes on the edge of the forest. It seems blacker than the night sky. All it does is watches. I have been the only one to see it and it seems to happen when I am alone. \n\nOddities at the restaurant: The basement\n\nIn the back of the restaurant there is a door that is always locked. Only a few people have the key to open the door. The door leads to the basement. In the basement there is the water heater, a boiler, and the oil tanks that hold used cooking oil. The basement is always freezing down there. \n\nAfter the incident we are not allowed to talk about happened the door got locked and only a few people have access to it. I am one of the few who has a key since I do have to go down there sometimes to do maintenance on the equipment and make sure everything is working fine. \n\nThere are even some old arcade machines for example Pac-man and Donkey Kong down here. One of the arcade machines that’s down here is called Super Donkey Kong. It seems to be a one-of-a-kind machine, and I can’t find anything about it online. I have been restoring them in my spare time and I got Pac-man up and running. There also is an old creature from the black lagoon neon sign down there that still works. There is also a popcorn machine down there. I have no idea why those arcade machines are down in the basement. Looks to be about thirty years old.\n\nThere is also an old bar down there next to the arcade machines. There are some bottles, but they must be moonshine because some of these bottles have labels on them that I have never seen before for example moon’s tears, blackout, snake’s venom, and vodka beer just to name a few. I have never tried any yet.\n\nThe one very strange thing about the basement is the giant hole in the middle of the ground. No one knows why that hole is down there. Maybe it is an old well or a sinkhole. Sometimes you hear voices coming from it. It’s about twenty feet wide and seems to bottomless. I shined a flashlight down the hole, and I never seen the bottom. I tried throwing a rock down it and I never heard it hit the bottom. I waited twenty minutes for it to hit the bottom. I left and came back and the same rock I threw was sitting by the hole like it was spit out.\n\nSometimes you can hear voices talking and it seems to be coming from the hole. It only happens when I am alone. My mind is not very stable these days, so I am never quite sure if what I am hearing is real. The voices say join us, be with us, it sleeps here, and the scariest of them all your fly is down. When I hear this, I look down and my fly indeed is down, so I zip it back up and continue on my way. Like the other mysterious voices, I tend to tune them out.\n\nThe basement is completely sealed and the only way in is the locked basement door. A couple of weeks ago I went downstairs, and I found a note that said hello Gunner XOXO-Lilith. I then seen a bat chilling by the hole. It seemed to be the Hoary bat. Those bats have long pointed wings with mixed grayish and brownish fur with white tipped furs. I know this because the bat colony that lives by the restaurant is the Hoary and I read a lot of animal books when it is slow at work. The only way I can figure how the bat got in here was from the hole and I had no idea what that letter was about and who Lilith is. So, I just went back upstairs and locked the door. Ever since then I have been finding letters in basement talking to me and its always signed by Lilith. Most of letters just say hello and how are you today. One letter Lilith had written on their that I was cute. I gave the hole a nickname. The bottomless pit.\n\nOddities at the Restaurant: Monsters in the mist\n\nDuring the summertime at least once every four years sometimes more the mist comes. The mist comes after a very heavy rainstorm, and it is so thick you can’t see more than five feet ahead of you. So, we are basically trapped in the Restaurant until the mist lifts. No customers come so we usually just sit around until the mist is gone. While the mist is present, we lock the doors and stay in the back, so nothing sees us.\n\nI am not sure what is in the mist, but there is some sort of creatures in it. They growl and sound very unnatural. You can hear them walking outside and sometimes they bang on the doors and windows. They also are known to wreck cars parked outside. When this happens, I do what I always do. Ignore them. I sit in the back room and watch tv with headphones in. The creatures have tipped over cars before, so they do have the strength to break down the door, but they never have. Also, for some reason they leave my car alone every time.\n\nAfter the mist is gone there are damages all over town and even a few missing people are reported each time. The locals know how dangerous this is so when the mist comes, they stay inside and stay put. It’s the outsiders that don’t believe the warning and go out into the mist and never come back.\n\nThat’s most of oddities I can think of so far. I have started to make daily journal entries and maybe in the future will post them on the internet.\n\nDaily entry June 11th\n\nI came to work at 9pm and took over the store, it was night and when I walked around the lobby to pick up the garbage left by the customers, I found a pair of shoes just left there with a little bit of blood on it. I added it to the bin of other shoes or pieces of clothes I found in the parking lot.\n\nAt 11:03 pm \n\nthe bear guy came into the store and ordered four hamburgers and fresh coffee. I call him the bear guy because he wears a pelt of a bear on his back. He is nice enough, but a little weird. He always asks me what my favorite bear is. He says the brown bear is the best.\n\nAt 11:57 pm\n\nJason complained of seeing blood dripping from the walls. I helped him clean it up. It does that sometimes.\n\nAt 2:19 am\n\nI saw a man standing in the parking lot staring at me. He had a big fedora on his head and all I could see was that he was smoking a cigar. I closed the blinds and hoped he would leave. I have seen him a couple of times, but I never see him come or leave only standing there.\n\nAt 3:00 am \n\nI heard talking coming from the freezer. It sounded to be someone was talking, but very muffled. I went into the freezer, and no one was there. That has been happening a lot more often.\n\nAt 4:40am \n\nAlex came into the lobby to get something to eat. He just got two cheeseburgers with no pickles. I asked what he was up to. He said he was at a graveyard party. Whatever the hell that is. \n\nDaily entry June 12th\n\nWhen I pulled into the parking lot before my shift started, I saw a cloud of bats fly by. Great the bats are back. I am going to call the exterminator again. there is a colony of bats that live in a cave by the restaurant. They tend to swarm around the store at night. \n\nAt 10:00 pm\n\nI went in the basement to grab a tool for cleaning fryers that I left down there, and I see a letter in a black envelope. I opened said letter and it was a note from Lilith. She said I was looking for good today and we should talk soon. I just grabbed my tool and the letter and went back upstairs. Not sure who Lilith is and so far, I have been ignoring the letters. I think maybe soon I should try talking to her in the basement to see if I get a response. \n\nMidnight \n\nIt has been busier than usual. I barely had time to sit around and do nothing. If we had more night people it would be better, but we are always understaffed. \n\nAt 1:50 Am\n\nI heard scratching coming from the walls again. We just turned the store radio on to drown it out.\n\nAt 2:30 Am\n\nThe man with the fedora is standing outside smoking a cigarette again. I checked the cameras, and he is standing in a blind spot. I watched him for five mins before I went back to work.\n\nAt 4:01 Am\n\nThe Goth kids came into the Restaurant and got something to eat. They asked me if we had any gluten free buns and of course we do not. They have asked five times if we sell blood. This night I just looked at them and said not yet with a serious look on my face. \n\nThose kids have to be seventeen or eighteen. I asked what they are doing out so late and aren’t there parents worried about them. They said they were out partying, and they don’t care what their parents think. They then sit in the lobby smoking E-cigarettes and using there iPhone 13’s. Was I that angsty and cringy when I was that young?\n\nDaily Entry June 13th\n\nNothing strange happened today. Sometimes that happens.\n\nDaily Entry June 14th\n\nWhile driving to work I realized I only slept 5 hours in the past 3 days. It seems to me that my insomnia is getting worse. The journal is helping me keep my memories in order.\n\nAt 9:00 pm\n\nRuby told me when I got to work that the second fryer is not working. So, I tried to see what was wrong with it. I found a red substance on the pump. I could not remember if that were there already, so I decided to leave it and try to fix it later.\n\nAt 12:12 Am\n\nAt the restaurant during the night shift there is a lot of oddities, but one of the strangest is the live ice. It is ice that appears out of nowhere on the most random spots. I have found ice in the lobby in tables and chairs, on the roof, and even on the grill. Jason just found a lot of live ice behind one of the grills.\n\nAt 1:00 am\n\nAlex just asked me if I knew how to get out of a mental asylum. I said “no” then he said “just act normal” he started to laugh creepily and grin. \n\nJason told me he has been acting strange lately. He found him in the freezer starting at the wall and whispering to himself. I think it has something to do with the graveyard parties.\n\nAt 1:30am\n\nRick came into the store. He is a customer that usually orders a sweet tea and a crispy chicken sandwich. He was talking to me about the werewolf he sees in the woods around his house. He is known for his strange stories. He lives alone in an old farmhouse by the woods.\n\nAt 3:00am\n\nOddities at the restaurant: the freezer\n\nThe freezer in the restaurant is very strange. Live ice appears all over the store only at night though. We think it is coming from the freezer somehow. We also hear a lot of weird sounds coming from it. Sometimes it sounds like someone is talking inside, but when I go inside there is no one. Boxes just randomly disappear and appear inside the freezer. I once found a box of pizza in the freezer. We do not sell pizza. I did do a taste test and it taste amazing. Also, when I go into the freezer, I get a strange feeling like someone watching me. I just ignore it and get back to work. \n\nI felt I should write this down because I just walked into the freezer and there is ice that is in the shape of a hand. Just froze on the wall. That is strange.\n\nAt 3:30 am\n\nI just went into the basement, and I see live ice on the celling that’s below the freezer. There’s no way that should be happening. Then there is ice around the bottomless pit. The ice stops five feet away from the hole and forms a perfect circle. There is a black envelope right next to the edge of the pit. I open it and all it says. Do you see the Ice to? He is getting restless. from Lilith.\n\nAt 4:40am\n\nI went outside to the dumpsters to throw away some garbage. I heard someone calling for help from the woods. I just walked back inside. I would have gone to see what was happening, but for the last couple of months I have heard the same voice calling for help in the same spot. It only happens when I am alone.\n\nDaily Entry June 15th\n\nI finally have a day off!\n\nDaily Entry June 16th\n\n11:00 am I was alone with Alex tonight. He has been acting weird. He said that he barley slept because of the graveyard parties. I finally asked what a graveyard party was, and he stopped walking turned to me very slowly. He cracked a smile a said in a creepy voice he will show me sometime. He then proceeded to walk into the freezer and was in there for ten minutes.\n\n1:32 am \n\nI walked into the freezer, and I see a door covered in ice. How long has that been there and I have never noticed it? Or did I notice it and just forgot about it?\n\n3:33am \n\nAlex just asked me if I heard it. I asked what the hell he was talking about, and he just said “I’ll hear him soon” then he walked away.\n\n3:55 am\n\nI just went outside to throw some garbage in the dumpsters and seen a herd of jackalopes! There are rabbits with antlers. It seems to be a herd of them live in the forest by the restaurant.\n\n4:15 am\n\nI went on the roof to clean the grease trap and I slipped on some live ice on the roof and almost feel to my death. I see some bats chilling on the roof. Thank God no health inspector even seen them on the roof. I looked over to the woods and seen the Creature in The Forest starting at me. I just went back downstairs.\n\nTonight, I was cleaning the lobby. It was a slow night and Jason was cleaning the grills trying to leave early like usual when Gus came into the store. He orders some fries and a fish sandwich. He sat by me while I worked and was talking to me. Gus was an old man that was genuinely nice but seemed to be lonely, so I never minded talking to him. Gus used to do a lot of hunting in the area and even worked in this very same restaurant many years ago when it first opened. He would tell me about his hunting stories and even about the old days at the restaurant. Back then the store was a lot nicer and more popular. \n\n“Have I ever told you about the incident that happened here?” Asked Gus. “No, I said” “what happened?” “Well, many years ago when I worked at the restaurant, we had a manager name Matthew. Everyone called him Matt though. Matt was an overnight manager and worked for many years. Slowly he started to go crazy. He would say weird things and stand in the freezer. One day I came to start my morning shift at five am and he was nowhere to be seen. I looked all over, but after ten minutes of looking I finally found him in the freezer. He was all purple and laying on the floor. I called an ambulance, but they pronounced him dead at the scene. He died of hypothermia. Looking back at the cameras he went in there at three am and never came out again. No one knew what happened and the autopsy found no evidence of foul play. It was labeled as an accident and nothing more. I always wondered why he was so obsessed with the freezer.”\n\n“What do you think happened to him Gus?” “You worked with him for many years so you must have some idea.” \n\n“This was kept a secret, but I found a note he left. I cannot remember exactly what it said, but it went like him saying He keeps telling me to join him. The scratching is getting very loud. I see him in my dreams it feels very cold. He said he can save me, but I must join him. I think I will.”\n\n“Why was that kept a secret?” \n\nWell said Gus “The restaurant was only opened for five years by that point and the owners felt that would ruin its reputation, so they swept it under the rug.”\n\n“Well eventually everyone in this town knows the stories, but I never herd that one. Why are you telling me this now?” \n\n“Because I like you” said Gus “You should know stuff like that about this place” “You remind me of me back in the day” “I say this next part out of kindness, but you seem too good of a kid to be stuck working at a dead-end job. Why don’t you leave and find a better job and get out of town?”\n\n“I don’t mind working here and I am kind of stuck after my dad passes away, he left me his house and I don’t want to abandon it. It’s where I grew up.”\n\nBefore Gus could say anything, else Jason walked up to us and spoke. \n\n“That is a neat story, but I need your help. There is blood coming from the walls again.”\n\nSo, I wished Gus a goodnight and went to go and perform my night shift manager duties and clean up blood from a wall.\n\nI could not help, but to think about the story Gus told me. It sounded eerily similar to Alex. I have known him for years. I did not want him to end up as Matt. Next time I work with him I was going to have a chat with him.\n\nAfter we cleaned up the blood dripping from the walls Jason left. It was one thirty and he said he had stuff to do and was not going to take no for an answer, so I let him leave. After that I was sitting in lobby reading a book. Then I blacked out and when I came to, I found myself standing in the freezer. That has been having for the past couple of weeks. Only when I am by myself.\n\nThe next day I was working with Alex. I had planned on talking to him about what was going on with him, but I did not have the nerve to start a conversation with him just yet. I was going to wait until we were alone.\n\n1:00 am \n\nAlex just told me something very strange also, Simon just came into the store and got something to drink. I think he’s an albino. He has very pale skin, blood red eyes, and snow-white hair. He told me he hates the summer and the heat. He loves to be cold. He then walked out of the store. I could not help to notice when he comes by live ice forms on the floor where he walks.\n\n2:05 am\n\nso tonight, Alex told me he had joined a “club” it was not actually a club but more of a cult, but when I asked if it was a cult, he was very adamant that it was not. They called themselves the guardians of the dead or simply Guardians. He said they aim to understand and protect the undead and cryptids. They were supposed to have extremely limited human contact and live in the forest away from the cities. He said they have graveyard party’s so they can talk to the deceased and try to learn from them. He said ever since he joined the, he feels complete and exited for the next day. \n\nI asked him how he even joined the Guardians. He said he was on a walk late at night and bumped into some members by a graveyard. Why he was walking by a graveyard in the middle of the night is beyond me. They convinced him to come to a graveyard party and they managed to convince him to join. He said it was one of the happiest days of his life. \n\nI asked him why he was still working here if he is not supposed to have contact with humans. He just said “You’ll find out soon enough” after that he went back to work and acted like nothing ever happened. \n\nThe night continued how it usually did. Slow and not a whole lot to do. Alex was beginning to unnerve me. I just took my mind off things by talking to the customer and getting some cleaning done. \n\nI pulled the fridges out to clean behind them, and I see a block of cheese with legs run away. I wiped my eyes, and it was gone. Maybe I’m seeing things since I’m not getting a lot of sleep. I did only get six hours in three days. Ever since I have been getting those dreams my sleep schedule is even worse than before. After I got done cleaning behind the fridges Stan came into the lobby. Stan is a county deputy and is the one who comes and checks up on us. I have his personal number and had to call him a couple times before. I once had to call him to help me catch a deer that ran into the store.\n\nStan got a cup of coffee to drink and a fish sandwich to eat. He sat down in lobby and was reading a newspaper. He asked if the New Moon paper kept showing up. I said it was, but not very often. I told Stan about it, and he said it was best to keep it to ourselves. \n\nI asked Stan what he was up to tonight. They have been getting reports of a cult having meetings in the graveyard and desecrating graves. He was on a stakeout tonight, but they never showed up, so he decided to come grab something eat and check up on me. Stan usually was the deputy who came here whenever we need the police. I like Stan he tends to mind his business and was a good listener when I needed advice. He is one of the few people I consider a friend.\n\nI knew he was talking about Alex and his Cult, but I did not want to tell Stan yet. I am going to try to talk to Alex before I tell Stan. Alex is a good guy, but it seems he might have fell into with a bad group of people.\n\nStan finished his meal and said goodbye before leaving. He said he will probably stop by again tomorrow again. As soon as I left Alex was giving me the evil eye. I asked if something was wrong, and he just walked away. He looked pissed, but whatever I only got an hour left anyway. \n\nI went home after work and watched some tv before heading to bed. I actually slept around five hours. When I was sleeping, I had a very peculiar dream. I was at the restaurant, and everything was covered in ice. The floors, walls, tables, and even the grills somehow. I walked around the store and seen that the freezer was open. There was a bright light in it. A deep male voice told me to come in and join him. That he can save me and all I need to do is trust in him. He will show me the path to salvation. All I needed to do was join him and his warm embrace. I said no thanks I am fine over here. The building started to shake and not before long the whole restaurant collapsed in on itself. I shot up in bed sweating. I thought well either I am going crazy or its actually real. \n\nI decided to drink a monster instead of going to bed and write this up and post it. It’s my first post ever since I started keeping a journal, so I hope you guys find this interesting. Let me know what you think so far. Is this real or am I going crazy? I’ll be sure to post again real soon.",

        "text": "  \n\nEvery rural corner of America has its share of urban legends. Abandoned churches, haunted graveyards, decrepit old houses and barns, you name it. Places that exist at the edge of our modern, hyper-rational society.  Places where the impossible becomes possible: where footsteps are heard even though there’s nothing there, or where voices are heard when you are sure no one’s around.  \n\nMost people think these are nothing more than stories; old yarns passed down through the ages to entertain children, or to scare off outsiders, or even just to sell t-shirts. For most people, they’re all just fun little tales that capture the imagination in an otherwise boring, logical existence.  Hell, I myself was one of those people for most of my life. That is, until I found the Devil’s Clearing. Until I dragged my friends along into the worst mistake I’ve ever made.\n\nIt was eight years ago when I was a sophomore at a small university in eastern North Carolina. Never a huge people person, I had my close knit group of friends I had met during my freshman year and to whom I stuck like glue. First, there was my dormmate, Anthony. It didn’t take long to discover he shared my deep-seated love of horror movies, Halloween, and all things spooky, which is something we bonded over during my freshman year. A couple of weeks after freshman orientation, he met Alexa and it was love at first sight. Naturally, she quickly became a member of our little crew. Finally, there was Richard. An unlikely addition to the bunch, Richard had lived a sheltered life with staunch Baptist parents and was more than a little socially awkward, but he was a great time on the occasions when we could bring him out of his shell.\n\nOnce our sophomore year rolled around, I got an apartment off campus with Anthony and Alexa. Richard’s parents would never approve of him living in off-campus housing, but that didn’t change the fact that he was over at our place more often than his own. In fact, he was over at our apartment the night that I first brought up the Clearing. \n\nThe Devil’s Clearing is a legend of the Carolinas; it’s a barren spot in an otherwise dense forest, a perfect circle about sixty feet wide, where nothing grows. Old timers from the area where it is located (and I will NOT say more on where specifically it’s located. You can do that homework on your own, at your peril) claim that the reason for the lack of growth is that it’s the very spot where the Devil comes upon the Earth and paces back and forth, plotting evil against mankind. \n\nDifferent stories have been told about the Clearing through the years. People say that anything left inside it overnight will mysteriously end up outside the circle by dawn. Others have claimed that if you sit just outside it and stay awake through the night, eventually you will see piercing, disembodied red eyes staring at you from within. Once, someone from the local paper tested the theory and stayed in a tent inside the Clearing overnight and saw neither of these things. However, he claimed afterward that he heard someone walking in circles around his tent but upon investigation there was no one there.\n\nThe scientific explanation put forth for the barren patch is that it’s a natural salt lick which prohibits vegetation from growing in that exact spot. But to a young, restless, supernatural enthusiast like I was, that explanation was no fun. I wanted to see it for myself. \n\nDon’t get me wrong; like I said before, I was the type of person to believe these were just stories. I assumed the scientific explanation was correct, but I enjoyed suspending my disbelief and imagining that there really *was* something out there that transcended rational understanding. So that October, the Tuesday before Halloween weekend, I suggested a trip.\n\n“On Halloween weekend? Fuck that,” Anthony immediately replied, strolling across the living room and plopping down on the couch next to Alexa. “Me and Alexa already have our costumes ready to go and there’s at least five parties we plan to be at. We have literally every other weekend to go fucking camping.”\n\nAlexa turned to him with an impish smirk on her face. “Oh is that it? I think someone’s just scared that a demon might molest him in his sleep.”\n\n“That would be about the only thing that might touch me there,” Anthony replied, resulting in a quick jab to the ribs from his dearly beloved.\n\n\"I’ll pass,” Richard replied from the chair in the far corner. “Watching movies and going to haunted houses and stuff is fun and all, but I’d rather not go somewhere that actually IS haunted. I know y’all don’t take this stuff as seriously as I do, but the Devil is real and I’d rather not tempt him.”\n\nAnthony shot him a nod and a look of approval. “See? The good Reverend Dick is on my side.” \n\n“I told you not to call me that.” \n\n“Beside the point right now, Dickie.”\n\nI share this conversation to point out that it wasn’t something we had to do; at least two of my friends didn’t even want to go. But I wanted to check it out and I wasn’t going to take no for an answer.\n\n“Guys, there are parties here every weekend,” I pleaded. “We always do the same old shit. Why not take advantage of the creepiest weekend of the year to do something that might actually be scary?”\n\nI looked at Anthony. “Besides, we know all the really fun stuff is going to happen on Saturday. We can go out after class on Friday, spend the night, and be back here by Saturday afternoon to costume up and drink our asses off with everyone else.”\n\n“I think it would be fun,” Alexa replied. “I wouldn’t mind seeing where the Devil sleeps.”\n\n“Not sleeps, stomps, apparently,” Anthony replied. “And if you want to go then I guess that means I want to go too. But we WILL be back on Saturday so we can go nuts with everyone else.”\n\n“Don’t worry hon, we’ll be back in time for plenty of drunken debauchery. Just for you.”\n\nRichard, however, still wasn’t convinced.\n\n“You guys have fun, but I’m gonna have to take a raincheck.”\n\nWe could’ve gone, just the three of us, but I wanted the whole gang there.\n\n“Come on Richie, you don’t want to abandon us on this adventure! We wouldn’t be able to go camping without your knowledge; you practically grew up in the woods.”\n\n“Growing up on a farm is not the same as growing up in the woods.”\n\n“Tell me, do you know how to build a fire?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Track animals?”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“Navigate in the woods without a GPS?”\n\n“Of course.”\n\n“Then clearly we need you! If we went by ourselves, we may very well get lost and end up mauled by bears. Do you really want that on your conscience?”\n\nHe still didn’t seem convinced.\n\nI continued: “Besides, you know as well as we do that spot isn’t REALLY haunted. Just some story the locals drummed up to convince tourists to get off the interstate and spend some money in the town there. Part of the fun will be us proving, for ourselves and everyone else, that it’s just another place to camp!”\n\nReluctantly, Richard agreed to come along. Thus, that Friday afternoon found us packed up and on the road making the two-hour drive to the Devil’s Clearing. \n\n\\-----------------------\n\nWe arrived around dusk at what amounted to little more than a wide space of gravel on the side of a two-lane highway that the NC Department of Transportation had apparently forgotten about over the past fifty years. A faded wooden sign marked the spot: “The Devil’s Clearing: All Who Fear His Wrath Shall Abandon This Place.”\n\n“Super cute greeting,” Alexa commented as she took a tent from Anthony out of the back of the SUV. “Do you think they do continental breakfasts here?”\n\nSarcastic comments or not, I was hyped. We were finally about to check out one of the most fabled haunted sites in the state. I had brought along a trail cam to set up outside our tent in hopes that I might actually catch something on video (realistically probably nothing more than a deer, but a guy can hope, right?). \n\nWithin minutes we had unpacked our gear and began our march down the narrow, overgrown trail leading to the Clearing. I led the way with Anthony and Alexa shortly behind, but Richard hesitated by the car, staring nervously into the woods and slightly fidgeting from side to side. “Come on, Dick! Time to go exploring!” Anthony called out over his shoulder. With a quiet “hmph,” Richard slowly began trudging along behind us.\n\nIt’s hard to overstate my anticipation as we walked the two hundred or so yards into the woods that would bring us to the Clearing. It had been described online as an eerie freak of nature: a perfect circle of dead ground in an otherwise lush forest, at least 30 meters in diameter. There were never even any animal prints in the dirt, as the creatures that wandered the woods knew instinctually to never set foot inside it. Like I said before, it was probably just a bunch of smoke, but if there were a spot where I might actually see something freaky then surely this was the place.\n\nAfter several minutes of walking beneath the thick shade of the pines, we finally came to the Clearing itself and – well, all I can say is that I felt nothing but disappointment. There was a clearing there, sure. But what had been described as a 20 meter wide dead zone was easily less than half that, with sprigs of grass and weeds jutting out of the woodline to leave a small patch of dirt that didn’t look any different than any distended campsite you might come across in a state park. The circle had clearly been walked through; deer tracks were embedded in the circle straight across the middle. On the far side, a few empty Bud Light cans were slowly rusting in the twilight.  \n\n“Wow, you were right Michael, this is *suuuper* spooky,” Anthony remarked as he casually ambled through the clearing. “This is too wild. I don’t think I’ll feel safe staying here tonight.”\n\nHe walked over to the empty beer cans and made a big show of timidly reaching down and picking one up with his thumb and forefinger. Looking back at us he whispered shrilly, “Do you think *the Devil* drank these?”\n\n“Shut the fuck up Anthony,” Alexa replied as she tossed the tent down in the middle of the circle. “I mean, the place is *a little* creepy.”\n\nBut it wasn’t; it was just another spot in the woods. Even Richard had eased up a little; after dragging himself down the trail like a cord was trying to pull him back to the road, he now walked about more freely as he examined our lodgings for the evening. He knelt down and began examining the deer tracks, no doubt imagining himself in a stand waiting with his rifle for when the animal would return. \n\nIt was at that point that we could have easily chalked the trip up to a loss and walked back to the car. We could have made it back to campus just in time to hit up a few after parties and tell some funny stories about the horrifying dirt clump in the woods. But damn it, this place was famous for a reason and I wasn’t going to leave until I gave it a chance to show me what it could do. \n\n“Let’s get the tents set up before it gets dark,” I said.\n\n\\---------------\n\nThe next few hours passed by like any evening camping trip. We set up our two tents (Anthony and Alexa to one and Richard in the other with me) about twenty feet from one another in the circle. We got a small campfire going in between by which we roasted some hot dogs on sticks and drank a few IPAs we brought along while we made idle small talk as evening turned to full dark. As of yet, nothing out of the ordinary had occurred.\n\nI could tell Anthony was getting restless. He was very much the people person of the group; pulling him away from the house parties and bar hopping of the university over what was turning out to be nothing seemed to be getting under his skin. \n\n“Maybe the poor guy is still asleep,” he said, tossing his head lackadaisically around the clearing and glancing into the darkened woods beyond. “Hell, he *has* been busy these past few years. I could use a nap too if I were him.”\n\n“Just give it time,” I replied. “Even if nothing happens, at least we can say we stayed the night didn’t get scared off.”\n\nAnthony stood up and started walking toward his tent. “I’ve got an idea,” he said over his shoulder. Reaching into his tent, he rummaged around in his bag and returned holding a worn leather book. “I think he might need a little pick-me-up.”\n\n“What the hell is that?” Richard asked.\n\n“Oh, nothing, just the *Book of the Dead*,” Anthony replied, exultant. “If the Devil is just being shy, maybe we can let him know he’s amongst friends.”\n\nRichard turned pale. “Put that away.”\n\n“Yeah, stop screwing around,” Alexa said. “That’s not some ancient tome. It’s just some crappy book you picked up at 2nd and Charles.”\n\n“If you can buy the Bible in a bookstore, no reason this couldn’t be legit too,” Anthony rejoined. He held his hands above his head and began to speak in a loud, deep voice: “Oh Lucifer, Lord of Darkness –”\n\n“Anthony, stop.” Richard had stood up and was glaring at him across the fire. “You’re playing with forces beyond your control.”\n\nAnthony grinned. “Don’t worry, Dick. You’ll be fine. I’ll put in a good word for you.” He continued to beckon to the Devil while waving the book over his head.\n\nRichard approached, fists clenched. “I said cut it out.” He walked until he was standing face to face with Anthony, who faltered under his intense stare. “Okay man, Jesus. Chill out,” he said. He lowered the book and Richard, mollified, turned to walk back to his seat. As soon as his back was turned, Anthony smirked and quickly yelled “SATAN REVEAL YOURSELF!”\n\n“You son of a bitch!” Richard yelled as he spun around and grabbed Anthony by the collar. He raised his fist and I jumped up to pull him back, but we all froze as a terrible howl pierced through the trees.\n\nWe stood silent for what seemed like an eternity. Finally, Alexa said, “Um, what the fuck was that?”\n\nRichard slumped backward onto the ground, staring into space. He was trembling. “He’s here,” he said, his voice quavering. “He’s really here.” With that, he jumped up and ran over to our tent. He snatched out his survival bag (ever the outdoorsman, he brought an emergency pack), and began frantically staggering into the woods.\n\n“We can’t stay in the circle,” he said. “We have to find some place else.” And with that, he disappeared into the darkness. \n\n“Richard, hey! Wait! I’m sorry!” Anthony called as he ran after him. He yelled back to us over his shoulder: “Just stay put! I’ll get him.”\n\nAnd just like that, Alexa and I were alone, standing by the campfire. It was silent; we heard no more screeching sounds as we anxiously awaited the return of Anthony and Richard. Eventually, we retreated to one of the tents to collect ourselves until they came back. \n\nSitting inside, we waited for what felt like at least an hour.  My nerves were wracked; it didn’t make sense that Anthony and Richard hadn’t come back yet. Where were they?\n\nAlexa was faring no better. It was obvious the mysterious scream (more like some inhuman, wailing screech) had frightened her, as it had all of us, but combined with the fact that the time was ticking by and her boyfriend still hadn’t come back was leaving her visibly shaken. I tried to make light of the situation, talking about the different types of birds native to the North Carolina wilderness and how some species have piercing, ear-splitting calls.  I don’t know anything about birds, but I knew she didn’t either so I figured it might help. Besides, being the only one to actually grow up in North Carolina I think my words carried some slight degree of credibility.\n\n“You’re probably right, we just got spooked,” she said, easing up a bit from the tight ball she had wrapped herself into in the corner. “But still, where the fuck is Anthony?” She lifted her phone above her head, trying to get a signal but in vain. “Even if he couldn’t get Richard to come back, he would’ve gotten irritated and given up by now.”\n\nI knew she was right. Anthony had a lot of decent qualities, but patience wasn’t one of them. It was easy to imagine bull-headed Richard storming off into the forest and completely ignoring Anthony badgering him, but Anthony would only keep it up for so long before he’d leave his friend to his fate and return to the beer cooler by the tent. \n\nAs if by magic, we could suddenly make out the sound of footsteps approaching the tent. “See? Back already,” I said, hoping the relief wasn’t too obvious in my voice. I reached for the zipper and began to open the door of the tent when Alexa grabbed my arm.\n\n“Wait,” she whispered. Then, in a louder voice called out: “Anthony? Richard?” \n\nThe footsteps stopped, and there was silence. After a moment, however, the footsteps continued, growing louder as they approached the tent. I sat still, tense, waiting. Whoever was outside apparently had no interest in joining us, however. The steps came right to the side of the tent, paused for a moment, and then the anonymous figure began to walk again, circling us. Alexa was a statue; she had bitten down on the sleeve of her sweater and only her eyes moved in their sockets as she followed the sound of the footsteps around the tent. \n\nAfter the figure had walked around us a few times, the suspense began to wear off for me. It dawned on me that it was most likely Anthony pulling a prank; something like this would be right up his alley. Becoming more sure of myself with each passing moment, I reached for the zipper and tugged, calling out as I did so. “Oh, for God’s sake Anthony, you son of a – ”\n\nAnd then, less than three feet away, came that awful screeching. It was hard to tell where that sound ended and Alexa’s screams began. \n\nI was paralyzed. There was no doubt at that point that the sound wasn’t a bird, it wasn’t a bat, it wasn’t some big mountain cat. No, that was the most insane, malevolent screeching I had ever heard. I sat motionless as Alexa squeezed back into the corner, away from the sound. \n\nI slowly managed to regain my nerves as I heard the footsteps begin to move away from the campsite. Steeling myself, I again reached for the zipper. I *had* to see it; I had to know what it was. \n\nThrough the small opening I had made, I peered past the campfire at the woodline beyond and my breath stopped. Just outside the light of the fire, between the trees in the darkness I saw eyes staring at me. Glowing, blood red eyes. Eyes the size of footballs, blazing through the darkness into me. \n\nAlexa crouched further back into the tent, digging her nails into her knees. “Wh- what is it?” When I did nothing but stare in horrified, transfixed silence, again: “*WHAT THE FUCK IS IT?*”\n\nI was gathering the nerve to tell her to run, to tear through the opening in the tent and run as fast as she could back to the car, to run and not think a second thought about me, about Anthony, about Richard, when suddenly the eyes disappeared. I blinked, registering what was happening when an unfamiliar voice yelled out “Hey! What the hell?!” \n\nRustling sounds came from the woods, sounds of a scuffle, followed by Anthony yelling out “The jig is up, assholes!” With that, Anthony came running into the clearing, holding what looked like a large keyboard. Behind him came two burly, haggard looking men, both wearing hunting jackets and appearing more annoyed than malicious. \n\n“Get back here you little bastard! That shit costs money!” one yelled as they ran after Anthony. Our friend whirled around as he reached the tent and held the object over his head, yelling back at them. “Come any closer and I’ll smash the damn thing that *costs money*!” \n\nThe second of the pair, a larger, bearded man who had been following slightly behind the first, grabbed the other man’s arm and brought him to a stop. “Might as well calm down Brantley, they got us.” The two stood halfway between us and the woodline, their faces faintly visible in the campfire.\n\nThe sheer absurdity of it all helped me to break my reverie. “Wh-, what the hell is going on here?” I said, my abject terror quickly succumbing to an incredulous irritation.\n\n“What’s *happening* here,” Anthony replied, “is that after I couldn’t catch up with Richie, I came walking back and stumbled on these dickheads flashing lights and blasting weird sounds into the woods with *this* thing.” He held the object in his hand out toward me. In the glow of the firelight, I could tell that it was some kind of control board, a nice one, probably for a sound system.\n\n“Be careful with that,” the apparent leader of the duo said, carefully holding his hand out in a gesture of concern. “Like I said, shit costs money. Now calm down and hand it over and we can all be on our way.”\n\n“Like hell, dude,” Anthony spat back. He held the control board out over the still crackling fire. “The two of you are going to give us some answers or I’m scorching this piece of shit.”\n\n“Alright man, damn!” one of the men said. This one had been the first into the clearing and looked younger than the first, and clean shaven. “It’s all a hoax, okay? We come out here with this stuff and get the campers all stirred up and they run tell their friends they done come across the Devil himself out here. Then they get the hell gone in a hurry. Got it?”\n\nIt was absolutely ridiculous. This whole legend I had built up in my head, excited to *finally* see something even faintly supernatural, could all be boiled down to a couple of rednecks just scaring folks? \n\n“….got it?” a voice trembled from the left of where the two men stood. None of us had noticed that Alexa had crept out of the tent, taking in the scene and slowly walking in a semicircle toward the interlopers.\n\n“*GOT IT?!”* she screamed, as she rushed forward, one of her hiking boots in hand, and started swinging it at the younger man. He threw up his hands to block the blows and backed away as Alexa came on.\n\n“Got it, you son of a bitch?! We come out here  -*whack*\\-  and you scare us  -*whack*\\-  half to fucking  -*whack*\\-  death, you STUPID REDNECK MOTHERFUCKERS?! YEAH WE FUCKING GOT IT!”\n\nShe continued striking the smaller man until his friend moved forward and slowly stepped between them. Holding up his hands, he said “okay now darling, that’s enough. I get that y’all are pissed, but look at it from our angle. We get folks sneaking up here down all the time, leaving beer cans and weed butts and all other kinds of trash that we have to clean up, so sometimes we come out here to scare little thrill seekers like y’all off. We can’t help that the state decided to put that damn sign up out there on the road, but contrary to popular belief these woods are actually private property – *our* property – so, pissed or not, we’re gonna need you to take your temper and your friends over there and get the hell on down the road. Understand?”\n\nAnthony, forever the diplomat, replied: “I understand that you can kiss my balls.”\n\nThe man shrugged. “Have it your way. Go ahead and stick around; we’ll have the law out here in half an hour. Now unless you want to be charged with injuring personal property on top of trespassing, I’d hand that piece of equipment back over.”\n\n“Oh I’ll fucking hand it over,” Anthony said. He held it high over his head, preparing to slam it into the fire, when I grabbed his arm. “Nah man,” I said. “It’s not worth it. We might as well go on back; clearly there’s nothing to see out here anyway.” I pulled the board out of his hands and took it to the larger man. “We’ll pack up and go,” I said, handing it over, “but you two can still get fucked.”\n\nThe man smirked. “Good call, kid.” With that, he motioned to the younger of the pair and they walked back into the woods.\n\n\\--------------------\n\nThere isn’t much to tell about the next half hour. We packed up our gear and took it back to the truck, mumbling about the weird, ignorant folks you can stumble upon out in the sticks, debating whether we could get back to campus in time to catch the last of the Halloween festivities. Anthony and Alexa could sense my disappointment at how things had gone, so they offered to go back and get Richard while I kicked back in the car and took a nap.\n\nI woke up about an hour later to find that no one had returned. I pulled out my phone to call them, but I had no service. After about ten more minutes had passed and I still hadn’t heard anything, I got impatient and started back in the direction of the clearing, my Mag-Light cutting a powerful beam of light through the trees. As I walked, I could hear the usual sounds of the nighttime forest around me: crickets, frogs, the occasional hoot of an owl. When a rustling would come from a tree above me I knew it was just a squirrel, or a raccoon; under different circumstances I might have been spooked, but that feeling had gone as it had become apparent that the only thing haunting those woods was a couple of beer-bellied rednecks that had too much time on their hands.\n\nI came to the clearing and paused, listening for a sign that my friends were on their way back. Greeted with silence, I crossed to the far side where Richard had retreated earlier. Looking through the foliage, I could vaguely make out a path where he had torn through leaves and limbs in his panic. “Richard? Guys?” I called out to no response. I left the clearing behind and followed the crude trail into the darkness. \n\nAfter several minutes, the woods began to open up and I lost sight of markers showing where Richard had gone earlier. I paused, pondering what to do next. God forbid I wander off in the wrong direction just as everyone else returned to the car. As I stood there, I remembered a survivalist tip Richard had mentioned in the past: I pulled out a knife and cut through the bark on a nearby tree, leaving a mark that I could follow back when needed. My way back out secured, I carried on.\n\nAs I progressed further in, marking trees as I went, a sense of dread came over me. I wasn’t sure what it was at first; was it the disorientation from wandering in an unfamiliar forest? Something in the air? The nagging thought in the back of my head of what would happen if my friends had run into the two rednecks again and they weren’t quite so friendly this time? \n\nThen it occurred to me. The forest was silent. The chirps, the rustling, the hooting of the owls had all died away at some point and I hadn’t noticed until that moment.\n\nI didn’t have time to reflect on this; I had barely registered the thought before I heard Alexa’s voice screaming “MICHAEL!” through the darkness up ahead.\n\nI broke into a sprint, knocking past the underbrush, running to the sound of her voice as Anthony’s joined it, yelling “Michael! Where are you?! We need your help!”\n\nSoon I could see a glow up ahead; flashlights. From a distance, I could see two shapes leaning down over a third. As I approached, it came into focus. Anthony and Alexa were kneeling down, shining their lights on the collapsed form of Richard, seizing and writhing on the ground in a clearing up ahead. From what I could see, he appeared to be coughing up blood.\n\n“Those bastards,” I thought to myself as I approached. The fucking hicks that had way too much pride in their land had attacked Richard and left him here to bleed out in the wilderness. Just wait until we got our friend back to the car and contacted the authorities; they’d be spending the rest of their lives in prison. But first, I needed to get to Richard and help stop the bleeding.\n\nAs I broke through the brush, almost falling upon my friends, a strong hand grabbed the back of my jacket and yanked me away. I turned and found myself nose to nose with the bearded man, his hand still gripped firmly on the back of my jacket.\n\n“Stay the FUCK away,” he growled at me. I twisted and turned from his grip, and as I did I pulled my right arm back and came around with a wild swing aimed straight for his jaw. He managed to deflect and struggled with me, grappling, trying to bring me to the ground. I grabbed him by both arm and was able to bring my knee up into his groin, at which point he thrust me away.\n\nFalling onto the ground, I pulled myself to my feet to run toward my friends. The bearded man collected himself and grabbed for my jacket as I was standing, but I jerked away and ran and –\n\nI froze.\n\nStanding on one foot, stopped dead in my tracks, I stood nose to nose with Anthony.\n\nThe phrase “nose to nose” is used from time to time, but I was literally a centimeter from touching noses with my friend as he stood calmly, staring into me with eyes that weren’t his own, a light smile on his face. In fact, there didn’t seem to be eyes at all; just two large, black, empty spaces where his eyes should have been.\n\n“Michael, help us,” he whispered. “Richard needs you.”\n\n“Stay away, kid.” The bearded man had risen to his feet behind me. “Don’t listen to that thing.”\n\nI looked down to see that my foot was planted in a soft bed of pine needles that came to an abrupt end less than an inch from where it was planted; beyond that was a barren ground upon which my friend stood. Looking up, I could faintly tell in the moonlit darkness that the lifeless ground made up a small circle encompassing Richard and Alexa in the background.\n\n“Michael, *you* brought us here,” Anthony continued. “You let this happen. You need to help your friend.” Almost on cue, Richard started coughing up blood behind him. Alexa kneeled beside his body, staring into me with the same lifeless eyes, beckoning me to come tend to him.\n\nI collapsed backward, falling to the ground as I stared, dumbfounded, at what had once been my best friends in the world.\n\n“Not coming to join us? That’s a shame,” Anthony went on, that same empty smile on his face. “We could’ve had such an *awesome* time together.”\n\nAlexa walked toward us, and Richard got up as well. They came to stand on either side of Anthony, looking down on me with an unnatural glee upon their cold faces.\n\n“Don’t be such a fucking baby,” Alexa said. “Yeah,” Richard continued. “You guys were right; there’s really nothing to be afraid of.”\n\nWhen I crawled backward, cringing at the sight of my friends, Anthony sneered: “Alas, our good buddy has decided to abandon us. No matter; one way or another, *everyone* ends up where we are.”\n\nWith that, the trio stepped back, and as they did, a disembodied pair of eyes faded into view behind them. A *red* pair of eyes, each as large as boulders, hanging suspended in the air above their heads.\n\n“We’ll see you soon, my dude,” the thing that was once Anthony said.\n\nI blacked out.\n\n\\-----\n\nWhen I came to, I was laying on the couch in the living room of an old farmhouse, a tweed blanket tucked neatly over me. The two rednecks (turns out their names were Frank and Roland) were there, and they explained to me the nature of their game.\n\nThe Clearing had always been there; the natives had avoided it for most of their history, although it’s said that at certain times they occasionally offered sacrifices to it, but there was no real evidence of it. Once the European settlers had arrived, the few close enough to know what it was had the good sense to keep it a secret and keep their distance. But of course, there was always a loose-lipped passerby that would tell the tale of the “evil circle” at the next tavern he wandered into, and through the generations the tale of the Devil’s Clearing would become a folk legend, enticing those searching for something beyond the mundane to seek it out.\n\nFor a time, the church could hold curious travelers at bay, threatening them with damnation lest they seek out the forbidden ground. But as time went on, a more secular world demanded more secular tactics. Letting people know what was there obviously wouldn’t work; that was the draw in the first place. And covering it up couldn’t work; that would just add to the mystique, considering the legend was already on the lips of any drunk in a nearby bar wishing to tell a story. The answer the locals had finally settled on was to build a clearing closer to the nearest thoroughfare and salt the earth, carefully tending a barren patch of ground and scaring any trespassers with hokey effects in the hope of convincing them that it wasn’t worthwhile to explore in the first place. \n\nOf course, that didn’t always work. On the rare occasions an intrepid explorer went in search of the real Clearing and managed to find it, the local authorities would head up the search party (not that any body would ever be found) and lead the teams on paths that conveniently managed to skirt around that abominable place. Eventually, as with any missing persons case that never bears fruit, the people would begin to accept the loss and move on.\n\nThat was six months ago. I swore never to speak of the Clearing, lest more kids as curious as me go out in search of it. And when the police questioned me about my knowledge of my friends’ disappearance in the following days, I simply told them the truth: Richard got scared and ran into the woods, then Anthony and Alexa went to find him while I waited by the car. That was the last I saw of them. I *know* that was the last I really saw of them; those things in the circle that looked like them were anything but.\n\nI refused to join the search party. I could keep my mouth shut and let the locals handle it the way they always had, but I drew the line at going anywhere near that place again. \n\nI held onto that conviction for months. I hoped that as time went along I would be able to forget, but I keep seeing them everywhere I look. I don't sleep at night anymore; I lay in bed with my eyes shut tight, knowing that the moment I open them my friends will be there, clinging to the ceiling, beckoning me to come home with them as they grin and stare with those lifeless, obsidian eyes. \n\nTherapy hasn't worked, nor the mountains of medication or rivers of alcohol I've drowned myself in trying to make it stop. Every night it's still the same. Sometimes they tell me it's not bad at all; they're actually living out a blissful existence that never has to end. Other times they scream and wail, saying its my fault and only if I would come back, that it might ease their suffering a little.\n\nAt any rate, whatever hell they've found themselves in, the one I've been in since that night can't be any better. One way or another, this has to end.\n\nI didn't pack a bag; I don't think I'm going to need one. Even the flashlight seems like a bit much; somehow I feel that it'll make sure I find my way there.\n\nI guess, even now, I still need to know. Believe this story or not; I don't care. Just one piece of advice to anyone who finds this:\n\nFor your own sake, don’t come looking for me.",

        "text": "Sorry if this is a stupid question, but I don't know much about cats and I tried Google but nothing really matched what Gremlin has. \n\nI work part-time at my dad's garage while I study, and there's this stray, black cat that always lurks around outside. We don't know if it's male or female, but it has long, rough fur and looks like it's had a pretty tough life. Its ears are torn, its hind legs are at a weird angle, and its tail is crooked. The other employees shoo it away when they see it, but I don't. On my lunch breaks, I always throw it a little bit of food. At first it wouldn't eat, but soon it began to trust me and that made me happy.\n\nI named it Gremlin and soon it learned to come to me when I called it. It took longer for it to let me pet it, but today it finally did, and that's when I noticed the white bumps. First, I jerked my hand away, because I thought they were bugs or something, but Gremlin didn't seem to be in pain, sick, or itchy, so I put my gloves on and parted the fur on its back for a closer look.\n\nI'm not sure how to describe them. They're the size of an average pimple, but they're white, almost pearly. At first I got grossed out because I thought they were parasite eggs or something, but then I checked all of Gremlin and these bumps cover its skin completely beneath the fur. Like, top to bottom. Nose to tail. When I poked one, it felt hard, and I could see a small black dot on the top. Almost like a pore.\n\nI wanted to check Gremlin's mouth, ears, and paws too, but Nash walked out for his cigarette break and kicked at Gremlin, making it run away. Out of everyone who works for my dad, I like Nash the least. He's always belittling me, teasing me, and making barely veiled sexist remarks. I complain to my dad all the time, but he keeps telling me I have to learn to stand up for myself. \n\nSo when Nash kicked at Gremlin, I exploded at him, but he just laughed like the ass he is and told me a garage was no place for a Disney princess, but he wouldn't mind if I wanted to play with his snake. Furious and disgusted, I slapped him so hard his cigarette went flying out of his mouth. I'd never done anything like that before and I was shaking as I ran to my dad. Thankfully, he finally came to his senses and fired Nash.\n\nI didn't see Gremlin the rest of the day, though. I really hope Nash didn't scare it away for good because I'm worried about those bumps. Will I need to take it to the vet? I'd appreciate some advice.\n\nI'm also going to stay late at the garage in case Gremlin returns, so I can take photos of the bumps. I just want to make sure it's okay.\n\n*Edit:* Guys, I'm scared and I don't know what to do. I'm in my car outside the garage, I was vibing to music and waiting for Gremlin to show up, and I saw Nash's car park a distance away. He walked over, and my heart fell to my feet when I saw him pull up his hood and mask and put on gloves.\n\nI'm beyond grateful it was dark enough for him to not notice my car, and I held my breath as I watched him break into the garage. We have security cameras but no alarm, so I called the police immediately. They said they'd be here within ten minutes and told me to drive somewhere safe.\n\nI was so ready to do that, because I could hear Nash breaking things inside and I didn't want to imagine what he'd do to me for getting him fired. But just before I could turn the key, I saw Gremlin run inside the garage.\n\nGuys, I'm scared. If Nash sees Gremlin, there's no doubt he'll hurt it or even kill it. I'm half thinking I go in and tell him I called the cops. Maybe that'll scare him enough to run. Or maybe I can honk the horn, distract him. Oh, God, I don't know what to do.\n\n*Edit:* This evening has been … I don't know how to describe it. I'm still shaken. I'm in an ambulance now, they're telling me to put the phone down and rest, but I need answers.\n\nIt might've been a stupid idea, but I honked the horn. I don't know what I was expecting other than Nash barging out with his crowbar held up. I should've started the car and drove off, had him follow me. Instead, I yelled through my closed window that I knew it was him and I called the cops.\n\nMy voice was shaking like crazy, and I don't think he even heard me properly because instead of running away, he stomped over and swung his crowbar right at my window. The glass cracked and I screamed and jerked away, my panicked hand searching for the key.\n\nI screamed again when Nash jumped on the hood and shattered my windshield, and I dropped my phone as I tried to shield my face from the exploding shards. Scrambling away, I squeezed myself into the backseat, my heart hammering as I barely avoided Nash reaching in for me.\n\nI turned to the door, ready to whip it open and run out, only to scream even louder at the silhouette charging towards us from the garage.\n\nI don't even know how to begin to describe it. It was almost the size of a horse, but moved like a spider with a billion legs. Those legs swished and whipped from every angle, almost like vines, making the creature seem weightless as it zoomed towards us.\n\nNash noticed it too late, and one of its legs shot up and wrapped around his ankles, yanking him off my car. He landed with a sickening crack on the asphalt and made a croaking sound I wish to never ever hear again. Trembling, I peered through the window, and my stomach turned as I watched those legs wrap themselves around Nash. He wasn't moving, but he was alive, and the last thing I saw of him was the panic in his eyes before he was completely covered.\n\nVomit burned my throat as I sat there, cowering in the backseat. I didn't know what to do. I was afraid if I made a run for it, it would be faster than me. But if I stayed put, I was an easy target if it noticed me.\n\nI lost my chance at a choice when the creature whipped its legs around my car, pulling it towards it. I screamed as I bounced around inside, terrified that this would be the way I died. The more legs that covered the car, the darker it became, and soon I was hyperventilating in pitch darkness.\n\nThanks to Nash, the windshield was broken, and I sobbed as I manically jerked away from the coarse legs sliding over my body and weaving in my hair. The smell of an extinguished candle filled the car, and a strange drumming seemed to be echoing my rabid heartbeat. I expected each frantic breath to be my last, until the sound of sirens broke through my despair.\n\nNot a few seconds later, the legs drew back like paint dripping backwards, and the car bounced down, free. I collapsed in the backseat, breathless and shaking.\n\nMy father and the police found me, alone, with no trace of the creature or Nash. I tried to tell them what happened, but even I wouldn't have believed myself. I insisted we check the security cameras, but as we walked indoors, we noticed that multiple cameras inside and out were broken. I assumed Nash did it, but I was wrong.\n\nAs we watched the footage, we could see Nash breaking into the garage and smashing things left and right. Then, we saw Gremlin slink inside. With all the commotion, I'd almost forgotten about it, and I began to worry that the creature had devoured it too.\n\nI jumped when a black line streaked across the screen of one of the indoor cameras, cracking the lens before the feed disappeared. This happened to a few more cameras a distance from Nash, so it couldn't be him. He didn't even seem to notice, too preoccupied with his own destruction.\n\nAfter four cameras broke, Nash turned towards the door. That must've been when I leaned on the horn. We watched him stomp outside and begin smashing my car, and I sat up, my pulse racing as I waited for the creature to appear. Instead, all we got were black streaks that broke the feed.\n\nI didn't know what to say. Neither did anyone else. But everyone agreed I should go to the hospital to get my injuries checked out and to get help dealing with the trauma.\n\nAs I was being led to an ambulance, I noticed a shadow on the roof of the garage, and my eyes went wide with relief at the sight of Gremlin. It perched on the corner, its eyes reflecting the red and blue lights around us, and my jaw fell open when it swished its tail. \n\nOr … tails.\n\nMany vine-like tails.\n\nI blinked, and it was just a regular tail. \n\nOne, singular, fluffy tail.\n\nMy heart thudded. Maybe I imagined it. It's possible, after everything that just happened.\n\nBut … is it possible I didn't imagine it?\n\nI know it sounds crazy. I feel crazy. I just want answers.\n\n\\-----\n\n[SR](https://www.reddit.com/r/Skittishreflections)",

        "text": "I worked at Blockbuster in 2008 – I think I know why most of the stores started shutting down.\n\nMore and more often these days –  and always without warning – I find myself in our old store. Well, a darker version of it.\n\nIt certainly hasn’t aged well. Instead of the small and airy space it once was, it’s now door-less, windowless. Even worse, endless. The actual store itself is long gone, it was torn down sometime in 2010, I believe; a Starbucks was built in the old location. It’s funny, sometimes I swear I can catch the faintest whiff of burnt coffee floating on the air – it’s a nice change from the usual odor of mold, fear, and decay.\n\nIn this version, the ceiling tiles show dark water stains, lights hang astray dangling by thin and fraying wires from the ceiling, dimly flashing before leaving entire swaths of the store bathed in darkness. The carpets are faded and often the original patterns are obscured by years' worth of rust-colored stains. Many of the shelves and fixtures have fallen, creating more obstacles in my path, but at least the bodies seem disappear eventually. \n\nSometimes, I have room enough to run through a wide chamber with no ceiling or walls in sight, but other times it’s so narrow or the ceiling is so low that I have no choice but to waste precious time flattening myself and slowly inching sideways through a 3 foot wide opening, or crawling on already bruised and bleeding knees.\n\nThe other thing about those small spaces, besides wondering if you’ll suddenly see him emerge, inching towards in the darkness behind you – or worse, in front out you – is that you’re more at risk of knocking something off the shelves. \n\nThe other thing that calls the store home, he doesn’t have ears in the conventional sense, but seems to have excellent hearing. My visits to this other place are shrouded in the dread and knowledge that he will eventually catch me. I saw what happened to Lizzy – she was so tired, one day she simply sat down and refused to get back up. That’s how I learned that he seems to have a taste for eyes.\n\nMaybe starting with the eyes is even a small kindness of sorts, that way you don’t have to witness what happens next.\n\nWe call him Benny, because what better name for an unholy and barely describable abomination than the title of the DVD that it emerged from?\n\nAt my store, the beginning of the end was on a humid July evening. Lizzy and I were re-shelving returned DVDs when she found one nestled on the rack between the others that clearly didn’t belong. It looked old, its outer plastic layer was a bit battered, the plain white DVD case was yellowing along the spine; it didn’t even have a lock on it. She opened it to reveal an otherwise plain disc with ‘*Benny '78*’ handwritten on it in loose cursive.\n\nIt wasn’t the first home movie someone had tried to sneak onto our shelves (and in our experience, they were seldom of the family friendly variety). We pulled it right away and stuck it behind the counter. \n\nAbout a week later, minutes within the store opening, a disheveled looking customer began frantically pounding on the front window. He had an air of anxiety, desperation, and something else about him that I couldn’t quite put my finger on but made me grateful for the thick glass acting as a barrier between us. \n\nHe demanded to speak to our manager, I gestured that the doors were unlocked, but he refused to so much as set foot inside the store. His eyes were bulging, the skin around them scratched and covered with dried blood, the stains of which still lingered on his fingertips. He stared at me so intensely, only breaking his gaze when his eyes would suddenly dart side to side, as if there was something lurking just beyond his periphery that demanded his immediate and undivided attention. \n\nAlthough muffled, I could hear him muttering things about hallways, eyes, and hunger. I remember being profoundly relieved that *I* wasn’t the one that had to deal to him.\n\nOur shift lead went out to talk to him, and eventually came back carrying a DVD case, pristine except for the dried bloody fingerprints. It was one of our new releases from the same section where the plain white box had first shown up, inside was the wrong disk, it was *Benny '78*.  \n\nWe were supposed to always verify that the DVD in the case was the right one (and undamaged) before renting it out, but it looked like someone had missed that one.\n\nAfter that, *Benny '78* started showing up in more and more cases belonging to popular titles. At first, we were able to catch them before they went out without too much impact to business.\n\nWithin a month, though, we were pulling more movies off the shelf than we were renting out. We didn’t know where they were coming from – some did come in through the return box, but many seemed to change overnight right on the shelves. The cases were locked, meaning if someone was switching them, it would’ve likely been an employee, but the cameras didn’t capture anyone or anything touching them at all. \n\nIt got to the point where every single case we opened contained *Benny '78*. Even for new shipments right off the truck, it seemed like not long after they touched our shelves, they too would contain that telltale disk with the cursive handwriting. \n\nCustomers stopped coming in – at first, I thought it was due to a bad experience or our mostly bare shelves, but over time I noticed that some of the teachers and kids from my senior class would miss hours or days at school – they sometimes stopped showing up entirely.\n\nWe had no choice but to close. Typically, the standard procedure would have been to mark down and sell the new and the non-damaged rental DVDs, but for us, well, corporate told us that every single movie in the store needed to be burned. So, our entire rental stock went up in flames, leaving nothing but the warped remains of plastic and a long-lingering and acrid black smoke.\n\nWe thought we had been so careful, but we made a mistake.\n\nAfter we destroyed all the rentals, my boyfriend Charlie had nabbed a few marked down DVDs from our new stock, still pristine in their plastic wrap. \n\nI didn’t even think to check the disk in the case before he popped it in – it wasn’t a rental; it had never even been *opened*. We’d never thought to check, much less burn, the new movies.\n\nAt first the screen was as white as the first DVD case had been – we thought it was a bad disk but as Charlie when to turn it off, a black and grey static filled the screen and I found myself so disoriented that I nearly forgot where I was, what I was doing. Then, I felt him seep out of my eyes like painful, forced, oily tears. He spread like black ink, bleeding into the shadows of the room and always just slightly out of my line of sight. I never saw him fully until he started pulling me into his world, that place adjacent to our own. \n\nI remember the exact moment I did see him for the first time, those endless pits of eyes, a dark form not entirely solid. Lizzy told me to leave her and run, but sometimes I still wonder if I could’ve done something to save her.\n\nWhen he pulls you in, it may be for minutes, hours, or if you’re particularly unlucky, days. And then, just as suddenly as you were in, you’re back home.\n\nCharlie didn’t last very long. I haven’t seen him since 2012, neither in the real world, nor the winding halls of the old store.\n\nI’ve met a few other former employees and customers that came from where the halls leading to other stores converge and I learned the same thing happened in their stores, too. Some – those that looked especially worse for the wear – said they received the initial video as a VHS. \n\nIt sounds like the very first copy was a Betamax that just appeared one day on the shelf of the original store back in the late 1980s. It was like a contagion, corrupting everything it touched, they said. \n\nSome of them believe that destroying the original tape will free us from whatever force is imprisoning us; hopefully put an end to Benny himself, too. I don’t know if it’d work, but knowing our eventual fates, any source of hope is worth clinging to.\n\nI thought that maybe we were nearing the end now that nearly every single blockbuster has closed, but I’ve met a few people here who have never been to one, much less rented DVDs there in the early 2000s. \n\nIt seems like digital versions have been going around; I’m beginning to suspect that someone ripped one of the old DVDs. I’m not sure why they would do that intentionally – spite? Or maybe because they know that every person you pull into that endless maze of converging hallways means one more life Benny might take before your own?\n\nI wonder how many of you I’ll end up seeing eventually. Maybe you’ll click a link, and then next thing you know, you’ll feel the sensation of Benny coming through your eyes from the inside out.\n\nI’m so tired. I’ve been trying for years, but I’ve only ever made it to the old VHS section – I’ve never even seen a Betamax. Sometimes, wonder if it even exists at all.\n\nI’m sharing this because I don’t think I can do for this much longer. Recently, my time there increases with every 'visit'. I’m worn out, I’m sleep deprived. \n\nI’m not as fast as I used to be. \n\nSomething tells me that the next time he pulls me in, I may never come back.\n\nSo, if you ever find yourself in the endless winding halls of a Blockbuster Video, I hope you can succeed where we’ve all failed. Please find and destroy the original Betamax video in the white case. \n\nOh, and remember, be careful what you [click on](https://www.reddit.com/r/JamFranz).",

I wanted to share some of the things I remember from back when I was a child that now seems... weird\n\nBe me, 4 or 5yo, watching CN or whatever, being invested in the TV, hypnotised as a kid is while watching cartoons. \n\nThere were two big shelves on the two sides of the tv, 5 floors of glass shelves with glasses and stuff in them. Just while I was watching, laying on the carpet, all the glasses fell, from nothing. It want an earthquake or something like that. I know it because only the glasses fell, not the shelves. And they were deep, if it was an earthquake, there couldve been at least one remaining there. \n\nThere wasn't. I remember my mother coming to the room and how she started to scream at me about the mess from all the glass across the floor. She soon realised it wasnt me. I wasnt tall enough to reach the upper shelves.\n\nYesterday I asked her if she remembered. She told me she did and went silent... That confirms i wasnt dreaming.. Its honestly creepy that i whould've died this day.\n\nDuring puberty I had a lot of sleep paralysis, but some of them were really fucked up. Once, my parents were doing some changes to my room so i had to sleep in the living room. \n\nThere was a big mirror in there, just standing on the table next to the wall, facing my bed cuz we were planning to put it on my wardrobe in my bedroom the next day. I woke up at night to see a bald, pinkish man with a black robe staring at the window. \n\nHe noticed me and shakes his hand to greet me... somehow, i managed to wave him back. Then, he stayed for a bit and got back in the mirror... I broke it in the morning, I was terrified. When my parents asked me why tf did i broke it, i said i dropped it by mistake down the stair and it wasn’t intentionally. Hell it was. \n\nTo this day, i don’t know what the hell that think was, but im sure i wasnt sleeping. I couldnt fall sleep again that night, i spend the whole 4 hours staring at the mirror till the sun came out. \n\nOne night, around an year later, i woke up to my brother, sitting on my gaming chair, watching me. He was just staying there, in the dark, watching me. I was still asleep so i just I asked him why isnt he sleeping, not thinking much about it. He said he is drawing. I yawned and turned around, ready to fall asleep again... just to see my brother, sleeping next to me on the bed. \n\nThen, i heard a pen falling behind me... I did not fuckng turned around, I couldnt. When I woke up, I picked up the pen. Wtf. A fking pen on the ground next to my bed… My room got a ton of things on the floor of my room, its a mess i admit it but… it was too weird for it to be a coincidence. \n\nI asked my brother if he could sleep on the couch in the living room tonight. He agreed, asking me why. I told him i wanted to be alone. He was 9 so i dont know what did he thought i wanted to do. Not like i knew, i just… felt good being alone this night. \n\nThanks to anyone who listened till the end, my story might not be the most interesting or extraordinary here but i wanted to share as... I rlly find it... creepy…",

        "author": "02321",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/117mo1o/i_work_as_a_csi_part_4_some_days_are_harder_than/",
        "text": "( First: https://redd.it/111m676 Previous: https://redd.it/113cjed )\nIn a very short amount of time, I found out that not only supernatural creatures were real, but they also needed a CSI. I debated whether I wanted to accept their job offer. The extra income was the main factor that swayed my choice. A handful of cases were sent to my email along with the amount each job paid. I gained a bonus if I trained a few Agents while working on the job. Since there were so many cases to cover, I doubted that having more people trained in my skills would ever dip into my income.\n\nWhen I asked about this job, I had been told that I would be working on scenes that could have been done by a human, or a creature. However, the first deaths I documented could only be committed by a monster. After all, I’d been requested to look over the deaths of torn-apart creatures. A human could not do such damage to these bodies. I’d worked with a few Agents and taught them as well as I could. Each of the ones I met went by a different number instead of a name, and they all look very similar.\n\nAt least they were good listeners. They have gotten a lot of recent cases of monsters killed with organs removed. Or their bodies with other pieces missing. The Agents I worked with told me that the body parts of monsters hold power. An organ could be turned into a weapon or a medicine. Sometimes creatures just eat the part of the body to gain a boost, but body parts are more effective after they’re processed.\n\nI taught these Agents a trick of putting VapoRub under your nose to help with the smell of decay while working. In exchange for that tip, they told me a little bit about how their world worked. I was stepping into this entire thing blind, so I wouldn’t understand much for a very long time.\n\n“Our world is mostly based on favors. Killing a creature and taking parts of them is very disrespectful if it was done by another creature.” An Agent told me as he kneeled by a mangled corpse.\n\nThe monster of the day looked to be a mixture of a bird and a fox. The body is as big as a car with most of the insides torn out. He was taking photos and trying his best to get as much coverage as possible. He went by a pretty big number of ten thousand and six. I just called him Six to save time. I also asked him if he really had over ten thousand brothers. He confirmed it, but he wasn’t aware of how many were still alive. That number could be in the low hundreds.\n\n“Don’t you creatures kill and eat humans all the time?” I asked and directed him to some places of interest to document.\n\nHe looked human. Jackalope did as well. A lot of these monsters held a human appearance, but others looked too terrifying to remain sane after encountering them.\n\n“That’s different. Most of the ones who kill and eat humans know you don’t follow the same cultures as us. Only the jerks would try and make you uphold favors and deals if you didn’t understand it beforehand. It can get pretty complicated understand if you’re not living in this world. A creature may feel it fair to kill another if that one set foot on its territory. They see it as the other creature who breathed their air and lived because of it, and that means they could take their life. Some monsters tend to twist words around to get their way.” Six explained the best he was able.\n\nI tried to wrap my head around it. If I came across a very bad monster, just looking or speaking to it may trap me in an unsuspected deal. Or if I came across a creature that only saw me as a meal instead of an equal to take something from, I would get eaten.\n\n“So... Monsters just eat humans instead of being complicated about it?” I slowly asked.\n\n“Some, yeah.” Six agreed and went back to taking photos.\n\nI suddenly worried about what kind of job I took and the kind of world I stumbled into. The Agent didn’t appear to notice my distress and we worked together to finish the scene. His theory was a Hunter, or a poacher attacked the creature we documented. I needed to have Six explain the difference.\n\n“There is another company made up of only humans that track down creatures to kill them. They use magic, so it would make sense why they took organs from this creature. Most likely they wanted to create a weapon to hunt down more of the supernatural. Hunters kill anything not natural out of hatred. Poachers do so for money. They’ll only kill if it’s profitable.” Six explained not sounding too bothered by the fact some humans hunted his kind.\n\n“Doesn’t The Corporation do something about The Hunters?” I asked.\n\nA noise drew my attention to the woods. A set of deep yellow eyes stared back at us through the trees making me jump. It was clear some sort of monster was watching us. I raised my camera as a poor defense in case the thing rushed over to attack us. A snout very similar to the dead creature we were investigating came out. After a few sniffs, the thing retreated into the woods. I breathed a little easier but wasn’t able to fully relax.\n\n“Don’t worry. Those creatures won’t attack you while you’re with us. And no, The Corporation doesn’t stop The Hunters most of the time. To be honest, it’s all above my pay grade. They work together when needed and both know of each other’s movements. I know that The Hunters have killed Agents or tried to ruin The Corporation but there was never proof. Or they claimed a rouge Hunter was the cause.” Six said and knew we were almost finished with the scene.\n\nI wished I had a larger crew to work on scenes like this. The Numbered Agents worked hard even if they didn’t fully know the job yet. Each of them learned quickly. Six seemed to pick up what to do the fastest and spoke the most. He acted very friendly and didn’t wear the sunglasses all of his brothers did. His eyes a blue, but so dull they looked like they should belong to a dead man. Even with unnerving eyes, I liked talking with him.\n\n“Are you alright with that? I mean, you don’t sound angry that they’ve killed your co-workers. And maybe some of your brothers. Shouldn’t you be kind of upset a little about the fact they hunt you down even though you’re working to save humans from creatures?” I said and helped him start to pack up our gear.\n\nHe thought about the questions for a few moments. He shook his head, his soft expression never fading. Six wasn’t as stern as his brothers. I wondered why that was but didn’t ask.\n\n“No, I get it. The Hunters formed because they hate creatures. Some creatures hunt for food. Others for fun. And others because they can. It's impossible for humans to only kill the ones who hunt for food. And it’s impossible for creatures to only eat bad humans. Even bad humans have people who care about them. The Hunters decided to try and kill all of the supernatural creatures because they don’t see any of us as equal. I don’t agree with that outlook, but I understand it.” Six said and he never lost his kind tone.\n\nI’ve tried to think about all of that since I found out about the whole monsters-eating humans' thing. It really seemed like there was no fully moral option for both sides. Monsters needed to eat but there weren’t enough murderers and other violent criminals to support their populations. And I knew the legal system didn’t get it right all the time. Supernatural creatures might eat someone innocent locked away for a murder they didn’t commit.\n\nI bet that no matter how hard they tried, The Hunters would never be able to kill a Dark God like the one who caused the clipped body cases. I was lost in thought when Six spoke up.\n\n“You’re living with Jackalope, right?” He said out of the blue.\n\nI knew Jackalope had been an Agent but didn’t know who he worked with in the past. I nodded and Six went on.\n\n“We’ve done a few jobs. He always treated me nicely. How has he been doing? Is he smiling a lot?” The Agent asked and I felt a small pain of guilt in my chest.\n\nJackalope hadn’t been smiling that much lately. He forced one on his face when he saw I was looking in his direction. I was the cause of that. The trauma of what that God did to him had yet to fade. I doubted he would ever fully heal. I wanted to lie to Six but figured it was best to admit how my friend was doing.\n\n“No. Not as often.” I admitted.\n\nFor some reason, Six smiled at the answer.\n\n“I think that’s alright. Jackalope did it a lot for work as smiling was a tool. I’d hoped that he would feel comfortable enough to show some different expressions someday.”\n\nI never considered that. Jackalope was a bit of a different person when we met. He acted more subdued after he moved in, and I just assumed that was because of what happened. It was possible he no longer felt pressured to keep a certain act up. I considered talking to him about this, but much later after he got more settled in.\n\nJust as we finished cleaning up, Six got a call asking for him to go on a job. I was free to go for the day. He thanked me for the help, and I thanked him for what information he gave that day. Most of the time the emails for the jobs listed what Agent I may be working with. I decided I wanted to work with Six more even if that meant accepting lower-paid jobs. I could always take the bigger paydays after I talked with him a bit more.\n\nI told him to be careful on his next job which caused Six to give me an odd look. I wondered if that had been the first time someone ever said those words to him. I really needed to start treating these Agents nicer. Their lives seemed pretty terrible from what I’d seen so far.\n\nWhen I got home, I got changed right away and went into the shower. The smell of all those dead creatures stuck to my clothing. Since I started working in the field, I bought cheaper clothing that could be thrown out if the smells couldn’t be washed out. The outfit for today had a few more jobs in them.\n\nWhile I was in the shower Jackalope came home. He normally checked up on Pesto and then got started making dinner when he finished work. To be honest, I tended to order food in rather than cook. Or I just skipped meals depending on how bad the scene smelled that day. I already gained a little bit of weight since Jackalope moved in. I never noticed how thin I’d been until I started to look healthier in the mirror.\n\nI stood in the doorway watching him work away. I’ve offered to help but he refused saying he liked cooking. And I usually messed up dinner so badly it’s a miracle I hadn’t burned down the house yet.\n\n“I worked with Six today. He asked about you.” I told him, forgetting that I’d been the one to give the Agent a nickname.\n\nJackalope paused to look over his shoulder trying to place who I’d been talking about. He knew Six was a Numbered Agent but wasn’t certain which one.\n\n“Uh, ten thousand and six.” I corrected myself.\n\nHis expression cleared with a smile. The small grin was not the same kind of emotion I’d seen from him when he first sat on my couch. He no longer acted like an Agent, but sometimes I still saw traces of the person he’d been forced to be.\n\n“He’s one of the youngest Numbered Agents. We only worked together a handful of times. I’m surprised he remembered me. What did he want to know?” Jackalope asked and turned back to making dinner.\n\nHe’d found the knife sharpener buried under other kitchen wear I neglected to organize after my mother passed away. With a sharp blade, he didn’t need to hold onto the vegetables to be able to cut them. But he tended to dice food slowly and unevenly, which was to be expected.\n\n“He wanted to know if you’re still smiling.” I said deciding not to lie to him.\n\n“And what did you say?” He asked back not pausing in his work.\n\n“I told him the truth. You are, but not as often. He liked that.”\n\nMy new roommate stopped cutting the vegetables for a few seconds. He turned the words around in his head. When he started back up dicing, I could tell he liked the answer. He'd been worried about how other Agents thought of him after he got fired. They might not all be friends but on jobs, they needed to rely on each other. All of them wanted respect from their co-workers. I never thought about how much the idea of the other Agents not respecting Jackalope could upset him. He did his best to hide his worries and wasn’t the kind of person to ever talk about what ate away at him.\n\nHe protected a human and paid a heavy price because of it. If anyone thought less of him for his actions, then he didn’t need to care about anything that kind of person might have to say.\n\nI didn’t feel very hungry that night because of what I needed to deal with during the day. Somehow Jackalope tricked me into eating something before going to bed. I packed up the leftovers for lunch the next day. If I did a tamer scene, I would be able to take a break and eat. If it was a bad scene, then I would give my lunch to the Agent I worked with that day. I quickly found out all of them liked free food but loved Jackalope’s cooking more. A few of them may get jealous over the fact I wanted to work with Six more often now.\n\nThe next day I got an email near noon asking to cover a scene at a campground. I saw Six’s number and accepted. I found myself in the middle of the woods with the Agent within the hour. The job description was fairly vague about the details. Six helped unload the gear but wasn’t going to help document the scene that day. Instead, he stood watch. His dull eyes trained on the woods and hand on a small dagger at his waist. The air tense between us. I still risked speaking as I got started working, careful not to disturb the trash around the small campsite we arrived at.\n\n“What’s up with this job? I don’t know much about it.” I said while taking note of the smaller details so as not to miss anything.\n\nThe firepit was still fresh. Maybe only a few hours old. I bet if I dug around some embers still remained. The tent had been torn apart with some blood staining the edges. The camper’s items were scattered everything. Most of it was damaged. If I didn’t know better, I would say this was some sort of animal attack. The torn tent looked to be ruined by claws. For some reason. Bits of trash littered around the scene. I didn’t know the debris had been here when they set up camp, or they were just very messy.\n\n“Some campers heard a scream in the middle of the night. They were half asleep and only remembered it in the morning. They came by this camp and saw all of this. They called the rangers, who called the police.” Six explained sounding oddly serious compared to yesterday.\n\n“I’ll need to record what shoes everyone who came by this scene was wearing and where they stepped,” I told him, wondering what kind of mess we walked into.\n\n“Already requested. We have some detectives working for us on cases like these. They can help gather evidence and do interviews with suspects.”\n\nThat answer brought up more questions. It felt like nowadays I was just always asking for more information. I really lacked enough knowledge of the supernatural world and how The Corporation functioned.\n\n“Did the police call you guys to take over once they knew this wasn’t a natural case?” I pressed.\n\nA wind blew causing a scrap of tarp caught in a nearby tree to wave. The sound made me jump. I thought it was something watching us. Documenting all this trash was going to be annoying. But necessary. You never knew what may be important to a case and needed to record everything.\n\n“No, they’re mad we took it over and kicked them out of the woods. There was another set of campers that disappeared two weeks ago. No bodies were ever found. The Corporation keeps an eye on all recorded cases and will only send out Agents if there is a high chance of something supernatural being the culprit. There are far too many cases for the current amount of Agents to deal with.” Six admitted.\n\nHe kept looking around in the trees as if expecting something to jump out. His gripe was so tight on his weapon, his knuckles turned white. Aside from those small signs, he didn’t show how stressed he felt. I wondered what about this case made them certain some sort of creature had been behind it to act so quickly. I didn’t know how long the police started to investigate the woods before they were removed. As far as I could tell, this didn’t stand out as too odd of a death. I then didn’t like the idea of seeing two people disappearing in the middle of the night assumed dead as a minor case. These were people and I started to act as if it wasn’t too big of a deal. I’ve been working a bit too much lately.\n\n“What about this stands out? I’ll need to know what kind of supernatural things to look for in future cases.” I said to the tense Agent.\n\n“There is a mixture of a lot of things. No bodies normally mean they were eaten. Forests tend to be a hunting ground for a lot of different creatures.” He replied.\n\nHe started walking a little to try to ease some stress. Six moved very carefully not to disturb the scene in areas I hadn’t fully recorded yet. If a candy wrapper blew in front of his path, he very carefully stepped over it. I really wanted a crew for this. More people could cover the area faster, and I risked missing something. Plus, I couldn’t control the wind or other elements that may disturb evidence before I got to it.\n\n“Do creatures hunt in the woods because it’s easier to hide from humans?” I asked still working away.\n\nSix nodded without stopping his pacing fearing he may step on some evidence. The wind started to pick up kicking around leaves and other items. At least the campsite was relatively enclosed so the litter couldn’t get very far.\n\n“That, and a few other reasons. They’re attracted to the magic that leaks from living creatures. A forest has plants, animals, and insects, so more magic than a city. But some creatures are attracted to cities to hunt regardless of if it’s riskier or not.”\n\nMagic? I paused working to turn that word over in my head. Of course, there was magic. How else did that God stick people into objects? For some reason, I never really thought about it until that point. Somehow, I saw a short man with rabbit features as something natural. Magic explained everything odd I’d come across and yet my brain didn’t want to believe it was real. That was another topic I needed to ask about.\n\n“Uh, living creatures have magic? Even natural ones?” I pestered.\n\nIt was hard getting all of this straight into my head as well as documenting the scene. If this turned out to be a supernatural creature, then I needed to know as much as possible. Knowledge normally leads to more evidence getting discovered while in the field.\n\n“Yes. But it’s a very small amount. Most say humans don’t have any internal magic because you can’t use the power most of the time. And it’s such a small amount it barely counts.” Six started to explain.\n\n“How small are we talking about?”\n\nHe stopped walking to gather his thoughts. He crossed his arms for a few seconds to figure out an example that may work.\n\n“Let’s use stars in the sky. A human may have one star. Five or ten at the most. I’m a fairly weak creature, but I still would have at least five thousand stars worth of magic.” He explained.\n\nI considered the difference in power level between us. I wasn’t really aware of what magic could do, but it was clear that the more of it was better. There was such a vast difference between us even though Six admitted to being weak. If a tree had the same amount of magic as a human, I understood why creatures would be drawn to the woods. Hell, even if every insect had half the amount of magic that humans possessed, then it still added up to a massive amount inside any forest.\n\n“What about Lupa? How much does he have? And... What’s the strongest creature out there? I assume Gods should be loaded.”\n\nSix gave a smile at my question. As nervous as he felt about us being in the woods with the possibility of some sort of monster lurking around, he was glad for the conversation as a distraction.\n\n“Lupa is pretty strong. All the office directors are. He may be somewhere between five hundred thousand stars, and near to a million. The difference between his strength and my own is massive. Gods are nearly impossible to fully understand their powers to gauge it. And for the strongest creature... That would be The Silver King. His strength would be equal to every star in the sky that has ever existed and shall ever come into existence. That magic is endless and we all owe our lives to him. Since you’re human, you'll never truly understand how much creatures of the night love and fear him.” He said, his tone was very hard to read.\n\nThe expression on the Agent’s face froze the blood in my veins. Out there somewhere was a monster that went beyond the Dark God that took a part of Jackalope. What I experienced trying to answer a simple question was nothing compared to what ruled over the entire supernatural world. I prayed I was too far beneath the King’s notice for us to ever come into contact.\n\nThe sound of the tarp blowing against a tree drew my attention over to it. Six tensed again. His hand was ready to draw his weapon. I wished I had a gun, or something to protect myself. When I started working, I was given a windbreaker with some forms to sign. It had a simple CSI on the back and nothing else. I was told that the jacket held some protective power, but not much. Since I would be working with Agents, the Corporation didn’t want to waste resources on a more powerful jacket when I sort of have bodyguards. I trusted Six to do his best if something came out of the woods. But I found myself worrying about him.\n\nHe did appear to be an adult, but the longer I looked at him the younger he looked.\n\n“Six... how old are you?” I wasn’t sure why I asked such a question.\n\nHe was confused over the question. At first, I thought I asked something too personal. It soon became clear he was just thinking hard about the answer as if he really didn’t know.\n\n“I think this is going to be my third summer. The Numbered Agents are born as... something not human. We’re placed inside a deceased human body and fuse together with it. I’ve gained some memories of the one I took over, but only general things. I don’t know whose body this was, and I haven’t experienced most of what I know.”\n\nI stared over at him shocked he was only three years old. It didn't feel real. I understood what he was saying but didn’t want to accept it. Six was too damn young to be out here fighting monsters and trying to act like an adult. I dreaded the idea that he had been working as an agent for all three of those years. Seriously, what was up with their world? Did he not have a childhood at all? I stopped working long enough for him to notice. I forced myself to go back to documenting and bagging items, but my thoughts tore into my heart. Did Jackalope go through the same thing? He wasn’t a Numbered Agent so not a part of their family. But I guessed his life was the same as theirs. He may have just started working the moment he was able.\n\nA sound much like a twig snapping came from the woods. I shot up to look around as Six pulled the dagger from his belt. I watched in shock as he flipped the dagger in his hand and the blade shifted into a revolver in the middle of the swift movement. I was still new at seeing magic in motion. Even something as small as a weapon changing was a bit amazing to me.\n\nHe held the gun up, ready to fire. When he didn’t see or hear anything, he let his hand drop to his side and finger off the trigger.  \n\n“Neat magic dagger.” I commented after my heart slowed down a little.\n\n“The bullets are weaker than the magic that gets torn into the target if you stab it. But it’s useful to both have a long-range and short-range weapon.” Six admitted with a nervous smile.\n\nI half listened to what he was saying. Something in the trees caught my attention and I focused on it. The human brain has a trait for seeing faces or objects in random patterns. Like seeing a cloud as some sort of animal, or the face of Jesus on burnt toast. I’ve heard the theory it’s helped our ancestors by them assuming every tree branch in the grass is a snake because sometimes, it is a snake that could kill them.\n\nWhen I arrived at the campsite, I thought I saw the tarp as something it was not. A body of some sort of animal hiding behind the trees. As I looked up at the leaves, an odd image caught my eye. At first, I thought the bark of the tree looked like half a face staring down at us. Because I stared at it for so long trying to convince my brain it was nothing, I saw the creature before Six. He looked in the same direction but didn’t notice the same thing I had.\n\nThe monster realized I was staring right at it. The half-face in the trees moved and I shouted at Six that something was coming our way. He flew into action no longer caring about stepping over the crime scene. Our lives were more important than evidence. He raised his gun but wasn’t able to get a clear line of sight until it was too late.\n\nThe thing came from the trees, body making so many sounds as it came down on us. The same sounds we’ve been hearing since we got here. I was pushed out of the way at the last second as the monster wrapped a massive body around my Agent friend before he got a shot off. His gun getting tossed from his hand as he was slammed against a tree so hard, I heard bones snapping. I shouted out his name and that got the creatures' attention. That gruesome face turned in my direction causing me to stop breathing from fear.\n\nThe monster’s head was made up of four parts of human faces stretched and melded together. The open mouths made up the eyes, and the mouth was just an open hinge. The teeth made up of broken glass, bones, and twigs. The blue tarp made up most of the long body. The thing was very much like a centipede made up of a mixture of trash, and plant matter of the rest of the human victims it claimed. Four human ribcages hung from the tarp, some with still-fresh blood clinging to the bones. The smell of rot became overpowering when the direction of the wind changed.\n\nI became so frozen in fear I couldn’t move. The monster came down, but I got saved yet again by Six who shoulder-checked the creature out of the way. It let out an ungodly screech as it rolled along the ground. The body picked up the pieces of trash as it rolled. Any damage Six could do would be recovered by the amount of garbage around us. I looked for his weapon. I spotted it far too late.\n\nArms took hold of the Agent. Each arm is either from the humans it killed or made of pieces of solid trash. He forced down a cry of pain refusing to let me hear how much trouble he was in.\n\n“Carlos, run!” Six shouted, his voice cracking.\n\nI froze yet again unsure of what to do. I couldn’t do anything to help. And yet I refused to let another person get hurt to save my life. Six struggled the best he could. His face started to change into something inhuman. The skin on his hands burst to show a white set of claws underneath. With strength I didn’t think he had; he tore through the hands keeping him captive.\n\nThe trash monster screamed in four voices at once. A set of large claws broke through Six’s shoes. His legs now look much like a set that should belong to an insect. His mouth went from ear to ear, and his eyes were now large and dark. I dove for his gun, feeling the cold metal in my hand. I should have made a run for it, but I wasn’t thinking properly at that moment.\n\nAt first, it seemed like Six gained the upper hand with his new transformation. He jumped and caught the creature along the side. His claws tore through, spilling out litter from the body. He landed on his feet ready for another attack. I shouted out a warning at the same time another set of powerful hands grab at him. They tore through his chest, and I helplessly watched.\n\nI raised the gun and fired. It caught the creature in the face but didn’t do that much damage. The recoil of the gun hurt my hands like hell. For a small weapon, it should not have hurt that much. I refused to drop it. The monster tossed Six aside and came down on me. The thing caught my leg, lifting my body to slam my back against a tree stunning me for a few seconds. My eyes flood with tears from the pain. The jacket protected my ribs from being broken, but I felt a snap coming from my ankle.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes again, I was face to face with countless lines of teeth. All of them were ready to come down on my head. I searched through my mind trying to think of what to do. The gun would not do enough damage to kill this monster and I didn’t know how to switch it back to the dagger.\n\nInstinct guided my hand. Along with something else. I wasn’t aware of it, but the forest wanted this creature dead. It was ready to offer up power to do so but couldn’t act on its own. If my will faltered even in the slightest, that power would have been blown back into my face killing me regardless of if this creature ate me or not. A force surged at my back. A warm encouraging feeling joined with my single purpose. I did want to live, but I wanted to protect Six even more.\n\nWithout thinking, I shoved my arm into the monster's mouth. The teeth cut my bare hand holding the gun. I took a breath and fired the gun once. A burst of power that was not my own came from the weapon, tearing through the body from the inside. A pale green light exploded outwards, destroying most of the creature’s body besides some parts of the humans it took. I collapsed, my hand bleeding like crazy and shaking. Waves of pain came from my ankle, but I ignored the feeling to stand up.\n\nI stumbled over to Six and got beside him. Blood poured from his chest and his breathing was raspy. I almost broke down. It was hard to fight through all the emotions to dig through his suit pockets to find his phone to call for help. I don’t know how long we stayed there for. It may have only been a few minutes. I took a hold of his hand refusing to leave him.\n\n“Hey Kiddo, you’ll be right. Help is on the way, you’ll be fine.” I said, my voice barely a whisper.\n\nI don’t know if he could hear my words. The blood-stained his pale face and white shirt. Finally, others showed up to collect us. It took a lot for them to separate us. In a blur of motion, I found us inside a hospital, and they needed to pry my hand from his to take me into a different room to be treated.\n\nMy injuries were mild. Since I now worked for a supernatural company, they had ways of healing wounds faster than normal. My hand and ankle were wrapped in some bandages I was told to leave on for three days. I also was ordered to stay off my foot, which I immediately refused to do so. I paced outside my room demanding to know how Six was doing. I wanted to be right with him the moment he woke up. I wasn’t even aware of how I looked. My front was covered in both of our blood, and my clothing covered in dirt from the fight. because I refused to listen to anyone, they brought in the big guns to get me to go home.\n\nA short man came down the hallway, his soft paws silently walking across the floor. He stopped in front of me, but I still refused to stop moving. It felt like if I stood still, Six would die.\n\n“The Agent is alive. He'll recover but we are unsure of his future with the Corporation.” Lupa spoke in an even tone.\n\nRage flared through my body. He stormed over to him and took his collar in my hand. I knew he was far more powerful than myself, and yet I didn’t care.\n\n“Why was it just us out there?! Six could have died! You should have had another Agent just in case-”\n\n“We do not have enough Agents for just-in-case situations.” Lupa cut into my rant before I got too far.  \n\nThat simple fact deflated my anger. I suddenly felt drained and needed to sit down. I slowly sank to my knees, feeling dizzy and sick. To his credit, Lupa didn’t comment on my weakness.\n\n“Take some time off to recover, and to decide if this job is suited for you.” The man said sternly.\n\nHe turned on his heel and left me alone in the hallway debating all my choices so far.\n\nSome kind staff members took me home. I was in such a state of shock I didn’t know what to do the moment I walked through the front door. My eyes fell to the shoe rack because a certain color caught my eye. Jackalope's work shoes sat on top of a plastic bag covered in blood. Panic rose through me, and I charged into the living room to find him sitting on the floor watching Pesto hop about. The bottom of his pant legs stained with blood, but he was uninjured. His face flew into the same panic as I felt when he saw my clothing covered in a deep red.\n\n“It’s... not mine.” I croaked out trying to calm him down.\n\nThat relaxed him enough to pause getting up from the floor. I sat next to him, still too much in shock to do anything else. Jackalope was an Agent. He knew days like this happened.\n\n“Your shoes...” I started unsure of how to ask what happened to him that day.\n\n“Delivering mail to monsters gets... messy some days. It’s fine.” He said but sounded exhausted.\n\nI did a double take over what he said. Which made him give me a strange look.\n\n“Monsters?” I asked slowly.\n\nI knew he got a job delivering mail but didn’t know he dealt with monsters. The more I thought about it the more sense it made.\n\n“I told you they fixed my eyesight. Did you think that was done through regular means with no recovery time?” He answered in a light voice.\n\n“Wel... UPS or FedEx is a big company. I thought maybe...” I started trying to defend myself.\n\n“Carlos...” Jackalope said gently.\n\nI found myself blushing from embarrassment. This entire time I assumed he worked with humans. At least he was kind enough not to laugh over my mistake.\n\n“We’ll buy you new shoes tomorrow. Is there anything else you need?” I said quickly, trying to change the topic.\n\nHe knew not to ask me about my day. I would tell him when I felt ready, and he would do the same. He thought for a while and finally looked over sounding like a child asking for an expensive Christmas gift.\n\n“Can we... Get a friend for Pesto? I know it’s a lot to ask for another animal, but I feel bad he’s alone all day while we’re at work.”\n\nI don’t know what kind of horrors he saw that day, and yet he was worried about a rabbit. I smiled which I didn’t think I had the expression me that day.\n\n“We’ll look into it. I want to make sure we know how to introduce a new rabbit and if Pesto wants a friend.” I told him.\n\nWhen I was a child, we had a few cats. I knew that some animals you couldn’t just toss together and expected everything to be fine. I didn't want to put Pesto into a stressful situation when we just wanted to do what was best for him. Jackalope nodded in agreement, his smile something I was glad to see after the day I went through. We sat for a long time trying to process what happened. It wasn’t just our jobs, but everything we’d been through in such a short amount of time. He shifted trying to get comfortable and his hand brushed against mine. On reflex, I took it.\n\n“We’re still here.” I told him unaware of why I felt the need to say it.\n\nHe nodded, needing to hear those words. After everything, we were still there. And that’s all that mattered at the end of days like this. He didn’t force me to eat something that night. I showered and tossed my clothing out. He did the same after me and we both went to bed early unsure if we could even sleep that night.\n\nI hated being in the dark after encountering that God. But I felt as if I slept with a light on, that would be letting him win. I tossed in bed, feeling far too cold under my blankets. I refused to open my eyes to look out into my dark bedroom fearing I may see something staring back at me. I think I slept for a few hours. The exhaustion finally caught up to me. When I woke up, I felt even more tired than when I drifted off to sleep. A soft sound of footsteps came from the hallway making me sit up in bed. I thought I had closed my door and yet I saw a figure walking down the hallway to stop just before my door. I wasn’t scared because I recognized the silhouette.\n\n“Jackalope...? What’s wrong? Having issues sleeping?” I asked in a tired voice.\n\nHis form appeared black from the small amount of light coming from his open door. Since he moved in. He hadn’t once gotten out of bed after dark. Seeing him at my door was strange.\n\n“Can I sleep with you?” The voice came from the figure.\n\nIt sounded like Jackalope, but fear tore through my blood. This wasn’t him. I was either having a nightmare, or something else got into my house. The shape noticed I knew something wasn’t right. Two blue flames appeared as eyes in the dark. The figure started to make a run towards my bed, the footsteps heavy with laughter that mixed in. I launched myself towards my bedside table and flicked on my lamp. The light covered the room and the moment it turned on, the figure disappeared as if it was never there. Breathing heavily, I scanned the room. I then flew out of bed to turn on every light in the house. Jackalope somehow slept through the entire event. There wasn’t any way I could go back to bed after what I saw. My theory was that Dark God wasn’t done with us yet.\n\nI could have rented a room somewhere for us, but I assumed a God could follow us anywhere. Until I could get a hold of someone in The Corporation to help, I decided there was no harm in keeping the lights on at night.",

        "text": "[\\[Part 1\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/116md9g/stay_away_from_tauerpin_road_part_1/)\n\nI must admit, I thought it would be difficult to make myself relive the terrible night that changed my life forever, but after posting the first segment, I realized how wrong I was.\n\nThis isn’t difficult . . . it’s excruciating.\n\nThe memories hurt, they sear my emotions and tear my soul, yet I know I have to go on to gain some form of closure. The world has to know what happened.\n\nMark and I walked for the better part of ten minutes, before a tall, bulky shape loomed out of the blackness. At first I recoiled, thinking it was the creature, but Mark shone his flashlight at it and revealed a rusty collection drum, the kind used by oil derricks in our rural area for decades. This one appeared to be derelict, and when Mark climbed the rickety metal steps to tug open the top hatch, it confirmed my suspicions.\n\n“Come on. It’s drier inside.” He swept his red flashlight beam over the nearby trees, as if to scan for anyone following us.\n\nI stuck my feet into the tank and found another ladder hidden just beneath the rim of the hatch. Mark climbed down after me and swung the hatch shut, sliding a thick metal pipe in place as a sort of deadbolt.\n\nThe soft *click* of a lighter hissed through the dark, and the room filled with cheerful yellow light.\n\nAcross from the ladder, a dented kerosene lantern sat atop a dusty old folding table, the tiny golden flame contained in its glass orb. Under my feet, the floor lay covered in sections of broken wood pallets, with the metal base of the oil drum still coated in a sheen of congealed grease beneath them. The air smelled of wood rot, crude oil, and mildew, with the dull staccato of rain drumming on the outside of our little steel fortress all the while. Crates and various cardboard boxes were stacked against the curved walls of the oil tank, and against one side there stood a ragged cot, with a few wool blankets scattered over it. On the cot I noticed a newer looking gray rucksack, a green canvas shoulder bag, and a red nylon duffel bag.\n\nMark flicked his flashlight off and set it on the table. Now that I could see him better, he looked even worse, his clothes torn in places, both boots caked in mud. A half-dozen black smeary handprints dotted his jacket sleeves, and something told me they weren’t his. He had a well-worn twelve-gauge shotgun slung over one shoulder, another flashlight duct-taped to its wooden foregrip, and an old-fashioned baseball bat hung from a crude sling on his back, its wood grain coated in more of the strange stuff from his coat.\n\nHe turned to me, and Mark’s eyes took in my pitiful appearance. “You okay?”\n\n*How am I supposed to answer that?*\n\nIn some ways, I felt numb, too rattled by what had just happened to think. But I knew if my father were here, he’d want me to be brave, and I couldn’t let my nerves get the best of me now.\n\n“I’m fine, I think. Just cold.”\n\nMark draped his coat over my shoulders and slipped one hand under my chin to examine my face. “Well, looks like you lucked out. You got splattered pretty good, but it doesn’t look like the Puppet got it’s claws into you.”\n\nI frowned as he guided me to the cot and sat me down. “Puppet?”\n\n“Uh huh.” Mark’s expression darkened somewhat, and he rummaged through his rucksack to produce a small packet of wet wipes. “The ones that look like people. We call them Puppets, cause the Big One uses them like hunting dogs to track you down.”\n\n*What the . . .*\n\nMy stare must have unnerved him, because Mark sighed, and carefully dabbed at my face with a wipe. “It’s a long story. I *told* you to stay away, Maddie. Why didn’t you listen to me?”\n\nIndignant, I crossed my arms over my soggy shirt. “I tried. A bunch of poles fell and blocked the road, then Kendra appeared out of nowhere and that thing grabbed her.”\n\n“So you just ran in?”\n\nI narrowed my eyes, annoyed at his critical tone, and how much it reminded me of my father’s numerous security lectures. “I wanted to save my friend.”\n\n“Except she was never there.” Mark held up the wet wipe so I could see what he’d cleaned off my face in the lamplight.\n\nEven after all the strange events of the night thus far, I’d half expected to see dark red blood. Instead, I blinked in confusion at black, algae-like sludge, mixed with what looked like bits of wood splinters.\n\n“Is that . . .”\n\n“Yep.” Mark nodded and continued to check me over like some army medic from his old unit. “That’s what came out of her head. They’re not flesh and bone like you and me. The Puppets are made from rot and wood by the Big One, so they bleed black, not red. That’s one way of knowing if they’re real or not.”\n\n*Her teeth . . . they were wooden. Like the rest of her. How is that possible?*\n\n“I don’t understand.” Horrified, I looked down at my palms, scraped, bleeding and muddy, and remembered how Kendra’s skin felt hard under my fists. “She . . . she looked so real.”\n\nMark handed me a small brown towel so I could dry my semi-frozen limbs off. “They all do. Was Kendra with you? The real Kendra?”\n\n“No.” I patted myself down, grateful to feel some of the heat return to my fingers. “I just looked up and . . .”\n\n*. . . and she never said a word.*\n\nAll at once, the events clicked together in my mind like puzzle pieces, and I sat up straight. Kendra hadn’t said a thing, only made a scream, one any frightened girl could make, and one easy to replicate without risk of being discovered. She hadn’t run over to my car at my invitation like any normal person would. She hadn’t called my name.\n\nBecause that *thing* wasn’t Kendra.\n\nMark caught my stunned, opened mouthed gasp, and his eyes moved to the hatch overhead, as if to check for signs of someone listening in. “She was a lure, meant to get you deeper in, before the trap was sprung. The Big One models all the Puppets off of real-life people, whatever it sees, or catches. Somehow it knew what Kendra looked like and made her to trick you.”\n\n*The pictures on my phone . . . it could see them from the trees.*\n\nAnother sinister thought ran through my mind as I watched Mark kneel in front of me to inspect my bruised shins. Kendra had looked so real. Mark looked real now. Real, and surprisingly calm.\n\n“So . . . what are you doing in here?” I tried to avoid looking at him, afraid of what I might see.\n\n“My job.” Mark nudged the shotgun over his shoulder with one elbow, still focused on checking me for wounds. “Hunting the Big One. I found another entrance near Bethesda Ridge and dropped my gear off here before going out to scout for a good ambush point. I set up a little blind near the road, then spotted your flashlight. Thought you were a Puppet at first, but the other one tackled you, which saved you from getting your brains battered out. Just goes to show, you never know if someone’s real until they’re close.”\n\nI edged backward on the cot, my throat dry. “H-How else can you tell?”\n\nHesitating, Mark frowned, as if remembering something he’d rather forget. “You ask them questions they can’t answer. Puppets imitate whatever knowledge they’re fed, so if they use the wrong voice, or can’t answer very personal questions that only they would know, they’re not real. Usually, the Puppets are smart enough to know though, and once they realize the jig is up, they’ll go for your eyes first.”\n\nBoth of his dark irises rose to meet mine, and the air stuck in my lungs.\n\nKnowledge rested in those eyes, and he waited for me to react with tense patience. Mark knew that I knew, or rather, didn’t know for sure if he was in fact a walking nightmare disguised as my friend. All I could do now was ask and wait for his eyes to roll back into his head, and his teeth to turn into pegs.\n\n*I can’t turn my back on him without being sure.*\n\n“So,” I balled one fist under the coat he’d put over my shoulders, ready to smash his face in the second Mark lunged for me. “What’s my favorite color?”\n\nThunder rolled outside, the wind howled, the trees creaked. Neither of us moved a muscle, both staring at the other.\n\nMark’s eyes searched my face, and I clenched my fist tighter, ready to swing with all my might.\n\n“Teal.” He spoke the words like they were honey on his lips, and let slide a fond, whimsical smile. “Like the necklace your grandma got you for your fifteenth birthday. Now, are you gonna break my nose, Maddie?”\n\n*Thank God for those long conversations.*\n\nMy face boiled with embarrassed heat, and I unclenched my fist to make a sheepish rub at my black-and-blue shin. “Sorry, I just . . . I had to be sure.”\n\n“Don’t be sorry.” Mark tinged crimson and tossed the filthy wipe into a gap in the crude pallet floor. “I hated pulling a knife on you like that, but I didn’t have a choice. Like you said, it’s best to be sure.”\n\nRelieved enough to be curious, I dared to shift to a more comfortable spot on the blankets and let my mind work. “So, what is this place? Why are those things out there?”\n\nHe rose to his feet and pointed to the green canvas bag next to me on the cot. “Get dressed, and I’ll explain as we go. Everything in there should be dry, though you might have to mix-and-match to get a good fit. After all, I’m not exactly built like you.”\n\n*As we’ve both noticed.*\n\nThe last bit came with a characteristic toothy grin from Mark that made me flush, and he crossed to the other side of the cramped room, to turn away from me.\n\nI left my wet bra and panties on, what with Mark being only six feet away at most, and with my scrambled brain still not sure about our friendship. His spare t-shirt fit somewhat snuggly, and I pulled a hooded flannel jacket over it to avoid hearing my mother’s stern rebuke in my head about what kind of man I wanted to attract, the good, or the temporary. Luckily the extra set of fleece-lined camouflage pants in the bag were loose enough that they weren’t “painted on”, though I doubted they were baggy enough to have passed inspection. Regardless of the ill-fit, it felt great to be back in warm, dry clothes, though they smelled like Mark’s rustic cologne, something that made me both nervous, and shy all at once.\n\n*For pete’s sake, they’re just clothes. Get out of your head, this isn’t the place, or the time for being flakey.*\n\nWhile I hurried to dress, Mark stood with both hands in his pockets, face to the wall. “Last year, Randy took me out to the Falconry Station during a stormy night and warned me about Tauerpin Road. Of course I didn’t believe him, and when I spotted it on my fifth week, I went in like a moron. Luckily for me, he knew I was curious, and came to get me. I guess it’s been around since the 80’s, when the land was given to the park by the old coal mining company that had it before. No one knows where it came from, or how it got here but . . . well, here it is.”\n\n“How come you guys didn’t let everyone else know?” I slid on a fresh pair of wool socks and wiggled my toes in pleasure at how soft they were on my cold feet. “You know, put up signs, roadblocks?”\n\n“It’s not that simple.” Mark didn’t risk turning to check and see if I was ready yet but picked at some paint on the wall with his fingernail instead. I’d forgotten what a gentleman he could be, and it both made me smile, and wince at the same time. “It’s not a regular road, Maddie, not one you can just find whenever you want to. It’s . . . how did Randy put it? It’s like a door between our reality, and somewhere else. A waypoint I think he called it. Somehow, certain powerful storms can activate it, and open the road. Anyone or anything that goes in gets lost in the labyrinth, and usually ends up as lunch for one of the critters in here. From what he told me, the Big One gets a lot of the people.”\n\nI shivered and remembered how the huge gray figure lurched through the trees with its whale-call roars. “What are they?”\n\nMark stayed quiet for a moment, and he scraped at the makeshift wooden floor with the toe of his boot. “No one knows. Randy thinks they’re aliens, but I don’t buy it. There are all kinds of things left behind in here, cars, trucks, clothes, gear . . . all without any trace of their owners. I think the Big One changed them, made them into Puppets to use like bait to catch more people. But there’s more things in here than just them. I’ve seen deer without skin on their skulls, bears with armor plates made of bone, and flowers that can shoot poisonous needles. All of them will rip you to shreds in ten seconds flat, and if you don’t make it out by morning, you’ll end up just like them. That’s what happened to the guy who built this dump.”\n\n“How do you know?” I swallowed hard and finished lacing up one grimy tennis shoe.\n\nAt that, Mark finally did risk a glance back my way and turned red as a tomato to see me fully clothed.\n\nOur eyes locked, and a shudder ran down my back, not cold but warm, tingly and pleasant.\n\n*He does have really nice eyes, kinda like chocolate—jeez Madison, would you stop?*\n\nTerrified of the war within myself, I dropped my gaze back to my shoes, and made a show of tying the other one.\n\nMark jerked his head toward a lone, empty chair near the rickety table. “Randy found what was left of him propped up right there, with a gun in his hand, and a bullet in his head. His upper half was still human, but from the waist down . . . well, let’s just say he was probably in enough pain that he didn’t feel the shot. I figure he wanted to go out on his own terms.”\n\n“Yuck.” Determined to distract myself, I threw the chair a glance, grateful Mark had sat me down on the cot instead. “So, I take it we can’t just sit here and wait for the storm to pass?”\n\nMark’s grin of approval made him look more like my goofy friend, and less like a weary old man in a young man’s body. “Spot on. This place usually opens up at night, and by sunup, it’s gone again. You can’t just follow the road back out, it doesn’t work that way. We have to find the exit before the sun rises without getting caught and killed. That’s the *easy* part.”\n\n“What’s the hard part?” I stood and craned my head back to try and comb the twigs out of my tangled auburn tresses.\n\nMark’s face drained of color, and he fiddled with the black rubber wristwatch on his arm, as if deep in thought. “Let me worry about it, alright? You just focus on keeping your eyes peeled for anything that isn’t one of us out there.”\n\nHe avoided my eyes this time, and something about it made me feel sick to my stomach. Mark had done that before at the parking lot, kept the whole truth from me to protect me from a nightmare I couldn’t even begin to imagine. I resented being treated like some porcelain doll that couldn’t handle reality, but at the same time, part of me was too afraid to ask for it. My entire world had turned upside-down in less than an hour, and all I wanted was to go home. If that meant Mark never told me the full story of this awful place, maybe that wouldn’t be such a bad trade.\n\n*I’m definitely never staying after dark ever again.*\n\n“Here.” Sorting various items between the gray rucksack and the green canvas bag, Mark handed me a headlamp with a bit of red plastic cellophane taped over the lenses, and a small flashlight without it. “The white light is in case we get attacked, for shooting. The red lights we use to see when we’re trying to be stealthy, emphasis on the word ‘trying’.”\n\n“Won’t they see it?” I eyed the headlamp with doubt.\n\nHe thumbed another green plastic shotgun shell into the receiver of his twelve gauge. “Not as easily. Red light’s harder to see in the dark, and even these things aren’t that good.”\n\nMy fingers caught in a stubborn clump of hair, and I bit back an outburst at my own clumsiness.\n\n“Let me try.” Mark set his gun down, and from the depths of his ruck, he produced a pink polymer hairbrush.\n\nStunned, I opened my mouth to protest, but he stepped behind me, threaded his fingers into my hair, and tarted to untangle each ratty knot with unexpected patience. Something about his touch, so light and careful, made a lovely warmth flow through me from head to toe, and I forgot whatever I would have said to stop him. Stroke by practiced stroke, Mark passed the brush through my hair, its bristles massaging my scalp, and I breathed in a deep, slow sigh of contentment.\n\n*Wow.*\n\n“I’m not pulling too hard, am I?” He asked, as casual as if offering me sugar for my coffee.\n\n“No.” I whispered, glad I faced away from him so that Mark wouldn’t see me blush in pleased confusion. “You’re doing a good job, actually. Where did you learn that?”\n\nMark chuckled, smooth, silky affection lacing his tone. “Claire. She loves it when I brush her hair. This is one of her favorite ones. She gets all silly and drowsy every time, and it’s cute, even if she doesn’t think so.”\n\n*He sounds so happy, like he’s smiling with his words.*\n\nSome of the heat faded from my core, and I closed my eyes at the sick feeling that twisted in its place. This was a privilege reserved for someone else, someone who, unlike me, had chosen to love this man when the opportunity arose, and thus won his adoration in return. Deep in my heart, I knew I shouldn’t be there, I shouldn’t have enjoyed Mark brushing my hair, and I shouldn’t have been feeling so guilty over someone who I only saw as a friend.\n\nWith the memory of my own decision in mind, I pressed my hands to my stomach to stem the churning sensation there, and secretly hated myself for how much I didn’t want him to stop. “Congratulations, by the way. I uh, I never got around to . . .”\n\n“It’s fine, Maddie. I appreciate it anyway.” His words didn’t betray any hurt or pain but held a kindness that only made the guilt harder to bear.\n\nMark tugged my hair into a fairly passable braid and smoothed his palm over it when he was finished in a way that made my pulse flutter. I turned to face him, and we stared at each other wordlessly, the rain drumming on the oil tank in the background, while the wind growled in impotent fury against our rusty sanctuary.\n\n*Don’t say it, don’t say it, don’t say it . . .*\n\n“Do you hate me?” I blurted the words, too late to stop myself.\n\nHis eyes widened, and my brain almost exploded in humiliation and panic.\n\n“What?” Mark cocked his head to one side, a look of confusion and alarm in his brown eyes. “*No*. Maddie, why would I ever hate you?”\n\nMy lungs seemed to constrict, and I dragged my eyes away from his to choke down an anxious breath. “Because I said no.”\n\nAgain, silence cloaked the air, and I waited for a cold response, a damaged grimace, a sad condemnation for bringing up the dreaded past. How could I be this selfish? How could I keep doing this, wounding him, over and over again? What was wrong with me?\n\nA hand rested on my upper arm and made me jump.\n\nI looked up to find him close, staring down into my eyes with a smile that drove some of the ache from my chest. “All the pain in the world was worth gaining you as a friend. I have Claire now, and we’re happy together. That wouldn’t have happened if you hadn’t told me the truth. You mean more to me than you will ever know.”\n\n*I just wish that was enough.*\n\nDeep inside, my heart writhed, and I nodded mainly to keep myself from tearing up. Mark was happy, he was kind, sweet, good, and here I was . . . what was I doing? Having second thoughts? No, that couldn’t be, not now, not like this.\n\nMark pulled his rucksack on and slung the red bag over his shoulders as well. He handed me the green canvas bag and held out a shiny black pistol. “You’ve shot guns before with your dad, right?”\n\nI took the handgun, and weighed its heft in my hand, the stenciled *9mm* on the slide standing out in the lantern light. How long had it been since I’d last gone to the range with Dad? If my memory served right, it had been several months ago. Then again, several months ago I had been simple friends with Mark and didn’t bear the awful weight of my secret guilt every time I saw him. It seemed like a lifetime ago.\n\n“I can shoot.” My throat scratched with the dry words, but I buckled on the black nylon holster that sheathed the gun, and pocketed the two extra magazines Mark slid my way.\n\n“Good.” Mark tucked a long black knife with a green scabbard into my belt and tapped on finger on the baseball bat over his shoulder. “But try to avoid it if you can. Once we let off a shot, everything for miles around will know we’re here, and then it’s game on. Best thing you can do is take a club to them or stick e’m in the throat to stop the screaming. Worst case scenario, conserve your ammo and run like hell.”\n\n“You didn’t run back there.” I tried to make a coy smirk, but it ended up coming across as a shy, thin-lipped smile, as I remembered the blow from his Louisville slugger that had saved my life.\n\nMark’s chocolate brown irises bored into mine, and a cavalier grin crossed his face, despite the cold, the dark, and our horrible situation. “No, I didn’t. Now, stick close. Let’s find that exit and get back to the Admin Building.”\n\nLeaving the solid walls of the hideout felt like pulling against gravity, but I wasn’t about to insist on staying there without Mark. I followed him back into the dense, rainy forest, the hood of his flannel jacket pulled over my head, the beam of my red headlamp trembling over the mucky ground. Strange cries echoed through the woods, some like the bizarre roars of animals, others as macabre near-human wails, and the ground shook with the claps of booming thunder. In between lightning bolts, I could feel the faint footsteps of the Big One in the mud beneath my battered sneakers. There seemed to be no end to the trees, as if the forest had swallowed the road, along with any clearings or fields the daylight might have revealed.\n\n“*Down*.” Mark stopped abruptly, and I almost ran face-first into his rucksack.\n\nI did as he said, dropped to a crouch behind him in the tall grass and froze, moving only my eyes to peer into the dark ahead of us. Try as I might, I couldn’t see anything, the red lights too dim, the rain too heavy, and I didn’t dare speak out of turn, in case I would draw attention to us.\n\n“Up there.” He pointed up into the pine trees around us. “See e’m?”\n\nMy blood turned to ice the instant I tilted my head back.\n\n*Oh man . . .*\n\nThey dangled from every branch, and swayed limp in the wind like dozens of hanged convicts on the end of the executioner’s noose. There were men and women, old people and children, all suspended by thick gray vines that led from the backs of their heads, and up into the treetops. Their hazy white eyes were open, but stared with a blank, empty gaze that made them seem more like life-sized marionets than humans, and their clothes hung in waterlogged rags around them.\n\n“Are those . . ?”\n\nMark stroked the safety on his twelve gauge with caution and leaned close enough to whisper into my ear. “Puppets. All the ones the Big One made to lure other people in before us. I think it stores them here, to recharge or something. See the vines? They’re like . . . like power cords but made of plant stuff.”\n\nSquinting, I could just make out the slight movements of the gray viny cords, how they pulsated like oversized rotted placentas, and pumped god-knows-what into the backs of the Puppets’ skulls. It made my stomach wriggle, but I couldn’t gag for the tension lodged in my mind.\n\n“Come on.” Mark picked at my sleeve, and crept forward with slow, wary steps. “Just stay low, and they won’t even notice we’re here.”\n\n*What?*\n\nI wanted to tell Mark that was the worst idea I’d ever heard of, but he was already five yards ahead of me, and the thought of losing him in the dark was infinitely more terrifying than that cursed forest. Besides, he knew this ground better than I did, and at this rate, if he said to gargle peanut butter while doing a handstand, I’d do it.\n\nWith my cold fingers glued to the pistol he’d given me, I padded after Mark into the horrid cathedral of bodies, while the wind screamed through the pines.\n\nEvery leaf that crumbled under my shoe, every stick that snapped, seemed to echo like a cannon in my anxious ears. Puppets hung at various heights, some three stories up, and some so close I had to duck to crawl under their dirt-encrusted feet. I fought the urge to whirl around to be sure their eyes weren’t trained on me, and matched each step Mark took with meticulous parody. The smell of rot was overwhelming, and I’d never wanted to vomit more than right then. Yet part of me wondered what it would be like to be caught up by those greasy gray vines, to feel the ends burrow into the back of my head, crack open my skull, and plunge deep into the folds of my brain. Would I be alive the entire time? Would I feel every creeping growth, every rip and tear of the invading tendrils, until I became a prisoner in my own mind, with no control over my body? Or would I cease to be me the instant they stabbed into my cerebrum, thrown into black oblivion, never to see the light of day again?\n\n*Crunch.*\n\nOne massive gray leg plummeted through the canopy, and I dove out of the way, bits of broken branches and wet conifer needles tumbling around me.\n\nMark and I backed into the damp trunk of a nearby tree and stared up at the enormous form in mute horror.\n\nThe Big One strode up to the suspended Puppets with indifference to what lay around its bare feet, almost as if it hadn’t spotted us. It didn’t have toes like a human, but weird gnarled twists like root ends that poked out of its foot in every direction. Each massive four-fingered hand had no fingernails, but jagged sprout-like points that grew from the fingertips, and reminded me of twigs on leafless winter trees. I still couldn’t see the face of the colossal menace, the darkness of the rainy night like a cloak to its features.\n\nStopping in the midst of the ‘stored’ Puppets, the Big One slid the odd bundle of vines from its shoulder.\n\nI clamped a hand over my own mouth to stifle a scream.\n\n*Please let this be a bad dream.*\n\nBut the dozens of figures that swung from the ends of all the strands were no dream. They grinned, wriggled, and waved to each other like kids on an amusement park ride, their milk-white eyes glowing in the dark. One by one, the gray giant plucked the individual Puppets from the bundle and strung them up in the trees, the slimy vines snaking around their necks and burrowing into the backs of their wooden skulls. The Puppets’ eyes dimmed, the smiles faded, and their dense limbs went limp, a mutated nursery filled with mindless sleeping children.\n\nThe Big One held up the last Puppet in its gargantuan palm and poked at it with an almost confused manner. From the ground, I could see the familiar shock of brown hair, along with the Puppet’s half-mutilated wooden head. Low baleen coos rumbled from the Big One, and for some reason, they reminded me of a sad murmur, as if the monstrosity couldn’t understand why such a thing had been done to its creation.\n\nMark’s tap on my shoulder sent a river of panic through me before I realized it was him, and he pointed onward, into the thick undergrowth. “Let’s go, while it’s changing out its hounds.”\n\nAbove, the Big One let out a mournful bellow, and cupped the ruined Puppet to its chest with both massive hands. I ducked after Mark, and we scrambled into the maze of briars like rabbits fleeing the wolf, the thunder loud enough to hopefully mask our escape.\n\nFresh rain met my face the instant we stepped out on to the road, and Mark clicked his red light back on, breathing a sigh of relief.\n\n“Like taking a stroll in the park.” He grinned back, and despite my riveting fear, another smile stretched across my face as well.\n\n“Maybe a park for the insane. Did you see the way it acted about the Kendra one? Almost like it was upset.”\n\nMark took on a hateful glare, one he directed at the moisture-clogged forest behind us. “It’s not used to losing one of its precious pets. That thing’s probably killed more good men than we know. The sooner it runs out of freaks to chase us with, the better.”\n\n*I couldn’t agree more.*\n\nWe spent the next fifteen minutes jogging down the side of the road, our eyes peeled for signs of movement. The rain seemed to have a will of its own, and doused us without mercy, while the wind worked to freeze whatever got wet. My teeth chattered, and Mark’s shoulders hunched in a repeated shiver that told me he too neared a hypothermic state. This couldn’t go on much longer, yet the horrid road showed no sign of ending, stretched on and on into the dark, without bend or turn.\n\nOn my left, something tall and square rose out of the curtains of falling raindrops.\n\nMy heart skipped a beat, and I pulled on the back of Mark’s rucksack. “L-Look. You s-see that, right? Is that a b-building?”\n\nHe swayed to a stop, a harsh round of shakes racking his body, but I caught the renewed gleam in Mark’s eyes. “Oh, thank God. I w-was afraid we weren’t g-going to find it.”\n\n“Wait,” I wanted to smile with hope, but my face moved like old rubber in the frigid rain. “Is that our w-way out?”\n\nMark opened his mouth to speak, but as he turned my way, his already pale cheeks turned sheet white.\n\nA hushed croak from behind me made my blood turn to ice.\n\nI spun on my heel in time to see a dark form lunge from the shadows, its peg-toothed mouth gaped wide, a loud shriek piercing the air from her fetid lungs. How long the Puppet had been trailing us for, I didn’t know, but she closed the distance so fast that my hand didn’t even have time to reach my pistol.\n\n*Bang.*\n\nMark’s shotgun roared with concussive force, and the Puppet went flying into the waterlogged drainage ditched, her legs and arms kicking in the throes of death.\n\nLike ripples on a lake, the echo of the gunshot rattled into the trees, followed by an unnerving calm. My ears rang, but not enough to disguise every other sound falling silent. Mark and I shared a dread-filled grimace, and the entire world held its breath, like we’d broken some sacred, unspoken rule.\n\n*Maybe the lightning covered it.*\n\nOn cue, the entire forest we’d left behind lit up with a chorus of bloodcurdling screams, and even from far away, I could make out the crash of bodies falling through the branches to the soggy forest floor, only to throw themselves through the underbrush at breakneck speed. I’d been wrong before, I realized, the tidal wave of screeches sinking through me with cold despair. There weren’t dozens of them suspended in the trees.\n\nThere were hundreds.\n\n“Run!” Mark hauled me by the canvas strap of my shoulder bag, but he didn’t have to insist. I ran headlong after him up the bank on the other side of the road, our shoes slipping on the wet grass.\n\nDemented screams came from every direction, the thrash of Puppets permeated the woods, and their feet rang on the gravel road in haphazard drumbeats. They were everywhere, running out of the forest, crawling through ditches, dropping from branches, all to home in on our bobbing red lights with wide maniacal grins.\n\nMy sides ached, the green canvas bag bounced off the small of my back with every step, and rain stung my eyes. Both lungs felt ready to pop, and my legs grew heavier by the second. The fatigue from standing in a hot kitchen all day came back with a vengeance, and I realized I hadn’t eaten or drank anything since lunch, my energy reserves depleted.\n\n*They’re going to catch us. They’re going to catch us, we can’t run forever. Oh Dad, Mom, I’m sorry . . .*\n\nLightning cracked through the sky, and I almost tumbled down the opposite side of the bank, chest high grass rushing up to meet me.\n\nMark caught the hood of my coat and yanked me to my feet, his shout almost drowned out by the furious booms of the storm overhead. “Stick with me, come on.”\n\nThe closer we got, the clearer the enormous outline became. From the look of the dark structure nestled in the midst of the grassy marsh, it had once been a part of the coal mining apparatus of the early 1960’s, a gargantuan concrete and steel building with a high square tower that stretched out over a set of overgrown train tracks. A large sheet metal warehouse branched off from the base of the tower and ran down into a slag yard surrounded by brush-entangled fencing. In one section, the fence had been toppled over by time and rust, leaving a gap the size of a pickup truck.\n\nMy legs were almost numb, but I threw myself toward the gap, the shrieks of the Puppets right behind me.\n\nMark’s shotgun barked once more, and I turned to see where he was.\n\nHe lay in the trampled grass only a few yards back, having tripped on a hidden log. Mark reacted in time to roll over and bring his shotgun to bear on the closest Puppet, taking its head off with the blast, but more bore down on him from every direction. In seconds, he’d be swamped.\n\nI stopped, my muscles twitching in protest, and the world slowed to a crawl.\n\nMark was my friend. He’d saved my life. He’d asked me to dinner once, told me I was beautiful once, and forgave me when I couldn’t do the same. Yet, in that awful moment, a thought crossed my mind.\n\nWhat if I didn’t go back for him?\n\nWould the dread go away? Would the confusing, sickening, anxiety-inducing stream of jumbled thoughts in my head fade if he wasn’t there to stir them up? If Mark wasn’t there to smile in the warm way he did, or say my name with a gentle voice that gave me butterflies in my stomach, could I find a way to go back to normal at last? I wouldn’t have to endure hearing about Claire, see a ring on Mark’s finger, or get social media notifications of the two of them on their honeymoon. I wouldn’t have to face an uncertain future alone, with the knowledge that it all could have been different. I could avoid all of it, right this second.\n\nAll I had to do, was leave.\n\nMark shot another oncoming Puppet, but the one behind it closed the distance before he could rack another slug into the gun’s chamber and leapt onto his toro. It’s frothy peg-toothed jaws snapped at Mark’s exposed throat, and he struggled to hold the freak back with his shotgun, both arms trembling with exhaustion.\n\n“Maddie!” He yelled, the storm doing its best to carry Mark’s voice away. “Get out of here!”\n\n*I could run, and he wouldn’t even curse my name. He’s not selfish. Not like me.*\n\nAnger flared inside me, a deep, seething rage that burned in my veins.\n\nI brought up my pistol, both arms shaking with the cold rain, and staggered back his way.\n\n*Bang, bang, bang.*\n\nThe pistol danced in my hands, spitting shiny brass casings into the gloom of night. Another Puppet tumbled to the ground, and it gave me enough room to reach the one astride Mark’s chest.\n\n“*Get off!*” I drew the knife from my belt and brought it down as hard as I could into the back of the Puppet’s head.\n\nIt reared back, but I had hold of the creature’s collar, and ripped the knife free to drive it again and again into the wooden head, my fingers stinging with the exertion. Splinters and pitch-black goo coated my face, but I couldn’t stop. Something inside of me snapped, and all the anxious tension from months of guilt and shame boiled over into uncontrollable hate. It couldn’t end this way, not for Mark, not for me. I wasn’t going to hurt him, not again, and I wouldn’t let anything else do it either.\n\nA barefooted Puppet wrapped her arms around my waist in a flying tackle. The gun flew from my right hand, the knife from my left, and we both went down in a heap, the muck spattering our limbs.\n\nYet this time, I didn’t feel the crippling fear.\n\nI rolled with the Puppet in the grass and mud like a wild animal, biting, clawing, and screaming with visceral hostility. She tried to gnaw at my face, but I drove my thumb up to the knuckle in her squishy dead eyeball and pushed the girl to the ground.\n\nMark’s shotgun roared back to life, and when the gun ran dry, he swung it like a baton, shoving the buttstock into the oncoming noses of our white-eyed pursuers with rapid succession.\n\nMy hand found a rock, and I hefted it high, swinging with all my might like I was back in junior high softball at the pitcher’s mound.\n\n*Crack.*\n\nAgain, I brought it down, burying the chunk of limestone into the limp Puppet’s head, screaming shrilly with every blow. My voice cracked, my lungs raw from the damp air, and my pulse roared in my ear to reach a bloodthirsty crescendo.\n\nAn arm wound around me from behind, and I tore at the thick coat sleeve with my chipped fingernails, head awash with adrenaline. “Let go you scummy—”\n\n“Easy, easy, easy, it’s me.” Mark shuffle-ran backward with me in tow, his shotgun in the other hand, as a crowd of Puppets heaved through the flattened grass. “Get up, they’re coming.”\n\nMy knees were shakier than I remembered them being, but I pulled both feet back under me, and together we sprinted through the gap in the fence, toward the main building of the coal yard.\n\nI threw open a rusty metal door at the base of the concrete tower, and as soon as we were through, we both shoved it closed.\n\nSnatching a piece of rusted angle-iron from a cobweb filled corner, Mark jammed it through the narrow door handles. He stepped back just as a chorus of bangs erupted on the other side, fists, arms, feet, and heads ramming the sheet steel in a cacophony of sound.\n\n“It’s not gonna hold.” I paced in a frantic search of the dimly lit interior for something else to use as a barricade. “Mark, where are we going?”\n\n“*There.*” He headed for a concrete alcove in the wall, where a set of recessed dusty steps wound upward. “Head to the top, we’re almost through.”\n\nWith our feet pounding on the cement, Mark and I raced ever higher in the abandoned stairwell, as small broken windows gushed wind and rain onto us at regular intervals. The corroded doors buckled, and dozens of Puppets swarmed into the tower, some on all fours, with glowing eyes and hellish croaks. Everything flashed by in the frame of my dim red headlamp, like a nightmare of blood-red and dirt-black all rolled together. My calves throbbed, and the bag on my back weighed a pound more with each step.\n\nLightning lit up the world outside, and my eyes caught a large, slender figure in the glow of the storm.\n\n“Look out!” The words barely left my mouth, and the floor beneath my shoes shook like an earthquake had struck.\n\nCaught by surprise, Mark tripped, and the massive gray hand plunged through the wall from outside to slam down where he had been a second ago. The creature roared, its eerie whale-like call piercing my eardrums to rip through my skull.\n\nLike a child groping for a toy in the dark, the Big One prodded the stairwell with clumsy fingers. Each shove of the gigantic hand only widened the hole in the wall and knocked more concrete loose from the dilapidated structure. Large cracks ran over the walls, across the ceiling and down the floor, and the building shifted on its foundation with a sickening crunch.\n\n*It’s going to knock the whole thing down on top of us.*\n\nUnarmed and panicking, I dove into the shadows, bits of concrete raining down around me.",

        "text": "  \n\nI drifted out of a pleasant dream and felt mildly surprised the room was still so dark. My brain was expecting cool morning light filtering through the curtains. \n\nThen it suddenly hit me: it was so dark because my eyes were still closed. I was wide awake, but I couldn’t open my eyes. A bolt of fear so hard I actually cried out shook my body. I rubbed my eyes- nothing felt unusual or different. I just physically couldn’t open my eyelids. \n\nA few minutes passed while I lay back, completely still. As the immediate terror subsided, I thought back to the night and day before. Nothing in my fairly routine, drab life had changed. What terrible, sudden illness was this? I knew I was in my own bed, I could feel my own duvet and pillow. I tried again to and again to open my eyes, but I couldn’t, and the strain was starting to hurt the tiny little muscles around my eyeballs. \n\nI needed help. Where was my cell phone? I groped towards the nightstand, and spilled my glass of water. I found my cellphone, sopping wet. Fumbling with smooth wet screen, I gave up in despair very soon, as I realised I could not turn it on. I couldn’t even remember how much charge it had. I remembered I could talk to it, and feeling foolish, I asked it to call my mother. Not just because I am still attached to my mother, but because she is a retired pharmacist and I thought she could help me with whatever paralysis had afflicted my eyelids. \n\nNothing happened. It must have been low charge, or else I wasn’t using the open sesame correctly. My phone remained dead, as useless as brick. Annoyingly, my mom’s words flitted round and round my brain- how worried she’s been that I started living alone, a direct contrast to my own feelings at living solo. I had been over the moon that I could finally afford my own place. I forwarded her articles showing the rise of numbers of people living by themself, but she wasn’t convinced. “But what if something happens, and you need help Mary?” she kept wailing. \n\nWeIl, here I was. Something had happened, and I needed help. I guess mothers are always right, after all. \n\nI knew to get help, I needed to leave the bedroom, go downstairs and leave my house. Sightless. \n\nI swung my legs around and down, stood up, and then I heard it. \n\nA short, soft suppressed cough. \n\nTo say I screamed would be an understatement. I am forever amazed at how on earth the neighbours didn’t hear my shrieks of terror and come barging in. Granted, I am not living in the best neighbourhood, but I had not realised terrified screams are such a common unremarkable occurrence.\n\nEventually I stopped screaming. Everywhere was silent. \n\n“Hello?” I quavered. \n\nDead silence. \n\n“Please”, I whimpered. “What do you want?”\n\nI took a shaky step away from my bed, and felt to my disgust the hot wet liquid running down my legs. I hadn’t even realised I had done that when screaming. \n\nI began to think I must have imagined the soft cough.  The silent was so loud, and I could hear my ears ringing. I began to grope my way towards my bedroom door, my arms reached madly out in front of me. \n\nDespite my better judgement, in the rush of victory of finding the door, I called out “I know you’re watching me you sick fuck. I know you’re enjoying this.”\n\nDid I imagine that whoever was watching me shook their head?\n\nI fell to my hands and knees and began groping my way to the stairs. I was terrified my observer would push me down the stairs- I felt certain that was going through their brain, and that they were debating it. I heard another breath, imagined or not, but this time I kept quiet. I needed all my concentration. \n\nI found the stairs, gripped the banisters, and started going down, keeping my body low. My face was aching from the strain of not being able to open my eyelids. \n\nEventually I was downstairs. \n\nAnd as I opened my front door, I felt a lightening in my face muscles, and the blackness flickered. The morning sun poured in on me, and I found I could open my eyes as usual. I stood on my front step blinking, my face scrunched up, unsure what to do next. There was no one in my house. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nA few days later, I was at my mother’s place. I had kept my little adventure to myself, for what was the use of adding to her anxieties? And what was the use of reporting something like this? No matter how convinced I was that someone had done that to me, and had been in my house watching me struggle with temporary loss of vision, there was no point in wasting time and energy trying to report it, with no evidence. The only thing I did for myself was to book an appointment with a local optometrist. But even before the appointment, I knew my eyes were perfectly fine. \n\nIt must have been mother’s instinct then, for she would not let up on her worries for me that night. I was about to suggest she get counselling – she sounded more shrill and relentless than ever. And then she laid out her big proposal- with my father now comfortably passed. I should move back in with her. “What’s the point Mary,” she cried “You and I both alone, me retired and rattling around in this old house, you paying a fortune in rent in that terrible area- I can’t sleep a wink at night I swear knowing you are there all by yourself- I saw an episode of SVU the other night and it was all about push-in rape- oh my god if something like happened to you- no way of preventing-“ she paused to catch her breath, turned her face and coughed softly into her arm sleeve. \n\nAnd the sound spiralled me back into that terrible black morning, that same soft suppressed cough. \n\nShe lifted her face, looked at me, and I stared back. \n\n“What?” she asked innocently. But I knew. \n\nI have not visited her since. It has been the hardest thing that I have had to do in my life. But every time I waiver, I remember that morning, and stay firm. \n\nI will never go near her again.",

        "text": "Me and my family moved to a small town in Oregon when I was about 7 years old. Due to my difficult childhood, it was very hard for me to interact with other kids, especially to get them to stick around.\n\nBut at some point, I remember I was playing outside before my homeschooled classes began when I met  her. She was a young girl around my age, Lorelai. From the start, I knew that there was something bizarre about Lorelei. It could've been the fact that she spoke with a strange accent, kinda like a mix of a boston and a southern accent. Or maybe it was the fact that she always wore the same clothes and had the same one long braid in her hair\n\nBut anyway, I didn't really care that she seemed strange. After talking with her, I found out that both of us were pretty similar. We were both born in Massachusetts, we had trouble making friends, we both liked frogs, etc. I finally felt like I had found myself a friend\n\nEver since that morning, we were practically best friends. We were always going to the creek to catch frogs, swinging on a random tire swing in the forest next to my house, or just talking and playing around somewhere in town \n\nAnother strange note is that Lorelai hated people. Well, except for me. Whenever I tried to get another kid or adult involved in our playtime, she would get very upset and usually started lashing out at me. I knew she was pretty antisocial like I was, but it took me a bit to realize she was **that** antisocial.\n\nI can't remember that much of the times we've played, but I can remember this one particular day the way you would remember something bad happening. It was a pretty warm day in late Spring, and neither of us felt like playing. However, she got an idea of what to do and started dragging me through the woods. It was going to start pouring at any moment and I pleaded that we check out whatever it was tomorrow, but she was very insistent on checking the thing out immediately. \n\nAfter a while of running through the thick woods, we settled at a small clearing, where Lorelai took out a small shovel. I asked her what the shovel was for, and she responded with \"We have something to dig up\". I shoveled and shoveled in this one spot she showed me, but never told me what we were getting.\n\nFinally, after what took half an hour at the very least, I managed to fully dig up a large chest in the ground. It had a lock on it, but the lock stood no chance against a few swift kicks\n\nAfter opening the chest, I noticed that there was multiple belongings in it, mostly letters, sketches, maps, and a stuffed frog made from what looked like a raggedy potato sack. Shortly after opening the chest, Lorelai immediately grabbed the frog, said \"Thanks, I've been wanting this for a while\", and ran off. I tried chasing her, but she was too fast for me to keep up. That was the last time I ever saw Lorelai.\n\nI noticed the chest was looked very old, so I closed it up and took it to the town historian, Mr. Geller. Once I got to our town's small museum, I greeted mr. Geller and told him I found something that he might find interesting. And interesting it was.\n\nThe chest was from the Landry family, one of the many families that traveled through the Oregon Trail for new opportunities. However, from the context of the notes, the Landry family met their demise after the family was murdered and cannibalized by some third party. From the looks of it, the third party found their belongings, likely took things of value, and decided to leave some of their belongings in a chest underground as a little prize for whomever found it.\n\nBut the thing that stuck out the most where the members of the family. The parents were Lucille and Andrew Landry, and their two children were named Marc and Lorelai Landry",

        "text": "We were driving on Route 1, the sun shining down on us as we made our way toward Richmond, Virginia for our honeymoon. Shanice was behind the wheel, her hand intertwined with mine, and I couldn’t help but smile at how lucky I was to have her as my wife. It had been a long trip, and we were both tired from the wedding. We couldn’t wait to check in at the hotel and finally start our life together. It had been a long journey to get to this point in our lives, as we had faced many challenges and obstacles along the way, but we had always stuck together, supporting each other through thick and thin. Shanice looked at me, exhausted but still as beautiful as ever. \n\n*Here Comes The Sun* by The Beatles played on the radio and as the sun continued to shine down on us, we sang along to the lyrics, feeling grateful for the love and joy that surrounded us. The scenery passing by was breathtaking and I took it all in, realizing how truly blessed we were to have each other and this moment. As we neared our destination, excitement built up inside us. We looked forward to the adventures and memories we were about to create. I had never felt more at peace. Then something interrupted that peace.\n\nA bang came from the sky, like thunder but sharper. It was so powerful that Shanice almost lost control of the vehicle. For a moment, I felt nauseous, and then the song on the radio glitched out and was replaced by a harsh male voice. \n\n“According to eyewitnesses, a large submarine was seen cruising along the coastline of Havana earlier this morning. The witnesses claim that the submarine appeared to be of Japanese origin, and was flying the flag of the Rising Sun. The sighting has not been confirmed by authorities, but the reports are being taken very seriously…”\n\nThere was a whistling sound piercing through the air, growing louder and more intense by the second, and maybe a mile ahead of us, we saw a bright, glowing object streaking toward the ground.\n\n“My God,” said Shanice as she slowed down, “what is that?”\n\nThe song on the radio came back intermittently but kept glitching out.\n\n“It must be a meteorite,” I said, my voice filled with excitement and awe. “That’s incred—” \n\nThere was a loud boom to our right, and the car shook as a part of the meteorite must have hit the ground, creating a massive explosion. I could feel the heat of the impact even from where we were.\n\n“Wow,” whispered Shanice, her eyes wide with shock. “That was something else!” She pulled over. Some dirt landed on the hood of the car. “Do we call someone?”\n\n“I-I don’t know.” I looked at the smoke rising from the crater. “Where did the bigger one go? It should’ve hit the ground by now.” But it hadn’t. It was as if it had disappeared altogether. “Let’s get out and check out the crater”, I said with some excitement now that my shock has subsided.\n\n“Wait.” Shanice put her hand on my shoulder. “What’s up with the radio?”\n\nI hadn’t paid any attention to it. It was still broadcasting the other channel, but there was a woman talking now.\n\n“…is well aware of the potential implications of a conflict between the British Empire and the Empire of Japan, and they are taking all necessary measures to prevent it from escalating.”\n\n“What about it,” I said. “Let’s get out and—”\n\n“Just wait, would you? They said something strange just now, didn’t you hear it? Something about—” She looked worried. “Just listen for a second, okay?”\n\nAn elderly man was talking now. It sounded like a recording of a speech.\n\n“…Confederate States of America will continue to work with our allies to ensure peace and stability in the world. We believe that diplomacy and dialogue are the best means to resolve disputes and maintain stability in the international community.”\n\nI felt nauseous again. The column of smoke coming from the crater next to the road appeared almost sickening now, although I couldn’t tell exactly why.\n\n“It’s—” I swallowed nervously. “It’s just some radio show, honey.”\n\nShe changed the channel.\n\n“Well, Bob, the Return to Africa bill was definitely a step in the right direction when it came to giving African slaves their freedom after the so-called ‘Great Slave Surplus’ in the sixties when modern farming equipment replaced, I would say most slaves working on the fields. However, it also had the unintended consequence of creating a shortage in the construction industry that’s still felt today. A lot of people are arguing that it’s time to end the practice of slavery on a national level, pointing to the success of the British, and even the Japanese, who both abolished slavery long ago. They also say the practice makes our people look indolent—some even go as far as to use the word *lazy*—in the eyes of the international community. What do you think about that, Mary? Are the American people ready to give up—”\n\n“What the hell?” I said. “That’s another channel?”\n\n“What’s going on, James?” Shanice looked at me, her eyes filled with fear.\n\n“It’s just a coincidence,” I said as I picked up my phone. “Try another channel, you’ll see. I’ll call 911 and alert the authorities about— Actually, I don’t have a signal… Do you—”\n\nShe was already looking at her phone.\n\n“No, me neither.”\n\nWith a trembling hand, she tuned the radio to another channel yet again. A strange, opera-like song was just fading out and was replaced by the voice of a cheerful man: \n\n“Are you looking for a reliable and hardworking servant? Look no further than South Shore Trading Company! Our servants are the best in the business. They do the hard work for you, so you can relax and enjoy your time. We have a wide selection of servants to fit your needs, from cooking and cleaning to gardening and childcare. Get the help you need with our top-notch servants. Visit South Shore Trading Company today and get the perfect servant for your family!”\n\nShanice turned the radio off and stepped out of the car. I followed her. She was trying to light a cigarette.\n\n“Let’s drive to the nearest town and report the meteor impact from there,” I suggested. “And whatever is going on with the radio, I don’t know, it must be some kind of collaboration between the stations to spread awareness. We must have just missed the context, that’s all. I mean, what else could it be?”\n\n“Something isn’t right,” Shanice said. “I’m feeling off. Like something is just wrong. That thing, that thing from the sky, it— Don’t you feel it?”\n\nI did feel it—a feeling of impending doom—but I didn’t want to admit it to myself, and since it didn’t seem to make sense, I didn’t want to worry my wife further by mentioning it.\n\n“All good reasons to get out of here,” I said.\n\nWe got back into the car. Shanice took the passenger seat, too upset to drive, and let me take the wheel. I took one last look at the column of smoke. A part of me still wanted to check out the crater, to see what was hiding in it, but by now it was nothing more than morbid curiosity. All excitement was gone. I put the pedal to the metal. The dust from the impact blew off the windscreen while I made sure we got out of there as fast as possible. \n\nAfter driving for some time, without turning on the radio, the dread that had settled in me didn’t go away as I would’ve hoped but rather increased. Something was off, but I couldn’t put my finger on what it was. Shanice, constantly checking her phone to see if the signal was back, didn’t say much but I could tell she was feeling the same.\n\nAn odd-looking truck drove past us in the opposing lane. It had a strangely prolonged hood and the trailer attached to it was reminiscent of a classic wagon albeit made of black metal. The body of the truck was a weathered brown and the large black wheels and rugged tires added to its unusual appearance. Just before it passed, I noticed the driver—an elderly black man wearing a gray corporate overall—looking down at us with a facial expression of disbelief.\n\n“What the hell kind of truck was that?” I said. “Did you see that?”\n\n“Maybe we should go back?” Shanice bit her nails, as she always did when nervous or stressed. “I’m telling you, something absolutely crazy is going on. It’s not just the meteor, the radio, or the truck it’s *everything*. I know it sounds silly, honey, but I don’t think we should continue down this road.”\n\nI drove to the side of the road and stopped the car. \n\n“I’m freaked out too,” I said, “but what could possibly be going on? We could’ve been killed by that meteor and we’re both still in shock, I think. Now, we can go back, for sure, but this is supposed to be our honeymoon, and do we really want whatever this is to ruin that? We should be in Ashland soon. Maybe we should at least go there and—”\n\nA harsh siren, reminiscent of a fire alarm, came from behind us. I looked in the rearview mirror. A police car—similar to the strange truck but smaller and more aerodynamic—had pulled up behind us. Two officers wearing leather jackets, black boots, and Stetson hats stepped out of the vehicle as soon as they had turned off the dreadful sirens. Shanice was shaking next to me, anticipating something I couldn’t even imagine. I locked the doors to the car and put my hand on the car key, getting ready to get out of there. As they walked up to our car, I saw in the rear-view mirror that they were both wearing the Confederate flag on their sleeves.\n\n“Those aren’t real cops!” Shanice yelled, probably after noticing the same thing. “Just drive!”\n\nI turned the key and the engine roared to life. I stepped on the gas pedal and the car lurched forward. The officers quickly jumped back into their own car and began to pursue us.\n\nI made a U-turn and began driving back toward Washington. The police car—or whatever it was—remained close behind us, its flashing lights filling the car with an eerie red glow. Shanice was crying and yelling at me to go faster. I drove as fast as I could, but the police car remained at our heels. I couldn’t believe—nor understand—what was happening, all I knew was that we had to get away from those men and get in touch with the *real* police. Up ahead, where the meteor had hit the ground, I noticed that a roadblock had been set up, blocking our escape. I swerved onto a dirt road, hoping to lose our pursuers, but their vehicle was too nimble and followed us. Eventually, we came to a small town. Here, I thought, the madness had to come to an end. We just needed to find some normal, decent people and get in touch with the authorities. \n\n“Oh, my God”, Shanice said, “it’s everywhere!”\n\nIn front of us, outside what looked like a town hall building, was a flagpole flying the Confederate flag. I pushed the car to its limits, swerving around corners and accelerating down straightaways. The people on the sidewalks looked at us in astonishment. The clothes they wore were a strange, eerie mix of bygone eras as if they’d stepped straight out of another time. The women were draped in long, flowing dresses that were reminiscent of the 1940s, with their hair styled in soft waves and their lips painted a deep red. But there were also touches of a more archaic style, with corsets peeking out and parasols clutched in their gloved hands. The men, too, were dressed in a way that was both familiar and foreign. They wore suits with wide lapels and suspenders, but the trousers were cut higher, almost to the knee, and the shoes were shiny and black, with large buckles. The overall effect was unsettling, as if they had somehow stepped out of a dream and into the modern world, still dressed in the garb of a long-gone time.\n\nThe road ahead split in two directions. I had to make a quick decision. I swerved to the left and took a sharp turn, only to face down another one of those strange police cars. I stepped on the brakes and was just about to back up when the other car showed up behind us.\n\n“Fuck!” I yelled.\n\n“What do we do?” Shanice asked. “James?”\n\nThe officers stepped out of their cars and surrounded us, all of them with their hands on their holsters. One of them, a tall man with a narrow face, knocked on the window next to me with his baton. Reluctantly, I rolled down the window, feeling my heart in my throat, and grabbed Shanice's hand. \n\n“Step out of the vehicle, both of you”, said the man. “You are under arrest.”\n\n“I don’t understand,” I said. “What’s up with that flag, with—”\n\nAnother officer—a short man of heavy build—appeared next to the tall man.\n\n“Toyota”, he said with a southern drawl. “Sounds Japanese.”\n\n“The flag?” said the tall man. “Which flag? You are arrested for evasion of the law and reckless endangerment. Now are you going to step out of the car, or do we need to pull you out?”\n\n“This is insane”, I whispered under my breath. “Look, I don’t know what twisted, racist re-enactment, role-playing game, or sheer fantasy you’re trying to live out but last time I checked this was still The United States of America, and what you’re doing to us is illegal.”\n\nThe officers laughed.\n\n“We’re not in the US anymore,” Shanice said. “James, don’t you get it?” \n\n“Wha-what?” I said, confused. “This is ridiculous.”\n\n“So let me get this straight,” the officer said with a smirk. “You’re driving around in a strange, Japanese vehicle, dressed like I don’t know what, and are pretending to be from The United States of America and you’re suggesting that it is *us* that lives in a fantasy world? You need to step out of the car and come with us to the station. It’s either that or the hard way which none of us want.”\n\n“This isn’t our world,” Shanice whispered. “Something happened when that meteor hit, something impossible. I just know it. I felt it instantly.”\n\n“O-okay… but what do we do? I’m terrified.”\n\n“We have to play along, that’s all we can do now—”\n\nThe officer knocked on the roof of the car with his baton. “No more babble, get out of the car!”\n\n“Okay!” I slowly opened the door and stepped out of the car, Shanice following close behind me. The officers still had their hands close to their guns, ready to grab them at a moment’s notice. The officer closest to us searched us, taking our phones and wallets, before leading us to their police car. The officer receiving the items accidentally lit the display of one of our phones and dropped it out of surprise. His colleague bent down and picked it up.\n\n“Don’t you ever watch the vision box, Earl?” he said. “These devices just released in Japan. If you ask me…” He lowered his voice. “…if you ask me, we’re dealing with two spies here.” \n\n“Turn around and put your hands behind your back”, the short officer said after he placed us next to their car.\n\nI did as I was told, feeling the cold metal of handcuffs being snapped around my wrists, and so did Shanice.\n\n“Please, sir,” I said, trying to appeal to their sense of reason. “We don’t mean any harm. We just want to get out of here and get on with our honeymoon.”\n\n“Don’t tell them anything!” Shanice hissed. “Are you crazy?”\n\n“Your honeymoon will be spent in jail,” said the tall officer.\n\n“As it should,” said the short one as he placed us in the backseat of the police car, “seeing that your marriage isn’t legal here. Or did you get married in Japan?” He laughed. “And then you came all the way here—with your weird little Japanese car, dressed like complete jesters—to celebrate your marriage where it’s the least appreciated? This story just keeps getting crazier and crazier!”\n\nThey took us to a small, dingy police station where we were thrown into a cell. The officers left us there, without saying a word, leaving us to our thoughts.\n\n“What did you mean when you said we weren’t in the US anymore?” I asked, leaning against the bars of the cell. “Are you suggesting this is some kind of alternate reality?”\n\n“That’s exactly what I’m suggesting,” she said. “I think that meteor teared up the fabric of our reality somehow, and—”\n\n“That’s insane!” I shook my head. “We’re dealing with a group of deranged people whose living out some far-right wet dream. It’s just a bunch of QAnon that’s come together in this little backward town and—”\n\n“What about the radio, huh?” Shanice interrupted.\n\n“They could’ve easily hijacked it somehow,” I said. “I don’t know, but—”\n\n“And the strange vehicles? You think they designed and built their own fully functioning make-belief cars as well?”\n\n“What you’re suggesting isn’t exactly more believable.”\n\n“Listen, James, I’m telling you… We passed through some kind of rift in space-time, or—I don’t know—some kind of interdimensional portal and now we’re stuck in a world where the freaking Confederacy won the civil war!”\n\nI spotted a newspaper underneath the bench Shanice was sitting on. I picked it up, hoping it would prove her wrong, but was instead met with more evidence to the contrary. It was called the Richmond Examiner. Based on the date, it was only a week old. The headline of the main story read *Crisis in the Pacific: British and Japanese Fleets Clash*. \n\nI sighed and tossed the paper at Shanice. “They’ve really paid attention to the details. These people are trying to get under our skin, trying to brainwash us—possibly to force us to do something which will—”\n\nShanice, who had picked up the newspaper, interrupted me. “This is *real*. Listen to this, okay?” She began reading from the newspaper. “It has been several weeks since tensions between the British Empire and the Empire of Japan reached boiling point, with reports of a Japanese fleet creating a blockade around the Hawaiian Islands. This comes in response to the Confederate States of America’s decision to allow the British Empire to place nuclear weapons on the islands. The move has been seen as a direct threat to Japanese security, leading to a build-up of military presence in the region.” She paused. “James, they got pictures and everything, and why would they pick *this* as their main story if it was fake — wouldn’t they pick something more domestic?” She continued to read: “The crisis has been escalating, with both sides refusing to back down. The British Empire, with its powerful naval presence in the Pacific, has deployed additional vessels to the region, while the Japanese fleet remains on high alert. The situation is rapidly deteriorating, with fears of an all-out war becoming increasingly real.”\n\n“Anyone can fake anything these days,” I said, “you know that. Let’s just try to think of a way to get out of—”\n\nThe tall officer entered the room. He sat down on a wooden stool in front of us—his earlier aggressive expression now calm—and lit a cigar while looking at us with a piercing gaze.\n\n“I’m Carlos, and I’m the sheriff in this town.” He took a puff on his cigar. “You’re James and Shanice—am I pronouncing that correctly?—Robertson, at least according to those little cards we found in your wallets. On those cards, it actually says you’re from The United States of America. That’s curious, seeing that The United States of America doesn’t exist anymore. Your Japanese equipment tells me you’re spies, hired to accomplish some mission, but then again why would spies come up with some ridiculous fiction rather than trying to blend in? Maybe you aren’t spies at all, but just activists trying to make a statement. If so, I’m guessing you’re a former servant, Shanice, rebelling against the system. I ran both of your names through the calculator, and nothing came up, which is another oddity. Perhaps you’re spies after all. Anyhow, this case is a bit above my paygrade, and my colleague decided to report you to CLEA—”\n\n“What’s that?” Shanice asked. “What’s CLEA?”\n\n“Why, The Confederate Law Enforcement Agency, of course. They’ll pick you and your equipment up and transfer you to Richmond. That’s what’s going to happen.” He leaned forward and lowered his voice. “Here’s the thing, though, I think there’s something more going on than what I’m being told. And I would very much appreciate it if you would tell me what it is. All I know, at the moment, is that something fell from the sky earlier today, just out of town, and now they’ve cut off traffic on Rebel Route telling everyone there’s been a gas leak.”\n\n“Why would we tell you anything?” Shanice asked. “You were the one—”\n\n“I’m going to be upfront with you,” Carlos said with an even lower voice. “I don’t like when the government comes to my town, lying to my face and telling me what to do, and I don’t like how they treat your people.” He looked at Shanice. “I know about *that* lie and it’s the ugliest of them all… In my youth, I worked at one of the so-called *temporary* detention camps after they passed the Return to Africa Bill.” He took a deep breath. “I was just a kid back then, but I understood what they were doing there, and it wasn’t freeing any slaves.”\n\n“What did they do?” I asked, sick to my stomach.\n\n“You’ve already heard the so-called conspiracy theories… Well, I saw it with my own eyes. It’s all true.”\n\n“What conspiracy theories?” Shanice added.\n\n“You really don’t know about this stuff?” Carlos took another puff and looked at us with suspicious eyes. “It was just another slave trade. Only a handful was shipped to Liberia as free men, the vast majority was sold to Belgian Congo and some other colonies where they needed more workers in the mines. But even over there, the need for more workers wasn’t big enough to accommodate our surplus…” Carlos looked down at the floor. “So, they built these large chambers, looking almost like the churches you see everywhere besides the road… And they took them there, the ones unfit—too old, too *young*—and the ones unwilling.”\n\n“Then what did they do,” Shanice asked, tearing up. “What did *you* do?”\n\n“It was so crowded in there, they were all standing shoulder to shoulder, not knowing what would come next… I was just a kid back then, but they still sent me in there to clean up after the process was done. And that’s what I did. This was close to Matanzas and, being of Spanish descent, I wasn’t valued much higher than the former slaves. I was just trying to help my parents pay rent. Anyhow, I won’t be sending anyone of your people their way if I can prevent it. You know, when I see the more rebellious Whigs up north hanging up the Union Flag in their windows or front yards, I wonder what it would’ve been like if things were different, if history had taken another turn, so to speak. It’s a childish fantasy, but… seeing you and your possessions—your strange car, your curious electronic devices, and your odd-looking plastic cards with The United States of America written all over them… well, it makes me wonder.”\n\n“We aren’t spies.” Shanice walked up to the bars. “That thing that fell from the sky, it came from space, and it had some kind of effect on—”\n\nA group of men in black cloaks flung open the door and strode purposefully into the room, radiating an air of confidence and command. Carlos stood up and straightened his back, leaving his cigar on the stool. \n\n“Good evening, sir. We are from CLEA,” one of the men said in a deep, authoritative voice. “We’re here to take the prisoners with us, the colored woman and her companion. They’re suspected of espionage and high treason. Would you be so kind as to open their cell?”\n\nHe did as he was told, locking eyes with us but not saying anything.\n\n“This can’t be real,” I said, still doubtful but less so than before. “Hey, don’t touch her!” Carlos let go of Shanice’s arm and allowed her to step out by herself.\n\n“This isn’t right!” Shanice said to Carlos as we were led outside by the men. “You know this isn’t right! It’s all wrong! We don’t belong here!”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe men didn’t say a word to us, they just threw us in the back of a large black vehicle that looked more like a locomotive than a truck. They had already loaded it with our car. Shanice banged on the back doors after they closed them, begging them to let us out, but to no avail. We sat in total darkness as the vehicle drove away. I held Shanice in my arms, trying to comfort her the best I could.\n\n“They’re driving on the open road now”, I said. “If the police spot this bizarre vehicle on the road, they’ll pull it over and—”\n\n“You *still* don’t understand?” Shanice said.\n\nI did understand, and it frightened me more than anything, but I still held up hope that there was a more mundane explanation to all of this. \n\n“I-I don’t know,” I said. “I just don’t know. But we’re going to get out of this situation, one way or another.”\n\nAfter about forty-five minutes the vehicle hit the brakes. I wasn’t ready and fell down, and so did Shanice. We struggled to get up on our feet but then threw ourselves on the floor again when we heard gunshots outside. I crawled up to Shanice, trying to find her in the darkness. We heard people yelling, and then some more gunshots. A man’s voice could be heard behind the back doors shortly after:\n\n“Stay back and take cover!”\n\nHe then shot at the lock, and the doors swung open. We were pulled out of the vehicle by strong hands. It took a few seconds for my eyes to adjust to the daylight. Two black men, wielding rifles of a sort I had never seen before, stood in front of us. They wore what looked like fedoras but were otherwise dressed as the men we had seen in the small town.\n\n“Go!” one of them said. “Go, go, go!”\n\nThey rushed us to another vehicle. Shanice stopped in her tracks. At first I thought it was because of the dead bodies on the road, but then she quickly entered their truck and came out with a cotton bag with the word “EVIDENCE” written on it. It contained our personal belongings. The two men yelled for us to hurry up, and just before I jumped into their car, I noticed Richmond in the distance. The city was unrecognizable from what I remembered. Gleaming white marble buildings towered over the landscape, adorned with grandiose statues and flags bearing the emblem of the Confederacy. At that moment I knew Shanice had been right all along. This was another Earth.  \n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/tobiasmalm/comments/112r4le/i_just_released_my_novel_the_cave_to_another/)",

His grin stretched so wide that the skin of his cheeks began to split, sending rivulets of blood flowing down his face as if someone had cut him from ear to ear. And behind the skin, I saw countless blood-soaked teeth, rows behind rows of triangular, serrated teeth, like those of a shark. He began to yell, gurgling the blood that filled his mouth.\n\n“They’re coming for you! You cannot hide from the eyes of Hell,” he shrieked at me, and I woke up, screaming.\n\nI was in the helicopter, flying away from the Lighthouse, where an experiment had gone terribly wrong and allowed creatures in from another dimension. Every time I closed my eyes, I could see their black, smoking skin, their burning red eyes, the way they ripped the bodies of my fellow agents apart in front of me and drank their blood like vampires.\n\nLooking out the window, I saw the pilot was aiming the chopper at the nearest Air Force base, only a thirty minute flight away. As he set down the chopper on a helipad surrounded by fighter jets and air traffic control towers, an emergency call came through on my phone. The number was marked “Private”, and I knew what that meant: it was a call from either the CIA or another related agency that didn’t allow information to be transmitted about the caller.\n\n“Hello?” I said. Immediately a gruff voice began speaking.\n\n“Where the hell are you?” a man yelled. “You weren’t cleared to leave the site.”\n\n“I *had* to leave!” I yelled back. “I would have died otherwise.” The man sighed loudly, annoyed.\n\n“You could have had him fly the chopper past the outer perimeter of the Lighthouse and land it there. You certainly don’t have clearance to land at \\[REDACTED\\] Air Force Base, and the air traffic controllers messaged me as soon as they saw the chopper on the horizon. Now get your ass back to the entrance of the Lighthouse, *ASAP*,” the agent on the line said. “We have a strike force assembled and we need someone with inside knowledge of what’s going on inside the Lighthouse to aid us. Sadly for all of us, *you* are the only one who we can still contact. All the other grunts and agents within the perimeter of the Lighthouse have fallen out of contact. We expect you back here by oh-eight-three-zero!” I checked my watch. It was already 7:45 AM. I grunted in response, then turned to the pilot.\n\n“They said they need us back there immediately,” I told him. He looked at me in disbelief.\n\n“Why do they need *us* back there?” he asked me, his eyes wide and shocked. “I’m just the pilot!” I shrugged.\n\n“They specifically requested you,” I lied. I didn’t want to go alone. He shook his head, starting up the chopper and taking off.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nWe parked the helicopter onto a field a few hundred feet from the outer perimeter of the Lighthouse. I jumped out, and the pilot grudgingly followed me. He had a pistol holstered around his waist, and he snapped in a few spare magazines into empty velcro pockets built into his belt.\n\nI saw a team of agents and soldiers assembled on the front lawn of the Lighthouse, looking up at the building with trepidation and fear. I walked towards the team, and a man came running out towards me. He had an expensive black suit on and a head full of pure white hair. He was white, but his eyes were so dark they almost looked black. He stuck out his hand.\n\n“Dr. Salem?” he said to me. “I spoke to you on the phone a few minutes ago. I’m Agent Rosgo.” I shook his hand, his grip feeling like steel as he crushed my fingers and palms. I tried not to wince. “I think you need to see this,” he continued, letting go of my hand and turning around. The pilot and I followed him.\n\nA team of agents stood around the back of a Humvee, where radio equipment had been staged in the open trunk. A slender female sat there, playing with the dials, then turned to Agent Rosgo.\n\n“OK, I got it,” she said. He nodded and turned to me.\n\n“This has been broadcasting on repeat to the surrounding towns,” Agent Rosgo said to me. I listened, and as I did, a sense of horror began to build within me.\n\n“We have opened the gate,” a hissing, demonic voice said. “The final battle has begun. We will be victorious. The forces of Hell are unleashed.\n\n“To those listening, all is not lost for you. But you must prove yourself worthy. To do this, we require a sacrifice.\n\n“You must choose a family member, whether a son or a daughter, a mother or a father, a brother or a sister, a wife or a husband- it matters not to us. Drag the one you have chosen outside the front of your house. *Slit their throats*. Dip your hand in their blood and leave a handprint on your front door using their life essence. If you do this, we will pass over you, as the angels passed over the homes of those in ancient Egypt who marked their doors with blood.\n\n“If you refuse, you will die horribly, burnt alive, choking, gasping, tortured... Choose wisely. The end is near. You will not receive another chance.” Then there was the hiss of static, a series of clicking noises, and the message started to repeat itself in the same voice.\n\n“This is currently broadcasting to every AM and FM radio station in a thirty mile radius. We have tried signal jamming, but nothing stops the message from being broadcast. So, what do you make of this?” Agent Rosgo asked me. Behind me, I heard the pilot shuffle nervously.\n\n“Uh, sir,” the pilot said. Agent Rosgo turned his attention to the pilot angrily.\n\n“And just who the hell are you?” he asked.\n\n“My name is Officer Booth, sir. Aleister Booth, of the United States Air Force. My presence was requested…” I quickly cut him off, not wanting them to know I had lied. For some reason that I felt only instinctually, I knew I needed this man, this Aleister Booth, with me. I didn’t know why yet, but something in the depths of my gut screamed at me to stay close to him. I cut him off.\n\n“Look, whatever was opened on the 13th floor of the Lighthouse, it is not human,” I said. “I *saw* those things with my own eyes. They took down an entire armed team of CIA agents without even breaking a sweat. As for this message, maybe they are trying to brainwash people for some reason, perhaps to use the local population as slaves or sycophants. I don’t know. I don’t think anyone does, not for sure.”\n\n“OK, but sir…” Aleister pointed behind us, to the front gate of the Lighthouse. “Something is breaking out. I see movement.” We all turned to look, and, with a gasp of horror, I realized he was right.\n\nMany of the black demonic beings swarmed around the gates, flooding out of the Lighthouse as clouds of black smoke followed behind them, but that wasn’t all. From the top of the structure, I saw winged demons jumping off the helipad, flying straight at us. They looked like massive gargoyles with shining black skin and jaws that unhinged, like those of a snake’s. Within a few seconds, the first of the wave had reached the CIA agents in front, their horrendously widening jaws closing around the bodies of those in front, biting them in half at the waist or chest. The legs of the dying agents kicked and danced, the nerves randomly firing now that they were no longer connected to the brain, but within seconds their mutilated bodies fell to the ground. The shrieking of the gargoyles echoed around us, and most of the agents in front began to raise their rifles to attack back. A cacophony of gunshots echoed all around us.\n\nThe automatic gunfire sprayed across the gargoyles, blowing their reptilian faces into pieces. Black blood exploded out of the wounds. The hundreds of agents and soldiers assembled began to retreat in an orderly way, stepping back and spraying concentrated gunfire at those monstrosities nearest to our group. But looking behind them, I saw the black humanoid beings were quickly overwhelming the outer perimeter of the electric fence. Soldiers in the outer guard towers aimed rifles down at the burnt demons, and a few of the CIA agents even threw grenades at the demons. \n\n“Get down!” they screamed. “Take cover!” I ran behind a Humvee, putting my hands over my ears. A massive booming noise shook the earth as multiple grenades went off. I peered around the Humvee and saw that they had killed dozens of the demons, their body parts strewn all over the grass. Here or there, a decapitated head of one of them still twitched, their fiery red eyes going out as if extinguished by water. But the grenades had also blown open holes in the outer perimeter of the fence, and the surviving hordes began to funnel through the new openings.\n\nI grabbed Agent Rosgo.\n\n“We need to get to the shaman,” I said, “on the 13th floor. Can you get us inside the building? Is there another entrance, like an underground tunnel?” The pilot stood next to me, still in shock as guns roared all around us. The front wave of the demons hadn’t reached the soldiers yet, but they were rapidly closing in.\n\n“Follow me,” Agent Rosgo said, running over to a nearby Humvee. Aleister and I piled into the back seats and he took off, roaring, down a dirt road that weaved around the circumference of the Lighthouse. “There is a secret access tunnel, usually used for maintenance, at the other end of the perimeter. Very few people know about it, and the hatchway door is totally hidden. It requires a special security code to get in, but of course, I have that. I got all the necessary information once we saw what was happening on the security cameras inside the Lighthouse, before my team deployed to contain the issue.”\n\n“I have an idea,” I said, “but it is going to be dangerous, and I don’t even know if it will work. I think the shaman is still getting the drugs fed into his system by intravenous drip, and he may be the one keeping the doorway open. If we can stop the drugs flowing into his system and take him out of there, we may be able to close the Hellmouth.”\n\n“Hellmouth, hah,” Agent Rosgo said in response. “I like that. It really is an apt description.”\n\n“Do you think we will need to kill the shaman?” Aleister asked. I turned to him, having almost forgotten he was there in my high-adrenaline state and total focus on the mission.\n\n“I doubt it,” I said, “but if we need to, then don’t hesitate for a moment. It is better to kill one life to save the life of countless others, after all.” Aleister shook his head at this.\n\n“I don’t believe in that ‘The ends justify the means’ crap,” he said. “I’m not killing any innocent people. God would never forgive me. When I meet my Creator, I want him to know that I never harmed an innocent person in my life.”\n\n“And how do you know the shaman is innocent?” Agent Rosgo asked him, looking in the rearview mirror. “You have seen the horrors he unleashed.”\n\n“He only unleashed those horrors *after* you guys kidnapped and tortured him, for no reason, other than the fact that he has supernatural abilities,” Aleister said. “That sounds like the definition of ‘innocent bystander’ to me. Whatever unintended consequences arose from your experiment, that’s on the CIA, not on the shaman they tortured out of scientific curiosity.” Agent Rosgo slammed on the brakes suddenly, pointing to a shrub immediately to the left of the car.\n\n“The hidden hatchway door is underneath that withered-looking bush,” Rosgo said. “Let’s go and do this.” He jumped out of the driver’s seat, first grabbing an M4 carbine from the passenger seat, then sprinted over to the shrub. After getting down on his knees, he began to feel around in the soft dirt. “Ah-ha!” he exclaimed, pulling a handle up from the dirt. As he twisted the handle, a robotic voice began to speak from hidden speakers in the hatchway door.\n\n“Please enter verification code,” the robotic voice said.\n\n“Zero nine one zero seven seven seven,” Agent Rosgo said flatly, and the door began to swing open, shrub and all. The shrub was apparently a fake plant attached to the metal interior as a marker. Dirt flew off of it, carried away by the tropical Florida breeze.\n\nI looked down and saw a ladder extending into total darkness. Red emergency lights strobed far beneath us at the bottom of the tunnel. Without hesitation, Agent Rosgo began to climb down, then Aleister and I followed.\n\nThe tunnel smelled of bleach and dust. It didn’t appear to be often used. I saw a few spiderwebs in the top corners, the flashing red emergency lights illuminating the huge arachnids as they skittered across their webs, away from the new intruders into their silent den.\n\nWe walked forward for what felt like forever, thousands of feet of perfectly straight tunnel disappearing into a point far in front of me. After about twenty minutes of walking, Agent Rosgo put his hand up, the universal military signal for “Stop”.\n\n“Up ahead,” he whispered, “is the entrance to the Lighthouse.” I looked and saw another ladder a couple hundred feet up.\n\n“Then let’s do this!” I said. Agent Rosgo looked at me like I was crazy.\n\n“Do you even have a gun, Jay?” he asked me. I shook my head. Sighing, he pulled out a pistol from his ankle holster. “Luckily for you, I always carry two pistols, and extra magazines to boot. Take this too.” He gave me two extra pre-loaded magazines. “If three magazines isn’t enough to stop whatever is attacking us, then I don’t think it *can* be stopped.”\n\n“Why do you need two pistols and a full-auto M4 carbine?” I asked. He smiled slyly at this.\n\n“Better safe than sorry,” he said simply. “Plus the M4 carbine tends to waste bullets too fast when in full auto. You want to have multiple backups in a situation like this.” He looked at the ladder, a grimace crossing his face. “OK, let’s do this.”\n\nAgent Rosgo went first, using the strap of the M4 carbine to suspend it around his neck while he climbed up rapidly. I went next, and Aleister followed close behind us. We came to a basement room with boilers, circuit breakers and other necessary equipment for the building’s functioning. Nothing stirred down here.\n\nAs we ascended the next flight of stairs to the ground level floor, I began to realize something was wrong. There was a humming in the air, as if countless high-voltage power lines were directly overhead. But there was no sign of the gargoyles or the demons.\n\nI saw only one elderly man, wearing a fishing cap and loose-fitting clothes, as he walked away from us across the lobby of the building.\n\n“Sir?” Agent Rosgo said, raising his M4 and pointing it at the man. As the elderly man turned, I gasped in horror.\n\nHis eyes were pure black sockets, his nose eaten away as if by cancerous tumors. Blood and pus ran down his face from the hideous opening. His mouth had no teeth or tongue but was simply a black void, and he screamed at us. His lips stretched open far wider than a human mouth should be able to, and as he shrieked, he sent waves of rushing air in our direction. The air smelled like rotting bodies and I felt the sudden urge to vomit. Agent Rosgo began to fire, spraying countless bullets into the man’s chest. He was pushed back slightly with the force of each bullet, but his skin rapidly grew back over each wound, and he began to approach us.\n\n“Run!” Agent Rosgo said. “I’ll distract him. Get to the thirteenth floor, both of you!” So we ran. As Aleister and I ascended the stairs in a panic, I heard hideous shrieks echoing from behind us, and then everything went deathly silent.\n\nWe sprinted up all thirteen floors, panting and heaving from the exertion, but ran into no one else. As we slowly crept forwards towards the room where I knew the shaman was located, I began to be suspicious at the lack of creatures. Perhaps they had all already made it outside, or perhaps another wave was coming but hadn’t yet arrived.\n\nI peered around the doorway and saw the shaman, still on the gurney, naked, his eyes dilated and staring up at the ceiling. The IV drip continuously ran more of the drug into his veins. I saw the bag labeled “Salvinorin ethoxy alpha-C” was already half-empty. I crept closer to the shaman, Aleister standing behind me, and began to undo the medical tape around the IV site before pulling the needle out. The shaman suddenly realized I was there, his hateful eyes turning to stare daggers at me.\n\n“You!” he said.\n\n“Please, sir,” I said, “we have to stop whatever is going on here. I am sorry for what they put you through, but I was just doing my job. I had no ill will towards you.” He laughed maniacally at this.\n\n“No ill will! You people kidnapped me, tortured me, stripped me naked, pumped me full of drugs, and you say ‘no ill will’.” He snorted. “You are all the same. You will never learn until your world ends as a result of your stupidity and evil.” I looked beyond him to the huge metal door, still standing open a thousand feet down the shimmering, illusory hallway that had been created by the powers of the shaman’s mind.\n\n“How do we close the door?” Aleister asked bluntly. The shaman laughed.\n\n“Only the blood of a righteous man can close the door,” he said. “And I don’t think we have any of those here, do we, *Dr. Salem*?” He looked closer at me. “Your blood would be so impure and evil it would only force it open wider. The forces of Hell are gathering, and the next wave will soon break through. If you don’t close the door now, you will never have another chance.” I looked at Aleister, wondering.\n\n“You said you never killed or harmed an innocent person,” I said to him. He nodded. “You never took any bribes? Never broke any ethical codes at all?”\n\n“No, as I said, I don’t want my Creator to judge me as…” I waved this away.\n\n“You’re the one who needs to close the door,” I said. I pulled a pocketknife from my pants, looking at the shaman. “How does he do this?”\n\n“Just slice your arm and let the blood flow on the threshold of the doorway,” the shaman said to Aleister. “And you better hurry… I hear them drawing closer.” Aleister shook his head.\n\n“My wife and daughter live nearby,” he said in a panic. “We can’t let any more of those things out.” I pushed him towards the door.\n\n“Then go!” I yelled. “Do what you have to.”\n\nAleister began to sprint blindly towards the door. I heard a rumble like an earthquake, then beyond the threshold I saw hordes of demons rushing towards the doorway. As they came within feet of the door, Aleister put his left arm out over the threshold, took the knife, and brutally slashed himself open.\n\nThe blood began to drip and pool instantly around the threshold. I heard screaming from beyond, from the demons of Hell, then Aleister was blown back, as if hit by an invisible car, and went sprawling. The metal door slammed close, then the entire hallway began to shimmer and wink out of existence.\n\nSoon, we were back in the original room, just the shaman and me and an unconscious Aleister. I pulled my phone out and called for help. The military sent a Lifestar helicopter to land and take Aleister to a nearby hospital for stitches and a medical review of his other injuries.\n\nI helped untie the shaman, found some clothes to dress him in, and led him outside. \n\n“Do you think it’s over?” I asked him. He looked at me, his eyes still brimming with hatred and disgust.\n\n“As long as there’s people like you in the world,” he said, “it will never be over.”",

        "text": "\n\nThey may be a child selling flowers on the side of a run down street, or even a scruffy-looking man stood by a market stall flogging fake branded t-shirts. It doesn’t matter in what situation you are in, do not, under any circumstances give them the time. Make an excuse, run or just say nothing.\n\nMy name is Tom and I came face to face with one of them 4 years ago, me and Scott were out in town on our way to the sports bar to watch the game. As we rounded the corner onto our destined street, Cherry Road, we were suddenly approached by a frail man. He had smokey-grey thinning hair and a rugged world-weary face. His shabby, brown, moth-eaten suit jacket hung upon his tired body, as he tightly clutched a case full of jewellery. \n\n“Anything take your fancy, kind sirs?” He said brandishing yellow stained uneven teeth. \n\n“No, thank you” I swiftly replied as I raised my hand up towards him.\n\n“Are you sure? Not even a lovely pair of diamond earrings for a special lady?” He quickly contended while moving into our path. \n\n“We said we were fine, please move out of our way” Scott sneered back at him as he swerved his body around the gaunt looking pest.\n\n“Can you at least tell me the time?” The man called out as we continued along our path. \n\nScott glanced at his phone, turned and shouted back, \n\n“12:15”\n\nWe both then crossed the road and headed towards the illuminated sign of the bar.\n\nThough it appeared strange in this day and age that someone would ask the time, seeing the amount of technology we have around us. We both grew up in a era of wrist watches and wall clocks, so we weren’t to unfamiliar with this question. As harmless as that man’s query was, the following days were not. \n\nAfter the game had finished in our favour, we proceeded to keep the beers flowing in celebration, well into that evening. I am still not sure how I got home that night but I certainly remember how I was awoke the next morning. My phone vibrated frantically on my cabinet, as my generic ringtone charmed me from my slumber. I groggily woke up and answered, my voice husky and irregular.\n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Tom, are you up?”\n\n“Scott, is that you?” I said still trying to adjust my eyes.\n\n“Yes, something weird happened to me last night man” he replied seemingly full of energy.\n\n“Do you even remember last night?” I responded while chuckling.\n\n“Tom, no, listen, you know that old annoying man, the guy trying to sell us jewellery yesterday?” He came back in a calm but serious tone.\n\n“Yeah, he was weird, what about him?” I quizzically asked.\n\n“I saw him down my road as I was walking home last night. I had turned onto my street and he was there, just standing at the bus stop” Scott said now talking in a faster and more eccentric manner.\n\n“That’s pretty strange dude but probably just a coincidence, he was at a bus stop after all” I responded, trying to bring a rational conclusion to the situation. \n\n“Yeah, That’s what I thought at first but all of the busses in our area had stopped by the time we left at 10:45” Scott eagerly came back challenging my hypothesis. \n\n“I think you are reading to much into this bro, it’s not like he was at your door or anything!” I jokingly said, trying to ease Scott’s concerns. \n\n“Plus, you were drinking, quite a lot if I remember correctly!” I continued. \n\n“You’re probably right, it just unnerved me a bit that’s all” he replied now seeming to accept the situation for what it was. \n\nWe both had plans that day, he was out with his girlfriend Danielle and I had to go to my parents for dinner with my wife Samantha. I didn’t get much time during weekdays to socialise, as I worked long hours for an insurance company. This meant I didn’t speak to Scott again until the Thursday night. I had got home from work and was about to sit down to eat with Samantha when my phone rang. \n\n“Hey, what’s up?” I answered, while my wife glared at me.\n\n“Tom, I saw him again, he was in the office block window next to mine just staring at me!” Scott frantically started blurting out at me.\n\n“Scott, chill man, are you sure it was him?” I asked while trying to calm him once again. \n\n“It was him, I remember that face and that office, it’s empty, it’s been up for let for like 5 months or so!”\n\nI looked at Samantha, shook my head and shrugged, I walked into my living room. \n\n“He may just have another job as a decorator or something, and just so happened to be working at that office. He might have recognised you from Saturday, that might be why he was looking at you” I reassuringly explained.\n\n“Hmmm, Yeah, I suppose. I have been under a lot of stress at work, with the whole takeover and all of the redundancies” Scott replied, his tiredness now filtering through into his voice. \n\n“I’m just about to eat, so I’ve got to go man, see you Saturday, yeah?” I finished up our conversation while Samantha peered into the room, gesturing me to come eat. \n\n“Ok sorry bro, of course, see you Saturday. I’ll be round to yours around 2” Scott said now in a more relaxed manner. \n\n“No problem man, anytime, see ya then” I hung up the phone while wandered back into my kitchen. \n\n“What was that all about?” Samantha said while cutting into the tender beef joint. \n\n“Nothing, just Scott keeps thinking that he’s seeing some old Jewellery salesman everywhere” I replied. \n\n“That’s weird, has he got a stalker then?!” She said while letting out a small laugh.\n\n“Apparently so, it’s probably his wild imagination though, you know how he gets” I said back to her humorously. \n\nWe continued our evening meal and settled down for the night in front of a rom-com, we eventually went to bed at about 11pm. The next morning I awoke to a few missed calls from Scott, my phone had been on silent during the night and me being a heavy sleeper, I didn’t wake. The three calls were made at 00:15, 00:20 and 01:14, I immediately thought that there was an emergency and called him back. The rhythmic calling tone sounded for a minute before cutting to his voicemail. I tried a few more times throughout the morning, he wasn’t answering. Just before I was going to drive to his as I left work at 6pm he called me. \n\n“Scott, what’s going on man?!” I quickly answered. \n\n“Sorry bro, I went into work and forgot my phone” Scott replied in a dejected voice. \n\n“You called me a couple of times last night, what happened?” I said, now quite concerned.\n\n“The guy, he was at my window last night, just staring. I called you, then the police, I didn’t know what else to do” he said in between deep sighs.\n\n“Shit man, are you ok?! Did they get him?” I replied feeling guilty that I hadn’t believed his previous worries.\n\n“Naah, the police came round and checked around my place but didn’t find anyone. I’m okay, just a bit freaked out that’s all, I’m just glad this week was done with to be honest” he said before letting out a deep sigh. \n\n“Yeah, well let me know if anything happens tonight and I’ll come over, is Danielle not with you?” I asked.\n\n“No, she’s been away all week with work, I will catch up with you when I see you tomorrow” he said, while trying to tie our conversation up. \n\n“Okay man, as long as your good” I said not quite believing his calmed demeanour. \n\nI went home half expecting another call from him that night, he surely wasn’t doing well. I even thought about going round to check on him, but I didn’t want to invade his evening. I woke the next day to no missed calls, to my relief. The police must have scared the intruder off I thought. Scott would be over later today to watch the game, and Samantha was going over to her friends for a baby shower. \n\nThe time was nearing 3pm and the game would be starting soon, where was Scott? I thought while checking my phone. I called him a couple of times, growing more and more concerned every time. Each ring I was met with his  infuriating voicemail. The game started but my attention was in my own racing negative thoughts on what may have happened. Half an hour later my open ended questions were answered. My phone began to ring ‘Unknown number’. \n\n“Hello?”\n\n“Good afternoon sir, am I speaking with a Tom Greenfield?” An official sounding voice answered. \n\n“Erm, yes, who am I speaking too sorry” I hesitantly replied, expecting it to be just another cold caller. \n\n“This is Detective Harmer, there has been an incident involving a Mr Scott Taylor, I believe you were due to meet with him today, is that correct?”\n\n“What, yes, he was supposed to come round, is he okay?!” I choked back, a lump now forming at the back of my throat.\n\n“Unfortunately he was involved in an incident earlier today and we would need you to come down to the police station. We will explain everything once you get here”.\n\nI agreed and hung up the phone, I started to tremble as I feared the worse. The drive over to the police department was a blur, a terrifying, sickening blur. I pulled up outside and hesitantly went up to the desk. They called the detective over from the back office, I noticed Danielle, Scott’s girlfriend was sat in the corner, her eyes red raw, with flowing tears running down her blotchy face. The detective led me into a small room with a large rectangular mirror. He went on to tell me how Scott was involved in an RTA at 12:15 today, on the corner of Cherry Road and Oakwood Street. He regrettably passed away at the scene. \n\nMy eyes began to fill as I buried my head into my shaking hands, I managed to compose myself after a few moments. \n\n“How did it happen?” I managed to ask, my voice quavering through my tears. \n\nThe detective began to say that there was no explainable reason why Scott lost control of the vehicle, they were busy looking over CCTV and dash-cam footage to decipher cause.\n\nI waited with Scott’s parents and Danielle, each of us consoling one another just as Samantha arrived. I latched onto her as I broke down on what had become the worse day of my life. \n\nThe next day we were all called back to the station, as there was an update on the investigation. We sat anxiously awaiting the pending news, and ultimately some answers. We were each called in one by one, to that same daunting room. I sat down as Detective Harmer showed me the dash-cam footage from the vehicle behind Scott’s BMW. I saw Scott pass the sports bar we had been drinking in, only a week before. My drifting, now upsetting memories were suddenly interrupted, as I watched the small monitor. His car neared the corner just as someone slowly emerged from his back seat, they then lunged their arm around Scott’s neck as the car began to swerve. The screeching tyres and smoke seemed to radiate from the screen in front of me. The video then stopped before the fatal impact. \n\n“Who the fuck is that?!” I shouted, while my breathing grew deeper and more erratic. \n\n“We were hoping you could tell us?” The detective replied. \n“We are aware that Mr Taylor had seen a man throughout the week that he believed was following him” He continued.\n\n“Play the video again” I hastily said. \n\nI watched in horror as I focused on the person in the back seat, he had smokey-grey thinning hair and was dressed in shabby an old brown suit jacket. That’s when I realised, it was the man that was trying to sell us the jewellery. \n\n“It’s him, the man Scott said was following him” I said while pointing at the screen. \n\n“Was he in the car as well when you found Scott?” I continued.\n\n“No, that’s the thing, there was nobody else in the car with Mr Taylor when we arrived. Nor did any witnesses see any other people leave the vehicle” the detective said in a puzzled tone.\n\nI began to explain to him our brief encounter with the man, saying how we had declined the jewellery and Scott had just given him the time after the man asked. I then paused and looked at the stopped dash-cam footage, the time showed 12:14:58. It was only then that it dawned on me, a seemingly unlocked memory came to mind.\nWhy did the salesman ask the time, when in his case, sat a row of silver plated watches?\n\nWhen I had no more information to give the detective I was allowed to leave, I had a mixture of sadness, anger and confusion pulsating through my brain, all this anguish all at once. \n\nI spent the next few days searching for any sort of logical answer to this madness. I stumbled upon a few other stories in my obsessive search, as I went down the ‘unexplained’ rabbit hole. Each experience I read, was told how a stranger had asked the time to an unexpected victim, normally a friend or a family member. Once they had given them the time, they had unwillingly scheduled in, their own death, exactly a week later, in the same location that they answered. It also described the torment the victim had endured leading up to their demise. Many described the people as demonic predators sent to this world to capture souls for the devil, while others spoke of inter dimensional entities that fed on the chase of the hunt and  eventually the kill of their prey. \n\nMany of the experiences sounded all too familiar and yet it couldn’t possibly be real, the things these people were talking about did not exist, they just, couldn’t exist. \n\nWhatever happened to Scott in my eyes was a tragedy, but I can say with full confidence if a stranger asks me the time again, I will say nothing and get as far away from them as possible.",

I don't know how to handle this situation, and I'm both afraid and paranoid. This whole situation has been affecting my daily life, and I feel completely lost. Any advice would be appreciated regarding this, I barely feel safe in my own home anymore. I'll explain what happened recently to cause me to feel this way below. I also have some previous posts on my account and a link to my YouTube channel where I go more in-depth on stuff that is going on so you guys can get a better picture of what I'm going through right now.\n\nI had an old Rottweiler-Pitt Bull mix named Wyatt. I’ve had him since I was a baby, he was probably around 16-17. Huge dog, around 120lbs, but a big softie. He was very protective of me, and he would even chase away foxes and coyotes back when we had chickens. He would never hurt anyone, unless they tried to harm me or my animals. I would let him outside every few hours or so to prevent him from having any accidents inside the house because he was getting older and couldn't really control his bladder. He also had bad arthritus so I would have to help him up if he layed down. He usually would stay outside for 10 minutes or so (sometimes longer so he could lay in the sun,) then he scratches at the door to be let back in. No barking or anything, he only barked to alert me if something or someone he didn't recognize was outside. I let him out about 2 weeks ago in the evening, he never scratched on the door. After 45 minutes or so I began to get worried, so I went out to check on him. I spent a good 20 minutes searching before I found his body behind my shed, his head torn off from his body. I couldn’t find his head.\n\nHis body had no bite marks and no wounds, just his head ripped off. It wasn’t a clean slice, like a sword; it was like it was TORN. There was no signs of struggle around, and I didn’t hear him yelp or bark, absolutely nothing. Just a pretty big puddle of what looked like fresh blood under him and around his neck where his head was torn off. I have no idea how long he was dead for before I found him, but his body was still kind of warm and stiff, like he hadn't been dead for that long. He also had fresh blood under him, and seemed to still be bleeding a bit from his neck. Safe to say I booked it out of there, and only came back the next day to retrieve his body and bury him.\n\nThis same exact thing happened to my cat Smokey a while back, but he was covered in bite marks. I came to the conclusion it was probably coyotes, as those are pretty common around here. I don't know if it's just me being paranoid, but I think both of them dying very similarly must mean they were connected in some way. But, I don't think coyotes can just kill a 120lbs dog without any sounds or struggling, let alone tearing his head off of his body. I'm not sure what could've killed them anymore. I don't have any wolves nearby, so the safest conclusion that I can come up with is some human. But then again, a human doesn't leave canine bite marks. I've also been considering that creepy ass deer could be the cause for their deaths, but I don't want to think about that thing right now.\n\nSpeaking of the deer, I haven't actually seen it around recently. I saw it once really late at night, I'm talking maybe 1:00am. It was just standing near my pool on all fours, it's jaw just hanging. I don't know if it was just difficult to see because it was night, but it looks like it lacks eyes now?? I can't tell if this is the same deer that is somehow changing, or if it's several different deer. I don't think it saw me when I peeked out of the blinds, it was just slowly walking around and making these weird gurgling sounds. That was 2 days before Wyatt was killed, and I haven't seen it since.\n\nAside from that, I also had 2 of my cats dead a month or so back, too. Their heads weren’t torn off, but they were laid in front of my door in a way that means they could’ve only be placed there by someone or something. They were laying on top of eachother, streached out with their nose touching the others tail, right in front of my front door.\n\nI’ve called the cops, and they’ve come to my house and told me they literally cannot do anything without evidence of someone being on my property. They told me not to worry too much because it probably was coyotes or some stray dogs. I’ve set up 4 motion detection security cameras around my property, and the cops recommended that I leave the house until I feel safe. I’m currently staying upstate in a motel until I feel safe enough to return. My friend Malory is watching the animals for me.\n\nI’m just really scared and don’t know what to do. I already set up cameras and I’m staying upstate for a few days to get my bearings back, but I just feel so uncomfortable and unsafe in my home. Any advice on what I can do to protect myself and my animals would be appreciated.\n\nAlso, as a quick side note; if someone who is reading this did this to my poor animals and you're unlucky enough that I catch you, I'll slith your throat then rip your head off like you did to my animals. You don't deserve to rest easy at night knowing what you've done, and I'll make sure that you die slowly and painfully. Rot in hell.",

        "text": "I just moved into a new home, a beautiful, remodeled house with a grand entrance and a sprawling lawn. I was so excited to start their new life and spent the following weeks unpacking and decorating. But there was something strange about the house that I couldn't quite put my finger on.\n\nIt started with a door. The first time I noticed it was in the hallway. It was an old wooden door with intricate carvings, and I assumed it led to a storage space or a closet. I tried to open the door but, found that the handle was missing. So, I left the door alone and continued to unpack figured I would investigate it in the morning. \n\nThe next day, the door was gone. There was no sign of it in the hallway or anywhere else in the house. I searched the entire place, but there was no trace of the door. Tired and exhausted I shrugged it off thinking I might have been imagining the door with no handle after all it the placing didn’t make sense.\n\nBut then the door started appearing and disappearing at random places around the house. Sometimes it would be in the living room, other times in the master bedroom. And every time I tried to open it the handle would be gone. \n\nOne day, I was sitting in the living room when the door appeared in front of me. This time it was open. Inside I could see a dark, shadowy space beyond. I hesitated for a moment, but then curiosity got the better of me. I stepped through the door and found that other side was beyond anything I could have imagined.\n\nThe room was dark and foreboding, and I could hear strange cries coming from the distance. The walls were made of flesh, and strange writhing tendrils snaked through out the space. I tried to step back through the door, but to my horror it was gone. \n\nI stumbled through the pulsating flesh room, calling out for help, but no one answered. The whispers grew louder, and the shadows seemed to be closing in. And then, I saw it. The door, it was back, just as suddenly as it had disappeared. I rushed towards it, desperate to escape.\n\nWhen I stepped through the door, I realized I was in a similar area which looked like the inside of a living being. The air was thick with the stench of decay. The door started to disappear as the flesh surrounding the walls consumed it. I tried to run, but the walls seemed to be trapping me, pushing me forward. I came to the horrible realization that I was inside a creature, the house like an angler fish with its light had lured me with the door. \n\nAs I wandered through the living, breathing nightmare, I heard a voice. It was the voice of a person who claimed was owner of the house, a man who had disappeared without a trace just a few months ago. He explained how the house was ancient, it had been at the same location for thousands of years. The exterior changes but the house is always the same. In the past there was a group that worshipped the house and it fed of human sacrifices. Now the house has evolved to feed itself. \n\nI knew they had to find a way out. We continued forward until reaching a dead end, and then I noticed hundreds of bodies absorbed by the house. Their bodies stuck inside of the walls, their eyes moving but their bodies standing still, only their cries could be heard. \n\nThe walls started to constrict, I screamed in terror, as our surrounding started to collapse, absorbing the previous owner’s life force until he too became part of the walls. From the corner of my eye, I noticed a door come out of the house’s fleshy walls.  The door standing still waiting for its next victim. Desperate I sprinted to the door, upon opening it I was relieved to find myself back into the original part of house.  \n\nI will never set a foot near the house, I will never come near it. I have received offers to buy the house, but I can’t subject another person to the trauma I lived. For now, all I can do is leave the house vacant so no one else will fall prey to the to its horrors.

        "text": "Ever since Tom the morpher transformed me I have lost my family and most of my friends. I’ve only managed to keep a few friends, all of them online, and life has been very hard these days.\n\nYesterday I was on my phone when one of my friends started to text me. “i found a funny video 81Ghyi4GHi7#&amp;n” I did not understand what that meant. I had head of these numbers for years, haunting me everywhere. It was always an unlucky code. I once when I was 15, while I curiously explored the old, abandoned side of town, freshly painted on the walls of the old train station. Then I got pneumonia. Then when I was 20 I saw it sprayed on my neighbour’s van while I was going for a nice walk. Then I got hit by car. The third time I saw it was when I was 25. I found it at the bottom of a sports web page just minutes before the death of my mother. I am now 30, and I was terrified of what would happen next.\n\nMy three other friends quickly gave me the same message, word for word. I decided to ask “are you sure it’s not that unlucky one” to all four. In the meantime I grew strangely suspicious and curious of what that video was. “Maybe I should watch it” I thought to myself. Soon I got the same response from all of my friends: “Just watch it.” After a while I started to think that I should look up what this really was. I knew I had seen those numbers, but not as a video. Slowly I started to get the feeling that the number was never the cause of my misfortunes. It could not sleep at night without watching that video. Something was happening here. In the middle of night, I tiredly picked up my phone with the urge to finally get some sleep and watch that thing. I searched for the code and found the video.\n\nAt the start I was disappointed, seeing nothing but different flashing images of randomly coloured pixels with white noise as sound. I was about to stop watching when I felt that perhaps I should continue, to see what it was. Maybe it lead up to a joke. The joke never came, yet the excitement grew larger.\n\nI could not stop watching. It felt as though the video was controlling me. I got thirstier hour after hour, continuing to watch a video that seemed infinite. I was still sitting on the sofa, without moving. First came thirst, then hunger and then tiredness. Then I needed to go to work. Then I had a dentist appointment. Then I was supposed to go to my friend’s house. None of that happened. I did not move from that sofa. Then I messaged every contact I could find saying “i found a funny video 81Ghyi4GHi7#&amp;n” I need to move but I can’t. I feel stuck to my chair. I don’t know what has happened. Help me. The video seems to be forcing me to tell this. I just can’t stop typing, as though an outer force is controlling me. I need help!\n\nWatch  81Ghyi4GHi7#&amp;n.",

        "text": "Connor pulled a cigarette out of his pocket and looked across their campground, quietly nestled inside a forest in the Colorado rockies. He gestured with his hand wildly at the distant orange glow of the other camp - the girl camp’s - fire, speaking in a thick Irish accent that was slurred with the copious amounts of alcohol he had previously downed. “Don’t you think that’s a bit close eh?”  \n Miles glanced at his friend sideways and shook his head, “Connor, our camp and there are plenty far apart. Plus,” He grunted, “Even *you’re* not dumb enough to go across that gully at night. Heaven knows what’s in it.”  \n Connor squinted his eyes, “Aye. Coyotes or somethin’ rotten.”  \n There was an uncomfortable moment of silence as Connor took one last drawn out sip from his bottle of whiskey. With a satisfied grunt, he placed the now-empty bottle on the ground next to the ever-expanding pile of beer cans and whiskey bottles that reflected the light off of their own campfire. “When I was a young lad I could run er, say three times that distance!” He leaned forward and placed the end of his cigarette in the flames of the campfire, “Besides Miles, this camp is full er lads much stupider than I. They might just try it!”  \n Miles shrugged his shoulders, “I have my doubts. They’re plenty mature, definitely not stupid. Not enough to go try and spy on some girls. Heck, some of them drove themselves here and that’s *plenty* more than you can do.”  \n Connor blew smoke out of his mouth, “I drove myself here didn't I?” The smoke blew back in his face, sending him into a coughing fit.  \n Miles raised an eyebrow, “You sure aren’t driving yourself back.”  \n “Oh?”  \n “Look at you man! You aren’t the prime example of a healthy person are you?”  \n Connor laughed between wheezing chokes, “Ah! I’m not in my prime now am I!”  \n Miles chuckled and took a sip of his root beer, “That pacemaker of yours still running smooth?”  \n Connor looked up at the full moon that illuminated both the campground, and the expression of contemplation that rested on his face. “Mmmm.” He looked down, “Something’s not right.”  \n Mile’s smile faded, “With your pacemaker?”  \n “No…No... Not the pacemaker.” Connor started tipping the empty cans and bottles over one by one, “...Just feel like somethin’ missing.”\n\n“Something?”  \n Connor knocked over a few more bottles, mouthing something as each one fell to the ground with a *clink*. He paused on the last one, and then frowned, looking up at Miles. “How many bottles did I drink?”  \n “I’d say four? Why?”  \n “Ah… I’a brought five.”  \n Connor flicked his spent cigarette into the fire’s flames. A faint cheering echoed through the night air, warm as the light illuminating the inside of a large tent some fifty feet away from where they stood. “I think I might know wher’ it is.”  \n\\---\n\n“Who’s got the bottle!”  \n The tent was packed with boys - fifteen at least - all members of the camp, all whooping and laughing in reply, “You!”  \n One boy hoisted a bottle of whiskey high into the air above his head, and grinned wildly, “And who am I?”  \n “Tyler!”  \n He took a swig out of the bottle, “And who has the bottle!”  \n “Us!” The tent shook violently.  \n Tyler shoved the cork back on top of the bottle’s neck and shouted, “And who wants it next!”  \n A cacophony of different voices yelling their names filled the tent, covering up the sound of footsteps that grew closer to them with every second that passed. Tyler tossed the bottle back and forth between his hands, “Loudest person gets it!” He laughed, feeding on the group’s energy, “Who’s got the bottle boys!”  \n “Tyler!”  \n A gust of chilly night air sliced through the tent as the door flap flew open. The group quieted as Connor stepped in through the open tent flap, face twisted into a scowl as icy as the draft. “Aye, Indeed you lil’ *rats*!”  \n Connor pushed his way through the crowd of boys, grabbed Tyler by the collar of his whiskey stained coat jacket, and yanked him out of the tent. The bottle of whiskey flew out of Tyler’s hands and shattered on the cold dirt-covered ground. Shrapnel and spirits ricocheted into the air and splattered over Connor’s pant leg. He narrowed his eyes, “Lad, yer gonna pay for that.”  \n The sound of footsteps followed as Miles ran in. He bent over and rested his hands on his knees, gasping in exhaustion. “How did you *run* that fast?”  \n Connor ignored the question and pinned Tyler under the boot of his foot. “And you said these lad’s weren’t stupid eh?” He pointed at Tyler, “This lad seems stupid to me!”  \n He shifted his weight onto the boy’s shoulder, making him squirm. “Chill out Connor!,” He grimaced, “God that hurts. I wasn’t going to-”  \n Connor flashed him a hostile look, “Drink it?”  \n Tyler stopped squirming, “Uh, yeah. I didn’t drink it or nothin’. Honest! I was uh, just having some fun you know? With the guys!”  \n Connor pressed his boot down hard on Tyler’s shoulder, making the boy cry out in pain, “Right.”  \n Miles shoved him off of Tyler, “That’s *enough* Connor.” He rubbed his temple, “I’ll send him to go grab another one out of your pickup truck. It’s far and the case is heavy. Should be good enough punishment.”  \n “Aye, and what if he runs off with it?”\n\n“I’ll… send my nephew with him. He’s a good kid.”  \n “Chris? That shrimp!” Connor threw his head back in laughter, “Aw, Miles ye crack me up.”  \n “I’m not trying to.”  \n Connor wheezed, “Aye but ye do. Ye do.”  \n Tyler chimed in from the ground, “I think it’s funny too Mil-”  \n Connor stopped laughing and glared at Tyler, “Shut it lad. Nobody asked for *your* opinion.”  \n “Sorry. *Sir*.”  \n Connor raised his foot up in the air again, but Miles shut him down with some panicked hand gestures. “Everyone just shut up. I swear, sometimes it feels like I’m babysitting toddlers around here.” He reached his arm out and offered it to Tyler. “Get up.”  \n Tyler grabbed Mile’s outstretched hand and pulled himself up to his feet. He dusted his jeans off with his hands and then folded his arms in satisfaction, “Thanks.”  \n Connor rolled his eyes, “Don’t thank *him*. Yer about to run an errand for *me* lad.”  \n “Oh. Right.”  \n Connor pointed to the dirty table behind him and made eye contact with Miles, “I’m going to clean this up while yer two wake up the shrimp lad.”  \n Miles sighed and started walking off in the opposite direction with Tyler. The boy drudged along the path reluctantly as they walked, the mood permeated by the pale white glow of the moon, illuminating the cloudless sky. The walk felt abnormally long, and the awkward lack of conversation between Tyler and Miles started to occupy the back of Mile’s mind like a fog, clouding his confidence. He could only feel relief when they finally reached the small two-person tent. Miles unzipped the tent door and turned on his flashlight, poking his head inside. The tents were incredibly disorganized and messy. Plastic bags and crushed empty soda cans littered the tent’s inside edges. In the center, two crumpled sleeping bags laid horizontally across a large sleeping mat. One empty, Miles’s. The other, occupied with Chris, curled up and fast asleep, softly snoring. Miles spoke with a voice just louder than a whisper, “Hey, Chris? I need your help.”  \n The Chris-shaped lump occupying the sleeping bag let out a faint mumble.  \n “I’ll let you choose tomorrow’s breakfast?”  \n Another mumble.  \n Miles tilted his head, “And I’ll get you dinner on the drive back.”  \n Chris sat up and grinned with his eyes closed, “Deal.”  \n Miles could hear the tent rustle and sway as Chris climbed out of his dirty sleeping bag, walking over to put his boots on. His long, blonde hair poofed up into the air from the tent’s static buildup, and his face was smeared with something -probably chocolate - evident of whatever snack he had eaten before dozing off.   \n Tyler leaned on a nearby tree tapping his foot impatiently. “Hurry up man, what are you? Eight? Does your uncle Miles need to help tie your shoes?”  \n Chris poked his head through the tent flap and stuck his tongue out at Tyler, “Twelve. And no,” He stepped out on the dirt-covered ground, “He doesn't.”  \n Tyler smirked and walked a short ways off, face shadowed despite the pale moonlight. “Come on.” He looked at Miles, “An escort? Dude, I’m sixteen.”  \n Miles shrugged, “You’re also dumb enough to take some of Connor’s whiskey. You should be lucky you got away from him without anything broken. Plus,” He patted Chris firmly on the back, “This guy will keep you safe.”  \n Chris winced, “Yeah.” \n\nTyler threw his hands up in the air, “Let’s just get this over with.”  \n Miles shouted at him as the two started walking off, “And no sneaking over to the girl’s camp!”  \n “Sure camp director. Whatever.”   \n Satisfied, Miles watched as Chris and Tyler slowly moved out of view down the poorly lit forest trail. He quietly let out a sigh of relief and turned around to start walking back to the center of the camp. Only five steps forward however, he paused. A sickening feeling of unease slowly crawled up his spine, creeping into his head. Permeating his every thought. It was almost as if a diseased hand had clamped over his consciousness. Perturbed, he turned back around and stepped back into his tent. Reaching though the clutter, he grabbed a small metal safe that rested next to his sleeping bag. He stuck his hand inside his coat pocket and pulled out a set of polished keys and fumbled through them. His finger rested on a red key, and with a slight tremble in his hands, he stuck it inside the keyhole. With his worry rising, he twisted the key and unlocked the safe. A fully loaded handgun rested inside, its shiny barrel gleaming softly in the moonlight. He flipped the safety on and slipped the gun into his pocket, stepping back out of the tent.  \n\\---  \n Connor cringed at the grimy mess that caked the wood-log dinner table, “Miles, don’t ye think we should have the laddies take care of this one?”  \n Miles paused momentarily and then resumed scrubbing the gas grill down. His focus directed to cleaning solely to combat the uncanny sense of unease he felt, “We *are* the camp directors Connor. And I just dismissed them to their tents for the night.”  \n “Aye I know, I know. Just hate this kinda thing.”  \n “Tell me about it.”  \n He tossed the steel wool he was using into a nearby black plastic bag and stood up, glancing around his shoulder. The darkness of the night seemed to envelop the campground, everything felt claustrophobic, despite the openness of their location. Miles shuddered.  \n Connor noticed the expression and set his towel down on the table. “Miles, friend, ye alrite’?”  \n Miles  turned his head back around to look at Connor, “How long have Tyler and Chris been gone?”  \n “Oh, an hour an’ a half or so. Why are ye askin’?”  \n “Connor, that’s too long.”  \n “There be something on your mind, innit?” Connor asked.  \n “Yeah. I feel terrible sending them off without an adult. What if something happened?”  \n “I doubt it,” He paused, putting his hand to his chin, “Though your lad is a bit small isn’t he?”  \n “Not helping.”  \n “Sorry, point is they’re alright. That whisky of mine is’a heavy stuff, and in more ways than one. Takes time for sure to carry it over.” He jabbed his finger at Miles’s chest, “So that means a’nuf worrying.”  \n Miles sighed, “Probably yeah. Still, something feels wrong.”  \n Connor nodded, “Aye, I feel it too.”  \n He froze, “What?”  \n “Feeling' o dread. Haven’t felt anything like it before. Not about the laddies though.” Connor looked up at the sky and squinted, “Miles, do you remember what phase the moon were?”  \n Miles frowned, confused. “Full moon, why?”  \n “Well it’s gone.”  \n Miles’s heart sank. Slowly he turned his head and looked up at the sky. The moon *was* gone. The stars, the clouds, *everything.* Every single thing in the sky that had illuminated their surroundings only moments ago had disappeared. Completely absent from existence. Miles’s world seemed frozen in silence, like the peaceful calm before a catastrophic storm. No birds chirped, no crickets sang.  \n The only light that still existed was the beam of his flashlight and the two campfires. One within their campsite, the other far more distant, faintly wrapping the girl’s camp in a flickering, warm glow.  \n Such warmth was absent in Miles’s mind, his every thought laced with an icy feeling of doom. In the dim flashlight’s glow he could see Connor instinctively reach for a cigarette in his pocket. Connor’s hand lingered there for a moment, and then abruptly clutched his chest, a flash of pain shooting across his friend’s rough face.  \n Miles’s flashlight flickered off.  \n Silence was broken by a sudden incredibly high pitched noise that pierced through the inky black darkness like a firework, mixing chaotically with the sound of Connor screaming out in pain.  \n With a *thud* Connor collapsed to the ground, and the night faded back into perfect silence. In a panic, Miles fumbled forward trying desperately to find his friend. A handful of dirt, a shirt, a body. His hand connected with Connor’s neck, and he frantically checked for a pulse. Where movement should have been, was stillness, and where the familiar beat of a heart and the whirr of a pacemaker should have resided, was nothing. The only thing present was Connor’s quickly fading body heat. “What the hell. *What the hell.*”  \n A scream echoed off in the distance as a hand grabbed his shoulder tightly. Miles recoiled backwards in shock, slamming against whoever, *whatever* had touched him. Spinning around he faced his supposed opponent. In the darkness, he thought he could faintly make out the form of a boy - one of the camp’s attendees - clutching a phone close to his chest.\n\nThe boy’s voice was tainted with concern, “Camp leader Miles? Are you okay?”  \n “What? No! Absolutely not.” He pointed a finger at the barely visible shape of the boy’s phone, “Call an ambulance, *now*. Camp director Connor’s pacemaker isn’t-” He checked his friend’s pulse again, “Still nothing… Make the call!”\n\nThey boy’s voice tightened, “I can’t”  \n Miles felt a surge of confusion, “Of course you can! Isn’t your phone right there?”  \n “That’s why I came over here in the first place.” He paused, “Nothings working. Phones, flashlights. Everything electronic.”  \n “Just give me your phone.”  \n “But it-”  \n “Give it to me!”  \n Miles yanked the phone out of the boy’s hand and started pressing the power button down, desperately trying, and failing to bring life back to the phone. Maybe he could revive it if he… *Revive.* Panic stabbed through Miles’s mind as his attention turned back to his friend lying lifeless on the ground beneath him. Still warm, for now. He quickly turned to look at the boy, “Kid? Do you know how to do chest compressions?”  \n “It’s Mark, and yeah, I do.”  \n Miles brought Mark over to where Connor had collapsed, his eyes only now beginning to adjust to the blinding darkness. “I’m going to take Connor’s truck and go find help,” He pointed at Mark, “You stay here and keep his blood pumping. Can you do that?”  \n Mark stared wide-eyed at Connor’s lifeless form, “I…”  \n “Mark. *Can you do that?*”  \n The boy nodded his head, and determination filled his voice. “I can.”  \n “Good. I’ll be back with help.” Miles said, “Hopefully.”  \n Without another word Miles half ran, half stumbled his way towards the dying campfire. His body ached with fatigue only further aggravated by the overwhelming, stressful feeling that something was watching his every step, trip, and bound. Despite the faint warmth of the fire he now stood beside, the night felt cold and lifeless.\n\nRummaging through a nearby pile of wood he found a stick and leaned it against the campfire’s rim of stone. Miles ripped his left shirt sleeve off and wrapped it around the end of the stick, pulling it tight. He shoved the stick into the campfire’s dying flames. With a colorful burst of light it ignited, sending ash and embers into the air alongside smoke that billowed and banished into the barren, black sky.  \n Miles flinched at the sudden heat of the torch, regardless of how comforting and safe it should have made him feel. A horrible feeling of despair rose within him as he looked down the trail where Toby and Chris had left down hours before. Tall, dead trees loomed over it, intersected by rocks laid across the dirt path haphazardly. With a shudder, he took a painful step away from the campfire and its blanketing light, and began to walk down the dreary path.  \n His torch crackled against the deafening silence that permeated the night, it’s flames casting looming shadows across overarching decaying flora. The sickeningly damp air caused beads of sweat to drip down his neck, only worsened by the torches' heat. His shirt uncomfortably clung to his back like glue. In the distance, Miles could hear an anguished sob that faintly echoed its way towards him. Every step he took brought him closer to the eerie sound, every stride bringing his fear to greater heights. He winced at every leaf and every stick he stepped on, and prayed that he could avoid alerting any unwanted attention from whatever presence he felt lurking in the shadows.\n\nThe sound grew closer, louder, until it finally peaked. Miles strained his eyes as he moved closer to the source of the noise. Lit up in the warm, yet, somehow deathly cold light of his torch, was a truck. Connor’s truck.  \n Something was wrong. *Very* wrong.  \n Blood oozed like sap from a gaping hole that completely parted through the truck's passenger side. A giant slash ripped across the roof of the vehicle, as if the wrath of an angry god had been unleashed in one brutal strike. The truck was completely wrecked beyond anything Miles had seen before. He hesitantly began walking towards the pickup truck, a distressing feeling of sickness overpowering him. The sobbing quieted as he reached his hand towards the single intact door. Blood fell down the door frame and flowed over his fingers as he grasped the doorknob and pulled, sending the door swinging open with an unsettling *pop.*\n\nTorch in hand, he stuck his head inside the truck and peered around. In the fiery orange light, he could see something, *someone,* shaking on the other side of the truck’s back seat. A boy, holding a case of whiskey tightly in his arms. Chris.  \n Miles’s eyes widened in shock, “Chris?”  \n The boy jumped, alarmed. “Uncle?” Tears welled up in his eyes, “I’m sorry, I’m really *really* sorry.”  \n Miles climbed into the truck and sat down on the other side of the backseat, resting his torch carefully on the ground outside, making sure it stayed lit. “What… happened?”  \n Chris looked down at the case in his arms and sobbed, clutching it tighter.  \n Hesitantly, Miles scooted closer and placed his hand firmly on the case Chris was holding. “Is it alright if I have that?”  \n The boy slowly released his death grip on the case of alcohol, letting him take it and carefully place it on what remained of the passenger seat. Miles scanned the interior of the truck and looked back at his nephew, “Where’s Tyler?”  \n “Something took him.” Chris pulled his legs up to his chest and sobbed harder, tears flowing down his face.  \n Miles’s heart ached seeing his nephew crying. It was all-too familiar. The boy had cried like that before. The same tears that flowed when Miles answered the door to a man bearing news. Miles’s sister had died. That *he* was left to take care of the boy. That *he* was the only one who was left. The boy left crying on his doorstep.  \n He searched his mind hoping to find something to say, something to console the boy, but his mind felt heavy with dread. Dread, and fear of whatever *thing* could have done such incomprehensible damage to Connor’s truck. He paused, and looked back at the crimson fluid leaking down the back window. *Every* window. “That’s Tyler’s blood, isn’t it.”  \n Chris nodded.  \n “When did…”  \n “I don’t know.” Chris looked up at him, “There was this… high pitched sound and Tyler said…” His voice faltered, “Tyler said he saw something. Something *really* bad.”  \n “Something?”  \n “Yeah. We went back to the truck to hide and then there was this horrible noise,” Chris’s hands clamped down onto his legs, pulling them in tighter. His tone of voice became far more distressed, “The truck started shaking, and Tyler started screaming like nothing I’ve ever heard before. Then… And…” His head fell back down to his knees and he cried.  \n Miles put his arm over Chris’s shoulder and hugged him tightly, “It’s alright kid. Whatever it was, it’s gone now. You’re safe.” The lie left a bitter sting in his mouth.  \n Chris shook his head, “It’s still out there. I know it.”  \n Miles furrowed his eyebrows, “How do you know that?”  \n “I saw it going somewhere.”  \n “What?”  \n Chris slowly sat up and turned around, wiping tears off his face with his sleeve. With his free hand, he pointed out the bloodsoaked back window of the truck. Through the glass, Miles could make out a faint point of light off in the distance. A campfire.  \n “It went that way.”  \n Miles’s neck tensed, “The girl’s camp…”  \n He shifted his body over to the open door on his left, moving to pick up his torch. He could feel his adrenaline levels spiking. Locking eyes with his nephew, he spoke. “I need to help them.”  \n Chris’s eyes immediately welled with panic, “No no no… please don’t. It’ll come back. You won’t be safe!”  \n “I know.”  \n Miles picked up the now-dimmer torch off the ground and placed it in Chris’s hand, “You,” he pointed to the torch, “Are going to take this, and walk back down the trail,” He gestured down the darkened pathway, “And tell Mark that help is *not* coming. You tell him and all the other boys at the camp to start running down to the base of the mountain.”  \n “But that thing-”  \n “That thing, whatever it is, is about to kill everyone at the other camp. I *have* to go warn them, and if you don't warn *our* camp, *all* of us are going to die.” His voice changed to pleading, “Please Chris. Trust me.”  \n Chris stared at the torch in his hand, and his face hardened, “Okay. I’ll do it.” He paused, and the corner of his mouth raised into the slightest grin, “But only if you get us all dinner after you come find us.”  \n Miles smiled faintly, “That’s a deal kid.”  \n\\---\n\nMiles stood on the edge of the wide, forested gulley that separated where he now was from the distant fire of the girl’s camp. He guessed, or rather *hoped* the gulley was shallow, despite the overwhelming darkness that made it impossible to gauge its true depth. His skin crawled at the idea of crossing it, let alone without a torch or flashlight to light the way ahead. He kept his eyes locked on the only source of illumination he *could* see; the painfully far away glow of the girl’s campfire, and said a silent prayer, beginning to make his way into the dense gulley.\n\nTree branches and weeds caught on and punctured his clothing as he walked, covering him in burrs and disgusting amounts of what he could only hope was just moss and dirt. Pain erupted from his left arm as a jagged outcrop of a boulder sliced across his bicep. He let out a quiet groan of pain. Despite the carnage he had seen only minutes before, there was something far worse about the claustrophobia of the gulley. The darkness. The silence. All suddenly disturbed by the sound of something breaking a tree branch behind him. A coyote. Maybe.  \n He quickened his pace, stepping over a mound of dirt that piled over what *felt* like dead tree stumps and pebbles. The light that was once so far away grew ever-closer, beckoning for him to reach the end. If only-   \n Miles felt his shoe latch onto an exposed tree root, and collapsed forward onto the ground with an unpleasant *thud*. Another branch broke behind him.  \n In a dazed panic, he righted himself and started running, fear overriding whatever discomfort he had felt before. Leaves and branches painfully smacked into his face while he ran, and the sound of footsteps - now nearly indistinguishable from his own - grew louder and louder. Dead foliage fell from above as he finally felt the ground beneath his feet gradually slant upward. He could feel hope. A drive. The campfire was close, *he* was close. MIles could almost feel the warmth of the fire now. Eighty feet. Forty. Ten.  \n With a burst of energy he ran out of the thicketed gulley and bolted through a small clearing towards the raging campfire. Miles caught his breath and fell to his knees, and exhaustion filled him almost immediately. The world seemed to compress down to just him and the comforting warmth of the campfire’s flames. Reality came crashing back down as the sound of a woman screaming broke through the night air.  \n He was too late.  \n Miles slowly looked down. The ground he knelt on was stained a horrible dark red, and the nauseating metallic smell of blood attacked his nose just as intensely as the fire’s heat. More screams erupted some ways off inside what he assumed was one of the camp’s tents. He could see something immense moving, bending over, and entering the tent. A series of agonized cries sounded out, and then were silenced. Miles crouched low and slowly walked away from the campfire, trying to put as much distance between himself and the tent as possible. Sneaking behind a large rock, he peeked around a corner and analyzed his surroundings.  \n A row of large tents were sprawled out near where he hid, most of them ripped open just like Connor’s truck. Others had flaps that were open, stained completely dark with blood. Cautiously he moved towards one of the tents with a partially ajar door and poked his head inside. Empty. He backed out and made his way behind another tent, hearing a tent aways off *zip* open, followed by another series of screams. He shuffled around to the front of the tent, running his hand across its side. Once he reached the front he glanced towards where the screams had come from, straining his eyes. Hoping to see something. Anything.  \n His eyes made contact. Two glowing yellow eyes stared right back at him, straight across the campground. Miles felt his soul dive down into an icy ocean of fear. Whatever that *thing* was, it had seen him.  \n The sound of a tent unzipping followed by the feeling of a pair of hands suddenly pulling him backwards shook him from his stupor. The tent door -now in front of him- closed, plunging him back into absolute darkness.\n\nMiles heard someone trying, and subsequently failing to ignite a lighter. The muffled sound of it being passed to another person preceded the light of the lighter sparking to life. He shielded his eyes, and after letting his eyes adjust to the flame, he looked around.   \n The tent was filled with girls. A *lot* of them. Most of them Miles guessed were all Tyler’s age or younger, all huddled together. In front of them a woman crouched, holding a lighter in her dark brown hand. She spoke in a panicked whisper, “Please tell me it didn’t see you.”  \n Miles flinched.  \n The woman’s face fell, “No…”  \n A girl whimpered in the corner of the tent, another sobbed while she held a small rusty pocket knife tightly in her left hand. The girl whispered, her voice filled with fear, “We’re all going to die. Aren’t we?”  \n Another girl nearby awkwardly put her arm around her, “We won’t Emily, okay? We’ll get out of here. I know it.”  \n A series of abnormally loud footsteps came from outside the tent.\n\nMiles instinctively scooted away from the tent flap and faced the woman holding the lighter. “I came to warn you all before it got here but.. When I finally made it across the gulley…”  \n The woman shook her head, “It’s been here for at least twenty minutes already. We tried fighting it off but it just kept-”  \n Another footstep shook the tent, closer this time. The woman held a finger up to her lips and flipped off the lighter. An eerie yellow glow illuminated the walls of the tent, growing gradually brighter as the monster moved closer. An unsettling half-breathing half-clicking sound moved with the light. The stink of rotting flesh mixed with the smell of blood that began to slowly seep through the tiny holes of the tent zipper, pooling on the tarp floor.  \n Miles pushed himself backwards as quietly as he could and slowly pulled his revolver out of his back pocket. He rested the gleaming firearm on his leg and hardened his face. The woman’s eyes locked on the firearm, and she glanced at him sideways. “What in the *hell* are you thinking?”  \n Miles looked at her, “I’m going to distract it. Give you all the time to escape.”  \n “I doubt that will work.”  \n “Well if *you* can come up with a better plan let me know.”  \n The clicking breathing outside grew louder, and the zipper at the top of the tent began to slowly move, rising upwards like an executioner’s axe preparing to fall.  \n The woman cursed under her breath and turned around. She moved through the group of girls and motioned to the back of the tent. “There’s another door over there. *If* you want to kill yourself.”  \n The zipper raised another inch, and then two, three more. Miles felt dread surge through his body. He lowered his gaze, “Not like I really have a choice.”  \n The woman shook her head and chuckled, “Man you’re an idiot.”  \n “Name’s Miles.”  \n “Tesa.”  \n Miles nodded his head in appreciation.  \n Tesa spoke, addressing the crowd of girls around her, “When Miles gets that thing’s attention, everyone run down the trail like your life depends on it.” She looked down, “Because it does.”  \n The girls all gave a mix of reluctant nods and grunts. The zipper was nearly the entire way up now, and accelerating. The glow from the creature's eyes became more intense as it began to move inside the tent.  \n Miles made eye contact with Tesa, and with a rush of determination, opened the tent’s rear door and stepped back out into the horrible blackness of the dark mountain.  \n He pulled his gun’s hammer backwards with a *click* and sprinted around to the side of the tent. He came to a stop and faced the immense shadowy figure in front of him. Hands trembling, he raised the revolver above his head and fired a shot towards the vacant sky. “NOW!”  \n The *thing* snapped its head to face Miles, and once again locked its menacing gaze onto him. His heart skipped a beat as the monster took a step towards him, then another, and another. Miles fired another shot into the air and sprinted in the opposite direction, running back towards the gulley.  \n In the corner of his vision he could see Tesa and the group of girls moving quietly out the front of the tent, down the trail *away* from where the creature was. He felt momentary relief at the sight of them escaping, but the feeling was quickly crushed by the closing sound of the creature’s menacing steps. Without a second of hesitation, he dove back into the gulley.  \n The claustrophobia he had felt before was nothing in comparison to the raw terror that he felt now. Whatever thing was following was set on killing him. Ripping him to shreds. Behind him he could hear the sound of the monster breathing, clicking *whatever* noise it was making. Whatever it was, it didn’t matter. It was getting closer.  \n The sound of trees collapsing grew nearer as he frantically shoved his way through the dense gulley. Branches slammed into his face as he sprinted, rocks threatening to trip him with every stride he took. Another thud, another unnatural clicking sound. Miles’s lungs burned like a raging fire, the cool night air only fueling his pain. If he could just make it out to the clearing, to the openness of the trail ahead. Then he could make it down to the base of the mountain. Back to Chris. With his last bit of energy he ripped through the rest of the flora and ran out onto the dirt trail. He paused, gasping, and looked behind him, a feeling of unease sinking in his gut.  \n There was silence. Deafening and utter silence.  \n The monster had stopped its pursuit. It was gone.  \n *No.*  \n Miles stumbled backwards.  \n It had turned around. Back towards the group. *Down* the mountain.  \n Miles limped down the trail, his legs aching with exhaustion. He didn’t care. If that thing followed the group of girls to the base of the mountain, it would catch up with Chris’s group. Chris would die. Everyone would die.  \n Dirt kicked up into the air as Miles limped his way down the trail, clouding the path behind him. Not like it mattered anyway. He wasn’t going back. The ground beneath his feet began sloping downwards as he made his way down the mountain, giving speed to his hampered pace. Conflicting feelings of determination and utter dread filled his mind as he ran, eating away at his hope like termites in wood. No light, external or internal lit his way ahead, save for the distant menacing glow of the creature’s horrible eyes. In that far-away yellow light, he could see its gargantuan form looming over - and slowly catching up with - the silhouettes of Tesa’s group. In front of him, nearly two hundred yards away, was a group of boys sitting at the base of the mountain. All gathered around a boy holding the blazing light of a torch high above his head.  \n A blood curdling wail of pain came far off his left as he saw the silhouette of a girl fall to the ground. Miles saw the shadow of a long, clawed and jagged hand extend from the monster, slowly dragging her towards itself.  \n He looked away just before her screams finally came to a horrific stop. A revolting *crack* echoed across the opening. Miles gagged, but kept moving. Whatever it just did had slowed it down. For now.  \n He arrived at the group of boys at the same time Tesa did, the sound of conversation beginning to smother the silence of the night. A girl limped over to where Tesa stood comforting another girl, face in her hands, sobbing. The girl with the limp sat down and stared off into the distance, a haunted expression in her eyes. “It… ate Emily.” She started to cry, “It actually *ate her.”*  \n She looked up at Miles and glared, sorrow radiating from her expression, “I thought you led it away? What *happened?*”  \n Tesa glanced at Miles too, and nodded her head slowly, “What *did* happen?”  \n Miles’s throat caught, “I… don’t know. It just-” He tore his gaze away from the crying girl, ashamed. “-it stopped following me.”  \n Tesa folded her arms, “Is that so?”  \n “Yes.”  \n “I believe you.”  \n Miles looked down, “Really no I should have fired another shot or…”  \n “It’s not your fault.” Tesa said.  \n “I’ll try to believe that.”  \n Behind them, Miles could see the creature stand up and begin moving closer to them. Its fast rhythmic clicking started up again, louder than before. Its eyes seemed locked at the center of their group, staring at something. Or someone.  \n Chris held the torch defiantly ever-higher, standing his ground, staring right back at the monster. Miles pushed his way through the crowd of people and made a beeline straight for his nephew, orange firelight flickering in his vision. Miles reached his hand out and placed it on his nephew’s shoulder. “Hey kid.”  \n Chris looked at Miles and his hard expression lifted into a smile, “Guess this means you’re getting us dinner huh?”  \n Miles shook his head and laughed despite the situation, “Persistent, aren’t you.”  \n Chris nodded, “Me and that thing.”  \n Miles turned back around. The monster, now only paces away from their group, began to step into the fire’s light. He still couldn’t make out its features, but the people at the front let out horrified shouts as they clambered backward, trying to put distance between themselves and the creature. Every step it took was slower than the last, almost as if it was wary of the torch’s light. Hesitant.\n\nSuddenly an idea clicked in Mile’s mind. A dangerous one. He reached his hand out again towards Chris’s. “Can I borrow that?”  \n Chris heasistated, and then handed the torch over to his uncle, confusion evident in his posture.  \n “Thanks.”  \n Miles moved his way back through the group, hearing them begin to notice him holding the torch above, walking towards the approaching creature. He took another step forward, and so did the monster. As he moved closer, he could begin to make out the beginnings of its features, the depth to its clicking breath. He slowly put his gun behind his back, clicked the hammer, and raised the torch upward to the sky. Miles’s spirits sank.  \n The thing that loomed over him - only two feet away from where he stood - was horrific. Where its chest should have been, was a ribcage that split down the middle, open, *moving*, with uncountable rows of glistening razor sharp teeth. Its entire *torso* breathed, moving in and out, opening and closing like a mouth would. Where its hands should have been, were horrifically long claws, stained and dripping with blood. Where a head should have been, was an elk skull, antlers branching out several feel like a tree made of bone; And in the sockets of the elk skull, were glowing, yellow, *human* eyes.  \n With the stench of a thousand corpses, it let out a whisper as intense as the loudest scream imaginable, “*LEAVE…”*  \n Miles lunged forward with a burst of energy and rammed the flaming torch into the *thing’s* ‘mouth’, whipped his gun forward and pulled the trigger, shoving it point blank to its skull. “For Connor, you *bastard.”*  \n He pulled the trigger.  \n Blood splattered into the air as the monster let out an all-too human scream and fell backward, crumpling to the ground. The creature wailed in one last moment of pure unadulterated rage, and fell silent, motionless. Gone.  \n\\---  \n The Wendigo oddly felt peace, despite the excruciating pain that filled its burning body. Peace that its endless suffering had finally been put to an end. Peace with knowing that what it had done ensured the ground it now burned on would never be disturbed again. Humanity would no longer tread its disgusting filth on the land it held as its own. The land it was cursed to protect.  \n In the fading light of its eyes mixing with the firelight that illuminated the trail ahead it could see the group of trespassers walking off in the distance. The Wendigo saw a man, carrying a boy on his shoulders, laughing. A woman, comforting a small girl, all the while holding the pinpoint glow of a burning lighter.  \n With a final clicking breath, with its final moment of life, it looked upwards at the full moon, returned to the endless, star filled sky.",

        "text": "As a young boy, I had always been fascinated by my grandparents' old house in the woods. The towering trees that surrounded the property seemed to whisper secrets, and the creaks and groans of the house itself told stories of generations past. It was a magical place, full of wonder and mystery.\n\nBut as my grandmother's health began to deteriorate, that sense of magic was replaced by something far more sinister. It started with the tremors, a subtle shaking of her hands that we all initially shrugged off as just a sign of aging. But soon those tremors spread, taking over her entire body and making her movements more and more erratic.\n\nAt first, we tried to help her manage her symptoms, seeking out the best medical care we could find. But despite all our efforts, her condition only continued to worsen. She started to lose control of her body, stumbling and falling more often than not. And then, one day, things took a truly terrifying turn.\n\nMy grandmother's hands would shake uncontrollably, her movements becoming more and more erratic. But it wasn't until she started running around the house naked that things really got scary.\n\nI was just a little boy at the time, living with my grandparents in their old, creaky house in the woods. My grandfather had passed away a few years earlier, leaving my grandmother alone and vulnerable. It wasn't long after his death that her Parkinson's really started to take hold.\n\nAt first, I thought it was just a harmless quirk. Grandma had always been a bit eccentric, after all. But then she started to get violent, lashing out at anyone who came near her. And then there were the nightmares. Terrible, blood-curdling nightmares that left her screaming in the night.\n\nOne night, I woke up to find my grandmother standing at the foot of my bed, her naked body writhing with Parkinson's tremors. I was frozen with fear as she leaned in close to my face, her breath hot and rancid.\n\n\"Isn't it soft?\" she whispered, her voice like a child's.\n\nI tried to scream, but no sound would come out. And then she was gone, disappearing into the darkness of the house.\n\nThe next morning, I found her lying motionless in her bed, her eyes open and staring blankly at the ceiling. I was never quite sure what happened to her that night, or why she was running around the house naked. But one thing was certain: something had taken hold of my grandmother, and it was something far more sinister than just a disease.\n\nTo this day, I can't help but wonder what really happened that night in that old, creaky house.\n\nAfter my grandmother's passing, the old house lost its magic. It became a place of sadness and dread, haunting me with memories of her final days. I couldn't bear to go back there, and it wasn't until years later that I found the courage to return.\n\nAs I walked up the overgrown path to the house, I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. The trees loomed overhead, casting deep shadows on the ground. The house itself seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for me to make the first move.\n\nWhen I stepped inside, the air was thick with the smell of decay. Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust, as if the house had been abandoned for years. I made my way to my grandmother's old room, the place where she had spent her final days.\n\nAs I stood in the doorway, a chill ran down my spine. The room was just as I remembered it, with the same old furniture and faded wallpaper. But there was something else there too, something that I couldn't quite put my finger on.",

        "text": "Last semester, a film student named Jacob submitted a video that made me so horrified that I had to call the dean at 1.00 AM. She advised me to turn the clip over to the police.\n\nI teach filmmaking at an art college in Maryland. During the Covid lockdown in late 2020, my filmmaking course was online.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy usual first assignment would have the students go out and film any setting. With an online class, the students just film around their houses. Most students were happy to show off their gaming setup and action figures collection. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA student named Jacob put his camera on a tripod and filmed a dead oak tree in his backyard for about five minutes. I asked him to film some close-ups. He replied that he was too afraid. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor continuity editing, I normally have students film a chase sequence or a snowball fight. For online, students just filmed themselves cooking or playing with their pets. Jacob submitted a video of himself tying a noose. He then hung a mannequin on the same dead oak tree. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started to get creeped out, but I had to put on a brave face. Horror and film students always go hand in hand. I don’t want to appear like I was easily spooked. I jokingly asked Jacob if he was no longer scared of getting close to the tree. He said he wanted to scare it. I asked who, and he replied the jester.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the next assignment, Jacob submitted a clip of a man who I thought was Jacob put on a medieval jester costume and a smiling mask dancing around the dead oak tree. It was in black and white and was beyond disturbing. I’m used to horror movies being submitted to me by students. But those were gory and wild (and fun). This clip was just eerie. I asked him where he got the costume. He said that wasn’t him. I didn’t press further (usually I would ask, but with online class, I just assumed it was a family member).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter class, Jacob messaged me privately and asked if his videos of the tree made me sick. I was confused and thought he meant if I was sick of seeing the same tree over and over. Against my preference, I said no. If he found a muse which inspired him, then he should stick with it as long as he can. It felt like the right thing to say at the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found out from other professors that Jacob began incorporating the dead oak tree into all that he did. In photography class, he retouched a photo of a car crash onto a photo of the dead oak tree. In digital illustration class, he drew the dead oak tree with a bunch of dead animals hanging from it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther students noticed Jacob’s obsession with the dead oak tree as well and started talking to me about it. An aspiring YouTuber named Matt asked me if he could submit a ‘Let’s Play’ for an assignment. I normally would say no, but because everybody was in home isolation at the time, I thought, why not? Just add a lot of narration. Matt then invited me to watch him play Pub-G live on Twitch. When I did, I was amused to see that Jacob was one of his team members. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI asked Matt after the stream how he knew Jacob. Matt said that Jacob was his neighbor only a few houses down the road from him. And to my surprise, they didn’t live that far from me either, only two blocks away. I even thought about walking over to see Jacob’s dead oak tree after the covid lockdown ended.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMatt told me what happened to Jacob back when they were in middle school. Jacob was home alone and a man knocked on the door, telling Jacob that he used to live in that house. The man asked his father to build him a treehouse, and just when the father was about to finish it, he fell from the tree and broke his neck. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt’s been over two decades since he moved away, and the man told Jacob he just wanted to see the oak tree again. Jacob didn’t let him inside but said that he can go around and look at it in the backyard. Jacob played video games until his parents came home, where they found the man in a full jester costume dancing around the tree. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe semester after, in early 2021, Jacob wasn’t taking any of my classes, but a cinematography professor video-call me about one of Jacob’s videos. The assignment was to light up a night scene, and Jacob just filmed a handheld POV shot of him circling around a tree with a flashlight. She told me that the tree in the video was not a tree in Jacob’s backyard. Jacob told her it was a tree in my backyard. I didn’t even end the video call, I just sprinted out onto my balcony to take a look at my tree, and then took a look at the footage again. It was. I was so frightened I could throw up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI video-called Jacob immediately. I asked him to turn on his camera so we could talk face-to-face. Without sounding angry, I asked him why he was in my backyard. He explained that he cut down his dead oak tree last semester. The dead oak tree that was featured in his work after that had always been my tree. I just realized that none of his works that featured the tree after my class was a video. Jacob used the photo of my tree he found on my Facebook profile.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJacob said that an entity wearing a jester costume had been sneaking into my backyard, slowly killing my tree. I didn’t notice my tree was dying because it was during the wintertime. Jacob was at my house that one time to try to capture the jester on camera. He did it once during the Mise-en-scène assignment, and that was when he knew it was not just him who saw it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was frustrated and scared, but I didn’t want to upset him. I told him that he should have told me if he was coming over. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days later, at about 11 PM, Matt was live-streaming and I was watching him on Twitch. I was shocked to see Jacob burst through Matt’s bedroom door. He was covered in cuts and bruises. Shards of glass were all over his body, and his shirt was soaked in blood. Fresh blood was still dripping down from his forehead. Matt fell out of his chair screaming at the top of his lungs, rightfully freaking out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI’ll give Matt credit for not cursing and chasing Jacob out of his room. Matt asked Jacob what was wrong. Jacob looked into the camera and asked if I am watching. He told me to look in my backyard. The jester was there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere were about 20 people in the chat, some of them were my students. I @ a dependable student in the chat, asking her to call 911, and told Matt to render basic first aid for Jacob.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went outside to look, and I was shocked to see a car crash into my tree. I didn’t hear anything because I was wearing headphones, and apparently, none of my neighbors did.  I couldn’t even see the car until I turned on my backyard light. But the crash was a big one. The car was totaled and there were shards of broken glass everywhere. Nothing was on fire. The car’s engine was not on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust when I was about to call the police, I got a notification that someone had uploaded a large file to our department’s file storage. I opened it, and it was a video clip said to be uploaded by Jacob’s username. It showed Jacob placing a camera on the backseat of his car. He turned from his driver's seat and stared into the camera. My mouth was wide open when I saw another person in the passenger seat, wearing a jester costume. Without turning back around to face forward, Jacob, still looking into the camera, just stepped on the gas and crashed into my tree.  As the crash happened, I could see the jester’s unmasked face in a split second. It was not human.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI decided to call the dean after I called the police. She was equally horrified after looking at the clip. She told me to save the clip in case the police need it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe asked me who the man in the jester costume was. She probably didn’t pause to see his monstrous face. I told her that I couldn’t find anybody else at the crash. But, I had a gut feeling that Jacob saved me from the jester that night.",

        "text": "Hey guy, just call me Cris. I live in a suburban town in my state. Im 23 and I work as a Night Watch.\n\nMaybe you guys are used to the joke of \"I got to buy some milk\" yeah the joke when the boyfriend go to buy some milk once their gf get pregnant.\n\n\nWell I need to say that it actually has a darker story behind it. \n\n\nLast month, I got the news about my girlfriend get pregnant, so we will have a baby. Im happy,exited and nerveous at the same time.\n\n\nTo calm myself I go the the store to \"grab some milk\" and perhaps just drink abit. Once Im about to pay for the groceries. The cashier, an old women maybe at her 60s?. She asked me.\n\n\"First baby ehh?\"\n\nI say yes and then I snapped. How did she know? Did I mumble it? I dont think so. After that I grab the groceries and get out of the store.\n\n\nOnce Im out, Im shocked, the sky is red as blood. The dark sky if the night is no more. The moon is orange in colour and very bright.\n\nI stumble on my feet trying to get on what is going on. I look around me and saw the small town turned into ruins of building and large tree started to grow.\n\nI look back at the store. It is empty.\n\n\nI roam around the town. Looking for sign of atleast someone. After looking for about 15 minutes, I see someone. A women. I walk toward her and I want to talk. Suddenly someone grabbed my had and pull me behind a truck\n\n\"What the he....\"\n\nShhhhh dont let it hear you.\n\nIt is a man. Skinny and look dirty. I want to ask what happen but he quickly pull me to the nearby bush. We walk for a while before I saw a zink door with fence around.\n\n\nThe man open the door and bring me inside. From the small settlement like area, I saw dozens of man. Some are skinny yet some looks fine. They greet me.\n\n\"You buy milk arent ya?\"\n\nI nod.\n\nThe man sigh and said \"We all have the same experience\" but none of us know how we end up here.\n\nYou can stay in the camp, but you need to do some chores. I agreed.\n\nFrom the man stories, finding way out is not an option so I want to stay here for a while. I help them to catch crow and rat. We eat it. After around three days. I tell them that I want to leave.\n\n\nI need to find a way out. I have a family.\n\nThey didnt insist me to stay so I started my journey roaming the town.\n\n\nI saw the girl again, she sees me now. But something is wrong. Her face is pale as snow and she had dark eyes looking like a void. Suddenly she dash atcme faster than I can react.\n\n\nI get on my feet and started running. I jump from car to car, and from road to road. More and more of that pale women came after me.\n\n\nI dont know if I can make it. I jump and hide in the large trash bin. I wait for a while.\n\n\"Running eh?\"\n\nI almost got a heart attack. The old women from the store she sit beside me in the trash bin. \n\n\"Well you are here, you must bare this punishment\"\n\nWhat punishment? Why?\n\n\nYou hurt a girl feeling when you were at highschool I suppose?\n\nI think for a while. Oh yes I remember. I once played classmate of me, I made her cry by giving her fake hope.\n\nNow you see this is your punishment, she kill herself ya know?\n\nNow she would join \"them\" and you and those other guys will feel the wrath.\n\n\nI cant bealive it. The women hand me a paper.\n\n\"Solve this riddle and you might have a chance to go back to your normal life\"\n\n(To end something, one should look back at the starting)\n\n\nI scracth my head. This is bullshit. I walk out to the gas station perhaps I would have something to eat. I found some canned food. When I looting all of the food.\n\nI suddenly heard footstep and the step seem heavy, I look back. My heart will stop beating. I saw a tall and pale women with a muscular body. She must be around 7ft+\n\n\nAfter that cat and mouse game started. She dash towards me. I run as fast as I kind back and forth of the town block. My feet almost giveup but I knew i need to keep running.\n\nAfter that I took a dive in the bushescand wait there. She didnt find me. Im glad.\n\nJust then I heard someone crying. Just couple of yard behind me. A silhouette of a girl in the dark. She look as pale as the other girl, but I knew her. She is the girl I prank before.\n\nShe looks at me and suddenly smile revealing her sharp teeth. Im done.\n\nShe jump at me and end up at the top of me. I cant resist, she is to strong. Just as I thought Im about to die,I remember the riddle.\n(To end something, one should look back at the starting)\n\nThat is it. I know.\n\nIm the one who start it so I must end my own suffering. I stop resisting. She also stop biting my arm. Suddenly a bright flash come.\n\n\"Lucky eh? She forgive you ehh?\"\n\nThe old lady again.\n\n\"You overcome the fear of death, she forgive you. You will be a great father\"\n\nI dash my way out and everything seem normal again.\n\nFinally peace.\n\nI hope other man can overcome their fear so that they might save themself in other day.",

        "text": "Liam was always a hollow child, but I compensated for his callousness with my boundless love. And I *still* love him. That might horrify you after learning what he did.\n\nA mother cannot wrestle with her biological predispositions, as much as I have longed to do so. If you have a warm, empathetic child, then I suppose you might not understand. That’s a good thing. I don’t want to believe in the existence of others with Liam’s perturbing power.\n\n“I spy with my little eye…” Liam began. “… something beginning with ‘F’.”\n\n“Falafel?” My husband, David, eagerly asked.\n\n“Huh?” My six-year-old son blankly responded.\n\n“Ignore your father,” I groaned. “He’s just hungry.”\n\n“Fire?” Alicia teased.\n\nLiam walloped his older sister on the upper arm, briefly furrowing his sturdy brow. He quickly composed himself, but I saw that fleeting flicker of humanity. Fear was the only emotion my son ever seemed to possess, and only the mention of fire could elicit that response.\n\n“Alicia!” I scowled. “What have I told you about scaring your brother?”\n\n“He scares me constantly,” Alicia huffed.\n\n“Well, you’re nearly a grown-up, so I expect you to be the mature one,” I sighed. “What about ‘Field’, Liam?”\n\nLiam shook his head and smiled, but it was not a warm smile. It was not a *human* smile. It bubbled with boiling brutality, like a poison-laced broth. His pause filled me with terror.\n\n“Fox,” He whispered.\n\nDavid scoffed. “Fox? Where did you see-”\n\nMy husband slammed the sole of his boot onto the brake pedal before he finished the question. The rubber of the Range Rover’s tyres scorched against tarmac, and the bulky vehicle drew to an emergency halt. A fiendishly-fast blur of red materialised on the road before us, and we found ourselves eyeing a fox.\n\nThat ordeal occurred a year ago. We often talked about the unsettling nature of the coincidence. How had Liam known the fox would be in the road at that exact moment? Had he seen one a few minutes earlier? David chalked up the close call to calamitous chance.\n\nBut my maternal instinct told me otherwise. Something had always been deeply wrong with Liam, and — two days ago — my dreadful suspicions were finally confirmed. We were on a family road trip to the Lake District. At the mid-point of a ceaseless country road, my son made a request that chilled the blood in my veins.\n\n“I want to play ‘I spy’,” Liam said.\n\nDavid laughed. “We’ve not played that since the time you almost caused a car accident.”\n\n“Please,” Liam pleaded. “I spy with my little eye something beginning with ‘M’.”\n\n“Mud,” Alicia sighed.\n\nIn the reflection of my wing mirror, I noticed my daughter staring dejectedly at the passing countryside — murky farmland stretched to the horizon. Busy beads of rain trickled down the glass panes of the Range Rover, cascading towards the metal bodywork. The weather seemed to be worsening with every passing minute.\n\n“No,” Liam replied.\n\n“*Magnificent* holiday?” David chortled.\n\nLiam shook his head, then he smiled menacingly at me. “Any guesses, Mum?”\n\nI gulped, fearful of my own son. “Main road?”\n\nLiam sighed, faux-exasperated. “No. Shall I tell you?”\n\n“If it would put an end to your dumb game,” Alicia said.\n\nThe air in the car thickened. It became a foreboding fog that only I seemed to perceive. Call it what you will — a mother’s intuition, perhaps. I saw a ghastly glint of glee in Liam’s eyes. Raw power that shone far more brightly than a year prior. I trembled as my son uttered the answer.\n\n“Maze.”\n\nThere is no rational explanation for the following events. The sun glared through the windscreen, bathing the world in blinding light. A second later, it cleared — revealing a sudden end to the road.\n\nEveryone but Liam screamed as David slammed on the brakes, bringing us to a halt about three feet before the abrupt termination point of the road. When I looked in the wing mirror, the road *also* came to a dead-end about twenty feet behind us. Horrifyingly, our tiny stretch of road was encompassed by a ten-foot-tall tower of maize — corn crops — in all directions.\n\n“A maze of *maize*,” Liam giggled.\n\nOur son leapt from the car and disappeared into a narrow passageway through the slender, towering strands of corn. I shot a pale, petrified look at my husband. His expression mirrored mine.\n\n“Did I… veer off the road?” He asked. “How did this crop field appear?”\n\n“We’re still *on* the road,” Alicia quivered. “There was nothing alongside us but muddy fields, and now… we’re surrounded by freakishly tall crops.”\n\n“Clarissa, wait for-” David started.\n\nI had already thrown my car door open, and I started to shout for Liam to come back. I watched him disappear farther into the maze and turned to face my husband.\n\n“Why are you still sitting there? Come on!” I implored.\n\nExiting the car in a mad rush, I frantically dived into the maze to pursue my son. I knew exactly why David and Alicia were frozen in the car. They were still trying to process the supernatural phenomenon they’d witnessed. But I’d assumed something sinister about my son long ago. I was focusing on finding him — there was no time to waste. I wish, more than anything, that I’d waited for the rest of my family to catch up. I wish we’d banded together in that ceaseless cage of corn.\n\n“Liam!” I heard David call from ahead.\n\n*How is he already in front of me?* I wondered.\n\nThe dimensions of space and time seemed a little muddy and misshapen in the maize field. We were in Liam’s world. Then again, we always had been. And that fact became abundantly clear when I heard my husband’s cry for help. I emerged into a clearing to find Liam staring silently at his father. David hung on a wooden cross with his bloody limbs constricted by rope.\n\n“Liam!” I screamed. “Let him *down*!”\n\nMy son’s smile was beyond cruel — cruelty is a human construct. It was an insidious grin from the bowels of Hell.\n\n“You made it to the end of the maze! Well done. Now, let’s play. I spy with my little eye…” Liam began.\n\n“Don’t…” I whispered.\n\n“… something beginning with ‘I’.” He finished.\n\n“I don’t want to play, Liam,” I sobbed. “Please let Daddy down. I’m not mad! I just-”\n\n“- *Guess*!” Liam growled.\n\nSynchronising with his guttural outburst, the grey, rainy clouds darkened to black, and thunder rumbled. I suddenly realised that the worsening weather during the car journey must have been caused by my unholy son.\n\nI whimpered tearfully. “Erm… Insects?”\n\nLiam smiled. “No, Mummy. *Insides*.”\n\nThe scene that unfolded before me was unthinkably terrible. It has plagued me for the past few days, and I have no doubt that it’ll plague me for the *rest* of my days. David started coughing. Crimson specks spluttered from his parted lips. The following sound, like a hefty wad of paper being torn in two, was almost as horrifying as the piercing screams that escaped David’s throat.\n\nIt was the sound of his flesh peeling backwards, as if he were being unwrapped. Red meat was slowly uncovered. I could only watch in helpless horror as the man I loved was turned inside out. Organs started to spool from his mouth, and the life drained from his eyes, which were starting to fill with blood.\n\nIt was a brief spectacle, but one that plays endlessly in my mind. And when it was all over, Liam silently surveyed me. He was hoping for a specific reaction, I think. My sinister son was about to say something when a noise interrupted his thought. An engine. The Range Rover.\n\nShredding through the edge of the maize field was a blazing box on wheels. My daughter was not behind the wheel, thankfully. The driverless vehicle, propelled — as I would later discover — by a weighty handbag on the accelerator pedal, ploughed into the clearing. Liam screeched as it barrelled towards him. In a barbarous burst of flame, the cross carrying David’s corpse collapsed. The smell of burning flesh, wood, corn, and diesel filled the air.\n\nFollowing a dazzling burst of sunlight, the real road and its earthly surroundings returned. All that remained of Liam’s nightmarish maize trap was the carcass of our car and Alicia, standing on the roadside in floods of tears. I embraced my daughter, and we mourned the loss of our family.\n\nWe were picked up by a concerned passer-by and driven to the nearest police station. There was no sign of anything that my daughter and I had seen. No maize field. No cross. No fire. No David. No Liam.\n\nMy husband and son are officially listed as missing persons. Alicia and I have been bouncing from hotel to hotel, hitching rides and sleeping when we dare to do so.\n\nLiam is still out there. And I know it might sound strange to all of you, but I really do hope he’s safe. He’s still my son, after all. Yes, I have to protect Alicia. I know that. I won’t let him hurt her.\n\nI just pray that my son isn’t playing ‘I spy’ with any other unfortunate souls.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/dominiceagle)",

        "text": "The door is locked and the gaps are plugged with towels, but I don’t think it will make any difference. I can hear my neighbors driving by outside the barricaded window, completely unaware of the horrors taking place inside this house. \n\nI guess I just want someone else to know the truth.\n\nIt started–as these things often do–with something completely unexpected. \n\nAn event that came screeching in out of the dark to smash the quiet life that I’d build with my wife Alice and our son, Jake. \n\nWe tried so hard to child-proof our house. We protected the power outlets, used baby gates, and stored dangerous chemicals far out of reach. I don’t know *where* Jake got ahold of that small glass bead. Maybe he even found it outside, in the street or at the playground. \n\nAll I know is, the moment he swallowed it, that little ball of glass cut off his air supply completely. Alice and I tried desperately to remember the heimlich maneuver and perform it on our squirming, crying, purple-faced child–\n\nBut we only made things worse. By the time the EMTs arrived, Jake had stopped breathing. He lay in my wife’s arms limp and lifeless as a rag doll, drool dribbling out of his bluish lips. \n\nThe looks on the paramedics’ faces, when they finally arrived, told us everything we needed to know. Despite their best resuscitation efforts, our son was gone. \n\nI still remember the way my wife’s hot tears soaked through my shirt as we walked out to the ambulance with Jake. I wanted to hold his tiny hand until the last minute, until they loaded him into that sterile metal box and the doors closed on him forever–\n\nThen, suddenly…Jake grabbed my finger. His eyes snapped open, and with a *pop,* the cat's-eye bead popped out of his mouth. \n\nThe paramedics couldn’t believe it. Resuscitation efforts had ended eight minutes ago, and Jake had been legally dead for almost half an hour.\n\n*Lazarus syndrome,* they called it, but I didn’t care about names or diagnosis. I didn’t care about tests and trials and clinical statistics. I was just happy to have my son back.\n\nJake was quieter than I remembered. Before, his big blue eyes had sparked like sunlight on the sea; now, however they seemed darker–*deeper* somehow–like I was looking into a still, bottomless pool. \n\nI found that couldn’t maintain eye contact with him for long.\n\nMaybe that was the first sign. Maybe that’s when I should have acted–\n\nBut it’s too late now. \n\nLike most new parents, Alice and I had been terrified to leave Jake’s side at first. We kept his crib in our bedroom, but after his recovery…\n\nWe found we couldn’t sleep with Jake nearby. \n\nHe would stand and stare at us all night, his hands grabbing the bars of his crib like a death-row inmate in teddy bear pajamas. Although Alice and I never talked about it, we could both *feel* his gaze probing at the back of our skulls, as though he were trying to drill them open and let something in. A few weeks later, we moved Jake’s crib to my office. \n\nThat’s why we were so terrified to find him in bed with us at 3 A.M. the next night. \n\nHe lay sucking his thumb with one hand, and had the other on Alice’s hip in a way that seemed strangely adult and possessive. Worse still, when I looked at that hand out of the corner of my eye, it didn’t seem like a toddler’s arm at all.\n\nIt looked stretched, hairy, and horrible. \n\nWhile I carried my sleeping son back to his crib, I wondered if I was having some kind of psychological reaction to the trauma of Jake’s death and unexpected resuscitation. \n\nThat could be the only explanation for the things I was seeing and feeling–\n\n*Right?*\n\nAs I put Jake back in his crib, I noticed something red on his lip. With awful, adult intelligence, he quickly tried to hide it from me, but I spun him back around–\n\nJake opened his mouth wide. A waterfall of blood poured out. I’d never seen so much in my life. I screamed for Alice and looked around for something, *anything,* to stop the bleeding. Behind me, I could hear the gory stream splattering on the floor–\n\nAnd that wasn’t all. When I turned again, hundreds of round cat’s-eye beads were dribbling from my son’s mouth. \n\n*“WHAT?!”* Alice burst into the room with a shout. I pointed to Jake–\n\nBut he was fine. Our son sat sleepily in his crib with a puzzled expression on his face, as though he was concerned about my weird behavior. I tried to stammer an explanation to Alice on our walk back to bed, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that my son was laughing silently at me behind my back. \n\nFrom there, things only got worse. \n\nThe next night, I woke from a revolting dream in which a giant leech was writhing around inside my sheets, sucking me dry–\n\nAnd just like in the dream, there was a weight on my chest when I woke. \n\nIt was Jake, giggling as he crawled around our bed. It was all I could do to keep myself from shoving him off me.  \n\n*This is your son,* I told myself. *You love him.* And it was true…\n\nBut more and more I was starting to wonder whether the thing inside that crib was really *Jake* at all.\n\nI installed a bolt on Jake’s bedroom door; surely *that* would stop his late-night wanderings. \n\nBut the next night, my son was back in bed with us again. \n\nI placed a motion-activated camera in the hallway, hoping to figure out how on earth Jake had opened the bolt–\n\nAnd what I saw on that eerie night-vision footage will haunt me for the rest of my life. \n\nSomething slid beneath my son’s door. *A hand.* At first, it looked just like Jake’s–but as the arm stretched upwards toward the lock and the fingers extended, its appearance changed into something monstrous. My *“son’s”* arm had somehow passed beneath the door, reached all the way up its length, and unbolted its lock with clawed, hairy fingers. \n\nThe hideous arm retracted. The door creaked open…and Jake crawled along the ceiling toward our bedroom. The last still image the camera captured was Jake’s freakishly extended foot and snarling face as he kicked it away. \n\nI watched the clip again and again, unable to reconcile what I’d seen with the toddler dozing peacefully just a few feet away. During the day, Jake was completely normal: he threw tantrums, colored and played with his toys, asked a question every five seconds, and fell asleep eating his Cheerios. Maybe it was just at night when he…\n\nA sudden *THUMP* jolted me out of my reverie. Jake was awake; in fact, he was standing right next to me, a lifeless expression on his face. He’d just slammed his little fist into my computer…right above the port where I’d inserted the camera’s SD card. *Was he trying to destroy the video?!*\n\n*THUMP.* \n\n*THUMP.* \n\nJake brought his fist down two more times with impossible strength, shattering my laptop’s fragile plastic covering and the SD card inside–\n\n*And that wasn’t all* \n\nMy mind didn’t want to process it, *couldn’t* process it.\n\n*But Jake…had grown taller than me.*\n\nI looked down in horror at the extra forty inches of deformed flesh that started at my son’s pajama bottoms and ended in the clawed feet on the floor. I shut my eyes and clamped down a scream–\n\nWhen I opened them again, Jake was crawling on the rug, completely fixated on the toy truck in front of him. His face and body were completely normal…\n\nBut my laptop was a broken mess. \n\nJake–or whatever was inside of him–was getting more powerful. \n\nAlice and I felt hunted inside our own home. Whenever we tried to discuss what was happening to Jake, we’d hear his tiny feet scurrying impossibly fast and suddenly–\n\nhe’d be standing right beside us\n\nListening. \n\nWatching with those dark blue, endlessly deep eyes. \n\nAfter what happened last night, I suppose I can’t blame Alice for leaving.\n\nI’d spent the day installing a key-operated lock on Jake’s bedroom door. I set up a baby camera in the room that streamed live to Alice and I. *In case he needs us,* I told myself–\n\nBut the truth was that I’d set it up for our own protection. \n\nIf Jake started to…*change*…we’d know about it. \n\nThe new setup was supposed to help us sleep, but in the end, Alice and I just lay awake watching what was happening on the other side of the baby camera. We stared at our perfectly ordinary, snoozing, thumb-sucking toddler as though we were watching a tense scene in a horror movie, the kind so terrifying that it’s impossible to look away…\n\nWe’d gone without sleep for so long; I suppose it was just a matter of time. \n\nI couldn’t blame Alice when she dozed off on my shoulder; I kept nodding off as well. I tried to tell myself that *one* of us needed to keep watch–\n\nBut every time I looked up, the scene on the screen was unchanged: the small, cute shape of Jake in his onesie pajamas, one arm around his teddy bear. \n\n*Maybe things are fine now,* the treacherous, exhausted part of my mind whispered. *Maybe the danger, or whatever it was, has passed…*\n\nMy chin hit my chest; my eyes popped open with a start: a dark shape–probably Jake’s teddy bear–lay in front of the camera, blocking it... \n\n*And where was our son?* \n\n*Mmmph…mmmmppphhh…*\n\nAt first, I didn’t notice the sounds coming from beside me. \n\nI turned slowly–almost not wanting to see–and saw Jake’s monstrous fingers toying with my wife’s hair. His open mouth was pressed against hers, and something bulky and hideous was sliding down her throat–\n\nAlthough whether Jake was draining something out of Alice or infesting her with something of his own, I couldn’t tell. My whole world became that horrible strangled sound, those two entangled figures lit only by the eerie green glow of the screen, and my own paralyzing fear. \n\nAlice’s hands struggled feebly, trying to pry Jake off her face; it was only then that I found the strength to act. I grabbed Jake from behind and pulled.\n\nIt took both of our combined strength to pry him, screeching and flailing, off of Alice’s face. Both of their mouths were covered with a lipstick-smear coating of bright red blood. \n\nAlice coughed and spit something up: a tiger’s eye-glass bead. She stared at it for a long second, then grabbed her purse and walked out the door. \n\nI could hear Jake giggling beside me as Alice started her car in the misty four-A.M. darkness. \n\nEven then, I knew in my heart that I’d never see her again. \n\nI've been home alone with Jake since then. He's been testing the boundaries, *changing* more often and more obviously. I think he knows that no help is coming for me. I can hear him running through the house, laughing, smashing things for fun…\n\nIt's only a matter of time now. \n\nI'm not afraid of death; the moment Alice left, I accepted my fate.\n\nNo, what I'm afraid of is–\n\n*What if death is not the end?*\n\nWhat if…*after whatever Jake does to me*…I wake up again, and spit a tiger’s-eye ball of glass out onto the floor? \n\n*What if I wake up as something else?*   \n\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/beardify)",

        "text": "This was a long time ago, and no one would believe me if I posted this in r/creepyencounters or some shit, so here I am posting on a fiction subreddit. This is a straight up true story, but feel free to not believe it because it sounds fake as fuck. \n\nI was a junior in high school. A bit of background: My friend’s mom worked at a daycare that was being renovated. They were in a new building right next to the old building, and everyone working there swore that the old building was haunted. Vaguely weird shit kept happening, and there was the cold drafts and all that haunted shit. Everyone had seen some dude in a cowboy hat who definitely didn’t exist. My friend’s mom even had a video of the creepiest child/thing ever peeking out of a window of the old building. One of her toddlers kept talking and waving to this empty window, and the window wasn’t fucking empty. \n\nAnyway. We were really into “playing” Ouija board at that point. I don’t give a shit what your personal beliefs are, some weird shit happened. Anyway, we decided that Halloween was the perfect time to break into a fucking haunted daycare at 2am on Halloween night with our fucking Ouija board.\n\nWe used a key and walked up in this place. There were still toys in the rooms. I was dressed as a rainbow fairy with a fucking sparkly tutu. Everything was creepy in that sort of way where it shouldn’t really be creepy but it is, and there was no music, so none of us knew to run away.\n\nWe whipped out our Ouija board and started going at it. We met a kid named Ethan, who seemed afraid to talk to us. Everyone was jumpy as fuck because it’s an old, anecdotally haunted building, and we were a bunch of teenagers.\n\nWe also had a camera set up facing down a hallway, because catching creepy shit on camera is neat.\n\nIt was pretty windy, because where we lived was always windy, so there were all of the expected creaks and groans and whatnot. There were also bad sounds within the house but whatever.\n\nBtw, it was an old mobile home. Basically a fucking trailer with a washer and dryer by the front door. (I’m setting the scene, but this is also very relevant.)\n\nEverything was groaning and creaking and whatnot, and Ethan was a sketchy little fuck. We heard some weird creaking sounds, and then we heard a door slam. Yeah, it could’ve been a random thing that houses do, but it probably wasn’t. \n\nWe heard the door slam at the same time that our delightful haunted guest started using the Ouija board to count down from 9-1. Apparently that’s a very bad sign. Idgaf if you guys think this is fake; Ouija boards seem really fake until they don’t. No one was counting down, one of us was crying. My friend said “Goodbye,” because basically if someone starts sneaking up on you from the endless darkness and counting down like your fuckin mom when you won’t get out of the treehouse, you tell them to fuck off. \n\nOverall, everyone was having a terrible time, and the door slam was fuckin upsetting, so we decided to get the fuck out of there. \n\nThe friend who’d set up the camera went to grab it and froze like a statue. He was like “holy shit guys look at this right now.” There was a fucking red child’s ball in the center of the hallway. Like the kind that you’ve seen in any horror movie ever. The one where you’re like “what the fuck is that supposed to be used for, no one can hit that with a bat and they’re probably not using it for physical therapy; why does it exist?”\n\nEveryone was getting the fuck out of there at that point, and my best friend and I were bringing up the rear. I remember we were kind of holding onto each other, and we both heard a creaking sound. We turned around, and a closet door that had been open the whole time was swinging shut. Like, slowly and deliberately. No wind or whatever in this bullshit trailer, it was just closing, slowly. It latched. Like it didn’t just close, it gently latched. \n\nI remember that we were standing there, watching, clutching each other. Everything got really spicy and full of adrenaline and blurry soon after. \n\nMy most vivid memory was of me holding him with my hand on his chest, watching the door swing shut, and feeling his heart start to race. Feeling him go from the average “hmm I’m stressed” to heart pounding terror. That was really bad.\n\nWe started hustling to the door because fuck that shit, but the washer/dryer setup was right by the door, and one of our other friends, who wasn’t extremely creeped out, jumped out from behind the dryer. I screamed and almost shit myself, then we were laughing and my bff was slapping the other dude.\n\nAnd then, something ROARED at us. I can’t describe the sound, other than it sounded like it was coming from the depths of hell, and it was inside the house. There was no one else inside the house, we were the last ones in there. We fucking took off, and that was the blurry part. I ran across the yard and vaulted the fence, and made it to the car. I remember my dumbass friend who spooked us didn’t show up as fast and I was crying and screaming “where is ____?!?!” He showed up, and we hauled ass out of there in my minivan. \n\nWe stopped in a well-lit parking lot and looked at the footage of the hallway. I swear on my mother’s grave, one of the doors cracked open, and that dumbass red horror movie ball rolled out and settled in the exact middle of the fucking hallway. Then, a closet door slammed shut. That’s the point where all of us decided to clear out. But like, we had fucking footage of that little red ball rolling out of an empty room into the hallway.\n\nSo yeah, fun Halloween turns into gut wrenching terror, yeehaw \n\nAs a side note, I drove home to mom and dad and immediately had an allergic reaction. Like, hives and mouth swelling so bad they drove me to the ER in case my throat was next. I carried an Epipen for like three years but nothing ever happened, so I’m probably allergic to ghosts or some shit because none of those toddlers had issues in that building. \n\nFun fact, we drove by that place again and the fence I vaulted over was like five feet tall, adrenaline is a hell of a drug.\n\nHave fun sleeping y’all, because I didn’t for like three days",

        "text": "He'd been following me for about two weeks.\n\n\nWhenever I went for a walk, I could hear him behind me. At first, I kept looking over my shoulders to try and catch him, but, I could never see anyone, and I just ended up looking paranoid after a while. And whenever I *did* manage to see him, he seemed like just another normal person.\n\n\n\nThe first time I saw him, he was just a confusing blur. All I could make out was that he was wearing dark clothes, and I could never make out his face. It was always somehow hidden.\n\n\n\nAnother week passed by and my paranoia grew. I was working late one night and had missed the last bus home. The rural roads of which I had to walk were completely engulfed by the shadows of the night.\n\n\n*Great.* I Huffed to myself.\n\n\n\n*Clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop.*\n\n\n\nHis footsteps seemed to appear from nowhere again, and I instantly stopped and held my breath. They echoed and bounced all around me, and they had a hauntingly hypnotic rhythm.\n\n\n\n*Clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop.*\n\n\n\nIt almost resembled the sound of heels, or... hooves, perhaps?\n\n\n\nI immediately turned to identify the source.\n\n\n\nHe was close, yet, still too far away to make any sort of resounding features. He was tall and thin, though. Very thin. And very tall. He was wearing a long, black and hooded robe that covered him entirely. So again, I couldn't see his face.\n\n\n\n\nThe next time I heard his footsteps, I was on my way to meet friends for some drinks. I had to once again walk the darkest of roads, and that's when that gut-wrenching, heart-pounding, '*clip-clop*', made my whole jaw clench and my eyes pop wide open.\n\n\n\n*Clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop.*\n\n\n\nI walked faster.\n\n\n\n*Clip-clop, clip-clop.*\n\n\n\nMy walk soon turned into a jog...\n\n\n\n*Clip-clop, clip-clop.*\n\n\n\nHis steps were unwavered, never losing or gaining speed, yet it seemed as though he was always behind me.\n\n\n\n**CLIP-CLOP!**\n\n\n\n...I ran.\n\n\n\n\"Aaaargh! Ja-ja-just fuck off and leave me alone will you!\" I yelled. My body was running on 10% adrenaline and 90%fear.\n\n\n\nI did an awkward head turn while still trying to outrun him, causing my body to bend, twist and contort. Gravity took care of the rest.\n\n\n\nI hit the road, hard, and I felt the sudden pain in multiple places.\n\n\n\n*Clip, clop...clip, clop*\n\n\n\nI suddenly stopped breathing as I realised he was now standing directly behind me.\n\n\n\nI slowly rolled over onto my back, looked up, and saw his thin and crispy body standing above me, his skin was wriggling and writhing through his flapping, flowing robes. His outer layer breathed and moved like some sort of liquid dust, and in the centre of his tiny mass, there was a small but deep slice, slowly emitting a thick, black smoke.\n\n\n\nThe hood to his robe fully surrounded his head, so once again, I *still* couldn't see his face.\n\n\nI had absolutely no words for him, and I think he somehow knew that. He slowly raised his right arm and pointed to something behind me.\n\n\nThe unaware driver of the van finally looked up from his phone as he came speeding towards me. He panicked and fumbled, but somehow managed to swerve in time and miss me. Miss *us*.\n\n\nThe van collided with a nearby tree at full speed and crumbled instantly. There was no way the driver had survived.\n\n\nThe black hooded figure looked down at me, turned and looked at the crash, then back at me again. \n\n\nHe nonchalantly shrugged his shoulders and walked away towards the crash. As he approached the drivers body, I heard him scream a thousand screams, and raised his arms to remove his hood...\n\n\n*POOF!*\n\n\nAnd just like that, he disappeared.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/116zie8/graveyard_terror_in_wisconsin/",
        "text": "Hey all, I just wanted to start this off by saying, if you're in small town called Edgerton Wisconsin and you go out in the woods, graveyard or any part that isn't downtown at night be wary. I grew up in this town and some of the most terrifying experiences in my life happened here. I want to talk to you about one specifically. I will call this There is Something Lurking in the Graveyard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was when I was in 11th grade. I had just met my now best-friend let's call him Mark. We were both talking about supernatural sightings in the area that day. We recently had unexplained news about large footprints in the area the police had chalked it up to a wolf.\n\nA little backstory on the town. It's a very old tobacco down originally founded in 1853 and quickly rose to the tobacco center of Wisconsin. Edgerton is a town of less than 6,000 people. It's mostly full of rednecks that are looking to get drunk after work. So, why is this such a hotspot for supernatural activity? \n\nThe Blackhawk Indian tribe used to live on the lands on where they're founded. Edgerton city council had dug up burial grounds to make the graveyard. Not only is this a very terrible idea, but they missed some of the most specific things about a graveyard. \n\nThere is a tomb of the unknown soldier which nobody knows the history of or where it came from. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, on to the story: \n\nOn a Friday night my buddy decided that he was going to stay at my house and play video games. We spent most of the night playing Halo 3 and just demolishing people online. We had a great time. Now, this was before we started drinking and smoking so this was a completely sober evening for us. At about midnight we started talking about ghosts, and individual experiences and had the random idea to go to the graveyard. At this point, we had no idea what we were about to stumble upon.\n\nNow, we decided to climb out the window down on to the driveway where we continued to walk down the cul-de-sac that was Dakota Dr. I remember feeling watched from the get-go. I don't necessarily know how else to explain it. We walked up a hill to where a former friend of mine was and I just noticed something even stranger. The darkness of the night was encroaching around us. I had kept this to myself as I thought I was just experiencing things differently. The number one thing I noticed that this night was very different was the light around the lamp posts was barely shining. It made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck.\n\nWe walked along the sidewalk both silent. I don't know if it was because we were both experiencing the same thing but something just felt like it was leading us along. The feeling of being watched only got stronger the closer we got to the graveyard. My entire instinct was telling me to turn around and go home, but I couldn't.\n\nThe pathway to the graveyard was on a sidewalk along the highway. It was a heavily forested area with a ton of trees. I just noticed it kept on getting darker and darker the closer I got to the graveyard. I remember at one point trying to speak to my buddy and nothing came out. I just kept on marching on.\n\nWe had been walking about twenty minutes at this point and nearing the entrance of the gate. I held my hand up and could barely see it. The dark felt unnatural. I remember hearing a stick break up ahead and I put my hand on Marks shoulder making him stop. He shook out of whatever trance we were in and we both looked at each other confused. We didn't remember getting here right away.  \n\nI shook my head and looked at Mark, I motioned that we should head back to the house trying to keep quiet. I noticed even at this moment I wasn't able to speak. At this point in time, we were both interrupted by a \"Help\" voice that came from the graveyard itself.  As far as I could tell this was coming from the tomb of the unknown soldier. Mark almost started to run into the graveyard, and I stopped him by grasping his shoulder. At this point I was fog-headed and was barely keeping myself from running in as well. \n\nI could feel the strands of hair along my neck going up again. We were both frozen. We tried to run but couldn't. Time seemed to pass super slowly at this point, I'm not sure if it was the adrenaline or if it was something else entirely. This was the same feeling I felt when the trance had originally begun. I shook myself out of it and quickly shook my buddy so he didn't step back into the grasps of whatever was hunting us. \n\n\"Help me\" We heard again louder but on the opposite side of the road like it was trying to get us to run away from the lights no matter how dim they looked to us. I motioned to Marc to head back to the gas station so we could be where people were. \n\nEvery step felt heavy, we couldn't run, we could barely walk more than a few steps per 30 seconds. It was like something was trying to keep us there. As we started to get closer to the end of the steel fence of the graveyard, we saw it. Something was standing in the back, it looked like it was coming out of the grave. It stood about twelve foot tall was super dark and looked like a shadow with yellow eyes. It looked like something was coming out of its head. \n\nIt started to walk toward the footsteps that we were making, and I realized its sense of hearing was what it relied on. I put my mouth on Mark so he wouldn't scream and motioned to quietly walk that way. The less noise we made the easier it was to walk. We walked quietly but quickly passed the graveyard and didn't look back. I tried to pay as little attention to it as possible.\n\nWe eventually made it to the gas station and since we were underage and breaking curfew decided against going in and tried to make it home. The darkness seemed to return back to normal as we made it back to our cozy cul-de-sac and then back to my house. We climbed back into the window and was very uncertain that what happened was even real. We didn't say a word and just decided to go to sleep as we were both mentally drained.\n\nThat night didn't end there. This is something I never even told Mark as it was something that I had always chalked up to as a nightmare until recently. Something clicked that it was very, very real. I was woken up at about 3:00 am by a \"Get out of the house.\" Sound, it sounded barely human. Not the same voice as it was before. \"Hungry.\" I could swear that I heard. I put the blanket over my head and stayed in bed. That lingering urge to run into the night started to overcome me again. Somehow, I resisted it and stayed inside. \n\nI could hear it speak a few more times throughout the night, the one thing that sent a chill down my spine was I could swear I heard it say, \"Help me.\" In my friend Marks voice. I was to be frozen to even check in on him. He and I were staying in the same room at the time, so I figured he was safe. At one point and time I could swear I heard a dog yelp and the sound of chewing on bone. \n\nOnce that happened it seemed to stop, I no longer felt the urge to run out. I looked at the clock, 3:45. only 45 minutes had passed, and it felt like hours. I stayed up until the sun hit and didn't sleep.\n\nAs the sun rays cracked through my windows, I could hear my stepdad get up to go to work and my mom slowly crawling out of bed to make breakfast. I had a sigh of relief and noticed Mark was still sleeping. Somehow, he slept through the whole night. I walked out to the kitchen and got my waffles and bacon that mom had made us and saw mom looking out the window a little distraught. \"What's wrong?\" I asked, she shook her head and said. \"Stay inside.\" As she went outside. I looked out the window and saw her go up to our crying neighbor. I decided to disobey my mom and go outside. There was the neighbor's dog, eaten down to just a few bones. There was blood everywhere. \n\nTo this day, we haven't said this story to anyone and kept this to each other. It is how we became best friends and to this day in our early 30s we still consider this what really bonded us to each other. I will leave you with this, if you're ever out in the middle of the night in Edgerton Wisconsin. Stay safe, in the light where people walk. The bars lit up at night and the gas station with the one stop light in town. Or you might end up like the Wilkerson's dog and not as lucky as Mark and me.",

        "text": "I sat and waited, legs crossed, back straight, eyes ahead. If someone would have taken a photo of me at that moment, it would have been *good*. Just saying. Yes, my hair was disheveled and there was the tiniest bit of blood trickling from the back of my head, but despite the dread and the nerves, I was feeling prepared. \n\nI couldn't hear the storm and the scratching anymore. All that was left was a tense kind of silence. The calm before the storm. And then, all of a sudden, the storm materialized right in front of me, his form, as per usual, that of a middle-aged man in sweatpants. His bare feet kicked up on the small tv table and his arms crossed behind his head. He leaned back on the sofa, grinning at me with brazen self-evidence, eyes twinkling. \n\n\"Miss Novak.\"\n\n\"Why is it that everytime we meet, you have to terrorize me in some unforeseen way?\"\n\n\"Doesn't that make things more interesting?\"\n\n\"For you or for me?\"\n\nHe let out a soft chuckle before looking around. \"Hey… where's the company?\"\n\n\"I sent them both away for this.\"\n\n\"Oh, so the kids are with the sitter and you got me alone, that what you're saying?\"\n\nI grunted. \n\n\"So, little forest bride, finally ready to talk shop? Where is the sleeper?\" he inquired, leaning forward on his knees. \n\n\"Firstly, let's just establish a couple things. You only ever asked me for its location, not to hand it over or anything. So if I just tell you where to find it—and that's *all*—then you won't retract the protection your huldufólk grants the woods?\" \n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" I said slowly. \"Seeing as we can't avoid this conversation any longer. The sleeper used to rest beneath the meadow with the red flowers on it, in the dead body of an ancestor of mine.\"\n\n\"Good girl! Then let me—Wait, did you say *used to*?\"\n\nI smiled thinly. Despite the relative calm I'd found myself in before, I was getting a little… let's call it *itchy*. \"It's not there anymore. I knew what you would do with it, because, um, you told me. And I know it would turn the tide; it would grant you power even over my corner of the world. If you would even get so far. The sleeper is a powerful entity, and it would defend itself. It would lay this place to ashes.\" I took a deep breath, fixing him with a stare. \"So I removed it.\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\" Nick's smile had frozen over on his face. The expression was even more affected and unsettlingly fake than all the ones I'd seen him wear before. \n\n\"I removed it. It's inside of me now.\"\n\nSilence. For a moment, all the Devil did was hold my gaze. His mouth had turned into a thin line. This was the first time I'd seen his features derailing. *Wow,* I thought, *I actually got him to shut up for once.*\n\n**Telling him was the easy part,** the soothing voice in the back of my head mumbled. \n\n\"Inside of you,\" Nick echoed. \"*Inside* of you?\"\n\n\"They make for a very pleasant roommate. Bodymate. Uh, that sounded dirty.\"\n\nDespite himself, Nick let out a little chuckle. \n\n\"Anyways, we're both pretty happy about the arrangement. So… I'm not going to give it to you.\" \n\n\"So there's something you've probably said to both my servant *and* me,\" Nick remarked. \n\nThis time, I stifled a giggle. \n\n\"I'm not going to lie to you, Fiona, this is a bit of a shock. And an inconvenience. I should probably tell you though, it doesn't change my plans,\" he went on. \"It's too bad that it has to be like this, because honestly, I…\" He tipped his head back in thought. \"Huh. Actually, no, I wouldn't say I like you. But I guess I don't *mind* you. I wouldn't have minded having you downstairs someday either. Like I said, if a woman such as yourself were to have Hettmann's children—\"\n\n\"Don't finish that sentence.\"\n\n\"Anyways, I'd rather deal with the fallout with Jacek than pass up the opportunity to feed on your sleeper. And if that means I have to pry it out of you, well, then… so be it.\"\n\n\"You do know that killing me won't solve anything? The Redness spent hundreds of years inhabiting a preserved dead body of its choosing. So even if I were to die, that doesn't mean it would just float right into your mouth.\"\n\nThe Devil grinned widely. \"Then let's find out how big the smallest piece of you it could possibly survive in would have to be.\"\n\nI forced my face to remain impassive, but my voice broke midway through the sentence I next spoke, causing me to repeat myself. \"And what would you do if I won?\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\n\"If you'd attack me and I'd end up overpowering you and winning the fight, what would you do?\" I asked.\n\nNick let out a soft laugh. \"I think we'd best cross that bridge if and when we get to it.\"\n\n\"Let's take this outside,\" I suggested, rising to my feet and gesturing at the front door. \n\nThe Beast chuckled to himself but followed nevertheless as I walked over and opened it for him. The same black maw greeted the two of us, the absence of all light and sound awaiting at my doorstep. *But it wasn't real.* Nick was messing with my brain again.\n\n**Have no fear,** the Evening Redness whispered to me, and for a brief moment, I saw a glimpse of the real outside world; the sky, the snow, the treeline, before it changed back to that sinister, sense-numbing darkness.\n\n\"After you,\" Nick invited. \n\nI took a deep breath and stepped outside. I heard the door fall shut behind my back. \n\nI was relieved to feel the soft ground beneath my feet, the familiar crunch accompanying each of my steps. It really was all in my head. Still, being stripped of one's perception of reality is nothing short of disturbing, so I'd be lying if I said it had no effect on me. Turning around, I couldn't see Nick anywhere. He was effectively hiding himself, making use of my impaired vision. He'd really gotten up close and personal with that mind of mine. I felt like he was running his slippery fingers directly through my head, touching my skull from the inside. \n\n*Please,* I reached out to the sleeper. *You can't leave me hanging now.*\n\n**I don't intend to. How far are you willing to let me in?**\n\n*However far it takes.*\n\nAnd then, as if a switch had been flipped, the world was fully illuminated again. I could see everything, myself, the house, the sauna, the meadow—and Nick, standing a few feet away from me with a scowl on his face. \n\n\"You can stop trying,\" I told him. \"I'm not alone, it's not gonna be that easy.\"\n\n\"Then just let it be known that you *chose* to do this the hard way.\" \n\nWith that, he threw his head back, a gash suddenly splitting his throat. Dark liquid came splattering out and I backed off in shock, only to realize that it wasn't a wound at all—it was an opening. A dark gap with the rest of his human body flailing beneath it like it was no more than a ragdoll. A romper made of skin being discarded as *something else* climbed out from inside of it. \n\nThe legs came first. One by one, sixteen long, slender ink-black limbs pushed themselves out of the suit of flesh, producing a wet squelching noise as they unfolded, displaying far too many unnaturally bending joints. They ended in cloven hooves, each of them coming down on the ground with a stomp, whirling up the pristine, powdery snow. Then the rest of the body emerged. It looked kind of like a horse or a goat, small in comparison to its enormous leg span. It didn't really have a head, just three large, round eyes sitting in the middle of its misshapen torso. \n\nI wanted to puke. I wanted to scream and squeeze my eyes shut, hide my face in my hands. But I did none of those things. I didn't turn away. I stood upright, rooted to the spot, my hands clenched into trembling fists at my sides. The thing was towering above me, growing ever taller as it stretched to its full height, its spindly legs straightening. I had to crane my neck to continue looking up at it. Granted, there may have been more in the grand scheme of things, but at that moment, I was certain that this was the most nightmarish thing I'd ever seen. My entire body, every last instinct, all my good senses were screaming at me to run; every fiber of my being was trembling in fear of this entity, this living, breathing terror. Part of me wanted to throw myself at its feet, to offer up anything and everything and to beg for forgiveness just so I'd be rid of this sight… but I didn't. \n\nI stayed on my feet, eyes trained on Nick's new form, gritting my teeth so hard I was afraid they'd splinter. I didn't allow myself to tremble. I didn't allow myself to weep. I forced my mind to stop racing, willed my thoughts into order.\n\n*Are you there?* I asked the sleeper.\n\n**I'm here.**\n\n*I need to best him now. It's time. Are you ready?*\n\n**I'm at your command,** it said softly. **You are my conduit, my channel and my mistress. Make use of me as you see fit.**\n\nI took an uncertain step forward, stumbling as if prodded by an aggressively encouraging parent standing behind me. *How?* I found myself growing desperate, my heart pounding wildly as I tried to figure out what to do. \n\n**Just do it. Do what you must; whatever you need. Trust yourself. Trust us.**\n\nI raised my head, biting my lip as my gaze found the one of the sixteen-legged horror looming overhead. Nick's three eyes focused on me, and even in the beyond surreal form he was in, I thought I could see that familiar, mocking glint in his stare. I began to walk. Step by step, I moved towards him. One of his hooves lifted and came down upon me, and I dodged only at the very last second. The movement felt effortless. I don't even remember *deciding* to do it, or feeling alarmed by the threat of the impact, it all just kind of… happened. \n\n**You shall not fear.**\n\nI picked up my pace, starting to run towards the nearest leg. \n\n**You will not fall.**\n\nI jumped. I jumped farther and higher than I ever had before, adrenaline rushing through my body, adrenaline and *Red*. \n\n**You will not fail.**\n\nBefore Nick could react, I had already thrown my arms around the limb, fingers digging into the flesh with a strength I was sure a previous version of myself could never have mustered. The leg felt unlike anything I'd felt before. It was like a continuous squirming cramp of muscles beneath the pitch-black fur, wriggling beneath my touch as though every inch of it was alive and had a mind of its own. I swallowed the bile rising in my throat. Like an athlete scaling a mountain, I began to pull myself up. I climbed the giant's leg at a steady pace, clinging on despite his attempts to shake me off, despite the frantic stomps, the furious growls and tremors. Finally, I pulled myself onto the round torso. It made me feel like I was standing on a platform, almost as high up as the treetops. \n\nNick began to thrash around more fiercely, then, almost dancing on the spot as he attempted to buck me off. I felt like a rodeo clown, holding onto his stretchy, hairy skin like the horn on a saddle. \n\n\"What are you even doing?\" \n\nThe Devil's voice came from nowhere in particular. He had no mouth in his current form, but he wasn't speaking to me from inside my head either—his voice was rolling across the meadow like a thunderclap. I dragged myself towards his uppermost eye, hanging my head to glare down into it from above. The wind was whipping my lace-covered back, causing me to flatten my body against that of the Beast. I felt distinctly reminded of the position I was in when I'd peered at him hiding under my bed.\n\n\"Get off, you stupid bi—\"\n\nBefore he could finish his sentence, I plunged both my hands into the glazed surface of his eye. The squishy flesh gave way immediately and I felt warm, thick liquid swirling around my fingers. I had no idea what this form of his was made up of, but it was corporeal enough to be injured. And when Nick's agonized, bellowing shriek echoed across the expanse of the grassy plain, I knew that I had done just that. I pulled my hands back out with as much force as I could muster, drawing another cry from the Devil. But as soon as I sat back, he reared up again, this time managing to throw me off. \n\nI was sent flying through the air, and before I knew it, I was already falling, nearing the ground in a flurry of white tulle as my skirt fluttered around me, inflating like a balloon. I closed my eyes, bracing myself for a collision I was sure I wouldn't survive, only to find that it never came. Instead, the snow beneath seemed to catch my fall like a soft, silky net. \n\n**You will not fall.**\n\nI rose to my feet. Nick's form had begun to twist and warp, his legs twitching like those of a dying insect. His entire body seemed to collapse into a heap of vibrating dark matter, a heap of half-fleshy, half-nebulous mass. \n\n**Go on. Bring an end to this nonsense.**\n\nI took a deep, cleansing breath, steadying myself as I proceeded towards him. *He can't fully materialize anymore. You did something strange when I stuck my hands into his eye, didn't you?* \n\nThe sleeper sounded pleased with the question. **Something effective. Something you made possible.**\n\n*Thank you.*\n\n\"Old Nick,\" I called out. Somehow, I felt his attention on me. And then I realized it. It wasn't just that he couldn't hold a form anymore—he couldn't move. Couldn't leave. \"I wanna talk. Are you listening?\"\n\n\"What have you done to me?\" he pressed out, somehow still able to speak. He didn't sound anything like himself, though.\n\n\"Honestly? No idea. But you're trapped. Do you understand? You can't get away from here. You can't leave this place.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because this ground is not yours to command. Because you're weak here, and now you're hurt. And most importantly, because I won't let you,\" I responded. \"*We* won't let you.\"\n\n\"So that's your grand plan? Keep me here forever? You can't do that.\"\n\n\"For long enough at least to make you really fucking uncomfortable. Now, we can talk about this. It doesn't need to be like this, but goddamn if I'm not gonna deliver. If you want to play it like this, then so am I. I will keep you on my land for as long as I possibly can, and we're gonna find out just how many days or weeks or months or years that'll be. But remember, this is my land, my home—yours is all the way down in hell, and who knows if there won't be someone else taking on your responsibilities while you're away.\" I allowed a smile to creep up on my face. It was only a teensy bit forced, too. \"I'm just gonna get comfortable.\"\n\nFor a beat, he stayed silent. Then, \"What do you want?\"\n\n\"I want the huldufólk to stay on my side. I want you to forget about every last issue you have with me. You'll stop terrorizing me, stop appearing around the house or in my room and you'll stop creeping on my brother. Casimir, that is. You can do whatever you want with Jem. And you won't try to get the Evening Redness. I won't let you consume it, and you'll never have power over this place; neither will anyone else. These are my woods. Mine.\"\n\n\"Understood,\" he wheezed as the sleeper and I tightened our grip on his essence. \n\n\"Oh, and your valet? He's mine. I mean, if he wants to be. Don't even think about grounding him or doing anything to keep him away from me.\"\n\n\"You don't want him to stay here full time and attend you?\"\n\n\"That's not a relationship, that's a hostage situation. He wants to work for you, he can do whatever. I don't care. But whatever beef we got, don't take it out on him. And don't use him against me ever again. Deal?\"\n\n\"Fair enough.\"\n\n\"You agree, then?\"\n\n\"Yes! Yes, for fuck's sake!\" he spat.\n\n\"And don't even care to try and find, like, a loophole here or whatever. Don't come after me. Don't *ever* mess with me again.\"\n\n\"I won't!\" He sounded angrier than I'd ever heard. \n\n\"I got your word on that?\" \n\nA heavy sigh. Then, \"You do.\"\n\nMy heartbeat slowed considerably. \n\n**Let him go?** the Redness inquired.\n\n*Let him go,* I confirmed. \n\nNick's form immediately shrank into the human body I'd grown accustomed to. His skin was red again, streaked golden. As he was lying on the ground, he bore a strange hint of unearthly grace. He pushed himself up on his arm, tired eyes glaring up at me in pure, angry frustration. It was a look I knew well, though. I'd seen a close approximation of it nearly every time I'd looked in the mirror these last couple nights. I smiled thinly at him. \"Get out of here. And don't come back.\"\n\n\"Believe me, I won't,\" he hissed. \n\nNot another word left his lips before he sank down into the ground, disappearing right before my eyes. I let go of the deepest sigh in history. \n\nI went back inside and sank right into the cushions of my couch. \n\n*If you want, you can go back to sleep now,* I told Red.\n\n**I'd be very grateful for that. Call upon me anytime, and I will wake.**\n\n*I'll remember that. Thank you.*\n\nMy head felt empty. Empty and free and light. Almost like I was drunk on relief. Or maybe it was merely the fatigue. I pulled out my phone and texted Cas. \n\n*\"Broooooo. Come back, I miss you.\"*\n\nYup, that many O's.\n\nSo that was embarrassing enough; I don't really know what drove me. You don't even wanna know what I texted Jacek. I proceeded to drag myself upstairs and draw a bath which I hopped into without further ado. After soaking for a blissful hour, I dried off and put a fresh, pristine white gown on. I returned downstairs, laid down on the sofa and fell asleep. I'm unsure how long I was out for, but when I woke up, I found Cas nestled against my shoulder and Jacek's head resting in the fluffy folds of my skirt. I didn't even hear them come in, and they're out cold. \n\nAll of this is still so odd to me. This started out as nothing but a rant about wannabe internet cryptid hunters, and now we're, well, *here*. It's hard to believe. And what's even stranger is that I'm happier than I've been in a very long time. I'm really grateful for all the support. \n\nThere's still a lot that needs straightening out here. There's a creature out there that pretended to be an angel to fuck with me and my estate, and they're sure as shit not going to get away with it. The sleeper also needs some more gentle love and care; I've got a couple ideas about our arrangement that I want to pitch to them. But for now, I'm just glad I get to sleep. Finally.\n\nGuess I'll see you guys soon.\n\n[X](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrypticPark?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)\n\n[Part

        "text": "Reading horror tales, watching horror movies, series, even comic books, the usual reader always asks themself, “Why don’t people just fucking leave that haunted/dangerous/bizarre place?”. Well, I happen to live in such a place. My hometown is known for it’s dark and often uncanny history. However, I have learned throughout time that living in a place with such (well-deserved) reputation can be quite beneficial, both for me and for my co-inhabitants. I’ll show this through two examples, and then I’ll explain how the events were actually good for us. \n\nI was born in the august of 1979, on the small, rural Brazilian city of Horizontes Antagônicos. From the day I was born, my elders taught me how to survive and avoid trouble in our little town. I took their advice to heart. Always did. I memorized each one of the various uncanny written or unwritten rules of our town. And as a lawyer with expertise on the legal system does, I became able to navigate in these thunderous waters with ease. \n\nNow, I’ll tell you two events which some people call creepy that happened in our town during my lifetime, which will later prove my point. \n\n///\n\nThe first one is the disappearance of Alonso Gonzalez. Alonso was a close friend of mine, we studied on the same school since we were toddlers. We always sit together in class, we always played football (Or as Americans call it, soccer) together after school, on Saturday and Sundays we would go to each other’s house to watch the morning cartoons... We were really good friends.  \n\nIn the last Friday of August of 1990, Alonso and I went to the football field (In fact it was just a park with overgrown grass and one rusty crossbar. The other one had been removed a long time before and substituted by two old traffic cones.) As usual, we played with our friends, but it was more of a informal training. We were part of the school football team, and we would soon be competing against the guys from the other schools in town. It had been nearly a decade since our school last won the Horizontes Antagônicos sub-12 Football Championship, and the director promised us that should we win the trophy in that year, our grades could “accidentally” be altered to benefit us in the future. For some stupid reason, parents used to prefer to put their kids in schools where their offsprings would learn to kick a ball rather than studying. \n\nOur team was doing great, and I’m not being hyperbolic. We had practiced had throughout the year, and with our determination and training, we were sure we would win or at least come close to wining the championship. I mean, most of us, at least. Alonso, as good a friend as he was, he wasn’t performing very well lately. He used to be one of the best players in our team, rivaling even the captain or me sometimes. The thing is, Alonso had started smoking cigarettes. I don’t know why, he never told me, or how he was obtaining cigarettes, since selling them to minors was prohibited and he was way too young to know the shady corners of the town (Or so I thought). What I do know is that the constant dose of nicotine and other toxic substances was already impacting his health. \n\nAlonso could barely run ten meters without getting all tired and panting right now. We even tried to relocate him to the Gol, but even this wasn’t helping. I talked to him, to the coach, to the other players… But there wasn’t much anyone could do. Neither to help him or the team. Even if Alonso was doing bad, he still was one of our most able athletes, and our backups weren’t nearly as good as he was. \n\nSo, here in the town there’s a tradition which all football players have to follow before playing. I don’t know why. I don’t know when it started. I can’t even remember who told me about it, it had been always so basic as “you can’t touch the ball unless you are the goalkeeper”. I even assumed that it was tradition everywhere. Just before the game starts, the goalkeepers must shake hands and walk backwards towards their positions, where they must not utter a single word until the game officially starts.\n\nAs I previously said, the crossbars on our “training grounds” were a relic of other times, and were all rusty and breaking down. Alonso performed the commencement ritual as usual. We were not tense. That happened literally every football game, and we were completely used to it. It was like washing your teeth or locking the door, an automatic process. But the moment he stepped under the crossbars, they broke down, collapsing on him. In reaction, he cursed loudly. \n\nWe were surprised, but our coach was completely devastated. He wasn’t hurt or anything, but he had spoken before he was supposed to. We removed the broken metal bars, and our coach said that everyone needed to leave, and that he needed to take Alonso home as fast as he could. My friend was repeating that he was fine, he only got one or two bruises, but our coach simply grabbed him by his hand and ran to his car. In less than a minute, the vehicle accelerated and disappeared down the street. \n\nThat weekend Alonso didn’t show up to play with me or watch TV as usual. I had other friends, so it didn’t bother me very much. The next morning, when I arrived in school, Alonso was nowhere to be seen, which was weird, because he lived one block away from the school and was usually one of the first students to get there. The other boys from the team were also as puzzled about what happened as I was, and our main speculation was that maybe he suffered some sort of injury that only the coach noticed or something. A few of us didn’t even remember that he failed to conclude the commencement ritual. \n\nOne or two minutes in, the director shows up, with two of the teachers by his side. The principal told us that last Friday, during football training, Alonso got injured, and our coach (which was also our Physical Education teacher) had to take him to the hospital. However, on their way there, the car crashed into a tree and caught fire. The coach survived, although he was hospitalized, but Alonso disappeared. Emergency services were called to where it happened, but were unable to locate him, or at least his body. After searching the nearby woods on Saturday, it was concluded that he died and was consumed in the fire. No further explanations were given. We were given three days off-school. \n\nOne week later our coach returned, now wearing a plaster cast on his leg and another one on his neck. We tried asking several times what happened that day, but he would always change the topic or outright refuse to comment on the events. He wouldn’t explain how he got those claw scars all over his cheeks and arms, or why one third of his lips seemed to be gone. He also did not explain why his car crashed in one of the roads that led out of the town, instead of the one that led to the university hospital, the only hospital in town. \n\nWe imagined that Alonso’s family would pressure the cops into investigating more about what happened, as we knew that they barely bothered to look for him. Investigations on missing persons usually lasted for at least a week, and involved dozens of officers. In the case of Alonso they spent some 9 hours with four or five officers calling for Alonso and called him dead. However, this pressure never came. My friend’s family simply made a simple symbolic burial for him, and then literally vanished, selling their house and leaving for Uberlândia in less than three weeks. \n\n///\n\nThe second event I’ll be telling you is the Murder of Natalia Pires. This happened in the March of 1997. Similarly to the first tale, I knew Natalia personally, as we were from the same class at the time, but we were nowhere near as close as I was to Alonso. Natalia was the most beautiful and disputed girl on the class and arguably one of the most disputed in the town for guys of our age. I was frankly quite handsome and athletic, but her standards were simply too high. She ended up dating the captain of the school football team, Henrique, who was literally the definition of a jock. \n\nI will not be getting into much details, but they were quite naughty. I’m sure she was convinced by Henrique, but they frequently fooled around on the school’s bathroom, the woods surrounding the town, the gymnasium, among other places. Some people just like the thrill of almost being caught, you know. \n\nBut, they broke the rules. Be as kinky as you’d like, some things are just not supposed to happen in this city. One day Natalia and Henrique just didn’t show up in school. Horizontes Antagônicos would only get decent stable phone services and internet access around 2011, so we couldn’t call to ask what happened. Maybe they decided to skip school that day? Who knows. Henrique had already done it several times. Maybe he convinced Natalia. \n\nThe following day, again, they didn’t show up. However, like previously with Alonso, the director appeared to give us some really bad news. Natalia had died two nights before, and Henrique was temporarily hospitalized. Some of the most popular boys and girls broke into tears, as both were kind of the leaders of the social “elite” of the school. I would be lying if I said I was devastated. I found Natalia quite the eye candy, but had no interest in her since she rejected me. Henrique was a good player on the football team and we were very good playing together, but out of the sport we didn’t have a very profound relationship. \n\nWhat the director’s words (and subsequent three days off-school) really did were to light up the curiosity in the entire class: What specific rule had they broken to deserve such deadly fate? I am quite curious, so I was personally involved in figuring it out. \n\nAfter a bit of me and my friends asking around, we finally found the answers we sought. Apparently, two days before, Dona Vera, one of our local cat ladies at the time, was walking some of her cats to hunt mice or something in the woods, and suddenly stumbled upon a horrifying sight of Natalia and Henrique, literally impaled in two dead trees. She had already been dead for some time, but Henrique seemed to be still alive, albeit horribly injured. Dona Vera immediately ran back to the city and alerted the authorities. A very brief investigation occurred then (it literally took one day), and the police concluded that Henrique had impaled his girlfriend before attempting to impale himself. Later that day, the emergency services managed to remove him alive from that tree, and he was immediately taken to the state capital, where he spent eight months receiving several different extensive surgeries to reconstruct his entire digestive system. \n\nHenrique eventually returned to town, but in shackles and under escort for three police cars, as he was attending trial for being suspect of murdering his girlfriend. That was, however, a facade. The real reason he was sentenced to thirty years in jail and taken to a state prison outside town was because he and Natalia had been fooling around in the woods, and they’d probably angered something in the process, or were too sloppy and attracted something that got offended (or aroused) by their lack of discretion. And once you anger something you were not supposed to anger here in town, you can be pretty sure it will hunt you down for as long as you live. They also probably didn’t think he would survive the damn thing, so blaming him was the easiest scapegoat to explain whatever the hell impaled both of them in those trees. \n\nI visited Henrique in prison once in I think 2008 or 2009. I wanted to ask him personally what happened to him, even if it was a very sensitive question, I needed to know. But as soon as he saw me Henrique just started screaming desperately with what remained of his vocal cords, and the officers asked me to leave. Some years later I heard that he had been transferred to a mental ward. I guess the trauma messed up his brain. Poor Henrique. \n\n///\n\nNow, after seeing some of the cases of unexplained disappearances and gruesome deaths in our small town, you may be wondering: “How the hell did all of this benefit Horizontes Antagônicos?” You probably wonder why one would keep living in such a dark and deadly and bizarre and outright creepy-ass town, what’s the point in living somewhere like this. From which I’ll answer, this was never about benefiting the town as a whole, but rather about benefiting it’s residents, mainly those that still lived, and mainly oneself, of course, me. Obviously, everyone has different reasons to keep living here (and loving our small town), but I assure that from what I see and know about my neighbors, they’re not very different than mine.\n\nLet’s review the first case I presented. Alonso was my friend, but he was simply dragging our team down. I didn’t and still don’t care why he was smoking, but it was severely undermining our potential, and our coach was too afraid to do something which could harm his feelings. Coach was a good lecturer and trained us well, but when it came to being practical, he was lacking.\n\nI tried talking to Alonso, to our coach, to the team, even to his parents, but nothing was working. We were on the verge of going to a match with a guy who couldn’t run for more than ten seconds without nearly collapsing. As important to me as Alonso was, I couldn’t risk losing the championship (and the possibility of getting good grades where I otherwise wouldn’t) because my best and closest friend couldn’t stop his stupid smoking habit.\n\nI knew that when the goalkeeper said something between the shaking of hands and the game officially starting, something bad would happen. I though it would be more of a penalty card, and not some unknown entity literally taking him and vanishing, but… It ended up being good for the team. Alonso was replaced by a much more able and motivated goalkeeper, and we would go on to win the championship, with the trophy being celebrated on his honor. It was totally worth it to spend the entire previous night bending and trying to break those crossbars, in a way that they became so fragile that if you so much as breathed under them, they’d collapse, as they did. \n\n///\n\nIn the second story I told you, I showed you what happened to Henrique and Natalia, and their ridiculously gruesome fates. Again, as with Alonso, there are parts that I omitted. Henrique and Natalia, weren’t, in fact, getting intimate in odd places as I suggested. Those were fabrications created and spread by me. The thing is, as I mentioned, Natalia was the hottest girl in town, but it was unfair that she could only be Henrique’s. He, too, made me a bit envious. Henrique was not only strongest, richest and more capable than me in many things, as well as being captain of the football team, but he barely made any effort to do so. It was so easy for him, it was almost cheating. Natalia was just the cherry on the cake. \n\nDuring my adolescence, I liked to take long walks in the woods at night, for reasons that are not relevant for me to discuss right now. That’s how I knew that little couple used to have secret romantic conversations in the woods, though it very rarely went beyond talking and handholding and PG-13 stuff. It made me angry nonetheless. I liked to watch them, to feel all that rage and hatred flowing through my veins. I found an empty space in the husk of a toppled tree nearby and I would watch them all night long, for as long as they were there, and the following day I would play football with Henrique like nothing was happening. But it was. I heard everything they talked about. Their insecurities, their fears, what they liked to eat, even very intimate stuff. That’s how I found out about Natalia’s phobia of frogs.\n\nThey also knew the rules, as I and everyone in town did. When at the woods at night, if you value your life, avoid making high-pitched noises or running. (In truth you should avoid the woods at all at night, but they were safe 70% of the times). So one Sunday-night, as they always did, Natalia and Henrique were there on their romantic place, talking and doing romantic shenanigans and whatever people in love do. I was waiting for them. I had been for hours. And then I quietly left my hideout and walked towards them. \n\n“Bro, what you’re doing here?” Henrique said, shocked to see me covered in ground-dirt, grass, and probably some insects, three hours after sunset, in a unmarked location, ten-minutes away from the nearest trail, deep in the woods. In my hands there was a small wooden box. Natalia was visibly surprised, but I couldn’t make much of her face, as he immediately stepped in front of her.\n\n“I just wanted to give this to you guys.” I said as I opened my box and let the frog I had brought with me out. Natalia instinctively loudly screamed, but only for some three seconds, before her boyfriend blocked her mouth with his hand. They looked at me. First with an expression of shock, then rage, then fear and finally dread.\n\n“W-why?!” Henrique asked, staring at me, still not knowing what to do. We could head fast, heavy steps, approaching, and breaking twigs as they did so. I smiled and sat down, closing my eyes and tapping my ears to avoid seeing and hearing whatever was coming closer. Henrique tried to fight whatever it was, but he obviously didn’t succeed. A few minutes later, when I felt the thing getting away enough for it to be safe to look, I saw both of them, impaled on those now-dead trees. \n\n“Don’t worry, pal. I’ll be a better team captain.” I whispered as I collected my frog, which was still in the floor, and left them to enjoy the rest of their little romantic meeting. If they were so happy together, surely they would enjoy being together for eternity.",

        "text": "I don't know if I ever really liked dreams.\n\nSome people talk about the really good, eventful or even bad ones that they remember having.\n\nI'm slowly poking at my keys right now &amp; staring at this blinking cursor because if I'm gonna be honest- I'm stalling. Don't know whether it's out of embarrassment, or shame or what, but I'm not the type to get touchy-feely with emotions or vulnerability so.. 'here goes' I guess.\n\nI remember the bad ones. \n\nI know you might be thinking \"yeah, sure everyone has nightmares\". But I mean the like.. really, bad ones. The kind you can't forget, with details so perfect? Yeah okay, now we're on the same page. It gets a little worse though.\n\nAround 1994? My family moved across many state lines to be closer to the rest of our relatives and so that my grandparents could be more involved with four year-old me. Cozy little house in a small city, very friendly neighborhood, pretty place and whatnot. My first like, REAL memories happened sometime that year. You know how kids typically have \"childhood amnesia\" or whatever until BOOM, they develop function to retain real memories? That. And mine was a doozy.   \nIt's also when I got to discover two things: One - sleep paralysis. Two - hypnopompic hallucinations. Though I didn't know these things until far later in life. Anyway I'm stalling again.. Sorry whoever reads this.\n\nThe first memory I ever had was sitting on that cherry-brown cheap linoleum flooring with all the slightly off-white square border. It was a little textured to the touch but overall smooth and slightly dusty if you touched it. I think night was just arriving and my parents had the Lincolns (neighbors from across the street) over to become acquainted. Today I'm sure they were having some drinks and things. It was jovial, not super loud but a noticeable clamor of multiple grown-ups sharing stories in separate groups. I remember their legs passing by me often as they went between the house and outside to the back yard and so forth. \n\nWe had this toy when I was a kid. It sounds so stupid now but I think it was really popular. Basically a faded neon suction cup thing. You put it on a hard surface, then push the center down. After a few seconds it would pop up and maybe do a flip. I was playing with that when all of the adults relocated to what I assume was the bonfire outside. Two lights were on in the house; living room and kitchen. I was basically in what would become the dining room once we furnished the place. It was adjacent to the hallway section which began as a cross-shaped intersection leading to three rooms immediately.\n\nThe floor was nice and cool as night set in and I was laying on my side pushing the stupid cup down, watching it pop when I fell asleep. When I opened my eyes, I felt a little confused but it was immediately dismissed by what I assume is a child's attention span and lack of critical thinking.\n\n What I did notice was right there in the direction I was facing. The cross-shaped intersection. In the mostly unlit entryway, more toward one bedroom and the bathroom, was.. something. I could feel it in every little bone. I could almost -see- it. Looking right back at me. There were no adults nearby, but I could hear their voices faintly coming from outside, through the screen door. Frozen with fear newly experienced, I then tried to scramble away but found I could not move anything at all, not even a twitch. Queue the crying and I tried to yell \"Mumma!\" but nothing came out. I was so goddamn scared. And then the feeling of 'the thing' was gone and I could move, but I just curled up into a little defensive ball and sobbed until shortly after I remember my mother coming in from the kitchen (which led to the back yard) and consoling me.   \nThat was my first memory ever.\n\nFast-forward through a relatively happy childhood until I was eleven, when my older brother passed away in an accident, from there things kinda went a little squiggly. I became an addict of all kinds early in my teens which thanks to my preferences and a solid combination of imaginative cocktails, I slept very little and mostly ran on youthful endurance. This was when I stopped having dreams altogether, or I at least don't recall having them. After some counseling attempts throughout the years and a specifically unpleasant event, I was put into rehabilitation and successfully released at 17.   \nOf the many things I was treated for, one was drug-induced insomnia. \n\nWoohoo, sleep! Wait..  \nNot entirely sure when this occurred, but it wasn't too long after my release.   \nI had a -dream- that really shook me and reminded me of what I had forgotten as a child.   \nIn this dream I was in a forest. It was probably mid Fall, because the leaves were already browned and slightly dry/cracked. Somewhow the leaves above were still green, and the trees were almost identical- tall, thin and numerous. There was a very slight dip in elevation for a tiny clearing where my little buddy Cotton, my curly, white bishon frise dog was walking with me when we stopped. Immediately, I became what I now know as lucid. The feeling is like nothing I could ever describe. Waking up within your dream? It's like everything clicks into place at once with a cool breeze. Like you go from vaguely watching bits and pieces of a television show while you do something else, to being first and   \nfront-most in the main character's seat and everyone is waiting on you to deliver your line.   \nThat's when I felt wrong. A sense of dread filled me, and I got the feeling I needed to leave and I should NOT do anything else even move. But I did.   \nAgainst all warning signals firing off in my brain, I turned my head.\n\nThere was my cute little Cotton, sitting in the depression of leaves, looking up at me. Visually, nothing was off. The horror I was now experiencing, was because I could tell, I could feel, that he knew what was happening - no, he knew everything. Then he smiled. I woke up shouting and cut off mid-yell realizing what I was doing. Shaking, sweating, I started to laugh. Don't know why but maybe because I was thankful I could at least move and it was -just- a dream. Though I never forgot it.\n\nOver the next few years I had a few more fear-inducing lucid dreams, but no paralysis. I'd say maybe two times a year? I'll spare their details if only for brevity. Moving on..\n\nI think it was in 2010 when my oldest brother asked if I would watch his kids from noon to the next day. Sure, no problem! Free food, a nice place and about 100 more channels than my TV had? Sign me up, I said. The day went relatively normal. Played some games with my niece and nephew, fed them, watched a movie and put them to sleep. Finally I could watch what I wanted! So I sprawled out on the white leather couch and put his 72in plasma to the test. \n\nMy eyes open.\n\nI'm looking up at the ceiling, it's dark excepting the bits of moonlight through curtain gaps. TV must turn itself off after so long, cool. Something feels wrong- I can't move. Immediately that full body tingle hits me and every hair on my person rises. I'm panic looking around as much as I can, and that's when I notice. This is the most insane part to me, that I was entirely unaware until I caught a glimpse of my relative position to the coffee table. I was presently contorted. My heels and the back of my head/neck/shoulders touched the couch and the rest of me was arched up in the middle bit. Full-on panic set in and I could have died when I heard a voice coming from somewhere close or maybe in my head. It seemed so pleased and the worst part is, and I don't know how, but I felt like I -knew- it was my own voice. It said, \"I've found you.\" \n\nI tried screaming. Though I'd never screamed before because that's not what men do, I'm positive I attempted it right then because the sound I managed to gurgle out through a tongue and lips that didn't work was a long, pathetic whimper something akin to a broken-up, strangled Tarzan bellow.  \nThen I could move. The feelings were gone and I, not very proudly, gathered up the blanket draped his couch and quickly disappeared into it where I spent hours awake until I saw the light of morning.\n\nAmong other things, this lead me to a life of alcoholism. Drinking before work, during, after and into the wee hours of the morning until I embraced sweet oblivion and then promptly rose to a screaming alarm to do it all over again. \n\nOver a decade later and to another's benefit, I was hitting up Google for some sleep-related research when I went down a rabbit-hole of Reddit posts, which led me to topics on lucid dreaming and sleep paralysis. Those also led me to googling the conditions and just eating up all kinds of information I had never known prior. There were posts about people practicing lucid dreaming, using things like 'reality checks' and 'revisiting dreams', things of that nature. They would intentionally try to lucid dream, practicing throughout wakefulness with 'reality checks' by looking at certain objects, or hands, or saying \"Is this a dream?\" out loud. Some of the revisited dreams sounded great and all, but I can't remember one I'd like to go back to, seriously. \n\nOf course then, I couldn't stop myself from reading the posts from users with bad experiences, especially sleep paralysis in lucid dreaming. With no events in a long time, this awakened something in me and has me terrified to sleep tonight as I think my mind is going to automatically go over everything I've read to summon up a dark place. \n\nWhy would anyone want to remember what we see when we sleep.\n\nMy biggest takeaway from those articles on LD is having the ability to tell when you are or are not asleep. Wish I had that knowledge far earlier in life, but all the same.. I'm almost too afraid to say those four words. Would it even help to know when I'm asleep or not? \n\nWell, that's my story and thanks for following along. I feel pretty empowered by the anonymity of the internet, steeling my resolve to share this with you. So I guess since I'm being so honest here it couldn't hurt to give it a shot for laughs.\n\nIs this a dream?",

        "text": "I started dating my most serious boyfriend when I was a junior. I’d gone out with plenty of guys before, but this was different, mainly in the aspect that I really liked this guy. Before, it was just kind of something to do, you know? It was never a big deal until I met Judas.\n\nI know, what a weird name, right? He was a transfer student who joined our class in mid-December, two whole months after school had started, and he was pretty cute but not the kind of guy I’d usually go for. \n\nWell, despite that, I had a crush on him from the beginning. I don’t know what it was about him. He was attractive, but not a showstopper, one of those guys who looks like a movie star. There was just something about him that pulled you in, like a magnetic force. He was the kind of guy who you stared at in class but never made a move on; he had the kind of face that you’d doodle in your notebook without noticing.\n\nAnyways, I started dating him near the end of the year after I finally got the courage to ask him out, God knows how. He was a super nice guy. Polite, funny, a little socially awkward, but it wasn’t a huge thing. And eventually he ended up being the guy to take my virginity. But that's another story.\n\nSo yeah, Judas was my first everything, pretty much. Or the first one who was real. And then he ended up moving away again, something about his family’s job or whatever, and I never saw him again.\n\nIronically, the very day that he left was the day that my morning sickness started. At first I thought it was the flu, because it came with these awful pounding migraines, but there were no other symptoms. No chills, no fever, nothing. So, absolutely scared shitless, I went to Costco, bought a pregnancy test, peed on the stick, and when two lines appeared, I dropped it in the toilet and flushed it down, then threw out the whole box.\n\nSo now I was pregnant. This posed a huge problem, seeing as I was seventeen and my parents would literally kill me. I’d had a strict Catholic upbringing, and premarital sex was to them what murdering someone with your own hands would be to other parents.\n\nI whipped out my phone and Googled—and this is seriously the first thing that my brain told me to do—“*abortion cost in california*.” The results were unspecific and mentioned health insurance, which instantly brought to mind my parents going over the bills and seeing “YOUR DAUGHTER’S ABORTION” in big red letters, so that was out of the running. My only options were to miscarriage or to run away.\n\nOver the next few weeks, as my vomiting increased so much that at one point I had to convince my mom that I wasn’t bulimic, I found that I wasn’t hating the prospect of having a baby. At night, I was extra careful lying on my stomach, which was ridiculous, because at that point there wouldn’t have been much more than a clump of cells. I found myself talking to the baby idly, telling it about my day—I even decided that it was going to be a girl, and named her Maya.\n\nBut I swear I could hear her talking back sometimes. When I told her about my day, I could sometimes hear this reedy little voice responding, offering comfort, telling me that she loved me. I thought it was a normal thing—to hear your unborn kid talking to you in your mind. And the faster she grew, the more she spoke, the more defined her words became.\n\nAnd she grew *fast*. I even googled it to make sure that I was normal, which I certainly wasn’t: baby bumps aren’t supposed to be noticeable until well into the second trimester, but by my seventh week, I was having trouble fitting into some of my looser jeans. I began wearing big sweaters, which I could fortunately justify with the fact that it was now January, but I chewed my nails to shreds fretting about what I would do when March came around.\n\nI don’t remember the first time the baby moved, but I do remember the unease that grew each time after that. It wasn’t simply little kicks; at times it felt like the baby was physically trying to rip me open from the inside. By 16 weeks, I spent days on end lying in bed clutching my stomach, my insides roiling as the child inside of me jostled violently.\n\nSometimes, when it got particularly bad, I could see it happening in the mirror—seeing reptilian ripples travelling across my stomach, back and forth, like the lashing of a tail.\n\nAt 20 weeks, I started vomiting this gooey black phlegm. It coated the inside of my mouth and left a foul funk on my tongue that I could never get rid of, no matter how much water I swigged or how many times I cleared my throat.\n\nSometimes I got angry at the unborn child inside my womb. I thought that she was purposefully trying to ruin my life, that she made me this sick on purpose. The very thought just made me want to cry, but I hadn’t been able to produce tears in a while, I don’t know why. Maybe it was hormones or something. I always felt embarrassed when flashes of rage traveled through me in response to Maya’s movements. I was going to be a terrible mother.\n\nWhen I was six months pregnant, my “bump” became less of a bump and more of a prominent bulge. My stomach was distended and covered in veins; my skin took on a sickly pallor, and my appetite stopped entirely. Strangely, though I was eating less and less, Maya got more and more active. The movements were so violent that sometimes she would physically jerk me forwards.\n\nSome mornings, it became routine to wake up and peel layers of flesh that flaked off of my belly during the night, as if I were rotting from the inside. The phlegm didn’t stop either.\n\nOne night, Maya would not calm down, no matter what I did. I sang to her, I drank warm milk, I cried hysterically, I listened to music, and still she thrashed inside me as if enraged, flaying me from within. I was in tears, frustrated to the point of hysteria. So much so, in fact, that I dug my nails into my stomach and let out a guttural groan of frustration. And my tender skin was so papery and thin that I ended up ripping away a section of flesh the size of a playing card.\n\nThat was the first time I felt it: this dark, ravening force deep within me, urging me forward. Urging me to…eat it.\n\nThis black hunger was spoken in Maya’s voice. Whispering deep within me. A little girl’s voice, begging me to feast on my own torn stomach. On my own hot, thick blood.\n\nI tried it again—sinking my nails into my belly, carving up wedges of myself. And once I allowed myself to do it a second time, I lost it. I was unable to stop myself from pulling away lumps of tissue—not just little flakes, but whole palmfuls of the stuff, shredding my pregnant tummy into bloody strips as I bit my left hand to keep myself from screaming in agony.\n\nI couldn’t stop myself. I kept ripping myself apart, hot tears running down my face, blood staining the sheets and my legs and the hem of my shirt.\n\nI had to stop when I looked first at my hands, soaked to the knuckle in crimson, and then at my belly, which was covered in deep whitish-pink lacerations and spilling gore all over my pretty purple sheets. Shakily, I covered it up again with my shirt, pressing the fabric against the stinging incisions.\n\nAnd then—this was the strangest part—I noticed the actual hunks of discarded skin littered around me and felt that strange hunger, and before I realized quite what I was doing I was eating my own flesh. It was tangy and metallic with blood, and a little salty, though mostly tasteless, my teeth sinking through it easily. It slid so smoothly down my throat.\n\nFrom inside my stomach, Maya finally lay still.\n\nI knew that this wasn’t normal. There was something wrong with me and with my baby. But God, if she would finally just stop twisting inside of me like a snake, and stop forcing me to vomit everything in my stomach every night, then so be it.\n\nStrangely calm, I went downstairs. It was probably midnight, and my parents were fast asleep. I took a carving knife out of our kitchen cabinet and rotated it slowly in the moonlight streaming through the window.\n\nThen, before I could stop myself, I raised the knife and brought it down hard on my thumb, cutting five inches into the skin.\n\nThe pain wasn’t like I was expecting. It wasn’t just raw, scorching, fiery misery. It was a strangely clean feeling. Shiny, like the blade of the knife. I don’t know how to explain it.\n\nAnd I couldn’t stop. I was physically compelled to bite myself hard enough to bleed to stop my screams from coming out as I sawed through my bone and cut my finger off.\n\nMaya spoke again in that soft little girl’s voice, hungrily, desperately.\n\n*Eat. Eat.*\n\nI put my own bloody finger into my mouth and bit down hard, feeling my teeth crunch through bone. Warmth flooded my mouth as I gulped it down, nail polish crumbling down my throat. God, it hurt, but I felt so satisfied.\n\n*More*, that horrible whisper begged deep in my mind.\n\nBut now I was staring at the knife again, its blade lined with a slick of scarlet. Call me crazy, but something about it was so seductive that I just spent maybe three minutes staring at it, turning it over slowly in my hand, admiring that blade. I could feel myself getting wet looking at this weapon that moments before had literally severed away part of my body.\n\nI was still strangely calm, just aware of my skinned, raw stomach and the stump of my thumb that smeared every surface with blood. I felt sly, almost snakelike, as I crept back up the stairs and to the bathroom, patching myself up with rubbing alcohol and sterile white bandages, like I was in a hospital. All the while the knife was lying on the counter, glimmering in the light.\n\nI took the blade back up to my room, closing the door, and sat down on the bed with it, tracing its blade over my thighs. Not breaking skin, just barely touching it, trailing spirals and stars over my skin. My heart started to pound and I felt myself becoming more and more aroused by the second. It was only when I noticed the way I was digging the blade deeper and deeper into my skin, sending beads of blood rolling down my calf, that I felt my senses return to me.\n\nTerrified, I dropped it on the bed, getting to my feet, and in response Maya slithered inside me, filling my mind with unintelligible murmurs. I was shaking, drenched in cold sweat. Quickly, I shoved the still-bloody knife under my bed, a hand clamped over my mouth, wanting to retch my guts out.\n\nI can’t explain what I was thinking then. All that I know is that I was in some weird trance, and only now that I’d resurfaced—and that while I was running the blade over my legs, I had been so, *so* tempted to shove the knife inside me.\n\nBlade up.\n\nI don’t know how I managed to sleep that night, but I did. And life continued.\n\nThe urges vanished for a little while. My appetite was still gone. I was looking worse and worse for wear, and I couldn’t possibly hide my pregnant belly. \n\nMy mother knew. Maybe she almost knew. I could tell by the pained looks she shot me, the way she sometimes had to cover her eyes to stop her tears when she saw me. But my father was mostly oblivious. He was concerned about my bloating, and because he was certain in the notion that his daughter would *never* dare defy the scriptures and perform most unholy acts with a man before I was wed, he took me to the doctor to see if I had a tumor. And who would’ve guessed—I was well into my third trimester. Wow, what a surprise!\n\nHe took it much, much better than I expected. All the way home, I cried and begged him to speak to me, but he refused to say a word. His face was drained of all color, and he kept shaking his head and muttering under his breath. \n\nThe moment we stepped foot into the house, he was scurrying up to their bedroom to blab to my mother. He came downstairs not thirty seconds later and slapped me so hard that I saw stars and my ears rang. He screamed at me for three hours, calling me a disgrace, a horrible child, a whore, a filthy harlot. A blight on the family. And names much worse than those…\n\nI tried to contain my sobs as I told him about Judas, and how I’d wanted to get an abortion, but at the very word his face turned purple and his screaming started again. By the end of the night, I was curled up in bed with my hands over my ears, only Maya for company. I was shocked that they didn’t kick me out of the house entirely, but the worst they did was take away my phone and ban me from any kind of socialization—including school.\n\nI didn’t find that out until the next day, when I woke up at noon and ran downstairs in a panic, only to have my mother tell me, ashen-faced, “We’ve withdrawn you from education right now. You have chosen to sin, and now we must bring forth the product of your mistake.”\n\nI was in shock. “How’d you manage that?”\n\n“We’ve withdrawn you,” she repeated.\n\n“Wait. Did you *drop me out* of school?” I demanded.\n\nTears formed in her eyes, and she turned away and didn’t say a word to me.\n\nI’d fucked up, majorly. But that goes without saying.\n\nAnd all the while, I was getting more and more scared of myself and the strange urges that overtook me. Now that I wasn’t in school, I spent the whole day alone with myself. And with Maya.\n\nAnd with the knife under my bed.\n\nThree days. That’s how long I resisted the pangs in my stomach before I finally pulled it out. Somehow, with all of the pregnancy insanity, my missing finger had gone unnoticed— another blessing of my oversized hoodies—but I was acutely aware of how much harder it was to grip things with only four fingers. So this time, I peeled off my clothes and, naked in my room, dug the edge into my leg and plunged it in up to the handle before digging upwards again, loosing a slab of meat so large that the amount of blood that emerged when the knife came out was dizzying and nearly made me pass out.\n\nMy skin and bone tasted so good. I ate like a wild animal, smearing my face with viscera, bawling the entire time. And when I had finished that off, I shoved the knife back in, cutting away swathes of my leg. First one, then the other. And then hacking away parts of my arms, my chest, my butt. Until finally I was lying on the floor in a pool of my own blood, unable to move, feebly licking my own wounds. Literally lapping up the copious amounts of gore spilling out of me.\n\nOf course, my mom came running, bursting inside. She saw my entire body coated in scarlet, the knife lying next to me with its blade and handle dyed red, and screamed so loud that my head rattled.\n\nThat was how I ended up going to the hospital. My dad was driving, my mom in the backseat with me staunching my countless wounds. The car veered sharply around a fork in the road, and that’s when I felt it.\n\nMy water breaking.\n\nThat’s the last coherent memory I have of anything. I have blurry, distant flashes of being carried into the ER. Doctors in blue surgical masks wheeling me into a room. Shots injected into my arm that did nothing to lessen the searing torture flashing through my whole body. My own voice, impossibly deep, crying out in pain, speaking words I don’t understand.\n\nAnd Judas, showing up in the emergency room somehow, staring at me blankly as I heaved and shrieked and gave birth to his baby.\n\nI was faintly aware of the hours passing. Twilight falling outside the window of the ward. And still it went on, and on, and on. I wanted to rip myself apart. I wanted to die. I didn’t want to feel like this anymore, but it didn’t stop, it went on and on an on. I remember being certain that I had died, that I was in hell and this was my punishment for sinning with Judas.\n\nBeyond that, I have one memory of the actual birth. It was the horrified look on the doctor’s face when he pulled her out. I didn’t see Maya, didn’t get a glimpse of my baby girl, but I just remember the terror on his face, the way that the nurse fell back with a hand over her mouth.\n\nAfter that, there was darkness. It settled over me like a velvety blanket. I basked in the sweet relief of dreamless sleep, up until my eyes fluttered open and I found myself in a dark room, wearing my paper hospital gown stained with blood, and met Judas’s dark eyes.\n\n“Hello,” he said calmly, collectedly, as if there was nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n“Hi…?” My voice sounded awful. I pushed a sweaty clump of hair out of my eyes.\n\nJudas looked different. More angular, a sharpened sword. *Sword*…Images of my own body sliced open flashed before me, and I shut my eyes hard, willing the dizziness to stop.\n\n“You did a good job feeding our child,” he said. “Better than others. You never went for help, even when you were cutting off your own body parts…”\n\nThere was something in his voice I couldn’t identify, so I looked up and saw the adoration shining in his eyes, and realized that he was *admiring* me for it. Impressed by how I’d hacked away at myself to sate the desperate, dark compulsion in my chest.\n\nThere was something so wrong with this boy.\n\n“Who are you?” I asked.\n\nThat was when he changed fully. It was as if he had been waiting for me to ask all along, as if those three words were a charm to break him free of his prison. His human skin peeled away and fell into a torn heap at his feet, like a moth breaking out of its cocoon.\n\nUnderneath that…I don’t even know how to begin to describe it. How do I describe what infinity is, when I can’t even comprehend it myself? Thousands of eyes, mottled silver and gold scales, six pairs of angelic white wings that looked as soft as velvet. A smile that was impossibly long. Rows and rows and rows of teeth—but all of them different shapes and sizes, some razor-sharp, others flat and dull, as if he’d taken them all from different sources. As if they weren’t his to begin with.\n\n“I am everyone,” he intoned in a voice that sounded just like what Maya’s had, in my head when I was hurting myself. “I am no one. I am everything and nothing. I am the stuff of stars and of black holes. I am time itself, the endless ebb and flow of ocean waves, the darkness inside your mind, the night terrors that haunt you in sleep. I am your fear, I am your joy, I am your god.”\n\nMy whole body trembled like a leaf. I was barely able to force out the words, “What have you done with my baby?”\n\nIf possible, his—*its*—jaws widened even further, revealing a sickeningly red tongue and a throat so black and endless I shuddered. “My dear, it was never yours. Nothing is yours. All of everything is mine. *Even you*.”\n\nIt lunged at me. Its jaws closed around my body, and I jolted into consciousness. I was lying in a hospital bed. The world was dark except for the faint triangle of light filtering through the thin curtains over the window. Machines beeped next to me.\n\nWhere was my baby? Where were my parents? My belly felt empty and hollow without Maya. I started to cry.\n\nBy morning, I was losing my mind. When a nurse finally walked in the room, I wanted to weep from relief.\n\n“Where is she?” I begged her as she hurried to my side. “Where is my child?”\n\nThe nurse’s eyes softened in pity. “Oh, honey. Your son was stillborn. There were some unseen complications in the pregnancy, I’m afraid. He’d strangled himself with the umbilical cord by the time he came out. I’m so sorry.”\n\nMy befuddled brain refused to comprehend. “Unseen…complications?”\n\n“That’s right,” the nurse said sadly, taking my hand. “He was deformed—he wouldn’t have survived anyways, but it’s not your fault at all. He was missing some vital organs, honey, but your boy is in a better place.”\n\n“My *boy*? A…son?”\n\n“That’s right.” She wiped her eyes hurriedly and clasped my hand.\n\n“*Your beautiful baby boy*.”",

        "text": "I really need to get this off my chest and I need advice. I am a 17 years old girl and I cannot wrap my head around love (both family relationships and romantic relationships). I honestly have struggled with the emotions love makes me my entire life. When I was around 7 I remember my mum sitting in the bathroom with me as I sat in the bath and I said to her 'I don't think I really love you' which is crazy to me because I do love her so much, but I also don't love her at all? \n\nI recently started dating my best friend. I adore her so much. Our relationship feels so 'normal' you know, like not forced or anything and she always makes me happy and laugh. But a couple days ago we were chilling watching tv and the thought of 'you don't really love her though. if she had to go to her home town tomorrow you wouldn't even care' floods into my brain??? Because again, just like my mother, I do adore her so much, but I doubt my love.\n\nI have struggled with parents, they have shown me so much love but I would definitely say we have an interesting relationship. Both my mother and father argued a lot since I was young. Although I grew up in a loving household, I would definitely say I experienced a lot of things that a child shouldn't have. My mum screamed and shouted at my dad, who at that time was a heavy alcoholic. Occasionally there was hitting. They never got divorced though and it was just a dark time in life which has now healed. things are definitely not at all what they were like before. Although this happened we were and still are a close family and my mum, who although has anger issues and who struggles with controlling her anger (shouts at me and my dad), has always loved me so so much throughout my life and has been genuinely kind. We are close and communicate almost everything to each other.\n\nMaybe im reading too much into it but I used to be very physically loving and touchy. I will happily hold hands with new friends or tell them I love them which usually takes time for people. I could so easily love bomb people. But it meant nothing?? every sign of affection was just an act almost. \n\nI feel like sometimes I maybe don't feel love the way others do. My whole relationship with love is so confusing to me, it feels alien almost. It's like love is a complicated network of wires, but a wire is missing for me. Everything is there except one bit. I wish someone could crawl into my brain and get what im saying. I love my friends and i love my family but my love does not feel like real love. How can I have so much love for people around me in my life I appreciate yet also not feel it for them at the same time? I wish I could put my finger on it. I have aways wondered if im on the spectrum because I have always felt so different. but maybe it isn't that. I don't know. even if I will never in a million years figure this out at least I can get it off my chest. thank u :)",

        "text": "I remember that night vividly, the night the unthinkable happened. I was working at the hospital, as a nurse in the obstetrics department. It was a typical evening, busy and chaotic, with new babies arriving and anxious families awaiting their arrival. I was tending to a patient who had just undergone an abortion, a difficult and emotional procedure for anyone to go through. But little did we know that something far worse was about to happen.\n\nI was preparing to dispose of the fetus, as per standard hospital protocol, when I suddenly felt a chill run down my spine. I couldn't explain it, but something just felt off. And then, in a sudden and terrifying turn of events, the fetus began to move, jerking and twitching in my hands. I screamed, dropping it to the floor, where it continued to convulse and writhe, as if alive. And that's when I realized the horrifying truth: the fetus had come back to life.\n\nAt first, I thought it was some sort of sick joke, a twisted prank played by a fellow staff member. But as the minutes passed, more and more fetuses began to stir, coming to life in a grotesque and horrifying display. Their tiny limbs flailed and thrashed, their eyes wide and unseeing, as if possessed by some dark and malevolent force. They made no sound, but the silence was worse than any scream, a deafening and oppressive silence that hung in the air like a shroud.\n\nAs the night wore on, the situation only grew more dire. The fetuses began to crawl and slither along the floor, moving with an uncanny and unnatural grace. They clung to the walls and ceiling, their tiny fingers leaving trails of blood and grime in their wake. And worst of all, they began to attack, lashing out at anyone who crossed their path with teeth and nails, driven by an insatiable and terrifying hunger.\n\nI will never forget the look in their eyes, cold and dead and filled with an ancient and unspeakable evil. It was as if they were no longer human, no longer even alive, but something far worse, something beyond our comprehension. They were monsters, and they hungered for flesh.\n\nWe tried to contain them, to stop their rampage, but it was futile. They were too fast, too strong, too vicious. The hospital was a war zone, a bloody and horrific battlefield, as we fought for our lives against these abominations. I saw colleagues and friends torn apart before my very eyes, their screams echoing in my ears for years to come.\n\nIn the end, there was only one thing left to do. We burned the hospital to the ground, a desperate and drastic measure, but one that we knew was necessary to contain the horror that we had unleashed. The flames consumed everything, reducing the building to ash and rubble, and with it, the fetuses and their unholy hunger.\n\nBut I know that they are still out there, somewhere, waiting and watching, hungering for their next victim. And I can only hope and pray that they are never unleashed again, that they remain forever locked away in the darkest corners of our nightmares.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/116sbec/diary_of_a_demon/",
        "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm relatively new here to Reddit and the CreepyPasta community, just started writing my own stories. Here is the first one. Btw I'm German and my English is pretty good, but not perfect so forgive me for mistakes. :) \n\nEnjoy!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have done it. For 30 years I waited. For 30 years you managed to survive. 30 years... until you gave up.\n\nWell, maybe I should start over. I am a demon. Yes, we do exist and believe it or not, there are more of us alive than humans think. The only difference is that we do not exist here in our physical form but our soul can enter your bodies. You can think of it roughly as astral travel, and usually we try to break your spirit, feeding you nightmares of unspeakable torment until you are weak enough for us to take over your bodies. Why do we do this? Well the underworld is a cruel place and even for us demons it is not easy to survive there. Some see your world as a kind of vacation resort, others just want to cause chaos. But for me it was different.  \n\nWhich is also the reason why I am writing this. It's a good thing that I know one of your many languages, because writing a diary in Enochian would be incomprehensible for you. And yes I know. Enochian is the language of the angels, but we speak it too. After all, we are descended from the angels. Anyway, I am writing this to leave something for posterity. To show that not all of my race embody pure evil and ... to warn you.\n\nBut everything one after the other. As already mentioned, the whole thing was a little different with me. Immediately after my birth in the underworld, my spirit was transferred into your world, purely into the body of a small, weak infant. Why? I do not know. But it does not matter either. So i grew up in this world too, watching from the shadows. Learned together with the little boy. Walking, reading, writing, riding a bike, everything. I went to school with him, fought out his conflicts and fights with him. I was bullied with him, praised with him, loved and hated with him. We ourselves were hated, loved, cheated and deceived. Each of his birthdays, was also mine. Every gift, every toy we shared. We shared every pain, had the same friends, the same enemies, the same hobbies and the same lovers. Learned what it was to fall in love, to have sex and how it felt to be betrayed. All the time I was watching his life, which also became mine. In the end even completely. \n\nThe boy had reached his 19th year when I revealed myself to him. At that time still with the intention that it was my life and that I had to break in order to get what I wanted. Surprisingly, He took it quite calmly. He had already dealt with black magic himself and was not as surprised by my existence as I first suspected. He even tried to form a kind of bond with me. A friendly bond. Even though he had many strokes of fate behind him, he still kept his nice and friendly manner. I, however, refused. Even more: I was beside myself. In my eyes it was a defeat not to get what I wanted. Thus I left his body. I went to the underworld, to my world. I went into my body and never again wanted to set a foot in the rotting flesh of man. Thus I went into my real, demonic body. Only what I saw and learned there was anything but what I had imagined.\n\nThe underworld is a really cruel place. I will try to explain it to you as simply as possible: You can imagine the underworld as a kind of parallel to yours. Another planet where life and physics developed differently than on your planet. As far as I know, the underworld was a desolate land where hardly any life, let alone intelligent life, existed. Until the day when Lucifer, the devil himself, was cast out from the domain of the angels and landed in the underworld. Even his former followers, angels who shared his opinion, fell with him and became the first demons. From then on, the devil built his kingdom. A dictatorial regime with an immortal as its leader. However, from time to time bloody and never-ending wars raged between angels and demons. At the same time, various clans of demons also waged battles to usurp the supremacy of hell itself. For eons, war and death ruled the land until it was burned and devastated and hell itself became almost uninhabitable. But no one was able to overthrow the devil.  \n\nI just was there only for a few months, fighting every day to survive. Against wild monsters, other demons and also against a few angels. However, I managed to tear each of my enemies apart with the strength of my demonic body. I used my demonic magic and my death-bringing weapons to carve a bloody path littered with corpses, until at some point I realized why so many of my kind were trying to reach your domain. The underworld was, after all, a cruel place where no one wanted to spend his life voluntarily. Thus, purified and tired of the battles, I decided to leave my body and return to that of the boy, hoping that his offer of coexistence still existed. But when I came back, I had to realize with fright that something had changed in the life of the boy.\n\nAs many of you surely know, time is relative. And so time passes differently in the underworld than in your world. What was only a few months in hell for me, was several years in the life of the boy. By now he was a full-grown man, 7 or 28 years old, tired and broken as ... as I was. He apparently had many struggles and problems since my absence. He suffered from depression, had a low paying job, barely any food in the fridge, worried every day he wouldn't be able to pay the rent and end up on the street. He never knew which day would be his last and even though his sense of survival was strong, he tried to end it all prematurely. At that moment I wondered what this life, what your society, your government was doing to the boy, who used to be such a kind and good-hearted person that he felt love and friendship even in the face of a demon in the flesh.  \n\nWe talked for hours. He told me about the suffering which he experienced and with which worries he had to fight. From the moment I no longer felt hostility towards him, I tried to help him as much as I could. I helped him to get a better job, gradually solved his problems, built new relationships with other people and improved the already existing ones. Slowly we brought his life back on the right track. Well ... what can I say. Life is a bitch and she is expensive.  \n\nNew problems arose, mainly financial but also personal strokes of fate were the order of the day. It seemed like every time we solved a problem, two new ones came up. Like when you cut off a head of the Hydra and two new ones grew. Then we came to a decision: from time to time I took the lead so that he could retreat in spirit and take a break. I continued to live his life, solving his worries and problems, but it did not help much. And so we come to today. The day I decided to write this down. Last night, he came to me in my sleep. He decided that he could not go on like this and no matter what I advised him, he would not change his mind. He cut the connection with his body. His soul passed to the next world. I think... in the end his depression took him down. He left with his last words: \"Don't forget me\".  \n\nAnd so I sit here, alone with myself. With the promise to continue his legacy. Even though I have now achieved what I wanted so much in the beginning, I feel no satisfaction. Even demons can love other lives, even if they are human. I miss him. However, I will fulfill his last wish and not forget him until my own life ends.\n\nWhat the course of events has shown me shakes me to the core. Shouldn't life be worth living? Doesn't everyone deserve to be happy? Satisfied and carefree to enjoy his life? Sometimes I feel that your world is not so different from mine. Even though humanity as a race is not as old as mine, it is currently racing towards its ultimate end. So let me give you a warning on the way: Get your shit together! It does not matter what it is about. Whether it is your climate, the conflicts and wars of your leaders, your famines or your inflation, which destroys several people's lives. If it goes on in such a way as at present, you create a second hell. I have seen the underworld, the true evil. You do not want that. So act. Stick together and direct your existence to the right path. Please ... this is now my world, my life, too. I have a promise to keep and I will. Well...\n\nI don't know if this reaches you and if you dismiss this as truth or fiction. But if we should meet one day... remember my name. Never give up like the boy did. Even I as a demon know that there is always something worth fighting and living for. Even the worst time, even the darkest storm has an end. Don't forget that.  \n\n\nSigned: Berith.",

        "text": "So I live in a very old, haunted house. You pause the tv and once you turn your back it’s playing again, I’ve walked in on my mortar and pestle grinding randomly, a black dog with red eyes sitting in a corner, hearing footsteps, voices, weird opera music ect. \n\nMy boyfriend and his mother lived there when he was a child (he’s 20 now) and he recalls hearing his name being called yet no one’s there. Doors randomly opening, shit like that. \n\nSo anyways, we’ve lived here a year and don’t really mind the entity in the house it’s just kinda annoying. But one night I took a bunch of edibles (way too many) and go to sleep. \nAt around 4-5 in the morning I wake up hunched over in my bed as if I was leaning on something but nothing was there. I couldn’t move, something was moving my arms and head for me. I see other people in the room with me but not like physically see them, I’ve hallucinated as a child and this was nothing like that; it was as if I was looking through a lens or something. I could see them in my mind but I knew they weren’t actually in the room with me. \nA huge man has his back turned to me and is beating the shit out of someone on the ground. After he kills them he turns to me (I can still see his big beard with a red flannel on) he starts strangling me. \nI could barely breath and then somehow I get an image of my throat almost completely closed. I hear a voice in my head asking me why am I scared to die? Reminding me that death isn’t something to fear, as if I had already experienced it before. \nNext all I see if a dark cave like tunnel with vines and little cherubs, with a bright light at the very end. I had a weird vibration go down  the middle of my body from head to toe. I wanted to walk out of the tunnel into the light but something pulled me to the side and then I snapped out of it, freaking out I try to wake my boyfriend up telling him that I might be tripping off of edibles. He’s high as hell too so he tells me to go to bed. \n\nI get up and start walking to the bathroom, I could barely walk, felt like I was seizing, my whole body was convulsing and every step hurt. My eyes are red and bulging, it hurt to drink water.  \nMy neck physically hurt to touch for over a week and my whole body hurt for a few days. I still get these weird tremors and my body is shaking somehow. \n\nI told my boyfriends mother about it and she freaked because when she lived there apparently she had nightmares all the time of her being strangled by some man. \n\nEver since then I haven’t been scared of death death because I feel like I’ve already experienced it. The pain and stress suddenly turns to a abyss of sweet nothing. A good feeling tho. Sometimes I crave it. \nIdk if it was sleep paralysis or something worse. \nI asked someone who studies witchcraft and she believe that since I was in such a deep state of relaxation I somehow astral projected. I don’t know what happened but i do know i will never be the same. \nIf you’ve experienced something similar please tell me.",

        "text": "Author's note: I also posted this on r/scarystories let me know if this is bad or breaks any rules. \n\n     Ever since I started my job at a local diner I've been noticing something.... weird, to say the least. My shift starts at five and ends at one. It all started when I clocked in at five p.m. Fidgeting with the zipper on my coat I walked in surveying the booths, with a bright red cushioning and table. Walking over to behind the white and red counter and walling behind it.\n       I slid my favorite book out of my bag, ready to pass the time. I started reading, Jessica the main character was fighting her arch nemesis, Samuel when I heard foot steps approaching I looked up to see a rough looking man with rugged brown hair, holding the had of a small girl with short brown hair propped up in pigtails and blue eyes reminiscent of the sea.The small girl gave me a shy smile.\n       \"Hello, what can I do for you today?\" I asked \"Can we get a booth for two, please?\" The man asked. \"Sure!\" I replied plastering on a wide smile in the hope for tips. Grapping pre-wrapped silverware and two menus I headed over to a small booth in the corner with a window on the side to look out. Setting it down I felt a small tap on my shoulder, jutting around to see who tapped me only to realize it was only the girl she said \"Your hair is really pretty\" she said giggling nervously. Feeling flattered I responded blushing \"Thanks, this took me like, 40 minutes.\" I looked over to see the man chuckling sofly to himself. \n    I let them get settled in and walked back over to behind the counter. Since the diner owner was cheap they thought it was such a genius money-saving idea to have only one employee per shift. So, I was alone, except for the customers, or so I thought..... I came over a minute or two later and asked the pair what they wanted.\n      Unsurprisingly the small girl wanted pancakes with rainbow sprinkles while the man wanted an omelet with sausage links on the side. \"So, what brings you two to a diner at 8:43 p.m. at night?\" \"Well, me and my daughter Penny here,\" he motioned to the small girl \"are driving to my brother's house to spend his birthday together.\" \"Ah, I see, and... what's your name?\" \"Gerald, Gerald Smith\" he responded. \"Now I know wht name to put on the check when I write it up, thanks.\" I said with a smile. I cooked the food and served it to them. \"Thanks, miss!\" Penny said beaming at the pancakes. \"It's Sally.\" \"Well, Sally these pancakes are DELICIOUS.\" She said dabbing her upper lip with a napkin. They were generally nice, and they tipped well too! Before they left I heard Penny whimper to Gerald \"I have to go to the bathroommmm.\" \"Okay, go quick.\" \n        He responded. After she left Gerald strode up to me and said \"Look, how long you been working here?\" \"This is actually my first day.\" \"Well, you need to be careful here.\" He said slipping me a small bottle of pepper spray \"Please, just in case. I don't want a innocent and naive soul such as yourself get hurt by one of those horrible people out there.\" \"Uh, okay....\" I said confused by the sudden shift in his tone.\" A minute or two later Penny came out and they left. I picked up my book and was about to pick up where I last left off when I felt as if SOMEONE was watching me, when I looked up I saw nothing. \n     Remembering that the owner had asked me to check the inventory I went into the back to check what we had. A crate of lettuce, 5 bags of burger buns, a crate of tomatoes, 7 pounds of hamburger meat. Huh, I remember thinking to myself, why are there no eggs? We have so many things on the menu that include eggs! Brushing if off and writing down our need of eggs I walked back into the main area and read some more of my book. Jessica finally finds her sword and gets ready to fight Samuel when another person walks in. \n     A middle aged woman about 40 with pastel green hair, a black leather jacket, a neon green and orange t-shirt with a cartoon character on it. \"Hello, what can I do for you today?\" \"Have you seen my cat? About yae height black with white patches around her eyes.\" She asked me with a look of motherly worry on her face. \"What? This is a diner, no, unfornately I haven't seen your cat.\" She looked at me, glared, and walked out. \n    I went back to my book and heard the beep of my timer as it turned to one p.m. I got ready to walk home; suddenly overwhelmed with fear of a walk home in a very dark parking lot at night in a secluded place where no one can hear you scream. I gripped my pepper spray in my pocket, just in case. UGH THERE IT IS AGAIN THAT STUPID BEING WATCHED FEELING! I made it home and collapsed on the couch and fell asleep. \n     The next day: I clocked in and once again pulled out my book. This time I was not greeted a nice pair of people, or even a person at all, because here walks in a tall figure probably around 6'8. IT. WAS. NOT HUMAN! I felt super sleepy all the sudden.  I held in a gasp remembering a weird conversation I had with the owner. \"If anyone or anything weird happens act like it's normal and everything will be fine.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"Just trust me.\" \"Okay....\" making sure my voice didn't shake I said \"Hello, what can I do today for you today?\" It held up it's one and only finger. \"Table for one, coming right up.\" I grabbed a black menu as the owner said I should for any.... weird customers. They said I'd know when I saw one. They were right. I went into the back and texted the owner \"WHAT DID YOU GET ME INTO????\" They didn't respond. \n      I took a deep breath, and walked over to the booth. \"What would you like to eat?\" It pointed to a meal combo that said: French fingers and gutetti soup. \"O-okay I'll make it right away.\" I grab two eyepatches and set them aside and grab a big knife holding my breath and count to three. One..... two....... three! My hands shook as I brought out it's meal, it curled it's mouth tentacles and dug in ferociously. While locking up I rubbed my bandaged hands, and wondered the pattern if my eyepatches.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/116psmc/my_son_james_keeps_staring_at_our_barn_and_i_soon/",
        "text": "My son James is an amazing kid, or at least he used to be. He was always so bright and adventurous, constantly letting his own curiosity guide him. I could hardly keep up with him as he always seemed to be looking for something new and exciting to do. \n\nThen something happened that changed my son. If we're being honest, I'm not entirely sure what caused it. It all started about a year after we had moved into our previous home. My wife and I were in an odd predicament, and we had to choose a new place to live rather abruptly. \n\nThe house we decided upon happened to be an old farmhouse out in the sticks. I wasn't too keen on the idea of being so far removed from all the luxuries of city life, but my wife, on the other hand, couldn't have been happier. \n\nShe had grown up in one of these houses, and the nostalgia swayed her. Before I could even protest, the house was settled on a few acres of land and even came with its own barn. I let out a comical laugh at the sight of it. \n\nI even jokingly asked if I should buy a pair of overalls and a straw hat. She just jabbed me in the shoulder, and we continued on to the house. Around the northern edge of the property, adjacent to the barn, was a small patch of woods. The southern edge of the property overlooked sprawling hills, and beyond that was the nearby town.\n\nI wasn't sure what James would think of his new home. He seemed somewhat upset about moving away from his friends, but he was eager to find and make new ones. Life was progressing normally for our small family. My wife and I both worked on different schedules to allow us to trade off watching our son. \n\nI had the weekends off from work, so during that time, that left me in charge. Luckily, James had just turned 10 years old, so he wasn't in desperate need of constant surveillance. There wasn't a whole lot of trouble he could get himself into way out here. He was also very well-behaved, which I attribute all of that to my wife.\n\nOne weekend, after living here for around 10 months, I was busy cleaning out the house. As I was making my rounds throughout the house, I passed by James's room. I noticed his door was ajar. As I approached, I gently pushed it open. I saw James standing at his bedroom window, staring out of it. \n\nI spoke to him, asking him what he was looking at, but he didn't respond. I walked over to him, laundry basket in hand, and gently touched him on the shoulder. When I did, it was like he suddenly snapped out of a trance. He turned to look at me, and I asked him if he was all right. \n\nWith a smile, he told me he was fine, then proceeded to run out of the room, laughing and carrying on. At the time, I didn't think much of it. I thought perhaps he was just daydreaming or lost in thought. \n\nHell, I've done weirder things when I was a kid. However, as the weeks continued, James began staying in his room much more often. He was never the type of kid who enjoyed staying cooped up all day. He wanted to be running around and exploring. But during that time, I could hardly get him to come out of his room.\n\nPhysically, he seemed to fine. It was just whenever I'd opened his door, I'd find him staring out of his window towards the barn. I had confronted him numerous times about it, but every-time he'd respond with not having any idea what I was talking about.\n\nI had brought this up with my wife a few times, and she was almost as dismissive as James. She told me that I was just overthinking things and that, as long as he wasn't hurting himself, he was free to play how he wanted. If that involved staring out of the window, then that was fine with her. \n\nAfter a couple of months of this, I was sitting in the living room watching TV. I'd gotten up to use the bathroom, which was right next to James's room. On my walk back to the living room, I decided to take a peek inside to make sure he was fine. When I pushed open the door, I found the room empty. I called out his name, but there was no response. \n\nI walked over to the window and glanced out of it. I saw James outside. He was standing in the middle of the field between the house and the barn. Panic welled within me as I thought something was wrong. \n\nI sprinted through the house and out of the front door. I called out as I ran over to him. The closer I got, the more I began to notice just how still James was standing. It was like he was frozen in place. \n\nI walked up beside him and rested a hand on his shoulder. Almost instantly, he snapped out of it and turned to face me. I asked him what he was doing, and he just looked around for a few moments before telling me that he didn't know. He had no idea how he had gotten all the way out here. I told him it was fine if he played outside, but he had to let me know first. \n\nHe apologized, and we both walked back inside. Though as we were walking back to the house, I got the strange feeling that something was staring at me. I glanced back over my shoulder and looked towards the barn, but there was nobody there.\n\nNearly two and a half weeks after that, something else occurred. It was around 1:30 in the morning when I was stirred awake by a noise. In my groggy state, it was hard for me to discern the noise that had awoken me. But after a moment, my mind cleared, and I realized I should check on James. I got out of bed, and my wife tiredly asked what I was doing. I told her not to worry and just to go back to sleep. I walked down the hall and opened James's bedroom door. \n\nThe room was once again empty. I quickly moved to his window and stared out of it. Though with how dark it was outside, I couldn't see him even if he was standing out there. I pulled on my shoes and coat, retrieved a flashlight, and opened the back door. When the door latched shut behind me, I realized that had been the sound that had woken me up. I turned on the flashlight and walked briskly across the field to the barn. \n\nSince moving in, we never utilized the barn. We inspected it when we first purchased the house, but it was just your run-of-the-mill empty barn. I never even used it to store anything. We just sort of kept it as a landmark. As I walked closer to it, I spotted movement just outside of it. I aimed my flashlight as best I could, and when I did, I saw James entering the large wooden door of the barn. \n\nSeeing this, I called out his name and began sprinting towards the structure. Just before I was able to reach him, however, the large wooden door slammed shut in my face. I called out to James once more and attempted to push the door open, but the door wouldn't budge an inch, despite pushing on it as hard as I could. \n\n“the rest of the story will be in the comments👇”",

        "text": "After I killed my boyfriend, I put his body in the basement, where he vanished into the stone walls and transformed into a shadow.\n\nHe surprises me, even in death. I’ve awoken many nights to see him standing above me. \n\nHe stares at me with glassy lidless eyes, and I can tell he wants to kill me. But apparitions can’t do anything. \n\nThey bloom onto the walls like flowers and walk into light, begging to be seen. It’s never enough, but it’s all they have left.\n\nIt’s all he has ever deserved.\n\n“It’s not too bad,” I say to his silhouette. “At least you’re never alone.”\n\nI am not alone, either. Finally, he entirely belongs to me. This is our forever.\n\nKilling him was a kindness. Many would call it fate. I did what was needed to save him. I did it because of how much I love him. He knows I love him so much.\n\nThere is golden light streaming through the hallways. I dance in it.\n\nI press my fingers to the walls and caress the outline of him. I fit myself into his shape and imagine him wrapping himself around me.\n\nI rarely turn off the lights. I have gotten rid of all the curtains.\n\nI love him the most when it is night. When the moon is exceptionally bright, I click the lamps off, and I follow him around the house. I laugh at his frenetic movement, and I am awed by the shapes he turns into.\n\nHe is quite the contortionist. He sculpts himself into the most surreal forms. I marvel at his creativity. Yes, he’s dead, but his imagination persists.\n\nIt has been years since his transformation, decades.\n\nAll that’s left of him in the basement are shards of bone and wisps of hair. Time has embedded them into crevices. They bore the fruit of what he has become.\n\nI am an old woman now. I’ve witnessed many sunrises and worshipped every phase of the moon.\n\nIt’s become difficult for me to dance with him. My joints are too stiff and my eyesight has faded. Sometimes I do nothing but lie in bed and gaze up at the ceiling.\n\nHe comes without my asking. He reaches for me. His arms are as long as snakes, and they crackle and hiss like fire.\n\nHe hangs from the ceiling, sputtering into existence like static. He becomes more than just a shade.\n\nI don’t know when he started emerging from the confines of the surface, and it doesn’t matter.\n\nIt’s ending. This tangible version of me is dying, but I am not afraid.\n\nI know he can close the distance between us. He can touch me as I have had him for many years. He needs me as much as I have always needed him, and now he welcomes me to the other side.\n\nI don’t have any regrets. I am glad I killed him.\n\nI cannot wait to adorn this space with him and dance in the light.",

        "text": "I never thought I'd be telling this story since, for a long time, there seemed to be no end to this situation. However, after some recent developments with my mental well-being, I am finally able to provide the world with this information I have been keeping to myself for nearly 3 years out of fear.\n\nFor some context, my life has been hectic since I was a child. My older siblings are a set of twins, one boy and one girl, and my two younger siblings were adopted from abusive and otherwise traumatizing households. That meant that, for as long as I could remember, I was otherwise neglected by my parents since they spent half of their time with my other siblings. Jayden and Juliana, my older siblings, were always in some sort of fight which could only be solved by my parents either talking to them or making things even between them depending on the context. And then with my younger siblings, my parents spent the other half of their time making sure Kameron and Xavier felt safe, loved, and supported in our household and reassured them that no matter what, their biological parents would never regain custody of either of them. That all meant that I was responsible for my clothing, my meals, my hygiene, and all my necessities from the moment I was able to be independent. So, since I had no other option, I taught myself how to ride a bike and protect myself so that I could get to and from school or friends houses or wherever I was going.\n\nAs I got older and older, it started to feel like I was just some stranger in a families house. No photos of me on the wall, no accomplishments of mine being displayed for all to see, none of my items strewn about the house, you get my point. Hell, my bedroom was even in the attic, kind of like in Home Alone. It got so bad that my friends even pointed it out whenever they would come over. My best friend, Stephanie, commented on how my parents didn't even greet me when I get home, wish me good luck on days when I had tests, requested I stay safe whenever I went out, the gist is obvious by now. I was basically a ghost in a house I would call my own.\n\nAs a way to get their attention, I would dip my toes in rebellion and do illegal things. I started wearing shorter and shorter clothing to expose risqué parts of my body, I started smoking either joints or vapes with some stoners around my high school, and I committed petty theft and got arrested for Class C Misdemeanor on a couple occasions. And, yet, my parents only paid me any mind when they had to get me off thanks to connections they have. This got me angry. The fact that they were so far up my siblings asses that they couldn't even see the issues going with me pushed me to do something that would change my life. I did something I would regret until the day I die.\n\nAfter some, admittedly, short decision making, I packed a small bag full of my more scandalous clothing my boyfriend at the time had gotten me and, along with said boyfriend and a couple friends, I headed off on a trip to the next state over. Our idea was that us moving to a new state would allow us to make some Porn Hub videos as a way to make money and say a big 'screw you' to our parents. As teenagers, the idea was the best one we could come up with. But, I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you this because the horror movie 'X' is surrounded by this concept.\n\nSo, why am I talking about this then? Well, because, the events that followed my eventual departure from this type of work have scared me.\n\nAfter about 4 years of doing this, I was a 22 year old female with a job that was frowned upon and side-eyed whenever I mentioned it to people. I was someone who, after having sex with one-too-many people over the years, decided that they wanted to change and sharpen their life back up. So, after my birthday came and passed, I had finalized my choice of leaving my past and reshaping my life back to the smart young woman I had always wanted to become. And, after a long and tiring fight with my ex boyfriend and people I used to call my friends, I packed my shit and left our house faster than any of them expected. I was finally freed from my past. Or, I thought that, anyhow.\n\nAbout 2 years after I started fixing up my life, I was sitting in the classroom and listening to my college professor lecture us on law and the different degrees of different crimes, hence the 'Class C Misdemeanor' line from earlier. After a rather lengthy discussion on whether manslaughter or murder was worse, my professor mentioned that he sent us all a link to some study method he had conjured up via email before closing the meeting up. Mr. P, short for Mr. Professor (a fake name), noted that we had about 4 minutes left of class and told us to all go and see if we could open up the website he sent us. So, following his directions, I quickly opened up my email and started looking through the recent messages I had gotten. When I had done this, I saw an email from an unknown gmail account that just said 'Tatum Badeaux' which immediately sent chills down my back. That was what I considered my old name.\n\nWhen I ran away to do that Porn Hub job, me and the people I was with all decided to change our names legally. I hated having any sort of connection to my family since they never really acted like one, so I had decided to go from Tatum Badeaux to Tatum Quinn. That meant every legal document or document that I had written stated my last name as being Quinn since that is what I wanted it to be. But now, I was faced with someone who was either a family member reaching out or someone who knew the old me. Either way, I was hesitant to open the message since I wanted no contact with anyone from my hometown. However, I knew I couldn't just leave it alone so I eventually read what the sender had to say. The email read as follows:\n\n*\"Tatum Badeaux. That was such a pretty name you had, connecting you to your french roots that in itself was connected to historians of great power. Blanche Monnier was an ancestor of yours and yet, you jumped at the opportunity to no longer associate yourself with the people you once called Mother, Father, and brothers and sister. Why is that? Is it because the showed you no attention, no affection, no nurture? Or was it because of something horrible you had done? Was it because you did something so vile that you felt like you could no longer live in Cheshire? Who knows. Well, except someone does know. You and me.*\n\n*I was there that night, watching in the shadows as you committed a crime you never got punished or convicted for. Instead, you got to walk free because no witnesses or evidence. But, what would happen if I went to the police and tell them that I, someone you have no personal connection to, saw what truly went down that night? The statute of limitations aren't going to end for another, well, lifetime. Nevertheless, I will give you some time to think about whether you will come to your morals in turn yourself in, or if you will leave it to me to come clean. Make your choice, Tatum.\"*\n\nAfter reading the email, I was paralyzed in my seat. All I could ask myself was what exactly this person was talking about. What crime did I commit by myself that I got away with that someone knew about? The answer? None because all the crimes I had committed were done in broad daylight and each of my crimes had been done with friends. That's when I was hit with a realization: this person must have the wrong person, despite the coincidence of someone also being named Tatum Badeaux who lived in Cheshire being too close to be real. Regardless, I sent the person a quick email explaining that they may have the wrong person.\n\nIf only I realized how bad this whole emailing situation would become, I would've deleted the email and would play no mind if I got another. When I had replied to their email that day, that sent off a chain reaction where every week at the exact same time on the same day of the week, I would get emails from the unrecognizable gmail account slowly revealing details about the crime I supposedly committed or just taunted me up and down for their own enjoyment. This whole thing lasted about 6 months before the emails just stopped. Like randomly one day, I had checked my inbox at the time the messages usually came in and there was nothing. No new details, no burgeoning information, just nothing.\n\nFor the next week, I would constantly check my email and every day, it would never be full of the messages I had gotten used to getting. To fill up that space, I would read through one of the old emails again and write down one details everyday. This is how the list looked by the time I was done:\n\n**1)** The crime happened at night, **2)** It was a crime without a statute of limitations, **3)** It was a murder, **4)** The perpetrator was with a companion that night, **5)** The murder weapon used was a hatchet that had been stolen from the local fire department, **6)** the hatchet was never found after-the-fact, **7)** The teen who died that night was a local girl named Sophia who was widely hated by other teenagers in town, **8)** The unknown sender was the only witness to the murder, **9)** Sophia's body was moved from the scene and hasn't been seen since, and **10)** 'My' family were still blissfully unaware of my absence.\n\nI didn't need some anonymous person telling me to understand that no one I once loved gave a flying duck about me no longer living with them.\n\nIn spite of that tidbit and my own personal opinions on my family, I decided to check on their Facebook accounts just to see if the messenger was telling the truth. What if they were advocating for me to come home safe? What if they were having discussions about me in hopes I would see it and have a change in heart? In the moment I felt stupid asking these questions to myself and getting that excited feeling, but I still searched their profiles up.\n\nMy moms was the first one to catch my attention, so that was the first one I clicked on. I quickly took notice to the newest post of hers, celebrating different accomplishments from her children. I read through her caption, I read through the list swiftly. My older siblings were both 27, one married and pregnant with their first child and one engaged, and my younger siblings who were 18 and 17 respectively with them both either graduating high school or being elected student council president. I admit, I had a good smile when reading through the various different triumphs until I reached the bottom. There it read, \"*And Tatum, my beautiful angle who has opened our eyes over the years and taught us how to be better parental figures.\"*\n\nWhat was she talking about? I hadn't rolled back into Cheshire since I left, let alone had any contact with my family. No messages, no letters, no phone calls, no form of contact in any capacity. And I hadn't noticed it before, but when I scrolled back up to the picture I noticed something. There in the middle of all my siblings, was someone who looked identical to me. The same long, straight brunette hair with highlights, the same piercing blue eyes I had, the same piercings I had gotten over the years, the same tattoo on the right arm, everything. Whoever was in this photo was me somehow.\n\nI didn't even have to try and rationalize this situation because there was no explanation. Someone out there took my identity, my looks, my tattoo, by story. Someone out there knew my body adjustments to a 'T' and got them on their body to add some consistency. That way if I ever went to Cheshire, my parents wouldn't know there was a difference between me and the unknown doppelganger.\n\nMy first thought was that whoever sent me the emails was the one who became me. That would explain their aggression towards the idea of me changing my last name despite who it is connected to and why they wanted to pin a crime they committed on me. The reason they were the only witness is because they were the one to murder that girl, if they even murdered her at all.\n\nThen I had a rather eerie thought, what if that girl that was supposedly murdered, Sophia, was the face behind the interpreter and the person who had sent me all those messages. Sure, the prospect was crazy, but just stay with me for a second. I had gone to the police's website for my hometown and had looked up Sophia \\[last name\\] with nothing coming up. No missing report or murder report. I had searched the internet for any articles for the girl with, again, no results. And the number the emailer had given to me in case my email wasn't working one day was a 631 number which came from a town close to Cheshire.\n\nEither way, I knew I needed to go back home and check everything out for myself. Unfortunately, I won't be able to fit it all in this post since Reddit has a character limit. However, I promise to update everyone with the end of this story soon. Thank you to anyone who has read it all and will stick around for the rest of the story.",

        "text": "Narrated by: [A Voice in the Abyss](https://youtu.be/BDBrO-WWNQo)\n\nThis is a confession.\n\nI am no longer here.\n\nI  would ask of the father to forgive me, but to be looked upon as a  religious hypocrite would be detrimental to both the truly pious and me.  I do not ask for forgiveness but understanding. To whomever this  portion of my journal reaches, I hope that my inclinations do not  disturb your already structured morality. My intentions are to  introduce, not invade. It is not my desire to leave a lasting legacy  within your mental state, my legacy lives beyond the individual and is  now accepted as an ideology.\n\nI  have made the human life a trivial thing. The fragility of a person, I  have learned. I am a zealous believer of the insignificance of the human  conscience. From trial and error, I have learned that humans exposed to  the crude end of their final hours become animals. Unable to carry a  cognizant thought and losing all dignity of a supposedly intelligent  life form. Ethics and morals I have thrown out. I do not think this was  an active decision I bookmarked in my timeline. I would assume it was a  subconscious decision made for me in my childhood or perhaps my genetic  code.\n\nI am not escaping from  judgement. Nor do I beg for pardon. I am in my shoes by desire and  choice. I chose to stay in the state that I am. What was not available  for me and my interest, I procured it vigorously. The subjects I needed  were meticulously pursued and gathered.\n\nThe  initial struggle is what makes my art so arduous. A little bit of  anesthetics and white lies make the job less of a struggle. I rely on  both heavily.\n\nIt amuses me how  every single subject holds onto the single thread of hope so  desperately. The white lies I tell become a beacon of hope, when in  reality we are together in the abyss shrouded by black so black that it  seems palpable. They are a guest and visitor to my darkness, for it has  been my abode from the beginning of my existence.\n\nWhen  it is time for me to gather my sculpting clay, I routinely visit the  socially disadvantaged and vulnerable. The outcasts of society are  easier to forget. The acquiescence of their disappearance is what  allowed for me to continue my art form for many years. With this I have  an excuse to relay the blame aimed towards me to the cruel reality of  society. Partially, the blame is also on you, you who is reading this  journal. You can deny it all you want, but we both know where we stand  in this cold hierarchical world.\n\nNow  I will enlighten you about how I carry my procedure. Drainage of the  blood is key to achieving the luscious color of the blueish hue. The  process may take up to 48 hours, depending on the size of the canvas  being used. Early in my journey of sculpting, I used three strand sisal  ropes to hang the blank canvases but soon realized that a blotch of  blood and a heavier subject quickened the deterioration process of the  rope fiber. Metal chains were a pain to clean up after; I also realized  that the usage of non-disposable materials may hinder the coverage of  trails if I were to be investigated. After sampling different types of  ropes, I found that the double stranded nylon rope was perfect for  carrying out my procedure. The strength and elasticity are clear  strengths of the rope but the main usage comes from its resistance to  chemical exposure. I shall refrain from disclosing any more of my  tendencies for I believe true art should not be emulated but imagined  and individualized.\n\nDo I feel  empathy for my subjects? That is like asking Shakespeare if he feels for  the ink that is smeared for his writing. Does Beethoven rue over the  intensity he has used over the black and white ivory? Subjects born with  an innate dullness are embellished through my craft and become an art  reborn for this grey world. It is a blessing I am willing to share  without recompense.\n\nI will  continue in my expression. The human anatomy is a beautiful thing in and  of itself. The symmetry and balance of the physique conveys nature’s  universal pursuit of beauty. All I do is add to the intrinsic elegance  and hope to satiate the world of its hunger for harmony. Sculpting has  opened a new world of obsession for me. As it will be the case for  everyone else who set eyes on my work.\n\nYou  will find my work displayed in a warehouse located around Susana Road  313. Some canvases have been sold overseas for cadaver exhibitions; the  most famous one being the ‘Real Bodies’ exhibition carried out by China.  Some have been shipped around the world to many well renowned medical  schools and hospitals as samples or for cadaver dissection trainings.  Once again, I relay the blame aimed towards me to another section of  society.\n\nWhen the remainder of the  bodies are found, you have my permission to do whatever with them.  Assuming you have contacted authorities, I sincerely hope that this  revelation does not discourage or corrode your mental fortitude.\n\nBut  by in the off chance you, who is reading this, is someone like me who  can appreciate true beauty… my legacy is left to you to carry on. If you  are willing to continue my work, I have written a second journal only  for the eyes of the likes of us. Written in the journal are detailed  anatomical procedures and cautions when dealing with tools and  chemicals. If you are lacking in knowledge and the skills, I recommend  locating my second journal and dissect it thoroughly.\n\nI  have benefited from the facade of society. The art that I have created  has left a mark in this world and I am satisfied. It is up to you,  reader, to continue or to sabotage. What is done already cannot be  retrieved but hemorrhages can be treated.\n\nI wish you luck in all your endeavors.",

        "text": "  \n\nTo be honest, I’m not sure if writing this is a good idea. \n\nIt’s been close to four months since everything happened, and at times, it still feels like a bad dream, one I need to shake off and forget. But I know that if I don’t at least try to tell the truth now, I’ll regret it for the rest of my life, however short it may be. I can’t fit the full account into one cohesive segment, thanks to the word limits of this site, so I’ll just have to try and get it all out there one day at a time. I doubt anyone will believe me, but I’m used to that by now.\n\nIt all started last October, when I still worked as a tour guide for the New Wilderness Wildlife Reserve. I’d stayed late to help clean up in the kitchens, after volunteering to work concessions in place of a girl who came down with the flu. With the last of the guests gone for the night, I stood at the big industrial-grade sink and wiped the last of the dishes dry, before lugging the stack of clean plates, bowls, and cups toward their rightful places on the stainless-steel shelves. Both of my feet hurt from standing on them all day, and a small knot had formed in the small of my back, but still, I smiled.\n\n*Never thought I’d be happy to scrub salad bowls.*\n\nMy second year at New Wilderness had been amazing, and I couldn’t wait to come back next season. Everything about the little park was perfect, from the adorable animals, friendly coworkers, and surprisingly healthy food to the picturesque rural Ohio landscape. Since my first interview in the year prior, I’d done some tours on the regular safari buses, as well as odd jobs around the facility, without discovering a single thing that made me want to quit. Even kitchen duty at the hilltop café turned out to be way more fun than I’d expected. I’d learned to bake bread from scratch, and Casandra, my 40-year-old supervisor who knew every knife, pot, and pan like the back of her hand, praised my culinary talent to the skies.\n\n“See you later Maddie.” Casandra shouted over the stove exhaust fans with her usual happy-go-lucky cheer as I walked out the door to the door to the parking lot. “Good job today. You were a big help.”\n\n“Thanks. Have a good night, Casandra.” I chirped back and let myself give out a contented sigh.\n\n*I love my job.*\n\nIn the darkened parking lot, a cool breeze brushed past my face. It promised to be a beautiful fall night, the wind blowing in from the west, the stars twinkling into view as the last of the sunlight faded, and a crescent moon beamed down from above. Few cars were left atop the ridge where the visitor center stood. My own little blue sedan, its paint chipped and peeling, waited for me, and I silently hoped it would start. Dad had been having issues with its starter, but it hadn’t acted up in a few days.\n\n*Here’s to hoping that record holds.*\n\nI unlocked my car door to climb in and caught sight of a familiar black SUV pulling up the hill, the words *Park Ranger* stickered to the side.\n\nMy pulse jumped, the smile on my face melted into a grimace, and a twinge of nervousness knifed through my chest. It could be Randy, I told myself, or Danial, or Phillis, any of the other night guards. It didn’t have to be *him* just because I was here.\n\nThe SUV rolled through the parking lot, and the driver spotted me, his casual grin unmistakable.\n\n*Oh no.*\n\nHot embarrassment flooded through my cheeks at the lanky silhouette who put the SUV in park and climbed out to saunter over to me. The night had been going so well, and it didn’t have to end like this. After all, he wasn’t within voice range yet. If I wanted to, I could pretend not to see him, jump into my car, hide my face, and floor it for home. He wouldn’t know for sure that I didn’t have somewhere important to be, and I could avoid the awkward conversation, maybe even put it off for another five-month winter-season.\n\nYet despite my brain begging me to leave, I stayed, and put on what I hoped to be a friendly smile to hide my anxiety.\n\nFrom four feet away, Mark hooked his thumbs into his jacket pockets, and rested one hip against my car’s front fender. “Hey stranger. Long time no see. How’ve you been?”\n\nMark Petric and I had met during my first year at the reserve’s Carnivore Cove in between breaks on our tour bus routes. He was nice, smart yet easy to talk to, and he never seemed uninterested in anything I had to say. As it turned out, it was his first year too, and like me, he had already fallen in love with New Wilderness. Despite being surrounded by strangers, Mark went out of his way to include people into the conversation who wouldn’t have stood a chance on their own, told self-deprecating jokes to draw fire away from anyone who felt singled out, and in general played the part of a peacekeeper between difficult personalities when tensions flared. He always acted with unfailing kindness toward me, and I considered him to be a good friend. We exchanged contact information, and I enjoyed having someone to chat with in between sessions of Skyrim in my after-work hours.\n\nThen, three months later Mark texted me, and asked me to dinner. To be honest, I’d seen it coming, could tell by how often he’d messaged me, how happy he was whenever I responded. A few other guys at previous jobs had also shown interest in me, and while Mark was *definitely* better mannered than them, it was still obvious. I knew it was a scenario that other girls at New Wilderness would have welcomed with glee, but for me, a knot formed in my gut the moment I saw his dinner invitation pop up on my phone.\n\nI had sat on my bed, put my head in my hands, and fought waves of nausea, because in that moment, I knew that I didn’t have feelings for him, not the slightest romantic spark. Mark was my friend, one I really enjoyed spending time with, and I didn’t want to lose our friendship. But I couldn’t leave that text unanswered forever.\n\nSo, I did what I knew was right. I let him down as easy as I possibly could.\n\nMark took it really well, said he still wanted to stay friends, and we even talked some more after, though eventually the conversations died out due to my lack of enthusiastic replies. Though relieved to have it over with, I felt awful for weeks afterward, knowing that my rejection had hurt him deeply. He was a great guy, but I just couldn’t bear the thought of going out with Mark, only to have to dump him later when I still didn’t feel any different, and see that pain etch itself over his face.\n\nPerhaps that’s why, when Mark announced his engagement to another girl at the beginning of this year, a little of the guilt lifted from my shoulders. He’d been a bundle of giddy smiles when I’d overheard him talking to one of the other tour guides about his fiancé, and I wanted to be happy for him.\n\nI *wanted* to, anyway.\n\n“I’m fine.” I bobbed my head like a doll on an old truck dashboard, wishing I could dig the shame from my chest like an unwanted parasite, and stomp it on the ground. “You?”\n\nMark’s cocoa brown eyes seemed to see right through my nervous façade, and he made an apologetic half-smile. “I’m good. You in a hurry? I don’t want to keep you.”\n\nThose last few words stung more than I expected them to, and I almost winced. Part of the reason I couldn’t be relieved, happy, or calm around Mark Petric was because even though I still thought of him as nothing more than a friend, deep inside my selfish heart, I’d felt sick the moment he said the word ‘engaged’. One of my big goals was to find the love of my life, settle down with him, and have lots of kids in a nice cottage in the countryside. I’d confessed as much during our early conversations, before Mark revealed his feelings for me. While him moving on was a big relief, something inside me panicked at the thought that I may have thrown away my one chance to find the happiness I’d been dreaming of. That selfish despair left me plagued with shame every time I thought of him, because I still saw Mark as a friend, yet felt a hollow sadness at him finding someone else.\n\n*No Mark, you definitely don’t want to keep me.*\n\n“Maddie?” His soft voice broke me from my ashen thoughts.\n\nI looked up to find Mark staring with sympathetic eyes.\n\n“Look, I just wanted to say hi. Did I make this weird?”\n\nWishing I had an invisibility cloak, I shook my head, conscious of how my frizzy auburn ponytail swished against my neck. “I’m just tired. I was in the kitchens all day today. My feet feel like they’re on fire.”\n\nHis warm grin returned, and Mark threw me a wink. “Making more of those amazing cupcakes?”\n\nOf course he remembered my strawberry upside-down cupcakes. I’d made them for one company picnic, and Mark complimented me to no end for it. Everyone had liked them, but looking back, it left a bittersweet taste in my mouth at the way Mark had tried my cupcakes first out of all the other delicious desserts there.\n\n“Homemade bread.” I leaned against my card door, grateful for its support to hide my shaking hands. “The cupcakes are for special occasions.”\n\nSilence reigned between us, broken only the groaning wind that creaked through the distant trees. It seemed as though even the weather could see into my guilty heart and growled at me in judgment. I couldn’t raise my eyes to Mark’s, a sudden jolt of embarrassing memory coursing through me at the thing’s he’d said last year, and how they hurt to think about now.\n\n*You’re really talented.*\n\n*You’re coming back next year, right?*\n\n*You’re one in a million, Madison Cromwell.*\n\n“Cool.” Mark shuffled his feet and rubbed the back of his neck. “Well . . . it was good to see you. Drive safe, Maddie.”\n\nI couldn’t hide my flinch this time, and realized I’d effectively shut down the conversation by not talking more. “You don’t have to . . . I mean . . .”\n\n“No, it’s fine, I have to lock up the sign-in office anyway.” He held up his hands in friendly disengagement, but I could sense the wounds behind Mark’s expression. I’d rejected him, he’d gotten over me, and now I was ghosting him in person like some toxic social media troll.\n\n*I should have just driven away.*\n\nMy mouth opened, though I had no idea what I was going to say, since my self-hating musings blocked any constructive sentences.\n\n*Boom.*\n\nMark and I both almost jumped out of our skins, and I glanced up to see the sky above roil with pitch black clouds, flickers of lightning snaking in between. The weather hadn’t called for rain, much less what looked to be a thunderstorm of seismic proportions. Inky black clouds smothered the stars, a colder, harsher breeze caught the wind, and I shivered under my green ripstop jacket. It was as if some gargantuan black beast had sprung out of nowhere and devoured the beautiful night from before.\n\n“Whoa.” I blurted at a few icy raindrops that began to plink down around me. “Where did that come from?”\n\nMark didn’t speak, and I swiveled my head to repeat my question.\n\nThe question faded from my mind, and instead, I felt my skin crawl.\n\nHis dark eyes were fixed on the sky, and I saw something in Mark’s gaze that I’d never seen before; deep, abysmal fear.\n\n“Mark?” I rasped out, wondering if I should call my dad and ask him to come get me with his big four-wheel drive truck.\n\nMark’s jaw worked, and his adam’s apple floated up and down with each nervous swallow. “Which way do you usually go home?”\n\nAcidic worry wriggled through my veins, and I pointed in the same direction as where the storm originated. “I take High Road onto Bethesda Ridge, and straight from there to 142.”\n\n“Don’t tonight.” His tone turned cold and sharp, like a man who stood face to face with something he either hated or feared. “Go back to Collingswood and take 85 to the interstate. It’s not safe any other way.”\n\nMark had served six years in the army before coming to New Wilderness, and to see him this rigid, coiled like a spring, made me temporarily forget about my internal pity-party over our unfortunate past.\n\n“Okay, I’ll go that way.”\n\nHe caught my eye and placed a white-knuckled hand on the open driver’s door. “Do not take shortcuts, do not try to go the old route. You do *not* stop, not for anything, or anyone. If worst comes to worst, you backtrack here, and lock yourself inside the Administration Building.”\n\n*He acts like there’s a tornado coming.*\n\n“Okay.” I squeaked, unable to muster much else. Mark’s sternness frightened me.\n\n“I mean it, Maddie. I don’t care who they are, what they do, do *not* stop, not for a soul. Period.”\n\nA long bolt of silvery lightning streaked through the air, and the resounding *boom* that echoed off it shook the ground beneath my feet. I’d grown up in town a half hour north of the park, and had never seen a storm like this, even in tornado season. Something about how fast the clouds gobbled up the sky, the way the lightning shrieked with venomous glee, gave the storm an almost sentient quality, like it waited for us to venture out onto the long gravel roads that surrounded the isolated reserve so it could pounce.\n\n“What’s going on?” I finally managed to meet his eyes, raw fear overpowering my façade. “Mark, is everything okay?”\n\nHe walked around the open car door and placed both hands on my shoulders in a gentle touch that sent pangs of guilt rippling deep into my chest.\n\nMark tried to smile, but another lightning strike lit up his thin face, and I saw the lines there, the desperation, like a man with no cards left in a losing poker game. “Go home, Maddie. As fast as you can. And if you see a road sign for a Tauerpin Road, spelled T-A-U-E-R-P-I-N, do *not* take it. Do you understand me?”\n\n*Not really.*\n\nMy mind whirled with a thousand confused questions, but the way Mark held me by my shoulders, gave me a small squeeze as though we were saying goodbye forever made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. What was going on? I had never seen him get this way about a storm, and not once in the dozens of times I’d driven around New Wilderness had I ever seen a sign for Tauerpin Road. I wanted to believe Mark was messing with me, perhaps getting a form of warped revenge for my rejection, but the storm swamped the night sky above us, and turned the pleasant mid fall evening into a dark, rainy hellscape.\n\nI slid into my driver’s seat and exhaled in thanks the moment my car’s decrepit engine roared to life.\n\nMark leaned through the open car window to be face level with me one last time. “Remember, do not take Tauerpin Road. Not for any reason. Turn around and come back if you have to.”\n\nGripping my cracked steering wheel, I forced myself to hold his gaze, even though it made my jumbled emotions do somersaults in my head. “You’re going to be okay, right?”\n\nThrough the murky darkness, that same bright smile split the night, though a morose gleam overshadowed Mark’s usually cheerful eyes. “I’ll be fine. Text me when you get home, okay? Just so I know you’re not stuck out there.”\n\nWith that, he jogged away to his SUV, casting furtive glances at the storm overhead, as the rain started to pour down around him. Part of me wanted to run after Mark, to hop into the passenger’s seat next to him and refuse to leave until he told me what was happening, but I knew I couldn’t do that. Dad and Mom were waiting on me, the storm was getting worse by the second, and I didn’t want to make Mark worry. Nor did I want to give him any wrong ideas about my feelings toward him.\n\n*Especially not now. He’s finally happy, everything is back to normal, sort of. He’s got some lucky girl, and I have my friend back. That’s all that matters.*\n\nThe road home became a long ebony ribbon of shallow potholes, which my little car rattled over one-by-one with a malcontent rumble. Wind roared outside my rain-streaked windows, and I could feel the power of the storm pushing my car with each heavy gust. Rivulets of water turned the windshield into an optical illusion, my vision ahead smeared and hazy, the ragged wiper blades running at full speed. All the ditches brimmed with muddy runoff water, streams flowed over the gravel roadway, and more water surged down from the surrounding banks. Thunder crackled like a warzone right over my head, and even though I sat in my nice, dry car, I still hunched over every time a boom went off in reflex, like a wild animal. Lightning bolts lit up the night sky in flash-bulb eruptions, making everything seem to move in slow motion.\n\n*Whump*.\n\nI screamed and yanked hard on the steering wheel.\n\nAll four tires skipped over the wet gravel in an uncontrolled slide, and the vehicle careened toward the nearest ditch.\n\nMy heart stopped in my chest, I mashed the brake pedal to the floor, and the hunk of rouge metal ground to a stop, mere inches from flying off the road.\n\n“Holy cow.” I breathed, my arms and legs shaking, too stunned to be angry, or afraid.\n\nA huge telephone pole lay across the road, completely blocking it, and another lay further down the tarmac in the same fashion, both fried black by the powerful lightning. Their long gray cables snaked over the wet pavement in between them, a deadly labyrinth of runaway voltage that would zap me if I tried to walk across, not that I would even think of being that stupid.\n\nSlumping back in the seat, I closed my eyes, and focused on slowing my heartrate. I’d come a few microseconds from smashing headfirst into the pole, and if I had, there would be no way of getting myself out of such a mess.\n\n“I need to turn around.” I tried to talk myself into a calmer state as the rain hammered on my tiny blue sedan, my adrenaline at all-time highs. “Can’t go that way. Maybe I can find a side road and . . .”\n\nA sliver of jade green caught my eye, and the thought left my mind.\n\nOn the other side of the road a lone, dented road sign stood in the weeds and briars, its white borders rusted, the green of the sign faded to near illegibility. But even from where I sat, there was no mistaking the words that glared back at me in the yellowish beam of my headlights.\n\n*Tauerpin Road.*\n\nAn ice-cold shiver ran down my spine, goosebumps scattered over my arms beneath my jacket, and I gulped back a gasp. I hadn’t deviated from the route Mark had told me to take. I had followed his instructions to the letter, and I’d taken this way a few times before, always in the daytime.\n\nNever, not once, had I seen this sign.\n\nBeyond the glow of my headlights, I could discern a narrow gravel road that stretched far off into the darkness between the trees, peppered with rain so that it almost appeared jet black in the night. Unlike most of the roads in this area, this one seemed to be arrow straight, like a deep gullet of shadows that threatened to swallow me whole.\n\n*Nope.*\n\nI shook myself out of my stupor and reached for the gear shift knob. I’d never thought of myself as the prettiest, fastest, or even smartest girl in town, but I knew enough to stay away from sketchy areas, and this one beat them all. Blocked road or not, with the way Mark talked about it, there was no way I was taking my car down there. I’d head back, park in front of the Administration Building and wait for the storm to blow over. Even if I had to be stranded at New Wilderness for the night, I figured it would be way safer than driving on roads with trees and telephone poles blown down all over the place.\n\n*Clank*.\n\nMy bumper hit something, and the back of my head smacked off my headrest.\n\nI blinked at myself in my rearview mirror with confusion. What had I hit? Nothing sat in the road behind me, no other vehicles, nothing but wet roadway and . . .\n\n“Seriously?”\n\nMy eyes stared into my mirror with disbelief. A third telephone pole draped across the road, cutting me off from my one and only escape route. It was impossible, simply impossible that lightning had struck all three in a perfect row, but there it was. I couldn’t drive around it, the ground outside of the gravel road had turned to muck, and the ditches were practically medieval moats. Moving the hefty poles by myself was out of the question, and my little car didn’t have the guts to drag or push them out of the way. I couldn’t walk, not in this storm, with the wind bringing the temperature down to a nasty 40 degrees at minimum. Besides, my town lay another thirty miles to the north, and the road ahead was covered in downed electrical wires. Even if I tip-toed around them, I’d be stumbling along the dark road, by myself, wearing thin khaki work pants and a lightweight jacket that would never turn the rain. Flagging down a car would require one coming by, and with how bad this storm was, I didn’t figure that would happen any time soon.\n\nI pulled my phone out and tapped the screen. My heart sank at the empty triangle in the upper right-hand corner, a little x through the bottom of it.\n\n*No service. Of course, I’ve got no service. Dad’s gonna freak.*\n\nSwallowing the dryness that attempted to choke me, I put the car into park, and sighed. I’d just have to wait here until the storm passed. At least I had protection from the elements, and a barrier between myself and the menacing night. I could sleep till morning, run my heater, and play some music to keep boredom away. Maybe if Mark got concerned, he’d track me down, and give me a ride back to New Wilderness. Come to think of it, Dad would eventually come out to search for me too, and between the two of them, there was no way they could miss me. All I had to do was sit tight, and I’d be out of this jam by sunup.\n\nSatisfied with my plan, I clicked my seat back into a slight recline and started to scroll through the pictures on my phone, reliving all the fond memories I’d made this year. One by one, they glided past my gaze to reflect on the glass window beside me, a ticker-tape parade of sunshine and fun.\n\nMe petting a giraffe in the giraffe barn. Me, my best friend Kendra Smith, and a few other girls washing windows at the rental cabins. Me and several others at the company picnic, where our goofy team had taken third place in a karaoke competition.\n\n*Right after they gave us our trophy, Mark complimented my singing, and Kendra said I should date him, literally within earshot of the poor guy.*\n\nCringing at how the memory stabbed at my guilt-ridden heart, I reached to turn on the radio as a distraction from the uncomfortable reality of my choices.\n\nSomething moved in the corner of my eye.\n\nI sat bolt upright and snapped my head around to the left.\n\nNot far away on the other side of the road, stood Kendra. \n\nHer khaki pants and short brown braid were dripping, her lips tinged a shade of light blue from the horrid wind. Kendra’s drenched black uniform shirt stuck to her slender frame, moving in jerky rhythm with each breath, and she hugged her arms around herself in a desperate attempt to ward off the cold.\n\nI stared, confused. How was she here? I hadn’t seen any other cars pull up, no lights or horns. In fact, I couldn’t see Kendra’s green Kia anywhere. Had she foolishly decided to walk for help instead of staying in her own car?\n\n*She must have left around the same time and got stranded too.*\n\nSeeing me staring, Kendra made a sheepish smile.\n\n“Kendra.” I waved at her from behind the glass of my driver’s door. “Kendra, hop in. Come on, it’s warmer in here.”\n\nThe rain pounded on the car roof harder, and Kendra hunched against the watery onslaught, as though each drop was an ice pick to her exposed skin. She pointed to her ear and mouthed a reply.\n\n*Can’t hear you.*\n\nIt occurred to me that, with the dull roar of the rain, there was no way she could hear me from inside my locked car, all the way across the road.\n\nInstead, I beckoned her closer, made blatant motions and half-shouted with exaggerated movements. “Come here. Kendra, come here.”\n\nKendra just shook harder with a fresh gust of cold and waved for me to come to her, like she had some intimate secret she didn’t want to shout in front of the lonely, dark trees.\n\n*You’ve got to be kidding me. Whatever it is, you can tell me in the car. Ugh, I better not get pneumonia for some stupid gossip, Kendra.*\n\nFrustrated, but still concerned, I slid my hand toward my door handle.\n\nLightning peeled through the sky, and in the dark trees behind Kendra, I glimpsed movement.\n\nSeconds slowed to what felt like hours, and I blinked up at the thing that hid in the forest in mute panic. It was tall, easily the same height as the surrounding pines, with a thin body that resembled a gnarled tree trunk without leaves or branches. In the spasmodic light of the storm, I couldn’t see its face, just a rounded, bulbous head wreathed in shadow, and spindly arms that hung to where it’s knees would have risen to.\n\nMy mouth fell open in shock, and I pointed a trembling finger, unable to so much as shout a warning.\n\nKendra turned, just in time for a huge gray hand with four fingers to shoot out of the tree line and snatch her up like a ragdoll.\n\nHer head whipped around, Kendra’s mouth fell open in a terrified scream, one that I heard even inside my car.\n\n*Oh no . . .*\n\nKendra’s shriek cut off the second the massive gray arm jerked back into the trees, and another deep rumble of thunder echoed through the night, almost reminding me of throaty laughter.\n\n“Kendra!”\n\nMy clumsy fingers fumbled with the door handle, my heart racing a million miles a minute. Without a second thought about the cold, I lunged out the open door and snagged my foot on the loose seatbelt to fall face-first in the wet gravel. Pain stung in my right palm, but I pushed myself up and dashed toward the road junction, past the battered sign for Tauerpin Road.\n\nWind slashed at my face, pulled my hair from its ponytail, and cold rain drained down the back of my jacket with sadistic glee. Muddy gravel squelched under my tennis shoes, and shadows closed in around me as I outran the golden beams of my car’s headlights. Both lungs burned with the moisture-filled air, and I squinted against the inky darkness.\n\n*Wham.*\n\nI flew headlong into the rough stones of the road, my shins flaring with pain. Little sharp bits of rock stuck into my bare hands, and I gritted my teeth to choke back a string of expletives. “Oww, son of a . . .”\n\nSitting up, I picked at my hands to dislodge the pesky rocks and ran careful fingers over my legs. They were sore, but I hadn’t fallen hard enough to break or sprain anything. I decided that I must have tripped over a fallen tree branch in the dark, my own hands barely visible before my dirt-smeared face.\n\nBlind as a bat in the dark, I groped for my phone.\n\n*Oh Madison, you idiot.*\n\nI remembered too late that my phone sat in my car’s center console, still on the picture of me and my teammates at the company picnic. Ten clammy fingers searched the pockets of my thin jacket frantically, but all I could find was the crinkled wrapper of a candy bar I’d eaten earlier today.\n\nMy panic began to mount even more, until my thumb bumped something smooth, and cool to the touch.\n\n“Mee-maw, you’re the best.” I chuckled, and pulled out the little red penlight my grandma had gotten me for a Christmas stocking stuffer.\n\nIt clicked on with a comforting bright blue glow, though the thin beam didn’t let me see very far around me. Looking back the way I’d come, I spotted a downed tree branch, and rubbed my shins again in spite. Man, that had hurt.\n\nLightning illuminated the road for a split second, and it occurred to me that I couldn’t see my car from where I sat. In fact, I couldn’t even make out the aura of my car’s headlights. It was as if they’d fallen off the face of the earth.\n\n*How far did I run? I’m still on the road, and it was, like, thirty seconds. I left it running . . . maybe the battery died?*\n\nBut that didn’t make any sense. My dad taught me enough about cars to know that if the engine was running, it should be charging the battery with the alternator. Besides, my car’s battery was only a year old, I remembered paying for a new one last year. So where did the lights go?\n\nAn uneasy sensation rippled through my stomach, and I rubbed at my arms for heat. All around, the trees swayed in the high wind, lighting slithered across the sky, followed by waves of cannon-like thunder. My toes were going numb in my soggy sneakers, and I swallowed a bitter lump of regret. Whatever grabbed Kendra could be anywhere, and outside of my little car, in the pounding rain, I felt as exposed as if I had come to work naked.\n\nMy mind flashed back to the little revolver my father had bought for me a month ago, one he’d insisted I carry everywhere, only for me to roll my eyes and leave it in my nightstand drawer. Dad had always been protective, particularly since I was the eldest daughter, and I’d chafed at how he’d made me text him every time I came and went from work. Sitting on the wet ground, my shins throbbing, with nothing but my tiny penlight to ward off the darkness, I cursed myself for all the times I’d shrugged him off as being too paranoid.\n\n*Dad, I wish you were here.*\n\n*Crunch, crunch, crunch.*\n\nI spun around at the sound of shoes on loose stones, and the beam of my flashlight landed on a familiar khaki-wearing figure.\n\nShocked, I stood up. “Kendra?”\n\nShe stopped several yards away, far enough that the weak beam of my penlight couldn’t fully reveal her features. Something in the pit of my guts churned, like I’d eaten spoiled food, and I took a cautious step forward.\n\n“Kendra? Jeez, you okay? I saw that thing grab you, what was . . .”\n\nMy limbs froze, and the words died in my throat at a sudden realization.\n\nEvery morning, I checked the work roster to see where I’d be working, and who I’d be working with. Mainly I wanted to know ahead of time if I was working with any newcomers, so I could know their names, but ever since the incident with Mark, I also did it to be sure I had fair warning if he’d be anywhere nearby. Kendra and I were really close, and she always texted me whenever we were set to work together, usually a long string of happy emojis.\n\nI was certain she hadn’t been on the roster at all today.\n\nMy heart thudded against my ribs, and both hands turned slick with sweat.\n\nIn the faint glow of my light, I could just begin to make out the contours of Kendra’s pale face.\n\nShe was smiling. \n\nWide. \n\nFar too wide.\n\nI took a step back.\n\nKendra lunged forward, letting out a croaking screech that rang in my ears.\n\nReacting too slow, I raised my arms to protect myself, and locked eyes with her.\n\nKendra’s eyes were a flood of off-white, as if they’d rolled into the back of her head, and her mouth hung open in a gape that couldn’t be normal for how wide it was. Her teeth were squared-off and stubby, almost like they’d been carved in some weird woodcraft festival, and yet she grinned in a stiff way that made my blood run cold.\n\nLike a rabid dog, she hurled herself into me, and we both went flying to the ground.\n\nI would have screamed, but the blow knocked the wind out of me, Kendra straddling my chest and pinning me with her weight. Desperate to escape, I squirmed to prevent her manic fingers from reaching my face, as she seemed intent on clawing my eyes out. Her skin was cold as ice, and surprisingly hard, dense like a chair leg. My feeble jabs didn’t seem to have any impact, and it felt like I was punching a wall. All the while, Kendra’s bizarre jaws snapped inches from my face, her fetid breath blasting me with the stench of rot.\n\nShe grabbed both my wrists with her vice-like grip, and I felt my energy slipping away, my strength gone, sapped by unforgiving fear.\n\n*No, no, no . . .*\n\nGaining the upper hand, she held down my arms, and I couldn’t stop the panic, sobbing and writhing in the mud. Something in the way Kendra grinned at me in malicious, animalistic joy, told me that my fate would not only be painful, but slow, and that death should be the least of my worries.\n\nMy mind flashed to my dad’s smile, my mom’s warm hugs, to my sister and brother, and my own cozy room covered in movie posters and Skyrim art. I wanted nothing more than to see them again, to get back in my car and drive home, to wake up from this horrible nightmare I’d somehow fallen into. In the last few moments, I pictured Mark’s soft brown eyes, his debonair smile, and the way he’d warned me with fear heavy in his voice.\n\n*Text me when you get home, okay?*\n\nI squeezed my eyes shut and turned my face to the muck as Kendra’s lukewarm breath hissed in my ear, ready for her to rip into me like a juicy steak.\n\n*Whack.*\n\nThe crack of wood-on-wood pierced the air above my face, and Kendra wrenched backward, something coarse and wet spattering over my face.\n\nAt last I screamed, still paralyzed by fear, afraid to open my eyes.\n\nKendra’s bulk slid off me, and more footsteps bounded up next to my head. A few more loud *cracks* echoed, as if a two-by-four had been smashed against a wall repeatedly.\n\nSomething grabbed the back of my jacket collar, and started to pull me down the road, oblivious to my frightened hyperventilation. Thunder roared, and even through my closed eyelids, I could see a monstrous shadow framed against the bright lightning nearby, standing over the road.\n\n*It’s got me.*\n\nMy arms came back to life, and I thrashed, kicked, and screamed with all my might, like my mother had told me to do if someone ever tried to drag me into their van. I wanted to go home, wanted to live, and even if it meant biting and clawing my way out, I would do it.\n\nWhatever had hold of my jacket let go, and my eyes flew open so I could make a run for it.\n\n“*Stop*.” A hand clamped over my mouth, while an arm wound around my chest to yank me off the road, and deep into the murky brush. “You want to get us both killed?”\n\n*Wait, what?*\n\nBoth legs went limp the instant that voice jerked me from my panic. Could it be?\n\n“Marmmm?” I murmured into the calloused hand over my mouth.\n\nMy captor tensed, and more whispered words tickled my right ear. “Stay still. It’s close.”\n\nI didn’t have time to protest.\n\nOn the opposite side of the road, a tall, lumbering figure moved through the trees in long, slow strides, its head swaying slowly back and forth, as if searching for something. Each step the being took made the ground shake, small tremors moving up from the mud into my chest, as if a steel mill were right beside me. One hand swung freely at its side, like a person out for a walk, while the other held on to a long mass of what looked like black strands draped over its pebble-gray shoulder, attached to a load that I couldn’t see from where I sat. I still couldn’t make out its face, so high up and shrouded in darkness was it, and while it had arms, legs, and a body like a person, I somehow knew in the depths of my frightened mind that this thing was far from natural.\n\nThe massive creature wandered on down the road, letting out long, loud bellows at random intervals that sounded kind of like beluga whale calls, the eerie siren song making my head swim.\n\nAs soon as it trailed out of sight, a dark form shifted in from of me, and a newfound panic rose in my throat at the shove of someone pushing me hard against a rock so I couldn’t wriggle free.\n\nRed light filled my field of vision, and I slammed my eyes shut in confusion at the glow that hovered over my face. The hand left my mouth at last, only to return with the cold sensation of a knife blade pressed to my neck.\n\nAgain, a low voice hissed through the dark. “Say your name.”\n\n*What did I do, I don’t understand, what did I do to deserve this?*\n\nI choked down a whimper and tried to stay calm. “Please, I just—”\n\n“I said *say your name*.” The shadow with Mark’s voice snarled in a vicious tone I’d never heard him take with anyone before.\n\nMy skin prickled, and I had never felt more helpless than in that moment. I had always trusted Mark, and never in my wildest nightmares would I have thought of him hurting me. Now I was at his mercy, and I thought with bitter remorse of my rejection, and how he might seek vengeance for it.\n\n“Madison.” I squeaked, praying it was really him, and that somehow, he’d let me go. “Mark, please don’t—”\n\n“What kind of cupcakes do you make?” The knife didn’t move, and I felt it brush my skin as I swallowed nervously.\n\n“S-Strawberry. Strawberry upside-down.”\n\nThere was a long, terrifying pause.\n\nThe knife left my throat, and the figure pulled me up from the cold rock he had me pinned to.\n\nTwo arms wove around me, and held me close, so close that I could smell the mint aftershave on his neck and burned cordite on his gray jacket. He tucked the open folds of his coat around my shoulders to surround me in warmth, his dry uniform shirt soaking up some of the rainwater from mine. The harshness vanished like melted snow, and a tenderness radiated through his embrace that made everything seem a little less dark.\n\n“What are you doing here, Maddie?”\n\nAt the sound of my name, I wound my hands up in the cloth of Mark’s shirt and pressed my face to his collar in relief. “My car . . . my car, I got stuck . . . Kendra . . .”\n\n“Yeah, I know.” Mark rubbed my back between both tense shoulder blades, his touch comforting. “It wasn’t her.”\n\nWith my face buried into his cozy jacket lapels, I fought tears that brimmed in my eyes, too afraid to be embarrassed. “What’s going on?”\n\nAnother roll of thunder growled overhead, and somewhere off in the woods, a shriek echoed into the night.\n\n“We have to go.” Mark slid his arms under my armpits and hauled me to my feet. “It’s not safe here.”\n\nBut I clung to him, refused to let go, too cold and scared to leave the heated sanctuary of his coat. “What’s going on, Mark? What was that thing? Why did Kendra . . . why did she . . .”\n\nMark clicked his flashlight on and held it so I could see his face.\n\nIn the red beam, Mark’s brown eyes appeared black, his face grim, and there were scratches on his right cheek as if someone had dug their fingernails into his skin. “Maddie, I need you to trust me, alright? I’ll explain once we have some breathing room. Now come on.”\n\nEvery instinct I had wanted to refuse, to beg him to run with me back to my waiting car, so I speed home to my warm house. I just wanted this nightmare to end, yet something primal inside my guts told me that I wouldn’t get ten feet without Mark. Like it or not, I needed him, and he seemed bound and determined to plunge deeper into the forests surrounding that cursed road.\n\nAnother cold gust of wind raked its cruel tendrils over my face, and I shivered. “Okay.”\n\nMark grabbed my hand, and without a word, led me deeper into the darkness.\n\nMy shoes slid on the mud, thorns stuck into my thin coat, and the rain continued to sap me of whatever body heat I had left. Still, I never let go of his hand, for fear this strange labyrinth would swallow him like it had my old beater and leave me at the mercy of whatever other apparitions were out there. My fate was sealed now, my survival intwined with Mark’s, and I followed him blindly through the abyss, hoping with every step that he had some plan to get me out of Tauerpin Road.",

        "text": "I’m French, I’m 20.\n\nIn my high school, there was a special line. It was for musicians and allowed us to go to high school only in the morning and to take advantage of the afternoon to work at the conservatory (classes, personal work, etc).\n\nMost of the time, we all went only towards the closing of the conservatory, that is to say around 9:30 pm, in order to make the most of the time we could spend there. By winter, of course, night fell earlier. Because of this, as well as some testimonies from previous students in this field reporting some assaults, the girls often returned earlier, sometimes accompanied by their boyfriend. Personally, preferring to work to the maximum because of my delay (I had just enough points to get into this line), I continued to leave late, sometimes alone, sometimes with friends. That night, I came to the highschool alone.\n\nAh, gee … I forgot to mention two details. First of all, I had no beard or mustache at that time, so I was mistaken for a girl, even from the front. Secondly, we all took a shortcut to go back to boarding school, which saved us at least 5 to 10 minutes.\n\nIn short. One evening, like every other evening, I decided to leave. This time, my friends were not there. Leaving the conservatory, I started my usual route (15 minutes walk at most). Finally comes the shortcut, I was only a few minutes away from school. The alley was not one of those dark, creepy alleys worthy of bad horror movies, on the contrary. It was quite wide, rather well lit, with buildings with windows lit most of the time, which always ensured a little security, because if we had to scream, someone would hear us.\n\nKnowing that the boarding school closed relatively late, it gave me plenty of time to walk more calmly. I liked the silence and, with the exception of two or three cars, this street was very quiet. I enjoyed it. But the silence was broken when I heard weak footsteps behind me. This caused me blood for a very simple reason: I watched a lot of horror movies. I then had two thoughts, either one of my friends or an average person, or I became a target myself. The second option seemed unlikely to me, but for some reason, I decided to put all the odds on my side. \n\nContinuing to walk, I tried to place my phone so that I could see the reflection. I managed, but the black screen did not allow me to discern anything about this person. I waited then for the next car parked, placed at about fifteen meters, to try to see it better. This time, I managed to discern his clothes. He was not someone I knew.\n\nAt the time, I didn’t realize it, but looking back, I think more and more he saw me looking at him in the rearview mirror of the car.\n\nSuddenly, the pace accelerated, just a little bit. I was then accelerating a little too. But it accelerated again. We continued then. Finally, I started running. I was approaching the hospital fence, which meant that at the next turn, I’d be in front of the door to the boarding school. But I suddenly remembered that to get in, I would have to ring. Was there anyone at the office ? Or were they all on floors ?\n\nMore and more frightened, tears began to flow down my cheeks. I kept telling myself inwardly, \"Why me ? Why me ? Why me ?\"\n\nI was running as fast as I could, when a noise relieved me like never before. This noise was none other than that of a car coming from the other end of the alley rather quickly, in a few seconds they would have caught me ! But the strange man didn’t want to give up, not now that he was so close… Yes, close he was, because a few seconds before the car passed I felt him trying to grab my bag, but the handle slipped between his hands. Then the car passed, one of the passengers lowered the window and screamed :\n\n\"Hey, what’s going on ?\", looking at them, I think they saw my tears and my expression, I started to run more and more, thinking, \"What if they were in cahoots ?\"\n\nI reached the door, and pressed the doorbell at least ten times very quickly, before turning around and seeing… that there was nobody. The car passed in another street, probably not having seen that I had turned the corner, as for the man, he had simply disappeared. Finally, the door opened, I went in and closed it again very quickly, before going up crying, the supervisors not understanding anything about my stammering.\n\nHowever, I have not finished this message.\n\nFirst, I’m still not over this experience. I don’t sleep in the dark, I close the curtain of my velux for fear of seeing a shadow again, and I check every night a dozen times that my door is locked. I took martial arts classes to defend myself and I always take a phone charger for the day.\n\nSecondly, I didn’t tell anyone about this man, except my friends and the monitors, not even the police.\n\nAnd finally, I thought about it, and I know why, even though he was so close to the car, he tried to grab my bag. As I said, I was walking past a hospital fence, which was easy to climb. I know what would’ve happened if I just slowed down a little, and I know where he went missing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've finished. Sorry for my bad english.",

See, before the customer, someone else came in. A man in a black suit walked in, then to my exasperation, flashed a badge at me. He said in an overly-professional, pompous tone that he was Agent Thomas Moore from some three-letter agency (I don’t remember which, and I don’t care to). According to him, we were in possession of certain items of interest to the American nation, and he wished to buy them from me. \n\nNow, let me fill you in on something regarding the Emporium: it may have a warehouse containing many strange artifacts, but it isn’t “Warehouse 13.” It isn’t government-owned in any capacity. Not only that, but because of its “in-between” state, it acts as a sort of neutral ground for government, corporate, and military activity, regardless of which world they came from. Essentially we aren’t obligated or even allowed to exchange with any of the three above bodies. I explained this to the agent as politely as possible, even showing him written documentation the boss--who I’ll call “Mr. A” from here on out--had given me for just these sorts of incidents. Taking the paper from my hand, he looked it over repeatedly, I guess to try and find some way of proving that it was a forgery. He must have figured out that the paperwork was legitimate, because soon enough, he thrust it back to me with a frustrated sneer. The agent made sure to tell me that he would find a way to recover those artifacts, told me I was a traitor to the American nation, called me Edward Snowden II, blah-de-blah. Nothing I haven’t heard from suits before.\n\nA few hours later, my actual customer, a pale man, dressed like royalty or nobility, stood in front of the door. He smiled with impeccably white, sharp teeth as he knocked on the glass. After a moment, he made a motion of clearing his throat and I immediately remembered my etiquette. Rushing to open the door for my vampiric customer, I apologized for my rudeness, but he just held up a clawed hand and told me it was no problem, happens all the time. Relieved that I wasn’t about to become his next meal, I got back behind the counter and waited to hear if he wanted to buy or sell something. He had come to make a purchase, asking for a certain family heirloom that had apparently been stolen and sold to the Emporium: a sword that could drain the blood of whoever had been cut by it. Asking him to wait a moment, I typed in his name, the details of the product, and stepped back into the warehouse. Shortly thereafter, I gave him the price: 30,000 Blood Crystals (which are exactly what they sound like). Nodding, he opened an old-fashioned bag, rifled around through it, then produced the proper amount and handed it to me. Smiling affably--well, as affably as you can be when you have long, blood-drinking fangs in your mouth--he shook my hand and thanked me. Ignoring the icy-cold feel of his hand, I thanked him as well for his patronage. He took the weapon, then after patting Cerberus on his middle head, stepped outside, then vanished into a cloud of smoke. Most vampires are very polite when they visit; the ones that aren’t are usually going through something like blood withdrawal, or else they’re just arrogant scumbags. But hey, who am I to judge, right? \n\nSome hours and several customers later, Mr. A called. He asked how things had been going. I gave him my report, and he groaned at the mention of Agent Moore. “Sorry you had to deal with that, lad,” he said in his elderly Irish accent. “These fellas dunno how to take a hint.” “Heh, tell me about it,” I scoffed. Then I remembered the incident in the warehouse. “Hey, uh, Mr. A?” \n\n“Hm?” \n\n“There was something in the warehouse last night. Not an apparition. Something got in, didn't go through the doors...”\n\nThere was silence on the other end, then in an uncharacteristically shaky tone, Mr. A said, “G-go on.” \n\nI described the creature, and he began muttering nervously to himself. “H-hey, Mr. A?” I asked. He stopped, then cleared his throat. He proceeded to explain that this creature was called “the Vagrant.” According to him, it had been hounding him for years, giving threatening phone calls, entering the shop through the warehouse despite there being no way of doing so, and killing several previous owners of the shop. He sighed and said that he understood if I wanted to quit, knowing that last bit of information. I was surprised, to be sure, but I told him that I didn't have much to go back to if I did quit. He seemed relieved but was apologetic all the same for not explaining. He told me that a lot of things were unknown about the Vagrant. Even he didn’t know what it was, and after he had first encountered it, he went to “Them” (the beings who granted him this place to make this shop) and demanded an explanation. They were apparently just as confused and unnerved as he was.\n\nNow, just let that sink in: eldritch beings that “own” a Limbo-esque dimension are unaware of a creature able to enter and exit pocket dimensions, and they're straight-up disturbed by it. As I spoke to Mr. A, I looked at my watch, seeing that the big hand was on twelve, and the little hand was on two. \n\nRemember when I said in my last post that I “wasn’t a mind-reader, that’s my watch’s job”? Well, said watch is capable of telling not only if someone I’m speaking to is being honest, but how much so, and if the secret they’re telling is potentially harmful. According to the watch, yes, he was keeping some secrets, but no, they weren’t overly harmful. It went back to both hands on midnight when he said he cared about his employees, that we weren’t just food for the Vagrant or anything of the sort. \n\nEventually, he told me to keep an eye out, be careful, let him know if the Vagrant came back or did anything out of the ordinary, and whatever happens, don’t let it through the front door. Then he hung up. \n\nI’m not saying Mr. A isn’t a secretive man, but he’s proven to be trustworthy over the past few years working for him. And in all that time, he’s never shown so much concern in his voice. I can’t really be bothered to be suspicious right now, though. I have bigger concerns.\n\nAbout a minute after he hung up, Cerberus growled as the phone rang again. Before I could give my usual greeting, a familiar chuckle came over the speaker, then a raspy voice said, “The old man still thinks he can keep me out. Tsk tsk tsk. Last night was as close as I’ve gotten. Never know; I might be able to get closer next time.” Shaking, I slammed the phone on the receiver. It kept ringing, but I refused to answer. A nearby slot began printing out pieces of paper with the transcribed messages of the Vagrant. I’m not about to repeat the things it said, except one. \n\n*It’s nice here under your bed.*",

        "text": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/10zwwep/revival_part_1_of_2/)\n\nTrack 5 \n\nFirst I started noticing that her skin was losing its normal color turning into a more grayish tone but she was still breathing so I tried to wake her up but got no response from her it seems like she was in a very deep sleep and the problem now was that I couldn't carry her all the way to the town so I considered if I should just leave Her there and try to get help but what if she woke up and I was not going to be here to help Her. \n\nNot more than half an hour had passed when she started to move like she was having convulsions but  her eyes were closed and she continued like this for some minutes until her mouth opened and this liquid started to come out, it was red but not as full red as blood and also she was not vomiting because there was no violence in his movements but it was just her mouth opened up a little bit to let this liquid come out and I felt ashamed as the smell was so bad I couldn't stay close to her, I got some shirts out from my luggage and try to clean her up but it wouldn't stop coming out so I put her head up so she wouldn't suffocate but all of a sudden she woke up and started to scream, she said she couldn't move her arms and she also perceive the smell and soon enough the pain started so she continued to scream as loud as she could until she fainted probably out of pain, I started to feel the coldness of her arms and they where extremely cold and turning black and there was nothing I could do about it but just stay there with Her but then the thought came out into my brain that if  “She would had stayed for me?” and I knew the answer was that  She would have probably left by now so I was tempted to do the same but for some reason that I don't know what I was as always I didn't.\n\nNot that much time passed when I saw that her legs started to have the same effect as her arms so I laid down in the floor not knowing what to do but decided to just wait for something to happen, the legs where turning also gray and  this slime substance started to come out from the superior part of the legs just in the area where they join to the rest of the body and I could see how the skin started to erode with this liquid slowly separating from the rest of the body even though I knew how catastrophic this was for her I was hypnotized by this effect of slowly seen how the skin opened and separated until the legs just felt down and just like with the liquid coming out of her mouth the smell was unbearable, she was still unconscious and I believe that at that point she had no pain so I covered her and decided to go to find a doctor but before leaving I checked before and she was still breathing.\n\nI didn't wanted to leave her body this exposed so I went back inside and I could see her eyes were open but didn't seem to acknowledge anything going on around her and after some time she finally moved her head and looked at me and again started to scream, she looked like she wanted to say something but the only thing she could do was scream and I could see the fear in his eyes. I couldn't leave her body here but it was too heavy to try and bring it with me so I decided to take her down into the basement and there she would be safe, I could lock the door and nothing could go inside but I had to do it now because I didn't want it to get dark outside so I started carrying her but her head was not stable, her eyes were open but she wasn't able to keep her head up and with precaution I brought here down to the basement were light was coming through a window and it seem like a good dry and clean place to leave her, I set her in the floor and took a blanket out to cover her when I noticed that her skin under her shirt looked different so I took her shirt off and realized her skin was getting purple and her veins were extremely marked all over her body just like if they were getting asphyxiated from the inside. \n\nI have to accept that a part of me felt trapped because she was not going to survive but what if she did?  What if the doctor was able to get her to survive and what was my obligation to her?, did she even want to live like this? Should I still consider bringing a doctor? After what she did to me during all our time together and all the different ways she had humiliated me over all these years and right there I felt relief and I could finally breathe. \n\nI left the basement and continue with the idea of going to the town and bring a doctor but as soon as I was about to exit the cabin the reality of the situation hit me and I realized I and only I had to take care of this for her and also for me, so I took the shovel and went back to the basement.\n\ntrack 6\n\nWhen I was going down the stairs to the basement an idea hit me, never in my life was I hit like that by an idea and it was like if the whole world had stopped while I was processing it, Why do I always have to accelerate when I had to make a decision? Why do I always fail to see the opportunities in my problems?, and the answer for the first time was clear, what if this is exactly what I needed in my life? I have never seen an insect like this, something I could claim as my discovery and her skin was changing so quickly that there was definitely going to be a change in her. What was she transforming too?. I thought that the smartest thing to do was to collect blood samples or tissue, something I could bring to be analyzed later because it was definitely going to be worth something.\n\nI opened the door and I could see her body just where I left her at the other side of the room but something was different because all her skin looked almost completely gray now and something inside appeared to be moving so I got closer and could see the body in a sitting position occasionally moving to every side like if something was hitting her from the inside, there was a clicking noise coming from there so I got closer and I thought maybe she was going to speak again bot nothing came out just her eyes where opened but it didn't appear to be looking at nothing so I made some quick movements but she was not reacting to them and her movements continued. \n\nI could see how the middle of her face was getting slowly pushed out like if something was growing on the inside and couldn't fit anymore and was pushing itself to try to get out and more and more you could see her eyes, forehead,mouth just moving outwards like if a balloon was being inflated and I could hear the cracking of the bones as it was getting more and more filled and after some time I could now see the skin ripping in different places like the forehead was now open and I could see the whiteness of the bones already separated and getting out of the head continuing with the nose being ripped in half and the mouth giving up and ripping in a horizontal way, a second push put almost everything completely out and now I could see like if the inside of the body was coming out and another push finally ripped the head apart completely breaking all he bones and skin in the head and revealing this round “insect” covered in blood coming out from her head walking directly to me and before I could do any movement I could feel something pinching me and I looked down and there it was that black tube connected to my hand and almost instantly I started to feel some liquid coming into my body, I looked straight at the face of the thing covered completely in blood but I was sure I could distinguish her face in it. I stayed quiet and allowed her to complete what she was doing to me.\n\nFor a moment I thought we were communicating, his black inexpressive eyes fixed on me and I wondered if she wanted to hurt me or if it was just unconscious animal behavior, I manage to pull this thing out of me ran out of the basement and lock the door. The same transformation that happened to my wife will now happen to me and I couldn't allow this to continue because I didn't want to go through it myself so I picked up the fire fluid and went down the basement with the intention of ending it all. \n\ntrack 7\n\nI opened the door and saw this thing just standing there without any movement that it almost looked like it was afraid, It looked so passive that I didn't thought it could move fast enough to be a real treat anymore and I kept thinking that this could still be my wife and I shouldn't just leave her like that alone down here so I closed the door and decided to burn the whole cabin, is for the best. I will burn the cabin and I will lock the basement door and have my own transformation in here next to her. \n\nI recorded this tape to explain what happened to me and my wife. I will now put it in the steel box you found it and ask you to carefully come down to the basement and pick what is left of us.",

        "text": "It was probably the most exciting day of church there’s ever been. Nine out of ten times I’d have been beggin’ Momma to let me play on her phone. Most times she’d let me, as long as I keep the sound off. She says I “drive her up a wall,” but I don’t see how. I don’t have a car, and even if I did, I ain’t never seen a car drive up a wall before. But not that day. That day I was just fine sitting on that awful wood bench. \n\nWe were almost always the first to arrive. I’m not sure why Momma was so bent on gettin’ there early. Figure she might need extra time to ask God to forgive her the sin of makin’ her only daughter wake up early on the weekend and put on a dress. She always makes us sit right in the front, too. I hate it quite a lot. We’re the only ones who sit up there, so Pastor Tim always looks right at me during his talkin’, like he wants to make sure I’m listening. I never am though. I always want to stick my tongue out at him when he does that. He gives me the creeps. \n\nToday I couldn’t stand being in the front even more than normal, what with Grandma Hazel’s casket just sittin’ there. Momma said she expects a packed house today for her service, but I couldn’t imagine how. Hardly nobody I ever met had ever seen her ‘til she was already dead. She never came out of her house, never went to church, or anything. I only ever knew she existed because her house sat right next to ours by the lake and I was always askin’ why Momma was bringing casseroles over to her house every week after church.\n\nNobody believes me when I say I saw Grandma Hazel walk right into the lake two days before her body washed up on shore. Not Momma, not Pedro, not any of my teachers. I swear I did, though. I like to stay up late sometimes and play some on my Switch after Momma sends me to bed. That’s when I saw her. I left that part out of my story when I told her, though. I’m not dumb. \n\nSee, but here’s the thing, I wouldn’t forget this. I had never once in all my nine years seen anybody, or anything, come out that door, so you can imagine how I was pretty surprised. Pedro says it couldn’t have been her, but I can’t imagine how it could be anyone \\_other\\_ than Grandma Hazel, seeing as how I’d never seen anyone so old and wrinkled in my life. She walked right out that back door. The sound spooked me. I was thinking I was about to get in trouble for playing video games, but instead I saw Grandma Hazel walk right out her back door. But that wasn’t the weird thing. The weird thing was she walked dead straight, right into her backyard gate, and passed \\_right through it\\_, and just kept on walkin’ right into the lake. She didn’t even wince from the cold like I do. Just right into the lake and disappeared.\n\nI think that’s why people don’t believe me. I wouldn’t believe it either. \n\nSo anyway, after the body washed up, now I have to go to church twice in one week. I see why killin’ yourself is a sin. \n\nEven though Momma thinks a bunch of people will come today, pretty much nobody comes anymore, even though we have lots of room. I always wish I could sit on the balcony, but they don’t even bother to unlock the door to the stairs anymore. I asked Momma once why we gotta get here so early and sit right up front when there’s so much room, and she always just tells me “this is where we sit.” \n\nMomma likes to make up stories. She thinks she can trick me, but I’m too smart. She tells me this place used to be packed full, so full people would stand against the walls just to listen to old Pastor Tim babble. She says he did something amazing once, something like Jesus, but won’t tell me what. Says it isn’t for ‘young ears.’ But I know what that really means. That’s just something grown-ups say when they’re lying to kids. \n\nI heard the old wooden doors creak open, and I flipped around, hoping to see my best friend Pedro. He and his family always sit by themselves too, but they get to sit in the back. Some of the old people give him weird looks, but I don’t know why. Sure enough, Pedro and his dad had slid into a bench at the back. I scurried off to go say hi. Momma doesn’t like me running in church, but sometimes she forgets when Pedro is here. When Pedro saw me, he looked up at his dad, who nodded, and we crashed into the pew on the opposite side. \n\n“Go all the way down,” he said, motioning towards the window. He had a weird look on his face. Like somethin’ had sucked out all his happiness. \n\n“What’s the matter?” He put his finger to his lips and shushed me. He could probably tell I was about the work myself up into protest because he just kept talkin’, in a whisper. \n\n“I saw something.” \n\n“Saw what?” I said. He shushed me again. \n\n“Pastor Tim.”\n\n“Pastor Tim? So, what? I’ve seen him a million —”\n\n“He was different. Acting \\_weird\\_.” I had just about had it with Pedro interrupting me and was fixing to sock him in the arm soon. \n\n“Weird how?” I asked, secretly clenching my fist. Pedro shuffled in his seat and glanced towards the empty pulpit. \n\n“Weird \\_how\\_, Pedro? You better tell me.” Pedro bent in even closer, so close I could smell his breakfast on his breath. \n\n“Pedro! Get your stinking mouth out of my ear.” Then Pedro whispered so quietly into my ear it sent shivers down my neck. \n\n“I saw him walk out of the lake.” \n\nJust then the doors to the chapel swung open and Pastor Tim walked down the aisle, holding somethin’ in his hands. He stank, too. Usually, when he passed me on his way to the pulpit, he would scrunch up his face into some ugly smile at me. I always hated it, and I would have hated it double today if I had to smell him for one second longer. But he didn’t seem to notice me. In fact, he didn’t seem to notice anyone. \n\nHe was drenched to the bone, and his clothes left a wet trail all down the aisle. People gasped at him as he walked down the aisle. I thought at the time they were gasping at his clothes, or his stink, but now that I think back on it, I guess it was because of what was in his hands. I hadn’t grabbed a look yet, as I was stewing some righteous indignation about how Pastor Tim can show up wet and smelly, but I had to shower and wear a dress. \n\nThe gasps had grown louder. One lady even shrieked. It wasn’t me, though. The grown-ups were quite worked out about something. It wasn’t until Pastor Tim finally climbed all three of the stairs at the front of the chapel and turned around to face us that I finally realized what he was holding. \n\nA human head cut right off at the neck. Pastor Tim propped it up right at the front of the pulpit as he addressed the crowd. I had never seen a human head before. This one still had a few strands of gray scraggly hair draped over its face, but not enough that I couldn’t tell it had no eyes. The skin was warped and bloated and all kinds of shades of blue. In parts beneath it, I could see bone. \n\n I popped right up to the edge of my seat. I wish church were always like that. \n\n“Thank you for coming today.” He said it like he didn’t have a human head in front of him, like it was all just business as usual. \n\n“I know I’m a little early, but I’m afraid we’ve run out of time.” I looked around at the smattering of people at the service. I knew I’d be right. “So thank you to those that had the courtesy of showing up early for this important day. I wish I could wait longer. If it were up to me, my compassion would compel me to wait until the very last hour, until the very heavens split open and Jesus Himself poured his mercy and judgment down upon us all. But it is not up to me.” Pastor Tim sure loved to listen to himself talk. I guess I would too if I knew all those fancy words. \n\n“Have not the people had their time? Have they not had their warnings? Has not every living soul in Twin Lakes heard the gospel? Have they not had their chances, each week, for years, decades, their whole \\_lives\\_ to make it here, today?” Pastor Tim had gotten himself worked up into one of frenzies. He seems to get mad at nothing an awful lot. \n\n“No. Today is the day the Lord has made. And we shall rejoice, brothers and sisters.” Just then he did somethin’ real weird. He stroked the hair on the head in front of him, clearing it from her eyes. Then his eyes darted around the congregation. People had got real restless.\n\n“Few of you knew Hazel very well. But I did. For the last 40 years, you had been told that she had come down with a terrible illness and could not walk or care for herself. I too had said these things. I am ashamed to admit, friends, that I lied to you. The truth is, she was not weak, nor sick, but strong. Stronger than any of us.” \n\nHe paused for a long while here, and I figured he had forgotten what he was saying in his old age. \n\n“Brothers and sisters, believe me now, have faith in my words — she was an angel, sent by God on a holy and blessed mission.” \n\nSome people had gotten angry, so Pastor Tim had to yell to be heard. \n\n“Listen to me!” His voice took a tone I had never heard before, so powerful it rattled the windows and a splitting pain rattled in my brain. A hush fell over the crowd. Nobody dared speak. \n\n“You are all, each of you, in danger. We have lived with a spirit, a demon, if you will, inside the very depths of Twin Lakes. I have known this for years, and together, Hazel and I kept all of you safe. But God has chosen the hour of reckoning to come, and He, in His mercy, has had enough of our debauchery. He has allowed His angel to die. There is nothing that can be done. We are judged.” \n\nHe paused again before lifting the head eye to eye with his own. His voice got real quiet again. “My sweet angel, dearest Hazel. Judge me, first.” Then he did the most awful, the most disgusting, the most \\_amazing\\_ thing I’ve ever seen. He kissed it. Right on the lips. Pedro nearly vomited from gagging so hard, but I couldn’t peel my eyes away. \n\nWhen old Pastor Tim finally pulled that head off his lips, he had tears in his eyes. His lips were quivering.\n\n“Thank you, Lord.” He bowed his head, probably because he was gonna puke from kissing a dead lady. Then his eyes shot up so fast it startled me. He pointed right next to me, right at Pedro’s dad. \n\n“Francisco Martinez. Come. Find if you are right with the Lord.” The entire room was so quiet I was too afraid to move and risk a creak in the wood. Sure enough, Pedro’s dad got out of his seat, and I noticed he had tears in his eyes. I couldn’t figure why. Just before he left the pew, he leaned in real close to both of us, looked us right in the face, and whispered. \n\n“Run.”\n\nI couldn’t quite make out where he wanted us to go, so I stayed put. Momma wouldn’t be too happy with me running in church, especially during a funeral. Pedro’s dad walked real slow up to the pulpit. I couldn’t blame him. I bet that head stunk twice as bad as old Pastor Tim did. When Pedro’s dad made it to the front, Pastor Tim raised the head, and wouldn’t you know it, Pedro’s dad went and kissed it too. But this time it didn’t go so good. \n\nMr. Martinez fell to his knees, groaning something awful, clutching his stomach. The head opened its mouth and a blinding white light filled the room. When I could finally see again, Pedro’s dad was gone. Poof. Disappeared. I thought it was a trick, a pretty obvious one if I’m honest. But it sure caused some chaos in the crowd. People screamed and knocked over the pews. \n\nMomma was screaming too. “Shelly! Shelly, where are you?” I figured I must have done something wrong. Momma never calls me Shelly unless I’m in trouble. She used to call me Shelly-bean, kinda like jellybean, because I ‘was her little sweet thing,’ and then eventually that turned into just Bean. Shelly had turned into someone else. Someone who is always in trouble. Before I knew it, Momma had appeared before me and swept me up in her arms and I was outside the building. She let me down and told me to run to the car with a seriousness in her voice I’ve never heard before. I didn’t dare argue, and I got into the backseat and buckled myself in. \n\nIn the weeks since, Momma has done a lot of talking with me. She cries a lot when she does. We’ve been living in a hotel, which has been a lot of fun. Momma lets me go swimming every night. Plus, we don’t have to go to church anymore. Instead, she makes me go talk to a doctor every week. He’s nice enough. He gives me candy. I never got candy at church. \n\nI miss Pedro, though. I wonder if I’ll ever see him again. I wonder if he ever found where his dad was [hiding.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldArchitect/comments/yv369y/thanks_for_being_here/)",

        "text": "There is a ceiling to the universe, and there’s something possibly very sinister beyond it. Our theories were all wrong. We were under the impression for a long time that the universe was constantly expanding, but we were wrong. We found an “end” a few years back and we really had no choice but to accept that as reality. \n\nIn the year 2016, the development of a new astronomical observatory was completed and began its orbit around the sun very soon after. It was called the Ruthford telescope and it was far stronger than any telescope we’ve seen before. It was stronger than the James Webb telescope by a lot. However, NASA always waits to reveal new technology like this to the public, they always have. In case we happen to find evidence of alien life, among other more minor reasons. In fact, NASA was probably hundreds of years more advanced in technology than the average citizen knew.\n\nMy team and I were the first ones to inhabit this telescope. Our first assignment was to take a picture of as far away as possible. It takes around a week for the picture we take to fully develop and what we found was peculiar to say the least. \n\nIt was a ceiling. Or what looked like a ceiling at least. It was off white and textured. It was quite uncanny really. Of course we knew it had to simply be a coincidence, the universe existed before ceilings. But it had all of us confused. It wasn’t noticeably expanding or anything, this was simply the end of the universe. We had a multitude of questions. Is there anything beyond it? Is the ceiling physical? What’s it made out of? \n\nWe estimated how large the ceiling is compared to the milky way galaxy and tried comparing it in the picture. The galaxy was too small, it was barely a pixel in the picture. So we knew this was big and theorized this ceiling likely wrapped around the universe. We decided to point the telescope in another direction to see if there was more of this ceiling. A couple weeks later, our theory had been confirmed. Of course we had to do more tests and take quite a few pictures, but my team and I knew.\n\nAfter confirming our theory, we decided to put full resources towards studying this ceiling. We were trying to collect any sounds coming from that area, as well as more pictures. Nearly a year of nothing. Just more and more pictures of the ceiling. A couple months ago however, we got a sound. But this sound came from beyond the ceiling. It sounded like slow muffled stepping. Like someone walking on a creaky floor above you. This only confused us even more. Everyone had their own theories. Maybe there were more galaxies beyond it, and space debris could be hitting the other side. Galaxies even. But I knew not even a galaxy hitting the ceiling would create that loud of a noise. If the ceiling had any thickness to it at all, then something very very big would be needed to create that noise.\n\nFor a couple months, that was it. Constant stepping. It was also clear that the stepping was never in the same place. It was moving along a path. Every few steps were far louder, as if something stomped. I couldn’t get the idea out of my mind. The idea that there was something beyond the ceiling, and that it was walking. And its steps were so loud, we could hear it 46.5 billion light years away. This terrified not only my team, but everyone in our program.\n\nLast week, we heard a loud and clear break. A loud snapping noise. A part of this strange layer clearly broke. We found a dark spot. There’s a hole in this ceiling and it seems like something got through. Being that we’re seeing and hearing this now, we know this happened billions of years ago. But the light and sound has made it to us, who knows how close behind it could be?",

        "text": "If you don’t know what’s going on, please read my previous posts or refer to my YouTube channel which is linked to this account.\n\nI had an old Rottweiler mixed named Wyatt. I’ve had him since I was a baby, he was probably around 16-17. I would let him outside every few hours to prevent him from having any accidents inside the house because of his old man bladder. He usually stays outside for 10 minutes or so (sometimes longer so he could lay in the sun,) then he scratches at the door to be let back in. I let him out a few weeks back in the evening, he never scratched on the door. After 45 minutes or so I began to get worried, so I went out to check on him. I spent a good 20 minutes searching before I found his body behind my shed, his head torn off from his body. I couldn’t find his head.\n\nHis body had no bite marks and no wounds, just his head ripped off. It wasn’t a clean slice, like a sword; it was like it was TORN. There was no signs of struggle around, and I didn’t hear him yelp or bark, absolutely nothing.\n\nThis same exact thing happened to my cat Smokey a while back, but he was covered in bite marks. I came to the conclusion it was probably coyotes, but I no longer believe that because I don’t think a coyote can kill a 100lbs dog without leaving any marks and proceed to tear the dogs head off, it doesn’t make sense.\n\nI also had 2 of my cats dead a month or so back, too. Their heads weren’t torn off, but they were laid in front of my door in a way that means they could’ve only be placed there by someone. They were stacked on top of each other, and cats don’t naturally just die stacked on top of each other.\n\nI’ve called the cops, and they’ve come to my house and told me they literally cannot do anything without evidence of someone being on my property. They told me not to worry too much because it probably was coyotes or other stray dogs. I’ve set up 4  motion detection security cameras around my property, and the cops recommended that I leave the house until I feel safe. I’m currently staying upstate in a motel until I feel safe enough to return. My friend Malory is watching the animals for me.\n\nI’m just really scared and don’t know what to do. I already set up cameras and I’m staying upstate for a few days to get my bearings back, but I just feel so uncomfortable and unsafe in my home. Any advice on what I can do to protect myself and my animals would be appreciated.\n\nAlso, a side note; if this is someone who is reading this that has done this as some sort of sick joke, I will literally slaughter you like you did to my own pets. You don’t deserve to rest easy at night after the shit you’ve done to me and my innocent animals. Rot in hell.",
