My daughter kept playing with his mom &amp; was just being extra sweet &amp; adorable the entire play date. By the end of the play date, his mom was going, “You make me wish I have a daughter!

        "text": "When I first moved to the city I live in, I answered a Gumtree (British Craigslist) ad for a room in a nice modern flat, near a great area and with an en-suite bathroom. The landlord was around my age and lived in the flat as well. Kind of a weird awkward guy, but I didn't have much of a problem with that. He lived in the spare bedroom and owned nothing bar a table, 2 sets of clothes, a netbook and he slept on the floor whilst renting out the other two rooms. Again, weird but wasn't going to judge. It escaped my notice initially that he only rented to women, and usually foreign woman at that, and almost always single. Things were fine for about a year. We hung out sometimes and watched movies or went out to bars every now and then. Then after several years of single-dom, I got a boyfriend. \n\nUnbeknownst to me,  this was a problem for my landlord/housemate. My boyfriend didn't stay round all the time or anything, it wasn't like he was living there and not paying rent; just visted a few evenings and we were mostly confined to my room. Obviously I'm aware of there being issues around bringing in partners when you live in a shared house, but I also feel that if you rent your flat, you shouldn't expect people to not live their lives either. One day I was at work and my landlord texted me out of the blue telling me to move out. His reasoning was that the flat 'had become unsociable'. This blindsided me and I was very upset. My boyfriend immediately went onto Gumtree to try and find me a new place, only to find my landlord had advertised my room within minutes of texting me an eviction notice and the advert was ranting about how the applicants MUST be female and single. Clearly he was very intimidated by other men, and I guess I got punished for that. \n\nAs it happened, he had told me that he was claiming single occupancy on the flat receiving a council tax discount whilst renting to two other people. I packed up and left within a week, and reported him to the council for tax evasion. I wish I knew how much he had to pay back in dodged council tax.",

        "text": "So this happened last year around June, i was 15 at the time and my mom wasnt home, it was just my brother, our maid and I.\n\nAt the time, our condominium was changing this electricity thing in everyone’s house, like an update of sorts i guess. Everything was going as planned, the electricity dudes come in the house do their job and leave. The dogs where in the back or in their kennels, my dog BFG was in my room so he couldnt jump the fence. \n\nSo everything mostly went as planned, the electricity dude was well mannered, chatty and i kept watch to make sure nothing was stolen or invade they needed any help getting anywhere and the dogs needed to be moved, or they needed a key or whatever. Fine.\n\nThen toward the end, this bald dude in his 30´s asked how old i was, didn’t think anything of it, so i said im 15 as i was leading him out. This man proceeded to ask if he could take me to his home today and to marry me, no joke, wtf. I was mortified and anxious because wtf. So i replay “ummm no, your in your 30´s and im not interested”, and he continued to insist. Even when i walked him out the house walls, he said he would be back the next day to take me to his house. And im thinking wtf no. I close and lock the gates, release the dogs, tell my brother not to open the gate and our maid left the house after i told her about the situation and she told me not to tell anyone.\n\nObviously im not keeping this quiet. Imagine all the other people he could hurt. \n\nSo i told my mom, and guess what? We where close friends with his boss, and people in the ethics committee aswell in political power. So my mom phones him, phones the condominium people to make sure these people are supervised by someone the whole time to make sure they dont do anything funny. So when my mom phones the dude that asked me to marry him, he said i was a liar and that never happened, luckily my mom trusts me and knows i would never lie about this, because who would, this is fucked up. So my mom then calls her friends, they couldnt fire him for this but he got demoted to cleaning the sewer system of the company and is never allowed into anyones house again aswell as significantly decreasing his salary to barely above minimum wage. I know something else happened with the ethics committee but i dont remember what exactly. I think it had to do with installing new protocols to prevent this from happening.\n\nWe where also friends with some of his coworkers, so we told them what happened and told him to watch out because my bassicaly father (not my real dad but i consider him as much and he treats me as his daughter) and he’s one of the people in political power in the city, and they knew it, and my mom told the coworker to tell him to watch out because he was absolutely pissed off about what happened (he wouldnt acctualy do anything though, it was just to scare the dude).\n\nSo i think he deserved what he got, scared him shitless and ruined his career (as he deserves).",

Over the summer the yard got utterly overgrown and gnarly and ultimately turned into a pretty significant bug problem. Got friendly with our neighbors who told us the owner of the lot has refused to sell in previous years but also refuses to take care of the property. It’s an issue every year and no one has ever gotten him to do anything about it. Well I’m tired of hordes of massive spiders and centipedes getting into my house and all manner of wildlife fucking up my property so I don’t take this lying down, gf and I hit up the local public works building and file a complaint (said anti-neighbor also apparently works at city hall so this doubly rocks) which led to an inspector coming out to cite the guy. Fast forward a few days, and the grass is mowed and the rotting shed that was pretty much just serving as a raccoon motel finally has a door on it.\n\nNow it’s fall, which is where my call for suggestions comes in. I don’t have any trees but this dude has several and the entire lot is a solid several inches of leaves. I’m real tired of digging this shit out of my gutters and bagging up someone else’s stuff when it inevitably blows into my yard several lawn bags at a time. I’d have no yard work to do at this point in the year whatsoever if it wasn’t for this jerkoff and it’s not as simple as going next door to have a polite conversation. What’s the move here? I was thinking about calling a landscaping company to clean up and getting enough info on the dude to have them bill him but maybe we can get more creative. When the shed was still open I was going to start doing the cleanup and packing all the yard waste into the shed but that plan is bust now.",

        "text": " This was posted in JustNoMil, but apparently it didn't meet their guidelines and someone suggested I should post it here.\n\nTW: mention of religious trauma.\n\nI was looking at my wedding photos today and thought this community would appreciate my success. It's a bit long with all the background, so go make a cuppa and settle in.\n\nMy mil hated me from the moment we met. Think evangelical catholic meets goth athiest. I moved in with her son and had a baby without getting married and she truly believed I was the devil incarnate sent to draw her baby boy into the depths of hell. There followed years of petty microaggressions, a constant barrage of manipulation and guilt tripping and doing things like offering to watch the kids then pulling out 1/2 hour before, or buying the kids a puppy when we expressly said no and then blaming us when she had to take the poor thing back. She pushed over my motor bike, turned up at my work, tried to rearrange the furniture in our house and constantly talked about god and jesus in front of the kids and told them they were going to hell because they weren't baptised. I went VLC and things were quiet for a while.\n\nI never cared about getting married. I felt weddings were a waste of money. I'd rather have a boat or a new motorbike, but it was important to hubby, so I agreed, on the condition that it was not a church wedding. Apart from the generally problematic nature of the church, I experienced religious trauma growing up and I wasn't prepared to compromise. Hubby agreed and we started planning.\n\nTwo days after we announced our engagement (to much wailing, gnashing of teeth and general dismay), a priest arrived on our doorstep. He had been sent by MIL to schedule a date for our wedding and book us in for premarital counselling. I was very nice to him (after all, my issue was with the institution, not this poor guy) and thanked him for coming and told him we wouldn't be requiring any catholic services for the wedding. He looked sad and expressed he was a bit nervous to let MIL know. I offered him coffee and sympathy and that was the start of an unlikely friendship.\n\nI was fairly annoyed by this stunt. I talked to my hubby, who at that time was so far in the FOG that he couldn't see a hand in front of his face. He didn't see the big deal and asked me to just let it go. I thought about it for a day, then told him no. We had to address this immediately or it would escalate. I understood that he loved his mum and sisters, but that their obvious contempt for me was a problem. I don't like ultimatums, but by this point I'd been putting up with it for about 6 years. I laid it out. We address it now, or no wedding.\n\nIt went about as well as you'd expect. We visited and hubby tried to talk to her about how inappropriate her actions were. She screamed at him and cried, and then his sisters started on us both. Standing there, watching my hubby's heart break, my filter broke. I told them to stop, very loudly. Then, I told them that they were behaving like toddlers, that I was embarrassed by their antics and to consider this their first and only warning. If they tried anything like that again, or treated us with anything other than kindness and respect, not only would I cancel the wedding, I would tell their priest and all their friends about their disgusting behaviour. If they wanted to be part of the planning, I would welcome their participation but that Hubby and I had the final say. MIL tried to speak, but I shushed her like Dr Evil shushing Scott and we left.\n\nHubby was distraught and I felt bad for him, but we got into couple's counselling and things got better.\n\nMeanwhile MIL and the SILS seemed to have taken things on board and were maintaining a frosty civility (although I was banned from their house because I was scary. )\n\nFast forward about 12 months. Time for dress shopping. Ye gods, I HATED the idea of a wedding dress. I hate pale colours. I hate dressing up. I hate dresses. Just everything about the idea made me want to fake a coma to get out of it, but I'd promised my own very JYmum and brother that we could do this together. So Mum, Mil, Sil x 3, brother and his wife all traipsed along with me to marvel at the sight of me in a dress. And it wasn't a bad day. The IL's behaved and I found a dress that I didn't hate as much as the others. I paid for it and we left.\n\nThe next day, I got a call from the shop. MIL and the SIL's had ordered themselves THE EXACT SAME DRESS AS ME!\n\nI told hubby and he didn't really believe it I laughed about it for a bit, went back to the shop and ordered a new dress. This one was dark purple with black trim. And then I had The Idea. I don't have a lot of female friends. But all my male friends have wives who had wedding dresses. And sometimes they say they feel sad that they spent all that money on a dress that they'll never wear again. I talked to hubby and he agreed, so the invitations went out and every person who had ever worn a wedding dress was invited to wear it to our wedding.\n\nMil and the Sils got different invitation that specifically asked that they not wear white. Dress code was stated as \"whatever you're comfortable in.\"\n\nI wasn't there for the initial confusion that swiftly turned to rage, but my mum and brother gleefully recounted the story later. All four of them turned up in their beautiful white dresses with their beautiful make up and hair - and were completely absorbed by the rest of the crowd. They didn't stand out. They looked exactly like everyone else. Except for my mum and brother's wife, who wore purple like me. They weren't going to ruin my day by upstaging me. My hubby, who up to that point really didn't think they would do something so vile, turned to stone that day. They had finally shown the depths that they would sink to and the last of the FOG was swept away.\n\nI turned up in the side car of a Harley (I did experiment with riding in the dress but it didn't end so well and the shop had to make a few emergency repairs the week before) and I walked down the aisle to the Imperial March by myself. My brother was my maid of honour and his wife was my hubby's best man.\n\nRemember the priest? Well, he wasn't allowed to officiate outside a church as a priest, so he was our MC. This was the icing on the cake, because I saw MILs face light up when she saw him... until he introduced the marriage celebrant and handed her the microphone. We had a pagan handfasting, jumped over a broomstick and walked back down the aisle to \"Sweet child o' mine\" while our two kids played air guitar and danced ahead of us... and ignored MIL and the SILs when they tried to get them to go over there.\n\nI came face to face with my MIL at the door. She was incandescent with rage. She went to speak, but my hubby stepped forward...and he shushed her! Right in front of everyone! It was glorious.\n\nShe didn't speak to either of us for the rest of the night. She didn't speak to us for nearly a month. And then she called one day to ask to see the kids as if nothing had happened. So Iet it go, because my husband and I had Won. But every now and then I wear the purple dress when I know she'll be at an event. Because I'm petty like that.",

This eventually lead to B asking for gift cards and to use a tv streaming service my sister had been path for and using herself.\n\nWell, the last straw came when B asked my older sis for her phone carrier and banking account info. This was when big sis realized that B was just using her and was most likely not a real friend. So last month, I asked my sister if she wanted me to help her get some petty revenge on B. I told her if she still had B’s iCloud/cell I could sign her up for spam, newsletters, alerts, etc. for leading her on. Big sis liked the idea and gave me B’s email, knowing I had the time, means, and motive to be petty for her.\n\nLast I heard, B is still recieving spam mail up to her eyeballs, and may have gotten a video call via FaceTime from some dude wanting to marry her!\n\nIn case you're wondering, they didn't get her mobile carrier or bank account info. \n\nTL;DR\nSome idiot makes the mistake of using their own email to scam an autistic woman that has a petty younger sister and gets junk mail for days.",

        "text": "So about a year ago I was getting some branches trimmed on a big evergreen tree in my backyard. The arborist told me I needed to have my power line and internet line disconnected so it wouldn’t be hit by falling branches. \n\n\nI called the electrical company and they agreed to be out at 8:00 AM on the day of service. Easy.\n\n\nThen I called the internet provider. I explained the situation and they transferred me. \n\n“Hello, I’d like to schedule someone to disconnect my internet for tree trimming.” \n“Oh we don’t offer that. Let me transfer you.” \n\n\nI am not exaggerating when I say I was transferred around different departments for 2 hours. I kept getting transferred back to people I had previously talked to, but everyone seemed equally appalled by my request. I would explain “disconnect the internet cable so the tree branches don’t fall on it.” But it was like I was speaking a foreign language.\n\n\nFINALLY I reach someone on the phone who offers a solution.\n\n“Sure thing I can send someone out, it’s $150 to send someone out and then you pay per hour.” The person on the phone explained. \n“You’re kidding, I have to pay for them to come disconnect the line, will they come back for free?”\n“It will be $150 for each time someone comes out plus 100 for each hour.” I was beyond frustrated at this point so of course I didn’t schedule anyone to come out.\n\n\nThe morning of the tree trimming I was out on a ladder with rubber gloves and a pair of scissors ready to cut the internet line. \n\nLuckily right then the reliable electrical folks should up to disconnect the power. \n“While you’re up there can you disconnect the internet?” I asked. \n“Are you sure?” The electrical guy asked, looking concerned. I looked pretty fucking determined at this point being on a ladder and all. So the electrical guy did me a solid and cut the cable. \n\nThe tree guys came and went.\n\n\nThe next day I called the internet provider again, saying that my internet stopped working and I had no idea why. Then I went to work.\n\nThe internet repair guy got sent to my house for free and then called me pissed off. “Who cut your tree” he asked, “they cut our wire! This is a ton of work to fix so I’m going to charge them for it!”\n\nI told him it definitely wasn’t the tree guys as they had come a week prior and my internet had JUST stopped working. \n\n\nIt ended up taking him 5 hours to fix. The repair guy was bitching that if the internet had just been disconnected it would have been an easy reconnection job, but now he had to wire down the road to their main fiber line. Too bad for the internet provider. I’m just glad it was all free.",

        "text": "My (50M) girlfriend (33F) and I, have been seeing one another for 9 months now.  She stays over a couple of nights per week, as she did last night.  \n\nA couple of weeks ago, she was pulled over for expired tags and inspection on her car, and of course it was towed to impound.  \n\nI had loaned her money at the beginning of Oct to get her tags and inspection, but she clearly used it for something else. After me getting it out of impound, she still  didn't get the tags and was pulled over again this last weekend.  \n\nLast night she asked to borrow $800 to once again get her car out of impound, and I told her that I couldn't do it.  I explained that I budget for a reason, and I had already helped her once - she was gonna have to figure it out.  \n\nThis resulted in her getting a little surly for the rest of the evening, but I refused to give in.  \n\nI went to bed around 9pm, and shortly after she came in, showered and got in bed. \n\nI woke up a little before 2am to use the bathroom and noticed she wasn't in bed, so I walked into the kitchen where I found her sitting at the breakfast table with my laptop open. This isn't a big deal. She uses it often.  \n\nWhat was a big deal, was that she had my banking website open to my account.  (Saved password)\n\nWhen I asked her what the hell she was doing, she slammed the lid, and knowing she was caught; started berating me about how I could afford to help her and calling me a liar, as if I were the villain in this scenario. \n\nI told her calmly: \"I need you to get dressed, grab your things, and I'll get you an Uber home.\"\n\nThis sent her into an impressive run up and down the emotional spectrum, ending in her picking up a collectible baseball and throwing it - breaking a photo of my late son. She stopped immediately and began apologizing because she knew she'd fucked up. \n\nI grabbed her purse and bag, set them outside on the porch and told her to wait outside for her ride.  \n\nI ordered the Uber, and instead of clicking on her new address, I clicked on her old one 20+ miles across town.  \n\nAfter she was gone, I made coffee and began getting ready for work, when I found her phone still plugged in beside the bed. \n\nI dropped it off at an AT&amp;T store as a found phone during lunch.  \n\nI've been getting a lot of calls and texts from several different numbers today (her) and I keep blocking them. \n\nThe bad part is, I was starting to feel bad about refusing her request and was figuring I'd probably help her get her car again.",

        "text": "This JUST happened. In fact I am still a little pumped of adrenaline (Off such a little act, WHAT a rush).\n\nSo I live on a street connected to an Elementary School. Other residence including myself have issues on weekdays around 3:30pm that parents will be parked all along our street to go pick up their kids from the school at the end of it. There is no problem with that as I expect it.\n\nWe have a guy named Terry on our street. Terry had left all the neighbors a business card saying that if ANY people block their driveway to call him immediately and he would tow then RIGHT AWAY. He is basically on standby from 2:00pm-4:00pm in our neighborhood. I Never had a chance to use this card yet.\n\nThe only issue for me is that I finish work at 2:00pm and I go get groceries and usually end up home around 3:30pm. A FEW times now I have come home to park in my Driveway and there is a vehicle completely blocking me. AKA instead of parking on the curb they will park at the end of my driveway and make it unable for me to park in. So I have to ask the owners to move.\n\nToday specifically, there was an old Dodge Minivan block my driveway. When I got out of my car to knock on the tinted window I realized no one was inside. I thought maybe they are napping in the back while they wait well NOPE. No one was in the vehicle. I couldn't get into my Driveway. This is specifically annoying because the curb behind and in front of him were both vacant (Maybe they weren't vacant when he parked there.\n\nSo I got the card out of my Glove Compartment and called Terry. I gave him my house number and in less than 5 Minute he had that bad boi towed out of there. So what happened next? I decided to start cleaning my car on my driveway until the owner came by. My first plan was to tell the owner that he/she had blocked the driveway and I had it towed. But as I was outside cleaning my car (it's 22 degree outside in November). Don't ask how Canadian weather works.\n\nI saw him coming back with his son. He looked incredibly confused as I was cleaning my car. I noticed him and didn't say anything as he was on his phone. So he actually came to me really upset. He said \"Hey PAL, have you seen my van, are you that much of a fucking asshole to call it for a tow when I was gone 3 minutes?\" So my plan changed. I said \"Wait, what van? And I decided to play dumb. Well about an hour later he rang my doorbell and asked for details. I told him to \"Fuck off\". and came here to write this.\n\nTerry is back in his driveway with his tow truck though and I plan on giving him a 6-pack of beer for helping me.\n\nTL;DR Some rando parked his van to block my driveway, I got it towed and played like I had never seen it.",

She denied every doing it and claimed she only used chopsticks (if anything). This contradicted me seeing my silverware drying on the silverware rack routinely when she got home.\n\nFast forward a couple of months later, my forks actually went missing, completely. It took me some time to notice, but I had one large fork, out of the original 6, brand new, pretty nice forks that came with the set. I asked her about it, she denied it, claimed she was offended. She said she used to take forks to work but after our talk a few months ago she stopped.\n\nSo she contradicted her initial statement that she never took the silverware. She also showed disregard for my property after completely finishing several of my items in the cupboard and essentially stealing drinks from the fridge leaving me with like half an ounce (just enough to not quench the thirst). So basically I had her pegged.\n\nShe doubled down and basically acted \"disappointed\" I thought it was her. She went out and bought a 4 person set of silverware, which I insisted she keep in a separate drawer from mine. Then I started thinking... how is she going to basically steal my stuff and somehow, miraculously, end up with a shining new silverware set while I am stuck in this position? Nah, it's not going down like that.\n\nSo the night she took that set put it in her drawer, I went in and took one of her big forks, leaving her now with only three. Now she can know that I know it was her, and she won't have a complete set.",

I thought maybe i did something wrong like i might have said something bad without meaning it and i wanted to clear everything out. But i was already thinking of leaving him for some reasons. (He still talks to his ex gf who was stalking me and begging him to leave me, i met his family once after begging him for months, he was scared to show our relationship on social medias, i never met his friends and i felt like he wasn’t really caring about my feelings.) \n\n\nSo a month before he was leaving me because mentally he wasnt ok and his reflex is to cut off people he love but i stayed around for him and we got back together a week later. Since we got back he was weird. When we were on break the only thing he asked me was ‘’what do i do if i want sex? Can we see each other?’’ And i told him no. But since that it was weird. He came over we had sex and he would find excuses to leave. Thats why i was thinking of leaving him. When he left me out of the blue, he said i was only thinking about me, i was needy, i was not trusting him enough, etc. But after talking about this to friends and my mom, i realized i wasnt so needy and all. \n\nMy revenge. He told me ‘’im not the prince charles i cant forgive everything’’ i said well go fick yourself royally. A while later i showed his birthday gift in a picture with the long poem i wrote. I showed him the return sticker for the gift i ordered and showed him the refund and the sephora order of the same price. I told him, you hated makeup so bad now your gift funded more makeup, happy birthday and go fuck yourself with a smiling picture of me. He was mad and blocked me. Never heard from him since, and im happier than ever because for the first time a breakup wasnt making me cry.🥰",

I parked there again a few weeks later and they thought the proper response was to rinse my car off. Yes, they hosed my car off.

Since clearly this isn’t enough time to get their hose out, the new response is 2 pull their BMW or Mercedes out of their garage and park in the street to “block” me. I won’t park there for a few days then will do so randomly for a few minutes. Triggers them moving their car without fail.",

Our relationship is so bad (not only mine but with the whole family) that even while living in the same house, I never talk to or acknowledge his existence. He normally stays out all the time and never much interact with our other siblings (something I'm grateful for). We have a great relationship between the rest of us and so many disciplines, so whatever someone put in the fridge never get touched with no permission of the owner and we kept that way for all our life. Till he starts breaking that rule recently. I kept noticing more of my food/drinks disappear alongside ingredients I buy for my baking hobby. We all leave house so mostly either him or my little brother are the most susceptible, but he also goes to college so it's always him the one idling at home. I talked to my mother about how he starts pissing me off these days, she calmed me down telling me she'll check it. He kept making trouble for my lil sister so I told him not to talk to her in a mean way again or he will literally have it from me. He kept pushing my buttons lately.\n\nThe last straw was when yesterday, I had friends over and one of my friends was wearing some nice crocs she bought recently. When leaving she couldn't find it and he was the only one who left after they came. Called him and asked him if he wore them and he said yes and that he wasn't somewhere close, asked him how he dared to take guest's stuff and he blatantly said that I should have taken care of the guest's stuff if I was so hung on it and cut the call. I was literally livid.\n\nDude had it coming, and really bad.\n\nNext morning, before I go to work, I took his phone (One I bought him from my first salary cause mom asked me) while he was sleeping, took a scissors and broke the charger jack so he can't plug in for charge and the earphone jack.\n\nSince I wasn't here the whole day, my little sister made it her mission to unplug his phone and hide away his charger whenever she could that if HE COULD EVEN PLUG THE CHARGER IN. MUAHAHAHA.\n\nTold dad on him last night and my lovely dad even told him that if he did get himself noticed by ne again or talked to younger sister he wil literally kick him out. (Dad isn't even joking, he had kicked him out lots of time and even took him to prison for doing drugs and stealing from my friends phones, money etc... when they came for visit).\n\nCould have ignored him if he didn't seek my attention by pissing me off.",

Think- one common American name and one ethnic name (ie- Michael versus Michelangelo).  My mom told me my name was really my grandmother’s name- whom I adore, so I believed it completely.\n\nSo, when I turned 18, she couldn’t find the birth certificate with my “real” name, but I started changing everything over (social security card, bank account, college registration- My bachelor’s degree has my “real name” on it). Keep in mind- this was pre- 9/11, when this was (apparently) possible without documentation of any kind. After a few years, my grandmother told me my mother was lying because my dad named me (acrimonious relationship and divorce). I eventually had everything changed back to my Americanized (aka my real, real name), except for that darn Bachelor’s degree.\n\nFast forward to this summer and my mom shows me a birthday card from a boutique she frequents and they address her by her first and middle name (think something like Mary Ann). \n\nMe: that’s nice of them! Did they use your name from your credit card?\nMom: no. That’s my name. I’m Mary Ann.\nMe: right, I realize that- but you only go by Mary. \nMom: no- my father always called me Mary Ann. Let me call my sister- she’ll tell you!\nGets my aunt on the phone, who is enjoying her happy hour. My aunt says- of course your name is Mary Ann! You’re Mary Ann, I’m Carol Ann, and Sarah is Sarah Ann! (All the sisters)\n\nMe: right, Aunt Carol Ann (the name she has always gone by), but is Mary’s full first name Mary Ann? Or is it her first and middle name?\nAunt CA- oh! It’s her first and middle names!\nMe: Thank you! (Gives pointed side eye to my mom)\n\nMy mom continues this ridiculous  argument with me, involving other people, until I call it a day and say I’m going home.\n\nCue Petty Betty’s arrival.\n\nThis morning I was out with my sister and mom for a cup of coffee. I saw someone I know and they came over to the table. I started introductions-\nMe: Have you met my mom?\nAmy: No, I haven’t.\nMe: Mom, this is Amy. Amy, this is my mom, Mary Ann. \n\nMy mom is ‘selectively’ hard of hearing and somehow doesn’t catch what I say. My sister does hear, who is aware of everything. She proceeds to make big round eyes at me and tries hard to not laugh.\n\nI also introduced her like this last Wednesday at a football game. Let’s just say that mom is going to be hearing a lot of ‘Hi, Mary Ann!’ for the foreseeable future.",

        "text": "\n\nOk so real quick up top if this doesn’t count as Petty Revenge I apologize. If you know a community that would take this story let me know. \n\nThis just happened recently my refrigerator compressor (the part that’s pumps cooling fluid to make the fridge cold) broke down and it would cost $2500 just to get a new one. So my parents said yep we’re getting a new fridge. \n\nThe first place they went to was Best Buy and we’re able to find a new fridge at a pretty decent price they said it would be ready to deliver by Wednesday this week. Perfect!!! Or so we thought. \n\nThe next day we get a call that the fridge we were supposed to get hasn’t even arrived at the store yet and won’t be here for a few weeks so naturally we were very mad. My dad immediately went to Find another fridge for sale at a different store. This time he went to Lowes and he found another one with a better price than the one before and lowes offers free delivery and will be here by Friday this week. My dad bought the fridge but my mom wanted to double check Best By again (despite what happened) to see if she could get a lower price so they went back and sure enough nothing. \n\nNow here’s the part where we got some petty revenge on best buy for lying: \n\nAs they were leaving a different couple was already arguing with a manager for (ironically enough) the delivery time for a new fridge. The manager said that they won’t get there new fridge until after Christmas this year. (Yes I am serious) My dad Happily Chimed in on the conversation and told the couple that lowes can deliver a new fridge for a lower price in 2 days. \n\nIt should go without saying that the couple and a few other customers followed my parents out of the store. \n\nMoral of the story: don’t lie to your customers it’s bad for business.",

        "text": "When I was 18 and had my first apartment, a new neighbor asked me for a ride to the bigbox department store across town.  This was only my second time meeting her, but she was hugely pregnant, her boyfriend was at work, it was my day off, and I needed a few things, so I agreed.\n\nBefore we got there, she asked me to pull into a store that I rarely went to on my own. It's a franchise store (my mom very, very slightly knew the owner) that specializes in selling greeting cards but also had expensive greeting cards and chocolate.  (Think \\*allmark)\n\nIt was right on the way, so I said sure, even though I didn't like this chain.  I'm not a card person or a high-price chocolate person.  We split up and I look at a few of the motivational books (Chicken Soup stories) while she browses.  \n\nI notice an employee straightening things at the other end of the row and I think nothing of it.\n\nA few minutes later, two police officers enter and I think nothing of it.  Absolutely oblivious. \n\nA little while later, the woman I was with said she was ready to go and we leave.  The officers stop us in the parking lot and an employee steps out.  The office says, \"Which one was shoplifting?\"  \n\nI was stunned....and obviously they pointed at my new neighbor.  She gets handcuffed, they read the little message and put here in the back of the car.  Then the officer said, \"What about her?\" (pointing at me)\n\n\"As far as we could tell, she didn't shoplift anything,\" the employee said.  \n\nI turned out my pockets, revealing a small wallet and keys.  \"I didn't take anything. I just met that woman a few days ago when we moved into the same apartment rental place.  She asked for a ride to buy groceries and on the way, suggested we stop.  I don't like even cards.\"  (yes, I was rambling)\n\nThe officer sent me on my way and I felt so embarrassed. I'd never had an encounter with the police before.  \n\nThey moved out a few weeks later because they couldn't pay the rent.  I didn't expect to ever see her again.\n\nI was an assistant manager at fast food place a few months later and this woman shows up for a job interview with the manager. We paid a dollar an hour above minimum wage, offered minimal benefits (compared to no benefits, which most fast food places did), regular scheduling, and free meals.  Whether you were a high school dropout or a college student, this job wasn't terrible.  It was a step above the place with the golden arches.\n\nNaturally, I pulled the manager aside and told him about this lady.  The manager wrote  REJECT on the top of the application and I knew she'd get a letter in a few days telling her she didn't get the job.  I did this partly because I was upset she created an unnecessary police encounter to steal knickknacks. Not food, not diapers, not a maternity shirt. Little overpriced things you put on your shelves.  I don't even remember what they were, but trinkets.  The other reason was I liked the owners of the place I worked, and I didn't want them to be stolen from.",

The issue was that my manager had just lost a family member last week, with the funeral being this Friday.\n\nI was hesitant to resign because of this, wondering if I should wait till after the funeral. Eventually I decided to resign anyways as even a week after things weren't going to be much better.\n\nSo I resigned with my manager and she looked utterly defeated, they don't have the budget to try to counter offer, and all the plans for next year where based on my being with the company. \n\nThe rest of the week she had been noticeably quiet, and when someone asked if she was OK she told them about my resignation and how she doesn't know how they will get through the next year. \n\nA colleague approached me and said I was really cold doing this on the week of the funeral, instead of taking others into consideration, especially since this woman was like a mentor to me.\n\nNow I'm feeling like I was the asshole because I didn't try to negotiate with my new work on my start date and caused my manager more stress after she only just lost her mum.\n\nTL;DR I quit on the same week as my managers mum's funeral. My manager is now stressed about the ruined plans of next year and colleagues have told me I'm cruel for not taking in my boss or team into consideration. AITA?",

        "text": "Long ago, before the days when everybody had a smart phone and the Internet in their pocket, portable news and entertainment was delivered via an analog device known as a daily newspaper.\n\nDo you want to know what is happening in the world so you don't look ignorant when your friends are talking abut current events? - It's in the newspaper.\n\nDo you want to know when your favorite sports team is playing their next match, so you can watch it? - That is in the paper too.\n\nDo you want to know what movies are playing at the local theater?  What band is playing at the local venue? - Newspaper.\n\nDo want a coupon for a really good price at the local grocery store, but it's good for one week only? - Newspaper again.\n\nI lived in an apartment and paid to have the local morning newspaper delivered to my front door.  I would grab my newspaper when I left for work in the morning, and read it on my long commute to and from work that day.  (Note: Public transit - I was not reading while driving.)\n\nThe people who lived in the apartment next to mine were apparently unencumbered by society rules such as \"Not taking sh\\*t that doesn't belong to you\".  They began stealing my paper each morning before I picked it up myself.  Not wanting to be bored on my daily commute, I had to buy a replacement at the newsstand.  The thefts continued daily, until I hatched my petty plan.\n\n On Monday, at 3am when my newspaper was delivered, I got up to retrieve today's paper and replaced it with last week's Monday paper.  I went back to sleep and woke up at my normal time.  When I left for work, my newspaper had been stolen again, as usual.  I repeated this each morning, replacing that day's paper with a one-week-old paper.\n\nIt took about three weeks before the neighbors realized they were reading old news and the thefts stopped.\n\ntldr: Neighbor steals morning newspaper.  OP gets up early and replaces current newspaper with a week-old newspaper, which is then stolen.",

My parents had a really nice time share that they used quite a bit , but now my dad had died my mum had no wish to keep it so offered it to me - i had no wish to use it so she offered it to \"S\"  \n\nS - took the  time share as it was closer to where her parents lived and they would make good use of it - it was all legally signed over to her etc \n\nanyways , about 6 months later me and S had a bit of a messy break up and about a year later one of our mutual friends was telling me S was trying to sell the timeshare for £20,000 - this caused a row between S and our mutual friend as she argued that any money made from selling the time share should be given to my mother . \n\ni didnt really care and forgot all about it - fast foreward to my mum dying 10 years ago - about 2 weeks after her death i get a message from S on facebook but under her new married name askig how i was and telling me  that her and her husband  have been using it every year but now they have no further use for it and would like to offer it back to me - i highlighted how its ironic she got in touch now as my mum had only just died (i found out later she found out from a friend of ours )  - she then highlighted that my mum would definitely  have wanted me to have it back as part of my inheritance \n\nSo i decided to do some digging to find out why she was so keen for us to have it . It turned out : \n\n1/the annual fee had risen from £250 a year to £650 a year \n2/ they are impossible to sell - i looked on ebay and people were trying to sell timeshares from this complex for £0.01 they were that desperate to get out the contract \n3/ a lot of the amenities that were in the timeshare complex were now run down and from reading some of the reviews, the whole complex seemed to be poorly managed \n(i also found out she had been trying to sell it for years but with no luck) \n\nso i let her know that i was very grateful for her offer but had no interest in taking it back and she was welcome to keep it - she sent about 10 messages over the next couple of weeks trying to guilt trip me and even contacted my sister as well trying to convince her to take it back but we both politely declined and shes now stuck with the place for life and the annual fee which rises every year ......",

Despite me and a few others behind her asking her if she wants assistance and leaning over to grab the stamp, the old lady refuses everyone's help. She stares at it for a second, slowly leans over to pick the stamp off of the floor, and leaves her quarter piece on the floor in its place.

        "text": "I (currently 19 f, 18 at the time) had this high school bully that we will call Ella (also 18 F). Ella is the definition of the stereotypical mean girl that you see in high school movies with a rich daddy and a b*tchy attitude. I have never done anything to this girl, but from the moment she met me, she decided she just simply hated everything about me. Whenever she got the chance she would tease me, whisper to her friends and laugh at me, give me dirty looks, etc. You get the vibe if you’ve ever met anyone like this. This had been going on from the time I was a freshman, and to be completely honest, I didn’t let her get to me too much. I’m a goth lesbian who lives in the Bible Belt so I’ve been through worse, but I obviously developed a pretty equal distain for her. Now when I became a senior, my best friend bought a piercing kit (we were all 18 don’t come for us). My bestie, my gf, and I, all decided we were going to pierce each other’s nipples. During this process, it was discovered that I apparently have a natural talent for piercing nipples. This is when things get interesting. Somehow or another, Ella gets word of my newly discovered “talent” and decides she needs her nipples pierced. So now that I have a skill that Ella wants to use, suddenly, she starts treating me like an old friend. “Hey girlll how’ve you been? It’s been too long!” You get it. Finally, she asks the question I knew was coming: “would you be willing to pierce my nips for me, girlie?” Which is when I set my plan into motion. “Yaaaasss girlie! Of course boo! Come over this weekend and I’ve gotchu!” Oh I was gonna pierce her nipples alright, but I was going to make this experience as unpleasant as humanly possible. The day arrives and Ella comes over, my best friend is there with her piercing kit, and I am ready to go. So I have her lay down, and we’re getting ready for the piercing. I’ve got my clamp on her nipple, she’s holding her titty, and I’ve got my dry needle lined up with the clamp. If you don’t know much about piercings, you may not know that especially for nipples, they are supposed to be done with a lubricated needle. This reduces pain and makes the process of the needle going through the skin much easier. Oh well!! So I ask her if she’s ready. She’s ready. I’m about to stick the needle in. Then, with the biggest smile on my face, I say “Hey Ella, you remember how you used to be such a b*tch to me all the time? How you always used to make fun of me and laugh with your friends? Remember how you used to look at me like you look at the gum on the bottom of your brand new shoes daddy just bought you?” I see the anxiety fill her face and she tries to respond “yeah well..” but I didn’t let her. “Oh well! Let’s do this!” And I stab the needle through. She screams, I put the jewelry in. I clamp the second nipple and smile at her. “Ready?” I didn’t give her time to respond before I shoved the needle through a second time. Now this part wasn’t on purpose, but I still don’t feel bad about it. Ella has slightly odd anatomy on the second nipple. She has hard bumps that make it extra difficult for a needle to go through, and I was using a dry one. This second piercing was a SLOW process of her screaming her fucking head off while I’m trying to push the needle through. Eventually i got it through, but it was ROUGH. Oh well. I had fun. The moral of this story is, don’t ask the girl you bullied for four years to give you free nipple piercings unless you want that shit to hurt way more than it needs to. And “Ella,” if you ever see this, at least I pierced them straight :)",

However, the computer he was requesting help with was his own personal computer. Obviously, we don't have any access or control over random people's computers. I have zero way I can help him without the admin account, and he said he doesn't know the account.\n\nThe software was some kind of parental management software that restricts him from doing things. This guy is in his early 20s. I know this because we can see the details of the people that call us on our system. So... kind of hilarious, he has this software installed.\n\nAnyway, after I tell him that I cannot help him, he ends up telling me that I work for a trash company and that I should kill myself.\n\nI don't even respond, and he hangs up the phone.\n\nNow... obviously the calls are recorded, and I'm not going to just ignore what just happened.\n\nI tell my manager the story.\n\nHe listens to the phone call.\n\nMy manager then calls the liaison for the company he called from. They find out that this guy is an intern at the company. He now no longer works for the company. During the call, they decide to get the CEO on the phone and tell him what happened.\n\nShortly after that call, the CEO lets us know that he called the university that the guy is currently going to. The University has now dropped him from all his classes.\n\nThis guy has now lost his intern job, and lost his placement in University, all because he told me to kill myself on the phone.",

Kind of rude, talked down to me, constantly was comparing me to other girls. Got it, bro. \n\nI could tell he was into me and wanted to take things further (we had only kissed, not fully hooked up yet, but he was hinting towards sleepovers etc)... I knew I needed to end it and wanted to give him a taste of his own medicine, so I hit him with the \"I think we're better off as friends.\" DEJA VU MOTHERFUCKER.

Start paying for his rent, utilities, entertainment etc. I'm an independent self made woman who can afford it, and thought if your partner is down you hel them right? \n\n1 year into the relationship find out he has been cheating on me with multiple women and taking money from them all, and is living at a friend's house and pays no rent. When I confronted him and he blocked and ghosted me without a reply, ended up living with one of the girls telling her she was the one he loved and me and the other girls were mistakes. \n\nI think, huh, I get no explanation or apology. Well okay I'll fuck up what you love most. Contacted a the people in the guild who had also become my friends and ended up becoming closer to me because of my personality, and also because my ex had gotten a toxic attitude problem where he thought he was better than them all. Every single person leaves from the guild and blocks him, called his best friends (a couple) told them what he did and they blocked him and have cut ties. \n\nHis #1 Ranked guild falls to #10,000+, just one of the masses.

Find out later he made a fake profile pretending to be someone else and is flirting with other women now, while still living with the girl because he still has no job and she is his meal ticket.\n\nMoral: Cheaters never change, get your revenge.

As a side note, Maureen has her own grapes, but she likes to use our landlord's grapes too because previous tenants did not.\n\nEvery FUCKING year, it's a battle to make Maureen wait to pick grapes so we can pick a share. The landlord has been clear that we get first dibs on the grapes because we're his actual tenants. We always leave her at least a row (one of four). Every year, she tries to be a sneaky lil bitch and get the grapes. But this year was the worst.\n\nMy mom told Maureen that she was going to pick the grapes this weekend. Well, this weekend came and went without being able to pick grapes; my mom's helper crew got sick, my dad was recovering from major surgery, and she couldn't find the time or energy. Maureen's crotchety old ass calls to inform my mom that she is coming tomorrow to pick all the grapes we didn't. My mom asked her to please wait a few more days as her husband (my dad) has cancer and her helpers were sick. \n\nMaureen's response: \"That's too bad. You had your chance. My family is coming tomorrow and we are picking the grapes.\" \n\nOf course my poor mom loses it at this point and begins screaming, \"SHAME ON YOUR MAUREEN! YOU CALL YOURSELF A CHRISTIAN!\" Maureen continues telling her she had her chance. \n\nSo my mom came in and told me this story. I said: \"Absolutely FUCKING not.\" We are staying up as late as needed to pick every single grape off the vines. Every single one.\n\nWe both called as many friends as we could. The troops are being gathered. We now have about 10 people to help us pick the grapes. We will pick every single grape so that when stupid Maureen and her stupid family show up, there will not be one little fruit left on the vine. \n\nALL NIGHTER FOR THE GRAPES",

My supervisor, P, was a nasty jealous ahole. One coworker, E, in another office was deaf (from 16 yo - so her speech was very normal), and while she had cochlear implants still had to do a lot of lip reading. P was fully aware of this. P's boss also made his high opinion of E well known which made P jealous.\n\nPreviously, I had overheard P telling others E was a racist snob since she didn't always acknowledge hellos. (E was white, P and others were black.) I butted in to say, \"no she can't hear if you speak from behind her or don't also catch her attention so she can lip read.\"\n\nSo one day, P leaves a voice message for E, which E returns but says she didn't catch everything said so needed it repeated. (P always used the speaker phone despite my desk being only 4ft from her, and I could hear everything.) Anyway, the call ends, P hangs up and then explodes. She's ranting about E being too stupid and entitled to even pay attention to a voice message. I remind P that she's deaf and voice mail can be problematic as she can't lip read to supplement. P says E shouldn't work if she can't hear. I loose it! I scream \"she is great at her job and this agency exists for the disabled for f*sakes.\" P says nothing - probably cause I had never even raised my voice or cursed in the office before.\n\nSo my petty revenge: I researched our archaic phone sets and covertly reset P's at the lowest volume possible. She was stupid and lazy meaning she never figured out what I did or the volume setting issue. She was so well liked that no one would help her figure it out either. I told her she must be becoming hard of hearing.",

I forgot how I met my roommate, but we hit it off and enjoyed our weird little sublet.\n\nTechnically it was an illegal sublet because it was government assisted apartment, and the lady renting it to us was charging market rates. I’m sure she was making a killing every month.\n\nOne day out of the blue, her daughter (18ish) shows up at the apartment and starts banging on the door tellling us she’s moving in. She has 3 large black garbage bags filled with all her stuff and dumped it in the living room. To say she came in hot is an understatement. She was talking about kicking us out and calling the police to evict us within the first 5 minutes of meeting her.\n\nMy roommate and I didn’t take her threats very seriously, but we did realize that she was going to make life as miserable as possible for us until we resolved the situation.\n\nIt all culminated about 3 days later with the crazy daughter and enabler mom (who tried to convex us to just let her live with us - in a 2 bedroom apt.) actually calling the cops. They showed up at our apartment, and my roommate called me freaking out, so I left work and we talked to the cops. It was clear from our demeanor (me and roomie) that we were not the problem. The mom and daughter were losing it, to the point one officer had to remove them from the “scene”. We played innocent and let them know that we were subletting the apartment. That got the officers attention. It also got the attention of one of the tenants who was on the board for the building, or at least some kind of tenant representative.\n\nRoomie and I agreed this was not a fight worth getting involved in, so we decided to move out. \n\nAfter securing a new place to stay and emptying out the apartment, it dawned on me….my industrial strength bedroom door had a lock on it, and through the conversations with tenant and daughter, it was clear they didn’t have a key. \n\nWe had some expired ground beef in the fridge, which gave me an idea. You can guess the rest. Opened the stinky, meaty goodness, plopped it in the middle of the room and locked the door.\n\nRelevant to the story; it was July and there was no AC (window unit in the room, which was off and they could not get to without knocking down the door.)\n\nI have no clue whatever happened to those people and their apartment, but every time I walked by it I smiled enjoyed my little piece of petty revenge.",

        "text": "This happened a long time ago and i was a teenager back then. I had a computer that i used to play games on (for one hour a day, that was the rule in our house). Everytime exams approached, my father used to take out the power cables from the computer and hide them. This one time he did the same and exams passed. I scored straight As. Pretty good score if i say so myself. He also seemed happy. So when the time came for me to ask for the power cables he didn't give them back. I don't know why. A couple of days later, i got really angry (i was angry teenager) and decided to get back at him. I went to his computer, opened up the case and disconnected the 24-pin cable on the mother board. That evening, when he came back from work, he couldn't turn the computer on. He called me and my sister (because in his mind we are more tech savy then he is). For a while i watched him fiddle around with the computer. After some time my heart melted seeing him distressed (he is best dad in the world) so i suggested to open up the case in case something is burned. So we opened up the case and i waited for him to see the disconnected 24-pin. He didn't notice it so i pointed it out saying \"is this supposed to be like this\". He said no and plugged it back in and the computer startes. \n\nI have never told him that i did that but i think he figured it out because he gave me my power cabled the next day. This revenge was so petty that even i could not see it through.",
