        "text": "Hi, experts, \n\nIn the following sentence, I would like to know the exact structure of \" American geologist Marie Tharp\". \n\n&gt;The field of geological oceanography owes much to American geologist Marie Tharp, a pioneering oceanographic cartographer whose detailed topographical maps of the ocean floor and its multiple rift valleys helped garner acceptance for the theories of plate tectonics and continental drift. \n\nOne view is to treat \"American geologist\" and \"Marie Tharp\" as appositives. We might claim that  \"American geologist\" renames or explains the noun  \"Marie Tharp\" and provides additional information about her profession. However, I am under the impression that, for appositives, we can remove one and still keep the sentence structure intact (even though its meaning may be unclear). \n\nWe cannot simply remove \"Marie Tharp\" because we end up with:\n\nThe field of geological oceanography owes much to American geologist. \n\nIt is no longer a grammatically valid sentence. There should be an article before \"American geologist\". For example, it might read:\n\nThe field of geological oceanography owes much to an American geologist. \n\nSo, maybe \"American geologist\" is not used as an appositive, but as an adjective. What is your opinion?\n\nThanks!",

I have created my own style guide that I'm using during the editing process, generally following the Chicago Manual of Style. However, I'm not happy with any solution I've come up with for numbers, particularly when describing acreages of land.\n\nCurrently, I am spelling out numbers up through ninety-nine, any large round numbers (such as twenty thousand), and any numbers that start a sentence. However, staying consistent on this practice sometimes seems strange. In one paragraph, I'll be discussing a \"fifty acre tract of land.\" Then in the next paragraph, referring to \"100 acre\" or \"150 acre\" parcels. Although I have a consistent rule, it doesn't **feel** consistent in practice. Then I have paragraphs like the following:\n\n\"Noticeably lacking in John’s Will is any disposition of land or slaves, even to his surviving widow. It is possible that he had already sold all of his land in Southampton County, Virginia by 1768. John Brewer received a grant of fifty acres in 1742 and then sold fifty acres in 1743. He purchased 110 acres in 1750 and sold those same 110 acres in 1752. He purchased 150 acres in 1753 and sold those same 150 acres in 1768. So for any land he acquired in Southampton County, we also have record of a sale.\"  \n\nI could use 50 in this paragraph for consistency, but then in the same section of the book describing the same tract of land, I have been using fifty. I have thought about using numbers for all acre references, but they look wrong to me for anything under 10. Maybe the solution is to just use words for anything under 10?

But does this sentence make sense or should I revise it?\n\n“What you lack in decorum is shared in education.”\n\nI know what I WANT it to mean, but I just can’t decide if it reads correctly. Should it be shared “in education” or “with education”, or should I rewrite the sentence entirely?\n\nNot going to get very far with my writing at this rate!",

        "text": " I have a huge pet peeve word that just makes me cringe every time I hear it; deplane. For me, every time I hear that word, it's worse than fingernails on a chalkboard.    \nSomehow, over the last 10 or 15 years, this has become the standard word that stewardesses use after landing and ask that you disembark or exit the aircraft. Deplane is not a real word. You are not removing a plane. It is not like when you debone a fish or chicken. It's not like when you degrease motor parts, you remove the grease. You do not deplane. That would imply that, somehow, I need to remove an airplane from myself, someone else or something. I can, however, very easily disembark, deboard or exit the aircraft.   ",
