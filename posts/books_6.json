        "text": "I just finished All Systems Red and have a quick question. Hoping someone will clarify a small issue for me. So, DeltFall has three SecUnits, one of which is killed at DeltFall base, and the other two of which are taken out by Murderbot And Mensah at DeltFall base but later revived by GrayCris.\n\nLater on, when they go to meet with GrayCris, Murderbot says it sees three humans and four SecUnits waiting for them. He extrapolates that there must be one more SecUnit at the base, and about 27 people, provided GrayCris has followed the protocol of one SecUnit per ten people. \n\nNow, here is where I am confused about what I know is a silly issue.\n\nIf two of those SecUnits are revived DeltFall units, that leaves two GrayCris units with the meeting party and the one suspected GrayCris unit back at the base.\n\nBut Murderbot and Mensah killed two GrayCris units at DeltFall base, so wouldn't that mean GrayCris had five GrayCris SecUnits, and so about fifty people, not thirty? In other words, the two units that got killed at DeltFall, the two units that are part of the meeting party along with the revived DeltFall units, and the one suspected GrayCris unit back at the base? \n\nI'm just super confused about that little reference and it's bothering me to no end. Anyone have an explanation?\n\nThanks! Loved the book!",

The clip had me tearing up instantly. So I got a free 7 day trial of apple tv to watch the full short, and ordered the book\n\nThe art in the book is really beautiful, as well as the font. You can even open the book up to a random page and get a great message. The story is short but each sentence written is so profoundly deep, and touching. I've been struggling with really bad self esteem and self worth pretty much since my son was born almost 2 years ago and the postpartum weight issues, pressuring myself as a parent, and just overall really not being kind to myself. Almost every page of this book makes me cry, and I plan on looking through it frequently. I really felt like the characters were talking directly to me. The author really has a way with words. \n\nSo if you want something quick and quite touching, please do yourself a favor and get the book, and watch the short if you are able. I'll finish the post with one of my favorite excerpts (though it's hard to pick just one): \"Being kind to yourself is one of the greatest kindnesses, said the mole\"",

Zuckerman, who‚Äôs generally seen as Roth‚Äôs stand-in, is very peripheral in the AP trilogy. \n\nBy contrast, the zuckerman trilogy focuses on zuckerman, who I have trouble appreciating ‚Äî he‚Äôs self-absorbed, stubborn, misogynistic, etc. I (like to think I) have no issue with flawed characters in fiction, and zuckerman is a useful vehicle for Roth to explore issues of aging, sickness, death, celebrity, family ties, and the writing process, and a lot of this material is thoughtful and poignant.\n\nBut zuckerman is such a reactive character, with the exceptions of writing carnosky and his very random plan to become a doctor. He seldom ventures into the world and parasitically feeds off the energy and experiences of others, which he uses as material for his stories. Roth and his character Zuckerman are very aware of these issues, to the point that other people in the books attack Zuckerberg for these reasons. \n\nBut I also think zuckerman has so little going on outside his interior emotional/intellectual life that he‚Äôs not a very engaging protagonist. That‚Äôs one of the main reasons I preferred the AP trilogy (where NZ is a background character) over the NZ trilogy, and maybe part of why I think most people see the AP trilogy as Roth‚Äôs magnum opus. \n\nIm not saying NZ trilogy is bad ‚Äî I thought it was very good, but NZ was very frustrating to be stuck with the whole series. Im curious how others feel about these 2 trilogies, and if anyone struggled with NZ too.  Thank you for any thoughts.",

I finally sat down and read it, and as usual with good books I neglect I kicked myself for putting it off when a thousand other distractions get in the way.\n\nWhat really stuck out to me from the story is that for all of Zoey's teardowns of the upper class' apathy, Molech is right about *her* (and her specifically, since in every other aspect he is scientifically designed to deserve to be shot with a railgun). Zoey inherits a billion dollar fortune, injects kindness and empathy whenever she's faced with the humanity of whoever's in front of her, but for all she says that the rich should do something when the time comes her master plan to save Squattersville is to leave like six guys with guns to protect them. They don't need a saviour, they need a society with rules and checklists that prevents human apathy from letting them fall through the cracks, and Will's speech about Arthur Livingstone feels like it'll ring true for Zoey as well; Arthur had a change of heart and wanted to make the world somehow better, but he only knew how to mete that out in ways that resulted in *himself* being at the steering wheel. \n\nI think it's a common power fantasy to inherit money and be unambiguously philanthropic and a lot of us have the shared consequence of knowing the value of money and thus have dreams for all the good we'd do, but that they're dreams lets us hide from the cold reality that the good we could perform is limited by our own ability to do it, and everything we miss is the endpoint of our own apathy and ignorance.\n\nZoey spends the whole story on the run from superpowered cyborg assassins with millions of people watching a live feed of her own explosive execution, what is she going to do with her fortune when things have cooled off? The second book is already out and the third releases next year, and my guess is that she doesn't quite literally cash in on all her big ideas.",

        "text": "I‚Äôm no stranger to famously long novels. I‚Äôve read In Search of Lost Time, Ulysses, War &amp; Peace, Infinite Jest, and 1Q84, among others. \n\nHowever, every time I try to embark on one I feel the hesitation of standing on the edge of a cliff before letting oneself go completely. It seems insurmountable, even though reading 3,600 pages across 10 novels is something we do without even thinking. It resembles the way that I can power through 6 20-minute episodes of TV but take pause before pressing play on a 2-hour movie. I was first turned on to Knausgaard by his Seasons books, which are collections of short stories with bite-sized musings centered on ordinary objects that are strange but unbearably compelling. Still, why read this 6-volume autobiographical novel about a Norwegian author? I‚Äôm not sure I could even name another Scandinavian writer. \n\nOne of the most compelling aspects of the book is that the subject matter is often so mundane, yet manages to be elevated in its lack of profundity. It lures us into a false sense of security, a warm blanket of familiarity, then transitions before our very eyes into an insight on the human condition which, at first, seems impossibly linked to the subject matter 3 pages ago, but is undeniable once consumed. \n\nKnausgaard bares his flesh and soul, airs out every bit of his (and his family‚Äôs) dirty laundry, and writes the way people don‚Äôt realize they think ‚Äî contrasted with the way they present themselves. He tears up social contracts and forces the reader to examine their own inauthenticity. He has no qualms with borrowing the title of his book from one of the most infamous pieces of writing in modern history; in fact he displays it proudly. \n\n*Potential spoilers on the novel‚Äôs meaning*\n\nIn my opinion, the central theme of the novel is deceit. At first, I felt as if Knausgaard was speaking directly to me, that he was explaining a phenomenon only the two of us shared. However, the genius of this slowly unfolds as he methodically exposes how self-centered we truly are, how blind we are to our commonalities, that all humans experience these struggles in their personal way but none are exempt. \n\nHitler believed in HIS struggle, that no one else could share it, and therefore elevated himself above others and saw no issue with tearing them down. The greatest trick we play on ourselves is trapping our thoughts within the confines of our own world and failing to grasp the significance, the pain, the joy, and the mundane of those around us.",

        "text": "I just finished reading Agatha Christie's original short story *Witness for the Prosecution*, having only watched the 1957 film many years ago. I love  the deliberate ambiguity that keeps readers wondering!\n\nIn  the original story, does Agatha Christie want us to believe that Leonard Vole actually did not know Romaine's full plan to appear as witness for the prosecution and fabricate the letters to \"Max\"? Of  course Leonard came home after killing Miss French and told Romaine everything, and knowing that Romaine was truly devoted to him, he expected her to support him and provide an alibi to get him acquitted. But did Leonard know the actual details and the nature of Romaine's grand scheme? Did the two of them plan the whole business with the letters together?\n\nOr was Leonard Vole himself surprised to hear that Romaine had apparently turned against him and was he genuinely fooled by the letters just as Mayherne the solicitor was? Perhaps Leonard never could have imagined Romaine would concoct such an elaborate and bold scheme to acquit him?  Maybe Leonard thought Romaine would just stick to the false alibi that Leonard came home before the murder occurred? Did Romaine really play a \"lone hand\" by keeping even her lover in the dark about her real master plan to save him? It's interesting that we only see Romaine's reaction at the very end, and not Leonard's reaction, so it feels deliberately  ambiguous.\n\n(Original short story-related answers only please! I know the film and play add another big twist to the ending, but I am not talking about those here.)",
