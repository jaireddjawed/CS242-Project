        "text": "I’ll be short and sweet as possible. My 16yo step daughter decided to stop seeing her father and I once she realized our supportive parenting relationship with her mom was helping her mom refrain from letting my step daughter wear her down and get consequences rescinded early. This went on for four fucking months. No contact from her, refusals to see us, straight up ghosted our asses. Finally mom agreed to giving her the choice to see us or lose all technology and extra curriculars. \nOnce she’s dropped off, the moment she enters our home she feigns a mental breakdown…Tearing up… shaking…. Overreactions to noises (like when the dog plops down). Unfortunately for her, she has a child therapist for a step-mom, and I’m not buying her act one bit. So I watch her body language and mannerisms while her dad keeps trying to talk to her. She refuses to say a word, continuing to play victim jerking her jaw and arms, tearing up with few tears falling, dry sniffling noises, etc. I notice she keeps randomly darting her eyes around, finally settling on recurring glances over to our stove. Now, we only have her for 3hrs before we have to return her, so I look around as well…. The wall clock batteries are low, so it’s way off and erratic. The microwave died so we junked it last week. The only clock she can see is our stove…. Counting down how much longer she has to wait us out with her silent treatment before she can go back home.\n\nSo I walked over, threw garlic in the oven and set the timer for 6hrs and 37 minutes, making sure to change the timer every so often.\n\nTry to make us suffer your silent treatment…. You get to suffer how differently you experience time when stressed and waiting. \n\nShe cracked in less than 20 minutes.",

        "text": "AITJ for the flock of flamingos now scattered in my neighborhood.\n\nOk so this past summer I went to Disney for 2 weeks and forgot to give my landscaper a code to open my front gate. This house and property is incredibly old and has a stone wall around it with a huge wrought iron gate at the entrance. We had the gate upgraded to be mechanically opened and closed,. And that’s where the problem lies. The new mechanism locks the gate closed and you need a code if you don’t have a opener. We usually leave the gate open during the day and close it at night. Well when we left for our vacation we set the gate to remain closed during the day. Our landscapers called us and we didn’t get the message. When we got back I had a notice from the town that my lawn was out of code as they are very strict about the “no more than 5 inches” rule. I just paid the fine and had the landscapers mow the yard and clean up some of the woods in the back so my kids wouldn’t get hurt on the tree that fell. \n\nWell one of my neighbors had an issue with the noise. The landscapers needed some pretty heavy equipment to get the tree out. They called code enforcement and when they showed up the landscapers had a brief chat with them and they left. No fines no nothing. I was told this by the landscapers when I saw them the next day. I then decided I wanted to do a hedgerow in such a way that no one could see my house from the road. \n\nI got approval from the town and once again more heavy equipment brought in with some big trucks. The neighbor called again. My wife wanted a raised flower bed at the entrance. More loud equipment and another call. Well I got tired of hearing code enforcement was coming because of noise complaints. So I ordered a truck load of pink plastic flamingos and we had fun placing them around the property. I forgot the exact total but it was over 200. This caused the neighbor to call code enforcement every day demanding the flamingos be removed. \n\nNow at one point we started to notice some of the flamingos were disappearing. We thought he stole them to throw them out. Nope. Our neighbors stole some and put them on their properties. There are way more flamingos in the neighborhood than we originally bought and someone even place a dozen on the neighbors property. So AITJ for the invasion of flamingos in my neighborhood?",

She loves to make me jealous- sends pictures of her new cars, sends pictures of her new house, sends pictures of her designer handbags etc saying “isn’t it great I can afford all this”. \n\nMIL didn’t invite us on vacation last summer. She invited and paid for her other son, his gf AND the gf’s sister to go. She bought them designer souvenirs and sent us pictures every day of their vacation captioned “I bet you’re so jealous”.\n\nNot 3 months after she excluded us from her vacation, my parents invited us on their vacation. We accepted.\n\nMIL was FURIOUS. Jealousy is not a good look on her. She threw a tantrum saying that she was losing her little boy and that she “wanted to be the best mom in the world”. She was so jealous that my mother is getting more attention than her. She cried about how she never sees us and how we’ve always “shown blatant favouritism” towards my parents. \n\nThe best bit of all this - it was at this moment SO decided to tell her that we are moving 5 hours away…to my parent’s city.",

During the time i was in their \"care\" i was sexually abused, was hospitalized for depression and they kicked me out of the house in plain snowy winter a few times as well having my body covered in bruises multiple times. \n\nEventually i decided to stop absolutely any contact with them.\n\nSome years ago they got divorced and my father remarried another women who initially seemed like she was kind and good hearted and wanted us to have a connection again. These days i realized that most likely she did this to have a clear understanding of who are the people legally entitled to have his assets. He is not by any means rich but he has some lands, country house and some good amount of cash although i am not 100% aware of the exact situation, this is just what i was told over the years and what i know from my childhood. \n\nEvery now and then i really wanted to go to the countryside house where my grandparents raised me as it's literally the only place in my home country where i felt loved and safe. Unfortunately each time i went there my father and his wife has a super abusive behavior and verbally harassed me.\n\nIn a few months i will unfortunately meet them again at a wedding of my family member where i really want to go as they are one of the last people i feel connected to from my home country. \n\nThe problem is they will be there and since every single attempt to talk to them about what happened and clearly explain that i do not feel comfortable with their behavior was simply for nothing. There is a dinamyc created where he and her consequently have zero respect and just trash me as they please. \n\nI need to change it as it is not working on for the obvious reasons and I want to break this cycle of them just casually have this behavior towards me.\n\nAny insights on the matter are greatly appreciated it other than talking to them, i repeat i tried it for years in emails, phone calls, letter, being nice with them. Nothing worked and each time they continues with the humiliation. \n\nI need an efficient way to make my point clear and change the dynamic to a situation where they would not find it so convenient to attack me. Will post this in a few groups as the day when i will meet them is approaching and i need a good strategy for the sake of my mental health.",

I told her that I rarely look at it but before we got together I paid for a subscription for a high quality porn picture to be sent to my phone every month. It was a yearly subscription for like 129bucks I got in the January sales last year. I'd usually have it as my back ground when we weren't seeing eachother and change it monthly but she said she felt it was trashy having it as my background so I've had to change it on the way to work and change it on the way back before I see her. Anyway I got home the other night from work and forgot to change it back and she saw it. It was quite a raunchy picture and it was some Asian lady bending over so you could see her bottom and a bit of her pussy through the middle. She went crazy and told me that it's ridiculous that I have this as my screen saver and said it's like something a teenager would have. I said no teenager would have that kind of money for a premium subscription and she stormed out. Shes been gone for a few days now and we've been texting but she left her iPad and while she's gone I've changed the background of that too and will change it before she comes back.

Some context, younger brother was in year 5 at this point but in year 1, my mum began pushing for him to be referred. This teacher was one of several that lied and said he was tested and didn’t have anything wrong. They had an unqualified teacher do this ‘test’ on him and then about a third of the staff backed her up. \n\nMy parents had to go private and spent a lot (between a couple hundred and a thousand pounds). We now know he is dyslexic and has ADD which my mum also has whilst my dad and several other members of our family have dyslexia. This teacher continued sh** with my family and after years I had her as my year 6 teacher.\n\nShe hated me despite the fact I was the classic shy kid and didn’t bother anyone. I have social anxiety and regularly get panic attacks but she wouldn’t let me leave the classroom. Mrs D’s torment continued for a total of ten months and after shouting at me in front of the class for missing the summer performance (I was at home throwing up for three days and had a temperature of 39 C). It wasn’t even like I had lines, we all just sang the songs and that was it.\n\nOn the Monday of my final week in that school. The week before the leavers assembly, my entire class is writing our speeches as we are all required, I completed mine and it had all that stereotypical boring stuff but Mrs D was out to get me and decided to rewrite the entire thing for me (turns out she did this to most in my class), then rips up my speech in front of me.\n\nThat Sunday night, my angry 11yo self wrote the most passive aggressive speech in the history of speeches and without telling Mrs D, I read it out to a room of my 30 classmates, all our parents and grandparents, plus a bunch of my old teachers and our head teacher. Everyone was filming and laughing then at the back of the room, I saw the look of terror in her eyes but I didn’t stop and even showed the speech she wrote before ripping it up to shreds. At the end, I gave the reward to a classmate of mine before walking off the stage with the biggest smirk ever.\n\nAfterwards I had parents and some teachers come up to me and congratulate me on my speech. Best moment of my life to this day.",

No news at all about the party itself. Building manager has instead decided to declare a “building inspection” for the week after the party to “check for defects”- everyone is to stay at home over the two days, no time slots are given and we all have to wait our turn. This really p*sses me off - a day missed at work means I lose out money. Or precious annual leave. So I call my property manager to complain. She says she will speak to landlord. If we cannot be at home, our other option is to give him (building manager) the keys to our place.\n\n\nSo yesterday I am at work, and who shows up? My landlord. He has a box of little cakes for me for Christmas. He is also a customer of ours/mine and we have a good relationship and keep it professional- I go through the appropriate channels to contact him, I’ve been here a few years now and rent is always on time and I’m a good tenant.\nWhile we are chatting he asks me about the building inspection, and turns out aside from his actual work he also has multiple units around the city and more than one in our complex, so any talk of defects is alarming to him as these are his investments. \nThe topic of the party comes up, and he takes an interest. \nWhere we live, each owner of an apartment (owner, not tenant) pays a quarterly sum to strata for building maintenance, and his concern in increasing costs from $2k a quarter to $3k. He wants to come over during the party to watch and see what is happening and who is attending. I am hesitant and he tells me he already knows about my cat and he doesn’t care. It’s very unusual but eff it, I said come over.\n\nSo anyway, he’s here now sitting on the terrace smoking a cigarette while observing the set up. Party starts in half an hour and there’s a fancy catering van.",

What I didn’t realize, is that they had like seven kids that were wandering the store and they were waiting on them to pay for it all. \n\nAll seven kids traipse past me with handfuls of stuff, and they start going down the check out isle and picking up the impulse buy items and dropping it on the conveyor belt for their parents to pay for. I’m *annoyed* at this point. I give a peeved look to the employee babysitting the self checkout folks and she rolls her eyes. We’re both like wtf. This process seriously took like 15 mins. \n\nI finally get to the register to check out my belongings and I go to drop them into a bag and I realize that there’s a bunch of stuff in there. A big bottle of Excedrin migraine, a couple different kinds of sunscreen, some little beach toys, some candy. I look at the employee, and sort of feebly and say “Oh look, they left a bunch of stuff behind…” Typically I would chase someone down, but not after this horse shit. She just winks and says “I saw nothing…” \n\nSo, I scanned my stuff, dropped it in the bag of stuff they paid for and left. As I was walking to my car, I saw all of them trying to get into two different vehicles, and everyone was fighting. And they had no idea that they didn’t have sunscreen. And after the headache, they gave me, the Excedrin came in handy. 😂",

        "text": "My sister (S) shares an apartment with her best friend (R) in a different state from me. They've lived together since they graduated from the same college (about five or six years ago now) and R's been around our family for so long, we jokingly refer to her as our parents' third child. Things have been going great for them. There's the odd hiccup or two between their personalities, but nothing too out of the ordinary. Both of them are currently working and going to grad school in their city.\n\nThat is, up until a few months ago when R met her boyfriend (A, for asshole). He was another student at their university, studying to be a doctor maybe? I can't remember. I don't know how they met, but according to S, they hit it off quickly. R was head over heels for him, since he ticked all her boxes, especially the one where he made her feel helpful and needed. You see, A was a manipulator. He would sweet-talk R into never telling him no, helping him with money, being his personal Uber driver, and generally being subservient to him. Sadly, R went along with it because, like I said, he made her feel needed because she's a genuinely kind person who loves helping others.\n\nA and S did *not* get along. S is very self-confident and strong-willed, and A *hated* it. It got to the point where they couldn't stand to be in the same room as each other. If A came over to their apartment, S left simply to keep the peace. If they did have to interact with each other, A would go out of his way to start arguments so he could act like the wounded party in front of R. When S was gone, he would cry to R about how horrible S was to him, how toxic and manipulative she was.\n\nHe was becoming more and more overtly abusive towards R. He would throw fits and complain every time R wanted to do something he didn't like or go see someone he didn't want her to see. He would demand she change her plans to suit him at the last minute, then berate her when \"she made them late\". He'd break up with her repeatedly then convince her to come back. He always blamed the breakups on S, and R was beginning to believe him. They were fighting more often and more intensely than before, R often throwing the same hurtful insults at S that A was feeding her. Their friendship, which was years old and rock solid, was beginning to crumble. The stress of it was really beginning to get to S, to the point where my parents and I were making plans to get her out of the situation.\n\nFast forward several months to now, when things seem to be returning to normal. R's family sat her down and talked to her about all the red flags we've all been seeing and things have apparently ended between R and A for good. S and R seem to be working on mending their friendship. I have a subscription to HBO Max that I pay for and share with S and our parents. Lately, I've noticed someone has been watching *Game of Thrones* and *House of the Dragon* a lot on my profile. I was confused, since I don't watch either show, but figured it was S, so I'd forgotten about it. A few days ago, I got a text from S, asking about my HBO account.\n\nIt turned out that somehow R had gotten hold of the password for my HBO login and *gave it to A without my knowledge or permission*. S was *pissed*, especially since R had accidentally mentioned it in passing and had clearly not intended to tell her about this and told me as soon as she heard.\n\nI can't do much to A. I'd happily square up as payback for the months of turmoil he's put my sister through even though I'll probably never have the chance. However, I took a great deal of petty pleasure in changing the password to the account and force-logging out every device that had ever connected to it. Good luck finishing *GoT* and *HoD* now, Asshole.",

One of them was streaming, so naturally he was player 1. If you don't know, this game's camera always follows player 1's movements. If players 2-4 walk too far off screen, they'll get teleported back to player 1, and if player 1 dies, *everyone* gets sent back to the last checkpoint, while when others die they simply can spend a life to respawn.\n\nNaturally, we got extremely competitive about everything: who got the collectable, who got the copy ability, who killed the boss, who entered the level, and especially who got the kick ass super ability that occasionally appeared. And there was a LOT of betrayal, as all of the best game sessions with your homies should. But player 1, having the ability to control progression in a level, had the upper hand against everyone. He would run in the opposite direction of everyone else to make them teleport, fall in pits or die on purpose to reset progress, and catch rides with other players by riding on their back through the level only to steal the glory right at the end. \n\nEventually, we had a vote to have this person overthrown as player 1, and I was elected instead. I had fully intended to play the game normally for once. But that power...it's just so *intoxicating*. \n\nYes, I became player 1, with all the powers that entail that title. But I was also in a unique position. You see, this person was still streaming. It was a small audience, but it was an audience all the same. And I had been cucked outta getting the super ability too many times. \n\nMy dictatorship didn't last long. The game was almost over anyway. But I made the impact I wanted. Historians still say that my reign over Dreamland was one of the worst ever, worse than the original dictator. ",

Threatening, breaking things, sleeping around, skipping class, etc. She never really ever had serious consequences to her actions because she has autism, and since she's a minor, they can't kick her out yet. Yes, she has issues, but she can easily change her actions in front of her billionth boyfriend, so we all know she's doing all that for attention.\n\nMe and her got into an argument over the summer, and something private had slipped out of my mouth. She started blackmailing me by threatening to tell our parents ever since. I've been so scared of being admitted to the mental hospital, so I kept my mouth shut.\n\nWell, we got into another argument about a week ago. She decided it would be a great idea to bring it up to my parents. I was shocked. So were my parents. But, low behold, NO CONSEQUENCES!\n\nWell, A is in the school band. With every club and activity we have at school, part of the requirements is that you have to have no obligations, or you'll be kicked out until that obligation is removed. \n\nA, as I said before, skips class a lot and doesn't stop. She's gotten 2 detentions already. Well, when you get 3 detentions, you get suspended. Suspension, no matter how long, is an obligation.\n\nI saw her skipping class and in the cafeteria. She was talking to someone who bullied me for almost my entire life. I had enough of her. I was so frustrated with everything she did. \n\nAt school, I'm a \"goody two shoes\", so I talked to the vice principal. I slowly walked while talking to her and slowly lured her closer to A. The vice principal saw her and immediately called her to her office.\n\nShe's in the middle of her suspension and she can't participate in the band anymore. \n\nShe's whining about it but I really couldn't care less.",

        "text": "Once upon a time I worked in Heaven.  IT Heaven, anyway.  I had an office with the other IT engineers that was inaccessible to end users, in fact to anyone who was not an IT engineer - except our director, who reported to the CIO.  And this idyllic arrangement lasted for a few glorious, immensely productive and rewarding years.  Then, the CIO decided to insert a manager between us and the director.  I immediately smelled smoke, and where there's smoke there's the flames of Hell to turn your little bit of Heaven to ash.\n\nNew manager is a total Jackass, kid from a rich family, and had been hired by our marginally competent CIO with the specious claim that he'd been the \"director\" of IT for a smaller company some distance from our locale.  It wasn't a large business, and \"director\" of IT for this place simply meant that there wasn't really an IT department aside from this clown, and it was really a jack-of-all-trades position.  Not unusual for small companies, and it didn't mean that you weren't really good at your job - except he wasn't.  And he was even worse as a manager.  The first week he was there, he got to do my yearly performance review.  You folks can already feel my pain, yeah?  This guy doesn't even know me.  All he has to do is say, \"well this looks like you had a good year, here's the percentage the company is giving you as a salary increase, hope the coming year will be as good.\"  Nope.  Not Jackass enough.\n\nNow, I'd had that fantastic year we all hope for, and I had a great deal of professional satisfaction from it.  I'd implemented a robust new e-mail system from start to finish.  Spec'd out the hardware, licensed the software, racked it, wired it, configured it, tested it, and it hummed like the well-oiled machine I intended it to be - a thing of beauty, and a joy to behold.  And it wasn't my only expert accomplishment for the year, it was simply my biggest.  I'd earned 5 out of 5 on my review, and I knew it - \"walking on water\" as they say.  Jackass couldn't change the review, but he told me right off the bat: \"I wouldn't have given you a 5.  Nobody rates a 5.\"  Well, not you anyway, I thought, and things went downhill between us from that point.\n\nI put up with this legend in his own mind for a couple of years, and cleaned up after him much too often.  I got a few more certifications in the meantime, and was scouting for the next opportunity when Jackass did us all a great favor and took another position himself.  Small town IT has many great stories about this engagement, hard to believe that he was an even bigger fuck-up at the next job but he'd been hired as an actual director, at a company with an IT department bigger than ours - and was found lacking to say the least.\n\nI stayed at my company for another few years and then went to a more challenging job where I had a sweetheart of a guy for a manager.  He came to me not long after I started and asked me about Jackass, seems he was trying to get hired by one of the contracting companies that supplied us with some specialized services.  My first reaction was to chuckle that Jackass would lower himself from \"director\" to \"grunt\" because I knew the work he would be doing.  But my second thought was a little darker - Jackass would be working at my facility.  In my mind I started rewriting my resume, but I told my boss, as professionally as I could, \"well, I worked for Jackass for a time over at Oldcompany and we didn't see eye-to-eye, I think he lacks adequate planning skills and is a bit of a loose cannon.  You should ask the place he left Oldcompany for.\"  Which was entirely true.  To my great relief, my boss said \"well, we don't need that kind of grief around here, I'll ask them to submit another candidate.\"  Like I said, sweetheart of a guy, I really missed him when he left.  Unlike Jackass.  I don't think Jackass ever heard the old saying, \"be careful who you step on while you're climbing the ladder, you might meet them again on your way back down!\"",

        "text": "I was at a popular ice cream shop with a couple friends. They’re known for baking different flavors of brownies and then you choose an ice cream to mix with it. They can also make ice cream cakes either custom order or they have some premade ones in their freezers in the shop. \n\nIt was a weekend afternoon and this shop had a line out the door. My friends and I waited, it wasn’t a big deal. When it was our turn order, my two friends ordered their desserts first, paid, and went to grab a table to sit at in the shop. When it was my turn, I placed my order and then excused myself to the restroom to pee really quick while the employee was mixing. When I came out, my ice cream cup was on top of the glass counter….and some kid who had to be about 10 just went up and swiped it and started eating it! I said to him, “Uhh excuse me, that was mine.” The kid’s assumed Karen of a mother was standing next to him and said “Well it was just sitting there, you can order another one.” Dumbfounded, I looked at them, a customer behind them in the line, and at the shop employee, who just shrugged with a “I don’t understand it either” kind of face. The customer behind them had a “wtf” look on their face. \n\nSo I ordered another one. \n\nMeanwhile towards the register, Karen and her son were actually there to pick up a custom cake. The employee at the register was showing them the cake to make sure it was to their liking. My second order was ready and I moved down to the register next to them to pay. By then the kid and inhaled my first order. I take my order from the employee and set it down in the counter right in front of me to get my card out to pay. At this point, my friends were finished eating and were waiting outside for me. That kid swiped my order AGAIN and started eating it…from right in front of me! I snapped at him “Hey you brat that was mine!” The kid starts giggling like it’s all a big joke. Karen turns to me and said “Do NOT speak to my child like that! You shouldn’t keep leaving your order just sitting on the counter for someone to take!” I replied “It was RIGHT in front of me, clearly I wasn’t leaving it there!” She just smirked and went back to her cake order getting ready to pay. The brat is just eating my ice cream staring at me. \n\nI don’t know what came over me, but I was enraged at this point. So I went to the register counter where her cake was boxed up and she was paying. I smashed the lid of the super thin cardboard box into the cake with my fist. Both the shop employee and Karen look at me in stunned silence. The kid is just eating MY second order of ice cream, not paying attention. I looked at Karen, smiled, and said “you shouldn’t leave your order just sitting there. You can order another one.” I turned to quickly walk out and meet my friends before she could react to me so I don’t know what the aftermath was. Maybe next time Karen won’t let her kid just take things that don’t belong to him!",

I had a few employees to handle small issues, but larger issues I would compete to provide services/equipment with other vendors kind of like my corporation.  It was a really weird setup, but I needed a job, and it paid pretty good for the area.  \n\n Customer needed to rent 2 huge semi sized air compressors, cause their piss poor planning and maintenance had shitcanned a 800hp compressor.  Now we were just a subcontractor for Agreco the actual owner of the equipment.  So the customer called and said we need this asap, get it going, I said sure.  Got them on the way, on a Saturday, but I had been warned by everybody CYA around here(LPT if thats said on a daily basis at your job, your job sucks ass), so I told the plant manager, I sent you an email and I need a response to it within the hour or I will cancel the order.  He sent an approval for the weekly expense 10k per week + an hourly rate for any usage over 40 hrs.  They had to run them 2/47 for 4 weeks.  \n\nNow the plant manager wasn't my usual contact, sent that email approval to my regular contact as well, and then asked for a PO on Monday.  He said in person by the end of the week, Friday came around, and I reminded him in email, and he responded later that day by text, he will get it by Monday.    The same thing kept happening for this issue and many others.  You send an email asking for something, and the person would hunt you down and tell you the answer only verbally.  I knew what the writing on the wall was, and I started looking for new job after only 2-3 months.  \n\nI finally gave notice, and in my last two weeks, it finally came to a head.  My boss was pushing for the PO, for what turned out to be about 100k in rental fees.  In a meeting with my contact, the Plant Manager, their VP, their accountant, my boss, my VP, my VP of accounting.  The meeting was me in person with the customer, and all my coworkers on zoom.  So that was fun.  I was on my way out and didn't give a shit, but then the Plant manager said in a meeting that he had never given permission for this. I just smiled and pulled out the entire stack of correspondence, almost all one way, but not all, including screenshots of texts, meeting notes, meeting agendas, with a full timeline.  \n\nNobody clapped, nobody said good job, the customer said they needed some time to look it over and shut the meeting down.  My boss did say thank you profusely on my last day for doing that for him.  He knew the place was a shit hole too, but I did save him a huge ass chewing, and probably his yearly bonus.  \n\nTL;DR Shitty corporation, tried to rip off another shitty corporation, I kept good records and saved some poor manager his bonus.  I got something much better, a new job.",

He was also a person who claimed he had always done something better, or had a more extreme experience than anyone else, or so he claimed. During that time we hired another 6 team members, but the boss ended up driving us to other jobs. Near the end, the 7 of us went to lunch as 2 of them were leaving the next day. We intended to only be out for an hour, but we started comparing notes on the BS he’d told us, and it became hilarious. We wrote his claims down, and were skeptical that he’d been in 4 graduate programs at 4 different colleges, was teaching scuba diving and airplane acrobatics while beating world class skiers, bicyclists and racquetball pros. After a few pitchers of beer and an extended lunch, I think we made it back by 4pm.",

His favorite reward was a team pizza party he’d give after he’d beat them senseless to get a new product launched early. He’d hold it on a Saturday afternoon at his ginormous house in the boonies. No spouses invited, just the 5-9 members of the team. He’d use coupons and order the cheapest free delivery pizza available, and pull the no-name soda out of the cooler. The party was always an excuse to do a post-release team beat down on how they could have done it faster. Until, the time everybody called in after the pizza was ordered to say something had come up, and they couldn’t make it. He got stuck with 5 cheap pizzas that his 2 pampered kids refused to eat. Turns out that his team had their own pizza party elsewhere, and a lot of alcohol was consumed as well. The team had to pay for it, but they had a blast.",

        "text": "15 years ago, I’m (15f) at home with my friend and my two brothers. Mom doesn’t come home often, and dad lives in a single bedroom apartment so we’re alone a lot. When Mom does come home she’s pretty distracted and stays in her massive bedroom. \n\nMy friend and I start “rough housing” and get carried away when I trip and she’s pushed into the wall. There’s a small crack and idention from her butt, my little brother (13) gasps and says “Oooh your gonna get in troubleeee” \n\nAnd so, I start working him over\n\n“Look, there will be a time when you’re older and you’ll need /me/ to cover for you. And I’ll keep it, but I need you to keep this”\n\n“C’mon Peyton it’s not a big deal, just a lil scratch mom won’t even notice”\n\n“Please, please, please I’ll do your chores for a month”\n\nHe concedes and I think he’s gonna be cool- then, we hear dads pickup truck in driveway, here to take my brothers to his place for the night. \n\n\nI see it in his eyes before he even moves, he’s going to tell on me. I lunge into action, right as he heads to the door. I grab his hoodie while he opens the screen door, but he snatches his arm away. We’re running over the front yard, me at a full tilt ready to tackle, he starts yelling to dad \n\n“DADCAITLYNANDHERFRIENDWEREFIGHTINGANDPUTAHOLEINTHEWALLLLL”\n\nHe makes it to the car door, but not before I smoosh him against it with my lack of braking. \n\nDad barks about the value of homes, mom finds out and cries about the landlord and my friends “influence”.\n\nBut life…uhhhh finds a way. \n\nMom moved to a new city, dad gets a trailer home outside of town. We grow up.\n\n\nI’m 17 and get home, Dad meets me outside “hey, can you pick up your little brother from the bowling alley? He needs a ride.”\n\nI turn back and head into town. He’s at the skating rink next door, and is walking very quickly to the car. \n\n“Hey.”\n\n“Hey”\n\n*tap tap tap*\n\nA women is knocking on the drivers side door.\n\n“Are you his parent?”\n\n“Nope”\n\n“Well, you need to tell them he is NOT welcomed back. Him and his friends have been horrible, rude, cursing, stealing. No more, he’s not allowed back.” \n\nWe drive off and he’s begging me not to tell Dad. No worries, I’m cool. \n\nFeeling affection for my younger brother, I go into how I understand and he’s going to have fun growing up and can come to me, but not be a jackass. \n\nHe barely hears and is still fixated on not telling, his pleading started a trickle of a memory that grew over the car ride back. \n\n\nI cut him off, “-well, Peyton, I would normally keep this quiet. But remember that time I asked you to keep something secret and you didn’t-“\n\nHis eyes widened, he knew exactly, we’re at the turn in to the road to the trailer park. He begins wailing sobs, and threatens to jump out of the car. As we pull into parking, I jump out and hit the locks to deter him- I need but only a second lead to get to the door first.  \n\nHis hysterical screeching rage sent an energy through me I haven’t felt since Vindicated was on the Spider-Man soundtrack, and I vomited the report to Dad. \n\n\nDad didn’t care too much, he was more ornery than that growing up. Ahhh, but Peyton’s emotional trauma from the consequences of his own betrayal was a victory that propels me forward to this day.",

It was a cheaper option and they didn't mind that i moved in. We regularly split chores because we have opposite schedules. I work morning, he works evenings. On Sunday we were cleaning our room and the last task was to do the laundry. We decided to do it the next day cuz of lack of time. He agreed to wash and dry and i agreed to fold and put away. When i came home from lunch i noticed that he was a quarter of the way and was going to go to work soon. I didnt think anything of it so i let him do his thing. I came home after my shift was over and noticed someone was washing clothes. I asked his mom who was doing laundry and she said my bf had asked her to put a load in and that i can take care of the rest when i came back. I have never blushed so hard in my life. I realized she had put to wash the darks and she seperated the colors. TMI here, i have old period panties that i use when im on my days. She saw all of them. AND she saw my intimate underwear. She claimed she didnt see anything but we all know she saw. She's meticulous with laundry and seperates each clothing for a better wash. I was so angry. I sent him a text saying \"you are dumb, why would you ask your mom?\" So I started folding the laundry and decided, fine, i'll do my part. I neatly folded my clothing and hung my other clothing. I threw all his clothing unfolded into his drawers. I always folded his underwear, not this time. I roll his socks, not this time. His shirts, i stuffed into the drawer and left the rest on the dresser. And i used up all the hangers for my laundry. I put this rest of his clothes on THE chair. When he came he apologized, I said, you're dumb, don't ever embarrass me like that. He went to shower and open his drawers and he said, \"i made you that mad?\" And laughed a \"i love you even though your mad\" laugh and i got over it. The End.",

Basically ever other clients were very kind with us the whole weekend. They were happy that the youth worked hard to get their nice trip, let us put their product in their bag even if we weren't the best in the world for that and gave us a nice tip. But this old lady arrived, saw us and immediately started to complain and say things like «dont mess my things! Do this like this! Dont do that! Dont forget to do this» and blablabla in a very agressive manner. While she was paying and therefore not looking at us, my best friend took her two packs of 12 Coke (soda cans) and shook them like his life depended on it. I tried very very hard not to laugh when the lady took her bags and left. We made sure to give her a very warm and kind «Have a nice day» before laughing really hard. I really hope she got angry when every single one of ther 24 coke cans exploded  when she opened them. \n\nI told this to my «intervenante», which is kind of the adult in charge at the MDJ about this story a week ago, so 3 years after it happened, and she laughed really hard. \n\nHope you enjoyed!

Apologies to those who don't like graphic stories.\n\nIn the Navy, I was a snipe (engineer) and spent most of my time in the engine room.  We had a stack of porn mags (seriously, like 20 of 'em) we hid on the top of the switchboard in Main Engine Room 2.  This is way away from any khakis (chiefs and officers) as one was supposed to have double hearing protection, steel toe boots, etc. to enter the space.

The Engine Room was huge - like the size of a gymnasium - with 2 LM2500 gas turbines, generator, switchboard and a main reduction gear the size of a semi.  One day three of us were skating on watch (effing off) and looking through the mags when my buddy opens up a page to a massive wad of jizz.  Some asshole jerked into the fucking mag!  So, we went on a campaign and put signs up in engineering berthing that read, \"WHO IS THE PHANTOM SPUNKER IN MER 2?\"  It took a couple days but we narrowed it down to this one crazy fuck.  He denied it, of course, but it only could have been him.  We all played it cool but one night when my buddy pulled midwatch, he jerked into dude's boots.  Guy went psycho in the morning when he slid his foot in.  As usual everybody is scrambling to make morning muster and he had to scoop out as much as he could (yes, he used paper towels from the head) but still had to put it on and make muster.  He never ratted, of course, and we never had jizz in the mags again.",

        "text": "So this is maybe two decades ago by now. Can't remember the exact year, but it's definitely before 2008. I was around 8 at the time.\n\nThere's four people in this story: me, Cousin A, Cousin B, and my aunt.\n\nHere's a bit of background, and why this happened in the first place: Cousin B is autistic. No one in the family has any issues with it...except for my aunt, who was Cousin B's mother. She's the textbook definition of \"Filipino goes to America and goes native\"; pasty white, obese, complete Karen in personality. It was only around 2019 that I realized just how much of a Karen she was, but that's not important here.\n\nAnyway, Cousin A has a Playstation 2. His dad (my uncle, of course :v) does limit how long we can play, as he believed the PS2 can overheat and cause issues. Don't know how true this is, but okay, I'm a child back then, can't speak up against the adults.\n\nNow, Cousin B was visiting at the time, flew all the way to spend time with us, but they're not staying at grandma's house, where Cousin A is staying. He came right around our allocated time with the PS2 was running out, and we had to turn it off. I can't remember how long Cousin B has been there already, but we had to tell him about this rule I think?\n\nAnyway, my aunt was pissed. Got really screechy preacher mode, though I can't actually understand what she was saying at the time, couldn't remember now, nor do I give two shits about it.\n\nAnd me, being a child who is not allowed to talk back, and did not like talking to people, especially adults in the first place, did the only thing I could: leave. After all, why would I stay near someone who'd blast my ears off?\n\nAnyway, this being the 2000s, my area was safe enough for a child to go home on their own. I can't remember if I had the money to use public transportation, but there weren't many options to have fun back then so I definitely had the patience to walk the maybe half hour distance between grandma's and my house. I think someone questioned why I was suddenly home, but I ignored it.\n\nAnyway, it was years later that I heard the other side of the story: hearing it then, apparently the moment people realized that I wasn't there anymore resulted in a lot of panic. It was only when my mother had to be called that people found out that I was back home.\n\nLooking back on that incident, I definitely feel bad for my cousins. I felt like an asshole for leaving Cousin A back there, but given that years later he doesn't seem to care, I don't think it registered as anything important to him.\n\nI don't feel sorry for my aunt though. Could've talked to us calmly like a reasonable adult would when talking to children, but she just had to go full Karen on us. Apparently shouting at children can make them do things that potentially bites you in the ass later, who knew?",

I tried my best in the beginning to be calm about it but her attitude and aggressiveness got worse. \n\nDespite not wanting to be the type, I ended up going higher up to talk to them about her and how her issue with me is effecting how I do my job and my work when she’s taking over for me or “supporting” me.\n\nNothing changed. Nothing was fixed. It seems like she’s been this way since she started and everyone just accepts it. \n\nWelllll, she would always wear this perfume (which is technically against rules since we work with food nsuch) but she’d always put an insufferable amount on. To the point where you’d be able to smell her like 5/6 feet away. It’s not a bad smell. But I decided to start covering my nose and acting like she stunk whenever I was around/near her. \n\nI did it very obviously too. Sometimes even putting my nose into the bend of my elbow just to be petty. \n\nLong story short, she no longer wears any perfume. I still act like she stinks though. Haha. \n\nProbably super stupid but I’m happy with it. And I can’t lose my job because of it. So that’s good.",

We didn’t like the idea at start cause it’s expensive and she wanted a specific one but now we love it! \n\nEveryone in the house use it, but sometimes they got lazy to clean the dishes and just left it beside the sink.

We’re still being petty and refused to wash her dishes since it’s easy to tell which one is hers. She could just start using the dishwasher, the one she ‘forces’ us to buy.",

When I came back from school the bank was gone and I asked my mom about it and she tells me my stepdad cashed it out himself and that he would give me the cash back and I’m like okay.\n\nAbout 2 weeks go by and I never got the cash back so I start asking about it and my mom says he kept the cash because it makes up for all the haircuts and gifts he has got me. So one day when he came home from work  we were gonna have a BBQ anyways so he was outside and he had his wallet and phone on the table outside. He carries a lot of cash so I waited for him to go back inside and I took 200 dollars from his wallet and went back inside to my room and I hid it in my sock drawer.\n\nI remember him asking me and my mom what happened to the money and my mom didn’t believe that I would steal from him so she just said that the wind probably blew it away because his wallet was outside. My middle school was right beside a shopping center that had Starbucks,Chick-fil-A and Wendy’s so everyday when the bus would drop me off I would go to any of those places for breakfast until my 200 dollars ran out.",

The family would say things like “ya he had a 2 refill night” meaning he had his original bath, then drained and refilled 2 more times for a total of 3 baths spanning approximately 2.5-3 hours. He also learned to open the cabinet door and pull the drawer out so you couldn’t pop the lock to go in and physically remove him (parents had zero control over him 🤣). When he was around 10-12 years and I was (f16-18) he would steal my bath oils, salts, and bubble baths that I bought with my own money. When I would yell at him he would laugh in my face because there was “nothing I could do about it”. I went to my parents and my mom told me it was my fault for not hiding them well enough (insert are you kidding me?) So, I took matters into my own hands and one time realized I could get him where it hurts and cut off his access to hot water by shutting off the hot water line. To add to the pettiness, the first time I did it, I waited about 30 seconds so he had just enough water in the tub to actually make him cold on the rest of his body. At first he thought the power went out and was yelling for help. I immediately ran to the door to help him… I ended up “figuring it out” about 20 minutes later. I continued doing this for the next week and he caught on and all hell broke lose. I could actually hear him flailing in anger, yelling profanities, but he had zero control now. He paid for his theft for months.  It got to the point where I would shut off the hot water and then leave the house. I just reminded my parents of this situation and my dad was laughing so hard he couldn’t talk. 😈  Also, thanks to r/pettyrevenge I have realized that this is definitely my fight style.",

Her sister was one year older than her (22) and she loved me like an amazing friend and was very sympathetic about my girlfriend having cheated on me and agreed that we would have sex when she came home from work. We done it while she had walked in through the door and then ran out crying. I didnt feel guilty because she ruined our relationship and my best friends relationship. I do not care if she apologizes or gives me anything. All of this was wrong but I was filled with anger. Her parents aren't mad neither happy, today, me and my girlfriend broke up.",

        "text": "So in the early 2000's when dinosaurs roamed the Earth and video stores were a thing, I worked at a national video store chain, and was asked to go work a few weeks at a different store than normal because their assistant manager had quit on short notice. This just happened to fall around inventory time. Now the way inventory worked was you brought in most of the staff, after the store closed for the night, and it would be a long night of scanning every copy of every movie, every soda, every bag of candy, everything, so it would take hours. I was not scheduled for inventory, because I had to open the store the next morning.\n\nWhen I came in, it was clear that inventory had not gone as normal. I found empty beer bottles, the trash was overflowing and the whole store was a mess. Someone had even put out a cigarette on one of the shelves, and there was an almost empty bag of weed on the manager's desk. Needless to say, I was pissed. It was normal for people to goof off during inventory, and I wouldn't have said a word normally, but they left their mess for me to clean up. So I went into the office and checked the surveillance cameras, which had been turned off. But the geniuses didn't think to do it until *after* it had already caught the manager letting his friends with the cooler in.\n\nAgain, had they just cleaned up after themselves, I would never have said a word or even cared, as long as the work got done. But they left their mess for me to clean up, and I was in no mood. So, I called the district manager and let him know, He was livid when he saw the bottles, and the video. But he almost didn't notice the weed and the cigarette burn. I made sure to point them out to him, and just for good measure, I suggested we recount all the money in the safe (I didn't think they had taken anything, I just wanted to stoke the flames under the boss by making him wonder, and have to take the time.)\n\nBasically everyone got fired except myself and the one other employee who wasn't there, and was out of state at the time. As a bonus, one of the geniuses decided to make death threats against me, and was easily traced and arrested. I informed the officers that I was indeed frightened for my life and yes, I did want to press charges. I never heard from any of them again, but I do sometimes still think of them.\n\nNote: Honestly, I did exactly what I was supposed to do, it was only petty because normally I would have covered for them, but I was pissed they left their mess for me to clean up. So I made sure they were fired.",

That I should stay happy and not let this get to me.\n\nSaw him at a party later. He was trying to talk to me, he literally pulled my arm for me to come with him. I didn’t, told him I was going inside. Then he asked me “are we enemies now”. I just said no and that it was good to see him and went in. He saw me having a great time with girlfriends, saw other guys trying to hit on me and my best guy friend came with our mutual friends. He didn’t try to talk to me again and he went home early lol, I had unfriended him on instagram now saw that he blocked me afterward and saw he had been sending voice msg on whatsapp and deleted them again. \n\nMaybe it is not revenge revenge but I feel like I got out on top and his big ego needed this.

The owner of the house had walled off all the stairways and made three apartments, one for each floor, and we lived in the middle on the ground floor. \n\nAs this was an old house soundproofing was really not a thing, but it was never a problem until both the tenants above and below us moved out and new ones appeared out of the blue one night.\n\nThis story is about the 4-8 guys living in the 4 bedroom collective in the attic (not a joke, i never did figure out just how many were actually living in that tiny space)\n\nFrom the very first night they showed up, the non-existant soundproofing became very apparent, and we quickly understood that this might become an issue if not addressed, So after a few days we rang their doorbell and introduced ourselves and really tried to greet them as friendly neighbours, making sure to  be very polite and welcoming. And at the same time we brought up the non-existant soundproofing and asked very nicely if they could keep that in mind and that we would be very gratefull. \n\nOfcourse at this point they were all smiles and agreed right away to keep noise down on weekday nights, and in return we would not complain about music and partying on the weekends. After all, all we wanted was to sleep in peace when we had work in the morning.\n\nThat did not last long.\n\nI will spare you all the friendly and not so friendly, and passive agressive ways we tried to find a solution to our problem. Let's just say there were a myriad of attempts made to solve this peacefully.\n\nEventually i flat out told them that i would no longer take our noise complaints to them, the 'manager' of the apartments, or the owner of the house, and i explained that according to our laws, excessive noise after a certain time on weekdays was in fact illegal, altough common sense and decency usually made this a non-issue, and in the future i would take our complaints to the police instead. And i got laughed at for it.\n\nNow comes the revenge part.\n\nWe all knew that some of the guys upstairs were dealing all kinds of fun stuff, and when i met someone i knew through work out in the parking lot heading for the attic with a wad of cash, i got all the intel i needed.\n\nAnd so i waited for the weekend to pass, and you could probably have guessed it, the following monday night they had a big party still going strong well into the AM and by the smells and the smoke that wafted out of the open windows i knew this was my moment.\n\nI called the non-emergency number for the police, registered my complaint and gave some backstory. The nice lady on the other end was very understanding and said a patrol car would come around in a little while. I thanked her and said i would meet them outside.\n\nAbout an hour or so later the patrol car pulled up and i went outside for a chat, and being the helpfull citizen i am, i explained that the doorbell was busted (It wasn't) but a stairway in the backyard would take them up on the balcony outside of the upstairs living room where the party was at. \n\nThe officer thanked me and i walked back inside our appartment while grining from ear to ear. I knew what was about to happen, and it was going to be glorious.\n\nWhile i was posted up in a window overlooking the parkinglot, this night quickly turned into the best sleepless night i have ever had.\n\nOne of the officers remained by the front door while two more went around the back. Now i don't know why there were three officers in one car, usually there are only two, but in a moment you will understand why that was very lucky.\n\nThe music got turned off a minute or two later and just like as if there was a fire, people, backpacks and other objects startet flying out of every door and window all at the same time. I could hear a whole lot of shouting through the floor and the officer by the front door was literaly blocking the doorway trying to stem the massive flow of people trying to flee the scene.\n\nI made sure to take note of where the backpacks and bags that were thrown out landed where there was tall grass and such and kept listening, watching and really wishing i had a tub of popcorn.\n\nThings calmed down pretty quickly after that, but the officers didn't come back out so i stayed by the window and soon another patrol car pulled up, then another, then one of those big ones for transporting 'un-cooperative people', and another big one soon after that. You get the picture.\n\nAfter watching the parade of people in handcuffs disappearing into cars and being  driven away, and waiting a bit to make sure everything was over, i went back outside and called over the officer i talked to earlier.\n\n\"Hey, I don't really know what just happened and i'm sure i don't want to know, but in case you are interested i saw some backpacks or something fly from upstairs and into that field over there. i can point out the general area if you'd like.\" \n\nThat was a lie of course, but being the dutiful citizen i am i felt it was important to make sure they didn't miss anything. it could be important.\n\nA little bit of searching later and the remaining officers left with a small pile of backpacks and bags and i went to bed with a big smile on my face. \n\nQuiet at last.\n\nThere's a little more to the aftermath but this post is already long enough. I never saw some of them again before i moved away and the ones remaining were a lot more considerate of our need for sleep.\n\n\nTLDR:\nUpstairs neighbours kept us awake most nights with parties and music. I called in one noice complaint to the police and a bunch of people got arrested on drug related charges. My bad!",

His job this night was to wait for midwatch who wanted to food to finish, clean the galley and scrub the pots and pans.  I was on my rounds and decided to get some air and hit mid-decks to chill when I hear this banging and cursing.  Not typical as 90% of the crew are asleep.  I un-dog the door (look it up) to see this pile of pots and pans probably four feet high in Perez's arms and him peering around the lot and climbing the stairs to where I was.  \n\n\"What's up dude?\" I asked.\n\n\"Fuck those assholes.  Not doing it,\" he said as he heaved the entire pile overboard.  \n\nI laughed so hard I almost pissed myself.\n\n\"Bro, you're gonna be fucked in the AM when see all that shit missing.\"\n\n\"Nope, they'll never notice.\"\n\nAnd they sure didn't. \n\nLaughing now still as I'll never get that image of this mass of metal going over the side and the look of satisfaction on Perez's face.",

        "text": "My mom is a professor at a community college. Currently she is terribly ill with the flu. She asked me, her 25 y/o daughter, to hand back her student's graded papers for her this morning. She also asked me to hand in her Dr's note to her department's office. \n\nI got there a little early so I turned in the note then waited in the classroom as students started coming in. The department secretary stopped by as I was waiting and asked if class was still happening. I told her I was just handing back papers. Some of the students that were there heard this and I guess decided it was safe to start complaining about their professor, my mom. \n\nThey complained about their assignments, how long she took to get back to emails, her grading, just really went in on their grievances. It was honestly pretty amusing and I take no offense. The woman raised me, I know she can be a hard ass at times and she definitely could be better about timely communication. However, it is rather ballsy to openly talk shit about your professor in their classroom, even if they are not there. \n\nSo I just listened, and when the class start time rolled around they were still at it. So I stood up, and cleared my throat. \n\n\"Hi, Ms. Abundance is out as she is ill today. I'm her daughter and I'm here to hand back your papers.\" \n\nAll the trash talking students looked like they had seen a ghost. I handed back their papers, took questions, and dismissed them. Was that detail necessary to include? Nah, but was it hilarious to see their reactions? Definitely. Plus, now they get to sweat while they wonder if I tell her about their complaints. I won't, but it will be a good lesson for them to learn. 😌",
