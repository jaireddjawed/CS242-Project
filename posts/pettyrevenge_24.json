My dad walked in and I was like dude learn to knock.... he responds by telling me I should have locked the door.\n\nNo one in my family knocks on the fuckin door......All the time when I'm taking a shit/piss/shower, I hear the doorknob jiggle and it's locked so they just walk away. \n\nMy whole family uses the doorknob being locked as indicator of the bathroom being occupied or not, which is blasphemous. It really annoys me- just fucking knock on the door and if no one answers, then your good.... it's not rocket science \n\n\nSo I decided that I would NOT lock the door anymore and see how many times my stupid family would walk in on me pissing or shitting or showering before they learned how to fucking knock. \n\nWelp it's 2 weeks later and everyone in my family has walked in on me in the bathroom at least 3 times each... It's gotta be way more uncomfortable for them than it is for me and now I don't know how long this is gonna take. \n\nIt has to work eventually right?",

        "text": "To preface, this happened decades ago.  Everyone involved was mid-20s to mid-30s.  I do not regret my pretty revenge, but I do regret not standing up for my coworker at the time of the Karening.  Our players are Me, OM (Oblivious Manager), NC (Nice Coworker), and KC (Karenish Coworker).  Me and KC held the same position, with me having some seniority and KC being new to the job.  NC was a valued member of our support staff.  The business is interviewing needy clients and provide what assistance we could. \n\nSo, one day I have an issue I need to get cleared by a manager.  OM, a nice enough guy but not that interested in the job, was closest.  As I arrived at his open door, I saw NC standing at his desk talking with him.  I remained outside in the hall, waiting my turn.  KC comes down the hall and barrells past me and into OM's office.  She immediately starts asking him a question.  NC, clearly taken aback, says, \"You interrupted me.\"  She said it in a light tone, giving KC an \"out\" to apologize.  Oh, no. KC got red-faced and sputtered, \"But, but, you're just a clerk!\"  \n\nOM was too surprised or just too disinterested to call out KC. I was so gobsmacked I can't recall in what order he addressed their issues and I don't even remember talking to him about mine.  I wished I'd said something.  OM should have, of course, but he didn't.  This couldn't stand. \n\nI love support staff.  They work dammed hard for crap pay and get looked down on by people like KC.  Their work is just as important as my own.  I was friendly with all the support staff and was always willing to help out.  Your coverage is late and you really need to pee?  Sure, I'll watch the phones for you for a few minutes.  Have an application packet going to my end of the building?  Sure, I can do it off.  Nothing special, and honestly, most of us did the same.  I'm not in any way unique.  \n\nYou know what happened.  I went to the biggest gossip amongst the support staff and told them about KC and how rude she was to sweet NC.  Within an hour, every member of support staff knew about it and it became a running joke for them to call each other \"Just a Clerk.\"  KC found herself saddled with the most difficult clients at the most inconvenient times.  No one was willing to do her favors.  She was shunned by all the support staff as well as most of the rest of us.  We renamed her \"Just a Jerk.\"  Never to her face,  of course.   No one wanted an HR visit.  \n\nKC resigned not long after.  That would have happened regardless - she wasn't very good at her job and didn't like her work.  I hope she learned to treat everyone with respect regardless of their title.  NC, a single mom, finished school and got herself a fantastic new job a year or so later.  I still wish I'd said something.  I've tried to be better moving forward.",

        "text": "A friend of mine works for an animal sanctuary. One of the star attractions is their big cats, including tigers and lions. \n\nI know the king of the jungle is hotly contested between tigers and lions, and by Matt Hancock for himself, but this involves a lion.\n\nI booked my family in to this sanctuary a few months ago. Thanks to my friend, she'd bumped us up to the VIP suites as they had space, which meant that on the second day, we were able to have our meals right next to the lion enclosure. After breakfast/lunch, one group would be taken to hand-feed the lions through a metal grate. \n\nOur group was the lunch group. We were able to see the breakfast group hand-feed the lions whilst having our own meals. We had a free half-hour whilst this happened, so we all just sat having a coffee and watched the hand feed in front of the enclosure.\n\nYou know when you go on any excursion, there's occasionally one or two idiots who spoil things for everybody else? Well, we had the same in our tour. One particular tourist who had the world's biggest camera, took flash photography everywhere, even though we were expressely told not to use the flash, and was generally being a bit of a dick. \n\nCats are smart creatures, so it stands to reason that big cats, let alone the actual apex predators, are even smarter than your average housecat. \n\nWhilst we were watching the breakfast group feed, a question was asked about how aggressive the lions were. We'd hand-fed tigers the day before and were told \"they're all elderly animals and know they'll get fed by humans. They might look scary and some of them might rear up on their hind legs against the grill, but you're safe, don't worry.\"\n\nThis was true. All of the animals we saw were docile, relaxed, and were living their twilight years somewhere safe where they had enough space to run around and relax. \n\nAnyway back to this dickhead tourist. The lion he was feeding had previously noticed his flash photography and didn't like it (obviously). We saw this first-hand; as soon as dickhead tourist got to the feeding gate, the lion roared, turned around, and aimed a very accurate urination directly at this guy's face. \n\nWe didn't really think much about it until all of the handlers in the dining room with us burst out laughing and said \"oh my god, \\[lion name\\] pissed on that guy!\" \n\nA few questions were asked and they said that the animals never did that maliciously unless they really didn't like someone.\n\nLions can't quite hide frozen fish in curtain rails or throw bird seed on someone's car, but they sure know how to pee on someone's face. Dickhead tourist wasn't impressed. He came back and said \"oh mah gawwwddddd those lions are so rude\" etc. No sympathy was given and I think he was told to miss the next tour because he had to go and wash the lion piss off his body and leave his clothes in his car.\n\nWhen we saw the lion a few hours later, he was proudly sat atop a tree stump. He was the most gentle at taking food from us and once he'd eaten, wandered off somewhere else and fell asleep. \n\nSadly the lion passed away recently due to old age, but I'll forever remember seeing his tail go up and that accurate squirt of pee. \n\nBefore the tldr - this is not a prison or anything cruel to the animals. This place is a registered charity and do their best to re-house cats that have either been abused by circuses etc, or otherwise wouldn't survive in the wild. They work alongside other worldwide animal shelters and charities too, and when we visited they had just taken in a cheetah from North America that needed some time to settle before they'd let it see humans.\n\nTLDR: I went to an animal sanctuary where someone didn't respect the animals. A lion took affront to his disrespect and pissed on him.",

        "text": "So I was working in private health care facility about two years ago. I had been working a receptionist for around six months when my new boss was hired. He seemed like a nice enough guy and we'd been with out a manager for a long while so as a team we were looking forward to having someone being the head of the department and communicate with other departments on our behalf so we were able to get on with our work. \n\nAt this job there was a 12 month probationary period and at around 6 months I started getting ill. My immune system was really low flu here, tonsillitis there list goes on and when these things happened I called in sick. \n\nWhen it hit the end of year meeting to tell me if I'd passed probation I was sent an email invite to a location for the meeting \"the hallway\". I blinked a few times wondering why is this meeting in the hallway and not in an office? Either way I accepted as what else could I do really? I make my way out into the hallway where I am told that i have not passed my probation and this will be last day due to my sickness.\n\nNow I understand sickness can you get fired if there is enough of it what I couldn't understand is why my boss wasn't accompanied by a member of HR and why this was happening to me in a hallway. \n\nAfter looking into my employment rights it became quite obvious that I had been treated unfairly. So I did what anyone would do. I opened a case against them sighting unfair dismissal and after 3 months of them paying me my full wages I won. \n\nI was asked what I wanted the outcome to be after winning and I stated I wanted to return to my job the look on my bosses face when I returned that day was priceless. \n\nUpon returning HR were far more involved than before as you can imagine and insisted on setting up a meeting between myself, them, my boss and a \"medical professional\" to address the amount of time I had been off sick. \n\nIn the meeting I was told in no uncertain terms that I could not take time off due to sickness. I asked what if I am truly to unwell to come into work? Their reply was as follows \"if it were a disability such as multiple sclerosis we would be happy to assist to you however it seems to be a weakened immune system therefore you must make every effort\".\n\nIronically at this moment I was actually losing the sensation in my legs at the time I thought this could be stressed related as I had just returned to a job that fired me in a hallway but can you guess what is it was? Oh yes it was... I was having a multiple sclerosis attack my first. \n\nLater that evening the numbness spread up into my chest and for 2 weeks after this I was on respiratory ward wondering if I'd have a job when I returned. \n\nOnce I left the hospital I had some problems with my balance and was unable to walk properly for a further 3 months. But the moment I got my formal diagnosis you bet I called my boss and said \"so its multiple sclerosis guess you can assist me after all\" thinking that's right buddy you're stuck with me now!\n\nI only spent another six months in the job after all that mostly because I didn't trust anyone to deal with my case. But I did enjoy watching my boss walk on egg shells that entire time.",

Ben gets quieter and quieter. girls who he made cry in the past openly mocking him. i am leaving the school at the end of the year because my parents are moving and i forget Ben.\n\nabout 18 years later i am attending a school reunion. Ben is also there. i have no bad blood. everybody is very friendly to me, i guess because i am living as an artist and have a good follower count, additional i am coming from another city just to be there at the reunion. but the former clique is still mocking Ben. and apparently they are still hanging out with him and are a clique. as he is outside smoking they tell me what a loser he is. it is obvious that they have dysfunctional mechanics going on and Ben is their punching bag. i think to myself \"wow, you all didnt grow up. this is insteresting, but surreal dumb.\"\n\nnow another 15 years later, i skip all the school reunions which are taking place every 5 years, but i  still get the invitations per email. i google some names. i find Ben and his facebook. i see his adresse in google. i am not sure if my memory is correct. i go to google maps and use the street viewer, and yes, i remembered correct: he still lives in the 20 square meter garden shed his parents build 30years ago. his status is single and he got a shitty job. i guess there is a good chance i broke his spirit.",

        "text": "I recently moved into a new apartment.  When getting things set up before hand, the building manager told me most of the tenants get along and are openly friendly but that *some* have issues that they deal with in a very loud way. It seemed a kind gesture to give a head's up there might be some unpleasantness, no worries. \n\nI met most of the neighbors right away and thought it was astounding how bonded they were. Especially when compared to my last neighbors, this place was a dream. \n\nSeveral of them were upfront about which unit was the bad apple and the things they had to endure, such as screaming, pretending she was being beaten, drugs, strange men (its a secure building), and supposed animal abuse. \n\nBecause these incidents usually happened outside city quiet hours she would ignore the police when they responded to calls from the other tenants or would scream through the closed door that she was okay and didn't need help, so there isn't much the police can do about her disruptive behavior. They can only advise we contact the landlord/building manager after each incident until there's enough complaints to be able to evict her. \n\nI didn't move in with much so the apartment was largely empty and sound carried quite a bit. The unit i moved into was also unoccupied for several months before i moved in. So at first i could understand her frustration with new sounds, but i wasnt going to be silenced by some snatch stomping on my ceiling because there's kids over. One of my friends who visited at first had little ones and was also a survivor of abuse, so the sudden angry stomping would trigger her anxiety when she came over. \n\nI did try talking to her about two weeks after moving in (she and i are both reclusive, communication was through the manager) but she started screaming through the door about how she has a right to peace in her home and throwing herself around her apartment immediately without listening to me speak at all. \n\nThe next weekend, i got my things from my storage unit and was wonderfully happy to find my subwoofer. I like loud music and heavy bass and not having to listen to mentally ill control freak psychopaths who think they have the authority to silence me by stomping. \n\nShe woke me up the next morning with her crazy, so i decided to be a nice neighbor and allow her to heal in her own way by playing my music loud enough to cover her thrashing and top of her lungs screaming. \n\nThe best part of that day was Doja Cat \"Boss Bitch\". The neighbor stomped/punched the floor several times in quick succession which was followed by nearly identical bass beat. \n\nI could hear her screaming on the phone with the building manager about my music (felt so sorry for the manager) making all kinds of threats to report me to all kinds of agencies and it made me smile that much more. \n\nSadly, my sub was already on its way out, but it survived for another couple of weeks of grand concerts. \n\nShe's been quiet for a few weeks but has started up with the stomping again when she hears me in my apartment. Time for a new sub. \n\n\nTL;DR: Crazy neighbor beats on my ceiling, so i cover the noise with music which pisses her off even more, learns she's not the only one capable of being loud and no one is going to stop me.",

I moved from London to Southampton in year 9. My science teacher at my new school seemed ok, but he was only there for 4 weeks before going off sick with bronchitis. It was later diagnosed as chronic so he needed to take early retirement. In the meantime they had a lab technician man the classroom and would basically have us copying out of textbooks. I asked when we could do practicals, but the lab technician wasn't insured to do that, so we were stuck copying from textbooks.\n\nScience was one of my favourite subjects at school but, as someone who had at the time undiagnosed ADHD, copying from textbooks was not the way to educate me. \n\nSo come april time and the run up to the newly instated key stage 3 exams, I'm absolutely bored with the zero stimulation. I'm being disruptive and so the technician sends me out of class.\n\nI'm standing in the corridor when the head of science comes stomping up to me.\n\nHer: what are you doing out here?\n\nMe: I've been sent out miss.\n\nHer: and what damage is that going to do for your key stage 3?\n\nMe: *maintaining eye contact* probably nowhere near as much damage as not having a proper science teacher for the entire year.\n\nShe spluttered, went red in the face, realising that she didn't have a leg to stand, stormed away.\n\nIt still makes me chuckle to this day.",

        "text": "I’ve been working as an underwriter for several years. I evaluate loans that are submitted through the queue. I also forward some loan applications (apps) to senior underwriters should applicants apply for a higher amount. Part of our expectations as underwriters is to decide on at least 3 apps each hour. If we do not meet this request then we are put on warnings and are subject to being fired.\n\nI work alone with another underwriter on Sundays. He let me know that he was very low on his decisions per hour and in the spirit of cooperation - and because my numbers are always well above that due to experience - I ask him how many apps he’d like to work out of the main queue and it is first come first served for apps. At first he was appreciative of the help and would let me know how much he was going to do and I’d be sure to leave the apps for them.\n\nA month ago - he IMd me and told me to stop asking him how many apps he was going to do that day as he was feeling micromanaged. I let him know that I was just trying to help him meet his numbers and that I was only asking to make sure I didn’t get in the way. He told me to stop communicating with him and to just work the queue. (I made sure to document the conversation should there be any backlash for my petty revenge.)\n\nFrom that day on - I just used my experience to my advantage and claimed as many apps as I could. On a normal Sunday there is around 150 apps. Under our arrangement before - I did half of them and left the other 75ish for him. The queues and how intense the applications can vary which is why I’d always communicate with him. After that - I did as many apps as I felt I could while still being accurate as that is another thing we are judged on. \n\nFor the last 3 Sundays the amount of apps the other  underwriter did has gone down to around 20 apps each Sunday due to how fast and accurately I was able to get through the rest of the queue. I also stopped answering his questions in the chats and said that I was too busy working to answer his questions.\n\nHe is now on a verbal warning - and he is too prideful to tell me he was wrong or apologize - so I’m keeping course. I was able to change shifts and no longer work Sundays due to how good my numbers look so I will no longer have to work with him alone on Sunday. I still refuse to answer his questions the other days of the week we work. I have not been approached by my management for my behavior and have only been praised on my work thus far.",

This was just last night. \n\nThe characters: Seat D (aisle), middle aged man, average in every way (I assume); Seat E, my chubby self; Seat F (window), pleasant larger guy who did use a bit of \"my seat\" (which was fine, this flight was under $100 and is not forever).\n\nSeat D, who we'll call Dick for this story, became fidgety and started sighing loudly when we were delayed on the tarmac. No problem, Dick probably felt frustrated. \n\nThen, he took a selfie that included the whole row. Eh Dick a bit weird, whatever. So I did look at his phone, he's sending this pic to ppl complaining about how fat myself and \"Frank\" were. Eh. Life must be hard for Dick. \n\nThen I pulled out some hard candy (bc I'm fat, obvi, only fat ppl eat candy obvi). So he put his phone where I could see it, and typed \"now the fat girl is getting her candy out\". Ok Dick. Settle down. In the glance I got to see other texts describing how I was spilling into his seat. Incorrect but clearly life is hard for Dick.\n\nSo then I said, \"you know, if you're unhappy with your seat, bc I'm too fat for you, you can ask a flight attendant to move you :)\" (all smiles, for real). \n\nDick said nothing, did nothing, but the fidgets and sighs stopped. He kept texting but out of my sight.\n\nFast forward to the middle of the flight, Dick's snoozing, head flopped back, mouth open. So I took a picture of this gift to mankind. He slept until the last 20 min of the flight. \n\nIn the last 20 min, I edited the hell out of this photo, but in the pettiest way. No horns or anything. Just decorated the border with different flowers, then decided no, erased, did different deco. For 20 min. He's just watching but didn't say anything. So I tried some various captions, like \"fat women scare me\" \"touching fat women makes me feel yucky inside\" etc. I also verbally consulted with Frank about my choice of flower stickers. \n\nDick turns in his seat and faces the aisle. I didn't see his face again, ever, bc he stayed like that till he could get off and I had to get my coat from above.  But I'll always have the memories. \n\nNice meeting you Dick.",

        "text": "It's been many years, but stumbling across this sub made me think of the time when I was my most petty - my first roomie in college. \n\nWe were matched by the university a fact that's left me wondering how their match making process worked. \n\nWe chatted a few times before college started and I made a \"huge mistake\" during one of those phone calls - when asked \"if I partied\" I said \"not a big drinker but I don't judge\" because that was, in fact, the truth. College Roomie decided then and there I was awful, boring, and she hated me. I had no clue until a few weeks into our room mate adventure. \n\nIt started small, but Things started to deteriorate about a month in - she was constantly using my shit, bringing random dudes into the room, being disrespectful at every twist and turn. I had really reached my breaking point. \n\nSo first petty revenge: letting her boyfriend know how Chlamydia actually works. \n\nA fun fact about college Roomie was she had a boyfriend who was still in high school back home. College Roomie was committed to this relationship, and also excited to explore new ones. I didn't care, not my business. But then came the \"Chlamydia calls\". College Roomie had gotten her first STI and had to let boyfriend know since they had seen each other since. She went on and on about how it's \"going around the dorm\" and \"everyone was catching it because they don't clean the toilet seats enough\", and this brilliantly stupid man just accepted this as fact and kept it moving. \n\nAfter a particularly rough fight with, I snuck her boyfriend's # from her phone and had a mutual friend start texting him links to Chlamydia info. Most important - websites that really emphasized the only way you can catch this STI is sex and in fact toilet seats could never. \n\nThe fight they had was spectacular. I was so fortunate it happened when I was in the room. They fought for hours, she was unable to convince him of her innocence. They actually worked it out but then broke up months later after another act of petty revenge took shape (he was such a glorious idiot) \n\nNext up: the AIM catfish. \nCollege Roomie was deeply invested in using my laptop, despite having her own computer. I would come back to the room often and find my laptop moved or see her username on AIM when I'd go to login. I was broke as a joke and knew if she fucked up my laptop I'd be super boned so it was a big issue for me. \n\nWe fought for months about it, it didn't matter, she kept using it. \n\nSo petty revenge it was. \n\nI lucked out one day as she had yet again forgotten to log out of her AIM account (does this post age me? Lol) \nI got to work, and posing as college Roomie, started sending messages to all her contacts. \n\nTo her boyfriend, I admitted to cheating and told him I was just \"too committed to slutting it up to commit\" and \"id prob be better off single\" and he broke up with her via IM. \n\nTo her friends, I started checking in, poking for info, and trying to figure out how to do maximum damage. One friend did the work for me and replied with \"are you still going to OUR FRIEND party and if so, are you still down to go half in on the gift?\" \n\nBy the end of this Convo, college Roomie had offered to be DD, drive everyone to the party, buy the entire gift, and stay the night  to handle clean up the next day. \n\nThen we waited for the blow back. A\n\nThe first phone call she had with boyfriend after this was hilarious, she had no idea she had been dumped. \n\nThe birthday blowup was a slow burn, but such a good one. \n\nWeeks later, I walked by her downstairs crying to one of the RAs about how she had been \"hacked\"  and the hacker had absolutely ruined the plans she had for a friend's birthday and now all her friends were mad at her. \n\nShe flunked out of college after the first semester, I ended up with an even worse roomie but who at least was awful in very different ways, and my days of petty roomie revenge are long behind me.",

However, a middle aged woman and an older man get out of the car. No child. They had seen me and clearly planned their response if questioned. I go over:\n\nMe: 'Hi, this is a space for people with children.'\n\nThem, in unison: 'Yes, we are here to pick them up!'\n\nMe: 'That just isn't true, is it.'\n\nWoman: laughs and starts walking away\n\nMe: 'You are a total cunt.'\n\nWoman: Looks over her shoulder and smiles.\n\nShe smiles cause she knows there's nothing I can do.\n\nMy family and I go inside to shop. I see them once but they scurry away when they see me. When we come out, their car is still in the spot and I'm still mad.\n\nI have a toddler and a baby, so there's one thing I always have in my bag: Sudocrem nappy rash cream. It's thick, it's greasy, it sticks to your hands. Nightmare.\n\nI dig my finger right into that gloop and begin wheeling my trolley back to the bay. As I pass, I wipe the entire blob along the inside of her car door handle. On my way back, I swiftly make sure it is not visible. We leave.\n\nI didn't need to stay to watch. Just the thought of her getting back to her car and getting her hand covered in that is enough to make me smile.\n\nThe best part? If she did have children, she would be carrying wet wipes and would have no problem removing it. \n\nMerry Christmas!\n\n\n\n\n(I will just point out that no children, mine or otherwise, were in earshot when I called her a cunt).",

Honk at me in the drive through? You get 5 penny's when I could give you a Nickle. Customers often claimed they ordered a larger drink size when they in fact had not and I had to correct it anyway.  So I took a large cup, packed it to capacity with ice, then poured the amount of drink from the medium size so they still wound up with just a medium drink. I would also top it off with just water sometimes.  Another time a lady was incredibly rude in telling me she wanted no receipt, so you better believe it was in the bag.",

        "text": "First time poster, long time lurker.  I don’t permit this being posted elsewhere.\n\nI don’t know if this counts for this subreddit, but I always think about it when reading stories here.  Note:  I suck at grammar/am dyslexic even if English is my first language, so sorry if this doesn’t make much sense.\n\nI was a little $h!t when I was a kid.  I got my older sibling in trouble all the time, may it be sliding things under their bedroom door or being annoying to the point to make my sibling yell and *they* get in trouble for yelling at *me*.  To this day, I will confess for doing something to our mother, and she will instantly call my older sibling to apologize.  I’m talking about events from over thirty years ago still coming to light, and our mother going “You did what?  Oh no…”  I had undiagnosed issues, but still not an excuse.  I think when I’m on my elderly death bed, I’ll still be remembering my little sibling crimes and my sibling going, “See!  I TOLD you!”\n\nHowever, this “petty revenge” was not one of those confession moments.\n\nMy sibling finally had a “straw that broke the camel’s back” moment when they were in high school and me in elementary school.  Their bus home got home before mine.  I don’t know what snapped that day (too long ago), but they finally approached our mother and complained they always got in trouble for a messy room, and I didn’t.  They were definitely messy, but what teenager wasn’t, you know?  Our mother was picky about our rooms.\n\nAccording to the story, my sibling gave our mother a laundry list of how I was not punished for the same things they got in trouble with, but because of my age, I could get away with so much while they got lectured and punished.  Our mother stated she didn’t allow me to go unpunished and will prove it:  as soon as I got home, I will have to clean my dressers that usually had clothes and other items spilling out and not folded.\n\nI get home and get rimmed for my messy dresser.  Like, my head hung in shame while getting a comprehensive lecture about everything I must fix in my bedroom.  My sibling sat on the couch, beaming at the dressing down.  Finally!  They truly believed I was getting my comeuppances.  Mom pointed me to my room and demanded I clean up and must have it completed to get dinner.  (I wouldn’t starve or anything, just got a timetable so I wouldn’t drag my feet.)\n\nNow, something about how I stored my belongings.  Since a toddler, any money I got would go into the top drawer.  I used to save all my cash from birthdays and holidays because that’s where my mother suggested.  My sibling, being a teen, would spend their cash while hanging out with friends.  I was an introvert and never left the house.\n\nThose ten brief minutes of revengeful glory must have gone to my sibling’s head.  Smile ear-to-ear knowing ­they *finally* had their moment.  Ha ha!  Lil sibling got in trouble for all their shenanigans!\n\nBut I had the last laugh.  Unintentionally…  Once again, I was I still a little $h!t without trying.\n\nTen minutes later, I come out of my bedroom, beaming.  “Hey, Mom!  Look at what I found!”  In my hand is two crisp twenty-dollar bills.  “Can we go shopping?!”\n\nMy sibling’s eyes widen, seeing how much money I have.  “You got to be kidding me!”  They stomped their bedroom, while I am I telling our mother how I found even *more* money shoved in the back of my top drawer.  Our parent burst out laughing, making the backfire revenge that much sweeter. \n\nI didn’t learn until many years later why I had to clean my messy dresser that day.  I spent my rediscovered money at the arcade and won big prizes, just adding more salt to the already huge wound.  All the while, my sibling never again tried to enforce comeuppances and simply waits for my next confession about being a little torturing turd.\n\nSibling, my bad.  Thanks for putting up with my behind.",

I was already growing disillusioned with the relationship, being long distance, but the final straw that made me dlnot want to work on the relationship anymore came when my ex told me he wanted to move in with his ex girlfriend.\n\nShe lived in an abusive household and he wanted to get her out, so they started to look around at apartments in the city. I told him that I wasn't going to make the decision for him whether he moved in with her or not, hoping he'd realize how wrong it was, but after a week he said he'd found a place and I broke it off with him. I wouldn't have been able to live with the idea that he lived with his ex while I was so far away.\n\nHe texted me a few days after asking if he could have back the hoodie I took. I just blocked him and moved on with my life. He tried to contact me for awhile afterwards through my friends, but they all thankfully blew him off.\n\nI wish him well. I hope he's doing fine, but the hoodie is mine now and I'm at a point now almost 2 years later where the association between him and the hoodie is starting to go away. But sometimes I look at it before I put it on and smile thinking about it. I'd wanted this particular hoodie since the first time I saw it anyway.",

        "text": "I'm chugging along to the car wash, doing just over the limit through a residential and business street lined with restaurants and stores.  Some mouthbreather comes flying up behind me in a Lexus doing at least 40 and honks for me to do the same as I try to negotiate through people parking and exiting their cars with other drivers approaching in the oncoming lane.  We're pretty much a block away from the car wash, which we both end up turning into.  Why he felt the need to save 10 seconds is beyond me, though he's probably the type who thinks every second spent in his car is 100 dollars wasted.  \n\nI'm getting ready for a busy Saturday, so I'm not in the mood to have him behind me in the wash queue.  The queue formed two lines since everyone washes on the weekend, so I deferred him to the side that would put him ahead of me.  The queue exiting the wash also forms two lines with their own set of attendants to hand dry the cars once they're out.  His car comes out at The End of the second line, while mine goes up right in front of the exit since the first line has been cleared out.  The two cars in front of his were big SUVs, so that line's attendants had to spend extra time drying them before they got to his, while my car got its drying started as soon as it came to a stop.  And since this is a busy street, Mouthbreather now has me and two other cars waiting to turn into a street with busy pre-noon traffic.  I hope he was happy he got ahead of me.  \n\nTLDR; Mouthbreather is impatient to get his car washed, I don't want to deal with him and let him ahead of me.  Through no fault or intention on my part, I end up exiting ahead of him since there are two queues in the exit.  He now has 3 cars ahead of him trying to get out into the street when he could have been ahead of all of them.  \n\nAddition: I guess that isn't really revenge since I didn't intend for my action to negatively affect him, but it felt just as sweet as if it had been actual Petty Revenge (I guess that's God or the universe dishing it out depending on what you believe in).",

Then, make a list of everything that they love about themselves.

Everything along those lines. At the end, say “the one good thing you had going for you was that you are loyal.” \n\nIt will destroy them emotionally. They’ll be thinking about it forever and you come out on top. And it is the most petty and beautiful form of revenge.",

        "text": "For the unfamiliar, my partner bought some motion-activated sprinklers (dubbed the Robo-Sprinklers) for the front garden to help us with a nosy neighbour problem, as suggested by this sub. This nosy neighbour – nicknamed the Bucket Woman, after Hyacinth Bucket (“It’s Bouquet”) haunts the [untenanted rental property next door](https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/urzb70/neighbourhood_dispute_started_over_grass_and_bins/). No, she’s not dead, if she were we could call in an exorcist. She just hangs around to keep an eye on the empty property, and complains a lot. She’s fixated on bins, grass, snakes, and [our interior decor](https://www.reddit.com/user/HokeyPokeyGuestList/comments/xkm3cx/bucket_woman_v_our_taste_in_furnishings_wtf/). \n\nAfter [extensive testing](https://www.reddit.com/user/HokeyPokeyGuestList/comments/wi23yd/it_takes_a_village_to_install_a_motion_activated/), Martin and some of his friends set up the sprinklers so that anyone crossing the garden beds would get squirted, but if visitors stick to the paths, they will stay dry. Our family and friends know this, but for visitors, there is a sign asking people to respect our garden and keep to the paths. (The sign was a “thank you for having us” present from my brother and his wife.)\n\nWell today the Robo-Sprinklers claimed another victim. Next door to us on the other side is up for sale (disappointing, I know), and today it’s open for inspection. All well and good. Except we’re expecting one of Martin’s gardening mates, “Robbo”, to bring over some plants for the front garden, and there’s nowhere to park in the street. So Martin texted Robbo that we’d leave the gate open so he could back into the driveway and unload. (We knew we were taking a risk, but we have to live our lives too.)\n\nNow I have to admit, I was asleep for most of this, but according to my partner, he heard one of the Robo-Sprinklers go off and headed for the door, ready to tell his mate to “Stop mucking around with the sprinklers, the baby’s asleep!”\n\nInstead, he saw a complete stranger standing in our driveway, confused and a bit soggy. Just like the brochure he was clutching. \n\nMartin said he glared at the man, pointed to the sign, and then pointed towards next door. The guy left, looking a bit sheepish and wet. \n\nWhen New Human and I came out of the bedroom, we could hear the sound of laughter, and two grown men impersonating [Bill Lawry](https://youtu.be/V3h8SAjxQPw): “Got him! Oh, he’s gawwwn”. Martin and Robbo were in the office, watching the security footage. The Robo-Sprinkler’s victim came into our driveway, and was looking at next door. Then he started backing up onto the garden bed, nearly standing on the sign, until he crossed Robo-Sprinkler 2’s sensor and got squirted in the back. The guy jumped in the air, looked around to see what just hit him, and then Robo-Sprinkler 2 got him a second time. Then the guy ran for the driveway, where Martin found him. \n\nMartin and I both hope this guy doesn’t end up buying next door. And we both agree that watching motion-activated sprinklers in action never gets old. \n\nSo the list of the Robo-Sprinklers’ known victims now includes: Max, the neighbours’ cat; [the Bucket Woman](https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/wox86r/bucket_woman_v_robosprinkler/); various unknown people who were rummaging through a rubbish skip in our driveway; [the Bucket Woman again](https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/xjsmvu/bucket_woman_v_the_snakes_and_robosprinkler_again/); and now the guy who is hopefully not going to be our next door neighbour. (An anonymous online reviewer also says the sprinklers are effective against possums and his mother-in-law.) Not to mention the legion of family and friends who have set them off deliberately.\n\nMartin wants me to say you are all bad influences and he’s having way too much fun with the Robo-Sprinklers.",

        "text": "My husband is a great guy, but he has an annoying habit that occasionally surfaces and drives me nuts. He is a lawyer and therefore has developed an argumentative style of conversing. If he wants to share his opinion on something, he tends to do it in a way that makes it sound like he’s correcting me or like his the expert on the topic, even when I objectively know more. This isn’t usually on serious things- often just chit chat. It’s annoying. \n\nThe most recent example of this was when we were talking about our neighborhood on the phone with his parents. They asked about holiday decor and I said that most of the neighborhood decorated for Christmas. He immediately said that it’s less than half the houses. This is totally false and I have no idea where he came up with that. I asked and he made up something about how it has declined over the past couple years… we’ve only lived her for three. So tonight while my teen and I were Delivering a gift to a neighbor, we counted. Only 17 of the 95 houses in the neighborhood Aren’t decorated. That means that 82% of the neighborhood is decorated. Way more than half. I sent him a text (he’s at a holiday work party) teasing him about how I was right (with laughing emojis- neither of us care about this, it’s light hearted). He responded “&lt;my name&gt; for the win!”\n\nNot so much revenge as validation, but I might just have to remind him of this next time he tries to “correct” me about something I know that I know more about.

I never really minded if he put them back and refilled them if emptied.\n\nFor some reason tho he never put the stapler back in place and always left it in the middle of the desk.\n\nI told him that if he took it he should put it back. He said “ok“ and didn’t put it back the next time either.\n\nI confronted him again and he said: “you know, things don’t always need to be so tidy and I wanted to leave some work for you“. I spitefully remembered this sentence, it etched i to my brain.\n\nCome Christmas time my colleague started shopping for trees again. For some reason he is super nit-picky when it comes to trees and they literally need to be perfect. It’s like a tick he has and he can’t help it, it’s almost comical. \n\nUsually he finds a tree that’s as close to perfect as it gets and then trims it to perfection at home.\n\nAfter a week of searching he finally found THE tree, trimmed it to perfection and talked about it for about an hour at work. \n\nI found an excuse to go over to his place. We had dinner and when he wasn’t in the room I clipped a branch off the tree in a way that it was noticeable, but not without inspection.\n\nThe next day at work he ranted about how his kids messed up the tree and he had to spend 2 hours correcting it. Mind you: it was already decorated, lol.\n\nI simply went: “Oh Alex, that wasn’t your kids, but you know…things don’t always need to be so tidy and I wanted to leave some work for you :)“\n\nI still have the branch and it definitely will be part of the decoration this year.\n\nTL;DR: messed with my Christmas tree crazy colleagues Christmas tree because he left my workplace untidy and was snarky about it",

        "text": " \n\nI was about 7 when I moved to my current home town. Ever sense I have started school this one kid named connor immeditally started picking on me.\n\nFirst, backstory. When I was a kid I was exposed to death at a very young age. My grandmother died when I was 8 months old. Most people I told about this dont understand why I am so hurt because of this. I also dont understand but thats just how life goes. I had cronic anxiety, and often thought people were being mean to me when they were not. I only ever stopped crying of this death when I was eleven.\n\nWhen I was 9 and attending school, about twice a week (once a week if im lucky) I would go underneath my desk and start having a panic attack. Connor would shame me for this while im in the middle of a panic attack and I would cry harder. Ive been in therapy sense I was 9 and connor didnt help my mental state. This would continue up to 11 years of age, when I finally stopped having panic attacks.\n\nMain story:\n\nGym was my second to last class of the day, naturally everyone was tired and grumpy before opening the doors. I get through gym class but I am very tired due to playing basketball the entireity of the period. Next to the boys locker room door, there is a water fountain. I am second in que and when the person using the water fountain moves aside and I aproch the water fountain. Conner butts infront of me, and I grab him by the scruff of his shirt and forcefully move him to the side. While I approach the water fountain Connor grabs me by my arm and throws me to the ground. Im on the floor and Connor is standing infront of me laughing. I do not react and go back to the water fountain thinking \"If this kid touches me I swear to fucking god I am going to rock his shit\" . While I am mid sip Connor tried to do the same thing to me and pull me away by the scruff of my shirt. I whip around so fact and slap him in the face releasing all the built up pain he has caused me over the years. The next thing I know I see his glasses flying off his face and I hear everyone screaming in disbelief. He backs up and says \"Do you want to go?\". I say no cause I dont think he wants to and there is blood dripping down his nose. I am told by the teachers to sit down near the bleachers while they get him to the nurse. They finally let me go into the locker room to change and I am reciving fist bumps left and right while everyone is prasing me.\n\nPresent day: (3 years later)\n\nHis masulinity is still hurt and he has told me mulitple times to end my life. On multiple accasions he has tried to get me to fight him. I decline every single time because I am built like the stickbug from Bugs Life and he is built like the ladybug from Bugs Life.",

To be completely upfront, I don’t really get along with my mother-in-law, but this was absolutely brilliant by her, and she absolutely won this day.\n\nWe’re at a beach resort that has little palm tree huts up and down the beach, people usually drop their stuff to reserve their little hut and either sleep in a little more, or go eat breakfast and then come back. Shade is at a premium, so we wake up early cause I burn easily and we want to avoid the sun. 7:00am, we (the six of us) drop our stuff in two huts side by side (two huts will accommodate six people with adequate shade), and then go eat breakfast. We come back around 8:00am, lo and behold, our stuff from one hut has been unceremoniously thrown on a couple of beach chairs in the sun and been taken by a couple who shrugs when my father-in-law confronts them.\n\nI’m pissed. There are kids around, I’m on vacation, but it was all I could not to drag this douche bag out of our spot (I played sports growing up, work out daily, and I’m bigger than most everyone I meet). My wife and her mother say it’s no big deal, it’s cool, do they mind if we share the hut with them, so we can still sit next to each other? The couple says yes, I’m still incensed, but whatever. Cue petty revenge….\n\nMy mother-in-law and sisters boyfriend proceed to take the shady part of the hut, as it’s early in the morning it’s not a big deal, douche bag couple are enjoying the morning sun which is quite pleasurable. The day continues, the sun gets hotter, and douchebag couple doesn’t have room to move into the shade. Noon rolls around, the couple leaves to go eat lunch, and my MIL/SBF move their chairs slightly further into the sun while giving themselves a little more shade. 15 minutes later it’s clear they’re uncomfortable being baked completely in the oppressive sun, while MIL/SBF are cool in the shade. They grab their shit and go. \n\nCrisis adverted. I didn’t have to kick any ass, and I gained a whole new level of respect for my MIL.",

There will be grammatical errors and I will be to lazy to correct them.\n\nI used to work at the reception of a 4 star hotel in Paris. A decent part of our client base are here for business. They usually stay one to three night a week every week or month.\nThis particular day around 6 pm my coworker went for a smoke. Leaving me at the front desk by myself. And I got a phone call so I answered it. While I was on the phone a regular guest arrives. Seeing him I salute him with a nod to which he replied with the same. And got back to my call. Etiquette would have me put the call on hold, but I was closing the deal and already collecting important data (credit card details), so I decided to finish the call and then take care of my guest.\nMy colleague came back and start taking care of him.  I hung up somewhat 30 second after she came back.\n\nAnd here goes the guest saying that I left him to wait 10 minute without even greeting him.\nThe call history read \"on call for 5 min\" and when this fucker arrived I was already over 3 minute into it.\n\nNow let's get some context about this respectable piece of shit.\nHe and his colleague never made the reservation themselves, there equally horrible assistant did it for them. Always contesting pricing or method of payment even when there was a contract with the hotel for a short period (we ended the contract later on). Needless to say that I was fed up with these people.\n\nHere comes the petty revenge : out of the 87 room we had 24 classic room sized around 15 square meters. Except for one that is 11. \n\nI gave him that night this very small room the smallest in the whole hotel. And for the next 3 year I work there everytime his name came up I would put him there. Even if to do it I had to juggle the rooming for 2 hours. Me working there he would never see another room. Even after covid and not seeing him for 1 year I didn't forget that one lie and kept giving him the small room.\n\n\nTldr : rude guest lied about my work and got the smallest room for the 3 following years",

A group of us finally got to the front of a long line to get into a nightclub and security would not let one of my friends in because he didn't meet the dress code. \n\nThe rest of us proceeded to go inside without him and carry on with our night. About 30 minutes later the club started to smell (worse than normal!) and there were brown specs all over the place. After a few minutes the music stopped, the lights turned on and we all had to evacuate the club.\n\nIt turns out that my friend didn't like the fact he was rejected entry for such a petty reason, so he climbed on to the roof of the club and did a shit in the air conditioning vent, which was chopped up by the fan and dispersed like a literal shit blizzard throughout the whole club, forcing it to close hours earlier than it should have. This act became a bit of a legendary tale for years to come and to this day there are only a handful of people who know the identity of the infamous nightclub shitter.",

        "text": "\nSo to give context. I was with my ex, lets call her dick, for a good while and i hated every moment of it tbh. Dick was extremely EXTREMELY jealous of everything to the point that dick would try to cover my eyes to not see other girls on tv and she strictly only wanted to watch anime so she wouldn’t worry about my “gawking” at other girls. One time i was at work washing dishes, we worked together, and a coworker of ours came over to show me a picture of this girl hes going after. Not a revealing picture literally just an instagram pic of her fully clothed. Didn’t think much of it and barely even looked at it. The moment dick found out she went into a crying frenzy and it took i kid you not over 3 hours for her to stop and she was wanting to break up with me the entire time. Because a coworker showed me a picture of a random girl.\n\nThere were many more problems with us but that was the main big one that affected our everyday life non stop. I would be lucky if i went more than two days without being berated because she thought i looked at another girl. She even made me stop talking to my best friends sister who recently killed himself and who also lived across the entire country because she thought i might cheat on her with her.\n\nSo we eventually break up and it was not pretty. She legitimately tried killing me with a loaded gun and in defending myself i hurt her pretty bad. Everyone was saying i should fight the case but i knew it was her word against mine and no one sides with the man in a domestic abuse situation so i took a plea. A couple months in jail and a bit of probation. Really really fucking sucks. I thought of many different ways i can get back at her but never wanted to do any of them because i just want her gone. But recently I’ve been employing a tactic that seems to be working.\n\nSome more context. She lives with her family in a studio apartment above their garage, honestly not a bad place but nothing is enough for her, and hates it. We always talked about living off grid in a tiny home with lots of area for her dogs to run around, having solar and wood heating and it was her one dream to become a carpenter and work with wood and for us to build our tiny home by ourselves. This is extremely unrealistic for her and myself at the time and was nothing more than distant goal we had. Before we broke up we both saved up 20k to put towards this but also for a van trip we were going to go on. And btw she stole lots of that from me when we broke up.\n\n i heard from a friend of ours she went on that trip after we parted and spent all of her money and is now working with another friend as a lifeguard. Dick always said she would hate to work as a lifeguard and would only do it if she absolutely HAD to do it.\n\nMe on the other am doing quite good. I moved back in with my parents and helped them build their house. Am working with my dad building cabins for a living and learning lots of valuable skills, skills she wanted to learn deeply. And on top of it i built a tiny house on their property far away from their house for extremely cheap because my dad and i milled all the materials and barely bought anything. I have dogs that can run freely and dont need to be chained or confined, which hers do and she hates it, and im saving money living off grid with solar panels powering what little electricity i use, and gravity fed water from one of the many springs on the property. I dont pay any taxes for it because its my parents property and only need to pay internet as a monthly bill because its wood heated. In essence im living the picture perfect life she and i always dreamed of and one she wanted more than anything in this world.\n\nSo I’ve been posting about it on social media like crazy to make sure shes sees it. I took a video tour and made it into a nice video with lofi music from her favorite anime and put it over it. Am posting pictures and captioning them how grateful i am to be living with so much property and open land for my dogs to run around. Bragging in every way i can about my situation all just to piss her off. And thats all i ever post. I’ve never been active on social media and she knows that so she definitely knows that im doing it just to rub it in. I thought she would have deleted me soon after i posted a couple times but she hasn’t.\n\nAccording to my friend whos still friends with her its driving her crazy and shes been getting more and more depressed the past month, which is when i started posting. So i know its working and im going to keep it up. \n\nFuck you dick.",

One of my spots is under the porch\n\nTwo weeks ago we had a storm and the snow wasn't too bad but enough to inconvenience you.\n\nMy neighbor had asked my girlfriend while she was outside if she could use my spot because she has to leave early in the morning and didnt want to clean off her car. Of course my girlfriend said yes and me not wanting to be an ass cause shes older(50's), let it go and parked in the neighbors spot.\n\nFast forward a week we have another storm start up while I was at work. Pulled a 12 hour day and came home to find her in my spot. Mind you every day after the time we told her she could park there, her car has been in her own spot but now that the snow is coming her car is there.. wow convenient right? It hadn't hit too bad and me being too tired I park in her spot and walk into the house. \n\nI told my girlfriend to please talk to her because I'm not a fan of her atm. She goes up and she apologizes and says it wont happen again.  \n\nNow here we are the following week. It's a Wednesday night and the snow is coming down like a madman. I get out of work at 9 and im heading home. I pull into my driveway to find my neighbor in my spot AGAIN. \n \nBy now the snow is almost a foot tall and I have to shovel out the neighbors spot so I can slide in and not get stuck. i had just worked another 12 hour shift, When I tell you I was livid.. boy I have never been so heated in my life (mixture of things but mostly the audacity of this woman)\n\nI walked over and let the air out of her back two tires completely down to the rim then walk inside.\n\nNext morning I woke up to the sounds of a triple a truck and my neighbor talking in the driveway. Had him check for nails, staples etc.. walked out to my car waved at the two of them.and drove my happy butt off to work.",

My brother arrived a couple days earlier due to his vacation schedule at work. I played tour guide. In the intervening years, he's gotten a bit out of shape. Now, I'm not about to run a marathon, but as we're walking around town I notice that he's breathing heavily, puffing away trying to keep pace. He asked me to slow down. I did, for a moment, but consistently throughout the day I kept ever so slightly increasing my pace. 30+ years petty, but revenge at last.",

Ladybugs eat about 19 thousand fleas and aphids a year .They eat around 60 fleas and aphids a day to be exact. X that by days = 21840 a year . Now X that by 3000 ladybugs . That’s over 65 million a year. Let’s just say they eat half that amount because their diet is shared with aphids . That would be about 2413 genocides on the flea population.

So years later in middle school I have a history teacher named ms dueñas, she was a good teacher but her ocd and anger issues weren’t a good mix and most of us hated her for that. She was actually a sweet lady so I regret doing this but at the age of 13 I thought this was hilarious. 7th grade I ask my dad to bring me a goose foot, he does, I take it to school the next day in a plastic bag in my backpack and show it to a couple kids I knew. Everyone thought wtf is wrong with you but it was pretty much just shock humor to everyone. Ms dueñas was in her classroom at lunch and there was a window about 8 feet up that was cracked open. Standing under the window one of the kids told me I should throw it through the window. At that age I didn’t like ms dueñas but I justified it by reminding myself of all the times she scared the living shit out of everyone when things weren’t perfect. So, I threw the frozen goose foot through the window and everyone bolted off while laughing. Followed by her scream of pure horror, the yard duties suspected it to be me but I almost got away with it until someone snitched on me. Do I regret it, yes. Was it petty revenge, kinda. I saw her years later at the dmv when I was getting my license and she was happy to see me, it seemed she forgot about the goose foot as much as I did and I gave her a hug and chatted it up before leaving. Ms dueñas, I’m sorry.",

        "text": "I used to own the townhome at the end of our building immediately next to an empty lot that was full of trees. The empty lot was a much lower grade and we had a 3-4 foot retaining wall built from stone that capped off our property about 3 feet before the property line.\n\nOne day, the trees started getting ripped out as it was clear someone intended to build. The process was slow. They hired two guys with a pickup to cut up all the trees and remove the debris. After about one year, they started bringing in dirt to better grade the property for building next to the street. They prepped 6 lots, right up to our property line.\n\nThis is where things took a turn. The team moving the dirt decided that they needed the grade to go higher than ours did, but they didn't want to do it properly. So they dumped pile after pile and used a small tractor. They crossed into our property with this dirt one day and when I saw it it was too late. The dirt was so high that they had completely covered our 3-foot gap between the property they were building on and ours AND completely covered our 3-4 foot retaining wall.\n\nI ran outside and started yelling at them to stop. The person turned off the tractor and brought out his supervisor. They told me they'd clean it up, but I said you have to stop now you are doing this wrong. They tried to tell me they would clean it up before the weekend so I let it go for the time being.\n\nFast forward to the weekend where they dug SOME of the dirt up, but not all. They left over half of it, and much of our retaining wall was still buried. They then BUILT A RETAINING WALL ON TOP OF IT on their side that was about 2 feet tall.\n\nI'd had enough. I took matters into my own hands. That weekend, I got out my shovel and started throwing the excess dirt into their property. But I specifically targeted digging out the area at the bottom of the retaining wall on my side of the property line. Creating a scenario where the wall they had built would almost certainly collapse with no support and loose dirt.\n\nAfter an hour of digging, I was approached by someone from the crew. They asked me to please stop and for my number for their boss. The boss called and asked what I want. They offered to plant some trees to better separate the property, but I held firm that the dirt needed to be removed, and the wall needed to be rebuilt. \n\nTwo days later a crew of 5 to 6 was out there removing the entire retaining wall for a two or three day project, digging out the dirt they added and resurfacing our retaining wall. Then they rebuilt their wall correctly about 4 feet tall. Had they not done this, I would have taken further action with the city to get this resolved, however, my approach felt more effective because I didn't have any photos of the area **before** they started dumping their dirt on my property.",

        "text": "I walk into the DMV like 5 minutes before it closes. This part is absolutely on me, I accept full blame. I understand that's a total asshole move, but it had been a rough couple days and I only needed to turn in one form. My number is called, and there is the bitchiest employee at the DMV. He's helped on more than one occasion and has never been anything but condescending and obnoxious, whether it's12:30 or 4:55. I'm not normally one to mess with customer service workers, I know how hard those jobs are, but seeing the way he treated me vs my boyfriend, I felt like it was ok just this once. I've never filed a civilian accident report and I had a few questions. After a few minutes of treating me like a child and me responding very coldly, he gets frustrated and asks \"Well, is everyone okay?\" \nHad he even looked at my form, he'd know the answer to that. \"No.\" I say harshly without even looking up. He looks to my boyfriend like he's begging him for a lifeline. My boyfriend just shrugs. I give him the form and he finally seems to see the check in the box next to 'FATAL'. That trip to the DMV had been my first car trip since the fatal pedestrian collision I was reporting. Needless to say, that shut him the fuck up. He spent the rest of the interaction trying to walk back the shit he was giving me earlier and getting weird looks from his coworkers. Pretty much nothing could make me feel better that day but that came damn close.",

        "text": "So this story was twenty-two years ago but I remember it very well. I was working at a large size toy store that is no longer around. I was hanging out with a friend at his house when a friend of his came over and she was in tears I worked with both of these people at the toy store. The girl who was crying was dating one of the managers at the store and they had just broken up. I spent all night consoling her(even though I really didn't like her) but apparently he was cheating on her and I felt bad for her. Anyway, the next day the manager called me at the store when I was working and chewed me out and fired me for \"telling lies.\" He could get away with it because the woman he was cheating with was the store manager (it was an open secret kind of thing). Now I don't recall mentioning what happened that night but I figured that I was fired so I walked out and tried to find a new job. Anyway I heard through the grapevine later that he was stealing PS2's and selling them to people out of the back of the store and pocketing the money himself. Well apparently that was something that his store manager girlfriend didn't know about and he got fired and she got demoted. Anyway a bit after this happened I ran into him at another toy store that he was looking for a job at. He starts talking to me like he and I were friends and it took all of my patience to not ring his neck then and there. Anyway I leave the store and I wait until he leaves and then I ask to speak to the manager at that store. I tell him exactly what happened at the store we both worked at. I don't know if what I did had any effect on his not getting hired there but I never saw him working there. What I do know is that he got a job at a new place and when I saw him working there, I found the store manager there and mentioned what happened at the other store. I never saw him working there again. Yes, it's petty but damnit it felt good.",

        "text": "Okay to start off I did this to my sisters' ex. An alcoholic, drug addicted scumbag who more than once seriously bordered domestic violence. I was over the moon when my sister finally left him for good. It's been a few months and he has a new gf, even though he also threatened my sisters' new bf when they first met (he was with that woman already at the time but definitely serious about the threats). Now I like to think I'm not a spiteful person but this man has hurt my sister emotionally, physically and financially and threatened the absolute sweetheart she is with now (No, I'm not into him he's just 100% a good guy and I'd love to see them married tbh) so naturally being the younger, crazier sister I am, I searched the internet to ruin his days. \n\nOnto the actual revenge part. So I found out you can send Jehovas witnesses to specific adresses and even leave phone noumbers so they can reach you if you're not home. Naturally that was the first course of action. Through Social-Media I deciphered a rough shape of what his days look like, when he get's off work, what he does on weekends etc. and chose the right time to tell them when to look for him. Then I dug a little deeper. One comment on here suggested making a donation to scientology in his name but I wasn't feeling like spending money on him so I instead decided to leave his email-adresse with them with the request to get help with drugs. I wish I could tell you what happened but I'm going to stay as far away as possible from him while continuing to repeat this process over and over. \n\nAlso just to clearify, this dude hates religion. So I'll sleep soundly knowing that he'll get annoyed by the one thing he tries to avoid",

        "text": "A year or two ago I purchased a pair of pants that my spouse really liked on me and she encouraged me to buy another pair or two. We couldn't find them in any local stores, but did find the manufacturer's website. The manufacturer is located in the Canadian province of Quebec and they offered free shipping within Quebec, but not to the rest of Canada, fine whatever. I am located in Ottawa, so not far from portions of Quebec.\n\nWhen I was filling out the web form to order the pants, I found out that they wanted about $30 to ship to Ottawa. I was trying to figure out if I could pick the pants up the next time I drove through Quebec, if I could have them shipped to someone just on the other side of the border, etc.\n\nWhile I was placing the order my spouse's BFF was over for a drink and when I told her, she just said have them shipped to her cottage, out in a small little town in the middle of no-where Quebec. Since she doesn't have a mailbox at the cottage all failed deliveries just go to the local post office, which she would pickup for me in the next couple of weeks. So I shipped them to her cottage.\n\nWhen I filled out the form I listed my Ottawa address as the billing address and my friend's cottage as the ship to address. Well a few days later my new pants arrived in Ottawa without being shipped to my friend's cottage. I guess they realized that shipping to a major centre in another province was going to be cheaper than no-where Quebec",
