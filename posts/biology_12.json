I wish to conduct my Undergraduate Research Project under the supervision of Professor Klaus Kesler. I would like to invite monolingual and bilingual participants to assist in my experiment which aims to assess perspective-taking and belief judgement in these two groups. The experiment in question requires individuals who are either: Monolingual English speakers; or Bilingual speakers of English and one other language to participate. The experiment consists of answering questions on a simulation on screen. It takes around 20 minutes for a participant to complete the experiment.\n\nParticipants must: Be the age of 18 or above and speak either just English fluently or English and one other language fluently.\n\nOnly information about age, gender, and performance will be collected. Results will be made anonymous\n\nIf you are interested, please feel free to private message me for more information",

Looking at Master's programs, I don't have confidence that I would be able to complete it due to financial trouble as well as not having the ability to maintain a 3.0 GPA, however I'm also not sure what I should be pursuing now. I've heard that just having a Bachelor's in Biology can get you upwards of $50,000, and while I'm still very entry level and looking to get a job just for experience right now, I'm looking for options as to what would be best to work towards. Teaching is an option with an 18 month course, however I'm not sure if that would be best for me. Looking for advice on what would be best with just a Bachelor's and what kind of money I would expect from it long term. Thanks in advance\\~",

While I found chemistry and cell courses interesting these topics are not something I really want to do for work (my first job out of uni was in a microbiology lab and I didn't enjoy the work).  \n\n\nOriginally, my plan had been to work in a national park, but I can't nudge my way into conservation no matter how many jobs I apply to. I have internship and volunteer experience and some really good connections but it hasn't lead to anything. Maybe it's because I only have a Bachelor's. The other thing is that I've also changed somewhat  since I got my degree. I know not all parks are this way, but I no longer want to live somewhere rural; I want to be in a city.   \n\n\nI will probably go to Master's in 1-2 years, and I don't know if I would like to continue down the biology pathway. The main reasons are that I really disliked labwork (since day 1 of undergrad tbh) and I don't enjoy doing research. The other path I've looked at is working in a zoo, and this is something I'm still interested (though, some of the horror stories about the long hours and the pay do scare me...).  \n\n\nI'd like to hear from other people with a biology undergraduate who then went onto Master's in something not related to biology. Or stories about people who had similar feelings and ended up sticking with bio and what happened.",

I am kinda conflicted in what field of Biology is currently needed that I should study.\nAnd I want to know if it's better to apply for an MS in Biology, or just go directly at the target field of study (e.g: Master's in Biotechnology).\nYour help is much appreciated and thank you for your time.",
