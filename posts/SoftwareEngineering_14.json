        "text": "I have an ongoing and losing debate with my product and software eng colleagues about this, and want to get some feedback here.\n\nI'm a PO on an internal software product at a huge company. We have an internal chat channel for customers with a few channels, but primarily General and Announcements.\n\nWhile we have been extremely clear with users that we do not do chat support and they must submit tickets (no team in IT provides general open-ended chat support unless staffed for it), users persist in blasting their complaints and airing their grievances about the product in the General channel, which has like 2000 people.\n\nTo me, this seems extremely rude and disrespectful especially when it's not just a misguided user with a specific complaint who didn't know tickets are how you get support. Sometimes users will put a literal laundry list of their issues, or @ someone especially me the PO, which I kinda view as public shaming. A couple of times it pissed me off so much I just deleted what I considered their rude comments, but it causes a whole shitstorm in my department with other managers who think the customer is always right or any feedback is good. I would strongly prefer we just shut down the channel or make it read only, because I feel the purpose is supposed to be building a community of users or mutual help among users learning. In the current form where users post more complaints than we post info, it just seems like it does little bit damage our reputation.\n\nA little about our users and product and why they're angry. Our users are stupid or lazy, and sometimes both. They think everything that goes wrong when at least 50% of the time it's user error or failure to read the fucking docs or email. They are data scientists, so extremely over hyped field and everyone and their mother is now a data scientist because they said so or a boot camp did, even if they can't even figure out the basics like how to install packages. But the other 50% of the problems are not their imagination. It's also not strictly the fault of our software. It's a sort of manufactured scarcity because they refuse to optimize any code and therefore their only solution is always more compute, especially ram. Literally half of them are doing 'select *' and processing all the data in one shot in single threaded pandas. They behave badly and for example if we allow them 3 thingies at the same time, they'll take 3 xl for the max time without using it, blocking other users. They call manually running 3 things at once 'parallel'. And to make it much worse, IT way above our pay grade basically refuses to give more than the bare minimum of compute. To address this, and improve the experience for most, since they won't behave to themselves, we have to do things like shut them down if they use the super xl gpu but don't use it. The greedy/lazy users hate this.\n\nOverall our product is good and uses solid open source stuff with some customization. The team of engineers are half rock star 10x and half juniors still learning. We've performed miracles squeezing so much juice out of the orange peels we're given. But users aren't totally wrong to complain, especially during peak times.\n\nBack to the main point, it just feels like their parents didn't teach them manners or something. Like how would they feel if I had a complaint about their work and instead of quietly and politely pinging them with a question, out of nowhere, without them knowing who I am, I just emailed their whole department @ them and cc: their boss just to make sure I was clear.\n\nAm I wrong?",

The process is to query for a set of events that have payments coming due, and then generate invoice records for the participants. It's pretty straightforward and already developed and working.\n\nRight now, using Entity Framework, it generates a query that gets all of the events with upcoming due dates and having an active status. That part makes sense to be in the data access.\n\nThe issue I'm having is that this query includes all participants for each event. Then in the business layer, it checks the status of each participant to see if they're active, checks to see if there is already an invoice generated, and if they are already current on their payments. Those things seem like business logic, but I'm wondering if an argument could be made that the data access should only return travelers that meet that criteria anyway?\n\nI may also just be overthinking all of this, but I was just curious if there's a good \"rule of thumb\" to go off of, especially when trying to look at nested data.",

        "text": "My team have recently inherited a very poorly written, business-critical, monolithic LAMP application with the goal of guaranteeing reasonably uptime and scalability targets in just a few weeks. Our deadline is somewhat fixed because it depends on user volumes over the peak season, which we forecast will start picking up around Black Friday.\n\nThe monolith is currently deployed to a single, \"snowflake\" EC2 in AWS. Deployments to this instance are entirely manual. The biggest operational risk we're currently trying to mitigate with this instance is that it currently has a dynamic IP attached, which the cloud provider would likely recover if the instance rebooted due to a server crash or maintenance work. We've spoken to AWS about it and they've confirmed they would not be able to give the IP back to us. This would break dozens of integrations that are (wrongly) currently pointing to this ephemeral IP address start failing. By some miracle though, the VM has been stable enough not to crash once so this situation has never happened before but that doesn't mean the risk of it happening is not there, especially during peak traffic.\n\nThe monolith is very tightly coupled to the Production environment in which it runs, as it has a ton of hardcoded references to its own Production ephemeral IP address. Moreover, all of its application config is hardcoded and duplicated across every dozens of file. All of these settings assume they're running in a Production environment too.\n\nWe want to make the minimum amount of changes to the application code to allow us to replace its dynamic IP with a reserved, static one. However, because the monolith is not modular at all and there is little to no code reuse in it, we've basically had to change hundreds of files just to be able to fetch all the application settings from a single config file. This has allowed us to deploy a version of the monolith with Test settings to a Test environment that we're able to run manual tests against.\n\nEven though each individual change we've made is very small, we have basically touched almost every source file in the codebase. The people that wrote this legacy application and therefore had any good understanding as to how it works no longer work at our company. With no support from domain experts and no automated test coverage whatsoever, we're looking at a pretty risky, time-sensitive deployment that we know needs to happen as things could get pretty ugly for us if the instance reboots or dies for whatever reason and we lose its IP. \n\nSo the main question facing us now is, what would be the safest way to make this deployment happen as safely as the circumstances allow? We've also ruled out accomplishing this through multiple deployments because of how tightly coupled and messy the code is.\n\nI'm not looking for any silver bullets here. Any ideas or suggestions would be more than welcome.",

I obviously can do the work but I'm getting so discouraged because I'm getting wrecked by EASY leetcode questions.\n\nI know that the interviews aren't meant for us to always solve the questions and are meant to measure our critical thinking/logic but sometimes I even have a hard time understanding the question itself lol.

Since graduating I have been trying to land a job in the field and have had 0 success. Not even an interview. I have been applying on company websites, indeed, and just messaging people directly on LinkedIn but am getting nowhere. I don't really know what else to try. \n\nI think my main issue is that I have no professional development experience and I think employers are just throwing my application out as soon as they see that. I never did any type of co-op or internship while in school and I think that's really hurting me now. I'm currently working a technical job but not related to development, but I also have done some freelance work for smaller businesses which I thought would count for something.\n\nI am applying to all types of development jobs, even internships and I'm not even hearing anything from those. \n\nAm I doing something wrong? Is this how hard it is for everyone? I am almost ready to give up. Im really disappointed  because this degree wasn't easy and I really thought it would get me a decent job. But now it seems I might not even use it at all.",

        "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI need some advice to get my first software job please. I appreciate any recommendation.\n\nI'm in my early 30s. I've graduated with a CS degree 4 years ago at age 28. However, after applying for almost 200 applications, I did not get any job. The best that I got was an interview with a technical manager at a big company and got turned down as well. I got so frustrated, and I have been working as a manager / marketing coordinator at a retail store since then. Now I really want to get back to the tech industry and become a software engineer as I've always wished for. However, the only \"real\" experience that I have was a PHP job for around 1 year for a small company, but it was more than 10 years ago, that was even before I went to college for CS. I did not have any internship while I was in college. Other than that, I've done some WordPress websites for some companies / stores while in college. \n\nI've been working on my Python skills, I have some knowledge of Django framework. I'm very serious on getting my first CS job and start everything over again. I'm not sure if 30s is too old to get into the tech industry.\n\nHow should I approach this situation? Should I put my PHP job on my resume? How about my WordPress skill? What positions should I focus on applying?\n\nI appreciate any recommendation. Thank you so much.",

I'm not a manager.\n\nOne of the 6 people on my team has been an obvious under-performer for more than a year.\n\nIt's review cycle and we are asked to provide peer feedback.  I made the mistake (?) of asking one of my other teammates what his thoughts were on the under performer, and this turned into a call with 3 of us myself included discussing this person and what we should do about it. We looked through things like commits, tickets, PRs and stuff for a few minutes and it was as we expected.\n\nI absolutely don't have it out for this person.. they are remote and I've never met in person or had any conflict with them. \n\nAfter the discussion with my teammates I emailed my manager about it, telling him that there was a conversation, and the metrics we looked at etc, even asking if there was anything I could do to help the situation.\n\nThis backfired on me - I received a rather long and unambiguous email from my manager telling me in several different ways that it was very inappropriate for me to discuss performance of others with teammates, that I needed to remember my role as an individual contributor etc.. \n\nAs someone who is 38 years old, being told to stay in my lane like this really soured my day. I'm not sure to what extent I was in the wrong in any of this. I don't necessarily think my manager is wrong, and I apologized for the email and tried to clarify that the conversation we had was spontaneous etc and that I understood.\n\nI guess I like soliciting the opinions of random strangers on Reddit, so fire away. I think my manager must have felt like I was trying to manage up or something, which I really wasn't. Just trying to be proactive for the health of the team.",
