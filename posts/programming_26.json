        "text": "So I have absolutely NO knowledge of programming besides these past 3 days of learning and after thinking for a while I WAS going to start with C# but i have a move coming up so I decided I would learn Lua and make Roblox games to try to get money and start something at least. After I move I was going to start on C# and go to college for it as well. I have quite alot of people in a discord server to ask questions who are all very good programmers and also a dev for Roblox with a 6 figure salary who is helping me with Lua. However when i told them that I was learning Lua first and the reasoning behind it as I stated before they were being very harsh and said to come to this sub and you guys would say the same. Is it really that detrimental to learn Lua first for 6 months at most to do side projects? I understand all the things “bad” about it but even with those conditions? Am i not going to be able to get anywhere losing these little months of practice on a “more used language”. And yes, theyre right about companies needing C# but they make it out like im wasting my life if i do this for a tiny portion of my life. “You can be a millionaire at 20 or a millionaire at 25 thats 6 years” is something else they say And i dont even know how to respond is 6 months or less THAT much of a detriment? and lets say i start C# right now i wouldnt be able to to to college until the 6 months anyways.",
