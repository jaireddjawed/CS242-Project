        "text": "My sister one time went into my room because it's a better signal for her laptop.  She did not ask my permission. Her reason is \"It's a life or death situation and my boss was calling me for a video chat\". I demanded an apology and she refused. I decided to \"help\" her. I get it but she should still apologize. Emergency things can make us do things that are not right but still, we should apologize. \n\nYou see my sister still believes that charging a phone overnight even once will cause the battery to drain. THis is not 2010, and tech has developed so much. Personally, I do not charge my phone or other electronics overnight often but when it is at 1% and I have to sleep, I will do it. If my sister has to leave for work the next day with her phone 1% at night, she will start charging as soo as she wakes, thinking the bath and dressing up for work will give a sufficient percentage. One time, her iPhone was at 3% so I decided to do a little \"help\".\n\nMy parent's were out for the weekend plus monday and sister decided to sleep in their comfy bed (it is really more comfy than our beds).  Since Mom and Dad's room is not restricted, I decided to go in while she sleeps. I wanted to see how much percent is her phone and it was 3%. Knowing I can finally piss her off, I charged her phone with her charger nearby. \n\nWhen she woke up, she freaked out and got mad at me and I was jsut laughing. She kept saying 'IT'S NOT FUNNY. IF MY BATTERY DIES YOU ARE GONNA PAY FOR A NEW ONE. YOU KNOW THIS PHONE WAS A GRAD GIFT LAST YEAR AND YOU ARE GONNA BREAK IT. WHY CAN'T YOU CARE FOR PEOPLE'S STUFF\"  I swear seeing her freakout was worth it. \n\nTLDR: My sister used my room for an emergency video chat with her boss and did not even apologize. I decided to charge her iPhone overnight since she believes that doing it once will cause the battery to degrade. She freaked out and It was so worth it seeing her freakout.",

        "text": "So I do data analysis for financial firms. I’m based in Europe but I get a new line manager from America. Now I get on really well with my American colleagues but this guy is an asshat. Not sure how he got promoted to his position as he knew nothing about the industry.\n\nI frequently had to present to the board and he’d always go through my slides beforehand and ask me about them, he’d then ask purposefully challenging questions about things he’d only just learnt from me 5 minutes before the meeting. Really dickish behaviour.\n\nOnce I realised what he was doing I started being more careful about how much I shared. One time I managed to plant questions that made him look stupid in front of the board. Following this he started making me present to him beforehand and then would take my presentation and deliver it himself to take the credit. This really pissed me off so I took my petty revenge.\n\nFor the next meeting I included a few slides in the PowerPoint that were not connected to the presentation, I was able to quickly skip through these when I was going through it with him so he didn’t pick them up. However once he got in the meeting the fun began. \n\nThe board were very surprised to see a picture of a baby kangaroo in the middle of the projected Q3 earnings. He got flustered and blundered through the next few slides. He was just getting back on track but then the regional analysis appeared on the bare chest of Tom Brady. The board were getting visibly annoyed at this point and they thought he was joking around. It all settled down until the final slide, it was the standard ‘Any questions?’ Only the faded picture in the background just happened to be a bikini pic of the CEO’s daughter taken from her instagram, how did that get there? Asshat quickly made his apologies and left. \n\nHe came gunning for me so I had to play ignorant, ‘I don’t know how that happened, it was all fine when we went through it before! Must be a hacker!’ Luckily Sergeant Shithead bought this excuse as he knows nothing about anything. The board however weren’t so forgiving and immediately transferred him to a more junior position. Six months later I got promoted the role he had vacated.",

        "text": "Worked at a Fortune 500 company, and security measures were drilled into our brains from day 1, with weekly password changes.\n\nOne of our managers was a nice guy, but his level of pestering was epic.  We could be assured that, as soon as we got a departmental email, he'd walk over to each of our desks and ask \"Did you see that email about \\[trivial item\\]?\"  This went on maybe a dozen times every day.\n\nWhenever his phone rang, he would rush over to answer it, usually by the second ring.  We enjoyed randomly dialing his phone when he was making his rounds to make him run back to his office, then we'd hang up as soon as he picked up.\n\nOne day we were sitting in the break room and this paranoid, jittery manager was reminding us yet again to change our computer passwords.  \n\n\"A computer password is relatively easy to crack,\" said I.\n\n\"Not mine, there's no way it can be done.\"\n\nSo I told him I'd give it a crack.\n\nIt should be noted that we all had the same PCs, with the same dual-monitor setups, and they were exactly alike.\n\nExcept his left monitor had an Apple sticker on the bottom left.\n\nNext morning I switched his monitors: moved the left (Apple) to the right, and the right to the left.  Then I took the sticker off the now right monitor, and placed it on the left in the same place. \n\nNow the setup looked exactly like it had before I made the switch.\n\nHe came in, booted up, and yelled my name.\n\nI walked casually over, and he had a panicked look on his face.\n\n\"How'd you do it?  Keylogger?  Guess my password?  Take the hard drive out?  Boot thumb drive?  How?!?\"\n\n\"Gee, what makes you think I did it?  I thought nobody could crack your password?\"\n\nI walked off, and never told him how I did it.  Every once in a while, he'd think of a new method and ask, and I'd just grin and say \"It's possible.\"",

        "text": "I have worked my job for several years, and as any job there are good employees and bad employees.  \n\nWhen I started there was one female that had been on the job for about ten years, I will call her \"J\" not because I don't want to call her out, but because I don't want to spell her four syllable, eighteen character name every time.\n\nJ was LAZY, she would disappear for hours, not answer the radio when called, be on her phone when she was supposed to be working, take twenty minute bathroom breaks while we were swamped with work, claimed she was studying for school on her lunch break only for someone to wake her up after she missed her clock back in time by half an hour, no books in sight.\n\nBut I had one habit that was in infuriating to coworkers and administration alike, she was always late for work. At my job you can not leave until the person working next shows up.  If J was ten minutes late it was a miracle, once she was three and a half hours late to relive me, the on duty supervisor had to call someone to go knock on her door to wake her up. (All I got were dirty looks from her when she finally got to work)\n\nOne time she kept showing up late and another coworker complained to her face.  She purposely parked her car across the street and kept coming in later and later as the problem escalated. The other coworker was put on an earlier shift just to end the problem)\n\nThe worst time was when she disappeared for two months.  My supervisor called her after three days of no show and let a message.  Two days later J had her mother call and say she was not ready to come back to work after a cousin died in Florida.  Checking her Facebook account proved that J considered morning to be drinking at back bars every night.  When J came back she still had a job! (We figured J was sleeping with one of the higher ups, but we didn't have proof)\n\nFinally we got a new district manager that was a hard ass and made sure many of the rules that had been ignored.  The job has mandatory testing given every so often to make sure we are compliant with state and federal regulation.  J bombed out and was fired, not a year was shed on her last day.\n\nYesterday I received a call on the office phone.  It was someone wanting to talk to a former coworker that had quit due to health reasons.  I asked why and found out that it was someone doing a background check on J, I was about to say that employee wasn't working here anymore when the person on the other end said they were with a certain government agency, (Think three letter agency) and the former employee was a reference.\n\nI put the person on a brief hold, took a swig of water, and answered as the former employee.  Then I proceeded to tell all about J and her work habits.  Not embellishing anything but also not leaving out any minor detail. When I was finished the person thanked me and hung up.  This was about seven months ago.\n\nToday I found out from a coworker that was on face book and saw J complaint that she didn't get the government job she applied for. \n\nPetty Revenge completed.",

        "text": "During my last year in college, I got hired onto the production crew of a small manufacturing company. The production team leader, purely by virtue of senority, was a guy I'll code-name \"Dirk.\" Prison physique, 6'4\" when standing upright, face tattoo, regularly physically intimidated other folks in the building for sport. Told stories with strong intentional-bigot vibes. Highschool drop-out, chain-wallet, different Monster energy drink hat for each day of the week.\n\nDirk's favorite joke was calling me a school-boy (because I was going to college, get it?). Followed by assertions that education is a scam, and smart people are actually dumb, and only [pick your pejorative] go to college, and so on.\n\nThe other 8 employees in the building really wanted Dirk gone. The owner/boss/inventor of the proprietary manufacturing process was a brilliant mechanical engineer, but terrible with people, and very susceptible to Dirk's intimidation techniques. So Dirk stayed.\n\nAnyhow, within the first month, Dirk decided it was my job to take material &amp; product inventory every two weeks. Whatever, he's the middle-manager, he can delegate. Usually a 3-person job, I was of course made to do it alone. Usually kept me at work well after midnight, but at least I was getting paid overtime, and the building was empty &amp; quiet.\n\nAfter 6 months on the production team, I graduated from college, and got promoted out of the warehouse and into the product design office. A great gig; the one I wanted from the beginning.\n\nNear the end of my third day in the office, Dirk poked his head in the door, and asserted that I was still expected to take inventory that night. I reminded him that I don't work in the warehouse any more. He reminded me that he's a dangerous person by mad-dogging into my personal space bubble &amp; cursing a lot. I capitulated.\n\nBelieving-- perhaps erroneously-- that my new office coworkers would have my back if Dirk went berserk, **I decided to take inventory in Roman numerals**, which Dirk couldn't read. Really show him what a guy with basic 11th grade literacy is capable of.\n\nI wasn't present for *The Incident*, but when I arrived at work the next morning, the warehouse was trashed. Dirk had seen the inventory clipboard, gone ballistic, and started pulling everything off the shelves. The police were called. As I understood it, Dirk left \"peacefully\" with the cops &amp; wasn't arrested, but was immediately fired, and legally barred from approaching the building, or any of its employees.\n\nAfter Dirk's departure, we promoted a new production lead; the machines ran faster &amp; more efficiently, all the product came out cleaner, and the all the \"supply problems\" we were having with raw materials were actually just Dirk being equal parts lazy &amp; stupid.",

One day I use the said washer room and get to the part where I throw my clothes in the dryer. I set a timer on my phone to maybe 5 minutes before its done. When I get back, my clothes, still soaking wet had been placed into a pile on top and replaced by the current user. Well, in the setting we were in, they should have known better. I opened the dryer to find $100. Now usually I am very against taking from others but on this very occasion I think I earned my compensation for the trouble. As an added bonus, I then proceed to throw their laundry out the window and into the fresh cut grass that had just been mowed that day. And I made damn well sure that all those clothes were spread. Afterwards I took my laundry and used another dryer on a different floor. Not a bad laundry day overall.",

This wasn't even something she needed to take side over, I would have been fully accepting of her wanting to support and keep contact with both of us and keep herself separate from the drama. But no, she tried weoponiszing the bible against me. (God does not shame me and would not want the bible being used to shame me).\nI tried reaching out to see if we could mend things (because I'm an extremely forgiving person). No go. I later email to say if we were to have a relationship then we would need to sit down and talk through how she hurt me, etc. Still refused. No problem, were now NC. Well, I was actually renting a house from her. About 8 months after the above she calls me and leave a voice message to say we need to meet to discuss the rent. I reply in email to say I'm happy to accept an increase in rent and that we discuss over email, not in person (she was trying to trap me). She refused to discuss in email and insisted on in person, I refused, she chose to then evict me and my family.\n\nWe moved out of there autumn 2021, and have been happily completly NC with no chance of fixing things ever since.  In 2022, I got a new job working with a library. After a long while of working there I was looking up one of my family members on our Library system to fix something. Its a unique surname so and there was Grandma on our system.\n\nI look at her registration, a bit of outdated information, and she's not borrowed any books since we updated the system in 2013. So she doesn't even use it. \n\nY'all wanna know what I did, I set he card to expire that day!\n\nNow if she tries to use her library card she will be mildly inconvenienced. Ha!",

She is a Boomer, but moreover, manages to appear nice while being rude as well, and talking behind everyone’s back. She is, in another neighbor’s opinion (this neighbor is a former military medic and I help with her tween son), “seriously psychologically unhinged.”\n\n\nI know most of my neighbors because I live in a very cold place and likely have autism, so I repetitively walk around the building indoors in bad weather. Just a way to exercise. It’s never annoyed anyone. But I am social enough to introduce myself. Ultimately I am generally seen as odd but harmless.\n\n\nThis mean neighbor wrote me a rude note in October because:\n\n\n1. I asked to walk quickly through a common area where she was having a small party, as that common area is the fastest way to some nice woods that back up to the building. It is a general nicety to allow this, and she agreed, only to get super angry about it in the note later that day.\n\n\n2. I did not directly and profusely thank her for a small unsolicited gift of a cat toy for my kitten (she is a crafter, it was a crochet animal). Instead, I said, “it’s nice. I’m sure he will like a new toy” without making eye contact. Because eye contact is difficult and I tend to say what I like about a gift rather than “thank you.” It is more honest.\n\n\n3. After the note where she said I was super rude, had no manners, don’t contact her again, (seriously, it was so mean I cried), I had my wife write back briefly, explaining I may struggle socially and didn’t mean harm.\n\n\nI had almost put this out of my mind, until NYE 2022. Went up to see C and H, the nice neighbors. C mentions that the other neighbor has been regularly bitching about “those LGBTs” lately, she knows because she and this lady take similar walks, but not together because she is a bitch. Did I tangle with this neighbor? Hence the complaints.\n\n\nI said yes, C explains she has also had negative interactions, because her son has special needs but mean neighbor thinks he’s just spoiled and needs spanking. She also gives me mean neighbor’s phone number so I can block it.\n\n\nUntil last month, I did NO revenge so that I cannot be tied easily to what I did.\n\n\nBut last month, I met with friends, one of whom has left high-control religion. And my wife and I are digitally adept. We got a little tipsy and I discussed this conflict.\n\n\nCall it a “Schnappsidee,” but we started looking for annoying political and spam campaigns. Then all tried to outdo each other. One thing led to another…\n\n\nMean neighbor is now constantly enraged, because she keeps getting spam texts, mail, and email, as well as tons of free condoms and other embarrassing stuff in the mail that directly opposes her politically.\n\n\nShe’s also received a big spring loaded package of glitter, a package of animal shit, and visits from two very confused missionaries.\n\n\nThe best part is, political and spam stuff sells your information on. She’ll be dealing with this for *years*. And now I can smile politely at her, thinking of all the spam.",

        "text": "Several years ago, I worked for a wireless phone retailer. I think we had around 60 stores. After working my way up to a regional manager of about 20 of those, I came to the realization I didn't really want to do it any more. I decided to try and run my own business. I decided to stick with what I knew best at the time. When the owner caught wind of my idea, he decided to let me go because he felt like I wasn't as loyal as he would've liked. At that point, I decided I'd open a store up the street a bit from one of the busiest ones they had. Business was good and it was starting to cut into theirs. He sent his second in charge to my store to check it out. While he was there, he voiced his displeasure with my location and tried to tell me a few things about how I need to run MY business. I respectfully asked him to leave after that. It really got to me that these clowns actually thought they still had any control over me whatsoever. I decided to book a nice 5 day/6 night trip to the same resort they were going to for their annual company incentive trip. On their trip was the owner and his wife, the VP and his wife, as well as all his top sales reps. I purposely booked my trip so I would be there both when they arrived and when they left. The looks on their faces was enough satisfaction. My petty revenge was complete, or so I thought. A few weeks later I got a rather threatening yet totally baseless letter from their attorney. Well not only was I not the slightest bit intimidated by this, I was also quite angry. I had my lawyer send a rebuttal shooting down every point they tried to make but that still didn't feel like enough. I did a little research and discovered a company that will investigate companies using unlicensed software. Long story short, it ended up holding up the sale of the company, it also cost them $90,000. THAT was VERY satisfying. The 5% bounty was just icing on the cake.",

This is one of those times.\n\nIf you’ve seen my post history you’d know there’s a lot of crap going on.  Specifically, really bad depression and anxiety, as well as chronic headaches, stomach pain, brain surgery two years ago, etc.  It’s whatever, I’ve had most of them for like 10 years so I’m used to it.  You would think my dad would be used to it too, but no.  He once told me to “cheer up” if that tells you anything about his mindset.\n\nAnyway, I made a joke about no one wanting to steal my identity because of all the crap I’ve gone through.  He looked me straight in the eye and said, “I know it seems like a lot to you, but it’s really not that much.  Other people have it worse.”  And if you’ve struggled with anything, you know that is a horrible thing to say.  So naturally I said something sarcastic to him and walked away.\n\nIf that was the end of it I could have let it go.  Not the first time this has happened, definitely not gonna be the last.  But then, when my mom told him how much it hurt me, he insisted I should be apologizing to HIM for being rude, and implied that I was faking my problems.  That pissed me off.\n\nRevenge: he hates spam mail.  So naturally that was what I would use.  I signed him up for every kind of text message service imaginable, putting special emphasis on ones with bible verses because let’s be honest, he needs Jesus.  Now he gets offers and positive messages/bible verses all day long.  I wish I could do more but I’m terrified of getting in trouble. \n\nNow before I get comments saying “go no contact” and “get out of there,” I can’t.  I am financially and emotionally dependent on both of my parents, and a few bad experiences with one of them is not enough to make me drop the love I have for them.  I want a relationship with both of them.",

Also, I was hesitant to post as I thought it may lean a bit towards malicious compliance to some but to me it was petty revenge. \n\nThis dates back to around 1987 or 1988. I was working for a large logistics company in my country. I was relatively new so low seniority meant you got crapped on. I was assigned a vehicle that was a total POS and should have been condemned years ago. It was what would referred to as a step van (think about those ubiquitous box trucks that are converted to street food trucks). The difference was that other than the chassis it was completely fibreglass. Even though it was ancient it had that god awful new fibreglass smell. \n\nNow the suspension on this vehicle was nonexistent. Every bump, pot hole or insect on the road caused a bone rattling, teeth banging feeling even with the overstuffed drivers seat. It was so bad that they had to repair the dashboard weekly as the mounts at either end would break constantly and the dashboard would bounce freely at either end like the wings of an albatross trying to take off from the ocean. It is also very important to note that the only seat in this truck was the driver seat and there was no jump seat ( this is important to the story). \n\nNow I was constantly complaining to my manager that I was not happy and went home aching and sore from this POS truck but all new trucks went to the senior drivers even if they had a better vehicle. So one day the manager decides he has to do a ride along, remember there is no jump seat. Said manager decided that a standard 4 legged lightly cushioned office chair would suffice. Queue the revenge. \n\nMy route was demanding, fast paced and in a heavily industrialized area. Now, this area is not well maintained road wise and lots of rail crossings (you see where I am going?). So I did not break any laws but I made sure that he understood why I was a little pissed. Railroad tracks, no problem. I took the roughest line and never slowed down. Left turn, no problem hard left at the last minute With no regards to my seatbeltless moving seat passenger. I watched that office chair bounce across the floor with my manager trying desperately to hang onto the chair while hold on to something on the the truck that was not falling off to keep from pitching over. ( there was a deep step well to his right). \n\nI did this for our full 9 hour day and did not back off. The look on my managers face at the end of the day was priceless and I will never forget it. It took about a week and I came in one day to the newest truck in the fleet sitting in my spot complete with a real seat on the passenger side. Nothing was ever said but my old vehicle was as at the back of the lot condemned to be either scrapped or become a French fry truck.",

Certainly contain some petty revenge in my part, so I'm going to try it here.\n\nJust to clarify, the building this happened in was not a government agency or somewhere they had classified info. It was a lawyer's office that they locked down tight after one of their employees was attacked so they couldn't get sued if it happened again. \n\nBack in the 90s I was an irrigation tech working in downtown DC. One of my jobs was an office building directly across from the FBI HQ on Penn avenue. Not only was traffic terrible and parking non-existent, It was a highly secure building by which I mean that every door and it was locked and required a badge.  A few years prior, a paralegal working on Saturday was raped and beaten by a perp who had walked in off the street. So every door and stairwell in the building had badge operated locked doors. You had to call a security guard to be escorted anywhere inside.\n\nOn the 11th floor was where most of the executive offices were located. It was surrounded by a mezzanine with some fancy landscaping and there was irrigation to water it. You accessed it through a locked window door in one of the offices. Now this will be important later. The controls for the irrigation were located inside the stairwell.\n\nSo when I had work scheduled there, once I finally found a place to park I would try to load up every single tool and part I needed so I didn't have to make trips up and down. You could ring security in the parking garage and the guard would come down and escort you up the elevator. That was the only way you were allowed access.\n\nWhen you worked on the irrigation you had to access the controls to be able to turn it on and off and test it. To do so, I had to walk back through the office  to the stairwell where the controller was mounted. But the stairwell door would lock behind you and to get back to the mezzanine you had to take the stairs to the garage level and call for the guard to bring you back up the elevator. So even though it was against protocol, I would usually wedge something in the door to keep it open. That would reduce the amount of times I had to go up and down with the guard which was good because he always acted annoyed about doing it.\n\n I knew it wasn't protocol but it wasn't like anyone off the street would be able to get into the offices. To even get into the stairwell from the garage you had to have a badge to open the door. So I wasn't really putting anyone in danger.\n\nWell one day I had the door wedged open so I could go back and forth to the controller and the guard saw it. He yelled at me about leaving it open and told me it always had to be locked . I was cool with that but then he must have told his boss about it. The management company called my boss and complained. They threatened to pull the contract and I got my ass chewed up and down the next day. If it happened again, I might even be fired.\n\nNot going to lie. I was a little pissed. I knew I was in the wrong about leaving the door open but the guard didn't have to be a dick and take it up the chain of command the very first time. Cue the petty revenge.\n\nOn my next service call after parking the truck I  grabbed my bucket with some tools in it and called for the guard and I got escorted to the 11th floor. I waited about 5 minutes, then walked down the stairwell to the garage to grab parts, then called for the escort back up.\n\nI waited about 5 more minutes. Then I took the stairwell to the garage and got even more parts then called for the escort back up again. You can see where this is going. So after multiple trips up and down I finally had all the parts I needed and did the work. The guard was already getting pretty annoyed but hey, what can he say? I'm following protocol.\n\nThen I got to the part where I was going into the stairwell to test the system with the controller and reset the program. Every time I access the controller, the stairwell door would lock behind me and I would take the stairs to the garage and call that same guard again for the escort back upstairs. For those of you wondering why the guard just didn't open the stairwell door for me, it was because in order for me to contact him, I had to go back to the garage level and use the phone there.  No cell phones back in those days. And he had other places he needed to be and couldn't just stand there and watch me while it was working. \n\nI could tell the guard was getting really pissed now but he didn't dare say a word because he was the one that complained originally about me leaving the stairwell door open. But then again he always acted annoyed with me. So what's the? The shittier the look on his face got the bigger the shit eating grin got on mine. He knew by then that I was likely doing it on purpose but there wasn't anything he could do about it. \n\nI know it was my mistake to begin with but he shouldn't have been such a jerk and tried to get me fired.\n\nMore info: some people were quick to point out that the guard was just doing his job and I screwed him. You might be right. But in my defense not only was I never told I couldn't block the door open or given a rundown on the security protocols, that same guard always had an attitude with me when he had to come escort me up and down. Guess that was some important info.\n\nTL;DR: I left the door unlocked in a secure building and the guard tried to get me fired. I made sure during my next visit that I let every door lock per protocol, every single time and it meant that the guard spent the whole day running back and forth unlocking doors and escorting me around the building.",

        "text": "I go to the local Salvation Army thrift store frequently to donate stuff. I just drop things off at the counter and never bother asking for the donation receipt they offer. This subreddit is my favorite, and recently I've found myself thinking about petty revenges. Yesterday I scored, with a revenge that is barely petty enough to qualify.\n\nThere was a table as you entered the thrift shop with paperback books on in, and the sign said \"Special. Five books for $1.00\". I rummaged through it, but could only find four books that interested me. I took them up to the check out desk, fully intending to pay $1.00 for only four books, even if she rung it up as 80 cents. \n\nWell, she told me it would be $4.00. I pointed to the sign that said five for $1.00 and she informed me (in a voice that a high school librarian would have been proud of) that they were $1.00 each, but you had to buy five to get the special price. So I simply walked to the table and selected a book at random to add to the four already on the counter. I was holding a dollar bill, but she informed me (I'm now positive she was a retired high school librarian) that it would be $1.06 because of the state tax. There was a penny jar next to her, but she didn't offer to pull six cents out for me. \n\nCue first revenge:\n\nI probably had six cents in my pocket or another dollar bill, but I didn't even check. I took a 20 dollar bill out of my wallet and handed it to her. She asked me (escalating to a world class high school librarian voice) if I had anything smaller. \"No m'am\". She gave me $18.94 back in change, and turned away from me, not even offering to put my purchase in one of the paper bags that were stacked behind her. \n\nCue very petty revenge:\n\nI immediately placed the extra book on the counter and told her I was donating it. And then I ASKED FOR A DONATION RECEIPT. She had no choice but to completely fill out the receipt for my donation and sign it. She valued the donation at 20 cents, and I didn't bother to point out that the thrift shop values the books at $1.00. After she gave me the receipt I asked her very nicely if I could have one of the paper bags to carry my books out. She gave me a withering look, so I just told her to have a nice day and walked out with the four paper backs.",

        "text": "This happened a long time ago, probably closer to 2012. I had only been at my job for a little over a year, working in a local co-op type store in the UK. I mostly worked on the tills (cash register if you're not from here) but sometimes had to step away to fix the shelves and help customers. I worked with this older woman at the time who was around 50, we'll call her Mary (close enough to her real name). Mary was one of these people who done everything by the book, wouldn't let people away with even a penny if they were short. Wouldn't let people step away from the queue because they forgot something, she'd make them pay first then they could go get what they forgot. She would ID everyone for cigarettes and alcohol sales, even if they looked clearly over the age of 18 - my favourite was when she tried to ID the 48 year old woman who she had actually went to school with.\n\nSo the shop I worked in had been held up a few times, guys had come in and robbed the tills and was costing the shop a lot of money. They installed these black boxes under the till that worked like a mini safe, when we had too many notes in the till we were supposed to put them into the box to save the shop from heavy losses if they were robbed, we also got panic buttons installed (Mary accidentally pressed the panic button once but that's another story, and yet relevant to this one).\n\nThis one Sunday night, I had been brought in to cover a 6pm - 10pm shift. The shop was dead. I served a grand total of 6 customers, and one of them was a builder who I knew personally. He had been paid that morning with a bunch of £50 notes, and came into the shop with one of them. Protocol here was to use our special pens to check it was a real note, and then put the note straight into the safe box, problem being that there was a security glitch no one had noticed because we rarely got £50 notes. The box wasn't made for large notes, so it didn't properly go into the safe, and eventually it tried to spit the note back out. However I didn't realise this, and had walked away from the till to fix the alcohol shelves. Mary however, did notice. And didn't say anything. In fact she spent a great deal of time with her back facing the CCTV pretending to fix things behind the till, but using her foot to drag the note out the box and stick it in her bra. Now a key thing here was that I had only used the box once that night, strictly for the £50 note. So at the end of the night when we were closing up, I told the supervisor that I had used the box. He checked it and it was empty. He thought I maybe got mixed up but I knew I had used it, and of course when they checked my till the next morning, it was £50 down. CCTV cleared me of any wrong doing, but of course they knew she had taken it and couldn't prove it. So I was super pissed at this because I could have lost my job over that if they hadn't believe me.\n\nThe next few months, things started to go missing. Little things like a pack of cigarettes here, a can of coke there... not enough to bankrupt the shop but enough that they would notice during our stocktakes. Turns out she was using the blind spots in the CCTV to stick things in her bra.\n\nSo cut to the main event. Our manager had to step out for an emergency. He left me and Mary in the shop alone, and was supposed to be back in 30 minutes, 5 minutes after Mary's shift ended. Already I could feel my plan forming. With 25 minutes left and no manager, I knew she'd try to take what she could. So I wrote a list of cigarettes, and asked her to go into the cigarette cupboard to fill the stock behind the till. She takes the list, and takes the key, and I \"accidentally\" press the panic button. I'm a picture of calm when the police arrive five minutes later. Like \"oh I'm so sorry, it's too close to the bags under the counter I must have hit the button\". They have to check the store, including the cigarette cupboard. Key thing about this cupboard, everything pack of cigarettes come in a sealed pack of 10,  making up 200 cigarettes. We're only allowed to take what we need, and not allowed to open packs unless they've been opened by management.\n\nSo the police go to check Mary in the cupboard, she's locked the door at this point and the manager has shown up early. She's refusing to open the door, the police say \"open the door or we have to kick it in\". The door opens, and the perfect picture of guilt walks out. Not only had she opened 4 of the packs, she had stuck them under her clothes so badly it was almost comical. They were everywhere. Under her cardigan, in her leggings, in her bra, she had taped them to her stomach... \n\nMaybe if I hadn't \"accidentally\" pressed the panic button, she would have gotten away with it, maybe she'd still have her job...",

        "text": "So, I live in an apartment that has VERY thick walls and I have neighbors that live on the other side of my bedroom wall. Long story short, they're not a quiet bunch, which I have and will always understand because they have a kid or kids (IDK, I have never met them). \n\nHowever, the adults argue so loudly you can hear it through the walls (which you can't even hear normal speaking voices or yelling much so they are LOUD LOUD), they're incredibly heavy-footed so you can hear a THUD THUD THUD if they're chasing after a little one or even walking by. And their kids have inherited their loudness because you can clearly hear the fully open mouthed screech or cry through the walls. This, I don't mind and will never be mad at them for. I'm sure I'm not as quiet as I think I am, even though I live with all adults.\n\nHowever, either the adults for some reason or the kids will make repetitive noises for several hours straight. Usually if I blast music or tap on the wall back it'll stop for good, but today they seemed to be on a mission. I am unsure if they were doing some kind of renovation, as I've heard them doing renovations before (which drove me crazy for nearly a week with all the noise from 7 and 8AM to noon but I didn't complain because they're just trying to fix their place and I'm sure they didn't like the noise either) but it didn't sound like the noise they were making today.\n\nSo the other reason I am unsure was because this lasted almost seven hours straight. It also didn't sound a lot like tools. The first noise sounded like someone was knocking on my wall like you would a door (so not the tapping/pounding of a hammer but it could have been a hammer on a nail maybe?? Maybe a bedframe tapping my wall??) and then what they were using next sounded like it had a motor (maybe just the loudest drill there ever was or a vacuum? idk) that kept hitting the wall. These noises were in the same EXACT spots on the wall over and over and over and over without any breaks in between from around 9AM to almost 3:45. \n\nMy rationale is: if it was a hammer knocking on a nail, they were hammering the longest nail ever because nearly seven hours in the *same exact spot??* *Really?* With the motor noise, it sounded like that deep vibrating sound that mini fridges make sometimes but SUPER LOUD and also in the same exact spot on the wall. Which, if it was a drill, then they're either trying to drill through to my wall or they have the longest screws known to man because both things should not take nearly seven hours to do in one single spot! \n\nI started blasting music back when it wouldn't let up after a while. I wasn't feeling well and I could barely concentrate on doing important assignments for class that I had set time aside to do today. I really like loud music, so I turned up my speakers to full volume and played some. That made the noises stop for a moment, so I stopped my music. Then they started up again so I started the music again. They stop, I stop. They start, I start. Even if it was just one knock or one VRRRRRR of the motor thing, I blast one second. \n\nIt finally stopped around 3:30, though the noises did start up again but seemed to be taken to a different part of their place for the first time today (so it was softer). Both noises then *completely* stopped at around 3:43. \n\nI have no idea wtf my neighbors were doing but WHY??? *AND FOR ALMOST SEVEN HOURS IN THE SAME EXACT SPOT???* \n\nWell, at least I know they maybe dislike two things: death metal and Hatsune Miku (I played one vocaloid song after a while).",

        "text": "This happened WAY WAY back - My daughter is 30 now.\n\nWhen I was 18 and in my first year of college, I got pregnant.  The father joined the Navy to escape responsibility.  My parents (who are strict conservatives except when it's inconvenient) abandoned me and cut me off financially.  They wanted me to have an abortion to prevent the loss of my scholarship.\n\nThat's how I found myself at 18 suddenly and totally responsible for myself and my living situation with no financial or emotional support from anyone.  I lived at a private dorm and was \"befriended\" by the property manager - Donna.  When I told her my situation, she swooped in like a hero and helped me get a place to stay at one of the other properties she managed (I was getting evicted from the dorm).  She then helped me get a job at a gift shop at one of those properties.\n\nI thought she was the most wonderful person for all of this until her true motives became clear.  She wanted to adopt my baby, even though I had expressed no interest in giving my baby up for adoption.  After a few weeks of work, she launched a campaign to convince me I was unfit to be a mother and that my baby would be so much better off if I let Donna have it.  At first it was subtle, passive-aggressive remarks about how much money she and her husband had, how she couldn't have children herself, how she hoped she was able to adopt one day and what a wonderful life they would give their baby.  But, as time passed, her approach became more aggressive and direct.  She was always around the shop and would even come to my apartment, ready to point out things I did (or didn't do) that proved what a terrible mother I would be.  She went into long rants about how awful I was for having a baby without a father, how we'd be \"welfare trash\" forever, how God brought her into my life because she was MEANT to have my baby.  It was endless and constant, for months.  Sometimes I let her comments upset me and make me wonder if she was right, but in my heart I knew that I'd be a good mother.\n\nFor a while, and feeling intimidated, I let myself be bullied into including her in baby-related events - I even let her go with me to the sonogram where I found out my baby was a girl.  She was so excited \"for me\"!  As I got closer to delivering, I got stronger in making clear to Donna that I was not giving up my baby.  I tried to avoid Donna as much as I could, but was regularly reminded how much power she had over my living situation.  I soon had coworkers telling me she was claiming that my baby's adoption was a \"done deal\".  She even told people she was decorating a nursery and buying baby girl clothes.\n\nWhen it became clear that she was not going to change my mind, she started threatening me with eviction from my apartment and firing me from my job.  That way, I'd realize how unstable my situation was and recognize I had no business having a baby.  And sure enough, I lost my job.  She fired me for not wearing my shoes behind the cashier's counter at the gift shop.  When I was on my feet all day, my feet would swell right out of my shoes.  I'd stayed behind the counter and slip off my shoes for a bit - but never in view of the customers.  Still, that was reason enough, in Donna's mind, to teach me a lesson.  It didn't take long after losing my job to also lose my apartment.  I ended up couch-surfing and even spent some time homeless until I got some housing assistance.\n\nIn the meantime, I had gone to the EEOC and complained, and they helped me mediate with the owners of the gift shop property.  As a result, Donna got fired from managing that property and I got months of backpay and some extra money for my trouble (in exchange for not full-out suing them).  This small cash windfall turned out to be a huge blessing that actually enabled me to survive financially until I had my baby and could get back in school.  Donna firing me was the best thing that could have ever happened.  I saw her years later and she was still childless.\n\nBest Revenge: My daughter is now getting ready to graduate, full scholarship and magna cum laude, from a top law school.  Turns out being raised by a single mom is not as awful as Donna thought! :)",

I don't really have a friendship with her, but I guess she's alright.\n\nWe went on a couple of dates and decided to have sex and begin a relationship.  That's when he took our selfie.  We had sex.  Sex was great.  Next date, he showed me the meme that was similar to \"Packers pummel Bears\" that he said he showed to his friends.  Cringe.  I'm too mature for that.\n\nThat morning, he woke up and asked if I had any whiskey to put in his coffee.  Ummm... no????\n\nSo he suddenly made an excuse that he was taking his adult kids to brunch and he'd call me later.\n\nHe didn't call.  I didn't call him.  A couple of days later, he called, confiding that he got a DUI that Sunday, and that he lied to me.  He didn't have brunch.  He went to a bar and got a DUI at 4pm.\n\nI politely immediately broke up with him and he begged me to keep the DUI to myself.  I agreed.  Because I'm an adult.\n\nLast week, my co-worker came by and said, \"OMG!  I just found out you dated Vince!\"  \n\nI said, \"I'd hardly call it dating.  I broke up with him right after that DUI.\"\n\nShe dropped her papers and slammed her hands on my desk, shouting, \"What?  WHAT?!  You've GOT to be kidding me!!  He didn't tell ANY of us!  Haaaahaaa HAAAA!\"\n\nOops.  Petty revenge on a platter, and I didn't even mean to.",

No one wanted to hike across the parking lot to pay for the lousy coffee in the cafeteria, so one of our engineers installed his own Mr. Coffee machine in an empty office.  He charged just enough to break even.  \n\nThen another group moved into our building. Being good neighbors we told them about our unofficial coffee service and reminded them of the rules.  Keep the area clean. When you empty the pot brew a new one, and put a quarter into the box for each cup. \n\nOne of these new guys ranted about how his college roommate worked for Google and they have this awesome cafeteria where employees enjoyed free meals.  Another talked about the startup he had worked at that had a fridge fully stocked with free soda.  Our company should at least be able to afford free coffee. \n\nThe guy who ran the coffee service noticed that the money collected didn’t balance with the amount of coffee consumed.  So he rigged up a nanny cam. Sure enough, the guys from the new group were helping themselves to coffee without paying. \n\nWe moved a classified documents cabinet into coffee room and got the company to install a badge reader on the door.   Access was restricted to our group.  The new guys had to walk across the parking and pay twice as much for worse coffee.",

        "text": "This literally just happened this morning on my way to work. On my route to the office, I have to hop on the interstate for less than 1 mile to get to the main road that takes me to my office. The on-ramp to the highway ends up being the right-most lane which ends after about 1/4 mile. The lane that I merge into is an \"exit only\" lane for my exit. In these situations, as most of you know, it's best for traffic flow to drive all the way to the end of the lane and then zipper merge into traffic, which is what most people do. This morning, there was an 18-wheeler in the left lane that was apparently getting bent out of shape people were passing him on the right well before the right lane ended. As I approached, he quickly moved the truck from the left lane into the right merge lane. It was an abrupt maneuver with no signal, and he then sat in the middle of both lanes, so it was pretty obvious what he was trying to do. My issue was that I had to slam on my brakes because of this and it then impeded the flow of traffic in the lane behind me. This prick also decided to lay on the horn when anyone coming from the left on the highway would attempt to merge into the exit-only lane in front of him. Clearly, he owns the road and we are subject to his whims. \n\nMy reaction to this was pretty simple, but petty nonetheless. After we took the exit and began merging onto the next highway, I jumped into the lane to the left of us as soon as it was permissible to do so and then matched the speed of the 18-wheeler, driving next to his cab. His issue? There is another exit-only lane coming up and now he's stuck.  I drove next to him for a couple of miles, matching his speed. He was laying on the horn at me to move so he could get into my lane, but I refused and eventually forced him off the exit. It was a very petty and minor victory, but I'm not going to lie, it was pretty satisfying. \n\nI'd like to add that I wasn't driving erratically next to the truck or doing anything that would potentially endanger any other motorists, nor did I impede traffic in any way during this process. There was a third lane to the left, so people were easily able to go around me or the truck if they wanted to.",

        "text": "My wife and I were together for 4 years, married for 1.5, and after some convincing from her mom, she evicted me from our shared apartment January 28 with no warning. Her name was on the lease and I was sub-letting from her, paying my half of rent directly to her + other bills. Yes, it is in writing. We were living in France, and I had nowhere to go, so I ended up taking an emergency flight to the US courtesy of the US Embassy in France.\n\nWhen I got back to the US, I was devastated but ready to sign divorce papers without any arguing or conditions. February 1st, I had a group chat with my (ex) wife, her mother and her father (so they could help us transition to our new lives apart) and I was proposing a solution to an unpaid bill that was going to affect my (ex) wife and me fairly equally, but it required my (ex) wife to do a little bit of paperwork (literally an email and a signature). \n\nShe didn't reply but her mother did: \"*hahahahahahahaha*.\" She laughed at me while I was in an incredibly vulnerable state, just trying to respectfully come to a common good for both of us. But after that, I became the embodiment of rage, and it's time for petty revenge.\n\nAfter having a lawyer and a former employer of mine (who happens to be a judge with resources to make a good judgment on French law regarding the situation with my \\[ex\\] wife) give their insight into the situation, I decided that she can either pay me for all the costs incurred from evicting me in the middle of winter (plane ticket, hotel stay, wages lost, etc.) and it totals over 15,000 euro. The lawyer and my former employer have said I have a pretty open-and-shut case.\n\n# My (ex) wife's mother literally had a 15,000+ euro laugh.\n\nMoral of the story: if you are ever getting divorced or are in a situation where tensions are high and potential costs are large, **DON'T LAUGH AT THE OPPOSITE PARTY**. Especially when they're cooperative and being respectful.",
