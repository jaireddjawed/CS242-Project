        "text": "I've recently decided to get into following the NBA, and there's so many terms that people throw around that I don't get, specifically around drafting and trading. Some things I can follow, but then things happen and I get confused. What is the trade deadline? why are players still moving around and signing contracts after the deadline? what do they mean by 1st round/2nd round picks? what does restricted and unrestricted free agents mean? how do salary caps work? These are just some of my questions. Don't need to answer all of them, but a general overview or resources to learn would be nice.\n\nps. I've never followed any competitive sports, so hence the eli5. not sure if all competitive sports have the same trading/drafting system.",

It really felt like my subconscious made the decision for me, and I simply agreed and went along with it. \n\nI never thought \"I choose this\". Once my subconscious hooked onto it, if I thought about other options, the one my subconscious chose would always be pulled back into the spotlight. So i thought, \"Well that must be what I want to do because it's standing at center stage no matter what I think\".",

The concept of the hologram can be \r\nmost easily understood by using an example cited by Bentov in which he asks the \r\nreader to visualize a bowl full of water into which three pebbles are dropped. As \r\nthe ripples created by the simultaneous entry of the three pebbles radiate outward \r\ntowards the rim of the bowl, Bentov further asks the reader to visualize that the \r\nsurface of the water is suddenly flash frozen so that the ripple pattern is \r\npreserved instantly. The ice is removed leaving the three pebbles still laying at \r\nthe bottom of the bowl. Then the ice is exposed to a powerful, coherent source of \r\nlight, such as a laser. The result will be a three dimensional model or \r\nrepresentation of the position of the three pebbles suspended in midair. Holograms \r\nare capable of encoding so much detail that, for example, it is possible to take a \r\nholographic projection of a glass of swamp water and view it under magnification to \r\nsee small organisms not visible to the naked eye when the glass of water itself is \r\nexamined. The whole concept of holography, despite its scientific implications, \r\nhas only been known to the physicist since the underlying mathmatical principles \r\nwere worked out by Dennis Gabor in 1947(he later won a Nobel Prize for his work).\nLaboratory demonstration of Gabor's work only occurred years later following \r\ninvention of the laser. As biologist Lyall watson explains; \r\n\"'fhe purest kind of light available to us is that produced by a laser, which \r\nsends out a beam in which all the waves are of one frequency, like those made \r\nby an ideal pebble in a perfect pond. When two laser beams touch, they produce \r\nan interference pattern of light and dark ripples that can be recorded on a \r\nphotographic plate. And if one of the beams, instead of coming directly from \r\nthe laser, is reflected first off an object such as a human face, the resulting \r\npattern will be very complex indeed, but it can still be recorded. The record \r\nwill be a hologram of the face.\"",
