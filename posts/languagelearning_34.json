For example, if you're learning Italian, you would learn about Italian culture. If you're learning French, you might learn about culture in France and Qu√©bec (or somewhere else where French is spoken!).\n\nSome language learning resources have tidbits of cultural information like this. However, I was wondering, in the case that this information is absent (such as for example using Duolingo to learn language basics), how do you immerse yourself in the culture of the region your language is spoken in, if you can't travel there or can't travel for extended periods of time? What kind of cultural information is necessary to learn?\n\nThank you!",

I come up with some plans to divide the work.\n\nMy plan is to give each one a letter from the alphabet and give all the cards that start with that letter. After finishing everything, they would export back the deck to me, which will overlap the cards that I have that are blank. I even tried to ask my only left friend, and he is the only one that I have had since high school ended, and he doesn't want to help me.\n\nThis year I want to do differently and I really, really want to finish this to focus on other things. I speak Brazilian Portuguese, and I am Brazilian, of course, so this is why here is not the right place, but I am desperate and I need some thoughts. So I decided to disclose that I am in need of help in all my social media, and even I created a server on discord, but I am a low-profile and running low on ideas.\n\nSo what should I do to go to the right place to find people that use Anki, and are interested to learn another language? Or at least a way to get other people's attention to my server on discord. I already put my server on that site, you look for other servers. Any ideas?",

That certainly changes when that little kid grows into a preteen and beyond, especially for me. \n\nI have a (diagnosed-later-in-life) learning disability and professor-parent growing up, so the shame of not \"speaking proper English well\" was hammered into me early. Apart from English being the language I needed to survive and communicate in my environment, I made it my mission to master the language. I love weaving dramatic inflections into sentences, waxing similes, and studying Thesauruses so my vocabulary could never go stale. Mama won't raise a quitter and she doesn't want anyone thinking she raised a fool either, now crisp up that enunciation! \n\nBut as I learn another language as an adult, I'm back to square one. The anxiety that the diverse English vocabulary I spent my teenagerhood accumulating is useless, while I focus on pronouncing the most fundamental sentences in Spanish and Chinese is sometimes overwhelming. I'm so afraid that people think I'm dumb or slow when I speak  in another language, because I worked so f\\*cking hard not to sound dumb in English. \n\nI'm aware it's an irrational fear. I know I shouldn't worry about what strangers think of me, and that most people are encouraging when I attempt to speak back to them in their language. I know that practicing and engaging in conversations will make my brain learn effectively so it'll come to me easier. But as of now, the \"Being an Idiot\"-anxiety pops up like the most exhausting game of Wack-A-Mole as I simultaneously try to understand what my conversation partner is saying.  It manifests into my childhood stutter coming back along with the ADHD Fidgets (TM), so it isn't going down without a fight. \n\nI'm aware that a majority of this anxiety stems from Negative-Childhood-Memories-That-I-Should-Probably-Get-Checked-Out, but surely everyone has felt self conscious while talking in language they're still learning?

This will be my third non-native language and first with a different writing system. \n\nI started off with the first couple of lessons, and found the introduction to the devanagari script to be exceptionally difficult. However, there's another section where you can just practice learning the script (the same place on the app where you normally find stories in Spanish). When I started doing those lessons, my learning flourished. I could read, recognize, pronounce, and write the characters with ease.\n\nOnce I learned a few letters, I went back to the lessons. I blazed through those before hitting another road block. \n\nIt's like the lessons group together similar sounds: ka, kha, ca, ja, etc. With no explanation as to how they're pronounced. Ca (‡§ö) is pronounced like \"cha,\" for instance, and I couldn't wrap my mind around this. When I started doing those devanagari specific lessons, they provided a brief reading explaining this and I got it instantly. \n\nThose lessons also group together different sounds, starting with the vowels rather than sounds that are similar and slightly different.\n\nDoing the traditional checkpoint lessons, it took me an hour to learn two characters (and become familiar with two more). Doing the other lessons, I learned 6 characters in 30 minutes (reading, writing, speaking). \n\nI'm thinking I'm going to master the devanagari \"keyboard\" section before returning to the traditional lessons. Once I know all the characters, I can test out of those lessons and begin learning vocabulary.\n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience?",

And all of my extended family knows it (immediate family does not).\n\nI literally know nothing, not even basic words. Long story short, no one taught me. It doesn't help that my mom also doesn't know Filipino for the same reasons being my grandparents didn't teach her. No one taught her later in life, and now she's older and has no connection to Tagalog or desire to learn it. I've already gotten a lot of crap about not knowing it, and honestly hold a lot of guilt that I don't understand it but I'm assuming the nature of this subreddit is more open/understanding of new learners rather than people who would shame me for not knowing my ethnic language (which unfortunately happens a lot).\n\nSo the issue:\nGrowing up, I got into this habit to tune out or zone out whenever Tagalog was spoken. I think my brain just went from a very young age \"this doesn't apply to me so no need to listen\". It also didn't help growing up when I'd beg my grandparents to teach me, they'd say \"you're American, you don't need it.\"\n\nNow I'm in the Philippines visiting extended family and thought I could finally learn. Long story short again, people were getting frustrated and didn't have the patience with me so they just switch to English instead of actively trying to immerse me.\n\nIt's downright embarrassing not being able to understand what should be my native language. My cousins joke with me that they're going to sell me off and laugh about how I wouldn't even know what's happening to me. \nOut of frustration I just decided to hire a tutor who's trained to teach and is patient enough with me literally being lower than level zero.\n\nI just had my 3rd lesson today and I'm having the issue where I can't concentrate on what she's saying. My brain just zones out. It's like I'm not hearing the syllables she's saying to me and it's very embarrassing. I don't want her to think I'm being rude or a bad student. She asks me to repeat after her, and sometimes I can't because my brain just hears the words and completely discards them.\n\nThis didn't happen when I first began learning Japanese (which I'm conversationally fluent in now), so I'm getting frustrated with myself.\n\nHas this happened to anyone before? How did you overcome this? I really want to learn and really don't have much time before I go back to the states and not have a tutor anymore...",

        "text": "Ever since I was a kid, I've wanted to learn Russian. However, it wasn't until recently that I was able to find both the time and the monetary resources to do it. I have tried Duolingo, but although I learned a bit, it didn't feel \"serious\" enough to me (If that makes sense), as I was always working with the same phrases about the horse in the square and my fork in the table.\n\nSo, I decided to go to a Russian-speaking for at least half a year to take classes at a language academy there. Now, here's the thing: I have never taken language classes before. Spanish is my native language, and I have been somewhat immersed in English since I was a kid, so as the English lessons at school were of such a low standard, they almost felt like a game to me.\n\nFor one, I know the fact that I'll need Russian to survive where I'm going will be a plus on my side (Central Asia is where I'll be, so English is rarely spoken there). However, I wanted to ask you guys for advice on learning techniques and resource suggestions, as most of the books I have been able to find seem to be for people who already have a medium command of the language.",

I asked this question here almost two years and I just got a lot of generic bullshit amounting to \"lol just listen to 20 sextillion hours more of native Spanish content\",  well I did that, and I've barely improved. I've spent thousands of frustrating hours listening to real Spanish content produced by and for natives with tiny to non-existent improvements in my listening skills. Fast colloquial Spanish is still a complete blur even with subtitles. I cannot make my brain interpret fast Spanish as anything other than mush even when the words are literally printed in front of me.

Are there Spanish novels that you love or recommend? Perhaps reading an English and Spanish translation of the same work would a good exercise.\n\nOn that note does anyone participate in any book clubs or groups that are language learning oriented?

But since we're going to Italy, I don't know if I should switch to learning Italian? I don't think I can try learning both at once, they're a bit too closely related and it trips me up sometimes. But I also love Italian and would like to learn it as well one day. It's a very beautiful language to me, and I love Italian culture enough that I'd like to make other trips to Italy after this too. But Italian just isn't a very widely spoken language otherwise, I've also heard that it's slightly harder than Spanish to learn.\n\nWould you recommend I keep learning Spanish or switch to Italian?",

        "text": "Hi all!\n\nSo, back when I started learning languages in college, I began to develop intense anxiety around speaking some of the languages I practiced. I didn't have it before, although it continued for years after I graduated. \n\nAnxiety, generally, slows down learning because it's tough to retain information when you're in a negative, heightened state. To be clear, I'm not talking about generalized anxiety but an anxious feeling you get when you try to speak or use the language. \n\nFor example, I can usually write decently and understand grammar in the languages I have anxiety in (Hindi and Russian are two). But the moment I go to speak, I forget everything, stumble over my words, etc. And it creates a cycle of anxiety.  \n\nOver the past year or so, I've been working on reducing language anxiety and reading about ways to improve my skills. I've started to make some headway, so [I wrote a long-form post about it](https://linguistmag.com/whats-behind-foreign-language-anxiety/).  \n\nGenerally, the main things that have helped are:\n\n* Embracing the silent period and not pushing myself to speak\n* Focusing beginner skills on real-time, present activities when practicing output. \n* Listening more\n* Carefully curating my tutor list \n* Focusing less on proficiency-related goals and more on material comprehension\n\nAnyway, I hope this helps anyone who might be struggling even though they love language learning.  \\^\\^",

I‚Äôve been thinking about and reflecting on it a lot and feel I should get it off my chest.\n\nSo to start off I only know English as my native language and even that I feel has actually degraded over time. Foreign languages were always my absolute worst subject in school. Hated every moment of it. First of all the language I was actually quite interested in learning was Japanese. Schools didn‚Äôt offer that so ended up going with Spanish because I had heard it wasn‚Äôt too hard and the school required at least 3 years of a foreign language. Let‚Äôs just say I ended up completely failing that class and didn‚Äôt do it ever again. \n\nI ended up switching to Latin around high school and was barely able to get through it all and forgot pretty much everything instantly. Foreign language was by far the most stressful school subject I‚Äôve ever taken and had so much wasted time.\n\nI pretty much just told myself that I‚Äôm just incapable of learning a second language and really looked at people with envy who could. From my friends who are bilingual and were raised that way to my own siblings who actually do well in those classes. \n\nAt the start of last year I had given Japanese a shot considering I was out of school and it was something I had been wanting to try. Ended up mostly quitting on that within a month. I simply don‚Äôt have the environment to do so and with me already struggling at reading and writing, both of which I‚Äôve grown to dislike thanks to school \n\nI‚Äôm just at this point now not really sure what to do and if it‚Äôs even worth trying at all. Sorry if it got a bit ranty/venty but I just needed to get this out. I would love to hear your thoughts about it.",

So far, I found that Kindle devices output infinitive versions of the words when I look them up in a dictionary but exporting web pages to Kindle isn't that convenient.\n\nWhat other tools exist where I can look up the word and then export the word, infinitive, translation, and example to Anki/text file?",

For the most time I spent my energy primarily on comprehension (reading &amp; listening) but last summer I moved to Spain. Ever since then I struggled to connect with people using Spanish. At work I mostly speak English. I am able to speak, what is holding me back are mostly psychological barriers.\n\nI vented to a friend about this last weekend and decided to challenge myself. I found a non-profit that organizes workshops to teach programming to people. I signed up as a coach and ended up trying to help someone with his Ruby on Rails problems. This isn‚Äôt my field of expertise, so we didn‚Äôt make a lot of progress but the communication in Spanish worked quite smoothly. The fact that I was trying to impart new information on a learner probably even helped since speaking more slowly than a normal native speaker is helpful in that situation.\n\nI‚Äôll definitely try to take this as a lesson that my abilities are already inside me and I only need the courage to put myself out there.",
