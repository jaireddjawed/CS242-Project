There really isn't anything too graphic to warrant an R rating especially considering Marvel films in the present day are way more violent than the first Matrix film. The sequels are much more darker and there's a sexual scene in the second movie but in contrast there isn't a whole lot of blood in Matrix 1 to warrant an R rating. What other movies are R rated but tamer than most other R rated films?",

I know the social embargo doesn't lift til Monday so those who watched it can't really share much about it online but I'm just curious to know how it was. I'm a gigantic John wick fan and i cant wait to read the reviews. I did talk to someone who watched it and he said it's better than chapter 3. Story wise chapter 3 was kinda disappointing to me and to a lot of others as well. I hope the story in chapter 4 is better than 3. The whole finger cutting sequence was totally pointless in chapter 3 and it was dumb. The action however is gonna be great I'm sure about that but yeah if any of you got a chance to attend a screening i just wanna talk about chapter 4 without any spoilers whatsoever. Thank you.",
