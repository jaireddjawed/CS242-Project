I would soon find out. Today it took standing my ground and being punched in the face repeatedly while being simultaneously told I was being crazy for attempting to ask why this was happening. Maybe she was right. I know why, and it was punching me right in the face. After years of martial arts I could have blocked or countered but I let it happen. Perhaps like years ago I felt underneath it all like I deserved the abuse for being so naive in the first place to come here.\n\nNow I have just a few days to gather my things. Screw my plans to finally get my business rolling, or spend time with my new partner, or just breathe ... all of that must now bow to the will of the narcissist who feels disrespected because I said “what do you need?” And “have a nice day” in the wrong tone ... her alcoholic husband stood aside, like well, this is her ... my step brother saw the blows to the face and turned away ... \n\nI don’t ever want to suffer this again ... must always remember that this is why there were so many years of no contact ... this is why no contact was important ... this is why no contact matters ...

This blog is open, freely available, with my twitter and email and github and linkedin and everything. The blog is to help me process what I'm learning in school, but also to help me network and maybe even find a job after I graduate. But here's the thing - there are no privacy settings. On facebook and other social networks, all of my privacy settings are on max, specifically to keep my Ndad from learning about my life. Because for some reason, not only do I want to never ever hear from him again, but I don't want him to know anything about me post-NC. I have always tended toward anonymity and privacy on the web, and I like to keep my personal life private. But I want to do this blog. And my biggest fear is that he will find it, and learn about me, maybe even try to contact me - but honestly just the possibility of him secretly creeping on my life is enough to make me reconsider this whole thing. But if I can't do this, write this blog, put myself out there, how can I achieve what I want to professionally, personally, psychologically, intellectually? I've created this huge mental barrier for myself, and I don't know how to tear it down.",

If they have any kind of ailment, they should get out of it alone and by their own, and only then you may be allowed to start relating. That if you hurt from loneliness, it must be because something in you isn't ok —not even checking if that sentiment of loneliness is called for or not. That if you seek to fulfill any void relating with someone else, you're some sort of a potential N.\n\nBut most people *do* have and have had plenty of relationships in their lives that helped them evolve and learn. Most of my friends who are in relationships with their SOs are terribly incompetent at a series of necessary things that their SOs actively help or have helped them at, and sometimes this is what makes the relationship work. Or they'll have found jobs via their families, or friends. They claim plenty successes as theirs, when they've only been able to be there in the first place thanks to the help of others.\n\nI don't understand why seeking the same so many people were lucky to find themselves in naturally has to be so reprehensible.\n\nNow, I do understand that seeking the same after a certain age may be weird and screams mental health problems, but even then, what do you expect people to do if they have mental health problems *precisely* as a result of not ever having been able to properly relate?",

It’s over, the abuse, and then after the stalking, the harassment, and the attempts at very public defamation. It’s over. \n\nSo why do I find myself behaving in the more “stalking” manner myself now? By looking from afar or through mutual acquaintances on his online media. Why do I find myself wishing things like his new/old (was before me too) girlfriend would figure out the truth and not be abused herself? Why do I wish that one day he’ll realize how WRONG he really IS/WAS to do all of that horrible shit to me even after I went no contact? Why am I still trying to follow up and pursue the two police cases I have against him, one for assault (with proof and is at DA for “review”) and one for online impersonation (felony in my state, still with police) so that the justice system will finally recognize just a hair of the criminal trauma I’ve suffered? And so he’ll finally have to face some of the truths of criminal acts he’s committed. \n\nI KNOW that the more healing and healthy thing would be to just be able to completely MOVE ON, and focus just on me. I know that “an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind” and usually believe it. Yet in this case, I just can’t let it all go yet. This man has put me through so much suffering and even though it’s “all over.” Has only barely paid (has to pay my lawyers fees) for his heinous acts. And what he is paying (a mere little fine) is a lot less than the pain and suffering I endured at his hands for over a year of his very intimidating stalking. How do I rid myself of this quest for revenge (only through law and order systems of course), and instead just have him stop coming into my brain, where he is NOT welcome, at all? ",

He unfriends the women he dated on Facebook, the moment he discards them. But he keeps them on his Instagram account. These women are the first to like or comment on anything he posts. They act like lost puppies waiting for any crumb from him. Interesting thing though: None of the 4 exes I know about had settled into any lasting relationships after they had been involved with him.\n\nEx no. 1: The mother of his son (now 15yrs old) had been in various relationships over the years, but is still unmarried.\n\nEx no. 2: They had been friends 10 years before things got serious. She was in a relationship at the time when he asked her to leave her then bf. They moved in together for a month when she left him for her ex (he probably couldn't keep it together for that long). She broke up with that guy and dated another whom she had a baby with. A few months after the baby's birth, they broke up too. She is now a single mom. and still friends with my nex.\n\nEx no. 3: I traced this one back 7 years. She got engaged 3 years ago to another man, but the engagement ended a year later. My nex and her stayed in contact and kept on flirting on social media despite her serious relationship at the time. (No wonder that didn't work out). He hooked up with her a week after one of our break-ups last year.\n\nEx no. 4: The most recent one I knew off. She is a bikini model and went over to body building. They dated 3 months when he left her because she wanted to move closer to him and things got too serious (she lived in another city). Right after he broke up with her he went on an overseas trip and flirted shamelessly with a woman and posted about it! He hoovered back to her end of last year after she became a finalist in a body building competition. Still Instagram friends. She has not dated anyone at all after her breakup with him 2 years ago.\n\nThese are only the women I know about.\n\nI wonder if these women know what he had done, and is still doing to them?",

She selectively becomes incapable of coping with heat when she thinks it will garner attention and/or pity. ::eyeroll::\n\nI came home late one night after hanging with my sister and ran into exercise friend. She asked if I wanted to walk tomorrow, and I said no because I had other plans. On a whim, I invited her along, and we coordinated everything for the next day.\n\nWhile we're out at those plans, exercise friend mentions that she was hanging out with nfriend before coming out, and made a point of not telling her where we were going, so as not to make her feel left out. Exercise friend is nice, but not very adept at social interaction, and from what she told me it seemed that it made things worse, and would suggest to nfriend that I had put exercise friend up to it.\n\nI hadn't made a conscious choice not to invite nfriend; indeed, I'd originally planned on going by myself. It was just coincidence that exercise friend and I ran into each other at the last minute and were able to make reservations. But now nfriend is being very standoffish when we talk and has started excluding me from things.\n\nThe worst part isn't even the pettiness. It's that I can't even bring up a discussion about all this without sounding like a paranoid nutcase. This is why I hate passive-aggression with every fiber of my being. I hate it when people who deal in it assume that I do too, and respond to perceived slights with nastiness.\n\nI know that exercise friend will give nfriend the benefit of the doubt indefinitely (I've seen her do this with much shittier people), so I'm not sure what to do. I hate drama but I don't exactly have friends to spare right now. Exercise friend didn't willfully make things difficult, but I don't want an enabler in my life, either.\n\nEven if I decide to take the nuclear option, I don't know how to cut things off with them without it seeming like *I'm* the mean, self-centered one. I live in a very gossipy community, so it will get around, making future friends even more difficult to find.\n\nI'm just feeling really shitty, and like I don't know how to make a real friend. I really thought I'd met some reasonably healthy people looking for a healthy friendship. I can't help but wonder if this is just a normal misunderstanding that I should let blow over, and I'm reacting too strongly over it.",

        "text": " **What's the biggest lie you ever heard from a N? Here's mine...** \n\nI have a N family and two N exes, but the award for Biggest Liar goes to my former N bestie, who was in my life for 16 years. She discarded and recycled me several times. The final discard happened in 2015, when I told her I think she's NPD.\n\nMy N friend was always careening from one crisis to the next, and her cult of enablers were always rushing in to caretake her and pick up the pieces. I was the biggest enabler and chump of all.\n\nThat year she had been living in a rooming house across town and had several roommates. One night she came home and dramatically announced to the roommates, \"I've been robbed!\"\n\nShe said that she had been taking \"her life savings\" ($4000 in cash) to the ATM to deposit, and a gang of young thugs had approached her at the ATM and demanded the money. An important detail to the story would be that it was late at night and she lived in a bad neighborhood.\n\nStrangely, she didn't want to call the police. She did however, make a huge stink about it to the roommates for a couple months afterwards, and went so far as to file a report with the bank, in the hopes of being compensated for her lost $4000, which she blamed on their lack of security at this ATM. They reviewed their footage, and only saw her with a male friend checking her balance. Hmmm...\n\nDuring this same period of time, living in that rooming house, she had a much younger boyfriend who was around a lot. He came from a poor family in the neighborhood. One night, she was in the shower, and (she says) he rifled through her things, and found her \"life savings\" ($3000 in cash). When she got out of the shower, he was gone, and he had also taken her laptop.\n\nAgain, strangely, she didn't want to call the police.\n\nI and her other enablers, heard endlessly about the story of her young boyfriend running off with her \"life savings.\" She said that he was calling her day and night, using different numbers so she couldn't block him, in order to apologize and beg her forgiveness. I was there when she was supposedly taking a call from him and I heard her side of the conversation, saying that she just wanted her money back, and he could fuck off otherwise. She told me about conversations she had with friends of his, trying to enlist them on her side. She even said that she talked to his mother, and told her what a horrible son she raised, and if she didn't have her money back she was going to call the police.\n\nThis went on for months.\n\nThat summer of 2015, after she'd been staying with me and worn out her welcome, she moved to another city across the country. She put me and one of her former roommates in touch, so that we could coordinate shipping her bike to her. Normally she compartmentalizes her enablers and keeps everyone separated. I knew all about the other members of her cult of personality, as I'm sure they knew all about me, but we didn't have any contact. Now I know that this is classic N behavior - they don't want you comparing notes!\n\nSo this roommate (who I'll call \"M\") and I started talking, at first just about business - shipping her bike. But then we started talking about the N, and then we talked some more, and some more, and before you know it, we were doing the absolute taboo forbidden thing - comparing notes.\n\nHe mentioned the ATM robbery, with the gang of young thugs, and her attempts to recoup her money through the bank, and I was absolutely gobsmacked. I had never heard a word about this!\n\nLikewise, he had never heard a word about her young boyfriend stealing her \"life savings of $3000\" from her bedroom while she was in the shower. According to M, her \"life savings of $4000\" was stolen from her at an ATM. \"I've been robbed!\"\n\nThis, of course, is precisely why she keeps everyone separated.\n\nWe pieced the timeline together and we think what happened is that she invented the ATM robbery story first, after she got fired from her job that spring. In her grandiosity and delusion, she somehow thought that the bank was going to compensate her for the money that was stolen, bc it happened at their ATM. Wow.\n\nBut the bank doesn't cooperate, and the security footage doesn't match her story, so she invents the tale about her boyfriend running off with her \"life savings.\" And her laptop! LOL.\n\nShe starts peddling this new version of events to her cult of enablers, and people rush in with offers of help and money. One woman, whose wealthy, set up a bank account for the N with $4000 in it. The N promptly decides to move abroad! I know now from M (the roommate) that she did little to no research, just impulsively decided that this is where she belonged, and off she went. It was a South American country with a hot climate.\n\nThe N lasted two weeks.\n\nShe couldn't stand how bloody hot it was! She hated it! She was miserable. She was also on a drinking binge while she was there, and legit not doing well bc she was always drunk. Cue the enablers to rush in with their caretaking.\n\nI offered to let her stay with me back in the States in my guest room while she got back on her feet.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nFlash forward three months, and she has completely worn out her welcome. I am beyond ready for her to be on her way. Our friendship is hanging by a thread, bc within a couple weeks of her arrival, she flipped into devaluing me (Jekyll to Hyde). Imagine having a surly, moody, argumentative, entitled house guest whose got you walking on eggshells all the time, and that's what having the N in my house that summer of 2015 was like.\n\nEveryone in my life is telling me to give her the heave ho. They say to just make something up if I have to. So I finally do it - I tell her she needs to leave and I give her a week. She had been talking compulsively about moving to X city, she couldn't wait to get to X city!, so I figured that's what she would do.\n\nThe next morning, I wake up and open my bedroom door, and there's the N. She is literally sitting on the floor in the hallway. As soon as she sees me (she's obviously been waiting) here comes the sob story!\n\nApparently, sometime in the middle of the night, the N had woken up with shooting pains in one of her legs, and now she couldn't walk!! Cue the dramatic music! Poor poor N! She spent that entire day and evening either on my couch lying naked under a sheet (for real) or crawling around the floor bc she couldn't walk. She told me that she was going to have to camp out like that in my living room til her leg healed. It might take weeks!\n\nEveryone started telling me that she was faking it. So that night, when she was still protesting that she couldn't go to the doctor bc she wouldn't even been able to make it to the car, I told her that I would call an ambulance. That was the moment I think that she knew I meant business about her leaving. So she got up and started dramatically hobbling around the apartment, and then I drove her to the emergency room to get her leg checked out.\n\nShe waited all of an hour or two in the ER, then called me to come and get her. She told me she couldn't wait any longer to see a doctor. While she'd been in there waiting, she'd used her time well, and had found an enabler to buy her plane ticket for X city, leaving the following afternoon. Hallelujah!\n\nThe next day, it was a miracle!! The N was not only able to walk, she biked all over the city that morning taking care of last minute business before I drove her to the airport. She was still making a show of hobbling around, but it was like performance art. I knew she wasn't injured - it was a pity play to work on my sympathy so I wouldn't make her leave. She wanted to leave on HER timeline.\n\nDropping her off at the airport that day was ecstasy, and is (I am determined) the last time I will ever see her.\n\nI've since heard through the grapevine that she is telling people I am an evil heartless person bc I forced her out of my house that summer even though she had this serious leg injury and couldn't walk!\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!\n\n**What's the biggest whopper you ever heard from a N?**",

        "text": "I'm feeling a little triggered this morning. The 1st family function since I went NC with Nmom was yesterday. I deleted FB as part of my NC months ago. I started using Instagram to keep up with some friends and a couple of family members. I decided not to attend the party because I'm just not ready to be around my mother, probably never will attend any function that I know she will be at. It was painful because it was a birthday party for my oldest sister's grandson who turned 1. At one point I considered my sister and I very close and I revel in watching her have the joy of being a grandma and her grands are so precious. I see them as the generation of hope, the generation that will break the cycle of abuse. They're being raised without physical and verbal abuse and adored by their Gma and Gpa. Anyway, I've noticed since I went NC with older Sis, I rarely hear from her. We used to talk daily, usually texting back and forth throughout the work day about any and everything, and a lot about nmom's behavior. Now you can hear crickets. Shortly before I went NC she told me I couldn't go NC because that left her with the responsibility of both of our dysfunctional parents. Our father lives in a camper in her backyard, he's a drug addict and alcoholic who just got out of jail for molesting my younger sister's granddaughter. Not sure if those accusations are true because Nmom was the accuser and they've been divorced for 44 years and she despises him. She trained the child to say the right things. I don't know how it's my fault she allowed an accused child molester to live on her property. I also don't understand her thought process that I must stay in contact with my abuser in order to take some of the load off of her. She's a grown ass woman! 48 years old. She's 1000 percent empath though so she'll never stand up for herself. What triggered me this morning though, is the 2 people I follow on Instagram, older Sis, and a female cousin who is deeply enmeshed in our family drama, both posted pictures from the birthday party complete with Nmom smiling and having a great time surrounded by all the babies. 1) My Mom HATES having her picture took and forbids it (she doesn't like the way she looks now that she's older 2) my cousin has NEVER posted family pics on Instagram, only business related stuff. I feel her posting these pics were a jab at my absence because 99% of my family doesn't use Instagram and I like it that way 3) My older sister feels I should abandon my NC, my healing, my health to attend her children and grandchildren's functions for the sake of \"family.\" I can't. So I have come to the realization that I have to give up the family as well because they aren't going to allow me to have NC without guilt tripping me and making me feel like I'm in the wrong, although each and everyone of them have felt the wrath of Nmom and loathe her presence, there she is, smiling in the pictures, holding a baby that she can't wait to destroy. She damages every human life she comes in contact with. That sweet innocent child has no idea he's in the arms of the devil. I might also add, empath Sis never used Instagram until I deleted FB. She said she created an account so I could see her grands grow up like I did on Facebook. Yet she hasn't posted many pics since I went NC. The first chance she got to posts pics of a family function with Nmom, bam she blows up Instagram! I'm sad today. I have some new boundaries to draw and may have to delete Instagram as well. I guess I should not feel so hurt that they had a party for a 1 year old with the devil amongst them, without me and just be thankful I wasn't part of the circus because I am certain Nmom got in her jabs, and hurt and angered people while there. I can just hear their conversation about what a piece of shit I am lol. Going for a run to hopefully get some of these negative emotions out. ",

For the first few months after breaking up she would leave and join the group chat again. That hurt me quite a bit, but I maintained no contact with her. While that was going on she was going around telling people how much of a horrible boyfriend I was and how I was being blamed for everything. She blocked me on Facebook and then unblocked me. I didn't want her to have any access so I decided to block her. Only to be met with abuse via text message about how it was hurting her that I blocked her... hello, did you not remember you blocked me first? Last week I found out she recently blocked me on Instagram (almost 4 months after we broke up) I tried talking to my N brother, which was totally pointless.\n\nA little while later I was met with another text message saying that she had planned her suicide, messaged me the exact date too but decided not to go through with it... that brought back triggers of when she told me she didn't want to live any more if there was no hope of us getting back together... so I decided to block her number.\n\nShe later on joined the group chat again and stayed. But every time she would message on the group chat it would bring back triggers. She turned my brother against me, who is also in the group chat, and is also a N.. seeing them interact still on social media through the chat still hurts and triggers what they both did to me, so I decided to leave the group chat. Only to receive a text message from her a few hours later not to do it and I quote from her \"I've moved on, and I know you can too\" really made me angry to the point I almost messaged her back. Clearly she hasn't moved on if she's still messaging me. I also installed apps and called my provider to block her number... Clearly those haven't worked either.\n\nI need advice on how to not let it get to me, it's only been 4 months since we broke up. She's the only one that's constantly contacting me and abusing me and saying crap like that. I've held out for this long, but I'm so close to giving in a having a go at her... But I know in doing so, she'll win. Help...",

They have sold their house and are moving relatively far away from myself and my Partner.\n\nAs opposed to 6 months ago, where messages like this would send me into a spiral of negative emotions, the main takeaway I have here is...relief, that my Partner and I will no longer have to be paranoid of running into one of them on the street. Relief that they're going the F away. I don't even feel guilty for not doing anything for NMum's birthday! \n\nSo. Taking the temperature: this is an OK, healthy set of feelings, right?",

I dont put up with people who don't understand my situation and tell me I need to make up with her.  I have good comebacks to \"honor thy mother and father\", \"but she's your mother\", \"but they gave life to you\", \"respect your elders\", \"you have an obligation to your parents\", etc and so on.  Some days, my compassionate and empathetic side comes out and I want to reach out to her, but I know better.  I do not wish to punish her for her behavior but I am still bitter and angry.  I wish her no harm and to live her life the way she wants.  I do  not have any interest in speaking with her ever again and do not have a desire to reconcile before she passes of old age.  I dont have anything to say to her.  She is almost like a stranger to me now.  A long lost acquaintance.  Its like she has died already.  Has anyone gone longer than 10 years?

        "text": "I've been waking up to the fact that I am continuing to attracts Ns and other toxic people into my life, and that one of my closest friends is possibly on the N spectrum. This has been very painful for me.\n\nThis person came into my life after finding me on an internet forum 4 years ago for loved ones of Ns. She was also involved in her own N relationship. I was in a really dark place at that time, deep into my abusive relationship with N ex, and I was very isolated. We started talking on the phone long distance every day, sometimes more than once a day, and have visited each other several times.\n\nShe came to visit me for the first time this summer, and it was the first time we had a prolonged period of alone time. When I would visit her, there would always be her daugher and other family members around. Having her to myself for several days, gave me the opportunity to observe her and our dynamic in a new way.\n\nIt's amazing how a phone friendship or romance can *not* translate to real life. You can feel like you really know someone through phone calls, and emails, and texts, and then you discover that in person you just don't feel a connection. So it was for me when my friend came to visit this summer. Sometimes, on getting to know someone better, you think to yourself, Wow, So and So is really a cool person. With my friend it was the opposite.\n\nShe wants to be seen as The Nicest Person Who Ever Lived, and will accomplish this by love bombing you with lots of flattery and praise. She has always a few dependents - people who are hooked on her financially or emotionally, as she is always willing to listen endlessly to people's problems, like an unpaid life coach. Besides my N parents, she is the only person I know who routinely gushes \"I love you!\" at me.\n\nWith me, she has absolutely created a dependence through repetitive long distance phone calls. She always calls me in the morning on her way to work, and sometimes also on her way home. It's like clockwork. I've realized that I've been trained like one of Pavlov's dogs - when the clock strikes a certain time, I immed start to feel anxious and waiting for the phone to ring, *regardless of whether I want to talk to her or not*. If she is late calling, I will feel discombobulated and unable to focus on other things until she does.\n\nI have noticed that she is still very enmeshed with her ex husband, and that he is dependent on her for everything, even though they divorced ten years ago. She pays some of his bills to this day, rushes to his aid if he has girlfriend troubles, car troubles, anything. I used to think that he takes advantage of her kindness, and that she just can't say no, but now I see it very differently. She will become heated and defensive if you dare suggest that she start cutting him off. I don't think she wants him to be self-sufficient and independent.\n\nThere have been weird incidents when she broke down in tears at a restaurant about her N ex, and other times when she just becomes *really intense* and emotive, and I feel this icky discomfort. It seems like she's performing, and trying to stage a moment of connection with me. Instead I just feel turned off, I think bc I sense that it's not genuine emotion and I'm being manipulated.\n\nI've had the very troubling realization that this long distance phone friend, is not like the healthy normal people in my life. She reminds me instead of another woman I used to consider one of my best friends, who turned out to be a N and BPD. She discarded me for the final time 3 years ago.\n\nThere are weird similarities between them, like how they prefer phone friendships to real life, and for all of their close friends to be emotionally dependent on them, while they play a therapist role. This former friend would also have the emotional maudlin performances, and was a huge love bomber - she routinely told me she loves me and what a wonderful amazing person I am (just like my current friend). It never occurred to me that this was a red flag. I just always thought my former friend was more honest and real and more in touch with her emotions somehow than the rest of us. She turned out to be an evil, scheming, conniving, backstabbing, you know what and I am glad she's out of my life.\n\nThis current friend appeared a few months after I was discarded by the other, and I let her right in, not questioning anything. Like... why would someone want to give hours of her time every day to listening to my tales of woe about my abusive relationship? I didn't see this as the red flag that it was. I just thought that this woman was a very kind hearted, generous, caring person.\n\nIf my friend really is The Nicest Person Who Ever Lived, why does she not have more friends in her life? She's lived in the same place her entire life - shouldn't someone this nice and giving, have more friends than she can count? Instead she only has 2 or 3 local friends.\n\nI feel a lot of guilt for having these thoughts, like I'm being a bad friend and a shitty person. But I think it's important to figure out which people in your life are toxic or narcissistic and weed them out, as hard as it may be to part with some of them.\n\nWhat is your experience with narcissistic friendships? Have you realized one of your closest friends is a N?",

It's OKAY to take space and time to process your thoughts and your true WANTs. \n\nBeing raised by narcissistic parents, we never had a moment.

I googled but could not find any local groups at all, in a major metropolitan city, wth???\n",

        "text": "I went nc from my mom six months ago. It’s been the first time I’ve ever felt myself relax. I had a bad day yesterday, just processing all this and today was worse. I’ve stayed away from fb but got on briefly and I’m glad I did. My mom had blocked me when I first went nc but apparently I’m unblocked because I could see and comment on her profile. I didn’t comment of course but was scrolling thru it and it was just so crazy to see her insanity. I think she’s gotten worse. \n\nMost of her posts are angry stuff and memes like ‘Holding onto that anger is blah blah blah’. From what I’ve learned in r/justnomil I guess some of those memes are for me but I really don’t care. And she changed her profile pic to an old one of me and her. Like whatever. She thinks she’s baiting the mousetrap again but this mouse finally got smart. \n\nSo I sat and cried really hard for a minute. I’m SO sick of crying. But then I felt a panic attack coming on so I got off there. Freaked out for a minute, I wasn’t sure what to do so I went to r/aww. I calmed down then found my way here. You guys have got really great advice. Just some of the posts I was reading and you know Me Too!! I saved a lot of it. \n\nI’ve been feeling so drained. It’s frustrating because by the time my husband gets home from work every day I’m tired and ready for bed. He has an n mom and we’re recovering from both of them so he understands. But I’m tired thruout the day and it’s forcing me to learn to relax. I guess I should give in and let it happen haha. \n\nAnd I still have tons of randomness in my head, like the bad memories that pop up or feeling sad about stuff. Or like if your child entered adulthood via a mental hospital, you might have sucked as a parent haha. \n\nMy mom always scolded me for not having patience. Ok mom it’s been four decades, can I complain now? Just all the shit she said putting me down. \n\nUgh, I’m rambling. I really just wanted to say hi and thank you guys for sharing your wisdom. \n\nETA: I just reread the rules here. I feel like I’m borderline by my last statement there. Kinda forcing me to say I’m mostly here for support. Hugs welcome :) a shoulder to cry on. I’ve distanced myself and want to reconnect with the human race but it’s hard right now. \n\n",

        "text": "Kind of recurring here, so apologies for that. Wanted to rant a little, with the hopes of some input being enlightening.\n\nRecently I've been struggling with my self image as I'm feeling that my body is the only thing of worth I have at this point. It's ironic because I felt exactly the opposite as a kid and young adult, where everyone had always told me there was no hope there, so I just renounced to that area of life, and centered my efforts for being appreciated for what I did, and not for what I was.\n\nAlas, now I find myself in the opposite scenario: I'm a failure at everything, and all I have left is my body. And while I know it's still an error, I feel like it'd help me socially, to look like I'm capable of taking care of myself —as in, regardless of having nothing else to offer at the moment, my looks showing that I'm not that complete failure.\n\nI also want to feel that I'm worth something by myself, I want to feel comfortable with my body, if that makes sense. I've come close sometimes, but I've never felt like I'm in control with this in my lifetime.\n\nI find myself lost, however, because as a male that isn't part of any kind of urban culture, or fond of any kind of aesthetics, there's not much I can do with my image. I don't see myself as masculine, so male aesthetics don't work for me (most notably, they make me feel like a fraud as masculine aesthetics are very much associated with success, and I'm not anything like that), but I don't do femininity either. If I were passionate enough about something, a shirt with a message would do enough, but that's not the case either with me —I've never dressed any kind of message in my life.\n\nSo, one thing I've been thinking about is getting earrings, and maybe trying with painted nails or something like that. Something discrete, I don't want it to seem I'm looking for attention (I'm not), but I don't want to look either like a totally plain person, uncapable of making a single decision —while that's actually true, that is also what I'm trying to fix. I don't want to look something to people I don't know (\"look, this persons paints their nails\"), but instead that if I get to know someone in a social context, and they get close enough, they can notice something in me that says I'm not the complete failure they'll soon realise I am. I want it to help someone giving me a chance.\n\nAnd so I've been sharing the earrings idea with every friend I've been able to, and even vagely brought up the idea in some kind of extended family meeting... And got *nothing*. Zero feedback, like always. Nobody cares, nobody has an opinion to help me decide if it's a good idea or not. Nobody has told me, \"they'd look well on you\", or the opposite, \"they won't make you look good\" or \"this isn't a good idea, what you're aiming for\". Of course, they're the same persons that never cared that I didn't buy clothes or cut my hair for a decade, so it's not as if this lack of response wasn't expected, but I still tried to.\n\nOn the one hand, I feel like there's an opportunity of doing something entirely on my own. But on the other hand, everything in my life I tried on my own has been a failure, and I feel that if I do this, I'll help me with nothing, I won't feel comfortable with it, I'll be dropping it asap, and it'll be wasted money. Moreso, I'll have then to deal with the opinions of the people that didn't want to give an opinion before.\n\nIt just brings me so much psychological pain, to know that nobody has ever shared a decision with me in my life. I see people connect, support each other in plenty of ways, I seem them constantly getting information back and forth, sharing what they're planning to do about something, getting in response plenty of things, sometimes advice or information that, alone, you would never guess, proof that if you did that without the support of your social network, you'd have failed. And it's painful because I don't know why don't deserve any of that, and at the same time it's only more and more proof of how being successful on your own is something impossible no matter how much you try. It's also sad because it means I'm even more alone than I believe to be, but well, what can you do.",

        "text": "I relapsed yesterday. Not proud about it to say the very least! I can probably justify it - I had a strange dream about him the night before and I  was really worried about our conversations, pics etc he backed up on his home PC. Needed reassurance from him that he would never make it public. Lame excuses. I know.\n\nThe conversation was brief but cordial. He has always been highly paranoid, as a result we had a code (emoticon) I would start my texts with, so that he knew it was actually me. I always thought it ridiculous! When I text him a greeting (without an emoticon) yesterday, he answered immediately in a friendly manner. The moment however I asked him to promise me he'd keep our conversations private, he asked who I was? After I took a minute to role my eyes, I told him the nickname he used to call me. Again, he asked me who I was. Now I was getting upset - asked him if he want to video call? He immediately responded *No*. What the hell? He then said he wants an emoticon. (Eyes rolling again). We had changed it a few times over the years, and I didn't want to remember. Each emoticon had a story behind it. Memories that meant nothing to him. I complied, gave him the 3 we used (didn't know which one he remembered) - I just wanted the conversation over! He then gave me the reassurance I needed, in detail explaining how he secured the backups and that it would never be made public. O.k.\n\nAfter the conversation I didn't feel like a knife cut slowly through my heart like it used to the last view times we had spoken. I didn't feel crushed, or that my world had been turned upside down. No anxiety. No strong emotions. For me, this is progress! I managed to keep the conversation too point without him affecting me. This is huge for me, because I am an empath and highly emotional. Yes, the pull was as strong as ever, and I had to fight it. But I just kept on reminding myself who he actually is.\n\nToday is day 1 NC. Fighting memories running wildly through my mind again - the price I am paying for the relapse. But my resolve has not been shaken. He is who he is. That will never change. \n\nGrowth! Hooray!",

        "text": "I've noticed this with two close friends, and one ex boyfriend, who are all on the N and BPD spectrum, that the way they cry is not like other people I know.\n\nI was visiting one of the friends once in her state, and we went to a coffee shop. We were sitting at a table when a song came on the radio that reminded her of her ex, and she started crying. Normally when people cry, I feel bad for them and I want to do something to comfort them. With this friend, I felt turned off, bc her tears seemed so maudlin and theatrical.\n\nMost people will exert huge amounts of energy to not break down in tears in a public place, and if they do, they will feel embarrassed and will turn their face away. Eye contact with other people while you're overcome with emotion like that, is too much, and the person crying will usually strive to avoid it while they regain their composure.\n\nNot so my friend. With tears streaming down her cheeks, she was staring across the table into my eyes, prolonging eye contact, her expression this exaggerated look of over the top sadness, like she was trying to create a *meaningful moment* with me. I did not feel moved to comfort her... I felt very uncomfortable and just wanted it to end.\n\nI realized with all of three of these Ns, that they do not show any awkwardness or embarrassment over crying in front of you, or crying in a public place. They will look right at you while they cry, so that YOU are the one who feels awkward and uncomfortable.\n\nI realized that these tearful scenes were similar in that they seem like a performance somehow, and that they don't elicit in me a feeling of wanting to comfort the person. When a person cries for real, from a place of sincerity, my knee jerk response is to often get teary myself, and I want to hug them or say comforting words or do something to show that I care. With these Cluster B people, I feel very differently... uncomfortable and turned off.\n\nI was wondering if the point of these tearful performances is to elicit in us a certain reaction or feeling? I can't figure out why they do it... is it to seem normal? Do they not realize they seem over the top and maudlin?\n\nHave you noticed this kind of thing with the Narcissists and other Cluster B people in your life?",

        "text": "I felt really good about myself lately, working on an art project that means a lot to me, feeling worthy and confident, and loved.\n\nA few days ago I got an email from my mother. It was about some health issues regarding my sister, and I was actually glad she told me about it. However, it still felt like an attempt to drag me back into our bad family dynamics. She asked for my advice, because I worked in a hospital for some years. But I think it was pretty obvious what would be best for my sister and she knew my opinion about it anyway, because we talked about it a lot when I still visited them (like, a year ago?).\n\nSo, she probably wrote me to reestablish that I'm responsible for the wellbeing of every family member and that I'm  not allowed to not care about stuff like that. I wrote her a pretty businesslike answer about the medical options I knew about, because knowing how they deal with my sister I felt it was best to point them into a good direction. She even asked in the mail if it'll probably just get better over time... So I could not just ignore it...\n\nToday I started crying without any reason, and when I talked to my husband about how I feel, I could link it back to that email. Mostly, I'm really angry at my mother. For writing that email, for not caring for my sister like she should, for writing stupid stuff like she doesn't know what's wrong between us... And I'm afraid. Last time I tried to explain to her what's wrong between us went really bad, and I really don't want that again. I don't want to talk to her about myself or my feelings anymore. I tried that so often. But now I have given up, and hey, there she talks about her deep wish to understand it.... I can't. I won't\n\nI can't have hope. I just want to bury all hopes that my family could change. Can't go there again.",

        "text": "Good morning all,\n\nI know many of you can relate.  Perhaps especially daughters of Narcissistic mothers, as they always viewed us as a single unit.  If they felt, we felt,  If they were sad,  we were sad.  I used to tout this as extreme closeness.  Oh my mother and I are one person.   My mother would show off to others, oh how close I am to my daughters (especially me golden child).  They really feel for their mother, one is my right hand, one is my left.\n\nNo we are not.  We are own individuals.  You gave birth to us, as humans - not extensions of you - not your hands.  In theory that concept can be sweet - to have so much support from family - but this is now the way these mothers take it.  They truly believe your identity should revolve around them and THEIR emotions.  \n\nSo of course this translates into other parts of life.\n\nI no longer speak to my Narcissistic mother, but that doesn't mean this patterns end abruptly.\n\nI am working on shielding myself more from other people's emotions.  It is not just our mothers (or parents) that project out their incapacity, ignorance, and insecurity. No.  This is common among colleagues, strangers and even friends.\n\nI stop myself now when someone is acting this way, say huffing and puffing, showing discontent, nervousness, etcc.\n\nI say - is this me - or is this them? Is she/he having an issue right now?  Why do I feel uneasy then - well because I am a sponge for these emotions.  I am also extremely compassionate, and so I feel it is my duty to help people when they are uneasy.  Great quality sometimes, but not MOST times.\n\nthere is a time and a place, this is not that time.\n\nstep away mentally from what this person is doing, it is THEIR stuff - not yours.  give yourself a hug and be safe.  do not allow their uneasiness to take away from your calm and safety.\n\nyou are calm and safe.  they may not be - but you are.. preserve your calm, preserve your safety...step away, do whatever you have to - but you have a right to this self nurturing.

        "text": "Hi Reddit, just gonna quickly set the stage for you: \n\nI'm 21 years old, female, American, and biracial. I am a middle child, with an older brother and a younger autistic sister, and we were all raised by our professionally diagnosed narcissistic father and empath/enabler/(seriously I'm still figuring her deal) mother. Currently, I'm living a stable enough life with my boyfriend, and we have a cute little apartment together. \n\nSo.. This is the first time I've ever made an attempt at reaching out for people who have similar circumstances to mine.. for one reason, actually.\n I feel as though I'm an entirely unrelatable, and I could never bare to witness the silence and discomfort that would follow any mention of my actual backstory, because it'd only make me feel more alone.\n My nDad was actually sent to the US to be saved from war in his own country, he was never a drug addict or alcoholic, but he has very legitimate reasons for having deeply engrained narcissism. His early life was absolutely horrifying and he spares the family the full details. \nI am a mixed race who is mixed with a race that doesn't tend to mix, so, I can't run off to some comforting group of people who'll blindly accept me for how well I fit in with them. I'm not half black half white, I'm not Asian and Latino, I'm not half indian or any of this familiar shit, I'm mixed with an ethnicity with country of heritage that we currently bomb. This isn't some shit that happened hundreds of years ago, this is what's happened since I was born, this is what's happening now, and there's 0 empathy from the entire country, it seems. If having a bad life at home because of narcissistic abuse and an autistic little sister isn't enough, just imagine going out into this world where I was and still am the only of my kind on my personal path. There's definitely some people out there who must be racially similar to me, but if I live my whole life without ever finding them it honestly doesn't make a difference in my opinion. I haven't lived very long, so having my race openly generalized and antagonized in middle school/high school/college and having my siblings not be an option for understanding and connection to this very day, even after trying, is absolutely miserable.  NDad lied to me growing up and promised that my sister would be normal one day. He told me we'd be best friends, go shopping, tell each other secrets, and it'd be like that forever. I can't begin to tell how detrimentally fucked up this is, and I need someone to just speak on that for me in the comments, because I don't feel like having a whole crisis at the moment.\n\nSo.. y'know, my nDad... he was a bully. He didn't even know how to communicate with us or ask us about ourselves, he just.. kind of saw us as little toys for his amusement. He only ever brings up memories of times that I mispronounced words when I was in elementary school (which he would repeat back so I'd keep saying it wrong because it was \"cute\"-- which he also did to my autistic younger sibling.... who already faces speech development issues....), so I question whether or not he really has any memory of me growing up. I fear that he was so busy lying to himself and me that he missed out on my whole life. My life's been a bit of a roller coaster, so, I really.. wish that he could acknowledge that I've existed for far longer than he chooses to remember. I would come down to the dinner table, completely out of character, visibly depressed and not taking care of myself, unable to communicate or eat properly, and he'd decide to repeat a phrase I said as a toddler into my depressed late-teenage face, after already doing so for 14 years extremely frequently, and... his voice.. just sounded like a child, always. He'd do that kid-bully voice that kids kinda do to sound tough or whatever.. I just... \n\nMy sister... I don't know how to talk about the abuse of my sister. I don't really see her as a sister, I don't love her like one, I can't emotionally or logically connect with her, and the personality traits she's managed to muster up basically make me despise her archetype entirely. She's like one of those 13 year old boys who scream profanity on xbox live. I watched her potential literally burn in the fire that is my parent's care and supervision. It's not all gone, but she'll never be up to par with whatever relationship I was told I'd have with her as a kid. She was born kinda different, very nervous, some difficulties with absorbing info, but she wasn't the violent, angry, jealous, and horrifically unpredictable trainwreck that I slowly watched her become. I tried to stop my parents from making all the mistakes they were making. Her first therapist-- a grown man who would come to our house (WHY???)-- \"taught\" her to \"overcome\" her selective mutism (she doesn't speak in public or in school or to strangers) by literally throwing house cushions at her and bullying her in an annoying voice... she would literally shriek and scream and yell and cry and run with frustration. I would even yell at him because I'd be trying to do homework, but I'd get in trouble by my mom. My dad started acting like this therapist to \"help\" her. This therapist was eventually scolded and fired after several years, for the exact reasons I forewarned my parents of. They decided to ignore my adamant desire for them to stop destroying my sister in front of me. I guess my 7-year-old self wasn't trustworthy, fair enough. She was already permanently damaged at this point and would never be the same again. My dad actually decided to act like that therapist as well, teach her to attack and hit so she'd scream (even though she communicated with the family just fine)-- and even after firing this therapist himself, he continued to act like him..... forever, honestly. I  seriously lost my father and my sister to that man. I hate that therapist with every fiber of my being. He used to come into the room I was trying to do my schoolwork in, bully me by making fun of my name, with my sister there joining in, and he would insult me and say I was mean and scary for getting angry and demanding he left me alone. \nAnyway, of course it didn't stop there. My emotionally neglectful parents continued to ignore my concerns with how they were raising her and she's honestly just becoming a bigger threat by the day. She had respect for me, I set boundaries with her, she looked up to me, so it was never a painful interaction to play together at first, but I noticed she had no respect for either of my parents. They never disciplined her, just taught her to hit and scream, and when she got too out of hand for my dad (a small autistic human throwing fists at you isn't cute) he would call my name as a threat to scare her off. I was getting tired of it so when I was 9 I told him, hey, you should raise your own kid, she needs to have respect for you. He said I was right, but no progress was made, they just kept making her spoiled, ungrateful, and violent. A year or two ago my dad was mortified when she smashed her iphone six against the table aggressively, cursing a storm, because the \"wifi wasn't working\".... they decided to buy her the 6 PLUS after. \nI had a broken Nokia until I was 14, they didn't let me have anything that really worked, eventually it gave out entirely so my dad have me this horrible old off brand phone of his-- mind you, everyone in my family had an iphone at this point-- so.. y'know, the phone was so bad that I didn't even take it with me places (which was nice because I wouldn't have to see their abusive text messages), and eventually my mom gave me her broken iphone 3 which broke to the point where they finally got me an iphone 4 at the age of 15, which I had until I was 18-- but honestly, I don't give a shit about phones, I just wanted to make a point of how they formed her reality vs mine. It's not the material shit I care about-- I care about the way that my parents always purposely left me out of being spoiled like my other siblings because of this perception they have of me. They always carried this insane idea that I was happy enough and didn't need anything to make me happier, unlike my other siblings. My mom loved to call me a drama queen. I still resent her for that because she clearly isn't sorry.  My dad would bully the shit out of me, my mom, for whatever reason, wouldn't acknowledge it, and then she'd want to take a picture of me while I was crying. This happened so, so often. The crying got worse every time. I would cry heavier and heavier every time, my face would be like a tomato, I couldn't breathe from how much blood pressure was in my small face. I was so, so so so fucking upset at the life I was enduring. \n\nMy dad was a workaholic and made a ton of money so he could show off. Awesome that my physical needs were met, super awesome, at least I wasn't starving and dealing with all this (except for the part where my dad's bullying and mom's apathy lead to anorexia), but yeah so uh. Big house. Big fuckin house. Whole neighborhood knew. Whole town knew. Whole school. So, 0 empathy for me. Didn't matter if I was in pain, I was the rich girl in their eyes. I was still eating school lunch and mozarella sticks, went to the same high school as them, wasn't taken anywhere special to get my clothes, was told \"no\" so much that I didn't have a habit of depending on them excessively. We're a middle class family, my dad just worked his ass off and built a facade to mask the fact that he was abusing his entire family, including his youngest, a retarded little girl. \n\nBut yeah. School was bad. Lots of shitty people's abusive children. I was raped by the age of 14 (virginity taken without consent, sexual abuse, also.. being a minor) on my quest to find a man who wasn't a bully. He was from out of town and was on some gang shit, so I guess bullying isn't really a thing where he's from-- just rape, drugs, and death. I was forced to break up with him by my parents, twice. It's impressive how much this changed me emotionally-- in a bad way. The first time, my dad did something behind my back which he only mentioned briefly but refuses to explain-- but that ex walked up to me and made an excuse saying he didn't like me or something. This was the first time I ever had a relationship end, and it ended like that, and I blamed myself completely, I took it extremely personally because of this reason he made up. He eventually came back and my parents looked livid in an odd way. It wasn't a familiar, responsible, parental anger. We were forced apart again after the cops were called on a group of us and our friends for chillin at a playground. Some woman allegedly got all the neighbors to call and say I was sucking his dick. I was 14, I never sucked a dick in my life at that point, and we were sitting with a huge group of people on a jungle gym. I actually ended up dating the son of one of the cops that were on that job and he we had a conversation about how not fucking okay that day was and he showed actual remorse, which felt amazing-- because I can't even get my parents to do this. \n\nMy parents were called to pick me up. My mom sent my nDad. She did shit like this regardless of the fact that she knew he was abusive. She intentionally would send this mentally impaired war pstd man to us, knowing full well his conditions, and still fucking expose us to that shit. I was crying a lot that night. My dad called my tears \"crocodile\" tears. My mom was screaming at me. I was so disgusted. Tie a recent virginity rape and some heartbreak part two into that. A retarded, screaming little sister. Haven't spoken about my older brother much in this, but he's... just suicidal, he's been suicidal since my parents forced him to leave his first ex. I remember he changed after that day. He wasn't suicidal until they did that. I remember when they started sending him to see all the shitty self proclaimed social workers instead of considering what they'd done. My brother was crying and begging them to stop being so invasive, I still remember hearing my mom shout \"WHAT, DID YOU THINK YOU WERE GONNA MARRY HER?!\" I think he was 14 at this age as well. They just always tried to bully us out of making certain decisions rather than healthily educate us on... god, I just remembered their cold stares. \nI didn't tell anyone in my family I was raped until my first year of college, because it was part of why I needed to move away from my first assigned roommate. She was threatening to tell people I'd been raped (even though she wouldnt go to class and had no friends) because I had to tell the RA I needed a room switch because she had a horrifying controlling boyfriend that started bothering me and she was fucking pregnant and constantly vomiting, showed up with a brain tumor, this shit sounds made up but I don't fucking care. Anyway, the school officials were being too lazy to do their job and actually move me to a safe living situation, so I got my mother involved. Told her about the fact I was raped, she sounded like she felt a little bad, asked if I wanted to take it to court, told her no. He has people out here who'd search for me and kill me and I just don't wanna deal with that shit. \n\nBut yeah. I'm dead inside because my ndad was abusive, my emom cared about her marriage and career more than her kids, my brother is fucking insane and abusive towards people and animals (we had a samoyed he fucking hated allegedly and tried to beat up-- I threw something at his face to stop him because the dog was crying, parents didnt seem to reprimand him but they told me what i did was wrong and that he's a person and the dog is a dog and christ i dont fuck w my family) and doesn't bathe or interact with me, and my younger sister is just depressing to acknowledge. I want to believe she's at least the same sweet beautiful girl she was born as, but they sent her to such dangerous schools and neglected her so much and they feed her trash and had her on all these fucked up meds she didn't need.\n\nI still refuse to see a therapist because I know what would make me feel better, and I can't have it. These problems don't go away. People don't fucking understand. I've spent so many years blaming myself, taking responsibility, and I could recite that shit by heart at this point. The hard part is having the certainty to point my finger at others and seriously needing to say \"You did this.\" People in this world are so fucking manipulative that I can't even speak naturally if I want to say any of this shit in the way that I've chosen to here, because there are people with \"victim mindsets\" who are blatantly lying about struggling for attention, I've actually been thrown into that category as a fucking insult. I hate being seen as some entitled lying drama queen and I've been so fucking strong for my entire fucking life. I want to be allowed to admit, yeah, I've wanted to kill myself under the conditions I was living with. Yeah, it was fucking serious. Yeah, I guess I have ptsd now. No, the big house didn't make the abuse easier??? Would your abuse have been better if somebody renovated the roof??? \n\nI feel like a grew up so fast that I'm a weird mental age that doesn't exist. I feel mentally impaired. My emotional stamina is a disaster and I can't process stress very well. I don't visit family. I can't. Remembering car rides... a war refugee narc intentionally triggering a violent autistic hitting him while he drives.. my mom just scolding the kids... my brother smelling like dog shit.. all people ever tell me is that he looks like he smells awful. It's fucking humiliating. \n\nI've hated my family ever since I was 14. They taught me to hate myself at that age. I can pinpoint the times where I felt new emotions that I didn't have. I was taught how to be depressed and isolate myself to prevent furthering the depression with more abuse. This is all I was taught, just how to survive and cope with their abuse. \n\nIn case anyone's wondering how I ended up, well, a wise old lady once told me not to leave college once I start-- finish the degree in one go or the school with fuck with you forever. I trooped my way through college and I might regret it?? I don't know? I got very little out of what I was told to expect. My grades were a disaster but I still graduated on time, with force. I worked hard to find a loyal partner, so we live together &amp; love the shit out of each other. He helps me be a better person, his parents are so rare and absolutely amazing people. He's showing what parenting should've been with his stories (feel free to ask about it). Our rent is super cheap even though we live in a pretty happenin area. Life is good, significantly better than back then, but I'm still hurt. \n\nI wish I could tell you my entire life story and everything my parents ever did wrong, but I feel like this post has gotten too long to read, and with all the gaslighting in my life I question if I'd even be able to remember it all.\n\nThanks for reading, sorry this talked so much about me and not my sister, please leave a comment if literally any aspect of this is relatable to you.

I have a life and career and love and a pet... things all around are pretty good.\n\nThere’s just this problem; I get angry. I don’t mean like a little bit. I mean I am diagnosed with depressive personality disorder, angry. There are times when my emotional skin feels so raw that any little negative thing at work will send me on a thought loop for hours, until I’m just steaming from whatever happened. I am receiving treatment for it, which has helped a low with my everyday life!\n\nBut I noticed recently I still have certain triggers, particularly alcohol use and my own sense of privacy, and when they are triggered I get white-hot angry and see whatever mistake or slight that caused it as an attack. I get so upset about it that it goes far beyond a reasonable response - I can barely speak coherently when it happens. And I get this way for a good few *hours*. I inevitably regret it later because I was either behaving under a false assumption, or reacted by lashing out and escalating. It’s exhausting, takes up my time, makes it very hard to maintain professionalism in the workplace, and I’m afraid I’ll lose my friends if I don’t figure out how to manage this better.\n\n\nDoes anyone else experience anger this way? How do you manage your triggers, and how do you calm yourself down to behave like a reasonable adult human? Is this FLEAS?\n",

Through educating myself and doing some soul searching I feel like this is the final attempt and I will never lay eyes on her again. However, I keep having these nagging thoughts and feelings that she's telling other relatives how mentally unstable I am and how she did nothing wrong (she called me fucking lazy to my face as I was busting my ass to please her, her favorite thing to say to me as a child.) I'm sure she's telling anyone who will listen how I've always been difficult and stubborn and she's probably ticking off my alcoholism and suicide attempt in 2013 as proof that I'm the problem. I don't drink anymore and no longer have suicidal thoughts. I don't know why I care or can't shake these thoughts. Who cares if she convinces her flying monkeys that I'm an insane piece of shit? They're still at the circus and I'm in paradise with no drama. I should be happy. I am happy. I want to move on. I need to move on. Is there ever a day that comes where you don't think about the past or give a second thought to your abusers antics?",

No surprise since I'm here, I guess. \n\n\nThen I came to the second worksheets, challenging negative thoughts. I started reading Pete Walker's book about Complex PTSD today. I had already followed the 13 steps when having an emotional flashback, 2 times. I found myself having a lot of these flashbacks. Then when I was doing this worksheet regarding challenging negative thoughts, I think what happened is I've been heavily triggered. Eventually, the best choice was 13 steps again, discuss it with my counselor, book an appointment for tomorrow. Of course, I couldn't finish my worksheet, so I failed. After the \"failure\", a whole new set of negative thoughts starting coming at me like a machine gun...\n\n\n\nI fear this kind of things can damage therapy. Maybe this is another negative thought. How do you handle this kind of thoughts?\n\n\nHave you ever found yourself having difficulties with therapy? What do you do?",

Even if you are lucky enough to find real love, it is hard work. A decision you have to make daily, that today I will love this person, accept them with their flaws.

Especially after the experience with my nex I am blinded no more by fairy tales - I had no idea people could be so cold, unfeeling, void of emotions and empathy. \n\nIf I look at how many people have experienced the disillusionment that only a relationship with a narcissist can bring, I am asking: where are the songs about narcissists and fake love?

        "text": "These days, if I say I love my husband. Which I know I do. It feels almost like just words. I don’t have the emotional capacity to access much emotion. More on that later. \n\nI am No contact with my Narcissistic mother (and whole family) except sister. These days I float around - focusing on healing. But I don’t feel much in terms of love. I guess I don’t feel much in terms of that many emotions. \n\nRegardless. My husband has been through a lot of trauma too as a result of my narcissistic mother. She has truly ruined the mental state of both my husband and I over the last 2 years. (We we’re married 11 months ago). \n\nMoreover prior to that I was BLIND to knowing my mother was as toxic and abusive as she was. Thus I took all of her words to be golden and projected them onto him. It was to the point that if my mom called me up and told me that he isn’t “cultured enough” for our family. I would immediately call him and go off on how he has to adopt more “ Indian culture.”  My mother called me (now in laws) at 6 am once the day before we were going to Alaska (a gift from his parents to us for graduating a rigorous program). She calls her and says if you think by taking her on this trip you can steal my daughter think twice, the bond between a mother and daughter is unbreakable. We had just got engaged. \nI spent the rest of that day trying to appease my mother, screaming, crying, all sorts of things she pulled. We hadn’t been engaged more than a few months. Already starting the i guess I just won’t come to your wedding. Yup, all of this before what was supposed to be an amazing trip. Needless to say the next day we left for Alaska. I felt no joy or anything on that trip. I was a true zombie. First signs of what was true depression like symptoms. \nBut I still didn’t see it. I thought my mother was just being herself. I tried desperately over that year to try to appease her. I did. I put down my fiancé almost everyday during this time. Even his mother. I did anything and everything to make that damn woman happy. And she got worse. \n\nMy in laws threw an engagement party which was pretty much because of my mother. My in-laws made sure that it was as amazing as she would ever want. During this party my father-in-law brought out a surprise cake for mother-in-law has it was her birthday the next day. You should have seen my mothers eyes, like daggers. I’ll never forget. She truly looked like a real life witch. The next day I went home and asked my mother about how she enjoyed the party, it was exactly the party she had dreamed of. In fact it truly was only for her. She says to me, I know the reason you had this party,  I know that it is all about THEM (in laws).  I saw how happy you were when the cake came out. I know that you’re on their side now. \n\nAll of this after my in laws threw a 200 person party after she screamed and pouted for months as that’s the only way it could be. (Of course using me - saying my daughter deserves this sort of thing). In Indian culture the grooms side often throws the engagement party. \n\nI am born and raised in the US and my cultural background is Indian. She has used culture as an excuse for the way she acts time and time again. \n\nFast forward - the wedding was a blur. By all means a perfect epic weekend. 500 people amazing attire and food and friends. People say it was one of the most fun weekends of their life. To my husband and I it’s a blur. \n\nAnyway point of this post. I am NC with my mother now. For a variety of reasons. But I reached my breaking point a few months after we got married. I learned she has no respect for me and even less for my husband. Yet if I was unmarried she would verbally abuse me daily and make sure I knew I was making them look bad in society.  Yet I found the “perfect” guy and she causes even more torture. No winning with evil narcissists. Over the winter I’ll share just one of many stories. She calls us at 2 am screaming my dad is having chest pain. I frantically get up and start going through the logical steps. Tell them to call 911 and that I’m in my way etc. my father has a long standing history of heart disease so this is no small thing. I hear her whisper in the background and then my dad. She gets back on the phone and says oh I dunno I think he’s better. She puts my enabling dad on my phone and he says this whole story about how sometimes when parents are sad and alone because of what their children do they feel these things in their heart. Okay so you’re calling me at 2 am to tell me that I am creating a heart attack in you, and you are now testing how I will react at this hour. \n\nWow. I have so much more to say but this is a start.   So what does this have to do with my husband, he has suffered a lot over the last few years. He came from an amazing family. My extended family is pretty terrible and narcissistic just like my mother. When I met my husband, when we were just dating, his family was kind enough to invite us to all of their events such as Christmas and the holidays. At first my parents thought this was amazing. They went on and on about how I found the most amazing guy and family. They would brag about it to all of their Indian friends of course. But then as time went on all she would do was sit in the corner at such an event and pout, she would come home and say that their family is fake and that they’re just putting on a show. It goes on, I will start it off with something positive becoming evil negative, just on a whim. This is how these mothers are. So at the end as you see above, during the time we were getting married, my parents were convinced that my fiancé‘s parents are evil. That they were trying to steal me away from them. The funny thing is that an Indian culture, marriage is about the unity and union between two families. Nope, not with my mother, it was all about her. Like I said I wasn’t able to pinpoint how bad this was until halfway into our wedding planning. It was a huge lightbulb, but of course there’s so much trauma to undo now. Not to mention my upbringing that is a whole other story. My husband these days often suffers from symptoms that are worse than mine. He is quite depressed, fatigued , and has a lot of emotional flashbacks. I am doing my best to heal and find clarity, which I am making great progress in, but at the same time I am also supporting him. He also has a good amount of resentment as to how much abuse and toxicity I projected onto him during the time that I was blind to what my mother was doing. It was pure transference of her hatred on to him.",

My dad died last year, and since their sole source of income had been his disability and social security checks, my brother had no money with which to continue paying the mortgage.  I gave him the entirety of our dad's life insurance policy, but I knew it wouldn't last long and told him to save it for a new place of his own.  \n\nNow the increasingly dilapidated house I lived in from birth to high school graduation has officially been foreclosed on, emptied of all its contents (including my older brother), and placed on the market.  It wasn't in good condition when I lived there (hoard house, flooded basement and subsequent mold problems, no general maintenance), but now it's worse.  There are random holes in some of the walls, water damage in multiple rooms, and the realtor websites indicate \"some improvements may require special financing.\"  It's not really in a livable state right now and probably hasn't been since I was a child.\n\nThere are photographs online now of every room.  It's like browsing pictures from my nightmares since so many of my nightmares are set there.  It's surreal.  I have no idea where my brother went, and I'm not sure if my mother is still in the low-end assisted living home that keeps her.  I am hundreds of miles away and could buy the house in cash and raze it to the ground if I wanted.  I could even pay my brother and mother enough money to show up, and then film them watching the house they both wanted but neither could keep being razed to the ground.  I won't though.

But I kept doing that for years and years because I could feel my narcissistic mother's suffering. I once said to her, \"Mom, if you can't trust your own children love you, who can you trust?\" And I literally saw her start to cry, then disassociate, then forget what we were talking about. (I know that forgetting well because it has also happened to me in therapy when my therapist jogged me forward a little too fast.) \n\nWhen I left my entire family, I got angry. This allowed me to reclaim my life because I could look at all of the traumatic instances that happened and say, \"That WAS bad! And if my parents had liked me as a person, it wouldn't have happened.\"  The anger made me more accepting of myself, as from realizing I wasn't a bad kid, I can begin to embrace myself as the adult I am. I have learned that:\n\n1. If I am myself, and I act like myself, that is not a bad thing. In fact when fear begins to overtake me, I can ground and center myself and know that I am not a bad person and people will not be irreparably hurt by me acting like myself. \n2. After the past had been mended, to look back into it is to gaze back into the void. I can bring myself back to the present moment by using my five senses. I can look at nature, I can hear the birds, I can smell my aromatherapy oil, I can touch my hair, I can take a sip of water with lemon and cucumber, or enjoy my tea. \n3. When I miss my family, I can light a candle for them or say a prayer from my heart and mind about their health and happiness. \n4. I can trust in my strength and resilience. \n5. I can be comfortable with others by holding space for them, and be comfortable knowing that Enemies are something I created with my mind so that I do not get hurt by people. Most people are not narcissists. However I can also choose how little or how much I would like to engage with people. I hold space for myself. ",

(I should say that its a long distance relationship haha). \n\nAll in all I know he likes me, but I hate being so dependent on my feelings.

And that's, them trying to get your attention, no matter what.\n\nIf you don't give it to them, they'll do something controversial. They'll say something controversial to you about you, because that earns them 20 mins of conversation/your time (while you are taking the bait and 'putting them straight') or they'll say something controversial about themselves...so they are in your head for that bit longer.\n\nAt work, if you refuse to look at the narcs that crave your attention, they'll find any reason to float around your desk. They'll make remarks about what you wear, challenge your authority, patronise and belittle.\n\nWhy do they do this? For the same reason that narcs always behave the way they do. Deep down they feel insignificant. They feel they are not living the life they deserve. The life they have doesn't reflect the amazing people they are.  SMH.\n\nMy advice is not to rise to it. Play a game with yourself where when you talk/text  these people you are only allowed to use as few words possible. Dismiss the fk out of them, internally and externally. Remind yourself what is high and low value in your life. Set your priorities straight.",

        "text": "Hi RBN community! This will be a series of posts, I moved finally out from a very abusive situation, and I think I clearly need to participate here to heal from what I call poison. I start with one of my most strong feelings that has overwhelmed me for so long (even before moving out). \n\n\nSo I'm an Italian and my family was really abusive. My parents were a mess of psychological health but somehow they always managed to make everyone believe they were perfect and I was a really screwed up crazy bad child :(. From now on you'll see me using quotes (\"family\", \"parents\"etc...) because I don't believe that to my family and parents, to my they were just a tragedy, and it's time to move on. For long they had convinced me too and that's another story, I'm still kinda conflicted internally.\n\n\nSo it seems as though there's an antisocial poison inside me. I'm not really dangerous at all, but I kinda *fear*. Sometimes someone is coming upstairs in the building and my breath freeze. It likes is when my father used to come upstairs where my room was, and it wasn't fun times. Plus, maybe I should say I was bullied like hell, in school. It started when I was 10 I think and it really messed up me. Sometime I think I was a difficult guy or something too due to my situation at \"home\", but yeah, it was nothing good for sure. Today, I often find myself thinking people around me are constantly dislike me. Like I'm some kind of alien! My betterhelp counselor remember me is just my past yes, and it's probably right. But it is causing me many troubles. First of all, I'm alone. Second of all, I really have troubles and a conflicted time anytime that I have to interact with human, even if I don't interact and they're just around me. This isn't constant, there's some good moment I'm so strong it seems like I can control all this, but those moments are kinda not constant and I don't really understand very well when and how to make them happen. Even if a RBN Redditor would speak with me I'd still think this one must dislike me... What did I do wrong, what can I do... (PS.: Btw some days ago I was carrying heavy groceries, some kilometers, I left my town but I still live in a remote area. Two times idiots with a car screamed, young folks, it's probably an uncivil and unpolite trend in Italy, same like with girls or riding a motorcycle fast as hell when going in a town in the night. I don't know if it was their way of being cool, but it hurted inside. The groceries were way heavier after that, they kilometers and weight was easy for me, it seems like I'm strong for that, but their screams was like when I was bullied, it hurts inside, emotionally or something, and I'm not so strong maybe with that, or maybe is just too much).\n\n\nIt's difficult and my old therapist was abusive showing all the red flags that are discussed on post like \"Finding a good therapist\" (linked in the wiki) and that one, together with my family always gaslighting and projecting, that again, just made the situation worse  (that's why I pay for  betterhelp, my small Italian town was quite bad in every sense I think).\n\n\nI think writing this already helped me, thank you to anyone who took the time to read it. There's so many things I never say, Reddit is probably a godsend. Sometimes Redditors too don't think what they say, me too probably, but this place is kinda safe and it's amazing. Last but not least, In appreciate any kind of comment on this, and if you've some experience too, please tell me what you think on this argument.",

If they did, they'd know they had no say in it, no control over it, nothing. Whether or not you're happy is always up to you. \n\n",

And yet, very few people ever took as much public abuse from the egregiously narcissistic [Mao Zedong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong) as the very same guy, and lived to tell about it... as a patient reading of that Wikipedia entry and such books as R. J. Lifton's *Revolutionary Immortality* and Gao Wenqian's *The Last Revolutionary* make very clear. \n\nConsidered by many cult experts to have been the most \"successful\" *guru* in history, Mao was one crafty and truly vicious control freak. So good at it was he, that he built an immense, intimidation-caged cult of personality that wrested control of the world's most populace nation from the American- and European-supported [Chiang Kai-shek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Kai-shek) after the fall of the [Japanese Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan) in 1945. \n\nForty-two years after Mao's death, however, he is rarely pointed to in official literature as China's liberator or founding father. Yet new statues of and other memorials to Zhou continue to pop up from one end of China to the other. \n\nZhou -- it seems -- knew how to do whatever it took to help his people even if it meant *apparently* bending to the will of the Chairman of the Party. I bring all this up because I found myself stuck in a deal with a narc business associate with a dire need to believe herself to be smarter and better than everyone else she encounters. Disgusted as she is by what happened to her as a child and the manner in which she tried to deal with it as an adult, she cannot allow herself to observe to notice to recognize to acknowledge to accept to own the emotional pain she has accumulated over decades of narcissistic abuse to family members and others. \n\nWhen I first knew her, she seemed to be trying to deal with it, but I later saw that -- like so many who only engage in \"therapy\" for the sake of further ego-empowerment -- she had conned her therapists (and others) into providing her with numerous tools she uses to bend others to her fantasy-saturated will. Her projections of righteous judgment, criticism, moral superiority and (ostensibly but not actually) flawless performance on her part have chased off a number of more [mindful](https://www.google.com/search?q=mindfulness&amp;oq=mindful&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0j69i60j69i59j0l2.5000j1j8&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) former friends.

And then I ran into Mao and Zhou. \n\nZhou -- who'd actually recruited Mao into the Party in the 1920s -- was the charismatic but dysfunctionally [ideological](https://www.google.com/search?q=ideologue&amp;oq=ideologue&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.8103j1j8&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) and dogmatic Mao's pragmatic [major domo](https://www.google.com/search?q=major+domo&amp;oq=major+domo&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.4067j1j8&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) from the 1930s onward. Because No One could truly get things done like Zhou. (In the main because he reportedly understood people and how to get along with them.) \n\nLeft to his own election, Zhou would have fashioned a very different modern, post-colonial China from the tortured mess Mao made, and re-made, of it during the era of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. And he tried to. But, while realizing that Zhou was hugely popular with the masses as well as the most effective administrator available, Mao had to grind Zhou in public on several occasions. (Think \"way past the Donald and his tweets about the people who work for him.\") Zhou was subjected again and again to gross and relentless public humiliations and rehabilitations from the mid-1950s into the early 1970s. \n\nAnd he took it. All pretty much in stride. Because Zhou knew his purpose. Which was no less than a China of, by and for the people.

Mao on the other hand, appears to have been an egotistical power fiend. \n\nMy abuser is far from as insufferable as Mao Zedong. (\"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words...\" and all that.) But rather than push back against her now, I have learned to allow her to spew into a void, more or less as any Confucian-, Taoist- and Buddhist-aware martial arts competitor allows his opponent to expend his energy without resistance thereto. I just remind myself as I start to \"feel the burn\" that I can *Zhou* my way around it all... and get right back to doing what I came here to do. ",

        "text": "Hey all, I had a bad experience with a therapist who turned out to be a N / abuser sympathizer, thought I would both let off some steam and raise awareness of people like this by talking about the red flags that showed up in my interactions with them.\n\n* Told me that, technically, \"I am my parents\" because I was born from them.\n\n* Did what I like to call, 'playing hopscotch', whenever talking about my parents. Rather than condemning what my NParents did to me, and accepting that I (justifiably) wanted nothing to do with them, they would hope that my relationship with my EDad was getting better; and imply that, despite me going no-contact with my parents, that I was going to \"move past the hurt [NParents] caused [me]\" and eventually see them again.\n\n* Told me that they were physically abused by their father from a young age, but despite that, is still in full contact with them and it's _all cool now_.\n\n* Casually asked how my parents were doing.\n\n* More playing hopscotch, saying that my EDad was a \"good guy\" and that he \"definitely loves me\" in the face of the blatant abuse/neglect.\n\n* Priority was getting me to forgive my NParents, apparently for my own sake of moving on past the hurt they caused. (this isn't always necessarily a red flag)\n\nLong story short, I said some things that this individual didn't like, the mask came off, and they started sounding exactly like my NMom. They told me some straight-up abusive, bullying things that should NOT be said to a client in this field.\n\nAdditionally, this person was not a licensed therapist, but an 'alternative healer.' This is kind of a PSA that, if you do go to an 'alternative' healer/therapist/etc - it will be much, much harder to get recourse against them if they turn out to be like this. While standard licensed therapists have accountability, and can be reported, if you go to one of these people, and they happen to burn you, you may find yourself without any proper way to hold them accountable. Be careful out there!",

I think that time, distance, and less anticipation/anxiety of her phone number displaying on my phone screen are key factors to my diminishing anger. As of right now, I would rather just focus on other areas in my life (e.g. career, health, hobbies, etc.) than on her.\n\nBear in mind that I have NO plans of reconciliation with her. I think that forgiving AND forgetting is unwise and will repeat the cycle of abuse. That makes as much sense as me trying to befriend a poisonous snake after it bit me. I can accept a snake's venomous nature, but that doesn't mean I have to accept being around it. Granted, it's possible that my nAunt can change like any other human being. However, change is dependent on her and our last conversation didn't convince me that she's changed enough to where we wouldn't have another incident similar to the one that made me distance myself from her.\n\nI'm sure that I'll have flying monkeys to confront, but most of my responses to them will be wielded with detachment (ideally). As an adult, I shouldn't have to JADE to them anyway.",

        "text": "I wrote this as a reply to an OP and wanted to share it here as it helped me organise a lot of my thoughts about primitive childhood\n\nAn N mother's emotional abuse.\n\nInsidious is the perfect word. Disguised as love.\n\nThis is the most harmful aspect of it. As children in nature we have a basic human instinct to be bonded to our mother. This is without thought. For an NMom to take advantage of this innocent dedication and dependency - there could be \"almost(not comparing)\" no greater abuse.\n\nMother's know that no one depends on them more than their own children. A young infant can not truly LIVE without his mother - without her nourishment. Humans and the wild.\n\nSo Imagine a baby Lion getting kicked daily after his feedings from the lioness. Allowed feedings on some days but not others, with no consistency. Sometimes finding that the lioness is nowhere to be found, and sometimes finding she is smothering.\n\nOdd to think of it this way. And unlikely in nature. Yet this is what our mothers did. They took advantage of the innocent dependence of a young child and manipulated it to Feed their fragile narcissistic soul. A soul that can not be fed. And thus it was a bottomless pit. An endless cycle.\n\nMoreover this abuse was disguised as love. Yes. And sure there were time where the mother did show \"love and concern.\" Motherly traits. But all to throw it back in our face years later. So by definition that is not true love. Even a broken clock is right twice a day. So If any positive behavior did emanate from her, it's because it just so happened to.\n\nShe disguised her behavior as being good for us, for being caring, for being an exceptional mother. For being something special. They always do see themselves as elite and special, but also battered and hopeless.\n\nThere is nothing quite like emotional insidious abuse from a mother. No matter what the language, culture, socioeconomic status. The mother - child relationship is the same. No child should have to grow up with fear and inconsistency, the burden to appease their mother, with conditional love.\n\nUnconditional love from a mother is not a prize. It is the standard.",

I saw that I cannot fix her, and no one can. And so I had to let myself go.",

She couldn't take medications, as she was severely allergic to certain compounds/manufacturing ingredients as well as she was artistic (the medications always brought her back too quickly to earth). \n\nEvery breath, every word, every smile was a piece of art she wanted to share with the world. She was one of the only ones that validated and spoke with me about my Nparents' abuse, and heavily encouraged me to keep sharing my heart and my art with the world, despite the many violent attempts at control they would exert over me, especially as I wasn't allowed to even pick up a pencil for non-academic reasons. When I spoke to her before I fled for college in 2013, she knew deep down it would be the last time. She had held onto my hands, and told me to never look back. This was spoken with the strongest bit of clarity I had ever seen from her. \n\nI graduated, and then found a job in 2017 where I began making plans to try and come see her. Then I got the news, from a new Facebook profile my Nmom made to try and message me, that my aunt's funeral was two days prior. I'm still feeling guilty over what was left unsaid, that I wasn't able to share my projects with her, that I wasn't there to help take care of her in her final hours, that I couldn't give her the same comfort she unconditionally gave me.\n\nI loved her so much. \n\nI missed her. \n\nI miss her.
