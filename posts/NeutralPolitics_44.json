        "text": "One of the biggest news stories in the UK currently is the leak/release of Labour's manifesto for the 2017 general election, which you can find through here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39877439\n\nMany of these proposals - such as re-nationalising the railways, spending £8bn pounds on social care, building 100,000 new homes - will be expensive. Labour say they will be able to pay for its policies by increasing taxes on the rich, for example 'increasing income tax for the highest-earning 5% to raise an extra £6bn for the NHS'.\n\nWhile Labour have rejected this, this current manifesto has been compared to their previous pledges in the 1970s and 80s, especially the 1983 manifesto: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2017-39872189. Those policies remain controversial today - the high income tax-rates of 1970s Britain under Labour (83% on the richest earners) even caused Rod Stewart to move to L.A. and name an album about it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Crossing\n\nGranted, this is just one case of a very rich guy packing up because he's being taxed quite highly. But there are numerous studies that support both sides of the argument: that rich people do leave - in significant enough numbers - when a high tax-rate is introduced, or that rich people don't leave - in significant enough numbers - when one is introduced (have put links at the bottom).\n\nSo...\n\n- Which side is generally supported by economists?\n- If it exists, has the frequency of 'rich migration' varied over time?\n- And do the benefits of higher taxes outweigh the impact of those high earners leaving?\n\n*Note: if it helps for the argument, this can be related to taxes over than income-tax. Capital gains, property, inheritance etc., but income-tax is the main one I'm focused on atleast. Also, this is mainly concerned with the West/US and UK, but with the nature of globalisation today I can understand how practically all countries' tax-rates may link into it.*\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n- https://www.forbes.com/sites/beltway/2016/05/26/do-high-state-taxes-drive-away-millionaires-not-really/#6a56429a360f - Do High State Taxes Drive Away The Rich?

In an [interview Lester Holt](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/05/11/president_trumps_full_interview_with_lester_holt.html) yesterday, he said the following:\n\n&gt;I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won.\n\n&gt;And the reason they should've won it is the electoral college is almost impossible for a Republican to win. It's very hard because you start off at such a disadvantage. So, everybody was thinking they should've won the election. This was an excuse for having lost an election.\n\n\nIn an [AP interview](https://www.apnews.com/c810d7de280a47e88848b0ac74690c83) on April 21st, he said: \n\n&gt;The Democrats, they have a big advantage in the electoral college. Big, big, big advantage. I’ve always said the popular vote would be a lot easier than the electoral college. The electoral college — but it’s a whole different campaign (unintelligible). The electoral college is very difficult for a Republican to win, and I will tell you, the people want to see it. They want to see the wall, they want to see security. \n\nHe's also tweeted about it a few times:\n\n[April 16:](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/853595628655587334)\n\n&gt;I did what was an almost an impossible thing to do for a Republican-easily won the Electoral College! Now Tax Returns are brought up again?\n\n\n[March 20:](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/843776582825267201)\n\n&gt;The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College &amp; lost!\n\nIs there any evidence to back up these claims that the Democrats have an advantage and the Republicans have a disadvantage in the electoral college? Beyond that, is there any evidence to support the idea that the electoral college favors or disfavors *any* particular parties?\n",

The vast majority of the interview centres around the economy, specifically Trump's economic worldview and his intentions regarding policy.\n\nUsing the interview as the basis for the leader in this week's edition of the magazine The Economist[ takes a very dim view](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21721904-impulsiveness-and-shallowness-americas-president-threaten-economy-well-rule) of what it calls \"Trumponomics\"\n\nWithout detailed and scored spending plans it is, of course, hard to fully assess the Trump's policies. However, the interview is broad and I think shows enough of Trump's thinking to allow one to take a view. \n\nIn view of this, I was curious as to what the potential benefits and downsides of his economic policies/plans/thinking, would be? And whether they are politically feasible would congress  allow him to go as far as he seems to want to? ",

How many (or what) senators have to sign off on this invitation for it to be binding on the Committee?\n\n2. What can he now testify on as a private citizen? WSJ is now saying Comey was concerned information showed potential evidence of collusion (link to primary source pending; reported on MSNBC [here](http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word) and [WSJ was quoted here again](https://boingboing.net/2017/05/10/trump-is-crazy-and-comey-knew.html).\n \n3. [NYT stated \"Last week, James B. Comey asked a Justice Department official for an increase in resources for the F.B.I.’s Russia investigation. That official then wrote the memo used to justify his firing.\"](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/10/us/politics/comey-russia-investigation-fbi.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news) So can Comey testify that as to the status of the investigation, including what's been discovered?  I imagine he could at least give his opinion as to why he thinks he was fired but, again, I don't know. \n\n4. Is there whistleblower protection for Comey, in the event he requires it or requests it? \n \n5. What can Senators talk about to the public after the hearing, especially in light of possible revelations?  Do they not have similar whistleblower protections that may override their duties of confidentiality?\n\n6. What are the legal ramifications if the Congressional testimony of a witness like Comey directly contradicts the president's statements? \n\nEDITED to adhere to the rules.",

Attorney General Jeff Sessions had been charged with coming up with reasons to fire him, the officials said.\n\n[Some analysts](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/us/politics/trump-fbi-investigation-nixon.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=b-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news) [have compared the firing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/05/09/cnns-toobin-on-comey-firing-what-kind-of-country-is-this/) to the [Saturday Night Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Massacre) during the Watergate scandal with President Nixon.\n\nWhat evidence do we have around whether the stated reasons for the firing are accurate in and of themselves, as well as whether or not they may be pretextual for some other reason?\n\n---\n\nMod footnote: I am submitting this on behalf of the mod team because we've had a ton of submissions about this subject.
