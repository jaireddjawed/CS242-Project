        "text": "Hello,\n\nFor context, I'm starting out in a STEM PhD program in a field where women are underrepresented. I am a native of the country I'm going to school in and the friend in question is not.\n\nOne of the first friends I made here started to cause problems with my other friends, who were women. They said he was being sexist and disagreed with his opinions, the main issue being that he would tell people that they should stop complaining and just work harder.\n\nAt the time I disagreed but continued to be his friend and disagree whenever these issues came up. I felt that as a man it was my place to keep him in line since given his attitude, I didn't think he would take the complaints from the other women seriously.\n\nAnyway, after this incident, he would constantly talk sarcastically about how he was 'cancelled' and the 'racist misogynist' of the department, as well as recalling the confrontation as her 'screaming at him' and calling her a bitch, even though he knew I was friends with her.\n\nOver time, this kept happening and my calm disagreements weren't having any affect. Moreover, he started to offend other people in the department with his behavior so last week I privately and forcefully confronted him, saying that he was being fragile and acting in a sexist way. In particular I emphasized that this is not about politics, but about keeping in mind his privilege and the effect of his behavior on other people who are less privileged. At the time he didn't say much other than that he acted this way because of his native culture, which is understandable, although I probably wouldn't be so deprecating to his culture.\n\nNow this week, he made a point to steer to topic away from politics every time it came up in conversation with other friends, 'joking' that they can talk about it as long as I leave. Moreover, he has been making passive aggressive comments around other friends that people in his country are mature enough to talk about issues, and going out of his way to praise some people in the department since he actually respected them, unlike a bunch of other people.\n\nAfter all this, I'm frankly pissed and I feel blatantly disrespected. I felt like I handled this in a mature and private way but it seems like my efforts have failed. I want to confront him next time I see him and completely burn the bridge over this, but he is quite popular and we are both probably stuck here for the next four or five years.\n\nAs such I'm not really sure what to do. How should I go forward with this conflict in a mature and professional way?\n\nThank you!",

How should I draft this so that it's different than a normal LOR from an old professor or boss?\n\nI know that being asked to draft/write your own LOR is pretty common, and I've found a lot of great advice on that through this subreddit, but I wasn't able to find anything specifically about when the \"writer\" is the same person who's lab I will be joining. I feel like there should be some extra nuance or specific things I mention, given the fact that this letter is essentially them vouching for me to work with themselves, along with the fact that they are already an established member of that program and uni, most likely are acquaintances with the review committee, etc.\n\nIs there anything in particular I should mention or anything specific I should focus on due to these unique circumstances, or should just I draft it as I should with any other LOR with some emphasis on my ability to succeed in their lab? Any ideas if this letter would have any significant weight on my acceptance chances into the program? Thanks in advance.",

I haven’t been able to find a community of undergrad writers for thesis writing, so I thought this sub was my best bet; I apologize if I’m posting in the wrong place due to my demographic. \n\nThat being said, I’m writing a 60-80 page thesis, and I’m nearing the end of my first semester (it’s a two-semester thesis). I’ve read maybe like half of my bibliography and I haven’t written much. At first, I was very excited and eager to work with my advisor. I had taken a class with them and thought that they would challenge me. However, they ghosted me in the beginning of the semester before we could talk about expectations. I had emailed and called their office, and then, managed to get a hold of them during their office hours a month later. \n\nAnyway, after realizing that my advisor was a) busy, and b) relatively uninterested, I’ve struggled to find motivation and find myself pouring work and time into other projects and endeavors. I was wondering if anybody has any advice for thesis writing. I plan on setting a regular schedule for myself moving forward, and plan on getting a lot done during break before the next semester. But has anybody here ever had an unresponsive or very busy advisor? Do you have any tips for motivating yourself or even for navigating thesis writing when your advisor can be absent? \n\nAny advice is welcome and appreciated. Thank you.",

        "text": "Hello! I recently graduated from college with a degree in dance. I'm an international student but I got my degree in the US. I applied to five master's programs last season and got accepted by two of them with very minimal aid (MA in DanceEd @ NYU and MSc in Dance Therapy @ Pratt). Pratt gave me 50% off tuition. After going back and forth trying to get a TAship or anything of that sort, they told me they couldn’t give more aid. The folks at NYU said their program is too small for their department to ever really give them any waivers or stipends. They also told me that whatever little aid they gave me was given by mistake and took it back (lmfao). \n\nLong story short, after a summer of trying everything to get the money together (applying to dozens of scholarships, working two jobs, selling art I made in college, convincing friends to let me live with them in exchange for doing chores, crowdfunding, even considering taking the only loan I could take @ 12% lol) I couldn’t. I deferred at Pratt and I dropped out at NYU, since they don't allow deferrals. Since I wasn't going to school any longer, my visa also expired and I had to leave the US. \n\nI am now applying for PhDs, since I don't think I could ever go through what I did this year, constantly trying to find money everywhere (and finding little) and living with the constant dread that my financial situation will stop me from advancing my career. So since I wanted to go for a doctorate anyway, I am now going for that since they are funded, some even with stipends. \n\n**My question is, how honest should I be about this?** Many schools want me to detail why I want to pursue a PhD and I have my original reason, to teach at the college level, but the reason why I am applying *without* a master's is simply because I couldn’t afford it. I don't want them to think I am just too lazy and want to skip right to the PhD. Or should I discuss with their grad coordinator or other staff who might know? \n\nI got one rejection already, from a school where I was pretty honest about this with the graduate coordinator (not in the application though), who eventually said, in the decision letter, that they think I should get a master's first. To be honest I found this so insensitive, considering she knew my history. So now I wonder if, in the other apps, I should be upfront about this and tell them I am also applying for doctoral study because without the funding I could never afford a master's.  I tend to be an overly honest and sharing person, so it would not feel strange for me to express this, but I also don't want these committees to think that I couldn’t get into a master's or think of me as \"that poor one.\"\n\nI appreciate your advice so much!\n\nAlso, some stuff to clarify: I want to live and work in the US, so I want to get my degree there too. I don't/wouldn’t feel safe in my home country and I already built a life in the US. I will reapply to some master's where I have a better chance of getting aid. Since I don't have access to FAFSA many of the schools don't know that I am low-income, since they usually just use that data in determining institutional aid. There is only one loan company that gives non-citizens loans with no co-signer, that's the one that charges 12% (so at NYU I would have had to pay 86k on a 50k loan, assuming I do it right). And so far my undergrad degree hasn't been paying the bills, so I doubt I would have that sort of money.",

Meanwhile, results about my #1 choice won’t be out for four more months.\n\nI have a realistic shot at getting a spot at my #1 choice, so I don’t want to write it off by accepting my #2 choice. But there’s also a decent chance that I won’t get in, so I don’t want to miss the opportunity of being in my #2 school.\n\nMy question is: has anyone ever accepted a university offer, and then rescinded it after getting accepted to a better choice?\n\nI know that’s not very ethical, I literally got this acceptance letter half an hour ago so I’m just brainstorming what do to. Keep in mind that I don’t need to put down a deposit if I accept #2, nor have I applied for any scholarships yet.",

They've also been advising me on a project but they keep disagreeing with someone else who has been giving me advice -- that person has over 1000 citations.\n\n1. Will their lack of citations affect how their letter is viewed?\n2. Will the number of citations affect their tenure prospects?\n3.

        "text": "So, I have been wondering this lately, as I am selecting my grad schools and I was wondering if I could have all of your opinions. So I have a list of schools with possible research that I am very interested in. However, I don't know how to gage my profile, to narrow them down. A bit of my background:\n\nI am an engineering student, graduating with honors and distinction with a 3.83/4 GPA. I have 2 publications, although they are not in my engineering field, they were from a time I was undecided and participated with other departments. I have 1 thesis written and defended, in my own field of study. I have 4 years of research, although 2 of them are in other engineering's. I have worked as a TA before as well. I won't be submitting any GREs, as I have been advised by multiple professors not to do that. Finally, I have 3 recommendation letters from professors in my field that know me well, and can vouch for my research skills, and for me as person.\n\nThe thing is, I have this experience, but I don't know what that means, I don't know what is the profile of who I am going against, when applying. How did you figure that out? Is there like a website or community that compile some data on that? Any help would be greatly appreciated!",

        "text": "I’ve been fighting demons these past night trying to come to a decision. I got into these three schools for a masters in mechanical engineering with thesis option. None are offering any money or assistance, this makes sense though since  I’m coming into a spring semester. I would need to take out loans my first semester regardless of where I go and get a part time job. All locations have accommodations for a hobby I have but I would like a friend to be able to hang out with, I’m too lonely in undergrad lol.\n\nOptions and some notes: \nUniversity of Florida- cheapest housing and some good possible opportunities for funding later down the line. Also has grad housing which is even cheaper if I manage to get one of those. I also have a chance at maybe getting a teaching position in the chem department as I teach chem at my current undergrad. Has cool labs and research in my concentration of controls and robotics.\n\nUniversity of central Florida- good school and a lot of jobs around the area that have benefits. I have a friend there so I’ll have someone to hangout with for about two semesters before they graduate. Cheapest tuition, housing can be as expensive as Manhattan although there can be plenty of options found.\n\nCity college of New York- very good school but they said they do not have a track record of offering assistantships for masters but almost all masters students come out nearly debt free. I’ll be able to live by my Aunty, which covers housing and food, on Long Island but the commute will be very long(~2.5 hour train ride or 1-1.5 hour drive during morning rush). I feel like the commute after working might take too much time from working on my thesis but I don’t really know how much time grad students actually have. There are a lot of part time jobs in New York and CCNY federal work studies( I know other schools offer that as well).\n\nHealthcare is also very very important since I have recently been diagnosed with a few illnesses and need insurance to afford the medicine. This makes getting a job with benefits important if I stay in Florida whereas New York i can apply for Medicaid.\n\nI don’t know which one to choose, I like them all and each have their own cons. I also self toured all schools but it was kind of rushed since my parents was rushing to leave. \n\nI did apply to some scholarships and fellowships but they are for fall 23 school year. I would appreciate anyone’s help, I know it’s last minute but I just can’t make a set decision.",
