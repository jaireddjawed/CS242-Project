        "text": "I'll start this off by saying I myself am a hunter, mostly because I've grown up with it as a normal thing and never really thought twice about it. As I've gotten older my passion and appreciation for wildlife and the British Columbia outdoors grew to the point where I knew I wanted some type of career involved in that field. I've always been aware of the conflict between hunters and non-hunters, and being a hunter myself I've always just assumed the being bashing hunters didn't really know what they were talking about and wanted to stop hunting because animals make cute babies. With the BC provincial election coming up there has been a lot of controversy surrounding whether or not BC should continue to allow Grizzly Bear hunting. People have opposite opinions on seemingly easily topics like is the Grizzly Bear endangered, does hunting actually help population numbers and of course anyone can find any number of sources on the internet to support their claim, whatever it is (although nobody seems to use sources). I can see the harm in allocating increasing amounts of tags to outfitters for foreign investors but I also see the benefit in the large amount of money they will bring to the area. So is hunting really as beneficially to conservation and wildlife management as I have been led to believe or is there some underlying major issues with it?",

        "text": "I am not a great sales person, so bare with me as I explain what is going on.  Most of the story of the property is told on the GoFundMe link below, but I want to add a bit more about it.\n\nI've been working with my county conservation department as a volunteer for a bit over a decade now.  I primarily do public education about reptiles and amphibians, but also conduct surveys of the public properties.  In 2011, I needed to do some trapping on a small sand ridge to see if Ornate Box Turtles were still present.  The problem was, that most of the open sand areas were covered in Staghorn Sumac (aka Smooth Sumac).  This is a native species, but it gets out of control and can quickly take over an area if not controlled.  I talked with the land maintenance guys about mowing down the sumac to open an area to run drift fence and pitfalls to check for box turtles.  They kept telling me they would do it over the winter when the ground was frozen, but it never got done.\n\nThis is normally where a person might start complaining about the conservation department not doing anything, and letting a property go to waste, or any other such argument, but not me.  I work quite a bit closer with the county than most other volunteers.  I am close friends with much of the staff, and get involved with a lot of the politics of conservation in the area.  One thing I have learned over the last decade, is that every year new land gets donated to the conservation department, but the land never comes with any money to help maintain it.  So the number of acres the county has to maintain grows, but their budgets to maintain it doesn't.  I kept hounding the land maintenance guys to do something though, hoping they would eventually get to it.\n\nIn 2013, I starting doing some work with Ornate Box Turtles in a neighboring county, and learned a lot of about their habitat requirements, or more importantly, their lack of such requirements, at least in adults.  It gave me some new hope about the well being of turtles in the area around the sand ridge.  My thoughts changed from \"We need to do something\", to \"I need to do something\", so I set out with a pair of loppers and started cutting the brush to keep the last bit of the sand ridge open for nesting.\n\nI started getting interested in the history of the property, so I looked up historic aerial photos of the area.  I found photos as far back as the 1930s, showing that the ridge was once wide open, with hardly any trees.  Hand lopping sumac is only really worth doing in late summer when all the energy is out of the roots up and up the trunks and branches, so when I wasn't controlling the sumac, myself and a couple friends started cutting down Cedar Trees to open up more and more area.  The county guys periodically burn our piles of trees for us, and then we cut down more.  Work on this property will continue for at least a decade, and probably longer.\n\nSo, what am I asking from the fine redditors in the Conservation community?  Please done at least one of three things.\n\n1.  Please click the link below and consider donating $5 or $10.  We aren't trying to raise too much right now, and little donations goes a long ways towards the tools and equipment we need.  Any amount raised over the current goal will be put towards future equipment we may need.\n\n2. Share the link among your friends.  The more exposure the fund raising page gets, the more donations we may be able to get.\n\n3. Be the person who stops thinking \"We need to do something\", and starts thinking \"I need to do something\".  Everyone wants to enjoy nature, but not enough people want to do the work to help conserve the natural lands we have. Even if you only have a little time to spare, conservation agencies can almost always use extra boots on the grounds to work on projects.  Talk with your local conservation agency and see if there is anything you can help with.  \n\nThanks for reading.  If you have any questions, ask away, and I will do my best to answer them.\n\nhttps://www.gofundme.com/sand-ridge-restoration-equipment",

        "text": "Hey everyone! So like everyone else here I believe that climate change is the greatest crisis of our age and I want to dedicate my life to helping deal with it in any way. I have a B.A. in Environmental Sustainability and Minors in GIS and Spanish. I speak French and Italian also. My goal is to work for some sort of non-profit but I don't have a strong Science background or field experience. I'm looking into a Professional M.S. in Environmental Conservation from a very well known University. The program is half split between hard science and soft skills like grant writing, developing economic conservation plans, GIS etc.. Will that degree help me get hired? What else can I do to improve my chances? Thanks to anyone reading and any comments welcome! ",

How can I take my skills/degree and put them to good use in regard to protecting wolves and wildlife in general? I know a lot of these organizations are nonprofit and don't have a ton of resources so PR and marketing go by the wayside. I'm just looking to help wolves and earn a supporting wage doing it. Is there any resources or anything I can use to start my search? \n\nI feel like if I could go back I'd change my major to something that is directly involved in conservation efforts but it is already much too late for that. I may go get a second degree later on but right now I just need to graduate. ",
