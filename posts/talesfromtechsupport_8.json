        "text": "I have finally cooled down enough to post about this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been supporting 3D printers for about three years now. A little over two years ago I had a customer who received a printer damaged in shipping and the replacement had a defect. I arranged for the replacement to be repaired under warranty. At the time, the warranty did not cover return shipping. As a result of this and several similar tickets, the policy was changed afterward, unfortunately too late for me to cover it for this customer. There were several other tickets opened by this customer with regard to some operating questions and he got a couple of consumable parts from a bad batch which I replaced under warranty, even after the warranty had expired. I even allowed him to call a couple of times to ask questions, something I don't do for many people. In my opinion, I did everything I could to assist this customer and make his experience as pleasant as possible, in spite of the fact that several of his tickets were the direct result of not taking care of the printer properly. Other than shipping when the warranty required it, he didn't pay anything. He also provided perfect review scores, and included several attaboys in the text of his tickets. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis warranty has been expired for a little over a year, and his last ticket was closed with an excellent survey result about 7 months ago. I was reading our forum last week and came across a post really bashing the company and the support for poor service, attitude, crappy quality, misleading warranty, and everything else you can imagine. As he was from the region that I support and I didn't remember a customer interaction that would have caused this this, I matched his username to his support tickets. Because of the huge discrepancy, I asked him about the difference between his attitude on the forum post and his support tickets, and then asked if I could possibly help with his latest problem, since I thought he was happy with the service he had received and I wanted to continue that if possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reply was that he had lied on all his support ticket surveys, that the attaboys were only to make sure that I didn't decide to stop supporting him on a whim, and that he had decided that he had no other choice to continue to receive support. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are multiple ways he could get assistance from a different agent, contact someone else, or raised a complaint. All he had to do was ask and I would have transferred him myself. He chose instead to lie about his satisfaction. I will never understand this attitude. ",

        "text": "This actually happened last week but it is still pretty fresh in my memory.\n\nTo start, a little background.  I work for a company that makes semi-custom software applications for specific business types (won't reveal what businesses just because someone found me last time I mentioned it).  We have some limitations, but we can customize the ways that they bill their customers, track schedules, payments, reports, basic business stuff really.\n\nThis customer (we will call him K for Killer, relevant later) had an obscenely difficult set up that he had to have.  In comparison, usually I can get a set up ready and going in 30 minutes.  His took over 40 hours of work and going back and forth making sure that it worked properly.  This was back in June, and in June, July, and August we had calls from this person and things were verified to be working properly each time.  The processes that he had to do on his end to make things work were minimal, but the nature of his set up meant that if he made small changes to things that he was instructed not to touch, everything would be wrong for his customers.  Also relevant.\n\nLast week, K calls in and asks for me because I set this all up.  I'll be Me:\n\nK: Well good morning, nice to talk to you, you F*cking asshole! (it only gets better from here, I promise)\n\nMe: I'm sorry, I'm not sure what I did to warrant that but I apologize if I offended you, what can I help with today?\n\nK: You f*cking B*stard, you ruined my entire business!  When you set things up, you told me everything was working fine but its not and I am not over charging my customers by over 100k this year!  And it is all your fault!\n\nMe: Okay, I'm sorry to hear that, what changes have been made since we last spoke (which was less than a week ago, mind you, and I ad confirmation recorded that everything was fine and I also have logs showing what I did vs. him)\n\nK: I didn't change shit, this is your fault, you did something and now it is completely broken!\n\nMe: I am taking a look at the logs, when we spoke last everything was working and I don't see that anyone here has touched your account, but I do see changes to x and y, were you the one that made those changes?\n\nK: Don't you f*cking accuse me, this is your fault now F*CKING FIX IT! (At this point he became extremely irate and started a rant, which I won't include all of because I stopped listening)\n\n*rant*\n\n*not listening*\n\nK: ...and I'll tell you what, if you were right in front of me right now I swear to God I would stab you in your GODDAMN FACE\n\nMe: *suddenly aware I'm speaking to a psychopath* Ok sir that's enough of that, I can either disconnect this call and fix this for you or I can disconnect the call and close your account, but this call isn't going to continue after you just threatened my life\n\nK YOU KNOW THAT I WOULD YOU -- *disconnected call*\n\nTL;DR: Guy messes up his own program, blames me, I offer to help, he threatens to kill me, I hang up\n\nBonus content: I fixed the account because I'm not that evil, but my boss ended up getting involved.  I wasn't allowed to help them anymore, and I also got notified that I can technically bring legal something or other against this guy, but screw that everyone has bad days and the guy was usually nice enough.  Sent me a really nice bottle of whiskey when I first set him up, so I'm gonna crack that open and try to forget this happened!\n\nAdd on bonus DLC: Boss told him he was going to close his account, guy begged him not to, boss said fine but he can't call support anymore, only email, and if he gets abusive again hes out.",

        "text": " \n\nThis story dates from my time working for $local\\_government. Her name was not actually MaryAnne. However, her real name shall forever be etched into my memory...\n\nCast:\n\nme: me\n\n$erp: The ERP manager\n\n$prop: The property manager\n\n$MaryAnne: The MaryAnne\n\nSo, I had recently returned to local government after about 2 years working at $regional\\_bank. I knew most of the people I was working with and was welcomed back warmly. This is a few months after the $virus\\_software rollout, so I've been working tickets for a little while, but occasionally finding things that I wasn't familiar with.\n\nOne fine Monday, a ticket comes in to setup a machine for a new user, $MaryAnne, in the Property department. They have a small form factor desktop set aside for her, and I just need to get her profile setup, her email configured, setup printers, and make sure she has everything she needs. $MaryAnne seems a bit aloof, but not unfriendly, and her setup goes quickly. I finish up her machine and think nothing more of it.\n\n?About two days go by, and I get a ticket in my queue saying that $MaryAnne needs help with her printers. I get to her desk, and I see that a few things have changed. She now has a wireless keyboard and mouse that she did not have when I set her up and she has an old laser printer on her desk, where before she was using the two networked copiers in property. One of those printers was about 8\" from her desk, the other was a brisk 20' walk away. Yes, you read that right, 8\"... Almost TOUCHING her desk.\n\nAnyway... I get the printer set up, send a test print, and I'm on my way.\n\nThe next day, I have another ticket about the printer not working. So, I go over there, and yeah, it's not behaving. I power cycle the printer and reboot the PC, but it still won't work. I reinstall the driver, and it still doesn't work. I open a support ticket with Dell and they tell me it needs a firmware upgrade. Due to other tickets, I can't make it back to her desk until the next day.\n\nThe next day, when I get to $MaryAnne, she is clearly distressed. She needed to print several things and not having HER printer caused her numerous delays. I get the firmware updated, verify that it's working, and I'm on my way. That was a Friday.\n\nOn Monday, I get a ticket requesting $erp\\_software be installed for $MaryAnne. I look in our knowledgebase ( no, not THAT one ) and see a note to contact $erp about the install.\n\n$me: (calls $erp)\n\n$erp: Hello?\n\n$me: Hey $erp! I was wondering if you could tell me what I need to do to install $erp\\_software?\n\n$erp: I normally handle $erp\\_software installs myself. Who is asking for it?\n\n$me: $MaryAnne in property.\n\n$erp: $MaryAnne doesn't need $erp\\_software to do her job. Let me contact $prop.\n\n$me: okay, thank you.\n\nA few minutes later, I get an email from $prop saying that $MaryAnne doesn't need $erp\\_software, to close the ticket, and that she will handle informing $MaryAnne.\n\nThe next day, I get a ticket from $MaryAnne saying that she needs $prop\\_software. I look up $prop\\_software in our knowledgebase ( not that one ) and see a note to contact $prop.\n\n$me: (calls $prop)\n\n$prop: Hello?\n\n$me: Hey $prop, how's it going?\n\n$prop: Doing okay, $me, how are you?\n\n$me: Doing great, can you give me some pointers on installing $prop\\_software?\n\n$prop: For who?\n\n$me: $MaryAnne...\n\n$prop: Close the ticket, she doesn't need that software, I will handle this.\n\n$prop: If you get anymore software requests from her, please notify me immediately?\n\n$me: Will do.\n\nA day or two go by and I get another ticket from $MaryAnne. Her keyboard is not working. Keep in mind, that there are three techs, and that the assignments are handed out more or less randomly by the guy who actually answers the helpdesk phone. I have no idea why I'm getting every one of her tickets. I show up at her desk and she is visibly upset to see me. I sit down at her keyboard and verify that it's not working.\n\n$me: (flips wireless keyboard over, removes old batteries)\n\n$me: Do you have any AA batteries?\n\n$MaryAnne: (screaming) I'm NOT STUPID!!!\n\n$me: I just asked if you have any batteries...\n\n$MaryAnne: (stomps off into the distance)\n\nI should note that $MaryAnne's desk is maybe 10 feet away from $prop's office. $prop heard pretty much everything. She brings over a couple of AA batteries, and apologizes for $MaryAnne. I verify that the keyboard is working, close the ticket, and move on.\n\nAn email is sent to the entire helpdesk staff including my boss later that day stating that $MaryAnne is no longer allowed to contact the helpdesk directly. All helpdesk requests must go through $prop. If we receive a ticket for $MaryAnne, we are to notify $prop immediately. $MaryAnne will undergo immediate training.\n\nThings go quietly for a few days, with no new tickets from $MaryAnne. I get a ticket from $prop to block internet access on $MaryAnne's PC. This is something that needs to be escalated to network infrastructure, and I take care of that. There are no new $MaryAnne tickets for a week or so. Then I get a ticket from $prop that some software needs to be updated on $MaryAnne's PC. $MaryAnne seems ALMOST friendly and it only takes me a few minutes to get the software updated on her PC.\n\nThe next day, I get the remove user form for $MaryAnne. All access is blocked, her account is locked, and email is put under administrative review... so long Ms. MaryAnne... I didn't know you for long, but I will remember you for a long, long time...",

        "text": "Wednesday, Jordan discovered his 3rd party credentials were not working. He called up the helpdesk, and demanded them be reset. \"This has cost me $500 already!\" he declared, and I expressed my understanding. I asked for his credentials and they were something like: P3terPan. I tried to log in and it worked without an issue. I asked if he could try and log in with them.\n\n\"No! It doesn't work for me!\"\n\n\"Can you please try it for me?\"\n\nJordan hung up and closed his helpdesk ticket.\n\n$\n\nThursday, Jordan opened a new ticket. His 3rd party credentials were still not working! \"This cost me $2K yesterday and will probably cost me $2K today!\" He rambled. I tried the password again: P3terPan. It worked.\n\n\"Can you try and log in now?\" I asked.\n\n\"No! It's not working.\"\n\n\"I reset your password,\" I lied, \"And it's the same as your old password: P3terPan.\"\n\nJordan hung up and closed his helpdesk ticket. Subsequent calls to his number went to voicemail.\n\n$\n\n\"This has cost me over 5 *Thousand* dollars this week alone,\" Jordan screeched in to the phone on friday. \"Why haven't you fixed it?\"\n\n\"Let's try your old password. P3terPan.\"\n\n\"No, that doesn't work! I already told you. Just fix this!\"\n\n\"Okay, I fixed it,\" I said, having done nothing, \"Now try and log in with that old password again.\"\n\nThe line went dead and, unsurprisingly, I saw a notification that the case had been closed.\n\n$\n\nMonday rolled around and I came in to find my boss already dealing with a frustrated client. \"Can you talk to this guy, Jordan? He says--\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" I said, and took the call. \"Twenty tousand dollars over the weekend!\" Came the anguished cry of a man who had failed to make hypothetical money, \"And it's your fault!\"\n\n\"Have you tried to log in yet today?\" I asked.\n\n\"No! It doesn't work!\"\n\n\"Why don't you think it works, if you haven't tried it?\" I forced nautrality into my tone.\n\n\"Don't play games with me! I know it doesn't work.\"\n\n\"It worked on Wednesday, right?\"\n\n\"No! It didn't!\"\n\nI scratched my head. \"You closed the ticket on Wednesday. You're saying it *didn't* work on Wednesday?\"\n\n\"Exactly! You all didn't fix it!\"\n\n\"And on Thursday, did it work then?\" I was speaking slowly and deliberately, as if to a 5 year-old.\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"What happened when you tried to log in? did it give you an error?\"\n\n\"I *didn't* try to log in, because it didn't work!\"\n\nI was beginning to understand the depths of my cleint's ineptitude. \"And you closed the ticket and didn't take my calls.\"\n\n\"Exactly!\"\n\n\"And on Friday,\" I continued, \"Did you try to log in then?\"\n\n\"No, because it didn't work!\"\n\n\"Okay. Let's try and log in right now. The password is--\"\n\nJordan hung up. But this time, I had transferred the call to my cell phone and had been walking down three flights of stairs to arrive at Jordan's office. I was now standing right at his door. I watched, with horror, as he used the keypad of the hung-up phone to dial 73837726: P-3-T-E-R-P-A-N.\n\nJordan, I discovered, had saved every password into the computer and never had to type them in. The \"computer\" part of his job consisted of printing out an auto-generated form from his desktop and bringing it with him to a daily meeting with subordinates, so he never really had a use for his keyboard. He composed emails and even managed his helpdesk ticket entirely from his cell phone and never had to log in on that, either. So, somehow, he never realized that he had to log in using the keyboard on his PC. \n\nI delicately explained the process of logging in using the keyboard. He gruffly understood, and I really hope I didn't make him feel stupid as I did so. He thanked me for my help and then grumbled about \"missing thousands of dollars\" as I left the office.\n\nI certainly was a weird day. To this day I have never met someone who had such a misunderstanding about how a computer works, or who so thoroughly grasped the concept of using a cell phone but not using a computer. But hey, it's not every day you get to meet your company's CIO.",

        "text": "I work in tech support now, but back in the day I worked in a camera shop.  \n\n\nAssisting customers with using the self service machines to print off their photos was one of the tasks required, it usually meant plugging in their memory card, loading up the images, talking them through the user interface, then spending the next hour with them showing it to them 14 more times and seeing their holiday snaps or some bullshit.  \nOne day a lady comes in with her son and the latest Canon 5D mk.fuckingwhatever, she brings her whole kit in with the 3 or 4 lenses, all with a red band around them (Canon L series $$$$), she explains that she's just been on a huge European holiday with her son, and that she now wants to print all of her 50 million photos, and that they went to Germany and Italy and France and fucking everywhere. I hold out hope that someone with this gear actually knows what they're doing with a camera, even if they're an insufferable snob.  \n\n\nNope.  \n\n\nLoad up her card, grab the pictures, they're all really blurry, super low res, I load her card up on an actual computer and find they're all in 640x480 or something, every single one looks like a dogs breakfast unless viewed from low earth orbit. The lady is getting a bit upset at me, why are all the photos blurry? This is a bajillion dollars worth of the best camera gear? Am I seriously suggesting that she's such a terrible photographer that she was able to influence the midichlorians  in her camera to create bad photos? Surely not, it must be our equipment unable to process such high definition photos, specialised equipment must obviously be required!  \n\n\nNope.  \n\n\nI asked to see her camera and checked what res she was shooting at, when I showed her and asked her why her camera was set to shoot at fuckall by fuckall, she explained that while on the plane to her European holiday, she noticed if she changed that setting, she could take more photos, like, heaps more.  \n\n\nShe was a terrible bitch, but I felt sorry for her, all of her memories of her European holiday were captured at low res and all the money in the world wouldn't fix that. Ironic. She could save others from low res settings, but not herself.   \n\n\nIt gets a little bit sadder, sort of? Maybe, happier in a way?  \n\n\nMaybe days or weeks later, a totally different lady came in to the shop with her sd card. I helped her load up the photos and was blown away by what I saw; composition, timing, lighting, colour, and they weren't shot at 15fps, she knew what she was doing before she pulled the trigger. I asked who she was, what was she shooting on, how long has she been into photography. I was expecting her to be a professional, just printing off a few cheap select snaps for a family member or something. Instead, she pulls out of her handbag, literally the cheapest Canon point and shoot we sold. $109 Kiwi dollars. She explains that she couldn't afford the big expensive stuff, she'd done a few photography workshops was in a club and really enjoyed it, she was absolutely lovely.  \n\n\nI wanted to redistribute some wealth that day.",

        "text": "A couple of weeks ago, an ex-colleague and still-friend mentioned his old mentor who had \"trouble printing\". I got nerdsniped like no tomorrow and kept asking questions, but he of course knew not much about the problem. So instead he gave me the mentor ($mnt)'s number.\n\n\nI contacted $mnt and we quickly agreed on a date for a quick first glance and see what I could do, it quickly dawned on me I was in deeper than I thought. This was the sitch:\n\n\n* $mnt had an old $fruitypc (1980s old) on which he had written (also in the 80s) an incredible piece of software, combining 4 programming languages and building a PostScript print \"manually\"  \n* his new(ish) $happy network printer did have a postscript ability but no drivers for anything older than $osEx. Of course the 'puter was an $osNein (backwards compatibilty and all that jazz).  \n* $fruitypc was on the network and _should_ have been able to print the Postscript to a network printer, even without knowing if the printer driver was locally installed (just shoot the file at the printer and hope it prints, basically. This way it used to work with the previous printer, which was of a similar type).  \n* note the _should_: the $fruitypc was refusing to connect to the network printer (or any other network device for that matter).\n\n###Day 1  \nsearching the \"hardware\" settings and ip settings, I forced the $fruitypc to not use dhcp and gave it an IP in the range of the network. Both the printer and the $fruitypc were ping-able from a laptop I had on the network, so they should be able to find one-another. Should. Apparently, $osNein did not have a cli or a ping command so no way to be sure. When adding the network printer to the \"device\" list, got an error along the lines of \"blah blah no response blah\".  \nFound an old (early 90s) $fruityBrand printer, with a physical connection that fit the $fruitypc and a driver that came preinstalled on $osNein. This printer gave us a neat test-page when connected to power, which informed us it had in its lifetime printed about 2k pages. But no connection cable was found.  \nConnection the $happy printer to the $fruitypc over USB just gave an always-on-top, non-closeable error along the lines of \"blah blah no driver blah\"\n\n###Day 2\n(note: this is about a week after day 1)  \nWe had found a connection cable for the $fruity printer, but now it refused all service - not even a test page anymore, no fans a-spinning. Dead. As a doornail.  \nWe found an installation medium disk for the $happy printer, on which was written (with permanent marker) \"plus PostScript driver\". Of course the $fruitypc had no disk drive, and since this was a $fruitybrand household, no way to extract the driver from the disk. Took the disk home.  \nTried more ways of getting the $fruitypc on the network, and then EUREKA! it had an internet connection (proven by the $doorsBrowser for $fruitybrand connecting to the $googlebing). It even connected to the $happy printer's web interface. When adding the network printer, we got a familiar message \"blah blah no response blah\"\n\n###Day 3\n(note: again a few days after day 2)  \nI had found the supposed Postscript driver (ppd file) on the disk. However it only existed in Catalan (a Spanish accent, don't ask). But as far as I knew, it should still work nicely. Installed the file on the $fruitypc, told it to use this file when we try to connect an USB printer, connected the USB printer, got a familiar message \"blah blah no driver blah\".  \nIn the mean time I had opened up the $fruity printer in hopes of getting it to do something again, and found that its internal surge protector had protected by killing itself. All good, I found a shop selling these, got it installed and got a neat testpage again (2001 prints). Connected the printer to the $fruitypc, got it working for a .txt file, tried to print with the software, printed only blank pages. Tested again with a .txt, printed only blank. Brilliant.\n\nIt's at this point I gave up while I had any hope of saving my sanity. I'm all for tease and denial, but this is not that. I have the binary for the software and plan of - at some point in the far far future - getting it to run in a virtual environment. Maybe.\n\n\n \n\n\nTL;DR: Printer and 'puter are giant teases and never quite let me finish.",

For the few problems we've had, the LED company has sent out an electrician at their expense to fix them.\n\nEarlier today, I received a call from an admin clerk at one of the branches.  There is an LED company electrician onsite who has come in to fix a faulty light.  My boss organised it with the LED company earlier this week, but I don't know anything about it.  The problem is, both the admin clerk and the electrician have walked around looking at all the lights, and all the lights are either working or they were told that the lights were working.\n\nMy boss is away today and is unable to be contacted on his mobile.  I tried calling him anyway, but couldn't get him.  So I apologised to the electrician for wasting his time and let him go to his next job.\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, I got a call from the admin clerk who was in a state of amazement.\n\nApparently when she was walking around with the electrician, she interrupted the branch manager to ask if he knew where the broken light was.  The branch manager was in his office doing who knows what on his computer. With his single office light turned off.\n\nThe branch manager told the clerk and the electrician that it wasn't his light that was faulty, he just had it turned off.  So they kept going, looking around at all the lights.  Not a single light was out, so the electrician left.\n\nTwenty minutes later, the branch manager came out of his office.  He tells the admin clerk that he just realised it was his light that was out, and if she could organise for the electrician to come back and replace it.\n\nI had the pleasure of telling this dopey bastard that since the job had to be rebooked, the wait time for the electrician to come back out is about two weeks as he is leaving to travel to another state tonight.",

I called and suggested that the patch would take just a few minutes to install. They told me to take a hike, they weren't upgrading and wouldn't give us any more money. I explained that I didn't want any money the upgrade was free and I'd gladly walk them through the upgrade for no charge. They said they weren't interested in upgrading and hung up on me.\n\nAbout a week later I called again and they quickly told me to \"Stop calling\" and hung up.\n\nAnother week goes by and I send an email.

We provided support for parks and recreation, recycling, animal control, golf courses, fire departments, planning and zoning, traffic, civil engineering, public works, etc, etc, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always dreaded seeing tickets from golf courses or fire stations... here's why:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne one fine Monday, around 3:30pm, I get a notification that I have a high priority ticket. We typically need to respond to a high priority in the same business day. I'm onsite at a location taking care of an issue. We don't generally drop the ticket we are working on to see about a high priority ticket. I finish up at the location around 4pm and head back to my office. My notifications to my phone only tell me that I have a high priority ticket and the subject of that ticket and the end user. The subject is \"POS system is down\", and I don't recognize the user. When I get to my cubicle, I sign into the ticket system and see that the problem is at one of the golf courses. The one furthest away from me. I grab my stuff and head over there. When I get there, the gates are closed and locked. \\*grumble\\* I guess I'm too late... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTuesday, after getting out of our \\*DAILY\\* hour long helpdesk meeting with our supervisor and the CIO, I immediately call the golf course. Nobody answers when I called, so I figured everyone was busy and headed over there. To find the gates closed and locked. I come back to city hall grumbling about the long drive and one of my fellow techs says \"Oh yeah, that golf course is closed on Tuesdays. You didn't call before you headed over there?' \\*GRUMBLE\\* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWednesday, during our daily tech meeting, I'm questioned about having a high priority ticket sitting in my queue for 3 days. \\*sigh\\* I explain the situation and am advised to close the ticket as soon as possible. As soon as I get out of the meeting, I call the golf course and speak to the manager. I get my gear, check out a vehicle, and drive 20ish minutes to the golf course. When I get there, the gates are locked and nobody is there. I come back to city hall positively fuming. My fellow tech looks at me and asks me if it's raining. I answer in the affirmative and he tells me that the golf course shuts down at the merest hint of rain... in a rain soaked state. \\*\\*GRUMBLE\\*\\* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThursday morning, again I get grief for having an unresolved high priority ticket in my queue. After the meeting, I call the golf course and look at the sky to make sure it's not raining before I check out a vehicle. I head over there with my gear to find that the POS system is working perfectly fine! \\*GAH!!!!!\\* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFriday morning, I get yelled at for making \\*FOUR\\* completely fruitless trips to the golf course. \\*sigh\\* \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe following stories should be pretty short. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFD10\n\n\\--\n\nSo, I get a call that fire station 10 is having trouble with their printer. I call the station to verify that someone is there and actually awake, pack up my gear, and head over. When I get there, the place is deserted. \\*sigh\\*  I come back later that afternoon and take care of their issue. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFD6\n\n\\--\n\nI get a call that Firestation 6 needs to have a new pc deployed. I call the firestation to make sure that someone will be there and awake. I grab the pc and my tools, check out a vehicle and head over there. I pull up into the rear entrance just in time to see the firetrucks rolling out of the front entrance. \\*sigh\\* I head back to the office and manage to deploy their PC the next day. \n\n\\--\n\nFD8\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirestation 8 reports that the laptop in one of their firetrucks is having some issues. I call and make sure someone will be there and is awake, grab my gear, and head over there. One of the firefighters walks me through the problems they are having, but says that the problems only happen when they are on a call. I ask him if he can get with dispatch to generate a simulated call for testing. He heads into the building and I see a call come across... then hear alarm bells and see people running. I try to assure them that it's a simulated call and not real when the firefighter I was working with runs up breathlessly and informs me that it's a real call, they need to go, and I need to get the hell out of the truck. \n\n\\--\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had nothing against the users... they were doing their jobs... but it did make life interesting from time to time.

If it isn’t, they’re limited to local accounts on the machine, because there’s no way to validate the account and password without a network. Similarly you can log into wifi if you’re on a computer and provide your ID and password for the wifi connection. Once you’re logged into the computer the wifi credentials are stored in the account. But you need to actually be logged in to set up wifi - can’t do wifi without being logged in.\n\nUnfortunately a department decided that it would be a good idea to move a lab to a new building that was being renovated before ethernet and power were fully set up. But no problem - there’s wifi, so we’ll just slap some wifi dongles on the machines, and problem solved, right? As for power, lots of extension cords, plugged into extension cords. Plugged into extension cords. Fire marshal’s going to love this.\n\nI set up machines, rig power, and hook up everything. I attach the dongles, install drivers and the machines are ready to connect to wifi. But of course this won’t work - there’s not going to be a wifi connection until somebody’s logged into the machine, and they can’t log into the machine without a network connection. I email the powers that be, explaining that the solution they’ve invented isn’t going to do anything. Email is ignored. They thank our group for setting up the new lab, and things sit for a week. Then comes today.\n\nPanic! They can’t log into the machines. Management doesn’t get it. I suspect that tomorrow I’m going to have to sit down with them at a computer, and step them through the process. I imagine it will go something like this:\n\nMe: Go ahead and log into this machine.\n\nMgt: I can’t, it’s rejecting my ID.\n\nMe: Yes, that’s because it’s not on the network.\n\nMgt: But it has wifi.\n\nMe: It has a wifi hardware, but no ID to connect to the network. Whose credentials is it using to connect to wifi? Follow up question - when and where do those credentials get entered?\n\nwait for penny to drop…...\n\nHopefully reality will penetrate. Which leads to the work-arounds.\n\nWe can either set up a single local account for everyone in the office to use on every machine, or we can set up an individual account on each machine for each person that needs to be in there. And of course we need the people who will be logging in to actually be there to set up the account, or else they’re getting a password that we generate for them. I’m expecting both solutions to be rejected as too difficult or unacceptable because of workflow issues. I’ve got a third alternative in mind that requires a 25 m ethernet cable that’s run from the boss’ wired office to the work area when needed to allow initial logins. I can see that lasting for three or four people before the bosses decide that this is too disruptive. Times like this I wish we were paid by the hour, because I anticipate a lot of callouts to set up local accounts on these machines.\n\ntldr; You can't login to a network account until the computer is on the network.",

Told Mr Customer it would not be ready until Tuesday at the earliest as Monday was a Holiday. \n\nMr Customer wanted his PC to have Windows Reinstalled. I asked about any data needing to be saved in which he clearly said no. He tried to save Windows with Recovery Discs and those failed. So he was sure the data was gone anyway.\n\nI obliged, reinstalled Windows, Updated, etc. Mr Customer picks up the PC and goes home.\n\n2-Hours later we get a call with some quite incoherent problems about logins, and passwords. Also scrolling (mouse wheel?) may not work. Mostly a list of things about how to USE a computer and not about the current state of functionality.\n\nIn the end, I mentioned if he is having difficulty working his PC and how to use it then I will have to send my Tech out to help him\n\n\"Is this going t cost me more money?\" asked the upset customer.\n\nAt which point I placed him on hold and passed him onto my Tech who would be the one to go out and appease said Customer.\n\nIn the end, the most basic point my Tech had to make so the customer to understand was:\n\n\"We did exactly as you asked and instructed us to do. We reinstalled Windows and its functional. You specifically told us not to save any data. Also, data backup does not saved any login credentials or installed programs. If you need help accessing your accounts and setting up things like your printer, that will require a service call to your home. We can discount our normal rate to X for you. But this is a separate request and as such follows different policies.\"\n\n\nEven though our sign in sheets says this in simpler terms, people never read and assume the PC will magically be identical to what it was before they screwed it up.\n",

        "text": "In this tale, I had been working with $offshore\\_company for a few years and I was going to be doing my first small boat job ( 24' boat ). This was my first time setting up a survey boat from scratch. We ordered two brand new Unix workstations for this boat and I spent several hours getting them configured. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce I had the two workstations configured, I duplicated the boot drive to the secondary drive. This was our standard procedure, so that we had a spare boot drive if necessary. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got with a surveyor and we got all the offset measurements. We also installed the GPS's, antennae, gyro, motion sensor, multibeam sonar, singlebeam sonar, etc. etc. installed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI ran the workstations on the bench for 24 hours, then installed them on the boat.  As the processing machine, it was also the fileserver and backup server. It had an external SCSI hard drive tower and an external Sony AIT tape drive. When I installed the processing machine, it ran for a few minutes then crashed. This is very unusual, those machines are very stable. After crashing, the machine would not boot. Figuring this was a fluke of some sort, I swapped the spare drive in and booted up. Again, it ran for a few minutes and crashed, then was unable to boot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI pulled the machine off the boat, reinstalled it, backed up the drive again. It ran for hours on the test bench with no problems. Within minutes of installing it on the boat, it had crashed and was unable to boot. I asked the other techs, but nobody has seen anything like this. I asked the programmers, and again, nobody had seen anything like this. The electronics techs suggested that it was possibly a power issue on the boat.... but we were running on shore power... We went ahead and ran an extension cord to the boat anyway... and it crashed again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI called the vendor that made the workstation and even they were scratching their heads. They suggested that it was possibly a bad scsi card. The technician came out and swapped the motherboard and I put in the spare drive as a boot drive. It ran fine on the test bench. Rather than reinstall it on the boat, I went ahead and pulled the data tower and tape drive off the boat and installed them on the bench. When I booted the machine, it crashed and wiped out drive 0... again... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay! We have progress. Something to do with the external drives is screwing things up. I ran those two external enclosures on another machine with no problems. The technician had gotten there at 4pm with the spare motherboard. At 10pm, the tech bowed out and went home. It was around midnight when I determined that the problem was not with the workstation itself. Sometime around 2am, I managed to trace it down to a bad SCSI cable. Spurious data on the scsi cable was causing sector 0 on device 0 on scsi chain 0 to get corrupted. This happened to be the boot sector for the machine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI replaced the scsi cable and was able to get everything running on the boat. Unfortunately, I got it all done around 4 hours after we were supposed to leave to start the job. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe owner of the company was FURIOUS and had all techs spent time the next day in the electronics lab chopping cheap SCSI cables in half. He also mandated that from now on we ONLY bought branded, trusted, scsi cables. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe started that job a day late... and finished a day early. The entire job took us less than a day. We started at 6am and had processed data backed up to tape by 10pm. ",

        "text": "I work as the 1st line of IT support for a manufacturing company in the UK. (There is external support if I cannot fix something). I  am the only on-site IT guy for three sites, so as you can tell, life is hell at times.\n\nAnyway, this particular tale happened about 1 year ago, when I was going into my second year as a techie. There were plans to decentralise our servers, a project that was being handled by our external it support and my **$Boss** the head of finance. This would eradicate our need for an extremely out of date Citrix environment. I was too inexperienced at this point to handle the project. So an External IT Engineer **($EIT)** was needed. Here's how the day panned out.\n\n\\- **8:30 am (Friday)** : Arrive at work (expected 5pm finish).\n\n\\- **9:00 am** : Phone call from **$Boss.** \"Server decentralisation is happening today, you may have to work a little later, ***couple of hours tops***\"\n\n*Thanks for the zero notice. No plans tonight so not a problem luckily.*\n\n\\- **9:30 am** : Warn users to turn off pc's before leaving today.\n\n\\- **12:30 pm** : Users leave. (They work a half day on Fridays, lucky gits.)\n\n\\- **1:00 pm** : Transport all relevant servers to correct site, and put them in place in the server room\n\n\\- **2:00 pm** : Check all PC's are powered down of course only about 50% of the users listened to my warning. **$EIT** engineer is expected to arrive at 2:30pm.\n\n\\- **3:30 pm** : **$EIT** arrives, 1 whole hour late. \n\n*It's definitely not going to be a couple of hours tops.*\n\n\\- **3:45 pm** : **$EIT** begins shutting down all servers that were already in use and says he wants to spin them up all together, as I help where I can. I think he wanted to migrate some VMs to another server. Get to know **$EIT** a bit, he's actually a good guy, and a superhero when it comes to IT. It was clear I was just here to lend a helping, yet limited, hand.\n\n\\- **5:00 pm** : Phone call from **$Boss :**\n\n**$Boss -**  \"I'm leaving for the day, I trust you and **$EIT** are nearing the finish?\"  \n\n**$Me -** \"Not even close, hopefully in the next couple of hours though.\"\n\n**$Boss -** \"Well as long as it gets done, that's all that matters\" *Click.*\n\n*Yeah don't mind me and* ***$EIT***\n\n\\- **7:00 pm** : **$EIT** and I begin spinning up the servers, reconfiguring them.\n\n\\- **9:00 pm** : Last server being spun up, I can almost taste the freedom.\n\n*I spoke too soon.*\n\n\\- **9:30 pm** : Server does not spin up correctly, doesn't allow user log-on, and will not communicate with the rest of the network. **$EIT** tells me to go and make a drink for us both, he'll try something and spin it up again.\n\n\\- **10:00 pm** : The server spins up, we carry out some test to make sure everything is working, finally done, we can go home. **$EIT** is an absolute hero.\n\n*I spoke too soon. Again.*\n\nThe front door is locked. We're still trapped in this hell-hole. Have to call building maintenance to come and let us out. We're both so tired and near raging at this point. \n\n\\- **10:30 pm** : **$EIT** and I are finally let out. Completely exhausted. We shake hands and part ways to go home and get some well-needed sleep, I have never seen him since. \n\nFortunately, when I arrived into work the following Monday everything worked fine, and was greeted by my boss telling me I can take the time back that I worked extra (basically a full day) and that I could have an extra days holiday that year. Every cloud....\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": "Feeling a little miffed this morning I thought I'd share a funny story from my old Dev Job. In my last post in TFTS I got a little bit of flack for assuming people know certain acronyms so I'll try to keep it simple.\n\nI was working 2nd line support for a client with a very large data portfolio. Their SQL Server Database was around 110gb and our infrastructure was piss poor - trying to move a file like that across drives was impossible because we didn't have the disk space on our dev PC's, and the operation would hold up network traffic. When we wanted to move large files we had to request that our infrastructure move it, which they would do out of hours with a robocopy script; but i digress.\n\nClient wanted a data cleanse operation against their dataset, not a very complicated job, just some basic rules like if Field1 = A and Field2 = B then Field3 = C else D. That kind of crap. The script was straightforward but it needed testing. I didn't want to test against production with transaction blocks because the sheer volume of updates would lock the database tables and start causing timeouts. So I had to use the test environment.\n\nThe test environment was a mess, hosted on a VM in our comms room with very limited space (barely enough to hold a trimmed and  anonymized  version of the production DB). I tried executing my script, only to find that the script failed when the transaction log filled up the hard disk. I shrank the transaction log and cleaned up some old files and tried again, once again the transaction log grew too large for the server.\n\nI tried a few techniques but whichever way you cut it, the update was too large to be contained on the test environment, because the logging enabled would just fill up the hard disk.\n\nTrying to think of a solution I wondered if it was possible to turn off transaction logging, this was a test database and we probably didn't need it anyway. My Google-Fu proved fruitless and what I found either didn't work, or told me it wasn't possible.\n\nApproaching the deadline and still needing to test my update script I asked one of the lead devs in our office; who we will call $LD. $LD had a good knowledge of SQL Server, had talked in the past about very complex theory and inner workings beyond just knowing SQL. So I felt pretty comfortable asking him.\n\nAt first he went through a lot of the same steps I did, tried to optimise my query but agreed that other than chunking it out into parts there wan't much we could do - and even if we did that wouldn't let us test it because of the storage space. He went through the tables trying to clear off unnecessary data, which I'd already done, and then started trying to shrink the files.\n\nWhen shrinking seemed to free up next to no space he did the unthinkable. Right Clicked on the database, selected delete and said yes to the dialog. Dropping the database.\n\nWe sat in silence for a moment.\n\n**$OP:** Did you mean to do that?\n\n**$LD:** I did not.\n\n**$OP:** Do you want to see if we can restore that?\n\n**$LD:** Yes I think that's a good idea.\n\nExcept of course - there were no backups. The disk space was so low that the backup job was never ran (there was nowhere to put it) and the transaction logs had been wiped, released and shrank so much they were no help at all.\n\n$LD then stood up, said he would need to request infrastructure to create another test instance, but my script looked fine and I was okay to run it. Also to not mention that he just destroyed a test environment, then went back to his desk.\n\nBeing a busy man it took him a few weeks to request the restore from production, which infrastructure then refused to do as the live backup was now too large to use. Rebuilding the schema was an option but we had no test data to insert and use, and everybody at our office was too busy to bother doing it. When I left in July almost 6 months after that day, there was no test environment for that client.\n\nTL;DR: Asked a lead dev for some help with SQL Server, he dropped the database.",

        "text": "About 25 years ago, I worked for a software development company.  They had two lines of business, and a few hundred developers on each.  I worked in a central sysadmin group, responsible for all Unix servers and desktops.  \n\nEach of those developers had a proprietary Unix based Cad workstation on their desk - mostly Silicon Graphics, but a substantial number of HP, Sun, and IBM as well.   And man, those devs loved their workstations. \n\nOne reason each dev had such a powerful machine was that we recompiled and retested all products every night.  Hipster us, we did cloud before it was cool.  \n\nOne developer, a legend in his own mind, became very possessive about “his” workstation. He must have had a little time on his hands, because he rigged up a script that notified him if anyone else was logged in.  We kept the workstations at varying OS levels and graphics configurations, so it wasn’t uncommon for a dev tracking down a bug to remotely access another machine.  \n\nIf you logged onto the box, he’d **talk** at you, demanding to know who you were, and why you were “interfering with his development cycle”.   Usually we’d message back a short explanation, su to root, and block him.  No big deal, we’re on the box once or twice a month.  We never heard what his fellow devs thought of him.  \n\nAfter a few months of this, he upped the ante.  We did desktop and server patching weekend nights so we didn’t interfere with the nightly build. We noticed when we touched “his” box, we got an automated, snarky email.  \n\nThe email demanded to know why we were logging in, and threatening to report it to our manager, because he was soooo important and he was working on suuuch a critical new feature, and resources on the machine were tight.  (Not, by the way - most of these machines cost more than a nice car. But he was running *emacs*, so maybe so...). Again, no big deal. Ignoring him was just what *procmail* was for. \n\nThen one Monday he must have had a bad weekend.  I know I did, because I put in eight hours Sunday night, patching went bad on a couple of servers, and I had to come in early Monday to figure out why. \n\nThat was the day he picked to go ballistic.   I got a profanity laced tirade about using “his” workstation and more threats to tell ~~Mommy~~ my manager.  \n\nI snapped.  I sent back an email, cc’ed to his boss and mine, telling him I did not have time for his nonsense.  \n\nHe doubled down.  I got an even more harsh reply talking about how important his new feature was, and how “his” workstation was off limits. He didn’t seem to notice that he hit reply all. \n\nApparently I did have time for his nonsense.  **My** reply said I did not realize it was his personally owned workstation.  I said our corporate security standard absolutely forbid personal equipment on our network, and that I was going to access it remotely in 15 minutes, remove it from the network, and that it had to be out of the building by close of business.  \n\nMy manager was a rough and tumble second generation Italian-American who looked like an extra from The Sopranos.   He read my reply, and wandered over laughing.  He asked if I wanted him to go bust heads, and told me to carry out the threat.  \n\nBefore I could, the developer, his manager, and the product VP three levels above him showed up in our area.  The dev meekly apologized for his unprofessional tone, said he realized the workstation was a shared company asset, and that we would not have any problems accessing it. \n\nTl; dr - Developer tells me to stay off **his computer**.  I tell developer to get his computer off my network.  \n\nBonus:   My manager constantly fought with devs who insisted they needed root access. When he finally lost that battle, he put up a “You break it, You own it” sign.  If a dev using root screwed up a server or workstation, he’d give them the install cds (4 or 5, IIRC), and two 4 inch binders of instructions.  ",

        "text": "So I work for a certain fruit company as an over the phone tech support agent. \ntl:dr at the end. This story as a lot of, \"and then it got worse\" in it so I'll try to keep it short while maintaining full impact (frustration). \n\nThere's only 2 characters in this play so I'll keep the code names simple with just \"I\" and \"customer\". \n\n\nThe customer calls in and says that they need help with uninstalling their iCloud subscription. Oddly worded but no big deal. I work in the desktop/laptop support line, so I support both the hardware and the software that the company sells so they got to the right person. \n\n\nI get their info and look up their subscription status... They have none?\n\n\n\"Ma'am are you sure this is the right account?\"\n\n\n\"I don't know\". Of course she doesn’t, they never do. \n\n\nI probe some more and determine that this is in fact the right account. So clearly what she's looking to do isn't related to paying us money each month. Maybe they're looking to remove our software, which includes a free tier (5GB) \"subscription\". Now Macs you don't have to install iCloud support, but on Windows you do. \n\"Are you looking maybe to remove iCloud for Windows?\"\n\n\"Uhh… yes\". Not a very confident reply. I want to be 100% sure so I ask if they're okay with screen sharing. They agree and I begin to give them the website we use to start screen sharing. \n\n\n\"Does my computer need to be on to remove iCloud?\"...…\n….\nMy god. \n….\n\n\nI can't keep from sighing into my mic, but I manage to recompose myself so I can politely explain that we aren't going to use magnets to manipulate the bits in their hard drive (I think I was a touch less sarcastic, but the sigh was powerful enough to deprive myself of oxygen so my memory might be a bit fuzzy). \n\n\nFaith in humanity gone, but the computer is powered on and we have their web browser open. \n\n\"Okay so you're going to go to www.website.com\"\n\n\"Okay one sec, let me write that down\"\n\nWrite? This is this first, \"And then it got worse\". \n\nI clarify that they do in fact mean write with a pen and paper and ask why not just type it in directly? Turns out this customer is using a wired house phone and their computer is on the other side of the room. \n\nGreat, now we have to throw a 1 person game of telephone into the mix. \n\n\nAfter about 10 minutes of trying to figure out how to type in a website and press Enter I ask, \"Ma'am I think it would be easier if we wait untill you're able to get hold of a cell phone. Does someone in your household have one and can I schedule a call back for when they get home?\"\nQueue it gets worse number 2. \n\n\"Oh I have my cellphone right here!\"\n\n….\n\nTo be completely fair, expecting someone like this to bring up the fact that they have a solution to our \"telephone game\" issue, is expecting way to much. I should have asked sooner. \n\n\nHang up, call right back on the cellphone, get the screen share software downloaded. Now we're golden. Right? Number 3. \n\n\nThis person does not have iCloud for Windows installed. They can't have iCloud for WINDOWS installed. They have a Mac. \n\nGreat now we're back to square 1 and I have no clue what they want. \n\n\n\"Can you show me this 'subscription' you're referring to?\"\n\n\nThey show me a Terms and Conditions window in their computer settings application. The \"subscription\" they wanted to “uninstall” was simply them not wanting to agree to the TnC required after they sign into iCloud. \n\"Just click decline and sign out\"\n\n\n\n\nWhy do work here. \nOh right I need to eat. \n\n\ntl:dr \nCustomer wanted to \"uninstall\" their \"iCloud subscription\", when really they just didn't want to agree to the terms and conditions of the service.\n\n",

The battery died during the last update, because I forgot to turn the power strip on and now it won’t boot anymore.\"\n\n&gt;$me: \"Sure thing, I'll take a look after work. Can't be that hard.”\n\nFeel free to laugh at my naïveté\n\n\nCome evening, I take a look at the tablet. It's a small $hell with a micro SD-card slot and a micro-USB port. I power it on and it goes straight to the bios. My sister mentions that when she first got into the bios after the crash, the SD-card she had in it didn't show up in the boot order. I shrug it off as a driver issue - stuff like that happens. As I wipe off some dust off the screen, I notice that the touchscreen works in the bios. *Neat*.\n\nI turn the tablet off and go on my computer to set up a thumb drive with the Windows media creation tool (this thing has made my life a lot easier quite a few times already)\n\nWhen everything is ready, I plug the thumb drive in via an adapter, power the tablet on and it immediately starts the installation process. *Success*.\n\nBut when I need to click some buttons to actually start the installation, the touchscreen doesn't work. *Great, I need a USB hub*. The only one in the house is the one my mother has her mouse and keyboard plugged into. So that's it until mom goes to bed, because I'm not crawling behind her Computer to plug them into the brick itself.\n\nAfter that has happened, I quickly send the installation on its way. Before I go to bed, I check on the tablet. It's off; battery died again. I plug the charger in and it boots no problem and greets me with the first time setup. I celebrate internally, force the tablet off and leave it to charge overnight. \n\nCome next morning, I hand it to my sister so she can set it up.\n\nTouchscreen is still dead, so that happens with my spare mouse and on-screen keyboard. Volume rocker and Windows button don't work either. \n\nOnto the $hell website to get drivers. Luckily the website can auto-detect your device, since we have no idea what the tablet's exact model is. \n\nI let the website do its thing and no surprise: It says drivers are missing. Chipset and something else.   The automatic installer fails both drivers. Reboot and another try… failed again. I download the separate installers. These also fail. *That's a first* \n\nI grab the most current bios update, which installs without an issue and reboot the tablet again. The other two installers fail again. I decide to let Windows update do its thing for now and check out the device manager. At this point my mom and sister leave to get the groceries for the next week. There are no unknown devices and a lot of things are missing. Sound card and power adapter, for example. I start to realize how lucky I am that the wifi is working.\n\nAbout half an hour and several reboots later, all Windows updates are installed and finally the installation of the chipset driver succeeds. Another reboot and everything is working.\n\nI call my sister to tell her and shut the tablet down with a satisfied sigh.\n\nThis was far from the first time missing chipset drivers were keeping things from working, but it was the first time I’ve had a chipset driver installation fail.\n\nHere’s to hoping my grandma doesn’t accidentally factory reset her tablet again...",

        "text": "One of the first ships that I worked on with an actual internet connection was in 2006 in Mexico. We had the system installed by the vendor to make sure that everything was as perfect as possible. The system used a 3.3m satellite dish with some pretty serious motors for tracking. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was given a quick run through of the menus on the system and away we went. Things were great for the first few weeks, but we started noticing little oddities... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen the weather was absolutely flat calm, the system had a little trouble staying locked in. When there were light seas, the system had more trouble staying locked in. When we were in rough seas, the system seemed to work pretty well. All of this is pretty much exactly the opposite of what you would normally expect. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made a few calls to the vendor and/or their NOC and we all scratch our heads collectively. They have me change satellites, pointing angles, etc, but nothing seems to help. One day, we completely lose our internet connect in very calm seas and it just won't come back. We head to the dock and have a vendor rep meet us there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm asked to stay in our computer lab ( where the satellite receiver is ) and try various things. The vendor rep, luckily has a radio... A couple of minutes into trying to get a lock on a new satellite, the rep calls down and frantically yells for me to shut the system down. I flipped the breaker supplying power to the dish and wait for an explanation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe 3.3m dish was quite heavy and needed some serious motors to move it around. Because our ship expected to go through occasional rough weather, the rate at which those motors moved the dish around was fairly quick. It would then stop abruptly, causing the deck under the mount to flex slightly. The deck was flexing just enough to throw the positioning off, then the system would rapidly throw the dish back in the opposite direction and stop abruptly. While we were moving, it wasn't too bad, but tied up to the dock... well... the dish pointing motors rapidly found the resonant frequency of the deck and all hell broke loose. They wound up making several changes. First, the antenna mount was completely removed and a steel plate was added to the deck to offer some rigidity. The antenna was remounted and the dish pointing motors were limited in both speed and \"jitter\". After these corrections were made, everything was perfect in calm weather, but in really rough weather the dish had trouble keeping up. ",

        "text": "I hope this fits, although it's from the perspective of the user. Reading about Sony finally discontinuing their PS2 repair service reminded me of one of my favorite stories my dad tells, about Sony's \"repair service\". Also on mobile so forgive any formatting or spelling errors.\n\n\nBack in the 1980s, my dad played basketball for the New Zealand National Team, and travelled all over the world for games and tournaments. On this occasion, he was in Tokyo for a big tournament. While he was there, his fancy new Sony Walkman (the original) stopped working. He set out to find an electronics store, which, being in Japan, couldn't be that hard to find. The only complicating factor is that he didn't speak a word of Japanese. \n\n\nHe first went to the concierge at his hotel, who luckily spoke a few words of English. He explained his problem and the concierge seemed to understand, responding by writing an address on a card: \"go here\". My dad took the card and showed it to a taxi driver, who drove him through the streets of Tokyo before pulling over at his destination. \n\n\nHe paid his fare and then looked around to find the electronics store... Only there wasn't one. There were plenty of opportunities for miscommunication and he nearly resigned to going back to the hotel. Then he looked up... And up, and up, to a big sign on top of the building in front of him: \"SONY\".\n\n\nHe had been sent, surely with all the best intentions, to Sony Headquarters. He laughed, but was fairly that they would not have a repair centre inside. However he decided, in a last gasp effort to save his Walkman, that the reception inside might speak more English and might be able to direct him  somewhere more useful. He walked in and explained his problem, thinking he might get another card with another address. Instead they asked him to wait and made a phone call in Japanese, which lasted a minute of two. Feeling a bit embarrassed, he started preparing to leave, but suddenly receptionist got up and walked him to an elevator, pressed the number for a very high floor, and then left the elevator before the doors could close.\n\n\nSo here is my dad, very confused at this point, alone in an elevator rocketing up to the highest floors of Sony HQ. The doors open to an empty hallway with several unmarked doors. Again, he waits a minute of two, and right before he can abort and go back down, a door opens and three small (they were probably normal sized, but everyone is small to my 6'9 dad), Japanese men wearing lab coats, pop out from a door and come over to him. They take the Walkman from his hand and start examining and discussing it, then disappear with it back through the door, closing it behind them.\n\n\nIt suddenly dawns on him, and, if it hadn't already, you: this isn't any sort of repair centre. This is the bleeding edge. This is Sony R&amp;D, on the highest floors of one of the tallest buildings in Tokyo, Sony HQ. These guys don't just fix electronics, they design them! And they're fixing my dad's Walkman. \n\n\nNow, we Kiwis are a very understated people (except when in comes to rugby) and the fact that he ended up here, wasting the time of some of the smartest people in the world so that he can listen to his new AC/DC album, is both bewildering and incredibly embarrassing. But at this point it would be even more rude to leave, so he sits and waits while his walkman is fixed by the guys who probably invented it.\n\n\nEventually they come out, waving his walkman and excitedly showing that it now works. He pulls out his wallet, but through the language barrier, they make it very clear that they will accept no money. So he thanks then profusely, goes on his way with a story he, and I, and maybe now you, will never forget.",

I ask if people are dialing her directly or not, and she gives me the number they are dialing, which brings them to a robot that one of the options dials her. So I call it to make sure that I does go to her and not straight to voicemail or something. After all of this, I verify she is getting the calls. Everything looks to be working as intended.\n\nVolume on the ringer is up, everything looks good. When I asked her if it was down, she says no, but she may have been on a call for them.\n\nSeems odd because this is a 3 hour window, but I go through her calls out to see if maybe she was on a lot of calls.\n\nWell, she had a call out at 630 AM that day, and then the next one back was 1130AM the previous day.\n\nSo I'm ready to just chalk it up to a fluke event that will never be solved and will never occur again, so lost in the ticket ether forever.\n\nAs I'm looking at the 1130AM call, she says, that was to my parents. And thats what jogs her memory.\n\n$user : $chode, don't kill me. Left at noon yesterday to pick my parents up from the airport...\n\n$user : well $user, that would certainly explain why you didn't get those calls....\n\n\nHonestly I was just happy I would have a ticket in my queue that would likely never be solved, which in this case couldn't be solved if we never found out she left.\n\n\nTicket resolution : $User was in fact, not at her desk during the missed calls.",

        "text": "Another tale from my days working for $GiantSupermarketChain on their helpdesk.\n\nYour cast of characters (inspiration from Pratchett, this time):\n\n**$Miscreancy**: A dashing ne'er-do-well, now fairly experienced at working in tech support for this company\n\n**$TheBeanstalk:** One of my team's seniors (I was a junior) - really knowledgeable guy, and also ridiculously tall and skinny.\n\n**$Vetinari**: An InfoSec analyst. Ruthless character. Deftly manipulated and/or threatened people into doing things his way. I rather liked him.\n\n**$MrTeatime**: This story's 'customer'. An ~~interesting~~ ~~annoying~~ ~~slightly scary~~ character who seemed to delight in coming up with new and interesting ways to break stuff, cause trouble and give our InfoSec guys heart attacks.\n\n​\n\nThe tale begins!\n\n*So this was while I was manning the help desk for $GiantSupermarketChain - we were first line support for all IT issues that didn't relate to POS. My team ($Office) handled office-based colleagues, as opposed to the $Stores team that handled - you guessed it - colleagues based in store (those were the worst kind of calls). We also had responsibility for handling all calls related to $GiantSupermarketChainBank, whose colleagues were convinced they were the most important people we would ever speak to in our day, regardless of grade. Sometimes, though, the worst calls you get are from people who work in Tech...*\n\n​\n\n\\[Phone rings\\]\n\n**$Miscreancy**: Good afternoon, you're through to $Miscreancy on the $Office team, how can I help?\n\n**$MrTeatime**: Hello, it's $Teatime here, from $Department. My laptop has been acting up, I was hoping you could take a look?\n\n**$Miscreancy**: \\[inwardly groaning - this is not my first tango with $Teatime\\] Sure. Do you have the machine name, or an IP address?\n\n**$MrTeatime**: \\[Rattles off an IP\\]\n\n​\n\nI ping the address and confirm that I'm getting a response from it - so far so good. Get into it using Remote Assistance - excellent. Now I'm in and I can already see that there are a few problems here in terms of what the machine looks like, but I'm going to assume as this is a machine belonging to someone in Tech, someone may have given them admin access. Still, this doesn't look like our standard 8.1 image, and... is that Steam installed in the corner there? If this is a dev laptop and not just a tech one, we won't support it at all. Curious.\n\nI check for a specific piece of software that all of our machines have installed... nope, it's not there.​​\n\n​\n\n**$Miscreancy**: Hi Teatime - so it looks like this machine is going to need to be rebuilt regardless of what the problem is, because it's drifted so far away from the base image I have concerns about you continuing to operate it. So I'll get an appointment for you for the swapout while it's being rebuilt. Could take a couple days though, so lets try to get it functional in the meantime. What's wrong with the machine?\n\n**$MrTeatime**: Core MS apps aren't launching. could be a problem with the registry? It's getting some funky errors.\n\n​\n\nI take a look through and he's right - try to launch any core Office app and it fails out. Again though it's weird because it's a version we haven't released yet. He tells me he got a beta version which I can understand except... he also doesn't have a licence key and I've just found a cracker file. This copy of Office is bootlegged. Oh no.\n\n​\n\n**$Miscreancy**: $Teatime, when you say this copy of Office is a beta copy, where did you get it from?\n\n**$Teatime**: I mean it's an official MS Beta from 4-5 years ago that got leaked. Ohhhh, did you think I meant internal beta?\n\n$**Miscreancy**: \\[desperately trying to hold temper\\] Yes. Because this is a company machine and you can't install bootleg software on it! You could get us in serious trouble!\n\n**$Teatime**: What are you talking about? This isn't a company machine!\n\n**$Miscreancy**: \\[pole-axed\\] ... eh?\n\n**$Teatime**: This is my machine. I just got $HardwareSupportTeam to get me bound to AD so I could use the network. I'm on a whitelist of something I don't know, didn't want to have to use a machine I couldn't properly control so I brought in this one and told them that it had been approved by $InfoSecTeam.\n\n**$Miscreancy**: And was it approved by them?\n\n**$Teatime**: I mean I have an email somewhere that explains it. \\[finds email, which authorises the use of a machine on our network for a single day for a specific purpose, and stipulates that the machine must be completely clean and contain no threat to our security\\]\n\n**$Miscreancy**: Did you not see the part about it being for one day, it needing to be clean and no threat?!\n\n**$Teatime**: I figured someone authorised an extension cause it never stopped working. Don't sound so worried, it could be worse, this could actually be a company machine.\n\n​\n\nOhhhhh no.\n\nOh no oh no oh no.\n\nSo what this means is a machine with 0 corporate oversight that has bootlegged software on it, being operated by a colleague who doesn't have any security knowledge or experience, has been roaming free on our network for... however long. I throw a quick query at $TheBeanstalk and he runs over to take a look.\n\n​\n\n**$TheBeanstalk**: ... eh?\n\n**$Miscreancy**: Yeah, this looks like combination idiocy. I can reverse the bind $HardwareSupportTeam did and I reckon we can get this fixed for now but... we need someone from $InfoSecTeam in on this. Who do you reckon?\n\n**$TheBeanstalk**: We don't really want to touch this with a barge pole but I guess we'll have to. Grab $Vetinari, he's usually good at making people regret bad decisions.\n\n​\n\nThat's pretty good advice. I give $Vetinari a quick call, but to be honest most of what he said were four letter words about $Teatime. He's going to speak to his boss, $HardwareSupportTeam's boss and $Teatime's boss, then shoot me an email asap. In the meantime I'm given the rather blunt instructions to 'get it the \\[%\\^£@\\] off our \\[%\\^£@\\*()\\] network before I go down there and \\[%\\^£@\\*()\\] smash it into a million \\[%\\^£@\\*()\\] pieces', which is refreshing.\n\n​\n\n**$Miscreancy**: Okay, so here's the deal $Teatime. We have to nuke your machine from orbit, which is my way of saying we're booting you off the network effective immediately. This will prevent you connecting via wired and wireless networks within our offices. Feel free to tether it to your phone or something if you need connectivity, we're just not going to communicate with the device.\n\n**$Teatime**: Well this is outrageous! Honestly, I call because I'm having issues with Office and you end up removing my perfectly functional machine from the network. You're overreacting! I want to speak to your manager!\n\n**$Miscreancy**: I have no doubt you'll be speaking to a number of managers very soon. Yours is currently on the phone with $InfoSecTeam, if I'm correct. And your machine is now off the network. I can't put you through to my manager, because he's currently on the phone to $HardwareSupportTeam.\n\n**$Teatime**: To try and get my machine rebuilt?\n\n**$Miscreancy**: No, to find out who added the machine for the network and didn't check the machine thoroughly or put a time limit on it. We won't be rebuilding your personal machine or issuing you a replacement. Or having it anywhere near our network again.\n\n**$Teatime**: I don't understand how I'm supposed to work in this environment without a working computer.\n\n**$Miscreancy**: I'm sure you'll figure something out; unfortunately these are my instructions and as it's a security issue I have to follow it to the letter. Your ticket number is ###### and someone from $InfoSecTeam should be in touch.\n\n\\[ENDCALL\\]\n\nNeedless to say, his worry about working in that environment was now a non-starter as after 5 days he didn't have a job with us anymore. I got an email from $Vetinari later that day to confirm that someone in all three teams ($HardwareSupportTeam, $InfoSecTeam and $Teatime's team) had messed up in different ways, which compounded our issue into the ridiculous scenario we were in. To make it worse, the machine had slowly been spreading some nasties to other devices, which prompted a nice wave of machine wipes and security update rollouts.\n\n​\n\nTl;dr? Guy gets his personal machine added to the network for a day, it never gets time-limited so he just keeps using it, installs bootleg software, calls IT for help, gets fired and causes company-wide security issues.\n\nEdit: some minor spelling\n\nAdditional edit: hey, thanks for the gold! Very proud, this is my first gilded post.",

        "text": "Obligatory “First Time Poster” start goes here. Hopefully my formatting is good! This is a bit long, but hopefully it’s worth the ride! (Due to length, I left out some of the standard troubleshooting steps to save time.)\n\nSetup: One of my previous positions was as in-house IT for a Fortune 100 company at the corporate headquarters. We had our own in-house call center and I was part of the hands-on support team. When the company first brought me on, my main work was doing PC builds/replacements (on a three-year cycle), none of which was automated. Users were used to a certain level of service, so not only did I have to run all updates, copy data (Oh did I miss Windows Easy Transfer when they upgraded to Win10), and other standard fare for a build, but we also made sure the taskbar was the same, printer defaults were set, etc. For certain VIPs, we even made sure the desktop icons were in the same order. Again, there was no automation in place so this was all done by hand, for a building containing around 900 people.\n\nBetween builds I would assist the other hands-on techs with the ticketing queue which was everything from “I need batteries for my mouse” to “set up file backup systems for the company and teach everyone how to use it”. Luckily the queue was left for us to pick items to our strengths or curiosities and we made sure to keep things pretty even. We had a ticket come in for a user in our Communications department that I got along with well with that I decided to pick up. The ticket was essentially “My computer keeps crashing”.\n\n\\---\n\nCast:\n\n**ME**: You know, the guy with the pants.\n\n**CU**: Communications department User\n\n\\---\n\n&gt;**ME**: Hey CU! I heard you were having some PC issues!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**CU**: Oh hi! Yeah, my computer is really slow! And when I try to save files, sometimes everything on the screen just disappears!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**ME**: Well that’s…different. Mind if I take a look?\n\nCU lets me hop onto her computer, which is a pretty solid machine designed to make sure all of the Adobe Suite is able to run with ease. After making sure all important work is saved I start closing windows, only to come across the DESKTOP FROM HELL. The user has three screens, all of which are COMPLETELY COVERED with icons. So much so, that the icons are stacked on top of each other THREE LAYERS DEEP.\n\n&gt;**ME**: Wow, so you keep just a few things on your desktop, huh?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**CU**: Haha, yeah I just save everything there, it’s an easy spot to remember.\n\nI spent a little time at this point talking about #NewBackupSolution we were using and how now would be a good time to clear out unnecessary files while she transfers everything to the backup system while I was attempting to recreate the issue. Sure enough, when I would try to navigate through Windows Explorer, it would crash and never recover, leading to a hard reboot of the machine.\n\n&gt;**ME**: Well, this is definitely a problem. Let me see what I can do for you here.\n\nAt this point I ran through a bunch of cleanup tools we used regularly, attempting to free up space, remove programs that hadn’t been used in a while, run any and all available updates, etc. It was a long ride on the struggle bus with Explorer crashing from time to time, and in the end things were no better off than when we started.\n\n&gt;**ME**: Well, unfortunately we are still looking at the same issue. You’re not due for an upgrade, but it looks like you don’t have an SSD and so I’d like to update you to one of those. This will also let me get you a fresh Windows installation which I think will take care of things for you, but it means I’ll need to take your machine and set you up with a loaner.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**CU**: I actually have a laptop for when I’m travelling, and I can totally work off of that until you’re ready.\n\nAwesome! I hike up my slacks and get the tower disconnected and haul it to the IT Room to start cleaning up. The old drive is removed, a new SSD is installed, the device is imaged, software is installed, and the user is logged in. No more crashing, awesome! But now it’s time to transfer that user data. All \\*checks profile size\\* 100+ GB of data that is only on the desktop. Woo!\n\nI start the backup to my external drive while I’m working on other things, keeping an eye on it to make sure there aren’t any failures. Luckily, everything goes through without a hitch! I plug the drive into the newly-upgraded tower and start the process of the data flowing back to its new home, which also ends up being uneventful. I log back in as the user…and Explorer crashes.\n\n&gt;**ME**: Oh, neat.\n\nI log in with the local admin account and clean out the profile. Logging in as CU again, I’m fine until I complete the data transfer, and then we are back to Explorer crashing. So, at least I have a cause: corrupt data. So now I needed to figure out exactly what it was that was corrupt and causing Explorer to lose its mind. Unfortunately for me, that was more of less “copy data a bit at a time and see if it causes a crash”. Joy.\n\nEventually, I got to the broken little bastard: a video file about half a GB in size. Everything was fine until I put that bugger onto the system. Once Explorer tried to read it, the whole system went haywire. I transferred everything else over and the machine was running like a champ. I emailed CU to let her know that the computer was ready and set up some time to get it reconnected.\n\nThe appointment comes and I get everything connected and verify that it works to her liking.\n\n&gt;**ME**: So, it turns out the whole problem was this one file that was corrupted. I’m hoping it wasn’t anything crucial that you don’t have a good copy backed up elsewhere. It was “FILENAME.AVI”...do you know what that was?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**CU**: That’s ok, I don’t need that anymore. I used it for a presentation once. Actually, I got that from the FBI!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**ME**: Wait…what?\n\nCU pulls up her web browser and navigates to a site with informational videos posted by the FBI. If I remember correctly, the video was actually about data privacy or something data related, which made the whole thing even more entertaining.\n\nAnd that’s the story of how the FBI destroyed my company’s computer.\n\nTL;DR - User's machine has file explorer crash whenever navigating user's files which are all saved to the desktop. Video file is the culprit. Turns out it was downloaded from an FBI info website and was somehow corrupted.\n\nEDIT: Added TL:DR by request!",

No documentation of any kind - it was all in her head, and obviously she'd be here forever, so why write anything down?\n\nIt uses the MS Access 2.0 runtime application to present users with a dashboard that opens various forms for data entry/retreival, all housed in an Access 2.0 .mdb.  The way it's coded, all automated attempts at conversion have failed miserably (something with DoCmd statements, if I remember correctly) and stretched as thin as we are, nobody's had the time to either manually update it so it will convert or just manually replicate the system in something modern.\n\n&gt;Permit number of the last successful one was 32767, which screams of a data type error, since that's the largest number that can be stored in an Integer data type (can only hold values from -32768 through 32767).  \n\n&gt;Was able to find a copy of the Access 2.0 installation media on http://vetusware.com. It actually installed properly on a 32-bit Windows 7 vm, running the installer program in Win95 compatibility mode, and seems to run properly when the actual program is also run in Win95 compatibility mode.  \n\n&gt;Found that the code behind the Permits form was defining the permit number as an Integer, and changed it to Long (long integer, accepts values from around negative two billion to positive two billion).  This should be OK, as the actual table that's storing the data has the field set as a Double (accepts values of positive or negative 1.79 times 10^308 which is around 200 orders of magnitude more than there are atoms in the universe...) and if we ever hit two billion permits, we have bigger problems.\n&gt;  \n&gt;Need to work with $user1 and/or $user2 to test if the modified version works properly.",

We have a client - a nonprofit - and their VP/Chief Operating Officer is our primary point of contact. She's older and rather easily startled, kind of like a soon-to-be-retiring Chihuahua. We'll call her $VP. Here's the remaining cast of characters:\n\n$me: random person. Just kidding, it's me. \n\n$Lowman: He's a peon. Low man on the totem pole. Best known for getting a browser hijack while trying to find animated cats for a donor presentation to a large foreign automotive manufacturer.\n\n$CFB: No, not college football. Crazy F\\*\\*\\*ing B\\*\\*\\*h. She's marketing director and meaner than a dehydrated rattlesnake in August. Best known for postponing a corporate-wide email migration because she didn't realize her multicolor coding label system in Outlook wouldn't transfer to the new Exchange service.\n\nNow that you have the cast of characters, here's the story:\n\nI was sitting at my desk doing whatever it is that I do and my phone rings. I can see by caller ID that it's $VP and I wait to see if the helpdesk would pick it up. I then remember that I was on helpdesk and rolled my eyes, put my headset on, and answered the phone. It was tough to hear, because $VP was whispering. Yes, whispering. \n\n$me: &lt;name of our company&gt; this is $me\n\n$VP: (whispering) I need your help, and I need it fast. \n\n$me: Oh, hi $VP. Can you speak up?\n\n$VP: (only 1dB louder) Is this better?\n\n$me: &lt;sigh&gt; Sure. What's up?\n\n$VP: $Lowman was on the server looking at some graphics files and corrupted them. I need you to restore from backup ASAP.\n\n$me: Uh, explain just a little bit better. How did he corrupt them just by looking at them?\n\n$VP: he was trying to look at some of the logo files in $CFB's share and they opened up in Notepad. Now they all have the Notepad icon beside them and we don't want $CFB knowing anyone was looking at those files.\n\n$me: I seriously doubt they are corrupted. Let me take a look. Can you transfer me to $Lowman?\n\n$VP: no, but I will walk to his desk with my cell phone.\n\n$me: *&lt;internally: yeah, whatever.&gt;* OK, I'll be logging on to his PC. \n\n$VP: Hey $Lowman, I have $me on the phone, he thinks he may be able to fix it.\n\n$me: OK, $Lowman, show me what you got.\n\n$Lowman: OK. *&lt;navigates to server share&gt;* Look! All these AI files have Notepad icons beside them. They used to just have blank white icons. $CFB is going to think I was messing with her files and she'll freak out. \n\n$me: Don't worry, you haven't damaged any files. Look, AI files are Adobe Illustrator files. You don't have Adobe Illustrator installed, so your computer asked you what program to use. You picked Notepad and since it doesn't have an alternative it'll remember you wanted to use Notepad. She can't see this on her machine.\n\n$Lowman: so they'll just look like blank white icons on her machine?\n\n$me: Not exactly, they'll have Adobe Illustrator icons because that's what she uses to access them. But they won't look any different to her. If it makes you feel better and she's at her desk, I can remote in and make 100% sure.\n\n$Lowman and $VP at once: NO!!!!! She's not in, anyway. She won't be back until next Wednesday.\n\n$me: *&lt;wondering WTF the emergency was&gt;* OK, no problem. But just know that she'll never know what you were doing, trust me. Anything else I can do for you?\n\n$Lowman: I do have a question if you have a minute.\n\n$me: Sure thing.\n\n$Lowman: The reason I was in her files was because I have to put together a brochure and I need to know what colors to use for our logo. How can I do that in Notepad?\n\n$me: *&lt;chuckling&gt;* You can't, really. You'll need her Adobe software. But I think I can help you out here. *&lt;Opens Google, types in $organizationname branding standards (they're a multi-national nonprofit.)&gt;* \n\n$Lowman: Really? You're Googling it? Way to make me feel dumb.\n\n$me: *&lt;internally: well, you know that your organization has very, very strict branding guidelines and you tried to open an AI file in Notepad, so.....&gt;* Nah, I just know that $organizationname has pretty strict guidelines, I know they'll have them published somewhere. *&lt;click first link, it's a PDF file with a table of contents that directs me to page 33-ish&gt;* OK, here are the colors. They give you Pantone, CMYK, RGB, and Hex. What program are you using to create your brochure? \n\n$Lowman: Publisher.\n\n$Me: OK, you'll need RGB or hex values. \n\n$Lowman: Thanks man, you really saved the day. \n\n$me: I didn't really do anything. Have a great afternoon!\n\ntl;dr: User opens Adobe Illustrator file in Notepad and thinks he's going to die at the hands of an insane marketing director. I talk him off the ledge and the day is saved.",

This is a Mitel DECT cordless unit to be used on a Mitel 5360 phone. The handset is discontinued. So anyways this handset was paired with another phone and since the receptionist phone is attached to our main callflow the Mitel director is stubbornly refusing a phone swap... So I figure I just swap the charging plates and pair the cordless handset with the receptionist phone.\n\nSwapping the plates was pretty easy but when I went to pair the handset it just wasn't happening. The proper manual said plainly press and hold the hang up key on the side of the handset for 5 seconds and the LED should blink blue. I try a bunch of times and switch buttons, no dice. Eventually I realize the the hang up key doesn't click like the volume keys. I hook up the corded handset again and go back to my desk to open this thing up. After a couple minutes I find the culprit. There were no key switches behind the rocker cover... You can see the solder points weren't broken. After a minute of WTFing, I Macguyvered a paper clip into position to lay on the 2 leads and sure enough after 5 seconds the LED started blinking Blue. I ran back to the front desk with just the bottom casing and chipset exposed and paired the handset. Reassembled the case and left it on the cradle to charge and be in use. I have no idea who sabotaged this handset(I can guess that maybe Mitel intended this one to only ever be used with the original phone). But I felt proud in bypassing their dumb broken by design concept with just a screw driver and paperclip.",

        "text": "After 9/11 our IT department is on absolute minimum spend. We didn't really have any .NET developers or any budget for contracting  such. I am at a local site helping users with Microsoft Access issues around effectively communicating with the iSeries via ODBC and just general database training. BI tools were rudimentary and expensive at this time.  (Before the flame wars begin note the zero budget, if all you have is a screwdriver or a hammer you will find a way to fix anything with it).\n\nI am touring the plant and one of the planners comes up to me. He is spending eight hours a day pulling prints out of our PLM (Product Lifecycle Mangement) design solution and also printing off Bills of Material (BOMs) from our PLM change solution and then sorting them in order to put onto the production line. I speak to him a little bit and he shows me the routine and the workflow. I tell him to let me try something and promise to get back to him.\n\nUsing MS Access, ODBC links to our ERP system, getting a little batch file from the guys using the PLM Design system to allow me to download prints I put together a solution that allows the user to enter some information about the next day's production and then get a package that puts everything in the right order. The hardest part turned out to be printing the drawings as they are PDF's and I have to do an asynchronous call to Acrobat Reader. I ended up putting a delay in the loop so they can slow the program down or speed it up if things are printing out of sequence. I created  a form for the user to set the delay. We spent about a week testing and refining and all is well.\n\nAbout a year later I get a call saying the drawings are all printing off on the wrong size paper, standard letter size not the larger folio size that is embedded in the PDF file. I should mention at this point I have a new 'manager' who came over from program management. He knows very little about technology. I speak to the users only to find out that the printer vendor has cycled in new printers based on our lease agreement. So I tell them since I have not changed anything in the code to work with the printer vendor.\n\nAbout a week goes by and things are getting testy. My new manager is now throwing me under the bus and the site is screaming because now they are back to spending eight hours downloading and printing drawings. We end up in the IT directors office. He asks for an explanation and my manager just throws me under the bus again. He also defends the printer leasing company. Fortunately for me the IT director is tech savvy. So when I get my turn I walk him through everything that has transpired and where the true root cause lies. At the end he says that is the best explanation he has heard and perfectly explains the situation.\n\nSo the Director calls the printer leasing company and we set up an on-site meeting. They are told to bring a technical representative as it is obvious the salesman doesn't know how to resolve this situation. So in this meeting we got through the whole process and how the tool I wrote works and how PDFs are printed. So they jump on the fact I am calling a BAT file and using that to call Adobe Reader to print. The tech guy says all I have to do is use this DOS command first and everything will be fine. He tells me the command and I Google it. Lets just say it is archaic and from what I am reading has no application to this issue. But we are hear to resolve the situation and I agree to test. And it fails.\n\nSo we prove to them it is in the printer. Now at this point I should say that these new printers have a web page interface. If you know the IP address and the right port number you can enter this in your browser and look at the printers settings and manage them. We used that before to troubleshoot printing problems. However now our printer supplier put a password form over this to prevent companies from getting to these settings. So we tell the tech person we believe the printer is not set to print to the closest paper size but to force everything to the default paper size. After some discussion they agree we are correct.\n\nNow for the really fun part. Not only are we locked out but so is the tech! His credentials do not have the power to make these changes. The IT Director told them at this point they had to stay here until it was fixed. As we left the building around 6 pm we could hear the tech arguing desperately with his support system begging for the credentials to fix this issue. The user told me they ended up having to get a tech from the big city about two hours away to drive up here and enter the credentials and resolve the issue.\n\nFor the record when we did our last ERP upgrade this process got ported to .NET and done correctly. Its nice to have a budget beyond zero...",

It's just a box and a network cable, no need for any peripherals as I manage it through RDP or Hyper-V console over the LAN.\n\nOne VM is SBS server and another running Server 2008 R2 for some applications.\n\nThey don't have a server room or really any area to keep IT stuff, so it sits under the far side of the reception desk with a UPS connected.\n\nStory:\n\nSo about a month ago, I get a phone call in the morning.. the server isn't on and the UPS is off as well. Thinking perhaps they had an overnight power outage, I ask them to reset the UPS and power on the server.\n\nAll is good for about an hour, then pop... UPS quits out and server goes out. Turns out the UPS was fried/glitchy. This time, it's a massive problem. Exchange was halfway through a write so it is screwed and the mail store won't mount. Client is losing their shit, just so happens today nearly everyone is out on site (petrol/gas stations with no phones and they need compliance, safety docs via email) \n\nFast forward 5 hours later, phone calls every half an hour for progress updates..(\"progress bar is moving, I can't make it rebuild any faster\").. I've finally rebuild the exchange server and we're receiving mail. yay.\n\nSo we're running, but no UPS now. I'm nervous, but I can't get out on-site and the client assures me they'll swing by the local computer shop and get a UPS as soon as possible.\n\n...\n\nA week later, I get a phone call from one of their guys asking me how to turn the server on.\n\nme: \"uh WTF?.. why is it off?\" \n\nguy: \"Oh we turned it off to connect the new UPS\"\n\nme: \"How did you turn it off? How did you cleanly shut it down without having admin access?\"\n\nguy: \"We just pulled out the power cord and plugged in the new UPS\"\n\nme: \\*\\*flashbacks to 5 hours of exchange rebuilding\\*\\* \"ARGGH.. don't ever touch the server without calling me. EVER. It's not like a regular computer.\"\n\nguy: \"oh shit sorry.. I didn't realise it was such a big deal, I just got told to hook up the new UPS\"\n\nme: \"fuuuck.. I spent 5 hours rebuilding the mail server the last time it was just shut off. ok, well.. nothing we can do about it, press the power button on top to boot it up and lets all hope for the best.\"\n\n...\n\n5 minutes later, I try the VPN and I get connected.. good start.. \n\nThen I RDP and check exchange immediately. It mounted. What a relief. ",

Basically, about once every 6 weeks, I'd carry the Helpdesk Blackberry for a week. It was fairly unusual to get after hours calls unless there was some sort of emergency. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had been working with the bank for a couple of years and I had a solid reputation as a problem fixer. I routinely had double the number of closed tickets each month as the next T1 tech, my customer satisfaction was high, my bosses were pleased with me... I handled a couple of minor emergencies with aplomb, things were going well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI take my turn in the rotation to carry the Blackberry, thinking it would be another boring week. Boring is GOOD. The after hours phone was set up a little weird. If you called the number, you got an automated system that would prompt you to press 1 to leave an URGENT voicemail or press 2 to leave a NONURGENT voicemail. After an URGENT voicemail was left, the phone would ring and notify you. If the issue was nonurgent, you would get a silent notifcation that you had received a voicemail. For urgent voicemails, you were expected to respond within 15 minutes. If you did not respond within 15 minutes, your supervisor received a notification. If you did not respond within 30 minutes, your supervisor received an automated call. For nonurgent voicemails, you were expected to respond within 24 hours. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn day 1 of my turn carrying the after hours phone, I get a nonurgent voicemail at 8pm. Remember, this is a silent notification with a required response time of 24 hours. I notice the notification around 10pm and call the user. She claims that she is able to print fine during business hours but is unable to print after 6pm. I try to ask some questions and walk her through some basic troubleshooting, but she's having none of it. She says she doesn't have time to do this, she has work to do, and I should just fix the problem. So, I poke around for a while, but can't really find anything. I get tier 2, and the bu involved, but they can't find anything either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt 8am the next morning, my boss is fielding a call from a furious user that says we refused to help her and asking why it took so long to get a response. My boss looks at the logs and sees that it was a nonurgent voicemail and lets the user know that she should have left an URGENT voicemail. An hour or so later, he fields another call, this time from the user's supervisor asking what's going on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got network infrastructure, systems infrastructure, and the business unit involved and none of us could find anything. The branch's server was rebooted and some logging enabled and we waited. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAround 10pm that night, the blackberry notifies me that I have an urgent voicemail. It's the same user. So, I tried to call her back on the number she left. There's no answer. I sign into sharepoint and get her work cell number, her office number, the main number for the branch, and her personal cell number. The user won't answer my phone calls to ANY number. I left voicemails on every number that I could, texted the user, and emailed the user. After exhausting ALL of those and receiving no response, I then emailed my boss and her supervisor. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEvery night for the rest of the week, this pattern repeated itself. I get an URGENT voicemail from the user, and then she completely ignores any and all attempts at communication. My boss gets calls every morning about IT not helping her with her problem. However, every morning my boss also gets documentation from me of all my attempts to contact the user. The calls from the blackberry are easily shown. The emails are in my sent items. The voicemails can be verified. After an entire week of this, the user's supervisor calls me to apologize personally... but tells me that the user will not suffer any repercussions because she is one of the top sales people. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI quit not too long after that...

We repaired it and he decided to call, asking for a new laptop because his broke and his hands were too big for that laptop that we repaired. We give out free laptops to all employees which they have to give back at the end of their contract.\n\n​\n\nUsually this is fine, but he commanded me to get him a new laptop \\*\\*right now\\*\\*, I asked to speak to my supervisor he agreed and I went there, explained to my supervisor his laptop was repaired but he still wanted a new one because his hands were too big for the keys. (Bit of context: we can order special laptops which are bigger, but the keyboard isn't bigger. It does have a larger screen and more CPU power etc). My supervisor told me that nothing was ordered and that he should contact his supervisor if he wanted a new one but the decision was still up to us if he actually needs one to do his job correctly.\n\n​\n\nSo I went back to the phone, unmuted the phone and told him: \"Sir, I just heard we don't have an order for a new laptop, however if you would like on you can contact your supervisor to put in a request.\". He went rage mode instantly: \"NO I DONT WANT MY SUPERVISOR TO GET A NEW ONE I WAS PROMISED TO GET A NEW ONE BY \\*\\*my supervisor name who didn't know about any of this\\*\\*, HE WOULD GET ME A NEW ONE!\".\n\n​\n\nAfter that I calmly said: \"Sir, a new laptop doesn't actually make the keyboard any bigger, just a bigger screen and more processing power\". So he said: \"I WANT THAT THEN AND FAST I NEED A LAPTOP!!\", but his laptop was repaired and he could get it if he wanted? Anyway: \"Sir, I'll ask my supervisor to call you back.\", he said a forced and annoyed fine and hung up the second after that.",

Right away, they began complaining about how they had to do everything, how I should just unplug anything and just get it done, before reaching in themselves and began unplugging things, summarily turning off the server. Eventually we got a power strip plugged in and the DVR Powered on.\n\nThen the real hell began. Right afterwards, the client quips, \"So now you're going to do the remote access for my cameras yea?\", and since my work order stated that Software had to be installed for the DVR, I assumed this meant configure the port forwarding for the DVR. Since this was a Dental Office, it had confidential patient records and as such, I was concerned for HIPAA compliance with having to create a port-forward to view the cameras (And yes, I know a VPN into the network from their phone would be a much more secure avenue, but most clients do not want to pay for a license for the VPN or the time it takes to set it up), but luckily after speaking with their offsite IT, I was informed that the network was structured in a way that the DVR was on the guest/unsecure side of the network, with a SonicWall protecting their office network. Easy peasy right? Wrong.\n\nAfter getting into their new AT&amp;T router, I configured the port forwarding to the static IP I had assigned to the router, and usually at this point it comes right up, remote viewing is available and job is done. Except it wasn't.\n\nA port-check to see if the port was open was coming up as Connection Timed Out or Connection Refused. I double checked my port forwarding and confirmed I was forwarding the correct port, to the correct address and the device was connected and capable of being access via the intranet.\n\nReally strange. So, after double checking my work, I can only assume that perhaps the issue is on the ISP's side. So we call up AT&amp;T's technical support, and I explain to the Technician what we're trying to do. Configure port forwarding, that the ports have been forwarded but the port is showing closed to the internet.\n\nCue the absolute hell that falls upon me. The technician can't figure what's going on, and he says the dreaded words. \"Can we try restarting the router?\". It's 12am, middle of the afternoon, busy Dental Office and he wants to shut off their internet, which runs EVERYTHING. Computers, Phones, Payment Processing. Everything. Goddamnit.\n\nI clarify with the Office Manager and the Owner, confirming with the AT&amp;T Technician on the phone that it'll be a downtime of 5 minutes at the max. How fucking wrong I was.\n\nOnce the router is restarted, the internet connection doesn't come back up. Five minutes go by, and I'm thinking in my head, \"Oh fuck. What did he do\". Lights are blinking on the router, Technician is asking me what they are doing and tells me something about the connection not syncing. Twenty Minutes go by, the office is at a standstill because nothing can be done, and I can already feel the pressure. I'm the one who's onsite. I'm the one who's gonna be blamed for this. What the fuck did the AT&amp;T Tech do. At this point, I tell the technician, \"Look. Fuck the port forwarding. I need their network back up now.\" but he says he's still working on it. Throws me on hold. God fucking damn it.\n\nThirty minutes in, still nothing is has happened. Internet is STILL down despite the broadband light being a solid green. Why the fuck is there internet access but their office has no internet? What the fuck has AT&amp;T done. Then the technician gets back and says, \"I'll have to transfer you to our 360 Care Center. They will be able to assist you\", but right before that takes place, I'm playing with the DVR and switch it from static to DHCP. Right away, it's assigned their PUBLIC IP address. Lightbulb illuminates, gears whirl away and I realize what is going on.\n\n\"What did you do to port 3\"\n\n\"I put it in IP passthrough sir\"\n\n\"Why the fuck did you put it in IP Passthrough. Take that off right fucking now\" Almost yelled this.\n\n\"I'm doing it right now sir. It's done sir. \"\n\nBut still, their internet doesn't come back up. He transfers me to 360 Care, while I grab my laptop and rush over to their IT Closet. Quickly get setup, throw a patch cable directly into the router and check my IP Config to see what address I'm assigned. And I almost shit a brick when I see it come back as a XXXX.XXXX.1.XXX\n\nTheir office network was the XXXX.XXXX.1.XXXX. The guest/DVR network was supposed to be a XXXX.XXXX.0.XXXX. I'm realizing what the fuck has happened, the colossal fuckup that has brought this busy Dental Office to a screeching halt for over 45 minutes now. The AT&amp;T technician had factory reset the router.\n\nNow that 2+2 has equaled four, and I realize what the fuck is going on, I'm logging into the AT&amp;T Router as quickly as I can, and resetting all the DHCP Pools to what it was before, and as this is happening, a AT&amp;T 360 Care rep comes on the line and we begin speaking. This technician is state-side, unlike the last technician, and then he says this line that really pissed me off. \"I don't know if the other technician told you, but this is a charge service. Are you authorized to authorize charges on this account?\" And I broke a very special rule. Never curse infront of a client. And I broke that very rule.\n\n\"What. No. The technician did not say that. I'm not authorized to authorize charges, and even if I was, I wouldn't be authorizing charges for AT&amp;T to fix what they fucked up. Your technician put this router into IP Passthrough Mode over a fucking port forwarding issue. He factory reset the router and now I'm rebuilding their network and because of his fuckup, they have been out of service for 45 minutes right now\"\n\nI shouldn't have taken out my anger on that rep, but luckily he understood and transferred me back to the Technical Support, but instead I got transferred to the phone department. Fuck it, I hung up the phone and finished the router configurations and reset the port forwarding required to their server.\n\nTheir network comes back up. Internet connectivity is back, but now it's almost been an hour. Reconfigure port forwrding towards the DVR on it's port, and check on my phone. A connection was made and I can see the cameras. Finally a break after 4 hours onsite. I should have only been here for one.\n\nA quick phone call to the boss keeping him up to date on the situation, filling him in with AT&amp;T's fuckup, and then on to speaking with the client about what happened and setting their phone up to view the cameras. They acts like they're happy, and confirms they can see them, but is rushing out to lunch.\n\nHave to get a signature on the work order, and the Office says to collect payment, but the Office Manager who's there won't issue it, calls the owner, who says they want to have my boss call them, and not to write a check. Great. Bounce between office and boss, keeping them in the loop. Office Manager walks out on break too.......didn't sign the work order. Can't leave without a signature. 20 minutes later, one of the guys in the Office signs off on it and I'm out of there.\n\nNext following day, I hear the tale of what happened between my boss and the Dental Office owner. A screaming match, where the owner was shaking, blaming us for the downtime and how they refuse to pay for any of the work done, OR the power supply that we provided because of their screw up.\n\nA total fucking nightmare from what I heard, and the owner even tried to say my boss was trying to shake them down for payment, and intimidate them because of their gender because my boss is a man and the owner is a woman. A total fucking nightmare. Apparently we aren't getting paid for the time, the job was a total loss of money, and how I screwed up by following the customers request to configure the port forwarding instead of throwing it in the lap of their IT person.\n\nAnd the day after? Apparently now the remote viewing has stopped working. But at this point, it was working when I left, so her IT person can deal with it.",

        "text": "This happened whilst I served in the Armed Forces, whilst I was spending 6 months in the sandbox.\n\nThe camp I was based at had a coupe of porta-cabins which contained DC's (Win2K), core switches and various other mission critical items of techie goodness. We had some giant generators outside the porta-cabins in case there was a power cut that lasted longer than UPS's did. These generators were meant to be serviced daily.\n\nAccess to the Porta-cabins was via a set of keys which needed ot be signed for and returned and signed back in, once finished with. However techies tended to just chuck the keys to who-ever needed them next. \n\nAnyway on a typically sunny day at this location, I was called to install a new POE switch and run a link back to the portacabins. I did this and returned the key.\n\nLater that day I needed to return to the portacabin. So I went to sign for the key, the key was signed out to $OtherTech. I found $OtherTech in the Naafi and asked if they still had the key, they said they had given it to $YetAnotherTech. So I found $YetAnotherTech and sure enough they had handed the key over to someone else. I admitted defeat and decided to go back to the Naafi for a slushy and a couple of games of Pool. \n\nA couple of hours later I was near the Portacabin again and this time someone else was stood outside shouting at ppl asking if they had the key, lets call this person $Sergeant. There was a loud beeping coming from the Portacabin. I did an abrupt about-turn and headed back for some more games of pool as this was one mess I did not want to get involved in. $Sergeant did not see me, my escape and evasion skills were on par. When I got back to the Naafi I noticed there was no power to anything so the slushy machine was out of order. \n\nI bumped into $AnotherTech who was looking for someone. They found who they were looking for. This was the person with the key to the porta-cabin. The person with the key was told to head to the porta-cabin with the key. I knew that $Sergeant was there and decided to tag-along to watch someone get spit roasted and psychologically destroyed. Sure enough $Sergeant went ballistic then grabbed the keys. The beeping had stopped. This meant one of two things, either power was back on or the UPS's had died. The power was not back on.\n\nLuckily at that very point an Electrician from our unit was wondering past. $Sergeant shouted a load of colourful language, the important bits were \"No machines can log onto network, no power, hook up the generator\". Our electricians are meant to do training on all equipment in the Sandpit before deploying. He must of been hungover on the day where he was shown this generator as he did not know how to use it. $Sergeant went ballistic. We found another Electrician, who could use the generator, we all helped push the generator nearer the portacabins and hooked up the cables. But it would not start. It had no fuel in it. Looking at the daily checks, it had been shown as having fuel that very morning and had been checked by the electrician who did not know how to use it, he had also signed off as having done a full functionality check and a test run.\n\nANyway, we managed to get fuel and power up the Porta-Cabin. Just as this happened, the power came back on.\n\nThat evening, we all had a briefing regarding the keys and only the person who signs for them is to have them and once finsihed theya re returned.\n\nThe electricians got destroyed and spent the following couple of days doing some additional training.\n\n",

        "text": "Hello everyone, first time poster here. This is a bit of a long story and takes place over a decade ago when I was working for a now bought out and absorbed cell phone carrier.\n\n\nWe were in the final stages of a new install. Brand new mobile telephone switch was installed, and two major metropolitan cities worth of cell sites were in the process of being constructed, and integrated.\n\n\nOne important fact, is that 3G EVDO, was an afterthought. So The voice network for CDMA was not IP based, and used a protocol called BCN which used what they call \"Traffic Ranges\", \"Traffic range groups\", and \"Ports\" for routing. Ports were assigned to a physical or logical T1 for example. However the EVDO cards at the same towers used PPP to an aggregate router at our location. It was inefficient since it required at least two T1's to every cell site, even when little to no traffic was being served by either most of the day.\n\n\nSo this is why a major telco vendor giant (we will called them $TITAN, for their widely known DACS hardware which used that name) approached my company to sell their brand new routers which could do Pseudowires for the proprietary voice t1's but would not transmit idle frames, allowing us to purchase one T1 to a cell site, and with the power of QoS prioritize voice but still allow EVDO to be installed without fractionalizing a T1. Sounds sweet right?\n\n\nSo to set the scene, this was on a friday and we were working 12+ hour days as the launch date when customers could buy service was fast approaching. It was around 8pm and I was working with a field tech to integrate one more cell tower before I could go home. Everything seemed to be going well. We finally got connectivity, I sent the load to the tower hardware and was waiting for it to finish and to give the tech the OK to go home himself. \n\n\nBefore giving the all clear I wanted to update the firmware on the cards because they were way out of date and throwing alarms. Unfortunately the updates failed. When troubleshooting why I noticed I suddenly had intermittent connectivity to the hardware so I called my field tech back to troubleshoot.\n\n\nAs soon as I called him the issue cleared. Confused I told him to hang tight and wanted to troubleshoot some more. After hanging up the issues started up again. I tested the T1's thoroughly which were not taking errors then started to question the $TITAN routers. I really wanted a smoke break so instead of calling him back from my desk phone I grabbed a test phone cell for our network so I could walk outside (I did not want to use my personal phones minutes from our competitor). The call originally failed which was odd, so I retried and this is when I noticed my subsystem ping cleared up again once it connected\n\n\nThis got me worried. I hung up to troubleshoot some more, and ran subsystem checks on our \"toy cell\" which is just a cell site on our loading dock which covers our office area and has a similar configuration. It also was having what appeared to be packet loss. I made a call from one of my test phones, to another and the issue cleared up. I then checked the status of the far away cell tower and it cleared up with my two calls on my local cell site only, and immediately had issues when I hung up. We had a real problem here, but why was it happening NOW?! we had over 100 sites integrated with this configuration.\n\n\nI called my boss and my coworker over and while they did not believe me at first, they could not refute the evidence. I checked alarms for our cell sites, and sure enough they were bouncing/flapping in the past couple hours! But why was MY calls so important to the network? It was then I logged into the call server, and noticed with my two calls up, it were the only two calls this multi million switch was doing. Remember, we were not a live switch. Normally we had a few dozen contractors working all hours of the day. But this was a dead time, apparently everyone went home and this was the first time it was truly idle and apparently the $TITAN hardware was losing sync when it literally had no calls.\n\n\nWe opened a ticket with the vendor, as our dedicated on-site techs from the company also drove out of the area to go home for the weekend. The vendor said they would pull logs but not to expect a response until Monday since we were not a live market.\n\n\nUnfortunately, with the packet loss and the fact we just made the alarming live to the NOC, this meant they would be forced to deal with all our hundreds of towers giving alarms over the weekend every few seconds. Not a good scenario.\n\n\nAfter talking with my coworker and boss, we decided on the best course of action. I took my two test cell phones. Plugged them into their chargers, and made a call between them. I then put a post it note on each of them on my desk, designating them as \"The most important call in the network\"\n\n\nOur $TITAN vendor took 4 weeks to come out with a software patch to fix their routers to not drop T1 frames on their pseudowires. After that I was finally able to hang up the most important call I ever made.",

        "text": "POS software support here. This actually happened today.\n\nWe had a data center outage somewhere that caused pretty much all of our clients to go down. Of course, half the universe starts calling in. Cue obligatory wailing and gnashing of teeth. \n\nWe take calls and tickets en masse. We pat hands. We listen to rants. We assure people we're working on the issue. \n\nHere's where $Dillweed comes in.\n\n$Dillweed is a man who likes to know *everything*, even the stuff he probably doesn't need to know. He also is the type to be as condescending as possible because he knows our support team is made up of almost all women. \n\nBut his all time favorite thing to do when reporting issues is to make a fucking continent out of a molehill. You could probably spill a spoonful of water in this man's house and he'd act like you carved your initials into the Bastille. That's how anal this man is.\n\nThis is the guy who once spent 20 minutes arguing with me about ***decimals***. Our software has a little wizard where you can assign a tax to your items for sale. You open the wizard. You name the tax. You put in the amount you want to tax and choose percentage or nominal amount. Whatever you put in will be the tax. This guy wants to know exactly how much tax will be put on the item if he puts in 2.5% or 25% or .00025 or 0.05. He wants me to do the calculations for exactly how much will be taken off based on what he enters. He then demands full documentation on how the software calculates mathematical amounts and percentages and rounding. (He did not get this.)\n\nAnother occasion had him demanding our server documentation and configuration info. And the exact processes we take to clean out the server/perform maintenance. And the times for doing so. And the names of the people who manage it. (He didn't get this either.) Why? Because the internet at his business is shitty and causes the software to disconnect a lot, and after six months of no less than five people, including higher-ups, telling him that it's his crappy internet, he STILL refuses to accept it. \n\nThis is the also the guy who raised hell because one of *his* users broke something in the software by doing a thing they were told NOT to do, causing a main component to start acting screwy. Took us a week to fix it, but I'm pretty sure if he was able to stand over us with a whip, he would. Then he asked what steps we were going to take to prevent it from happening again and if we planned on issuing a statement for the \"appalling amount of time it took to resolve the issue.\" (We didn't send this.)\n\nNow, picture the above, but picture it being demanded by a man who is very obvious in his blatant condescension and talks down to you like you're a child throughout the whole conversation. Oh, and who also likes to come up with difficult questions and then stuffily says stuff like, \"Shouldn't you know that?\" \n\nOn to today.\n\nWe got the all clear that the outage was over. We called/emailed people to let them know - most people were super appreciative. We basically said, \"Hi, the outage is over, everyone's back up, you're good to go.\" Keep in mind that this was a *data center outage* that had nothing to do with us. Our manager even sent out a mass email notifying everyone of the issue. \n\nI sent the same type of email to $Dillweed and closed out my ticket. He reopened it. He's how that whole email exchange went:\n\n&gt;$Drej:  Good afternoon, $Dillweed, I'm just reaching out to let you know that service has been successfully restored. You should now be able to access your $Software components as usual. Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns!   \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Dillweed: Hi $Drej, Thank you for the update. Will $Company be providing a report on the cause of the outage?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Drej: Hi, $Dillweed, you should have received an email from $Manager regarding the outage. All details should be included in that email!  \n&gt;  \n&gt;$Dillweed: I'm looking for something a lot more detailed than \"connectivity issues.\" Who would be able to provide me with more information about the cause of the problem and what steps $SoftwareCompany will be taking to prevent it from happening again in the future?\n\nI didn't email him back because I may have had a couple of seconds where I blacked out a little in rage before I told my manager about it. She basically said she'd be reiterating what they already said in the email. \n\nHonestly? I guess I'm not sure why I'm so pissed about this other than the fact that *maybe* this guy has finally made me snap. I get that you were down, that critical business processes were interrupted, there was frustration, ect. But the issue was resolved. It wasn't even our issue, which was clearly communicated to you. The CAUSE of the issue was already communicated to you. Why do we need to be giving you more details? Why do you need steps on our processes? \n\nThis wouldn't be so bad if I didn't already know he'll be shooting off as many emails to as many higher ups as he can find until he gets his answer. \n\nTL;DR: Condescending customer is more condescending. $SupportAnalystDrej almost sets customer's house on fire. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

A database?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **NPL:**  (*sounding frustrated*)  We're a non-profit organization that ...(*she goes on to describe what the non-profit does rather than answer the question.*)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **Me:**  Okay, I just mean, what I'm trying to get to the bottom of here is what is it that your business currently asks of your current tech company, that we would be providing?  Does that make sense?  \n\n It's important to note here that not once was I angry, frustrated, or anything other than polite to this lady.  I assume she had a moment of anger with her current tech support and called me in a rage with no real information or plan in mind.\n \n&gt; **NPL:**  Ok well, I don't think this is going to be a good fit.\n\n I smiled when she said that--maybe because I know I dodged a bullet, or because in just dealing with this person I too knew that this would end badly and certainly wasn't a good fit.\n\n&gt; **Me:**  Ok!  No problem and good luck!\n\n\nI should say that I like helping people figure out what they need and providing solutions for them, but they've got to know what it is they need and what they expect from me and my company.  \n\nIf you call a support company and just say \"DO NETWORKING FOR ME!\" into the phone they're probably not going to be much help.  Maybe I need to get better at asking questions to get to the root of what people really need, but then again, I've never encountered a person who just repeats the same questions and non-answers and expects me to just say, \"Yes we can do all of the things you *have not mentioned once in your non-answers!*\"\n\nSo PSA to companies in search of tech support:  Know what you need, what you want, what your expectations are before you call---or at least be willing to talk it out with the tech provider to reach those goals *together.*",

I love my job for the free travel but sometimes... well.. sometimes I wind up with a weird one. \n\n\nLike last week. \n\n\nOne of our \"clients\"* is a super cool non-profit/NGO with a mission to further medical education for fixing/preventing problems with a particular part of the body in developing countries. As part of the program they have an aircraft fitted out with a classroom, operating room, etc., etc., -- totally self-sufficient if they need to be, including water purification, generating their own medical oxygen, etc. [this would be so much easier if I weren't trying to keep things anonymous ;) ] \n\nLike I said: Cool group, cool mission, and as an aviation geek: I get to work on/around a very cool plane. When the opportunity first presented itself several years ago, I was 150% on board. \n\nAnyway, one of the complaints/concerns since my last visit--somewhere much less exotic--was that audio on some of the recordings sounded distorted. \n\n99.9% of the time this is because the volume into the recorder (or somewhere else in the signal chain) is too high and 'clipping'. \n\nI got a sample of an affected recording and sure enough, I'm even more convinced that's the problem. And I asked them to try turning it down. \n\nThe client's team had some concern about being qualified to turn the volume down themselves. \n\nSo I wound up on a plane, flew from the US to Mongolia (via China), turned the volume down... confirmed the problem was resolved. And flew home. \n\nObviously, that wasn't the only thing I accomplished -- one of the big wish list items had been to observe an actual program to see where we can drive improvements and that was the most valuable accomplishment -- but if felt weird starting the trip with the official to-do list being, entirely: \n\nTurn volume down. \n\n^(*- Client is in quotes because of the unique financial arrangement where they don't actually pay us.)

        "text": "I will do my best to anonymize this story as best I can. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis tale goes back to my time working for a local government. I was a member of that organization's helpdesk. As a helpdesk employee, there was generally no overtime or after hours work. When your eight hours for the day were up,  you were done. There was one exception. The helpdesk provided IT support for city council meetings. These meetings started at either 4pm or 5pm and happened three times per month. A typical meeting might last 2-3 hours, but some meetings went on for 8+ hours. They were always on the same weeknight. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was not that weeknight. My girlfriend had called me and expressed an interest in going to see a movie with a friend of ours. I got off work at 5pm, but our friend worked until 6pm. My girlfriend and I had planned to grab a light supper before the movie. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boss came in at 4pm and informed me that there was a budget meeting starting at 5pm and since it was my turn in the rotation, I would have to cover it. I called my g/f to let her know that I had to work late and I had no idea how late it would be. She decided to go hang out at her favorite coffee shop a few miles away from the theater until I could let her know what was going on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe meeting was relatively uneventful. The video streaming software that recorded the meeting crashed a couple of times, which was not unusual. Otherwise, the meeting went off without a hitch and actually ended around 6:30. I let my g/f and friend know that I was now free and made my way to the theater. City hall was much closer to the theater than either of them and they both needed a little time to get ready, so I was sitting in the parking lot of the theater on a conference call with them as we tried to work out what movie we were going to see. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe finally decided on a movie and ended the call after maybe 10-15 minutes. I was tasked with buying tickets for us all so that we wouldn't have any delays getting in to see the movie. I was maybe 20-30 feet from the ticket counter when the doors burst open and people running out. It was surreal to see these people moving QUICKLY, but with very little sound. The only thing I heard people say was \"Get in the car!\".  I stood there for maybe a second or two trying to process what was going on when the person whose car was closest to me got close enough for me to hear him telling the 911 operator that there was an active shooter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI turned and ran back to my car to tell my g/f and friend NOT to come to the theater. Each of those calls probably took 10 seconds or so. By the time I was able to start my car, the first police car had rolled into the parking lot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend later asked why I hadn't gone back in to help. Besides being an IT tech, I'm also a firearms instructor and concealed carry instructor in my state. I asked him how he would differentiate between an active shooter and a good samaritan with a concealed handgun permit. I asked him how the police entering the theater would know whether \\*I\\* was the active shooter or a good samaritan with a concealed handgun permit. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy wife still believes that fate presented me with some unexpected overtime to prevent us from being in that theater...",
