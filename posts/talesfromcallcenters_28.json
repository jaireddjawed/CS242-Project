        "text": "I work at a large mobile phone carrier in tech support. I got a call from this guy a month or so ago, and he's pissed because the software update basically horked his tablet. This tablet was not purchased from us, he is not the original user, and it's 3 years old. Three strikes against us replacing the device under warranty. Of course I offer to troubleshoot but he says he already did a factory reset. OK, that's fine, nothing else I can do here then... But not according to this dude. He was convinced that because the software was a new update that the software should have a new warranty. I explained to him every which way I could think of that the warranty doesn't work that way - it's a 1 year manufacturers warranty and software falls under that one year of coverage. ANY device that gets a software update runs this risk. \n\nI can sort of see his point - it really sucks for a new update to crash an old device - but that's the risk we take every time software on any electronic device is updated. It's a small risk, but it's always there. Frustrating to be sure... But that's not our fault. He ended up wanting to talk to Google. I told him up front they won't be able to do much for you, but that's what he wanted. \n\nI spent a good 45 minutes explaining to this guy how a basic warranty works and he either refused to understand or refused to agree... It's so aggravating, refusing to accept the truth won't make it not true! ",

Ey. Listen. Yo bill got me fucked up, bruh. Y'all charging me FO' HUNNID FUCKIN DOLLA, yo girl at the office tellin' me my bill gon' be two fiddy. This damn bill can't be right.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir, you've been routed here to tech support. Were you having any issues with your services or equipment? If it is strictly related to billing, I can get you over to the correct department to offer you a breakdown of the charges and assist you with any billing disputes. *internally* Please say yes, please say yes, please say yes.\"\n\n\"Naw, dawg. You mean you can't see my bill? I'm lookin' at my bill right now, and you KNOW yo girl fucked up, y'all better give me a credit or something fo' dis uh, dis inconvenience - dis a inconvenience, y'all can't just be doin' people like this, you better get me a supervisor or something, dawg, 'cause I'm not paying this bill. Y'all better give me some credit for dis inconvenience and some channels fo' free.\"\n\n\"Hm. Hang on just a moment, sir. Let me review your billing. I will advise that I'm not a specially trained billing agent, though I do have some access to your regular statements. I won't deny you a supervisor, though. I just have to build up a memo for why I'm requesting one, if that's alright.\"\n\n\"Aight.\"\n\n\"Hm. Sir, it looks like you're paying roughly $315 per month, and it includes all available services, including some upgrades and full channel subscriptions. These things seem to have a lot of discounts already attached to them. On the statement that you have on hand, you mentioned that you were being billed $400?\"\n\n\"Yeah, man. That's what I'm talking about right there. That's fo' hunnid dolla'!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, sir. Do you mean the $315?\"\n\n\"Yeah, man!\"\n\n\"Maybe I'm missing something, sir? I don't see any extra charges that would get this close to $400.\"\n\n\"Okay, man, look: $315?\"\n\n\"Yes sir, that for sure I can see here.\"\n\n\"Add $85 to that. How much you get?\"\n\n\"$400, but that's rounding up almost a full $100 that aren't being charged.\"\n\n\"Look, *Lyingassplatypus*, you got my bill, you can see I'm being charged fo' hunnid dolla', let me speak wit yo supervisor, please.\"\n\n\"Of course, sir. I'll add in all of the data I've collected so far. My apologies for any confusion and inconvenience this has brought you. Obviously you are not satisfied with the pricing for your packaging. If there's anything we can do, yadda-yadda-yadda.\"\n\n\nSupe sent him to billing. ",

        "text": "I work for an institution that is currently in the news for employees allegedly going against policy, and even breaking the law just to get sales and meet goals. \n\nI get a call on Saturday from a girl who wants to open a tax free savings account (TFSA). We can open accounts in real time provided they are of legal age, a Canadian resident, and have sufficent ID on file. For ID we have two lists. List one is primary ID like drivers license, passport, nexus card, etc. List 2 is secondary such as birth certificate, social insurance number and provincial health card. To open an account You need one from list 1 or two from list 2. \n\nThis customer has one from list 2, and a *student card* on file. Student cards do not appear anywhere on the list of our approved ID. Thus she does not have sufficient ID for a live account opening. She has to go into a branch. This is where things get interesting. \n\nHer: What do you mean I can't open an account with you?\n\nMe: You don't have enough ID on file with us. You need to go in to the branch with photo id to open the account and have them update your profile. \n\nHer: But I just did this with my other savings last month. \n\nCue record scratch\n\nMe: one moment please - put her on hold\n\nI review her savings account, and sure enough, one of us opened an account two weeks ago over the phone. I check the journal, and nope, ID hasn't been changed since then. They did it with insufficient ID. Fire off email to her TM in case this escalates due to the media issue currently going on. Go back to the customer. \n\nMe: thank you for holding. I did confirm that the account you opened 2 weeks ago was done over the phone, but that account opening did not conform to our procedures and I will not be able to open another account for you today. \n\nHer: so you're not going to get me my TFSA today? \n\nMe: I'm very sorry, but no, I can't do it over the phone. \n\nHer: Why not? \n\nMe: You dont have enough ID on file for us to open an account live. It appears the previous agent made an oversight, but a tfsa is an account registered with the Canadian government and it would be a grave error to open it against policy .\n\nHer: so....I cant open the account with you? \n\nMe: No. \n\nHer: this is so stupid. The other girl did it. Why can't you just do it too?\n\nMe: As I said, you don't have ID on file, this account is registered with the government, so opening it up without id may not only be against policy but possibly also illegal. I'm not willing to take that risk. \n\nHer: whatever. I'll call back tomorrow. \n\nI saved her account information. I plan on checking on Tuesday when I'm back in to see if anyone did in fact open her a tfsa over the phone. ",

It's not mandatory, but it's a cool piece of tech.\n\nSo with that said, yesterday I got a call from a lady whose tablet would not connect to the tech, and she was flying into a rage. \"It's broken! We had one of your men out yesterday to fix it, and he could connect to it on his iPhone! Why won't it work on my tablet?\"\n\nSo that's my first clue that it's likely her tablet that's the problem. And I walk through all the troubleshooting I know how to do to try to fix it. I even get somebody who knows more than I do to help out. Meanwhile this woman is grumbling and laughing in unfunny, un-amused way while I have her wait, while I ask her to check things for me, and while I basically work my ass off.\n\nFinally, the verdict comes in from the tech support experts. Yep, it's her tablet. This woman bought a $7000 bed and a $50 tablet from Walmart. We looked it up and everything. It's so cheap that it has a shoddy Bluetooth connection that drops constantly.\n\nSo I explain the issue to her, phrased politely, and give her some advice. Since we don't do tech support for devices, just for our technology, we can't really tell her how to fix her tablet, but we do tell her that she might want to try googling some fixes, or to try a different device.\n\n\"Are you telling me I can't use my brand new tablet with this bed?\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am. I'm afraid so.\"\n\nPause.\n\n\"I want your manager. Now.\"\n\nOkay, because my manager is gonna be able to fix that...",

        "text": "\nAirline guy, I got another story...\n\nSo when you work frontline the best calls are from passengers who know exactly what they want. Get them on, get them off, they know how everything works it's a win/win.\n\nSo naturally when a passenger wants to book a flight and they already have the flight numbers it means they already know the flight times and it makes less verbiage on the call for you. So a lady calls in, gives me the cities and dates and tells me the flight numbers. When I'm recapping the flights for her I give her the big once over so we are on the same page. \n\n&gt; M- so, just to confirm we have you leaving out of Seattle at 745am flight xx going to Honolulu via Los Angeles arriving at 10pm\n\n&gt; L- yes that's right\n\nThis is where I shoot myself in the foot. Because I notice that she has a long connection, HOWEVER everyone is different, I've come to learn that some ppl love short connections because they travel frequently and know how to book it in the airport...others prefer connections that are hours long, possibly to avoid a worse case scenario delay that might make them miss a connection. Either way I mention that \"you have a nice big connection to get some shopping or dinner in the airport\" which is where I fucked myself. I was trying to make her fully aware so there were no issues when she called back, but she completely throws it on me:\n\n&gt; L- wait a minute, how long is my connection?\n\nLike...didn't you give ME the flight numbers with the arrival and departure times?\n\n&gt; M- you provided me with a flight xxx and flight xxx correct? That departs at 745, you depart lax around 6pm.\n\n&gt; L- **GASP** Absolutely NOT. YOU TELL ME THIS AFTER I GIVE YOU MY CREDIT CARD? Absolutely not! This is not the flight I wanted this connection is all day!!!\n\n&gt; M- would you prefer a shorter connection? The flight that you gave me would get you in at that time how much earlier are we looking at here?\n\n&gt; L- WHY WOULDNT YOU TELL ME THIS INFORMATION ABOUT THE FLIGHT PRIOR TO TAKING MY CREDIT CARD? THIS HAS TO BE AGAINST SOME POLICY.\n\nRight. The policy where I assumed you fucking knew if you got into Los Angeles at 9am and you don't leave until 6pm...that would be you physically waiting through the airport...since you...gave me, the flight numbers...and I read the departure times back to you...\n\nSo of course, I price the new flight times and it's more than the original flight she wanted (lol get rekt m8)\n\n&gt; M- **tells her the new price**\n\n&gt; L- I need to speak with a supervisor about this, I've spent 45 minutes waiting on the phone for this, and now you tell me this is all my fault...unbelievable\n\n\n**switches songs on my iPod conveniently snuggled between my headset and one ear**",

If there was a seat available when you checked, what compels a person to think that seat couldn't possibly be booked by someone else if they choose to make a decision at a later time? Why didn't you just put the reservation on a hold? Why didn't you buy it when you had the chance if you \"just saw it\" an hour ago??????????????????\n\n&gt; M- \"im sure that may have been the case, it does seem at this time those flights are all sold out\"\n\n&gt; L- \"no, there was ONE seat available just now what kind of scam are you running here\"\n\nI hate when customers take digs at my company. Time to be passive aggressive.\n\n&gt; M- \"ma'am, had there been a seat available as you say, are you not looking to book for two passengers?\"\n\n&gt; L- **hangs up**\n\n\n\nGood riddance.

        "text": "Hi again! I've posted here a few times, so sorry if any of y'all are sick of me, but I've got another story! :D Again, I apologize for being long-winded as usual. I try to cut the fat, guys, I do!\n\nI work in a 24/7 finances help center at a University. That's all we really need for this one.\n\nSo on Wednesday, a lady called in at about 5:30 (when all of our escalation offices are closed, hooray) claiming that a financial aid representative was supposed to get back to her about her FA refund, but didn't. Of course, the financial aid rep *had* indeed emailed her but the lady (Customer) cannot fathom that perhaps she missed it.\n\nAnyway, Customer apparently wanted her refund a week ago because \"how am I supposed to pay for my books?\" However, the semester starts on the 13th, and all students' aid is disbursed at the same time 10 days before classes begin. Yeah, it's kinda short, but it's been the process for a long time. \n\nNaturally, she was pissed, (it had been mailed that Monday, as refunds take some time to generate) and ranted at me, nonstop, for about 20 minutes going on and on about how we *should* have sent it a week ago (where the hell did she get that idea) and \"how am I gonna pay for my books? I need my books for class?\" over and over and over. \n\nOnce I can finally get a word in, I go ahead and let her know an email had been sent (\"Well I never got it\") and read that to her. It was a very polite email informing her that federal guidelines do not allow for funds to be disbursed until 10 days before the semester starts, and then the counselor recommended that she reach out to her instructors to let them know she wouldn't be able to get her books.\n\nSo the rant starts off again, she's demanding to know why it wasn't sent the week before, how nobody's helping her (she's been in touch with like 3 counselors who have given her extensive info) and how she's really disappointed with *insert University name here*\n\nHere's where it gets fun. I go ahead and remind her that this is a federal regulation that we follow and that this process will likely remain the same for all of her future semesters.\n\nC: \"There is no law.\"\n\nMe: \"Well, there is a federal--\"\n\nC: \"That is not a law. Don't you dare lie to me.\"\n\nMe: [a little baffled, made the mistake of hesitating for just a brief second and oh god there she goes]\n\nC: \"There is no federal law. I know a little bit about the law (fuck you lady and I don't?) and there is no such law.\"\n\nMe: \"Ma'am, I'm just wanting to let you know that this is a process that will continue, and it *is* due to that federal-\"\n\nC: \"Don't you lie to me. There is no law. They're telling you to tell me that. I know the law-\"\n\nMe, trying again: \"As do I, however-\"\n\nC: \"and there *is. no. LAW.* They've told you to tell me that, but I don't want to be lied to. There's no law. You might not know any better, just know what they told you (if I worked face to face customer service, my face in response to that would have gotten me fired) but I am telling you there is no law.\"\n\nMe: \"Okay, ma'am. I am not going to argue that anymore. However, the refund was sent on Monday to [address] and should be arriving soon.\"\n\nCustomer was silent for a good thirty seconds. I gave my customary \"Hello?\" \"Ma'am?\" For another 20 seconds before I went into my script:\n\nMe: \"Ma'am, unfortunately I am unable to hear you if you are speaking. If you have any further questions, I recommend that you connect with us during business hours so that we can have you speak with someone in student accounts who can give you more clarity--\"\n\nC: \"What good would that do? What good would that do? You tell me! What good would that do? Are they gonna get me my money? [in a voice clearly begging for pity] All I wanted was to get my books.\" Rinse and repeat.\n\nMe: \"Ma'am, quite frankly, it would not do any good other than to explain what I've told you today. I was offering that because I thought we had been disconnected, and was letting you know that if you needed further clarificaton-\"\n\nThe rest of the call went on, ranting for 10 minutes, then \"I shouldn't be fussing at you, I apologize\", followed by another 15 minutes of \"fussing\" at me, etc. etc.\n\nFinally, I reached a point where I just said, \"Ma'am, is there anything that I can help you with today?\" Because literally she wasn't even trying to get us to speed up the process or accomplish some impossible feat, she was just bitching.\n\nHer response was \"I just wanna buy my books\" And after 10 more mins of whining I let her know there was nothing we could do and managed to end the call. Thank. *God.*\n\nFinally, LET IT BE SAID that I *do* feel for these people, I do. This woman had genuine concerns unlike a lot of the entitled assholes that call in. It kind of sucks not getting your refund till a few days before classes, but we do have the policies and procedures posted on our website. They are given lots of opportunities to prepare for this, and while I expect frustration and irritation, and I did feel bad for this lady, the fact of the matter is life sucks sometimes and yelling at some girl over the phone who's just trying to buy her books too isn't helping anyone.\n",

        "text": "Hi friends, Pierogituxedo here with another story for the book!\n\nThis happened a few weeks ago. \n\nI work for a company who does a lot of work for veterans outside of giving discounts. We build homes, support wounded warrior initiatives, employ countless newly minted civilians, etc.\n\nOne day, I had a nice man who called in asking about our military discount policy. Our policy is very clear: We DO offer a military discount in our stores with valid military ID or DD214. This discount is ONLY available in stores on IN-STORE merchandise.\n\nIn the online department, where I work, we have no real way of verifying military service and are not to give the discount under any circumstance, due to the rampant surge in \"Stolen Valor.\"\n\nI was speaking with the nice veteran, who I'll call GrandpaVet, because during the conversation, he told me all about his grandchildren and how much fun they'll have with the product he was getting. (It was a really cool swing set, slide combo!)\n\nMe: OK GrandpaVet, I got you all set here, Lemme just get your credit card and we'll have your grandkids running and playing in no time!\n\nGV: (Chuckling) Oh thank you, Pierogi, My kiddos are gonna love this thing. Hey, one more question. I'm a vietnam vet, and disabled, and a senior. (chuckles) Usually when I go to the store, I get a military discount. Can you apply that for me?\n\nMe: Ah! Thank you so much for your service, GrandpaVet!\n\nGV: Thank you for yours! Helping me get this and all!\n\nMe: Well, I can't honor the military discount on an online purchase due to the fact that our policy only allows for the discount to be applied in the store on store purchases. I can--\n\nGV: Hang on now, If I go into the store after I purchase this and show them my ID, can they apply it there?\n\nMe: No sir, because it would still be an online purchase. It only extends to sto--\n\nGV: OK, I got ya. How about if I go into the store to make the purchase there? Will they give me my discount then?\n\nI could feel him getting a little tense...The happy grandpa I had been talking to was slowly going away.\n\nMe: No sir, It's only for in-store-\n\nGV: Now I've been mighty nice throughout this whole ordeal ordering this product from you, Pierogi, and I like you a whole lot, but there's gotta be a way to apply this discount. I'm on a fixed income and can't spend too much money on extra things like this.\n\nMe: I totally understand GV, trust me I do, but my company poli-\n\nGV: I lost a leg for you and your company in Vietnam! All that Agent Orange is still in my lungs! You give me that discount or you get me a manager, simple as that!\n\nWith that, I stopped and stated:\n\nMe: Alright, let me get you a manager sir, It's been my pleasure to serve you. One moment.\n\nI transferred to my manager, a former Navy Commander with 23 years of service.\n\nEDIT: Asked Manager how it went. Customer did not get discount, and ended up hanging up on the manager.",

Also almost half of her coworkers are foreigners. In her short time there, she realized just how dumb and mean people can be. This is one of those people.\n\n&gt;GF: *(in a slightly accented filipino voice)* Hello there! Welcome to [company]. My name is [name]. How may i help you?\n\n*In what my gf referred to as the \"give me your manager\" kind of tone, Racist Bitch replied:*\n\n&gt;RB: Wait, you're not american? I thought this was an american company.\n\n&gt;GF: No mam, im Filipino, and yes this company is US based, however we do services and has branches all over the world.\n\n&gt;RB: I want you to transfer my call. I dont want to talk with third world blumbering idiots like you.\n\n&gt;GF: Mam I can assure you i am quite trained and well experienced in this job. Please tell me your issue so i can help you fix it.\n\n&gt;RB: Didn't you hear me you fucking idiot? I said TRANSFER MY CALL. I want to talk to somebody of my own IQ, I dont want to deal with somebody of your own species. And i want your whole name too. You should have transferred my call the first time i said it you moron.\n\n*That's right folks, RB doesn't see my GF as the same of her own species. GF is at first reluctant to transfer her call, as doing it is a way of showing incompetence, but this bitch is really taking it too far. GF being the devious little devil she is, transferred the call to Co-worker A.*\n\n&gt;Co-worker A: *(in a very heavy indian accent)* Hello mam. My name is [name]. How may i help you?\n\n**RB LOST HER SHIT**. Cue screaming. Cue cussing. Screaming about how incompetent the company is, the classic how she's going to get them all fired, that she's an important person, blah blah blah.\n\nGF and Co-worker finally earned the grounds to to hang up on RB (in their job, hanging up is a big no no) and for their manager to block her number. Nowadays, whenever their office needs a big laugh, they just play the recording of her call on the intercom.",

We'd fully briefed all tier 1 agents by this point so they all knew to simply remote in and change the name of the shortcut back again. GBL continued to refuse to allow us to amend permissions of the shortcut to prevent her from changing the name. By this point it's clear that GBL keeps accidentally changing the name of the shortcut herself.\n\nThe situation came to a head a couple of weeks later when we had a visit from $HRlady as it turns out GBL had made an official complaint with HR about IT \"purposely\" interfering with her computer. Luckily we had a trail of evidance by this point which $HRlady took one look at and agreed GBL was an idiot. In the spirit of things however HR suggested some \"one to one\" training with GBL.\n\nGBL refused the one to one training on the basis that she already has a \"certificate of proficiency in computering\" and apparently has now also obtained a \"certificate in bing\". GBL left the company a few weeks later and went to work for a rival business. \n\n$servicedeskmanager and $servicedeskmanageratrivalbusiness are good friends and $servicedeskmanageratrivalbusiness has informed $servicedeskmanager that GBL is just as much of a nuisance caller at rival business as she was with us.",

We're just a help center, we can give information on the account and recommend students on who to talk to, but we can't actually lift their holds or make decisions on appeals or anything like that.\n\nOur long, two-rep conversation went a bit like this (Customer will be EA (entitled asshole) and I will be me!) Keep in mind throughout this that he had a heavy accent and was mumbling; it was very difficult to understand and that much more frustrating. **I will also apologize at this point for the length of this post, but I want to transcribe it word for word so that you understand how literally asinine and ridiculous this was. I'm sorry for your scroll wheels**:\n\nEA: \"I have a hold on my account that I would like to have removed so I can enroll in classes.\"\n\nMe: *verifies his identity, pulls up his account to see what kind of hold it is so I know who he needs to get in touch with*\n\nMe: \"Oh, I do see that. Well, if the balance is paid, it is possible that our Collections office can try to speed up the process of getting that hold lifted so we can get you enrolled, but they are closed for the weekend. They will be back on Monday, if you'd like to call back.\"\n\nEA: \"Monday is way too late. I need to enroll in classes.\"\n\nMe: \"I understand, but unfortunately, our Collections office is closed for the weekend, and they are the only ones who can lift this hold for you.\" \n\nEA: \"Monday is too late. Who can lift my hold right now?\"\n\nMe: \"Sir, the earliest that we can get that hold lfited for you would be on Monday.\"\n\nEA: \"But I need to enroll in classes. Give me their phone number.\"\n\nMe: \"You actually called the correct number, but their line transfers to us after business hours. You will need to call the same number between 8-5 on Monday.\" \n\nEA: \"Is anyone still there?\"\n\nMe: \"...No sir. All of our offices are closed.\"\n\nEA: \"It is only 5:30 there. They haven't all gone home yet.\"\n\nMe: \"Sir... their office is closed. There is no one here who can lift your hold.\"\n\nEA: \"Go upstairs and talk to someone. Monday is way too late.\" [okay fuck you dude]\n\nMe: \"Sir, their office is closed. There is nobody in the office.

I figured maybe he was just one of those who needs to hear it from someone else, so I offer to get someone else.

Nobody can get in. The office is closed.\"\n\n. \n\nEA: \"Can I get their email?\" \n\nIB (Innocent Bystander, my coworker): \"Sure!

I need the email of a person who can lift it tonight.\"\n\nIB: \"Sir, I am not allowed to give out that information.\"\n\nEA: \"May I get their phone number?\"\n\nIB: \"No.\"\n\n. \n\nIB: \"What I would recommend if you are very concerned about the class filling up, is that you contact the instructor and let them know that you are currently in the process of getting a hold lifted and see if he can perhaps reserve you a seat. There are no guarantees, but that is the best we can do at this point.\" \n\nEA, in direct response: \"So what do you recommend?\" \n\n.\n\nIt just ended kind of suddenly after another 20 minutes of repeating and me snickering in the background. Aside from the obvious shock at how repetitive this shit was, can we talk about the fucking *entitlement* this kid must have to expect someone to spend their Friday night lifting his fucking hold in their free time? What makes him better than any other student? That part made me actually angry, despite how funny the situation was. ",

I live in an apartment and don't know her or where she moved to and I don't read this magazine.\"\n\n*Now we don't have magazines per se but we do have some publications and mailings so I figured this would be straightforward, just find the address and change the record to show that person no longer lived there so we'd stop sending mail there.*\n\nMe: \"Ok, sure.

What is the publication about?\"\n\nCaller: It's about exercise and stuff. \n\n*Starting to suspect this is not anything put out by us.*\n\nMe: \"Ma'am, what is the title of the magazine?\"\n\nCaller: \"Well, I'm not really sure, the picture of the girl on the front covers up most of the title.\"\n\nMe: *getting more suspicious*  \"Ok, that really doesn't sound like anything we would send out.  How did you get our number?\"\n\nCaller: \"It was just in the magazine.\"\n\nMe: \"Was it in the front where it has all the names of the people who worked on it and the publisher?\"\n\nCaller: \"No, it was just in there.\"\n\n*After a little more back and forth I realize we had an ad in the magazine and it had our number or she called information to get our number*\n\nMe:  \"Ok, ma'am. That doesn't appear to be our publication. What you need to do is go to the front of the magazine where it tells you how to contact the publisher and reach out to them to cancel the subscription. It should be one of the first few pages.\"\n\nCaller: \"Oh!  Ok.  Let me look then.\" *pages rustling*  \"Ok I think I found it. The number is 1-800 C-O-N-T-A-C...\" I'm making this up, I can't remember the actual number.) \n\nMe: *realizing she had just found another ad and is reading me the number for 1800Contacts*  \"Sorry to interrupt ma'am but that's just another company that is advertising in the magazine, not who published it.\"\n\nCaller: \"Oh, dear. Well, I'm not sure what to do.\"\n\nMe: \"Tell you what, why don't I try to figure out what magazine it is and then I can look up the number online for customer service.\"\n\nCaller: \"Would you, honey?

Can you tell me the celebrity on the cover or at least what she looks like?\"\n\nCaller: \"I don't know who she is but she's real pretty.

        "text": "I got a call from a customer who was having issues with slow speeds over WiFi on her laptop. From the start, I will say that her attitude was rather condescending and reeked of \"millennial entitlement syndrome,\" but I mostly ignored it. I verify her account, and as I see her information load on the screen, I notice that not only is her device online, but the signal strength is excellent and she has a pretty good gateway that she purchased from a company whose name I will not disclose.\n\nShe tells me she has a few other devices connected to WiFi, but her laptop is the main one she's having an issue with (1st red flag). She ran a speed test over WiFi and was getting like *20mbps (she's paying for a *50mbps package). While that's not great, it's also not enough to send a tech for and it's limited to the one device. I had already explained to her the basics; WiFi speeds are not guaranteed and can vary; the more WiFi in the area, the more interference; common in apartment buildings and the like, etc.; great we had gotten all of that shit out of the way. \n\nThe tool we run to detect network issues didn't detect any problems with our network going into the home or any home signal problems in general, so that usually means it could be an issue with the device. Since she was using her own purchased device, the next step is to reach out to the manufacturer for further assistance. This is what transpired:\n\nC = Customer, M = Me\n\nM: This is what I'm going to recommend, just so we can get the best and most accurate results of the speeds you're receiving. I'd want you to plug your laptop directly into your device with an Ethernet cable and then we'll run another speed test. Do you have one of those available?\n\nC: (Huffy) Well, yeah. But I don't see how that's gonna resolve my problem. I barely use Ethernet anyway, it's like so antiquated.\n\nM: Well, plugging directly to the device will get better speeds. This is usually why most gamers prefer to use Ethernet instead of WiFi to get the best gameplay results. Otherwise, your game would probably lag more often and the next thing you know, you're dead (we chuckle).\n\nC: Yeah, well (laughs) I don't game so...ok...\n\nM: (Thinking) *Clearly*\n\nI hear her fiddling around with her laptop for a moment and then a sigh of either confusion or realization, I'm not sure.\n\nC: My laptop doesn't have an Ethernet port...\n\nM: (WTF?) Really? Are you sure?\n\nC: (Snotty) I know what an Ethernet port looks like and I definitely don't have one.\n\nEarlier in the call she had mentioned she had a certain fruit company's laptop. Remembering this, and knowing that that particular company (for whatever weird-ass reason) decided to remove the Ethernet ports on their later model laptops, I realize that she's going to have to use a USB Ethernet adapter. I was quite certain she probably didn't have one of those (since...ew...Ethernet, why would she right? /sarcasm), but I had to ask.\n\nM: Ah, you must have one of the newer [fruity-laptops] that doesn't have one of those. Usually you need to use a USB Ethernet adapter to use an Ethernet connection. You wouldn't happen to have one of those would you?\n\nC: (Snotty again) Uhh...no.\n\nM: Okay, so at this point, the signals coming through the home and the device are great and within specs. There also aren't currently any network issues going on, so you would need to contact your manufacturer to dig deeper into what's going on with your speeds.\n\nC: (Completely snotty at this point) I don't see what that has to do with anything. Like is it even possible that it could be a device issue?\n\nM: It's possible. There are many factors that can contribute to slower speeds that could be device related such as the router module having issues, or even a needed firmware update. You would need to reach out to them to find out for sure so they can rule out any device issues.\n\nC: But this is like a really good modem and I just bought it. I think this is a [Company] issue and I just want it fixed.\n\nM: I can definitely understand that. Your network is showing to be in good shape, though. So because we're not able to troubleshoot your hardware, I'd want you to go through the correct avenue to get that done. \n\nC: (Rudely) Yeah but I still don't see how you're fixing my problem by telling me that.\n\n*I pause to collect myself as she is aggravating the hell outta me at this point*\n\nM: Once again, the signal lev- (cuts me off...one of my MAJOR pet peeves)\n\nC: (Snippy af) Yeah, I heard you the first time.\n\n*I pause briefly again*\n\nM: Okay, so is there anything else that I can help you with? (Thinking) *Since you admittedly heard me the 1st time and thus know what to do from here*\n\nC: (Condescending) Is your only response going to be call the manufacturer of my modem to fix my problem?\n\nM: Yes. \n\nC: *click*\n\n(*) = True speeds have been altered for confidentiality purposes",

If you have dependents enrolled on your benefits your company may wish to have them verified. A company can do this at any time. Typically it happens after annual enrollement.\n\nI just started this job coming up on 2 months ago. I have worked in call centers before doing other HR related duties. I will admit I am still learning the in's and out's and all the details of my job.\n\nIts late in my shift and I get a call, I wont put the company on blast but its an airline company. This specific company not only has us verify dependents for Benefits but for passengers of Employees who want them to fly for free. The customer calls in and hes pretty annoyed. He wants to know why his step-mother hasnt been verified as a passenger. I didnt set things off on the right tone when I told him we dont verify passengers.\n\nSo I place him on hold and review my resources. After having him hold for an extended period of time, I come back on the line and apologize for the long hold and for the mininformation. I explain to the customer that after further review I was wrong and we do verify passengers and that documenation we received for his step-mother was not what we needed to verify.\n\nFlying off at the handle the customer raises his voice and asks; \n\nCustomer \"What do you mean its not what you needed? Im looking right it.\"\nMe \"Sir if youre looking right at it then you would see you sent us a picture\"\nCustomer \"A picture of what?\"\nMe \"Flowers...Sun flowers to be specific\"\n\nSo I should mention, the only reason he wanted to verify his step-mother as a passenger was because his sister was excepting her first child and he wanted his step-mother and father to see her delivery.\n\nSo because I am having a great time knowing he fucked up harder than I did, I tell him in a very condesending tone. \"Well sir the good news is your deadline isnt for a few more weeks so you have plenty of time to send in documents needed\". He becomes more iriate and begins yelling at me. \"HOW IS THAT GOOD NEWS? SHE IS GOING TO DELIVERY ANY MINUTE AND THEY WILL MISS IT!\"\n\nAgain in a condescending tone I say, \"Well Sir once we get the documentation we will process. Is there anything else I can assist with?\" Without missing a beat, he says; \"No you've been a great help. (Sarcastic AF) Thanks for nothing!\"\n\nThe line goes silent, I have myself on mute to hide my laughter and he says; \"Did you hangup on me you cocksucker?\" I unmute myself and tell him \"I'm still here sir\" but at this point he was to busy yelling at someone else in the background.",

        "text": "So, I was reminded of this story while catching up with a friend from my short stint in a call center working in the Retention department for the Small Business sector of a Major Financial Company.  Training took a few weeks, and I was completely paranoid that I'd be terrible.\n\n\nIn our cubicles, we were all divided into three 'teams' of sorts, which was mostly just a way of differentiating who our Manager was, while also making for a lightly competitive atmosphere.  When I was first put on the floor to sidejack with someone, and then take calls towards the end of the shift, We were in the midst of one such competition.  The goal was simple; See who could uncover the most unused spend.  Basically, they wanted us to find things that our customers weren't using our services for, and explain to them the benefits of paying with those expenses using us.  Pretty straight forward, right?  We were slowly working towards are goal, and It was finally time for my first call.\n\n\nI don't remember all the specifics, but the nice gentleman just wasn't seeing the value of keeping our services, he was a very low-grade account, which was why he had been sent to my queue.  Come to find out, he runs a shipping company.  Primarily using trucks.\n\n\nTrucks that use Gas, which he's been paying for with check and/or reimbursing drivers, because he didn't know A) About our Employee cards and B) the bonus rewards that come from Gas purchases.\n\n\nThe long and the short of it is, this account that was in the low thousands, had between twenty and twenty five thousand dollars, per month, in gas expenses that he hadn't been paying for with us...  In a competition for the first team to find $50,000 of money not being spent with us, My first call stumbled into nearly $300,000.\n\n\nOf course, I didn't win any actual prize for it, but in upper management's eyes, it somehow set the bar higher.  I was held to a higher standard, which lead to more stress.  My first call was a tall order to live up to.\n\n\nIn the end, I don't think I ever topped that call for sheer value.  My calls were minor accounts, and while I always ranked great on surveys for helpfulness and all that, but... Well, Financial companies don't care about that as much as the bottom line.  I never handled an account that big again in my short time there, and eventually the entire program was cut from the company I worked for, so the Financial Institution could handle it all inhouse.",

        "text": "Lets squeeze in two stories today\n\nAirline guy...\n\n\nFirst things first. Most airlines dont assign seats. That means when a flight is available for sale, you pick your seat when you book your flight at your leisure. That means the earlier you book, the more seating options you have available. You wouldnt ask someone to get out of their seat opening night in a packed movie theater if you wanted to sit with your boyfriend would you? Same concept.\n\n\nSo of course theres always a grey area. Such as families traveling with small children. So what airlines do now is they \"hold\" X number of seats, and dont make all seats available to assign before the flight so that in the event that all side by side seats are booked, we can still have seating for families or ppl with disabilities to be placed in certain spots.\n\n\nWell often I have to explain to parents who book flights for the very next day that theres absolutely no more seats left to *PRE-ASSIGN*, and that the airport will have to handle the seating on the day of. Meaning the airport has to assign those blocked seats we have no access to, literally the seats they want are the seats we are holding FOR THEM. And it usually goes like:\n\nM- it appears that the free seats that we have are all booked. But no worries, there are plenty of seats on this flight, they all appear to be held for family seating, so they will seat you guys together tomorrow morning once you arrive at the airport.\n\ncrazy parent - WHY CANT YOU DO IT NOW? THIS IS RIDICULOUS WE ALREADY PURCHASED TICKETS\n\nM- **paraphrases previous statement, with emphasis on \"you will have seats, but we cant take someone out of their seats to put you together today, it will all be handled for you tomorrow\"**\n\ncrazy guy- This is OUTRAGEOUS. So you mean to tell me, you are going to split me from my wife and children, and my child could possibly be sitting in the lap of a complete stranger? IF YOU MAKE SOMEONE ELSE HOLD MY BABY THATS GOING TO BE A BIG PROBLEM FOR YOUR COMPANY\n\n\n(me thinking back to a time where we have required a mother to hand her infant over to a complete stranger because we didnt have side by side seating available because they booked the last 5 seats on a flight scheduled for tomorrow morning)\n\n\n\n**calls another department after disconnecting to ask a really dumb question, acting as if I didnt know the answer, just to get a break from a call that almost made my hair melt**",

        "text": "Hi guys! Me again. This reddit is addicting, isn't it?\n\nI have another story for you guys. So, there is a woman that is literally banned from calling my work. She is literally banned from a government agency. Let that sink in! \n\nStill with me? Good!\n\nThe lady is schizophrenic and thinks the call center has been hacked and her files have been tampered with. In training, they mention her by name. Let's call her Jane Doe. The supervisors get special training on how to deal with her.  If you get her call, you are told to escalate it immediately. \n\nShe's kind of viewed as a right of initiation. She calls a few times a day, even though she's banned. She gets other agencies to transfer her, or borrows people's phone numbers. In any case, I got her last week. I noticed the name pop up but her name is very common, there could be a million Jane Doe's.  I didn't immediately panic and the lady didn't seem too crazy....\n\nFor the first minute.\n\nShe ranted at me for twelve minutes. She mentioned she had a problem, started to explain, and it delved into the government is being hacked, her files are tampered with, no one will help her because she knows the truth and the government is trying to stop her. I'm flipping my shit at this point, all of the supervisors are away or have gone home as it's nearing the end of the day. There's one guy and he's in a meeting, so I send an IM and just say Jane Doe. He has an \"oh shit\" reaction, leaves his meeting, comes to my desk and says I'll take the call.\n\nI haven't said a word to Jane Doe at this point and it's 12 minutes into the call. She finally pauses and goes: \"So, can you help me?\"\n\nAnd I'm like: I'm transferring you to a supervisor.\n\nJane Doe flips her shit and starts screaming in a demonic voice: you're going to the unemployment line! You're only sending me to a supervisor because I know the truth!! \n\nI transferred her while she was still screaming. Lady was scary!\n\nShe's very famous apparently on the internet for doing this sort of thing, has a lot of internet conspiracy blogs about the federal government and believes Obama was born in Kansas or something.",

        "text": "So, I work in a call center for a company that makes touchscreen Point of Sale systems. I'm a Tier 1 rep who fixes the POS systems when they break. Software only, though. If it's a hardware problem, I diagnose it and let another department handle replacing the hardware.\n\nSo, a guy from our biggest client calls in. And by big, I mean if we lost this client, probably 70% of the company's employees  would be laid off because this client accounts for the majority of our revenue. So, generally, we have to be extremely nice to these people. The guy calling in is the owner of one of our client's stores. It's a franchise model.\n\nHis POS isn't working. I won't get into the exact details of what's wrong, but our conversation went about like this, picking up at the troubleshooting part:\n\nMe: Well, the first thing you'd want to do is check the ethernet cable running from your modem to our router. If that cable is unplugged or bad, your system won't work.\n\nHim: No. It can't be that.\n\nMe: Well, if you could check it anyway, I'd appreciate it. We need to check everything.\n\nHim: No, there's no reason to. It can't be that.\n\nOh great. Okay, well, instead of pushing the point, I'm going to assume he's right and it isn't the cable. If nothing else works, I'll go back to the cable.\n\nMe: Well, next, let's check the router we installed. We need to make sure it's powered on and everything that should be plugged in is.\n\nHim: It can't be that. I won't do that.\n\nMe: Um, all right. Well, you should at least power cycle it, as sometimes hardware just need to be rebooted.\n\nHim: No. It can't be that.\n\nMe: Well, we can't really eliminate that possibility until we check it.\n\nHim: No. It's impossible that's it.\n\nOkay. This is getting real frustrating real fast. Let's give it one more shot.\n\nMe: All right. You have a server installed on the wall in the back. It's bolted to the wall in the back of the store. Let's check that and make sure it's turned on.\n\nHim: No. It can't be that.\n\nOH MY GOD. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH THIS PERSON?! He never gave me a reason why he kept saying that and literally every single thing I suggested he check was met with \"It can't be that.\" \n\nFinally, he hung up on me after a few more suggestions that I \"have no idea\" how to troubleshoot.\n\nIt wasn't a bad call so much as an annoying one.",

        "text": "Hiya! Airline guy,\n\nSo in the airline industry we have a concept called \"reprotecting\" which means if a flight is delayed or cancelled and its not weather related, we can sometimes call another airline that we have a contractual agreement with if they have flights to the same origin and destinations.\n\nSo lets say airline A cancelled their flights and have nothing else that day. Airline A can book flights using Airline B's aircraft and schedule but they HAVE to confirm with airline B because if not youre basically putting a flight on hold that hasnt been paid for. The other airline can and will deny the passenger and its really a nightmare for them, but its nothing we would be able to do. Its like asking Target to take a return from Walmart for a broken item. So it is IMPERATIVE that Airline A make sure that the protection is properly done so that someone doesnt show up to Airline B gate with a ticket thinking everything is taken care of. Unfortunately if its not done properly we have to direct the customers back to the airline they booked their original ticket with so that they can properly send over the information that shows they have paid to put THEIR passenger on OUR flight.\n\nAnd thats exactly what happened today. Some guy calls in upset because his nieces ticket is \"cancelled\" and \"we need to do something about this\", keep in mind, our flights arent cancelled, the airline he booked with cancelled and someone didnt do their job over there and sent the guy over to us.\n\n(after hearing a 20 second rant)\nM-absolutely sir can I get your confirmation code?\n\nguy- THEY DIDNT GIVE ME ONE\n\nM- i understand sir, i would need for you to give me something. did _____ not provide you with ANYTHING to bring to us?\n\nguy- look they put her on this flight why cant you find it?\n\nM- there does seem to be a flight at this time, however your niece does not appear to be one of the passengers on the flight. You would need to reconfirm with the carrier that they in fact placed her on our flight, we arent showing and record of a ticket being issued.\n\nguy- look you need to get this straightened out.\n\nM- the only way to fix this is to give them a ring\n\nguy- I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH THEM YOU MEAN I HAVE TO CALL THEM BACK?\n\nM- that is correct\n\nguy- **hangs up**\n\n\nJust in time for me to sign out of the phone.

        "text": "I took reservations at a call center for a hotel for about a year. While I have forgotten many details of calls I wish I'd shared here, this one I will never forget a single word.\n\nOur company has quite a few hotels, and several accommodate conferences. A woman called in, and at first it seemed fine. She was pleasant, had the conference name and the one on the reservation so I could pull it up easily, and she just wanted to be sure her reservation was in our system, since it was made through the conference and not the hotel itself. Thanks to that, I can only see the barest bones of the reservation - don't even have an email to send a confirmation - but even so I was starting to relax when I verified the dates.\n\n**Me:** -and you're booked Friday, September 16th, 2016, for two nights with X Conference.\n\n**Caller:** That's not right.\n\n**Me:** *mentally screaming as I look in the other window to see when the other conference reservations are for.* Let me double-check that for you.\n\n**Caller:** Yes, I need my reservation for September 18th.\n\nNow, I pull up all the information on this conference. It shows that everyone coming into the hotel for this conference is checking in Friday the 16th and checking out on Sunday, the 18th. At bit more digging shows the reduced rate is not supposed to be offered outside of those two nights. Even so, no one - not even our CEO - could change this reservation as the conference made it.\n\n**Me:** Ma'am, I'm seeing that you have the two nights of the conference reserved, the same as everyone else. Everything is fine.\n\n**Caller:** So my reservation is for September 18th?\n\n**Me:** No, ma'am, it's for Friday, September 16th.\n\n**Caller:** I don't want to come in then! I need my reservation for Friday, September 18th!\n\n**Me:** Ma'am, that's not possible; the 18th is a Sunday. The conference will be over then; you have the dates you want.\n\n**Caller:** My reservation should be for Friday the 18th.\n\n**Me:** Ma'am, as I told you, the conference falls on Friday and Saturday, and in September 2016 the Friday you want is on the 16th. Your reservation is correct.\n\nThis goes on for at least thirty seconds to a minute, with her insisting that September 18th, 2016 is a Friday and me, staring a calendar, knowing her to be wrong and trying to slip in suggestions to look at a calendar that won't send her from mildly frustrated to yelling at me. I don't want to try to explain this to a supervisor. Eventually, with my neighbor at this point trying not to laugh at me as she shoots me pity looks:\n\n**Caller:** So it's for Friday the 18th?\n\n**Me:** *My soul ascends to another plane in which I scream.* Sure.\n\n**Caller:** Thank you.\n\n**Me:** If you like, I can send you a confirmation-\n\n**Caller:** *hangs up*\n\nWhich, in all honestly, was probably for the best.",

He was transferred from customer service and he is upset because his card is still declining.\" So I think ok no problem I can help him but why can't you? She then says \"I was trying to help him but he said he wants to speak from someone in the US.\" Now our bank doesn't actually have any staff outside the US but this poor woman had a very slight accent.

We get lawyers, doctor's, Bene's, and insurers calling in constantly. It's a high volume call center and very stressful. \n\nToday I had a terrible day. This woman, who I knew would be terrible just by looking in the notes from a previous employer, was belligerent and rude. The short version of it is I informed her she had to call an insurance company to get the date they dropped her from the insurance. We had already sent a letter to the insurance company, which was ignored as they usually are.\n\nShe didn't like that, informed me that my coworker said the letter would fix everything, and then started screaming at me. Then she insisted I was screaming at her, demanded a supervisor, then filed a complaint against me. Because I didn't tell her what she wanted.\n\nWhat's fucked up is our supervisors tell us before we transfer we have to advise the caller, no matter how abusive they are, that the supervisor will tell them the same thing. Which makes them angrier. \n\nWhat made matters worse is the lady was loudly talking shit about me while I tried to flag down a supervisor. It just amuses me that this lady tried so hard to get me fired she literally made up shit.\n\nJoke is on her though, the call is recorded!",

        "text": "First time bla bla bla. \n\nSo I work as L1 tech support for a company that operates several call centers. My colleagues are a couple of other L1 and L2 guys and our manager (L3). This tale takes place today.\n\n- Operational manager for one of the call centers\"$opman\". Handles business from our side with the customer.\n- Call center sort of \"senior\" supervisor \"$ssup\". A mid 50s lovely guy. \n- Yours truly \"$me\"\n- My boss \"$L3\"\n- A very popular franchise restaurant call center \"$tasty\"\n\nNow, keep in mind that $ssup is not completely tech-illiterate, or that's how I imagined him to be. Alas, layer 8 will always be layer 8. \n\nSo I was sitting at my desk finishing some things and I get an email, followed directly by a call from $opman telling me they have a major problem: the call center is down, no inbound or outbound calls are going through! Now, this guy is always precise with his words so \"down\" meant they were actually down, which means they were not taking calls, the customer is gonna get very angry every passing minute, $opman's ass is on the line and the clock is ticking!\n\nI immediately stand up and go directly to $L3's office as the situation is very urgent and it would be best to be communicated in person while at the same time dialing $tasty's IVR and trying to reach an agent. I enter his office and find an L2 friend and colleague sitting down with him so I tell them both: gents, $tasty is down. At the same moment, I hear \"Hello, this is $agent, what would you like to order today ?\" so I tell the agent I'm calling to test the system and ask her if she can hear me clearly, to which she says yes I can hear you very well so I thank her and hang up. $L3 looks at me and says \"well, looks like it's not down after all, go to them and see what's up. $L2 and I will monitor the system from here\". \n\nRelieved that $tasty was not actually down, I take a stroll to $opman's office (another building). I meet him and assure him that I was just on the phone with an agent, $tasty is not actually down. He tells me that the original email came from $ssup and he just took a quick look at it and then forwarded it to us. I go to the actual call center (different floor) to meet $ssup to understand what the hell was going on. The agents tell me he was finishing something and will be back shortly so I sit down and wait for him. A couple of minutes later, $ssup comes over and we have this chat:\n\n- $me: could you explain to me what the problem actually is ?\n- $ssup: well, I can't make outbound calls. \n- $me: okay, let's make a test call to troubleshoot this\n\nI dial my mobile number and sure enough, my phone rings (thank god, this means outbound dialing was working fine), I pick up and give him the phone while I try to talk to him from his PC.\n\n- $me: Hello, can you hear me ?\n- $ssup: Yes, but can you hear me ? \n- $me: No, I can't hear you from the headset. \n\nI notice that there was no sound whatsoever from the headset so as any sane tech support pro, I trace the problem to the first probable cause: is the PC sound muted ? It was indeed muted, I turn it up and $ssup and I confirm that we can actually hear each other just fine now. \n\nI explain to the guy what was wrong and how to solve this \"issue\" next time and go back to my desk while thinking deeply about the meaning of life. \n\nA user had his PC sound muted so the whole call center was suddenly \"down\". Another day at the front, eh ?   ",

I told you I set it up.\n\nMe: No that is our other app, you need to type in and download the \"Safe driving discount” app.\n\nDL: But I can’t find that app?\n\nI go over the same steps again and eventually she downloads the right app. I also go over the “forgot username and pw” link steps and she gets her login.\n\n\nThank god at this point she said she thinks she can do the rest and if she has any problems she’ll call back. but fuck these are the times I contemplate leaving the call center life.",

        "text": "So like most modern call centers my company has a way to queue your hold time and give you a ring back so you don't have to wait. Well, for better or for worse customers call multiple times and request multiple callbacks...and our system will actually call you back as many times as you request a callback...\n\n\nSo when we get the call our CTI states that it's a callback and yet the customers usually go \"thanks for the callback I've already got it taken care of\" they're happy, it appears that we are concerned for them, I have a 20 second call averaged in to my metrics which is great puts a smile on both of our faces. Until:\n\nM-hi this is pain how can I assist?\n\nL- I don't know\n\nM-have we reached you already? Is there something else I can help you with?\n\nL-I don't know you already called once\n\nM-I apologize we are returning your call request is there nothing else that you would like to do with me today?\n\nL-I DONT KNOW YOURE CALLING ME BACK\n\nM-I understand, well give us a call back if you do need assistance we are 24 hours!\n\nL- *sigh* ((hangs up))",

        "text": "So throwing this one out while it's still fresh.\n\nI alternate between emails and inbound calls at my center. I took an email that required me to outbound call the customer. Customer started an account with us in last year. At the same time he signed up for automatic payments. He apparently forgot because we were getting checks from him mailed in each month. That's fine because our system recognizes this and stops the auto draft when this happens before the due date. This happened every month. This month however the check was late. So auto draft activates and he gets his bill deducted and we of course cash his check when it comes in. \n\nWhen I explain this to the customer he starts yelling that (1) he was never on auto draft, we need to cancel this, refund the double pay ASAP, etc and (2) we are going to compensate him for the 2 checks he bounced because the double pay over drafted him.\n\nI kindly inform him that we will cancel the auto draft and refund the excess payment (even expedited which we don't always do). However we will not be compensating him for anything else since there was no error on our part. Customer flips out and starts threatening legal action and accusing us of fraud etc. He demands my name and gets even madder when I won't give him my last name (because you know... I'm not an idiot). Customer is just ranting so I give him the \"any other questions ?\" Response and hang up as soon as he says no.\n\nTLDR; not our fault, not our problem.",

        "text": "Bibo back with another story from an auto insurance call center.\n\nOne of the big things that gets stressed in training in becoming an insurance sales rep is to avoid using the term \"full coverage.\" It's a term that gets tossed around a lot when it comes to buying a car, and we are not supposed to use it directly when building an insurance policy with a customer because it can be misleading when people because people can end up thinking they have more coverage than they really do. Ask yourself, does full coverage mean you will get a free rental car if your car is damaged? I certainly don't know, and neither does anyone else for sure.\n\nOne really annoying part of this is that when you buy a car, often the dealer and financing company will actually tell you, \"You are required to have full coverage for this loan\" which makes our job an absolute nightmare sometimes because people want a direct answer from us if their coverage meets their financing company's minimum criteria to drive the car they want to buy when we have absolutely no control over what they require e.g. the maximum deductibles.\n\nNow, what most financing companies mean when they say \"full coverage\" is that you need to have \"Collision\" coverage to pay for the damage to your car if you get into a wreck even if it is your fault, and \"Comprehensive\" coverage to pay for damage to your car from basically anything else like weather, theft, animals, etc..., in addition to state-mandated liability coverage which pays for damage you cause to others.\n\nSo cue Bane of My Existence, or BME. He is calling me from the dealership, which is a terrible experience half the time because usually people calling from the dealer: 1) Have been there for many hours and want to go home, 2) Are frustrated because they ended up spending a lot more than they planned to on the car they bought and, thus, *always* get mad when they need to pay for the insurance too, and 3) Are impatient as all hell and uncooperative as a result, not wanting to answer questions, etc... \n\nAfter I do start the process of adding his new car to his policy:\n\n&gt;Me: BME, now that I have taken down the vehicle information, I need to go over your coverages, allow me to explain what coverages we offer... *And so I explain in excruciating detail how comprehensive and collision coverages are what most financing companies require and the way ALL the auto insurance coverages work*\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Me:Okay BME, now that I have explained the liability, comprehensive, and collision coverages to you, I assume that since you are financing your car, your lienholder has some requirements about coverage and probably a limit on your deductibles is that right?\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;BME: Yes, I also need to have full coverage. The financing company says I need that.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Me: Right, remember, like I said earlier, full coverage does not have an exact meaning so I need to clarify what exactly they want you to have, what they usually mean is-\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;BME: Right, full coverage they said.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Me: *Kill me please.* Right, full coverage isn't really an actual coverage, it's a phrase people use to talk about a variety of coverages so I need to understand what they need you to have.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;BME: Oh okay. *Chatters in the background to some guy at the dealership.* Yes, they said I need to have full coverage please.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Me: Sir, as I have said a few times, I do not know what they mean when you say full coverage, does that mean they need you to have medical payments coverage? Do they need you to have uninsured motorist coverage? Or do they just mean you need to have comprehensive and collision?\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;BME: Look, I don't know why this is taking so long, I just want to have the lowest full coverage you have so I can take the car off the lot...\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Me: (*What the hell does that even mean? Lowest full coverage???*) Look sir, for legal reasons I am unable to tell you if your policy has 'full coverage' or not, it does not have an exact definition, it means different things to different people. I do not know if this is enough to satisfy your lienholder, only they know what they require. Please, you are there with them, ask someone if they mean comprehensive and collision when they say 'full coverage.'\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;BME: **Loud-ass sigh.** Fine, hold on.... *More chatter.* Yes they said that's fine, as long as it's full coverage.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point I wanted to bang my head into a wall I was so done with this call.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Me: Sir, as I have explained to you multiple times tonight. I. CANNOT. TELL YOU. If this is full coverage. If you are happy with this coverage, I will get this change submitted so I can send you your proof of insurance.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;BME: Okay finally, just send me the documents that is what I was waiting for.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Me: *YES THANK GOD* Okay sir I have submitted the change and sent the documents to your dealer.\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt;BME: Okay thank you, took you long enough. Now, to be clear this is full coverage right?",

        "text": "Hey all :) \n\nSo I work in banking, for personal loans. I pick up an application and call this dude because we were requiring documents to verify his income. \n\nFirst he picks up the phone so happily thinking he is about to get his $$$. HE then tells me to call him back cause he is busy. \n\nUGH SIGH. Normally we don't do call backs, but I was nice and newer to the job so I did it. Not sure why they want our day to be rearranged around when they can talk on the phone but whatever.\n\nCall this crazy dude and this is how it goes. \nCM - crazy man M - me\n\n&gt;**M** - Hi sir. My name is _____. And I am just calling in regards to your lending application. I can see that we are still just trying to verify your self employed income and we are requiring your tax return. When are you able to send this through to us so we can proceed with your application?\n\n&gt;**CM** - well I shouldn't have to give you any documents, you should trust me enough as i have been a customer for x amount of years. \n\n&gt;**M** - I understand sir. Unfortunately as per our policy we  do require this documentation to go ahead with this application. I definitely believe you are making *this* much per year. However we do need the tax return. \n\n*i do not get why they harass the front-line employee who has no control over this and is just doing what they have to do so they don't get fired.*\n\n&gt;**CM** - well all my business accounts are there and this bank can see all my banking. \n\n&gt;**M**- sir as I said we cant verify like this because it isnt accurate, we need to see this by an accountant. \n\nSir flips out and was just ranting and wouldnt  let me get one word in. He wouldnt stop his rant so i can even say something. At some point I proceed to talk a little louder to talk on top of him so I can get a word in and wrap up the conversation. but he proceeds to talk substantially louder so I cant even speak at all. \n\nNow, when this took place, there were recent legislative changes by the government in regards to banking and lending. All applications **need** to go through verification. In the past, if a customer was a long time account holder, or if their credit report was good, we wouldn't need to verify. But this changed sometime before I had this interaction. Of course this is all they told us, and from then on we needed to ask customers for documents. \n\n&gt;**M** - I understand sir, however new legislation requires us to verify your income. \n\n&gt;**CM** - I don't believe you, you're lying. Show me the part of the law where it says this. \n\n&gt;**M** - I can assure you I am not lying about this. It is also our policy. \n\n&gt;**CM**- I want to speak to the manager because they can make decisions you cant. \n\nAt this point I completely stopped trying to get him to cooperate and trying to diffuse.\nI look around for the manager, but surprise, surprise they are not there and they haven't left another manager in charge. Typical mismanagement. \n\n&gt;**M** - Sir there is no manager here right now, but I can let them know to give you a call back when they are back. However, they will just tell you the exact same thing I have told you. \n\n&gt;**CM** - well then i am just going to call back and complain. \n\n&gt;**M** - ok sir, that's your right. \n\nWe both say bye and then I proceed to take 10 mins away from my desk. \n\nEnded up forwarding the situation to another manager, who didn't call him back LOL. I had this as a small victory because we werent accommodating to his tantrums.  \n\n**TL;DR** crazy customer wants a loan and doesn't want to provide any documents. Is rude and condescending. Manager snubs calling him back also. Crazy man left empty handed.",
