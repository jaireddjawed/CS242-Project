        "text": "Thought I'd post this in case anyone was wondering how residency funding worked depending on which prelim or TY year you do.\n\nYou have something called an **IRP** which is your initial residency period which is **how many years it takes of training to become board eligible**. This is set once you match into a program, prelim, categorical whatever. **The IRP is what is used to determine how many years of medicare funding you receive.**\n\nFor categorical programs, this is fairly straight forward. The years of funding you get equals the years of training. Ex for pediatrics. 3 year program, 3 years of funding.\n\nIf you match into a prelim + advanced position, again fairly straightforward, your IRP is set to however many years it takes to complete the track. Ex for dermatology 1 year prelim + 3 years residency = 4 year track = 4 years of funding.\n\nWhere it gets a little complicated is when you only match into a prelim or start trying to transfer programs.\n\nIf you match into IM and later decide to go into general surgery after your first IM year, there's a problem. You only received 3 years of IM funding and you've already exhausted 1 year. Since GS is a 5 year residency, and you now only have 2 years of funding left, any program that takes you needs to come up with the difference of 3 years of funding.\n\nIt gets even more complicated depending on if you match only prelim. If you only match into a clinical base year (prelim program) your years of funding are tied to which type of prelim it is. For IM, this is 3. For general surgery, this is 5. So if you do a IM prelim and try to move into say, general surgery, this is a problem since you will be short 2 years of funding.\n\n**However,** this limitation does NOT apply to transitional year programs. If you match into a TY year ONLY, your residency funding is dependent on which residency you enter your second year of training. I.e if you do a TY year and then go into surgery, you receive 5 years of funding with your TY year being your first IRP year. If you go into dermatology, you receive 4 years of funding instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou can read more about it in the summary here: [https://aamc-black.global.ssl.fastly.net/production/media/filer\\_public/64/77/6477adae-c4c6-4e0e-8c6f-adcdabf2bdec/dgme\\_-\\_medicare\\_gme\\_payments\\_what\\_you\\_need\\_to\\_know\\_-\\_20190430.pdf](https://aamc-black.global.ssl.fastly.net/production/media/filer_public/64/77/6477adae-c4c6-4e0e-8c6f-adcdabf2bdec/dgme_-_medicare_gme_payments_what_you_need_to_know_-_20190430.pdf)\n\nThe section directly pertaining to IRP and programs that require a prelim (broad based clinical year) are here: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/42/413.79](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/42/413.79)",

He would not be the last. \nAfter the initial phosphorylation, glucose 6 phosphate became fructose-6 phosphate. \nThe change was subtle, but quick and relentless. \nPhosphoglucose isomerase would be the next. He isomerizes her - and for the first time one of her phosphates leaves the now 5 carbon ring but she is still fructose 6 phosphate. \nPhosphofrutokinase would be next- attracted to her new double phosphate groups he phosphoylates her just as hexokinase did and the subtle changes become more apparent.\nShe is then cleaved to isomers of herself by her 4th lover Adolase: he leaves her in two as dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate. \nThis is when she became known as GAP. \nSoon, her new isomer DHAP is approached by Triosephosphate who isomerizes the DHAP and converts her to GAP because DHAP just ain’t GAP.\nBut he too would leave, and would soon be replaced by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, also known as NAD. NAD is a very popular electron carrier and made his intentions clear at the door- he was here to oxidize the girls and leave. \nThe girls seek structure and support this time and that’s exactly what they find in wingman glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase, who phosphorylates them and holds them in place as NAD quickly yanks a hydrogen from each of the girls as a final oxidation. \nThey have been played twice by 6 and are now 2 molecules of 1,3 biphoglycerate, and - separately of course- NADH and his extra hydrogen atom. Phosphoglycerate kinase is a man with motion and works quickly to transfer the girls phosphate groups from their 3rd carbon to their second, in an act of manliness unlike they’d ever seen. \nHe would leave the girls as two 2-phosphoglycerate molecules. \nConfident they would find another, the girls move on to court Enolase who dehydrates them leaving them as  2 phosphoenolpyruvic acids or PEPs. \nPrepared to end the glycolic loop, the two PEP molecules have a final encounter with Pyruvate kinase who transfers their remaining phosphate to ADP leaving them as two pyruvic acids and two ATPs.",

        "text": "Hi everyone, I'm an 2nd year osteopathic medical student asking for your advice about applying for 3rd year rotations. Unfortunately, our school does not have an official affiliated hospital, but they did find core rotations for us (FM, PEDS, IM, OB/GYN, SURG, PSYCH). I will be completing them in this order: IM, elective, psychiatry, elective, elective, FM, SURG, OB/GYN, PEDS, elective. We have to find 4 four-week-long electives by ourselves. This can be either through VSLO or by contacting hospitals/clinics and have them sign an affiliation agreement.\n\n**Background info**: mainly interested in EM after working and shadowing in the ER. I also want to try rotating in sports medicine and PM&amp;R.\n\n**My current plan:** do 1 EM rotation 3rd year and 2 EM rotations 4th year. One would be at an academic hospital I worked at and know the PD *(don't like the location at all, but wouldn't be the end of the world :/ )*, one at another academic hospital where the PD is from my school *(good location)*, and one across the country in the state I eventually want to live in!\n\n**Q's:**\n\n1. Should I be selecting these 3rd year rotations at private practices, community hospitals, or academic hospitals with residencies that I would like to apply to in the future? Does rotating at a small outpatient clinic say for PM&amp;R hurt my application chances? (I know that it is definitely recommended for 4th year rotations/Sub-I's to be at hospitals with residencies.)\n2. Is 3 EM rotations too much or just right?\n3. I have heard the EM residency applications are earlier compared to other specialities. Should I  complete multiple EM rotations in my 3rd year so I don't rely on 4th year for my LOR's/evals?\n4. Will my lack of knowledge/skill during my 1st EM rotation (or any specialty for that matter) as a 3rd year hinder my application to that residency in the future? If yes, should I keep the rotation I want to do across the country as my 4th year rotation?\n\n**Tl;dr** I want to do multiple EM rotations, where should I do them and when?\n\nThanks so much in advance! Our school does a poor job of preparing us for this process so I appreciate any advice.",

I have done fine on rotations so far. However I don't have ECs or anything really to put on my app. I have a small publication before med school and thats about it. I have had 2 very limited leadership positions. I spent a majority of med school just stressing over passing my classes and surviving. No one in my immediate or extended family went to school period so I literally feel like I don't know what I am doing. I love family med but am worried it will burn me out. I also love psych because I felt like even though the patients were obviously hard to interview at times I felt like I could talk to them all day and I actually felt somewhat useful. I am sitting in front of my computer signing up for auditions and also setting up rotations for 4th year feeling like a sad loser.",

        "text": "I must have promised this ages ago but here it is. First and foremost, my heart goes out to all of you who are in the SOAP. Please be willing to ask for help, take advice, and know that you are worth it. To those who matched, congrats and I look forward to your own name and shame experiences down the line. \n\nI have been chewing on this post for years and I’m ready for an ungodly level of catharsis to unfold. Now let’s be clear, I could name my particular program, but they’re really all the same. All the same corporate greed and shill and spite that you would expect, so why even bother. DM and I’ll tell you, but for the sake of the public good they all deserve to suffer for the patients they fuck over and every resident who has suffered at their hands. \n\nDisclaimer: my faculty was amazing. None of this should reflect on the people who taught me how to do what I do. I couldn’t be more grateful for their expertise and knowledge. This is a big fat FUCK YOU to all of HCA as a corporation and literal hell on earth.\n\nThe good: food, faculty, and coresidents. \n\nSo let’s start. I was a naive happy to match anywhere EM applicant. Mine was middle of my list. My only hope was to not match at HCA and there I was. I came in with an open mind thinking oh this won’t be so bad. I can do this. It’ll be fine. I really did have the highest of hopes for the match. I believe that anybody could go anywhere and be everything that they needed to be because I believed that that was the whole point of the residency system.\n\nSo imagine my first fucking day and there’s not enough nurses to do anything. Turns out they all left for the higher paying places in the United States. Florida is a competitive market for other hospitals, but apparently HCA can’t pull one fucking penny out to hire one more nurse. It’s sad to describe how much my first second and third year of residency were spent doing nursing tasks. They official word from the higher-ups was fuck you in a sense. Mind you at the same time we’re all being paid an unlivable salary nobody’s able to eat and we had co residents driving for Uber just to pay bills.\n\nAll anyone cares about at any management level is making money. They don’t care if anyone dies. If anyone has to walk home with a broken leg. As long as you put an order in within 10 minutes and discharge them in 3 you’re golden. They don’t even pay the voucher they just send you the bill for it. \n\nNow on the topic of money, this is where things get hit and heavy. I was ready to be a whistleblower on this topic but there’s no way HCA would have ever let me collect the evidence. When I started HCA not only was opening an operating an unsafe level of residencies, but trauma centers. So to qualify, I believe you need so many cases and you have to meet certain outcomes. There’s no limit on what you can charge for it though. So what does HCA do? The make it a trauma center and choose to set the absolute lowest bar possible to be considered a trauma patient. Guess who is the perfect target for Medicare fraud? Apparently is 65+ Medicare patients on Coumadin. There must be 10 of these a day, and while it should be taken seriously, it’s not worth the 20 fucking grand they charge for the activation (by comparison it’s 5700 bucks at the county, I checked). It’s embarrassing as an emergency medicine doctor to have their totally manageable head injury patient fat fingered by trauma at a no name second rate hca hospital. And if that wasn’t enough, they included ALL head injuries as criteria regardless of a/c status. Do you have any idea how many old people fall and get a boo-boo? Thanks for the 20k I guess. They included “proximal long bone” injuries including hips and femurs. Like seriously a whole fucking trauma activation for a hip or a FUCKING HUMERUS. GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE. Some of us tried to refuse this nonsense and were met with bullying from admin. HCA was blatantly committing fraud against Medicare recipients.\n\nSo as I was allowing HCA to commit fraud, me and all the cohort of Florida hca residents we busy being paid shit. Literally the next to lowest paid of the area. Maybe we work less? Wrong. Hca universally staffs more residents, less attendings, and more hours than anybody else in the adjacent states. Nothing like wanting to kill yourself (please don’t) on shift because all you did was sleep and eat between your 20 12hr days of work. \n\nSick time? Forget it. You’re too valuable to lose. \nVacation? Sure but you can’t use a single day go to the doctor. Plan for it in 6 months. \nThe food is free right? I probably have cancer from the sawdust they feed us. \nWant to match a good group of residents? Sorry can’t do that because hca has “standards” that preclude otherwise excellent candidates based on scores. Nothing like being metric focused amiright?\n\nAnybody here try and transfer someone from an HCA hospital?\nI’ve literally watched an admin yell at my favorite attending for transferring a patient to the university because they would die without it. They want HCA transfers only so they don’t lose on that sweet sweet admission cash cow (Oh which by the way they say to admit everyone you can so they can make dolla dolla bills yo). Yeah that patient died because the admin refused the transfer out to a hospital 5 miles away because of money. They don’t give a single flying fuck. \n\nHCA doesn’t care about you as a resident, or our nurse friends, or our techs, or our patients. All they see are dollar bills and a new boat. I swear to God once I leave this place I’ll never step foot in another hospital. If you have name and shame specific info for HCA, post it, or dm and I’ll share the info. \n\nThanks for listening. I could literally rant about it forever. \n\nOh and HCA, FUCK YOU you sandbagging mother fuckers you’re everything that’s wrong with healthcare. \n\nPeace.",

        "text": " \n\nFellow people of Reddit,\n\nI am a first year student in a healthcare program and I am struggling my butt off. Basically, going forward, I need an 80+ on all my finals or else I'm on the chopping block. I have 2 months of time before finals hit. I am struggling the most with A&amp;P, ocular diseases (ophtho bros pls help, basically treatments and how things present, less so patho for this course) and neuroanatomy. Are there extra resources or study materials that you recommend? Most of these finals are non cumulative so I am essentially starting fresh from now until the final.\n\nBesides Anki, is there anything else that you recommend I do? I think my biggest downfall was shifting Anki and fully relying on it to study. I made decks of over 200-300 cards per lecture trying to memorize everything (and not being able to figure out what is important or not) and that did not turn out very well. Not only could I not stay consistent because of the high amount of cards, I lost the bigger picture of processes and had a hard time piecing things together.\n\nWhat are your methods for learning material presented at school? What else should I be doing? What is your approach to learning longer processes?\n\nI have access to Sketchy and have recently added it to my rotation of resources. How do you typically use Sketchy? Do you make flash cards? Take notes? Just watch?\n\nMore importantly, how do you approach your different courses? What do you do for different courses specifically?\n\nHow do I know if I am understanding a topic when it is very hard to find practice problems for stuff in my field (optometry specifically, if anyone has any insight, please send them my way!)?\n\nI assume you're wondering why some rando optom student is in med school subreddit. Well, we both learn the same basic stuff in first year but you guys have it much harder than I do content wise (depth and amount), so I thought I would try to figure out what works for you guys and implement it for myself.\n\nI apologize for this mess of a post. I am really freaked out and have invested quite a bit of money and time to get here so watching my dreams possibly crumble around me is not easy. I really hope you fine people have some insight for me on what I can do to improve and how to approach the rest of this semester.\n\nThank you!",

Namely, I am aware that its good to use for Step 1, but how does one study a pre-made Anki deck for step 1 while studying material for classes at the same time?\n\nI've heard some say that decks like Anking cover a good portion of class material. If so, in the future, could I theoretically just use one comprehensive premade deck like this one for BOTH usmle and classes? \n\nAlso, if I was to use one comprehensive deck for both, how do I ensure that I practice the right material at the time? In simpler terms, are the decks divided into subcategories so that I can make sure I'm studying what I learned in class and not something I dont have knowledge in yet?\n\nI'm just overall really curious as to how this works. For people that make their own anki cards for class and study usmle seperately, how do you manage to study for both usmle and classes simultaneously with 2 decks?\n\nI apologize if these questions seem trivial, I'm new to all of this and am many years away from my medical school matriculation",
