My partner works for a company that produces both pet and agricultural products and had thought pellet litter would be a great use of their excess chaff after cleaning seed. However, they quickly found out that that the standards for making pellets for litter are significantly higher in terms of what kinds of products can go into them, and the requirements for toxicity testing. Which is good, it's designed to keep animals from being in contact with pesticides or fungicides that are present in a lot of agricultural waste and which could be harmful to animals (and people for that matter.) \n\nWood pellet composition isn't heavily regulated in the US (Europe has their own standards) and they aren't required to meet the same kinds of health and safety standards as pet products. They're usually made of industrial, construction, and agricultural wastes without as much concern for what treatments may be present because it's not meant to be in contact with humans or pets. \n\nMy suggestion is to read the labels very carefully for any toxicity and health information and ask your supplier about the composition of the pellets, as it varies from region to region. A sick pet is more expensive than any litter and make a judgement call. \n\nI just figured I'd put it out there that there can be differences between the two products in terms of manufacture and what goes into them, not just in price.",

To be honest, I am not sure if the tabs actually is falling out of the valve in the right time or if it randomly falls out when I open the dishwasher, so I am not sure if the problem is that the tabs does not fall out on time or if the water was not hot enough / reaching the tabs after it falls out of the valve. The machine is older than 5 years.\n\nTo be honest, I am not so handy when it comes to things like this, so I have tried to do some troubleshooting myself, but can't really seem to see what the issue is, so I am hoping maybe someone more experienced here will be able to help me. As I am a student, replacing a dishwasher is a huge expense I cannot afford at the moment.\n\nHere is an illustration of how my dishwasher looks like (more or less very close to it). It has 3 spray arms as illustrated here: [https://www.samsung.com/in/support/home-appliances/cleaning-spray-arms-of-samsung-dishwasher/](https://www.samsung.com/in/support/home-appliances/cleaning-spray-arms-of-samsung-dishwasher/)\n\nHow can I check if the spray arms is clogged by something that is not visible in the holes?\n\nHow can I check if the spray arms is outputting enough water when it receives water? Should it spray like crazy when it receives water? Is there a way I can test this?\n\nHow can I check if the dishwasher is receiving enough water?\n\nHow can I check if the machine has warm enough water?\n\nIs there anything beside what's mentioned that I should check in order to figure out what the problem is and how I can fix it?",

To be transparent, in Boston, we're talking up to $100/hour.\n\nBut it worked. I worked out consistently all summer. I've never felt that mentally and physically good in my life. I was thriving.\n\nIt got cold and life happened and I had other expenses that needed priority so I eventually fell out of working out and stopped my personal training.\n\nI havent felt that good sense, its been a slow return to depression.\n\nNow that the weather is getting nice again I want to start again but am intimidated to get back into the gym and am again struggling with accountability and where to start.\n\nI can 'swing' it, but I really should be saving it. But... being in a good mental and physical space will help me feel better and influence other areas of my life for the better so I feel its worth it but want to see what you all think, am I crazy? A class once a week so it would be like a $300-$400 investment for a month or two. Maybe one will suffice.\n\nI would only do it for a month or two to get comfortable then continue on my own. because money.",
