The two farms seized by the government were reportedly the first two farms on this supposed list. The South African government denies knowledge of such a list existing.\n\n*edited to fix link*",

As the New York Times describes:](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/nyregion/michael-cohen-plea-deal-trump.html?smid=fb-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur)\n\n&gt;Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former fixer, made the extraordinary admission in court on Tuesday that Mr. Trump had directed him to arrange payments to two women during the 2016 campaign to keep them from speaking publicly about affairs they said they had with Mr. Trump.\n\n&gt;Mr. Cohen acknowledged the illegal payments while pleading guilty to breaking campaign finance laws and other charges. He told a judge in United States District Court in Manhattan that the payments to the women were made “in coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office.”\n\n\n\nI was wondering how this compares to past campaign finance issues Presidents and candidates have had.  In particular, I found [this article](https://www.politico.com/story/2013/01/obama-2008-campaign-fined-375000-085784) and [this article](https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/01/07/obama-campaign-fined-big-for-hiding-donors-keeping-illegal-donations) about excess donations to the Obama campaign in 2012, and wanted to know what was similar or different about that case, or other past cases like this?\n\n\n*Thanks for participating.*\n",

My question really applies to both, as the overall effort appears tied to improving incentives of US business and gov't structure to reduce negative impacts to the public by bad actors.",

Gerrymandering leads to lovely looking congressional maps, such as [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois%27s_4th_congressional_district) in Chicago.\n\nI'm interested in the reasons why someone, regardless of political viewpoint, would be for or against this practice.

        "text": "Hi Y'all!  \n\n\nI'm curious about where to pull credible data for the allocation of government funds to the event that I have access too. I've wanted to see an estimate of the efficiency of the use of each system if they have one, I think a common rule of thumb in private sector is that we're about 40% efficient (meaning pure uninterrupted work without need to learn new material). It's hard to list all the data I want to see with how everything is broken down including projections and accounting for variables but I'll try real quick.  \n\n\nI was hoping to see how the funds have been allocated year after year. How the recipient industry or organizations / programs have changed over time as a result of government involvement. I get real confused when they talk about economic decisions like it's a simple solution when I imagine it to be quite a difficult and tricky topic.  \n\n\nThe company I work for for example has tons of military departments as well and the research funds incentivize the development of new technology and business risks, this creates job opportunities. That technology is eventually modified as well to have uses in the general population. As such I'm curious and a little skeptical about the claims of simply moving funds around without analyzing it myself and how it's broken down and the potential / projected impacts that would have. (i.e. - cutting military budget: would it have a non-negligible impact on private industry jobs, research, economy, and would the resultant recipient offset the impact)?  \n\n\nSo if y'all know a good place to find these charts or if someone has already gone over the data and not just military but in regards to taxes and economic strategies and policies etc... I would greatly appreciate it.  \nThank you!",
