        "text": "As a Pittsburgh resident, and transportation user, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/103yaif/considering_these_shocking_statistics_for/) was rather shocking. Thanks for all the conversation about how to make public transportation better! \n\n**The presented data:** \"The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Pittsburgh, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 73 min. 23% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 17 minutes, while 33% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 3.9 mi (6.3 km), while 11% travel for over 7.5 mi (12 km) in a single direction. \"\n\nI found the source: a [Wikipedia snippet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh#Public_transportation_statistics) from the main Pittsburgh page. The external source links to a Moovit report from 2017. I wasn't able to find that report from 2017, but Moovit does have updated 2020 and 2022 data: [https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit\\_Insights\\_Public\\_Transit\\_Index-countries](https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index-countries) (not mobile friendly). You can see the 10 cities/metro regions listed for the United States by filtering. (Seattle, Miami, NY/NJ, Chicago, Bay Area, Washington DC/Baltimore, Boston and Philadelphia.) \n\nCompared to the other cities, Pittsburgh is definitely the odd-one-out in terms of population. In terms of density, it may be similar to some of them (with about 5000 people per square mile). But all the other cities have seen consistent population growth. Pittsburgh lost half of its population over the course of the last few decades. The metro area had its first growth in population this past year. \n\n**2022 Data for Pittsburgh** (according to this survey - I did not do dive into the validity of their results.) :\n\n* Average commute time on public transit (to or from work) including walk, wait and travel times: 45 minutes\n* Percentage of people with a commute trip (one way) of 2 hours or longer. This includes walk, wait and travel times: 4.5% \n* Medium commute trip (1-2 hours): 8.9%\n* Short commute trip (up to 30 minutes): 26.44%\n* Average wait time: 16 minutes\n* Percentage of people who wait an average of less than 5 minutes: 21.23%\n* Percentage of people who wait an average of 20 minutes: 20.55%\n* How far people walk on average on a one-way commute: 0.25 miles\n* Average distance (km) a person travels one way: 5.47 km\n* Percentage of people who travel more than 7.5 miles: 10.7%\n\netc.\n\nYou can see the 2019 data highlighted in [this City Paper report](https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/pittsburgh-likely-has-shortest-public-transit-commutes-in-us-but-transfers-increased-during-pandemic/Content?oid=18808514#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20Pittsburghers%20walked%20an,associated%20with%20their%20transit%20commutes) based on the Moovit information. You can also see Bike PGH's analysis (2022)over the trend of working form home and how it has effected walking, bike, public transit and single-occupancy car trips [here](https://bikepgh.org/2022/11/22/despite-drops-due-to-remote-work-pittsburgh-still-a-leader-in-walk-bike-transit-commuting/). \n\n**Original claims:** \n\n* \"The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Pittsburgh, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 73 min\": **Out or Date (for the worse)** The current 2022 report gives 1 way data. If we are to assume 45 minutes both ways, this would be 90 minutes. \n* \"23% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day.\": **Out of Date/Incorrect** If we are to add up the two groups that have commute times over 1 hour (4.5% and 8.9%), we get 13.4%. \n* \"The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 17 minutes, while 33% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day.\": **Out of Date/Incorrect** Yes, the average wait is 16 minutes but only 20% wait an average of 20 minutes. \n* \"The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 3.9 mi (6.3 km).\" **Out of Date/Incorrect** This average is now 5.47 km. \n* \"11% travel for over 7.5 mi (12 km) in a single direction. \" **Correct** There has been a slight change at 10.7%\n\n**While some of the data was misleading, most of it was slightly out of date or very similar to 2022 data points.** I'm not going to go into a detailed analysis of this. I'm sure there are a tone of interesting conclusions we could come to. \n\n What is more interesting than the bare data, is how Pittsburgh compares to the other cities on this list. Out of context the original claims were seemingly outrageous; insinuating that there is a serious problem happening in Pittsburgh that none of us knew about! How could Pittsburgh's public transit gotten so bad! \n\nWhat the data really shows us is that Pittsburgh has a comparable public transit system to the other cities profiled.  Perhaps we should be just as alarmed if we wrote the post as: \n\n*\"The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Chicago, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 114 min. 32.89% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 19 minutes, while 33.78% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 5.87mi (9.44 km), while 23% travel for over 7.5 mi (12 km) in a single direction. \"* \n\nMaybe its really public transit in the US that we should be horrified at.\n\n(This post brought to you by the CFB Championship.

        "text": "One of the arguments for why we should make our cities denser, more walkable, more transit-oriented, etc is because of its effect on public health. More specifically, its effect on things like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. There are a multitude of studies of how walkability in a neighborhood is correlated with less obesity and diabetes like the one mentioned in this article: [https://www.endocrine.org/news-and-advocacy/news-room/2022/walkable-neighborhoods-can-reduce-prevalence-of-obesity-diabetes#:\\~:text=Walkable%20neighborhoods%20can%20reduce%20prevalence%20of%20obesity%2C%20diabetes,-Washington%2C%20DC%20February&amp;text=People%20who%20live%20in%20walkable,Endocrine%20Society's%20journal%2C%20Endocrine%20Reviews](https://www.endocrine.org/news-and-advocacy/news-room/2022/walkable-neighborhoods-can-reduce-prevalence-of-obesity-diabetes#:~:text=Walkable%20neighborhoods%20can%20reduce%20prevalence%20of%20obesity%2C%20diabetes,-Washington%2C%20DC%20February&amp;text=People%20who%20live%20in%20walkable,Endocrine%20Society's%20journal%2C%20Endocrine%20Reviews).\n\nThere's also studies that people in transit-oriented developments walk considerably more than those in people in non-transit-oriented developments: [https://www.jtlu.org/index.php/jtlu/article/view/1530/1491#:\\~:text=These%20studies%20also%20identified%20high,between%20TODs%20and%20walking%20activity](https://www.jtlu.org/index.php/jtlu/article/view/1530/1491#:~:text=These%20studies%20also%20identified%20high,between%20TODs%20and%20walking%20activity).\n\nObviously, the claim isn't that making cities more dense and redesigning streets to be safer and more appealing is somehow sufficient in tackling these public health crises. Diet probably plays a very large role in obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. In fact, the first study I mentioned admits that the positive effects that walkability has can be outweighed by the presence of a fast-food chain and air pollution. Countries with compact cities and pedestrian-oriented street designs still heavily regulate the fast food and junk food industry through things like sugar taxes and maybe straight-up banning certain ingredients. \n\nAnyways, my question is how exactly do we get past the potential self-selection bias problem? One of the criticisms of these studies is that one reason why walkable and transit-oriented neighborhoods have a better track record for public health is because they attract the people who are interested in maintaining their health, where as lower density neighborhoods which force you to drive a car attract people who are not interested in fitness and walking. If anyone has a study which controls for the self-selection bias, please feel free to link it.",

I am a planner for a small town outside of Portland, Oregon and we have a developer that needs to install a multi-use path to the meet the City’s connectivity requirements. The engineer designed a path through the site to meet ADA code for maximum grade, run, landings, etc., however, the developer says it’s cost prohibitive and has asked if there is any flexibility. It is on a steep slope and I agree that meeting such requirements could cost enough to kill the project. I have reviewed docs at access-board.gov and fs.usda.gov as I am now trying to learn how ADA is applied by other agencies to trails.  Specifically, how do they address maximum grade and surfacing?  Is crushed and compacted rock a stable, firm and slip resistant surface that can be used instead of asphalt?  Is the key issue to provide an accessible route to the termini of a trail, or does the entire trail need to meet all ADA requirements?  Is a “trail” treated differently than a “multi-use path?”\n \nI look forward to any insight",

This is frequently used to justify the push to micromobility, or otherwise \"right-sizing\" our transportation to fit the job.\n\nHowever, while I'm totally committed to that urbanist vision, I've never really understood the underlying behavior. I live in Los Angeles, which admittedly is fairly sprawling, but even though I have tried to localize myself close to where I work, it's still &gt;10 miles. And I actually think that I'm the exception in the sense that as far as I can tell the \"standard lifepath\" for most middle class people in LA is to buy a house way out in the suburbs and commute 30+ minutes to where the jobs are. \n\nSo that's a commute from the valley or OC to LA, which is easily 20+ miles. And this is the *main trip* you're doing every day, both ways. You might not go to the grocery store every day, or the park, or whatever, but you're probably going to work almost every day (at least, pre-COVID).\n\nAgain my experience is for LA, but I would guess that it's probably the same for most major Metro areas in the US. Certainly the bay area, I'm sure Texas metros, East coast might be some exception but then again I would imagine in NYC most daily workers live pretty far out of the city.\n\nSo given that most people working in major metro areas of the US live 20+ miles away from work, and that this is the *primary* trip people make on a daily basis, how can it be the case that *most* trips are &lt;5 miles?",

I think I could convince my town council to trial mixed-use development in one neighborhood and as it becomes more appealing and more profitable over the next 20 years it would spread to other neighborhoods. I worry however that if it has significant problems rather than try to amend those problems the city will opt instead to revert back to the old zoning code.\n\nThings I would like to implement:\n\n\\-Get rid of lot coverage maximums, mandatory setbacks, and allow for row houses\n\n\\-Allow for some businesses to be built in residential neighborhoods\n\n\\-Get rid of parking minimums\n\nThings I'm worried about occurring that will hurt future developments:\n\n\\-Ugly homogenous row houses\n\n\\-Loud businesses which stay open late\n\nWays I've thought of addressing these problems:\n\n\\-Maximum number of houses with the same blueprints per neighborhood\n\n\\-A time when businesses in residential neighborhoods must be closed and/or a list of businesses that cannot open in residential neighborhoods (bars, nightclubs, dispensaries)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWould love some feedback on these problems/solutions because I feel like if this doesn't go right the first time it's going to be a long time before I get another shot.

The roads are chaotic and narrow, with a lot of one way roads. While this may seem good from a car-lite perspective, it makes it difficult to find space for bike infrastructure, especially fully separate ones. There is simply no space for anything. There's also the problem of the climate. It's tropical, which might be worse than in cold climates as cycling generates body heat.\n\nWould cycling infrastructure be practical, or would it be better to improve other modes like public transport?",

My undergrad is in landscape architecture. Plus, I took both courses in the Philippines. Would've pursued my studies abroad, but the pandemic started when I began my grad studies...so it was more practical for me to not fly out. \n\nThe only planning-related experience I have is this short contractual consulting job where I helped a city's planning department with the updating of their documents (e.g. profile, land use plan, etc.). I have zero transportation planning experience and wasn't able to learn any related software (e.g. VISSIM, VISUN, etc.) since my school doesn't offer subjects on these, unfortunately. But I'm trying to find whatever free resources are available so I can fill the gaps in skills I lack. \n\nI've been considering overseas prospects for work, and have been applying to a bunch of job posts already. I'm eyeing Canada, Singapore, and Australia...but I also applied for US jobs. Would consider Europe, but am hesitant about the language barrier. \n\nSo far, I haven't had much success yet in my job search. And there's also the added difficulty of getting into entry-level/intern jobs because of not having the proper work permit/visa. \n\nI wanted to ask if there were any success stories of folks like me from a third-world country....who were able to get planning-related work overseas? It would be cool to hear about your experiences. Reading other folk's work-related stories on the sub-reddit has been enlightening on my part so far. \n\nPlus, if anyone also has their own stories of being able to get work abroad (regardless of where they studied), feel free to chime in.",

It's a relatively walkable area.\n\nThere is a coming construction project to build a modest sized hotel near the downtown to facilitate additional foot traffic in the area because we also have a tourist income base that the downtown benefits from. The downtown businesses are in favor of it (and in fact even coughed up some of their own money to help finance the project) but are concerned about the impact of the construction on their revenues.\n\nMaybe I'm misremembering, but I could've sworn I've read some articles about how construction projects like this have the potential to increase business revenues by decreasing car traffic and increasing pedestrian traffic in front of businesses.

        "text": "I've been toying with this idea for a while, but never found an example. Has anyone seen this or had any thoughts?\n\nNormally when you use a bike share, the cost will be $0.15 to $0.30 a minute. What if a city subsidized this so that for the first 2 - 5 hours of use, you were actually paid. Maybe on a sliding scale. \n\nBut heres the twist, you're paid on your transit card. So the balance is really just free transit rides. \n\nThe goal is obviously to incentive building the habit of using both the bike share, which is now financially rewarding, and using transit, which recieves an (apperently) subsidized ride. Maybe you bike in the summer and save some credits for rides in the winter, or perfer to ride on rainy days. Transit is often subsidized regardless, so in many cases this may just show that subsidy to the rider. \n\nAlso, in some cases those transit rides may simply be off peak, meaning they are using empty room and have a near 0 marginal cost. Additionally, $30 is maybe, maybe, 2 weeks of transit usage. And thats like local buses. So for most users your still paying for most trips. \n\nThe bike system itself would require a direct subsidy to cover its expenses, but that assume people max out at the 3-5 hour usage limit. I would suggest by incentivizing that level of usage every week, you're building ridership which will be commited enough to pay part of the month.",

        "text": "Irvine CA is a master planned community. I am not from the area but was looking at videos of neighborhoods in California. I noticed that the older neighborhoods in Irvine consisted of large homes in large lots. However Irvine Company expanded to expand another 1300 acres. I noticed the new homes are denser. The single family homes are built on smaller lots, their were townhomes and condos for sale. I am not sure what the population is but read somewhere there is about 50K residents so far. Not sure if that's at maximum capacity as I think new homes are still being built. Could this be a good model for building denser homes? The homes are still expensive but I hear the neighborhood is expensive in general due to demand. Some of the townhomes were under 1M which is less than the 2-3M for single family homes. It seems like the community still has it's charm despite the denser homes. But again it was just watching a few videos and I'm from the outside looking in.  Could this be a good example of a city building denser homes?",

        "text": " \n\n*Strong Towns considers this piece too political, so I'm sharing my thoughts here.*\n\n\\------------------\n\nEnergy is fundamentally the ability to do work. A resilient, Strong Towns-style approach avoids overinvestment in oversized highways, parking lots, or streets. It takes energy to push apart places worth being, so let's be lazy and let things come together.\n\nAs Bill McKibben notes, one barrel of oil “yields as much energy as twenty-five thousand hours of human manual labor--more than a decade of human labor per barrel.”(1) It is much more resilient to design a town that doesn’t take the equivalent of days, months, or years of your life to pick up groceries. \n\nNor is the move to electric cars without its own fundamental energy challenges. A single electric F-150 contains more than 1,800 pounds of batteries, enough material to use for more than 230 electric cargo bikes.(2) To the extent you use your truck to drop a couple kids off for activities and pick up groceries with your 230 miles of range, the same amount of electricity to fill up your truck can send a fleet of families on bicycles more than 10,000 miles.(3) \n\nAnd the energy needed to travel across your built environment is just one part of the picture. According to Pavement Tools Consortium, a partnership between several state DOTs, the FHWA, and the University of Washington, “the power needed to make one kilogram (about 2 pounds) of asphalt could power a typical household for about an hour.”(4) The energy needed to construct one lane of road one kilometer in length--just over half a mile--is the equivalent of burning 23,000 gallons of gasoline. Put another way, that amount of pavement would cover roughly 150 parallel parking spaces, yet the total energy input to pave the space is equivalent to the gas needed to drive 750,000 F-150’s across its length. A city that expects to continue paving and repaving in a deteriorating environment is in for a rough road ahead.\n\n\\---\n\nFootnotes:\n\n(1)  Bill McKibben, Eaarth: Making a Life on a Tough New Planet \n\n(2) [https://www.thedrive.com/tech/40676/electric-ford-f-150-lightnings-battery-weighs-over-1800-pounds-by-itself](https://www.thedrive.com/tech/40676/electric-ford-f-150-lightnings-battery-weighs-over-1800-pounds-by-itself)\n\n(3)  [The RadWagon e-bike contains a 7.7 lb bttery and can travel 45 miles per charge.](https://www.radpowerbikes.com/collections/electric-cargo-utility-bikes/model-family_radwagon)\n\n(4)  [https://pavementinteractive.org/energy-and-road-construction-whats-the-mileage-of-roadway/](https://pavementinteractive.org/energy-and-road-construction-whats-the-mileage-of-roadway/)",

Does this sound feasible, or is it just a tragedy of the commons in neglect?",

Most of the time, it just doesn’t seem worth it to place skyscrapers in a mid-size or even small city. I feel as if mid-sized and small cities should focus more on downtown walkability which means a larger and denser amount of smaller or midsize buildings. Looking at pictures of cities such as Indianapolis and Columbus make the skyscrapers look really out of place",

Could less be more?\n\n**Wikipedia**: *Placemaking  is a multi-faceted approach to the planning, design and management of public spaces. ... Good placemaking makes use of underutilized space to enhance the urban experience at the pedestrian scale to build habits of locals.*\n\n**Congress for the New Urbanism**: *Placemaking is the process of creating quality places that people want to live, work, play, and learn in. Placemaking is a process. It is a means to an end: the creation of Quality Places.* \n\nSo **Placemaking** is owners of public space appointing experts to design, create or repurpose (and maybe manage) some of that public space, i.e. **FUTURE** physical transformation. It may often prove to be an effective and worthwhile process, but it is time-consuming, money-consuming and space-consuming.\n\nWhat then is **Placetaking**? It is owners of public space who facilitate the use of existing public space **NOW** for meetings and any other activities. It is regulated and managed according to clear rules, with a minimum of bureaucracy to protect the interest of the owner, the organiser and those who attend whatever is Taking Place.\n\nLess might be more ...

Because I had no clue I am now taking a gap year in Canada and noticed how shitty a lot of town here actually designed and connected which made me think of going into the urban planning area of studies. I only just recently found this subreddit and would like to ask a few questions about how this field of study works.\n\n-What kind of topics does it cover before going into a more focused point of study?\n\n-What niches are there?\n\n-What even is the essence of Urban and regional planning?\n\nAnd last but not least\n\n-What do you actually even do while and after studying this topic?",

My idea is…\n\nThe UK bans anymore private house building beyond small local builders on small plots.\n\nCreates a Corporation which can be invested in by private entities which proceeds to build social housing exclusively, of good design but from the same set formats country wide. Think properly modernised commie blocks, townhouses, and some semi detached where space allows, but very little deviation. These are never allowed to be sold or sub letted or used as second homes, they must always be below market rate, but in my head economy of scale and longevity might give good returns, and stabilise the housing market giving basically everyone the option of cheap housing even if it’s not ideal all the time.\n\nIt seems like sensible capitalism to me.\n\nThoughts? Open to any, I’m new to this but being right wing have always felt excluded from the debate around affordable housing.",

        "text": "This idea has been in my head for a while, and I need some input. I’d love to hear constructive criticism from smarter housing geeks. \n\nGOAL: Develop an efficient affordable housing development policy “toolbox”that empowers individuals and working people over extreme profit. Also, it would would avoid the overly complex financial, political and bureaucratic status quo. \n\nCAVEAT: I realize this is likely left of the Overton window for most of US, but the approach seems commensurate to the current crisis and maybe even the coming political will. Hear me out. \n\nHere are the basics: \n\n1. Establish a public bank (as in North Dakota) offering very low interest real estate loans. The bank would lend money using community specific metrics that balance a small financial return and prioritizing social outcomes (home ownership). \n2. Establish a public land development agency. The agency would manage the permitting, subdividing and developing of  traditional neighborhoods with street grids (think of 1920s scaled neighborhoods).\n3. The zoning is very permissive and form based. Even allowing for small business, temporary dwellings like mobile homes , tiny houses on trailers , etc so long as no clear safety or threats of the quiet enjoyment arise . \n4. Optional : A simple HOA covers common areas . \n\nOUTCOME : tenants slowly become owners without spending a huge amount in financing\nCities become more people scaled like they used to be\nLong term, housing becomes slightly more affordable \n\nThanks for considering",
