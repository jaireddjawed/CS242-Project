I wish i was writing some sort of copy and paste story right now, but i\u2019m not. Today I had just gotten a phone-call from my girlfriend, also 16, where she told me that she is pregnant. She said that while in the mental hospital, they ran urine tests on her and found out she was pregnant. Neither of us want to have a baby. Her mother was notified but I have yet to tell my mother anything. Our moms are pro-life. We are scared that her mother won\u2019t allow her to have an abortion. I also now live in a different state then my girlfriend. I am scared. I don\u2019t know what to do or how to feel about anything.\n\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the support and resources that you have given me. I still am unable to contact her at the moment as i cannot call and request to speak to her at the mental hospital. To those who are suggesting that we keep the baby, i hear you. Though I need you to understand that we mentally, physically, financially, and any other way you can think of cannot support this baby. To those who suggest putting the baby up for adoption, please understand that my girlfriend does not want to give birth at all. She desperately wants to abort. The fetus should only be a couple weeks old. She resides in California and I reside in Vegas, I cannot physically put in very much effort. Incase the abortion is not free, I do have a way to pay it.","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678655393.0},{"title":"One family member per night picks nightly entertainment","author":"RealTobyJensen","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Parenting\/comments\/11pibzv\/one_family_member_per_night_picks_nightly\/","text":" \n\nWe call it MELT, short for Mark, Ellen, Larry, Tom, our names. (Well, not really our names IRL, but you get the idea.) One night it's Mark's turn, next Ellen's, next Larry's, next Tom's.\n\nIf it's your MELT that night, you do the dishes (damn) but also get to pick what we watch on TV or play couch co-op video games or board games or just agree to ignore each other (because sometimes nobody is really feeling MELT-y). Could be some Jackbox or Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes on the xbox, or Pictionary or whatever. Sometimes we'll just hang out and draw or something. Sometimes some tv or a movie. (Always Sunny is pretty unanimous).\n\nIt has kind of a nice benefit in that the dishes always get done in a reasonably timely manner, and nobody complains too much if somebody picks a lame tv show or something. But dishes are kind of a side point. \n\nWe've been doing MELT for about 4 years now and it's still going pretty well. We've bought pretty much all the good couch co-op video games. Give it a try. I think it'd be more effective with younger kids. My boys are 15 and 17 now, but I wish I'd done it with them when they were 5 and 7. \n\nThis kind of Family Hour thing doesn't have to be nightly. We often skip several nights as life gets in the way. Sometimes we go 4 or 5 nights with no activity, but we always do a quick check-in to see if we want to do something together that night.","upvote_ratio":0.98,"created_utc":1678637612.0},{"title":"Parents of adults, what do you regret doing or not doing when your kids were younger?","author":"Spoonerize_Duck_Fat","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Parenting\/comments\/11peuva\/parents_of_adults_what_do_you_regret_doing_or_not\/","text":"When you see how your kids turned out as adults, are you able to connect it to specific ways you raised them, in either good or bad ways?

Regarding safeguarding your children against potential predators: You cannot always be there \u2014 they are at school, at softball practice, at church camp, all kinds of places where adults will have access to your kids. But, you can still put an extra layer of protection between your kids and predators.\n\nIncident to volunteering at my kids school, parents are required to complete a course about spotting behaviors of the adults around you that could put kids at risk. There was a long video featuring interviews with a bunch of predators who are in prison for molesting kids. IT WAS SHOCKING. Coaches, neighbors, teachers, pastors, relatives \u2014 they all had access, and they all picked their targets very carefully, then evaluated and conditioned them over a period of time, where they would escalate the touching gradually.\n\nI want to share some skills that have served me well over the years as I sought to protect my kids.\n\nOpen conversations with your kids at an early age about inappropriate touching and body privacy \u2014 kids should be made aware that their bodies are not fair game to anyone. No one should be touching them in their \u201cswimsuit areas\u201d and if this happens tell them it\u2019s ok, but they should tell you right away to make sure they are fine. Let them know that adult just doesn\u2019t know the rules, and you can help with that. (Important to make sure the kid doesn\u2019t think they will get the other adult in trouble if they tell you). Also, let them know that it\u2019s ok to have secrets with their friends, but they should never have secrets with grown ups, except you.\n\nMany predators do a lot of innocent touching right in front of the parents \u2014 tickle fights, wrestling, joke-spanking or swatting their butt, full body front hugs, a lot of touching \u2014 so that the kid understands there is tacit approval of this semi-intimate touching, and that mommy approves of it \u2014 after all, the parent is right there and there\u2019s no problem. If you see any of this, you must immediately interrupt it in a cheerful and covert way. Then, get that adult alone asap and say the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, this is a little awkward and you probably think I\u2019m overly protective, but we are doing a safe touching protocol in our family, and we have some rules we must follow with Jane - we are currently teaching her how to recognize and protect herself from potential predators so that she is not vulnerable as she grows up. It can be confusing to kids, and it involves a lot of talking and sharing at home, and restrictions on how adults touch her. Of course I know that your tickle fight with her was completely innocent, but I just wanted to ask for your help in our efforts, so that she won\u2019t be confused. So, I would appreciate it if you did not wrestle with her or tickle her, even if I\u2019m right here, because she might misunderstand your interaction with her. She is learning about appropriate vs. inappropriate touching, and we are discussing it at home with real life examples. You might be surprised to know that tickling by an adult is definitely off limits. Also, we have told her that she\u2019s not allowed to have any secrets with other adults, so please don\u2019t ask her to keep any secrets.\u201d\n\nAnother thing \u2014 if I saw an adult doing those touching activities with OTHER PPLS KIDS, I would often say a version of the same thing, only something like \u201cI recently went through this predator-spotting course at my daughters school, and they tell parents to turn in other adults they think might be engaging in predator behavior. They particularly pointed out wrestling and tickle fights (or whatever you just saw the adult do) as things predators always do early on as they target child victims. Just looking out for you \u2014 it might be a good idea not to do that stuff anymore, as you might wanna reduce your risk of ever getting accused of that \u2014 can you even imagine how that could ruin someone\u2019s life!?!\u201d\n\nVery likely the interaction WAS completely innocent, but the predators interviewed in the video all said that if they thought the kid was wise or any hint the parent or another adult might be suspicious, the risk of being caught was way too high and that kid was immediately COMPLETELY OFF LIMITS as a target. Anyone who is not a predator will not be offended, and anyone who is a predator will go hunting elsewhere.\n\nI had this sort of talk with countless adults over the years who had access to my kids, including the parents where my kids went for sleepovers. No one was offended, and many of them actually wanted to know more and were really interested. I tell every parent I know this trick. I will never know if a predator was around my kids, but I did make a big point of signaling to all adults in my vicinity about how aware our family is of this issue, and that we are talking and watching\u2026.","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1678651525.0},{"title":"It's just relentless...","author":"jafaraf8522","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Parenting\/comments\/11poqs4\/its_just_relentless\/","text":"I'm a dad of 2 under 2. I'm pretty sure I'm still very much in the trenches. I try and remind myself of that. But man, sometimes, it's still a really tough gig. I don't think I realized just how relentless being a dad could be. How much of your previous life is just, gone, and how little time or energy there is for anything else.\n\nBoth kids are sick all the the time, so we're frequently taking days off or working late into the evenings to make up for the time. My older daughter, while curious, engaging, and, at times, very charming, is challenging. She always has been, even as a infant. As she's gotten older, I feel more and more like one of those psychics in the minority report, always trying to anticipate what's going to set her off and trying to intervene ahead of time. There's very little easy time with her, it's very much go go go and often, cry cry cry.\n\nI miss my wife. Or how we used to be. We're pretty good at keeping communication open and sharing the workload. I think in that sense our relationship is \"good\" and we're handling being parents well. But despite that, being parents has largely consumed our lives and left very little left for each other. It's hard not to feel more distant. Less like a romantic couple and more like business partners.\n\nI miss having sex. It's become like a once every 2 months kinda thing. I've read that's not uncommon and should hopefully come back. I don't blame my wife for it, and try my best to be patient and supportive. I essentially stopped initiating b\/c I don't want to put pressure on her until she feels ready again. But it still makes me sad, and frustrated.\n\nReally I think I miss just having just *any* amount of time or energy for something else besides work and being a dad. Every day it feels like a sprint. Just trying to get the kids ready, figure out meals, furiously do work, pick up the house, shuttle them to and from daycare, fill the time when they're home, deal with tantrums, get them to bed, do some extra work, and then crash only to do it all over again the next day. There's no rest days.\n\nI've spoken with dads who have older kids and I generally ask, in a pleading kind of way, \"it gets easier, right?\" and they generally laugh and say \"no, it just gets different\". Frankly, I'm ready for different. This is brutal.","upvote_ratio":0.85,"created_utc":1678652538.0},{"title":"Daughter (6) only has accidents.

He doesn\u2019t even go outside and kick the ball around with our kids on his days off.  He sits at his desk and games. All day and all night.  There\u2019s always justification or excuses when I confront him about it.

Also no kissing or eye contact during sex. I will literally stare at him with hungry eyes and I\u2019m a total sex kitten in bed. But it\u2019s like totally one sided.

This is important to note. \n\nThis is a highly ranked daycare center, with a lengthy wait list. Things were going great until he returned after Christmas break and all of his friends were moved into a Preschool room. They turn 3 around the same time he does, so I began to inquire as to when he\u2019d move up. Toddlers as young as 15 months old were moved into his current classroom, he is now the oldest, and he is having a hard time participating during some activities. He also doesn\u2019t have anyone to practice age appropriate conversations with. I\u2019m a mother, but also an educator, and I am very unhappy with this. I have been given ambiguous answers as to when he\u2019ll move up. At this point, I don\u2019t feel like the daycare administrators really care or have an interest. Some of this might be bias because I am one of the low-income families who utilize this center. \n\nIt\u2019s really saddening that my opinion is being ignored. His therapists have been neutral and aren\u2019t advocating for him to move up. His current teacher dotes him as the \u201cclass leader\u201d which is nice, but I am more concerned with him talking and being with peers his actual age. When I observe him, he is never playing with any of these children as he did the previous ones. He never talks about them. He is not interested. I know my child. He\u2019s also been crying and having a hard time participating in circle time and I haven\u2019t been notified of this\u2026 I found out after questioning one of his therapists. Overall, I\u2019m dissatisfied.  *editing to add that they continue to let him nap for 3 hours and well into snack time, when I have asked more than once for them to not allow that. 3 hours is too long for his age because he is not able to fall asleep at bedtime. I caught them again this week. \n\nI am planning on putting my foot down this week. I will ask them again to move him up to Preschool, or I will pull him out. \n\nThoughts? Experiences? I have found a center near our home that\u2019ll have space for him in 2 weeks. I hate to walk away from such a great opportunity, but it isn\u2019t turning out to be so great after all.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678673964.0},{"title":"Nobody said it was this hard...","author":"imatmywitsend1","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Parenting\/comments\/11poiqq\/nobody_said_it_was_this_hard\/","text":"Sorry, need to vent...\n\nMy daughter is 12, she's smart girl but..it drives me nuts, everyday I repeat the same stuff I m doing for years; she's in secondary now and I realise it's a big change,  but we, I, need to push everyday for  her doing stuff at home, making her bed, wear socks, sweater, clean up the table, read a book, don't slam the door, turn off the lights..\nI feel sooo tired of all that tonight...","upvote_ratio":0.88,"created_utc":1678652017.0},{"title":"How to use baby gates with dog in house","author":"miscreantrobert","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Parenting\/comments\/11ptung\/how_to_use_baby_gates_with_dog_in_house\/","text":"Hi all, we're about to have to start using baby gates at our house for our infant, and want to find a way to let our 40 lb dog get past or over them.

His eyes open wide and generally a look of horror. \n\nI don't believe he is fully awaken when this happens so we are even more confused as to what could be causing this because what I have read online is that nightmares don't happen until babies are about 18 months old or so. \n\nOf course this doesn't happen every time he wakes up but it has happened enough times to make us worry and seek advice. \n\nFor what it's worth, we are always there for him whenever he needs us as we both work remotely.

Baby will sleep in our room as long as is practical.

My partner, K had previously broken up with R due to lots of mental health concerns and alcoholism that had resulted in their marriage ending. So right at the same time I (F) met my partner of 3.5 years R died from an accidental overdose.  For the past couple of years I have been in a defacto dad role going through the trauma of a lifetime with a small boy as well as with my partner. \n\nSo both K and I have been going through this together but we had noticed that G was having significant challenges at school so we had him evaluated and he is doing worse than we had feared, or at least it truthfully put our fears into writing with concrete diagnosis. So among other issues he is facing a significant issue with anxiety, ADHD, dyslexia, dysgraphia, and a generalized coordination disorder. \n\nSo now we are both on the back foot, I worry that my son will be messed up forever and am worried about his future as he is still at a kindergartener to early grade 1 level despite lots of intensive work, tutoring and other work being put forth by everyone.. and also that he is so anxious about everything. Also his anxiety is getting worse but he won't talk to anyone about it and I think has become crippling to the extent that he never wants to get into anything new, stating that he wishes he was dead and has previously self harmed by hitting himself and won't listen to any positive feedback by saying he is dumb\/stupid.\n\nWe took him to a very good pediatrician who recommended that he be placed on some very low dose medications as well as to continue seeing a psychologist in the in community.\n\nHowever he absolutely refuses to take the medicine and says that it will change who he is. Do I break the trust with him and just sneak it into his food like a dementia patient or try and reason with him (unsuccessful so far). I don't know what to do.\n\nTLDR: Has stepson with lots of trauma in history and anxiety.

We don't reward bad behavior, and she's become better at asking for things nicely (using \"please\" and \"thank you\" for example). However, she is absolutely abysmal at sharing; we recently had her play with some other kids around her age, and she refused to give anyone else a turn with her hoard of toys. And I use \"hoard\" deliberately; if someone played with something for even a second, she'd want it too, and once something entered her stash no one else was allowed to touch it.\n\nWe would ask her to share and give one of her toys to another child who asked for it, but she'd immediately lose her cool and start screaming at us. It got to the point where we just had to remove her from the others as she was only ruining playtime for everyone else.\n\nIt was pretty clear that we haven't been doing enough to teach her about taking turns, so now I'm looking for what we can do better.\n\nWe have another little one on the way, and we hope to have more chances to teach her how to share once she has a sibling. But we'd rather not wait until then to help her with this. Does anyone have tips for what we could do to help her learn how to share with others when she only has her parents to interact with?\n\nEdit: Appreciate all the comments so far. It seems like I may have been thinking of sharing a bit too simply, and potentially having slightly higher expectations of our toddler than is fair. This is good to learn; we obviously want to be the best parents we can be, but how to do that is something we're still trying to learn.

My step son 8, when he is with me and my husband on the weekends, he is granted a lot of time on his switch gaming system, as his weekends are a lot of his break away from home with mom. I\u2019m a gamer too, and have been since his age, so I understand a lot of his emotions however silly and trivial to us adults. \n\nSS has had all sorts of issues with his behavior regarding the switch, and in my opinion they are severe. SS is very frequently getting angry at his friends in game and insulting them, and vise Versa, and it results in him thrashing and throwing around his console, sometimes punching it, but most often screaming and crying is the end result. And the worst thing of all in my opinion, is despite his age, he is having accidents, by holding in whatever wants to come out for too long. This weekend in particular he ran through two pairs of underwear, and 3 pairs of pants. That is pretty much the line for me, personally, but as there are two other parents involved in this situation I am a minority in how this is handled. Mom is to aggressive, dad is to placative. if he was my son,  he wouldn\u2019t have access to the switch at all until the greater issues were handled. \n\nWe have tried getting through to him in a lot of ways that not only is this unhealthy it\u2019s just generally not okay.\n\nMy husband is quite firm with him, he can be pretty playful and fair about these issues, and they will talk well\nWith eachother, dads good at getting him calm, but he hands the switch back often after their convos go well, and it isn\u2019t usually much short of a day later SS has these same issues again. I try to stay strictly therapeutic, get him to open up, find the bigger issue and help. But I can only do so much.\n\nToday, he started getting mean with his friends, again and his dad gave him a nudge, and he stopped briefly, but got angry again and threw the switch soon after. I apologized, and explained that I was going to have to take it away. And he started trying to play tug of war with me and screamed no in my face. \n\nI tried to just stay calm, and say I was sorry again, and calmly explain why this happened.  His father stood up for me and told him that was unkind to me, and decided to take the switch away for the day. \n\nI had to step out of the room, and take a breath. But when I came back in they were at the tail end of him crying and talking with his dad, and soon laughing and giggling. As great as this is, and a nice break from the moment. I know this issue will arise again or keep getting worse. My husband just sort of chooses to leave his son to think on his own about how he can be better with this, and sort of only focuses on how it\u2019s bad, but by no means, tries to model the difference in thinking, required for him to actually improve.\n\nI\u2019m not all together sure either how to, especially with where I stand.

But this meant that my whole family (dad and both kids - 2 and 7) were quickly shuffled an hour away with no packing\/planning\/prepping etc. (7 year old was freaked at the idea of the ER visit and wanted the whole family there even if they stayed in a hotel room). \n\nThankfully she didn\u2019t have to spend the night, we spent it at the hotel and headed home the next afternoon. Prior to this she had been sick for about a week with fluctuating fevers (up to 104 at least daily) and just feeling pretty crappy overall. Which means whiny frustrated kid with a wild feral Covid toddler (kidding not kidding - born June 2020) that is exhausting , even by typical toddler standards, on a good day.

That being said,  the next door neighbors have two little boys 5 and 3 that are ALWAYS outside roaming and looking for attention and excitement. I take my boys (4.5 non verbal asd and 16 months old) to the pool and these poor sweet boys are watching through the gate trying to scale the fence and even asked me to let them in which of course I can't just let some random persons kids in as that's a huge risk and liability.  It's heartbreaking. The amount of time they spend alone together wandering is alarming. Always outside. They flock to me. I was cleaning the car out today and they were glued to me the entire time and asked me for shoes and were so ecstatic that they fit as his were old and tattered. They saw My kids toys in the car (nothing thrilling) and were in awe. \nI want to help these boys and by that I don't mean calling cps. They're poc and I know the reality of what cps can do to families, especially pocThat being said the boy asked me if I whip my kids. I told him no I don't And he said \"my mom whips up. She told me not to knock on your door or she we will get a whooping..\" \nNot knowing what to say I said \"yeah I don't but everyone parents differently and some spank. You can always knock on my door though especially if something is wrong or you need something. I won't get mad. Your mommy probably just doesn't want you going to strangers.\"\nThey stayed with me the entire time I cleaned the car and constantly asked about going to the pool as they again saw me and the boys at the pool today. Mom has 3 other kids on top of the boys and is 8 weeks pregnant with twins. She's not feeling well with the pregnancy which I totally understand and feel for her but her kids are being neglected. The oldest (5) came to me sobbing this morning and when I asked what wrong he said \"my teeth\" his teeth were throbbing with pain and I'm not kidding when I say this, every single tooth is capped with silver, not fillings but completely capped. He was miserable and said \"mommy doesn't have medicine.\" I said I have Tylenol and asked him to get his mommy and he did. She came out and I told her I have children's Tylenol and gave her enough for 3 doses as well as all natural teething pods. He came back out to me 2 hours after that to tell me he felt so much better. These boys are dolls, the sweetest things and I know they're at best, bored our of their minds. I don't want to overstep but would it be odd for me (basically a stranger) to offer to her to take her boys with me when we go on walks? I have a wonderfold wagon which is a four Seater and plenty big for her boys and mine. I don't go super far no more than a mile away and usually about an hour per night (before dark) to help wind my kids down and for fresh air. Sometimes stopping at a gas station for a treat. \nShe is allowing me to take them swimming tomorrow which is a big deal as far as trust imo as I know I'd be weary on trusting anyone but myself with my kids around water yet she's letting me because her kids are desperate to swim and she won't\/can't bring them.  They've been begging me all day as I try to explain we are going tomorrow. Anyway, do you think me asking\/offering to take them for a walk and giving her my number would be inappropriate or crossing the line? They've been asking and are in awe over the wagon. Everything excites these boys are they're so bored and no attention is paid to them.  I find myself spending extra time outside to mind them because I worry about them with traffic, the pool and let's be honest, this hotel is not filled with great people and instead many residents are here over a few years (more than 3\/4 of the guests have been here over a year) which means likely that they're ones that for whatever reason can't get into a regular apartment which one of those reasons could be a predator charge. This is Florida so the odds are very high and this is an awful area.

I'm curious how people are balancing two careers and raising a child with limited support.\n\nMy wife and I have a 9 month old, two demanding careers, and no family in the immediate area. We have a nanny to provide childcare, but the days can be very long and we are hesitant to demand too much given the current state of childcare. I sometimes travel for business, which means my wife comes home from a long day and has to handle all of the childcare herself. It doesn't help that our LO isn't a great sleeper and has had some health challenges.\n\nMy wife is the breadwinner by a long shot, so the obvious solution is that I become a stay at home dad, but I'm very hesitant. I've heard lots of stories about how leaving the workforce will irreversibly kill a career. That's a tough pill to swallow given that this may be our only child and he won't be home all day for long.\n\nI'm also not sure how I would do as a male staying home with a toddler all day in a location with limited connections. A lot of my structure and social life came through my job. I've heard it can be difficult for dads to break into the local groups that meet up during the week.\n\nPretty sure I know what my options are, but I'm curious what others chose and how it worked out for them.

First child, first grandchild on both sides of the families, and so was very well spoiled by *everyone* before she was even born. Clothes, toys, the like. \n\nSo she has quite a bit of toys. It looks like a lot, but it\u2019s honestly not. We donated many of them. Her toys kinda live in our living room at the moment, until we move some furniture around and into her soon to be brother\u2019s nursery. We have not bought her many of them.\n\nMy mom (who by the way, has never had young children - long story short she adopted my siblings at semi young ages but not toddler stages; and I came to the family when her sister (my bio mom) died when I was 6) really doesn\u2019t know toddler life but likes to judge a lot.\n\nI bought my daughter a mini indoor trampoline for her second birthday, as she loved the trampoline park and I wasn\u2019t gonna want to go when it\u2019s negative temperatures outside, as we live in a very cold climate for winter. My mom complained that I \u201ctook that experience away from her and she has nothing to look forward to\u201d.\n\nGuess what? She still begs to go to the trampoline park! It hasn\u2019t ruined it at all.\n\nMy mom told my sister that we \u201cbuy her everything she wants\u201d and no one else is able to get her things because of it. That is absolutely NOT true! We hardly ever buy her toys. Yes, I bought her a couple playdoh kits because she didn\u2019t have much and thought that would be a fun alternative to screen time. No, I do not buy her toys every time we go to the store. When I do (maybe once every 3 or 4 months or so) they tend to be educational.\n\nIf my mom would ask me about what she would like to buy her first, then go ahead! But she doesn\u2019t. She just complains that she\u2019s too spoiled.\n\nI\u2019m getting her a (knockoff) strider bike and helmet for Easter. Is that gonna be held against me too? I want to get her an electric car for her third birthday in September; can I not even do that now? I like to get her kinda big things for holidays and birthdays.\n\nI think as long as you teach your child the importance of money and working hard for what they have, then it\u2019s fine to spoil them a bit when they\u2019re little. Especially with a new baby coming and one income (I\u2019m a SAHM) we won\u2019t have that extra money to spend.\n\nAnd no, I\u2019m not going to sit down and have a conversation with her about it. It will only hurt her feelings (she doesn\u2019t take things like this well). Plus she\u2019s already bugging me about potty training before baby comes and other things and it\u2019s just\u2026 a lot.\n\nWe don\u2019t have a playroom like some other people, we don\u2019t constantly gift her things, we never go on trips (we\u2019ve actually never been on one as a family), we say no often. It\u2019s just frustrating when you get told \u201cyou\u2019re great parents\u201d to your face and then judged behind your back.","upvote_ratio":0.75,"created_utc":1678636053.0},{"title":"Is it weird to smell check clothes to see if they need to be washed?","author":"alansmith500969","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Parenting\/comments\/11p5yyr\/is_it_weird_to_smell_check_clothes_to_see_if_they\/","text":"I was checking my son's (9) tshirt the other day with a smell test to see if there's any bo and I was met with a \"your being wierd\" comment.

She\u2019ll remind them about good choices or how doing certain things can lead to injuries. This is before they\u2019ve done anything to warrant a warning.\n\nToday, my wife took my son\u2019s Marvel Encyclopedia that he\u2019s had since Christmas and put it at the top of her closet claiming the book wasn\u2019t appropriate for his age. He\u2019ll turn 10 in a few months, and she didn\u2019t like how revealing some of the female character\u2019s clothing was or that one character was described as being a hero\u2019s \u201cgirlfriend until his wife came home.\u201d\n\nWhile I agree that overt sexual content isn\u2019t appropriate for 3rd graders, I don\u2019t believe that just yanking it from him without explanation besides \u201cit\u2019s not appropriate\u201d is effective at all. Also, he hasn\u2019t once objectified the female characters or made any inappropriate comments stemming from the book.\n\nWhat might be worse - and this is more of a relationship issue - is that she is extremely stubborn and defensive if I voice my opinion on the matter. She relies on her experience as an elementary teacher and shuts down any dissenting views. I don\u2019t even try anymore and just let it happen because 1) I refrain from contradicting my wife\u2019s parenting in front of the kids (which she doesn\u2019t always reciprocate) and 2) it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s worth the fight.\n\nI mean, what am I supposed to say? \u201cIt\u2019s cool for the boy to see that content\u201d when she\u2019s defined it as inappropriately sexual? \n\nThis isn\u2019t the only book she\u2019s done this with. He flew through the Harry Potter series until the 6th book and then when she saw a description of it saying the characters had love interests and \u201cflogging,\u201d she prohibited him from reading it. Wouldn\u2019t explain to him why. He just thinks it must be \u201ctoo scary.\u201d\n\nAnyways, I don\u2019t really know what my role is here. I disagree with her, but I\u2019m not TOTALLY sure I am right to let him read it. I\u2019d rather address the questionable material and use it as a teaching moment.

He\u2019s not involved in his education and doesn\u2019t support me. I spent years sharing everything that happened but he would either ignore my emails or tell me that I\u2019m the one raising him so it\u2019s not his problem. He remarried 1.5y after we got divorced so he\u2019s been kinda distant ever since. \n\nMy son has always been difficult but it got worse year after year. School always been a nightmare, not a week goes by without receiving an email or a call about his behaviour: he started in private school but after 3 years the phone calls and emails happened so often that I transferred him to public (which was what the private school wanted anyway). he\u2019s in 6th grade and weirdly this year has been quiet so far. \n\nHe\u2019s always asking me to buy things. Especially put money in his video games. If I say no, which happens a lot, he starts throwing a tantrum and\/or harasses me even during work until he gets the $20 or more sometimes. He expects things without giving anything in return. He just wants it. When I refuse  He insults me, hits me sometimes (but I can feel he\u2019s trying to refrain). He yells (rather screams). He laughs at me if I yell back at him. He tells me I\u2019m nothing and that no one wants me \u00ab\u00a0look at you, no one loves you, you are alone, no one wants you, you have no friends\u00a0\u00bb.\nI do have some friends. \n I feel miserable. He treats me like s*it. Most of the time I wish I could just end it. Disappear.\n\nI tried to enroll him in boarding school even though it\u2019s super expensive but I would have moved to a cheaper neighborhood in a much smaller home. Unfortunately, boarding schools are still good schools so he wasn\u2019t selected. I have no option, his father doesn\u2019t want him to live with him because of his wife even though he tells me he\u2019s nothing like that with him. \n\nI\u2019m both depressed and worried for his future. But most of the days I feel I\u2019d rather d*e than continue a life like this. This life is def not worth it. I failed at raising him. It\u2019s all my fault and he doesn\u2019t care about how I feel as long as he needs are met. \n\nHe\u2019s so insisting whenever he wants something that he bothers me while I\u2019m in meetings with camera on and demands that I listen to him. What am I supposed to do. I have to take care of him until at least he reaches 18. \n\nAll he does is play video games and eat. He isn\u2019t autonomous at all. I wake him up and repeat dozens of times \u00ab\u00a0eat\u00a0\u00bb \u00ab\u00a0go to the bathroom\u00a0\u00bb \u00ab\u00a0brush your teeth\u00a0\u00bb I have to push him every step of the way until he leaves for school. It takes me almost an hour to recover from the time I had to deal\nWith him in the morning. \n\nI have a good job but I changed 3 times because whenever I\u2019m about to take on more responsibilities I know I can\u2019t because of all the stress that taking care of him brings into my life. \n\nI wanted to know if someone ever experienced this and If you had any tips for me. Have you met a boy like that and finally turned out to be ok in his adult life? \n\nThanks for reading\n\nEdit: since some people have asked: He was assessed by a psychologist at 7 and was diagnosed with adhd. He did psychotherapy and occupational therapy but there wasn\u2019t any improvement (I also tried hypnosis but he would laugh at it, he didnt take it seriously). He is not medicated. He did that for a year and they also implemented things at school and I did at home too. I admit that after trying all this I lost faith in these techniques. Maybe I just didn\u2019t find the right therapist but it\u2019s really hard to get reference and therapists are often booked and don\u2019t take new patients\n\nEdit 2: I would like to address the boarding school thing: my intend wasn\u2019t to simple get rid of him but rather put him in a setting where everyone has to follow the same rules and be around adults he cannot manipulate. I felt the kind of population in boarding schools (I\u2019m talking about the students here) will make him want to be successful (as opposed to a troubled kid type of facility).\n Also, academically, when I am behind him and make sure he does his homework, learn the lessons, practices what he needs to practices he actually is successful but it\u2019s so much time invested for me. 4th grade is the last year I was overly involved in his academic performance but it was hours spent in just having him to agree to get to work \u2026 it wasn\u2019t sustainable for me.

My family and I need to settle somewhere \"for good\" within the next year, at least. My husband and I both grew up in Northern Virginia (NOVA) and went to college there, as well.\n\nSince my college years, I had always wanted to go live somewhere else, because I had spent all of my time in NOVA and wanted to experience something else (the old grass is greener thing, most likely).\n\nLate summer 2020, I finally convinced my husband to move away from the area and we settled on Wyoming (my in-laws have been there for a long time and we had visited many times before so it wasn't a total unknown).\n\nWe found an awesome house and moved in in early November 2020. The winters were not awesome (ha) but we did enjoy way less traffic than NOVA and the overall slower pace of life. The scenery was amazing and we did like being in a much smaller place, albeit pretty extreme politics aside.\n\nHowever, multiple members of my family on the East Coast became ill and during the time we were away I lost a grandparent I hadn't seen in years since moving. Everything was all weighing pretty heavy on my heart.\n\nI again convinced my husband to move back to NOVA to be present to support family who still needs help.\n\nBut now that we're back (been here almost 9 months now), I feel like I want to jump out of my skin again. It doesn't feel right to shell out $1.1M on a shitty house that I know we won't be happy with, nor be around so many damn people for the next 30+ years.\n\nWe are generally liberal leaning people but the political climate of NOVA these days is very off-putting to us. We don't like extremists of any kind and don't feel like we \"fit in\" a mold anywhere on the political spectrum. I think more realistically now we would be considered that dirty word \"moderate.\"\n\nI enjoy the West Coast and the PNW but we know we cannot do what we consider to be the politics and the tax systems currently in place in those states.\n\nWe also know we don't want to be in the desert or super cold climates (already did that in WY).\n\nPolitics isn't absolutely going to make or break a location, but being around sensible people would be ideal (knowing that \"sensible\" is all subjective, I guess!). We just want people to treat others kindly and be left alone if something doesn't personally affect them.\n\nWe are currently renting but know we will not renew our lease in the Fall when it expires. We've been peeping out land to build our dream house but are kind of all over the place - literally.\n\nAll I know is that wherever we end up, we WILL be there for the next 30 years.

Moving from my childhood home, not having to think about anything, and barely having responsibilities to moving in with someone was difficult.  I have just begun to adjust, and now I'm pregnant, and it's my fault. \n\nI think depression is playing its part in my emotions too, as I don't think I've admitted to myself how bad my mental health has been. \n\nPart of me, a big part, doesn't want to give up my freedoms, and lazy moments and PS5 days to a child.  It sounds like first world problems, but I really am undecided.  My partner is exctatic! He's so happy he's willing to change jobs so I can have more of his help, willing to change for this baby. He would be amazing. \nIt sounds awful that I'm not willing to let go or put on hold, my hobbies and free time for a child I, in theory, didn't prevent.  \n\nI have a great support system, my parents live 2 minutes away, and my dad will be a wonderful grandad.  My sister, though dubious and has the same concerns as me, will be supportive.  I have everything I need to make it work, but I haven't decided what to do.  \n\nAfterthoughts... I have a private scan at 7 weeks which is April first. An abortion consultation on the 16th of this month.  I thought I would do both and decide then. I really am mixed up. \ud83d\ude15 \n\nAny experiences, good and bad, are welcome. Just please don't be rude, I'm having a bad time as is.","upvote_ratio":0.5,"created_utc":1678622931.0},{"title":"My son punched a bully","author":"nugulon","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Parenting\/comments\/11o04uz\/my_son_punched_a_bully\/","text":"This morning before school my 6yo son was complaining of a bully who is a couple years older and has been pushing him and a bunch of kids in his class around.

My husband has one child (7) from a previous relationship and I have 2 (9,10), which are all boys. We then had 2 children of our own, 2 girls, who are now 2 and 1. In the 2 years since having the oldest girl and having another baby shortly after, my step son has never interacted with them. My older kids are very close to the babies and are very loving, protective and play with them often. I kinda figured my boys would have an easier time adjusting to their new siblings, since they were already used to having a one. That being said, we kind of prepared ourselves for ss to take a longer time to adjust and made it a point to not pressure him to interact, as we wanted him to feel comfortable and ready to do so. When the girls were infants, it was understandable that he was a bit distant as they are obviously harder for kids to connect in that way, since all they do is eat, sleep, cry and poop. We both assumed once they start walking, playing, talking, etc. it would be easier to interact, as they are a little more interesting for kids that are in our children\u2019s age group. Thing is, that hasn\u2019t happened. He\u2019s not mean. He just.. ignores them like they don\u2019t exist. The 2 year old will try to interact with him and he\u2019ll just stare at her with no emotion. You can tell she\u2019s a bit confused by his reaction because the other kids are very receptive of her. When this happens, we will say \u201cI think she wants to play with her big brother!\u201d , but he\u2019ll just continue to stare blankly. Even just around the house, he\u2019ll ignore the girl\u2019s existence if they are in the same room. We try to model ways to play with the girls and show how fun it is (they are both easy babies - happy and playful). Or, when my children play with the girls, we\u2019ll say \u201cisn\u2019t it fun to have cute babies!\u201d Or will praise them when they help out with them. Still nothing. It\u2019s gotten to the point where our 2 year old realizes my ss doesn\u2019t respond to her and has now stopped trying to even try to interact with him, too.

She\u2019s very happy, always smiling and babbling, sometimes goes a week, or more, without even crying. She plays a lot, by herself or with us, the parents, and she\u2019s very very sweet, hugging us when being left at daycare, saying \u201cdadadada\u201d to call me or \u201cmamamama\u201d to call her mum. Drags herself around the house like crazy and even started trying to pull herself up. She just can\u2019t sit by herself yet, but every baby does stuff at their own pace.\n\nThis was just to say we have an extremely easy, fun, and enjoyable baby to be around, very lucky with that.\n\nThen there\u2019s food. She does not, simply, want to eat. We have been told when she was 4 months old to introduce solids, we tried BLW which did not work at all, since she had no interest in putting food in her mouth. Eventually, following her paediatrician, we went for pur\u00e9ed food, and it\u2019s the same thing. She\u2019s absolutely not interested in eating and, to make things worse, she seems to mostly have also lost interest in nursing, and completely refuses any bottle, even if she loved to be bottle fed, with mum\u2019s breast milk, when she was smaller. The consequence of this is that she barely foot any weight from 6 months onwards, so she\u2019s a cute small baby, even if she\u2019s physically and mentally evolving, her wait almost doesn\u2019t change. \n\nWe have been told to give her high calorie synthetic milk, to no avail, she won\u2019t touch it. We have been told, then, to force her to eat, 3 meals a day, with. 3,5h interval between them. I mean really force her to eat by forcing a spoon with food into her mouth. We tried to be respecting that, but it\u2019s so mentally exhausting to lose a lot of time a day forcing food with her complaining, and sometimes she has even thrown up all food when we\u2019re about to finish the meal. There is one sole expedition to this: fruits. She does not mind, and even seems to enjoy, having fruit, with the exception of avocado. Thing is that fruit isn\u2019t nutritionally heavy enough and if her diet has more than 1 fruit meal, she\u2019ll struggle to keep her weight on.\n\nWe feel very shitty as parents, sometimes, since we can\u2019t even feed our baby.

On Tuesday I picked him up from the extended day program after school and the supervisor (ms.M) pulled me aside to let me know my son's teacher(ms.D) would be calling me that evening about an incident. Ms.M assured me that my son is ok and that he didn't do anything wrong but thats all she could tell me. I signed him out and we went to the car to head home. Later in the evening Ms.D calls and filled me in on what happened.\n\n My son had a pencil that he brought from home and another boy (we'll call him S.) demanded my son give him the pencil. My son never has a problem sharing but has also been taught he's allowed to say no, and he did. He held his ground until S. took the pencil from him. Ms.M stepped in right away and tried to mediate the situation.  That's when S. became extremely upset and not only threw the pencil at Ms.M but was screaming and losing his mind. The teachers had diffused the situation but a few moments later, S. walked up to my son, wrapped his hands around my sons throat and squeezed as hard as he could. Ms.M acted quickly and got S. off of my son. My son was rightfully terrified and luckily there was no physical damage done. Ms.D then tells me that S. has been a consistent problem in class for his behavior and requires staff to be with him all day long since this isn't the first time he's violently assaulted another student. She said in all her time teaching, she has never had to deal with such a troubled student. They have the school board and principal involved and S. has infinite resources of support to help him. She also tells me that they are working towards a resolution but \"these things take time due to the inclusion rules they have in place\". Due to confidentiality reasons, the teacher couldn't disclose if S. has any developmental disabilities but did hint that it's more a case of a poor home life. As much as I want to be angry with the situation, I feel bad for that boy. No child is just born so violent.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, again I'm picking up my son from the extended day program after school and he tells me S. punched him in the face twice at recess. I asked if he told the teacher and he said yes. Ms.M was there and confirmed it happened completely unprovoked. I asked what is being done about it and she shrugged her shoulders and said that their hands are tied and they're \"working on it\".\n\nI have great relationships with all of the teachers and I know this is hurting them almost as much as it's hurting my son but this is twice in a week that S. has violently laid hands on my son. My son is nervous to go to school now and it breaks my heart because he was struggling at the beginning of the year but has grown so confident. \n\nI need advice.. what can I do to add pressure to the board to do more?  What can I do to better support my son so he doesn't lose the confidence he's worked so hard for? The teachers are doing everything they can but it's clearly only going so far. \n\n\nTLDR; A boy in my son's class has tried strangling him and has punched him in the face twice just this week.

I didn't set out to write an epic.\n\nTL;DR Do I start a conversation with my ex about child support for our son that I basically have full custody of, and if so how do I start that?\n\nMy ex and I split up when our son was about a year and a half. We had originally agreed to continue our plan that we had when we were together, where he was going to be with her while I was at work and then I would pick him up from her and she would work third shift, but I would be the custodial parent and we would have joint custody. This was an attempt to avoid having to pay for childcare, since neither of us could really afford it. That eventually changed after a couple months to us trading off entire weeks because she needed to work during the day. \n\nA few more months passed, and I found out that she was going to be evicted from her apartment, and the \"only\" course of action she could take was to move to another state with her boyfriend. So I was forced to find child care for our son in a very short amount of time. I ended up filing for bankruptcy shortly afterwards because of credit card debt and being on a joint car loan with her that she wasn't paying on (even though she agreed to pay 100% of it in the divorce decree), but even after having most of my debts discharged through that, it's still rough. I'm paying more for childcare than I am for my house, and then I have my own car that I'm paying on, as well as utility bills, and trying to have food for us and gas to get to and from work and daycare. She has never offered any amount of money to help me out, even after moving back to the state I live in. She only sees him every other weekend, when he's with her parents (who I'm thankfully still on good terms with), so I still practically have full custody in all but name. \n\nI've somehow managed the past six months or so, but the toll that it's taking on my mental health is tremendous. I feel that I'm within my rights to seek child support, but I'm not sure how to go about starting that conversation. Is this even a thing where there needs to be a conversation, or do I just apply for it? Am I overthinking the possibility of there being a toxic environment for our son, since we don't really see each other? \n\nAny advice or thoughts on the matter are appreciated.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678589919.0},{"title":"I\u2019m afraid to go to therapy as a mom","author":"burnerbcimashamed","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Parenting\/comments\/11oy09l\/im_afraid_to_go_to_therapy_as_a_mom\/","text":"Don\u2019t know what I\u2019m hoping to get from this but I just need to vent. I have always had mental health issues (depression, adhd, ocd, anxiety) and I\u2019ve avoided going to therapy as an adult because I was forced into it as a teen which was traumatizing. But now I feel like maybe I could possibly benefit from being able to talk to someone. I used to have a lot of friends but since moving all I have is my partner. He always cares and listens to me but doesn\u2019t always know how to offer the best advice. Also I think medication is worth a try. I\u2019ve had bad experiences with anti depressants, but maybe something different could actually help. \n\nWhat is stopping me is the fear that, since I\u2019m a mother, what if my therapist\/psychiatrist decides that I am too mentally unfit to be a parent? My family has already expressed their feelings of this, ever since I got pregnant. My sister even tried telling me that I need to stop being selfish and let HER take custody of my child because I just can\u2019t do it. Well I\u2019m a year and 3 months into motherhood, and my pediatrician says my son is perfectly healthy so I guess I\u2019m not doing too bad. I always put caring for my son before anything else, but we almost never have a babysitter and it does get mentally exhausting sometimes. I just have a constant fear of CPS being called on me, even though I know I\u2019m not abusing my child, I had someone very close get their child taken unjustly and since then it\u2019s always in the back of my head. I know if I DID see a therapist I would probably lie about certain things to make myself seem like I\u2019m less mentally ill than I actually am.

He got his first ball python at 10 and now he is 15 and he has several snakes. His room is just full of tanks. The freezer in the garage is full of frozen rodents. He buys them with his allowance, and more recently his casual job. My wife doesn\u2019t like it so she just doesn\u2019t open the freezer in the garage or go into his room. When he was younger I used to help him with thawing the rodents and cleaning the tanks, but as the years went on and he seemed like he was on top of it all I kind of just let him do his thing. I haven\u2019t checked on his snakes in a while. To my knowledge, he hasn\u2019t killed any of his snakes yet. Sometimes I take him to the pet store and he buys little fancy hides for his snakes or a few bags of wood chips, but we live pretty close so usually he bikes himself there. He loves his snakes, they all have names. I see him walking around the house with a corn snake around his neck sometimes. I thought he was really responsible.\n\nHe\u2019s seemed a bit stressed out and not like himself lately, so I\u2019ve been telling him he can tell me anything he needs to and we don\u2019t need to tell his mom. Guy stuff. I thought there was a girl at school or something, but eventually I poked my head into his room and immediately noticed one of his tanks had the biggest snake I\u2019ve ever seen. I used to have a snake before I got married so I thought I would be able to adequately supervise his new hobby but somehow my son got his hands on a huge snake. I don\u2019t know how big it is, but it\u2019s two or three times the size of all the other snakes he has. It looks way too big for the tank it\u2019s in. I\u2019ve never seen such a huge snake before.\n\nThe poor thing is jammed in a 40 galleon tank. I only got him 40 galleon tanks because I THOUGHT he only had balls and corns. I asked him where he got the snake. He didn\u2019t want to tell me. I told him that he couldn\u2019t keep the snake, it was just too huge. To say he is heartbroken is an understatement. I don\u2019t even know how to describe how big this fucking snake is. My wife would absolutely lose her shit if she knew about this monster snake we have under our roof. Not gonna lie, I about blew a gasket. I told him that it was really cruel to keep such a large snake in such a small tank. It can\u2019t even slither around, there\u2019s just no room. I think my son knows what he\u2019s doing is wrong, but he doesn\u2019t want to give up the snake.\n\nMy son is usually such a good young man but he wouldn\u2019t tell me anything about this gigantic snake. I did some googling but I have no idea if it\u2019s a burm or a retic or what. Some kind of massive python. My son is a bit on the smaller side, I have no idea how he\u2019s been dealing with such a massive snake on his own or how he\u2019s been feeding it. I know how dangerous big snakes can be for one person. I am absolutely kicking myself knowing what could have happened to him in his own bedroom without my knowledge. I immediately started looking for somewhere to take the snake in and give it the proper care it needs. I have been in touch with a local zoo and a local reptile expert, we are working on it together, so it\u2019s just a matter of days till the big snake finds a home that can care for it properly. It cannot stay where it is, and it won\u2019t.\n\nThe advice I\u2019m looking for is how to navigate this with my son. I don\u2019t know how to make him understand why he can\u2019t keep the snake. I\u2019m also worried he will never forgive me for taking his pet away. He can keep all his other snakes, just not the one that is probably heavier than he is. I need to know what kind of snake it is and where the fuck he got it. I\u2019m also debating telling my wife or not. She is also an animal lover and will back me up about the snake not belonging in such a small tank, but I know she\u2019s going to lose her mind. She\u2019s terrified of snakes and will probably get herself a hotel room till we can rehome the snake. She will be mad at me too, so right now I am of the mind what she doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt her.\n\nTL;DR discovered my son has a GIANT python hidden away in his room. He can\u2019t give the snake the care it needs, so I am going to rehome it. How do I navigate the fallout with my son and wife?\n\nUPDATE: I posted this less than two hours after the discovery of the snake and tensions were high. Now I\u2019ve been to work and my son has been to school and we\u2019ve both had time to cool off and he\u2019s had time to think about his choices and actions. When I saw him again this evening he came right up to me and told me what I needed to know. \n\nu\/CatholicKay was right on the money with their comment. Apparently he got this snake two years ago at a reptile convention we went to together. He bought two snakes that day and I assumed they were both ball pythons, but apparently one was a baby burmese python. He said he knew it would get bigger but was unprepared for how quickly it grew. He has been spending most of his allowance and paycheques on feeding it several large rats at a time so it won\u2019t starve. Because he\u2019s had it so long he is very attached, but he was really stressed about it because he knew the tank was too small and he wasn\u2019t equipped to look after it. But he didn\u2019t want to tell me about it because he knew I would get mad and immediately make him give it up, which is exactly what happened.\n\nWe\u2019re going to tell my wife together in about an hour and have a family meeting. A lot of people have suggested getting her a hotel room which I think is a fantastic idea, I\u2019ll also be booking her a spa session. Some of your comments were a little hard to read, I have been a little hands-off about his snake collection, so from now on I will be more involved and supervise a little closer. I think he\u2019s learned his lesson though. He is no longer upset about losing his snake, but he is still upset about how he kept it in such awful conditions for so long.

I'm home with the kids a lot because of my job, and my wife's work schedule makes it so that I'm pretty much a single parent during the work week. I get up at 5:00 a.m. every weekday and 2 days a week I have to take the kids with me and drop them off at daycare. The other 3 weekdays, my wife keeps the one year old and takes the 4-year-old to preschool. And then when she leaves for work, she either brings me the 1-year-old at work or I go pick up the 1-year-old at daycare and then go get the 4-year-old from school. Every weekday, every week. She doesn't get home till anywhere from 9:00 to 10:30 p.m., so when I say I feel like a single parent I mean it. Even on the weekends my wife will sleep in till 9, 10 or sometimes 11:00 a.m., so I have to take both of the girls with me while I run errands or one of them needs to be somewhere like dance class or a bday party. My wife definitely does stuff, but I'm the parent who is home with both of the kids far more often and has to be the entertainment \/ caretaker.\n\nI'm hitting a wall more often than I used to though. When it was just the one kid I was not happy, but I managed. I survived. Now that there are two it is a much bigger headache. I don't have the energy or the patience I used to anymore, and I rarely have time to myself to go socialize with friends or even just disappear somewhere in the house. There are so many things around the house that are in disrepair or just cluttered because I'm the only person who's really taking care of them and I don't have the time. This is probably going to turn into more of a marriage advice thread, and that's fine. We've been there done that, including therapy and couples counseling. Her and I have not been on a date in months, we barely see each other on the weekends because one of us has passed out sleeping by 8:00 p.m. and it has just gotten so hard to find any respite from parenting. Babysitters are hard to come by, and we lean a lot on my mother which I don't want to constantly do because she already watches the kids for us multiple days a week so we can go to work.\n\nHow do people do it? Especially men. I don't get it. I don't feel like a man, even though I'm definitely supporting my family and doing everything in my power to let things be smooth sailing for the kids.

Second I fully understand most of my issues below are going to be from my own trauma experiences from being a loner kid who desperately wanted to fit in and never did.\n\nOk details - my daughter is just starting to come into her own uniqueness. She has ADHD so when she gets into stuff she goes all out. She is currently really into \"different\" things. She watches some anime, obsessed with FNAF and creepypasta characters... things like that. HOWEVER don't take that as she is a dark\/depressed kid because she isn't... she's freaking sunshine and loves to laugh and have fun. She's moody sometimes and can snap when overwhelmed but I feel like it is really typical responses for a hormonal teen with ADHD. \n\nThe problem right now is middle school kids are assholes. Our district is also very affluent and probably 90% of kids fall into the \"preppy\" category. Makes it hard when you are different. She's had kids start teasing her over things she likes. Then when she gets upset they say she might be a psychopath and to be careful. I obviously told her she needs to talk to the teacher. I want to give her a chance to do so before I reach out to the school. Which I may still do on Monday anyways.\n\nMy problem is trying to give her advice. I'm shit at it. I am socially akward with ADHD and I was into weird and different stuff growing up but never gave jnto it like she was. I tried so hard to fit in and never could. I always fell to the background and never wanted to bring attention to myself so I don't have the best mindset for this. I talked to her tonight about how much I love her uniqueness and made sure she knew that. I told her kids are jerks especially to those different from \"normal\" and that she is gojng to have to try and develop a thicker skin. I told her I love her sensitivity and it is an amazing quality but she may have to learn to put some armor on and know that the people who really matter accept her for who she is and what she likes.\n\nFortunately she has a few amazing friends this year who are into the same things so I know she doesn't feel lonely. I just don't know how else to help. I'm battling some major intrusive thoughts about how much easier things would be for her if she fit in better.

Both his mother and I work from home, and are in front of \ncomputers most days due to that, and then in addition, everyone in the house (my son, his mother, myself, his brother, and two family \nfriends who are living with us) are very electronics-friendly, and we all enjoy gaming as a hobby. We have a *lot* of electronics in the house - TVs, game consoles, computers, phones, tablets, etc. - so he's exposed to them every day, and that would be very hard to change without asking everyone here to completely change their habits, too.\n\nMy son has his own collection of electronics - he has a computer to himself (two, in fact - a desktop and a laptop), a Kindle Paperwhite, and a phone. He only just got the phone last summer; he was taking a trip for a week, and I didn't feel comfortable with that without him having one, so I got him one with the understanding that it was primarily for communication, not games.\n\nIs I knew it would (which is why he didn't have a phone prior to that), it immediately turned into a portable game system. By the time he got back from his trip, the thing was just full of games, and he would spend any moment that he wasn't doing something else on his phone, playing games. I discussed this with him a few times, but it never helped. At the end of the first semester of highschool (he's a freshman this year), his grades were obviously suffering - he went from being an A-B-C student to being a C-D-F student, and almost all of the low grades were due to missing homework and class participation... all \"lack of effort\" stuff, not \"don't understand the material\" stuff. I strongly suspect he was playing with his phone in classes.\n\nWhen I saw that, I got *very* mad (I admit that I lost my cool here), and took both his phone and computers away, on the understanding that he could have them back after the next quarter, if his grades were back to where they would normally be (or at least, if he was turning in all his work \/ etc.\n\nDuring February vacation, he slowly started taking more naps during the day (which I don't inherently have a problem with - I nap most days if I can get away with it, but this was getting concerning), and upon looking further into this, I found that he was staying up until everyone else had gone to bed, then pulling out the Chromebook his school provided to all of the students, and playing games, or watching Youtube. He'd stay up all night doing this, then sleep during the day, and repeat the next day. I took the Chromebook away, and tried to help him fix his sleep schedule, but even after school started up again, I caught him still staying up into the middle of the night, sleeping for a few hours before school, then napping again after school. I can't imagine he was staying awake *during* school.\n\nUnrelated to all of this, he has a history of lying a lot; I've also tried to work with him on this, and I thought it was getting better, \nbut he got caught lying about something to the whole family multiple times a day for a week or so, and I grounded him as punishment (taking away all of his electronics). I caught him a day later with a portable game system in his room, which I took away. Two days later, I noticed it wasn't where I'd put it (in my room), and found that he'd taken it back and was playing it all night. I took it away again.\n\nA few days later, he's staying up all night with the school Chromebook again. I took it away. Caught him with it again a few days later. Took it away again. By this point, 'grounded' had progressed to 'sitting at a desk where I can watch him', which is, I think, completely ridiculous for a 14 year old, but I feel like I'm running out of reasonable options for punishment... I feel like I can't let him out of my sight without him smuggling some electronic device into wherever he is. Today, I caught him sitting in the bathroom with his kindle (which he'd taken from my room).\n\nI'm really at wit's end at this point. I've tried to talk to him about this; increasing punishments aren't working, and I'm fairly sure at this point that it's straight up addiction, not just a teenager acting out.\n\nI'd really appreciate any advice - has anyone else dealt with anything similar? How did you handle it?\n\nEdit: Thank you for the advice; I've had a long talk with my son tonight and we're going to try something new that will hopefully help with some of the problems we've been having.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678572429.0},{"title":"Has anyone ended a relationship when your kids and families were so attached?","author":"Offroadingscientist","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Parenting\/comments\/11ol8aq\/has_anyone_ended_a_relationship_when_your_kids\/","text":"My buddy met his fianc\u00e9(Brittany) when his daughter was 2 months old..

My parents are going and invited us along, but I just think driving 6 hours, not getting much sleep, I won\u2019t enjoy the vacation and will be too tired and would rather just stay home then go through the stress of traveling and not being able to do much. \n\nI told him my parents are driving from out of state and aren\u2019t going\/shouldn\u2019t have to spend their vacation staying behind with baby so we can go out and have vacation, so one of us would pretty much need to stay at the hotel most of the time because it\u2019s not like you can really take a baby snorkeling and what not.

Feeling so sad for my daughter who is 11 and in 6th grade. Shes struggling with friends. She has a heart of gold and is the sweetest, kindest person. But she\u2019s on the quieter side and not super confident. I don\u2019t think anyone is mean to her, but she is constantly left out and overlooked. Even so, I havent worried too much as she seemed happy in school and has usually had a friend or two.\n\nHowever we just had an issue in school that I really worry is going to affect her self-esteem going forward. The school is having a service day in May, and 6th grade is running a grade-wide flea market. She was really excited about it. About a month ago they were told to form groups of 5 people max. They get a booth and choose to sell something. She formed a group with 3 other girls right away when the project was first announced. \n\nA couple of days ago, out of the blue, her closest \u201cfriend\u201d in the group told my daughter the girls don\u2019t want her in their group anymore. I don\u2019t know the other two girls. They gave my daughter no reason why, and she said she honestly doesnt know what happened. They pretty much left her hanging with barely any time left to make another plan and it\u2019s very difficult at this point to figure something out because all of the kids have formed groups. They have to turn in their forms stating their groups next week and she\u2019s panicking. She told 1 other friend what happened. The friend considered leaving her group to work with my daughter because she felt badly, then changed her mind. Her friend\u2019s group is already full.\n\nMy daughter is so embarrassed that she doesn\u2019t have anyone to work with and doesn\u2019t want to reach out to anyone else in fear of more rejection. The students can work alone, but she told me it\u2019s going to be embarrassing standing at a booth all by herself.\n\nI\u2019m just so so angry for her. This \u201cfriend\u201d who told her she couldn\u2019t be in their group anymore has been a bit of an issue in the past. I was already very weary of her. Last year she was making some not so nice comments to my daughter. It bothered my daughter and they drifted. Then they became close again in the fall. They have been friends for several years and I know and like her parents who are the nicest people. And since my daughter has so few friends, and because this girl comes from a really lovely, kind family, I felt like it was worth giving her another chance. I\u2019m just SO angry with this girl. I understand if she doesn\u2019t want to be close with my daughter anymore, but to backstab her and leave her hanging like this for a school project, when she knows there\u2019s no time left to figure something else out, and to isolate her is so cruel.\n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s the best plan of action for my daughter in terms of this project and her mental health. I\u2019ve reached out to the teachers in charge who were great and offered her to be a student helper for the event. She isn\u2019t sure if she is interested. She\u2019s not confident and I\u2019m worried that seeing tons of her peers having fun in their groups will make her feel worse, even if she is busy with other duties. I\u2019m sad to say that I\u2019m honestly debating keeping her home that day. Just taking her out for a fabulous day, the two of us. This isn\u2019t a graded project. She will be missing a fun day at school though. And I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s ridiculous to keep her home. Should I have her stick it out? Is it teaching her to just hide from her problems? \n\nShe doesn\u2019t deserve this. She\u2019s such a nice kid, so easy to get along with, so loyal, always thinks of others first. The lack of friends truly baffles me. I\u2019m just so so beyond angry for her. Angry that the school left the whole grade to their own devices to choose groups (seems like a disaster waiting to happen. I\u2019m sure there have been other problems with kids being left out). Angry that my sweet daughter who I\u2019m almost positive did nothing wrong, has been isolated and these kids just decided they don\u2019t like her and want her out of the group. That her \u201cfriend\u201d of several years didn\u2019t see how wrong it was and speak up for her. Angry that she feels alone and that she can\u2019t enjoy this fun day at school now.

I like her friend she's always been nice to us. Only problem is that I don't like going out downtown. I grew up in the suburbs and never liked going downtown, too much traffic, too much people, etc... Typical suburban stuff..My problem is that I told my gf that it would be a bad idea with the baby. Even if most time he is ok he can get grumpy (and at 4 months I think he start being offset), a lot of time in restaurant there is a lot of music and noise and everything. We also live 1h away from the place they want to go out so that makes it quite a long ride for having dinner and then going back home since we will not be partying.I feel bad about it because there this other couple of friends that have a kid a few weeks younger and they said they will be there. I kind of feel like the party pooper for not wanting to go out... but that seems like a reasonable thing to do since that is no kid friendly environment and if my kid start crying there is 1h trip to go home.. and I'm not talking of finding parking and moving the kid around if we go downtown.Do you think I'm using my kid since I don't like going out or I'm actually making sense ?  \nEdit : My gf is breastfeeding and we didn't succeed at giving me anything else so at some point the baby will have to drink at the restaurant.

Before that, she lived with her grandparents. Her bio mom is addicted to drugs and we know she did drugs early in the pregnancy. When she first came to live with us, she had a speech delay, but that has seemed to improve.

She shows several symptoms, but most concerning is her severe tantrums that can last ten minutes or more. During these tantrums, she often smacks her face and bangs her head on the floor, and nothing we can do or say will snap her out of it. Eventually she just wears herself out. \n\nShort of giving her everything she wants to avoid tantrums, we don't know what to do about her behavior.

And with the second kid on the way, something clicked, and it dawned that there will be a time when the trips will be one-sided and the grandparents won't be able to make the trek.  On the flip side, housing and cost of living would be substantially cheaper moving closer home as well.  But other than that there isn't a lot going on moving closer.

M daughter requires my attention all the time and expects me to always interrupt whatever I am doing to give her attention or do whatever she needs.\n\nExamples:\n\n\\- I work in home office.  Sometimes I am in meetings (sometimes even with my boss) and she comed in the room talking to me or writing me notes, mostly asking help with online purchases (which she does pay for, but still needs me to sign in on PayPal or give her my cc number). I have zero chance at telling her the expenses and shopping are too much because, as I said, it is her own money and she just won't listen. Every item must be purchased immediately, there is always something (to be fair she is a collector and sometimes these items are gone pretty fast).\n\n\\- that goes on all day long. It came to a point in which I can't do anything for longer than 30 minutes without an interruption, not only for the purchases but anything. Sometimes I am in the bathroom or having a shower and she is knocking at the door demanding to get in (her father used to do the same and honestly this is one of the reasons why we're no longer together). I have started asking her if she wants to use it before I go, and still,she says no and then suddenly she does.\n\n\\- I don't remember when was the last time o have watched one single episode of whatever series it is without her entering the room and suddenly getting in front of the TV and talking to me or to our dogs and asking me to see what they are doing. Just as if I am nor allowed any free time.\n\n\\- in the rare occasions she goes to her father, who is super negligent, she still calls me because she doesn't get any food \/ any food of her liking (as I said he is negligent so it is not always about the taste). No chance on calling child care, i am a foreign innour country and they took his side when I tried and said I have to share parenting and can't have my daughter full time.\n\n\\- since I can make my own schedule, she expects me to split my work to take care of her needs. On the one day she has slept at a colleague,she asked me to bring her things (which was fine, as it was a spontaneous decision to finish an important school project) and even though I called her three times to cross check the list and asked her if there was anything else, and she said no, she still called me at 11 pm to say she has forgotten a very important thing (if she didn't have that she would have gotten a zero), so next day I had to split my work again to go deliver the thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe don't have a tight schedule at home. At some point I just gave up cooking family meals and cook separately for us and for her. She eats in her bedroom. If I try to go in her bedroom to ask if she needs anything before tending to my stuff, she demonstrates annoyance and says she doesn't need anything and asks me to leave.... then 20 minutes on she remembers she does want something (food, cc number, attention) even though I am doing something else already.\n\n\\- sometimes I am trading to one of her problems and I am not finished eith that, then comes the next one already. Yesterday I tried telling her that this was nor okay and she was immediately offended. This is what happens most of thr time, then I feel guilty and end up doing whatever it was. Yesterday things escalated in a huge argument and I didn't handle it well, but quite honestl I am on the verge of exploding. I can't think of taking a trip, going out with friends (she will 100% call me asking when I am home) or anything else. I live at her disposal. And I have no life. She has no friends around for reasons I can understand (she is gay and her friends at school made jokes about it), so I know it is not easy. The friends she has are on discord and online games and live abroad, and this makes it all more difficult as she only gets to talk to them very late due to different timezones (yes, you guessed it: she doesn't sleep early and there is noise while I am trying to and she is tired for school the next day).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am neurodivergent and quite honestly I am sure she is too.  In our country there is a 5 year list for a diagnose, so we are both untreated. I love my daughter to death - as you see, I love for her - and she is a great kid otherwise, with very cool principles, intelligent (only As at school), but this is killing me. I can't get her to open up, she never wants to talk about feelings (as I tried to talk to her to see if she is feeling lonely). Then she drops the \"this is all normal when you have a kid,\" making me feel guilty and a terrible parent. It is normal, but on the other hand,I don't think it is normal to this extent and nor if any attempt to talk is fruitful or not if whenever I try to talk to her I will be sent off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReally, I will be grateful for any word you can offer me.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678525851.0},{"title":"How to raise a bilingual child?","author":"Disastrous_Duty_843","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Parenting\/comments\/11nset7\/how_to_raise_a_bilingual_child\/","text":"I'm Chinese and my partner is British and we are living in the UK.

He had little trouble telling us stories and doing full sentences.\n\nAbout two months ago my wife and I noticed that our two and a half year old was starting to stutter a little bit with some of his words or drawing out the first sound of the first word in a phrase (Mmmmmy toy) but we didn\u2019t think too much of it. \n\nFast forward to about a week ago and we noticed that the stutter was happening more frequently and now he rarely talks in phrases at all. He will give one word answers for most things, several phrases but we\u2019ve noticed that if he starts to stutter during a longer phrase he will usually stop talking entirely. He will occasionally keep moving his mouth as if he\u2019s talking but he can\u2019t seem to get the words out. \n\nThis has concerned me and my wife considerably. We started taking more deliberate actions this week and got him seen by his pediatrician and he did acknowledge that is was a drastic difference but wasn\u2019t overly concerned. He did several neurological tests (touching finger tips, eye exam, etc) and all of those tests were normal. He did give us a referral to a neurologist but according to my wife she thinks it was more to ease our minds and wasn\u2019t entirely necessary. \n\nOur other son had a speech delay and has a speech therapist, so we discussed our youngest son\u2019s issue with her as well and she didn\u2019t think it was too concerning yet and that it is more likely that it is developmental but wasn\u2019t able to do an evaluation since we need to go through the proper channels first. \n\nWe have also got the ball rolling with early intervention to try and get him evaluated to try and get as many answers as we can.\n\nMy mind of course wanders to the worst case scenarios because I don\u2019t have enough information to rule them out.\n\nI was wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this with their kids.

I was 19 when I got pregnant and didn't realize I needed to reparent myself. I was not mentally or emotionally stable enough. Although I tried my best, I had yet to go through healing my own childhood trauma. Resulting in my projection onto her. I was self-centered and self-absorbed.  I couldn't commit to anything, and I always thought the grass was greener on the other side. I made mistakes. Something I did do, though, was see the need to better myself emotionally. There was a lot of work to do, a lot of lessons. Alot of applying the knowledge I've learned. And it's now at the point where I try too hard to right my wrongs. I projected the same pain I experienced from my mother. I know how painful it was, yet for a good 8 years of her life, I actively fvcked things up with my anger and my impulses and my lack of self-awareness. It's resulted in me trying way too hard. It's resulted in me buying her love and allowing a lack of rules, and I've given her so much control because of guilt. I don't know if I'll ever be able to be truly respected by her, and honestly, I know what that feels like, especially at her age. My mother and I have a much more abundant relationship now. However, it's because of the extensive work I've completed on my subconscious. I'm too self aware now. I do know she's a teen, and I'm learning to allow her to be her, learning not to take her responses as something personal. She is changing, growing, and trying to find out who she is. At 13, I was way more out of pocket than she is. She's a wonderful person, and she's 10000 x better than me, and I'm thankful. Outside of being a mother, I am a healer, and I help others through the same things I'm experiencing.  I show people where their pain is, and I teach them how to accept their past and actively move towards feeling more whole. However, I needed to get this out. I needed to know if anyone had experienced this, too. Where they feel they made a mistake and feel like there is a part of this parent child relationship that isn't repairable right now..

She has mental health issues and delayed emotional maturity that has been placed at age 14-15 by her long-time therapist. We have been trying for years to follow the instructions of her therapist to help her work toward an independent adult life, but she still has a long way to go. We still have to remind her to do her daily chore of unloading the dishwasher, to practice basic hygiene, to take her psychiatric medication, etc. She is diabetic, yet despite her doctor's warnings she still drinks soda, eats candy, skips medication doses, refuses to do even light exercise like a walk around the block, etc. On top of all this, she compulsively lies for no reason at all, and is so impulsive that it's frightening. When a young man she liked approved her friend request on social media when she was 19, she blew up the phones of mutual friends in the middle of the night, telling them about her plans to get married and making up stories about how I'm bff's with his mom and we've been trying to get them together for years. Over the last few years she has struggled off and on with an Internet pornography habit that I can only describe as excessive and alarming. (At 15 and 16 she was sexting and sending nudes with online predators and giving personal details that put her and the family as a whole at risk; at 18 she was sending sexually explicit texts in gaming apps without even questioning the ages of fellow gamers, etc.) Her younger sisters have been exposed to things we would never want them exposed to as a result of all of this. She sometimes steals, hoards food, picks holes in her skin and plucks out hairs, and struggles with suicidal ideation. At 20 she was terrified for me to leave her home alone for even 5 minutes to check the mail. \n\nAll of these behaviors have necessitated us keeping a closer eye on her than we would otherwise be comfortable with when dealing with an adult child. We have followed her therapist's instructions to the letter\nwhen it comes to the boundaries in place for her, and everything has been by mutual agreement. No part of us enjoys this. This should be the time of our lives that we can enjoy a friendship with her. It's exhausting to have to still be raising someone her age. Despite her emotional and mental struggles, she is highly intelligent, which adds a layer of complexity to the situation. \n\n\nMidway through last year, we believed we were finally starting to see progress in her life. She  got her first job, started taking her first college class, and finally got her learner's driving permit after years of refusing to do any of this. \n\nShe recently began dating a guy a few years older than her. He is highly educated and has a great job. At first, he had us totally fooled, but now it's obvious he is extremely toxic. He is very manipulative and half's her when she calls him out. She has quit therapy, they text and talk on the phone all night and day, and he constantly tells her that we are just trying to control her and she should move out, despite having literally $0 in savings. When he wants to see her, she blows off school and calls in sick to work. When he goes on business trips, she wears the same pair of pajamas for days at a time and lies on the couch for 20+ hrs a day refreshing her email every 20 seconds to see if he messaged her. Every moment he isn't working, she is glued to him. When they have fights, she becomes suicidal. She skips out on family time and breaks commitments to family and friends, then gets angry if people do things without her.  \n\nWe have tried to steer her gently and otherwise  keep our mouths shut about it for fear of pushing her further away and closer to him. It's been 4-5 months and they are completely obsessed with each other. He tells her they are going to get married, but of course there's no ring. (Thank God) She has resisted our suggestions that she consider an IUD or other long-term birth control, in light of the fact that not only has she never wanted children, but her PCP had been clear that a pregnancy in her current state of health could be fatal. She says contraception is unnecessary because they have decided to wait till marriage, which she believes is imminent, and since he wants kids she has decided to have some for him after the wedding. \n\nWhen he visits our home, they constantly overdo the PDA even though her sisters repeatedly express how uncomfortable they are. Even worse, she has become verbally and emotionally abusive to her younger siblings, both alone and in front of the boyfriend. Meanwhile, she confided in me that when they are alone in the car or at his house, he has groped her on several occasions, and they almost had sex twice, once in a car on a busy street in a rough part of town at 8 pm, and once in broad daylight at the lake in a nearby state park. \n\nOur \"rules\" for her are very simple, and most are more like requests. Unload the dishwasher every evening. Help put away groceries. Clean up after herself. Use her laptop for social media and YouTube instead of her phone (per therapist, will help keep her safe from lack of impulse control). Go to school and work as scheduled. Let us know what time to expect her home and call if late.  She pays no rent and yet cannot respect those simple requests. I went shopping with my mother the other day and we ended up at the coffee shop where she works, and I got an earful from another employee about the completely made up sob stories she had been spreading all over town about me and her father. She literally expects me to pack her lunch and drive her everywhere and sit next to her bed while she sleeps because her anxiety is so bad she's terrified, yet is telling her co-workers that I'm an abusive psycho. I just don't know how much longer I can do this. If she was a typical 21yo, we would tell her it's time for her to start paying her share of the bills and start exploring getting her own place. But she's not well. \n\nTLDR: Emotionally delayed and unstable 21 yo daughter wants autonomy of an independent adult, but no responsibilities, and can't stop making destructive choices.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678470990.0},{"title":"Tongue-tied Toddler","author":"machetecobra","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Parenting\/comments\/11o1q77\/tonguetied_toddler\/","text":"Looking for any advice or experiences from people who have had a similar situation.

It did not, and they told me to bring it up if it ever did. It never did. \n\nHe went to the dentist for the first time today and the hygienist noted it and asked a couple of questions regarding speech and digestion. I said that he has a noticeable lisp and he has problems with digestion but also has Celiac. She brings in one of the dentists to look and they take pictures to show another dentist at the practice who fixes tongue ties in babies. The dentist says that she's surprised it wasn't fixed earlier because it's so tight. His tongue isn't able to move much at all and it can cause problems with speech and digestion. However, he might need to go to an oral surgeon instead because of his age and the anesthesia likely needed. They are going to confer with the other dentist and get back to me. \n\nHas anyone else had a tongue tie become a problem later in life? Should I have fought harder to have it fixed when he was still a baby? Do you have a tongue tied toddler who is managing to overcome it without medical intervention (just therapeutic)?\n\nI saved up money to take him to a special children's dentist because we don't have any dental insurance and he is usually scared of medical type facilities so I wanted people used to dealing with little kids.

I tried to sit at the other end of the train, because I really did not want to have anything similar happen a second time. Well, the he saw us and then came over and handed me a bill for a new hearing aid, over $2000. Apparently my kid had broken the one she grabbed.\n\nI really don't have that kind of money laying around, but I'm assuming neither does the teen. I know he lives in one of the not-so-nice areas that the train passes through because of the stop that he gets on at. All he handed me was an invoice for a new hearing aid, and then at the bottom it says \"checks are payable to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\", which I'm assuming is one of his parents. I'm not sure if I will face legal repercussions if I don't pay this or try to pay it at a later date.","upvote_ratio":0.38,"created_utc":1678547641.0},{"title":"How to cope with bringing children to live on a dying planet?","author":"CatterpillarCarl","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Parenting\/comments\/11o3b4q\/how_to_cope_with_bringing_children_to_live_on_a\/","text":"I\u2019m a new parent and since having my little one, I\u2019m feeling a lot of dread about the state of the world.

I also have a 4 year old daughter. I currently breastfeed my newborn, something I didn\u2019t do with my first daughter. Lately, I find myself uncomfortable and cringing whenever my 4 year old touches me, which of course she is doing increasingly since the baby has been born. and I feel AWFUL about it. but I just physically cannot stand the sensation. I don\u2019t mind when my partner touches me (it\u2019s not nearly as frequently as my older daughter does) and I typically don\u2019t mind the newborn breastfeeding (sometimes if she is cluster feeding I get extremely touched out). I do my best to still cuddle with my oldest so she doesn\u2019t feel rejected but sometimes I simply cannot stand it and can be snippy about it and am a little short in my reaction to being touched. She is also in a phase of deliberately doing things i ask her not to do, so saying \u201cplease don\u2019t touch me right now\u201d doesn\u2019t work well. I am diagnosed with OCD as well and of course children have dirty, sticky hands that they shove in their mouth and wipe their nose with, which can be slightly triggering for me. Has anyone else experienced this? Is there anything I can do on my end to either more effectively communicate with her about an appropriate time to touch me or desensitize myself to the touching? i\u2019m not a particularly physically affectionate person in the first place and never have been but I do constantly tell her how much I love her and how proud I am of her.

I'm questioning whether I'm crazy or not for being kinda bothered by this...\n\nMy kids all have benchmark testing at school tomorrow. My youngest, who does struggle with anxiety, ended up crying tonight at bedtime because he's so worried about that test. He is very smart but doesn't always test well. I've reassured him that it isn't a grade that goes in the grade book, but he's still worried about it. He's in 3rd grade this year but it's his first year in public school. We were Covid homeschoolers for 2 years and he went to private kindergarten prior to that.\n\nI think part of the reason he's so stressed about it, is because the last time they took benchmarks, the kids who \"moved up a level\" with their score compared to the previous assessment got to go to a fun pizza party during school hours. I guess my son's score didn't improve enough, so he didn't get to go. He was so sad about that dang pizza party. \n\nI don't know if they're doing the pizza party thing this time, but I'm just kind of annoyed by it. Some kids just don't test well, and these aren't actual grades, and watching their friends get to go to a pizza party during the school day makes kids who are trying their best feel bad. \n\nAm I being dumb? Like, this isn't something I'd say anything to the school about, but I'm annoyed enough to complain on Reddit. Maybe I'm just missing our peaceful homeschool days of much less testing.

We expect he will start to sleep longer periods in his bed going forward, and my husband is due to take some time off work shortly, so he'll start to settle him in his bed rather than let him come back in with us.\n\nOur bedtime routine is - bath time with mum, mum gets him dressed and ready for bed, then hand over to dad who does story time and settles him.\n\nMy concern is that at the beginning of the night, when we start the routine, he starts shouting and screaming for me. I can't put him down to sleep as I probably won't be able to do this with a newborn, and we want to get him used to my husband doing bedtime. It's quite upsetting to hear him so distressed.

Last year, our dog passed away due to cancer. I'm finally ready to move on, and had been discussing getting a new dog with my son.

His response was, \"Okay.\" and we left it at that.\n\nThis week, I happened to be introduced to a rescue puppy who was available for adoption. The dog had a calm, gentle disposition and wasn't a barker. These are important considerations for my son's sensory issues. I immediately put in an application with the rescue, and it was accepted. My son was at his mother's house that day, so I called him in the evening and told him about the dog. He was furious. He started crying, loudly, and I overheard him tell his mother that I \"bought a dog behind his back.\"\n\nSince then, he's been adamantly against the dog. He regularly asks when we can take it back. He tells me \"life was better without that dumb dog\" or \"I don't have fun here now that the dog is here.\" I have tried to set boundaries for everyone, but it's going to be an adjustment.

Now I\u2019m just fighting a 30 pound terror who gets stronger and faster by the day (yes he is and always has been an enormous baby). I\u2019ve made every excuse for him possible: teething, growing pains, etc, but it\u2019s none of those things. He\u2019s growing and thriving and it\u2019s not dietary. \n\nHe\u2019s been throwing royal tantrums since about 8 months. Changing his diaper or clothes takes two people. You can\u2019t clip his nails or wipe his face without a meltdown. After months and months of fighting sleep and no sleep for me, I\u2019ve given in and all of his sleep is now contact. I hold him for every nap, and he sleeps on my chest at night. So we are at least getting sleep now.\n\nRecently I was at a friends house and her baby was sitting content in his high chair eating from the spoon and I almost cried. My baby had never done that. If he\u2019s in his high chair he hits the spoon away and screams. He will eat, but I have to hold him and feed him what I\u2019m eating (no baby food for him). Her baby would also just sit on the floor and play with toys. Mine has never done this either. He has zero interest in toys and cannot sit still no matter what. He has to be in constant motion, and the only \u201cfun\u201d he has are ripping apart books and magazines, going through drawers and cabinets, and destroying his playroom. If I put something away, it becomes his life\u2019s mission to knock it down again.\n\nIf you stack his stacking cups in front of him, he becomes ENRAGED and screams while knocking them over. He yells while he tries to pull all the hair off our extremely patient cat (I say \u201cgentle!\u201d like 500 times per day). He whines constantly and wants held and carried around but that doesn\u2019t really make him happy either. He rarely smiles at me (he does sometimes but not like other babies). He stone-faces just about everyone he sees. You can get a smile and laugh from him but you have to WORK for it.\n\nI\u2019ve been very anxious he has autism or something else is going on. Our pediatrician isn\u2019t concerned because he\u2019s hitting all of his milestones. He just seems\u2026angry and miserable. And I\u2019m exhausted from giving him everything and getting nothing back.\n\nI do want to add that whenever my mom comes over he TRANSFORMS into a different baby. Smiles, laughs, cooperation, interactive play. She will take him into the playroom and it seems like a different baby. The second I walk in though, he starts whining and wants held and seems miserable again. I think I\u2019ve googled \u201cdoes my baby hate me\u201d 100 times.\n\nAnyone else with an angry baby?

I was unsure of what my role was, my husband told me I would never be expected to be their mother simply a stepmom. The kids also expressed similar views and I agreed.\n\nI became more of a cool aunt figure but things changed when we got married. Slowly more and more parental responsibilities started getting dumped on me until I became the primary parent. Yet regardless of this, I was never respected as a parental figure.\n\nFor example, I was expected to take the kids to school, help them with their homework, feed them, go to parent-teacher meetings, arrange their doctor appointments, arrange their afterschool activities, buy them new clothes, and such. Yet I was not allowed to disciple them whenever they acted out (nothing major just being teens) and got told I was \"overstepping\".\n\nWhenever the kids would get mad at me and call me names I would not be allowed to ground them or anything like that. I also wasn't welcome by my in-laws and was iced out of family pictures that my in-laws take every year for their Christmas cards. When I spoke out I was told I was being cruel and \"overstepping\" as a step-parent by trying to replace their mom (I was the only spouse not included in the pictures).\n\nI want to make it clear I never asked or wanted to be called mom or anything like that. I am very respectful towards their mom, we have pictures of her in the house and I take the kids to visit her often, we also have her family over to see the kids. I am the one arranging all these visits mind you. So I don't want to replace her just to be respected as a stepmom.\n\nThe final straw was the 12F school science project, we had worked on that project for months, and I often stayed up till 3 AM working on it with her. Yet when she won 1st place she thanked everyone but me. When I pointed it out my husband said I was being rude and overstepping. We had a huge fight. I ended up saying I was done, if I wasn't going to be respected as a parental figure I would stop acting like one.\n\nIt's very confusing for the youngest as well, she asked once if she could call me mom and the other kids freaked out and started yelling at me accusing me of \"brainwashing\" her. I wasn't, it was simply confusing for her as I was acting like a mom, doing all the mom things yet didn't even get treated as a member of the family. For example, my husband and his late wife used to go on a family vacation every year to the mountains, he and the kids still go but I'm not invited as it's a \"family tradition\".\n\nSo I stopped doing everything and now everyone is mad at me. My husband thinks I'm the AH because I'm being cruel to the kids but I don't think so. I'm simply going back to our original agreement.","upvote_ratio":0.97,"created_utc":1678289418.0},{"title":"Leaving a baby with separation anxiety","author":"Isabellajohn_1995","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Parenting\/comments\/11n72x6\/leaving_a_baby_with_separation_anxiety\/","text":"My baby is 6 months old and I think she has developed separation anxiety in a matter of weeks.

Upon asking what was wrong and why she was crying so much and that she only had to wait a moment to get a hug, she told us to leave her alone.\n\nThis isn't the only issue, she has also been trying to \"be the parent\" to our older boy. She will constantly on a daily basis tell him he needs to do certain things or that he's not doing what he's supposed to regardless of how many times we tell her that we will guide him. She does this even when it comes to chores where she will stop her chores just to monitor him even when are currently facilitating him.\n\nShe has even started to try to gather attention by attempting to self inflict harm to herself just to garner attention and once she gets the attention she desires she stops. She will accuse people of hurting her when she hasn't been hurt. She also doesn't apologize when she accidently and\/or intentionally hurts someone else.\n\nWe try to give both of them the best living possible, but im at wits end as to what i should do.

Every job shes had she either quit because it was too \"stressful\" or fired for behavioral issues (arguments with coworkers, supervisors etc).  But tells me I'm lucky that all I have to do is go to work. \n\nAnd That statement is entirely untrue.  At least to me, (which I keep to myself) I feel like I'm doing EVERYTHING.  when Im not at work, she sleeps in, goes out with her friends for dinner&drinks, lays around and watches TV.  I'm doing all the household chores, managing the finances, maintaining our cars, yard work, scheduling things for the kids, playing and actively engaging with the kids.

If our 2 year old gets a little whiney around bed time, she will literally tell her to shut up and leave her alone. \n\nHere's a few phrases I can recall just from yesterday alone:\n\n\"You're about to piss me off cause you don't fucking listen then you really won't like me\"\n\n\"Do it again and I'll spank your ass\"\n\n\"Clean up your mess or ill throw away every toy you have\"\n\n\"What the fuck is the problem with you and listening do we need to take you back to the hospital?\" (After a traumatic surgery recovery)\n\nI'll tell you the problem with our kids' behavior.. the \"Rules\" change day by day and the kids are confused as to what's ok and what's not.

My partner and I have an infant and a 5 year old. My partner and I have been together for 15 years. My partner has ADHD and doesn't always realize when I need help, but has been working hard over the years to be more mindful of our shared labor and to help make things more equal. On top of that I have trouble asking for help, which certainly doesn't help things.\n\nFrom the moment SIL's first was born, I had somehow become the default parent at family functions. I was never asked to watch the kid(s), yet somehow, I ended up being the only one watching, feeding, and changing them. When I would be distracted playing a game or reading a story to them, SIL would seemingly disappear into thin air for hours at a time. As it turns out, she would either be scrolling Instagram on her phone in another room, getting drunk, dozing by the pool, or any combination of the 3, depending on the season. \n\nOver the years, I have sprinted to keep her toddlers from slipping through the gate to the swimming pool, pulled countless small non-food items from their mouths, acted as a human shield between the kids and a temperamental neighborhood dog, yanked them out of the road while a car is coming... the list goes on. If one of SIL's kids gets injured she laughs it off and I am left to care for them (wasp stings, food poisoning, burns from touching a hot stove, and a nasty bump on the head that I'm eternally grateful wasn't a concussion). \n\nHer mom, my MIL, rents a big beach house for the whole family for 1 week every few summers. The last trip was when my oldest was an infant, and sure enough, I was the default parent. I fed, bathed, and entertained all of the kids the whole week. She slipped down to the pool with their other sister while I got dressed in the morning, started day drinking, and that was that. My MIL and I took the kids on a walk to the beach every day and my partner helped with our own baby, but apart from that, I was on my own with her kids. She spent all of 10 minutes with my baby during that whole week, on our final day, as we were all packing up. \n\nWe have another big beach vacation coming up this summer. Looking at the sleeping arrangements, I am in for another week of default parenting, this time for 5 kids. My partner, our infant, and I will have a room that is connected to the big kids' room by a shared bathroom. Nobody else has a shared bathroom and instead has their own floors, including the SIL in question and their other childfree sister. I am still dealing with some long-term injury from the birth of my youngest and have trouble getting around, let alone chasing my own little ones. I adore SIL's kids and would do absolutely anything for them, but the thought of being totally abandoned with 5 kids again is making me want to cry. \n\nGiven all of that, would it be wrong of me to ask SIL to take responsibility over her own kids this year? How would I go about doing that in a respectful way? My partner has already agreed that we can and will move to a hotel if things get out of hand with his family (there are other issues not mentioned here). Would that be out of line?\n\n\nEdit: I've talked to my MIL, SIL, and husband. We've asked SIL to swap rooms with us so she'll be in the room connected to her own kids. MIL has shot down us switching rooms with her or SIL2 because... reasons? SIL has yet to respond on whether she'll take the room connected to her kids. If she doesn't, we will be looking for accommodations nearby.\n\nI don't want to avoid time with the niblings altogether. My oldest wants to be with them, and they want to spend time with us. It's not fair to punish SIL's kids by avoiding them or depriving them of time with their cousins just because their parents suck. Our plan for now is to take our own kids on outings and tell the niblings that their mom\/dad can take them too if they'd like to join. Those kiddos don't get much affection or attention at home and I don't want to deprive them of it from my family. \n\nMeals and personal care requests will be redirected to their own parents. Safety issues will be handled in the moment but with many loud exclamations that very clearly hold SIL and BIL accountable for their actions or lack thereof. For the agreed upon times that we do watch the kids... I'll be sure to pack that time with plenty of crafts to take home involving glitter, splatter paint, slime, and noisemakers\/homemade instruments. \n\nTo those that offered actual constructive advice, thank you! It's helpful to have an outside perspective to really reinforce what needs to be done. It can be hard to see a situation for what it is when you've been in the thick of it for so many years. Frog in a pot, and all that. \n\nTo those whose \"advice\" was vague and\/or dismissive, I'm glad that you have always had a good family dynamic and have not had to deal with situations like this with your family or origin or your in-laws. I'm happy for you that you are always able to stand up for yourself and have never had to deal with unmanaged\/undermanaged mental health situations. You might find a good home for yourselves in r\/thanksimcured.\n\nEdit 2: Well, we asked, and they've answered: \"We just want to make fun family memories and if the house isn't good enough for you then we should just cancel the trip altogether!\" Yes, they are being serious. Yes, it is manipulative. Yes, my husband has suddenly flip flopped from agreeing with me to what his family is saying.\n\nYes, I need a drink.

Basically just different ways - he's snapped a few in half which is just some duct tape and that was an easy fix. He would take the ear pads off of some and usually depending on the headphones I can fix it. A lot of them have shorted out, I'm not 100% sure he's fully at fault for this but he does lay on them when he's in bed. I told him not to and explained to him this might be why that is happening but I still catch him doing it. When he was using wired ones the plug-in would break off in his phone which made me switch to wireless. I'm thinking he's probably being too rough.

But I also want to room share until she rolls both ways. Right now she ONLY rolls from her back to her belly so that makes me nervous because when she rolls on to her belly she doesn't know how to roll back onto her back. This is my problem: She is actually a pretty big baby. 90 percentile in height and weight. She can't fully stretch her arms out in the mini crib and she usually likes to stretch out when she sleeps. Its not a huge problem yet. She will wake up sometimes if she hits the sides. But with the rolling she gets pushed against a side because there is not enough space (but she has only ever rolled when awake so far). I also worry that she will get too use to sleeping in our room and the older she gets, it will be harder to transition her out. I don't think I could fit the big crib in our room either \n\nSo my options are:\nA) move her into her nursery at night with her full size crib and move our guest bed in there as well.

I had my child when I was 18 and it\u2019s been a long journey because of my parents. I feel like I need to post details or context because if not this story can go in a  different direction. I grew up with overbearing parents, I was very sheltered and my father is a really controlling man. I must admit when I got pregnant it came into a shock my mom said I couldn\u2019t terminate so I had a baby and now I hate myself. It\u2019s been 8 years and I can\u2019t seem to be what my daughter needs and my parents make it extremely hard. The other day my daughters father asked if he can take my daughter to sleepover (which my daughter hardly does because my parents don\u2019t permit her to sleepover) anyways I ask my daughter which she immediately starts a tantrum because she\u2019s not use to sleeping over and my mom heard this and Which my mom heard and my mom confronts me and says that my daughter doesn\u2019t need to go and if she says no then it\u2019s a no. I tell my daughters father this and it makes him mad since he says my parents aren\u2019t my daughters parents. He is right so me and him have a talk about what happened and how we can work to make it better\u2026 well we agreed to start letting her sleepover since I\u2019m always with my daughter and he also need to be involve and wants to be more involved. I go to take a shower and i guess he calls my daughter and asks her again if she wants to sleepover this is where my father goes and starts punching the bathroom door saying if my daughter goes with her father that they\u2019ll take my daughter away and that I will be kicked out.. my mom goes inside the restroom while I\u2019m showering and opens the shower curtains and tells me that I\u2019m kicked out and that my daughter is staying. My mom has said many times if I leave my daughter stays and she\u2019ll take over custody. This is one of the many stories I have where my parents take control and i don\u2019t know how to take my life by my owns hands, My parents are such a different story because I\u2019ve barely realized during the pandemic how toxic they are.

We have just sought out help from a doctor and we are currently looking for a shrink with an available time for him to talk to. We have also sought out couples therapy and went once so far to try to work on our issues.\nNow the problem I need advice for is that my husband is a bad father to our son (3). I wish I could say it in a gentler way, but unfortunately i can\u2019t. He has put all primary care onto me since day one (diaper changes, nightly wake ups, bed time, bath time etc.) which I was fine with since he was loving towards our kid the rest of the time. However since our kid was under a year he has understandably shown a preference to me, since I\u2019m his primary care taker. I\u2019ve tried to involve my husband and explain that this is because our kid is used to me, but to no avail. \n\nSince our kid was 1 year my husband found a new and time consuming hobby and has spent 2-4 hours on this daily, meaning he has barely seen our child. When he does our son doesn\u2019t show much interest in daddy since daddy is tired and sits on his phone or watches TV and he tends to want our son to conform to his idea of fun and \u2018be quiet because daddy is tired\u2019. This has grown worse in time and now my son won\u2019t hug or kiss his dad and doesn\u2019t wanna spend time with him. I\u2019ve tried to explain he is only mirroring my husbands behavior - he shows no interest in son, so now son shows no interest in him - but my husband is so angry with our son that he scolds him and punishes him excessively for this behavior. If my son says \u2018no go away daddy\u2019 then my husband will turn off the tv and tell him this is his house and his tv and to learn to respect him. He will then get angry with me when I comfort our crying son. He often do these huge punishments trying to get our son to behave, and he gets angry when I try to explain this isn\u2019t helping his relationship with his son but rather escalating the problem. He will also use silent treatment towards me or my son if he gets upset, even though I have explained this is a type of abuse.\n\nWe are on the brink of divorce because I won\u2019t let him \u2018parent his way\u2019 since I believe it\u2019s damaging to our son. I have told him our son will end up being scared of him rather than loving him with this behavior but he says he doesn\u2019t care if his son loves him as long as he respects him (his words). What do I do? I love my husband but it\u2019s gotten rapidly and progressively worse the last 6 months and now he is ready to abandon both me and our son.

From red-sored diaper rash to severe-shrieking diaper changes to \"very, very minor hearing loss in left ear\" failed hearing exams to (lately) under-\"minimum\" intaking to issues when feeding to, now, vampire sleeping to his continued reflux diagnosis and issues... the list goes on. Since we've been home with him (since JAN 23) I've been logging his food intake after feeds (what he was fed, the duration of the feed, how much he took in mL) and his weight (we bought a scale). We were not told to nor directed to, it was just how I could keep up with milestones myself, for us.\n\nWell, starting about a week or so ago, he's been falling off his intake (needs 750mL, but would take 650 one day, 610 another, 495, 340, etc), and his weight stagnated for 3 days, and even dropped weight one day (which he's still on the (VERY SLOW) rise from). We've had two separate \"he sounds like he's drowning\" reflux issues, after which we called the pediatrician after-hours line for, took him to the ER once, and took him to his pediatrician twice for. He's been prescribed femotidine, but that can take up to 2 weeks to have lasting\/actual effects.\n\nI'm rambling on about his issues, but getting off topic from my title. Basically, all the medical folks say he's healthy - he's having proper bowel movements, making enough wet diapers each day, he HAS at least met the MINIMUM of weight gain (but again, his intake drop off was only this last week, I really think he just beefed up the first 2 or 2 weeks before that, when his intake was at and above his minimums). 4 or 5 separate medical professionals have seen him and say that he's fine. But I'll get home and the very next feed he'll not only miss by an hour and a half, but out of the 95 he needs he'll only take like 30... then the next feed he'll only take 25, etc etc - and they're all struggles!!!!  \n\n\nToday I told my wife, I'm done logging his intake and weight. I have to. For my own sanity. Because every time I log an under-feed, I panic. Every time I see his weight stagnate or drop from one day to the next, I panic. Our pediatrician has advised us to go see a speech therapist for feeding tips and to check his intake, but other than that she says he's good to go. Feed on demand, feed until he won't take anymore and monitor wet diapers etc. He'll get weighed once a month, and handle anything monthly accordingly.\n\nSo I'm dropping the logs. I'm not keeping up with his mL intake, just hoping he takes 3 at least (which folks, he does not most of the time), trying to not let him sleep for more than 3hrs between feeds (he MAY get 7 feeds a day...), and at most logging\/marking wet diapers n BMs. That's all we can do, right? We don't deny him food, we feed him when he wants until he's done. Whether that's 35mL in 4 hours or 60 in 3. I have to stop focusing on numbers, for MY health. I haven't eaten in days, my sleep is already in shambles because of just baby stuff but now it's worse, I try to engage in hobbies but just end up thinking and googling and stressing and worrying... I'm a mess. And all he seems to REALLY be afflicted with is bad reflux.\n\nIf you've read this far, I'm sorry this went on this long. I'm more comfort typing now, I suppose. I'm hoping there are some fellow parents out there who've been in this spot and can relate. Some support would be of great help now. My wife is returning to work in a few days, so for about a month I'll be with him solo dolo for 12hrs, 3 days a week. I'm gonna take care of my baby, but knowing she won't be here adds more stress. And I'm already trying so, so hard to not focus on what's in his bottles and wondering if he's gaining or losing weight. I know it all will pass (in several months....), but man this is rough.","upvote_ratio":0.77,"created_utc":1678348469.0},{"title":"How to discipline 7 year old (mild ASD) who is continuously acting out in school","author":"booterbutter","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Parenting\/comments\/11n0czz\/how_to_discipline_7_year_old_mild_asd_who_is\/","text":"My daughter is a first grader and is mildly on the autism spectrum, she is very smart for her age, but struggles significantly with socializing, rigid behavior, inflexible thinking, sensory issues, and lately. She has been acting out out with aggression towards peers. \n\nThere are supports set up in school for her, such as a calm corner for her in each class, a meeting with the social worker each morning to discuss the day and what to expect during specials, and for certain classes, she has a reward system set in place to keep behaviors in check. \n\nBut still, she has many days where she hits other children, Pushes them, crinkles their paper, or engages in tantrum behavior with yelling and sometimes throwing (though more rare). All of this is a bit confusing for me because she did not engage in a lot of these behaviors last year in kindergarten, and many of these behaviors were worked on in therapy and head seem to pass for her.\n\nMy question is, how should I go forward with disciplining her for these behaviors? I\u2019m beginning to think she has adapted this \u201cbad kid\u201d persona, and just believes that she is mean and can\u2019t control it. We never tell her that she is a bad kid, of course. We have an honest discussion with her, explaining that what she has done is not OK or acceptable and always explain what she CAN do instead. If it is not the first warning, a consequence is given, and if it keeps happening, the consequence gets a bit tougher (i.e losing a favorite toy for a longer period). \n\nWe do expressed that we are disappointed, is that what could be hurting her further? Should I pause on the consequences and just try to get down to the bottom of the behaviors for now? We had a talk last night about how she should not push another student if she is upset with him , and she seemed to understand but then today I get a call that she hit two students for a reason that I do not know yet, but reasons in the past have been that of a rigid reason like the kid doing some thing that she believes is wrong as she has a very black and white view on things (incredibly inflexible). \n\nPlease, any advice is wanted.","upvote_ratio":0.57,"created_utc":1678388092.0},{"title":"How often should child have a bath?","author":"Maleficent_Damage169","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Parenting\/comments\/11lwi6e\/how_often_should_child_have_a_bath\/","text":"I give my 5 year old child bath every other (sometimes every 3 days) is that enough?

We have 3 boys in elementary school in Pennsylvania (6th, 3rd, and K). All 3 have either a 504 or an IEP for varied reasons.\n\nOldest is grinding it out and with after school help from me is maintaining A\u2019s & B\u2019s. Socially\/emotionally he is immature and very innocent (ASD diagnosis, it\u2019s common to be behind a few years) and doesn\u2019t have many close friends. Plays clarinet and does the local Rec league basketball.\n\nMiddle son has major sensory issues, and other difficulties that are making school very challenging. He is regressing this year and very very bored. He is in a large class with quite a few kiddos who need extra attention and a teacher who is barely hanging on at this point. He always off task on his iPad or folding paper into throwing stars and knives. I would have to put in multiple hours per night to keep him up to speed. No sports, plays piano. He is very social but a follower- and not of the kids who make good choices. Doesn\u2019t stand up for himself when friends aren\u2019t kind, either. I can very easily see him falling in with a bad group of kids.\n\nOur youngest is very bright and social, no real concerns there\u2026yet. He\u2019s five.\n\nHere is the other thing that has been coming up pretty consistently. We are generally unhappy with the overall quality of education and environment that the boys are receiving at their current elementary school. We are in a great school district, but the day-to-day experience varies wildly from one elementary school to another and in looking at the PTO earnings and parent involvement our elementary school lands at the bottom of the list. We also have the highest number of special education\/IEP students and can\u2019t keep enough staff to service our kiddos. We can\u2019t keep enough staff, period. Educators\/school staff are my friends and heros and most days our poor lunch aides and principal are subbing in classrooms.\n\nI am fortunate in that I\u2019m a stay at home mom who can allocate time and resources and money to help with as much as possible to elevate the experience for all the kids at our elementary school, but it is becoming apparent that it\u2019s not making as much of a difference as I had hoped.\n\nAnd that brings me to our school board. 9 members, unpaid, all GOP and just a pile of garbage the last few years. Decisions are trending very conservative and that is also a major concern for us. I have been a vocal member of the school community for a few years and am not afraid to continue to be but it\u2019s starting to feel like a losing battle.\n\nSo, all that being said, we could probably make private school work, and there are a few good options locally but I want to get other peoples opinions that have gone through this. That, or what can we do to help elevate the boys education?! Any guidance is greatly appreciated.","upvote_ratio":0.44,"created_utc":1678400944.0},{"title":"I feel like I don\u2019t know my child anymore","author":"Background-Ask-8687","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Parenting\/comments\/11mymrd\/i_feel_like_i_dont_know_my_child_anymore\/","text":"My son is 5 years old.

My oldest comes back home and tells me all the things that have been discussed and and how kids are rough housing. When I was growing up (the 80's) most of this stuff was normal kid behavior but sometimes my wife (grew up in the 90's) believes it crosses the line to being age inappropriate (talking about gory fight scenes from R-rated movies) or bullying (e..g older kid tells my son he can't sit in the back because he is not in third or fourth grade). I see that sometimes my son is bothered by what goes on but not always (full disclosure, he gives as good as he gets). I am now left wondering how to react, especially as we prepare the younger one to get on the bus next year. In certain instances, I've offereed to talk to the school or other kids' parents (who I am relatively close to).  Each time my older son has told me not to for fear, I think, of playground retribution. Given none of the bus behavior has gone to any extreme, I've obliged my son's request. Yet, his Mom and I remain torn. We're upset about what goes on on the bus and worried about what our youngest will be exposed to (full disclosure, the youngest is more of a parrot  and it is very likely he will pick up some of the things he learns on the bus). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice will be appreciated.","upvote_ratio":1.0,"created_utc":1678371129.0},{"title":"Frog and Toad cookies - silly anecdote","author":"sci-eng-person","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Parenting\/comments\/11m45yw\/frog_and_toad_cookies_silly_anecdote\/","text":"My kids LOVE the Frog and Toad books.

It\u2019s awful.\n\nThe past 8 months were weird, but I spent the entire time with my daughter and hardly saw my ex and it was truly awesome, but now she said she wants to live with mom for high school (we started homeschooling during the pandemic). I don\u2019t have any ties to our \u201chometown\u201d, and I\u2019m thinking about relocating to someplace to retire. There are many things (including financial) that are going into this decision, but, part of it is that coparenting with my ex is not going to be a stable situation. She will keep the house, and my daughter will be more comfortable there, I think 50-50 schedules are unfair to the kids, and she is at an age where she\u2019s pulling away, even now she\u2019s not going to want to sit down to dinner with me and where we live, we don\u2019t have much to do (like, we live near mountains but she is so so about skiing).

We have a 6 yr old daughter, and I\u2019m still in the house with her and my 16 yr old son, to get it ready to sell, let the kids finish out the school year, then plan to move back to PHX once all done.  (We are less than 2 hours away, and only moved here for his job 5.5 years ago).  \nSo within days of him ending things, he was IMMEDIATELY already in a new relationship with his work partner from his fire station.  She\u2019s in her early 20\u2019s, he\u2019s about 10 yrs older than her at 32, and I\u2019m 10 yrs older than him almost at 41.  I only just filed court papers 4 days ago, and he\u2019s been here finishing projects on the home when able and to see our daughter, but always cutting time short with her, to spend time with the new girlfriend.  Honeymoon phase.. I get that, but our daughter SHOULD be priority #1.  Here\u2019s the issue\u2026 he didn\u2019t even admit the relationship till 6 weeks into it (lied and lied), but almost simultaneously wanted to take our daughter to the rodeo parade and rodeo\u2026.. WITH his new girlfriend.   \nNow, our daughter has been around her a few times and played with her, at softball games, at the fire station visiting daddy on shift, a work event\u2026. But a handful of times or less in like 8 mos\u2026. And just as a friend and someone daddy worked with.  I was even there a couple of these times.  When they were JUST co-workers.\nI would absolutely not allow him take her to an event like that with his now new girlfriend, because to me\u2026 the situation has not only changed between the two of them, but she\u2019s also only 6\u2026 and this all has literally just begun with this whole process!!  Since then, it has been nothing but fighting and pushback from him saying I\u2019m being jealous, spiteful, unreasonable because our daughter already knew her before\u2026 and he\u2019s talked to her about it many times and she\u2019s \u201ccompletely fine with it\u201d.  Thinks there\u2019s not a set \u201cwait time before they spend time together\u2026 that it all depends on the child and where they are at.\u201d\nWe have been as open as possible about talking to her about what\u2019s happening, and she does know daddy has a girlfriend (she overheard me on a call with a friend after sneaking out to listen in unfortunately.  Wasn\u2019t intentional by any means).  I sent him multiple articles all recommending waiting some time even after the finalization of court and the separation, but he seems to think because she\u2019s \u201csmart & amazing\u201d, this will not effect her negatively whatsoever.  \nI disagree.  But now we are doing nothing but fighting about this nonstop.  He went behind my back and had her taken to an event by his mom, that he was at last weekend with the new girlfriend.  As soon as I found out, I called the Mother and said it wasn\u2019t ok, it should have also been discussed with me, and that I\u2019d just come get her.  She decided to leave the event, and take our daughter other places for the rest of the day.  But the new gf apparently ended the relationship with my ex because of the \u201cdrama\u201d being too much (they\u2019ve reconciled after a few days of him forfeiting time with our daughter to try and  save this 2 month old relationship that\u2019s already been beyond unstable since inception).  He refuses to believe any articles I\u2019ve sent supporting any reasoning for waiting a length of time before allowing this, or the opinion of a clinical psychologist I spoke to that specialized working with children for over 15 years.  He even offering to speak with my ex to relay the same info to him he told to me.  My ex and her have already been planning to move in Together, for weeks now, even though they\u2019ve broken up twice in 2 months already, she\u2019s extremely jealous as well as untrusting (as she honestly should be of him), but as far as stability\u2026. Let\u2019s just be honest, I\u2019m sure just from this short bit, many can formulate what will most likely come of the union.  We\u2019ll just leave that to karma at this point\u2026.

I mean, she hasn\u2019t really experienced MUCH change even yet\u2026 and I don\u2019t think will really be effected until we\u2019re packed up, or seeing our empty home and moving away.  \nOpen to all opinions on this here guys\u2026 because I went thru this as a kid, and it was devastating to me then.  I just want to make sure I\u2019m not being unreasonable or allowing my still very raw emotions, to cloud any judgement or from doing what is the best thing for our daughter here\u2026\nTo me, this is BEYOND too soon.

My husband and I are fairly recently married. He already had 4 kids when I met him. The older 2 are biologically his and the younger 2 are not. We live with his mom and are all planning a move within the year. Everyone here gets along great. \n\nLegally the two younger children are adopted by his mother. The birth mother of all 4 tried to fight losing her rights with his biological children so when the state removed the younger 2 in succession they asked if they could be placed with siblings. Because there is joint custody with one of the older children (she essentially never comes to see any of them) the foster care reps said for the safety of the younger 2 they should be adopted by my MIL not my husband. It stopped the birth mother from starting crap in court with my husband over the older kids and subsequently tying up the two younger kids in the mess. So far it has been just fine.\n\nBut birth mom does pop by here and there. Visits on the occasional birthday or whatever. I don\u2019t particularly mind or at least I didn\u2019t until she got to chatting with one of the younger kids fathers and he reached out. Said he has an older daughter that would like to meet her little brother. We were ok when we heard about it but weren\u2019t actually included in the decision which confused me. We knew the two kids actually had a lot in common and were playing a game together on switch. They do live in different states so it\u2019s just been video calls and gaming. They\u2019ve chatted maybe 4-5 times. The other night during story time with the girls the younger son was upstairs doing his gaming and video call and we could hear that his bio father was also in the match with them. \n\nThis was not the understanding we had of the arrangement. My husband and I both feel the guy is using his daughter as a way to get in contact with his son. He hadn\u2019t previously been around for either and does not live with the daughter. Both bio parents were heavy into drug use and the father was in jail which is part of why he lost rights when the state removed the child at 2yo from bio mom. Bio mom continues to do whatever, not my business, and as far as I can tell bio dad is still caught up in a similar lifestyle as before.\n\nMy husband does not understand why his mom is allowing so much contact with either but I think since she legally adopted them he feels he can\u2019t say much. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to answer honestly when the child asked about where he came from but I don\u2019t know if he is mature enough to be tackling interacting with someone that was potentially a contributor to what he was removed from.\n\nMy husband is very depressed about it whether he thinks I notice or not. I think he feels like he is losing his son and no one even considers how it affects him. What if anything can I do or say to his mother about this because I\u2019m upset and protective of my husbands mental state but also some warning flags are going off about this guy conveniently joining his kids gaming sessions.  How can I delicately suggest the stuff with bio dad needs to stop?

I will preface this by saying that we have an appointment with a paediatrician in a month's time to begin the process of evaluating if she has ADHD.\n\nShe has always been \"a handful\". Ever since birth, in really specific ways. She didn't sleep through the night until she was nearly three years old. She's a tornado; she's never been able to sit still, always needs something occupying her. I have never, ever been able to put a movie on for her to watch to keep her occupied; she has an attention span that lasts approximately five minutes (and that is not an exaggeration).\n\nDue to this, I'm often left feeling overwhelmed with her. She is not a bad kid; she's actually very kind and affectionate and funny. But when she misbehaves, she doesn't know when to stop. She pushes the boundaries constantly to see how far she can go. \n\nBecause of that, I am finding myself losing my temper when I don't want to. I don't know how else to react. If I try to say something like \"if you keep doing that, xyz will be the consequence\" her response is usually along the lines of \"I don't care, do it then.\" Which drives me insane! And I cannot deal with the overwhelming guilt that inevitably comes after I become reactive. Seeing her get upset because of something I've said in anger is heartbreaking and it's worse because it doesn't change the behaviour. It's not effective.\n\nSo I really, really need advice on what other methods you use when responding to your kids misbehaviour that actually work and don't leave you feeling like a terrible parent after the fact.\n\n(I will also add her father only has her on the weekends and says she is genuinely well behaved there.

I tried to tell my husband that we need a united front for our 4 year old but he keeps going off the script.  Like for example we had agreed to be firm with our son's night wakings. If he wakes us we comfort him and we leave him in his bed. We don't allow him to come sleep with us. And one night our son woke up screaming and said \"i had the worse nightmare ever!\" and my husband brought him to our bed. Next day, before night time at 10:30pm I tell my husband in a nice way \"hey, can we stick to what we said we would do and not bring him to our bed?\" and then we got in an arguement saying he did the best he could and that our son had a nightmare \"with a real monster\" and what was he supposed to do? he used his best judgment and that was his decision and if he had to do it again he would. In the future he says he will still use his best judgment and that \"exceptions happen\". I tried to tell him that we have given our song a \"spell\" to tell for nightmares and if we don't believe that the spell works then our son won't think the spell works. And plus we need to be consistent. No surprise our son last night woke up and said the exact same thing \"i had the worst nightmare\" and my husband took him back to his room didn't bring him to our bed but now our son knows we are not consistent. This afternoon I picked him up from pre-k and took him to playground. we have agreed to not give snacks after 4pm. I picked up at 3:30pm and didn't bring any snacks. Son and I returned home at 4:30pm and my husband in front of our kid said \"mommy didn't give you any snacks? come here\" and gave him 3 waffers. I had already said he will eat soon. we eat at 6pm so maybe lets wait? No. He just gave the waffers anyway. I don't feel like I can be an effective mother like this.

I honestly don't know what to do with him because he's not communicating about what is causing him to act out so much out of nowhere. Twice in one week is so unusual given that he never acted like this before. He also got into trouble previously in the year, but he hasn't done anything to this level before now. \n\nI feel like I'm failing as a mother. B never got into any trouble at school, nor did she lie like J has been doing. F is also behaving well, if not praised for his behavior in school, so I don't know where I went wrong with J. He just stares blankly when I try discuss what he is doing and the fact there are ramifications for the stupid things he's been doing. B even tried talking to J to see if there was something else going on that he didn't want to share with me, but he just said he doesn't know why he's acting like this. I feel like he's been super spoiled his entire life and doesn't understand that if he keeps screwing around with serious stuff (making violent and racist jokes at school), he's going to face actual, real life consequences. I've always strived for a household where you should speak about what's going on, and I don't punish for screw ups if you're honest and come to me for help. I've had to pick up B drunk underaged when she called for help, so it's not like my kids are angels. This is just too much. \n\nAny advice on what to do? Is this a moody teenage boy thing? He refuses to talk to anyone, nor will he consider speaking with a counselor or therapist. At this point, I'm just lost, and I'm thinking trying to scare him straight is the only thing left on the table because he's not responding to anything else.","upvote_ratio":0.33,"created_utc":1678337327.0},{"title":"Toddler butt rash during potty training","author":"han_cup","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Parenting\/comments\/11mist4\/toddler_butt_rash_during_potty_training\/","text":"Anyone experience this?

Until one day I met my SO and just immediately fell head over heels. About 5 months in we moved in together. Shortly after I found out I was pregnant. Shortly after I became pregnant I was diagnosed with perinatal depression (depression while pregnant, no history of depression) so it\u2019s been rough. I immediately began to have regrets or feel the decision to keep the baby was irresponsible. First we live in a small apartment right now. We barely have space for what we have and the housing crisis means there is nothing else. Tried to get a home loan but SO has a lot of debt and credit card debt that he\u2019s having trouble getting a handle on. I qualify for as much without him but it\u2019s not enough because house are way too much w\/ the buyers market. Since he\u2019s struggling - pays a third of his check in child support (ex refuses split custody because she can\u2019t lose the child support - her words not mine) and a lot towards credit cards and med bills. I sometimes pay a portion of his rent, all the bills, all the food for him and his son. I have 3 children he has 1. His son is autistic, very high functioning but there are some issues and my youngest is currently struggling with behavioral issues such as anger\/hitting\/long tantrums (think hours). We also never allowed proper time for our families to even blend, there is a lot of fighting and a lot of issues between kids. I worry so much about what we are bringing a baby into, like it should have waited until he was stable (which I\u2019m more than willing to help him with but it will take time) until our families had had time to settle, until the situation with my youngest was under control, until we had time to work with his son on behaviors, etc. The stress level is crazy high, the time level because of handling situations is already minimal. I worry about if my youngest is throwing hour long tantrums (I am working with specialists and his school etc, it\u2019s a work in progress) who has the baby? Who has the other boys. I worry when his son is screaming and crying and turning on all the lights in the house in the middle of the night because he scared of the dark how we keep a baby sleeping - he also has a very hard time with volume control all the time. I worry about the fact we have no space - and prospect for more space in the foreseeable future. I worry my finances are extremely stretched thin (barely making these med bills which I pay alone) and worry about how we manage that. I worry about his son hurting my kids (a lot of monitoring has to happen because he honestly doesn\u2019t understand sometimes) I worry about my son hurting his son who is extremely sensitive - how do I managed to be in many places at once. Things have gotten better with work and patience and a lot of talking but we still have such a long way to go without throwing another thing to disrupt their lives in again. I considered abortion early but didn\u2019t feel a lot of support and didn\u2019t really have the means. I felt adoption was better but felt like a monster because everyone else wants this baby. I\u2019m still considering it though. Am I in the wrong? I feel like everyone\u2019s like oh you\u2019re just depressed, there is nothing to worry about, it\u2019ll all work out. I\u2019m a very logical and realistic person and I don\u2019t see how they don\u2019t see it. My SO has told me he already loves this baby and that just tears me up but deep down I still feel keeping it is the wrong choice, for the baby and the children we already have. Thought? Advice? Am I crazy?\n\nTL:DR - Got pregnant very quickly into new relationship, both parents already, SO has an autistic child, my youngest is currently having behavioral issues (tantrums, anger, hitting), the kids have been through so much already, we have a lot on our plate as is, small apartment because I left my house, SO has a lot of debt to work on - I already pay for everything, considering adoption because I don\u2019t feel this is the best situation to bring a baby into, am I in the wrong for feeling this way?","upvote_ratio":0.33,"created_utc":1678368004.0},{"title":"Vacationing with Toddler","author":"BaileyIsaGirlsName","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Parenting\/comments\/11m35fm\/vacationing_with_toddler\/","text":"I\u2019m in serious need of a vacation.

I already posted something similar somewhere else but didn\u2019t get any response. \n\nMy (36f) husband (40m) and I have 2 children (4 months old and 2,5 yo). I am still on maternity leave and both children sleep very poorly. I do all night wakings (always have) because I BF exclusively and I am still on maternity leave whereas my husband works full time. Between the 2 of them, I get woken up every 1-3 hours. Last night I didn\u2019t get to go back to sleep past 3am. \nMy husband is an only child and we live app. a 4 hour drive from my in-laws. \n\nMy husband lost his father at 74 years old 2 weeks ago following a lung disease. FIL spent about 1 month at the hospital, but before then was in a pretty good shape so this came as a shock to all of us. \n\nFor the past almost 2 months, my husband has been going back and forth and spending 2-3 days a week at his parents\u2019 to visit his father at the hospital. When my FIL passed, I spent the week there with both children, and then went back home while my husband is staying another week with his mother (73). While my husband is away, and since my FIL passing (even while I was visiting my MIL), I have been managing the kids almost single-handedly - night wakings, feedings, activities, bedtimes, etc. \n\nSorry for the very long background, on to the actual question. While I understand that my husband is grieving and he needs to spend time with his mother and the rest of his family, I wonder if it is normal that he almost completely disregards his wife and kids? He knows how much I am struggling at the moment (he says so himself), yet he doesn\u2019t offer to come home sooner or help with the kids at all? \n\nI\u2019m honestly so tired and overwhelmed I worry that I might be losing sight of the bigger picture here. I get that he needs time to grieve, but he\u2019s still a father with responsibilities right? Also, he\u2019s starting work again tomorrow (Wednesday, he can work from his mother\u2019s place) but is only coming home towards the end of the week (Friday). I feel like if you\u2019re capable of going back to work, you should be well enough to come home to your wife and kids, no?\n\nHas anyone been through this before? I\u2019m starting to get resentful, and hurt that we are not a priority for him, even given the circumstances. I will discuss this with him when he\u2019s back, to express my needs and try to understand where he\u2019s at at the moment, but I want to know what other fellow parents think about the situation, and if my feelings are valid or if it\u2019s only the exhaustion speaking? Am I right to expect my husband to  step up with the kids while he is grieving his father?\n\nEdit:\n\nThank you all so much for your kind words and support! It feels good to be acknowledged, even if it\u2019s by strangers on Reddit! \n\nI wasn\u2019t expecting so many answers (thank you all \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc) and although I\u2019m trying to respond individually I\u2019ll address a few things here (warning: long edit ahead..) \n\nAs most of you pointed out, these are two different issues (the mourning for my FIL and the taking care of the kids), which need different solutions. In any case, I understand now that I shouldn\u2019t be expecting the heavy weight to be pulled by my husband. Not before a while though. The good thing is we can afford hired help, which I will be looking into quickly. I had thought of this before but I am very protective of my children and wasn\u2019t comfortable having strangers caring for them (my eldest goes to a nanny during daytime, thank god). But now my sanity is at stake! Taking care of the children on my own is ok, I can manage that, but it\u2019s the lack of sleep that\u2019s killing me, and that I need to address asap. \n\nI don\u2019t really have a village - our friends all work and have their own struggles, and I don\u2019t have family that could help (my mother passed away 10 years ago) so I have been feeling very alone as a young and struggling mother. And as evidenced by my post, I have yet to learn how to ask for help. I will start with my husband, and offer a few easy ways he can help me on a daily basis, being very SPECIFIC. It\u2019s true that I have only been pointing out that I am tired (like it wasn\u2019t obvious in my continuous zombie like state..), without exactly telling him what he should do. I was waiting on him to offer help, and assumed that as the father he\u2019d know how to take care of his kids. Now that he has his father\u2019s death to deal with too, I realize that he is already mentally maxed out with taking care of his mother, and managing his parents\u2019 affairs. I will help him help me, and hope he can do the same for me. \n\nI was very happy with him staying an extra week (although I knew it would be hard for me I know this is something he has to do). But I guess what hurts is the disregard, not even asking how I am or how the kids are doing, like he doesn\u2019t care about us at all. And also like he prefers spending time with his mother rather than us. But I shouldn\u2019t take that personally, and I\u2019ll try to put those feelings aside. The tiredness is preventing me from managing my emotions correctly. \n\nI also want to be there for him, but I don\u2019t know how with what little energy I have left. I guess he feels the same. We will have to pull through this together, as a team. With clear communication. \n\nWe will be visiting MIL in the coming weeks, and she will be staying over too, but I am wary of spending too much time there, and dealing with the kids with even less support and comfort than I do in my own home. So only a few days at a time tops. I also have to be able to put boundaries where it makes sense for me. I have too often put my own feelings and needs aside for the sake of my in-laws and husband in the past (although I love them dearly and want them to be a part of their grandkids\u2019 lives). Plus I\u2019ll be resuming work soon so we won\u2019t be able to visit much. \n\nThank you all for your sound advice!

I showed him some of these posts and I have a feeling his sister talked to him. (She's the best) He agreed to take her to daycare twice a week. Including waking and dressing her. He just asked for help prepping her breakfast, which I think is fine. He agreed to letting me sleep in on one of our days off, and he gets to on the other. Instead of splitting chores, we made a plan to do them together. \nHe seemed different tonight, maybe a colleague tore into him or something? (This happened when he didn't get me a mother's Day gift and tried to complain to his colleague that I got upset) He's usually pretty defensive. \nHe genuinly seemed sorry when I mentioned how his father never takes care of his mother when she is sick. I think that struck a chord. But, we will see. \n\nUpdate: he did end up waking up. She was screaming because I had to put her down after she threw up on both of us. My boss told me to take the day, we have a clause stating we can't provide childcare and work at the same time. He goes to work at 11:30 so, I'd be solo anyways.\n\nAnd no, he doesnt help with the morning routines, ever. He says he has an issue where his brain doesn't shut off at night so he can't go to bed until very late, and he makes up for it by sleeping until he essentially has to leave for work. \n++++++++\n\nI work today at 8am. I took yesterday off because our daughter has an upper respiratory infection. Fever, cough, congestion...you know. \n\nYesterday I asked him multiple times if he could attend to her from 8-11 (he starts work at noon and usually rolls out of bed at 11 to get ready) he said sure.\n\nI wake up at 7:30 this morning to a text from him, that he sent at 6:39am saying he was also sick and didn't get any sleep, so he would appreciate it if I could watch her. \n\nI work a call centre job. Our daughter is a year old and she's sick. Am I right to be upset at him for not stepping up? Should I make him wake up and do it anyways? Do I call in sick, again? I've already used three sick days out of my 10 for childcare and I've only been back at work for a month. I still had to take care of our sweet girl on less than 2 hours of sleep from the day she was born. Through COVID, strep, the stomach flu and half a dozen other diseases. I feel like it's not fair I asked for 4 hours so I could get some work done, and he's like lol no I'm sick.","upvote_ratio":0.92,"created_utc":1678195404.0},{"title":"What do you pay family members for childcare?","author":"Demosthenes-89","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Parenting\/comments\/11m83er\/what_do_you_pay_family_members_for_childcare\/","text":"Just what the title says, I'm trying to figure out an appropriate pay rate for family members helping me with childcare. \n\nMore context: I have two aunts who both have school-aged \/ teen kids and haven't worked since their own children were born. I'm asking them to help me with regular childcare during the day while I work. They'll be responsible for an infant and 3 year old at home while I work from home - so I'll always be here to help with meals and any crises that come up. \n\nI have no idea what's fair to pay in this scenario. I don't want to be too entitled, but I also feel like it's reasonable to pay lower than a standard babysitting rate when they are family and they'll never actually be alone with the kids.

Both have no issues with sharing a room and neither has said they want their own room. I have asked and offered and both decline.

We\u2019re pretty new parents (our son is 6 months old), and have always had a great friendship and connection. \n\nI know it\u2019s nothing new for relationships to change and struggle when babies arrive; I do get that. What I didn\u2019t prepare for is how angry I feel with him sometimes, especially when he starts to complain to me about the baby or how parenting has changed our lives. \n\nWhich it has, and I want to be able to connect with him and have empathy, but instead I often feel so angry with him. In part, I think it\u2019s because of the nature of some of his complaints. He says we never go anywhere or do anything anymore. However, because of his job stress for the past four years or so, we\u2019ve barely ever gone anywhere or done anything, and I\u2019ve just dealt with it. We\u2019ve also had trips and outings tanked by his work stress, so it just became easier to have all these quiet low-key nights at home.  So I adjusted to the homebody lifestyle, but now that we\u2019re doing it because we have a baby, it\u2019s suddenly a big problem for him, and I\u2019m really having a hard time when he needs to vent about it. Like yes, we haven\u2019t gone out to eat in two months, but we\u2019ve also gone out to eat a grand total of like four times in the past three years. If we didn\u2019t have a baby right now, I doubt we\u2019d have done anything differently.\n\nLast night was hard too. Our son is having more difficulty sleeping, so it\u2019s been a little harder to settle him at night. I\u2019ve really done all the night stuff, which is fine with me because of feedings, and I\u2019d rather we have one well-rested parent, ya know? But anyway, I finally got our son to sleep and it\u2019s like 1am and I get in bed to finally try to sleep myself and then my husband starts talking to me about how he never does anything he likes anymore and the baby kind of takes all our time right now and while I can absolutely empathize, I was also like \u201cBuddy, it\u2019s 1am and I\u2019ve gotten a grand total of like 7 hours of sleep this week, can we not do this now?\u201d I just feel like he doesn\u2019t think about me, whereas I would absolutely let him sleep and deal with my own angst if the situations were reversed. \n\nI guess I just needed to get some of that out.\n\nEdit: I guess honestly, I\u2019m just struggling and feeling unsupported right now. I feel like I\u2019m being indirectly asked to manage all of his feelings, as well as the baby\u2019s, as well as my own. I feel like some of his complaints are intended to make me ask less of him, and that really hurts.","upvote_ratio":0.74,"created_utc":1678284752.0},{"title":"Caught my son...
