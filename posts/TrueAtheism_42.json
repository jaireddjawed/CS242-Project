        "text": "Hey all.  So I am an atheist and the people who are close to me know this.  I have just been put in a very uncomfortable situation and my mind is racing on how to handle it.  My girlfriend is technically Christian. She doesn't seem to practice except when she visits her family. Even then it is only somtimes. I have never seen her go to church the entire time we have dated.  \n\n**The situation:** \n\n Her dad invited me to go to church this Sunday with them (I don't think he knows I am an atheist, it hasn't really come up in conversation ever). From her wording it sounds like shes is going as well (\"Would you like to go with us?\").   I really don't think I want to go. I would feel really uncomfortable being around everyone praying and listening to the preacher.  I would feel pressured into bowing my head and closing my eyes, etc.  I would feel equally as uncomfortable if I stayed at her house alone.  Her family would go and I would be stuck in an unfamiliar place with no one to really talk to or keep me busy.  I would hope they wouldn't bring the fact I am staying back in conversation but of course I want to impress her parents and dont want them to think any less of me.   This whole thing is just making me feel on edge. \n\nI plan on talking about it with her tonight on the car drive to her family's house (about a 4.5 hour drive).  I dont want her to be put in an uncomfortable situation either.  It really sounds like a lose lose situation.  I am sure she will assure me that no matter what I choose, it doesn't really matter.  \n\n**Discussion:**  \n\nSo I wanted to know other people's experiences!  Have you ever been put in an uncomfortable situation because of your beliefs?  How did you handle it?  What did you expect to happen and what really happened? \n\nEdit:  Thanks for the advice. I probably will end up going as not to start any drama with her family. Id rather just go be uncomfortable then be uncomfortable AND worrying what her family was thinking.  I will also talk to my girlfriend about if/when we should bring up to her family I am an atheist.   Side note:  I would love to hear other stories from other people about uncomfortable situations!   I bet tons of people could learn from how it all turned out.\n\nEdit 2: \nI ended up talking to her and it went well. She understands where I am coming from. She assured me she doesn't want me to be uncomfortable.  She said her parents won't care I'm an atheist.  She gave up ideas on how I could tell her parents I have to meet a friend for breakfast (I do have one nearby).  She said if I do choose to go that she isn't looking for me to change my beliefs. She said take it as a social experiment and maybe see why some people do choose to go. Also that we can sit in back so if I do get uncomfortable,  I can leave unnoticed.  She  said that the only reason she would want me to go is to meet important people from her growing up life and brunch after. She said we can bring up my atheism to her parents and even offered how to do it in a nice way.  she also wants me to know that she respects my beliefs and said she loves who I am.  This girl is so understanding.   I decided to go as it won't hurt and in reality she would go if the roles were reversed.  Thanks everyone :)",

Microscopic studies of a supposed iron bracket show that it is derived from weathered volcanic minerals. Supposed metal-braced walls are natural concentrations of limonite and magnetite in steeply inclined sedimentary layers in the limbs of a doubly plunging syncline. Supposed fossilized gopherwood bark is crinkled metamorphosed peridotite. Fossiliferous limestone, interpreted as cross cutting the syncline, preclude the structure from being Noah's Ark because these supposed \"Flood\" deposits are younger than the \"Ark.\" Anchor stones at Kazan (Arzap) are derived from local andesite and not from Mesopotamia.\"\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durup%C4%B1nar_site\n\nThere are several other searches and claims of the ark being found all of which haven turned out to be false or wrong.\n\n8.\nNot the remains of the ark(that does not even exist).\n\n9./10./11.\nSee above.

I've never been to a church or participated in a religious meeting before today. The entire place was as expected of a small church and I met the pastor who introduced himself to me along with a few members. \n\nThe pastor asked everyone to introduce themselves and how they found the program. A lot of adults spoke about their past exp w/different churches and how religion helped them etc. When it was my turn I just said my name and how my neighbor brought me here. \n\nNext the pastor asked the audience if they could ask god one question what it would be? I said, \"I don't know.\"\n\n\nFinally, a short clip of a British guy Rico Tice about the introduction of Christianity played and a discussion afterwards on how it relates to life. \n\nTBH, it was very surreal how everyone was 100% confident about creationism/Intelligent Design was real just because. I have a few questions for anyone who is more familiar w/Christianity if they are willing to answer. Thanks. \n\n1.  Why does no one argue how exactly humans are so important over other animals? Isn't it egocentric to say people are so developed to \"rule\" over all the other creatures? \n\n2. I don't understand why some people wanted god to give them some direction towards destiny? I thought it was the concept of creating your own purpose is calming? \n\n3. Why knock down other religions just because they are different? Why is X religion so much more valid than paganism of the past?\n\n4. Umm, I thought many schools taught evolution/biology and sciences because they are backed up w/research and decades of studies. Everyone there seemed to be lucid but completely discounted all these facts. \n\nJust because a topic is complex/difficult to understand at first doesn't really mean there was SOMEONE who planned it out just so people could live on Earth and pursue their own goals. \n\n* I wasn't aware it was a bible study and I thought it was a lesson on theology like in history class. It's just the whole God is watching over you and gives you meaning is making me uneasy. \n\n* I feel like I need to go and read *The Origin of Species* and refresh my mind. It's a good time to go and finish *The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark*.\n\n**BTW: Is it weird the more people try to direct me towards religion as a answer in life the more skeptical I become? I hate it when adults would answer my questions with: Because I Said So. Really?**   \n   ",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/2i3219/the_rules_the_sub_and_where_were_heading/",
        "text": "Hi everyone, it's been a while since we went self-post only and changed the rules, and we've decided again to make some adjustments based on how the sub has been going since then. \n\nOur ultimate goal is quality discussion, and we hope you share that. With that in mind everything is up for review. I'm going to list anything of note below, and we'd like to hear your thoughts on where we stand with each. We'd love to hear suggestions about literally anything to do with the sub, including how we moderate, what our goals are and even the appearance of the sub. Bear with us, this will be big.\n\n**Self-posts** - It's my personal opinion that this has vastly improved the quality of the sub, in both the submission quality and the quality of the comments. Comments in general are far less constant self-congratulation and far more discussion. People with the anti-Islamic agenda have all but disappeared and submissions in general are much more relevant to theological discussion.\n\n**The rules** - Although the changes helped somewhat, they are still imperfect. They are slightly more lengthy than they could be, can be confusing and are overall pretty messy. Most of all, some posts that were good were technically breaking the rules. With the larger numbers of active mods we now have it's become more of an issue. With that in mind I've written up a new set. It is largely the same, with the main rules rearranged and merged and a few more added in. Here's what we have so far after a bit of discussion:\n\n___\n\n###Rules\n\n**All posts and submissions must be respectful towards others**\n\n* Do not attack people personally for their opinion. \n\n* Do not attack entire groups of people based the actions of a few.\n\n* Groups may be criticised, but only when relevant to discussion. \n\n* Users should make efforts in good faith to be balanced, avoid bias, remain calm, and respect alternative points of view before posting.\n\n**No low-effort or low-quality posts**\n\n* Submissions should have a reasonable amount of self-written content. They should provide points for discussion, including asking questions or requesting alternative opinions. Submissions must not be ranting.\n\n* No single-word or unnecessary replies.\n\n* No posts containing only images.\n\n**External links must provide reasonable content**\n\n* You may link to articles and external sites provided you outline points of discussion and relevancy in your post. You may quote the article but this alone is not enough. \n\n* Promotion of websites, charities or content is allowed. If you are promoting something with much content pertaining to different topics, provide a specific piece for people to look at and make the effort to contribute yourself. You may not solely promote your own content.\n\n**We are not an echo-chamber**\n\n* Posts here should not simply validate already well-held beliefs.\n\n* Don’t let others decide your own opinion. If you're not certain of your views, let others give you advice, but don’t decide based solely on what you hear.\n\n* Keep an open mind. This subreddit is for thoughtful and informed discussion, not for boosting our ego.\n\n**Do not vote indiscriminately**\n\n* Do not downvote people for being misinformed. If someone is incorrect, you should aim to correct them.\n\n* Do not downvote people for having a contrary opinion, particularly if they have come to debate or explain their viewpoint. Downvotes don't change opinions.\n\n**Tag meta posts as [META] before your title and provide constructive discussion**\n \n*Moderators retain the right to remove content they deem unfit*\n\nMajor offenses are an instant 14 day ban, followed by a lifetime ban on repeat offense.\n\nMinor offenses are subject to removal and warning, followed by a 7 day ban on repeat offense\n\n___\n\nWe're posting before changing anything to see if anybody disagrees with anything in this new set or has any ideas for improvement.\n\n**The look** - As it stands the goal is minimalism. We could make the effort to spice it up a bit, but as it stands that isn't the priority.\n\n**Post quality** - I've already mentioned the sub is better overall, but people have mentioned recently they dislike some of the posts getting upvoted. It's difficult for us to take a hard line on anything that others are enjoying. The compromise at the moment is that we ask people to make adjustments to their posts, usually without removing.\n\n**Bans** - By the old rules we tended to give warnings before banning, but it feels rather ineffective. As noted in the rules, what we'd like to do is take a far stricter approach. We still see some pretty vile comments, and at present we don't see much merit in simply deleting and warning. \"Major offenses\" are almost always cases in which someone personally attacks another user. Saying \"you're not very smart\" is only a minor offense. Statements like \"Your post is flawed logic\" are allowed.\n\n**Sub direction** - As mentioned at the top of the sidebar, this sub is: \"A subreddit dedicated to insightful articles and thoughtful, balanced discussion about everything to do with atheism, theism, deism and religion.\" I personally don't see anything worth changing.\n\n**Related subs** - I'm probably going to organise the list a little more, but I'd like to ask if we should make any adjustments to what is mentioned. Some could definitely be removed, like /r/truereddit for relevance and AtheismMeta for being useless. Others could be added such as /r/Christianity and /r/Islam. Lastly, I'd like to add subs that pertain to the general philosophy of atheism, for example /r/Skeptic, or subs that pertain to similar interests, like /r/philosophy and /r/ask_philosophy.",

And you can EASILY argue, fairly, the position that NOONE understand QM even the most brightest physicists today.

(it says in here in the bible and because god spoke to me). This is literally what they argue and they will be happy to admit it. \n\nBut you can say that we can accept that even though we know NOTHING about why QM is the way it is, it's not irrational to know things like a color, you sons name, the day tomorrow, or where Australia is on a map. Common sense facts exist for us to talk to each other. From basic to more complex.\n\nSo we can also claim that QM is quite simply too confusing to claim we KNOW what is really going on behind the scenes but we can't claim it is something like 'God does it' or science has to explain everything to believe that it is true in both worldviews.\n\nThe conclusion therefore is that we can have something as knowing it to be a fact and true without needing to or even being ABLE to prove what is causing it. We may never know the reasoning behind Quantum mechanics. But neither side has to know what the cause is ultimately to both belief it is the case here.\n\nIono i'm going for something where they could probably twist it back into it's weird logic of the god axiom, but it's a perfect point to call them on their bullshit by stating so they KNOW god plays with dice despite the fact there is no way for them to explain why it is the case or that god acts on a quantum level despite everyone accepting by the theory itself we cannot possibly know the state of affairs and neither can god by definition.\n\nIt would at least highlight to others why they are leaping to conclusions on being able to proclaim knowledge of a gods intentions.\n\n( I don't know any atheist who would use QM to actively prove a god doesn't exist anymore than newtonian mechanics. I'm talking about the non cogniticsent god here )\n\nSo clearly we CAN go from this group assumption to something tangible yet agnostic and say it is silly to claim we HAVE to know everything in order to be claiming knowledge without justification. (I don't wanna go too deep into this, those that know the history of epistemology know the arguments etc. I refuse to believe in existentialism etc)\n\nI hope this would be a good middle ground to avoid the drugery of going deep into the semantic bs of xtian epistemology that we have when there's a VERY good example that both parties HAVE to accept to be true that doesn't step on enough feet to force a stalemate.\nnoone remotely intelligent will deny QM as existing. \n\nNoone can claim 'it's god' as it's an effect we see not a cause we're trying to explain.\nIt's basically an axiom to work forward that forces us away from trying to answer everythign on a deep level..\nThis was kind of inspired by that debate of 3 v 3 on youtube where they got into some pretentious battle of what it means to 'know' something etc. that we all know and hate.\n\n\n**any constructive ideas or other examples that you think are good? My position if you want to know is agnosticism I don't claim to know 100% a god exists because I probably can't comprehend what it would mean to be one. I think the 'God' of religion is CLEARLY false but that's based of evidence of what religion provides not generally because lightning has been explained. I fully expect the universe to be explained by science. But I can't claim there isn't some neo-dimensional being that has existed at one point that fired up a flux capacitor and diveded by zero. Whatever that would be.\nthese debates infuriate me because they literally destroy any chance for capable xtians to find a middle ground on matters that often benefit both sides in terms of making religion more progressive. 2 hours turns into 'ahh but how do you KNOW god doesn't exist' literally on topics about things like is church good for humanity (which I would argue in many ways is actually)**",

        "text": "First I'll get some things out of the way. Yes, I am an atheist, yes there are a lot of porn links in my profile, while a reply \"god doesn't exist\" is sufficient for some I'm not asking that question, I already have a sincerely reasoned cognitive position on that subject. I am also not looking for explanation about the problem of evil. Yes, my grammar sucks. \n\nI am mostly focused on what seems to be an inconsistency of the common Christian definition of self-sufficiency and what seems to me a circular argument that goes like this; if god has everything then he should not need anything more, therefore anything more i.e. creation, humanity and more love, means he didn't have everything and thus he is not-self-sufficient. \n \nThere are a lot of dictionary definitions of self-sufficiency and they mainly focus on being independent without the need for outside help. Which in my opinion means god would not need any help or interaction from anything other than himself. \n\nAn example of a Christian worldview: God, being identified and defined as self-sufficient, means He possesses within Himself every quality, ability, and supernatural command with never-ending measure. Every attribute or mighty and wonderful power is His endlessly. God wants for nothing and lacks nothing; He is complete. \n\nAdded to this the Christian view is that god created us out of love and he is unchanging. \n\nSo by that definition if any extra quality, state, ability, measure, attribute or \"Love\" is created or any change occurs in addition to that ultimate completeness, wouldn't it then imply that there is a lack of total self-sufficiency? \n\nSo here is a few of my own answers:\n\n1) The definition of god as totally self-sufficient is correct, that he needs nothing more and nothing more was added, god's existence is static, inactive and unchanging. \n\nA premise I think is refuted by our existence. Since creation implies change.\n\n2) The definition of god as self-sufficient is incorrect and god added more. \n\nWhich in my mind creates a circular argument. God can neither be at the same time and in the same instance, unchanging, whole and complete (or inactive) and changing, not whole and not complete (or actively creating).  \n\nI guess to avoid an excluded middle one could define god as both changing and unchanging or inactive and actively creative, and both whole and not whole, and both complete and incomplete, but then it seems ludicrous to stick to the original definition of self-sufficiency. \n\nTo which I propose god existence is dependant upon an independent (self-sufficient) agent that is equal to or possessing a greater amount of independence. Which to me then follows if humans are, at least from a temporal perspective, the self sufficient agents (and we have no other reason to believe we are not) then we have no need to add anything supernatural to complete us. \n\nThough some here might say I have answered my own question, I'd still like to see some other viewpoints.   \n\n\n",

We seem to keep forgetting one thing.\n\nFAITH = Belief in something with no proof.  \n\nWithout Faith, there is no God, Allah, Shiva, Thor, etc.  Faith is what causes someone to write the Bible, Koran, and all of the other stories of mythological deities.  Theists have been infected with Faith and then continue passing it onto their offspring like a virus.  When you see them carrying around these books, its a symptom of their Faith.\n\nWhen you try and debate a theist using the Bible, you are trying to use logic to destroy a starting point that is illogical by it's very nature (faith).   It's obvious these books/stories are extremely contradictory or nonsensical.  Their faith has caused them to compartmentalize/rationalize these stories to fit their world view.  \n\nEdit:  My use of the term \"disease\" is used to show that the spread of the different types of faiths is an  analogy to the virus model.  Patient Zero is infected with the \"Faith Virus\" and gets replicated to the next host.  For example, the offspring of a Christian tends to be a Christian due to the indoctrination process.  Just as viruses mutate, so do religious ideology (Abrahamic -&gt; Christianity -&gt; Mormon/Baptist/Episcopal/etc).

Viruses can be used as a form of biological warfare (Shiite vs. Suni).  \n\nEven if you think that this post is inflammatory, do you feel that this is an accurate analogy?  As an atheist, does it help you understand why theists believe the way they do?  \n\nEdit 2:  My final point is that attacking the texts used by the theist is pointless because you are only dealing with the symptoms and not the root cause (faith).\n\nEdit 3:  I use the word virus because you are \"infected\" with it as opposed to evolution where you're born with it.

They are being taught really fucked up stuff. Their history class is called \"the society of life and the society of death\" and consists of them learning about how the U.S. started as a Christian nation (Society of life), and then historical events slowly degraded into a society of death... i.e. a sinful society. A little while ago they were learning why the feminist movement contributed to the society of death.\n\nThey are being taught that education is not something they should be interested in, and that marriage and raising kids is their future (remember, feminism is evil). College is bad, and liberal professors brainwash people. (Naturally, nobody can legitimately hold these views, they are merely parroting their professors).\n\nA couple weeks ago I was discussing something with my niece, and I was telling her that everyone has a motivation for wanting you to believe something, and that you should always research things on your own to try and figure out what the truth is.\n\nShe is an extremely bright girl, reads constantly, asks lots of questions. Last week she asked me how you go about figuring out what information is credible.\n\nI am always walking a line of alienation with both her and her parents. I try not to get into discussions that directly engage their beliefs, for fear that I might alienate them. I usually just ask probing questions and try to answer what they come back with honestly. I also try and put skepticism inside of contexts that are not religious, so I can more aggressively engage bad reasoning without having to worry about alienating or offending them.\n\nI told her that I would have to think about it, but that you can't be scared to learn about things that disagree with your beliefs. I told her that a lot of times it feels bad to have your beliefs challenged, and that this can cause you to avoid learning things that you don't like or immediately discounting them. At this point she basically said \"Yeah you have to make sure you aren't just accepting something because it agrees with what you already think.\"\n\nI agreed, and I told her that you should try and learn as much as possible from all sides of the topic, but that you really need to read both sides... and not only one side and *their* opinion of the other side.\n\nI then told her I would think about it a bit more and get back to her. It is legitimately a big question... I didn't know if she was asking me in general, or specifically how do I go about researching and figuring out what is credible? \n\nThe reason I am posting here is I am wondering if anyone here maybe has some better advice for her than what I gave.\n\nWhat do you tell someone who asks how you know if information is credible, or how do you go about finding credible information?\n\nEdit: She is 16. Has had an extremely sheltered upbringing. I gave her the book Into the Wild last year, and her parents wouldn't let her read it because of the hippy community described in the book. \n\nTo give an even better understanding of just how extreme her parents are... the kids aren't allowed to watch Shrek because he is an ogre and not a typical prince charming, and they don't want their kids looking up to someone who isn't a typical prince charming.

Jealousy?\n\n* If a god listens, but never speaks, does the god hear?\n\n* If a god watches, but does not act, does the god truly see?\n\n* As such, is omnipotence and omnipresence truly a description of a god?\n\n* Could god not be every individual man, our actions deciding our lives, our lives trees are possiblities, branches of decisions? Could we ourselves be god, in a possibility?\n\n* If happiness and joy is only through faith, how can it be those lost in faith are joyful with life?\n\n* Why would a perfect being design an imperfect world?\n\n* Why would he begin by building the perfect world, that of good, but plant the seed of evil, of which He himself hath sought to rid since? \n\n* Why would he allow temptation to take his creation from he?\n\n* Why would he seek to punish the world, rather than use his supernatural abilities to manipulate, and set the population back under his care?\n\n* Why set aside rules and laws to obey, set to stone by he himself, if they are to be cast aside for actions based upon an almighty will? \n\n* Why, he, the almighty, be classified as justified, loving, if he himself has sinned against his own law, falling to the sin of manipulation, greed, and envy?",

The security agency I work for knew this was a temporary site until they hired another director and since I was leaving this company (I accepted a job at a prison and was waiting for academy to start) they had me work the college since I was leaving anyway. Next Monday is the day I leave for academy and the school has still not found a director and the agency I work for has no one else to fill my spot at the college. Today I get a call from the dean of students (my site boss) with a job offer of assistant director. She said she was extremely impressed with my work and was willing to just give me the job. Problem though, the school policy says only Christians may hold faculty positions and the application can't be completed unless you fill out your testimony of faith on it. I know that ethically I have to decline, but should I be open about why I have to decline? Come Friday the school will have no security again. The prison job is waiting on me so losing my current position is no big deal. I'm just wondering, now that I've gained the respect of this schools students and faculty, should I come out and show that their policy kept them from hiring someone not of the faith who was actually really good for the school? I don't have anything to lose, but I guess I'm just questioning how professional it would be to give the reason for why I turned down the job.

        "text": "I've seen a lot of arguing on this subreddit regarding these terms, while I think that there should not be any.\n\nFirst off, let's make a huge distinction on gnosticism and belief. If you say you are agnostic about something you are saying that you are not sure of it, regardless of your beliefs. If you are gnostic, is means you know it with ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY, because the evidence about it is absolute. \n\nNow, absolute certainty is something that most philosophers consider \"unreachable\", specially when talking about these subjects. What evidence proves absolutely the existance of a deity? What evidence absolutely disproves it? How do you disprove the existance of a fairy? I don't think anyone has ever found such evidence, nor do I think that anyone will ever do it.\n\nThat is why I consider gnostic atheism as illogical as gnostic theism. Both take a leap of faith to claim them as true.\n\nNow comes the part about belief. This is where the terms theism and atheism come into play. They regard only the beliefs that people hold, not the epistemological truth of the claim. When talking about this, there's only one question to answer: do you believe in god? Asking \"do you not believe in god?\" would be redundant, because those questions are mutually exclusive.\n\nIf you answer \"yes\", you say that you are an agnostic theist, you are saying that the existing evidence has led you to believe that there is a god, regardless of his properties, but without being absolutely certain of his existance.\nIf you answer \" no\", you say that you are an agnostic atheist, you are saying that the existing evidence hasn't led you to believe that there is a god, thus you believe that there is no god, but you aren't absolutely certain about it because you haven't seen any evidence that absolutely disproves such a thing.\n\nI myself am a de facto atheist, which means that though I am not absolutely certain that there is not a god (agnostic atheism), it's existance is as unlikely as the existance of santa claus or a dragon in my garage, so I live my life in the assumption that there is no god (like a gnostic atheist would) . That is the way I see it and I just don't understand why anyone would consider themselves any more certain about the non-existance of a god.\n\nAnyways, that's just my opinion, tell me if i'm missing something. And, by any means, please tell me if you disagree.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEdit: thanks to all of you for making this distinction clear to me, you were really helpful. I guess that after all I should call myself a gnostic atheist.",

It doesn’t have any positive ontological status. Rather, evil is a privation; it’s a deficit in being. A good example of this would be cold in physics. In physics, cold is the privation of heat. It has no positive reality. It is simply the absence of heat...\n ([source](http://www.reasonablefaith.org/questions-on-the-end-of-time-determinism-and-string-theory)):\n \nCan one therefore infer that such a God succumbs to entropy?\n\n* If **not**, then why would this source of love not overwhelmingly and eternally negate all instances of its privation?

I wasn't quite sure how to respond as I am unfamiliar with that historical time period and the history of the book itself.\n\nI've done some preliminary searching online and have come up with dozens of christian sites claiming various forms of prophecy from this chapter and dream of Darius the Mede in chapter 7.\n\nSo far it seems the best rebuttal I have is to either point out the [absurdity](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/dan/2.html) of the character Daniel and his exploits or to appeal to the [Maccabean Thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_2#Interpretation_according_to_the_Maccabean_thesis). ~~Neither of these options are, in my opinion, particularly compelling.~~\n\nI was wondering if anyone here had encountered these claims before and what your rebuttals were. I am particularly interested in evidencially based arguments.\n\nEDIT: Upon further investigation, I think I will retract my statement about not finding the Maccabean thesis compelling. It seems to account for all the information I know of and the only critiques I can find have obvious christian biases for the book of Daniel being prophetic.\n\nI think that one could successfully argue that the Maccabean thesis provides a more plausible account.\n\nHowever I think a better approach would be to remind the theist that they have the burden of proof and that that burden is [rather heavy](http://wiki.ironchariots.org/index.php?title=Prophecy).\n\nI am definitely still interested in any other ideas you may have about how to tackle this topic.",

        "text": "I've really gotten annoyed with this wave of what I suppose you'd call \"new atheism\" that feels the need to start being overly specific with just where they are on the spectrum of how sure they are concerning the existence of a god or gods.\n\nIf you've spent really any time on the internet, you know the various terms: gnostic atheist, agnostic atheist, agnostic theist, gnostic theist, or just plain agnostic. The problem with all of these is that they're not actually describing the same situations, they're attempting to come across as more \"intellectually honest\" when answering a question that the theism/atheism dichotomy isn't asking.\n\nLet me put this in bold: **we are all agnostics.** Every one of us. Unless someone has personally traveled to wherever the deity exists, or seen with certainty the entirety of existence, we are all agnostic in the strictest sense. No one actually knows.\n\nThat's not what (a)theism is.\n\nWhen one says \"I am atheist\" it does not mean \"I know there is no god\". It means \"I do not believe there is a god\". Simple as that. It doesn't matter how sure that person is, because any skeptic worth his salt will admit that if hard evidence appeared for a supreme creator we'd have to accept it. That's how skepticism works. You ask questions and accept answers that satisfy them, regardless of personal preference. \n\nAtheism is the inverse of theism, and that is ALL it means. Theism is the belief in a god, atheism is the lack of a belief in a god. I have a lack of belief in the Pittsburgh Pirates winning a world series before I die. I have a lack of belief in there being a rhinoceros in my car right now. I can't say with certainty that either of these are false, but I don't believe they're true.\n\nThe kind of mindset that insists on that kind of semantic wrangling is the kind of mindset that says things like \"how can we every really know what the best pizza topping is? What if some topping I have never heard of appears, then what can I say?\"\n\nNo.\n\nStop.\n\nIf you, sitting where you are right now, lack faith that there is a supernatural being as we have conceived of the notion, then you are atheist. If you are open to the possibility of future evidence changing that belief, then you are atheist with skeptical integrity. If you're waffling, then you still have some thinking to do, but you're dancing between atheism and theism. Agnostic does not, has not, can not sit in between like some kind of \"this porridge is just right\" stance for people who lack the conviction to just say what they fucking believe.\n\nI'm tired of people saying they're agnostic and then, when pressed, admit things like \"well I don't believe in God but I don't know, maybe there is one.\" *That's still atheism.*\n\nWhen you say you're atheist, that doesn't mean you have now burned an emblem into your forehead and you can't change your mind. When you say you're atheist, you aren't contractually obligated to never decide there is a god. What you're saying is that, right now, at this juncture in your life, you do not hold the belief that there is a god.\n\nWe're all atheist here, and losing that unity is a problem. It sets up barriers and competing groups that are trying to take the intellectual or moral high ground over one another. Agnostic atheists or just plain ol' agnostics end up siding with theists because \"those darn atheists don't KNOW there's no god!\" \n\nNot to repeat the point, but... the theists don't know, either. None of us do. And in all likelihood none of us will, nor will we be able to. \n\nWhat we need is to be unified, not divided, not setting up camps that argue about just how SURE we are that there is no god, or where we land on Dawkins' 7 point scale of theistic certainty. That's another matter entirely. As long as you cannot say \"I believe in God\", then you are atheist. Drop the pretense, stop trying to assert superiority, just accept that you are atheist. It will help us all move forward to a day when we don't even need to point it out.\n\nIf you guys honestly agree with Sam Harris that we don't (or shouldn't) need the term \"atheism\", then I would hope you see just how much worse it is to be forcing spectra and myriad designations onto the idea as well. This needs to end. \n\nNOTE: Before anyone gets into \"well what do we mean by god?\" and similar nonsense, just know that if you accept that the term \"god\" does not have an actual concrete meaning, then you are de facto atheist simply by virtue of disbelieving in god even as its own concept.

        "text": "Wasn't sure what to title this post.  But just wanted to tell a story of what happened to me over the weekend  Kind of long, sorry.\n\n\nMy backstory to atheism started mostly with the death of one of my best friends at the time.  About 15years ago.  It did not break my faith, but it made me question prayer.  To provide some context for this story, I will explain a few things.  I was playing guitar in my church's worship team at the time.  I had asked my friend a few times to come, and eventually his parents came as well.  Shortly after they became saved.  They always thanked me for saving their lives(souls).  I was more or less their conduit to Christianity.  \n\nSo while we were all at this church, my friend died of cancer.  He battled it for years.  His parents stopped going to the church, but they still strongly believe and of course believe he is in heaven and they will see him when they die.  His mother in particular seems to NEED this belief in order to go on each day.  I used to be very close to them after his death, going to their house several times a month etc.  That slowly faded, and now I talk to them only when I see them.  Which is mostly in a fundraiser event they have every year in his name.  Which leads me to this story.\n\nSo I have only really considered myself an atheist for a year or so.  So not many know, it's not really a topic of conversation for most of the social gatherings.\n\nSo I am talking to my friends mother, the mother of my deceased friend, let's call her Kathy.  When another friends father walks up and starts talking, lets call him Dan.  Somehow the subject of religion comes up(not by me!), and I find out that Dan is an atheist.  And apparently a gnostic atheist as he begins to explain why God isn't real, etc.  So they start debating with me standing there.  And she keeps looking to me for support, and even a few times I laugh and start to chime in and decide to just hold my tongue.  So Dan's daughter walks up and rolls her eyes, and tries to make sure her father is not offending anyone.  I tell her I am just keeping my mouth shut to stay out of trouble, and she says 'Oh ya he's harmless'.  So while Dan and Kathy are talking and ignoring us, I say \"Well actually, I don't want to upset Kathy, because I think I'm on your father's side\".  She asks \"Oh so you are an atheist too?\"  And I say \"Yeah\".  And Immediately Kathy turns and says \"WHAT?!\"  \"What did you just say?\"  I say \"Nothing we are talking about him being an atheist\".  She turns to my wife and says \"Is he an atheist, really?!\"  My wife, understanding the tension, just shrugs...and we see Kathy visibly distraught run away and hide behind a wall.  I then see her family coming over to her asking her what's wrong.  \n\nSo I walk over and ask her why this upsets her so much.  The first thing she asks is \"So you don't believe my son is in heaven right now?\"  I really don't know what to say at this point.  Because honestly, no...i don't.  I think he's buried in the ground and that's it.  But this is not something I can say to a crying, grieving(it has been 15years tho!), distraught mom at her dead son's fundraiser.  So I mostly just explain that while heaven may still be real, I just don't believe in the God of Christianity anymore.  God, as anyone may know him, may still exist...but the bible isn't how you find him.  I explain a little about Deism and how we could all still be together in the end, etc.  Mostly I don't believe any of what I said but it made her feel better.(I am pretty agnostic about most of that, so I don't feel as if I lied)  This was actually on our way out as we were leaving, so that was pretty much the end of the ordeal.\n\nSo not only did I post this to see if you guys had any similar stories.  I wanted to see what people thought as to the reason why she got so upset.  I have a few theories.\n\nI don't think it has anything to do with her being afraid for my soul.  My best guess is that she has had some doubts herself.  But she clings so strongly to the idea of heaven and seeing her son again, that she can't let herself think about them.  And now she sees the person who more or less convinced her to believe these things in the first place, tell her they aren't true.  Or it could just be that she was upset that I didn't think her son was in heaven. \n\n**EDIT:**  Clearing up a few things.  This was a fundraiser 15years after the death of a friend.  And the mother was crying after hearing I was an atheist, not upset at me at all.  Just sad.",

Our most recent conversation left him walking away dragging his feet without answers when we discussed our planet's natural history. I discussed the validity of evolution with him, to which he ended up admitting he didn't know anything about it, just that \"modern science\" confirms that evolution is certainly a myth and there is no record of change over time. \n\nI discussed the predictions of evolution, as well as how speciation works and the well documented lineages of cetaceans for example to which he replied, \"I can't refute that.\" \n\nHe recently dropped off some very visually appealing mini-magazines to my wife that are so full of scientific fluff and quote mining I'm almost sick to my stomach. It tackles everything from the improbability of abiogenesis to several open ended quotes from biologists that certain pieces of evolution need revision (which somehow means the bible is automatically correct). The quotes found in here are honest and true, the difference is they are used in an open ended manor to make \"science\" support the bible, and \"theories\" to be illogical.\n\nScientists are quoted bemoaning the fossil record and how incomplete it is (a most dishonest request it is for us to find EVERYTHING that ever existed in fossil form), followed by a section talking about how transitional forms are a myth and exist nowhere in the fossil record.\n\nI already spent time with him explaining selection pressures, observed changes in allele frequencies, and the cross-confirmation of multiple independent lines of evidence. I might as well do some correspondence courses and save up to go to the university in my city at this rate. It takes a few hours to misdirect and fabricate a problem with science that takes years to do, and it feels almost impossible to stop all their dishonesty.\n\nIs it even worth it to continue this dance? He is turning out to be a brick wall of gullible stupidity that will parrot whatever his pamphlets tell him to, all the while poisoning the minds of the children he takes to witness with him. I want to be a force for intellectual honesty in the world, and I want to promote a better understanding of science and stop all this creationist bullshit. It just seems so damn hopeless though. \n\nWhat should I do?",

        "text": "For people committed to the Bible as the Word of God, there are a lot of problems lurking in the sacred pages of their holy book. One of them is the story of Jehu, King of Israel from 841-814 B.C. Yahweh, the God who had Jehu anointed King and who is still worshiped by billions of people, ordered and praised the very kinds of outrages now being committed by the barbaric psychopaths of ISIS not a hundred miles away. Jehu cut off his share of heads, too, piling them in heaps outside the gate of Jezreel.\n\nThe Bible’s matter-of-fact narrative doesn't convey the horror of what was done at Yahweh’s command. These people were killed at the edge of the sword, then those people—on and on goes the dry old text. Well, what might it have been like inside the minds of the ones doing the massacring, or those of the victims?\n\nI explored this with a 5800-word short story self-published on my blog this past week: [Jehu’s Jihad](http://blog.edsuom.com/p/jehus-jihad.html).  It provides two first-person points of view in addition to some remarks by a third-person narrator. Jehu speaks for himself, in the crude and unfeeling voice of a psychopathic killer. And then we hear from Baalzakar, a survivor of Jehu’s massacre of Baal worshipers at Samaria, who played dead and lay in a heap of bodies: \n\n&gt;The screaming became the dying and the dying became the dead, and all was quiet, except the panting and scuffling of the soldiers. I focused my world into the agony of slow and secret breaths. One by one, I held my lungs in a measured starvation to stay quiet and alive. My world was the dark mute pressure of dead arms and legs and torsos slick with sticky hot blood, the copper tang of it thick in my nostrils.\n\nYou probably didn’t hear anything like *that* in Sunday School. And this is a problem.\n\nUntil I’d been prodded by doubt about something else ([evolution](http://evolvingoutofeden.com)) and finally decided to sit down and actually *read* the book my church was claiming as God’s Word, I had no idea that there was such horrible stuff in there. This was supposedly the gold standard for life and doctrine: My old church’s [website](http://llchurch.org/ourbeliefs.cfm) says that “the Holy Bible is the highest authority in questions regarding faith and life.” It’s a pretty common view in Christianity, though there are different degrees of devotion to the Bible’s inerrancy, inspiration, and relevance to today’s society. But almost universal in Christianity is the idea that this book (actually a collection of 66 books by different authors with different agendas—most believers don’t seem to appreciate the nuance) is really something special, something holy.\n\nWell, I came to a very different conclusion after a summer of careful and painful reading, of walking away from the text in disgust and then returning the next day because I just had to see this through to the bitter end. The Bible turns out not to be much of a standard at all, at least not when it comes to human beings behaving decently toward each other. The outrages never seemed to end. Stoning brides for not being proven virgins on their wedding night, stoning women for not crying out loudly enough when being raped, stoning kids for lipping off to their parents. The brutal massacres of Canaanites and Midianites. Abraham being willing to gut his kid on a stone altar.\n\nNow that last one I had heard about in church, but through a sepia-toned filter of pious interpretation. The sacrifice was symbolic of what God the Father actually went through and *did* with his only Son, the preachers would say. And look at how much faith Abraham had! The horror and slavish devotion to a disembodied voice commanding ritual murder just did not enter into the picture.\n\nThe Bible gets a free pass among Christians, and even others swayed by a majority Christian culture, because it is so dry and opaque and seldom read. To adapt a line from one of its better-known characters, its pages “outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ... are full of hypocrisy and iniquity” (Matt. 23:28). That’s why I wrote this story, and may write a book of others like it. Let the awful reality sink in about just what is commanded and praised in its gilt-edged, leather bound pages. Give it some clear-headed narrative that has some pull to it, yet with a storyline that still basically follows the underlying biblical text. There have been other efforts to put the spotlight on these troublesome Scriptures, like Shelby Spong’s *Sins of Scripture* and *The Human Faces of God* by Thom Stark, and even [The Brick Testament](http://www.thebricktestament.com/home.html) that illustrates the problem with pieces of red Lego blood. After centuries of the Bible being elevated and privileged by having its dark side left unread at home and unmentioned in churches, it’s about time.",

        "text": "This is a continuation of a previous post and I honestly don't expect anybody to go and read the entire first post because it is very lengthy (If you do that' a really cool thing for you to do, but like I said I don't expect it so don't feel obligated.)  \n\nHowever, I do recommend reading the first 3 paragraphs in [part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/2fi8wu/first_major_debate_with_a_religious_person_in/) for some context.\n\nYou'll also notice that the concept of radicalism comes up a lot.  This is because in K's original comment she tells me that posting something like this makes me look like a radical atheist.  \n\nK: [This is in response to a previous post in which I bring up just a couple of ridiculous verses in the OT that aren't followed today and I ask how God can just \"let those slide.\"  I also bring up how religion has been used to justify slavery.]  Like I said those verses you mentioned are from books only in the Old Testament and it's very hard to explain ...It's not that we don't follow them but we live and follow the teachings that were after Christ since before him there were other ways to please God such as sacrificing animals and not eating certain foods.... \n\nThat is why the Jews still don't eat pork since they do not follow the new testament.. Only the old...while Christians do not. That is the difference other then we believe Jesus is our savior. \n\nGod does not let them slide since in the Old Testament he set those rules and punishment was to come for anyone who disobeys them. Those rules might have been different back then since it was a totally different time .. I'm not sure thought. \n\nSlavery has always been a part of life it just tells how to get through it with faith. But it does not say that a master can mistreat the slave as the white owners did to the blacks long ago as an example. \n\nI have not come across any teacher that has had the guts to say what they believe in because of the fear of getting in trouble or even fired. \n\nChristianity is not supposed to be violent or bloodthirsty for people who don't believe so we can put down our own people for worshiping wrongly by causing wars and crusades. \n\nI believe a person can think what's right and preach it to those who seek help and questions but not go out of their way to show what is wrong with another religion. There is a problem when people start acting violent and should be put down. \n\nI do not think it's radical if it's started in a debate brought up between a group of friends or family etc.. But if I posted something about Islamic beliefs and how wrong it is to even think that way(even if I believe it) it would be wrong since not everyone who is Islamic acts the way a radical one would... I'm not sure that made sense...\n\nMe: You can't just disregard those verses though because they are still a part of Christian history and all of its denominations. Although you may try to justify the old testament laws, it doesn't change the fact that the bible has multiple contradictions and mistakes (in one verse God is a god of war and in another a god of peace or that the earth is flat). These are mistakes that a perfect god shouldn't have made and act as a literal testament to the reliability of the entire document. \n\nA god with a predetermined plan for the world wouldn't have changed everything or get upset and kill almost all of his children in a flood because they were doing what he knew they would do. \n\nAfter sleeping on the matter it made me realize how unfair this whole thing actually is. If I'm not allowed to express my opinion on other people's belief, how am I supposed to express it? I can't post anything about the god I don't believe in loving me because that wouldn't make any sense. Any way I express my disbelief will upset people. Even if I just posted \"there is no god\" I risk being overtaken by religious people telling me that I'm wrong (that makes them radicals according to you.) \n\nI am allowed to criticize parts of society as I see fit because that is how change happens. To think that anybody's religion should be free from any criticism is not right. Imagine if we never criticized or discredited any of the past religions of the world, we might still be believing in Zeus or the sun God. Christianity is no different. I respect your right to have your religion but I don't respect your religion and I have every right to point out its flaws because I'm not obstructing the rights of others. \n\nIf I ever post something like this again you can just keep scrolling if if it offends you instead of telling me how out oft line I am (radical). I'm really sorry I'm offended by religious indoctrination and had the balls to say something about it in a public manner [I live around and have a lot of Christian friends]. Criticism is not radicalism and that is all I have to say on the matter.\n\nK: Did you just keep scrolling when you saw that documentary instead of commenting and criticizing it? No, face it you just did what I apparently did to your picture.\n\nAnd if your an atheist why do you want to watch those things. You know what they are about and only get you angry which lead to discussions like this. You do not see me watching atheist movies do you? \n\nK (cont.): It's totally fine if you believe that nothing exists but you have to know that you are headed towards a long journey of frustration trying to convince others that nothing exists. Just as your belief is comforting to you... \n\nThere is a higher percentage of individuals that take comfort in believing in higher powers weather it's God, Buddha, Jesus, ..... But you can't expect others to feel the same or agree ... \n\nYou need to agree to disagree with people and focus on your own belief instead of focusing on mine. I don't focus on yours and post what I think is wrong with it.... There I'm done now.\n\nMe: \n\n1. Jesus Camp was an anti - religious movie and I highly praise it.\n\n2. This was never directed at your personal beliefs, only the religion as a whole. \n\n3. This debate started because you were focusing on my opinion instead minding your own business like you've been trying to convince me to do.\n\nK: If I didn't mind my own business and cared about your opinion we would have had another debate about your keychain [in regards to a previous post showing off my boss-ass atheist key chain I got]. That would be crossing the line for me since it has all to do with you and what you believe. But since you decided to put up something that believe it or not involves me because I am a Christian, wanted to say something. And I also wasn't going to comment until I saw facts that were not true. [facts that weren't true...interesting use of an oxymoron].\n\nThe fact [more facts, yay!] is you can't be surprised if you post something that has been controversial for years and not expect someone to say something. Even if you were not intentionally targeting me personally By putting something like that up makes me and other common Christians look like they act that way since I share the same beliefs. \n\nPlease understand that if you post something that is putting down someone's faith they are going to take it personal, just the same as you would if I posted the things I thought was wrong with yours.\n\nMe: OK I'm done debating with you. Religious indoctrination is a fact, a very true one at that. I know you're never going to see a child feeling guilty and fearing hell for doing something completely natural as psychological child abuse but I do and I'm speaking up about it. This post has personal significance to me and I wasn't going to stay silent. \n\nSay what you want about atheism, I don't care, but be ready for me to either disregard it or point out any misconception I see. Religious indoctrination is not a misconception it occurs all over the world in every religion. \n\nMy original caption was addressing organized religion as a whole and not your faith in particular. The photo acts as an example of where this child abuse takes place and it just so happened to be Evangelism.\n",

He is definitely under-subscribed.\n\nI am interested to know what folks here think of his approach, and whether his strategies would be more broadly applicable to conversations with theists generally. And I am *keenly* interested in how these techniques could be used as effectively in an online setting, which is where much of the discussion surrounding belief seems to take place these days. Is this kind of sincere and empathetic approach suited for what can sometimes seem a heartless electronic medium?",

I can't remember how the topic came up (I most likely said something) but we began to talk about what it was like losing our religion (we're in the south of the US so christianity is kind of a big thing).  We talked about the fears associated with no longer being able to rely on the old catch phrase \"god did it\" and having to realize that there's just some stuff we don't know (at least yet).  We talked about social pressures and how our family reacted (or how mine didn't as I have never told them and don't plan on it).  All in all it was really cathartic to have this discussion and since I just learned about /r/TrueAtheism I thought that I'd have this discussion with you all.  Hopefully it can be as theraputic to everyone here as it was to me!\n\nSo, what were your biggest struggles with leaving your religion?  How did everyone react?  What is your feeling towards religious people now?  If you were always an atheist then how do you view religious people and people questioning/losing their religion?",

The doctors are giving her a week to 2 weeks to live without medicine, so I'm getting hit emotionally here...\n\nThere was something about how our bodies will dissolve and turn back into the stuff made of stars and how the dead live on in our memories and so forth...\n\nDoes anyone know of this few paragraph speech? I can't seem to google it at the moment, but I really need to read it...\n\nEDIT: Finally found it....\n\n“You want a physicist to speak at your funeral. You want the physicist to talk to your grieving family about the conservation of energy, so they will understand that your energy has not died. You want the physicist to remind your sobbing mother about the first law of thermodynamics; that no energy gets created in the universe, and none is destroyed. You want your mother to know that all your energy, every vibration, every Btu of heat, every wave of every particle that was her beloved child remains with her in this world. You want the physicist to tell your weeping father that amid energies of the cosmos, you gave as good as you got.\n\nAnd at one point you’d hope that the physicist would step down from the pulpit and walk to your brokenhearted spouse there in the pew and tell him/her that all the photons that ever bounced off your face, all the particles whose paths were interrupted by your smile, by the touch of your hair, hundreds of trillions of particles, have raced off like children, their ways forever changed by you. And as your widow rocks in the arms of a loving family, may the physicist let him/her know that all the photons that bounced from you were gathered in the particle detectors that are her/his eyes, that those photons created within her/him constellations of electromagnetically charged neurons whose energy will go on forever.\n\nAnd the physicist will remind the congregation of how much of all our energy is given off as heat. There may be a few fanning themselves with their programs as he says it. And he will tell them that the warmth that flowed through you in life is still here, still part of all that we are, even as we who mourn continue the heat of our own lives.\nAnd you’ll want the physicist to explain to those who loved you that they need not have faith; indeed, they should not have faith. Let them know that they can measure, that scientists have measured precisely the conservation of energy and found it accurate, verifiable and consistent across space and time. You can hope your family will examine the evidence and satisfy themselves that the science is sound and that they’ll be comforted to know your energy’s still around. According to the law of the conservation of energy, not a bit of you is gone; you’re just less orderly.”\n~Aaron Freeman",

Specifically, animism is used in the anthropology of religion as a term for the belief system or cosmology of some indigenous tribal peoples, especially prior to the development and/or infiltration of colonialism and organized religion.”\n&gt; \n&gt; Anthropologists believe that animism represents the earliest beginnings of the evolution of religion on Earth, and that it probably originated before homo sapiens. Animism may not be an organized religion with a pantheon of gods, but it is still part of an informal egonovist religious belief system that exists today. Because it is religion, faith, and theism, the belief in spirits and horoscopes cannot be congruent with atheism.\n&gt; \n&gt; As to demons, devils, and angels, they all are forms of deities. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Demons comes from Greek mythology and are later used in Abrahamic religions; in both instances they represent a type of god or demigod. They possess supernatural powers bestowed upon them by a deity.  In fact, in the Hebrew Bible sacrifices were offered to powerful demons. In Christianity demons are literally angels. \n&gt; \n&gt; Devils only exist in dualistic theology where they are in fact a deity that is as powerful as, and is the antithesis to, the creator god. \n&gt; \n&gt; Angels come from Zoroastrianism where they are a manifestation of God. In Judaism they are literally an aspect of God, and in Christianity they evolved into  messengers of God. \n&gt; \n&gt; In all cases, in order to accept the existence of demons, devils, or angels, one must first accept the premise that at least one deity exists. \n\n\n\nThere is controversy around the point of whether or not one can be an atheist and still believe in angels and the great juju of the sea. \n\nIt's important to understand that there are non-theistic religions, however, non-theisitic ≠ atheistic.\n\nFor example, Janism is considered a non-theistic religion; it believes in a god, but not one that is a creator. They're also not atheists.\n\nAnimism isn't the name of any formal religion, rather it's something that anthropologists have invented, and that we use as a classification; because everything needs a name. That said, in an animistic religion there is not a deity that is individually worshiped as a creator, however there is a universal higher power that keeps all of the spirits organized and in the right place. It makes sure that the rock spirit resides in a rock, and that the sun spirit does its job of coming out, and so on. Like Janism, these are considered to be non-theistic religions, but they are not atheistic. \n\nI feel that if you believe that the great wuwu of the ocean is a spirit who makes the ties come in, then you're not an atheist.\n\nSo, let's discuss this article and these points. \n",
