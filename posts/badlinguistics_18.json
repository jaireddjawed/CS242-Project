        "text": "[Source](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/books/review/the-high-mountains-of-portugal-by-yann-martel.html)\n\nHere's the offending portion:\n&gt;Crucial to the mood of the narrative is the Portuguese concept of saudade, an untranslatable word that conveys a desire for a past moment that may be forever unattainable. Saudade bleeds into the Portuguese language, which sounds, as Martel puts it, like “a slurred mournful whisper.” It can also manifest itself in the country’s people; one man notes that everyone he encounters “smells of time and radiates solitude.” \n\nThe specific badling in Broida's review of Martel's book is the claim that *saudade* is untranslatable, meaning of course that there is no single corresponding word in English. He then provides a translation in the same sentence. \n\nWhat seems even more suspect is the idea (apparently Martel's) that the very Portuguese language as spoken by everyone at all times \"sounds . . . like a 'slurred mournful whisper,'\" because *saudade* \"bleeds into\" it. This sounds like some kind of magic. The Portuguese of course are capable of shouting, cursing and speaking \"at a normal volume\"; their language is not an impediment to these ways of speaking. \n\nThe last bit isn't so much badling but a stereotype of Portuguese people. I guess we should give Martel a pass since it is a novel, though. ",
