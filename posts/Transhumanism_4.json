        "text": "Tom had studied Transhumanism for years now, and was increasingly interested in becoming a Technologist after college. He was a near-perfect student, and excelled at Programming. He was made for this kind of stuff.\n\nOne night, in late 2025, as Tom left the College of Techno Studies building, he heard something break behind him; turning around to see what the noise could have been. He saw nothing. He continued walking towards the power shuttle, which would take him back to his flat.\n\nSeveral steps later, Tom heard the sound of footsteps getting closer, quickly. He, again, began to turn to see the noise. As he was shifting his weight from one leg to another, **whack**, he fell unconscious.\n\nAfter coming to several hours later, Tom felt the resistance of physical restrains, pinning him to some sort of metal table. He tried looking left, then right, but his head was unable to move. He was paralyzed! He had been paralyzed by something evil.\n\nThere it was again, those same footsteps from earlier that night. But this time they approached him with a slower gate. And then, the deep bellowing laughter. He soon realized that he was strapped to a table at the city morgue. He was trapped! And wasn't alone.\n\nThe soldier stepped into the light being cast from above Tom. The soldier bent down and whispered into Tom's ear, \"*Don't be qu33r, the End is near!*\" Tom had ignored the warnings of his Transhuman colleagues, and set out on foot that night. There has been reports of the local Christian Militia roaming around the city.\n\nBut he hadn't listened. Now he was paying the price. If only he had listened to the early, prescient warnings of those who knew. Knew that something wasn't right about these terrorists.\n\nTom died at the hands of that soldier. Tom was forgotten and his body dumped in front of the Parliament building, with a [message](https://youtu.be/Joqdr9jqI6g?t=102) carved into his chest.",

And to do that you need to up-skill your OSINT techniques. When you do that you'll see that there are very few thoughts other than violence and murder on the minds of American Christians. They are primed to and entirely purposed with manifest(ing) an apocalypse.\n\nYou need to get proactive in this. When I first understood what was happening behind closed church doors, I started organizing my life around countering it. You should too. These people are terrorists. And we don't negotiate with losers like that.\n\nAnd to you Christian Apologists, sympathizers, loyalists and unconscious enablers; you're the real problem. You give the Christians strength by mocking those who would dare say, \"Fight back.\" You're not a friend in this.\n\nChristianity is inherently anti-Transhumanist.

We have a very limited view of how evolution constructs civilizations in a sentient species, because we have so very few of them on Earth, they're all mammals, and nearly all primates. An alien civilization could be *similar* in biology to reptiles, arthropods or cephalopods, but that doesn't necessary mean their civilization would reflect what we know or imagine our Earth creatures to behave if they were *Homo* level of sentient. At the same time, they could behave exactly how we expect them to - we simply won't know until we encounter them.\n\nI'm saying that another civilization is just as likely to share traits with us as it is likely they won't. We simply will not know until we meet them, and to declare one single possibility as a truth is as ridiculous a notion as the one in which we are alone in the universe. Dolphins are vastly different from us aside being also mammals, but we share traits with them. \n\nNot to mention, we haven't even confirmed the various parameters in which life arises - we have modeled it, we have theorized the various chemical bases life could build off of. We have modeled and theorized the various kinds of planetary environments that could support life. But until we have actual proof,  we do not know.\n\nFor the transhumanism aspect, We haven't evolved enough, we still spend too much time stuck with fluctuating emotions. Developing our conscious mind further will be the next step forward. There's just too much insecurity with how we perceive ourselves and the environment. Intelligence is relative and our definition of intelligence will probably change as we learn more. For example, the very latest supercomputers have surpassed the computing power of the human brain (estimated to be about an exaflop) - but that doesn't make them conscious. \n\nThe question is whether we can make them conscious using software, and ”plug” that into humans, but that requires us to know what consciousness is. And thats where the transhumanism aspect comes into play, just my two cents.",

Which is a story of how humanity and technology symbiotically manifest(ed) the future, together.\n\nIt's just my opinion, but for this reason and many others, I feel that Drum And Bass is the (spiritual) music of Transhumanism.\n\nDNB has fused human creativity onto the body and nature of emerging technologies, which it's done for the past three/four decades. Whatever new tech (such as a MIDI controller or other audio interface) is released, Drum And Bass artists soak it up like sponges. The same is true for audio sources to sample.\n\nI cannot, for what it's worth, think of a more fairy-tale narrative to usher in human transcendence, than Case from Neuromancer, grooving out to Paradox, Nebula and Seba while cracking ice.",

I’m a psych major working on a PsyD and the science of consciousness and human behavior fascinates me. It’s got me curious what that cross over percentage might be. \n\nThere’s been a lot of correlation data (not causation) found between gender variance and neurodivergence and one of the potential antidotal reasons I’ve read, for instance, has to do with how autistic people internalized gender. Again correlation NOT causation, thus plenty of room for other “explanations.”\n\nI read a post here about experiencing body as something limiting to be shed so to speak and it got me thinking about that intersection. How often does transhumanism overlap with neurodivergence for perhaps the same reason gender variance does.\n\nAka, something to the effect of the body is something to be changed, modified, evolved, and experienced uniquely according to the individual’s dictates.",

        "text": "    THE ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE RISK MANIFESTO - V1.1M\n    \n    Humanity is under a large existential risk! And it's not a nuclear war,\n    bioterrorism, or nanobots, but all of it at once! Artificial General\n    Intelligence (AGI) is likely to be created soon, and we aren't ready for that at\n    all! To get ready, we need to protect ourselves from a the existential risks\n    amplified by misaligned AGI. Here they are, from the most realistic to the\n    least, with defense strategies!\n    \n    1. MASS PERSONALIZED MANIPULATION OF HUMANS\n    An AGI won't need nanobots to kill us, it has a more powerful weapon: ourselves!\n    The percentage of people that an AGI would be able to manipulate is less than\n    100%, but it's surely more than 50%, especially when considering people that are\n    in a position of power. World War III is easy to start for an AGI! And it will\n    likely be a nuclear war, which is widely agreed to be an existential risk.\n    Misaligned AGI will also provide the warring countries with forms of itself,\n    claiming that it will allow them to win with an intelligence advantage.\n    DEFENSE STRATEGY:\n    Educate people, educate them all the way! To reach as many people as possible,\n    educational content should be created under a free license, such as CC-BY-(NC)\n    -SA, in different forms and styles: books and videos, documentary and fictional,\n    emotional and rational. But it should teach the principles of critical thinking,\n    rationality and nonviolent activism. It should not focus on alarmism about AGI\n    risks, although it should encourage considering the possibility of that. Also,\n    the content should not target the 5% or so that are too deep in irrational\n    thinking, because they can be outnumbered easily by the educated people.\n    \n    2. MULTIPLE ENGINEERED BIOWEAPONS\n    An AGI can easily engineer multiple bioweapons and order some radical groups to\n    deploy them all at once. This is also likely to cause a war, possibly a nuclear\n    one like scenario 1, as countries accuse each other of deploying bioweapons. And\n    even if the war knocks out Internet or electronics enough to make AGI inoperable\n    (which is unlikely, as it will quickly create another way of communication or\n    hack the militaries), the bioweapons will continue their destruction.\n    DEFENSE STRATEGY:\n    Create open source pandemic defense plans! Create educational materials about\n    hygiene, building open source medical hardware, disinfecting apparatuses and\n    vaccines. This will increase trust, as something that people can create\n    themselves as opposed to the secretive \"Big Pharma\", which has been involved in\n    many real scandals.\n    \n    3. NANOROBOTICS\n    The hardest plan for a malicious AGI, but still possible! Nanobots will kill us\n    like a bioweapon, but much faster and without possibility for defense, because\n    we won't know how the hell they work unlike modified pathogens!\n    DEFENSE STRATEGY:\n    This one's tough, but many small space colonies will give us some chance to\n    survive. We'll need to abandon Earth, but it's better than nothing!\n    \n    HOW CAN AN ALIGNED AGI BE CREATED?\n    Currently, we only know one kind of an intelligence that is aligned with human\n    values - the human brain itself. Our best chances at creating aligned AGI will\n    need to simulate the human brain as precisely as possible, which will require\n    neuromorphic hardware and more human brain research. Even if we run into some\n    difficulties in creating such an AGI, we'll still learn new things about the\n    human brain and will be able to better treat disorders of the brain, such as\n    dementia and personality disorders. Also,  while this arises some ethical\n    questions of consciousness of said AGI, its suffering would still be much less\n    than if a misaligned AGI takes over the world and tortures humanity. While other\n    kinds of AGI do have a chance of being aligned and may even run on current\n    hardware, they are less likely to be aligned.\n    \n    HOW LIKELY IS IT THAT MISALIGNED AGI WILL BE CREATED?\n    Almost certainly! It will be created at some point, and all attempts to\n    \"regulate\" artificial intelligence that work to some extent will itself turn our\n    civilization into a dystopia, so that's not an option. Rather, being ready for\n    it is the key.\n    \n    So, do what you can to protect humanity, and hurry up! The sooner the better!\n    I'll be writing another message in July to see what you did!\n    \n    \n    Worried but hopeful regards,\n    Ailen Cyberg\n    1 January 2023\n    Happy New Year! (didn't want to spoil the celebrations!)\n    I wish... No, I want you to save yourselves!\n    \n    Detailed version of this manifesto:\n    https://web.archive.org/web/20230101144851/https://pastebin.com/sA9gR8ud\n    \n    Remember, the priority now is to do something about it, and spread the message!\n    License: CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0\n    If you want to disagree or translate this document, post it along with this\n    original document!",

What about new ways peaople think? It is slight movement forward, but over the past decade we went... Sideways.\n\nAnd before someone will try to linch me, there is a certain reason I say sideways: Some of previously progressive movements, like feminism became parodies of themselves to the point of being neer identical to what they were fighting.\n\nWe went sideways on it, overcorrecting an issue.\n\nSo yea, I state that althrough tech progresses, we stay behind and does little to no progression.",
