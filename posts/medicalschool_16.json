It takes us 4 hours to round, and it‚Äôs mostly travel time. We‚Äôre literally walking to a room, talking outside of it, and then walking away.\n\nOur team is **huge** (5 FLOCs, 2 seniors, 2 attendings, 2 clerkship students, a resource resident, and a CTA). We could easily table round, see whoever needs to be seen, and divide tasks. Instead, tasks are crammed into the 4.5 hours before handoff (when we‚Äôre also admitting). Parents are mad because they were told that they‚Äôd get discharged in the morning and it never happens. Every consult is called needlessly late because it takes forever to discuss patients. There‚Äôs a platoon of us blocking the hallways.\n\nI honestly wish I knew why attendings do this. It‚Äôs inefficient, everyone dislikes it, and we aren‚Äôt even learning, because we aren‚Äôt seeing patients. What‚Äôs the point?",

I hope you don't let the disrespect often shown from other professions convince you that what you've done so far is anything short of miraculous. Everyone here deserves to be unbelievably proud‚Äînay, arrogant, even‚Äîof what they've accomplished.\n\nI am so grateful for your efforts, and so proud of how far you've come.

I spoke with the residents and asked what I should do. They gave me the PD and the APD‚Äôs emails. I emailed them immediately as well as the program coordinator. \n\nThe second week I still had no response back from anyone. One of the other sub-Is was going to check out their research facility and I tagged along. Side note: I worked in this specific field for a year, did research in this topic, and presented it at the international conference months prior. I start asking questions to the doc and he quickly realizes I am more up to date than he on the topic (his words) and he excitedly invites me to meet the team. \n\nHe finds out through the residents that I am without an interview and says he will write to the PD. To cover my bases I speak with my current attending who says he will write me a letter as well. Later the next week an attending from a different department's mother is in the hospital and I have been taking care of her. I find a key piece to the puzzle and my attending comes to confirm. The other attending sings my praises as I have spent significant time with her and her sick mom.\n\nThird week I hear nothin but there is this case conference on a complex patient and I am tasked with describing the pathophys and how it relates to the patient. The disease process is not well understood so I spent a significant amount of time reading papers, listening to podcasts and reviewing textbooks. I give my presentation at the conference (on zoom) and the APD emails me immediately saying ‚ÄúThat was the best presentation on \\_\\_\\_\\_ that I have ever seen.‚Äù\n\nI emailed back saying thank you and ‚ÄúYo, can I have an interview?‚Äù He gives some cryptic non answer. Week 4 I decide to leave the rotation early as there is a storm and I want to make it home for Christmas. My main attending gives me 4/4 on all of my marks. I speak with a resident who has a yearly review with the PD and he says he is going to vouch for me and ask for an interview. \n\nI leave the rotation, head home for Christmas, and a few days later I received the interview invite.\n\nI cannot describe how miserable it was rotating here without an interview and being so pissed every day. The support from the residents and med students as well as seeing my patients every day got me through.\n\nIn my actual interview I was asked ‚ÄúWhat was a time recently where you had to use emotional intelligence in the workplace.‚Äù I said \"On the first day of my rotation with you I received a rejection letter and chose to continue to rotate the entire month.\" The interviewer did not know that piece of info lol.

So, 6 years med school could take 10 years if you are not studying enough. \n\nI'm now in my 6th year, and i still have an exam from the fourth called patological anatomy, and it's one of the hardest exams in Italy. It contains 96 hours of lectures, and the exam is 4 questions oral test. \n\nI really find it difficult to study a subject i don't like, i really dislike this subject and have difficulty passing it. It made me feel like I'm not good enough for medicine. It made me question my career path, and if I'm going to be a good doctor or not.\n\nDid you feel like that during med school? And if so, how did you surpass this feeling?",

Do you believe he is that committed to changing medical curriculum or do we think that he just realized he could make more money with this product than as an academic hospitalist?\n\nI have really appreciated Online MedEd, and I do enjoy watching Dustyn's lectures more than other online videos, but I don't think I can justify paying for it if he's hiding his intentions for changing his platform under virtue signaling. The attempt at making emotional connection with students just seemed out of place in his announcement video.",

        "text": "**Scores:**\n\nNBME 25 - 57%\n\nNBME 30 - 65%\n\nNBME 27 - 74%\n\nUWSA2 - 70%\n\nNBME CBSE - 75%\n\nFree 120 - 80%\n\nStep 1 - PASS\n\n**Dedicated:**\n\nWhen dedicated started, I almost felt manic. My class had just finished our last in-house block exam and we were immediately set loose to start studying. The problem that I very quickly faced was that I had no plan or idea of where to even start. I talked to upperclassmen and friends who had previously taken step and tried to read Reddit posts of people's daily schedules but everyone had a different suggestion. I kept questioning myself for days on end if I was doing it all right. In short, there was and is no right way to prepare for step and everyone eventually finds their own strategy. About two weeks into my prep after finally feeling somewhat comfortable with the routine I had adopted, my girlfriend of over 2 years decided that it would be best if we didn't see each other seriously anymore. I felt devastated not only because she was my companion in life but also a major supporter that I relied on in the academic world. It felt like I had actually hit rock bottom at this point. After some time, I think I painfully came to accept that it was just another challenge that life unexpectedly decided to throw at me and that either with or without her, I would still be the person who had to put in the work every single day to see a passing score on release day. Day in and day out, I stuck to my morning anki's, daily UW questions (anywhere from 40-90 depending on how I was feeling), and outside resources to review during or after my questions. My NBME scores were going on an upward trend and I started to finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. However, towards the tail end of the process, my energy and stamina felt like it was slowly being sucked out of me. After our school designated CBSE exam (another NBME) and only one week before step, I felt EXHAUSTED. It felt like every simple anki card was a book in length and that even the energy it took to move my lips to drink another sip of coffee was equivalent to that of running a marathon. My brain was fried and some days I couldn't even remember what I had for lunch just two hours earlier let alone anything I had learned the day before. I finally reached true burnout for the first time in medical school. I wasn't anxious or worried about the practice exams anymore or whether I would pass step or not.  I took the free 120 3 days before my exam, scored an 80% and was so tired that I slept for almost the remainder of the day. At this point, I asked myself how in the hell I was going to survive this 8-hour beast of an exam if I was pooped out after a 3-hour exam. To be honest, I wasn't entirely sure. I tried to keep reminding myself of all the previous hours I had spent staring at a screen for the past couple of weeks, that it was all somewhere buried deep inside my brain, and that hopefully the gods of medicine would be grateful to me on test day. The day before I didn't dare touch a single resource, anki card or anything medical related. To be honest, I couldn't have even mustered up the energy if I wanted to. Regardless, this was probably the best day of dedicated. I finally didn't have to probe my brain every second trying to recall some minuscule detail or buzzword that would get me another question right. It was finally time to rest. The following day, I walked out of the testing center, not feeling necessarily pummeled by the exam but rather how I felt taking the NBMEs. Some things I knew and some things I didn't really know, but at least I tried answering every question to the best of my ability. \n\n**\\*\\*** For those of you who are interested in my day-to-day routine, I documented what I did every single day in order in an excel spreadsheet. I don't think it allows me to upload the excel file directly but will attach a picture of what it looked like. I'd be happy to send it to any of those who want it!\n\n**Resources:**\n\n\\- UWorld (40-90 Q's/day depending on how I was feeling) - my take on UWorld... It is a **learning** tool and should be used the best way you can learn from it. Some people like all random, timed. Some people like section specific, tutored. Do what works best for **you**. For me, that was going system by system on tutored mode.  For example, I would spend two or three days just working on all the immuno questions on UWorld. I felt like it gave me all of the angles I could see a question of that subject matter be thrown at me and allowed me to fine-tune my knowledge of that subject. Plus it felt SO much easier reviewing the same subject later in the day as opposed to jumping between a different subject to review every question. Towards the end of dedicated, I started doing a couple more random blocks just to simulate what the test day would be like but I felt like I was getting enough of that by doing a practice exam every week. \n\n\\- Pathoma - as written many times on this sub before, chapters 1-3 are a must. There is no way around it. It takes time to listen to but speed it up or write down the \"this is high yield\" stuff he says on a sticky note and put it on the front of the book like I did. Also, I still think I have a month or a couple left on my pathoma account if anyone would like to use it.\n\n\\-Sketchy - I actually really liked sketchy's pathophysiology section. Felt like I used that predominantly during the semester. Actually I never really touched pathoma until dedicated so, yes, I used sketchy path. So many questions I had gotten right on the practice exams and even the real deal just from the picture memory hooks sketchy incorporated. Also, used for micro and pharm (both not really heavily tested on my exam)\n\n\\-Anki - I lived and died by anki during the school semester. I honestly thought it was the reason I did so well in pre-clinical. I am a firm believer in spaced repetition and it's what kept the information I learned at the beginning of dedicated solidified in my brain until the very end. For every incorrect question I missed, I either found an associated anki card for it or made my own that I thought was better. \n\n\\-Random resources (Golijan lectures, mehlmanmedical notes) - some days I would just get tired af from reading explanation after explanantion from Uworld or just wanted to throw a different topic in my brain so I listened to Golijan lectures on spotify. He gives great HY information while also somehow making you laugh every now and then in the process. Mehlmanmedical notes is something I wish I would've looked at sooner. Has a document for pretty much every system and covers the high yields, questions and how examiners like to trick students like GOLD. \n\nIf anyone has any questions, please comment or message me! Now that my test is officially over with, I want to pay it forward to those who helped me and help anyone I can. Let's get that pass, fam!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/09amdd9q97la1.png?width=1578&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=32d13325f199dfd9bd137aada8bcf4c4abb5bb76",
