Didn't God also say that whatever you feel in your heart is right, shouldn't come with any anxiety, fear, or worry?  So what if suicide is the only thing that brings that person solace?\n\nAnd also:  Before you attempt suicide, if you apologize and pray to God beforehand that you did it and were really remorseful and sorry, would you still go to heaven?\n\nThis is just something I wondered and any feedback would be greatly appreciated.",

        "text": "[**Link in French**](https://www.slate.fr/story/170775/einstein-sciences-religion-dieu-foi-hasard-rationnalite)\n\n translation below\n\n## «La science sans la religion est boiteuse, la religion sans la science est aveugle», estimait le célèbre physicien.\n\n[Artist Ottmar Hoerl's installation featuring 500 sculptures of Albert Einstein on May 6, 2018 in Munich, Germany. ](https://preview.redd.it/8mwcc649hv6a1.png?width=1060&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5434a5f2721f1f9dd5b6e0e14719edc53479d57)\n\n Lors d’une conférence à Zurich en 1979, l'auteur [Friedrich Dürrenmatt](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_D%C3%BCrrenmatt) osa dire d’Einstein: *«Il parlait si souvent de Dieu que je le soupçonne presque d’avoir été un théologien déguisé.»*\n\nLe fameux physicien se sert effectivement avec complaisance du mot «Dieu». C’est par exemple la phrase souvent répétée, et qui sera commentée ici, *«Je refuse de croire en un Dieu qui joue aux dés avec le monde»*, ou bien *«Dieu est subtil, mais il n’est pas malveillant»*.\n\n### Rejet de l'autorité religieuse\n\nCes fréquentes références n’indiquent qu’une tournure de langage à usage symbolique. De fait, il n’attribua jamais d’importance aux aspects formels d’une croyance. Pour lui, l’émerveillement devant les lois de l’univers doit tenir lieu de religion, cet élan mystique ayant pour corollaire un sentiment d’obligation morale envers les semblables.\n\nSa jeunesse le confronte à différentes religions: la foi juive familiale, puis un enseignement catholique dans une école de Munich, suivi par un enseignement israélite au lycée; sa première épouse sera grecque orthodoxe.\n\nCe faisant, il découvrit que les récits bibliques ne concordaient pas avec l’image de la nature qu’il se faisait à partir d’écrits scientifiques. Son esprit refusant ce qu’il ne comprenait pas, il rejeta toute forme d’autorité religieuse.\n\nNommé à l’université de Prague, il rejoignit la communauté hébraïque, les développements politiques et l’antisémitisme ambiant firent de lui un partisan engagé du sionisme. Ceci explique qu’à la fondation d’Israël, on lui proposa d’en devenir président –ce qu’il refusa, arguant que la physique ne l’avait pas préparé à parler aux hommes.\n\n**À LIRE AUSSI** [Einstein, le sioniste doux](https://www.slate.fr/tribune/84023/einstein-sioniste-doux)\n\n### Hasard et foi\n\nDans *Neige de printemps*, l'écrivain [Yukio Mishima](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukio_Mishima) esquisse un rapport entre Dieu et le hasard: *«Parler du hasard, c’est nier la possibilité de toute loi de cause à effet. Le hasard est finalement l’unique élément irrationnel que peut accepter le libre arbitre… Ce concept du hasard, de la chance, constitue la substance même du Dieu des Européens, ils possèdent là une divinité qui tire ses caractéristiques de ce refuge si essentiel au libre arbitre.»*\n\nLe hasard, parce qu’il mesure notre ignorance, semble lié à l’idée de Dieu; sinon, pourquoi prierait-on dans les moments incertains? Mais justement, le scientifique s’attache à restreindre le domaine de l’inconnu. Une éclipse de Soleil s’interprétait comme un signe maléfique, avant que la mécanique céleste ne l’ait rabaissé à un événement prédictible.\n\nLe hasard dépend de notre niveau de connaissance, et il était sans doute plus naturel d’avoir la foi dans les temps anciens, quand l’être humain vivait dans un monde limité et plein de mystères. Aujourd’hui, la science nous révèle un immense univers dont on comprend *grosso modo* le mode de fonctionnement. Elle déshumanise le monde, or l’idée de Dieu est éminemment humaine. Burton Richter, Prix Nobel de physique en 1976, [déclara néanmoins](https://apnews.com/da593d8b1a70c9415a69ac1b0bf134f4): *«Découvrir une loi scientifique, c’est lire ce qui est écrit dans le cerveau de Dieu.»*\n\nDans un univers entièrement déterministe et prédictible, il n’y a plus de place pour le surnaturel. La physique classique donne une réalité du monde connue de tout temps, puisque l'on remonte vers le passé et que l'on prédit l’avenir en appliquant les équations consacrées. Einstein voudrait qu’il en soit toujours ainsi, mais justement, le déterminisme strict bute sur le déroutant hasard quantique.\n\nLa mécanique quantique introduit un hasard obligatoire: on ne sait prédire la simple trajectoire d’un électron. La physique devient probabiliste, et seule la répartition d’une population d’électrons est calculable, soumise à un «déterminisme faible». Cela semble indiquer l’existence d’une réalité qui existe au-delà de l’espace-temps, ou du moins au-delà de notre compréhension\n\n### Rationalité du monde\n\nEinstein s’est efforcé de rétablir le déterminisme fort dans l’infiniment petit en imaginant des «variables cachées», et sa réflexion sur Dieu joueur de dés cristallise sa suspicion envers le caractère aléatoire de la théorie. Prise au pied de la lettre, sa fameuse phrase suggère qu’il préférerait croire en Dieu!\n\n*«L’expérience religieuse cosmique est la plus noble, la plus forte qui puisse surgir d’une recherche scientifique profonde.»*\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nEinstein défend la rationalité de la nature. La faculté d’invention humaine produit des concepts entre lesquels l’intelligence sélectionne la théorie, qui par sa simplicité logique se montrera supérieure, l’expérience devant *in fine* la valider.\n\nL’étonnement devant cet aspect rationnel du monde tourne en admiration, et ceci reste, pour Einstein, l’une des plus fortes racines du sentiment religieux: *«L’expérience religieuse cosmique est la plus noble, la plus forte qui puisse surgir d’une recherche scientifique profonde. Celui qui ne comprend pas les formidables efforts, le don de soi, sans quoi rien ne se crée de nouveau dans la pensée scientifique, celui-là ne saurait évaluer la force du sentiment qui seul peut faire naître une telle œuvre, éloignée comme elle est de l’immédiate vie pratique.»*\n\nCeci résonne avec Proust: *«Il n’y a aucune raison pour que nous nous croyions obligés à faire le bien, pour l’artiste athée à ce qu’il se croie obligé de recommencer vingt fois un morceau dont l’admiration qu’il excitera importera peu à son corps mangé par les vers. Toutes ces obligations qui n’ont pas leur sanction dans la vie présente semblent appartenir à un monde différent fondé sur la bonté, le scrupule, le sacrifice, un monde dont nous sortons pour naître à cette terre, avant peut-être d’y retourner vivre sous l’emprise de ces lois inconnues auxquelles nous avons obéi parce que nous en portions l’enseignement en nous sans savoir qui les avait tracées.»* Et l’écrivain ajoute dans une lettre: *«*\\[…\\] *Réveiller en nous ce fond mystérieux de notre âme* \\[…\\] *et qu’on peut appeler pour cela religieux.»*\n\n**À LIRE AUSSI** [Bioéthique: il est temps d'assumer les capacités démiurgiques de la science](https://www.slate.fr/story/159712/sciences-bioethique-crispr-cas9-genetique-jouer-a-dieu-medecine)\n\n**▬▬▬▬▬ translation ▬▬▬▬▬**\n\n**During a lecture in Zurich in 1979, the author Friedrich Dürrenmatt dared to say of Einstein: \"He spoke so often of God that I almost suspect him of having been a theologian in disguise.\"**\n\nThe famous physicist does indeed use the word \"God\" complacently. This is for example the oft-repeated phrase, which will be commented on here, \"I refuse to believe in a God who plays dice with the world,\" or \"God is subtle, but he is not malevolent.\"\n\n**Rejection of religious authority**\n\nThese frequent references indicate only a symbolic use of language. In fact, he never attributed importance to the formal aspects of a belief. For him, wonder at the laws of the universe must take the place of religion, this mystical impulse having as a corollary a feeling of moral obligation towards fellow human beings.\n\nHis youth brought him into contact with different religions: his family's Jewish faith, then a Catholic education in a Munich school, followed by a Jewish education in high school; his first wife was Greek Orthodox.\n\nIn the process, he discovered that the biblical accounts did not agree with the picture of nature he had formed from scientific writings. His mind rejected what he did not understand, and he rejected all forms of religious authority.\n\nAppointed to the University of Prague, he joined the Hebrew community, and the political developments and the prevailing anti-Semitism made him a committed supporter of Zionism. This explains why, when Israel was founded, he was asked to become its president, which he refused, arguing that physics had not prepared him to talk to men.\n\nREAD ALSO Einstein, the gentle Zionist\n\n**Chance and faith**\n\nIn Spring Snow, the writer Yukio Mishima sketches a relationship between God and chance: \"To speak of chance is to deny the possibility of any law of cause and effect. Chance is finally the only irrational element that free will can accept... This concept of chance, of luck, constitutes the very substance of the God of the Europeans, they possess there a divinity that draws its characteristics from this refuge so essential to free will.\"\n\nChance, because it measures our ignorance, seems linked to the idea of God; otherwise, why would we pray in uncertain moments? But precisely, the scientist is concerned with narrowing the realm of the unknown. An eclipse of the Sun was interpreted as an evil sign, before celestial mechanics reduced it to a predictable event.\n\nChance depends on our level of knowledge, and it was probably more natural to have faith in ancient times, when human beings lived in a limited world full of mysteries. Today, science reveals to us an immense universe of which we understand roughly the way it works. It dehumanizes the world, yet the idea of God is eminently human. Burton Richter, winner of the 1976 Nobel Prize in Physics, nevertheless declared: \"To discover a scientific law is to read what is written in the brain of God.\"\n\nIn an entirely deterministic and predictable universe, there is no room for the supernatural. Classical physics gives a reality of the world known from all time, since we go back to the past and predict the future by applying the consecrated equations. Einstein would like it to be always like that, but strict determinism comes up against the puzzling quantum chance.\n\nQuantum mechanics introduces an obligatory randomness: we cannot predict the simple trajectory of an electron. Physics becomes probabilistic, and only the distribution of a population of electrons is calculable, subject to a \"weak determinism\". This seems to indicate the existence of a reality that exists beyond space-time, or at least beyond our understanding\n\n**Rationality of the world**\n\nEinstein tried to re-establish strong determinism in the infinitely small by imagining \"hidden variables\", and his reflection on God the dice player crystallizes his suspicion towards the randomness of the theory. Taken literally, his famous sentence suggests that he would prefer to believe in God!\n\n\"The cosmic religious experience is the noblest, the strongest that can arise from deep scientific research.\"\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nEinstein defends the rationality of nature. The human faculty of invention produces concepts between which the intelligence selects the theory, which by its logical simplicity will show itself superior, the experiment having to validate it in fine.\n\nThe astonishment in front of this rational aspect of the world turns into admiration, and this remains, for Einstein, one of the strongest roots of the religious feeling: \"The cosmic religious experience is the noblest, the strongest that can arise from a deep scientific research. He who does not understand the tremendous efforts, the gift of self, without which nothing new is created in scientific thought, he would not know how to evaluate the strength of the feeling that alone can give birth to such a work, far as it is from the immediate practical life.\"\n\nThis resonates with Proust: \"There is no reason for us to believe ourselves obliged to do good, for the atheist artist to believe himself obliged to start over twenty times a piece whose admiration it will excite will matter little to his body eaten by worms. All these obligations which do not have their sanction in the present life seem to belong to a different world founded on goodness, scruples, sacrifice, a world from which we leave to be born to this earth, before perhaps returning to live under the sway of these unknown laws which we have obeyed because we carried the teaching of them within us without knowing who had traced them.\" And the writer adds in a letter, \"\\[...\\] To awaken in us that mysterious depth of our soul \\[...\\] and that we can call for that religious.\"\n\nREAD ALSO Bioethics: it is time to assume the demiurgic capacities of science",

        "text": "So, to preface, I’m a struggling Christian who’s been teetering between keeping the faith to agnosticism, so I won’t lie that this is inherently me trying to gauge my beliefs a bit. \n\nStill, that said, I’ve been trying observing my former beliefs (Baptist Christian initially) and others and one of the things I’ve been struggling with is the inherent misogyny that is rampant in a lot of the religions and have been wondering which and how many religions (or sub-sects of religions) actually have men and women _truly_ equal or at least demonstrates equity. With the exception of certain sub-sects of Christianity like the Episcopalian or United Methodist church for example; or religions like Baha’i or Sikhism, the vast majority do not. \n\nAnd to explain myself further, what I mean by objectively equal, what I mean is they meet all three criteria:\n\n1) Men and women hold equal worth and value (many religions/sub-sects of religions AT LEAST profess this, but many like Confucianism or Buddhism which talks of women being temptresses, do not). \n\n2) Women are able to hold equal offices or positions as men and vice versa, if not similar office of equal standing and influence. (This is where I’ve noticed very few religions I’ve noticed actually have this level of equality between the sexes since the only religion off the top of my head that allow for that level of equality are the ones I mentioned above besides a few others like Quakers, certain Pagan sects and Unitarianism) \n\n3) Men and women are given/allowed equal opportunities to lead and govern in a familial or clan/government/official setting (this is fairly divisive as I’ve noticed as in many religions, a patriarchal model is pushed but in tribal ones, a matriarchal model is in place. Both wouldn’t count as equal as one sex has further influence of the other).",

My mom have a  painting of Jesus in the living room. An altar in the kitchen with catholic rosary beads and a crucifix. But it doesn't bother me because she doesn't push her religion towards anybody. But seeing a crucifix in a hospital doesn't seems okay. \n\n\nI never seen in a hospital symbols of other religions. Only christian symbols. I mean for me it is okay to people have crucifixes in their own house. But in a hospital doesn't seem okay.  I live in very christian country. I live in Puerto Rico. We celebrate thanksgiving and before eating, someone has to pray first then eat.  \n\n\n\nEven if I didn't felt comfortable praying. I remember school I had christian teachers. In graduations they always thanked the christian god for this \"glorious day\".   When politicians are elected they have to take their oath by putting their hand on the bible and swear to the christian god to do their duty. I noticed that in my country christianity is very immersed in our society in general. I don't like it. Now that is December, is when Christianity is more inmmersed. In my job they have small nativity scene near the door entrance.  I know that in my country exists pagan communities of alternative spiritual paths. I know that exists afro caribbean religions like santeria, voodoo, indigenous spirituality, wicca,  satanism, etc. But christianity have many followers and a lot of influence in my country.  Specifically in abortion rights. In Puerto Rico abortion is legal. But since Roe vs wade I am worried about women reproductive rights.",

I think a critical enabler to non-toxic conversation between people who disagree about issues important to them is that they have relationships *outside* of the area of their disagreement. This will allow each to recognize that the other is actually not necessarily stupid, ignorant or evil, because they've seen the other person be perfectly fine and sensible person in a bunch of other areas. They also have a motivation to maintain harmony.  \n\nCompare this to an online discussion between two faceless, voiceless, and often. nameless strangers. They know nothing about other than that the other is on the evil/ignorant/stupid side of an important issue. Toxicity will be the rule, not the exception.  \n\nIn this video, I a pro-choicer, new Christian, former hardcore atheist, but still a staunch secularist discuss abortion with a friend of mine from my church.

Sorry if my question doesn't fit in here, I didn't know where to post it, and since demonology is commonly associated with some religions, I thought it would be okay to ask some questions about it.\n\nMy questions, put blantly, since I don't know anything about demonology:\n\n-Why would demons take an interest in us, human beings ? What do they want from us, and why ? \n\n-If other species on other planets exist, would these demons take an interest in them ?\n\n-Why demons, who are very powerful beings capable of performing some \"extraordinary acts\" in our world, are incapable of acting or communicate as they like if we don't do rituals ? How does a ritual work exactly, why does it create a bridge between our realms and why does it give demons power ?\n\n-Same question about pacts. Why do demons do pacts ? Are they obliged to respect it ? Why ? \n\n-What power does it have to say a particular word during a ritual, since words are basically sound waves, i.e deformations of the air ? Same question concerning other rituals requiring some specific objects.\n\nThank you in advance.",

        "text": "From listening to Pageau and others, here is how I sum up our world:\n\nThere is a mountain of truth. One ultimate, all compassing truth is at the top of that mountain. Each religion or ideology is a path towards the top. \n\nFor Christians, Jesus is at the top. For Muslims, Allah is at the top. For communists, the communist utopia is at the top. For atheists, science is at the top. For \"spiritual and not religious\" folks, their personal idea of what the truth or God is is at the top. For those who chase money, \"more money\" is at the top. \n\nThe one ultimate truth at the top can be viewed differently. Not necessarily only one religion or view is right, there are different ways to climb the mountain. But some paths, like destructive ideologies, are dead ends and lead those taking them to fall off the mountain. \n\nThis is our life, it's a path to the top of the mountain of meaning and truth, and our conception of what's at the top informs which path we choose to take. \n\nAnd we HAVE to climb the mountain, we can't ever stop, that's what life is all about. Without the path of religion, we may take the path of destructive ideology, and we keep going until we fall off.",
