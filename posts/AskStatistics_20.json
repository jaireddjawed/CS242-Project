Each element in the array is the flux or brightness of a given pixel.\n\nAs a second step, portions of the image are masked (pixel value removed) and then I have used a variety of interpolation methods to model potential values over those masked regions. This results in a second 2D array with the same dimensions as the original image. This is the 'model' and represents the background signal behind the masked features. \n\nI would like a way to quantitatively compare the performance of the various models, to make sure for example that I am not over-fitting. Asking around I'm told that a chi square method would make sense but I can't see to wrap my head around if that is really a valid approach and if so how that would be done.\n\nSo the questions are twofold. 1) Can a chi square approach be applied here, and 2) if so, how?\n\nWould the \"observed\" be the flux at a given pixel in the original image and the \"expected\" be the modeled flux? I then use the Chi Square formula summing up the result at each pixel? Null hyphothesis is that \"Model A\" is no different than ground truth and the model with the highest chi square value is the best? Like I said, I'm led to believe by folks smarter than I am that this is the way to go, but I can't seem to wrap my head around it. Appreciate any input as to what I'm not seeing",

So in the first example since the frequency of flipping HT is a 1 at any sample size, it's very likely that that coin is unfair. Increasing the 2-flips to an arbitrary n-flips seems like it would take alot of resources especially if we consider all of them simultaneously.\n\nIs there a name for this method or is it just something thats common sense to do in these sorts of problems? Also, are there any well known methods to find unfair coins like this, with or without considering infinite time and resources? If so, I would appreciate any information about them!",

        "text": "Hi everyone, \n\nI work at a cancer registry and am currently stuck with the following problem: I analyze the data quality of reporting institutions and individual doctors reporting from within those institutions. I have a binary indicator for a certain aspect of data quality, and each individual scores a relative proportion on that (for example: 60% fully complete reports). In one institution we have several individuals with differing amounts of reports. An example table could look something like this:\n\n|ID|Amount of reports|Proportion of complete reports|Average of Institution|Total number of reports in institution|Difference in proportions|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|2000|0,6|0,6|9000|0|\n|2|3000|0,7|0,6|9000|0,1|\n|3|2500|0,5|0,6|9000|0,1|\n|4|1000|0,2|0,6|9000|0,4|\n|5|1500|0,55|0,6|9000|0,05|\n\nI now want to know, whether all in all the relative proportions of individuals differ significantly from the average of the respective institution. None of the usual tests seem to fit. Do you have any idea how to go about something like this? Anything is highly appreciated!\n\nPlease forgive a possibly unspecifc question title, I did not really now how to put it any better ;)\n\nThank you so much for your time!\n\nMaximilian",

        "text": "Like, isn't the idea of higher bias what happens when we consider less information about the training set?  For example, all else equal, a linear regression model will be more biased than a quadratic regression, because the latter considers more information, in the sense that it , right?  It's a more complicated model and, if I understand correctly, more complicated models tend to be less biased but have higher variance.  I tend to think about it like this: overfitting/using a model with high variance is like missing the forest for the trees, while underfitting/using a highly biased model is like zooming out so far you can't even tell the forest is made of trees anymore.\n\nSo, if I choose a larger k value, say, k=10, that's using more information classify each value, than if I used, say, k=5.  So why should k=10 give me a larger bias instead of a smaller one?  \n\nI feel like it's maybe related to the idea of sample size, in that the k nearest neighbors to some point are sort of like a sample of convenience and larger sample tend to give more accurate results.  But that's really only true with random/pseudorandom samples and only when we're sampling from a population, so I'm not sure I'm even on the right track thinking in those terms.",

        "text": "I just want to make sure I'm correctly understanding the idea of bias-variance trade-off and how it relates to over/underfitting:\n\nIf I understand correctly, the idea of bias-variance trade-off is that if a model has too many parameters (e.g. a high k value in k nearest neighbors, a lot of coefficients in a polynomial regression, etc) then it will likely perform well on the training data (i.e., have a low in-sample error rate) but perform poorly on the test data.  That would correspond to having a high variance and would be an example of overfitting, yes?  Or, in simpler terms, overfitting is essentially \"missing the forest for the trees\", considering too many details of the data that happens to be in the training set, and missing the big picture relationships.  That results in a model that may give wildly different and completely inaccurate results for out-of-sample data because the model is picking up on patterns that are specific to the training set and don't exist in the relevant population.  That is, an overfit model give results that greatly _vary_ between the train and test data and hence it corresponds to a high _variance_.  Is that right?\n\nIn contrast, if the model has too few parameters (e.g. a particularly low k value, or maybe using a linear regression when a quadratic regression is clearly more appropriate, etc), the overall error rate (in sample and out of sample error combined) will be higher, but the two error rates will be more similar.  Or,  to be more specific, if we consider, say, only 1 or 2 factors when the relevant relationship actually has, say, 4 important factors, our model is leaving out important information, and so the factors we _do_ consider seem more important than they are.  In other words, the results are _biased_ towards the parameters (or, maybe \"parameter\" is the wrong word, since bias-variance trade-off applies to non-parametric models as well as parametric ones, but then I'm not sure what the correct word is) we did include.  That results in a model that performs more _similarly_ on the train and test data, but that doesn't perform _well_ on either of them.  Correct?\n\nAnd the idea of the tradeoff is that we don't typically want a model that fits _either_ extreme, but rather, we ideally want to minimize both bias and variance, as much as is reasonably possible.  But the problem is that decreasing one tends to increase the other, so we have to balance them, trying find a model somewhere in the middle, that isn't overfit _or_ underfit.  Right?",

They want to know what 'n' is needed in order to have sufficient statistical power, where 'n' equals the number of total data points in the dataset.\n\nThe premise of the model looks like this:\n\n Response \\~ Beta0 + Beta1\\*Operator + Beta2\\*Location + Beta3\\*Method + Beta4\\*Instrument + error\n\n**Question 1**. In coding this simulation in R, the data sim for the variable is currently coded as follows:\n\n`X = rbinom(sample_size, 1, 0.5)`\n\n`) %&gt;%`\n\n`mutate(Y = effect*X + rnorm(sample_size, mean = 0, sd = 3))`\n\n`model &lt;- lm(Y ~ X, data = tib)`\n\nThe way I understand this is that this example is the instance where we simulate and model each of the 4 independent variables individually. The resulting output, therefore, is the total number of data points each variable needs to have associated with it. So if the calculated 'n' = 300, then each binary level of that variable needs to have 150 data points in the set. Is this correct?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Question 2**. I'm not sure I'm coding this correctly to account for the full model + interactions. As I said above, the project team is interested in all 4 variables and their interactions. So wouldn't the full model actually be - \n\nResponse \\~ Beta0 + Beta1\\*Operator + Beta2\\*Location + Beta3\\*Method + Beta4\\*Instrument + **all 2nd order interactions** \\+ error?\n\nAnd wouldn't the related code in R actually look as follows? - \n\n`X1 = rbinom(sample_size, 1, 0.5),`\n\n`X2 = rbinom(sample_size, 1, 0.5),`\n\n`X3 = rbinom(sample_size, 1, 0.5),`\n\n`X4 = rbinom(sample_size, 1, 0.5)`\n\n`) %&gt;%`\n\n`mutate(Y = effect*X1 + effect*X2 + effect*X3 + effect*X4 + rnorm(sample_size, mean = 0, sd = 3))`\n\n`model &lt;- lm(Y ~ X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 + X1*X2 + X1*X3 + X1*X4 + X2*X3 + X2*X4 + X3*X4, data = tib)`\n\nMy understanding here is that the above simulation accounts more accurately for the combined effect all variables, and their interactions, have on the continuous response. If this is true, how do I interpret the resulting 'n'? For example, if the ideal 'n' from this calculates to 800, do I divy this 800 evenly among the 4 variables and say each variable needs 200 data points, therefore each level of the binary variables need 100 data points? Or is there a different interpretation?",

Resulting in N observations (each sensor has n\\_k observations), each observation z is linked to the coordinates where it was collected.\n\nfirst, I use a gaussian process to model my data: I assume that the hidden process Y (which represents the dispersion of the pollutants) follows a gaussian process with an exponential function as covariance function, and that the observations of the sensors are just noisy independent observations, classical in geostatistics : \n\nZ/Y \\~ N( Y,  **σI** )\n\nY \\~ N( µ , R( 𝞡 ))\n\nWhere  µ  can be a constant or a regression with other covariate collected by the sensors ( ex : proximity to highway ) ,and R(𝞡) is an exponential function of the distance depending on several parameters 𝞡,  and **σ** represent the mesurment error. Resulting in the marginal model : \n\nZ \\~ N( µ , R( 𝞡 ) + **σI**)\n\nThis model work just fine, but does not take into account the fact that my data comes from unreliable ,different sensors. \n\nI want my model to be able to have several intercepts in Z for each sensor k, this is where i came across linear mixed models : \n\nZ\\_k/Y \\~ N( Y + a\\_k,  **σI** )\n\nY \\~ N( µ , R( 𝞡 ))\n\na\\_k \\~N( 0 ,  **γ**  ) \n\nI understand that the a\\_k must be centred at 0, or they will not be distinguished from  µ , and the model will be unidentifiable.\n\nIn the first model (geostatistics), the resulting covariance matrix  **Σ**  is equal to R(xi,xj) for any input not in the diagonal, and R(xi,xi) + σ in the diagonal. \n\nIntegrating out of the a\\_k in the second model results in a more complex covariance matrix  **Σ** , and we do not directly observe the a\\_k. \n\nHere  **Σ**  is equal to R(xi,xj) for every 2 observations not from the same sensor, R(xi,xj) + **γ** for every two observations from the same sensor and R(xi,xi) + **σ** \\+ **γ** on the diagonal. (is this correct ?) \n\nMy understading is that **γ** capture all the variation within the sensors.\n\nMy questions are :  1) Is my second model correct?\n\n2 ) We have seen that the **γ** present between 2 observations from the same sensor in the covariance matrix, can be interpreted as different intercepts in the model for each sensor k, centered on 0. What is the interpretation if, instead of putting the same parameter, I put **γ\\_k**  in the covariance matrix for each sensor k, thus adding (k-1) parameter (each sensor has its own variance).\n\n3) Same question if i simply put different  **σ\\_k** on the diagonal for each observation from sensor k.\n\n \n\nIf anyone has a lead or an idea, a paper or a book chapter that could help me, I would be very grateful.\n\nThank you.",

        "text": "And by how, I mean a quick, elegant, flexible way to do this -- eg is there a distribution that has this property that's well understood? \n\nBasically, suppose I have an even numbered list of length *n*. Maybe *n* = 6, and my list is the set {a, b, c, d, e, f}.\n\nI can generate `n! / 2^(n/2) / (n/2)!` unique sets of pairs in this list, eg of the form {ab, cd, ef}, or {ac, df, be}.\n\nIf I wanted to sample uniformly from these 6! / 2^3 / 3! = 15 possible sets of pairings, I could do so in many easy ways, eg randomly permute the order of the list and take successive sets of 2.\n\nBut suppose I want the probability of some pair appearing in my sample of pairs to be proportional to some value. For example, say I'm hosting a social event and have a 1-on-1 icebreaker activity planned, and separately know where all my attendees fall on some similarity or distance metric, say the extent to which they prefer Star Trek to Star Wars on a continuous scale in (0,1). I want conversation to flow, so I want to maximize some aggregated \"mainstream sci-fi conversational compatibility\" score of pairs of participants -- maybe I want to minimize the average distance between members of a pair on their (0,1) value across all pairs (eg, seat 0.1 w/ 0.1, 0.9 w/ 0.9, and 0.5 w/ 0.5). But I also believe in destiny, so I want to sample pairs from a distribution centered on this value, rather than finding some strict optimum. How do I do that?\n\n(actually, I think the optimum would just be sorting the pairs and then taking successive sets of 2 -- any possible \"trade\" would reduce average compatibility. This would also generalize to triplets, quadruplets, etc.)\n\nI can imagine lots of iterative algorithms that would let me do this, e.g. pick two from a discrete uniform, check their distance, sample a bernoulli random variable with probability f(distance), if it's a 1 remove them from the population, if it's a 0 return them to the population and try again, repeat until only 2 people are left. But this potentially leaves me w/ very incompatible individuals in my final pool, which I do not want.\n\nI can also exhaustively list out all 15 sets of pairs, compute their average compatibility within pairs for each set, and sample a set from a multinomial with probability some function of that vector of average compatibilities. But if n = 100, that gives me around  2.7 \\* 10^(78), which would present considerable computational challenge.\n\nI could also write a markov chain to swap members of a pair of pairs with probability proportional to the difference in average distances of the swap, maybe initializing from the optimum and then bouncing around it.\n\nWhat else can I do? Ideally in a way that results in nice, tidy properties, e.g. to be able to make statements of the form \"x units greater distance between elements corresponds to y units lower log-odds of their ending up in the sample set of pairs\".\n\nAlso, if possible, how could I extend this to larger groupings than pairs, like triplets or quadruplets? What if, in that case, I wanted to satisfy some other objective, like the variance between members of a group -- maybe it's a mentoring event with ugrads, grad students, postdocs, and faculty, and I want to seat tables of 6 who are on average the most dissimilar -- not as much opportunity for mentoring if it's all people at the same career stage. IDK what the optimum there is, but it would be easy enough to find numerically -- but is there something else I could do?)\n\nUltimately seems like a pretty straightforward problem, but googling has failed to turn up any canonical solutions!",
