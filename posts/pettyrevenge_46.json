Everyone in the office has their own magnet, and we use them to signify whether we are in or out of office, and if we are out, when we will next be in. \n\nThere are two doors in my office, the one directly next to me, in the view of my boss's office, and another on the other end of the hall that neither of us can see. My coworkers do not like the white board system, and will sometimes sneak out the backdoor to avoid being seen leaving/having to say when they will be back. So the board will say they are in when they are, in fact, out. \n\nMy boss, of course, knows about this. He makes jokes about it to me all the time. He is usually the last one out at the end of the day. On his way out the door, he'll go up to the white board, and turn the magnet of everyone who is still \"in\" upside down. I think it's his subtle way of saying \"I know when you're only pretending to me here, dumbasses.\" \n\nIt's petty, but ever since he started doing it, people sign themselves out twice as often. ",

        "text": "I'll try and keep it short. This story goes back about 8 months. I was rooming with 3 other people in a house at the time. My laptop goes missing. I'm fucking furious because I had bought it new a few weeks before then for $2500 and it had very important projects on it that I hadn't backed up (my mistake). I knew 2 of the guys pretty well and after talking to each one individually it became pretty obvious which one took it and why.\n\nWe'll call him Tom. Tom loved weed. I mean he loved the stuff, there was never a moment he wasn't high. He spent his paycheck on a \"rare strain\" or something and barely had any left at the time. It was a safe assumption he was the one who did it, considering the other 2 had *plenty* saved in their savings. \n\nI confronted him and he denied it, also tried to convince me that I didn't need it and I should've been happy with my desktop. That's what pushed me over the edge, at the time. A month or so later he somehow lost a grand of cash. It was clear he instantly thought I stole it (even though he locks his door and I don't have the key). \n\nA few hours later the police arrive, and they ask our names. They treated it like a break in robbery pretty much. They talked to us, but seemed to be extra talkitive with me. Whatever, they concluded there was no evidence of break in and they leave. That was the last we heard of them about that. I then find out the next day from one of my roommates that Tom told the police on the phone that he thinks I'm the suspect. I REALLY had it then. \n\nAlong with weed, Tom also occasionally did pills, I thought things like Xanax but I didn't really know what exactly. So a few months later I call the police at a payphone to give them an annonymus hint of a drug dealer's location. The police appearantly came on by, did a search of the house, found Tom in possession of weed without a license, and opioids. \n\nHe eventually got a family member to bail him out, and he tried coming back to our place but we gave his family his belongings. \n\nYes I know it's super super petty, but he was so much of a prick even at other times. \n\n**TLDR: roommate stole my laptop. He later lost $1k. Told police I stole it. I reported him for having drugs.**",

        "text": "Little backstory: I’m a pizza delivery driver and most of our business comes from a large college campus nearby, meaning lots of drunk/stoned/annoying/stupid college kids ordering. We deal with a lot of bullshit from them and we rarely get tipped there.  \n\n \n\nSo this is what happened: I’m doing my normal deliveries to campus, which involve calling each customer to come outside the dorm to meet me (the doors are locked and only students have access). The next day, I get a text from my boss asking if I remember delivering to a particular college student, and she gave me his name and a phone number to look up in my call log to see if I delivered to them. Sure enough, I had called that number the previous night and I actually remember that specific customer because his name was on the delivery. Let’s call him Chad. My boss told me that Chad called the shop and complained that he never received his order the previous night, so she looked up the order details and saw that I had taken it (there’s a record of every order showing which driver took the order, customer information etc). This infuriated me because I know for a fact I had delivered to Chad. I even remember what he looked like and what he was wearing. He filed a corporate complaint saying that he never received his order and he wanted a refund. His argument was that I gave his food to a random person and they signed his credit card receipt, stealing his food. This doesn’t add up because if I had given it to the wrong person, wouldn’t he have called me back asking where I was? If I had food delivered and the driver said they were outside and weren’t there, I would’ve called back immediately wondering where my food was. Chad waited until the NEXT day to call and complain. Oh hell no, there was no way this idiot was getting his money back for food HE ALREADY ATE! I called his phone number and said “hi this is your dominos driver, the one who delivered to you last night! Im not sure why you’re trying to say you never got your food when I clearly remember handing it to you, therefore you won’t be getting a refund” He hung up. A couple weeks go by and I guess Chad got over it because a college campus order came through with his name on it. This was my chance to confront him face to face. I got to campus and tried calling him, but it wouldn’t go though. He BLOCKED my number! I asked someone if I could borrow their phone. When he answers I say  “hi this is your dominos driver, remember me? I’m gonna need you to come down with your credit card and ID so I can make sure I’m giving this order to the right person!” He hangs up without saying anything. A minute goes by and a girl comes down saying she’s picking up the order for him. I say, “sorry but I’m gonna need him to come down since last time he tried to say I gave his food to the wrong person!” He comes out and it’s clearly the same dude from before and he obviously recognizes me. He snatches the food out of my hands and runs away, without signing the credit card receipt. Now technically, if you don’t sign the receipt, we can’t process the payment so you’re stealing the food (confirmed by my manager). So I call up campus police and they said if he doesn’t sign the receipt he’ll get arrested for larceny. The cops show up, go up to his dorm and bring him downstairs. The look on his face was priceless! He signed the receipt ( no tip of course).  After all this you’d think he wouldn’t order pizza from us ever again, but nope! He kept trying to order from us and we would have to cancel them immediately. So now, he’s blacklisted from our shop.\n\nHA! Don’t mess with this delivery girl. \n\nEDIT: people are questioning me because technically there’s no legality in not signing the credit card receipt. However, Chad was already in a bad place with us so my manager NEEDED that signature, hence why she urged me to get campus police involved. They weren’t going to arrest him, just put him in his place. ",

So I went to the gift shop next door and bought the same thing I was looking at.\n\nThis just happened. \n\nSo here I am on vacation in San Antonio, Texas.  My girlfriend is in conference talks all day, so I'm walking around looking for gifts for my family. \n\n I walk into one gift shop and start looking around.  The shopkeeper keeps tailing me and asking if I'm finding everything ok. Regular stuff.  I tell him I'm just looking around.  I go to the back and look at t shirts.  He's following me.  I put the t shirt I was looking at back and walk up to the front to look at magnets. He's following me. He asks again if I'm finding anything (really annoying at this point) so I say I'm just looking around. And he tells me \"ok buddy let's go.\" And rushes me out the front door.  I'm pretty non confrontational and it is his store so I comply, leave the store and walk into the store beside his.  It's all the same gift stuff in store 2, and prices are comparable. \n\nSo im browsing in the second store and shopkeeper 1 comes in and says \"keep an eye on him I just caught him trying to steal from my store!\" Then sort of walked out and stood around outside, still watching me. I couldn't believe it. So I told the shopkeeper of the 2nd store that I wasn't trying to steal anything and that that guy is crazy.  \n\nSo now I'm offended that this guy thought I was a theif.  I'm browsing the t shirts and find the same one he had at his store.  I wasn't going to buy it but I decided I would buy it here just to show him, as he is still watching me from outside.  I buy the shirt and walk out and while I'm waiting for the light to change I give him a big smile and wave.",

My friend and his classmates came to Germany for some training in Munich, so they arrived a week earlier for a short trip around the area.    \n\n\nThis happened on the last day of the trip. We took a train from Innsbruck heading to Munich. As a very careful traveller, the whole group bought the tickets with reservation (I wanna use my discount, so I bought the ticket seperately without reservation). Well, it's not unusual that when you get on the train with a reservation, there might be someone sitting on your seat. So, one of us asked them nicely in English to give us our seats, because we paid for them. Everyone were happily complying and changed the seats, well, except for this couple. In front of us, they were nice and everything, but when they seated on their new seats, they started talking. Well, I wouldn't know this if I didn't sit next to them (because I didn't have any reservation, I needed to sit seperately from my friends and I ended up next to them).   \n\n\nI am a Thai student and have been studying in Germany for 4 years, so I understand German pretty well. I wouldn't pay any attention until I notice that the man was talking trash about us in German, something like \"Look at the luggages, the Chinese are going home.\" or \"It's true that they all look the same\", and some other racist things. I kept my eyes on my Kindle and try not to cause anything.  \n\n\nA while after that (they still talking trash about us non-stop), a conductor came to check the ticket. I made a small talk with him in German, and I made sure that they would hear me too. The looks on their faces were priceless. After the conductor left for other passengers, they had stoped talking and stayed silence for the rest of the ride. They would literally hide immediately after I looked up at them from my Kindle.  \n\n\nTL;DR a couple of racists talked trash about my friends and I without knowing that I understood what they were speaking.  \n",

        "text": "On mobile, so please excuse any typos.\n\nI'll begin this story with some context. A short while ago, I was attending a weeklong camp in Mexico. It was similar to a cultural exchange in that people from the US (like me) would attend alongside people from Mexico. We would all be separated and mixed into groups of about 8 people who didn't know eachother and throughout the week you would get to know them and hopefully make new friends.\n\nThe American delegation to this event was small, only about 20 people went, compared to almost 150 from Mexico. As such, there were only enough Americans to have about one per group. I am lucky enough to be fluent in both English and Spanish, so I volunteered to translate between the Americans (none of them spoke spanish) and the Mexicans (almost none of them spoke English, those who did were far from fluent).\n\nOn to the revenge.\n\nEarly on in this camp, I had cemented myself as the go to translator. I was the first choice of both Americans and Mexicans to translate for them.\n\nOne of these americans was Steve (Name changed for privacy). Steve was, special. He was 14, looked 11, and acted 6. He was the kind of child who would get angry if things aren't exactly how he liked them. \n\nThis camp had several fun activities to do, and we had a schedule of when to do what activities. These included repelling, archery, mountain biking, etc. We were all supposed to perform these activities with our groups, but Steve was having none of it. \n\nThe first day, he opted out of every single activity, then complained that camp was boring when it started to rain, then tried to drag me into agreeing with him.\n\nHe would also treat our camp leaders with the utmost contempt and disrespect, even when they had no control over the situation, and get mad at me when I would refuse to translate his angry rants.\n\nSo I began to secretly exact my revenge.\n\nAnytime I saw or heard him wanting to ask a question to anyone, I turned and ran the other way so he would be left without a translator.\n\nOh, we're finally doing that one event you wanted to do? Let me \"forget\" to tell you for a while until you are in the very back of the line (all our instructions were given in spanish)\n\nOh, you want to ask if you can leave this activity for no reason other than you don't like it? Nope not translating that.\n\nBy the end of the week, he also had gotten on the nerves of our campsite director (who only spoke spanish), so I had to translate the campsite director's soul crushing speech into english in front of him and his mom.\n\nHis week didn't go so well. Mine was great.",

        "text": "I just had to deal with a longish drive (30+ mins) with my siblings. They're twins, one boy one girl, and super annoying. My sister was screetching her head off the entire drive, but that's not even the worst part. What my brother was up to was the worst.\n\nSee, he spent almost the entire drive with his shoes AND SOCKS off. I couldn't pinpoint the smell at first, but when I discovered what the source of the putrid stench was, I asked my brother to put his footwear back on. \n\nNope. \n\nApparently, me not knowing where the smell was coming from, meant that I was pretending to be bothered by it. So my brother didn't put his shoes back on, he just tried to come up with creative ways to hide the fact that his shoes were off. He didn't seem to make the connection that, the fact that I was still bothered when he hid it, might mean that I really AM bothered by it. No, that would be too simple.\n\nBy the time we got home, I was just about ready to vomit from the stench, so I hatched up a plan for revenge.\n\nWhen I entered the house, I immediately got a bag and filled it with the stinkiest shoes in the house. These are shoes that are covered in years of grime and sweat (my brother is not good at consistently wearing socks, so it gets sweaty). I had to hold my nose near it.\n\nSo, I proceeded to march this bag over to his room and dump all the shoes in a heap at the center of his bed. \n\nFor good measure, I wrote a note and placed it neatly on my sister's bed: \"You're next...\" (I had no intention to act on this threat, but she deserved a little freak-out)\n\nWhen they found out, the look on their faces was priceless. My brother threw the shoes at my sister, and he swore to take revenge.\n\nBut I don't care, because I got my revenge, AND I get 3 fake internet points because of it!\n\nTl;dr: My brother took his shoes off when we were confined in a car, so I dumped a bag of dirty shoes on his bed.",

        "text": "On mobile, sorry if formatting is whack. \n\nSo I worked at a self serve Fro-yo store for a few years (We’ll call it Blue Pineapple) and for about 3 months there was this college-age guy that came in once a week with a new girl. He wasn’t the worst customer by any means but there were a few things that made me hate seeing him come in. \n\n1. He would always ask for a sample of every single flavor, every single week. We had to get the samples for customers despite the self serve nature of this particular Blue Pineapple, so it created a extra long wait for anyone behind them in line. \n\n2. He constantly left a huge mess on the floor and tables and treated all the staff poorly \n\n3. Finally he was very loud and obnoxious and made most of his dates obviously uncomfortable with some of the things he talked about.\n\nI always tolerated this guy’s shenanigans, just because I dealt with crappy customers so often, but one night he and his date banged it out in our bathroom. They left quite the mess on our bathroom walls and floor so my co-workers and I had to clean it up. After that, I knew I needed to get back at him. \n\nThis fella had one fatal flaw that I eventually realized I could use against him. He would always come in and tell his dates that he had never been to Blue Pineapple before. (This is when he would ask to sample all 8 flavors) He would do this even though I was always there, every single week watching this go down. \n\nThe next week, like clockwork, he came in with a girl that seemed a bit more interested in him than some of the others. It sounded like they had just come from a fun night of mini-golfing and they were having a blast. He said his signature line about how he had never been to Blue Pineapple before and promptly asked to sample everything. I usually try to keep my customer interaction to a minimum, just to speed things along but I saw the perfect opportunity. \n\nAs soon as he said his line and asked for samples, I swooped in from the register and traded spots with the sample-giver. I then casually said, “Oh! Hey man what’s up?!Back again for another night out? How was your yogurt last week, did you like the pomegranate flavor?” \n\nThis obviously ticked the guy off because he got really nervous, really fast. The girl he came in with made the connection and then she flipped out at him. Apparently these two had been “exclusive” for a few months. Turns out he was a bigger douche than I originally expected, but needless to say he never came back to my store :) I have no idea how many people he was “exclusive” with at the time but every week he was with a different girl.

When I walk up with my guests, they are put onto the next ride to go.\n\nMost guests don't really care. However this one guy seemed to take immeasurable offense to the fact that my guests were getting to go to the front. I was standing with one of the sons and the mom while the dad took the two older kids on the ride when the Grumpy Guest (GG) started asking me why they get to cut in line while he was waiting for 90 minutes. \n\nI calmly explained to him that my guests were VIPs and since they paid for a guided tour, that it includes skipping lines, and that if he was interested in the same package, he could go back to the front of the park and upgrade to the VIP experience.\n\nHe started cussing and yelling saying he doesn't have that kind of money ($600 per person) and that it's unethical to let that happen. I tried to diffuse the situation, but he started insulting the VIP mom that I was with, saying she doesn't deserve it just because she sucks the dads dick. I didn't want to make my VIPs endure that, so I escorted my family away from GG. \n\nWhen my VIP dad and his kids came off the ride he told me that GG was saying he was a piece of shit and was being rude to his children too. So I went back up to the ride operator and when it was GG's turn, he was asked to go through the exit without taking getting to ride. \n\nGG was fuming and was getting in our faces saying how he doesn't care, it's his turn to ride and we weren't gonna stop him. Another staff had called the park security and they shortly arrived and escorted him away from the coaster.\n\nAfter the tour was over and the park closed down, I stopped by the security office to ask the ranger what happened after he left. The ranger told me that they explained to GG's family what had happened and that the mom and son were allowed to stay at the park, but that GG was escorted out and was not allowed to return.\n\nOverall, pretty fun turn of events: if you act like a dick, you're gonna have a bad time.",

        "text": "Warning: this is LONG, and I wish the revenge were bigger, but it sure felt good. \n\nI am a graduate student in the US. In my department, every grad student – master’s, PhD, doesn’t matter – has to take a two-semester one-credit seminar class that meets once a week for 2 hours. Students in my department work on some extremely varied topics, so the goal of the class is to teach students how to present their research to an interdisciplinary audience. (Without getting too specific, it’s an engineering field similar to biological engineering.) Your grade for the class is based on the other students’ evaluation of your presentation based on a rubric drawn up by the prof. This includes things like communication with the audience, appropriate title for presentation, clearly explained methods, etc. The rest of the students in the class were fine, reasonable people doing good science.\n\nNow on to the prof. I’ll call him AHP for Ass-Hat Professor. This guy is the epitome of entitled old white guy in an increasingly diverse field. AHP is crazy condescending, especially to the students from other countries. He’ll ask them a question after their presentation, wait a second for them to say “Um,” and then say “It’s okay if you can’t answer.” Oh and on the first day of class he asked everyone what the country of origin of their name is. It was really awkward. \n\nBecause we get graded by the other students, AHP really has no say in our grades, and repeatedly said so during the semester. However, four times throughout the first semester, we also had ethics discussions where we had to write a 2-page essay on specific topics in academic integrity (plagiarism, for example) and then participate in a class discussion. They weren’t so much discussions as “guess the answer AHP wants you to give.” The discussion was somehow part of our grade, but it was never specified what percent. \n\nDuring one such class, AHP opened the floor to our questions. I brought up the fact that the university has an easy-to-find online form for reporting students who are violating the university’s academic integrity policy, but there’s no such form for students to report professors. Here’s how that conversation went, as best I can remember:\n\nAHP: Why would you want to do that?\n\nMe: Well sometimes professors aren’t following the academic integrity standards set by the university. Students can fail courses and even get expelled, but there’s no way to report a prof for the same thing.\n\nAHP: In that case, you should just talk to the professor.\n\nMe: That’s not always an option! If someone is breaking the academic integrity standards, and you bring it to their attention, they might try to convince you to drop it. \n\nAHP: (interrupting) That doesn’t happen. That simply doesn’t happen.\n\nMe: (trying to press on) And if I were to go to someone higher up in the department, there’s no guarantee that anything would change. *I* could even get penalized professionally if the professor tries to retaliate against me. I’d basically be a whistleblower, and everyone would know it was me.\n\nAHP: That’s not true. There are very strict laws against retaliation against whistleblowers in this country.\n\nMe: Yeah well there are laws against speeding and jaywalking but those still happen. There are a lot of documented cases of professors retaliating against students who spoke up for one reason or another, whether it was academic integrity issues or sexual harassment. \n\nAHP: (interrupting) What happened to you to make you this way?\n\nAt this point, I got that “blood rushing in my ears” sound and I was just speechless for a minute. I was so mad, and I felt like he was trying to gaslight me. Also, how dare he ask about something like that? Well, I did have a story.\n\nMe: Something like this happened when I was doing my undergrad. I won’t go into details because it’s too hard for me to talk about it, but now this professor that I had a problem with is blocking me from publishing in a major journal in my field. \n\nAHP: That’s not true. There’s no way anything like that has ever happened. \n\nWhen he said that, my throat dried up and I was at a loss for words. How could I possibly go on defending myself against someone who was determined to discredit me and call me a liar? AHP spent the remaining fifteen minutes of class explaining that there was no possible reason that my experience was real, and that no professor would ever retaliate against a student because there are laws against it. I went home and cried, I was so angry and upset.\n\nAfter that, I wasn’t taking any more of AHP’s shit. I started taking notes of every time he said inappropriate things or tried to further discredit me to the class (this was only about week 6 of a 15-week class, so there was plenty of time for that). A week later, the Las Vegas shooting occurred. We had class the following day. During that class, AHP was talking about how important it was to take criticisms on one’s presentation from the audience, and how he once got such blistering criticism from someone at a conference that he “felt like bringing in a gun and shooting up the place.”\n\nAt that moment I knew I couldn’t just take notes anymore. This is a person potentially threatening gun violence *one day* after the Las Vegas shooting. One. Day. I don’t care where you fall on the political spectrum, or what your thoughts are on guns, but it is not ever appropriate make jokes about gun violence. I felt like getting up and walking out of class right then, but I was afraid of AHP. As soon as class ended, I went straight to the department head (DH) and told him what AHP had said. DH was very concerned and told me that he took this very seriously, and would talk to AHP. \n\nThe thing is, AHP had made comments like that in the past. I found out that he’d been using gun violence as a joke in class for at least 2 years. Other students in the past had complained to the previous department head, who had retired the previous year, and apparently nothing had been done. Every time DH called AHP in to talk about his comments, AHP would wave them off and say they’d been misconstrued and that wasn’t what he said. \n\nOh, wanna bet?\n\nSee, for the second semester of the class, I was video-calling in. I installed a video and audio recorder on my laptop and recorded every second. I had proof. But, I also knew that DH couldn’t really do anything about AHP because he had tenure. So I went to the grad school office. I told them what had been going on, about how AHP was kind of racist and constantly tried to discredit me and now had been making gun violence out to be some kind of joke. (I also heard that he’d previously choked an undergrad in his lab for running a machine wrong, and that he had divorced his wife because he’d impregnated one of his grad students who was 40 years younger than him. We found proof of the wedding but not of the assault because it was covered by internal investigations in the university, so it wasn’t public record.) I gave all my evidence to the grad school.\n\nThe cherry on top was that after the first semester of the class, we weren’t offered evaluation sheets. I had *so* been looking forward to those. The way this class is structured, it could be taught by any professor, not necessarily even one in our department. But the thing is, AHP didn’t hand out the evals. I combed through the university’s policies and found out that every department is obligated to give students the opportunity to evaluate their classes or the department could get fined. I brought this up to the department’s administrative assistant, who sent me to a different assistant, who never got back to me, so I went to the DH. When I mentioned that we’d never received evals and that there could be repercussions for the department if I reported them, the DH agreed to look into it. \n\nDH later told me that AHP argued that his class was exempt. He was trying to manipulate a department rule that says that seminars don’t have to be evaluated. The thing is, that only applies to seminars where there is no professor and a different person comes in every week to present, usually people from the community or elsewhere in the university. DH, to his credit, didn’t buy AHP’s excuses. \n\nAt the end of the semester, all the grad students in the department got an email to come fill out evals for AHP retroactively. Nearly everyone needed extra paper to write their comments. And AHP couldn't do anything but stand there and watch. I volunteered to be the person to wait for everyone to finish their evals, so I could take the envelope down to the office. It was hella thick.\n\nAnd it was so, so sweet. ",

        "text": "I work as a bartender in a small cocktail bar for some time now, and I'm usually chill. But bullies can still push my buttons in a wrong way. Before starting, I may be in the wrong for doing this, but it is what it is. \n\nA week ago, a bunch of guys came for a few. They seemed like OK dudes, early 20-is, but the group dinamic was kinda off. Introducing the main antagonist. Obnoxious guy, too loud, snapping his fingers at me when ordering (don't snap fingers at bartenders kids, we're not dogs), punching his friends in the shoulders all the time,... A sportier, really aggressive version of a David Spade character he was. \n\nNext to David Spade, sat the victim of most of his \"playful\" teasings. Silently enduring his shit, I really felt sorry for this fellow. He wasn't a drinker, but he looked like he would rather be drinking distilled devils piss than continue sitting next to this macho maniac. He was really uncomfortable. David continued to bugg him to take a shot at least, \"come on, one with me, don't be a pussy, a bitch,...\" until, after whole night of persuasion, finally my dude waved the white flag. Ok, lets do one shot together, then leave me be. \n\n\"Two of your most fucked up shots,\" Spade shouted snapping his fucking fingers, while I imagined snapping his fucking neck. Oh, you'll get a fucked up shot, buddy. I made this two layered shots,  but while looking almost the same, they were different. David got stuff like Red Jacques Senaux Absinthe (75% alcohol), Stroh (80% alcohol), tabasco (110% flaming diarrhea), really nasty bussiness all together, and other guy got mostly syrups, juices, harmless stuff. They looked almost identical, Red Absinth can pass visually as a cranberry juice, Stroh as a syrup from brown sugar, Sambuca as anything colorless, etc...\n\nThey took their shots and all hell broke loose. Other guy chugged his shot like a champion, not even flinching (why would he, he drank juice). But David Spade... Boy, oh boy. He looked like he'd have a brain aneurism. Tears pouring from eyes, coughing like his lungs want to come out, he had a face and a posture of a man who just got waterboarded with some sort of chilly sauce. Other guy looked surprised until he caught a wink from me, but David Spade and the rest of the crew, now roaring with laughter about his misery, suspected nothing.\n\nThey got their shots on the house, poor dude was left alone, and David was a good boy for the rest of the night, deflatedly enduring small mockings from his fellows. Now, I may have used my powers in a wrong way, but this is the first and only time I messed with customers drinks. And I regret nothing. He was rude, aggressive even, to everyone around him. Fuck you, sporty David Spade. \n\nTL;DR In a bar where I work, punished a rude person by making him a hell shot. \n\nEDIT: Was not expecting response of this magnitude! Thank you, you wonderful peoples. Your comments made my day, can't stop smiling like an idiot. Love my job, but there is always 1 guy out of 1000 that'll try to mess everyones day... And thanks for the gold! Someone is getting free shots in your name tomorrow! But the good kind. Thank you, kind sir. \n\nEDIT 2: Holy Stroh! Thanks for the second gold! Let me answer a few questions: \nNo, they didn't tip at all. I work in southern Europe, tipping among locals is not a typical thing. I earn my pay from tourists, mainly Americans and Scandinavians. \nMe being from Europe is the reason why I didn't hear about _cement mixers_ so far. And me being a faithful disciple of the craft is the reason why I tried my first cement mixer today. Boy, oh boy, did that come to bite me in the ass. TIFU\n\nHere's a recipe for a \"Fuck you, David Spade\": Equal parts of Sambuca Molinari, Red Absinthe Jacques Senaux (75%), freshly squeezed lime juice and Austrian liquer Stroh (80%). Add tabasco at will, you can mix it with lime juice. Use a bar spoon if you want to make a layered shot. Stroh is placed at the top, because it's the best burning alchohol - you can make a flaming shot out of it, a \"Burned David Spade\", if you like.\n\nDisclaimer: I have nothing against real David Spide, I like him actually. But his sporty doppelganger deserves a kick in the butt.",

        "text": "This happened a few years ago. My now ex-husband and I were married for 16 years. 16....horrible years. I won’t bother to explain why I stayed because too many people wouldn’t understand and would focus on that.  To give one example of abuse, we didn’t see each other for 6 months prior to getting married due to his job taking him overseas. I was depressed that he was gone and so I ate my feelings...and I had a lot of feelings. So hours after we’re married, he says to me, “If I had known that you had gotten this fat (size 16), I never would have married you. But, I needed someone I trust to watch my boys.”  Yeah...he was a gem. \n\nHe made good money and so when my teeth started to go bad, it runs in the family, he wouldn’t pay for me to get them fixed. He had no problems paying 3,000 for a custom pair of boots for himself though. Or 5,500 for a custom wool coat. As a result, I had to have a lot of my teeth pulled and ended up with dentures. At 36 I had dentures and he had no qualms about making fun of me. The mental abuse was only second to the physical abuse that I endured. \n\nI finally got the chance to get away from him. It took me 16 years, but I was finally able to do it in a safe manner. I waited until he was going to be at work for 16 hours and so I picked up the u-haul and packed up all my stuff. \n\nAs I was leaving, I noticed his boots next to the door and I decided then and there to get even. I went to the fridge and took shrimp from the freezer and put them in the toe of his boots and in the pockets of his wool coat. He didn’t find the source of the smell for months!!!",

Nice shiny Android phone, unlike the Apple 5S I'd been stuck with for years. My dad had control over the that phone since he bought it- he could turn it off, shut off the connection, use the \"find my iPhone\" thing to get my attention (despite me telling him it gives me anxiety attacks) if I didn't text him back fast enough, etc. Basically, he took full advantage of it to be an unholy terror towards me.\n\nWhen I showed the phone off to him next time he picked me up (I'm thankfully living in assisted living away from him, though I still relied on him for transportation) he obviously wasn't happy about the new phone, as he couldn't control me with it. But he couldn't say that outright, so instead he went on and on about how Apple is better, etc.\n\nMe: what about the headphone jack?\n\nHim, sputtering: I mean it's a small price to pay! Plus Bluetooth is far superior!\n\nYou can imagine how I rolled my eyes at that.\n\nWhen he dropped me off at home, I quickly grabbed the cord that let him connect his phone to audio cables- you know, that dinky little thing that's about two inches long that you keep losing. After thoroughly fraying the cable, I put it under the car seat next time he drove me, dropped my phone between the seats, and \"found\" both my phone and the completely unusable cable.\n\nHave fun replacing that thing, fucker.",

Leftover inventory at the end of the season is deeply discounted and usually consists of hard-to-find sizes and includes last year's colors.\n\nMy skinny bitch customer called yesterday asking about the dress. She was one of those rude people who calls from the car and leaves the phone on speaker in the passenger seat so you can barely hear them, and who has a million questions but interrupts you every time you open your mouth to answer.\n\nIn between interruptions I manage to let her know that this year's colors are earthy with some pastels thrown in. She spends a few minutes bitching about this year's colors and then asks about one of last year's leftover colors -- a jewel tone. I tell her that we do have her size (00) in that color. She asks, \"Well how many do you have?\" We're not supposed to tell people the exact number, but she kept hammering me with the question, and so I told her: One. We have one. (True.) And it's on sale for half price. She still hemmed and hawed. I start knitting as she mutters to herself and just let her trail off. Then she says, \"Well, I'll have to call you back. I'm in the car and I have a 20% off coupon at home.\" At which time I advise her that if she buys the dress now, she can still call us when she gets home and we can give her a credit for the 20% off retroactively. That way she can be sure not to miss out on this, the last dress in the color she wants. She said no, implied that I was trying to cheat her in some way, then hung up abruptly.\n\nGuys, I was honestly trying to save this bitch a buck, and she was so rude! \n\nSo the minute I got off work, I went online and bought that last jewel-toned dress in Size 00. \n\nI'm a Size 16 and don't even know anyone that skinny.

        "text": "This happened a few weeks ago, I'll try to keep it short. My partner and I just bought a house and were finally moving out of our shitty little apartment. The landlords lived upstairs and were nice people, but woefully underprepared for maintaining an apartment building alone (they are young guys, I think this is their first rental), so the building from the outside visibly needed a good amount of work. They also partied a lot, and left outdoor trash from these parties for multiple days to weeks at a time. For example, the fence fell down in a storm and was never fixed (just laid flat for months), the bushes shaggy, beer bottles and trash left on the porch and lawn, the paint was very poorly done and the colors didn't look great together (this is all important later). It was a cheap rental while we lived frugally to save for our home, we stayed there about 2 years and just dealt with the outward appearance/landlords so long as they didn't affect our personal things and rent stayed low. \n\nOur apartment inside was generally well maintained, we aren't messy or destructive people and take pride in caring for our home. However, we have a pretty naughty cat who would forcefully push his head through the window blinds if we didn't open them early enough in the day. This caused many of the front room blinds to break in multiple sections (little cheap plastic blinds like [this](https://lewisbaker.co.uk/shop/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/BlindsCurtainPolesItem-11.jpg) ). Originally, we planned to replace all of them when we moved out, but the landlords told us \"don't worry about it\" as they planned to renovate our apartment after we moved out and were replacing them anyway. Awesome! One less pricey thing to worry about as we're trying to purchase our first home and move out, we thought. So we left the broken blinds up as we packed and finalized our move (probably about a month and a half total after we asked). However, since we had planned to replace them, we bought one set of blinds to test our measurements before buying multiple, so we had one extra new set of blinds now in our possession we no longer needed.\n\nFinally moving week comes, and we start loading heavy boxes into our cars and a moving truck. Moving day happened to line up with the hottest day of the summer we've had so far, but the truck rental was already scheduled and we weren't moving the date last minute. Moving day is already no fun, add scorching heat and sun and patience was pretty thin all around. \n\nAt one point, I walked outside towards the moving truck with a particularly heavy box and see my neighbor coming outside across the street. This woman has said maybe 5 words to me in the 2 years we had lived there, but I was always pleasant and waved if I saw her on the street. Because she's approaching me kind of quickly (and doesn't normally talk to me) between the truck, I walk right towards her thinking she has something really important to tell me, like an emergency. I'll refer to her as Nosey Lady (NL). Keep in mind throughout this conversation, I'm still holding a particularly heavy box and had been moving stuff most of the day. \n\nNL: Excuse me, you're moving out right?\n\nMe: *politely smiles* Yes! We will be out by tonight. We just bought our first home. \n\nNL: *condescending tone* Are you going to replace your blinds? They're such an eye sore and they ruin our view when my husband and I sit on our porch.\n\nMe: ....\n\nMe: Yes, they're getting repla-\n\nNL: Good. *she cut me off mid sentence and walks away saying nothing else\n\nI just stared at her for I don't know how long right after she asked, I was legitimately speechless. While standing there speechless, I kind of obnoxiously shifted the heavy box to hint like, hey, is this really that  important right now? Of all the things to complain about, really?\n\nHer overall tone and rudeness when approaching me is probably why I kind of had some petty revenge. If she had asked nicely, maybe I could have told her about our cat, or our landlords, or just had, I don't know, a regular respectful conversation with another human. Her husband had also been notoriously narcissistic and condescending to me in the past, but I had always assumed she was much nicer based on our few previous interactions. \n\nInstead, after we moved everything out and cleaned the apartment, we decided to hang up that brand new set of blinds in the window that faced their porch. After hanging it up, I pulled the strings and made sure it was heinously crooked, partially open, etc. it just looked like utter chaos (but still totally functional should the landlords decide to keep it). It looked so much worse than the broken blinds. We slipped our keys through our landlords mail slot and just left.\n\nSo yes Nosey Lady, we did replace the blinds. Hope you like the view. :) \n\nBonus: I drove past the apartment earlier this week and the blinds still look like that a month after moving out. Apparently the landlords have been out of state and aren't renovating until late summer. Oops. :D",

It was enough with extra curriculars to end up at a good college where in my first major I dropped to mid Bs and high Cs until I changed majors. However, during that time my mother would always 'encourage' me to do better. Having just recently completed her college degree with a summa cum laude honors she would respond to hearing about my grades with \"Well Hbaromega, someone is making As, I just don't understand why it can't be you\". \n\nThis was a small part of the iceberg that was my parents pushing me to 'apply' myself beyond what I felt my limits were. Comments like these and the pressure put on me led to an inferiority complex and a sense of worthlessness that I managed to control after a couple years of therapy.\n\n Recently (~a decade after this last part), I've gotten a graduate degree and in a job I like, she's also gotten a graduate degree and is teaching AP classes in high school (which she likes too). We have a very good relationship and have talked a lot about growing up and the stresses I put on her and vice versa. Suffice to say, she denies ever having said to me '...someone is making As ....' . \n\nLast week we're talking on the phone and she's complaining that no matter how many times she takes the practice AP exam, she is always scoring a 4. She goes onto to say it's always the exact same type of questions, and she gets them wrong for the same reason. I see my chance, and just encouragingly say, \"You know Mom, someone is making 5's, I just don't understand why it can't be you\". After a brief grasp she jumps hard on the defensive denying she ever said anything like that to me and swears it was only my father who said it. I laughed the entire time enjoying her reaction. Overall I very much love my mother and am glad we're all happy, but that doesn't mean I don't get to upset her from time to time.",

We have a house that's a bit cramped for us and the kids, so I make do out there with some dingy couches and an old TV to play Madden.  I haven't played in about 8-9 months, and I fire it up.  Yay!  It works.  Seemingly.\n\nI'm not by any stretch of the imagination a techie.  So I can see my games, but it's not connecting to Xbox live.  OK, Big Guy, break out your man card and see if you figure this out.  It's seeing the wifi, but not connecting to the internet.  Hmmm.  Well, I guess I can grab the IP address off my desktop and plug that in manually, so I try that.  IPv6?  WTF is that?  Gateway?  Didn't they make computers with cows?  Are they still around?\n\nSo I stumble through it, still no luck.  Shit, time to break down and ask my wife.  Who does IT for a living.  \"Honey, I know you're busy, but tomorrow could you help me connect the Xbox?\"\n\nSo the next day rolls around and she brings her laptop into the garage to help me get the Xbox connected.  I fire up the machine, she fires up her laptop.  She pulls up the IP info on her laptop and compares it to what I manually input, and holy cow it matches.  Blind pig, acorn, all that jazz.\n\nHere's the petty revenge part.  She pulls up the controls for the router and wifi.  \"Oh, that's interesting - the Xbox is the only device in the house blocked from the router.\"\n\nMe:  \"What do you mean it's blocked?  Why would it do that?\"\n\nHer\"......\"\n\nMe:  \"Wait a minute.  The Xbox didn't do this, did it?\"\n\nHer:\"Well, now that you mention it, I do remember getting pissed at you for something.....\"\n\nSo, in a fit of rage that only 20 years of marriage can create, she got pissed at me and blocked the Xbox from the wifi.  However, since I stopped playing it for months, I didn't notice and she completely forgot all about it.  Or even what she was mad at me for.\n\nShe starts to giggle  \"Better not piss me off again\" was all she said as she left the garage.",

No problem, and for once I decided to go back a few weeks later. This time he also tells me to come back another time.

She was a millionaire and we lived on my paltry $50k/year as my husband’s entire paycheck went to her household (that changed once we got a better lawyer.) In one lawsuit she won against us, we literally had to sell our belongings (piano, race bikes) and take out $10k in a credit card to pay it off. (Again, things got better once we got a better lawyer.) The thing that burned her most though is that no matter what she did or how she tried to manipulate us, our happiness was a thorn in her side. \n\nFinally, the children  were grown and we no longer had to interact with her. Halle-fucking-lujah!\n\nUntil the wedding of my husband’s daughter....\n\nA quick note-Her personality encompasses manipulation, extreme narcissism and a borderline personality disorder. She was given to possessiveness and it was always HER money, HER kids (despite my husband being an excellent father). HER and HERS-it just never ended. \n\nSo the wedding day arrives - all the moms and grandma’s get corsages but not me. She informs me my presence will not be needed for pictures (although her new husband of one year will be in them,) and everyone relevant is seated in the front row except me who gets seated in the second row, coincidentally behind her new husband. \n\nI take it all in stride. I’m there for my stepdaughter’s day, and I am not going to be the one causing any scenes. I’m just trying to keep my husband from getting too upset by the bullshit. But I do have a plan forming in the back of my mind. \n\nThe wedding starts and the usher seats the groom’s mom. When it’s the ex’s turn to be escorted to her seat and gets halfway up the aisle with her big toothy smile (she loves it when the spotlight is on her,) I make sure to wait until she’s looking directly at me, then I lean forward and wrap both my arms around her new husband, pick my mouth right up against his neck and whisper some nonsense about it’s so great to finally meet him. \n\nBy the time she turns the corner to take her seat, her face her beet red and smoke is coming from her ears. She sat stiff as a board during the whole ceremony with me right behind her. Bonus points to my husband who didn’t take his assigned seat next to her, and came and sat next to me in the second row. \n\nShe looked pretty miserable the rest of the night and kept shooting me death glances which fazed me not in the slightest. During one of them, I blew her a kiss and I thought the top of her head would blow off and a little man would pop out and run away screaming. \n\nI slept really great that night. \n\nAhh, the little things. \n\n",

I want to go ahead and preface this by saying, I have the greatest wife in the world.\n\nSo a couple of years ago when my wife and I first started dating, I was working as security at a local bar. For the most part I enjoyed my job. I made between 90 to 120 a night for only a few hours work and I got to be front row for any concerts we held there. The only problem I really had was with this one bartender that worked there, who we will call BT for Blonde Twat.\n\nBT made it an almost nightly effort to either to try to get me into trouble or overall just be an unpleasant person. All of us on the security team knew she was screwing the owner, so she got away with murder pretty consistently. In the end she got her way and successfully got me fired over some total bs. So I left and moved on with my life.\n\nNow, my wife and I work overnights at different hotels and earlier this morning she calls me. Apparently, BT tried to get a room at the hotel my wife works at with some random dude she was trying to screw and didn't recognize my wife from when I worked at the bar. \n\nUsing this to her advantage, the wife decided to get a little petty revenge on my behalf by telling BT she couldn't rent her a room because she was on the Do Not Rent list. BT was furious and demanded to know why she was on the list. Straight faced, my wife tells her it says in the computer that she was banned for urinating on the mattresses and that emails had been sent to all the hotels in town to warn them about her. \n\nDead silence followed for a moment as BT processed this and the man she was with stood behind her, disgusted. She stormed off and the guy just stood there for a moment and asked if that really happened. She told him yes and he left.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/915yeg/feel_like_pushing_in_the_airport_queue_not_today/",
        "text": "I was recently returning home to the UK from a holiday in Europe with my family - we'd been up early to get to the airport and I was feeling rather cranky. The airport was already packed by 8am, clearly understaffed and the queue to check in snaked back and forth almost to the front door. \n\nAn announcement was made that a flight to another UK destination was ready to leave, and all remaining passengers for this flight should proceed to the front of the queue. During my bored people watching I had already spotted a particularly obnoxious looking middle aged couple a row or two back, looking disgusted at the thought of having to wait and be herded like cattle towards the check in desk. They were a perfect caricature, like a newspaper cartoon; overweight and expensively dressed, sporting an impressive combover and heavy-looking gold jewellery. \n\nA member of staff called all remaining passengers for the waiting aeroplane and opened a section of stretchy barrier to let them shuffle and apologise their way to the front of the queue. I clocked snobby couple exchange a look and slip through to stand in the new priority line, even though I'd heard them loudly discussing their travel arrangements and knew they were going to a different destination. \n\nSeeing as they'd deliberately pushed in front of everyone, including me and my family, I semi-politely pointed out to the trout-faced woman that she was in fact in the new priority queue specifically for the passengers of a now delayed flight, and that everyone they'd pushed past had been waiting up to an hour longer than them. She couldn't have been less bothered and just shrugged self-righteously with her nose in the air, as if to say 'well I'm here now!'. \nOne thing I cannot stand is people pushing in queues, particularly fellow brits who are essentially going against a deep cultural tradition by disregarding queue etiquette. Unforgivable. \n\nSo I'm standing there, jaded and hangry, bristling with indignation, when I spot the same airport worker who opened the barrier still milling around to supervise the restless queue. A revengeful plan materialises and I sidle over to her, adopt a tone of quiet concern and mention that I saw a suspicious-looking character hovering near trout-face &amp; husband's bags. Not wishing to cause a dramatic security alert and further problems/delays, I kept my suspicions casual and hoped that the member of staff would keep it hush and just take the couple aside. \n\nIt was with profound glee that I strolled back to my family in the queue and watched the indignant couple being escorted out of the priority line and into a small adjoining room. Fast forward 20ish minutes, we've checked our bags in and are just passing through to security when I see the couple emerge from the room looking ruffled and then instantly outraged when they're informed they have to rejoin the back of the main queue as their flight wasn't for a few hours. Much red-faced gesticulating and huffing ensued from trout-face and combover as I cackled and half-skipped through the doors. I saw the couple over an hour later emerging into the departures lounge, looking much less smug than before (although that may have been my imagination). \n\nEdit: paragraphs! (I'm actually an English teacher so this was pretty embarrassing.)",

We're minding our own business talking among ourselves when all of a sudden something hits the floor in front of us. However, not before hitting my knee and spilling its contents all over my sweatpants. I check to see what was thrown at us and I couldn't believe it. Someone threw a cup of sweet n sour sauce. I look around to see who the culprit was and I spot a bunch of teenage boys sitting a couple rows behind us trying not to look me in the eye. I was livid. \n\nI look over to my friend and they just look at me and tell me to leave it be. I wasn't having it. No way in hell I'm about to let these little shits who mind you, I don't even know, get away with this kind of bullshit. I pick that sauce cup right up and throw it right back at them. I managed to hit one of them and I proceeded to tell them off. Unfortunately I don't remember what I said exactly.\n\nThey didn't like it too much that I did the exact same shit they did to me. My friend tells me that they overheard them talking how they're going to \"fight\" me so I talk to my friend about how if they try anything I'm going to beat them up.  I'm pretty sure they overheard me and were silent for the rest of the ride. \n\nWhen they got off the bus the other riders assured me that the group was utterly disrespectful and it was good that I gave them a taste of their own medicine.

        "text": "I'm a pharmacy technician in a Walmart pharmacy and while I like my job most of the time, there's one coworker that always manages to piss everyone off when he works. For the sake of the story let's call him John.\n\nJohn is a part time pharmacist that takes random shifts at different stores in the area. He's the type of guy that seems like he's probably an asshole outside of work. While he doesn't do anything terrible at work, he tends to upset everyone with his actions. He comes in and immediately starts talking about moving this or that, even if we're so busy that there's no way we could get it done. He gets irritated if someone else gets distracted or isn't working fast enough while texting on his phone all day. John will literally finish a personal text before walking over to help a patient or do some other job related task. He insists on following policies to the letter in the way that he interprets them and doesn't care what the pharmacy manager thinks or says. He thinks that he is always right and no one can tell him otherwise.\n\nNow comes the petty revenge. Like I mentioned earlier John is a stickler for the rules and insists that every little rule is enforced and followed. One day I got fed up with his attitude and hatched a plot. When john isn't working I ask the pharmacy manager if I should make more of an effort to put patients in separate pods for the \"counseling\" part of their prescription. The way the pharmacy is set up we have two counseling areas spaced 10 feet away from each other and when it gets busy we'll line up to two patients behind each other for the same pod, having the back one stand further back to ensure patient privacy. This saves the pharmacist time walking back and forth, sometimes helping them keep a cool head. My manager told me that it's better to put the patients in separate pods if one is empty as it makes it more private and decreases the chance of others overhearing private medical information. \n\nNow whenever john works I put the patients in separate pods, making him walk back and forth. He gets irritated and frazzled from the slight stress it causes him and he even confronted me about it. When he asked why I did it, I told him that the pharmacy manager suggested it because it preserves privacy and follows the pharmacy rules better. John said nothing back, knowing that he couldn't argue against the rules and hippaa. Every time I work with him I get to see the mild irritation in his eyes as he walks back and forth over and over again. It may not be a huge revenge but it sure as hell is satisfying.\n\nTl:dr\nPharmacist is a dick about the rules, I use the rules to irritate him and waste his time",

When I got back five minutes later I found that the other 3 kicked my brother and I from the party and queued up for a 3v3 game without us \"as a joke\" and expected us to wait around for the end of the game (which can take 20-30 minutes) so we can all play when they were done. I was not gonna do that so I left the call to do other stuff.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later their game was done and they messaged my brother and I to play with them. I had no interest in doing so and neither did my brother but then I had an idea. I messaged him and told him my plan, and then we both joined the call. We sat around wasting time for a while and then they said \"are we playing or what?\" So we said \"oh sorry, got distracted on reddit\". Started the game on Steam so they would see we were getting on. Then I left the launcher open for a while. They asked again. \"Oh sorry I thought I had hit play but I guess not.\" \n\nThey asked again 5 or so minutes later. \"It's still loading, I can't tell if it's frozen or not\". A few minutes later: \"Ok I think it crashed I'm gonna restart my PC\". We repeated all this stuff between my brother and I for a solid half hour before they all decided to go do other things because the long wait made them not want to even play anymore. 30 minutes * 3 idiot friends = 90 minutes of wasted time. They didn't learn any sort of lesson of course but it felt good nonetheless",

He pulled up to the dog and it hopped right in when he opened the door.  Not being in a particular hurry to get to class, he decided to follow the abandoner.  \n\nIt turned out to be about a thirty minute ride across farmland and roads that wound though clusters of trees, and even though they were not exactly taking their time, my uncle was able to tail them back to their house.  He stopped behind an overgrown fence line right as the guy was walking back into his house.  \n\nAs soon as the door was opened, the dog jumped out and made a beeline to the house.  Not twenty seconds after the front door had closed the dog was scratching at it.  When the \"owner\" opened the door, he was visibly taken aback and let out a loud \"holy shit\" as the pup trotted in like nothing had happened.\n\nJust for the record, I don't agree that my uncle took the best course of action as far as the dog's welfare was concerned.  He was a redneck in the 70's.  He still thinks it's one of the funnier things he has ever done.",

        "text": "One of the many restaurants at which I worked in the past was an Italian place that had actually managed to become a bit of a neighborhood establishment. It was under a mile from my house, we had a steady business of regular guests and newcomers alike, and the menu featured quality food at a price that was good for the servers without being terrible for the guests, if that makes sense. It was a pretty sweet gig…for about a year. \n\nAfter the owner couple divorced, though, everything started to get steadily worse. It was obvious within a few months that the owner’s wife was the one who made everything in that place work like a functioning restaurant. The owner of the place, C, was not a leader or even really a manager. Just a boss. By the time the restaurant closed its doors for good, the Sysco truck only came on the condition of cash on delivery because our credit was no good with them anymore. The part of the dining experience in which the server tells guests about the specials of the day was replaced by the part of the dining experience in which the server tells guests which of their favorite regular menu items would not _actually_ be available that day, and we could essentially add those guests to the 86 list, along with their favorite dishes.\n\nOne night, some time after the divorce but a good few months before that final shift, I was closing with another server, S, of whom the newly single boss seemed to be particularly fond. Closing with her was one of my least favorite parts of the job because talking to her about anything was about as stimulating as discussing theories of ontological empiricism with a Teddy Ruxpin. \n\nThough closing duties weren't too bad if everyone worked together and handled everything as a team, one person working alone could spend a couple hours on closing duties easily, and I had to work my campus job in the morning. I started to pull out tables in the main dining area, and after a few minutes, I realized I still hadn’t seen S in a bit. \n\nI looked through one of the windows in the wall that divided the floor between one of the dining rooms and the bar area, where she was sitting talking to C. She saw me, and I spread my hands and shrugged my shoulders at her, universal body language for “what the fuck are you doing?” She acknowledged with a nod and held up a finger for me to just wait a minute. It seemed I had delivered my message. \n\nI went back to pulling out tables. Minutes later, I hear peals of laughter floating from the bar area.\n\nThe troubling thing about a group of people laughing when only one person is working is that whether it is intentional or not, some of that laughter is at least subconsciously at the expense of that one working person. The joke is that it sure is nice to have the luxury to kick back and enjoy life while the lesser people labor to make it all possible. It isn’t an especially funny joke, and right then, it was on me.\n\nI walked back to the bar area with the broom in my hand and saw S sitting in a booth drinking a cocktail and C ogling at her while they giggled. They stopped abruptly and looked up at me.\n\n\"I was really hoping you'd at least be rolling some silverware. C, I _need_ some help finishing up here.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Empiar, she's done; don't worry about her,\" C said.\n\n\"The _work_ isn't done, though.\"\n\n\"We can catch what’s left up in the morning. It's fine.\"\n\n\"We're going to cover the food on the salad station make line tomorrow morning after it sits out for nine hours?\" I asked with waning credulity. \n\nHe just looked at me blankly. Apparently, he thought _I_ was going to do all the closing duties, while he flirted with S. As this realization set in, I turned to S.\n\n\"So you're done, huh?\"\n\nShe paused briefly, and a dim awareness that something may be at stake seemed to cross her face. \n\n\"Uhhhh. Yeah?\" \n\nShe looked back over to C for support, but before anyone could say another word, I said, \"Good. I'm done too.”\n\nI turned on my heel and stormed out the back door as C called after me. I peeled out of the parking lot, leaving all the work unfinished. The salad station make line was uncovered and unwiped, the silverware wasn’t rolled, every table and booth in the restaurant was pulled out for sweeping, and the kitchen still needed to be swept and mopped, among a handful of other things. There was probably a solid couple hours of work left to do before a morning crew could start its opening duties in earnest.\n\nWhen I left, I immediately called the manager, Y, who was about the only person that C still listened to after the divorce. I told her what happened, and she did her level best to sound surprised. She told me not to worry about it and that she would “take care of C” for me.\n\nIt has been my experience that certain types of people will not ever apologize out of genuine remorse. They apologize when they realize the social costs of insisting that they are right—in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary—outweigh the costs of admitting they were wrong. C was absolutely not a natural apologizer, so when he came up to me the next day to tell me he was sorry and wrong, I knew that it had taken considerable effort on his part, not to mention Y’s. \n\nIt was very satisfying to briefly stop working, look at him, and say, “I know all of that already.”\n\nTL;DR: I was being treated poorly at work, so I left abruptly one day and got my boss scolded by an actual adult.\n\n",

        "text": "This just happened, so I'm still smiling. My family and I have a camp at the beach, but you have to cross a fairly busy street to get there. The crosswalk is well marked, and traffic must stop for pedestrians. My family, myself and a few other people we're just starting across the crosswalk, when a Raptor pickup comes blowing threw the crosswalk, within inches of the crowd. Everyone yelled at the guy, and his girlfriend? gave us the finger. We crossed over, and I continued down the sidewalk along the beach to go on a walk,  but everyone else went on to the beach. A little ways down, I saw the pickup parked, and the couple pulling their bikes out to go for a ride. I saw the man put his keys in the door for his gas filler. As I got closer, the person parked in front of them pulled out, while they rode away. When I got next to their truck, I noticed that they had paid for 2 hours on the meter but the one in front of them had expired. I instantly hatched my evil plan. Parking meters are rigorously enforced by a plethora of summer parking enforcers and fines are pretty stiff, so I knew what I had to do. I made sure they weren't around, took his keys, and moved him up one spot, so he was on an expired meter, put his keys back, went down to the beach and waited. 15 minutes later, he had a fresh ticket! About an hour after that, they came back, but didn't see the ticket right away. When he did, he was furious! He went back and forth between looking at the meter, and yelling at his girlfriend? then sped away. I know it was a dick move, but they deserved it!",

        "text": "I was reminded of this story earlier today and, as so many have said before me, I thought it belonged here. \n\nThis is long because I feel the need to describe the various ways Dick was such a turd, but I'll put a TL;DR at the end because it's a pretty long lead up for something so insanely petty.\n\nIt is by far the pettiest thing I've ever done in a work setting, and if you asked real-life me, I'd tell you I was embarrassed that I behaved in such a way. But secretly, nah. I'd probably do it again under the same circumstances.\n\nThis story involves a guy we'll call Dick, because... Do I really have to explain why?\n\nI had the displeasure of working with Dick over a decade ago. I say \"displeasure\" because Dick was a miserable little bitch. I don't really know why he was so miserable in life, though I had a sneaking suspicion that his wife made more money than he did (she drove a convertible, and he... drove like a Geo Metro or a Hyundai Accent or something similarly \"budget conscious.\") and in turn I think he felt a little emasculated at home. After all this time, I admittedly couldn't point to one specific thing he said or did that led me to draw this conclusion about him, other than to tell you that after working with him for several years and hearing the way he talked about his wife (snarled about her, if I'm being honest) left me with a lasting impression of how he *really* felt, regardless of whatever words actually came out of his mouth. \n\nHe basically seemed to spend a large part of his day convincing himself, and I'm sure he hoped others, that he was in fact the proud owner of one still-functioning penis. \n\nDick was the kind of guy who \"didn't smoke, not really\" but still somehow managed to come out at least once a day and beg a cigarette from one of us. About once a month or two, he promised to buy a pack to \"pay us back\" but, I'm sure in what will be a surprise to absolutely no one, such a pack never materialized. [I know, smoking is gross. I have since moved to vaping for harm reduction until I quit for good.]\n\nDick once had a snit fit and refused to sign a birthday card because... We \"never\" invited him to lunch, and since it was clear that we didn't consider him part of the group, he wasn't going to sign the card. [We were a 9 or 10 person department; sometimes, a few of us would break off and get take out from the same place. It wasn't the same group of folks each time, mind you. The process was typically someone saying to the department \"Hey, I'm going to This Place for lunch, anyone want anything?\" And then whoever felt like getting something from that place gave the person who volunteered their money and order, or went with them. If you didn't want something from that place, you'd do your own thing. But, I guess because we didn't specifically invite/ask Dick, or ask what he was in the mood for, we were excluding him. Nevermind that he never offered to go anyplace for us. Again, in a move that I'm sure will shock no one, when we thereafter made a point to ask him, he always bowed out. And no, we did not give him attitude when asking.]\n\nDick also thought that making fun of people's names with \"jokes\" that were old by the third grade was both hilarious and had a place in a work environment. While standing smoking a \"borrowed\" cigarette one day, he actually said to me \"Koontz? More like 'Cunts', right?!?!\" \"Yeah Dick. I sure haven't been hearing that for 20 years.\" [No, he did not actually say that because that's not my actual last name, but he said the rest of it and it gives you, gentle reader, an idea of the type of lame pun my last name can be subjected to. And to be clear, this guy was at least 20 years older than I was, and also blew a gasket whenever anyone just misspoke his last name, so you'd think he'd be both a little more mature and a little less tone deaf about this kind of joke. But, you'd think wrong! Grow the fuck up, Dick!] \n\nThere's a million other things I could tell you about Dick, but I think you get the picture about what a complete turd burglar this guy was, and this is getting long.\n\nNow, an important thing to know about Dick is that he loved him some coffee. It was probably the most relatable thing about him. Another important thing to know about Dick was that he also felt that actually *making* coffee was a task that was, simply put,  beneath him. So, while 99% of the working population understands that if you take the last cup, the social contract dictates you start a new pot brewing, Dick seemed to think that coffee just magically came into existence for him and him alone. I cannot tell you the number of times I walked into the break room as he walked out with a fresh cup to find the pot empty. And it wasn't just that he was so busy that he didn't have time. The man was so brewing-averse that on the rare occasion that he walked in to the break room to an empty pot (usually first thing in the morning before someone else had a chance to start a pot) he would scour one of the other break rooms in the building until he found a cup, a practice that definitely took longer than putting a filter and a new packet of coffee in the maker and hitting the on button (he didn't even have to add water, the coffee maker was plumbed right into the building's water, nor did he have to measure the coffee as it was pre-measured.) I don't know if a coffee pot killed his father when he was a young boy and he wanted to challenge it to a duel or what, but when it came to coffee (and, I suspect, a great number of other things) he was a taker, not a giver. \n\nOne day, I walked in to find an empty coffee pot. Grumbling under my breath, I prepared to start a new pot when I see, on the counter next to the sink, a mug full of coffee. But, not just any mug, of course. *Dick's mug.* And, nary a Dick in sight. \n\nEnter my petty revenge. After years of his stupid shit, my time had come. \n\nWith an eye and ear to the door to confirm no one was coming in, I dumped over half that mug of coffee down the sink. But I left some of it. I wanted that shit bag to know that it was a deliberate action, and not someone coming along and just cleaning up. I then immediately beat feet to one of the other break rooms for my own cup instead of starting a fresh pot - I was not about to reward him with a piping hot fresh pot of coffee.\n\nDick spent the rest of the afternoon bitching like the little bitch he was about how while he was in the bathroom someone stole his coffee, and how immature do you have to be to do something like that? I just nodded along and agreed how terrible it was, with the biggest shit-eating grin on my face when he wasn't looking.\n\nHe eventually quit, thank goodness. I can't be certain, of course, but I like to imagine that one of the reasons he left was to find an environment with more mature people. Maybe he was sad that he'd been out-immatured? \n\nTL;DR: after years of lazy co-worker never making coffee, I dump a mug of his unattended coffee down the sink, resulting in a minor inconvenience for him.\n\n",
