        "text": "\"The defects of this theory of life are obvious. In the first place, as to the matter of fact, experience shows that happiness is not best attained by directly seeking it. The selfish are not more happy, but less so, than the unselfish. In the next place the theory altogether destroys virtue as virtue, and eliminates the idea and sentiment expressed by the words \"ought\", \"duty\", \"right\", and \"wrong\". Virtue, indeed tends to produce the truest and, highest pleasure; all such pleasure, so far as it depends upon ourselves, depends upon virtue. But he who practises virtue for the sake of the pleasure alone is selfish, not virtuous, and he will never enjoy the pleasure, because he has not the virtue. A similar observation may be made upon the Epicurean theory of friendship. Friendship for the sake of advantage is not true friendship in the proper sense of the word. External actions, apart from affection, cannot constitute friendship; that affection no one can feel merely because he judges it would be advantageous and pleasurable; in fact he cannot know the pleasure until he first feels the affection. If we consider the Epicurean condemnation of patriotism and of the family life, we must pronounce a still severer censure. Such a view of life is the meanest form of selfishness leading in general to vice. Epicurus, perhaps, was better than his theory; but the theory itself, if it did not originate in coldness of heart and meanness of spirit, was extremely well suited to encourage them. If sincerely embraced and consistently carried out, it undermined all that was chivalrous and heroic, and even all that was ordinarily virtuous. Fortitude and justice, as such, ceased to be objects of admiration, and temperance sank into a mere matter of calculation. Even prudence itself, dissociated from all moral quality became a mere balancing between the pleasures of the present and of the future.\"\n\n[Source](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05500b.htm).

I mean I don’t know what kind of technology and methods criminal investigators have. \n\nI have to consider its monetary value, lets say I’m a millionare and the fraud gains me 100,000$….. well at the moment it represents no significant value because I can already afford pretty much all I need.

But I just watched the Disney movie Soul and though I have watched it before this is the first time I've watched it through an Epicurean lens and I want to give my thought on it. \n\nFor those who haven't watched it I highly recommend it, without spoiling too much its about a man name Joe Gardener, an inspiring jazz musician who has spent his whole life waiting for his chance to finally play in a band. The day he finally gets his chance he falls down a manhole and dies. He wakes up on the path to the great beyond but he refuses to die and so he accidentally ends up in the great before, a realm where young souls get their personalities before going to Earth. There he meets 22, a rebellious soul who doesn't care to live. With her help he gets back to Earth but by accident 22 is in his body and he is in the body of a cat. They then try to find how to get Joe to his first performance on time and in his body, all the while 22 begins to experience what it is to be alive. She eats food, makes friends, experiences what it is to have a caring family, and through fresh eyes sees the beauty of the world. \n\nSlight spoiler: At the end Joe realizes that he had been wasting his life waiting to live his ideal life while missing the pleasures that were open to him. Eating a slice of pie, helping others discover their passion for music, enjoying a beautiful day. My favorite line in the movie right after his performance, he tells the band lead that he had been waiting his entire life for this moment and that he thought he would feel different, in response the band lead says, \"*I heard this story about a fish.*\n\n*He swims up to an older fish and says, “I’m trying to find this thing they call ‘the ocean.'”*\n\n*“The ocean? the older fish says, “That’s what you’re in right now.”*\n\n*“This?” says the young fish. “This is water. What I want is the ocean!”, .*\n\nMy take away is that the pleasures of life are right here right now, I'm sitting in bed with my favorite show on, feeling the cool breeze of the fan, listening to the rhythmic sounds of the keyboard; it's beautiful, life is beautiful, let us never forget that. \n\nTL;DR: Watch Soul and then live life.",

I tried asking my professor but still can't seem to understand fully.\n\nI know that pleasure is necessary for a good life(ataxaria) in moderation of course. There are multiple pleasure such as natural, necessary, body, mind, kinetic and katastematic.  A natural, non necessary, kinetic and body pleasure would be for example sex. It is natural, not really necessary, is an action and pleases the body. In moderation of course. Now non natural and unecessary pleasures such as a golden chair would be useless for epicureanism.\n\nHaving unfilled desires lead to anxiety which is suffering. Suffering usually ends up with an inidividual wanting more pleasure.\n\nMental pleasures are greater than body pleasure because body suffering are in the present but mental sufferings can be about the past, present and future ( mental illnesses per example)\n\nI seem to understand quit a lot but I still can't figure it what is the role and how to separate it in different paragraphs.",

        "text": "Arguments about human nature have been a central focus of philosophy for centuries (if not millennia if we account for Ancient Greek philosophy and Eastern philosophy) and the concept continues to provoke lively philosophical debate to this day (in the modern day it usually connects to the idea of ‘nature vs nurture’). Plato and Aristotle both gave philosophical accounts and theories on human nature. Both of these thinkers views on human nature informed their respective accounts of civilization. For example, Aristotle argued that man is a conjugal animal, political animal and mimetic animal. Much of Aristotle's description of human nature is still influential today.\n\nHowever, I was wondering though what were the Epicurean and Stoic theories of human nature and how it relates to their respective accounts of civilization (both Epicureanism and Stoicism I find to be the most interesting Ancient Greek schools of thought). I feel like their views get overlooked a lot of time (as Plato and Aristotle usually take the spotlight in my experience) and I am very fascinated in learning what their theories of human nature are. My experience so far is confused and muddled when looking into this issue because some people I have spoken to say their theories are very similar (if not identical) and then others say they are completely opposite from one another. Either way, I would love to learn more about this. Thank you!",

        "text": "tl;dr- we need to make it easy to meet people like you to become friends with and live all together. lets start the dialogue.\n\n​\n\nthis morning i stumbled upon Epicurus, i had a memory of someone mentioning a philosopher who believed all you need in life is to live with your friends and eat cheese, so i looked up just that.\n\ni watched this video first: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg\\_47J6sy3A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kg_47J6sy3A)\n\nthe information covered in the video shook me up because they are in so many ways how i do live my life; i live with my 2 favorite people, we live somewhere cheap so work can very little, i even work with one of my friends cleaning hotel rooms as a team for only 2 or 3 days a week, we spend our time working on our own creative projects in the same room, we learn new things and share them.(after i watched the video i went into the kitchen and said hey watch this video while you eat breakfast you will feel all crazy ways) we all have journals keeping track of our goals and when we share the same goal (ex. health, learning about a specific topic) we work on it together, we eat meals together, we play video games. i do believe that if epicurus were here today he would endorse video games lol. we actually all wanted vr(vive) and because we all split it it was way cheaper. teamwork is obviously the way to go.\n\ni do acknowledge how lucky i am to have found people so like me. currently while i type this.. one of them is behind me painting and the other is working on their website.\n\nwhen in the video, he mentioned that at its height there were \\~400,000 houses of people living, learning and creating together as we do, and they got destroyed by the chrisitian church, i cried. for about 5 minutes. and my friend shared the grief with me. she agrees. what a shame. we are so happy together. and there were so many other people living happily like we do.. and it stopped. earth would be so much better if this was a commonly done.\n\nmy imagination started running. ive been thinking about ways to gather people who egolessly want to learn what they can and be themselves. i dont want a cult i just want more friends really. but its so hard to find them... i think that this specific philosophy and mentality could be a joining force to find the right people though. im not sure, i found my friends by accident...\n\nwe recently moved somewhere cheap and beautiful. we rent the downstairs apartment of a beautiful victorian house. the town is located in a valley between mountains. the state minimum wage here is one of the highest in the country. it has an artistic community but sometimes i find museum artists to be snobby so we stick to ourselves mostly. a lot of the houses here are abandoned, huge, and victorian. i see a possibility of building a community here.\n\nbut if i think **smaller**, there has to be a way for people to find others in the same city so they can be together.\n\n​\n\nreddit seems like a good place to get dialogue going.\n\n​\n\nhappy livin from my friendfamily to yours &lt;3\n\n\\-sisters of satan\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n​",

She now works in London.\n\n* [Lucretius, part 1: a poem to explain the entire world around us](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/21/lucretius-de-rerum-natura-poem)\n\n&gt; The subject of Lucretius's six-book poem De Rerum Natura was not war, love, myth or history – it was atomic physics.\n\n* [Lucretius, part 2: all things are made of atoms](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/jan/28/lucretius-all-things-atoms)\n\n&gt; In Lucretius's universe, there are atoms and there is void – completely empty space. Nothing else can be said to exist.\n\n* [Lucretius, part 3: chaos and order](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/04/lucretius-part-3-chaos-order)\n\n&gt; The atomic swerve is a simple idea that explains both the existence of the world and our ability to act freely within it.\n\n* [Lucretius, part 4: things fall apart](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/feb/11/lucretius-part-4-things-fall-apart)\n\n&gt; A life too long lived is a misery in itself. When the body dies, the soul disperses as it is mortal like the world around us.\n\n* [Lucretius, part 5: all perceptions are true](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/feb/18/lucretius-perceptions-true)\n\n&gt; Everything we see is made up of the infinite atoms that swirl about us. These perceptions are the basis of our certain knowledge about the world.\n\n* [Lucretius, part 6: not designed for life](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/feb/18/lucretius-part-5-not-designed-for-life)\n\n&gt; The final two books of the poem end with a grim picture of plague and war. His challenge to the reader is to look at suffering and be grateful that we are safe.\n\n* [Lucretius, part 7: becoming a god](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/feb/25/lucretius-becoming-god)\n\n&gt; Lucretius's Epicurean philosophy doesn't deny gods' existence, only that they affect us. Instead, we must aim to be as them.\n\n* [Lucretius, part 8: teachers and pupils](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/mar/11/lucretius-teachers-and-pupils)\n\n&gt; Lucretius's didactic poetry addresses a single person but cajoles his readers to heed his lesson, as he learned from Epicurus.\n\n* [Lucretius, part 9: the calculating poet](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/mar/18/lucretius-part-9-calculating-poet)\n\n&gt; Why did Lucretius choose to write in poetry? The answer lies in his evangelism for both Epicureanism and his own legacy.",

        "text": "I am a proponent of what I call New Epicureanism or essentially a modern updated view of Epicurean ethics and philosophy. The principles of Epicurus should be expanded to account for our modern world, and simple interpretations of 2300 year old philosophies are too simplistic and misleading for living modern lives.\n\nTake for instance the idea of political disengagement from Epicureanism. I think if you took his words literally or at least simply, you would think that Epicurus suggests we do not run for office or we should be apolitical or we should just live with the system not trying to fight against it because its either futile or because it removes ataraxia or our sense of calm.\n\nMy proposal is simply to give a more dynamic perspective to Epicurean philosophy. So it means emphasizing more critical ideas of Epicurus more relevant in the modern age. I think a positive epicurean perspective on politics entails understanding political issues i.e. trying to use reason, logic and empirical evidence to understand issues. It means being critically minded when it comes to politics and not falling for conspiracy theories (or myths). It means understanding enough about a candidates policies as a way to choose political candidates. You do not want to harm yourself by choosing candidates that will end up harming you, so you want to choose the best candidates. If we consider Epicureanism, it seems to be stuck on a simplistic cost-benefit analysis. The reality of living in a modern interconnected global world is that its not a zero sum game, and that there are complex interconnected issues, so essentially we choose candidates that give us optimum harm we can allow while giving us pleasure by ensuring their governance meets our basic needs and the needs of our fellow kinsmen.\n\nPolitical disengagement in this new Epicurean model means more about not getting hung up on outcomes. It also means ensuring that politics doesn't dominate our entire lives from morning to sunset. We need to be able to disengage from the political bubble and speak freely with others. It means that there is more to a person than their politics. \n\nPlitical disengagement does not mean we should not actively participate in politics, it just means we should be able to understand the consequences and risks of participating, and weigh whether the harm caused by non participation is greater than the benefits gained by participation.\n\nI would even posit that ataraxia should be the starting point and not the end point of our actions. In other words, Epicureans should be willing to sacrifice ataraxia if it means we get more pleasure in the long run. In the Letter to Menoeceus, Epicurus states the following: ''We cannot live pleasantly without living wisely, honorably, and justly; nor live wisely, honorably, and justly without living pleasantly''\n\nI would state that you cannot have ataraxia in the middle of a corrupt and unjust regime with unjust laws. Or even if you were able to delude yourself into living in this bubble, it would be more pleasurable to live in a just world than vice versa, and so your ataraxia should be sacrificed for greater happiness. All politics is based on this principle of greater happiness.",
