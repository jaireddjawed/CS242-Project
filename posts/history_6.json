Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.\n\nWe thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!\n\nOf course it‚Äôs not limited to \\*just\\* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder, [r/history](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/) also has a recommended list of things to \\[read, listen to or watch\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/recommendedlist))",

On the grounds of the St. George's [Cricket Club](https://crichubb.com/) in New York, the game was played.\n* Four deliveries made up a normal over during the most of the 19th century. First-class cricket began using five-ball overs in 1889; in 1900, six-ball overs became the norm.\n\nEight-ball overs were occasionally employed in a few of nations in the 20th century , especially Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand, where eight-balls were the norm over length from 1918/19 to 1978/79. Six balls have been used in every over since the 1979‚Äì80 Australian and New Zealand seasons, and the most cur.rent iteration of the Laws only allowed six-ball overs.",
