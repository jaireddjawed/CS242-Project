I couldn't see its face, I only say woman like because of the dress. Any ideas? I was terrified and turned into the bathroom quickly when I came out it was gone. \n\nI've tried turning lights on and off, looking from different angles etc and there's no possible way it was a shadow or anything in the lounge. Where I saw it is an empty space between a couch and a cabinet. \n\nI've had alot of paranormal experiences but this one actually terrified me.",

        "text": "Yesterday, or rather today in the early morning around 2 AM i heard a bang from my kitchen wich is right behind the left wall of my living room, i mean i know that creepy sounds at night are normal like that plastic bottle popping out of nowhere but that was a legit bang and it got my heartrate going so i said nah fam no way in hell i'm gonna check on that. i tried to continue playing the hogwarts game with the headphones down since i was really nervous at that point. And i kept hearing some more minor noises here and there that weren't there any other day. like a single knock or \"footsteps\"  but only two at a time. I'm not lying that was really putting me off. \n\nSo i forced myself to go to bed and it took a while untill i could sleep, i heard 2 more noises while in bed. \n\nSo. I just woke up and wanted to see what that bang was all about and the result is really unsetteling me. I'll try to include a picture, i've never posted here before but the result is my spices and herbs for cooking fell down even though they're standing on an even cupboard. two even fell down on the floor wich is quite the distance as you can hopefully see in the pic. There is a solid 40cm distance that is covered by my stove and the workplate that the spices must travel before hitting ground, so even if i had put them uncarefully in ther place, if they just fell out they must've landed on the workplate not the floor, also its 4 glasses of spices that fell. garlic and pepper landed on the workplate, salt and chives laded on the floor. That has never happened before and the spices are standing in the same place for five years now (not the same glasses but you get me). yea no, i really can't think of any other explanation than BOO! i hate it.\n\nI really don't (want to) believe in paranormal shit but thats the closest to that anything has ever happened to me (aside a sleep paralysis when i was like 14) but yea i guess i know who i'm gonna call....",

        "text": "I have experienced a few paranormal things in my life and was haunting for 6 months by something about 15 years ago.\n\nI moved into this house almost a year ago and here is the story so far.\nI live in UK, in a old house that was built in 1800 something. The house is old but interior is all modern. There is myself, my girlfriend, and 4 kids who stay 50% of the time.\n\nOur first encounter was like any other. Strange banging noises, distant voices etc. We chalked this up to hearing noises from neighbours next door. \n\n- One night my girlfriend was asleep in bed and my toddler was asleep in her room. \nSuddenly my bedroom door handle opened and the door slowly opened about 3 inches, then slowly closed again. I immediately get up and open the door expecting my toddler to be on the other side. Nobody there and shes asleep in bed still.\nA little freaked out i got back into bed, 2 minutes later, my girlfriend jumps up an says \"whats up? Why did you wake me up?\"\nI replied i didnt and she said \"you just shook me awake\" now i was pretty freaked out and starting to believe we had something going on here.\n\n- Another encounter, i heard a certain door open and shut violently. I know the exact noise of this door as it is very loud due to it being stiff. I was alone in the house.\n\n- My girlfriend woke up in the middle of the night freaked out after feeling \"something crawling ontop of her, like the toddler\"\n\n- I just finished a night shift, and last night my girlfriend and 12 year old daughter were sitting in bed and heard what they described as \"repetative chanting of multiple voices\" like there was a group of people repeating a word in unison. I asked them what word, but they couldnt make it out. Said it was like a \"pah and ah and something unintelligable\" sounds.\n\nId like to try catch something on camera or other recording but these things happen rarely, sometimes weeks or months between. Any one have any suggestions here? Id like to add im not scared or it or believe in devils or demons that can hurt us.",

        "text": "what we know is all wrong.\n\nI have been contemplating about writing this for a long time. Truth is I don’t know if this is real or if it’s all in my head Whatever this is though has changed me in so many ways and I now know I am in danger. We all are.\n\nBut let’s start from the beginning.\n\nThe first time it happened I was praying. I had recently lost my Grandmother and I was feeling lost. I decided that I would turn to God to find peace and some answers and come to terms with her death. The chapel I went to was the one that my Grandmother used to take me. It was small and always very quiet. Not many people visited. I decided to go there to feel closer to her. As I walked in I could see no one in which made me feel better, I really didn’t want to lose it in front of other people. I sat down to enjoy the silence and started praying.\n\nImagine my surprise when in the middle of my prayer I heard this little voice whispering “I hear you”. I jumped up and looked around. I was clearly alone in and I could not locate the source of the voice. I decided that it was a figment of my imagination and continued to pray. 5 minutes later though the voice came stronger. “You shouldn’t be doing that” It was right next to my ear. So close it made the hairs on my neck stand up and sent shivers down my spine.\n\nAs I turned around I came face to face with a girl. Maybe 11-12. She was wearing this red dress and she was barefoot. Her hair was the darkest black I have ever seen and her eyes the same. I started screaming but at the same time I was mesmerised by her beauty. “Shhhhh” she said putting her hand on my mouth. “ do you want father to hear us?” Her touch was soothing and not threatening in any way. “Who are you?” I asked trying to fight back tears. “I am the Devil” she said. “ The first unwanted” I started trembling,fearing this was the end of me. She moved closer and as if reading my mind she said “Don’t worry my child, I won’t hurt you. I am not the one you should be afraid of. I have come to warn you as I have done with so many others”\n\nA sudden noise, like whistling made her stop talking and I could see fear in her eyes. I tried to locate the source of the sound and by the time I turned around to face her she was gone.\n\nOnly her scent lingered. This lovely lavender scent.\n\nI stayed there not moving, trying to listen for what felt like hours. I was sure I was going crazy and convinced myself this was all due to grief and lack of sleep but as I closed the door behind me to head to my car I heard her whisper again. “Be careful” ...\n\nIt had been a week since the incident and I had almost forgotten about it.\n\nI could hear the occasional whisper and catch a glimpse of something red in the corner of my eye but never something specific.\n\nFate would have it I had to go and pick up my mom from the bus station and the only way there, yes you guessed it, was past the road with the chapel.\n\nThe drive was uneventful until I got to the crossing in front of the chapel. I was getting nervous remembering what had happened so I turned the radio on louder and tried to find a relaxing song.\n\nAnd that’s when it came. The smell. The freakin’ lavender smell.\n\nI looked up from the radio and there she was. She was standing in front of the car. She looked exactly as she had before but different at the same time. Older, tired.\n\nI screamed and got out of the car. I started running in the field behind me. I was losing it! The tears came and I succumbed to my fate. I turn around to face her as I could feel she had followed me.\n\n“What do you want from me” I screamed at her.\n\nShe looked at me with that deep sadness in her eyes and came closer.\n\n“I want you to hear me out child. I want to protect you. I am running out of time and you have to help me”. I was lost for words but somehow mastered the courage to reply. “Me?! Help you? Aren’t you supposed to be all powerful and ummm evil?Aren’t you the Devil?”\n\nShe came next to me and this time smiled.\n\n“My lovely child yes I was powerful once. But evil never. As for the name? I kind of hate it. You can call me Lilith.” Somewhere in the distance whistling was heard.\n\nI tried to speak but she cut me off. “Child you have to understand that what you know is all wrong. The world is in danger. You have been taught so many lies. You have been deceived. I am not the one you should be afraid of. I am not the one that is going to hurt you. I was God once”. Hearing that I started laughing. I laughed and laughed because I was sure I was crazy. This could not be happening. This thing in front of me, Lilith, was claiming to be God.\n\nShe grabbed my hand and my laugh was cut short. “Child you have to understand” she said. “I don’t have much time. Can’t you see I am different? I am getting older. Dying even. He found a way to make it happen. And if I am gone there is no one to save you. See through the lies. Believe me”\n\nThe whistling was heard again. Closer. She squeezed my hand with profound urgency and pleading eyes.\n\nWhatever made me say the next words changed my life forever. “Ok let’s say I start to believe you. How can I help. What is happening?”\n\nThe wind picked up suddenly and I saw her shivering. “Not here” she said “I will explain tonight. In the chapel. Tell no one where you are going. Don’t even think about it in your mind. He is everywhere”\n\nAnd with that she disappeared. I was left alone once again thinking that I was insane. Imagining things. The red mark on my hand from where she held me though was there to prove me wrong.\n\nI suddenly remembered about my mum and checked the time. I was surprised to see that no time had passed and somehow I was standing right next to my car.\n\nI decided to do what I was told and not to dwell on it in my head. I don’t know who “he” was but I was suddenly afraid.\n\nThe rest of the drive was uneventful and I have to admit that seeing my mom made me feel better.\n\nUpon returning home we sat down and had dinner together, happily chatting away and reminiscing about the last time she came to visit.\n\nSuddenly she stood up and proceeded to say she had a gift for me. She ran out to the car and brought in this little packet and gave it to me.\n\n“I hope you like it my dear. It’s a new perfume. Try it”, she said.\n\nI thank her and proceeded to open it. I took the cap of to smell it and froze. It was lavender.\n\nI tried my best to hide my horror from my mother and casually asked her why she chose to buy me this specific one.\n\nIn retrospective I wish I never asked because her answer chilled me to the core.\n\nShe explained that she was in the shop struggling to buy me a present when a girl approached her . A girl roughly my age. With a lovely red dress. Hey hair was the darkest black and so were her eyes. My mom said she was instantly drawn to the girl and they started chatting.\n\nThe girl was really interested to hear that my mother had a daughter and asked all sorts of questions about me. She said the girl suggested the perfume because it was her favourite. My mother said the girl seemed sure that I would love it as lavender has such a soothing and familiar scent.\n\nI wish I could tell her how wrong she was.\n\nWith this discovery in my mind I decided I couldn’t hear any more so I found an excuse to cut the conversation short and put a film on.\n\nA couple of hours later I said goodnight to my mom and headed up to my room.\n\nThe time was almost midnight. I made sure my mom went to bed, waited a bit until she fell asleep and got ready to make my way to the chapel.\n\nI was terrified but determined to find out what was going on.\n\n“Ok Lilith”, I whispered as I got in my car. “You have my attention”",

While doing so, I noticed light moving on wall. Near my window. Sometimes I notice this if people are crossing over from just them passing by in between the lights.\n\nAfter being a little nervous I got up to see if someone was in front of my window maybe on patio but there wasn’t anyone. Then I noticed my curtain string was swaying back and forth on its own. It did this for a good 45 minutes but has since stopped.\n\nCould anyone tell me if it’s possible this is air flow? There was no draft I could feel and no other strings with my other curtains were moving. Cant post video idk how. They should update that though.",

        "text": " *Excuse my grammar as it's my second language.* \n\n*Due to certain financial circumstances, I'm living with my uncle and little 10 year old cousin.*   \n\n\n*I've been living with my uncle for about 2 years and throughout that time, my cousin and I have grown pretty close. Like a brother and sister to the point where every night, we talk in the middle of the hallway before bedtime and say goodnight to one another because our bedroom doors are right in front of each other.*\n\n*About 2 months ago, she began asking and telling me strange things during our bedtime goodbyes.* \n\n*The first time it occured, she asked me ''you got lucky with the money, huh?'' I was confused and asked her what she was talking about but she laughed it off and claimed with an unbelieving tone ''you know already... Okay. Goodnight then.'' And the next day, I found a 20 dollar bill stuck up against a chain fence but I thought it was only a coincidence.*\n\n*The second time was a bit more specific. She asked me ''did you find it? Or it's still lost?'' I told her I wasn't looking for anything and she said ''oh, then you haven't found it.'' The next day, I lost the keys to the storage rooms from my job.* \n\n*The third time it happened, she asked me if I was ever stung by a bee. The next day during work, I stepped on an inline irrigation valve lid and it just so happened to have a bee hive inside and I got chased off by a swarm of bees and got stung 3 times.* \n\n*On the fourth time, she told me to lean down to her height and she randomly began rubbing my forhead and said ''there. You feel better?'' Figuring she was just playing a game, I answered yes and went off to sleep. The next day, while loading our trucks with equipment, I closed the tailgate and ducked down to secure the utility trailer but just then, one of my co-workers hopped on the truck bed and opened the tailgate, not noticing I was under it and upon hearing the sound of someone pulling the tailgate handle, I looked up as it slammed onto my forehead, giving me a pretty bad bruise.*\n\n*And most recently, she asked me ''do you know where they sell lentil soup?'' I answered her with ''the grocery store.'' The next day while hanging out with my friend, he got a text from his girlfriend and looked annoyed so I asked him what was wrong. My friend told me ''she's always asking dumb questions. She's a full grown adult with a college degree and she's asking me where she can buy lentils.'' At that moment, I was just freaked out and still am. I didn't even say anything.* \n\n*I'm a bit afraid thinking she might say something worrisome next time but then I think to myself that I'm looking too much into this and it's all just the one in a million coincidence like the people that win the lottery.*",

        "text": "Hell-House (Part 2 of Why I Believe - My first encounter) \n\nI need to take a moment to describe fear. I'm older man now. I have lived around the world. I spent many years in the US Army and almost as many years as a police officer. I am also a combat veteran. I have had many people try kill me. They've tried to shoot me, stab me, blow me up with bombs, rockets, mortars, run me over with vehicles and fight me with hands and feet. I've used sand to clean blood, pieces of bone and human hair off of my boots and clothes so I can sit down and eat a meal. I have seen tragedy on a scale some only read about or see in movies. I understand fear. I know fear. I have literally fought for my very life scores of times. \n\nI'm only saying those things to make a point: there are different kinds of fear. In combat and hairy situations as an officer, time seemed to slow down to a crawl for me. My thoughts were clear...crisp. I knew exactly what to do and how to do it. \n\nBut the fear I felt that hot summer day in 1982 was a different kind of fear. The only thing I had been scared of up to that point was the sound my dads belt made as it was jerked past the belt loops of his pants. Oh, and red wasps. (Now as a grown man I can add spiders. Kill all spiders with fire.) \n\nThe fear that gripped me standing in the bathroom doorway of hell-house was breathtaking and not in the good way that term is most often used. It was like a truck was parked on my chest and I couldn't inhale enough to lift it. That very specific fear would visit me many...MANY times. In fact, throughout my life I used that fear to determine if I was \"just scared\" or if something..or some unseen thing  was in the room. It is oppressive. Heavy. My ears rings and it feels like something is crawling under my skin. I freaking hate it. \n\nSo...now you know the fear I will be describing as these stories progress. It isn't an \"alert\" or \"what was that noise\" fear. It's the \"I tripped and that 400 pound tiger just grabbed my neck and is rag-dolling me.\" \n\nLet's continue. \n\nWe all stood there, me and my mother on the porch, my father looking over his shoulder with one foot on the front steps. Within a matter of minutes Mrs. Blue vanished. Like someone unplugged her or flipped off the switch. Then in a cacophony of incoherent garble my mother and I tried to regurgitate the events of the last hour. There was lots of \"what's?\" \"Wait, slow down\" and at least two \"In the bathtub?\". \n\nAt some point we went into the house. A little bit of chatter here and there and I was sent to go play. I chose to conduct that activity in my room. I barely slept that night. \n\nThe next day my mother did not make her routine phone call. My outdoor functions were limited to within a few steps of our porch. Things seemed to return to normal, however. There was no further talk of Mrs. Blue until.... \n\nSeveral days later I went out on the front porch and did what had now become habit: casting a wary glance across the yard at the back porch of hell-house. So far, there had been nothing there. But this day was different. She was there. In all her umbrellaed glory. A perfect, almost see through shape of a woman in a dress, bonnet on her head holding an umbrella in her right hand. And facing me. Motionless. \nI stood perfectly still also. Not because I was curious. Not because I was brave. I stood frozen for the simple reason that my scrawny legs would not operate. My left hand was still on the doorknob of my front door. That same fear I felt when I first saw the three overwhelmed me. It's like I was in already set cement up my neck. Couldn't breathe. Couldn't move. My little heart was hammering like a Singer sewing machine. Then just like day one, she blinked off. Gone. And then nothing for days again. \n\nThis is going to sound odd, but eventually Mrs. Blue's appearing on the back porch and then switching off became kind of normal. My father had told some co-workers about it and they would come over to our house. My front porch would be frequently blanketed in strangers (to me) gawking across the yard. Occassionally a \"Holy s*&amp;$..there it is\" or a \"Oh...my....god...\" would erupt from the porch. After these outbursts one could look out there and see grown men staring, arms folded across their chest or their arms jutting out of their pants pockets, balled fists visible through their jeans. But all were slack-jawed. \n\nThe evening visits of Mrs. Blue were quite sporadic, so sometimes these strangers left grumbling because she was a no call no show. However, there was one specific time that she would show almost like clockwork. Lunchtime. That'd also be the normal time my mother would go and call my father at work. And she hadn't done that in a while. \n\nGrown-ups do stuff. And sometimes that don't inform their kids of when, how and definetely not why they did this stuff. Here's an example. \n\nIn the kitchen of hell-house there was refrigerator and also a stand-up deep freezer. Now, when you walked across the back porch and entered the door into the kitchen the deep freezer was immediately to your left. If you were to just walk into the kitchen and keep going you would pass the doorway to the diningroom on your right (door closed, of course) and proceed straight through the other door into the hallway. Once there, Barney's mother's bedroom door was on your left (the doorknob would turn, but the door wouldn't open or even flex). Or if you turned right you would proceed down the hallway. Apparently, before my bathtub pow-wow my parents had placed a crap-ton of meat into that deep freezer because our refrigerator freezer had its limits. And since nobody had strayed over to the hell-house in a few weeks, our freezer was empty. \n\nYes, yes... you know what's about to happen. My mother sent me. Which wasn't uncommon. I mentioned in Part 1 (Why I Believe) that sending me to fetch things from the kitchen was normal. But this time I protested. I cried. I begged. All to no avail. So across the yard I begrudgingly slogged. Terrified. I was terrified of that fear I described. I was scared of fear. \n\nGood thing for me, Mrs. Blue wasn't out for her daily porch patrol yet. My knobby knees smacking together sounded like a woodpecker working on a hollow hickory stump. I opened the door and entered the kitchen. Remember...the stand up deep freezer was to my left as I entered. \n\nLet me describe the scene and you see if you can spot the problems. I sure didn't at first. The door opened. To my left I see the white side of the freezer and past that the end of the kitchen table with chairs. Directly in front of me and slightly to the left is the little phone table and chair and DIRECTLY in front of me is the open door to the hallway. As I step in I look to my right through the open door and can see straight through the house allllllll the way to the livingroom. \n\nDid you notice the problems? Trust me. They were about to be rectified and not by me. It didn't even register to me that the doors were open. All of them. I turned to my left and opened the freezer door and began my meat foraging task. \n\nSLAM!!!! A door down the hallway crashed shut. It sounded like that silver revolver my dad shot in the backyard. It was followed quickly by another slam, slightly louder. And then another, even louder. It dawned on my little brain that all of the bedroom and bathroom doors had been open. And they were being slammed shut, one by one in rapid succession. Like something was stomping up the hallway towards me, angrily slamming the doors as they came. That fear engulfed me. And now I am alone. And I left the door to the back porch open. What if it slammed closed too and I couldn't get out. \n\nThen the door from the kitchen into the hallway slammed. It was so damn loud. But by this point I had a bag of frozen chicken legs or something in my hand and I was about to be off like a prom dress. Now, the freezer door opened from the right to the left. So I reached out with my left, grabbed that thing as I was turning to run out of there. As it closed I was now facing the doorway into the dining room. Remember, I could see all the way into the livingroom at the other end. As I was turning the furtherst door, the one from the sitting room into the livingroom, slammed, then the next. The doors were slamming, working their way toward me. And they were slaming hard. The hallway was already blocked off, but I wouldn't have ran that way ANYWAY!! \n\nAs I was rounding the freezer flinging my little body toward the porch, the last door, the one from the kitchen into the dining room slammed. By then I had reached to the porch, running like a scalded dog. The house door then slammed behind me, shutting me out of the house. Believe me when I say, I pee'd a little in my Flintstone underwear somewhere between hell-house and my house. \n\nThe frozen chicken in the bag got to fly one more time for \"old time's sake\" because as my speed catapulted me into our front door I launched the chicken toward our kitchen. It thudded on the mobile home floor like a bowling ball and careened under the table. \n\nI ended my sprint in my bedroom and under my bed. I had shoved myself as far under as I could. Balled my little body up into the corner and cried. I was absolutely scared out of my ever loving mind. \n\nWhatever lived in that house was mad. And I knew from the people in the bathroom and Mrs. Blue on the porch that they could see me. They could see me. They could see me. They could see me. They had voices. They could slam doors. They could see me. Oh my god they could slam doors. What else could they do? \n\nThese angry things did not want us in their house. We would soon find out that they didn't want us in ours either.",

I was a little fella. Now, I am aware that you are going to question how a 7 year old boy can remember this with such detail. I assure you that if you follow along you will understand. \n\nJust prior to us moving there we had our mobile home in a park, paying a lot fee to live there. (Quaint, no? It was 1982, people). My father had recently ran into a childhood friend (let's call him Barney) in town and Barney offered my father something that was just perfect. It turned out that Barney had left the area years ago and moved to Corpus Christi. He had just returned to bury his widowed and recently deceased mother. He was concerned on how he was going to maintain her property and house and suggested that we move our mobile home to the property and exchange rent for being guard dogs. I loved it. Plenty of woods to play in (set them on fire once while playing with matches) and I could shoot my BB gun at any and everything. \n\nNow, I need to describe this house that we were to look after. It was completely furnished AND had a phone. (The phone was apparently a big deal in 1982.) We could use anything in the house and even borrow items if we needed. But there was a rule. Every door in the house had to stay closed. If you find a door open, close it. If YOU open it, close it. And do not go into his mother's room. (The mothers room is a story all to itself). \n\nThis part may seem complicated, but understanding the layout of the house is of great import. This structure was built in the first years of the 1900's. The type was called \"dog-run\". Simple design really. The house was maybe 40' wide, 80' long. Right down the middle of the house was a hallway that split the house into two different sides under one roof. The hallway had doors on both ends, but they typically stayed open during the summer months. The front end of the house had a porch. Sometimes the other end did too, but not this one. All of the rooms in both halves of the house had doors that opened into the hallway. The idea was that during the summer months you opened your bedroom window and door and as the wind blew down the hallway it kept your room cool. Kind of a pretty awesome concept. \n\nHere's the possibly complicated part. The house was oriented North and South lengthwise, with the South end of the house pointed at Ben D. Smith Road. The East half of the house was ordered like this: Starting from the North end it was bedroom, bedroom, bathroom, bedroom and now you were at the South end. \n\nThe West half of the house was ordered like this: Starting from the North end it was Kitchen, dining room, sitting room, living room. Make sense? It is very important to understand the layout. This story (and future ones if you are interested) make more sense if you can visualize the rooms. \n\nTo add one final touch: I mentioned all the rooms had doors that opened to the hallway. In addition, all of the rooms on the West side of the house had doors that led to each other. So, in other words, the kitchen had a door that led to the hallway and another door that led to the dining room, which had a door that led to the hallway and another to the sitting room, etc. \n\nBy the time that we had moved onto the property central a/c had been invented and installed on this particular house. The front porch had been screened in, the other end of the hallway closed off and a back porch added to kitchen. So that means a 3rd door in the kitchen! The new back porch had been screened in, as well, and was on the Northwest side. \n\nAll of this \"door\" talk sounds excessive, right? It is so important to remember that I said at the beginning that Barney's rule was that every door had to remain closed. If found open, close it. If one of us left a door open, close it. \"Wait\", you may ask...\"who else would open a door unless it was you and your family?\" um-hmm... thats why this is getting posted here. \n\nNow that the foundation is laid...lets begin. \n\nMy father worked as a dispatcher a couple of towns away. Every day my mother would let herself into the house and use the phone in the kitched to call my father at lunch. The phone was a rotary phone sitting on a small table in the kitchen. The table was against a wall that butted up to the hallway. There was an uncomfortable chair at the table. I have distinct memories of her sitting at the chair, elbows on her knees and holding the receiver to her ear. I would usually sit in a chair at the kitchen table and wait my turn to speak to my father. I didn't always go with her.. but sometimes I did. \n\nOne particular day I was in the front yard playing. Probably feeding crickets to the ever hungry fireants. My mother was making her usual noon walk across the yard to the phone. She stopped, called me over and told me to come with her. Since both of my parents were rather stern my first assumption was that I was in trouble and I was going to discover my mistake when she told my father about it on the phone call. I obediently followed her almost in tears, but held my curiosity as best I could. As we entered the kitchen I could not contain it anymore. I breathlessly asked her why I had to come with her. I had to know! She said she felt...weird..in the house. Whew..relief. I had been in the house tons of times, even alone to fetch this or that from the kitchen and felt nothing. \n\nAnyway, now that I wasn't in trouble I really needed to pee. I got up from my chair and headed out to door to go outside and pee, cuz thats what you did when you were 7 and lived in the woods. Boy did my mom stop me! She unpolitely told me go to the bathroom in the house. Fine. Either way the pee was getting out. So, down the hallway I trekked. My mother's monotone voice began to fade away the further I went from the kitchen. But I began to detect other voices. It was almost as if a radio was on in one of the bedrooms. But all of the doors were closed. \n\nHowever, the further I got from my mothers voice the more distinct these other voices became. Soon I was able to distinguish three voices, two men and a woman. The two men were adamant that they wanted to leave. But the woman...oh the woman. She sounded strict. She sounded just as adamant as the men. She most certainly was not leaving. \n\nSo what I am about to describe all happened simultaneously. And in about 3 seconds. As I reached to bathroom door I opened it and reached up, flipping on the light. As I opened the door I realized that the voices were not, in fact, coming from a radio in one of the bedrooms. They were coming from the bathroom and they stopped as soon as I cracked the door open. And as I clicked on the light this is what I saw: Two men were standing in the bathtub. Yup...the bathtub. Standing in between the men was a woman. She was wearing an \"old timey\" dress (thats the way I described it at the time), a bonnet and was holding an open umbrella over her head. The two men were wearing white overalls that had thin blue pinstripes that ran from the top to the bottom. They were both were caps that matched their overalls. Both men were looking at the women and she was looking at the man to her right. \n\nNow, as I clicked on the light, saw them, all three snapped their heads to look at me. And I mean LOOK at me. In future stories I will discuss this \"look\" in more depth and other encounters with it. Their faces were expression-less, no anger, no surprise... like if someone is in a dead sleep and then just opens their eyes and looks at you motionless. They saw me. And I saw them. They weren't transparent. They weren't blurry. It was two old dudes and stern old chick looking dead at me. \n\nAgain...this was in like 3 seconds, from start to finish. \n\nWhen I think back on this first encounter, I imagine my legs looking like a cartoon character. You know what I mean...blurry circle spinning but the character not going anywhere and then their shape stretching out as they launch. I lit back down that hallway like a shot from a gun. Left the door open and the light on. Shot right past my mom in the kitchen. (when you were in the chair at the phone you back was exposed to the door to the hallway). I said nothing. I was moving like a house fly avoiding every obstacle that got in my way. Unbeknownst to me, my mother was hot on my heels. \n\nWe both crossed the 100 feet across the yard to our front porch like two escaped prisoners, never touching the ground. Once there she asked me what I saw. What I saw? How the french toast do you know I saw ANYTHING? She said that the day before, when she was alone in the house and on the phone something was knocking and tapping on the wall next to the phone. \n\nWhat we didn't know right that moment was that my father left work immediately. Apparently, her slamming the phone down in mid-sentence spooked HIM and he needed to get home. \n\nI don't remember who saw it first.. but one of us looked over at the back porch to hell-house and saw something. The other followed suit. This is what we saw: standing on the back porch was a solid blue figure of woman. No features, just a solid shape. She was wearing an \"old-timey\" dress, you know, the ones that are wide at the bottom, what looked like the shape of bonnet on her head and the shape of an umbrella over her that she was holding in her right hand. I pointed at it...I pointed and said that I just saw her and two men in the bathroom talking, but I could see them clearly. I could see their clothes and faces. I knew the sound of their voices and what their eyes looked like. \n\nWe stood there like two breathing statues in a staring contest with a blue, translucent woman who we could only assume was staring at us without eyes. There was 100 feet of open yard between the three of us. Just grass and fireant beds. But the tension, oh the tension was almost visible. I had opened the door. I left the door open. And now blue umbrella lady was NOT happy. I don't know how long we stood there locked in this surreal contest, but it was long enough for my father to get home. He got out the truck and was stomping his way to the porch saying something that I don't recall. That was until he got at the correct angle to see what we were oogling at. \"What the (insert your favorite 4 letter word) is THAT?\", was all he could muster. \n\nThis was only the beginning of what turned out to be a years long battle. A battle of fear, anger, attacks. And guess what else we discovered! Mrs. Blue had friends. Lots of friends. And they did the old lady's bidding. Soon more than just the three of us were involved in this situation. \n\nSo now you know of my first encounter. This made little 7 year old me a believer. Unfortuantely, more was to follow. \n\nDo you want more? I fear that I have just rambled on and no one will see this through. I've told a select few some stories, but many think them fantasy. I assure you, everyone in these stories remember them vividly. Except my father. He's dead now.",

I named the 80 year old man Jerry and the teenager Nate. I feel like Nate has a bad background and I was thinking about him as I was getting the the shower. I said out loud, Nate you seem like a pervert and thought nothing of it. When I got the shower a bottle of shampoo fell of the edge of the bathtub. My shower and bathtub aren’t connected and there is no way I could have touched it. So yeah idk what’s going on.",

We looked around the mirror and couldn’t see anything. We could all smell it though. Over the years it would come and go. We’d often forget about it for a year and then it would come back and we’d be like “oh yeah that weird smell!” But we never figured out what was causing it. \n\nThere have been other smells since then too but can’t remember them as specifically.\n\nBut recently - the past couple of months, it’s gotten more intense.\n\nThe smell of onions cooking in the bathroom that came, stopped for a couple days, came back. It comes and goes every so often. \n\nI once came home late one night to the smell of something dying. It was so horrific. I assumed it was the bin because we eat a lot of garlic but this was different. It was the worst smell I’ve ever smelled. I guessed someone had fish and it mixed with something in the bin. I messaged the family group chat to deal with it (they were asleep and get up earlier than me) and went to bed. However my mum told me that when she woke up to check, there was no smell. No one had eaten anything that could even create a bad smell. \n\nI also experienced a weird smell recently that only me and my gran could smell but no one else. I’m blanking on the smell right now, I think it was tinned tuna? But again there was nothing to have caused the smell.\n\nThen today my dad told me that in the night around 1am, he woke to the smell of someone cooking roast dinner. My mum woke up (she’s a very light sleeper so he probably woke her) and said she could smell it too. But when my dad went down to investigate - nothing. The bin had just be emptied that evening before bed. No cause for the smell.\n\nI’m very much a skeptic when it comes to things supernatural, but I am always open minded. I believe anything is possible but I will always try and use logic to explain things first. But I can’t find any explanation here. \n\nHas anyone else experienced anything similar or does anyone have an answer to help us understand what’s going on?",

So loud. Like as if the speakers too it were in each and every room and throughout the hallway and Throughout the whole house. We then, hear my cousins yelling that the door bell is ringing and someone must be at the door. They were immediately afraid because this house is pretty far from town. Pretty much the middle of nowhere is how you would probably describe it. I was immediately frightened and so was my auntie because I DO NOT have a doorbell. She knows this. Even all the years my gma lived in the house I’ve never heard a doorbell. It has never worked. I’ve talked to several other family members who have lived and been in the house often and they agree. There has never been a doorbell as long as anyone can remember. I have now had the “doorbell” go off 2 more times. Once I was completely alone and once I was with my mom only. I don’t know what to do. I searched for a box and there is an old door bell button on the outside of my front door but, that’s all I can find and when I pressed it, it doesn’t work. I took it off completely and there wasn’t even like any wiring too it?? Idk. I’m scared, and just hoping there’s a logical explanation. Lmk what y’all think.",

        "text": " \n\nFor some context I have been friends with my friend (Let's call him Leo) since diapers. Our families have know each other since they were in high school and therefore Leo and I grew close. Unfortunately Leo's parents died when he was 5 and he had to move to Montana with his grandpa Tom (It's not his real name but everyone at the reservation calls him that). Ever since then I try to visit him whenever I can and sometimes he comes visit me.\n\nThis year I went to visit him everything was chill for the first 3 days, we played video games, went to town, and generally just hanged around. Now something that should be noted is that Grandpa Tom has always told us to never ever go into the forest near their house during the night time. Whenever we asked why he would simply reply that it would be dangerous to do so because we could get lost or attacked by an animal. Now I knew that what Grandpa Tom said was probably true, but someone from town had told me that those woods were said to be haunted because years ago a witch had sacrificed 3 people in the name of Satan and then committed suicide after the townspeople hung her son as an act of revenge. It is said that if you go far enough into the forest you can find a giant pentagram on a stone altar and that if you get close enough you could potentially be cursed.\n\nIt was the 4th night and I was incredibly bored so Leo and I decided to play truth or dare, it was all going well until he dared me to go into the woods with him. I decided to go because after all I really love exploring potentially haunted sites and so together we snuck out of the house. The walk towards the forest was pretty normal until we went farther in and a sensed someone was watching us. I also felt an immense sense of danger, anger, and evil. I grabbed Leo's arm and said, \"Leo we have to get out of here it doesn't feel safe to go any further.\" He simply replied with, \"Oh are you sacred?\" Something seemed off about Leo, his expression was blank. I usually don't scare easily because I've experienced paranormal stuff my whole life, but something was off about my best friend. It was almost as if he was possessed.\n\nI let go of his arm and as I was about to pull out my phone to call Grandpa Tom for help, Leo grabbed my arm with such an immense force and looked me in my eyes and said, \"That won't work no one can help you now.\" He then started laughing like a maniac and I struggled to get away from his tight grip. I was so scared and so I did what my mom always told me to do if someone tried to kidnap me, I kicked him on the nuts. That had seemed to startle him enough for him to loosen his grip and I was able to break free and run back towards Grandpa Tom's house. As I was running I heard Leo yelling profanities and suddenly he started running behind me, he seemed to be running with an inhuman like speed. In a blink of an eye he appeared in front of me, which seemed next to impossible. I was tired, but I was not about to let myself be killed in those wretched woods. I ran back towards where we had been when he attacked me and as I looked back he just stood there smiling.\n\nSomething was really off, but I kept running until I came across an altar with a pentagram on it. I thought that this was the infamous altar where the witch had done her sacrifices. That place radiated extreme evil, I wanted to get out of there, I wanted to help my friend, I just wanted to go back to the safety of home. I was so tired that I fell on my knees and started crying when all of a sudden I got an immense headache and nauseating feeling. There was a lady walking towards me she seemed nice and innocent, but I knew better because she was emanating evil and there was a smell of rotting flesh. I knew I had to get out of there, but I seemed to be frozen in place. I did the only thing I could think of which was praying (I'm an atheist, but I didn't know what else to do) I prayed and prayed for everything to be ok. I opened my eyes to see she was just standing looking at me while she held an unconscious Leo in her grip I just looked right back at her and prayed out loud. To this day I don't know why, but I started praying in Latin and then in Italian (I know this languages it was just weird).\n\nThe more I prayed the angrier she got, the angrier she got the louder I prayed. Suddenly a gunshot rang out of nowhere, the witch turned around startled but I just resumed my praying. She turned to look back at me and with the raspiest voice ever she said, \"I just wanted more souls for my collection I guess I'll have to claim other ones. Either way your soul seems to belong to someone else.\" I got chills all over when she said that. She just dropped Leo and slowly disappeared into the night. I ran towards his unconscious body and tried waking him up. He wouldn't wake up I cried and screamed his name, but it was no use I thought he was dead. I cradled my best friend while I cried and sobbed, I thought I would die too because it was extremely cold. All my hope was lost when by some miracle I heard Grandpa Tom yelling our names. I yelled back and he ran towards us, the rest of the night went by like a breeze. Grandpa Tom took us to the hospital Leo was thankfully fine. You all may not believe me, but I swear that I will never go back to those woods again.",

        "text": "Everything began when I was four, the house that I lived in (my aunt's house) wasn't by any means haunted it was more like I was the one who was haunted. It was around 7 p.m. and everyone was in the kitchen and all the lights had been turned off except of course the kitchen light. I grew bored so I decided to go play with my toy cars out in the living room, but l didn't turn on any lights because there was enough light emanating from the kitchen. I suddenly feel like someone is staring at me, but I just ignore it and continue playing.\n\nA couple of minutes later I needed to use the bathroom and to do so I had to walk though a hallway which seemed to be darker than usual. I was about to turn on the light when a decrepit looking hand shoots out from the hallway frame, hold up its index finger, and wagged it (as in saying no). At that moment I didn't feel scared so I get a bit closer and turn on the light. When I do so I see a demon like face, I lock eyes with it, and it slowly puts its finger to its mouth in a sushing motion. It was only then when a wave of panic hit me and I ran towards to the kitchen screaming, but when my aunt went to check along with my cousins they said saw nothing. From that point forward paranormal things happen to me no matter where I am.\n\nI don't know who this demon is or where it came from. I don't know why it has attached itself to me. I have been told that it might have gotten attached because of all the negativity that I have experienced at such a young age. No one may believe this story, but if you do please send your thoughts and opinions on what I should do.",

My gf was woken up by me mumbling about God etc. Last night I did not dream to my memory but woke her up by loudly trying to say Yeshua or Joshua a few times.

        "text": "When I was younger, I lived in some low income apartments. My cousin lived there also. Right next to it was a huge wooded area. The farthest I went into the woods was probably 2 miles but nothing was out there except a few deer. \n\nMy cousin, myself and the kids that lived there use to play a modified game of tag. We called zombie. Basically whoever was it had the touch and whoever got caught became the zombie also. With 30+ kids living there, it was also 30+v1 and whoever won got a candy bar. Nothing was out of bounds except going inside and going to to deep into the woods. \n\nThis day was like every other \"Zombie\" game. Some other kid was it, I remember I eventually got caught. I knew my cousin wasn't caught yet and i knew one of his few hiding spots. This day he and both were wearing a yellow shirt and he was the only one wearing one like mine. \n\nOne of his sneakiest hiding spots was in a ditch but this ditch had over hang made of dirt. If you ran parallel to it, you couldn't see him. If you ran behind the ditch at a certain angle you could see him. This ditch was right next to the apartments and it was dark. I saw his yellow shirt crouched and got behind him and told him got you. \n\nHe didn't respond. He just motionless and stayed looking  forward. I was going to push him but felt scared for some reason. I said \"fine sore loser\" got up and left. I kid you not 30 seconds later, I see half the \"zombies\" chasing him but on the complete side of the apartment. I immediately didn't say anything but after the game I asked if he hid in his spot and he said no. That people caught on to him so he didn't hide there. \n\nI didn't know what to think so I kept it to myself until I read a story about doppelgangers. The weirdest thing and the biggest question I have is what if I saw my own doppelganger. Me and cousin look relatively similar under circumstances. He and I both have dark hair with fair skin, same height, same weight. I think they scares me more",

So I'm really good at coming out of mine. I can come out of it instantly 90% of the time. And I have never had anything weird happen outside of SP, everything weird/paranormal seeming only happens during my SP. Well this morning I was in one of the longest episodes iv probably ever had, I kept trying to come out of it but it felt like a hand was holding my head down hard on my pillow. Struggled and struggled for so long I begin to wonder if I was going to be stuck like this forever it was very terrifying. I finally come out of it gasping and my heart hammering in my chest so after I sit up from coming out of it I lay back down on my back to get my heart rate back to normal and try to get my breathing under control. That's when I heard a creaking sound. I have a cell phone holder connected to my headboard cuz I watch movies on my phone and I also  use it to hang my necklaces on. So there's 2 necklaces on there and my copper pendulum my friend gave me last week. I look over at my phone holder and the pendulum is swinging so hard it's shaking my whole phone holder. The pendulum is pretty heavy. My necklaces were not swinging at all . It was swinging so hard I thought my phone holder was gonna come off my headboard. I freak out and run towards the door and sitting there watching it a whole minute goes by and it's still swinging so I'm shaking and crying at this point. I grabbed my phone off the bed and started to record it. After I start recording it starts to slow down but then starts changing weird directions swinging east to west then south to north then it starts swinging in a circle. I would post the video but I can't figure out how to post without the audio. While recording I was crying and hyperventilating and it sound to cringy to myself so I don't want other people hearing it lol. Wish I could post without the audio. I showed my boyfriend and it freaked him out. I thought this was just a mental thing with my brain, nothing paranormal. When I first had mine I thought it was paranormal but after research and someone explaining what it was years ago I understood it was just a mental malfunction. But now I don't think so. Not the episode I had this morning anyway. The episode I had this morning made me feel weird and I felt weird for over 6 hours after it happened. Iv had major anxiety trouble breathing and it almost felt like a veil over my brain, my head was really foggy. That's why I started to record it cuz I wanted to make sure I didn't have something mentally wrong.",

Each time I would wake up from my scream and partner freaking out. I’d tell them there had been someone standing over me, a dark threatening shape. It was as if I was dreaming it but would always feel so real. \n\nAfter this I would immediately go back to sleep, completely over it and in the morning my boyfriends would be like “wtf AGAIN last night!?” This would occur at my house and boyfriends’ apartments. \n\nI have been on antidepressants for over 20 years and during this time I was not taking anything new or doing any drugs out of the ordinary. As far as I could tell, there was no new or different substance or situation that could have provoked any chemical adjustment in my brain at night. \n\nAt some point this happened to me while I was alone at my home and I STAYED awake, very shaken up. It was like all of the sudden the gravity of this repeated pattern hit me. I researched it for weeks, talked about it- could not figure out what it was. \n\nAnd the strangest part- it literally never happened again. Not once!\n\nSome people suggested I was in an astral projection or something…not sure how that works. Or a shadow man was visiting me. I just can’t figure out why it would completely cease once I truly consciously was aware how strange it was and was basically wanting it to happen again to continue investigating.\n\nAny idea what this could have been or what I could do to perhaps get more clarity?\n\n( I have not had close relatives pass so I’m not considering that, especially because this presence always made me feel scared and unsafe. I’ve always been afraid of the dark and suffered from horrible insomnia but I rarely get so spooked that I’m having nightmares. )\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "I was telling this story to someone today, so I thought I might share it. \n\nThis happened about 10 years ago. I was barely 20 years old. I lived in Massachusetts.  I was driving to my college at the time, and this particular day was very snowy, icy and sleeting. I don’t know why school was in session, but in the northeast they don’t take bad weather very seriously. I think we’ve all seen the memes of cars with piles of snow on them saying they’re heading to work.\n\nSo anyway. I’m driving to school and I was late. The road of which I was driving on was a 2 lane highway that was very steep. Between the two lanes were jersey barriers, and the opposite flow of traffic was on the other side. Like many roads in MA there are no shoulders, and there was no turn arounds. Once you were on this high way you had to drive another 5 miles before you could pull off to an exit. It was the type of highway where if your car stopped you were screwed because there’s nowhere to pull\noff (again lack of shoulders/grass. Just concrete barriers on both sides and the middle). It was a dangerous highway that many people had died on, even a friend of my moms coworker died on it.\n\nI was driving pretty fast for the type of weather I was in. I was in the far left and could see a tractor trailer in the far right but behind my car. Suddenly my car fishtailed and I spun out completely. I was suddenly in the far right lane FACING oncoming traffic. The tractor trailer was coming at me. Like COMING at me. There was no time or place to go. I remember this feeling came over me like my brain didn’t register what was happening, and suddenly out of nowhere my car was in reverse and I was in a miracle of a small shoulder (but still facing oncoming traffic). I don’t know how it happened and I remember being in shock how I did that. The tractor trailer blew by me in seconds. I mean I was literal toast if I didn’t get into that shoulder. Breathing heavily and saying to myself “did I really just do that?”\n\nWithin what must have been 10 seconds, I hear a few knocks on my driver window. I open it and a young male police officer is staring right at me. He then says “Hey! I saw your car spin out!” I see the lights behind now and his car parked right behind me in the same small squeeze of a shoulder we had (that ended very quickly up ahead). Clearly seeing me in what probably looked like shock, he continued on “you were going too fast.” I said “I know…” and then he says in this nearly soft but direct tone “Stop rushing. You need… to relax. Okay?”.\n\nHe then says how he’s going to stop the traffic so that I can turn my car around in the proper direction and get back on the road. It’s fuzzy how he did it, but I just remember him stopping the flow. I turn my car around out of the shoulder (remember my car was facing the wrong direction so I wouldn’t have been able to even turn the car around to get back on this icy/sleet busy highway) and slowly pull it back into the proper direction I was supposed to be in. \n\nI continue on and look behind me. Normally you can see a cop pull out after you, see their lights on, or the car themselves if they turn it off etc. But all I saw were the cars that were waiting for me now driving. It’s weird to explain but this cop disappeared in seconds. I mean DISAPPEARED. Like I said, there was no where for this cop to go. The only turn around (the small cut out median cops tend to use to go in different directions) wasn’t for another mile ahead, and the first exit off wasn’t for another 5 miles. The small little shoulder ended right after where I was, and this cop was no where to be seen. It was so weird, I remember looking back several times in my mirror and saying “Where did he go? What?”\n\nIt was so odd I thought about it all day. I came home and told my parents what happened. Of course in shock that my car spun out in the opposite direction and I almost hit a tractor trailer, I told them exactly where this took place, how my car went into reverse and I have no recollection of it and the magical cop that showed up in 10 seconds and disappeared as fast. My own parents thought it was the strangest thing. I’ve told this story to a few people who have also called it weird.\n\nI think (and my parents agreed) either that cop was sent by God at the exact moment I needed help or he wasn’t really a cop at all. It’s been a decade and I still think about this encounter. Without that man, I wouldn’t have been able to get back on the highway without taking a risk or I would have sat there in confusion and shock with the possibility of someone hitting me while snow, ice and sleet fell on my car. It was a very peculiar and life saving encounter I won’t forget.",

        "text": "This is a very recent occurrence that I went through over the last couple of months. I will be leaving out personal details about those involved of course.\n\nI think it's important that I also preface this story by stating that I'm always looking for a scientific, logical explanation to anything weird I encounter but this had me scared beyond reason and I have a hard time finding any explanation.\n\nI work as a care provider and help run homes of folks we care for. One client I worked with was a man in his 50's. However his health was declining to the point that most people assumed he was in his late 70s or 80s (this is relevant). \n\nWhenever I went into his home, I got \"uncomfortable vibes\". I would always feel extremely depressed, anxious, and uncomfortable when I was there. I work with a lot of different people all over the city I live, in and out of all kinds of homes and I only ever got this kind of vibe once before, and that was years ago, but it never felt this bad. It made the home feel oppressive whenever I was there. I hated being there by myself because of it.\n\nSo a few months ago I started realizing that I was remembering the vibe felt familiar from the other home from years before. As I sat in the kitchen on my laptop one afternoon, I started doing some research on the property to see if I could find any information on it's history. Nothing unusual for it, just an older building from what I could find. I also started texting my sister if she ever got that uncomfortable vibe in the other house I mentioned earlier because she had also worked there as well.\n\nSo once I started texting and narrowing my internet search and see if I could find any information on if anyone had ever passed away (or worse) in the home, it was like house knew what I was doing. \n\nThe air became heavy, all of the normal humming of the electric appliances amped up to an uncomfortably loud buzz and I had to cover my ears because I felt like they were going to pop from the pressure change. The lights overhead got brighter and buzzed as well. I immediately shut my laptop and left the room. \n\nI told my sister I would have to get back to her because I was done with even thinking about this as to not agitate whatever took notice.\n\nFast forward a couple months, nothing else major happened like that but I was still always uncomfortable. My client's health continued to decline until earlier this year when he eventually had to go into more intensive care. I came back one day to gather some things for him and paperwork. It was a quick in and out visit. As I went to exit and shut the door, I could see across the main room into the kitchen where it looked like a dark silhouetted figure just ducked out of site. I know I was completely alone in that house. I immediately shut the door and left without looking behind me. \n\nI don't know what it was that I experienced there but it felt like I wasn't supposed to take notice of whatever was there. The scariest part about all of this is that I think it was feeding off of my client's \"lifeforce\" since he moved in a few years prior and caused rapid aging and decline in health. I'm not going to share anything specific about him but it was strange how relatively young he actually was given his physical condition and appearance.",

I thought she couldn't hear me since she sometimes blasts music while cleaning so I unlocked the door. As soon as I walked in I got a phone call from my mom saying she would be home in 10 minutes and that's when I realised who ever I saw was not my mom. To make it even worse I was home alone since my older brothers where still in school at the time. We had only lived there for about a year or two when that occurred. (Also the person I saw was very tall which should've been the first red flag since my mom is short but I was like 9 or 10 at the time so I didn't really think much of it.)  I don't know if I ever told my mom about it but more weird things have happened since then.",

Just the other day, a folded-up chair that was against the wall tipped over on its own while I was down there which is strange because there has never been anything moving on its own in my house and I never thought my house was haunted until I started to realize that there are footsteps in my basement and also when that chair fell over on its own. I want to hear your opinion on this. I've been living in this house my whole life, the noises have always been there but only an object moving on its own is recent.",

        "text": "I have a pretty good collection of unusual, possibly paranormal, experiences that have occurred over the years and I thought they would be fun to share. I’ve never been entirely convinced that any of these experiences are confirmation of the existence of ghosts or supernatural beings (I’ve never witnessed an apparition or ghost with my own eyes) but they were all real and certainly have made me reconsider the possibility. \n\nEvent 1: This happened when I was eleven. My cousin’s dad passed away in Spring of 2011 when he was just a year older than me. I had gotta really interested in reading books that year, and one night when I was in my bedroom alone, I began to read a book about “true scary stories from each state in the U.S.” or something to that effect. Something that I read in one of the chapters of the book scared me, so I stopped reading and decided to turn on the TV. As soon as I did, the obituary paper that I kept in my room for my cousin’s dad flew off the shelf above my bed and landed on my mattress (IIRC). \n\nEvent(s) 2: I had a streak of odd experiences in Spring 2016. I once woke up to being violently shoved against my mattress and hearing roaring in my ear. It was frightening, but I didn’t make much of it as I wasn’t entirely sure if I was awake when it happened. I’ve historically been prone to sleep paralysis too, so I kind of shrugged it off as a hallucination. In April of that year, I had a vivid dream about sleeping on the floor of my grandma’s basement den. I lived at my grandma’s house at the time, but I slept in an upstairs bedroom. In this dream, the basement den was dimly lit and I was sleeping on the floor alone. I soon realized that I wasn’t alone, and I looked over to the other side of my room and saw my grandpa. In that same week, my dad announced on Facebook that it was my grandpa’s birthday. He also died on the week of his birthday 12 years earlier. \n\nFast forward to the end of 2019, and I am telling my dad about this story. My dad moved into the basement den after becoming unemployed. He told me that the last several years of my grandpa’s marriage to my grandma were spent with him sleeping in the basement den. \n\nEvent(s) 3: I lived in an apartment on the east side of Salt Lake City from 2019-2021. The apartment was fairly old (from the 1970s), and my brother (who was my roommate) and I had a bunch of unexplainable events happen. \n\nI had several odd dreams, including dreams of the same apartment in a different time period with different residents, a dream where an occult vendor was selling possessed items and I notice creepy looking possessed mask that ended up on the inside of my bedroom door without me having bought it, and dreams of unknown beings and entities invading my house but I’m the only one who notices them (I have more dreams that I can add in the comments too). \n\nI also woke up to heavy breathing in front of my face one morning (similar to roaring experience) and my brother (who is skeptical and has never had much interest in the paranormal) swears that he saw a gray mist or vapor in the shape of a man walking across his bedroom floor in the middle of the night. \n\nMy brother and I later moved into another old apartment from the 1970s for a year between 2021-2022 and as soon as we left the previous one, all unusual activity ceased besides one sleep paralysis event and a couple of weird dreams.\n\nEvent 4: Last year, I moved back in with my grandma to help save money on rent while I finish up my degree. In summer, I woke up to the voice of a child telling me “don’t wake up…” This was clearly a child’s voice despite the fact that a child does not live with us. My grandma is also the first owner of the house. \n\nEvent(s) 5: My brother passed away in fall 2016. Since then, I’ve had several dreams of him, all of which follow a similar pattern. I’ll usually see him and say something along the lines of “where have you been? I haven’t seen you in a while.” He usually responds in confusion saying, “what are you talking about? I’ve been here the whole time.” Last Saturday was the most recent dream I had of him. My dad and I had a heart to heart talk about my brother, and I dreamt of him the same night (prompting this post). Nothing much happened in this dream other than me asking him if he was proud of me. I don’t remember how he responded.",

That house has 2 doors, the main one and the back one (the back door has a very characteristic sound when opening). One night around 2 A.M I was playing some videogames, in a room that is about 10 meters from my grandparents' room. I heard the back door opening and closing exactly like when someone enters the house, including that characteristic sound I was talking about. Then I heard very noticeable steps heading towards the living room (central part of the house) so I opened my room door and i havent seen anyone, I check if it was my grandparents but they were both in their room sleeping and it couldn't be anyone else because it was very late and there was no one else in the house. I remember how my heart was pounding I got very nervous at that moment. This was my only paranormal experience that I remember. When I tell the story, people don't usually believe me but if it's worth anything, I swear on my entire bloodline and my life that I remember it that way. As an additional detail, Im 19 years old and i was like 17 or 16 when that happend. Srry if this text is wrong, im spanish.",

The second morning there I woke up and my blinds strings were tied in a weird way, all looped in the same way, my son was not even two and could not reach, let alone tie knots. At this point I was wondering if maintenance had played a prank bc they had a key, no one had been invited to my house or knew where it was. The next day I woke up and there were clothes hangers on everything, anywhere they could possibly be hung, every tack on my wall and every random thing had hanger on it. \nMy food was the same in my fridge except it was all opposite like a mirror image of how I had actually placed it, which really messed with my head. \nTwo weeks later I woke up and I was already running outside into the street, I don’t know why. There was this sound, it was so loud, like metal screeching and a continuous siren, just pure loudness but as soon as I reached the street it stopped and I didn’t know why I was out there and I can’t imagine what could have made it, it’s not the kind of area where something like that has an easy explanation of just city sounds \n\nThe hallway upstairs and the stairs became the main creep zone, just feeling watched. Lights on that I just turned off. \n\nEvery time I got to the middle of the stairs my eyes would twitch and things would go black for a second, or my body would uncontrollably lurch, or I woudl feel a push and I had to try not to fall. I would be on the edge of sleep and my whole body would jolt and I’d have the image of falling.\nI had lived there a few months, my son was doing arts and crafts with me in one bedroom, my infant daughter was sleeping in the bedroom across the hall. I shut the door to the room I was to keep her from hearing my son and waking up. I had a thought enter my head that it would really suck if I couldn’t open the door to get to her, so I went to open it and it would not open for anything. Then my baby started crying like someone was messing with her \nI called for people to come help me and as soon as someone arrived the door was able to open and I looked dumb. My downstairs doors and windows were locked still when I got out of my room.\nI gradually had more and more sleep paralysis until it was every night. It was never like when you have a specific entity or sense of presence, it was just crazy sounds and colors.\nI’d have dreams that if I walked up my stairs they’d be filled with a cloud of tv static and it woudl be hard to to pass though it and you would become disoriented \nOne night I was astral projecting through my house and the air in my house was little lines like I was in an old tv. I saw something like a gargoyle sitting on my stove . I just went back to myself because it felt too weird.\nI struggled with astral travel in that place, every time I tried I could only crawl the floor sideways , I could never stand up or leave my room with out feeling like a strong rubber band was snapping me back to my body and I couldn’t see far around me, just blackness \nOne the last nights I lived there, it was about 530 in the morning, we were all sleeping on the the living room floor, I entered semiconscious sleep paralysis and could see the room, it just looked normal but I began to hear every sound that had ever happened in the house while I lived there, laughter, arguments, everything layered and louder and louder until it stopped and I heard this long evil laugh. I stopped having  sleep paralysis after I left that place",

        "text": "I came from a Christian family, well dad’s side is Christian, and culturally, my mom (whose family was Buddhist) had to convert to her husband’s religion. And this story was  kept a secret from me for around 3 years\nLong story short, army dad found this Buddhist medium/fortune-teller and he was able to pin point our house without knowing us beforehand, knew things about our family members, and interestingly, he said my mother was being followed by 2 ghosts. they were the reason why she kept getting sick, hence why she needed a cleanse\nMy dad, who was skeptical, confronted another medium who was referred to by his friend, and he said the same thing about my mother being followed. However this guy’s solution was a-lot more obnoxious and costly.\nMy dad took my mom to see the first medium, but he let my mom go in alone to confirm if the medium will tell her the same thing. He did, and creepy enough, the medium told my mom “you did not come in here alone, there’s a spirit waiting for you at the door, he can’t come in because this is a holy place”\nMy parents eventually asked him to do the cleanse. During the not-so-Christian ritual, (according to my dad, who is a non-believer of this spiritual thing) my mom  was possessed by 2 different spirits, one of a child who kept crying, said that they didn’t want my parents to have kids (interesting enough, my mom infact cannot have more kids due to some problem with her reproductive system); and one of a middle aged man who had a crush on my mom since she was in highschool and he had been following her since, supposedly he hated my dad and wanted to hurt him.\nThe medium managed to capture the spirits. \nIt has been roughly 8 or 9 years since this incident, my mom is still well but still sometime get sick randomly as usual. Personally, I’m not a full believer, not until I witness it myself, so I lean more on the theory of this ritual being a sort of hypnotization. Is that a possibility?\nAnd if the ghosts were real, would Christian priests’ exorcism work? Since the ritual was definitely not a Christian ritual\n\nI apologize for the long post, thank you for your time\nHave a nice day",

        "text": "\nThis is kind of long, but I have some questions about this experience would like some insight.  Anyway, a little back story - My family holds grudges. My grandfather (mom’s side) didn’t talk to his sister for upwards of 15-20 years before she died. I - being 20 barely remember meeting her once. Anyway- At a close family party, we were all talking and my aunt seemed weird from the moment that she walked in the door which isn’t completely out the normal but I digress. She finally started talking about how she woke up in the middle of the night to use the restroom and there in the mirror behind her was Helen (my grandfather’s sister) - to this my mom completely freaks out and starts rambling about how SHE saw Helen the same night in the mirror as my aunt. Now at this point there’s a lot of talking over eachother trying to see if their stories lined up. It lined up EXACTLY, basically: when they both walked into the bathroom in their respective rooms in their respective houses early in the morning around 2 am, went to wash their hands and saw Helen their fathers dead sister in the mirror behind them. I tried to get my mom to describe her face, but I don’t get much other than “It was definitely her”. Obviously freaked out at this, my mom thinks she’s hallucinating and at the same time she goes to turn off the sink - Helens face melts into her own and then she’s gone. Up until this conversation my mom think shes either gone completely insane or hallucinating as she works sometimes long hours, but talking to her about it she thought someone was going to die. Theres a theory in my family passed down that my grandfathers father had “witch” mannerisms. One of them being that anytime someone in the family died she would get three knocks on the door. And usually each member of my family has their own thing they can just “feel”.  I was there when they found out the other saw what they did it was the most pure, just “what the fuck?”  moment I’ve ever been apart of. We spent the rest of the night theorizing on what it meant that they both saw her on the SAME night, and she did the SAME thing. We came to the conclusion someone had to have died- we just didnt know who. Come to find out a week later - Helens husband Don dies from a heart attack. My entire family is freaked out. \n\nTLDR; Aunt and mom have the same experience late at night of their dead aunt who they hadn’t even seen in decades prior.\n\nQuestions;\n- Why do you think Helen visited THEM out of all people even though they didn’t even really know her the bette half of their lives?\n- What was the point of her doing it? \n- Do you think this is just some elaborate prank they’re trying to pull over us?",

The thing was, according to my relatives, they had all seen me talking to nobody the entire time, and they had the maid get me cause they were starting to get creeped out after a few hours. Now, at the time, I thought he was real since my family probably just missed him, but looking back, our maid would've seen me waving goodbye at him since she went to get me.

Then, I saw at the doorway, a large green amorphous \"bubble\" of sorts floating into the room toward us, similar to the way oil floats in water.  It was translucent, so I could see through it a bit, and it had a very crisply defined boundary, so my impression was not that it was smoke.  Then, a strong smell of sulfur started being noticeable to me.  The other child was looking down, when I asked her if she saw what I was looking at she said yes, and I asked her if she saw it before and she nodded yes to me, but then she looked down at her drawing.  After a couple minutes, it stopped moving and was just hovering in front of the bed where we were sitting, and I suddenly had the urge to touch it.  So, I got up, and slowly moved my finger to where I thought the boundary was, and it suddenly disappeared.  The room also seemed immediately warmer and I didn't smell the sulfurish scent anymore.  I've never spoken about this to anyone, but I am curious about interpretations any serious users might have.",

        "text": "So this is my 1st time really telling this story on line. I like many of you, I’m sure am a big skeptic. But I think maybe someone out there can let me know if this has happed to them? \n\nI was born in 1986 and grew up in Orange County CA to two immigrant parents from Patzcuaro Michoacán Mexico, in the 90’s. It was December 24th (Noche Buena) Mexican Christmas. I was excited to possibly see Santa Clause fly by outside my window. I looked out the kitchen window (we lived on the second floor of a duplex apt.) I rested my chin on base of the window frame. I could feel the cold and uncomfortable window frame rail on my chin. My older sister made fun of me and kept telling me to “get away from the window, Santa would know if I was watching and wouldn’t come.” I looked up at the night sky and shrugged her off.\n\nThe night was moonless but bright (so possible the moon just just out of my view) no clouds and no planes. Suddenly just the the right of a telephone pole was a spherical silver (liquid silver looking) object, silently hovering towards the top of the pole. The object was big about the size of two 12 passenger vans. \n\nI was in disbelief it could only mean one thing. “It’s Santa!” I yelled hoping my sister would react and run to the window but she didn’t she laughed and said “nice try” I turned my head towards her (behind me, she walked away from the kitchen and into the living room) I didn’t care I quickly turned back to face out the window and saw nothing..it was gone, Santa was gone it happens so fast and I heard nothing, not a swoosh or a bell or anything. \n\nDisappointed I went to bed and woke up on December 25th American Christmas and saw my parents already awake having some coffee. My dad gave me a big square box. The box was heavy and had some ugly glitter Christmas wrapping paper around it. I tore them open and saw they were a pair of roller blades. I was so exited to finally have my own pair, I had learned to skate from a school friend next door and he was getting tired of letting me borrow them, so I asked for some on my Christmas list. Eager to try them out I ate my breakfast in a hurry and I asked for permission to go down stairs and break them in around the block. My mom said “yes, but take your little brother.” So I rushed him (he had a bike and was not as fast on it so the plan was to ditch him and speed off) \n\nAs my brother got his shoes on, I was already wearing my rollerblades. My mom was upset and said “no rollerblades in the house! And watch yourself going down the stairs hold onto the railing.” Little did she know, I had been wearing rollerblades in the house and up and down those stairs all summer and nothing happened to me. But I nodded “yes mom” \n\nI opened the front door and gripped the cold metal railing on the staircase. I carefully walked down each step until I made it to the bottom safely. I don’t know why, but I wanted to see what everything looked like upside down since my rollerblades made me feel tall, so I lowered my head between my legs in a standing position, and I could see the sidewalk in front of my apartment building in an obvious upside down position, but suddenly, as I stood back up in an upright position again, the morning had turned to sundown, and suddenly my little brother was behind me on his bike, and he looked worried and upset. He yelled at me “Where have you been? We’ve been looking everywhere for you! Mom was about to call the police!”  I laughed and said “how did you get down before me?” Suddenly other neighborhood kids started pulling up on their bikes and asked me the same question and my mom came rushing out the top of the stairs demanding my brother and I come back inside.\n\nI was so baffled by everything that was going on, but I did as I was told, and I made my ascend back up the staircase. When I got inside my mom and some of the neighborhood moms were over, and they began to question me. “They asked me where I had been or with who?” I let them know I was with no one. “I had just got to the bottom of the staircase when suddenly, everyone went to berserk on me.” My mom looked at me and said “you’ve been gone for almost ten hours! Now tell me where you were!” I stated to cry not so much because I thought I was in trouble because I could see the worry in my mothers face. I ran to her and hugged her as tight as I could. “I didn’t go anywhere mom, I swear it’s only been a minute since I last saw you.” one of the older women in the neighborhood was over. She went over to my mom and put her hand over her shoulder and looked at her, and then she looked at me and said. “It’s all ok he is home now just let him go lay in his room for a while.” I lay in bed and thought  “ why is everyone lost their minds?” \n\nI never knew what happened to me that day. But as I got older and as the internet and Google became a thing, I started to search “missing time” and all sorts of stuff came up, some very disturbing abuse and others about inter dimensional travel but what stood out to me was alien abductions. All the accounts were eerily similar to mine. \n\nI’ll be 37 years old this year and I have yet to discover where I was for almost 10 hours all those  years ago. Is there a way for me to unlock this hidden memory? One thing I do know is true, wherever I was and for however long I was there, it changed me. I don’t know how to describe it but I feel different and I see differently… I guess that would explain all the stuff that came after… but that’s for another post…",

I'm honestly terrified and might never go outside at night again haha\n\nI was walking my dog (a black and white pittie/retriever mix) outside before putting him to bed around 11pm, it's very dark as there is a lot of wooded areas around my apartment complex. I usually walk him about half a mile or so out from the complex to a stop sign and light post at the end of the street, which borders on the woods. Usually there is nothing out of the ordinary, just woods and the normal animals like squirrels and the occasional deer. Sometimes there's that weird heavy feeling like something is watching you intently but I mostly ignore it and we cut our walk short and head home since a brief scan of the area shows nothing is there.\n\nTonight there was that heavy, watched feeling again but when I scanned the woods there was something there. A dog with glowing yellow eyes that looked exactly like my dog, down to the heart shaped white spot on his chest, standing just past the tree line staring directly at us. It looked like it could be his twin but there was just something off about it that invoked that feeling of \"run\". My dog definitely saw it too and was whining and staring at it hard. Usually my dog is reactive to other large dogs but he seemed more scared than anything else and wanted to get away, which is very abnormal behavior for him.\n\nAfter seeing it I fought that \"run\" feeling and walked quickly but casually back into the gated area and home without looking back but listening very hard for anything coming behind or to the sides of us. Instinctively it felt like the safe thing to do idk why. It seemed like it didn't follow but who knows. I do know that I will be skipping nighttime walks for a while that's for sure.\n\nAny ideas on what that might have been? Google was not much help.

        "text": "\nSo when I was very young a lot of my family members were into messing magic, ouji boards, some drugs here and there. They messed with some stuff they shouldn’t have and things got weird sometimes. I went through some traumatic things, not entirely related to that stuff, and I feel like it opened me up to things.\nAt some point my mother climbed through someone’s window to steal a specific mirror from someone over some kind of dispute, and she kept it in her house for many years. \nThrough my childhood I had a lot of encounters with really scary beings, sleep paralysis and issues. \nThings got worse and worse over the years. 14-17 were the worst.\nThrough those years I lived in various places with varied family members, but still had the experiences. I went through a lot of psychological evaluations but was only diagnosed with autism and adhd , ptsd, nothing that really explained what was going on. \nWhen I was 14/15 I started seeing and hearing something very evil, telling me terrible things, I would see shadows, black smoke, and a bird man demon like entity. I had awful insomnia and I was very troubled. \nA little boy who I had certainly never told or spoke about things in proximity to him because that would be messed up, I only saw him in passing a few times a week, but he drew me a picture of it! I was seriously freaked out.\nWhen I was 16 I had three separate people tell me they saw something following me. My brother would describe seeing black smoke creep into the room and press down on everyone or specific people. I was once asked to leave someone’s house upon entering because “you can’t  bring that in here I’m sorry” no explanation beyond that , just nope, bye. \n\nI lived in a separate building from my moms house, just out back for a while but ended up taking my sisters room for sleeping in and leaving all my possessions in my room. I got in the habit of saying to myself I was locking the monster in there whenever I left it and locked the door, and I got relief while I was in the house but if I slept in there I was tormented and my cat would wake me up terrified.\nThen we moved and I had to bring bring my things from my room and open it up , now I had my own room in the house, things got bad bad bad. It woudl not let me sleep, at all. My hair would be pulled, I would be scratched, covered In bruises. My blankets would be ripped off of me and I was pulled from my bed once. My older sister and her boyfriend also woke up with scratches and bruises. Every time I was near sleep it would not allow me, or I would have sleep paralysis. It was miserable for nearly a year, my health became very bad mentally and physically.\nMy aunt is still very into stuff, and has barriers to keep things out of her house, I would have to sleep there sometimes to get relief. \nWe had her come to the house and check things out, she did some cleansing/protective stuff, and instructed us to do something about that mirror. I’m not sure if it was the right thing to do, but we just went and chucked it into the woods and been fine ever since.",

        "text": "I'm quite new to reddit, so excuse any mistakes I make. Last night I was stupid enough to say 'If there is anyone here, I'll allow you to control my hands' I don't know why I did, but I know it was stupid. Anyways, a bit later I could feel my fingers on my right hand tingling, and then the feeling as if something was rubbing it. It definitely felt weird, and I wasn't sure if it was because I wasn't moving my arm or not. This continued until I put my arm down onto my bed, and tried to go to sleep (as I was about to before I decided to do this).   \n\n\nHowever, the tingling continued. Soon after, it felt as if something was weighing down on my hand, and as if something was trying to move my fingers. Of course, I had my eyes closed but it still felt like something was really trying to move them. When I moved them, this stopped. I then said 'You are no longer welcome to use my arm, please leave' and then my right ear started to ring. Very loud.  \n\n\nI soon fell asleep, as I kept moving my arm to try and stop this from happening again. However, I think that whatever it was (if it wasn't all just in my head) is still attached to my right arm. When I keep both my arms still, the right arm is the only one that starts to tingle. And my right hand, which might I say is my dominant, had more resistance than my left.   \n\n\nNow, this is only the stuff that I have noticed. I don't know if this is all in my head or what, but it's just very concerning to me. Haven't really had stuff like this happen before. If it is related to the paranormal, please let me know what I should do.",

I remember it happening several times and would wake my mom up in the middle of the night. It happened up until I was baptized because my parents were concerned and wanted to see if that would do anything, because my mom had similar experiences when she was young. I don’t know if it has anything to do with it but the house we lived in definitely had paranormal activity. So does anyone know what that could have been/mean? And has anyone else had something similar happen to them???",

I knew I had an active imagination and I used it well, but sometimes I would see things or experience things that I wasn’t imagining.\nWhen I was about 5 and my brother was 4, we were in the living room, playing at about 5-6 am, it was dark and quiet, just faint morning light. A car passed and illuminated our living room through the big glass door and we saw our own shadows, and a third shadow that there was just no way it was one of ours, it was roughly child sized but crouched, with the finger tips looking round like marbles, while we were standing, not crouching. It looked very evil and creepy to us at the time. \nI saw many weird things in the two years we lived there (5-7) and my mother had her own weird experiences, of a child climbing in her bed but then no one being there, she had a dream once of being man who lived in the house and murdered a child, it freaked her out a lot.\nI would often feel someone poking me in bed and find my brother solidly asleep.\nI would see strange, horrible creatures straight out of some hyronemous bosch (im sure I’m spelling it wrong lol) paintings but all very bird like, it baffled me and terrified me, plus lots of orbs and out of place nighttime puffs of smoke \nOnce I was on the toilet, (age5) and staring at the wood paneled wall just waiting to finish my doing my thing, and I noticed the pattern of the wood grain looked like a little man, and I as I stared it actually separated! And started walking toward me, ofc I flipped out and my mom came and it was just a regular wall again.\nAnother time my mom and her friends were  all sitting on the bed, drinking and playing cards and little me saw a long fat green tongue come from between the mattress and wall and no one believed me. \nThat’s some of milder weird stuff I saw as a kid",

        "text": "I’m a a man of science/astrophysics and I’m studying medicine and psychology/psychiatry. I do not believe in the paranormal, what so ever. I always think there’s a rational explanation.I’ve been on ghost hunts, at famous hunted locations where everyone “felt” something and they got a “ton of evidence” whilst I felt absolutely nothing, they even challenged me to stand alone in “the most hunted part of the location”  still felt nothing. I’ve challenged demons, ghosts, spirits on ouija boards. Where all the ones is was there with freaked out and left, and they said I’d be marked for life. I was there alone in the darkness, aaaaand felt nothing, no weird noises, no weird stuff happening or bad stuff happening I even  walked home alone in the completely dark and foggy forrest that night, and nothing happened. And this was a loooong time ago. \n\nIMO the human brain is responsible for these paranormal experiences, our brain is wired so that it already have a hard time understanding our surroundings in the first place. \n\nWe’re used to our senses giving us accurate information about the world. So when experiencing it our first instinct is usually to believe it. Have you ever felt your phone buzz, then checked to find there was no message? Have you heard someone calling your name when no one was there? Have you ever seen a face or figure in a dark shadow?\n\nThese misperceptions also count as hallucinations, says David Smailes. He’s a psychologist in England at Northumbria University in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. He thinks that just about everyone has such experiences. Most of us just ignore them. But some may turn to ghosts as the explanation.\n\n If you see or feel the presence of a loved one who died — and trust your perceptions — then “it has to be a ghost,” That’s easier to believe than the idea that your brain is lying to you.\n\nNot only are ghosts supposed to be able to do things that science says are impossible, such as turn invisible or pass through walls, but also scientists using reliable research methods have found zero evidence that ghosts exist. \n\nWhat are the believers of reddit thoughts on this?\n\nIM NOT IN ANY WAY DISRESPECTING SOMEONES BELIEVE NOR THERE STORYS!\n\nBut I’m open to the fact that maybe there is a paranormal we don’t understand, and I would very much like to hear your beliefs or experiences with the paranormal please 🙏🏽❣️\n\nIf you’ve read this far, have an amazing day!😌",

She could see the figures of people that never  passed on the other side left wandering around the world in an attemp to ease themselves. She told me that you cant see their faces but only their shadows although it has a set of rules going on when you encounter them for the sake of your sanity..\n\nNumber1. You never look straight at them for a long time .\n\nNumber 2. You don't invite them in NEVER.\n\nNumber 3 . They can't harm you .. only scare you (unless you invite them in your home thus the number 2)\n\nNumber 4. If it goes too far pray and everything will be fine.\n\nI never really believed her till I started to see shadows following me around..lurking around me and from times to times I would often see them in my dreams at my doorstep  trying to come in..they were mostly friendly figures but it didn't matter cause  you could always sense the evilness in their eyes . Then it got worse..\n\nI remember one night I was casually playing in my computer (assemble gamers of reddit) and I heard footsteps and screaming from outside , current time was 3 03 at night. \n\nAs i went on my balcony figures started to project on the wall, people running with wagons mostly crying,screaming in a language I didn't know and never heard of ,little kids falling and being pressed to death by the feet of others and torches in the air moving forward..\n\nIt was so loud that nearly bleed my ears , I checked the other apartments but no one was out and the road Infront of me was empty,u couldn't see anything In miles but still the figures where moving and the noise wa deafening . \nFor the first time in my life  I froze and felt that I couldn't move ,tears where streaming down my face and I could barely breath by the smell of the torches in the air .. \n\nI closed my eyes and prayed thus falling into the ground and hitting my ankle . Everything went silent and I went back inside trembling as the smell of the torch flattered my apartment and I could see visible smoke in the air..none of my family members had awaken tho or seem to locate my presence and I quietly went and covered myself in my blanket crying all night  till I fell asleep with the sun rising  \n\nThe following morning my grandma woke me up and informed me that it was my time to deliver the koliva and bread (spiritual food we cook for the dead in Greece.) cause it was an all souls day and my uncles where waiting for me to deliver . She asked if I had turn the fireplace on cause she smelled the fire and that I shouldn't light it at night cause it might burn the house if unattended..",

I had a lighter and wanted to see how much light it would make in a dark room (normal child stuff), so what I did was make the entire bathroom dark (like pitch black dark) and then go into my room to pick up the lighter, on my way back, as I was just in front of the door, I saw a tall black figure peeking from behind the half closed door, this was only for a few seconds because I immediately turned around and ran as fast as I could to my parents that were in the living room.  \nJust writing this sends chills down my spine and I was really scarred by it.\n2. **Bedroom**: I remember I couldn't sleep one night and was laying on the side looking at the door that was in front of me (this event was for sure after the bathroom one), I turned around a few times in bed, one time, while turning around to look at the door again, I thought to myself \"what if I'm going to see a black figure peeking at me like the bathroom one?\", once I turned around fully there it was, peeking from the door looking at me, however this time it was really short, I turned around immediately and tried to scream but couldn't, since flight or fight had kicked in and I was basically paralyzed I decided to turn around and try to fight it, but it was gone. Asking my dad about this in the morning he reassured me that it was him checking on me; but I didn't buy it because that shadow person was *wayyyyy* shorter than my dad (a medium height man). Thinking about this event now I think that it was part of my dream, it may have happened while I was about to fall asleep and I have read online that you can have hallucinations in that phase.\n3. **Door**: this is the one I'm less sure about as I currently am convinced that it is a false memory, because if it isn't I'm very scared for my mental health.  \nSo basically I was in my room drawing stuff, just finished watching some cartoon on TV that was something about hallucinations, and I looked at the door in my room (was wide open), then looked back on the paper I was drawing on and thought to myself \"what if I had an hallucination about that door being closed?\", then turned around to look at it and sure enough it was closed.  \nI do not believe in ghosts, so I think there are only 2 possibilities, schizophrenia or false memory.\n4. **Today**: Today I'm 15, suffering with social anxiety (also anxiety in general), paranoia and ADHD. They are self-diagnosed but I basically got all the symptoms of all of them so I guess I have them?...  \nI can find a reason for the anxiety and the paranoia taking it back to an incident happening at my elementary school (first or second year) where a teacher showed us a very gory video of seals being killed, I threw up in front of everyone in class and was very embarassed. I think that is the reason of my social anxiety mostly (for the paranoia I think it was because of watching some scary stuff). I cannot remember if this event was before or after the others, if it was before them then may it have increased my fears and anxiety to the point of having hallucinations?\n\nThere are more stories involving extremely weird dreams even getting to disturbing levels or me today seeing stuff for split seconds in the corner of my eye (even if I read that that's normal, especially for people like me who have myopia).\n\n**TL;DR** As a child I had some hallucinations about shadow people and doors (yes, doors), now today I do not have a good mental health.\n\n**NOTE** I don't think this is the right subreddit to post this on, but I couldn't find another one with enough people to actually get some help with this. If you know a better one, please redirect me to it. I don't actually think this is paranormal stuff but since I saw other people post experiences like this here I might as well.",
