What is the process for an individual to seek the help of an engineer to work on a project? I have a couple of ideas as a pure layman, but wouldn't be surprised if better solutions would be recommended by an engineer. How would IP rights or patent rights work out in this type of situation? Would they be shared by the individual (me) and the engineer, or land solely with the engineer?",

Would a manual battery work?\n\nSo the idea is, during the day excess energy drives a motor that lifts a weight, i'd imagine a 20 ton weight, with a large gear step down from the motor to the weight. This converts the electrical energy into the potential energy of the weight\n\nthis weight is then connected to a generator, so when the weight is lowered, it turns its potential energy back into electrical energy. Would this be at all possible in reality?",

        "text": "I'm looking for design considerations for the gymnastic equipment.  NOT the software device.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn my searches, I find lot of high school physics problems, some miniturized setups using marbles teaching conservation of energy.  I find papers on safety.  But find little information about how to design trampolines.  \n\nAt present cheap backyard trampolines sell for a few hundred dollars and consist of a tightly woven mat made of polypropylene, PET, or other synthetic.  Often the weave is aughmented with a stretchable material, or thestrucuture of the weave itself is elastic.  Frames are thin tubular galvanized steel.  Springs are short with 3-4.5\" of actual coils.  Padding over the springs are 1\" foam.\n\nAt the other end, the prices start at 12 grand, springs are 10\" long, usually made from piano wire.  Frames are heavier, padding is thicker.\n\nReally cheap tramps will cheap out on the galvanizing, frame weight, UV resistance of the plastic parts.\n\nIt seems to me that there is a market for a higher performing trampoline that doesn't cost the earth.\n\nHere's what I've found so far:\n\nA:  The \"Throw\" of a trampoline is the range of motion while the jumper is in contact with the mat.  Long throw trampolines exhibit lower g forces on the jumper, but require longer springs with a lower spring constant.\n\nB:  The average g force on a bounce is the ratio of the height above the mat to the the throw.  A 5 meter jump with a 1 meter throw has an average of 5 g's.  This is simple physics.  The maximum g force is considerably more than this, and gets complicated.\n\nC:  The restoring force is, I think, roughly proportional to the square of the displacement.  This means that you cannot model the bounce as simple harmonic motion when you get into useful bounces.\n\nD:  Typical springs have elastic limits of about 60%.  A 10 inch spring can extend to 16\" without suffering permanent distortion.\n\nE:  The largest cause of energy loss is air resistance of the mat.  Competition grade mats are at least 50% holes, and use a mesh instead of a fabric.\n\nF:  The second largest energy loss is residual motion of the mat once the jumper's feet leave it.  This is proportional to the mass of the mat.  A competition mat comes in at about 10 kg for  a 8 x 15 foot mat.\n\nG:  On inexpensive trampolines, the mat is made of stretchy material.  This reduces interference if you have multiple kids on the trampoline at once,but elastic fabrics have high hysteresis, and are a further energy drain.\n\nH:  Some trampoline frames (Acon, Alley Oop) use very heavy tubular steel for the frame.  Much heavier than even the olympic tramps.  I don't know why.\n\nSo on the face of it the following is needed:\n\nFor a given size jumping surface:\n\n* Larger frame to allow for longer springs.\n* Possibly a taller frame to allow for a longer throw without hitting the ground.  This could be done by excavating a crater under the tramp.\n* Longer better quality of spring.\n* A mat fabric with the air permeability of window screen, but strong enough to withstand a 200 pound jumper at 10g's",

I'm modelling a sledgehammer that strikes a steel bolt into the ground with the force of 600 newtons, in an effort to try and optimise the wooden handle to be as light as possible and still not break (0,9m handle, oval shape). And I tried to figure out the resulting force on the hammer.\n\nThis has proven to be more difficult than I thought, I used an elementary case of a cantilever with a force of 600N upwards on the edge to calculate the deflection. But that resulted in the wooden handle bending 3cm, which is unreasonable and about 10 times as much as hickory wood can bend without breaking.\n\nSo I modeled the hammer impact in ansys workbench on a surface made of steel, however I couldnt get the solution for resulting force for some reason.\n\nI feel like there is something I am missing, obviously I'm making a few assumptions in order to calculate this, but do you guys have any advice on how to go about it? How do I calculate how much of the 600N impact is absorbed by the material and how much goes back into the hammer?",

I feel like I’m not able to learn much because there’s no collaborative design process. When I’ve told my boss I’m feeling overwhelmed on a project because I’ve never designed anything like what I’m being assigned, the stock response is “well sometimes it’s harder to put more than one person on a project”, which is true to some extent , but I also feel like my work output is limited to my current knowledge.\n\nI’m feeling very isolated and questioning why I need to come to the office to not speak a word to anyone all day.

And then let’s say it needs to be pulled from its starting point of 4 feet in length to 12 feet to get all the way to 50 lbs in resistance. What happens if I fold it in half? I have been folding my bands in half in order to get a useable distance when doing overhead press, but not sure if that’s basically doubling my resistance. Thanks!",

Either way, I've tried.\n\nWheel Load is measured in both N and t and as far as I can tell is basically the same idea as axle load, i.e. how much weight an axle/wheel is supporting. It seems basically the same thing as static wheel load, [for which I have found a helpful diagram.](https://i.imgur.com/tYwGVOR.jpg) I have encountered this concept in the context of equivalent standard axles (ESAs) and damage law exponents (n).\n\nIn trying to extend ESAs to passenger cars, I have come across \"road load\" and \"road load curves\". [These appear only to be measured in N and an explanation I found said:](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/dyno-theory-chassis-dynamometer-road-load-equation-vibin-jacob)\n\n&gt;Road-load is the force imparted on a vehicle while driving at constant speed over a smooth level surface from sources such as tire rolling resistance, driveline losses, and aerodynamic drag. \n\nbut goes on to say:\n\n&gt;A dynamometer is used to simulate conditions of actual on-road operation. The dynamometer power absorber is adjusted so that the total \"force\" experienced by the vehicle is equivalent to the force measured on the road.\n\nAnd what catches my ignorant eye about that is \"the force measured on the road\".\n\nThus, I ask is there a relationship between \"road load\" and \"wheel load\"/\"axle load\"?\n\nAlso, not sure if this is civil or mechanical, but I've gone with mechanical for now.",
