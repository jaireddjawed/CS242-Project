        "text": "I will always remember this and its stuck with me to this day I wouldn’t say it hunts me but somewhat comforting in a weird way\n\nBefore I start my in counter I want to explain something first, my grandad on my dad side sadly passed away when he was only 13 and me growing up not who he was, all I knew he was in the Royal Navy other then that he was a mystery to me, at that point I never wanted to ask my dad, my uncles or my Nan about him, as my Nan never loved another man after his tragic passing.\n\nI remember when I was a young child round 4 or 5 at the time my Nan had a picture on her bedside table with herself and a few people with her in a bar somewhere, there was two men in the picture never really knowing which one was my grandad. \n\nNow on with the main story this happened in the 2012/2013 sometime that would make 17 or 18 at this encounter, me and my younger brother Dom age 12 or 13  went to our local cemetery it sounds morbid I know but we was up there in good intentions as we our older brother Lewis and great Uncle Tom buried up there and what we used to do is gain our respects to them both like cleaning the graves by removing the unwanted weeds or leaves that’s be covering the graves, soon after we have finished Dom wanted to go to the toilet and the graveyard luckily enough had had a toilet on the far side. As we approach I had a weird feeling or being watched or some sort Dom try’s opening the toilet door to our surprise it was locked it was rarely locked, at this he was desperate to go and our house was a solid 15/20 minutes away so I told him to pee round the back of the toilet block so no one could see him. then in the corner of my eye in good 10 meters I see this guy staring at me I turn to face him and it was like staring competition how we was going about it he kinda reminded me like my dad’s brother my uncle Andy but I knew it wasn’t for,\n1. he lived two towns away at the time.\n2.he would of come up to me and ask why in the graveyard. \n3.this guy wasn’t wearing glasses as my uncle has to wear otherwise he can’t see. So I turn to Dom and ask him what’s taking so long as I turned back where the guy was he was gone I questioned myself who was he and for a big guy he knows how to run, after that I didn’t question it I found it weird nonetheless. \n\nServal week’s later my brother wanted to ask my Nan about our mysterious grandad so I remembered him that if Nan doesn’t want to talk about him then just drop it, like I said before I didn’t want to upset our nan. So my brother goes and talk to my Nan I hear my brother call me so I go towards my nan bedroom as I walked in she was smiling and happy to show pictures of old pictures of herself and my dad and my uncles and then one court my eye and it was my grandad. That was the guy that was staring at me at the cemetery?",

        "text": " \n\nIn  2016 I lost someone to suicide and experienced very profound grief that  felt like part of me had died as well. In the first couple years after  they died, I would have vivid dreams of communication, but easily  explained this away because it made sense that it was created by my own  mind as a coping mechanism.\n\nSome  backstory: when I first met this person, on a very significant day in  our life together, a huge deer ran across an urban highway and we  communicated about how strange it was and that it \\*jokingly\\* must be  some kind of sign.\n\nLast night, I  was driving home on another densely trafficked urban highway and in the  middle of the highway was a deer casually walking across. Within about  30 seconds to 2 minutes (time was hard to judge) I experienced what can  only be described as \"a presence\" that was in all honestly terrifying.  Every hair on my body stood up, it felt like the air had been sucked  from the car, and I was very scared to look at the passenger seat next  to me (never did) because I could feel it from there. I was listening to  music on the radio and in hindsight either I tuned it out, or the music  completely stopped.  Within seconds, I internally heard (the same one  can \\*hear themselves think\\*) \"I have to go\" to which I said \"okay\" and  it was over.\n\nI am not a very  \"spiritual\" person, but this was unlike anything I've ever experienced  and I'm curious if anyone who believes in these things could help make  sense of it. I suppose I always assumed if a departed loved one happened  to show up for a bit it would feel more Casper the friendly ghost and  less the sixth sense. It also seems like this implies that for the last  six years he was not 'gone'/where is he going to? and am curious about  that as well.\n\nAny questions,  comments, emotional outbursts are greatly appreciated because I  currently feel like a crazy person, but am also very intrigued and  emotional about this experience.",

        "text": "So.... I always tend to sleep sideways. Never flat on my back but last night I fell asleep laying on my back. Last thing I remember doing was looking up at the ceiling, thinking about my past. My boyfriend was already asleep, his face turned in my direction. The table lamp was illuminating his skin.\n\nAll the sudden the room went very dim. The table lamp wasn't on anymore. My eyes frantically scanning the room. \n\nAnd there she was. It was hard to see it as first but after my vision adjusted, I saw her standing in the corner of our room. Hair dark as night. Face pale and disfigured. Her eyes piercing as my soul. Then her face started moving to side of her shoulder, could hear her neck cracking as she moved. Then she smiled, her teeth and eyes were bleeding. The room was so silent I could hear the dripping.\n\n\"Babe... wake up\"\n\nI turned my head to the side and there he was, still fast asleep. I kept saying to myself no no no this isn't real. This is a dream. Wake up Amy wake up. Wake up now goddammit!\n\nShe was still standing there. I was fighting myself. I couldn't wake up or move my body. I don't even remember falling asleep but it for sure had to be a dream. I knew it couldn't be real. I could feel myself trying to wake up, I could hear my inner voice telling me to open my eyes. \n\nThen the table lamp turned back on. I stood up right away thinking I was finally awake. My boyfriend woke up and asked what was wrong. I was hyperventilating while pointing to the corner of the room. Saying \"she's there. She's standing right there!!\"\n\nHe turned to look then he said \"Amy there's no one there\"\nBut I could still see her despise having the light back on and being able to move. \n\n\"Babe... I'm going crazy. I'm going fucking crazy. Help me. She's there. I see her standing there\" I kept repeating this over and over, rocking my body back and forth while having both hands on my head. \n\nThen all the sudden I felt my body being jerked awake. This time I knew for sure I was awake. I sat up on my bed. I saw that my boyfriend was still sleeping and the lamp still on but this time, she was gone. I wasn't shaking, or hyperventilating anymore. I was just.. very confused. Second guessing myself if I was really awake. I couldn't fall back asleep after that. Last thing I remember doing is going to my Spotify and playing 'Someone New by SEA, Laeland' on repeat. I placed my phone under my pillow and fell back asleep.\n\nMy boyfriend's work alarm went off a couple hours later. When he woke up I was telling him about a \"nightmare\" I had. When I was telling him I was hyperventilating and pointing to the corner of the room he said \"but Amy, you DID do that. You don't remember? I woke up. I was asking if you were ok\"\n\nI froze for a moment.. I couldn't understand. \n\n\"Theres no way. I saw a dark figure in the room. It was for sure a dream. I couldn't wake up. And when I thought I woke up I still saw her. I eventually woke up for real and put music on\"\n\nHe said \"but you WERE awake. I kept asking you if you were ok\"\n\nI was like you lying. There's no way. You have to be lying\n\n\"But I'm not lying\"\n\n.......\n\nI didn't ask anything more. But it's been bothering me all day.",

        "text": "I know I call these all hallucinations but they seem way too vivid and odd to be mere hallucinations.\n\nSince around age 6 I’ve seen felt and heard things that don’t make sense. I don’t know if it’s hallucinations from my anxiety or something else. I’ve never believed or researched much into the paranormal so I’ll be in your communities care. \n\nSo I’m gonna give three examples of these experiences. the worst part of these events are I could feel them with all my senses making them feel extremely realistic. The one thing I know for certain I’ve been completely unable to document them as I’ve tried recording it on my phone but when I played it back there was only my voice and not the others. \n\nThe most recent experience was while I was sitting in my room around 7:00 ish it was nighttime and I had my bedroom window open. All of a sudden I heard these gasping choking noises which were very clearly human noises no animal that’s around me can make anything remotely similar. It was brutal I was shocked for a second and immediately ran out into our backyard to see if there was someone in need of help but there was nothing. It was dead silent there was nothing there I looked for footprints or sign of struggle but all the grasses completely intact so nothing heavy could have possible walked through there especially if it was choking to death.\n\nAnother one happened around two years ago. I was staying in a rental house trying to go to bed when all of a sudden I felt in danger like something was watching me and I heard a female voice just say the name “Lauren” and then the word “calm”and nothing else it was a very clear voice as if someone ad said it directly to my face. After it stopped talking I felt fine again like whatever was watching me left. \n\nMy first encounter was the weirdest. I was having a sleepover with a friend and they had gone to take a shower since we had gotten out of the pool in my house late at nigh. I was alone in my room but all of a sudden I could hear things. I heard so many voices everywhere I could hear they were saying things but I couldn’t focus enough to pick out anything in specific. And then I noticed out of the corner of my eye something all black human like but there was nothing there like a shadow was standing watching me. And it got closer and closer and touched me and I could feel it’s grip. It touched my leg and I could feel it’s hand pushing down. It had no face just shadow if I didn’t feel it’s grip I think I would have always thought it was just a trick of the light but it’s grip felt so real like I couldn’t escape. My mom walked in a second after it touched my leg and it disappeared into thin air like nothing ever happened. My mom never saw it (maybe she couldn’t see it?), or at least she never said anything if she did. \n\nThese event are not the only ones at least once a month an event like this will happens. Sometimes it’s just a simple word, sometimes it’s the distinct feeling of something moving across my legs, and sometimes it’ll be hallucinations or long drawn out noises. But it’s there it hasn’t stopped even after I’ve already moved houses and schools (for unrelated reasons) and it hasn’t gone away as I’ve grown up. There does not appear to be one goal it always shows up in a shadow like form or at least comes from the shadows although visual hallucinations like that are rarer than all the other hallucinations. I only have a visual hallucination maybe once a year. Like I said earlier there doesn’t seem to be a goal, the words that I’ve heard have no correlation to each other and the shadow has never done anything bad, it just observes watching and watching and it scares me.\n\nIf anybody has similar experiences or has thoughts please tell me as I’ve become more and more paranoid and anxious over the years because of it’s watching.",

An unrelenting dread and overwhelming anxiety falls over me, I cannot shake it, and I know I have to leave at that point. Each time, as I’ve started to leave, whatever it is has charged quickly, coming much closer and essentially chasing me from where I’ve been. I refused to return to Eagle Lake after I experienced it the first time and chose to go to a pretty popular area near Cave Run. The same exact thing has happened more than once. I have not been able to shake the feeling. I have definitely been the only one in the area on both occasions and there have been no animals near — definitely not ones large enough to make the sounds I’ve heard. My girlfriend has been with me on each occasion and has heard and felt the same as me. \n\nIf anyone has seen, felt, heard anything — please, let me know.",

He went to grab his pistol to confront it, it took off. He said he got a glimpse of its face and the expression it had was like it was worried that it was seen.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/yoatw4/renovating_an_old_victorian_and_just_had_an/",
        "text": "Hey all,\n\nTL;DR at the bottom\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this! Quick not so fun disclaimer, this isn't some insane horror story with blood dripping down the walls or anything. Just an experience that really scared us with the only explanation being that we rocked the boat with a spirit in our home during renovations, and we want to know 1) if anyone else has experienced something similar during house renovations, and 2) how exactly to proceed (do we talk to him to let him know our intentions? have the house blessed? burn sage?)\n\nAnyway, the experience: we bought this Victorian (built circa 1896...yes we know we kind of signed up for this) 5/6 months ago and have been renovating it during the entire time we've owned it. Our renos were really just removing the things other owners have added over the years, leaving as much of the original home intact and making upgrades/fixing flooring, plumbing, electrical. You get the jist. This weekend was the first time we removed something original to the home: a wall in the back of the house that divided the kitchen/hallway to the other back part of the house where the person who built the home operated his pharmacy back in the early 1900's. We also removed drywall the exposed the original beadboard walls in the kithen (side note, we're SO excited about that - it's incredible history). \n\nAfter we were done for the weekend, my wife and I were in the living room eating dinner and talking about how excited we were about opening up the back of the house and how much better it flows. This was around 7pm, we locked up all the doors, closed windows. It was still in the house / outside. Basically, shit was quite except for us talking. \n\nMid-conversation, we heard a crash-like sound coming from the kitchen. Now, this creeped us out, but it was easy to assume that maybe we left a tool somewhere unstable and maybe it just shifted. I don't know, but I could have lived with explaining that away. \n\nThen, thirty seconds later of us just sitting in silence looking at each other, we hear a succession of crashes coming from the kitchen. I'm talking \"bang, crash, BANG BOOM.\" It literally sounded like someone was in our house right behind the wall where we were sitting, it was the ONLY explanation, it was that loud. We get up, I grab a guerilla bar ready to see someone in our home, but there was no one. Completely still. Nothing on the floor, nothing has noticably fallen. Nothing. \n\nIf it were a person, the only way they could have gone outside was through the kitchen door. The issue with that, was that it was locked with a deadbolt that can only be unlocked with the key; there's no inside locking mechanism. And like I said before, that was locked. There is also a back stairway that someone could have ran up. But they're very creaky and loud. If someone ran up them, we would have heard it. And after the crashing noises, there was silence. \n\nAnyway, we booked it after we scanned around and left for our families house (as planned; we're not living in the home yet as it's under construction). \n\nWe're convinced this was paranormal. Every option/way to debunk it doesn't make sense. It could have been keys from the plaster falling, but that hitting the floor sounds way different than what we heard. And it was far louder. Also, no other new debris could be found anywhere.\n\nTL;DR - loud crashing noises in house that are completely unexplainable after removing part of original home. What do we do now? I feel like since we changed something original to the house, that may have made the original owner upset (rightfully so too). Has anyone else ever had an experience like this after renovating their house? Next time we're there, would it make sense to just say outloud that we mean no harm, we understand your frustration. But we live here now and are just making a few changes, blah blah. Would that work? Do we get the place blessed?",

        "text": "I am going to simplify a bit to give you an idea of a timeline and focus on the actual events that took place. Everything is in order and I do not remember exact dates or times.\n\n- The experience begins on family vacation. I am in our camper alone on the couch. I hear 3 distinct knocks, but think nothing of it. That evening everyone is asleep, and I hear the same exact knocks in the same general area. The couch was also a pullout bed. This freaks me out a bit.\n\n- The following morning we are headed home from the beach. When we arrive home I decide to take a shower. During my shower, I hear the same exact knocks, and under my breath in a whisper I say \"do it again\", and that is immediately followed by 3 very rapid knocks.\n\n- From this point on I am totally freaked. Every day becomes a mental battle and at one point I even had to bring my younger brother in the room to sleep with me. I am convinced that some of the following interactions could've been caused by the stress my brain was put through.\n\n- I often heard the same 3 knocks in various locations; My neighborhood pool, and my best friend's house. I tried my best to always surround my self with others, and even enjoyed the comfort of being at school. This was very traumatic for me.\n\n- After a sleepover at my friend's house, I was picked up by my dad. As we are driving through the neighborhood, I look out the right side of my window to see a small female figure in a white dress. The figure is still on the sidewalk in front of the house, with their head down and hair drapped over. This was a Sunday, so it could've been a girl ready for church.\n\n- (Not sure this is in order) I often would experience things at my grandparents house. Mostly lights turning on or off by themselves. One day when I was sleeping over, the radio in the room turned on by itself. I have no explanation.\n\n- All my experiences ceased once I moved on from the house me and my family were staying in. I felt relief, but had also matured in my age. After this, I had hardened myself to the unknown and developed a response to anything unknown that I had expierenced. \n\n- In the new house, over the course of 2 years, I had experienced weird things. Again though, I was hardened. I experienced my pillows and blankets being stuffed under my sheets and random white crumbs spread evenly throughout my bed. No explanation.\n\n- To date, I no longer experience anything. Thank you for reading, any response is appreciated.",

There was nothing there, no birds or anything. The whole area was silent except my happy pup interacting with whatever it was she was playing with. When she was done, she picked the toy back up and carried it all the way back home with her.",

At the time I was 17 and I was going to a friend’s place to smoke weed at around 3:30-4am in the morning. I was walking in some back streets. If you know you know but it was those streets that are with the communism apartment blocks. There were barely any lights working on the street and I was walking alone. \n\nGoing around the cars on the “parkings” in front of the blocks I go past an alley. Girl probably around 8-10 standing in the middle of it with a ball in hands. As I passed I had to go back to see if I saw that right. I go up to her and ask her what she is doing out so late as any sane person would ask if they see a small child, in the middle of a back street alone. The girl just stares at me. I couldn’t really see her face as there were no lights and my vision didn’t go beyond my feet. I go down on my knee and ask her what her name is and where she lives. The girl continues to stare at me and says nothing. At this point I’m a bit annoyed and I figure she finds me scary as a lot of small children do when they see a barely functioning person with blood red eyes. I take my iphone 7 out of my pocket and turn on the flashlight. The girl is GONE. No sign of her. \n\nI figured I just hallucinated the whole thing since it happened to me a lot back then. I continued on my way to my friend’s. A couple of minutes later I started hearing footsteps behind me. I turned around and no one was there. I looked around me a bit but nothing. I once again continued and I started hearing whispers. I’m not talking about your average whispering. The whispers were clear as day but at the same time I barely understood them. I thought it was once again my imagination so I lowered myself on the ground and covered my ears. I used to get a lot of voices and stuff in my head due to some mental issues. When the whispers finally stopped I got up again and saw that behind me was the girl from before. Only this time I saw her face clearly. Her eyes were BLACK. Clear black. She had a vain covered mouth and was staring at me. She has a black dress and a pink jacket. She was holding the same ball from the first time I saw her. I looked at her for just a second but till dis day I remember it like it was last week. I barely ever remember stuff from when I’m high but this I remember 5 years later. \n\nI started crying and had a full on mental breakdown. I sat in the middle of road sat hugging my legs and refused to open my eyes for good 10 minutes until a lady and a man came that I’m guessing lived in the apartment block. I refused to move until about half an hour. At the end the cops were called and I spent the night at the police station till my step dad came and picked me up. \n\nIm almost completely sure that really happened and it wasn’t just my imagination. 2 months after that incident I was diagnosed with schizophrenia and autism so the only people who believe me are my boyfriend and my mom.",

        "text": "This is a story I found on a website and a book I found.\n\nSo there was this old woman named Kierra and she was in her late 60’s. Kierra lived in a home by herself, and she was divorced. Every few weeks, she noticed things were moved or misplaced. After some time, it happened slightly more frequent. It wasn’t much, maybe a book, or her glasses were moved slightly. She thought she was beginning to have short-term memory loss. So she went to her doctor, and after they talked and did some tests, the doctor said she was fine. \n\nAbout a month passed, then it happened more and more. Now at this point it was out of hand. She would get up to grab something in the kitchen or something like that. Basically she left the room for about a minute, and something moved across the room or table. She got a bit worried and eventually found some young investigators. They tried cameras, but no luck. So they had an idea, they put a small X with tape on different spots. They wrote down every item on each spot. They left the house for about 30 minutes. When they went back in, 2 out of 6 items were off of their X.\n\nThey thought they could get rid of whatever type of spirit it was, presumably a poltergeist, with a medium. It took a few days to find one, but eventually, the spirit left the house. But when they did the removal process, it was very aggressive and moved sharp objects or hard and heavy items. The old woman was very scared during this time, but was fine after. Although, she had to get rid of one of her most prized possessions because the spirit chose that item to anchor to during the removal. It was destroyed but Kierra was left alone.",

I was a baby when it happened and had to be exorcised. I was less than 6 months old at the time but I'll spare the details. What Im here for is answers about seeing spirits. I've only spoken to one person about this. I used to consider that I was schizophrenic but I've seen spirits and seen them cause things to physically happen and individuals react to these instances. Last month I had my most intense encounter though. Some spirits are difficult to comprehend when you see them and this one in particular was one of those but this time I had multiple blood vessels pop in both of my eyes by simply observing it more than a couple of minutes. I see spirits at least a few times a week or see them interacting with something physically and no two have looked the same. They typically are passing by or spacing out or staring at me until they see I noticed them. I don't have regular spiritual visitors and typically never see a spirit more than once.I haven't spoken to any professionals in this field but I'm afraid of being referred to a psychiatrist mistakenly. That's why I'm here anonymously to see if there are any others and how you live with it? I no longer get scared or anything from seeing them but like I said it's getting easier to see them and sometimes it hurts my eyes depending on the spirit. Also I typically see them easiest at night or in a meditative or relaxed state.",

        "text": "Some of you might think this is not real, and I don’t blame you. I sometimes think I’m just dreaming. Let me tell you what happened last summer. My friend and I went camping down to a lake near Wisconsin. I dare not say the name of this lake. Don’t ask me why.  \nSo, we were hiking down a lonesome trail. We talked and had fun. We were young and free. Nothing gain and nothing to lose. My friend found this flute-like object. We were mystified and dazzled by the intricate carvings. He pocketed the object, and so that was it. It looked old, so what’s the harm? I was so wrong to think that at that time. During our drive home, we kept hearing a drumming and a humming sound inside the car. Could it have been our tiredness? Or were we hearing things? This was my thought at that time. As soon I arrived at my house I saw an apparition of a man with a headband and beautiful ebony long hair. The language he spoke, I could not tell what it was. He was beckoning me to come to him, and I was tempted to go. Oh, boy, was I. I didn’t, though, for I was speechless. I thought I was dreaming, but I was not. Every year he comes on the same day telling me to go to him. Are you wondering what happened to my friend? He has been having the worst of luck since then. He split up with his girlfriend, and he lost many of his friends. He is going through so many other issues, but I am forbidden to say anything, for I do not want my dear friend to be embarrassed. I left wondering what am I suppose to do? Any suggestions would be appropriate?\n\nTL;DR\nMy friend and I went hiking, and the friend took a flute he found. So now there is an apparition of a man that seems to haunt us on the same day every year.",

My older sister (24f) after the event kept saying she could feel the presence of my grandpa and continue on about seeing figures around her house and being able to talk to him with the help of readings. I felt a little envious because i was never able to feel his presence or anything. My wife also into paranormal and spirituality is teaching me on how to get there. After months of feeling nothing, last week, weird things started happening continuously. Tuesday night at 3am me and my wife were sleeping and out of nowhere my google mini started playing a weird song that made us eery. It was 2000 hetrz (B6 plus 21 cents) and how i know this was because my spotify put it on recently played. I got up my bed and disconnected the google mini and went back to sleep thinking it was just a coincidence. Wednesday morning two things occurred. Every morning me and my wife go to the backyard and have our coffee and let the dogs out. As soon as i sat down 3 knocks occurred by my bathroom window and we got confused and my dogs kept looking at the window. I went inside to check if maybe my cat was inside the bathroom. All our doors were closed and my cat was in the couch sleeping. I ignored it thinking again it was a coincidence. Same day at night it was 11pm and i was about to lock my doors and turn off the lights my living room lights started flicking so i backed away to the kitchen and let it happen. I then continued to walk to the living room and it flickered again but this time i locked the back doors and kept staring until it stopped. After this i told my wife how this is really creeping me out since i have never experienced this. She told me how it’s only bothering me more than its bothering her that she has experienced this before and i need to ask it to leave me alone. Thursday night i was watching tv on the living room and it happened again, 3 knocks on the window facing the backyard. I got angry and walked to the backyard and i saw nothing. I got inside and now the kitchen lights are flickering. I’m not gonna lie i got super scared and speed walked to the bed and left everything on I didn’t care. Told my wife Friday morning and she looked up the 3 knocks meaning and lights flickering. Apparently it was saying that its a spirit warning me about a death. I got super eery and anxious. Nothing happened Friday but on Saturday i got a call from my Grandma (Widow of my Grandpa) that my Great Grandma (Mother of my grandpa who was 99 years old) passed away. I got sad of course we were close also but i also thought that maybe it was my grandpa warning me or my spirit guide.\n\nI don’t know what to make of this really. Do you think it was a coincidence or was it a warning?",

I would visit them pretty often as id go over there to eat, hang out or to see my uncles dogs.\nFriday after school I went inside my grandparents house to greet them . I looked for my uncle which was no where to be seen. Being young and adventurous i went back outside to the backyard . My uncle had 3 dogs, one was really quiet and was barley even seeable but at a certain view you could see him. Going up to the cage id usually be greeted by him but this time I wasn’t. I was about to leave until I heard him walking up to the cage panting and looking in distress&amp; more drained than usual,his eyes were pitch black and his paws had more dirt on his white fur more than usual, he looked like he’d been trying to dig pretty deep. the air felt tense and still, the other animals were quiet and the wind was barley blowing. The feeling brushed off as I was just happy to see him . I pet him even checked if he had food and he did even water was even spilt meaning he’d been drinking it recently . He was a French bull dog so I wasn’t thrown off by how dirty his paws were or the mess he’d made in his cage.\nI left after a few minutes thinking nothing of how black his eyes were or how dirty his paws seemed. \nGoing back inside my uncle greeted me. he then asked me what I was doing before he’d got there. I told him I was petting kilo (French bulldog) He laughed saying “you’re joking right?” I said no putting a blank face as to why he would even ask such a question. His face turned pale. he gave me a look as if he was concerned for me. \nBeing confused I just said okay I’m gonna go now. \nHours pass by and I visit them again only I go into my uncles room to ask him what he meant by was I joking. \nHe gives me a long blank face then proceeds to tell me that he’s been dead and cremated for 2 weeks already. \nI thought he was playing a prank on me a since I was young but he says “if you don’t believe me look on my dresser.” \nHe was there. His ashes in a small/medium box labeled with his name and date of when he was born &amp; when he died. \n\nIt’s been 4 years and the only thing I wonder is what I was petting that day. \nEver since that day I haven’t been able to pet a dog comfortably .",

Feel free to remove if this doesn’t fit here, but I just wanted to share this experience I had because this is the only major possible one I’ve ever had in my life so far. \n\n\nThis event took place during the summer of last year. For some background information, my good friend had passed away earlier that year-about 2 months prior to this. On this particular evening, I had decided to take melatonin to try to help me sleep, as my grief from this event had been keeping me up most nights. I took the melatonin and soon went to sleep. However, I awoke some hours later (probably around 4-4:30 or so in the morning) and I couldn’t fall back asleep. I was laying in bed and soon felt a sensation of someone touching me-like as if they were very lightly brushing my side with their hand. I remember getting a comforting feeling from this, it felt as if someone was trying to comfort me. \n\nI’d like to add that I was laying on my back at the time and don’t remember having blankets or anything that could have brushed against me like that in that moment. I have 2 cats that like to sleep near me in my bed, but they tend to move throughout the night, and I remember at that moment, they were not anywhere near me, so it wasn’t either of them. \n\nLogically, I know there is probably a very rational explanation for all of this. It could be chalked up to me being half awake and having taken a sleeping aid. It could’ve been a hallucination or something from that. But as crazy as it sounds, part of me wants to think maybe it was my friend visiting me one last time.",

        "text": "I run a used appliance shop in Brookston IN. This building is extremely haunted and is the oldest freemason temple (1848) in the county. I have a boat load of evps that I can set to public on my Google drive. I give anyone permission to give them a run through. I've got voices that range from claims of being the devil wishing that death may find me and that I'm next, infants crying, a girl named Brittany 1915-1935 claiming to be in love with me, whispering voices telling me it killed people here, and countless other voices asking if I can hear them. None of my evps are edited. However, you must listen at .5 speed to hear them as they speak 2× the speed of us. \n\nI am more focused on someone physically going there to do an investigation. I cannot and will not go there after sun down. I have been threatened and followed home as well. All voices I have recorded are during working hours 9-5. I figure if they are that hell bent on hurting me during the day it would be best for me not to go at night. Thusly I refuse to do so although I contact and speak with any willing spirit throughout the day. If I try to ignore them during work hours my name will literally be called aloud until I acknowledge them. Which is fine... I genuinely enjoy it and have grown a relationship with one in particular being \"Britney\" \n\nShe is the second spirit I have come into contact with and will come talk to me anytime I call her name to ask questions. All I know is that she is now 107 years old, born 1915 and died 1935. When I talk to her she is willing to answer specific questions I ask intelligently. As well as calling me cute, constantly telling me she loves me and most recently I gave her permission to touch me. In which case there was a bang immediately after saying it. Then a quick kiss sound followed by \"kissed you.\", And another bang. \n\nAfter this experience I had called to her and a man's voice said \"is this the man?\" Talking to her I suppose. After hearing his voice I did another session and asked him who he was. He gave me no name. Instead, something slammed extremely hard upstairs followed by a little girls voice saying \"you'll die\", a growl and a much more creepy voice repeating \"you'll die.\"\n\nI also feel as if there are innocent spirits that are trapped there. The spirits always ask for help but cannot tell me how to help them nor do I know how.\n\nI'm not scared as I know when I mention Jesus Christ only the voice of the children and Britney will come through and no one else. Great place to find your faith if you have lost it... However I am intrigued and genuinely would like to have someone or a group of NON AMATEURS to investigate. I say non amateurs only to protect you from being hurt. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. Please contact me and we can talk and set a time for you to check it out.\n\nAgain THIS IS NOT A JOKE! This isn't a story from when I was 13 minutes old. I do this literally every morning, lunch break, and afternoon. It is EXTREMELY active during the day I can only imagine the activity at night.",

The night was filled with 'nice to meet you's' and glad-handing while we made our way to meet up with our friends. There was this one particular guy there, never seen him before in my life that introduces himself then gets really close to me and says, \"We need to talk later.\" I was caught off guard by that but tried to stay pleasant and smiled, \"Sure bro we'll talk, I'll see you around the party.\"\n\nHe does this two more times throughout the night. \"We need to talk later.\" I'm starting to get a bit creeped out and make it a point to avoid him. It gets late in the night and just as I'm leaving, there he is. I'm distracted by the music and getting my things together as this guy starts talking about how he's a kind of Medium. I smile and nod, \"Cool man, well it was good to meet you, enjoy the party..\"\n\n\"Tom Waits!\" he blurts out. \"Tom Waits.\"\n\nIf there was anything that would make an agnostic like me get my attention it was that name. My cousin T committed suicide in his car out in the desert when he was 28. His brother J and I had to clean his car of his personal belongings at the police station. I would drive T's car to the junkyard to get rid of it and J would meet up with me. When I started the car it began playing Tom Waits' album Rain Dogs on repeat. I sat there in the car for awhile, listening. Crying. Thinking about how this was what T was listening to when he killed himself.\n\nNo one but J and I know about this. This wasn't some parlor trick vague-talk shot in the dark type thing. I didn't infer or try to connect dots to fit my narrative that my cousin was reaching out to me in some kind of afterlife. Hell, I wasn't even thinking about T at the time. The guy only asked what my name was and where I'm from. He knew nothing about my life yet said the most random and specific thing about a passed love one that I can't explain how he knew. It's honestly kind of messing with me.",

Me and my friend stayed in a twin room in a hotel at the weekend.. between 4am and 8am when we went to sleep I did not sleep a wink, I was absolutely freezing (the coldest I've ever been) and was profusely sweating, when I say sweating I mean SWEATING. Bed sheets and hair were soaked.\n\nIn the morning my friend told me she was awake between 5 -7am too scared to get up or make a sound as everytime she looked over to my bed there was a figure either sitting on my bed or standing by it. She saw them in several different positions over those 2 hours and is adamant that's what she saw.\n\nAnyone have any experiences similar? I do get scared or bad feelings in a lot of places but I can't say I felt scared or uneasy at the time, more frustrated and fed up that I was finding it so hard to sleep and was so sweaty/restless.",

        "text": "An hour ago my little sister (f8) and I (f19) were downstairs watching the bob's burger movie. It was already getting late and her eyes started getting droopy (signaling that she was getting sleepy).  I insisted we go upstairs so she can fall asleep in the bed instead of the couch. My sister was already making her way to the stairs right as I was turning off the tv and getting my bunny. Halfway up the second floor, we heard music playing. We both stopped so we can process what we were hearing. I immediately recognize the song being \"If I fell\" by The Beatles.  At first, I thought the music was coming from my phone (since I have that song on my playlist) . But I looked down and realized my phone was not playing anything at all.  The music  finally stopped right when the chorus hit. My brain started looking for logical reasoning. It couldn't be any speakers since a) my phone wasn't playing any music and b) my speaker wasn't even plugged in. It couldn't be my sister's Alexa because a) it wasn't on, b) we would've asked Alexa to stop and c) she does not listen to that type of music. It didn't come from outside because a) the neighbors weren't home and b) from the position we were at we wouldn't be able to hear any music from outside. Finally the only \"logical\" explanation would be my dad playing some prank on us. But we checked on him and he was asleep. Plus he solely listens to spanish/banda music (he doesn't even know who The Beatles are). I am completely clueless on what this could be. I am not a believer in the paranormal. However, everyone whose ever been in my house insist that it is haunted. People (including myself)  hear weird noises, doors opening, people talking, etc etc. I usually brush it off as something else. But this is the first occurrence where I genuinely have no explanation for the shit that just happened. Has this ever happen to anyone else? Can someone explain what this could be? Is this a paranormal experience or am I going insane?",

We live somewhat in the country side of southern Ontario in a small hamlet situated in the middle of a stretch of forest and our property sits on a hill that backs into the woods with tall pine trees surrounding the house. She claims to have seen the red light far up into our yard about 100ft away close to where the woods begin from the road where she was walking with the dog. She kept going and turned back around after a minute or two once the dog did it’s business and then saw the light again from the same spot she was at before but this time the light was half way down the yard in between the trees that separated our yard and our neighbours. She kept walking and moments later turned to see the light was now only a few feet away from her, the size of a baseball, behind our wire fence that’s 8ft up on a slope under some smaller pine trees. Shes near sighted and didn’t have her glasses on so she couldn’t make out if someone was behind the light or not and it was fairly dark. She said she called out to the light thinking I was playing a prank on her but to no response asked who are you, what’re you doing. Still no response, she kept walking and once she got to the start of our driveway she said the light was gone. No one was around expect for the couple that was walking ahead of her and once she got inside the house she saw I was just sitting with my dad as we were before she left. This is how she knew it wasn’t one of us shining the light and even weirder she said the dog didn’t react to the light at all which he normally would have if a person were there since he is a young dog that’s half husky and very erratic. My mom was really startled by this and I’ve never seen her like that. Has anyone ever experienced something like this or heard of an encounter such as this?",

My wife and I are both scientists, we don't rely at all on superior forces nor we believe in supernatural. However we found ourselves deeply challenged by her behavior.\n\nAround 19 months of age she began to struggle at night. Every morning after when we ask her what made her night so bad she systematicaly answer:\" little girl cries\" and \"the doggy\". \nWe live in a house in the suburbs, the neighborhood is very quiet. No noise at night except 1 or 2 cars passing by the street.\n\nFrom time to time she seems to be disturbed by a sudden presence in the living room or the bathroom. When it happens she stares towards whatever it is and says: \"Mister\". And when whe ask her where he is and what he dies she answers: \"there\" and \"fly,fly,fly\" pointing her finger and slowly ascending it to the ceiling or some corners.\n\nWe sometimes visit a aunt of mine in the country. My  \nlate uncle \"Francis\" passed away 9 years ago. My aunt legitimately had a hard time processing that loss and for that matter isn't showcasing any picture of my uncle in the house. She also never mentions his name. Whenever we pay a visit, comes the stressful moment when our beloved daughter says \"Francis\" or \"Is here\".\n\nWe truly have mixed emotions about this. In our line of work when we cannot explain an event we consider there is a reason but we just don't know it yet. It seems the same is occuring with our child.\n\nHope some of you had similar cases and to an extent will be able to reassure us.",

It went on for a while, but then it all stopped.\n\nI still remember, there was this little girl I used to play with named Amelia.  She was a kind little girl with bright yellow eyes and no pupils, white pale skin, and a soft smile.\n\nshe would always wear this frock that was white and brown, with brown frills, and brown buttons on her chest.\n\nthe skirt would always reach up to her knees. And her feet would be looking blueish due to the paleness of her skin. She seemed harmless, and she pretty much was as well.  But, something was off about her. She was there for me whenever I was alone. I forgot most parts but I remember vaguely cying to her about my problems. She would always say \"don't worry, it'll be fine\" and hug me tightly.\n\nHer voice was neutral almost, couldn't be differenciated between whether it was a man's voice or a woman's voice. She still visits me in my dreams to this day. So, I just wanted to know, if anyone else had encounters of this sort, or similar to this, I would like to know.",

I was 100% awake and aware of my surroundings. I could hear my heater whirring and some bugs outside. I could not move, or open my eyes. The first thing that was so odd about this was that almost every other sleep paralysis incident, the victim is filled with panic and fear- I was in absolute peaceful bliss. I was calm and my body felt light as air. Then, I slowly realized why I was awake. At first I thought my dogs were scratching at the floor, but they had never exhibited that behavior before. The scratching was not my dogs. It got louder and louder, more and more intense. I heard it coming rom the walls, the ceiling, the door and even the floor. Then pounding, growling, snarling. like something was trying to get in and was furious that it could not.  I should have been terrified, but the only thoughts running through my head were of how amazing my being felt. I was very aware of the intensity going on around me but I just didn't care. And then just as suddenly as it had started it completely stopped, and after quite a long time I was able to wiggle my toes and open my eyes. The rest of the night was normal and I haven't experienced anything since then. I am twenty now and no longer live in the house that it happened in. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? What could this have been, or meant?",

What really freaked me out was that one of my friends kept saying he was feeling energy around him and in certain areas. He’s not one to believe in this kind of stuff. We were in the kitchen when he said he felt the presence of two spirits one to the right and a heavier one next to the door. Then one of my other friends jumped back and said someone whispered help in their ear. Then my friend said the energies were gone. That was freaky. After a while we all went home and my friend who was feeling energy said he thinks something followed him home. He said he felt like someone was watching him and that when he was alone in his room he heard someone whispering. He also said while we were wandering the halls he felt a bunch of energy behind him. (He volunteered to be in the back of the group) He said it felt like they were watching us.\n\nWe did know that this place was haunted in advance so we were fully aware of that. We had heard stories about some of the ghosts. We have some classes in the building that’s connected to the pre-k as well. We all agreed to go in there because we wanted to experience the supernatural.\n\nI do also think that my friend might be a sensitive because he kept saying he felt pressure in certain area, emotions and energies.",

I have witnessed things before that happened but for context I want to start with that. \nWhen I was in high school (way before near death experience) I woke up to my dog barking on side of my bed. I was feeling uneasy that night and left my door open so I could see right where the top of the stairs was from my room. I wanted to ignore my dog but he wouldn’t stop so I looked up and saw at the top of the stairs a lady who was transparent green in like a European dress looking straight ahead. Obviously freaked out I went back to sleep cause I didn’t really care (common occurrence). In the same house a little time after that I was walking down the same stairs. I was stopped and popping pimples in the mirror on the wall cause lighting was good and then the door to my moms room slammed shut. I assumed my step dad was upstairs in the room and he was a coke head and had anger issues so it wasn’t abnormal if he did slam them. I continued down the stairs and he was sitting in the living room. Later it turns out all the rooms in just their room was slammed shut, even the closet, bathroom, and door to the toilet. Brushed it off as the wind and moved on. That house always had weird stuff happening like chairs moving, etc\nNext experience was after near death experience. I was in the car with my friend and it was late like 2 am. We were talking about our friend who passed. As we were talking I noticed in front of a house across the street a black shadow figure but missing bottom half walk in front of light and disappear. I brushed it off as a hallucination and before mentioning it to my friend she spoke up about seeing it and described it. \nNext experiences are after I moved to a new state and again after near death experience. I was sleeping and I started writing my victim impact statement for the trial. I was crying and obviously upset. I went to sleep after calming down. I woke up to feeling like someone was staring at me, that’s when I saw a white transparent figure with a blurred face and a headdress on. I turned to my boyfriend to see if he was witnessing this and he was asleep. I didn’t feel fear but I didn’t want to deal with it so I turned around and just thought to myself there’s no way that was real. I watched my bf sleep and after some time I went back to sleep, woke up the next day and convinced myself it was nothing and moved on (kinda). After that my bf and I moved in with our roommates into same apartment complex a few months pass I don’t experience anything until my roommates are at the hospital due to the birth of their daughter. I saw a dark figure walk in the hallway and I went to investigate but the door was still locked and we have an old door that doesn’t lock quietly so there’s no way it was a real person. \nSorry this is long but I want to possibly know if I’m just crazy or if those things are real ghost. I’m someone who likes to have answers to things and for this I might not ever have answers but it’s worth a shot",

I kept trying to pull my leg forward only to find it wouldn't budge. It didn't feel at all like there was a hand around my ankle. It was almost as if I'd stepped on an invisible glue trap. Not a single part of my foot was willing to move in the slightest. Next I tried pulling with my hands as hard as I could. I got so tired of pulling that I had to sit down and take a break. It was then I started to panic. I didn't know what to do. Afraid, I started yelling for my mom. At first she was annoyed at me for shouting as opposed to just meeting her downstairs because she didn't know the situation. After yelling for help enough times she eventually came to my aid and found me sitting in the hallway. Whatever it was that had been holding me didn't let go until she got up the stairs. I tried to tell her what happened but she just brushed it off as nonsense.\n\nOccasionally I'll think back on it and wonder what the hell happened that day. Part of me would like to think that something stopped me from falling down the stairs and potentially breaking my neck.",

A few years ago he moved to another state to be with his family. We eventually lost touch. He popped into my head randomly about last month, and I tried to get in contact with him, but he must’ve changed his number. Then the next week, our mutual friend told me that they just found out, that he (the coworker) took his on life. \n\n3. This is probably the most random one, as I didn’t actually know this person. It was last night actually, that I thought about Aaron Carter. I had never in my life paid any attention to him, but he suddenly was in my brain last night. And today he died.\n\nI hope to god these are just random coincidences, but it has happened way too many times. Wtf is going on. I always knew since childhood that I have this special connection to the universe, but have always brushed it off because I figured everyone must feel like that. But now, I’m not so sure.",

I grew up in the countryside of Northern California, across the road from a Native American burial ground and dense oak forest. My family were Christians but not devout, and this was before the time of the internet. It wasn't until years later I decided to research what I saw, and it shocked me.\n\nLike I said, it was late at night, and I was awake. I was between 9 and 12 years old. My younger brother and sister were in the same big room, and they were asleep. I was looking at the doorway towards the hallway that led to the rest of the house. The double-wide doorway was open, no closed doors. The oni peeked around the corner of the doorway. It was looking right at me, as if it knew where my eyesight was before it revealed itself to me. It peeked just it's head around at me very slowly and very slowly gave me a huge, smiling grin, keeping eye contact the whole time. It then slowly \"slid\" its head back around the corner, and I never saw it again. The oni was red with curling lips and horns, but it was not \"terrifying\" in the sense of a werewolf or Christian demon. It was about 5'7-ish in height, but I never saw its body, just the head. The image has been burned into my brain ever since.\n\nI brushed this off as just a childish hallucination for a long time. About 11-12 years later, when I was in my late teens/early 20s, I decided to look on the internet and see what I could find. I googled something like \"smiling red demon\" and eventually found it online. I was shocked. There it was. I started reading that it was an oni, they liked to hide behind things, and that many people had seen one before. I now know it wasn't just a hallucination. I saw one.\n\nI'm now in my mid-30s, and I still think about the oni. Now that I'm older, I don't think it wanted to hurt me at the time, nor could it since I still had the innocence of a child. I feel it revealed itself to me just to show me that otherworldly things exist, maybe for fun, or maybe as a warning not to be evil. I've had good fortune in life and don't do evil things. I do feel if I tried hard enough, I could summon the oni, but I have never wanted to.\n\nI'm a legal professional who makes a lot of money, and I'm not really religious, although I believe in a higher power. I'm white and straight.\n\nI'm not making any of this up. Oni are real.",

        "text": "This is not my story, but rather my mother's. It was year 1995 and my mother was deathly sick. She was basically on her death bed. Multiple doctors had given up on her and there was no apparent cause for her illness. Day by day, her health was deteriorating. The last doctor my mother went to told my grandparents that she does not have long considering how things were going.\n\nMy mother was very close to one of her cousin's from my grandmother's side. When she was fighting her ailment, he suddenly passed away because of a heartattack. In my culture, we have a 13 days mourning period and a feast on the 13th day, to let the soul of the deceased finally be free and at peace. The day after my mother got the doctor's verdict, she had a vivid dream.\n\nShe saw her cousin, deathly pale with rot all over his body come up to her and hug her. She asks him what's wrong and what happened to him. He says \"It's time for me to leave you all but I'll be watching over you always\". At this point, my mother starts crying and begging him to stay. She grabs at his shirt and tells him to stop and that there are people he can't leave behind. He pushes her away and holds her hand, saying \"I can't stay even if I wanted to. Because I need to take your pain away with me. Live your life please, I'll make sure you're healthy and happy\". \n\nAfter saying this, he starts walking towards a pile of burning wood (we cremate our dead) and vanishes. My mother wakes up screaming and crying, runs to the bathroom and vomits a dark brown vomit which she says looked like soil. After she was done, she kept asking my grandmother about her cousin. She was then informed that he had passed away almost 2 weeks ago and today was his final mourning day. My mother was so sick that no one had told her anything about the death of her cousin.\n\nAfter that day, her health rapidly started getting better. She finally got a diagnosis for tuberculosis of stomach and recovered within a span of few months. It's the freakiest true story that I know of.",

Idk where I should start but i think the best place would be to start from the very beginning (I would also like to mention i am not very proficient at writing in English so please don’t mind if i make shit load of mistakes). I have never believed in ghost or paranormal stuff but i have a very brief memory of an event from when i was around 8 years old, Our house has a very old design so the outmost room of the house was used as a garage but also as a room for study…me and my brothers we used to play board games every evening after school generally around 5 to 6 pm till 7 pm…one day the whole room started smelling really bad like something was rotting and it was really out of nowhere and sudden and we ran out the room but didn’t mind it much we did complain about it to our parents and by the time someone came to check for the smell it was completely gone…and it started happening everyday for the next 7 days I remember it clearly it always started exactly at 6 pm and then the smell completely disappears after 20 to 25 minutes. Our parents noticed it too and didn’t find any source after sometime one of our relatives advised to bring a priest so they can check and the next day a priest arrived he immediately mentioned that the house has been cursed by someone (never found out by who) afterwards they did a ritual and nothing happened after that everything was back to normal. We all grew up and forget about it and I didn’t held any beliefs towards black magic or paranormal stuff. Recently I started getting weird nightmares of a tall lady but the last one felt very real. I had three nightmares so far where the same lady appeared and I remember all of them very clearly…ill start with the first one. First nightmare: It happened at our house (yes the same house) i was having this dream where i am standing in the courtyard of our house and i was trying to find my way inside the house through the front door when i got to the front door i saw a tall lady with long hands wearing a red dress facing towards the door of house so I couldn’t see how she looked like but I really started panicking then I remember very clearly i heard loud barefoot steps not inside the dream but in real life idk how to explain but at that moment i knew that these footsteps were inside my room after this everywhere happened in blink of an eye I know someone blew air right in my ear and flicked with a finger at the back of my neck and I woke up screaming but I completely felt the sensation that someone did touched my neck idk i was being paranoid or overthinking but I literally could feel someone touched me but there was no in my room.",

        "text": "Hi all, I'm hoping to see if anyone else has had a similar experience. For background, we had a cat named Bucky, who absolutely LOVED my mom like nobody else - that was his person. I was probably his second favorite, and he didn't really care for anybody else. In December 2019, he passed away at the age of 3 due to a blood clot that caused a very sudden and traumatic death due to heart failure - we had to put him down at the vet, and due to the ground being frozen, we were not able to bury him on our property, as we had with our other pets that had passed. Instead, we opted to get him cremated, but could not afford to do a single cremation where we would get the ashes back, just a group cremation. We did, however, get a post-mortem paw print cast made, and it's been by my mother's bedside on a shelf ever since.\n\nLast year, I cannot remember exactly when, I was visited by Bucky in a dream, after his spirit had travelled all the way from the crematorium. It took him 2 years to travel since it was so far away, I guess. I assumed that his spirit moved on after this, but it seems it has not. According to my mother, she's had a \"cat\" jumping up onto her bed every now and then, but it was when she was half asleep, so she didn't think much of it. Last night, when she was fully awake(able to move and look around, so not sleep paralysis), she had a cat(not a real cat, a spirit I suppose) open her bedroom door, and jump up onto her bed, and start heading to her face - Bucky's favorite place to sleep was in the crook of her neck. She screamed and turned the lights on and nothing was there, and slept on the couch because it had scared her so much.\n\nThis morning, she told me about it, since it had rightfully freaked her out. She thought at first that it was somehow our cat (alive)Susie, trying to wake her up, since he was stuck in the garage all night and wanted into the house, but then I mentioned Bucky, and I think she kind of realized that it might be. So she went to grab his paw-cast, which again, is always next to her bed, and it was gone. We looked everywhere, and we can't find it.\n\nSo my question is, has anyone had a similar experience of a dead loved one/pet somehow take their piece that we remember them by, whether it's ashes, a favorite toy, a paw-cast, etc?\n\nAnd, I suppose it's not that big of a deal since he's not a violent or mean spirit, but one more so of love(god, that sounds cheesy), is there any way to help him move onto whatever afterlife, or will he go in his own time? He was awfully young when he died, so I wonder if he isn't quite ready to go yet.\n\n(I hope this is an alright flair btw!)",

When he did finally get to sleep, any time I would reposition myself, he would wake up. I felt bad for waking him so I decided to sleep on the couch. I whispered my plan to him and quietly left the room. His dog followed and cuddled up with me on the couch. \n\nI fell asleep, but awoke a couple hours later to the sound of footsteps. I thought it was just my partner going to the bathroom or getting a drink of water. I ignored it and closed my eyes. The footsteps started to sound like they were approaching me. I started getting creeped out,  not at the thought of paranormal activity but that  my partner was approaching me while I was sleeping. Ironically, I had just watched that \"I am a stalker\" netflix show that night and my mind was full of werid scenarios. After all,me and my partner have only known each other for a couple of months. The footsteps sounded loud, but then suddenly stopped. I felt like someone was watching me. Creeped out, I decided to stop pretending like I was sleeping and open my eyes. When I did, no one was there. I got up and looked around the kitchen and down the hallway but it was . My partners door was closed, just like I left it. There was no way he could of passed the kitchen, went to his room and shut the door in less than a minute. I always was thinking that if it was him, his dog would of acknowledged him, instead he stayed curled up in my lap snoring. \n\nI didnt get any negative feeling from the presence, just one of curiosity. \n\nI just wanted to share this experience with you all. It's my first time encountering the paranormal, outside of dreams. I have mixed feelings about it. Should I do anything about this? Can you help a spirit cross over, or is that a hollywood \"ghost whisper\" concept. It didn't seem mavolent or anything but is it good to have an entity living in your house? \n\nThanks 😊",

        "text": "Hello reddit! I've been reading the stories on this page and now I want to share my experience too. Sorry if the format is a little weird.\n\nThis experience happened years ago, i was in my early teens. To put things in context we have two floors in our home, with all the bedrooms on the second floor while everything else such as the kitchen, living room, etc. On the first floor. And each floor has a bathroom but the relevant one in this story is the one on the second floor.\n\nSo this happened in the evening, i was at my parents' room having a conversation, and so my mom forgot her phone downstairs in the dining room. So she told me to get it and I don't know how but i already got a bad feeling that something is going to happen so I wasn't reluctant to get it, eventually i was forced to go get it so i went. When i got out i noticed something odd already, my room's door was wide open and all the lights and electronics in my room were on, including my electric fan. Next to my room was the bathroom and the bathroom as well has its door wide open with all the lights on. I never remembered leaving my door open as well as turning all of my lights and electric fan on, I always made sure to turn everything off before leaving my room. I started to get creeped out but i tried ignoring it, well yea i tried to. The moment i passed by my room and the bathroom all the lights and electronics switched off at the same time, including the electric fan. Like in just a snap all shut down simultaneously. I started freaking out and just ran to get my mother's phone downstairs and go back to my parents' room. I told my parents about my experience but they never believed me as they thought that it was just some electrical error. The next day i asked my brother and my cousins (they were staying over during that time) if they were pranking me or they were aware of what was happening. My brother (his room was next to my room) never had any electrical problems as his light never switched off unless he did, my cousins are sleeping in the guest room downstairs so they didn't notice anything happening. I'm pretty convinced that a ghost was haunting that night.\n\nBonus: one of my cousins also has had a paranormal experience. We have an attic storage space so my cousin went up there dusting, and they also brought their vacuum. While they were organizing some boxes the vacuum tube (if that's what you call it) suddenly dropped and they saw a dark fog just passing by before disappearing again, my dog was with them and my dog just peed on the floor, my dog didn't bark which was also unusual as she would bark at anything. My cousin just took off with my dog leaving the vacuum behind.",

        "text": "Two weeks ago a cousin of mine died because of a brain tumor and more or less 10 minutes later my head started to hurt A LOT. At that time I was in class (in Spain) and he was in Australia where he lived. When the pain started I was scared of it being a signal of he dying because my mother told me when we were talking about weird things we have lived with the family that her head started one day to hurt a lot. Later, she freaked out because the pain started the same moment in which his cousin died in an airplane accident. So, when my head started to hurt knowing that my cousin had a brain tumor I remembered her story. When I arrived at home my father told me he was dead.",

When she saw me with him, she left and scared us both. It turns out that this person was also harassing him on the phone. I suggested he go to the police but he didn't want to, he didn't care. \n\nToday, as I was passing by his house, I noticed that the girl was hiding in the trees. I think she was stalking again, so I shouted at her and she immediately ran away. I do not know the girl in any way, I do not understand what she wants from my friend. I can't ask because she runs away every time she sees me.\n\n What should I do? Should I tell the police?",
