        "text": "Watched it a couple of times as a kid and loved it, but completely forgot about it. Somehow remembered its existence a couple days ago but for the life of me I can't remember its name and my google fu has failed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, its a (probably)  90's or early 00's sci fi-aliens/high-school/coming of age/government conspiracy flick of this kid that starts having dreams or memories of being an alien pilot fighting a war against bad aliens, getting defeated, and crashlanding on Earth. He also has this like metallic tangerine slice made of an alien alloy, but has no clue what it is or does.\n\nPlot happens, he meets this girl in school that also has memories of being an alien pilot and also has a tangerine slice, like a matching pair. Plot further happens (?) and they discover they are actually reencarnations or mind transfers of the alien pilots that died when the ship crashed, but while they mind uploaded themselves into babies, their third and last crewmember (their tail gunner?) uploaded into a grown adult, who got subsequently locked up in an insane asylum for thinking he's an alien.\n\nThey rescue him but something happens (dies or refuses) and the boy and the girl must proceed to the spaceship without him, having to delegate the position of tail-gunner to a non alien-reincarnated sidekick character. The US government actually had the spaceship locked up,  so they break in, but are caught by generic agency men in black before they can take of. Plot happens, and the US eventually lets them take off because the bad aliens are real and have just showed up, presumably intent on conquering earth. The protags and the sidekick take off in the space ship, fight them off, and hyperjump to new adventures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nChildhood memories being a funny thing (ironic considering the movie's themes) I'm probably misremembering a whole lot, but would really appreciate the help. Google keeps telling me its The Last Starfighter or Flight of the Navigator... and its neither.",

        "text": "Whenever I read about end of time civilizations, like the Xeelee, I'm always baffled how anything can spread out into most of the universe and maintain continuity. How do the people in galactic supercluster A continue to share similar goals, culture, technology, history, language and physical form with the guys at supercluster Z on the other side of the universe? \n\nI'm not an expert in information theory, but it seems like major drift will occur once your civilization reaches a maximum threshold of mass. Even if you exchange information and goals at FTL speeds, intent and attention of any group of individuals has to bubble down at slow consciousness speeds first. Thus a bottleneck of exchange is unavoidable and drift must occur. Yet scifi novels always talk about these civilizations spanning entire multiverses as if they are one thing with one set of mutual goals. \n\nEven if this civilization is a single \"being\". If it's mind stretches out into the space of a universe, its consciousness cannot be coherent in multiple places. Because it must observe and react to a universe spanning surface area of events. If it does do this, then it is not uniform thought. The being's consciousness is split between many other personalities each processing events in a unique place in the universe. The question of drift between these personalities resurfaces.",

        "text": "Hey hey folks!\nI have recently finished The Fall of Hyperion, and I am left with a strong feeling that most of it makes zero sense (at least to me), hence I would really appreciate some help.\nI'm especially perplexed by the pilgrimage and the Shrike, both of which really make no sense to me.\n\nThe Shrike's actions seem to be completely nonsensical. Why kill Hoyt, knowing he had not one but 2 cruciforms? Why only impale Silenus, and why not when he did King Billy too? Why plug Brawne with that fleshy cable? What the hell was that whole Rechel mess about? I thought that it might have been some Terminator kinda thing, going back in time to kill the future badass Moneta, but if that's the point, then why not let the Merlin disease run it's course and rescue her at the very last second instead?\n\nIn general, what was the point of the pilgrimage in the first place? It seems to me that, apart from Kassad leading the army in the future (but did he really have to go all the way there for this to happen?) and Brawne becoming a Shrike killer, no one else really accomplished anything relevant, at least as far as the Shrike/time tombs part of the story in concerned. In particular, are Masteen and Silenus doing anything relevant for the story at all?\n\nAnd what was the point of kidnapping the second cybrid to let him agonize on Old Earth in the same circumstances as with the original Keats?\n\nAnd why were the Ousters so obsessed with Hyperion as well?\n\nAnd finally, if the time tombs are travelling back in time, which I imagine as them following a \"time arrow\" that orginates in the future and moves in the opposite direction of the normal \"time arrow\", doesn't that mean that the time tombs should have appeared out of the blue, when the arrows met, and then playing in reverse from the pov of everyone else?\n\nI tried to find in depth videos about this on YT, but they all seem to spoiler the other 2 books as well, which bothers me because I might read those as well. So yeah, no Endymion spoilers please :)\n\nThanks!",

        "text": "Link:  [https://beforewegoblog.com/an-interview-with-matt-davenport/](https://beforewegoblog.com/an-interview-with-matt-davenport/)\n\n## “The  general tone is more of an urban fantasy meets coming of age. We’re  intending this to be a series where we’ll see growth of the students  into who they will become.”\n\n## 1. Can you describe Miskatonic University: Elder Gods 101 to readers?\n\nMiskatonic University: Elder Gods 101 *is about 5 lost kids  entering into adulthood with less answers than questions, as everyone at  that age is. Unlike most, they only start to discover more and more  questions as they find their lives entwined with Lovecraft’s horrors and  the disturbing past of the school. It was very much inspired by stories  like Harry Potter,* Super-Powereds\\*, and\\* Divergent\\*.\\*\n\n## 2. What separates it from other Lovecraft fiction out there?\n\n*It takes itself slightly less seriously on the horror side of  things. We could have gone full horror and existential dread, but Mike  and felt like that would take away from the real horrors that some of  these kids (and readers) would have been able to empathize with. There’s  plenty of monsters and such, but the real horror in this story is  teenagers learning that they don’t have all the answers. Every kid at  that age is trying to find themselves, distance themselves from what  they came from, or create something new entirely their own. These kids  just have a lot farther to go than most.*\n\n## 3. Is it more horror, sci-fi, or urban fantasy? What’s the general tone?\n\n*The general tone is more of an urban fantasy meets coming of age.  We’re intending this to be a series where we’ll see growth of the  students into who they will become. Will they turn into fully developed  horrors akin to the mythos that these ideas came from, or will they  become fully functioning adults in a world that has mostly rejected  them?*\n\n*The real answer will be much messier than either of those answers,  but it’ll be fun getting there and addressing their lives. We see a lot  of that in Ralph in this first book. He not only struggles with where  he comes from but he knows that the clock is ticking and he won’t be  able to blend in for much longer. At what point does he make a choice on  how to live his life, and does he even have a choice?*\n\n## 4. Why did you choose to write it this way?\n\n*Most of the development of this book, prior to fingers on  keyboard, was from my brother, Mike. He normally works with me on  superhero novels, but he loved reading my Andrew Doran books and wanted  to understand them better. In that, he decided to binge EVERYTHING  Lovecraft. When he was done, he came to me with this idea.*\n\n*As for the style, I normally write everything in first person, but  we didn’t want to do that with this book. We wanted each of the  students of the Scion Cycle to feel like the main protagonist.*\n\n## 5. Who are the protagonists of the book?\n\n*Ralph, Carlos, Sheryl, and Meredith. Complete strangers at the  beginning of the book, the injustices they deal with by just being  themselves draws them together fairly early.*\n\n*Ralph is directly from Innsmouth, and rumors abound of that place.  Nobody puts much stock into those rumors, but it doesn’t stop them from  being real ass-hats to people from there. The people of Innsmouth don’t  do anything to dispel these rumors, using them much as they used  anonymity in the 1920’s to deflect people from visiting. Even with that,  though, the city couldn’t fight the tides of time, and had to start  integrating their school sports with the rest of the state. That’s where  Ralph found his love of football. That’s his only real love, as he  doesn’t appreciated the forced indoctrination from his people or the  demand that he marry a female spawn of Dagon when all he wants is to  start his own life away from the sea and maybe with a certain boy  instead…*\n\n*Carlos is your average kid, mostly. He’s a local that gets weird  visions that he doesn’t entirely understand. Out of each of the Scion  Cycle, he’s the most gregarious and friendly.*\n\n*Followed closely by Meredith, she’s mostly normal but with a  curiosity that’s dangerous given her past. Her family has been in  hiding, avoiding a group out there who have at least killed one of them.*\n\n*Sheryl is a gamer. We all know her. She likes to fall into her  video games after a stressful afternoon. Everyone keeps telling her that  she’s a genius when it comes to math, but she hates math. She got into  MU on a math scholarship, but she’s hoping she can use that as a jumping  point to land in a gaming related field. If only those pesky nightmares  would stop plaguing her. If they’re nightmares.*\n\n*Stephanie is an odd duck. She’s cold and calculating on the  outside, but she feels her emotions stronger than most. She focuses on  her studies and learning everything that she can. For whatever reason,  the students of Miskatonics, and ever some of the teachers, treat her  with disgust and hate in their eyes. Especially that Halsey girl.*\n\n## 6. Who is your favorite among them?\n\n*Stephanie, definitely. She’s like writing for Wednesday Addams.  You want to get to know her and as soon as you think you do, she does  something completely unexpected, but not out of character. Ralph is a  close second. He just wants a life, not even a normal one. He just wants  one less odd than being part of an Innsmouth clan. Unfortunately, his  problem is genetic and not as easy to escape.*\n\n## 7. What sort of adventures do they get into?\n\n*At current, they get pulled into a lot of mythos related danger.  Half of them are looking into their own pasts, and you quickly see that  the past comes with a cost. Stephanie’s journey, specifically to the  “old family home” was a lot of fun to write and we actually wrote two  different versions of it. The second version might get worked into a  later sequel. The other’s journeys are a lot about self-discovery, but  even going to the library can come with hazards, as Meredith can attest.*\n\n*There’s a subplot throughout the book that maybe bringing back an  ancient witch can solve a lot of their problems, and they end up  visiting alien worlds, the Dream Lands, and places that they could never  have imagined visiting.*\n\n## 8. What draws you to the Cthulhu Mythos?\n\n*I like weird. Not just any weird, but the kind of weird that  leaves you with more questions than answers. That’s what draws me to a  lot of Horror stories. The idea of a complex world hidden underneath  everything we think we know uprooting our idea of comfort always  attracts my attention.*\n\n*Then there’s the “let me play in your sandbox” kind of feeling.  All of Lovecraft’s crazy world and he never showed a good guy trying to  tame it. Only bad guys who became so through trying to tame it. I like  that as an ending for a character arc, but what about before all of  that? What about when that dark wizard in the tomb was young and just  finding the magic? When Lumley showed me that Titus Crow could exist, I  saw opportunity to manipulate the mythos in a lot of ways. So, let me  play with your sandbox and let’s see what happens…*\n\n## 9. What other Mythos authors would you recommend?\n\n*David Hambling is one of my favorites. He’s a great friend to chat  with and arguably my favorite pal over the pond. The same goes for my  interviewer, himself, C.T. Phipps. Both Hambling and your stories lend a  lot toward modernizing the mythos without subtracting from the horror.*\n\n*And I have yet to meet a bad co-author in the Mythos. David  Conyers, Peter Rawlik, David West, David Wilson, John DeLaughter, Andrea  Pearson, Mark Howard Jones, and Byron Craft have been just wonderful to  work with.*\n\n*Conyer’s Harrison Peele universe makes me want to write more  Doranverse stories, while Rawlik’s Weird Company keeps making me wish  for an Avengers-style mythos movie.*\n\n## 10. Will we see more of this series?\n\n*Definitely. We’ve already started notes on the second book, but  we’re going to revise how they start. Book 2 will open up on the now  host-less podcast that was mentioned in the story, with Meredith at the  helm and trying to put out there a more humanizing view of Stephanie and  her odd familial past. Plus, we left a lot of loose ends at the end of  book 1. It will be fun pulling on those …*",

        "text": "Hey folks!\n\nThe players in the Stars Without Number campaign recently commissioned a bright shiny big o' beautiful brand new ship, and I'm trying to work out the layout of the dang ol' thing. A flashy new corvette-class ship called the Naughty Newt (their name, not mine, don't ask).\n\nAnyway, I'm putting together the layout, and right now I'm trying to work out what's on what decks. I've got four decks planned right now, though I may need to consolidate them down to three, I don't know. But I'm wondering if anyone here wouldn't mind taking a quick look at this basic deck plan and letting me know 1. if I've made any obvious mistakes, 2. if there are any other rooms or fittings that would be standard, but that I've forgotten, and 3. I don't know, anything else that you want to tell me. Like how good your day is going or something.\n\nSo! Let's start with **Deck 1:**\n\n* **Bridge, with stations for Comms, Engineering, Pilot, Gunnery, Navigation**\n* **Bridge-adjacent bunk and bathroom**\n* **Briefing room**\n* **Stairs** \n\n**Now to Deck 2:**\n\n* **Lodgings and facilities (bathrooms, laundry chutes, etc) for up to 20 crewmembers**\n* **General supply store**\n* **Armory**\n* **Lounge/Recreational facilities/green space**\n* **Galley and Cafeteria**\n* **4 bathrooms**\n* **Stairs and elevators**\n* **Docking structure/entrance and exit doors**\n* **Blast doors**\n\n**Deck 3:**\n\n* **Medical bay/lab**\n* **Boarding tubes**\n* **Life support systems**\n* **Lodgings and facilities (bathrooms, laundry chutes, etc) for up to 20 crewmembers**\n* **4 bathrooms**\n* **Airlocks**\n* **Stairs and elevators**\n* **Blast doors**\n\n**Deck 4**\n\n* **Cargo storage with cargo bay doors/ramp**\n* **Smuggler’s hold/hidden cargo space**\n* **Shuttle bay**\n* **Fusion generator**\n* **Spike drive**\n* **Engineering station/workshop**\n* **Fuel storage**\n* **2 bathrooms**\n* **Stairs and elevators**\n\n**On the Outer Hull**\n\n* **Plasma beam, Flak emitter battery, Polyspectral MES beam (hidden weapons systems)**\n* **Comms laser and/or antennae**\n* **Thrusters**\n\nSo! That's the general layout I have in mind. Any thoughts would be very much appreciated!",

A machete gets stuck in the post of the tent at some point and the crew are killed or go missing.\n\nThe movie then shifts to modern day and people end up in this area maybe to go camping or exploring and come across the tent and the equipment with the machete still stuck in the post and they question it but soon they start to get picked off. They are getting hunted by something (a group of Aliens/Monsters) similar to the predator.\n\nSpoiler ahead from the ending - &gt;!The main character covers herself in some sludge related to the animals/aliens that allows her to become invisible to them or tolerable to them and allows her to either fight back or escape.!&lt;",
