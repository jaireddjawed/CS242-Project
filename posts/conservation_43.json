We were founded in January of 2016 by two women scientists in the United States and have since gathered the beginnings of a international movement through our regular outreach, videography, photography, and cleanup events. We want to start a conversation about marine habitats and sea life with as much of the general public as we can and are thrilled with what immediate success we've had so far!\n\nOur next great opportunity to do accomplish our goals is the [IUCN World Congress](http://www.iucnworldconservationcongress.org/) where our message can reach political, scientific, and NGO leaders that would otherwise be outside of our reach. Unfortunately, all of our funds are already tied up in the operation of the organization.\n\nIf you can help by donating at our [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/conversationocean), or even just by following us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ConVersationOcean) or Instagram [@conversation_ocean](https://www.instagram.com/conversation_ocean/) if you just want to share our passion for marine conservation or ask us questions, we would be forever grateful.\n\nBest fishes,\n\nAriel and Yasmin",
