Would such a project even produce coherent results? It seems that early directors might be much more willing to mix-up the order of scenes during editing without needing to worry about dialog.",

        "text": "Just finished The Stranger (2022) and really enjoyed it. The movie is full of several repeating motifs that I feel like I am on the verge of understanding but am not quite there. I was wondering what others thought.\n\nOne of the main motifs in the movie is smoking. Henry is almost always seen smoking a cigarette. When he is not smoking he has an inhaler. Early in the film Henry asks Mark if he wants a cigarette and Mark says he has quit. There are several references to not being able to breath in the movie, as well as several instances of Mark doing breathing exercises. Mark also talks in voice over about blowing out the black air (or something along those lines) with a visual of dark smoke covering the screen. The film also ends with Mark finally smoking while his son watches him with the last thing we hear being the son breathing. \n\nWith the final shot being of the son it almost seems like the smoking is a representation of trauma and the idea of how it is passed from person to person or generationally. It also could be an extension of  not being able to breath or just anxiety. It also seems to be another way to link Mark and Henry.\n\nMark and Henry appear very similar physically, sharing the same facial har as well as having a very tired look. They both also struggle connecting with people. Henry has no one in his life and talks about how its nice to have friend to Mark. Mark seems upset for the entire movie even when he is spending time with his son. The only scene in the movie where he appears to connect to someone else is when Henry plays him music. \n\nFinally I didn't understand the broken glass. Early in the film Marks son breaks a cup and Mark cleans it up with his bare hands. Later John breaks a cup and again Mark cleans it up. \n\nSo What is everyones thoughts on this movie, and what do you think is the purpose of the smoking and the broken glass. Is there anything else I missed?",

Since he is widely considered one of the finest directors working today, should his average shot lengths be on the same level as Michael Bay's?\n\nAnd finally, what is your take on the final part of the video? Should Nolan have cut away from the scene after Cobb had already finished saying the word \"parasite\"? Is it possible that this was some sort of an editing mistake?",

        "author": "Welles_Bells",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/9ka8hu/john_carpenters_christine_a_thrilling_genre_take/",
        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/xf5fiwc20gp11.jpg\n\nIf you're looking for a quality addition to your horror viewing as October rolls in, I highly recommend John Carpenter's adaptation of *Christine*. He manages to leverage his carefully crafted suspense sequences and marry them to a better than I was expecting teenage drama, all of which brought a fairly silly premise to vivid life. I know just about every Carpenter film can be accused of being \"underrated\", but with *Prince of Darkness* and *In the Mouth of Madness* finding plenty of champions doing the good work, I suggest we turn our attention to this solid entry in his filmography. I don't think it's a top tier film in his canon by any means, but this a surprisingly nuanced take America's warped relationship with some of its most vital iconography.\n\nHere's a link to my [full review of Christine](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/30/christine/) if you want to read it with images. \n\nThere are few sounds as important to the American iconography as the engine rumble of a powerful car. It’s the aural equivalent of an open stretch of road anywhere but here; a powerful, mechanized decedent of the four-legged beasts that carried their riders to the imagined freedom of the west. Although in the age of climate consciousness and ride sharing, a muscle car’s rumble is nearly as bygone in daily life as its predecessor. The sound still carries its meaning, one that for teenage boys in the mid 20th century was not yet a nostalgic fantasy but a tantalizing reality: it was the sound of freedom. So when John Carpenter forgoes his traditional bass-heavy score over the distinctive opening credits in favor of the growling engine noise of a 1958 Plymouth Fury, why does it sound so sinister?\n\nAlfred Hitchcock played the same trick on audiences in his avian-suspense film The Birds. In lieu of credits music, he took an ordinary sound full of its own connotations and played it enough times for it to acquire a sense of unease through repetition. Why won’t don’t they stop? If the bird noises create unease, then Christine (for the car here has a name and a personality to match) generates of sense of downright malevolence through the ubiquity of her hungry engine rumble. It’s a brutal, animal sound that the film gets us antiquated with early, priming us for every ignition or acceleration sound to come. Rather than liberating, the sound of Christine becomes oppressive.\n\nFor Arnie—played brilliantly through all of his many transformations by Keith Gordon—our would-be hero and repressed loner, Christine begins that untainted promise of freedom. The freedom from his overbearing parents, the constant bullying at school, and the freedom from his own sexual hangups. As it turns out, Arnie gets more than he bargained for (or maybe exactly what he bargained for?), and Christine’s living embodiment of material fetishism ends by entombing him in an ever isolating social prism. She takes him away from his parents. She kills his bullies. And she gives him the attention he’s always wanted from girls.\n\nFor all her personality, Christine represents a pitfall in American culture. The film may have been more of director-for-hire job for Carpenter than a personal one, but it embodies some of the same consumer culture skewering that goes on in They Live. It exposes the narcissistic quality of material obsession, of car culture in particular. Christine may be a nasty piece of work but she—it—is still just a car, possessed by the devil or not. And Arnie’s endless fixation with maintaining the car is really just an obsession with himself and his own qualities, made clear by his ever more carefully manicured and coiffed appearance as he goes deeper down the rabbit hole. The scene in which Christine repairs herself in front of Arnie has often been compared to a strip show, but to me it plays more like masturbation. Christine is just a reflection of what Arnie wants to see in himself, a reflection he gets ever closer to, in exclusion to all life around him, as in Caravaggio’s Narcissus.\n\nOf course this is a monster movie, and as such the metaphors only stretch to a certain point, before the silly self-driving devil cars outlive the human conflict, and the drama ultimately becomes one of life and death. It’s thrilling stuff though, and a minor miracle that Carpenter and his cadre of talented young actors were able to sell the inherent silliness of the concept in the first place. Carpenter of course is a master at selling silliness, but the real trick here is that none of it (well, most of it) even feels silly. Arnie’s descent into teenage isolation feels as scary and real as a serial killing car engulfed in flames running down a teenager.\n\nBy isolating its protagonist from the rest of the cast, the film ultimately begins to isolate itself from the audience as well, and by the time the well-staged climax rolls around, the human investment isn’t nearly as powerful as the allure of the crafting of suspense or in the special effects of its reforming car. Normally I wouldn’t exactly be loathe to bemoan pyrotechnics or a well-crafted suspense sequence overshadowing the drama, but ironically Carpenter’s film about an autonomous murderer car has some of his best drama; and if for nothing else but that, had not it also been a very fine thriller, Christine has earned its place in Carpenter’s pantheon where it can forever rev its bloodthirsty engine.",

It felt like it had a more satisfying ending. The real point that i felt was lost on the film was the statement it was trying to make about the newsworld changing in the mid 1980s, but i felt it didn't really say anything about it it kinda was just a side story to the main love plot. Anyways thats all i can think to say about that film. I would just like to get some other opinions about the film. ",

        "text": "I'm one of the few people who hadn't seen this film but times change. It's a pretty good film, as people already know. Let's follow me as I ramble about this film. What I say may be extremely obvious, but I've not read anyone else's thoughts about the film so I'll just talk.\n\nI feel as if Rosebud is Kane's want for love and attention, he was separated from his mother at a young age for the pursuit of money, which broke his heart and, even though, being separated from his mother made him extremely wealthy, he longed for actual human connections. It was brief but the film mentions how he went through a string of girls during his bachelor days, which could be due to this, possibly. You can, also, see this through how he had two wives throughout his lifetime, and even though he didn't actually cheat on the first, the reason they divorced was because he just found a new connection, which stimulated his neediness, which blew out of proportion.\n\nKnowing that the constant usage of puzzles was to show how life's just a series of pieces, that make one giant picture, made me think about the statues Kane collected. I feel as if it could represent the idea that he wants to be idolised and become sort of a myth. He says multiple times during the movie how he owns many newspaper companies, and therefore controls the public's opinions, which could point to this idea of a man become something more; a myth, simply because that's what we're taught.\n\nI think he parallels many real-life historic characters, such as Christopher Columbus, who're championed as heroes for doing one thing, despite maybe not being the best people. I'm looking at the scene where he hits his second wife.\n\nThose were my initial thoughts about the film, I literally just finished it about five minutes ago, so I'll probably think of more stuff right after this post goes out but yay, I finally saw this.",

        "text": "This is not about the quality of particular superhero movies - many of which are very good and have merit, but intrinsic limitations in the superhero form itself. My view is that superhero movies, e.g. movies about a person with superpowers who saves the world, usually by fighting, intrinsically does certain disservice to audiences by its very nature. \n\nWhat these movies do is play into the normal person's delusions of becoming rich and famous, or somehow \"super\" and \"exceptional\" like the hero. For older people for whom such dreams are already dashed, it plays into the need to worship some kind of idol, like a deity or God that will make everything alright. It plays into the fantasy that, just as you were when you were a child, there is some being 'watching over us' and protecting us from evil.\n\nSuperhero movies implicitly say that a normal life is not worth telling a story about. That a regular life could not possibly be interesting - only epic battles for the future of humanity are interesting. That only superpowers make the hero interesting. It plays into the Great Man theory of history. It is an implicit \"neg\" to everybody. At the end of the day 'humanity' is saved, or 'the world' is saved - but *what is humanity?* That is the question art could be asking in the first place.\n\nWhat a more realistic art would do is reflect the average person, and the average life and glorify that, by bringing it alive on the big screen, and showing us how it has meaning. It would reflect our own realistic experiences back on us in new ways. It would show us why we do not need to be special to be important, why we do not need magic powers to be interesting, why we do not need to save the world to make a difference, why we do not need special effects and $200 million worth of scenery to have an interesting story. It would remind us that we are responsible for our own lives, families, and societies. That as adults living in a democracy, we are self-governing, and shoulder that responsibility without the possibility of escape. \n\nThe superhero frame is an authoritarian \"Big Man/Big Woman\" mentality. Think if how many superheroes are Kings or Queens of their own lands, or Gods. Wonder Woman. T'challa. Thor. It says what is important is OUT THERE in the stars, not down here. It takes value and puts it in a place far away from real life, far away from everyday experience.\n\nWhat realistic art does is celebrate and interpret the ordinary - a harder job for screenwriters, but one with a greater payoff. The viewer would not leave the theater thinking they are returning to their own dumpy life, but leave thinking of their own life in a way that makes it emotionally or aesthetically richer. It makes them happier and more appreciative to be themselves, rather than little and insignificant that they aren't some God or Monarch saving the world.\n\nFilmmakers today have lost themselves trying to run away from the small screen, thinking that only spectacle will justify getting people into theaters. But in the process they do a disservice to audiences and to society. ",

        "text": "I just saw 'Hold the Dark' and I absolutely loved it. These are thoughts I have copied over from r/movies and expanded upon. \n\n'Hold the Dark' presents it's core themes in the first act: especially so in Medora Sloane's line \"That's not the real Alaska\". What Medora is saying is that the people that live in their community live by a different standard. A different culture. The film is a deeply beautiful and disturbing exploration of two cultures - the people who live in civilisation, and the native and marginalised who live on it's outskirts. The film also explores the human necessity for violence and self protection. The theme of necessary violence is explored in the scene between Vernon and his son: \"People say killing is bad\" his son says, Vernon responds \"Yeah, you're gonna hear that a lot\".\n\nVernon and Medora are siblings that love one another, and have a inherently violent psychopathic nature. This is further explained when Russell Core says that Medora killed her son to \"Save him from the dark inside us, inside her and dark outside their window\"(sic).\n\nIt's plot is compelling and complex, especially if you listen to the muted and poetic dialogue. (By muted, I mean down-played and under performed).\n\nI'd also argue the large gunfight in the middle of the film isn't a 'action sequence' - it's a horror sequence. It's supposed to present the harrowing moments of a shooting spree, and how powerless people can feel during it. It also highlights the senseless nature of some of the violence (especially so when Core screams at the shooter to \"Just stop it!\").\n\nHold the Dark is one of the most interesting pieces of cinema I've seen in a long time, in a market so stacked with dreck it's kind of heart breaking.\n\nI had to weigh in on this film, as it's the kind of cinema I really want to see more of - I've been suffering a great deal of disillusionment with modern cinema, and it's works like this that give me hope.

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/jam1igont9p11.gif\n\n[https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/28/good-time/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/28/good-time/)\n\nIt’s amazing how a city can come alive at night, pulsing with an electric vitality much like that of the human heart. Lights flicker in the sky and alongside busy streets like millions of curious, blinking eyes. Heavy traffic honks and hums in constant waves while citizens and tourists crowd the air with vigorous chatter. Dwelling beneath this proud, ostensibly beautiful veneer is a level of raw and unforgiving intensity with a cruel penchant for devouring weary people. This same relentless anxiety fills the frames of Good Time, one of the finest films of 2017. Directed by virtuoso brothers Josh and Benny Safdie, this thrilling caper gifts us incredibly magnetic characters on a strange odyssey through New York that quickly spirals into a perilous, neon-painted nightmare.\n\nNick Nikas (Benny Safdie), stares at the floor in his therapist’s office. He has a history of violent behavior and his developmental disabilities prevent a full understanding of the brutal reality he lives in. In stomps Connie Nikas (Robert Pattinson), the unpredictable older brother. He cuts Nick’s session short and hastily whisks him out the door, labeling the shrink’s methods as nothing but toxic nonsense. Connie believes the city is poisoning them both and to truly be free, they need to get out fast. But a fresh start is always expensive, so Connie convinces Nick to mask up and help him rob a bank.\n\nWith stolen cash in tow, their escape unfolds quite easily until the moment a dye pack explodes inside the bag, clouding the entire backseat of their getaway car. It instantly blinds the driver, who then panics and slams into a long line of vehicles waiting for a red light to turn green. The brothers bail out the back doused in a thick shade of magenta. Minutes after taking refuge in the bathroom of a pizzeria, they shuffle down the empty sidewalk in new clothes, passing brownstones and parked cars hoping to blend in with the neighborhood regulars. When a cop tries to flag them down, Nick panics and dashes off. Connie has no choice but to follow. A Friedkin-esque foot chase ensues, resulting in Nick’s capture and eventual incarceration at Riker’s Island.\n\nKnowing his brother can’t endure jail for long, Connie hits the pavement on a frantic quest to set Nick free. First he enlists the aid of his fragile, dependent girlfriend Corey (Jennifer Jason Leigh). When he deceptively convinces her to charge Nick’s bail to her mother’s credit card, we get the feeling he’s exploited this weakness before. The massive transaction then fails and her mom calls to intervene. Corey shrieks agony and embarrassment into the phone, unmasking the full extent of her debilitating vulnerability. In this moment we realize just how easily Connie can manipulate others. His actions are filthy and despicable, but they’re not without legitimate purpose. The sympathetic portrait of his difficult, often foolish decisions begs the audience to work a bit harder in casting judgement. Rather than writing Connie off as just another scumbag, we’re challenged to empathize and quietly ask ourselves, “How would I react in the face of such overwhelming adversity? What would I sacrifice to save someone I love?”\n\nConnie discovers Nick was savagely beaten in prison and is currently recovering in the secure wing of a nearby hospital. He ditches Corey without hesitation and decides to sneak in under the guise of a tired visitor with an ailing father. When the guard on duty leaves for a snack, Connie hurriedly rescues a mangled man hidden beneath a wad of bloody bandages. To elaborate on what transpires next would spoil the film’s exhilarating final act. Let’s just say it involves infiltrating an amusement park and an elusive bottle of Sprite spiked with LSD.\n\nIn terms of pacing, Good Time glides with unparalleled rhythm. The cuts are often patient and precise with long, lingering takes and intimate closeups. Other sequences jump with rapid abandon, requiring the viewer to focus or risk getting left behind. Editors Benny Safdie and Ronald Bronstein achieve something extraordinary with this meticulous technique. It’s rare for a film to make the spectator feel the exact same emotions as the protagonist, but here we have no choice. The character’s urgency is transferred to the audience with the help of a dominant, singular point of view. We feel Connie’s anguish, we share his looming fears, and each time a new predicament diverts his progress, we’re right there wondering what he’ll do next.\n\nThough the editing is paramount to the film’s unique visual style, the outlandishly brilliant soundtrack is the thread that sews the story together. Oneohtrix Point Never’s composition triumphs with ingenious arrangements that bulge with emphatic dream waves and throbbing cosmic synth. His gritty, hair-raising harmonies glimmer with the DNA of legendary film composers like Jonny Greenwood, John Carpenter, Goblin, and Tangerine Dream. Much like the work of these musical giants, ONP’s eccentric sounds enhance the complex cinematic world envisioned by the filmmakers, unraveling profound depths that might otherwise go unnoticed.\n\nThe Safdies are firmly indebted to a cast of stellar supporting actors who bring vicious flavor to their project. Standout Buddy Duress, who first starred in the brothers’ 2014 film Heaven Knows What, fills his scenes with skittish realism, stealing the spotlight with Ray’s incessant complaining and riveting flashback monologue. Leigh is sharp and heartbreaking as Corey despite her tragically short screen time. Barkhad Abdi disappears into another brief but striking role as a security guard named Dash who tries to nab Connie and Ray but only ends up busting himself. Newcomer Taliah Webster is also quite impressive as a teenager unknowingly implicated in a dangerous game, left to silently ponder like a confused member of the audience who abandoned her seat and wandered into the movie. This diverse array of talent is foundational to the overall function of the narrative. The actors boldly take charge and create magnificent characters who occupy dysfunctional families and fractured communities, underlining the very same hardships the Nikas brothers hope to evade. \n\nIn the creation of Good Time, Benny Safdie occupied a legion of duties—co-directing, co-editing, and sound mixing—but a wistful performance as Nick Nikas is his most remarkable contribution. Due to a lack of opportunity for mentally challenged actors, an argument against his casting would be fair and understood, but it would fail to recognize the gripping compassion and respect Safdie brings to the character. His rendering of Nick isn’t a simple caricature but a thunderous portrayal summoned from deep within his soul. With a gruff voice and deeply inquisitive eyes, Safdie perfectly embodies a man eroded by pain and indifference, searching for peace in a ruthless universe. \n\nThe true champion of this film, however, is none other than Pattinson, in a nearly incognito exhibition of supreme acting ability. Any doubts surrounding his leading-man capabilities are eradicated with his work in this film. He commands the screen with great control, slithering and slanting through New York like a chameleon, constantly shapeshifting to adapt and survive. Pattinson’s fearlessness helps to convey every ripple of Connie’s suffering and every burn of his scorching desire for a better life. His monumental star-power has been undeniable since the Twilight era, but with Good Time, Pattinson bravely proclaims to the world of cinema that his fascinating career is just getting warmed up. \n\nThe Safdie brothers, along with their valiant circus of collaborators, have succeeded in crafting a bizarre slice of colorful pulp-noir. Their sizzling frames shout with a merciless energy similar to Sidney Lumet’s Dog Day Afternoon or Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver. At the end of great films like these, we’re stuck with questions that don’t necessarily yield concrete answers. We’re unable to put these films away after the credits. They linger and sting until we watch them again and again, peeling back each and every layer to see what may be hiding underneath. Good Time possesses this same endearing spirit. It’s a hypnotic masterpiece that will lure you in and never let you go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

        "text": " \n\n[Beau Travail](https://i.redd.it/fthlgw3wz8p11.jpg)\n\n&gt;*‘sert la bonne cause et meurt’ (serve the good cause and die)*\n\n**D**espite being adapted from a 19th century novella,[Beau Travail](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/29/beau-travail/) is an incredibly cinematic work that explores questions of memory, identity, and sexuality, all through the language of the visual image. Directed by Claire Denis, the French filmmaker whose authorial style spans numerous genres, *Beau Travail* is arguably her most significant film in terms of her status as an auteur. Set in the ex-French colony of Djibouti, *Beau Travail*shares similar themes to Denis’ early work; namely, the conflict of post-colonial French identity and the relationship between the body and the land. However, in *Beau Travail* these themes are woven into the very fabric of the film’s stylistic and narrative construction, resulting in a much more experimental and visceral approach to these recurrent reflections and concerns. The film speaks through its images, expressing those emotions that are too difficult to convey through words alone. \n\nStarring Denis Lavant as Sergent Galoup, a senior figure among a small band of French Legionnaires stationed in Djibouti, *Beau Travail* is not only narrated by Galoup, but the on-screen images and events are recalled from his own memory. In what serves as an unconventional circular narrative, the opening scenes serve as visualisations of Galoup’s memory as he reflects on his time as a Legionnaire and the events leading up to his court-martial. Interestingly, these visualisations emerge from Galoup’s own words as he writes his memoirs alone in his Marseille apartment. Memories turn into words, words turn into images, and a cinematic narrative is constructed around these dreamlike vignettes.\n\n \n\nWhile Galoup himself is present in many scenes—thus supporting his memory of these events—there are also scenes in which he is absent and would have had no recollection of their occurrence. For example, when a Legionnaire played by Grégoire Colin is rescued from the desert by a group of Djiboutian herders. Ultimately, the viewer is unable to separate the events that transpire on-screen from Galoup’s own subjective point of view. Galoup’s story is not only being told but he is the one telling the story. However, as Galoup finishes his memoirs and the past becomes the present, he loses all sense of agency and control. Galoup is the master of his own narrative, but once his story has been told he is lost and alone.\n\nThis is where Denis’ ability to imbue her characters with life and meaning is most apparent. The film’s ending sequence begins with Galoup routinely making his bed before lying on it topless, clutching his pistol. Unlike in Galoup’s flashbacks/memories, there is a palpable sense of calm as the camera focuses on different parts of his body. A hand, a tattooed chest, an arm, each shot pulsating with life like the vein that marks the film’s final beat.\n\n From this apparent end the film transitions to a shot of Galoup dancing alone in the Djibouti club frequented by the legionnaires. Dressed all in black and smoking a cigarette, Galoup dances wildly against the mirrored backdrop in a moment of pure expressive ecstasy. The film grants Galoup one final dance, an unseen moment of freedom and relief for this tortured soldier. \n\n [Beau Travail](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/29/beau-travail/) is Denis’ masterpiece, and few of her other films have come close to replicating its cinematic approach to life and the human condition. In terms of authorship, it is Denis at her most expressive, hypnotic, and oneiric. Like the themes and questions it explores, *Beau Travail* is difficult to explain but readily felt. \n\n[High Life Review](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/16/high-life/)",

        "author": "Carlito148",
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/9jyxnz/heres_an_analysis_i_wrote_out_for_mandy_theres/",
        "text": "link to video analysis/explanation: https://youtu.be/VlJZBXlbmm0\n\nmy write up:\n\nMandy is an art-house horror film directed by Italian-Canadian director Panos Cosmatos and stars the legendary man himself Nicholas Cage.  In my original review for Mandy, I gave it a rating of a 7.8 because I felt that was the fairest objective assessment of the film. But if I were to just give it a full on personal grade, I would give it an 8.5 or even a 9. It’s stunning visuals and overwhelming score created such an immersive and unique aesthetic piece of filmmaking that gave me a theatre experience that I’ll never forget. One of my main critiques of the film was that its second half didn’t seem as smooth or thought out  as the first half of the film once it switches gears into badass nick cage mode. And I still feel this way, but the high-level entertainment value we get from the second half is impossible to ignore, and there is still surprisingly plenty of things to analyze and discuss concerning the second half. In this video, I’m not going to waste much time explaining the entire plot and story. I’m simply going to attempt to analyze and explain elements of the film that I felt were thematic , confusing, or just straight up ambiguous.  \n\nI guess I’ll begin by discussing the character themes starting with Mandy who is played by the actress named Andrea Riseborough, who by the way was brilliantly casted. Mandy is supposed to represent a grounded and confident character who is comfortable with her identity despite her experiencing some dark and twisted things as a child. The point of having that long scene of her telling her husband Red, played by Nick Cage, about her haunting memory from her childhood where her father gathered up birds in a sack and made children bludgeon them into the dirt, is to convey this very notion about her character. This would also probably explain her attraction to more darker, edgy and gothic forms of art which ranges from Everything from her music taste to her literature preferences. But again, despite her personality being wrapped up in more darker forms of art, she is a genuine and grounded person who understands that the universe does not revolve around her. Now Jeremiah, the villain cult leader in the film, played by Linus Roache who gives a rather demanding performance here, is basically the exact opposite of Mandy.  Jeremiah is a highly insecure narcissist who has convinced himself that he is the center of everything that matters and deserves absolutely anything and everything that he could possibly want.  He has literally created a religious cult where the entire objective revolves around his followers worshipping him in order to gain some sort of higher purpose for themselves. Now what triggered him to start this cult is a combination of a few different factors that I’ll get into here in just a second. \n\nThe scene where Jeremiah and his cult pass Mandy on the road is such an immersive moment in the film and it also conveys a lot about jeremiahs character in a subtle way through its use of aesthetics. The scene is shown entirely within the perspective of Jeremiah. Theres a red color tint that conveys the sinister motive and personality of Jeremiah while also foreshadowing the evil that has yet to befold onto Mandy. The use of slow motion and zoom fades is used to convey Jeremiahs new unhealthy and obsessive infatuation with Mandy. But we soon learn, that he picked the wrong person to obsess over.\n\nSo moving forwards towards Mandys abduction, both the youngest and the eldest of the women in Jermiahs cult, hold her down as they drop some sort of drug in her eyeball and sting her in the neck with what looks like an enormous wasp like creature. This is obviously done with the intention to induce her into a drugged up trance like state because 1.) it reduces her motor skills and sense of direction which makes it very difficult for her to escape and 2,) it makes it much easier to brainwash someone when they’re state of mind is altered to that kind of level. Mandy wakes up to Jermiah speaking to her as his cult lays around and props him up. This scene where Jeremiah introduces himself to Mandy is shot entirely from Mandys perspective and is  probably my favorite scene in the entire film. Not only does is it achieve an immserve, psychedelic, and unsettling aesthetic by its captivating and hypnotic execution, But it naturally tells us so much about Jeremiahs character and also Mandy’s. We learn that he is a washed up failed musician because he plays his own music for Mandy as he consistently gloats about it. He describes his music sound as “the carpenters except better” and goes on to blame every possible thing as the reason for his failures; which again, conveys to us how much of a psychopathic self absorbed narcissist he is. If that’s not enough, he goes on to claim that he heard the voice of God while he was in depressed turmoil due to his previous failures, and God told him that everyone was wrong about him and that he is an ultimate prophet worthy of everyones worship and deserves absolutely anything that he could possibly want. We then get a sustained close-up shot of jeremiahs face as he attempts to brainwash her into joining his cult. We can see Mandys face slowly morph and fade in and out of Jeremiahs face throughout the duration of the scene. This is happening because again because Mandy is on some sort of hallucinogenic drug and it symbolically represents how his followers ultimately see themselves in his image. And the reason why his followers get persuaded and brainwashed into worshipping is because of a few reasons. The first one being that their state of mind is altered by drugs when it occurs. And the second one being that they are not confident enough in their identity and are seeking some sort of meaningful purpose in their life. This is honestly the case with most people who are super dug into a cult or a religion. Jeremiah exposes himself in front of Mandy and flaunts himself in hopes that she would be wooed by him. Mandy asks for reassurance that the song playing was made by him. After Jeremiah gives her the reassurance, she begins to chuckle at him as her laugh gets gradually more intense until she eventually is straight up mocking him through loud and genuine laughter. Jeremiah tries to get off to it but fails as Mandy continues to laugh right in his face which is a narcissists absolute worst nightmare. Jeremiah obviously becomes extremely angered by this and the next scene we get a very telling shot of him in the mirror that tells us even more about his character and about the overall theme regarding religion and cults. He looks at himself in the mirror with an intense look of desperation and insecurity as he repeats lines “tell me what to do” over and over and over and over again. He then gets a revelation as his face turns from desperate to confident again and states “never doubt yourself again”. What this tells us about Jeremiah, and really just narcissism in general, is that narcissism is used as a defense mechanism for people who are extremely weak, insecure, and lost in terms of who they are. His arrogance and confidence is a façade based on a delusion that he brought on himself due to his inability to cope with the failures that come with life. I believe that Jeremiahs character also serves as an assessment and critique of religious and cult mentalities. I believe that the reason the film goes out of its way to show Jeremiah look at himself in the mirror, is to show us where divine revelations truly come from. Yourself. It shows you that people will hear whatever they want to hear in order to make themselves feel special and more important than what they really are in order to cope with reality and/or to obtain something that they want. Whether its power, sex, attention, purpose, or everything in between. \n\n   Moving on the next scene where Jeremiah confronts a tied up Nick Cage, he tries to prove a point to him about how the love that he has for Mandy is nowhere near the level of love that his followers have for him. He grabs the youngest woman follower and convinces her to Russian roulette herself as a demonstrative gesture of her love for him. But that obviously isn’t something that we would call true love. The right words would be unhealthy obsession. And again, this to me is an analogous critique of a religious/cultist mentality because the love for God described by deeply religious people resembles much of the same kind of unconditional and obsessive love for a being that they see on a much higher level than themselves. Mandy is then put in a sack, hung up on a tree, and burned alive as poor Nick Cage is forced to watch. Now this is where the first half of the film basically ends and the action revenge horror comedy approach commences as Nick Cage begins to gear up for badassery. So imo, the film gives you less to analyze compared to first half but there are some element here in the second half that are still worth reading into and analyzing. \n\nAfter witnessing the tortuous death of his wife, he attempts to pass out but he experiences one of many animated Nightmares of Mandy and wakes up startled. We then get what I believe will become an iconic scene of Nick Cage caging out in the bathroom. As a nick cage aficionado, it was impossible to resist the urge to chuckle when he began screaming and yelling, but as the seen goes on, it becomes much more emotionally deep and dark as his screaming and yelling turns into grievous sobbing and despair. This is the moment where Cage has given up on any kind of moral standard he established for himself. He’s gone back to drinking again and his only focus is avenge the death of mandy.. in of course in the most badass B movie Bruce Campbell-esque way. \nCage meets up with an old acquaintance of his that specializes in making weapons. His friend states that its been a long time since he’s seen him which is indicator that Cage’s character used to be an experienced hunter but has stopped ever since he met Mandy. Cage explains to his friend about the hell he just endured including the death of Mandy. His friend begins to give him some information regarding a drug epidemic that has been plaguing the area and about how he thinks its somehow connected to a freaky biker gang, which is supposed to be the same freaks who helped kidnap Mandy. It then cuts to a scene of Cage crafting a giant scythe looking weapon that is intentionally executed in slow motion to try and give it a sense of badassery… and it was kinda badass. \n\nSo im gonna go ahead and fast forward to Cages one on one fight with the porn watching cocaine snorting freak. At this point of the film, he’s already killed two of the mutant looking biker dudes. One with an arrow on the dirt road and the other one he threw into the abyss. We see this big monstrous dude snorting a pile of coke as hes watching pornography. To me, this is supposed to be a clue as to what these mutant humanoids are supposed to be and represent. After Cage has his badass moment and kills the mutant, he dips his finger in a jar of liquid that he saw the mutant chugging, and dabs a tiny drop of it on his tongue. And just that tiny amount causes him to freak out and have a quick existential trip.  \n\nAt this point, I’ll go ahead and attempt to lay out my theory about what these mutant characters are, what they’re supposed to represent, and how the drugs are tied into all of this. So at first I thought these mutant bikers were something more alien and otherworldly, but considering the fact that this one is doing drugs and watching pornography, it seems clear that these are just disgusting human beings. The symbolic reason as to why these bikers exteriors are so mutated and disgusting is because that’s exactly what they are on the inside. Their exterior is a metaphorical representation of their moral character. Their supposed to just be sick sadistic torturers, murderers, sexual predators, or really just rapists in general. The gruesome image that we see later of a guy dead on the bed with a bloody bum, is clear evidence of that. Now how these freaks were able to physically take this mutant form is a little trickier but I think I have a decent explanation for that as well. And this explanation also naturally ties back to the cult leader Jeremiah and gives a little more depth to his character as well. So for me, the drugs are all responsible for this.  Not just any drug though. It’s a super drug concocted by some hick with his own little meth lab that Cage eventually confronts. But its obviously an extremely potent and powerful hallucinogen to an immeasurable degree. And remember the mutants were seen completely chugging entire jars of this stuff. So my theory is that these biker mutants were abusing the drug to an extremely unfathomable degree and this is what is causing their bodies to mutate into who they actually are.  Jeremiah has also been using the super drug which served as a catalyst to him getting the idea to start a cult. Giving hallucinogens to a self absorbed narcissist who apparently fails to take any accountability for his failures, is a horrible idea. This also goes back to the idea of what the truth behind what religious revelation actually is. There are a lot of people who claim to have been given a revelation from a higher being while being on hallucinogens, but every revelation that is revealed has to do with an idea that they were already aware of before hand and had some sort of interest in. This shows that the probability of a revelation coming from something higher or divine is much much lower than the probability of the revelation coming from themselves or their subconscious. This is the central theme of the film or at least the theme of the villain that conveys the notion of revelation being a mere product of or own mental/moral outlook, personhood and circumstance. Jeremiah and his cult is a grand display of this theme. \n\nCage confronts the super drug cook and he does actually end up giving him info on the whereabouts of Jeremiah. And to me, there seems to be an obvious metaphor when it shows him letting the tiger out of its cage which symbolizes cages thirst for vengeance. \nCage confronts Jeremiah in his secret chapel and this is where the film goes back to the pace and style that was established in the first half. He throws the cut off head of the old lady who was one of his most devout followers, and Cage slowly approaches him as Jeremiah knows that he is completely cornered. Jeremiahs narcissism is clearly apparent because all he does is yell and rant about how great he is. But once Cage gets really close and gets a firm grip on his head, jeremiah cowers under the pressure and once again shows how much of a weak human being he is. And even goes as far to offer felacio services *insert clip*. But then his narcissism comes back real quick and in full force as he demands for Cage to kneel for him . Thus further proving that his narcissism is a defense mechanism used as a means to deny his insecurity and weakness due to his tragic life failures. So cage ends up squeezing his head until his skull crushes and eyes pop out.  \nWe then get an astonishing shot of Cage walking away from the pyramid shaped chapel that is burning in flames. This to me is expressing a symbolic meaning through its aesthetics that conveys the sinister nature of religion while also showing the destruction of it in the film. It’s shaped like a pyramid to emphasize the pyramid scheme like nature of religion that is intentionally designed to scam everyone on the bottom out of their time and money while only those at the top of the pyramid reap the benefits.\n\nThe last few minutes of the film is shot entirely from Nick Cages perspective. As Cage drives off after successfully and satisfyingly completing his act of vengeance, we get a quick flashback of him looking at Mandy from afar at a rock concert. This is where I presume Mandy and Cages character Red first met.  He looks over at the passenger seat as he sees a hallucination of Mandy sitting next to him and grinning. He gives her a smile back and continues to drive into the night. The camera pans up as it shows what seems to be planets or moons in the night sky. This ending to me is basically Nick Cage being able to finally reach his happy place after fulfilling his thirst for vengeance.  Earlier in the film, they have a conversation together about space and planets and Mandy mentions that her favorite planet is Jupiter. So in Cages mind, his heaven is to be alone with the love of his life on her favorite planet which happens to be juptier. This is why the last shot decided to convey that they’re on another planet. They’re not really on another planet, but through our main characters perspective, he feels that he is. \n\n\n",

        "text": "Yeah I know that Twin Peaks is a TV show, but I don't think there is a show in existence that is more cinematic and Lynch even said that it is more of an 18 hour movie than a show so I think this belongs here. Anyway, most analyses of the series that I've read focus on interpreting what actually happens in the show but I think that to David Lynch and Mark Frost, the subtext meaning is much more important. Most of Lynch's films are based on abstractions/metaphors that reveal a deeper meaning when they are contemplated. Eraserhead is really about the anxiety of becoming a father, Blue Velvet is about the corruption of innocence, Mulholland Drive is about the connection between cinema and dreams, and Inland Empire is about the relationship between the performer and the audience (ok these films are very layered and there is certainly more to them than this but I see these as prominent overarching themes)\n\nBecause of it's length and many layers, Twin Peaks is harder to nail down. The film Fire Walk With Me, and many episodes reveal a statement about the nature of evil; where it comes from and how it is maintained. This is shown especially in part 8 as we learn that the questionable construction of the atomic bomb which would bring pain and suffering to millions opened up a doorway between our world and the realm of evil forces. This may show the responsibility that people have had in maintaining a cycle of evil. However, I think that the true theme of the Return isn't shown until the last few hours. This is where the series connects back to the idea of trauma that was shown so powerfully in Fire Walk With Me. In these episodes we see characters purposefully or inadvertently returning to the past due to Cooper's hubris filled plan to change past events.\n\nIt appeared that Cooper was unable to change the past, but by trying to he forced himself and others to relive their trauma that perhaps would be best left alone. First of all, Sarah Palmer,by staying in that same house drinking her life away seemed to allow negativity (Judy- \"An extreme negative force\") to consume her. I think that Audrey faced major trauma in the bank explosion and then in being raped by evil Coop so she constructs a fantasy in her head which leads her back to her \"dance\" and then a recognition of the unsettling truth of what happened (she appears to end up in a hospital, maybe she was unable to ever move on from what had happened to her). Diane was also raped by Coop and is forced to relive the experience by having sex with him again (in a sex magic ritual?) which completely fractures her identity and turns her into someone else (Linda). Cooper finds that he is unable to bring Laura \"home\" and defeat the forces of evil; he finds that he fails again and relives the trauma of failing to rescue Caroline, Annie, and Maddy ; while messing with these forces also prevented him from having a normal life and loving family that he gets to catch a glimpse of while he lives as Dougie Jones (what may have happened if he was able to accept his past and move on). Finally, and perhaps most significant of all Laura's death is prevented but she loses her agency and choice, and when she is taken to her mother's home she is forced to relive her history of abuse and suffering which may have been blissfully forgotten.\n\nNone of these characters were able to change or escape their past and it results in further pain, suffering, and heartbreak. I think there is a somewhat spiritual message in there about things being \"meant to happen\", that changing the past is impossible for reasons we can never truly understand. The show portrays a kind of answer to the mysteries of life through a metaphor of powerful spirits (Judy, The Fireman, etc.) in other realms that control us; that human lives and emotions can be trapped up in a cosmic chess game between the forces of good and evil. I think what Lynch and Frost are trying to say is that maybe traumas and tragedies happen for a reason that is beyond our comprehension. Cooper is never able to grasp this concept as he keeps trying to assert some control over what is outside his ability and understanding. In the Dougie Jones section, we see that Cooper can still have a great life and that there is so much good he can do but he just cant let go of the past and in the end is doomed to repeat it (much like Scottie Ferguson in Vertigo).\n\nNow on another level the show is also making a very \"meta\" statement that reflects Lynch and Frost's feelings on returning to the show itself. They knew they could never capture the same feeling or nostalgia of the original show (like a lot of other shows tried to: Full House, Roseanne, etc.)  and they poke fun at that idea several times (James' song, Audrey's dance, Norma's discussion on pies, etc.). There's a reason why Gordon Cole, being played by David Lynch is asked \"Who is the dreamer?\" It's clearly him. But to Lynch, the heart of the show was always Laura Palmer and the only way to bring her back at this point was to literally prevent her death. But of course, doing that would only further the pain and suffering of the character that he loved so much. Again, the past can never really be changed no matter how hard you try. I also think Cooper is supposed to be a stand-in for the audience; He thinks he's got it all figured out, he wanted every question to be answered and every issue to be resolved but it's not meant to be, just like in real life.",

Looking back at the low-budget/indie breakthroughs of the 90s and 2000s (El Mariachi, Paranormal Activity, Blair Witch Project, Clerks), that just doesn't seem to happen anymore. There are simply no zero budget films (under $100,000)  this year that have broken any new careers or made millions at the box office, and it really discourages me. The energy of the 2000s indie film scene seemed so different, and I just don't feel that feeling that anyone with a great idea and work ethic can become a great director anymore.  Where is that support and breakthrough energy today?

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/9jsom5/my_thoughts_on_how_fargo_1996_tackles_popular/",
        "text": "Fargo makes for an interesting viewing experience, and requires the full attention of the audience to truly understand its intentions.  Although the film has all the conventions of a typical murder film, everything is done in a way that subtly defies other similar films in the genre.  Through the use of subversion and common cinematic expectations, Fargo cleverly addresses popular clichés and stereotypes found in mainstream cinema.\n\nA popular cinematic cliché is addressed right from the very beginning of the film.  During the opening screen, it is declared that Fargo is based on a true story.  This however is entirely factual, as nothing in the film was inspired from an actual event.  This is the first strategy employed by the directors to suggest to the viewers that everything in the film may be different from what we believe them to be.\nThe Coen brothers also address the issue of gender stereotypes through the portrayal of Marge as a female cop.  Although the typical stereotype of a police investigation involves male cops as leaders, Marge is in fact the lead cop, which is even more surprising given that she’s pregnant.  Furthermore, her pregnancy does not prevent her from doing her job and is not even a big deal.  This stereotype is then exploited when Marge looks into the gruesome murder and then appears to be sick and ready to vomit.  This is done intentionally because it is easy for the viewers to see this development and infer Marge is sick because of what she saw.  However, it is revealed that Marge felt sick due to morning sickness stemming from her pregnancy.  An active audience realizes this was done deliberately by the director in attempt to prod the viewer to challenge popular stereotypes.  Scenes such as this show how this film plays on moments of subversion, in which things that seem usual are twisted.  This in turn causes popular and common notions to fall apart, and also pushes the balance of expectation.\n\nA specific trick the directions use to achieve their intentions is the use of framing.  When Jerry has a discussion with Wade and Stan about a potential investment, the viewer is able to spot each character’s predicament via their respective background and setting.  When Stan speaks, he is surrounded by a round table, which emphasizes his role as the accountant and bookkeeper of the group.  Wade is framed by a picture of a lion next to a Native American and cowboy replica, which further proves the point that he is in full control of the situation in its entirety.  In contrast, Jerry is framed by two metal bars and a window, which suggests that he is stuck in limbo and is trapped within the crisis he brought upon himself.  After Jerry looks down and has nothing else to say, an unusual design is in the next shot.  This shot is of Jerry’s car parked in isolation, and it resembles an abstract painting.  It is implied that this shot is what Jerry is looking down at.  The camera observes a black spec (Jerry slowly making his way to the car), which strongly insinuates Jerry is one with the scene, and translates how he feels about himself.  This is an example of what the viewer expects and is trying to see, and is also done to undermine our trust in images.\n\nAnother popular cliché is referenced when the two criminals kidnap Jean.  The Coen brothers include all the popular elements of a kidnapping scene, such as the robbers wearing ski masks, and the unknowing victim shrieking around the house when she knows what’s about to happen.  However, instead of the scene having a traditional climax of conventional cinema to show powerful characters, this is unproven.  Jean is caught is spite of the lackluster efforts of the two criminals.  All characters involved in this scene show some degree of incompetence. \n\nThe Coen brothers make particular use of certain cinematic techniques in order to further engage and involve their audience.  This is seen in the scene when Jerry comes home to find his wife missing.  The camera closely examines traces of the violence that occurred.  This is done to emphasize how careless Jerry is, as the machine cares more about what happened as opposed to Jerry.  However, the viewer can finally sympathize and take solace with Jerry, as he sounds terribly distraught when calling his father-in-law to tell him of the kidnapping.  The viewer then realizes this is a farce though, and the image of Jerry rehearsing his phone call is contrasted with empty stairs in a split screen.  This again challenges the viewer to be vigilant when watching cinema, and also reminds us how the performance in this scene is similar to having both a stage and a backstage (or an act, and an act behind the act).\n\nBy having characters break rules and rigidities, it is made obvious how many rules we as a society have to follow.  In a sense, it is seductive for the viewer to relate to the bad guy to see if he will prevail.  However, none of that succeeds in this film, as there is a blurred line between good and evil, and frustrated characters are all faced with a reality they can not keep under control.  This film challenges viewers to identify and look past common stereotypes of cinema, and even beyond film in general.  It tells the viewers to be vigilant to things that seem ordinary.",

I feel like if they at least never show the monster or completely cut out the sub plot and reworked the script it would have been a much better movie, that’s just my opinion though \n\nEdit: I want to add that while I get the design of the critter himself is a nod to classical cinema especially with the scene of him appearing in the Melies movie Faust in Hell, it doesn’t make for a very compelling design, just kind of a guy in white face paint with a hat, it’s the jaws effect, the less you show the monster the scarier it becomes, it would have been nicer if they never showed you what he actually looked like and instead made you guess as to whether or not anything was going on \n\nSomething I did like was the raspy voice that signaled his presence ",

Part of his argument was that all of the individual parts were well done and therefore the whole is a masterpiece. This got me wondering, when do films that should be good based on all the individual parts not fulfill the requirements to be considered \"good\"?\n\nAre there films where, although the acting, direction, writing, editing, music, production design, costumes, etc. are all well done but ultimately the film fails on the whole? I was thinking that films coming from the studio system might more likely land in this category as everyone hired has proven their talent on some level, but then there's some missing component that you can trace back to the writing, or executives getting involved, or similar.\n\nFor some, Star Wars The Last Jedi might be an example of this. Personally, I would say the Les Mis movie would be it for me. The actors had great performances, the music was arranged well, and Hooper's choice of live singing was smart but the close ups and intimacy didn't always work.\n\nAre there examples that you can think of, and why is it that this film (if it can't be generalized to all films) with great individual components ended up being \"bad\" in your opinion?",

        "text": "I saw Lizzie the other day because I though it looked interesting and I do think it was. It was a decently constructed movie that I thought was a good vehicle for the story but didn't really have much to say. The one thing that did stand out to me, though, is the framing of the shots. Throughout the entire movie almost every shot is either indoors (most of which are in the same house) or in the backyard of the New England mansion where the movie takes place. Even in the outdoors shots though there is no sky shown. In fact there are exactly two shots of the sky, and this is what I want to focus on.\n\nThere is a tradition in art of obscuring or hiding the horizon and the open sky above it as a way of \"trapping\" the inhabitants of the art. Two classic examples are [The Stone Breakers](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Gustave_Courbet_-_The_Stonebreakers_-_WGA05457.jpg) by Gustave Courbet and [The Floor Scrapers](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/Caillebotteraboteurs.jpg/600px-Caillebotteraboteurs.jpg) by Gustave Caillebotte (those are the English titles). In each painting we see laborers doing back-breaking work with little to no view of a horizon. In The Floor Scrapers you don't even see at eye level, the perspective is looking down the entire time.  In both, the characters cannot stand up without breaking the frame of the painting (ignore the child in The Stone Breakers), forcing them into their work, there is no escape.\n\nLizzie (2018) exhibits the same characterization through the cinematography. In brief, the movie is the story of Lizzie, the daughter of a wealthy financier (Andrew), and the housemaid Bridget who joins the family from Ireland. Both are controlled by the patriarch of the house in some way, Lizzie's financial future and freedom is determined by his decisions with his will and Bridget is repeatedly raped by him. At their breaking point, Lizzie and Bridget murder Andrew and his second wife.  As Lizzie is being held in prison charged with the murder of her father and step-mother, Bridget leaves the family, and the first shot of the sky is shown. Bridget is on a train heading to an Irish boarding house and is staring into a beautiful blue sky with scattered white clouds. The final two shots of the film following Lizzie's acquittal are of the sun in a clear blue sky (sky shot #2), and Lizzie standing outdoors soaking in the rays.\n\nEach of those shots, somewhat obviously (this is not a subtle argument I'm making), represent the freedom each character has acquired. Bridget is free of her assaulter and controlling host family, free from the crimes she co-conspired on, free from the perjury she committed, free from the entire situation. She looks into the sky towards a new future. Similarly, Lizzie is free from her controlling father in entirety. She not only ended his life but also burned the only copy of the will that took away her freedom, thereby preventing his post-mortem control. While most of the movie was entertaining enough, when the film ended with that final scene it hit me how I had only seen the sky in those two scenes and thought about it more. That insight elevated the movie in my mind and I think contributes to the feeling and emotion felt in the movie.\n\nAny thoughts? Or other movies that use their cinematography in manners similar (I think Ida (2013) did some stuff that was similar, but I don't remember enough to put it into a whole post, although I absolutely love that movie)?",

        "text": "I used to do a lot of writing about film, but I haven't been as inspired the past few years. That changed tonight. Here's the link on letterboxd if anyone wants to follow/like the review: https://letterboxd.com/sodhipop/film/assassination-nation/ \n\nAbout 30 minutes through this movie, I was already checking the time. I was quickly getting tired of the browbeating the movie was giving me about how Woke it was, while also turning things like trigger warnings into a kind of joke? I was getting tired of a movie where the main character was always The Smartest Person in the Room, and anyone she was talking to just Didn't Get It. I was getting tired of a movie revelling in self-indulgent sexualization, while at the same time pointing the finger at the audience for participating in said sexualization.\n\nIn fact, there was a scene that summed up my thoughts perfectly. The main character, Lily, was sent to the principal because she had drawn nude women in suggestive poses for her art project. When asked to explain herself, the character goes on a monologue about how what she was REALLY trying to convey with her art wasn't the sex itself, but the pain and insecurity *behind* the sex. The constant repositioning to hide imperfect features, the societal pressure of the madonna-whore complex, she was trying to get people to THINK, not just titilate them with pornography.\n\nWhen art requires an accompanying thesis to get it's point across, the artist probably hasn't done a good job. This is true of Lily and her drawings, and it was true of this film itself. The movie desperately wanted us to think it was About Something, but wanted to tell us instead of show us.\n\nBut still, I didn't dislike the movie exactly. It was super stylized and creative. Despite the obnoxious, cheaply cynical tone, I obviously agreed with the film's points even if I disagreed with the execution. I was torn. 2.5 stars. Maybe 3.5 if I'm in a good mood and it sticks the landing.\n\nYeah, about that. Never make your mind up before you finish a film.\n\nI watch a lot of movies. Not just a lot in number, but in variety. Nothing really shocks me anymore. So please keep that in mind when I say the following:\n\nAssassination Nation is the craziest fucking thing I have ever seen.\n\nThis thing UNLOADS in the final third. mother! felt like a walk in the park by comparison. And it's not just exhilarating, genre thrills like the long takes or neon lights or pulpy violence that make it such an experience. The film transitions into a full-on surreal allegory. With this transition came a change in my expectations. I finally caught up to where the film had been the entire time, slowly building and building towards an explosive finale. Sensory overload.\n\nIn the beginning of the film, I was put off by the unsubtle nature of the film. Fuck that. I was wrong. We do not live in subtle times. The time for subtlety is long past. We need to shout from the rooftops. And that is exactly what this film is. It's a reflection of the current state of the country that's cranked up to 11 and proceeds to blowout the speakers. A hand grenade alarm clock. You need to get up now.\n\nI haven't been this jarred by a film in a very long time. It's super reinvigorating. ",

        "text": "Hi everyone! I've watched Eraserhead today. (Never seen anything directed by Lynch before). I enjoyed it a lot and it did liven up a slow day at work.\n\nI have, however, several thoughts and a question regarding it.\n\nAside from maybe several scenes, the movie felt very comedic to me. There were quite a lot of moments where I had to stifle my laugh a little bit. Bill X's introduction, Mrs. X suddenly kissing Henry, Radiator Lady stomping those spermatozoids, Henry's head popping from his body, and, most of all, \"OK PAUL!!!\". This is not only a matter of individual scenes. As a whole, the plot seemed to me quite similar to an old-fashioned romantic comedy, if one were to ignore the surrealist passages: After a meet-the-parents gone awry and a sudden divorce, a likable but bumbling guy struggles to get by with his toddler. He tries to find consolation in a company of his beautiful neighbour, but only finds himself more confused and embarrassed. Everything goes disastrous when he tries to change the baby's diaper.\n\nWhat do you think about it? Would that interpretation be unsuitable for this movie?\n\nAnd my question is:\n\nIn the ending scene, the jumpcuts with the baby's head really do remind me of scenes in modern horror movies. Was that editing \"trope\" around in 1977 or did Lynch \"invent\" it?",

        "text": " \n\nOver the past week or so, I finally caught up with some of the David Lean masterpieces that I had missed in my youth. (Perhaps “avoided” is a more appropriate word for my relationship to the 4 hour long *Lawrence of Arabia*). Nobody can direct a massive, imperial epic like David Lean, with his wide and beautiful landscapes, the exotic locations and the racially insensitive casting of Alec Guinness. However, after over half-a-day in Lean runtime, I was compelled to return to the small world of *Brief Encounter*, to marvel at what he could do with a simple close-up. \n\nThe premise behind *Brief Encounter* is a simple one; A “happily married” woman (Laura - Celia Johnson) carries on a short, and ultimately unconsummated, affair with a married doctor (Alec - Trevor Howard) that she meets at a train station. We watch the affair run its course like a memory, with narration from Johnson acting like a silent confession to her husband, played with heartbreaking cluelessness by Cyril Raymond. So many of these narrations are partnered with close-ups of Johnson’s face… and what a face! Her big, bold eyes convey every thought we hear, and it’s plain to see the desperation and sadness in them if only her husband would take his nose out of his crossword puzzle to notice. One of my favorite shots (there are several excellent one to choose from) is a close-up of Laura on the train as she is on her way home from a day with Alec. They had just professed their love for each other, and she had a private moment in public, staring out the train window. She “didn't even pretend to read. \\[She\\] didn't care whether other people were looking at \\[her\\] or not.” We get this gorgeous shot of Johnson and her reflection in the train window as she then begins to daydream about Alec, with images of them dancing superimposed onto the window. In one shot, this composed, posh woman reverts to a teenage schoolgirl. The only thing surprising about Celia Johnson’s Oscar nomination for Laura is that it is her only one. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

This movie is The Greatest Showman of 2001 in the sense that it's a very good time, there's some nice songs that I like and there's some good actors on display. But, also like The Greatest Showman, it's littered with boring, overplayed cliches which made me bored to tears, and this wasn't helped by the paper-thin characters that lack any real characterisation and growth.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEwan McGreggor plays this broke ass writer (as if we haven't seen that before) whilst Nicole Kidman plays a damsel, who's wanted by the tweedy moustached rich man, who's really abusive when you think about it, like he's a borderline psychopath and nobody comments on it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll I know about McGreggors character is that he writes stuff sometimes and he wants to bone the hot girl, it's just bland and boring. What's his deepest desires? Why does he write? What makes Kidman's character so special to him? Who is he really? And these are the same questions that can be asked for \\*literally\\* and I do really mean literally every character in this film.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey're all just caricatures.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm gonna say this again but it just irritated me how the rich guy (they're all too forgettable to have names now) is just kinda a psychopath and was gaslighting, manipulating and attempting to \\*murder\\* Kidman and McGreggor's characters and nobody treats this as a big deal, they're all more focused on the boring love story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd also, the illness thing was dumb, cliched and underdeveloped, like what does Kidman actually have? Why should I care if you're gonna treat it so vaguely. You can't expect people to care about this stuff if it's just an underdeveloped plot point that's constantly forgotten about by the movie. I felt nothing when she died because the characters were so lazily written and two dimensional.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, if I \\*have\\* to be positive, they did covers of songs I like, which is nice I guess, and the production design was pretty but, honestly, this movie was horrible and I hated it.",

        "text": "(*I know it's a television series but in the US it was released theatrically, Fassbinder was an important filmmaker and I don't know of a better place to discuss about it.*)\n\nNot an easy series to go through unless you are German and/or a cinefile. I enjoyed it although I expected it to be better, probably due to high expectations. I think the intermediate era between the two world wars is a very interesting period in German history but very few filmmakers dare to explore it. Think of the countless world war films and documentaries, yet so few focus on the in-between. I expected something like Haneke's The White Ribbon, a story about regular people and the war being insinuated at, it was a bit like that but it mostly focused on the people's drama and it's up to the viewer's discretion how much the wars are involved.\n\nOn the positives, good production value, very good acting, good directing, good music and unpredictability. At no point in the series did I feel like I've seen this before or I know where this is going. After watching a lot of stuff that originality is precious.\n\nOn the negatives, there are some exciting moments/excellent scenes like when the protagonist gets out of prison, when he argues with socialists after selling nazi newspapers, him going on an alcohol binge... but the overall story isn't very appealing. I realise that to some extent that is intentional, to put the viewer through the desperation of the main character and the society he lives in but still, at 15 hours I feel like it needed some condensing. \n\nOn the more technical side, the picture quality was mediocre despite being from remastered blu rays. Additionally, although the spoken German sound beautiful and the Criterion subs were solid, I couldn't help but feel like some of the beauty gets lost in the translation.\n\n**Has anyone else watched it ? What are your thoughts ?**\n\nPS: If someone is interested in reading a bit more about it, here's a couple related excerpts I run into:\n\n&gt; Very long (15 hours in all), very worth seeing. Based on Alfred Doeblin's novel of the same name, \"Berlin Alexanderplatz\" is set in and around Berlin during the Weimar Republic era, the decade immediately preceding the establishment Hitler's Third Reich in 1933.\n\n&gt;The workers of '20s Berlin are taking it on the chin. Mass unemployment reigns alongside the greed of the landlord and capitalist classes. People are reacting and acting in various ways to survive. As usual, some of the unemployed turn to crime; others to prostitution. Most of the film's cast will see the dawn of the \"thousand year Reich\" with their eyes only half way open.\n\n&gt;But life must go on and it will go on and it does go on in Berlin during Weimar. It's an exciting time as well, a time when the puritanism of the countryside is being exchanged for a chance to live free and wild in a sleepless city chock full of cabarets and kniepe. Of course, the Nazis didn't like this and neither did their supporters, the conservative majorities of rural Germany.\n\n&gt;As the film's director,R.W. Fassbinder put it,Doeblin's novel,BERLIN ALEXANDERPLATZ, \"offered a precise characterization of the twenties; for anyone who knows what came of all that, it's fairly easy to recognize the reasons that made the average German capable of embracing his National Socialism.\"\n\n&gt;All this turmoil and potential for explosive change are seen by the audience of \"Berlin Alexanderplatz\" through the eyes of one guy, Franz Biberkopf. Walk, ride, rob, love, drink and despair with Franz Biberkopf. Best bring along a case or two of good lager while you're immersing yourself in the prelude to \"Gotterdamerung\".\n\n&amp;\n\n&gt;When Rainer Werner Fassbinder made Berlin Alexanderplatz in 1979/1980 for thirteen million DM, critics decried it as a gross misallocation of public funds. (The film was financed in part by the German public TV station, WDR.) But as Fassbinder pointed out in a 1980 interview, for its length of 15.5 hours that's cheap—and legend has it that he never shot more than two takes, of which he'd only print one to avoid the delay of watching rushes.\n\n&gt;Runtime is, unavoidably, the most discussed aspect of Alexanderplatz. Vincent Canby remarked in his review, \"One could be reasonably expected to read the book in the same period of time.\" I'm a slow reader, but it's hard to imagine anyone getting through Alfred Döblin's 400–600 page book (depending on the edition) that quickly. With regard to literary adaptations, instead of the truism \"The book is better,\" I like telling people, \"Watch the movie instead, it's shorter.\" [Ed. note: Mr. Bjorkenheim is co-owner of a bookstore.] I think this holds true even of Alexanderplatz—the novel is a slog. If you've found yourself struggling to get through it, don’t be ashamed; when Fassbinder first read it, he was so bored by the first 200 pages that he almost didn't finish it, and Günter Lamprecht had started and abandoned the book a few years before he was cast for the lead role.\n\n&gt;The story, which Fassbinder himself called \"incredibly banal\" and \"ludicrous,\" revolves around Franz Biberkopf, a former cement- and transport-worker and recent manslaughter convict who leaves prison and tries to become \"decent,\" only to be battered down time and again by Fate and capitalism.\n\n&gt;Insofar as it makes any sense to talk about the \"differences\" between an adaptation and its source, Berlin Alexanderplatz doesn’t have many. Fassbinder avoided introducing a \"modern consciousness\" of subsequent German history that would have framed Franz Biberkopf's involvement with the NSDAP as an ominous prelude to the Third Reich. Having written the novel in 1928, Döblin himself didn't know what the budding Nazi movement would eventually amount to. In Fassbinder's words, \"Döblin didn't like the Nazis much … Though he also didn't take them very seriously\"—Trump-dismissers be warned.\n\n&gt;Fassbinder thought his countrymen were woefully ignorant of German history, and his goal with Alexanderplatz was pedagogical. Although the parallels between the Weimar and Federal Republics are not explicitly presented, they make themselves felt through certain attitudes of the period that had started to reemerge fifty years later. \"I see citizens who'd rather have peace, order, and discipline again,\" he told an interviewer in 1980, \"and this in a society that in many respects is falling apart.\"\n\n&gt;Fassbinder didn't make the central square of Alexanderplatz itself into a major presence in the film. \"What Alexanderplatz really was can be shown just as well in other ways,\" he said, \"through the places which the people who are otherwise on Alexanderplatz or on the streets of Berlin flee to.\" Hence the emphasis on interiors, especially domestic ones. Otherwise, Fassbinder would have had to either reconstruct the Alexanderplatz of the 20s, or, another option he entertained, use Place de Pigalle in Paris or Times Square, which he felt were still places where \"the whole sociological structure of the population can be found.\" Unfortunately, this social layering was not to last; the taming of Forty-second Street soon began in earnest with the banning of peepshows in 1985. By the end of the 90s it was all over.\n\n&gt;Fassbinder's approach to technique was double-sided. On the one hand, he gave the film a conventional form in order to foreground the characters and the reality portrayed. His priority was to reflect the viewers' own conditions of life, not shock them into \"rejecting the whole thing at first sight\" (the way, say, Syberberg might). On the other hand, he refused to adopt television aesthetics, leading to notoriously dark scenes with characters barely visible as contours (a choice he justified with a none-too-modest comparison to Rembrandt) and deliberately unsuspenseful segmentation. For all that, the story—with its rackets, burglaries, and fascist-bashing—is pretty exciting, and Xaver Schwarzenberger’s camera dances around enough to keep you awake.",

        "text": "Thesis: Spike Lee's attempt to push a very important social issue backfires and cheapens his overall message in Blackkklansman\n\nFirst I state the obvious. Lee's use of group mentality and duality is very interesting. First, we have both groups contrastingly cheering/fighting for their side. While one side is clearly more correct than the other it is very interesting seeing that argument being pushed. That the only difference between these agendas is that one's goal is extremely racist and inherently evil. Where Lee falls short if his ending, which I believe cheapens that idea. The fact that Lee makes you consider, even for a second, the similarities between a racist group and a social action group really shows the importance of moral integrity. Where if the social action group were to slightly deviate in their message they could become the evil group. He follows up this great contrast with a smack in the face. A clip of white supremacist creating evil, which unless you’ve literally slept through the entire film let alone the past 100 years, you should clearly understand is wrong. The fact that Lee subtly suggests this point of duality the whole film just to then, \"dumb it down\" for the entire audience at the end, feels cheap to me. \n\nHe brought up an extremely interesting idea past that, that the more dangerous racism is the subtle hidden racism that has been embedded into our culture. He shows this with the images of Gone With the Wind at the beginning of the film. Unfortunately, I believe he also cheapens that message later on by putting so much emphasis on the smaller members of the Klan that want to blow up members of the black community. Example. To me, the scariest, and most dangerous, racist characters in the film is not the racist cop who pulls over Stallworth's girlfriend. Nor the KKK member who wants to use his wife as a bomb carrier. No, the scariest is David Duke himself and the head police chief. The fact that David Duke doesn’t speak with an overzealous hate, except when confronted, shows the fact that anyone could be just like them. Unlike the smaller members of the Klan, who are almost obviously racist in almost every scene. This is the true scare of blackkklansman, that a seemingly nice man on the surface could be the ultimate martyr for hate. You could run into David Duke and not even know that he truly is a monster, while the overzealous Klansman seems to be a cheap attempt to have a discernable bad guy of the film. Having a more subtle bad guy would have added more depth to his film, on top of that it could have added more emphasis to the theme. Throughout the film we see people hiding, crawling into smaller, and darker, spaces to hide their racism, and also their pride. We see most of the emotional confirmations take place in small rooms as if everyone is trying to hide. Capitalizing on the idea of deeply embedded racism that is hiding dormant in our community would have added to a more potent message than the obvious one that is shown towards the end of the film. That being, racism is wrong, racism is obvious, and it that there is no parallel between groups. This is the ending message Lee leaves up with by showing the clips of Charlottesville, completely overriding everything he brought up about duality and the importance of morality. The ending just turns into a blanket statement made to help people understand what they should have been able to pick up. \n\nplease don't kill me",

        "text": "[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NucvlxKl2c)\n\nA couple of years ago some coked up Hollywood executive got the crazy idea to pitch a Ben-hur remake for $100m. Needless to say, it flopped hard as anyone would expect.\n\nI’ve heard all sorts of theories as to why we often get mega-budget flops from the thought that the Hollywood suits really are that out of touch with what the public wants, to flops being necessary for tax return reasons, to some films being remake for the sake of holding on to certain rights.\n\nWhatever the reason, a $100m uninspired remake of a classic, doomed to fail from day one, saddens me because the studio could have got $100m they made off of a tentpole movie, designed solely to make money, to fund, say, 4 $25m films, 10 $10m films, or even 100 $1m films. The big studios have the power to greenlight a project with the click of a finger, to make a young, hungry director prove himself to the world, or for a veteran to be able to make his long-time passion project. Undoubtedly many poor films with low returns can easily be made from taking such risks, but who’s to a surprise hit like Halloween or The Blair Witch Project wouldn’t emerge, if the film-makers were just given the chance? It seems a fair investment, spreading the cost of $100m over several films, some which might flop and others which might not, or some made to pocket a bit of cash and others made purely for critical acclaim, then to put all your eggs in one basket with a $100m picture.\n\nThese kind of mid-budget movies, specifically mid-budget dramas, made from around $5-$50m, seem to be disappearing fast. So what kind of films am I talking about, first and foremost? Well, I’m mainly taking about the filmographies of directors such as David Cronenberg, David Lynch, Francis Ford Coppola, Brian DePalma, Barry Levinson, Spike Lee, John Waters and Walter Hill in their prime. You may have noticed that a fair few of the names mentioned, these auteurs, these men with voices and stories to tell, made their names during the Hollywood New Waves of the late 60s and early 70s, where power shifted from tight-fisted studios to creative young filmmakers, a movement which was ended by 1980s Heaven’s Gate. Today we are very much back into the studio dominant world of film-making in Hollywood, with companies like Disney having a terrifying hold of an incredible amount of properties. In fact, it seems today you go to the cinema to see a movie because it’s associated with a certain studio, like Marvel, Pixar, Disney, DC etc as opposed to directors. Of cause, big names such as Tarantino and Nolan are still major draws and can seemingly have any project pushed forward because of both their creativity but mainly bankability.\n\nIt’s something that actors and directors themselves have commented on plenty of times. Matt Damon believes mid-budget movies no longer exist and John Turturro has praised television for being the creative outlet for those frustrated by the movies of Hollywood.  A lot of the mid-budget directors of old have retired, others like Levinson have moved to TV which has grown massively since the turn of the century, with the likes of HBO blurring the lines between TV and film quality productions. There are some special cases of directors who have neither retired nor been pushed out to TV, such as Martin Scorsese, who has instead constantly adapted to the ever changing demands required to get projects off the ground. He has teamed up, for example, with Leonardo DiCapro for several projects since 2003, and the duos movies’ remain the only ones of his in the new century that have been financial success, with films like the passion project Silence litteraly taking decades to be made and when it was it vanished like a fart in the wind. His latest film, The Irishman, will be released on the steaming service Netflix who, like Amazon and television, are another outlet for film-makers looking to get movies made on their terms. At one time it would be considered laughable that a Scorsese picture starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino would not be picked up by a film studio, but we are now living in such a time.\n\nIt’s a real shame for film fans that the model changed over the years. I don’t mind these massive films, these superhero flicks and reboots. But it seems there’s a monopoly and a lack of variety when it comes to mainstream cinema. Whether you want to blame the studio’s greed for wanting to make a billion dollars off a single film and not settling for small profits, hence the influx of cinematic universe and movies designed to appeal to everyone imaginable from all countries, incorporating tried-and-tested story formulas, PG-13 age ratings, political correctness, risk-free plots etc and thus lacking any sort of individualism or creativity, whether you feel the talent pool has dried up and it’s harder for studios to find good directors now that seemingly anyone and everyone can make a film or whether it’s because of the massive recession the mid budget movies, on a grand scale, have gone.\n\nThere are still mid-budget dramas being made of course, but those mud-budgets have become ultra-low budgets, and even when the films are made - how do audiences see them? When I go to the cinema, for example, I don’t exactly feel spoiled for choice when I have a choice between the latest Star Wars, Jurassic World, or Superhero movie, and find myself scratching my head  when I’m told ‘sorry sir, we aren’t showing Silence or The Lobsters’. It’s no wonder many film fans turn to piracy since they’re unable to see the films they want to in cinema, and thus contribute to the cycle which often ends with creative, mid-budget movie losing money giving the studios a chance to tighten their grip on their wallets and say “I told you so – now let’s make another transformers movie.”\n\nI guess the main issue, as it usually is, comes down to money. Many of the stories for mid-budget films are risky and they require a respectable amount of cash to be made, their financial success not guaranteed, and even if they are a hit they won’t make as much money as the superhero film next to it, so why not make a superhero film instead? Would Hollywood greenlight a movie like Boogie Nights or LA Confidential today, if the films were made in exactly the same way? I’m not so sure. And those films co-existed alongside the likes of Star Wars and Jurassic Park.\n\nThere are other issues that many people have with modern day Hollywood that I think are all linked with this problem of studios only financing ultra-high budget cash cows or ultra-low budgets Oscar baits. Many people are turned off by what they see as forced political correctness for example, with movies like Oceans’ 8 or Ghostbusters going as far as to remake classic movies with all-female casts. Do you really think Hollywood, the land of pedos and rapist, care about women’s rights in the work place and the representation of Asians in cinema? They just want PR points to shove extra bums in the cinema seats.\n\nOf course, as stated, exceptions to the rule do exist. As stated critical darlings like Nolan and Tarantino provide a breath of fresh air in a world sominated by capes and spandex, and movies like David Fincher’s Gone Girl and Shane Black’s The Nice Guys eventually made small profits whilst the budgets did not compromise the directors’ vision. Other movies that made it through the pitching stage were War Dogs, Lala Land and Sully, all made from around $20m to $60.\n\nThere are studios Disney who finance $250m movies, there are studios like Blumhouse who specialise in micro-budget horror. I just wish there was someone who could lend out a hand and say to a director “here, here’s $30m, go and make a great film.” A studio that caught my eye when they attempted unsuccessfully to finance The Irishman were STX Entertainment, and mid-budget adult orientated movies are precisely their mission statement. Currently notable outputs of theirs consist of The Foreigner, Molly’s Game and Free State of Jones. Not bad for a company founded in 2014, and I hope they continue to fund medium sized projects.\n\nWe’re still a far cry from the 70s and 80s though. It’s a frustrating time when guys like Steven Soderbergh exist and are alive and well but can’t get a decent-budgeted film made, when creatively-void men like Colin Trevorrow and Zach Snyder are sitting on top of $200m pictures.\n\nCoppola, whose 3 most recent films were self-financed experimental pictures said:\n\n \n\nYou try to go to a producer today and say you want to make a film that hasn’t been made before; they will throw you out because they want the same film that works, that makes money. That tells me that although the cinema in the next 100 years is going to change a lot, it will slow down because they don’t want you to risk anymore”\n\nSoderbergh highlighted that the men behind the financing are no longer film fans when he said:\n\nThere are fewer and fewer executives who are in the business because they love movies. There are fewer and fewer executives that know movies… You’ve got people who don’t know movies and don’t watch movies for pleasure deciding what movie you’re going to be allowed to make.\n\nI think director Susan Seidelman summed it up best when she said:\n\n “To studios now, to make a million dollars isn’t a big deal — you have to make a billion dollars. They have to appeal to every demographic in every part of the world, so to make a $20 million movie that makes $60 million, why put their money there?”\n\nI guess, really, that’s all it comes down to in the end – money. Mid-budget cinema is in my opinion the heart and soul of Hollywood, but it’s no longer even considered let alone the priority. With the rise of TV and streaming, the ever-ballooning budgets of tentpole movies, who knows what the future for Hollywood looks like? Sometimes I think I secretly hope for the implosion that Steven Spielberg once predicted, so we get a fresh start, a purge – and once again the creative and artistic film-makers triumph.",

        "text": "Lately Hollywood has been making a lot of pro-progressive moves and some people told me that this is just forever lasting norm to try to cater for average movie going citizens. Or maybe to loudest people or the most whale people with lots of $ to spend.\n\n\nThose people also told me that movies before 1990s and 1980s had similar style agenda just in the opposite direction - claiming that films had clear black and white bad and good. Most films were pro-civilization, pro-family, pro-war and very nationalist.\n\nOn paper when I look at it I think it's true but I rarely watch older movies + what does youngling like myself know about world at the time? I'm here to get third more experienced opinion.\n\n I mean you look at film like Bridge on River Kwai (1957), film is literal anti-war film but still pits western people as strong willed capable free strong men and treats Saito and his Japanese crew as weaklings who give up on their traditional values quickly and villainy despite reaching the middle ground with the westerners.  Sensitive person would say that there's agenda there and probably cut her/his arm off after watching this movie. Or I don't know maybe I am wrong. I mean American military tries to shame this anti-war fun loving man into being war hero and shows idiocy of war from anti-war perspective from both sides. This film is super brilliant and complicated, I still have lot of understanding to do about it. Probably one of the greatest films ever made... but anyways looking for more general opinions so forget this part.\n\n\nLooking more of general hole industry related answers not particular films-.-",

        "text": "I think they’re not reminding casual audiences about Harry Potter enough. The first fantastic beasts had a high enough concept to sell the audience with. “Wizard catches monsters.”\n\nThis one is completely switching narrative marketing wise. “Bad wizard and why he’s bad.” That’s not interesting enough to a random general mainstream movie goer. If they made a thanos out of him in the first, focused enough on him in the first movie and made him a household name, maybe it would work. \n\nBut as a dude who saw all the movies and vaguely remembers them (I’m interested in Harry Potter but not a fanatic), the name “Grindelwald” means nothing to me, and they’ve done nothing to inform me aside from him being a secondary villain in the first movie, which was sold as a movie about something other than villains anyways. \n\nAlso, I don’t think the movies have any protagonists the general audience knows and roots for like they do Spider-Man or Batman or Harry Potter. They have dumbledore, but I question if he’s big enough to sell a movie off of. Is venom enough to sell a movie when Spider-Man’s not there? Is the joker enough to sell a movie when Batman’s not there? Is dumbledore enough to sell a movie when Harry Potter’s not there? I guess we’ll find out.\n\nI heard they have 5 movies planned in total. I don’t think they’ll make it that far. If this one does in fact violently underperform, I think they’d either switch gears in marketing for the next or condense the planned story into a single final sequel, like they did the divergent series, if I remember correctly. \n\nAnyways, yeah, do you think fantastic beasts 2 has done enough to sell itself to casual fans of the Harry Potter series, or do you think it’ll bomb? And, ya know what, is the Harry Potter name meaning less, even if the new film is tying itself to the name enough? ",

As I said on a previous conversation, I believe a very bad movie is either boring or at the very least heavily offensive (things like God's Not Dead, Birth of a Nation, torture porn movies, etc.) But even then, most people move on with their life.\n\nSome people will act like doing this or that is for the sake of the movie industry, but I don't think that's true. It makes it unpleasant for general audiences to be trashed for liking movies, and watching a movie to bash it won't change the cash grabs - if anything, people *shouldn't* watch movies they dislike to not give money to big studios if they want to protest. If you watch it to bash it ad infinitum you're still giving money to them.",

        "text": "The full article is here with images and all: https://kybitzed.com/2018/09/23/american-animals/\n\nAmerican Animals, the newest love project of film-maker and documentarian Bart Layton (who’s 2012 film The Imposter fundamentally reshaped the way that I consume documentaries), is the most finely edited production I have seen all year, and possibly the best film of the year. While the film has a fine cast, with the likes of Evan Peters and Barry Keoghan absolutely dominating the screen, the most creative and powerful element of the production is the use of the actual students who orchestrated the dangerous caper. Interspersed throughout the film are conversations with the real boys (now men) as they recount the events of that year, and specifically the heist. Beyond that, on more than one occasion, the real boys and their actor counterparts interact with one another.\n\nThese scenes, where the boys and the actors converse on the present state of their situation or the interpretation of events, are fascinating narrative techniques to explore the subjectivity and fallibility of memory. The use of creative narrative techniques is what makes an otherwise interesting story and adds that little bit of spice. It’s powerful, brutal, and genuine, and helps to foster the decidedly complex capabilities of film as a storytelling medium.\n\nBased On A True Story has become somewhat of a running joke in the film community because of the blasé and haphazard usage of the subtitle. Nearly every horror movie adds the disclaimer to the marketing material and etches it onto the beginning of the film. The Blair Witch Project is one of the more famous examples of the disclaimer adding weight to the screening experience. The mystery of “This is real? How had I never heard of it?” and the sheer terror of believing that real people went through an absolutely bone-chilling experience lends credence to the horror. Fargo also utilized the Based On A True Story disclaimer to make the viewing experience that much more deeply and profoundly uncomfortable. Now, just about any film can get a Based On A True Story sticker smeared on like a pungent, foul paste. This perversion has helped, in some sense, to create a more perceptive audience than those of the 90’s and early 2000’s. What was once met with “This is real?” is now met with “This isn’t real.” Even when films do, rightfully, deserve the disclaimer of Based On A True Story, audiences are not as easily susceptible to the trickery of marketing and PR departments and the hyperbolic lens which some films use to filter the real events, look no further than Michael Bay’s Pain &amp; Gain.\n\nAmerican Animals is than placed in a difficult position. Does the film become a straight documentary with Morrisesque recreations and re-enactments intermittently cut throughout the film, or is it a re-enactment with the audience placing faith in the filmmaker to fairly and accurately distill the actual events into an engaging story? Both are fair play, and both have been handled well in other films. But, American Animals opts for a brilliant, blended viewing experience, occasionally breaking up the action of the film to engage with a running interview with the parents and criminals. It’s a great reality check for the audience, especially as the intensity ramps up towards the end of the second act, and we see these “characters” make horrible, life-altering decisions, and cut to the real boys. There is a sincere level of embarrassment (alongside a whole slew of emotions) that an audience member confronts on the cut back to the real boys. You almost wish that you could leap through the screen, into the recreational world that has been created, to tell these characters to stop what they’re doing. To stop before they become like the guys we’ve seen!\n\nThere is a mixture of hope and inevitability that is constantly in conflict with one another to create an uneasy viewing experience. Sometimes these boys are so close to stopping the heist, from giving up entirely and going home, but we know that it isn’t true. That it very much can’t be that way. And, it is that very conflict, that very internal struggle, manifested externally in the film, that made this one of the most unique and engaging films I have ever seen. It broadened, in a very earnest and powerful way, what I thought film was capable of.",

Éric Rohmer’s Six Moral Tales are a brilliant example of the French New Wave and the way we encounter men and women in those films.\n\nHis Moral Tales bridge the gap freely between literature and cinema, often as pure and freeform expressions of both. Rohmer directs like the writer writes, pouring consciousness and intimate perspective from every frame. These are stories about our personal relationships reflecting the underlying morality of those relationships. Rarely are they driven by action—we must adapt to a different pace—these are films concerned more with the individual experience of thought and playing that story through. Let’s join Rohmer, the master of the form, from beginning to end, and explore the great morality of the French New Wave.\n\nThe Bakery Girl of Monceau (La Boulangère de Monceau, 1963)\n\nThis stunning short film presents the foundation for the moral tales to follow: a man occupied with a relationship with one woman meets another woman who questions what he believes. It also establishes the specific narrative device used as a throughline across the six films—a literary first-person narration is added to provide the benefit generally exclusive to literature of always being in the character’s head and having their thoughts. An interesting note about the first person narration: it’s not provided by the central lead, Barbet Schroeder, but another actor, Bertrand Tavernier, exemplifying the voice running inside our head is often so different from our personal voice.\n\nThe story entangles an idle man on a conquest, as these things tend to go. Schroeder’s character relentlessly seeks a relationship with the alluring Sylvie (Michèle Girardon). This becomes a test of patience as he waits café-side every day, squandering his potentials for advances, as she walks briskly past. She walks with such a defined ignorance of his existence, she is all but sure to have recognized he’s there, his friend muses. Eventually he’ll work up the courage to approach and fumbling through a flirtation, make his move. This does not immediately work, and she subsequently disappears from her usual routes, causing our narrator to instead go in pursuit of a nubile café worker instead. If he could not have what he wants, could he position his obvious attention from other women toward eventually capturing the object of his desire?\n\nThis is the moral quandary of The Bakery Girl of Moceau. As his relationship with Jacqueline (Claudine Soubrier) expands with his ever-increasing appetite for baked goods, our character wrestles with his own imagination. It’s clear that Sylvie has superior positioning mentally and this new girl’s not-so-easy-going nature is not inherently appealing, while her youth, only aged eighteen, makes her an easy target. This short explores the predatory nature of men and the existence of free will within the forming of relationships. It’s cued by interpersonal dialogues (we’ll not call them monologues, as there are two voices), warring over the option of two women. When the inevitable comes to fruition and both women enter the fold for a date in the final moments, what kind of moral decision is left to make? These decisions have already been made from the beginning.\n\nSuzanne’s Career (La Carrière de Suzanne, 1963)\n\nSuzanne’s Career is the story of an independent woman entangled in a love triangle with two sporting young men. Suzanne, played by a deliciously deceptive Catherine Sée, becomes the object of affection between two men, the serious Bertrand (Philippe Beuzen) and the coy, womanizing Guillaume (Christian Charrière). They decide to exploit her vulnerabilities for a tryst and expend all her money and career opportunities. The cruel twist of fate is that by the end, Suzanne may get the better of them.\n\nMoral and ethical issues abound. Our boys have a not entirely hetero-normative feeling for each other, the way men can be when egging on one another’s conquests. This leaves Bertrand the outsider, as Guillaume quickly beds Suzanne and becomes bored of her character. This sparks a friendly animosity and competition within Bertrand, as he slowly shifts to being the opportunistic character, and finding blame around every turn. While they exploit her for all she’s worth, the story doubles back around when Bertrand later meets Suzanne and her new boyfriend for a swim. Yes, it does not matter if she had been their idea of a “plump” exploitable woman, she’s come out ahead of everyone, with a handsome boyfriend and evidently full life. The film offers a suggestion that this is the ultimate revenge.\n\nLensed in 16mm, it’s stylistically outside the calling card of the French New Wave, awash in the feeling of a completely different kind of cinema. If the obvious framing and shooting style falls out of pattern, the rest of the film does not. Running at a short clip, Suzanne’s Career continues the trend of internalized feeling: sparsely featured with diegetic sound and the character’s own inner-turmoil peppering the story. Amusing enough, here the narration contrasts distinctly with the on-screen action, a wonderful example of the unreliable narrator.\n\nMy Night at Maud’s (Ma nuit chez Maud, 1969)\n\nMy Night at Maud’s is startling in its complexity and the complete maturation of Rohmer’s form. It’s about probability and chance, free will and Pascal’s religious theory of choice, and yet remains a variation of the same stories told in the last two movies. The story involves a man with no name (played by Jean-Louise Trintignant) who finds a beautiful woman in church and decides to marry her outright but not before playing with ideas of infidelity and having heated arguments about Pascalian theory with a few close friends.\n\nThe man is a mathematician and is given to studious analysis. We find him trying to lead the life of asceticism put forward in Pascal’s wager: that given the choice to embrace religion, it only offers a greater potential and relatively no downsides. Here we find the message of marital faith entwined with his Catholicism. Throughout, he is calculating the probability of his situations and using his outcomes, making the best informed decision. He did not have to have the blond and when he stays overnight with the provocative socialite Maud, she offers herself, testing his conviction and will in his belief that some girl he’s seen at church must be the best possible choice in all options. This creates for him the illusion of sanctity in a faithful relationship—as he puts it, “Religion adds to love, but love adds to religion, also.”\n\nMy Night at Maud’s is deeply entrenched in its moment of France. It’s worthy of note that it is based in the hometown of Pascal, a frosty Clermont-Ferrand set during the dawn of Christmastime. This film simmers and provokes deep-seated conflicts of belief, contrasting Christian theology with principles of the Marxists, creating a capsule of its time that stands as quintessentially French Catholic. Intended to be the third of the Morals set, it does not align chronologically only because it was released out of order with the next film.\n\nLa Collectionneuse (1967)\n\nLa Collectionneuse is an ironic statement on idleness. In some way, it is a document of Rohmer’s own idleness, a holding pattern, while he awaited Jean-Louise Trintignant’s availability to shoot My Night at Maud’s. It’s his first color picture and first partnership with cinematographer Néstor Almendros. La Collectionneuse is a cinematographer’s film, as languid and out-for-vacation as its shooting feels. It’s filled with a great irony where Rohmer finds an inspired shooting location and then enlists the help of first-time actors to roam about the landscape improvising on the idea of doing nothing, listless and free of form like summer break. What emerges is the absolute truth framed as simply and perfectly as a camera lens can capture it.\n\nYoung Haydée is a collector of men. Here, we have an art collector and a painter as our male leads, who wish to impart some meaning on her new sexuality. The pair debate the esoteric beauty of the desired woman, debating whether she is beautiful at all, or if promiscuity has ruined their pure vision of love. Here is a realistic triangle where the sides cannot get what they want, if their idle self-reflection ever arrives at a desired objective.\n\nLa Collectionneuse is the ideal expression of Rohmer’s caméra-stylo concept, where the camera is the director’s pen, and he writes his novel using an audiovisual language. Once again, we’re given only one perspective of narration, from lead Adrien (Patrick Bauchau), and it’s our most self-reflective of the Moral Tales. His speech is filled with bon mots and idle yearning for love and understanding. This is the most realistic of the series, and its morals project through with the stunning clarity of its cinematography.\n\nClaire’s Knee (Le genou de Claire, 1970)\n\nNow outside the 1960s, the French New Wave is beginning to feel like the French Old Wave, while a mature Rohmer makes his most literary contribution yet. Claire’s Knee is a special film about temptation. The moral problem of the day is one of lust. In this one, a man, Jerome (Jean-Claude Brialy), committed to a diplomat’s daughter goes on vacation at his friend’s writer’s retreat as she bets him to explore his feelings for two young girls who are both preoccupied with boyfriends. In this way, it has meta-literary commentary and allows the authorial intent to shift between characters, the first time outside Suzanne that a woman seems to determine the narrative, although we know women always decide the fate of the man anyway. Here is a film that has read more French literature than you have and is itself an important piece of that canon.\n\nClaire’s Knee then is about the perversity of attraction. Jerome plays both young women: Laura who is wise beyond her years and her half-sister, Claire, whose body is beyond her years. Our Jerome takes up his challenge, with Laura quickly feeling for him while Claire holds up her resistance. She just wants her bad boy boyfriend who treats her badly and cheats. The matter of the story is he’s playing at romance only as a moral condition, fodder for his friend’s story, or as his last experiment before entering into a life of one-size-fits-all commitment.\n\nThe staggering beauty of the piece is that it’s both the most literary and cinematic of Rohmer’s oeuvre. This is the defining masterwork that has all of the parts in one place. Here we can connect each of the stories before and the one after, as Jerome exudes the morals of each of this long novel’s chapters. It is something like the climax of the book where everything promised has now been delivered, at the pinnacle of its director’s career, the journey is now complete, and all that’s left is for Rohmer to bring us home.\n\nLove in the Afternoon (L’amour l’après-midi, 1972)\n\nThere is no other ending for the romantic than Marriage. That is the end of our line. Rohmer knew how to go about it, spinning his final tale with the maturity of the artist who has told this story five times before, and has become expert in his own field. That leaves Love in the Afternoon a final triumph of the romantic spirit. Not to break from tradition, a ring on the finger, it turns out, does not keep our decently married man from wandering astray, his eye following every passerby. In Rohmer’s finest moment of literary license, the soliloquy here expresses everything his Moral Tales have been about:\n\n“What makes the streets of Paris so fascinating, is the constant yet fleeting presence of women whom I’m almost certain I’ll never see again. It’s enough that they’re there, indifferent, conscious of their charm, happy to test its effect on me, as I test mine on them, by tacit agreement, without even the subtlest smile or glance. I feel their seductive power without giving in to it. This doesn’t estrange me from Helen. Far from it. I tell myself those passing beauties are simply an extension of my wife’s beauty. They enrich her beauty and receive some of hers in return. She’s the guarantee of the world’s beauty, and vice versa. When I embrace Helen, I embrace all women. But I also feel my life passing by as other lives unfold along paths parallel to mine, and it frustrates me not to be part of them, not to have stopped these women for a moment in their hurried rush to some unknown job or unknown pleasure. And I dream. I dream that actually I possess them all. Lately in my spare moments, I delight in a daydream that grows clearer and more detailed by the day. A childish daydream, probably inspired by something I read at the age of ten.  I imagine I possess a device worn around the neck that gives off a magnetic fluid capable of annihilating others’ free will. I dream I use its powers on the women who pass by the café… indifferent… hurried… hesitant… busy… accompanied… alone.”\n\nThese six traits listed are assigned to the women of the Six Moral Tales, as they pass by, and the film is connected and emboldened by its past. These Tales were shot a time of absolute sexual revolution in Paris, where women and gays became empowered, and then there was the chaotic fugue state of the average male’s mind in post sex, present empowerment Paris. Rohmer operates on two significant guiding principles of chance and free will, with the man’s conscious thought leading decisions. What he does with them is not the end goal but exploring the inner turmoil and psychology, specifically only available to the novelist; this is where Rohmer has broken down all the walls of cinema. As the afternoon sun pours into the room, this time, and for the end of time, the man makes the Catholic choice of commitment.\n\nBy Calvin Kemph\n\n[FilmEra: ÉRIC ROHMER’S SIX MORAL TALES – THE MORALITY OF MEN AND WOMEN IN THE FRENCH NEW WAVE](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/23/eric-rohmers-six-moral-tales-the-morality-of-men-and-women-in-the-french-new-wave/)",

        "text": "Based on the 1977 novel “A Judgement in Stone” by Ruth Rendell, which in turn was inspired by real life events that transpired in 1933, “La Cérémonie” tells the story of young Sophie (Sandrine Bonnaire) as she’s hired as a maid by the well accomodated Lelièvre family. She’s shy and introverted, and has a disadvantage that’s revealed later on in the film but that still plays an important role, and even more important, there’s an event in her past that still exerts its influence on her. Being new in town, she quickly befriends Jeanne (Isabelle Huppert), a local girl who works at the post office and has an uncomplicated view on life. The problem is that her employers don’t want her hanging around with Jeanne, Mr. Lelièvre (Jean-Pierre Cassel) really dislikes her, and in spite of the efforts of Mrs. Lelièvre (Jacqueline Bisset) to keep the situation peaceful, it all inevitably heads on to an explosive finale. Claude Chabrol, who made his bones as a filmmaker in the Cahiers du Cinema group, even debuting as a director before both Truffaut and Godard, delivers a carefully constructed microcosmos that tackles class differences, the dangers of ineducation and intolerance, and what ultimately drives one to commit that which one most desires but is too afraid to do so.\n\nThis movie turned out to be quite unpredictable, even if you know what’s actually gonna go down by the end. You might think you’ve got it all figured out by some point, but all the twists and turns throw you off on a completely different direction, and yet, this being based on a true story one knows how it is supposed to end, but the plot machinations keep the audience guessing and trying to figure the whole deal out, and by the end one does not care as much about the what but rather the how. This is a testament to the screenplay. Adapting a real story to the screen is always a tricky ordeal, even if its based on a previous adaptation, in this case a literary work, since there are issues such as realism, believability and adaptibility in play, but I think the finished product is a very well written and executed screenplay. Written by Chabrol himself and Caroline Eliacheff, it starts slow and perhaps it does struggle to capture the viewer’s full attention during the first couple of scenes, but once the dynamics between the characters are established and the perceived end result starts to loom on the horizon, the film becomes a very riveting tale.\n\nhttps://breakingthefourthwallsite.wordpress.com/2018/09/23/la-ceremonie-an-exquisitely-murderous-drama/",

Mary was annoyed with Beatrice for the entire film and so she ignored the phone calls. Immediately you know that something bad is going to happen when she keeps ignoring the calls as she had done previously in the film, and then steps into her apartment. She is attacked, and it is revealed to be a boyfriend of the woman she had operated on previously to remove her private parts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat made the ending scenes so good for me, was the instant realization of the situation. The boyfriend probably had strong affections for this woman that Mary operated on, and was completely shocked and appalled at the body modifications that she had undergone. In a fit of anger, disbelief, and emotion, he immediately goes after the people that did this to her. It is a very plausible outcome. I thought it was a great way to end the movie.

        "text": "While everything was well executed for the most part and there's not much to complain about when it comes to the technical aspects, I still couldn't help but feel the stylistic influences in this film were a little overbearing. I'm not talking about the story here (even though you could draw obvious comparisons between the plot of this and a movie like Goodfellas), just that the way the film presented itself set up this immediate connection in my mind to a Scorsese film. The non-stop, active tracking shots (most iconically that one long opening take but other examples can be found too), the quick pans, heavy use of era-specific music, all pulled off impressively and at potentially an expert level, but with barely a hint of originality or a personal, unique spin on PTA's part. I understand he was inspired to an extent, but this was just distracting. Maybe not crossing the line, but more than enough to taint the experience for me. It could well be that the mental comparison I mentioned is unfair, or that this film frankly seems to be overhyped everywhere and as a result of that my expectations were unrealistically high, but my main criticism always seems to come back to PTA being heavy-handed with the whole paying homage thing. Even a film like The Master, which I didn't fully appreciate the first time round, I could tell was uniquely a PTA film with its own identity and not one comprised of its influences. What do you think?\n\n(For the record, I didn't entirely hate this movie just because it seemed like PTA doing his best Martin Scorsese impression. There were a few scenes - particularly towards the latter half of the film - that had me genuinely invested, and Mark Wahlberg was the best I've ever seen him here.)",

        "text": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have used images to further convey my points, so I suggest reading the article here: [https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/22/the-coen-brothers-idiosyncratic-masters-top-10-scenes/](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/22/the-coen-brothers-idiosyncratic-masters-top-10-scenes/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/nw5kd3ynyun11.jpg\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's delve into it! \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/9g7nrk940vn11.gif\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n“We grew up in America, and we tell American stories in American settings, within American frames of reference.” — Ethan Coen\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat’s the consensus. There is, however, a point of contention over what is truly a Coen brothers film. Having watched nearly all of their movies recently, I have come up with three main distinguishing criteria: Characters, Comedy as a Shield, and Endings, and two rather personal ones: Collaboration with Roger Deakins and Dolly-in shot. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Characters** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ap6sx0w22vn11.jpg\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA myriad of idiosyncratic, whimsical and enigmatic characters  inhabits the world of the Coen brothers’ films. An outlaw on a journey  to fulfill his American dream, the laziest man in LA county takin’er  easy for all us sinners, and an inexorable friendo beyond good and evil  are only a few examples. This is one of the reasons why their films are  memorable. Even the side characters, the ones with a few-minutes of  screen time leave a lasting impression on you, like Jesus and Nihilists  from *The Big Lebowski*:\n\nNihilist #1: His girlfriend gave up her toe!  \n Nihilist #2: She thought we’d be getting million dollars!  \n Nihilist #1: It’s not fair!  \n Walter: Fair?!?! Who’s the fucking nihilist around here, you bunch o’  \n fucking crybabies!\n\nThere are many awkward pauses, characters breaking off their  sentences in the middle, losing their train of thought, ridiculous body  languages, and weird facial expressions. In nearly all of their films,  however, there is a consistent behavior which ends up hilarious –  especially on multiple viewings. That is, characters repeating certain  words, phrases, and sentences. For instance, in Miller’s Crossing:  “what’s the rumpus?” “Ethics;” or in *The Big Lebowski*: “Shut da fuck up, Donny,” “That rug tied the room together,” “man.” This is also apparent in specific scenes. In *Fargo*, When Lou and Marge are investigating a crime scene, Lou repeats “yah” and “oh, yah” 10 times.\n\n In *No Country for Old Men*, Anton Chigurh asks “where does he work?” three times from an old lady to glean information on Llewelyn Moss. \n\n In *Burn After Reading*, there’s a scene where the characters are  trying to know what is on the CD Monolo found. Monolo repeats “On the  floor there” and “It was just lying there” And every time he says so, we  get a low-angle medium shot of him, amplifying the comedic effect. \n\n \n\n### Comedy as a Shield\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;“But it seems to us that comedy is a part of life. Look  at the recent example of the people who tried to blow up the World Trade  Center. They rented a panel truck to use for the explosion and then,  after committing the crime, went back to the rental agency to get back  the money they left on deposit. The absurdity of this kind of behavior  is terribly funny in itself.”\n\nThis sums up their approach to comedy: a serious event, mingled with comedic moments, creating a shield which protects us from drowning in  the tragedy of the story. When we laugh at the scenes, we get some  distance, and some perspective, on the underlying messages.\n\n&gt;“Look how horrible people can be; isn’t life great?” — Ethan Coen\n\nTake this scene from *Fargo:* Marge stumbles upon the  whereabouts of the kidnappers. She catches one of them, Gaear, shredding  the other one, Carl, into pieces in a wood chipper. This would’ve been  enough to let us know what’s going on. The Coen brothers, however, have  added a neat comedic touch: a upside-down leg with socks. It makes you  laugh and makes the scene less oppressive.\n\n In this scene from *Burn After Reading*, Harry, heart-broken over divorce and devastated over the murder, is taking it out on his passion  project. Then, amid all the wrath, we get a medium shot of a dildo  going up and down with no intention of giving up; an incongruent and  hilarious section of an otherwise serious moment. \n\n In *Barton Fink*, after the mysterious death of Audrey, there’s a  two-shot of Barton, sitting in dismay, and Audrey, lying there soaked  in blood. This moment lingers until Barton suddenly squeals, leaving you  with no option but to laugh. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n### The Endings\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf the many elements that reward multiple viewings, one of the best  is that their films have ambiguous endings that encourage multiple  interpretations. *Barton Fink,* *The Man Who Wasn’t There*, *No Country for Old Men*, *A Serious Man* and *Inside Lewin Davis*  all have endings that demand scrutiny from the audience. They mystify  you on the first viewing and encourage you to be more investigative  during the next ones.\n\nIn his article “*No Country for Old Men –* The Coens’ Tragic Western,” Richard Gilmore writes:\n\n“The movie ends with Bell telling his wife Loretta (Tess Harper)  about two dreams that he had had the night before. Both dreams have his  father in them. The first is about some money that Bell loses. The  second has his father riding past him in the night, carrying fire in a  horn. Bell ends his description of the dream by saying, “And in the  dream I knew that he was goin’ on ahead and that he was fixin’ to make a  fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold, and I knew  that whenever I got there he would be there. Out there up ahead.”  Prometheus stole fire from the gods to give to human beings in order to  save them from extinction. To make a fire is an art. It is by the arts  that human beings thrive, and I take that original art of making fire to  stand, metonymically, for all the arts. Fire beats back the darkness,  the darkness of fear, of ignorance, of hubris, of greed. I read Bell’s  dream of his father to be a dream of carrying on the fire of memory, the  fire of the stories that one has of what one has seen in this world. It  is the fire of the wisdom that those stories can yield with the telling  of them. This, too, is an important role to play, to be the bearer of  this fire. It is less heroic in the eyes of the world than that of  lawman or outlaw, but it is probably more important to human survival  and thriving than either of those.”\n\n \n\n### Collaboration with Roger Deakins\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;“People confuse pretty and good cinematography. It was  Freddie Francis who said “There’s good cinematography, bad  cinematography and the cinematography that’s right for the movie.”  \n “I don’t think have a style; I have a style that suits the project I’m on.” — Roger Deakins\n\nThe Coen brothers regard Roger Deakins as one of the best DPs in  recent memory. They have collaborated with him on the majority of their  projects, including *O Brother Where Art Thou?,* *Fargo*, and *No Country for Old Men*.  The distinct look and feel of the films is a testament to him abiding  by the philosophy in those quotes. This collaboration might not be as  distinguishing feature of a Coen brothers film, but working with Deakins  compliments their vision. For me, it can go beyond that. *O Brother Where Art Thou* didn’t resonate with me on a script level, but I relished the alluring cinematography.\n\nAnd he has this to say about the Coen brothers:\n\n&gt;“They can shoot anything and make it interesting, they’re true poets of the cinema.”\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\n### Dolly-in Shot\n\nGranted, the dolly-in shot is not exclusive to the Coen brothers.  They, however, employ it frequently and with more creativity than most  other filmmakers. They use it in two ways: frenetic and gradual. For the  former, we can refer to *The Big Lebowski*, *Miller’s Crossing*, and *Raising Arizona*  (the gifs below), where the frenetic dolly-in shot adds to the comedic  sense of the scene. The subtler use occurs in conversations, which  allows the Coens to avoid unnecessary cuts and keep and audience  engaged. To elaborate on this, I’ll use two scenes from *Fargo* and *A Serious Man*.\n\n Notice how we’re gonna go from a wide frame – which establishes the  setting, with the curtains behind him akin to bars – to the final  close-up. As the conversation starts to go south, the camera gradually  dollies in on Jerry. The final wide shot frames him isolated in his own  prison, conveying his predicament. \n\n There is a similar one in *A Serious Man*, with the exception being that the final shot is an extreme close-up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have discussed some of my favorite scenes of their filmography  [here](https://thefilmera.com/2018/09/22/the-coen-brothers-idiosyncratic-masters-top-10-scenes/), feel free to check it out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what do you think makes them different? which film has the most \"Coenness\" (I would go with Fargo) and which film the least (would go with True Grit)? and finally, what are your favorite scenes? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

The movie was great but very disturbing, my question is why didn't the futuristic super mecha at the end of the film simply get rid of the imprinting and upgrade him past the naive child he's been for the last 2,000 years? I know it would ruin the ending of the movie and David's perfect day but why not put David out of his misery and simply rid him of his thoughts of Monica? I mean it was 2,000 years since she was alive and at least David could move on and have friendships with other mechas? Also why were Teddy and Joe so aware and self sacrificing for David while David could never change?",

As much as I love those films, it always makes me a little bit sad that he didn't get to direct any movies, after A New Hope, that weren't Star Wars. I guess, there's no real point to this post but, what do think he would've done if Star Wars wasn't a thing? What would you've liked him to do? Would he still be making films? Would he ever be a big name in Hollywood if he'd kept making films?",
