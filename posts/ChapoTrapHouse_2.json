        "text": "[Meme here](http://imgur.com/HqAbBfs)\n\nI see a lot of U.S. Conrad's here posting about \"packing the court\" without fully understanding how the supreme Court functions. \n\nFirst, let's look at what the dumb and antiquated constitution actually says:\n\nArticle II\n&gt;[The President] shall have Power, [...] and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint [...] Judges of the supreme Court, \n\nArticle III\n&gt; The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts **as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.** The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services, a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.\n\nThanks to u/aleph-naught \n\nThose two run on sentences are the only mention of the make up of the supreme Court in the U.S. constitution.\n\nThey say that the supreme Court must exist and how it looks like is up to Congress. Later mentions define jurisdiction and powers of the supreme Court. \n\nThe President does not decide how many justices there are, there is no mention of lifetime appointments, there are no minimum or maximum ages. All that is decreed by an act of Congress. In other words, it's just a law and laws can be changed. If you're gonna \"pack the court\" you'll have to change the law anyways and if you're gonna change it might as well go all in.\n\nYou can make the supreme Court 70 justices and have them be divided by expertise into different sections or Chambers so they can hear more cases. Imagine a chamber for criminal law and another for civil law etc. You can have terms, like 6 years and term limits, 2 terms. You can have a retirement age, like 76. Does that sound impossible? Well it isn't because that's how Germany does it. You can even have the supreme Court be elected by popular vote. \n\nA better slogan is \"remake the court\". Maximal demands comrades.\n\nI really would have liked to have the Meme be the preview but reddit makes text and pics hard.\n\nLike and subscribe. \n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold stranger. Hope you're in the comments discussing the topic.\nAs an addendum, anyone who's interested can look up the acts that made the court and read them. The best three groups of people lawyers, lawmakers and bankers want to mystify their subjects, when they are pretty accessible. Tax law and shit can get complicated but some laws are simple. Demystify your government. ",

We went to a bar and the news broke that Musk has to step down as CEO and one of my pals was just upset about it. He doesn't agree with me when I tell him that he's basically a smarter Trump. Other friends would say the following the rest of the night:\n\n&gt; He's an innovator, bringing the human race along the path to the final frontier. \n\n&gt; My boy be tweaking about Thailand but he innovates and invents.\n\n&gt; Fuck the SEC. Insider trading? Let em play!\n\n&gt; No shit r/TheDinnerPlate he a narcissist he's a billionaire \n\n&gt; Neil is right yall. The Space Force sounds dumb but we do need to get a footing there when we fight the Chinese in 30 years. \n\n&gt; Sargon of Akkad is a liberal dude, Antifa shouldn't be protesting him. \n\nWe weren't getting heated at all but I just realized how insane they are about this. I kinda drank some brews and hung out with the one girl there in a party of 13 people (One of my cool friends gf) and talk about my guy issues and relationships. But this doesn't only happen among my friends, it's at my University too. Got a marketing class this semester (dont be a business major if you have a choice, I'm doing it to get outta a rough situation I am in but these people are dumb as bricks) and a class friend there LOVES Tesla lol. A few other things said in that class about Musk (He is unfortunately brought up a lot) and Kavanaugh \n\n&gt; What kind of billionaire would willingly smoke weed? A cool one \n\n&gt; Musk can do whatever he wants he's rich.\n\n&gt; I don't buy Ford's rape story, women lie about these things, especially when it can make a media circus \n\nA fucking woman said that last one. Anyway my whole point is that this shit is gonna be irritating to deal with because all my friends and classmates are in my age range (20-29) and will be voting/changing the culture of this decrepit nation for years to come. Gotta find a way to break through. \n\nDo yall got any experiences with people like this? ",
