        "text": "The title does not say it all, but I am not able to participate in Match nor in SOAP. I cannot email any programs from the time SOAP officially begins Monday, March 13 at 11:00 AM EST until Thursday, March 16 at 9:00 PM EST. The title does not convey how absolutely angry, shocked, confused, and melancholic this all is. I go through periods of the most-pure rage, despair, shock, rage, despair, rage, despair, rage, despair, shock, I have ever experienced in my life. There is nothing I can do to be put back onto the Match list and even if I could, it would mean nothing because all the programs have already made their lists that do not include me.\n\n**Here is my plan so far**:\n\n1. Acquire all documents (Profile picture, Personal statement, CV, Names + contact info of LOR, OET score, Step 1 score, Step 2 CK score, CSA Exam score) and put it all into one PDF file\n2. Email every program that potentially might have open residency spots during SOAP\n3. Email programs that have non-NRMP-affiliated residency programs\n4. Email every program I interviewed at and ask them to consider me if they have any available slots during SOAP\n\n**Main Questions I have:**\n\n1. Does this sound like a sufficient plan? Do you have any suggestions, comments, or criticisms?\n2. What should I do if I can't find a residency after SOAP, ie research, PA/NP work, clinical skills instructor, etc?\n3. How should I explain my situation in the 2024 Match if I don't find a residency this year?\n\n**Here is how this happened:**\n\nFirst of all, I completely understand that ultimately any requirement, regardless of its legitimacy, is my responsibility. However, also true is that I am essentially being told by the system that I am too unfit to be a doctor because I didn't sign a single document and pay $950 to ECFMG on time, a document that takes 5 minutes to fill out and is only necessary because Step 2 CS was cancelled due to COVID and ECFMG needed an alternate way to collect $950/applicant. Essentially, I thought I had signed it. The MyEras application portal told me I had \"no action required\" for ECFMG. The NRMP Main Match Residency Program Checklist makes no reference to ECFMG. The NRMP website only says to make sure graduation is verified by the end of January. I emailed my school in early January to make sure I had met all graduation requirements. They said I had because they viewed verfication of graduation with ECFMG as a Match requirement, not a graduation requirement. I thought I had done everything: I passed all my core electives; I passed OET, Step 2CK, Clinical Skills Assessment (CSA) Exam, and completed 90 clinical units. I think it's pretty understandable that someone would think that a student would fulfill all their duties and then the school or ECFMG or someone would give the student some sort of warning that an important deadline was approaching. I did not get that warning. So that's that. I have a MUCH harder road now because I didn't put my $950 signature at the bottom of the line like they wanted me to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny help would be appreciated. Thank you.\n\n[https://www.nrmp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2023-MRM-Applicant-Checklist-FINAL.pdf](https://www.nrmp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2023-MRM-Applicant-Checklist-FINAL.pdf)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ez3ha4yn1rla1.png?width=1986&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d7c8f77b8be3e67bbbbdce238ae828b1c75294e2",

Hopefully this helps me rebuild my focus and get flow states \n\nTry to stay productive; I’m going to see if I can still get involved with research. If not I’ll just volunteer. \n\nContinue exercising: I already exercise a ton but I think I’m going to stop lifting so much and switch to doing cardio without music. Take walks too\n\nAvoid social media, reddit, and YouTube unless I’m looking for something specific \n\nPrestudying: this is my biggest issue. My school is switching from a traditional curriculum to an integrated system with this incoming class. So while I’ll have some of the knowledge base, it’s going to be in a completely different format. All the anki decks I used and all those question banks I had are near useless. I’m guessing all my class’s powerpoints will also be completely different too. So as much as I want to prepare, I don’t know how. If someone is at a school with integrated/system based curric I would appreciate some help. I’ll prob make a separate post for it later. \n\nAny other suggestions?",

Finally, we are hoping to submit for publication soon, and hopefully by residency it will be a published manuscript with me as 1st author. \n\nMy question mainly is what to put on my CV. You don't double-list things, right? I assume I should put the conference that I personally presented at, but then I'm also wondering if I can list as an abstract at the international conference?  And then when its a full pub, do I take all that other stuff off my CV or just add it?",

This may seem like a strange choice, but l've been interested in medicine and biology since I can remember.\n\nTo progress in this field, a medicine degree is required. I'd like to eventually become a forensic pathologist, which you cannot do without this degree (understandably). My university offers a graduate entry medicine degree to anyone with a 2:1 degree in any subject. You have to get a good score in the UCAT test, then do well in the interview to be offered a place.\n\nSome background of my education: I got Bs in GCSE biology and chemistry, I started a Biology A level but dropped out because I didn't know what I wanted to do so I swapped to a college. That's also why I didn't do a medicine degree to begin with. The graduate entry medicine course will be 4 years, not 5, and I don't care about the fact that I'd be in my late twenties when I finish (only mentioning because some people have said that to me, and I don't care haha).\n\nSo basically what I'm asking is should I go for it? I really want to at least try to get into the course, and I'm so passionate about this that I think I'd be okay. I know it's incredibly hard but if I don't try l'll never know, right?\nAlso, if there are any people with experience in the pathology field, I'd love to hear from you!",

I am fascinated by the human body, I want to help people and to contribute to the society. I love learning, but I hate studying (as absurd as it sounds, yet I'm a strong student). I've realized that the journey is as important as the end goal, because who knows whether you'll live another day.

I research topics anout it all day, all my friends and relatives ask me fir advice and so on.\n\nAlso I have to mention that I want to be self employed and own a business. I have an awesome idea that pairs well with dietology, because it'll help with patients's struggles in the area.  \n\nI started out so motivated, but there's always something missing - it's art and socialization. I feel like I'm wasting my youth hunched over books, because I hate studying. That's why I hate highschool, although I'm an A student. I tend to prioritize school over every other aspect of life and that makes me unhappy. \n\nI am very creative and impulsive and I feel the most fulfilled when I go with my energy bursts. I need some thrill and randomness. I keep seeing these videos online of people in design school living their best life, doing interesting projects like crocodile looking shoes, designing magazines and so on. It looks so awesome. I'm good at many kinds of arts and if I'm not, I master things quickly because I commit entirely for a period of time when I have the time. Even digital arts. Then I move onto the next art thing. I want to use this ability. I want to have some free time to try all the things I want, do some business startups for fun and see where it gets me, earn some money... I've been wanting to start a brand. \n\nIt's hard to commit to 2 totally different things and be good at both and not burnout totally.

My personality thrives on medical workup, solving issues, and learning about all aspects of medicine (broad knowledge base). However, when I  did have a few shifts in the ED at my institution, I didn't particularly appreciate how the history were collected and how many ED docs made misdiagnoses. In addition, it was too fast-moving to do a good physical exam. I enjoyed the fast pace because I always liked to be engaged, but efficiency decreased where speed increased. \n\nThe only issue with switching solely to IM is income. Income is significant because I want to take care of my family. My family did not come from much, but they have been my support throughout my entire educational career. \n\nIs it possible to make 300,000 as a hospitalist in the Midwest without working in a rural setting? \n\nAlso, what are your all thoughts about choosing EM? I'd also like to know if it's like that at other institutions. I plan to do an away EM rotation during fourth year to gauge my specialty decision.",

I was super depressed and suicidal but I graduated and entered pediatrics residency.\n\nYears ago, during med school, after being in a psych ward and committed there, I remember feeling worthless (I was treated like an animal and like I was shit and I internalized it). My third year of med school after I got back, I went to a train station with the intent of taking my life but I couldn’t do it.\n\nFast forward to today, I’m graduating pediatrics residency. I’m happier now than I’ve ever been and residency has been the best time of my life. I started off a terrible resident though - no knowledge, not efficient, incomplete notes. Half way through second year of residency, I realized I had to ditch the victim mindset and self-limiting beliefs and start grinding. I studied every day, pushed through the sadness from bad evaluations early on. Now, I signed a great job offer in gen peds. My ED attending said I’m one of the best residents this program has ever had. The interns told me I’m universally known as the best senior to work with. I got nominated for resident of the month by the hospitalist, cardio, and ED divisions and my co-residents five months in a row this year. \n\nWhat I failed to realize when I was intent on killing myself back then was that I would change profoundly in the years to come and, consequently, experience life in a completely different way. That I would become strong, mature, wise, and kind. That I would feel super peaceful, present, and joyful (more so than before bipolar). Fuck the people who treat others like shit for whatever reason that’s a reflection of them, not of us. I learned to be grateful and to love myself, to forgive, to practice acceptance/surrender, and to not judge. Change how you think and you change your life. \n\nIt wasn’t easy. I had lots of 24s and nights. I had 11 weeks of nights the first six months of this year. Got sick like fifteen times (peds), my father was hospitalized twice and had a heart attack. I got pulled for backup call (extra nights and 24s) over nine times my second year. But having been through challenges earlier in med school, I responded to subsequent challenges with much more strength, grace, and ease.\n\nWouldn’t change the fact that I’m bipolar. That experience made me experience a depth of suffering I had never known before being otherwise privileged. It made me a much more compassionate/empathetic human being and a much better doctor. \n\nI’m glad I didn’t give up. My life is precious. Regardless of what you’re going through - because lots of hard shit happens to lots of good people - you can get through it and maybe you’ll grow from the challenges you endure. Maybe one day life will be better than you ever imagined.",

I wouldn’t say I was perfect by any means, but my notes were often used verbatim or only slightly modified. My presentations always included the most up to date information, and very rarely did an intern need to add anything (usually it was because the intern got paged about a result during rounds so I wouldn’t have had time to see it anyway).\n\nBut now I’m at my school’s hospital and I feel like utter crap. I’ve been paired with the same intern for 6 patients at this point (first week here, of 4). I’m the only student on the team. Every note I write is drastically changed. Of course that is a sign that I need to learn my intern’s style. Great. But even when I copy her note and just change the relevant parts, she’ll change the wording or the order. I asked how she likes her notes and she just said “I make stylistic changes but your notes are fine.” But it doesn’t feel great that I’m basically making her do all the work anyway.\n\nAnd then on rounds, while I’m presenting the patient, she’ll say “oh the plan changed, I spoke to GI yesterday and they said xyz, forgot to tell you” when I explicitly ask her if she has any updates that aren’t in the system yet. She’ll also often forget that I’m assigned to the patient so she’ll start presenting the SOAP until the attending remembers that it’s my patient. It makes me feel like she sees me as an idiot.\n\nIt just sucks, and I’m just ranting. I’m worried I’m seen as a big time and effort suck. I know I have things to learn and improve upon.",
