        "text": "I just transferred into the Army Reserve after serving in the NG for 10 years.  I've had a pretty negative outlook on my military career due to both poor personal decisions (admittedly) and factors outside of my control (as most of us in the military experience).  I was very motivated at the beginning of my career: I completed several courses, volunteered for everything, &amp; was looked at to complete unit tasks ALL the time... BUT none of it ever went recognized, nor did I gain any sort of career progression. IN FACT, my first line leader even forgot to submit my promotion packet several times. I became jaded. \n\nIn addition to that, I'm now going thru a career change-- from law enforcement to nursing.  Balancing nursing school, military obligation, full-time work, and my fiancé &amp; home-life has tested my resiliency!  I've accomplished a lot in life, and the stress recently has made me feel like I threw it all away.  But, I had my first drill at my new unit &amp; my commander told me:  𝙒𝙝𝙖𝙩 𝙮𝙤𝙪'𝙫𝙚 𝙖𝙘𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙥𝙡𝙞𝙨𝙝𝙚𝙙 𝙞𝙣 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙥𝙖𝙨𝙩 𝙬𝙞𝙡𝙡 𝙣𝙤𝙩 𝙢𝙖𝙠𝙚 𝙮𝙤𝙪 𝙬𝙝𝙤 𝙮𝙤𝙪'𝙧𝙚 𝙩𝙤 𝙗𝙚 𝙞𝙣 𝙩𝙝𝙚 𝙛𝙪𝙩𝙪𝙧𝙚.  Say it again. \n\nI am not posting this so people feel bad for me. Don't. This is motivation to not be afraid to start over. Don't dwell on your past successes, and instead look forward to what you can further accomplish!  'Cuz you're a badass 😉",

My physical and mental health have taken a toll in recent months with me stopping going to the gym, stopped doing things that I was passionate about and I stopped actively trying to achieve my goals. I want to better and I’m tired of being mediocre. I feel like I’m stuck in this cycle of pushing and doing productive things for a couple of days but then ultimately doing bad things. I just want to find someone that will keep me accountable for my actions and for what I should be doing because I feel like I just need a push to get back on track.",

Today’s prompt was **‘Comment on the music being played in the background**.’ Easy enough, there’s music always playing in the cafe I do my work in. It worked to some degree but I didn’t quite get the results I wanted:\n\n# Before:\n\nI wasn’t feeling that nervous really. It was so simple, so innocuous that I felt as though I could say it to anyone and I’d be fine. Stakes low = more likely to do it.\n\n# Experience:\n\nI had in my mind that I would comment on the music and when I got there alas, no music was playing when I got there. I commented this to the barista and we had a chat about irregular customers who complained and they actually went and put the music on for me!\n\n# Thoughts:\n\nIt was a success in some ways because I made an interaction more engaging, more enjoyable for both of us but I go here most days and the barista isn't really a stranger at this point as I order from them most days. However I’m not going to beat myself up for it, tomorrow is another day where I can make more progress with a new stranger! \n\n**If you have any thoughts/ideas for prompts which I could use to slowgress towards confidence with strangers then lmk.**",

        "text": "The single best thing I've ever done for my growth. \n\nIn January I conquered the single most destructive habit undermining my growth in life. \n\n**Acquiring masses of knowledge.** \n\n**Then doing nothing with it.** \n\nAs Benjamin Franklin once said, “We may give advice, but we cannot give conduct. “\n\nSo the question then becomes;\n\n*how can we learn to pair conduct with sound advice?*\n\nThis is how I did. \n\nArgue with me if you will but I’m convinced the majority of **my** depression is caused by: \n\nThe habit of constantly trading **my future** for some small pleasure in the **present.** \n\nLike a con man saying, “Hey I’ll give you $5 today if you give me $100 at the end of the year.” \n\nSo my goal for the longest time has been to invert this and start trading small pain in the present for a big reward in the future. \n\nSo I trade $5 today for $100 at the end of the year. It becomes exciting knowing each day you’re building up to a big reward. \n\nI’ve set this goal maybe 2 dozen times and every time I’d attempt it again **I would immediately give up on this goal when presented with the thing I’m trying to resist.**\n\n“When you go to work today, eat healthy.” I then proceed to eat TWO donuts. \n\n“When you wake up, work on your business. “ I then proceed to binge watch Abbot elementary. \n\nSo even though I could remember what I needed to do I couldn’t find the motivation in the present to do the tasks I set when I said I needed to do them until….\n\n*I changed my goal posts.* \n\nA goal post is some far off objective you’ve set for yourself. \n\nA goal post for a marathon runner is to run 27 miles. \n\nIf you focus on running 27 miles you will probably quit immediately, as I would in my examples. \n\nBut if you change your perspective to focusing on a ¼ mile or ½ mile the task appears much easier. \n\n**Then your motivation increases because you perceive you can do it.** \n\nSo for my goal of delaying gratification Instead of focusing on delaying gratification for my whole life. I started focusing on delaying gratification just for today.\n\nThis became my inner monologue. “You can still do x vice, just tomorrow.” \n\n“You can still eat donuts, just skip the one for today. “\n\n“You can still watch TV just work on your business today. “\n\n**It’s kind of like a reverse excuse, instead of working tomorrow, I indulge tomorrow.** \n\nIf you take your vices off the table completely it makes them more seductive. \n\nIf you say they’re still available just not right now your brain stops caring about them as availability breeds contempt. \n\nPair this strategy with remembering why you wanted to start in the first place and I suspect you’ll soon find success achieving your goals like I did.",

        "text": "  I just turned 30f and have felt lost and unhappy with my life for quite some time now. I reached a point in my life, where I have to make a decision for my future.   \n \n\nFor the last 8 years I studied and worked in the capital city of my home country, after moving here from a small countryside city on the other side of the country at 22 years old. I always dreamed of living the big city life and at first I was everything I imagend, after nannying for 1,5 years abroad after my A Levels  – I had friends, studied at Uni and worked on the side.   \n I was always been quite a loner - having a hard time with people, bullied in high school and never been in a romantic relationship. Making friends and connecting with people was always hard for me. Besides the few friends I made along the way, I never really connected with people in the city on a deep, long-term level. I made acquaintances in uni, but after graduating, the contacts just ended. Then slowly, all of my friends moved back home and moved on with life (getting married, having kids)  and I was left alone, working and spending time at home afterwards. Despite wanting to make friends and going out to do things I like, there were always insecurities or circumstances holding me back. So in the end, I never did it and just went to work and home, repeating the cycle. At first, and with the pandemic, it didn’t really bother me that much. But as time went on and as I get older, I just feel completely lost and unhappy with the way my life is going. I think of my 20s as a complete waste, where is should have been the best time meeting and hanging out with new people, traveling, making experiences on many different levels etc.\n\nTo get to the point, I recently got a job offer from an organisation in my home town. Because of a lot of frustration and problems at my current job and having to look for a different apartment anyways, I’m actually considering it. I have until Friday the 10th to decide. The position and benefits are quite the same, I would have my old friends here, a lot of outdoor activities, a car and bigger cities in driving distance for day trips.\n\nBut, and here is the problem, something is holding me back. On the inside and besides the things I wrote, I feel like a little free spirit, who just wants to wander through life, spend time in nature, travel, maybe have a romantic relationship and just be happy. I’m having a really hard time with making a decision and feel completely lost, in what to do and what direction my life should go. On paper and looking at it objectively, it doesn’t really make sense, to stay here in the city. But on the other hand, I feel like, I should give it another chance, while working on myself and so on. All my friends and family tell me, to just do it.\n\nI just don’t know, what to do – I just want to be happy and content in my life….",

I've washed my clothes thoroughly and made sure it isn't my clothes that smell, I use Deodorant underarm and around my chest and back, I also use cologne to add extra scent. I've changed my bed sheets covers blankets pillow cases into fresh ones. But I always start to smell after a few hours AND I CAN'T PUT MY FINGER ON IT. PLEASE HELP.\n\nMy suspicion is the shower gel and soap I use when I shower might not be actually cleaning me and I should change to another one because it started after I switched to the one I'm using now (about 2 weeks ago)\n\nAnd my other suspicion is that it might be my deodorant might not be very strong and doesn't actually help , but that's iffy.\n\nCan someone please help, its embarrassing when I go to school I'm really self conscious.\n\nNote: I don't have any health conditions that would affect this, and yes I DO wash myself properly and thoroughly I spend ages in the shower washing myself its crazy.",

She’s quit sports because of teammates or coaches (not like bullying or anything just not liking people), she doesn’t want to go to any family-related outting (dinner, brothers football games, grandparents house etc.) It’s also laziness I think. She comes home from school and lays in bed for 6 hours with her lights off, doesn’t get good grades, is mentally removed from school, and mentally removed from the family. I understand teenage years and the pressures, I understand depression I’ve been through it all but she has never wanted to do anything to help herself.

For three years i went through bullying and ostracism, getting good enough grades to but myself a spot at the school i wanted to attend. And i got in. For a month when school started up again after summer break 2022, everything was great.\nNobody knew each other. A blank slate. Perfect new start.\n\nBut i was very shy and a little awkward. That on top of not being conventionally attractive and also, as others have said, being a bit odd is what i believe led to where i am now.\n\nDon't get my wrong, in the beginning i very much tried to put myself out there. Going against myself social anxiety and talking to people. Trying to joke. All the stuff you know.\nBut now my reputation is very bad. At least I'm not actively bullied, but I'm usually treated like air. I'm very much ignored by myself classmates.\n\nI decided to do what i could. I decided i wasn't gonna fail math class again, got my shit together and begin studying better. Wich definitely paid off. My grades are better and for the first time in my entire academical carrier, i past a math test with a pretty solid margin. \nI've gotten better at managing my finances.\nI've began working out. My parents won't let me sign up for any sports or anything like that. But doing push ups, squats, sit-ups etc and running is free.\nI'm working on what i feel like i can work on.\n\nBut I'm constantly pained by my loneliness.\nAnd i don't think there's any saving my social situation at my current school. \nTrying and completely failing also screwed over my social anxiety even more. If i didn't feel completely unlikable and uncharismatic before. I definitely do now.\nConstantly seeing my classmates laughing together, engaging in conversation, planing stuff for the weekends... It's quite painful.\n\nThe thing is, I'm not an asshole, i know I'm not. I'm just not very good at socializing. But i don't feel like there's any point to getting better at that. Because in my experience, first impression matter a hell of a lot. And if my classmates idea of me has have time to root ever since the school year kicked of, i don't think there's any saving my situation.\nAnd I'm constantly sad because I'm missing out on experiences that i really want but will never have the chance to catch up with.\n \nSo thats that.",

        "text": "Like what would you tell your 23 self if you were in my position?\n\nI feel such regret and cant stop the feeling i have for wasting my life and potential and not taking the changes i had.\n\nI am 6 months away from turning 24. I am in my last year of computer science degree. Just got fired at my part time ware house job. And things are not going very good. The only thing that is good is that i am sober now.\n\nComing from a poor single mom household i really wanted to change my life when i was 15. I had a great life tho, was sporting a lot, had a girlfriend and a lot of friends. I did fun stuff.\n\nAt 16 my mom got very sick and i started smoking weed to avoid my problems at home. This year i also chose a 4 year degree in media design and development because i thought i could earn a lot of money with little invest.\n\nIn these 4 years i turned from a motivated winner to a depressed complete loser. I canceled party's and other fun stuff to sit at home learning coding and wanting to make an succesfull start up so i would not be poor anymore.\n\nI got very into self improvement and spiritual stuff but also drug addicted. I spent al my money on weed and cigarettes daily and whenever i got the chance i used other drugs. The rest of my day was spend on internet, masturbating and scrolling to instagram.. A lot of people reached out to me and wanted to do things with me but i never did.\n\nWhen i was 20 and finished this degree i felt horrible. Like i was not myself anymore. No friends, bad physical and mental shape, bad friends, no girls, no money, no one that could help me.\n\nI should've gone for a job and earn some money for me and my mom but i was to drug addicted and was scared of working and also corona was just getting started. But then i started my current degree in computer science.\n\nThe reasons for this were i could get a loan of 1000 euro's for going to school and hoped to get so good at coding i could make my own successfull business/start up.\n\nNow i am 23, have 50,000 debt and i am really burned out. I cant even write good code and to be honest i dont like it anymore. My mom is still sick and i never helped her or made her proud.\n\nNow i am just so lost. If i just would have been more nice for myself and the people around me my life would be so much better.\n\nI hate the fact i wasted opportunities to make direct money, memories and friends.\n\nI regret not going for it and making money for me and my mom.\n\nI regret not going to parties, i regret not working out anymore, i regret not taking changes with girls.\n\nI regret studying this boring programming stuff for money instead of a trade or something adventerous.\n\nNow i am kinda old and far behind to my peers which i looked down on a couple years ago.\n\nI feel so bad for not being able to give my mom money and myself a solid foundation. I feel like i am just a loser/nerd that wasted his potential.",

        "text": "I would like to start this off with a foreword. I am a 20yr man who grew up in a home where problems were dealt with yourself, and only recently, as in a about six years, have found to respect and care for my own mind.\n\nFor about 3 or 4 years, I have felt as if I am the second person people go to for anything. I'm sure I might be over thinking it, but recently I feel that I've essentially taken a back seat to this adventure of life. The people closest to me seem to grow more distant by the second, my coworkers seem to delay more each day when asking questions, and I feel as if the world as a whole has begun to lose trust in me. I'm not incredibly bothered by this, no, but I realized that it's prodding the back of my thoughts constantly, manifesting in an Imposter Syndrome and worries of imperfection that weren't prevalent before. \nI am beginning to worry that I'm driving a thin line between my work, my life, and my goals which combined with my past of never truly being the one who others wanted to be with, until I found who I was in high school, and created this kind of backseat worrier. I have called him Zack in my mind to find him.\nI won't lie and say I'm the smartest, wisest or strongest man in the world, but I am at least good enough for me (I strive for improvement in all aspects). However, I do belive that this doubt may undo all the work that I've had to unravel from the tangled yarn of my life, and that, I regret to admit, shakes my confidence. Again, perhaps I'm just over thinking a problem, but as I'm sure many of you know, the ramblings of specifics helps find the clarity of the problem, similar to using a brighter light to spot mold in a wall.\nAny or no ideas are welcome, I mostly wanted to try and find an answer in my writing.",

        "text": "\nI don’t know what to do with my life, career wise, relationships, friendships, personal growth, any sort of progress really. I have not had an actual job for more than a year now since I graduated mainly because my mental health was in the gutter a year ago, but also the fact that I do not know what to do. It’s something that has been causing me a lot of stress lately and I feel shitty for not accomplishing much while my peers move on. I have a diploma in a field which I’ve tried to appreciate but really can’t see myself working in because sales just isn’t my forte. \n\nLast year before I graduated, I applied to a bunch of overseas Universities and got in but ultimately I won’t be able to go because of my family. To be honest, I had applied on impulse without giving it much thought because I had a friend who was applying as well and my fear of not knowing what to do with my life just pushed me to do it. I’m also not sure if it’s wise to put myself in debt for a degree when I don’t feel certain in what I want to work as yet. \n\nThen I applied for a bunch of jobs early last year but they all turned out to be insurance agent roles in disguise (sales is not something that I’m good at or interested in) so that didn’t work out.  I eventually settled on doing freelance work from home because it worked out for me but that was more of a part-time job and not something that’s sustainable in the long run. \n\nSo I initially took this gap year because I wanted to focus on my mental health, but most of my time was spent worrying about my future and worrying about being unproductive. Maybe it’s because of how I used to work and work without allowing myself a break, but I just can’t seem to relax now especially when I’m alone. I was diagnosed with adhd, bpd, depression, anxiety, body dysmorphia and trichotillomania at 19 years old and most of these were issues that I’ve struggled with for most of my life. I try not to see it as a setback and I’m still learning to be less pessimistic about life. From 2021-2022, I was regularly seeing a therapist and psychiatrist to get help. However, I stopped going because I felt like it wasn’t helping me and at times was putting me back to square one (I moved homes and was forced to switch to a different psychiatrist within the same institution which was quite draining and there just aren’t a lot of mental health resources where I live).\n\nI know it’s odd that I haven’t really given my future much thought as a student, but for the past few years, the only thing I could focus on was surviving one day at a time. It took everything in me to not end my life and back then I hadn’t had access to professional help yet so I felt like I was suffering on my own. Now that I’m older and doing better, it makes me regretful to think about how much of my teenage years were wasted especially when I was looked down on by people whom I’d opened up to.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me a lot is how lonely I feel. I know it’s normal for many, but I haven’t had a partner before and don’t know what it’s like to be in love. I’ve been trying to work on enjoying spending time alone but it’s so hard when everyone else has someone they love most and a person they feel like they could rely on to get through life with. To be fair, I’ve never cared about relationships until last year because I didn’t feel like I deserved to be loved that way. It’s a long story but I’ve recently healed from something that had affected most of my life and because of that I never really had the chance to experience life as a teen. \n\nI do want to be a better person and do something positive with my life. I want to make my family proud and for my friends to not have to worry about me. Someday, I hope to fall in love with the right one although I feel like I still have a long way to go. I hope I’ll know what it feels like to love and be loved one day.\n\nSorry if this was all over the place, I just wanted to get everything out of me and I’ve tried to tidy it up as much as possible.",

They or at least a couple of them, go out there way and say some aggressive, sometimes harsh stuff to me as a joke but they say they do it out of love or to toughen me up because I’m quiet or too nice and people will take advantage of that. I get dumb jokes that I’m a ugly bitch, a piece of shit, they’ve been doing this thing where they joke that I don’t shower. In our friend group, we tease and roast each other for fun and it’s our way of showing love but at times they go too far especially with me. I know it’s just them joking around but…..it honestly hurts my feelings and kinda crushes my self esteem. And I already have low self esteem as it is. I have another friend and she’s a female like me but she has this high confidence in herself and is always the center of attention when it comes to my guy friends who tease me a lot. She’s really pretty and she’s really funny. She always makes them laugh with her antics or “dramatic” behavior. They don’t say such aggressive jokes her way (not that I wouldn’t want them too because some of these jokes are pretty hurtful) and they always seem to have a better relationship with her because she’s more confident and isn’t afraid to speak up for herself. When I see them laughing and making harmless jokes at each other, I honestly get sad because I feel like whenever I join in sometimes, it’s just aggressive teasing. It doesn’t help growing up I was called ugly and was bullied so it gets to me sometimes but often I just joke back so I don’t get upset. Idk…lately I’ve been getting jealous a lot and angry at myself. I shouldn’t at all because we’re all close friends but I can’t help it. It seems like they have more of a close brother sister relationship with each other and other ppl in our group and I’m just there :/. I’m only typing because I’ve been holding this in for a long time and tonight online, my friend called me a piece of shit stupid bitch and it honestly kinda ruined my night because he was adding onto the teasing just to get a rise outta me even though as he said, it was just out of love and he didn’t mean it.",

There are people in this world who if you have not developed a strong enough sense of yourself, will attempt to hijack your self esteem and fill your head with narratives of who they believe you to be. If you don’t take the time to develop a strong sense of yourself and find out who you are, you’ll always be a slave to the opinions of others who constantly seeks external validation. I don’t mean this in a narcissistic sense where you deflect any type of criticisms that come your way but if you find yourself in an interaction with someone who’s only goal was to leave you feeling worse about yourself than before than you’ve got to learn how to tell the difference between what’s useful to internalize and what isn’t. You’re always in control of what you choose to internalize about yourself. No one can hurt you without your permission.",

However, I've been experiencing an uptick in suicidal ideations (I get them on and off but they're never fun to go through). \n\nThis weekend was especially rough and I was having panic attacks almost constantly. I had my dad drive me to a dispensary and bought starter edibles to distract my thoughts from the intrusive suicidal ideations and to experience a calm.\n\nIt went alright, 5mg:2.5mg CBD:THC content. I ended up relaxing and staring out the window for some time. Having conversations was very difficult as it felt like I wasn't the one saying the words from my mouth. I slept the rest of the day and woke up still hazy early Monday morning. There were no suicidal thoughts the entire duration of the high and I only felt the urge to look after myself and appreciate what things I like about living. I did not feel like prioritizing work Monday morning so I called out. \n\nStaying home now, I only felt like sleeping. I wanted to give myself the rest I've been deprived of. And while getting ready to work tomorrow, im getting nervous about pulling away from this new found comfort. I want to explore myself as a person now and feed myself more compassion and grace. \nI know now that taking that dosage again will put me out of commission for 36 hours at least so I'll reserve it for weekends. But at the same time I'm scared of the suicidal thoughts coming back to haunt me until then.",

I hope you reply, it’s been a really long time.\n\nI hope some of the scars from our relationship have healed by now. I hope one day (&amp; I’m being brutally honest here)…\n\n… that we can look at each other the same way we did before. \n\nI’m not going to lie and say “i hope we can still see each other and be friends.” I still care so deeply about you, more than anyone I ever have in my life, and I haven’t  told anyone this, except my therapist.\n\nEveryone thinks I’m over you, and wonder why I haven’t dated anyone. I just tell them the usual “I’m working on myself” thing. And I have been. But the the truth is, Q, I’m still so inlove with you, i always have been and I’ve come to realize this is the real feeling and it’s not going away. \n\nI’ve been doing really well for myself lately, I make way better money now, I have a new path I’m about to embark on, but there is something seriously missing from all this, and I KNOW it’s you. Sometimes I think it can’t be…\n\n… but I know in my heart it’s true. It’s you. You’re still missing, and I’m still hopelessly inlove with you. I want to be the one that makes you happier than you should be. I want to be the one you can always count on, and I want to create an amazing life with you, a family, and a true sense of home. I know I may not deserve a second chance, but please consider me and lets create a beautiful home together someday. I miss you immensely, and I miss seeing your family, and those random nights of chili with mashed potatoes and monopoly game nights.\n\nI’m so sorry for every mistake I made. I was so immature, and inconsiderate, and I didn’t know what I was doing or what good we had going for us. But I’ve spent so much time reflecting on it, I’ve grown alot more now and seen our relationship from every angle, and all I can see is two people fumbling with something perfect but gave up right when it mattered the most. I don’t blame you at all for it, I wasn’t being a good boyfriend and I’m really sorry with how I handled things. You deserve so much better than that.\n\nI will tell you anything you want to know. Ever. Even my life after you. You can know anything you want. I want to tell you everything, without holding anything back. The good, the bad, and the ugly. It’s all yours, i don’t want to be dodgy with you anymore. I don’t want to make you disappointed ever again. I don’t ever want to make another stupid fucking mistake with you.\n\nI am not in the same place I was anymore. I’m not the same stupid kid anymore. I’m somewhere completely new and I’ve been thinking about you so much lately, and all I want is you here with me in this new chapter of life that I’m going through. I just want to make things right by you, there’s nobody or anything else I want more in my life. I swear to god I will do anything in the world for you to show you how much I love you, and how much I’m willing to do to make it right by you. \n\nI want our love story to end together.\n\nPS. i have a couple things that I never got a chance to give to you. I’d really like to drop them off if that’s possible at all, even if its just for like 5 minutes, I would love to see you and just talk to you, of course if you feel comfortable with it though.\n\nThrough this all, I genuinely want you to be doing good. I’m so so proud of the things you’re doing, and you have so much talent Q. I’m excited for what you’ll accomplish in life. You are such a beautiful person, you are so sweet and you make the lives of everyone around you so much better. I look at the paintings you’ve given me every single day, and I’ve come to appreciate them so much. Lily got sick recently, and the painting of her means the world to me. I wish I could know what you were thinking, and how you feel about everything. I understand you might not want to talk to me again. I wish I could understand your point of view better too.\n\nI really hope that I can hear back from you. If there was ever an emergency at all, or literally anything, I want you to know you can always reach out to me - I’d never shut you out from being able to contact me. My number is still xxx-xxx-xxxx. Text me, reply to this message, call me, video chat me, whatever you want. You have all the means to reach me. You don’t owe me anything… but please reach out to me. \n\nTake care Q.\n\nWith lots of love… \nOP",

My dog is on his last leg and while I am grateful he is still with me, I am constantly reminded of his age. He’s visibly less happy and can’t walk anymore. Also I feel like there aren’t many great things to be happy about. How am I supposed to enjoy the moment when I’m in a classroom studying things that have absolutely zero meaning to me. I guess I can be grateful that I’m alive and able to study but that’s bs. I was born into a white upper middle class family in america, I have no knowledge of what it would be like to be anything else. Yes I can imagine using empathy but I am who I am. Idk I’m 17 and I just saw a video that made me realize how fast the last few years have been. I feel like I’m gonna blink and wake up a 40 year old. I want to be able to enjoy my life but I feel like there’s nothing to feel good about besides the fact I merely exist. Sorry If this is too existential for this sub.

I doubt people will consider this as I am just a random person, but it should rise you from your worst place into someone who’s extremely productive.\n\nFirst you need to know what power list tasks are. They’re basically tasks that get you closer to your goals. Doing 5 power list tasks in a day means you won the day. The goal of this program is to be able to do 5 power list tasks per day along with having a high level of fitness. A lot of this was inspired by Andy Frisella.\n\n#30 Day Win\n* 3 Power List Tasks\n* 45 Minute Workout\n* 10 Pages of Reading\n* Half Gallon of Water\n\n#Rise Phase 1 [30 Days]\n* 5 Power List Tasks\n* 10 Pages of Reading\n* Half Gallon of Water\n* 45 Minute Workout\n* Follow Easy Diet\n\n#Rise Phase 2 [30 Days]\n* 5 Power List Tasks\n* 10 Pages of Reading\n* 2 30 Minute Workouts\n* 1 Gallon of Water\n* Follow Medium Diet\n\n#75 Day Power\n* 5 Power List Tasks\n* 10 Pages of Reading\n* 2 45 Minute Workouts\n* 1 Gallon of Water\n* Follow Hard Diet\n* No Cheat Meals\n* Progress Picture\n\n###Extra Rules:\n* Must throw valued object in the trash if failed a challenge.\n* Must take no more than 2 day breaks between failure/challenges.\n* If failed more than 3 days, must move back to last challenge.\n\nThat’s it! It shouldn’t be that hard because you’re slowly working up to it. The extra rules might seem strange, as you have to throw something in the trash if you failed a challenge. This gives a little extra boost to finish the challenge.\n\nIf anyone actually wants to do this program with me, that’d be really cool. I’d make a discord and reddit for this. But I doubt people would care, so I’m just posting this because I’m bored.\n\nThe rest of the fitness rules are inspired by the 75 hard, a challenge focused on fitness/discipline. So the reading has to be nonfiction, no flavored water, and at least 1 outdoor workout when starting rise phase 2.",

Since graduating high school in 2019, I haven't accomplished anything other than becoming wasting years of my life. After high school, I enrolled into college to become an accountant, but after the first week I knew it wasn't for me and dropped out second quarter. Despite this, I was still full of motivation to make something of myself. I tried YouTube, Drop-shipping, Crypto day-trading, freelance video editing, graphic design, and voice overs, but found no success aside from the freelance video editing, although it was brief and I made hardly anything. In late 2021, I applied to colleges again, but this time for digital marketing, as it was something that actually interested me at the time. However, I decided not to attend because I didn't want student debt and was put off by the prerequisites.\n\nCurrently, my life consists of waking up at around 12 p.m., going for a walk, and then sitting in my bedroom watching videos, tv shows, reading webtoons, and having occasional moments when I try to muster up the discipline to work on a book to no avail. The only things I look forward to are drinking tea in the morning and church on Sunday, besides that, nothing. I don't know what I'm doing with my life and I wish someone could help me. I feel lost and without direction. I need to be brainwashed or spiritually enlightened or something because there must be something wrong with me. I mean, I just started learning how to drive last year. As far as self-improvement, I usually workout for a month or so and then lost motivation for a while and the cycle repeats. I've also been trying to quit fapping (for religious reasons). In other words, I'm hardly doing anything to improve my lame existence and since there's nothing I want to buy, I feel no desire to get a job and there aren't any careers or jobs that interest me so going back to college is out of the question.\n\nI'm sure you've all seen posts like this many, many times, but if you have an piece of advice or wisdom for me I would greatly appreciate it.",

        "text": "23m\n\nI sometimes have a problem of wanting to do a little bit of everything and overthink which one to do. For example, I had two hobbies I was interested in growing up and I recently I picked it up again where now I enjoy spending time each day/week to work on them and get better. However, sometimes working on them I will notice things I am not doing, such as socializing or going out to restaurants For example, I joined a meetup a few days ago and heard one of the members talk about the culture and all the food in this city and I was told myself, 'now I want to set a goal to get more in touch with culture, to try the restaurants, etc', because I was completely clueless about it all. \n\nI'm just overwhelmed because I also want to exercise consistently, and fitting that in, I feel like I am working all the time, always doing something. Yet I would like to plan it better because it also isn't hard for me to just not do anything and not want to do anything. How did you prioritize what you spend your time on?",

I was working at a shoe store for about a year then ended up quitting October 2022 because I wasn’t really getting the money I need to. I live with my bf and his family so I don’t pay rent (super grateful for them lol). I still need money to provide for myself and the repayment on my loans are starting soon. I’ve been out of a job for abt 5 months now, I’ve been just babysitting here and there. I wanted to find a job I would be at least interested in. But I don’t know what that is, I went to college because of my family even though I didn’t know what I wanted to do. So I literally chose a major my basketball coach thought was “easy” and just went for it. All my life I feel like I’ve been told what I need to do next and just keep going to school getting good grades. I was never working toward anything and I didn’t have a passion for anything. If anyone has any advice on what they think could help me I’d really appreciate it ☹️",

        "text": "I can finally say that I have not gone to post on this subreddit for advice. I’ve made a few posts in the past year (2022), however I feel at ease with myself and motivated. For my background, I’m a freshman in Highschool, I’m 14, 160lb, and i’m 5”10. I’ve always been the kid who switches from the loud or quiet depending on what room i’m in and who I’m with. Since July 2021, I’ve been trying to beat my porn addiction (really unique I know), but I have been also trying to lose weight (i’m skinny fat). Through out 8th grade, I’ve been this awkward, down bad, odd person who had the worst in everything, mainly because of my mentality. I ALWAYS had a hoodie on. I had oversized sweatpants/pants, was going through my spoiled phase, I wasn’t all that confident, I bloated my music playlist with stuff that I clearly didnt like, and thought getting a new pair of shoes every week (don’t worry i didn’t actually get them lmao) would help me solve my problems. This would continue till June 2022, where I started to change a little. See, pre-June of 2021 I was different. I was 220lb, I didn’t play any sports, and Just played warzone &amp; fortnite all day. Not even joking, I had 144 days on Fortnite in total. So this process continues until June 1st, 2021. I was not concerned about my weight, and didn’t stab myself to death about it and how I was fat. Before I went to bed, I discovered a youtube video that had some meme about an anime/show I watched when I was younger. Doing a google search, and I found it was Pokemon XYZ The series. It caught my interest, so instead of staying up unti 1AM and watching tiktok until I feel asleep with my phone still on, I watched a clip…\n\nand holy shit. \n\nThe adrenaline and chills I got through my body was a mix of “This show is insane!”, “How is this a kids show?”, “The animation quality is the best!”, and “I need to start working out.” After that day, I hit the treadmill. I still don’t know what the HELL got into me, I was hitting the treadmill for at least an hour a day (sometimes even two, checking my fitbit stats), and lost around 30 pounds (estimated, didnt have a weight scale however a doctor appointment showed my scale and I went from 210&gt;180). I also ended up, just enjoying life more. I still played Warzone, however I improvised by doing an amount of push ups per in game event. Unfortunately, come July I had relapsed, which lead to another, and another, to the point where I didn’t have one porn free day until April 2022. I felt defeated. Post Feburary 2022, I tried to get back up, however I tried to retrace my footsteps from June and if ANYTHING didn’t go correctly as it did the first time, it would feel empty and hopeless for my PMO recovery. Even after I’ve been humbled and more efficient, I still have those moments. \n\nMoving Past 2022, for 2023 I have big goals to take my life back. I’ve gotten heavily into hygiene, staying ontop of my school work, I actually discovered this parking lot for a business park located behind my house that me and my friends hang out at, and now I’ve gotten back into skateboarding. Me and my best friend signed up for a basketball league and it’s very fun to play in. I’ve also have been pursuing a hobby that I am very passionate about, which is game development. I’m starting slow, and on a platform I’ve been registered on since I was 8, called roblox. I have always dreamed of making a successful game on that site, from my childhood connection, and how I am very familiar with the game engine. This has also increased my pure appreciation for art, atmospheres, and taking in life for what it is. I actually have had some people take interest, which makes me overjoyed. Me and my sister found her old keyboard, and I have been learning a bunch of my favorite songs, right now I’m working on Kingdom of Predators(look on youtube, beautiful song). I have also been enjoying reading a lot more than I thought I would. I signed for this site called Wattpad a few months back, and read amazingly written stories about anime storyline spinoffs, such as the one I mentioned earlier and Hunter X Hunter. Anime is also something I’ve gotten into, as it just brings this sheer emotion that I can’t explain. It also is just so detailed with its character personality, that It doesn’t come off as weird, just someone greatly acting their part (more voice actors i suppose haha), which is something I see misunderstood with anime. I would greatly recommend HxH, it’s on netflix if your down to get out of your comfort zone. SPEAKING of getting out of your comfort zone, I now have 135 hours of listening to Kendrick Lamar since 2022. He played a big role in helping me get out there and hit me with a new definition of passion, and dedication. I would be asking for help on this post right now if I had not started listening to him.\n\n\nToday brings me to a new era of myself. I have covered a LOT in this post, don’t worry I don’t have anymore to write atm haha, but I wanted to create this post to look back on in a few months, maybe June 1st. I want to embrace life, stop being attracted to people because of their body, become more wise, reach my potential, meditate, read, and truly be amazing to where I am looked up to. Kudos to you if you made it this far. Please leave a comment on your opinion. My thoughts are just as important and valuable as yours. I hope you all have a blessed rest of your day. I pray that you will soon reach peace in your life. Thank you all.",

On the weekdays I go to school I’m finishing up my last year of high school then I go to the gym I am addicted, but sometimes when I am lonely because I don’t have a lot of friends because they left because I don’t smoke anymore because I start college I used to smoke weed heavy everyday for a year and a half but I quit cold turkey and then I started hitting the gym I was 135 pounds now I am 150 I have been going since September never missing a day. I read, journal, take cold showers for the last couple minutes. But when I get lonely I’ll screw up and watch the bad videos or do it without the videos but it is mostly on weekends. I’m not very bad as the majority i usually do it 1 time a day before bed, but I am working on it. Sometimes I will just do without the videos. But I feel like I can overcome it I just need to put in more effort I went 4 days but today I stayed home from school because I had a cold and I got lonely. I feel like I am doing good in every other part of my life I have high honors in school, gym m-f, read, write, study, I don’t smoke or drink. I feel like if I quit the bad stuff and bad videos I would feel even better it’s the last thing that has to go. I feel so good that I quit smoking cold turkey it makes me feel so good every time I think about it. So I was thinking about a dopamine detox I am able to stay away from social media I’m not as bad, i just want to know the benefits? \n\nAnd if anyone has any advice.",

I would be a sophomore this year, but I almost drank and drugged myself into a coma right before school started three weeks ago, so I decided to not go back to school this semester. Well, I just got out of inpatient and I have no idea what to do with my life in the short-term. Long-term, I want to be a counsellor for addiction or work in a hotel in the future, but just thinking about continuing at a four-year university makes me want to jump off a cliff. **So, what should I do?** I live with my parents btw and they are lovely and supportive mostly.

        "text": "I've seen people at all stages in their life ask, \"Is it too late for my to change my life?\" And my answer to you is a resounding NO!\n\nIn the past 2 years, I got a new job and increased my income, launched a side business and a YouTube channel, ran my first half marathon, lost friends and made new ones, and explored more of the world than I could have ever imagined.\n\nThe journey to find the real authentic me wasn't easy, but it was simple. I walked in nature a lot alone, journaled, meditated, introspected and began to feel into the life I wanted to live. Not the life society dictated, but that my heart and soul yearned for. While being alone so much feels lonely at times, it is an invaluable gift we all need to find our true selves.\n\nHere's my advice to you:\n\n1. Feel into the life that you want to live. How does that life feel in your body? What makes you smile when you envision it? Start your journey by feeling into what truly brings you joy. Focus your energy on abundance and not lack.\n2. Make a list of just two or three things that you want to change and make a concrete plan of how you're going to make those changes. Don't overwhelm yourself with too many changes. You can start with smaller things in life that feel lower risk (start getting out of the house more and meet new people through new activities) and then shift to more major changes (switch careers). Keep yourself accountable!\n3. Know that change is uncomfortable and get comfortable with being uncomfortable. It is in discomfort that we grow the most. Think about it....do you grow the most at a job where you're always doing the same thing, or one where you're learning, growing, stretching your skills? It's okay to be uncomfortable. Accept it and embrace it for what it is. Being alone may feel bad at times, but it will give you the spaciousness to shine a light on who you are and to discover all that's coming up for you.\n\nMy new mantra in life is \"I believed I could, so I did\". Believe that you can, and you will!",

I think i am pretty spoilt, besides some housework i dont really have to do anything else, but this means that i have a lack of knowledge in a lot of basic things. For example taking care of myself, cooking, paying bills etc.\nLately i am thinking about moving out and renting a flat if i have the money for it. I believe i could adapt to it and wouldnt starve to death.\nBut i worry that moving out would have drawbacks too.\nAs i am a pretty shut-in person, i dont have any friends and i rarely leave the house (often for months) I know that my mental health is not very good and i often feel depressed and lonely.\n\nI worry that if i moved out i would feel even lonelier without my parents, cause they are the only ones i talk to. I am really bad at handling stress so being alone with a lot of tasks with no one to turn to for help would be quite overwhelming. I am scared of it tbh.\nHowever maybe getting a purpose in my life (whatever it is, doing my own shopping, cooking, taking care of basic things) is what i really need. And being forced into new situations (like talking to a cashier) would improve my social skills too.\nBut this wouldnt change the fact that no one would wait for me/call me/text me and i would still be completely alone.\n\nShould this be my first step on self-improvement?\nOr is it too much for a start? Any tips/ideas?\nHow did you handle moving out?",

        "text": "A few days ago, I was hanging out with some friends, and late in the night, one of the friends suddenly got angry and started a long tirade throwing personal insults at every one and getting very loud and aggressive.  He was drunk, and not in a perfect place mentally, but I am still really heated about it days later.\n\nHe very casually apologized in txt the next day, but I just keep replaying it all in my head and get upset all over again.  I think the reason I am so upset, is that the argument seemed to come completely out of nowhere, as if he had planned it along with a bunch of very personal insults ahead of time.  And the whole thing was very one sided, since every one was just confused and trying to de-escalate, and he just kept escalating.  \n\nI'm feeling a bit frustrated at myself also because I know I just need to stop fixating on it, but I just feel way more hurt and offended than I can recall feeling in a very long time.  I'm not really planning to hang out with him again any time soon, so fixating on it is just completely unproductive- but how do I stop?  Thank you!!",

I realise this is because the root of the insecurity lies with the thoughts of other people, and I do not want to live a life where I allow this to hold me back from accepting myself. This is the case with any insecurity I seem to have about myself or my appearance, and knowing that if I was the only person on earth I would probably have 0 insecurities, is extremely comforting, and helps me embrace myself a little bit more in front of other people  \n\n\nPeople have way too much of a hold on our lives!",

        "text": "I felt simultaneously hideous and proud of myself over the past year. I was sick a lot, I hated looking in the mirror because my thin, fine, shitty faded black box dye hair with 2 inches of silver roots and bags under my eyes from both illness and lack of sleep made me feel ugly/unworthy of affection/lazy/gross etc. I had a really hard time with fake it til you make it, but I don't know that anyone realized how much I was faking it. Being chronically ill with body dysmorphia is like being a prey animal, trying to live and being well aware I will get eaten alive if I show any weakness.\n\nPeople will say things to me like \"It's what's inside that counts!\" or \"You're beautiful, you don't \\*neeeeeed\\* \\[insert whatever makeup/clothing/hair they pick\\].\" Sometimes they really do mean it, other times it feels backhanded, but either way feels dismissive and condescending. And I'm officially calling bullshit on that for myself. Being a disheveled mess makes me feel like shit and just adds fuel to the part of my depression that really hates how I look, which is my yellow brick to the body dysmorphia I suffer, which I rarely talk about. How I look matters to me and I shouldn't have people trying to convince me it doesn't matter.\n\nSomehow at some point in late summer, I came to the decision I need stop faking it and start making it. I went back to my self care habits, like skincare, wearing clothes that fit and flatter me instead of hating myself for having to wear my fat jeans when my regular jeans get a little too tight during that time of the month. Basic Model Phlo is just fine, I tell myself, but yeah body dysmorphia likes to say I'm not.\n\nNow I am actively fighting back. I'm tired of being on the self esteem Tower of Terror. What changed?\n\n• For the first time in my life, I LOVE my hair. Why it took me til I'm almost 39 to do something about it, I don't know, but I'm so glad I did. I am forever indebted to my mom for paying for most of my hair journey as I cannot work due to my health. It has truly been life changing to have long, tamed hair, I feel beautiful as opposed to someone constantly fighting against the horrible effect one of my medications on hair. \n\n• I used to get my nails done in college. I loved it and it was always super extra fun when I would go with my friends for our manicures. It's also helped me majorly in the past with not biting my nails and it is helping me again! I keep asking myself why the hell did it take me so long to go back to something that brings joy and color to my life? Not to mention they just look super sexy and elegant to me.\n\n• I stopped asking if I look nice and just started to dress only for myself. I dress fancy to combine exactly how I want to look and feel pretty. Feeling pretty is very important to me -- not out of vanity, but because I'm a sick person, there's a lot of things in I can't control, but I can control how I look. So self expression and for me clothes and makeup and hair are all important expressions I'm finally making 100% my own.\n\n• I confronted then stepped away from the people in my family who fatshame me regularly for the first time in my life. It worked!\n\n• I made fantastic new friends who lift me up and bring my joy and love and hilarity to my life.\n\n• I took the garbage out. No more energy vampires. No more emotional vampires. Sadly, I know no actual vampires, I wouldn't mind having them in my life.\n\n• I've stuck with my skin care and do it everyday now. That's it. My skin looks and feels great.\n\n• I shop for clothes by measurements, not sizes, so I have stopped associating my body with feeling embarrassed by wearing too tight/too huge clothes because of obsessing over size numbers.\n\n• My best friend laughed and awwww'd with me at my NYE party when I told her my theme for 2022 was going to be \"celestial bodies,\" and so did I (all we do is sit around laughing like Beavis and Butthead), but then stars kept popping up everywhere. Clothes, shoes, star-spangled halo headbands, the night sky itself! By the end of the year, I was hitting a glow up only the stars could have lit.\n\nI look in the mirror and see myself differently now than I did a year ago. I see a cute, pretty girl who's getting her shit together, a healthier girl, still with quite a lot of dysmorphia left, yes, but it's not crippling me like before. Faking it is so exhausting, I see that now. My advice to people is always be proactive, not reactive, and I definitely did not following my own advice for too long. So now I'm here, still not completely happy with the human suit I was delivered, I'm making it til I make it!\n\nI hope maybe some of the changes I've made can help someone else. 💜",

Well, I just got out of inpatient and I have no idea what to do with my life in the short-term. Long-term, I want to be a counsellor for addiction or work in a hotel in the future, but just thinking about continuing at a four-year university makes me want to jump off a cliff. **So, what should I do?** I live with my parents btw and they are lovely and supportive mostly.
