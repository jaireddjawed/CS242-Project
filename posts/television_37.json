We are waiting on an announcement for when each show's \"Season 4, Part 2\" episodes will debut. The HBO Max schedule for February is (of course) out already, and neither Titans nor Doom Patrol seem to be on that list.  \n\nWhenever those episodes DO stream, enjoy them. Because that's the end of each of those show. Speaking for myself, I've enjoyed them quite a bit (Doom Patrol more than Titans, but both have been entertaining in their own way!).",

As you guys may have heard the news about Netflix's draconian new password policy that was met with nothing but anger, it made me me think what will to the happen to the platform in the future. With so many bad decisions going on with Netflix, from removing the star rating system, canceling their shows prematurely, gutting out their animation studio, canceling their animated projects before they came out, the movie Cuties, etc. With their new password policy, it makes me wonder what will happen to the platform? In my opinion, like any other company that made bad decisions, they'll lose lots of money from all the subscribers that canceled their subscriptions in protest to where they'll have to file for bankruptcy and will either close their doors and sell their original shows to other platforms or, they'll be bought by another company. How do you see them?",

I found it funny, as did my dad who watched a few episodes with me.\n\nMany people also appreciated \"That '80s Show\" during its original airing, but it wasn't just a stereotype-filled representation of the '80s. It had the potential to be a decent show if given more time. While it may not have been as good as \"That '70s Show,\" it still could have been enjoyable.\n\nI am now searching for shows that aired between 2000 and 2010 and were cancelled. I want to find shows that the networks They originally aired on don't seem to care about anymore so much that they are available to watch for free on YouTube with all episodes available. Just like \"That '80s Show,\" some episodes have been on YouTube for up to 11 years now and have not been removed since",

        "text": "First off, I'm a critter, so come with a biased viewpoint, as this is something that I loved coming to fruition in another format.   And while I really enjoyed the first season, I didn't think it was nearly as strong as  S2.   \n\nThe animation is  top notch.  It realizes some of the visuals better than I could have ever expectd.   Some of the wide shots are just amazing, and there's very little that seems cheap or half-assed. But really what gets me is the way the characters have transferred.  This story is truly an  ensemble,  Every character has a compelling arc, and I've just been so impressed in S2 how they've been able to balance that,  along with making a beautiful compelling show.\n\nThe first few episodes of S1 are very much fan-service.   But within them, and following them  is a strong, compelling story.   In S2, I'd say the fan-service is still present, but it contributes heavily and well to the overall story that is being told.\n\nI really think they've hit their stride in S2.   I love the little tweaks and changes that they've made that clean up or improve things in most cases.   Seeing one character's struggle with a particular entity was hugely more impactful to me in the show vs the ... uh...  original show?   \n\nBut yeah, if you aren't watching it and you either like or are open to animation, get on this.   Great animation, voice work from the best in the business, and a storyline that is huge, but consumable.   Can't wait to see what they do in the future these characters and other campaigns.   And wow, it would be amazing to see some of the 'limited' series  they've done on the show in this format.   Amazon has a goldmine here, and the group truly loves creating this content.",

Honestly, the humor is pretty bloody good, and unexpected.\n\nThe progression of the plot is solid. It doesn't deviate from what the characters are working on, but it instead elevates their motives and traits. One character loses their connection to their magic, because of the appearance of the new/main villains. Another learns how to harness their abilities in order to save their friends and it connects within the story, it isn't a random power up.\n\nThe first episode may leave some new viewers iffy with the show, but it gets so much better after that.\n\nPantheon is another very good show, but the animation could get a bit wonky, but very creative.\n\nOf course there's Castlevania. Fantastic show.\n\nInvincible is incredible, but also can have wonky animations.\n\nThe Dragon Prince takes time to warm up, but ends up being quite good to bloody awesome recently.\n\nThe Voltron revival was great overall.\n\nTransformers War for Cybertron is a must see.\n\nI'm sure there are others that are really good, but I can't think of very many on Streaming services like Netflix, Amazon, Apple, and Disney+?",

And the summaries just keep getting longer and longer to the point of ridiculousness. \n\nFor example I started watching the Netflix show Break Point about the tennis circuit. \n\nIt started with a summary that was over 3 minutes long. If you watch that whole thing it´s almost no point in watching the rest of the episode as it´s already been covered. \n\nSo I just want to know, how many of you feel it´s a useful feature?",

Maybe I'm biased cause she's had major roles for at least a season in four shows I've watched religiously (Angel, POI, Dollhouse, Alias). But I feel like her screen presence, the way she conveys emotions, her versatility, and just her acting ability in general grabs the viewer.  Plus she's gorgeous and doesn't age [😂](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tears-of-joy/)\n\nWith that being said, are there any other actors or actresses you can think of that should get more praise but don't due to not being on those top tier, award winning shows?",

        "text": "I love The Newsroom and I also think it's maybe the best show ever aired on television. Mostly thanks to short running and incredible well written characters and stories. I also really loved Homeland and towards Season 3 it was my most favourite television series. Still I was a fan of ,,new events\" they tried to cover in Season 4 and 5. \n\nStill I missed all of those shows (mostly political). So when the war on Ukraine started (last year) I really missed some ,,current\" show going through these events in most spectacular way, as they did back then. So I started imagining how fantastic it would be, if Sorkin returns to HBO to make at least one more series, comeback to The Newsroom. With all the cast who played that characters back then. And seeing how this awesome news production tries to bring ,,the best possible television news\" in COVID-19 era. Which would be really powerful with Sorkin's vision and commentary. \n\nI was a big fan of this idea back then when I saw the ,,attack on Capitol\" and what would Will McAvoy thinks about that... but after Covid-19 news, and all those miss-info it would be a true spectacular show and comeback. Which could even run for two seasons with providing news about Ukraine conflict and being in a war with Russia. \n\nThe same feeling I have towards Homeland series. It's a shame they didn't try to continue with that show even without the original cast. Like a spin-off, maybe for Paramout+ only. Homeland is a fantastic show about CIA work's which looks really realistic unlike other shows or movies about it. Seeing agents from Homeland working during Ukraine war on a Russia and Ukraine side would be really interesting to watch. \n\nDo you have any other show, which could come back after all those years to prove that they are still needed and relevant?",
