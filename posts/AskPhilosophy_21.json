        "text": "What do you think? \n\nHaving come across an interpretations from Wittgenstein’s Tractatus by a rather flamboyant and emphatic comment on a podcast;\n(Read the comments on the page link below)  \n\nhttps://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2009/08/19/episode-7-wittgensteins-tractatus-what-is-there-and-can-we-talk-about-it/\n\nIt seems to be that we might argue that the Tractatus has a meta where it is itself a Langue game. \nSo this, the very first Premise 1 “The world is the totality of Fact” might not be using “World” in usual sense. But rather a ‘Group’ / ‘Set’ of facts as explained in the comment made by CJ at October 28, 2009 @02:30. \n\nThis would mean to understand the Tractatus you’d better accept the axioms and definitions of terms that is set out. \n\nAt face value this seems to present a paradox whereby to Read the Tractatus you must understand it, but to understand it you must have read it. Of course this is solved by reading it twice and changing your first ‘normal world- Langauge game ’ acceptance of definitions, to that of the Tractatus’ language game. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? Is the first premise and many other literal or can ‘World’ come to mean something entirely different just like later at premise 3 we take “Picture” or “Sign” not to mean a photograph or symbol in conventional use, but rather a ‘Thought of the world in its states of affairs’ and ‘a representation of an object in a propositional sign’ \n\nEither way the feature of writing about the miss-understanding of logic of language will make an example of how language will be misunderstood and this plays nicely into some of Wittgenstein’s assertions. I’d bet this although inherently emergent of language, was taken into account in the phraseology and construction of the work in order to further exemplify the points of his.\n\nInterests to hear other opinions, informed or speculation!",

        "text": "I've read about determinism and from what I understood it seems like free will would not change what a human would do anyway. Why? well, because we're trying to fill our needs the best way we can and free will wouldn't change that. The typical example of what food you would choose to eat it's based on what would make you happier and that's not a bad rule, even with free will I should decide to eat what. Someone with free will would probably do the same and if they don't why would be interested in any other choice that is not the best for us?. We're biological machines that have the purpose to try and be happy and what decides our success is our environment. But even if you had free will if you're born on an island with no food you'll die of hunger regardless of whether or not you're able to make choices freely. So in the end it doesn't matter if you have free will or not it's the environment that decides your success. That doesn't mean that your hard work is meaningless but you need to remember that someone taught you in the past that hard work pays off and if you want to you can be proud of doing that because it's the best for you. \n\nBasically, we're making choices but we're not making random choices we're doing the best choices for our happiness. So, free will is incompatible with humans because we have a purpose which is to be happy and we're always going to choose what would make us happy even if the choice that we made could be wrong but that's just because we lack the correct information. So in the end it doesn't matter if we have free will or not we're doing the best thing that we could do with free will, pursue happiness. Am I wrong for thinking about determinism in this way? I'm not giving up on making choices I just think that my choices are the best for my current situation and my situation is an external thing and that's why you can predict my choices. \n\nOur will is to be happy and that's why we're not free because we would do our best to be happy... but if I had free will I would still try the choices that made me happy tho???. We still make decisions otherwise we wouldn't deliberate for days about whether to do something or not, it's just that we don't have free will because our will what is doing is pushing us to choose happiness but why are there so many people that decide to identify themselves with free will instead of the human will that they actually have?. You're free to choose and you'll go through the experience of choosing like a creature that has free will would choose but instead of choosing to harm yourself, you'll select what would make you happier and like said before even if I had free will that would not change my decisions.\n\nThank you if you read my post and many thanks in advance if you decide to answer it and help me to understand more about determinism.

To preserve? \n\nI think that the sentence \"Build a Wall\" has really deep meaning and has many interpretation, this is the first time i felt like i just read a old book on a perspective of way to live, in just a game.\n\nHere's the context:\n\nThe Preservation - Qlipoth \"The philosopher gazes upon the stars trying to find the ultimate goal of civilization \n'Build a wall,' echoes in his head, 'Build a wall.\"\n\n-Adrian Spencer Smith, \"Fables About the Stars\"\n\nThe builder of the Celestial Comet Wall, the Subspace Crystalline Barrier, and the Great Attractor Base. Followers call them the \"Amber Lord,\" one of the oldest and most tenacious Aeons, having survived the \"Dusk Wars.\"\n\nAfter finding out a threat was imminent, the Amber Lord forged a powerful light-years-long seal that would isolate and protect the living worlds.\n\nThe Architects-Preservation\n\n\"The foolish have their wall of flesh, and the greedy have their wall of riches. When the end comes, they will all turn to ash.\" -Anonymous, \"Life Is Too Short\"\n\nLegend has it, the Aeon of Preservation, Qlipoth, is the oldest Aeon. Silent and mighty, Qlipoth spent light-years building a barrier around the galaxy, never engaging in any trivial conflicts or the mockery of the other Aeons.\n\nCivilizations across the galaxy speculate on the motive of Qlipoth. One said the ancient Aeon foresaw a disaster that could obliterate the galaxy, so Qlipoth built a barrier to protect the worlds; one said Qlipoth was willing to slave for other Aeons and was ordered to build walls for them. There is no way to verify the truth, but Qlipoth's tireless actions moved the mortals. They spontaneously gathered in groups to build a barrier to protect their planet. Some builders have claimed to fell the protective gaze of the Aeon upon them. They liken it to a gaze of approval, tinged with the warmth of the forge and the smell of lime.\n\nThe annihilation of a single star can devastate planets thousands of light-years away, pushing them to the precipice of extinction. On rare occasions, worlds are saved only by the walls their denizens have built. People who survived their demise no longer mocked the stubbornness of The Architects. Instead, they joined them, never to question their motives or meaning of Preservation ever again.",

In other words, is there a good argument that delves into or justifies that premise / axiom? It's not immediately clear to me why they take this as axiomatic or feel confident wielding it as a logical cudgel. It seems, from the seriousness with which later Greek philosophy engaged with the Eleatics and the stimulus it provided to later philosophy, that they must also have considered this challenge significant, but again I'd love some help in seeing where the teeth of this lie.",

Let's say the stomach is in a hunger state and a juicy apple crosses our field of vision. The eyes, and various other pattern recognition systems, translate the visual stimuli into a signal that permeates our bodies through various other organs and organelles that modify the signal further. One such organ is the stomach.\n\nWhether it's the \"red\" bit found in the signal, or the \"juicy\" bit added to the signal by our memory banks, the stomach is triggered to want that now that it is aware of an edible object. The signal then gets modified with chemicals from itself, from the bacteria, and this signal goes back up to our higher brain *that now is coerced and influenced to heavily focus on and want the apple.*\n\nSimilarly, if we take this same example but add another modification to the eye signal that's permeating through our bodies such as pain aversion because the last apple we ate gave us food poisoning, we now have two leashes on our higher brain yanking it in two different ways creating \"choice.\"\n\nBut really, when we reason this choice, we're also modifying this signal and feeding into one leash or the other. Whichever signal is stronger will break the stalemate (less our sympathetic nervous system tugs on yet a third leash due to fight or flight pressures) and our higher brain then signals our limbs to grab the apple or keep searching for another food item to appease the stomach.\n\nThere is no free will here is the conclusion I've arrived at. In my opinion, the higher brain is a control center that awaits instruction, but the instructions received are purely deterministic. Our higher brains are constantly influenced by hormones, chemicals, and electrical signals to go this way or that way even when we think we're choosing.\n\nI don't know where else to ask this and I'm sure I'm treading on commonly argued ground (and there's probably a name for what I'm arguing) and for that I apologize ahead of time. If there's a better way to phrase this question and another place to discuss it I'd love to know!\n\nDo we lack free will because of being at the mercy of influence fed to us from the rest of our bodies?",

Killinger argues that this results in man becoming like a ship with nowhere to go, whereas Kierkegaard, Existentialisms Father, at least had God, something objective, to ground freedom in.\n\nI suppose I could argue that God doesn't exist as per Camus' empiricism, but that seems like a tangent and not what my lecturer is asking. I basically need to argue that Camus' notion of freedom is somehow freer than Kierkegaards .... Can anybody please suggest anything? Many thanks!",

        "text": "in the translation i have of the physics, Aristotle writes that chance and spontaneity are both incidental causes in chapter 5. \n\nhowever, he states later in chapter 6 that chance belongs to the mode of causation “source of change” which seems to suggest it is an efficient cause.  from what i understand, however, he is only discussing how we generally speak of chance or how the presocratics would account for chance if they included it as a cause. \n\nin my interpretation, chance is like two bisecting causal chains initiated by two separate intelligent agents (ie., two paths crossing) as i understand, this means chance cannot properly be called an efficient cause because the true efficient cause would be the two intelligent agents, not chance itself. however, this seems to differ in the case of spontaneity which lacks the presence of any intelligent agent. \n\nin the instance of spontaneity, can chance be the efficient cause? how does this reconcile with chance as an accidental or incidental cause? and, more generally, what does aristotle mean when he speaks about incidental causes?",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/10nrvfe/buddhism_is_neither_a_religion_nor_a_philosophy/",
        "text": " Buddhism is neither a religion, nor a philosophy ... nor is it a way of life.Buddhism is nothing more than the teaching of a Buddha. A teaching for those who know there is something free of the every-moment experience of stress. A teaching for those who seek to be free from stress, but have no idea where to start. That's it! Nothing more. And, nothing less.Buddhism can \\[emphasis\\] become a religion if in your practice you create a series of rituals that you practice every day, in exactly the same way ... from start to finish. In Buddhism there are no articles of faith that are one of the defining moments in the practice or worship in a religion. The only deities that exist in the Buddhist cosmology are the beings that live in higher realms (plains) of existence.There is such a realm in the Theravada teachings called the Realm of the Gods of Creation. This realm is identical to this realm in every aspect except the beings that reside there can do whatever they think or desire. Much the same way the beings in this realm create what they think is all around them as being real, because this is what they think and desire.Some Buddhist followers, the ones who say they are Buddhist, but have no idea what it is they are practicing outside of the everyday ritualistic chanting and motions taught them by their parents, and their grandparents, on down through the generations, misapprehend who it is the Buddha really is. Even to the point of saying Buddha is a God. He isn't. He is no more a God than you or I. And here is why someone who understands the core principle teachings of a Buddha (the Four Noble Truths) don't believe in a God/god/gods. When you understand how it is your own thinking creates the reality around you -- the one you think is real -- then you understand how it is none of this exists outside of what you are thinking and fixating on, namely the thought of what it is you think is real.When you understand this correctly, you understand why there is no system of belief in a creator being who controls your destiny, who controls your moments of happiness or who control your moments of unhappiness, you see it is you who are doing it all. Everything \"Becomes\" what you \"Think\" it is. And the formula for understanding this is in the Second Noble Truth, in the Theravada tradition called Paticcasamuppada, or Dependent Origination.Paticcasamuppada starts off with \"Ignorance\" as the root of this whole process. That because of ignorance, there is a conditioned process, there originates dependent on ignorance \"Volition\", namely Mental Volition. Volition is the faculty or power to use one's will. This word is called \"Sankhara\" in Pali (Saṃskāra in Sanskrit). In the Theravada tradition the Pali word Sankhara are divided into three parts: Mental Action (mano kamma), Verbal Action (vaca kamma), and Physical Action (kaya kamma). The pali word Kamma has its sanskrit equivalent of Karma. Verbal action and physical actions are a direct result of mental action, in that you have to have the thought of speaking in order to speak, and you have to have the thought of what to do physically in order to do it.Let me make this entire explanation as simple as possible in order to lay Paticcasamuppada out like a \\[road-\\] map. I will replace the words \"is conditioned by, originates dependent on\" with a symbol ... -&gt; ... what is on the left of this symbol conditions what is on the right of the symbol. And so it goes like this:  \nIgnorance -&gt; Mental Volition -&gt; Consciousness -&gt; Name-and-Form -&gt; The Six-  \nBase -&gt; Contact -&gt; Feelings -&gt; Craving -&gt; Clinging -&gt; Becoming -&gt; Birth -&gt; Death. And so Paticcasamuppada becomes the \"Twelve Limbs Of Dependent Origination.\"As such, following this \\[road-\\] map the understanding is that Ignorance is the root of it all -- Not understanding what we are doing, we continue doing it -- and so we Act. We \"Think\" and from thinking we speak and do things with the body. Kamma (Karma) is a word used to represent \"action and the results of actions.\" Mental Action is thinking. So let's follow the map through from \"Thinking\", we become conscious, we begin to form a mental idea of the physical reality around us. Using our six senses (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind) we come into contact with the forms associated with these six senses (light, sound, aromas, flavors, tangibles, and thought), which in turn conditions the feelings we experience as a result of this contact. Experiencing these feelings we crave them because they provide pleasure, sensory pleasure and we desire to reunite with the experiences. Craving, in pali is called Tanha -- Thirst, a thirst for becoming, a thirst for pleasure, a thirst for the experience which produces pleasure which is a continuation in continuity of contact between the sense and its associated object. Clinging is a continuation, a non-stop conditioning of craving, and through our clinging -- not letting go of, attachment to craving -- things \"Become\" what we \"Think\" they are. This includes Birth, and Death.There are those who really do believe they are being born over and over and over ... continuously, as well as dying in likewise manner. As long as they continue believing this, to them it is continually happening. But for those that understand and follow the \\[road-\\] map, the only thing that is happening is the one is continually creating reality around them from one realm to the next ... to the next ... to the next \\[...\\]. What the world thinks of as death is a transition between creating, resting, and creating again. The only thing that moves forward are the results of their actions exactly the same way that throwing a stone in a still-calmed lake would cause waves to continually move outward even when the stone has stopped moving. It is these results we continually act on which in turn conditions new results, and in this action the entire process starts over again ... Not understanding what we are doing, we continue doing it, again ... and again ... and again ... and again \\[...\\].There is absolutely Nothing Religious to this understanding, nor to the way in which the understanding is gained from the practice which leads to the acquisition of this understanding.The whole point of Buddhism is to gain understanding. The path that leads to Enlightenment is a path to understanding. The only way to put an end to Ignorance is to Understand. Ignorance is not Understanding. There is nothing religious or philosophical to this. And if it turns out to become a \"way of life,\" well ... the map has been misinterpreted and the one following the map has taken a wrong turn. But, never fear, they can still follow it in the right direction.But, like mentioned earlier ... Buddhism can become a religion by the rituals we create and follow every single day (or hour, or second). But, this is not a bad thing. If the only way a person can even come close to this understanding (Enlightenment) is to create those rituals and practice to where Buddhism becomes their religion, that is okay. Eventually they will gain the understanding and it then no longer becomes a religion. Even the Buddha mentions that one of the fetters which keep one from attaining to enlightenment is clinging to Rules and Rituals (there are ten fetters: belief in a self; doubt and uncertainty; attachment to rites and rituals; sensory desire; ill-will; desire for physical existence, desire for physical rebirth; desire for existence in a formless realm, lust for rebirth in a formless realm; conceit -- excessive pride in one's self; restlessness; and ignorance).The end result is the extinction to the cyclic rounds through infinite realms of existence of birth and death ... an end to the mass of stress ...Where philosophy is more involved in a study of the \"fundamental\" nature of reality and existence, Buddhism is involved in understanding the \"ultimate\" nature of reality and existence, and that is YOU! The end result of philosophy is a continuation in reality and existence, the end result of enlightenment is an escape from the continuation.Nothing religious about this.People never tire of asking me what I believe in ... to which I reply, \"I believe in nothing!\"",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/10npcqo/are_there_any_critiques_of_advertising_as_a/",
        "text": "I've read critiques of property in general, or rent-seeking, or investment in general, but I haven't found anything critiquing the concept of advertising as a legitimate economic activity. Which seems odd to me, because I feel like it's pretty clearly something that rarely contributes net value to society at large, and generally if something makes money but doesn't contribute to society, it is banned (counterfeiting, burglary, etc.). Like, let's say companies A or B have each have a limited pool of money, that they can use to either make a more quality product, pay their workers more, or run advertisements. If Company A spends a lot on advertisements, and Company B does not, then it seems to me that insofar as the advertisements actually work, it would be at the expense of either Company A's product quality or workers' wages, and then Company A's successful advertising is rewarding it for overall contributing less value to society than Company B (assuming all other facts about the two are equal, hypothetically speaking).\n\nI've had discussions in my life about this concept, and the two general arguments in favor of advertising I always hear are:\n\n1. It helps inform the consumer of new products so they can make a more informed decision, and\n2. It is how a lot of people/services who do contribute societal value (Content creators, search engines, etc.) get funded.\n\nThe first of these arguments I've never found persuasive, because it runs counter to the actual reality of how 99% of ads I've seen actually work, and everything I've ever heard about marketing programs/marketing research, which seems to be almost exclusively about exploiting the aspects of people that are least rational. The second seems to suggest that the value of advertisement lies in the wealth redistribution it entails: people who do contribute to society are paid by ads, ergo ads are good. But doesn't this just suggest that it is the redistribution itself that is good, and not the ads themselves? If every institution that paid for an ad still paid that money to every content reator, etc. who was funded by ads, but no ads were actually shown to anybody, what would actually be lost? This just seems like an incredibly flimsy justification for something that pervades almost every corner of our modern lives, yet I can't seem to find any critique of it in the philosophical literature, in the same way I can find critiques of, i.e., wage labor. \n\nThe closest I've found is small sections of David Graeber's \"Bullshit Jobs,\" but even here his chief concern isn't arguing that the advertising industry is worthless, but almost assuming such a thing and then examining the implications of that. But I feel like there has to be more than that, because the critiques are just, like, hanging there, ready to be made, but I've never heard anybody make them, and I've looked around a bit. But hopefully they're out there, and I just haven't looked enough. What are the most focused/best works discussing the ethics of advertising as an economic activity in the philosophical literature?",

And that the \"reasonable\" thing would be to travel on the same road as everyone else, without any individuality. Furthermore, it is the mistakes we make and our divergence from this reasonable path that gives us personality and makes us individuals. \n\nI don't really understand what he is trying to say there, is this to show that we shouldn't only act with reason because we lose our individuality? And if yes, how far should we take this, as before he argued that we need to be subject to reason and right to be free.\n\nI'm a bit lost haha and would be really glad if someone could maybe explain this to me or share their ideas.

        "text": "I ignored the soft sciences growing up and in school but as I’ve entered middle age philosophy is becoming an important focus.  Currently the exposure I have to philosophy is tangential from lectures focused on mysticism and psychology (Watts, Krishnamurti, Jung, etc) as well as reading the works of philosophers. \n\nI am learning, but it’s disjointed and I don’t feel as if I’m maximizing the environment in which I’m learning.  You see, I’m kind of dense when it comes to abstract ideas and I need the point of view from others to help me see things that I otherwise wouldn’t so I’m thinking something like an online course that starts with the basic conceptual foundation of philosophy and then builds on top of that with the important differences between philosophers of days past.\n\nAlso, video or audio would be best and I don’t mind paying a nominal fee (but not like I want to enroll in college just for a class or two)\n\nSo, with all that said… anyone have a favorite course/lecture series that can help me out here?",

Reality TV is the most popular TV format (social deception like gossip, lying and affairs). In DnD people have no qualms about roleplaying as rogues (stealing, murder) and Vampires &amp; Pirates each have their own microcosms of Films, TV, Video games and erotica fiction.\n\nAll except sexual abuse, both of adults and children (pedophillia). But... Why? I mean, sure sexual abuse is terrible. But no less than burning a village and selling the prisoners as slaves, which to my count, is a core feature in almost every video game taking place in the middle ages.\n\nIt's reasonble to say Trevor (GTA) Ragnar Lothbrok (Vikings) and Jack Sparrow (Pirates of the Caribbean) would sexually abuse as much as they would kill, lie and steal. Why is it possible to write an anti-hero that murders and steals, but not one who rapes? And why do people don't mind murdering grandmas in GTA, but not raping them? Why can Robin Hood kill, steal, lie and even torture in the name of justice, just not in a sexual way?\n\n**DISCLAIMER**: Obviously this post doesn't condone or compalin about the lack of sexual abuse in media. But rather it's strange absence compared to it's many peers arguably equal in pain and malevolence.",

        "text": "Hello r/askphilosophy, I'm a 22-year-old dude who just came back to school(sophomore) after a long hiatus. I am finding the adjustment a little hard as I'm procrastinating a little too much but I am managing mostly. I am coming up on my 3rd week of school, and I have noticed a recurring theme with my philosophy teacher, and I genuinely don't know if I am just being arrogant or if he is failing to philosophize, or maybe even a little of both.\n\nSo far, we have mostly been talking about psychological egoism--only, when he talks about it, it seems like he already has a pretty firm idea against it. He does ask questions, but as the class tries to answer them, he tends to loop. He says things like, \"If everyone is motivated by self-interest, then that would be pretty scary/worrying/similar word, right?\" This is a completely reasonable thing to say IMO but he loops back on that sentence or the phraseology in a way that gives me the impression that he doesn't actually care to analyze the opposing viewpoint for our sake even if he has already made up his mind, and even worse that he is trying to persuade us to his already made up mind. \n\nHe completely ignores the idea of the subconscious playing a role: \" The problem with the subconscious as a reason is the obvious reply is: or not? It is hard to know what someone’s subconscious motives are, or if it even exists. In our discussion of P.E., we are not going to worry if on some subconscious level whether it is true or not. I am only going to worry about the conscious, aware level\" – Professor in a recent video lecture\n\nI get how this could be a way to simplify these ideas, but that is shutting down a pretty significant part of the argument, no? When you form habits and do things automatically, one could claim that these habits build up a reflex for your actions; from the perspective of psychological egoism, all things, no matter how noble they seem, are motivated out of self-interest, which brings me to another quote from my professor:\n\n\"There seems to be immediate reactions of sympathy. Why might this arguably be a problem for the claim of P.E.? There doesn’t seem to be time or opportunity to calculate self-interest.\"\n\nOnce again, this is a reasonable claim to make, but he does not take time after this to argue the side of P.E. He asserts a claim, and does not dive deeper into why P.E. could explain it. Is this not the whole point of philosophy? To learn how to critically think and examine all sides of an issue? My problem is not that he has made claims, but that he seemingly does not care to examine them more deeply for us or allow a real dialogue to occur. It very much seems like his attitude is: \"I am the professor and you are the students. I am teaching you what is right.\" I want to learn how to think critically, not what my professor thinks is right.\n\nSorry for the long wall of text; I just feel like he should be more impartial in the way he analyzes claims and so far I feel very disappointed in this class. I feel like he is not encouraging us to philosophize, but maybe I am missing something. I have not made friends in the class yet so there is no one really to discuss this with so far.\n\nThoughts?",

I’m not familiar with the field of philosophy, mainly because I consider it abstract and quite frankly I don’t understand - but recently I couldn’t shake a specific question I have regarding consciousness and have realised that maybe it’s more a question to be answered by philosophers rather than scientists if anything.\n\nConsidering that the field of physics explains how the universe behaves, i.e., gravity and physical forces, and that everything in physics can be explained through mathematical models. I understand it that physics is the “programming” of the universe, whereas mathematics is the foundational “coding language” that the programme is written in.\n\nThis brings me to my question, considering maths is the “coding language” of the universe:\n\nCan our thought processes be explained through mathematical models? Does the whole idea of consciousness just boil down into mathematical models? Could mathematics be the very basis of our thought processes? \n\nI know that consciousness and mathematics are 2 very abstract fields, and although some mathematicians/neuroscientists could give interesting answers, I’d love to hear a philosophical point of view on it. \n\nApologies if this question has been asked before, or it’s basic, or cliché, or maybe it’s not even considered a philosophical question! I’m not sure but hopefully someone could give their 2 cents. Thank you",

        "text": "What does it mean for A to be more likely than B? For example, suppose two people are throwing darts. The first person gets a bulls eye 6 out of 10 times. The second person misses every single time by a wide margin. Suppose now that A = first person is a professional dart player and B = second person is a professional dart player.\n\nIs A more likely than B? If we look at priors, I suppose we can say that a professional dart player is more likely to get 6 out of 10 bulls eyes than a non professional dart player. However, the opposite implication doesn't necessarily hold. For example, a bad dart player could get lucky, or a good but non professional dart player could also get 6 out of 10 bulls eyes. Does this still mean that A is more likely than B?\n\nOr should this question be answered if we imagine a bet. For example, **if** we knew that one of them is a professional dart player in advance, which one would you bet on? When phrased in this way, it definitely seems more rational to bet on A. However, we **don't** know in advance if one of them is a professional dart player. As such, in what sense is A more likely than B?\n\nWhat about the scenario where there don't seem to be priors? For example, suppose person A and B tries to guess where ten coin tosses would land. Person A gets 3 coin tosses correct. Person B gets 9 coin tosses correct. Is it more likely for person B to be a psychic than person A? Well, if we go by priors, I'm not sure how there seems to be any. In the case of the previous example, we have data that shows that professional dart players atleast **exist**. In this case, we have no prior evidence that suggests psychics exist.\n\nAgain, we can transform this into a betting scenario. If we knew in advance that one of them was a psychic, what would you bet on? In this case, again, it probably makes more sense to bet on person B. But not only do we not know in advance that one of them is a psychic, we don't know in advance that psychic abilities are even **possible**.\n\nSo what does \"more likely\" mean in both of these cases? Or is this helplessly subjective?",

Like, have they profoundly thought about the implications of that? They are pretty deep and dark. But they seem content at the prospect that life is just a material thing, that it is meaningless and that our experiences are trivial at best. In that case, I'd assume they're perfectly content with that thought.\n\nHow do materialists really live? I know many people and tons of people seem to carry some spirituality to live their life (unknowingly or knowing it). Do they get bored easily? They really think they are just the brain? And if they are just brain, wouldn't that be irresponsible? After all you could say ''I've done terrible things because of the nature of my brain'' (many ppl think like that). The truth is that you do terrible things because YOU do, not your brain. But this is another topic.\n\nHow do materialists cope with being a robot, knowing that they are just a set of random, accidental particles or whatever. How do they do that!? And how do they not fear death. Have they been through some kind of existential crisis? Or since they were born they knew the world was material? Why do some materialists want to convince idealists that matter is all there is? So many questions. Sometimes I agree that materialists are down-to-earth people, grounded in ''reality''. But sometimes I think they can be a little bit insensitive and disconnected from human nature. What's the balance?",

        "text": "What I mean by this, is I am reflecting specifically on America and how we are taught about the bizarre history of slavery for colored people and afterward segregation and discrimination and a similar concept for many other aspects like women's inequality and other similar things. I was wondering imagine if nobody knew or believed that. Would there still be discrimination or we wouldn't even consider it? I know as kids none of those issues occur because kids *don't* know. Once they become older and adults, society pushes all of these stereotypes and I think it really limits people. \n\nI think that my second point is labels. When we classify things words really limit us. Some people will say something like, \"I am depressed\" but what is depression if not what meaning we gave to it? It only has qualitative sets of *what* it is because we defined it in such a way. Now I am not saying depression isn't real or people don't suffer from it but when you classify yourself with things, you get all these titles assigned to you that you aren't really yourself but a projected version of what society wants from you.\n\n Idk these are just some of my thoughts and I want to know what other individuals think about these ideas.",

If duck behaves like conscious being then it have consciousness.\n\n 2. Exact physical process doesn't matter. Our brains have electrochemical fundament, but mechanical/gravitational and even obscure ones like China brain works too. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\\_brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_brain)\n\nSo let's suppose that there is a sculptor-psychopath who precisely carved marble brains with all inner details. All neurons, axons and other details necessary for consciousness. They once carved a long sequence of the brain states of a some human of every 0.01 seconds.\n\nThen, if we suppose that assumptions are right, we must conclude that this sequence definetely have consciousness. The only thing we should do is to replace time dimension with space dimension.\n\nOther psychopath-engineer took this sequence and then wrote the book where on each page he drew a detailed 2D-draft of each sculpture with no missing details.\n\nThat book should have consciosness too, if my assumtions are right.\n\nAnd here it comes: this book should have consciousness even if no one can read it. So no matter how obscure and difficult to decipher these drafts are, this book must have consciousness. \n\nThen we can suppose that hypothetical psychopath-engineer assigned a specific symbol to each point in space of your room. Obviously there exists such a set of symbols assigned to the points of space that your room represents a schema of someone's brain. (And every possible brain, too). Thus, your room is conscious. But this is just nonsense.\n\nIs there a similar thought experiment that I don't know about? And if not, what is wrong with my reasoning?",

Is their work still relevant? Didn't more modern philosophers make them look naive or just false? If no one really thinks they were right, why to study them (unless one wants to study history of philosophy)? If their work is really relevant nowadays that's amazing, but if not it's curious that you always start with them.\n\nMy background is in physics and at the university you won't hear anything about Aristotle, unless you enroll in a history of physics course. He was also a physicist (although the borders between the disciplines didn't exist back then as now), but his results or ideas were pretty primitive from today's perspective. You will learn about Newton though, because his results are still true and always will (in the approximation of small velocities etc). On the other hand, Pythagorean theorem is still valid (and other results in mathematics), so that's why I'm asking.",

And our brain is creating the illusion of consciousness so \"we\" think that what we are thinking is \"us\". (But I don't know why our brain would create this illusion and just do what it does without the illusion. That itself will be a great discussion if you lean towards my take.)\n\n\"We\" are made to think whatever decision we are making is being made by \"us\". But in reality the brain is just operating as a complex reaction to all the environmental stimuli and the already existing synapses in our brain.\n\nFor example, if we \"decide\" to comment on this post then that means the brain is just reacting to all the stimuli we are exposed to, along with how the synapses in your brain have been wired because of your previous life experiences. It could be a combination of millions of stimuli factors like what you ate for lunch, what temperature your room is, what you watched on TV this afternoon, what the humidity level is, what kind of interactions you recently had with people, what kind of light you have in your room, etc and etc.\n\nSo it's complex yet simple that we are simply doing things or \"making decisions\" as a reaction to various stimuli but our brain creates the illusion of \"us\" making that decision out of freewill. \n\nI am not adamant on this idea. This is just a placeholder idea and an apparently scientific sounding one to keep me sane. I'm open to other ideas of how our consciousness works.",

        "text": "Per an ancient Indian philosopher, this is the case, and I was wondering what reason there could be for this?\n\n&gt; If form does not exist, then do not cling to the existence of mind; and if mind exists, then do not cling to the nonexistence of form.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When, for some reason, one does not admit the existence of form, then the existence of both is equally unreasonable and one must admit the nonexistence of mind, as well. And when one admits the existence of mind, then it is necessary to admit the existence of form, for both are conventionally real.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\-Chandrakirti",
