        "text": "Ok so I’ve played two different sci fi games that are entirely unrelated in production but both had similarities of the nature of creating artificial sentient human like beings that are generally self aware. That is the NieR series (Replicant and Automata) and recent sci fi horror game Signalis. \n\nIn Nier it is slightly different as a global plague caused humanity to attempt to protect themselves by splitting their soul from their body so they could eventually return to them in the future. The “soul” part of the human is called a Gestalt. Unfortunately this ended up backfiring because the bodies ended up gaining self awareness themselves and became known as “replicants,” meaning the Gestalts could never return to them, causing them to go nuts. Despite not being in actual bodies anymore, the Gestalt souls are still technically the closest thing to naturally created humans. \n\nIn Signalis it is much more simple. Humans are just never referred to as humans despite generally being so, only Gestalts while the artificial human servants they create are known as Replikas. \n\n\nObviously both games cover existential themes, are dark in tone, and feature artificial humans. I just thought it was interesting that these two unrelated games from different genres and studios both referred to natural humans as Gestalts.",

        "text": "So, this is a topic that's been on my mind for a while, especially as I've been revisiting my own cyberpunk work over the last month or so. I posted a version of this on r/Fantasy, but I've since refined the argument a bit.\n\nOpinion pieces by sites like the Guardian posting such memorable pieces like this ([https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/oct/16/neon-corporate-dystopias-why-does-cyberpunk-refuse-move-on](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/oct/16/neon-corporate-dystopias-why-does-cyberpunk-refuse-move-on))  have made the claim that cyberpunk is a dead genre that's constantly stuck in the past. That it refuses to grow up. I find this super ironic because we as a society are stuck in the same era that solidified cyberpunk's main aesthetic.\n\nLook at our obsession with nostalgia!\n\nOur media seems to be perpetually stuck in the 80s and 90s, to the point that even shows and films set in modern settings sometimes have a lot of throwbacks to these eras.\n\nIs it really so far-fetched for a mega-corporation to paint their cities in neon?\n\nI don't think so.\n\nAnd I think there's something powerful to be explored in that space. Media has a massive impact on us as a culture.\n\nCyberpunk has probably never been more relevant, in my opinion. And, frankly, some of these worlds, while being very bleak, are just too fun not get absorbed in.\n\nBut, while I'm saying all this, I also think it's super unrealistic for every city in a cyberpunk story to be a neon nightmare. One or two, sure, but definitely not all. You'd have a wide variety of different aesthetics and choices. The world's a big place, so when you're world-building on a large scale, I feel like authors/writers should be cognizant of how wildly different present-day cities on Earth can be. There's only one Las Vegas, but there are plenty of imitators, but you'd probably be pretty surprised if every city on Earth looked like Las Vegas in the future.\n\nTo close things out, let's talk about copyright.\n\nIt's been argued that the constant extension of copyright by the likes of aspiring mega-corporations like Disney has done real damage to our culture, by not allowing a varied number of voices to re-interpret these stories and IPs. Just think about how many re-interpretations we've had of Sherlock Holmes, or Peter Pan, and imagine how many fun reinterpretations we could end up having of Batman, Mickey Mouse, or any other character or story that should have passed into the public domain already had those laws not been changed.\n\nWhat happens when corporations replace governments? What happens to IP and copyright? Do they just keep regurgitating IPs until we've got twelve different reboots of Blade Runner, Star Trek, and classic characters are written by storytelling AIs? Do people like these reboots? Are the originals hard to find? Are they vintage? \n\nI think it's a reasonable speculation that when/if that happens, those corporations might inevitably look to the past for something they can exploit. Most executive types are anything but original, and new ideas or IPs are always a risk. \n\nThis question is even more important with the rise of Chat GPT and people seeking to make a quick buck churning out AI written stories by the bucket load. What does this do to us as a culture? \n\nEntertainment, especially in today's world, is a very effective means of distraction from real world problems. Humans are storytellers, so, as a person who is a lifelong storytelling nerd (film, books, comics, games, tabletop), it's pretty easy to see how a media corp could grow to become a super-power in the wake of mass deregulation. (My own fiction features a similar corporation state that got its start as a media company, though it's left ambiguous as to what old world corporations it comprised pre-WWIII, so I've given this a lot of thought). \n\nAnyway. What do you guys think?",

        "text": "I quite liked it, mostly the first 3 books. I enjoyed book 4 for what it is, although I don't think it was the best example of what it was doing (especially not compared to, say, Ender's Shadow.) Books 5 and 6 didn't really thrill me; the format of interconnected but separate novellas, the characters they highlighted, and the overarching story all failed to live up to the earlier books, although even then I wasn't as big of a fan of book 2 as I was books 1 and 3, personally.\n\nStill, the first book was excellent, and overall I can see why the series is in high regard for scifi fans. If I had to rank the entire series as one, I'd probably say something like 3.75/5. (Would have been 4-4.25 if Scalzi never wrote more beyond book 3/4, but, that's just my opinion.) But I need to complain about this to someone, so:\n\n&gt;!The CDF has an officially reported death rate of 75%, which is later revealed to be closer to 90%. So for every soldier they had on rank when the Earth stopped sending senior citizens, they should have roughly 8-9 dead soldiers. Why didn't they just use those soldiers' DNA and grow new bodies for the Special Forces? Yeah, I get that the CDF was always a little skeeved out by them, hence \"Ghost Brigades,\" but when push came to shove they could have cloned their dead and had them (arguably legally) fill out the rest of their 10-year terms (which were extended indefinitely by the end anyway, and Special Forces almost never retire.) The SF were more effective than a regular CDF soldier, too. This solves the manpower issue without it being one of the known issues (can't use a total clone army because it's too vulnerable to viral attack, but in this case, you're still only using each DNA sequence once, at least once at a time.) For that matter couldn't they just re-grow every dead SF soldier as a new SF soldier anyway?!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Like, the whole point towards the end of the story was that the CU and CDF weren't particularly moral in the first place, and they were talking about forced conscription from the colonies when the Earth ruled itself out entirely. Why not just use the vast store of genetic data from Earth, in that case? There's already a precedent for using DNA from dead people, and they have no issue manufacturing consciousnesses for this DNA, that was the whole point of book 2. Seems an obvious solution for the issues that come up beyond book 3/4.!&lt;",
