        "text": "It sounds alarmist but hear me out.  Trump is basically the incarnation of almost everything bad to anyone who considers themselves liberal or leftist.  I imagine relationships between dems and reps are already strained due to Trumps obnoxious character.\n\nTrump is fairly vulgar, and in all the wrong ways.  He attacks anyone who is a minority, in usually a degrading manner, more often than not referring to their minority status is what makes them inferior to his eyes.  Again, due to this, I imagine many relationships (friendships, romantic, etc) are already strained due to his hideous nature.  Now by Monday, we will have a full blown rapist as a Supreme Court Justice.  Yes he will be confirmed, republicans are pieces of shit.  You'll get one no vote from Murkowski, maybe another with Collins and that's still enough to ram him into SCOTUS.  \n\nI just can't imagine having cordial relationships to republicans after this personally.  The fact that they worship Trump is bad enough.  Now couple that they are fine with a rapist on court is another manner.  I think him being nominated will probably bring an end to country within  2040 or 2050 the latest.  If you have two halves of the country increasingly not talking to one another then you are headed for trouble.\n",

A video went viral (locally at least) showing local police and border patrol arresting them. According to the city, they were given trespass warnings but the city still received complaints from the businesses in the area. Apparently, that necessitated the city calling Border Patrol to fix the problem for good. \n\nI'm pretty upset, because I thought considering the makeup of the people that live in this area (a large Hispanic/immigrant population), the city would be better on something like this. I've seen Border Patrol make arrests around here before, but not with the assistance of the police. \n\nSorry for the longish post. Wondering if any grey wolves have some thoughts? I've tried reaching out to some progressives that campaigned (and lost) in the primaries for local seats, but I kind of feel like no one really cares. ",

        "text": "Maybe it's some lingering remnant of \"How dare you, Sir!\" Liberal brainworms I was infected with or something, but it's absolutely fucking with me. So, here's my version of why \"abortion is murder\" is an absolutely self defeating argument, or should absolutely be a self defeating argument, if anybody was wondering. \n\nSo first let's posit that abortion is murder. We're all agreeing that that's the case. But no Republican is going to argue for illegalizing abortion in the case of rape or incest. That's time and again proven to be almost or complete political suicide for them. But abortion is murder. So if I kill a person 2 months after conception, how is it any different than killing them 9 months after conception?\n\nPicture this. I'm a afab woman. I'm raped. I conceive a child. I get an abortion. So long as it is \"for sure a case of rape\" and within the first trimester, most chuds would be cool with this, and even the chuddiest of chuds would have to pretend to be cool with this if they want to be elected.\n\nBut picture this. I'm a afab woman. I get raped. I don't get an abortion (because honest to fucking god my country makes it incredibly difficult and painful in some places and just throws out this insane propaganda and actually tricks people into thinking they are in a abortion clinic... yadda yadda, Chuds don't care about this part you could have safely ignored it). Then I drown my infant in the bath tub or what the fuck ever. What happens to me? I get sentenced to murder and possibly sentenced to decades in prison.\n\nSo you obviously see the contradiction in this position, right? I know, obligatory \"we live in a society\" bullshit, but understand teenage girls have served decades for murdering their children.   This is where you lean in. All the previous paragraphs I wrote, what you need to do is add a question mark here and there. For example, ask them the question, \" is abortion ok in the case of rape?\" Then advance the argument. \"If it's alright for me to kill my rapechild 2 months after conception, why isn't it alright to kill it 9 months after conception?\". 3rd possibel question/statement \" \"rapists often serve as little as 5.4 years. Murderers can be sentenced to life without parole. How is it that my hypothetical rape victim could be sentenced decades longer than my hypothetical rapist?\" Yadda yadda nothing matters.\n\nThe long and short of it is that most anti-abortion Republicans don't really have an answer to this or any other number of questions. The joke is that it won't fucking matter. I have a feeling that Republican senators don't give a shit about the allegations against kavanaugh. I have a feeling he's getting on the supreme court. I have a feeling  Roe v Wade is getting overturned. If this happens, a number of states have some fairly draconian laws that are about to be fairly immediately implemented against any cis women comrades I  might have who are reading this. So, good luck with that, I guess.\n\nTLDR: anti-abortion idealogies are pretty easy to pick apart in the modern world because there inherent contradictions are very visible, but none of this matters because we truly live in hell and the only reasonable philosophies are either gnosticism, posadism or accelerationism in the sense that the singularity happens, it's good like I always used to imagine it would be  (the great God A.I. loves us and isn't some kind of monster based off the data it was fed), and were all singing and frolicking in the rapture of the nerds.\n",
