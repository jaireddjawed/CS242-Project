A while back we picked up Gravitation waves from a merging of a Black Hole and an object whose Mass was in the Infamous Mass Gap between Neutron stars and Black holes, to keep this short as possible i wont explain and there's dozens of articles on it if you don't know about it. so we have never found a body above the thresh hold of a neutron star or below the Thresh hold of a blackhole until this collision but we were not able to observe what it was and was dubbed the Black Neutron Star. So what if this Mass gap is the universes perfect camo not big enough of a mass to be so dense light cant escape it but too dense to create light. but is dense enough to warp light around it and essentially act as invisibility surfaces we are developing to warp light around the object enough to see behind it like a window but not be able to observe the object it self. Making it the reason we have never found anything in the mass gap until this collision.",

They've been described as \"metallic\" and \"cylindrical\". Everyone seems to be thinking they're either foreign spy equipment or alien spaceships. But, a way less flashy and more random thought crossed my mind...  \nWhat if they're space junk? There's plenty of random bits of metal floating around in low earth orbit and, eventually, those pieces sink down into the atmosphere. What if these unidentified objects are just bits of space junk that happened to fall into the atmosphere and got caught in the Polar Jetstream (which goes across Alaska and Canada)? The cylindrical shape could be explained if they are empty launch canisters from a rocket or something of that sort.  \n\n\nI am certainly a novice when it comes to astronomical stuff so if any more experienced people could provide their input on this random theory, that would be great!",

The design would include two main components: the fuselage and the propulsion system.\n\nFuselage: The fuselage would be #constructed from lightweight materials such as carbon fiber composites, #aluminum #alloys, and #titanium alloys. This would provide the necessary strength and rigidity while keeping the weight of the aircraft to a minimum. The fuselage would also be designed to be aerodynamically efficient, allowing for maximum #speed and maneuverability in both atmospheric and space flight.\n\n#Propulsion #System: The propulsion system would consist of two separate systems: an anti-gravitational system and a conventional rocket system. The anti-gravitational system would use a combination of magnets, electric fields, and other technologies to generate thrust without using any fuel or propellant. This system would allow for efficient long-distance #travel in space with minimal #fuel consumption. The conventional rocket system would be used for atmospheric entry and reentry into Earth's atmosphere. This system would use liquid or solid propellants to generate thrust, allowing for greater control over the speed and direction of the aircraft during atmospheric flight.\n\nThe combination of these two systems would allow for efficient long-distance travel in space with minimal fuel consumption, as well as precise control over the speed and direction of the aircraft during atmospheric flight.\n\n14.4 seconds\n\n¬© 2023 AI Search Inc.

It travelled in a straight line with no visible propulsion or something pulling it, like a plane or helicopter. We could somewhat make out a thin shape around it, like it was a very thin object just floating very low down. We had no idea what it was, any thoughts?",

        "text": "I was sitting in a stationary car with my friend and saw a really bright light in the sky compared to the usual stars I see.\n\nIt appeared to be blinking either green and red or blue and red. As we sat there talking (maybe an hour) I would notice this object moving. It wasn't moving in any predictable manner. At first I thought it was probably a plane, but it wasn't moving fast enough to be one. It was also way further than any plane I've ever seen. It looked like it was beyond the atmosphere.\n\nAnyways, my friend and I watched it. It would move (from my perspective) in little zips left and right, up and down and these little weird looping motions. The total movement was like a cm per \"zip\" visually from my distance.\n\nI decided to set my phone on the dashboard and aim it at the object to make sure my eyes weren't playing tricks on me. I have a couple of pictures but it's essentially just an orb of light. While zoomed in, it was constantly moving out of frame in different directions. I used the home we were facing as a landmark of sorts to track the movement. It was over a semi attached house. Initially it was way above the house on the left, but as we watched it, it ventured over the house attached to it and kept getting lower in the horizon until it fell behind the 2nd house. Watched it over the span of maybe an hour.\n\nI tried googling what could be in the night sky and it said jupiter or venus but I can't be sure. Do they move that quickly through the sky/horizon? Could it be something else?\n\nI'm not suggesting aliens. I'm just curious about what it actually was. I can upload pics if anyone wants, I'm not sure how much it would help. I was facing southwest when I saw it. I'm in Canada.",
