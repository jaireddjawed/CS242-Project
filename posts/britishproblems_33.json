        "text": "*Context: I know a good scam and tourist when I see one, but a lot of this stuff was subtle as hell! That's my point, these don't outright seem like scams on the surface until the have you already reeled in, which is how I almost got caught out a few times. I've also taken the liberty of adding a TLDR to the very bottom of the post as well, because this is a lengthy post*\n\nAnyway, I went to *EGX* in September '22 in London with a friend. We're from Ireland, and we arrived in London from *London City Airport* on the same day as the first day of the event. By the time we got in to London, *EGX* had started about an hour or two beforehand. We had a few hours to kill before our accommodation was ready, so we got brunch at a local, and then decided to go to *EGX* with bags in-toe - and carried them around with us.\n\nWhy we didn't check our bags in at *ExCel*, I'll never know - but I suppose it would have been an unnecessary expense anyway, for the sake of a few hours. We ideally would have liked to have left our bags in our accommodation before going to *EGX*, but it was it is, even if my historically shite back flared up for the rest of the trip to London, by stressing it out carrying heavy bags.\n\nAnyway, between driving, flying and walking, I'd personally been travelling since about 2am that morning since I live a few hours from *Dublin Airport.* My friend was much luckier, since he lives in Dublin, he was able to roll in to the airport at about 6am. I'd had very little to eat other than a bowl of porridge and a coffee by this point. So we're at *EGX* anyway, taking our first browse around the venue at about 2pm, and we pass by all of the food trucks inside.\n\nI, being quite hungry at this point from all the travelling, lack of food, sore back probably not helping matters, decided to buy a hotdog from one of the food trucks. The first red flag should have been that there were no prices on anything, just a menu. I kind of knew it would probably be overpriced, but not *that* overpriced.\n\nI have IBS, so I can't consume onions, sauces, wheat, or even pork, without fucking myself up. I'm very limited to what I can consume, but I can have little bits of my poison once in a while and be okay - but if I overdo it, I'm fucked. So to avoid fucking myself over with IBS issues, I decided to get the hotdog plain. Just hotdog and the bun, nothing else, to hold off as much as possible on poisoning myself. I'm not a fan of onions or ketchup anyway, regardless of IBS - so I was thinking it'd be a win/win for me either way.\n\nAnyway, I'm standing there whilst they're making the hotdog, thinking to myself \"oh surely it'll be cheaper because I didn't go for the extras\" - and then, do you want to know what they charged me for what amounted to a plain piece of bread with a big sausage in it? £8.\n\nWhat a joke. That's no slight on *EGX* either, because the food trucks were just renting space into the venue - so it's not their fault. These food trucks just knew they could charge an arm and a leg for overpriced food and get away with it, given the circumstances. At the same time, I was so hungry and desperate, I kinda bit the bullet, but even at that £8 is overpriced as hell.\n\nFor the rest of the trip, I stuck to eating cereal inside the apartment in the morning, and then ate out like a king at night in all of the surrounding restaurants. I will say, for being in the centre of London, the vast majority of the restaurant food (like 95%) was actually reasonably priced, which I was surprised by - and it was emaculate as well, given the cheap pricing. I found the 12.5% mandatory tip on all restaurant food to be peculiar, but I get it - we all gotta get paid, and with the price of rent in London being so insanely high, I totally understand the need to charge a tip. I just found it peculiar because it's the only place in the UK I've visited so far that has mandatory tips.\n\nI say 95% of the restaurant food was reasonably priced, because I remember one particular restaurant incident where I got ripped off. This was one of the fancier places we dined in, although oddly probably the one with the least exciting food. Still like a 7/10, but that's kinda disappointing when everywhere else has been a 9/10. I'm a bit anal when it comes to drinking water, just because growing up in Ireland - tap water a lot of the times is undrinkable. I also get headaches super easily if I'm dehydrated, so I drink as much water as possible.\n\nSo whenever I'm out and about, I've made it a habit to order bottled water rather than tap water - and boy oh boy did I get ripped off. I'll chalk this incident up to inexperience and stupidity mixed with tiredness, because the moment I ordered it I thought \"Oh jesus, this fancy place is probably gonna charge fancy prices\" - because believe it or not, a single bottle of water was £12. I bought a second bottle after that as well... *for some reason*.\n\nWe went to another place, easily a 10/10 for me, and also tried to charge us for stuff that we didn't even order or buy. The bill was like 2/3 more expensive than it should have been. I don't know if they clocked that we were tourists, or it was a genuine mistake, but the whole situation just had a weird vibe. We told them, and they were a bit defensive about it initially - but once they realized (or \"realized) - they handed us the correct bill and all was cool. We also went back to this same restaurant a second time because we enjoyed it so much, and all was good - which leads me to believe it might been a genuine mistake.\n\n*The London Eye!* Oh boy, what a rip-off. £37 standard rate to join the queue, or £51 to skip the queue &amp; get VIP champers. We get there and we suss out the queue. It seems like it's moving fairly quickly, so after some debating, we decided to go with the standard £37. I was aware that *The London Eye* was a tourist trap before we went, so I thought £37 wasn't actually that bad considering - and it wouldn't have been, if it weren't for the wait we had. Two and a half hours we stood in the queue to get on what amounts to an over-priced over-marketed Ferris Wheel. Don't get me wrong, the view was great, and we got a great day of weather for it - but that long wait kind of ruined it for me personally, not to mention that our pod was crammed to the hilt. We would have been better just riding the *IFS Cloud Cable Car*'s by the *o2* for £10 return, which we done a few days later anyway. It was a much better experience considering the price and the fact we had no wait at all.\n\nOh, our apartment also tried to rip us off as well. Our apartment was cosy, had a nice view, was a nice size - and looked nice on the *AirBnb* listing. We got there and it looked like the listing, and it was clean. Then we encountered a few red flags. The TV remote had just... *vanished*. We searched that apartment top to bottom, and the remote was nowhere to be found; it didn't really matter because we were barely in the apartment, but it still would've been nice to watch TV with Breakfast. Our patio door was halfway between broken and jammed as well, so we didn't touch it at all for fear of breaking - *aaaaand* the blinds on the patio door had all fallen off too. We had initially meant to visit the landlord/host to let him know, but we had lack of time, so one day turned in to two - and we ended up not contacting him at all. I speculate that whoever was in the apartment before us had a great nights fun with alcohol; they likely fell against the patio door, breaking it and the blinds - and probably threw the TV remote over the balcony.\n\nHere's the kicker. On our last day we're in *London City Airport* about to depart, and my friend (who made the booking) gets a notification from *AirBnB* for a €600 charge for damages, with a picture attached of the patio door where it had been completely ripped off the hinges. Luckily, we had both taken videos (not formally, but more like \"hey here's us on vacation\") on *Snapchat* both when we first got there and before we left. In both videos you can see the patio door is *not* broken. So we're in the middle of the airport sending videos to the landlord/host like \"Hey we didn't break it, here's our proof\" yadda yadda. They got back to us the next day and said they wouldn't charge us - so we dodged a bullet there.\n\nThe peculiar thing is that were only charging us for the \"broken door\" but not the already damaged blinds or missing TV remote. I don't think there are any shenanigans going on with the landlord/host's side of things, because all the *AirBnb* reviews were super positive. I speculate that maybe a cleaner had been using the apartment when they weren't meant to be, broke some shit whilst drunk, and then tried to pin it on us. At the same time, we had to collect the keys for the apartment from a taxi rank, which was... odd. It was also clear that the landlord/host never visited his apartments because if he did, he'd have seen the broken shit *before* we got there. Also, they didn't charge us for the blinds or TV remote, so really, who knows what the hell was going on. A dodgy situation all round.\n\nIt probably sounds like I've done a lot of complaining about London, and I have, but overall besides they few incidents, I actually really enjoyed my time in London. I managed to be there short of a week and spent less than £500 overall in a week between buying merch, sight seeing, *Uber*'s, souvenirs, groceries, and eating like a king. It's just those few incidents that shaped my opinion on how easily you can get ripped off subtly if you're not careful. It was a good experience for myself to be more cautious next time as well! It's not to be taken too seriously, because I can also see the humour in also getting scammed multiple times. I overall enjoyed my stay regardless, and I want to go back in July for *Money in the Bank* at the *o2* \\- if money suffices.\n\nAnybody else have any similar experiences, with UK related vacations?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*TLDR, Five Incidents:*\n\n\\- Charged £8 for a hotdog inside of *EGX* at *ExCel.* A plain hotdog, just bun &amp; sausage.\n\n\\- Charged £12 for a bottle of water in a restaurant when the bill came down. I bought two, so £24 in total. This wasn't priced on the menu.\n\n\\- Almost scammed in another restaurant with a bill 2/3's more expensive than our own. We ultimately didn't get scammed, but only after we challenged it. It might have been a genuine mistake, but who knows.\n\n\\- Charged £37 for *The London Eye.* Its an obvious tourist trap, so I thought £37 wasn't too bad. The two-and-a-half hour wait in the queue did not make it worth it at all, though.\n\n\\- Almost scammed for €600 by our *AirBnb* \"for damages\" to a broken patio door that we didn't break. We had video proof we didn't break it, so we didn't get scammed\n\n\\- My point is that I didn't realize how subtle some scams can be, and I ultimately find it humours in retrospect that I was almost scammed multiple times. Its a learning experience at the end of the day.",

I'm sorry I can't afford to go months without payment or don't want to get burnt out using every small amount of spare time I have chasing a dream few actually attain while also working a soul crushing 9-5 job just to make sure i have cash each week .\n\nTheir is a difference between optimism and delusion. I used to genuinely enjoy learning and playing but realistically its a choice between being broke all the time deep in student debt or other debt but still chasing some dream I had when I was 15 that I still haven't accomplished or sweeping the floors of asda for minimum wage but still knowing im bringing home some type of income on a consistent basis.",

Because I'm particularly helpful and public spirited, I leave them with the handles facing out because anything else would, in my mind, be literal madness. However, after emptying the bins the binman always puts them back with the handles _against_ the hedge. Yeah, I know, I can't understand it either. It's not just a question of why, but how does he do that even? Are any of you guys binmen? Am I making a mistake in leaving them handles out? Do binmen have a crazy proprietary way of moving bins? Am I actually being unhelpful leaving them handles out?",
