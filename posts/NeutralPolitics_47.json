        "text": "Currently in the American court systems, each party involved in a case bears the costs of litigation. This is known colloquially as the \"[American Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_rule_(attorney%27s_fees)\". The American judicial system originated as an offshoot of the English judicial system at the time (18th century). Originally, America followed the \"English Rule\" (e.g. \"loser pays\"). [However, in response to what was seen as abuses with regards to legal fees, Congress enacted the 1853 fee bill, which limited the losing party to only paying the $20 docket fee.](http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1596&amp;context=aulr) This bill has not been amended or superseded to this day. There are some exceptions to the American Rule at the federal and state levels, but the American Rule is the default rule in most cases.\n\n\nThere have been criticisms leveled against the American Rule:\n\n- The American Rule promotes the filing of frivolous lawsuits, as the filing individual does not have to incur the same costs as the opposing side. The increase in frivolous lawsuits in turn leads to congestion of the judicial system.\n\n\n- The American Rule allows those of higher wealth to bury the opposing party with delays and motions.\n\n- [The American Rule increases the cost of medical care](http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics/news/tort-reform-necessary-solve-defensive-medicine) ; also known as \"defensive medicine\"\n\nThe [English rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_rule_(attorney%27s_fees), currently in use in Alaska, the UK, and Canada, has the losing party be responsible for paying the costs. [This system is not without is problems](https://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/November-December-2005/argument_kritzer_novdec05.msp), as the costs of litigation are higher compared to the American Rule, but the rates of litigation remain unchanged. Also, plaintiffs are discouraged from pursuing what may be meritous cases due to their fear of incurring fees if they lose.\n\nWhat tort reform measures have been proposed to make the judicial system more equitable between parties of different levels of wealth? If any of these measures have been implemented, what have the results been?",

        "text": "Today, in keeping with [its campaign promise,](https://www.liberal.ca/realchange/marijuana/) the Liberal government introduced legislation to Parliament to legalize marijuana. According to [this summary by the CBC, the legislation would:](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/marijuana-legal-bill-1.4069178)\n\n* Allow people to possess up to 30 grams of dried or fresh cannabis and sets the minimum at 18 years of age, though provinces can set a higher legal age.\n\n* Allow consumers to grow up to four plants at home or buy from a licensed retailer. Dried and fresh cannabis and cannabis oil will be available first, with edible products to become available later.\n\n* Provide for ticketing for possession that exceeds the personal limit by small amounts, or up to 14 years in jail for an illegal distribution or sale, and impose new penalties of up to 14 years in jail for giving or selling marijuana to minors.\n\n* Introduce a new offence with a penalty of up to 14 years in jail will also be created for using a youth to commit a cannabis-related offence.\n\n*  Youth who are found in possession of up to five grams of marijuana would not be criminally prosecuted.\n\n* Prohibit marketing to appeal to youth.\n\n* Prohibit sales through self-service display or vending machines.\n\n* make it illegal to drive within two hours of having an illegal level of drugs in the blood, with penalties ranging from a $1,000 fine to life imprisonment, depending on the level of drugs in the blood and whether someone was injured or killed as a result of the impairment.\n\n* Does not prevent provinces from allowing sales at the same place as alcohol.\n\n* Prohibit tourists from bringing pot past the border, but allows them to use pot while in Canada.\n\nObviously there are a lot of parts to this, but it's a major piece of legislation and I think worthy of debate.  What are the pros and cons of the points above, and of the scheme as a whole?",

        "text": "While not new news, it was recently mentioned in a /r/neutralpolitics conversation that [the overwhelming majority of warrants requested from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) are approved.](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cybersecurity-surveillance-idUSKCN0XR009)\n\nThis is pertinent to [the recent report about Carter Page](\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-obtained-fisa-warrant-to-monitor-former-trump-adviser-carter-page/2017/04/11/620192ea-1e0e-11e7-ad74-3a742a6e93a7_story.html) insofar as it is used to derive an assessment of the FISC's credibility and therefore the meaningfulness of that report.\n\n[The law governing the issuance of FISA-controlled warrants can be found here.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1805)\n\nIt has been observed that the FISC has authorized activities that would not withstand rigorous scrutiny, though this pertained specifically to unwarranted surveillance. [Wikipedia covers the context well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_warrantless_surveillance_(2001%E2%80%9307)), but the key note for this discussion is that the law had to be amended, thereby obviating ambiguity about the specific activities' legality (i.e. rigorous external scrutiny made it apparent the FISC was not necessarily executing its oversight entirely in accordance with existing law). \n\nEven considering such criticism of the FISC, it seems imprudent to dismiss entirely the existence of non-public, opaque courts tasked with reviewing and controlling the ways the executive branch manages classified information and executes classified operations. By definition you can't review classified information or activities publicly, but this seems to contradict [constitutional protections guaranteed to US citizens.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)\n\nSo how can US law be changed to allow for the necessary existence of \"secret\" courts while ensuring those courts don't overstep legal constraints or constitutional protections? How do you you provide appropriate judicial oversight of programs, activities, and information that one or more affected parties can't even know exist? Or, I suppose, does anyone think our current legal framework for this is more or less appropriate?",
