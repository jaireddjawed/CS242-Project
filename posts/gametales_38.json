        "text": "Now we get to the story of the giant and the noble. Once again our crew is:\n\nRathkantos- Me, Dragonborn cleric to Bahamut\n\nThrask- Half-Ork barbarian that collects jaw bones\n\nVlag- Fighter with a very heavy Scottish accent\n\nGree- Ranger who was a very shelter noble and jumped on some bees\n\nKaliva The Magnificent- Wizard, and that is actually his legal name\n\nSomewhere off to the east a keep was being assaulted by an army of orks so we were sent to get reinforcements from the capitol. Unfortunately the fastest way to the city was directly through some very haunted mountains. The first night we were there I was on watch and saw two spirit like elks, so naturally I walked up to them and poked them. This was a terrible decision because right when I got up to them they opened their mouths and two hellhounds jumped out. After Kaliva literally disintegrating the insides of one of them and skinning the pelt the other we went back to sleep.\n\nOn the third night in the mountains a few of us were woken up by very loud footsteps. As we steadily woke up we found what it was, a very large mountain giant. At this point we are all getting ready to fight it, but then off to the side we hear, \"I roll to seduce the giant.\" Gree had decided that she really wanted this giant. At this point we are all snickering under our breath as they go to roll, it was a nat 20. We all just burst out laughing, and the DM just said, \"Fine, the giant looks at you and begins move closer.\" None of us had any idea if we should intervene or not as the giant picked her up. We started to do things when the giant sprinted off into the darkness with her in his hand. After that we just killed the giant and made our way to the city.\n\nThat is the story of seducing the giant, right now you have caught up to where we are at this point in the campain, but this solidified in my mind that this was going to be a great campaign.\n\nAlso we stream this campaign every Thursday at 6 P.M. PST. so if you want to come in and witness this for yourself then there it is. www.twitch.tv/randomslurpiness        ",

        "text": "This was the first campaign I ran, and the tales are still spoken of by those gamers to other gamers.\n\nThe scenario was this: It's the Left 4 Dead version of the zombie apocalypse. The first four player characters were Marines and National Guard who received a message that there were still survivors holed in Disney World.\n\nChoppered into the Magic Kingdom, their transport was immediately brought down as a Smoker wrapped his tongue around the pilot, causing him to jerk forward and crash into the pool of one of the resorts.\n\nAfter checking for injuries, the team gathered around the chopper's heavy machine gun, because the sudden impact summoned the horde. For ten minutes they gunned down the infected,\n\nWhen the threat had passed, the team's scout noticed a flag flying from an upper window of the resort. But to get to that upper room, they needed to clear a path up through the horde. And this is where things got interesting.\n\nA weapon jam caused one PC, nicknamed \"Panda\" to have to improvise. She threw the jammed rifle over the heads of the zombies, and used her pistol to turn on the sprinklers. Taking a electrical cord plugged into a generator, she shocked the infected. Once they were done, she used a golf club that was lying around to move the cord from the water. Leaping from body to body across the pool, she recollected her rifle and reloaded.\n\nAs they made their way up the stairs, they had their first encounter with a TANK! The massive monstrous infected was rushing at them. Using one of the few grenades they were able to salvage from the crash, the team's engineer \"Sparks\" blew up the floor where the Tank was rushing, causing it to fall down into the basement.\n\nThis gave the team enough of a chance to make it upstairs to the presidential suite.\n\nHere, they met Princess Sooraya, from a middle eastern nation. Her entourage had been killed, and she wanted to help as many people as possible. So she joined the party, arming herself with a pair of butcher knives.\n\nThere was nobody else left alive in the hotel, so they progressed deeper into the park system, starting with the waterparks. In the parking lot, they found the perfect vehicle for transport between the parks. At 15 feet high, with a diesel engine and seats for fifty, the duckboat, on loan from Boston, became their mobile base of operations.\n\nThe first surviving NPC was located at the top of Blizzard Beach. In order to prevent the infected from reaching her, this woman had soaked the steps in soap, making it treacherous for the team to ascend. \n\nSooraya rolled well enough on diplomacy to convince this person that they were not a threat, and swore upon her kingdom that she would get this woman out alive.\n\nWith the rest of the squad taking up sniping positions on the long staircase, Sooraya and Ms Kingford took a giant inner tube down the slide. As they did this, Sparks shot a security alarm fifty feet to the north of the slide to draw the infected's attention. Between the distraction and the sniping, Sooraya and Ms Kingford arrived safely at what the team had taken to calling \"The Mighty Duck.\"\n\nSoon, the rest of the team made their way down, but unfortunately, they had an encounter with a Spitter. \"Panda\" took an acid blast to the leg, and used herself as bait, staggering in to the lazy river ride. Balancing her gun on the inner tube. she rolled down the river, shooting the infected until she ran out of bullets. Her last words over the radio were \"Don't lose anyone else!\"\n\nWith the one survivor from the waterpark rescued, the Mighty Duck roared to life, driving down to the next destination. The Wide World of Sports\n\nStay Tuned for Dead Kingdom Part 2, where you'll hear the tale of Sparks' ingenuity, the undead buzz lightyear, and the living zombie trap.",

        "text": "So tonight I just returned from a D&amp;D session which was profitable beyond almost all comprehension.\n\nSome quick backstory; this session, a few friends and I were running our weekly D&amp;D game at a friend's house. It started to get \"late\" so everyone else had left, except for me and a friend I will refer to as \"J\".\n\nWe figured we were about to leave as we didn't want to keep playing the adventure we had been doing without everyone else, and neither did we want to impose ourself on our DM's hospitality for too much longer. So, we decided to run some random encounters.\n\nThis was the right decision.\n\nSo, we roll up a random monster off of the list our DM had compiled and get something called a \"soul trader demon\" or something pretty close to that. J and I don't think too much about it, we basically consider it as some free loot and XP. J is playing as a 2nd level psionic, and I as a 7th level fighter, yes I am aware of the obscene level gap, so was he. We wanted to level him up and I was pretty much just there to provide much needed tanking and healing. So, we roll initiative. I go first, J goes second, and the demon goes last. I decide that since this demon is apparently pretty weak I could one-shot it and I figure I'd let J get some of the experience. So I just parry.\n\nThis was the right decision.\n\nJ uses his turn to fling a rock at the demon with his mind-brain, hitting it for a shocking... 4 damage. The demon is fine, and about to retaliate, targeting me. I say something about how I'll be totally pissed if this thing steals my soul, and the DM replies, \"no, it doesn't steal souls, it'll just trade you a wish for your soul.\" I jokingly say something about \"what if you wished for infinite souls?\" and J and the DM both laugh.\n\nSuddenly, silence at the table.\n\nEverybody gets serious. J and I look at each other and what follows is one of the most hilarious RPing situations I've ever had at the table. The demon has a strong stereotypical New Yorker accent, (Ayy! I'm walkin' eeeere!), has slicked back hair and a cheap suit. J and the demon proceed to negotiate a deal which can be summed up as \"infinite souls for infinite wishes\". The demon turns out to be working for some organization named \"Moriarty &amp; Co.\" as we learned from the contracts that the Demon keeps creating out of thin air. The demon is literally giddy with how many souls this deal will provide him with and the DM says something about how this guy is going to rise in the ranks QUICKLY. So, we made a few wishes immediately, we shrank an artifact and put in my armor so now I can shoot frost beams out of my chest like Iron Man, but that's kind of beside the point.\n\nSo, anyway, I'm not retarded, neither is J or our DM, we all know that eventually this is probably going to come back and bite us in the ass harder than an angry Terrasque, but hey, totally worth it. I guess I just wanted to share this because:\n\na.) I thought it was funny and\n\nb.) How do you guys think this is going to play out?",

A parade of wild elephants could run past her character, and she'd never notice it.\n\nI needed some flavor text for these failures, better than \"Oh, your shoe is untied.\" so the next time she was trying to roll to spot something and failed, I told her \"Off in the distance, you see a Gyro Stand.\"\n\nIn most campaigns, a street vendor selling assorted roasted meats wasn't too far in left field, so it became a running joke.\n\nDidn't notice the trap on the door? You were distracted by the smell from a Gyro Stand. Didn't see that giant eagle swooping down on your squad? You wanted some Gyros. Didn't notice the magic sigil you were about to step into? You saw an ad for a new gyro stand.\n\nThe joke carried on through ten campaigns, including oneshots. At one point, we were trying a Power Rangers style campaign, and I decreed that the team mentor had built his secret base under a Gyro Stand so she couldn't miss it.\n\nThat was the day I learned how to dodge d20s thrown at my head.",

        "text": "In our current cyberpunk campaign, my medtech, Doc Needles, found love in another pc, an ice cold solo named Permafrost. It started innocently enough, both of them having once served in the United States military, so they had a kindred soul. We both knew that we were breaking a runner no no, but hell, both of us kind of saw the match up coming, and we joked about how their first date was at a firing range... or how their second was at a karate tournament. But... when we ran, we did everything right, the relationship never followed us on our jobs. We had uncovered a large conspiracy where most of the world was controlled by the illuminati and the Templars...\n\nOur DM likes to run sideruns, as it helps build up stories and character arcs. He'll rank them on the difficulty, from very easy to impossible... in one side run however... Permafrost met her end.\n\nPermafrost and Archangel (another solo) opened up our terminal to check for runs when they saw a milk run for 100,000 eurobucks. They got excited and clicked it, being told that there was a guy in hengsha who needed their help getting to the airport.... so they accept. They get prepped, leaving behind her heavy lmg and her armor, just brought her smg. Arch did the same thing, and loaded up the osprey to head out from Night City. They land and start walking after an uneventful flight, seeing how nasty it was when suddenly a hobo pulls a heavy shotgun out and shot archangel. He goes down a moment then activated his corvette legs and used them to tackle a shopkeeper who turned out to be an illuminati agent. Permafrost ends up, in the crosshairs of 5 agents. She was gunned down, as archangel threw the other agent out.\n\nPermafrost warned archangel through military sign language that there five combatants outside, and to just run... but of course he didn't listen, and almost walked into a withering hell of fire. So... because she had met Doc, and saw through him that sometimes the right way to handle something, left you in a painful situation, and thus, she stood, and threw a rock at archangel. The agents turned and just filled her full of lead, then and there.\n\nArchangel broke into a run, escaping through the back of the store and escaped... to tell doc what happened. Doc, the crew, and one of our security teams loaded up to go get her body back... a long assault in a hidden base near hengsha ensued and surprisingly, we only lost one man im our fight and gained a new pc... but...\n\nDoc made his way down to a medbay as he heard from some of the civvies on base that they brought her there, hooking her body up to get information from what was left over of her. A small fight ensued and the room was cleared of the mobs, doc walking up to the tank her body was in and put his hand against the glass, looking in on her. She was gone, but they were pumping enough stimulants into her brain to keep her awake and drawing out her death. Doc found her... he brought a way to bring her peace. He turned the life support off, cracked the tank open, and held her in his arms one last time as he took a bottle out, filled with acid. He poured it on her, and... Permafrost was gone, nothing but a lock of hair, and a stain on the floor.\n\nNow doc sits in his office, smoking a cigarette, and swirling a glass of brandy... alone once again.",

        "text": "For a halloween party, we were playing in a one-shot campaign where the players were trying to solve a Scooby Doo mystery at the haunted, abandoned amusement park.\n\nI was playing the team's crack inventor, and was roaming the park with another player character. I was looking for things I could use against the ghosts, she was looking for food.\n\nAs I searched around, I found a piece of an old toboggan ride, a tank of helium, some industrial grade soap, and a luggage cart. All of these were saved for later.\n\nMy partner in crime was getting hungry, and didn't seem to understand the idea that food that's been lying around for six months or more is probably not healthy.\n\nAfter some botched rolls to find food in this mess, she finally found some pudding, like a knockoff of flan, just lying in a disused fridge. For some reason, she kept it.\n\nI had climbed up the safety stairs to the old roller coaster with my gear and started constructing a Jumanji trap. At this point, the \"Ghost\" appeared. I called down to my friend, who grabbed the first thing she could find to throw at the ghost. The pudding.\n\nWe were rolling D6s with 5-6 being success, 1-2 being extreme failure, and 3-4 being failure. In order to throw the pudding, she would need to roll three sixes in a row.\n\nShe gets the first six, and the second, but her third roll is a 1. The GM decides that she hurls the pudding, it arcs through the air and goes splat on the ground. But it doesn't stop there. Maybe there was some extra additive in the pudding, because once it hit the ground, it bounced, higher than the first time. It bounced again and arced over the head of the ghost.\n\nThe ghost just stares as this past-expiration flan bounces off into the distance, distracting it from seeing me spring the trap. I slam down the handle on the gas tank, sending the toboggan racing up the lift hill towards the ghost.\n\nHowever, it turned out the ghost was a hologram made by a mad genius. My improvised missile flew through the ghost, off the roller coaster and into the parking lot, smashing through the windshield of the car we came in.\n\nThrough a series of bad rolls, we eventually caught the Old Man Jenkins behind it all, and he revealed that he wasn't haunting the place, he was testing his new holograms with the intent to reopen the park and rebrand it. But we meddling kids with our rocket sleds and demon pudding had thrown that plan off.",

        "text": "[A brief tale from my campaign!](http://redd.it/2y5vbe)\n\nNow, this one's a bit different in terms of subject. We're here to talk lore. More specifically, Lorek.\n\nSee, in my campaign world, about 700 years ago was this woman named [Lorek](http://fav.me/d77sbl6). She was, to put it bluntly, a Mary Sue in a world wholly unprepared for such things. She was the person who got Nat 20s on all stats during character creation, and decided that instead of playing one class, she'd like to play all of them. She broke the \"game\" in so many ways that she even got a cult following, sired her own nation, and started the world's most elite group of mercenaries. She was the stabbiest stabber, the magiciest magicer, the buildiest builder, and generally anything could possibly be construed as awesome, she specialized in.\n\nShe was so damn GOOD at everything that the only problems she ever really found interesting were ones that concerned the entire planet's state of being. Invasion from hostile dimensions, ancient doomsday cults, and other such things. When she murdered them out of existence, she got bored. And then she looked at the world, which was pretty much hers, and decided that there was some cleaning up to do.\n\nSee, there were these things lurking around. Horrible, nasty, uptight things called angels. So she killed them all. Then she found the demons and devils. She murdered the fuck out of them, too. And then, she found the vampires. The gods-damned, always-so-fucking-smug overblown overpowered and overDONE vampires. She exterminated them. She took all of the stupid, one-dimensional forces of good/evil/smugness and stabbed them and magiced them and shat on their steaming corpses. Fuck angels, fuck demons, and FUUUUUCK vampires.\n\nThat was a long time ago, though, and Lorek is by now very, very dead. Gone the way of the subjects of her crusade, you might say. But what the hell does this have to do with the story at hand? Well, see, Lorek was thorough in a lot of ways, and there exists no living angel, demon or vampire. And there never will, because Lorek would probably cannon out of her grave and punch it in the dick. Probably. If she managed to break out of the seventeen tons of solid steel they placed over her tomb, just in case. Anyway, all those shit-eaters are gone, but the damn things still have a sort of legacy. Rumors have it that children are starting to show up with horns, cloven feet, or a faint white glow. Yes, the bloodlines of the angels and demons still technically exist, lingering in the general populace, and so tieflings and aasimar may one day take the fore. But what of the vampires? What of the dhampir?\n\nThat's the kicker. Dhampir cannot reproduce. The dhampirs, though long-lived, were also a doomed race. They were also, naturally, heavily distrusted due to their tendency to bite people and generally be awful. Still, some tried, and they lived on. And on. And on. And so we come to the end of the dhampir, 700 years after the last vampire was killed. The last dhampir alive, despairing of old age, and a legacy that would not even be a footnote in the grand scheme of things. This dhampir was just a DJ. A music-mixer. And he was old, and he was dying, and he was the last.\n\nWell fuck that. The dhampir might not have had the best reputation, or demeanor, or anything really, but damn it, they were still people. They mattered. The world couldn't just forget. And so the last dhampir started researching things. Magic. Bloodlines. Necromancy.\n\nHe found a way to bring the dhampir back. The key to being a dhampir was the bloodlust, that hunger for the heartbeat. The last dhampir had mastered it by moving his hunger into one for music- pulsing, living music. And that same pulsing, living music- The Beat- was the key to everything. It called to people, not just the dhampir, and made them move to its rhythm. The dhampir researched more and more, and he found what he was looking for... the perfect race to embrace the hunger for The Beat. The nagas. The snake-people who were a bit narcissistic, and whose entire society was built on songs.\n\nThe ritual was, strictly speaking, not all that complex. The Beat called out to the souls of dead nagas, and he could use them as a catalyst to affect a live one- to put the hunger for The Beat in its soul. But the last dhampir wasn't going to settle for one- he was going to throw one HELL of a going-away party. He gathered all the necromantic energy he could, summoned numerous restless spirits with the lure of The Beat, and set about his last act as the last dhampir- instilling that hunger, that need for The Beat into the souls of all the nagas he could.\n\nAnd then the adventurers showed up, killed his zombies, shanked him in the knees and set fire to his turntables.\n\nSo ended the last dhampir. Except that he wasn't quite the last, was he? He had to test his ritual on something, and he had made a proof-of-concept, as it were. A small naga child with grey skin was discovered behind the last dhampir's stage. The adventurers, not knowing what else to do, took it in. They talked and bickered and eventually settled on a name- Parmeet Edgardo Belsha. Or \"Peb\". Seeing as he was just a small child and they were not really up to the task of babysitting, they shoved the child into the arms of some drow they knew, figuring that it would probably work out.\n\nI wonder what fate has in store for the new last dhampir.",

        "text": "So, some background for this story is that for 2 players this was there first game of DnD and so they brought that special form of fun that a new person can bring.\n\nRathkantos- Me, Dragonborn cleric to Bahamut\n\nThrask- Half-Ork barbarian that collects jaw bones\n\nVlag- Fighter with a very heavy Scottish accent \n\nGree- Ranger who was a very shelter noble and the center of this story\n\nKaliva The Magnificent- Wizard, and that is actually his legal name\n\nSo we were on our way to kill some goblins, nothing really special but you know, first level missions. When we set up camp that night Gree decided that she really wanted some honey. At this point everyone else had set up camp but this noble was really determined to get some honey. After rolling relatively high on a nature check to find the bees and was rolling another one to remember how best to get the honey. She rolled a 3, and well naturally she knew that without a doubt the best way to get the honey out of the hive was to run screaming at the hive and jumping on it. The bees promptly got pissed off as their hive was crushed underneath a ranger.\n\nThe rest of the party were bedding down and then we heard the screams. We all just looked at each other and sighed. As we strolled to where the screams were coming from, back on Gree's side she is down to five hp when we get into the clearing. At this point I just keep walking forward and pull her away from the hive, however she still has a death-grip on it and just will not let go. So I do what any rational person would do at this point, I freeze the bees. I was playing a silver dragonborn which means that my breath weapon was a cone of cold. After that the bees were a beautiful ice sculpture and Gree was at one hp. After healing her and going back to camp we slept and left the next day.\n\nOn the return trip back to where we started we passed the clearing that the bees were frozen in. There were three pale blue beehives there, which I can only imagine that at some point in this campaign there is going to be a plague or something caused by the offspring of the bees I froze.\n\nThat's it for this, we are about four sessions into the campaign, but I can already tell it is going to be a good one. Next time we go over what happened when you make a giant love you.      ",

These wonderful companions are feeling just a little bit down because one of their close friends decided to head off home for story reasons, but that melancholy was offset by the fact that they'd gotten some spectacularly powerful artifacts out of the deal and there was still adventuring to do.\n\nSpeaking of which, the organization that the party works for has (gasp) more work! Apparently something nefarious is going on nearby, with a bunch of undead doing weird stuff and could you all pretty please go and stab them a lot? Assisting in the endeavor is Partyboss, the party's direct superior, a naga bard who was apparently on the verge of going stir-crazy and insisted on actually doing something interesting instead of pushing papers around and cleaning up after the messes of adventurers. It's far more fun to MAKE the messes.\n\nAnyway, the whole scooby gang piled onto a cart and set off in high spirits (except for Rose, who had been abused by skeletons and most definitely was NOT in favor of entering a creepy dungeon filled with them). They eventually arrived at [a thumping, pounding dungeon filled with all manner of rhythmic monsters](http://megagames.com/sites/default/files/game-images/CRYPTOTN.png). They were stopped at the doors by a couple of bouncers, but the party showed them their VIP passes (swords) and clambered in over the mangled remains.\n\n[The inside of the dungeon was a really thumpin' place, with laser lights, catchy music, flashing floors, and dancing zombies all over (who weren't hostile, oddly). There was also the issue of the pervasive rhythm of the place- turns switched after every action, forcing the party to move with the beat.](http://youtu.be/UrS1RyuoG0I?t=8m45s) The party advanced on what seemed like the ringleader- a powerful undead warrior demanding a \"Single dance\". It was clear how this was going to go- one of the tankier characters, like Rose with her sweet-ass spear or Pratena with her gallingly strong fists would-\n\nBarrel stepped into the ring and a forcewall snapped up. It was ON. The warrior advanced on Barrel, wielding his massive greatsword-\n\nBarrel smashed a potion of darkness, threw a bottle of alchemist's fire into the warrior's face, and chugged a potion of Sanctuary. The warrior could not see Barrel, was always taking fire damage, and kept failing the will save to actually attack him. Barrel danced around him, sticking kukris in every important-looking bit until the warrior disintegrated with a hearty laugh. Well played.\n\nThe party explored a bit more, finding weird private dance booths filled with undead nagas who paid them no attention. Odd. After that, they came to a crossroads that was the subject of a Lame Keycard Puzzle^TM and discovered they had to take down the two minibosses.\n\nThe first miniboss was a necromancer with his own skeletal conga. Rose recognized him from her traumatic past, [immediately panicking and leaping into Pratena's arms](http://www.cartoonnetwork.co.uk/sites/www.cartoonnetwork.co.uk/files/thegang_large.jpg) while everyone else set about demolishing the arrow-shooting conga line. Thoth used a force punch to knock them over like dominos while Partyboss hucked knives at them and Barrel revealed that he was sired by a blender. Rose was carefully put down, and Pratena bunched up for a charge against the necromancer...\n\nHe was just casting his last buff when Pratena hit him like a freight train and tore off an important-looking limb. He responded with a banshee scream, and Pratena removed that extremity, too. One down!\n\nThe next miniboss was hiding in a crammed mosh pit of skeletal warriors, who looked like they were going to be trouble. The party caught glimpses of something moving between the thrashing bones, and-\n\nSlammed the door, built an enormous powder keg out of their stockpiled alchemist's fire, and had Rose huck it through the door, quickly sealing it afterwards. The boss turned out to be a Bone Collective, who took extra damage from both area-of-effect attacks and fire damage. And it was really quite a small room...\n\nThe party retrieved the key from the smoking remains (after stabbing it a few times, because it had barely survived and gave Pratena a nasty bite) and entered the OMINOUS DOUBLE DOORS OF SUPREME FOREBODING. Inside they found the NEFARIOUS DJ, who was directing the whole shebang, and his eight undead naga cronies. Did I not mention those? Because he had eight undead naga cronies. And they were pissed about the rude arrival of the party-crashers.\n\nThe fight was a bit confusing, as all of the nagas were under the effect of Blink, which made them tricky as hell to hit. Additionally, the pulsing DJ lights gave people a lot of buffs, like Invisibility, Haste, Enlarge Person, and Rage. Pratena played defensively, Rose got Hold Person'd, Partyboss was magically compelled to dance (she was still singing her bardsong, though), Barrel sneaked around to shank the DJ's ankles, and Thoth made himself the MVP by being curiously invincible. Lightning bolts were thrown, spears were inserted into giblits, fists met chins hard enough to remove them from the face, and a great buff/debuff war raged. At about that time, Thoth threw a lightning bolt into the disco ball (of the Magic-Refracting Diamond persuasion) and the undead nagas were blasted out of the material plane.\n\nThat was sorted, then! Except that the figures of the nagas were still visible (but ethereal), and were gathering in the middle of some sort of magic bullshit circle, and were twisting into something resembling a hydROH SHIT BARREL HIT THE OFF SWITCH!\n\nWith the music stopped, the party could move normally, and the zombiehydra's first turn was also its last. Weapons flew into it from every direction, and it exploded in a ball of failure and the DM's tears.\n\nThat done, they accosted the DJ... who turned out to be, of all things, a Dhampir. Specifically, the last Dhampir, because vampires were exterminated long ago by an ancient hero. This little shindig was part of a ritual to preserve the Dhampir line by infecting a bunch of nagas with the blah blah exposition blah Barrel stabbed him.\n\nDungeon cleared, the party looted everything in sight (making a point of grabbing that giant magic-refracting diamond, THE POSSIBILITIES) coming up with a bunch of weapons, gold, loot, occultish stuff, and an infant naga with grey skin- oh. Looks like there's a new last Dhampir. Well, whatever! Time to go home!\n\nThe mood was spoiled when they rolled over a hidden shock mine on the road back, and Barrel remembered that someone was still out there, looking to murder him. What a buzzkill.\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"It's totally not product placement\", THE OVERHEAD RAILROAD AND I'M PRETTY SURE CRASHING IT INTO THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA VOIDS THE WARRANTY!](http://redd.it/2yhmob)",

        "text": "\"Sit down young ones and let me tell you a story. This tale begins long ago, in a land ravaged by Orcs, Goblins and other foul-smelling creatures with less-then-symmetrical faces. Villages were raided daily, the roads were unsafe and the wilderness was filled with small bands of these tusked monsters who sought nothing more than to ravage and destroy. The people prayed for salvation, for someone to put an end to this age of despair, but it seemed their prayers went unanswered as a rumor began to spread. A rumor that someone, or something, was gathering the Orc and Goblin tribes into an army. Without a leader they fought against each other almost as often as they fought us, but if someone could successfully control them it would certainly be the end of the world as we knew it. One day, as all hope seemed lost, a group of heroes arrived to the lands. A brave and honest Human Paladin and his strong as steel brother, a mighty Fighter. With them was the Half-Elf Bard, who would later go on to tell their tales for all to hear. And lastly, our main character in this story, Neko the Half-Elf Wizard. Neko was a special young lad, equally smart and anti-social. He had an underlying distrust for everyone he met, and expressed this by talking so little one was to assume he was a mute. In all reality he was as sharp as an Elven blade forged by the Divines themselves, he just rarely got to show it. His party traveled the lands, ridding them of fiends one kingdom at a time, and they were regarded as heroes wherever they went. \"The Protectors\" people called them. The holy Paladin, questing for the Gods. The mighty Fighter, slaying great enemies. The brave Bard, encouraging her team and documenting their heroic deeds. And the Wizard, who got little notoriety in neither the Bard's tales nor among the people.\n\nOne day our team of heroes were scourging an ancient Elven tomb of Goblins that had come to call the place home, and were using the temple to lead raids on nearby towns in the dead of night. The people were worried the Goblins would be the end of them, but were far more worried they'd unlock the central tomb and gain access to whatever powerful artifacts were left there by the Elves of Old. The tomb's entrance had long since caved in and been covered in a landslide, so the only entrance was now a natural cave formation that led directly into one of the lower levels. This is where our heroes entered. The caves were part of an underground river and as such the terrain was treacherous. Cliffs leading over a hundred feet into dark water. Small, slim bridges of natural stone over dark ravines that could crumble at any moment. Rooms fill to the neck with murky water, with unspeakable beasts swimming around your feet. The Paladin crushed horrible monsters and Goblins alike with his warhammer, saying prayers and blessing the caves as they went along. The Fighter charged into Goblin hordes, swinging his great axe and throwing dozens into the darkness below at a time. The Bard kept playing her lute, never once breaking melody despite Goblin crossbow bolts and unknown creatures brushing against her legs below the black water. Neko held back. He could neither fight nor play a lute. He was a young lad, and had yet to acquire a large spellbook. He threw some Magic Missiles here, cast Daze on a Goblin there, but in the end it was his teammates that did most of the fighting. After an hour underground our heroes began to notice the first signs of fatigue. The Paladin and Fighter were barely standing in their heavy armor, scratched and damaged by teeth and sword alike. The Bard had suffered some nasty wounds and was drifting in and out of consciousness as she began to suffer from blood loss. It was at this moment a Goblin attempted to sneak up behind her and end her once and for all. Neither the Paladin nor the Fighter saw the nasty creature, sneaking through the darkness with his crude bone dagger, but Neko did, and without hesitation jumped into action. Stunned by the sudden appearence of a young boy in blue robes, the Goblin could only watch as Neko thrust his Goldenbrough wand into its eye socket, killing it swiftly. Neko, in a fit of adrenaline, picked up the Goblin's crossbow from his corpse and ran into the next cave, succeeding in shooting down three more Goblins before they could react, and bludgeoning a forth to death with the now empty crossbow. The last three Goblins ran off into the darkness, Neko following quickly behind and the rest of our heroes crawling slowly after.\n\nThe next cave was a massive natural formation, around a hundred feet from one end to the other. A domed roof possibly fifty feet tall loomed above in the darkness, while a ravine split the entire cave in two. The ravine led down into darkness and one could hear what sounded to be thrashing in murky water below, as if a dozen creatures loomed in the dark subterranean lake, eagerly waiting for someone to fall in. Neko and our heroes entered the cave just in time to see the last Goblin reaching the other side of the thirty foot wide ravine and slicing the vine rope they'd used to cross. On the other side stood two dozen Goblins smirking in the dim light cast by their campfire, and in the middle stood a large Goblins chieftan wearing what seemed to be ancient Elven armor and a crown made of skulls. Behind the group of Goblins a large marble door stood, half opened. The Goblins had found the tomb and had already begun their search for the artifacts. Neko was already in a state of rage and excitement. For once he was the hero. For once there would be a tale about him and his deeds, and he'd no longer have to linger in his friend's shadow! There was no doubt in his mind that this was the defining moment in his tale. This is what would forever be his legacy. With a quick look towards his friends and small smirk of equal amounts excitement and proudness, he ran to the edge of the ravine and jumped. The Goblins stood in awe as the small, blond kid with an over-sized blue robe jumped into the air towards them and our heroes looked on in horror as Neko left the ground across the ravine. Within a split second it was obvious he wouldn't make it. Neko's grin turned into a look of fear and regret as he smashed into the ravine wall on the other side and fell tumbling into the darkness below. The only sound in the cave was the sounds of a small body smashing against rocks on its way down, followed by a massive splash. A few seconds of silence passed before the Goblins burst out in uncontrollable laughter. The Paladin wiped tears from his eyes as he raised his now glowing warhammer, before roasting half of the Goblins with divine lightning. The Fighter drew his throwing axes, skillfully embedding them in Goblinoid skulls across the ravine, when he ran out of throwing axes he threw his war axe, effectively cleaving the head off of the Goblin chieftain. And the Bard played her lute, a song of sadness, but also of honor and strength. Within seconds the Goblins were dead and our heroes had succeeded on their quest. And Neko went down in history as a foolish lad who never bothered to learn Feather Fall.\"\n\n~ Archmage Gallanoir in response to a cheeky pupil who didn't see the point of learning such a dumb spell as Feather Fall.",

        "text": "Two of my friends and I are part of a small group that is currently playing the DnD board game, with plans to move on to 3.5 in a little while. While Redditing I found a link to a pdf of the Og: Unearthed edition manual, and suggested that we play it during our 3 hour gap between lectures last Friday. My friends agreed and I told them to design some characters.\n\nNow for those who don't know, Og is a very basic game, the manual is about 20 pages long. Basically it's a very simple RPG with the players being cavemen in a world with dinosaurs, ancient aliens and lizard people. The most defining feature of the game however, is that players can only communicate with eachother in character, and cave people are stupid, and therefore only know up to 6 words from a preapproved list. Therefore sentences such as \"Thing! Go go bang thing bang\" (translation: There's something over there, we should go and kill it) are fairly commonly used. Now, on to the story:\n\nOur two cavemen, let's call them A and B as they never had names, woke up one day and decided to do some hunting, so they ventured out onto the great plains. The first thing that they encountered was a giant (10 foot long) armadillo. Several minutes were wasted with them uselessly banging it with stones while it simply curled up into a giant ball and rolled away. Not easily put off, the cave men explored further away from the home caves, and found a river. On the shore was a giant beaver. After a long fight they eventually managed to beat it down and cave it's skull in. But then came the trouble of getting it home. The two of them were able to carry it most of the way home before they encountered trouble.\n\n A saw something on the path ahead and tried to tell B what it was, I believe the exact words were \"Thing! Thing!\" With a lot of pointing and gestures that were meant to look like claws. It was a velociraptor. B, thinking his friend was talking about food, ran forwards, not having seen what it was. Quicker than you can saw \"clever girl\" two more appeared from the bushes on either side of the path. A decided to grab the beaver and run the other way, leaving B to his fate. Luckily for B, one of the raptors  bit a tree and the other were too busy watching it to hurt B more than a few bites to his legs. The two cave men eventually got home and feasted on beaver meat.\n\nThe next day they were awoken by the sound of their mothers yelling at them to go out and find mates. A sighed and started the long trek to another tribe to try and get a woman. B, on the other hand, decided he had had enough nagging, and tried to kill his mother. He started pummelling her with fists and stones, but she was a shaman and summoned a giant eagle to pick him up and toss him out of the cave. B landed in a giant spiders web right next to where A was walking. I was generous and made it easy for A to help his friend escape before the spider reached him (they couldn't have even hurt it). What's the first thing B does upon being rescued? He goes home and finishes his mother off, tossing her bloody corpse off a cliff. What he did next surprised even me, he snuck up behind A's mother and killed her as well.\n\nSatisfied with his work, B found A and they went on to find the other tribe. Upon getting there, A began negotiations with the tribes chief to take his daughter. Eventually it was decided that he could take her if he killed a \"hairy bang thing\" (sabertooth tiger) living in a nearby valley. Meanwhile, B was exploring the cave and found the chiefs daughter having some fun with a male member of the tribe. What does our matricidal maniac do? He tries to kill the man and take the woman...he got beaten up, knocked out and thrown in a mall side cave.\n\nA found the valley, found the tiger, was chased off by the tiger and returned to the tribe. Once there he was able to negotiate a new deal, if he provided the tribe with food his friend would be released so they could hunt together. So, A went to the river, gathered a load of berries, killed a giant leach and returned once again. The chief was happy with the berries, but didn't want the leach, so A and B took it with them. The two of them were still unable to kill the tiger, so they came up with a cunning plan. They went back to the tribe, claiming to have 'banged thing' (and yes, there were a lot of k=jokes about whether or not banging meant fucking as well). They were able to convince the chief that they were telling the truth (through some very lucky roles), and went home with the chiefs daughter in tow as B's new mate. B had some crafting skill, and turned the dead leach into a hat, and made himself a crude stone axe to prepare for the next day.\n\nUpon waking they decided to venture to the plains North of their mountain home. Once there they were greeted by a tribe of tall, pale skinned, almost hairless people (homo sapiens), who were armed with much more advanced stone tools. A tried to steal one of their spears,, fell over stabbing his own leg, and was kicked a few times, but luckily they were merciful and left it at that...B just watched, wearing his ridiculous hat. But the day wasn't a waste and they killed a wild boar, meaning the tribe wouldn't starve for a few more days.\n\nOn the final day of the adventure they decided to investigate a strange cave to the south, a very square cave made of stone bricks. Before they could enter a lizard man came out and pointed a gun at them. B ran away as fast as he could, while A tried to 'communicate'...neither of them understood a word the other said and he got shot in the leg.\n\nAt that point we ad to end the adventure as it was time for another lecture...I still say we should have skipped it, Microbial Diversity is as boring as shit.\n\nedit: Had A and B mixed up a few times, all sorted",

        "text": "*For those unfamiliar with Town of Salem: it's a Mafia-style browser game where everyone is randomly assigned one of a number of roles with specific abilities. The important roles for this one are:*\n\n**Godfather**: Chooses a person to kill each night - Wins if all Town and Neutral Evil roles die\n\n**Survivor**: Can put on a bulletproof vest at night to not be killed by the Godfather (for some reason you only get 4 vests, even if you're not attacked) - Wins if they're alive and anyone else wins\n\n**Werewolf**: Can rampage, killing people every two nights - wins if all Town, Mafia and other Neutral Evil roles are dead (so they win with Survivor)\n\n**Amnesiac**: Once per game, can change their role to the role of any character in the graveyard.\n\n*Every day you have the choice of lynching someone you believe to be guilty and every night, everyone can use their night abilities if they have them.*\n\nSo I was an Amnesiac. Night 1, the mafia killed a Survivor and the next day I declared I was an Amnesiac who was going to pick Survivor. I did, and next day it was announced to the players that an Amnesiac had become a Survivor. I was 100% confirmed in my role. No one had a reason to kill me.\n\nSkip forward to the end of the game. I get paranoid and even though I know no one has a reason to kill me, I wear a vest at night. It pays off. Someone tried to kill me. Since the Werewolf's rampage nullifies the Survivor's vest, I know the Mafia tried to kill me.\n\nNext morning, only four of us alive. One was also claiming Survivor, one had been previously accused of being a Werewolf. Another was unknown. I deduced this person was the remaining member of the mafia - my attacker. I launched into a tirade of \"What the f@ckity f@ck did you f@cking think you were f@cking doing\" since attacking a Survivor is a huge misplay that would have made me lose the game if I hadn't worn my vest.\n\nSo in this situation (2 survivors + 1 werewolf + 1 mafia) it's up to the survivors to decide who wins by siding with one side and lynching the other.\n\nI sided with the werewolf. HE'D never attacked me!",

        "text": "I recently started DMing for a group of friends. We had absolutely no clue what we were doing, since only me and one of my other friends had any sort of prior experience with DnD, and I had only played 3.5e while we are using 4.0e. Anyways, we decided to make our campaign set on an island with two kingdoms dividing it: the kingdom of the elves, and the kingdom of the dwarves. It is important to understand that everyone in the group wants to be different and have fun, not really be hard-core or anything. So what do my lovely players do? the roll up the most atypical characters they can, or they roll up stereotypes. We end with this party of five:\n7 foot tall, 250 pound goliath barbarian\n5 foot 7 inches, 130 pound female elf wizard (only female in the party, and played by a male)\n5 foot 9 inches, 175 pound shapeshifter cleric of the death god (the others don't know this yet)\n5 foot 1 inch 200 pound dwarf rogue who dislikes gender stereotypes\nand a 8 foot tall, 400 pound goliath bard who doesn't fight but instead insults his opponents to death.\nSo these guys are quite the ridiculous bunch, and we barely try to explain why they actually are working together, they just are. They are sent out by the dwarf king as ambassadors to go speak with the Elf king, since they are having political conflicts. Along the way they are ambushed by goblins. They quickly wipe the goblins, but the idiot barbarian goes into rage and attacks the trees around them (he thinks that because the goblins put traps in the trees, the trees were enemies too). He clear cuts a path through the forest until he nearly falls over a cliff. He manages to save himself, but his teammates see that he is about to fall over and try and help. They roll shit. 1, 2, 6. I decide they knock the strong barbarian over the cliff. After fighting more goblins, they are able to move on, leaving behind two goblins with heads blown up by insults, one goblin ice cube, a goblin sliced from balls to head, two piles of unidentifiable goo, and a goblin shaman with just his legs sticking out of the hole in the ground. \nNow they visit a town. They talk, they sell, they buy,...they hit on elves. That was all they did. The cleric and the rogue decided that sneaking around and trying to get laid was the best possible thing to do in a town of xenophobic elves. Needless to say, the rogue nearly got sliced up and the cleric literally took damage from public humiliation. They move on from the town, and find themselves traversing a forest on a quest to explore a mountain in the hopes of finding some explanation for why there were goblins in the forest (goblins are supposed to be extinct). Along the way, they hit another cliff, a huge cliff. They get together and decide to climb down. But first they have to knot their ropes together, then test the knots. This took them five minutes to do. Literally twenty die rolls later, two small trees had been ripped out of the ground and the ropes have giant knots on the them. Naturally the rogue goes first, his first climb check he rolls a 1 and falls. In desperation he grabs the rope and burns his hands all the way down to a ledge. The rest of the party gets down safely and finds that the ledge has a cave in it, and they decide to explore it. The cave is above another cave in which goblins are mining. They decide they are going to ambush the goblins. First things first, the idiot barbarian and his new love, the elf wizard jump down the hole, holding onto each other. They fall 30 feet and the barbarian lands on his face taking half his health in damage. The wizard on the other hand lands safely. Next up the rogue jumps down, while holding onto the rope. He fails again. He does have a lovely bounce though. Next up is the cleric, he climbs down successfully, like a smart person would. Finally it is the bards turn. This is where the title comes into play. I asked him for roll to see how easily he descends the rope. He rolls a nat 20. I think \"fuck it, lets have some fun\" I rule he descends in a halo of light like Jesus descending from the heavens. He lands gracefully on a goblin miner, smushing him flat. The next turn combat actually starts, and the wizard uses Sleep and crits the boss goblin. I know normally you don't allow for crits with magic, but that's how we're playing so you can go fuck a duck. Most of the goblins have passed out and are prone, so the barbarian gets up and charges the boss goblin. Coup de Grace. Free crit. 88 dmg. 700% the boss's hp. I decide the goblin explodes like a grenade. His bone shards acting like shrapnel, Coup de Graceing the sleeping goblins and damaging the others. So in less than a turn, 7 of the 12 goblins are dead, and the party has caused more damage to themselves than the goblins have, or ever will. By the end of that turn the bard had rolled another crit and caused a goblin head to explode from insult, and the cleric had managed to reap a soul for his god. The final goblin is surrounded, and rather than slaughter it, they decide to interrogate it. They roll a nat 20 for intimidate. The goblin shits so hard it blows its pants off. Everyone is covered in goblin shit, thankfully no one gets diseased (fort saves, checked for that). They talk to it a bit, then out of the blue, the bard declares that he is going to hug it so it'll feel better. I ask him to roll a grapple check, he rolls a nat 20. He crushes the goblin to death with his gigantic muscly goliath arms.\nThat's my story and there is more to come if you want it.",

        "text": "As the city stabilized in its flight, those living in the city began to come out of their guild houses, to see a plethora of bodies dangling in the center of town. Carolus wanders around, picking up what he can of the objects he has lifted, while his comrades sell what they've taken. As Remryn walks away from the counter, Carolus comes up to sell what he can; unfortunately it is worth near nothing. One of the items, however, is an enchanted garrote. At the sight of this, the small halfling merchant is appalled, and appalled even moreso at the attempts to intimidate him made by Carolus. He goes around the counter, and up to Carolus. \"I'd be happy to use this,\" Carolus was caught up in his bloodlust and racist hatred for midgets. \"I'd like to see you try,\" retorted the pious halfling. Unfortunately for him, the garrote is alive and needs to feed, so it beheaded him upon Carolus placing it upon the man. By this time, a large crowd has began to mob and riot against Carolus.\nSo what were our other intrepid adventurers up to? I'm glad you asked. Rupert was sent by Kaizar to get the guards to move the golden bathtub in his room. Why? Who wouldn't want to sell a golden bathtub? Continuing on, however, Dyraga snuck into the empty shop stall of one of the four sages, in hopes of finding amazing treasures. Ambros was awoken from his drunken stupor when Remryn tripped over him, and the two went on a journey to find weapons in the crafter's guild.\nMeanwhile, only one of the party members seemed to care about Carolus at all; Autono-Thomas. He rushed to his aid, joining in the fight against the large mob of nearly 30 people who are beating the living hell out of Carolus. And the guards? The guards were all busy taking down the bodies of the suicidal miners. And this is where things got interesting. Kaizar comes down to the marketplace to see what is taking Rupert so long, and endeavors to join the battle upon discovering it. Around this time, Dyraga comes out from behind the counter, with a box and a slip of paper. Upon the paper was a word in an unknown language, which he deciphered was the keyword to unlocking the magically locked box. At this point, there is no doubt quite the commotion going on, so Rupert begins to distract the guards. \"HOLY SHIT WHY IS THE CITY IN THE AIR\" \"Well, sir...\" \"NO CITIES BELONG ON THE GROUND WHAT THE HELL IS THIS YOU BASTARDS...\" and so on and so on.\nThe battle goes on for awhile, with mobbers being murdered in droves. The last is sliced into four pieces, by Carolus, who was flung with Thomas' chain. The scene cleared, and Rupert out of ideas for keeping the guards occupied, the guards now turn around and see what has happened. Thinking quickly, Dyraga steps forward and proclaims, \"I am a powerful wielder of magic, and I have taken control of your nobles. I will continue using them for my nefarious purposes, unless you can decipher this note for me.\"\nThe guards, understandably, doubt him. So, he conjures an illusion of a mighty demon, to which the guards roll a 1 against. They cower in terror, hurriedly finding someone to both translate Dyraga's paper, and to move the bathtub down to the crafter's guild, so that they may take it to a smithee and have it broken down. The guards assure Dyraga that they will not talk about the apparent eco-terrorist in their midst, and even clean up the whole scene, kicking bodies down the hole which was once a mine shaft.\nAnd within the box? A strange golden skull with sharp teeth and glowing red eyes, although Dyraga took more interest to the strange box.",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2xxbv1/wod_the_day_my_friend_tried_to_kill_jesus/",
        "text": "A couple years back, our friendly neighborhood DM was running a game of WoD set around the year 40 AD. The premise was that, after the death of Christ, the Four Horsemen of Apocalypse would descend upon the world and bring everything to it's end. We were told to roll regular human characters who would eventually find out that they were the living incarnations of War, Famine, Conquest and Death. And then proceed to fuck shit up, as the scriptures had foreseen. It was quite a character drama, considering every character was essentially a good person who wouldn't want to harm anyone, much less, you know, destroy the entire world.\n\nWe had been playing for a couple months and had already encountered a few supernatural creatures, who mostly treated us with respect, each of them knowing more than we did about what we were, but most of them were unaware that we were still little more than humans at the time, most of our powers still dormant (the DM would slowly give us supernatural abilities as the story progressed and we awakened to our nature).\n\nThings really started to get interesting when the party arrived at a port town ruled by a wealthy trader and his mistress, an exotic woman from overseas. The story was set in the Roman Empire, this town being located somewhere in the coast of Italy. The mistress was an African woman, whom we found out to be a powerful shaman who was behind the trader's fame and wealth. It turns out that she had been reanimating corpses to act as servants, laborers and raiders. The trader was friendly towards the party (he didn't know about our supernatural... eh, nature, but we had some powerful allies within the Roman Empire), however the Horseman of Death was quite offended by the thing with the undead servants and tried to intimidade the couple into dropping the habit of employing zombies. Naturally, it didn't work, and things got ugly. The mistress felt threatened and revealed that she had a hostage: the soul of the father of one of the PC's (who had worked with this trader before, and like many, was taken by the mistress after his death), and then demanded the party to leave the couple alone forever, least she would do horrible things to her hostage. Nobody was happy.\n\nNow this is the point where I have to take a small break from what happened within the game to talk about what was happening outside of it. Our friend from the title (the Horseman of War) had his share of petty disagreements with our DM, which ended up snowballing into a huge ball of \"I don't like you and I won't even deny it\". They had managed to be friends for a long time despite that, but things were starting to pile up and get ugly between them, and that started to reflect in the way our friend played his character. War was a huge pacifist at first, being one of the guys who had known and followed Christ while he was alive, and he had spend the 5~10 years that followed the death of Christ preaching and helping those in need. He was basically a nice guy who hated violence and thought God wanted everyone to have a good life so he went and did good to others in the name of God and Jesus. As the player got more and more angry with the DM outside of the table, however, War slowly turned into an irritable, easily offendable, religious fundamentalist who couldn't accept anything unchristian to exist (basically he invented the Westboro Baptist Church).\n\nBack in the game world, the party came up with a plan to sneak into the trader's manor while he and his mistress were asleep and \"deal\" with them. War was pretty much being \"that guy\" at that point but he agreed with the party this once solely because, hey, zombies are unchristian as fuck. We got a few lucky rolls and an hour later we were inside the couple's room. Luckily for us they were having sex at the time and were thus none the wiser to our approach. Unluckily for the trader, he didn't react well when we revealed ourselves, and he ended up dead. The woman kept calm and attempted to negotiate (if we killed her, all of the souls bound to her would be kept from resting in peace). We talked and she agreed to release all the souls she had bound to her service in exchange for her life (and our word the we'd not go after her after she left Rome). We were okay with that, knowing that the soul of Death's father would be free to pass on to the afterlife, but War, no, he couldn't accept that. Even if it meant saving a ton of souls and sending them to their rightful place in Heaven (or wherever), negotiating with a pagan witch was unchristian and we had to carry God's will and kill this devil worshiper, no matter the cost. The souls that would be lost with her belonged to God anyway, so it was okay to sacrifice them in his name. \n\nWe tried to explain to him OOC that the concept of paganism, witch hunts, devil worship and the whole Westboro way of life didn't really exist before the middle ages, but he wouldn't listen. We couldn't tell him that he was playing his character wrong, it was HIS character after all. He was angry outside the game and he WANTED to be angry inside the game as well. He was enjoying it. He chose to ignore us calling him out for being historically inacurate and had his character draw his sword on us IC. We didn't think it was that bad. He wanted to play a religious nut, cool, maybe that was the way his deeply Christian character was dealing with finding out about his fate and all the supernatural stuff we had seen and maybe he intended to have the character get over that issue in time, since, you know, character development. I played cool and disarmed him, then he punched me. I took it, didn't attack him back (my character was physically the strongest, but he was a quiet, reasonable and subservient due to his backstory). We tried to get him to calm down (IC) and he called us devil worshipers for suffering a witch to live, then he left. We finished our business (burned down the manor along with the zombie corpses and escorted the woman out of town) while our friend went back to town alone and told our allies that we could no longer be trusted, that we had gone rogue and made a deal with a witch. Thankfully, it was his word against our own, and our allies didn't really care about what he had to say.\n\nAfter that session we talked about the game and (playfully) congratulated him about how fucking annoying his character turned out to be. Since, you know, he was trying really hard to be a Westboro dick. He got defensive and explained he wasn't doing anything on purpose. He was playing his character straight. That's when we realized he wasn't just roleplaying, he was actually using that character to vent his frustration towards the DM. Discussions were had and we got to the consensus that his character was behaving like an idiot. Boy, was he pissed. He was pissed at the DM before, but little did we know that his frustration was about to be extended to all of us at the table. Little did we know that he would be angry enough to ruin the entire campaign for everybody. Little did we know that he would be angry enough to fight Jesus.\n\nFast forward a couple weeks (during which our characters tried to talk to his about what happened, but he would still refuse to listen) and we were back at the Roman Capital. We were invited to visit the Seasonal Market. This Market works sort of like [this](http://thereachmux.org/wiki/Changeling/The_Hedge/Market), minus the Goblins: a safe and neutral haven where every supernatural being (or mortal beings with enough influence and occult knowledge) can trade secrets, favors and magical items. It happened at a different place around the world every Season and this time, it was going to happen in Rome. Our Friend's character was no longer travelling or even talking to the party at this point, but the DM managed to steer him towards the Market as well. Of course, conflict is absolutely not tolerated within the market, even between sworn enemies or  creatures that would destroy each other on sight outside of the Market's walls (like Angels and Demons or Cainites and Werewolves). Each player explored the Market, met NPCs, bartered for treasure and made connections. One of us got laid. Everything went well.\n\nUntil our friend found Jesus.\n\nYou see, gods and demigods sometimes wandered the Market. Most of the time they were discreet or wore disguises and fake aliases, but let's not forget that our friend War had known Jesus before he was crucified, and thus he was able to recognize him at once. Jesus had, naturally, come back to life after 3 days of being dead, but even if they heard the story and believed in it, no Christian would expect to find him roaming the streets. Our friend squealed and screamed like a fangirl, unable to contain himself after finding out that yes, Christ was in fact alive. Jesus wasn't happy. He was bitter and resentful that one of his followers had betrayed him and the others had allowed him to be publicly tortured and killed. He fended off our friend as his character tried to hug and worship the son of God, who acted like a Hollywood superstar trying to deal with a particularly annoying paparazzi. They made a huge scene and got everyone to stop what they were doing to watch them. Jesus was embarrassed and desperately trying to get away, yelling obscenities at the man who at first refused to believe Jesus was alive, and now refused to believe Jesus was treating him like shit. He went from happiness and devotion to an utter feeling of butthurt as Jesus wouldn't accept his praise and love and would even go as far as to push him away and announce that he had nothing to do with his father or his teachings anymore - not after that whole deal with the crucifixion.\n\nOur friend went mad. His character, not able to accept a Jesus that was not the perfect image he had in his mind, started to harass him. He couldn't be the son of God, he had to be an impostor. A false prophet or a demon or whatever accusation he could come up with that didn't even make sense historically. Things had gotten ridiculous enough that the obscenely powerful beings that controlled the Market had shown up and politely demanded our friend to leave Jesus alone, but no Jesus would be left alone on that day. Our friend knew too well that the laws of the Market prohibited him from behaving like that. Attacking someone right then and there was suicidal and no one, much less an experienced player, would do that. But he wouldn't listen to reason. He didn't care. His anger towards us, the players, and the DM, specially, had turned into blind hatred against the NPC Jesus, and fuck if he wasn't going to get his revenge by beating Jesus up even if it meant the death of his character right then and there. The fact that everyone kept telling him this was a bad idea only convinced him further that this was what he wanted to do. He wouldn't listen to us. We all sucked and the DM sucked and it was time for blood. He drew his sword with the righteous fury of a thousand butthurt roomates and prepared to attack the defenseless hippie demigod, despite the pleads from the other PCs and warnings from NPCs. In the end he was disarmed, humiliated and kicked out of the Market, and marked for death by a dozen random entities that were offended by the scene they had been forced to witness.\n\nAfter that he refused to play with us again. Our DM, his roomate, moved out and never again they would talk to each other, their years-long friendship reduced to a pile of rubble and resentment and memories of that day when one single, brave man almost almost beat up the son of God.\n\nHail Mary, Hallelujah.",

        "text": "I recently came across a post that asked what the best action people had seen taken, and it reminded me of this story, so I figured I'd share it. :) This move wasn't actually performed by me. Quite the contrary, it was performed on me by another player.\n\nI was playing a dhampir who served under a vampire lord, and had been cultivating his power while following around the group. Playing the silver tongue within the party, I was tended to avoid major combat and preferred information gathering. I did, however, have more than enough power to hold my own. This both served and harmed the party as my character was notably selfish, but just endearing enough not to murder when he used the fighter as a human shield. Unfortunately, that endearing quality wasn't quite enough to keep them from turning on me when they found out I was working for big baddie. So I took off.\n\nThey tracked me down, ready to rip me a new one, and found I'd taken refuge with the vampire lord. One thing led to another, and the fighter and myself ended up in some arena combat. It was a one on one, his strength against my speed. The first round was a charge, and since I didn't have any other options at the time, I had to meet it. Of course, the fighter won, and he hit me with a greataxe. Hard enough to actually crack through several ribs with the swing. Fortunately, my undead fortitude did now allow him to kill me in a single stroke from one lucky roll, and the fight commenced. He'd attempt to crush me, not hitting often but hitting hard. I was winning through a thousand cuts though, and he knew it was getting bad. Unfortunately for me, the player lived for this kind of situation, and balls to the walls was what he was good at. He had cracked one of my weapons already, and he threw himself at me. With us both low in HP, he grappled me.\n\nSadly, my CMD was not exactly something I stacked like my dodge bonuses, and the bastard succeeded. He got a good on me from behind, planning to crush me to death with a bear hug, something an ox like our warrior was more than capable of. Happily, I had fangs, and grapples don't stop that. Rather than break the grapple or try and fight through the negatives with my remaining sword, I simply reached behind me, grabbed the fighter by the head, yanked it forward, and bit down. It became a race for him to crush me to death faster than I could drain him for HP. A race he was losing. He was down to 3 HP from unconsciousness, and I was slowly starting to gain health. Either he killed me THIS round, our I'd bring him down and kill him to heal myself. The player rubbed his chin, looking concerned. He took a moment, then this smile cracked his face and he chuckled. \"I'm rolling a sunder.\"\n\n\"Uh... what?\"\n\nThe look of confusion on at the table must have been funny, but the look he got when he answered our confusion must have been nothing but priceless. \"I'm going to sunder his chest cavity.\" The only thing that passed through my mind was \"Holy shit...\" The fighter reached into the massive wound he made in my chest on that first round charge, grabbed hold tightly to either side, and ripped wide. And wouldn't you know it, the bastard nat 20's it.\n\nJust from physical damage and his ridiculously high strength, it was enough to kill me. The DM declared that an unimaginable pain sears through my body, and there is a tremendous cracking sound as the broken ribs are torn apart by the metal gauntlets. The warrior lets go and drops me into a pile of my own gore. Of course, he reaches down to really own the victory.\n\n\"The world is pain for you, and you fall wetly to the ground. [The Fighter] reaches down to your broken body, into your open chest cavity. You realize he's going to tear out your heart. What are your last words as the heart is ripped from your chest?\" I said the only thing I could think of for a guy still shocked by how he was dying.\n\n\"Well... fuck.\"",

We spawned in different places on the map, but eventually, we met up.\nWe organized what we liked to call a \"Convoy\", but in reality, was just three cars. We thought \"Oh, We're all grouped together, some of us have guns, we'll be nice and dandy.\"\n\nWell, we set off, and our \"Convoy\" went through two cities, where we stopped to scavenge. By the time we left the second city, We were stocked up well, and ready for anything, except, some of us still didn't have guns. \n\nIt was around nighttime when the car leading the convoy ran out of fuel. We decided to pull over, fuel it up, then be on our way.\n\nOur cars screeched to a halt on the side of a road, miles away from any big cities. as soon as the last car stopped it's engines, we heard a gunshot. Everyone went quiet. My friend, David, went into total panic mode. He ran into the woods like an idiot.\n\nIt wasn't even five seconds, when he comes sprinting back, yelling at the top of his lungs.  Behind him, seven dudes, dressed in ghilly suits, all just blast him in the back with assault rifles. David died in a matter of seconds.\n\nAt this point, the Panic set in. everyone ran behind the cars to take cover. I took out my shitty 9mm pistol, and attempted to fire back. Everyone that had a gun followed suit. We managed to make them scatter, and go deeper into the woods.\n\nDespite our counteroffensive, the Ambushers were putting up a better fight. Soon, most of us were either almost out of ammo, or on the last mag.  I quickly thought up a plan. I went prone, crawling along the ground, into the woods. I grabbed my fireaxe, and then stood up and charged the ambushers from behind.\n\nMe attacking them from the back confused them. They stopped shooting just long enough for me to take down two of them by swinging my axe wildly. The people with enough ammo left quickly moved forwards, gunning down three of the ambushers. The remaining two realized they were losing, and ran deeper into the woods.\n\nIn a moment of adrenaline, I chased after them with my axe. One of them turned around, blasted me twice in the gut, and then continued to run.\n\nWhen I got back to the convoy, I learnt 1 dead, two injured.

Police arrive, question Irishman, get report from doctor, get officers to get the detective and get the aristocrat (party leader). I make checks every couple of minutes and the gentleman never wakes up.\n\nFinally the initial scene (which was supposed to be blocks away) is wrapped up and they'll start investigating in the morning.

        "text": "This is a continuation of a comically deranged all Dwarves campaign set in a hellish Mad Max style wasteland. \n\nPrevious Installments: \n\n [Chapter One: Alcoholics Make Terrible Miners](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2sg7ze/pathfinder_alcoholic_spelunking_an_all_dwarf_party/)\n\n[Chapter Two: Duergar-a-gogo](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2vc31u/pathfinder_alcoholic_spelunking_all_dwarves/)\n\n---\n\nThe end of the last session left many questions hanging in the air, but upon returning to the Deepwarden defensive bulwark the party had little time for investigation. They’d barely got their gear stowed and a few minutes of sleep before alarms began sounding throughout the town of Azamek. Glorin Thunderbeard was the only member of the party who knew what those alarms meant, having heard them once before in his youth: the surface of the town was under attack. \n\nTheir commanding officer, Moram Halfspear, took the best trained and most reliable Deepwardens and headed for the surface to fight...leaving a ten untrained and mostly green recruits under the party’s command in an unfinished fortification “just in case some underdark pests come sniffing around the back door.”\n\nThis left five recruits who had seen actual combat: Glorin, Barazun, Jozen and Sven, plus Dravona Goldspade, a new recruit recently transferred from the surface defenses for her skill in close-quarters fighting. They split up the unblooded rookies, each taking command of a unit of two, and got down to the serious business of drinking the alarms away. \n\nThe Underdark had other plans. \n\nThe defensive bulwark had been built on the sight of the party’s second fight with the duergar, a tunnel dug into the side of an ancient and long-dry dwarven reservoir. The bulwark itself jutted out into the reservoir cavern, the stone dotted with arrow slits on every available space and sturdy reinforced doors. Had it been complete, the night might have gone differently. As it stood, only one side was finished, and several walls had yet to be raised. As the party drank and laughed in their unfinished bunker, their enemies decided to strike while the iron was hot. \n\nThe first onslaught consisted of a dozen enlarged Duergar soldiers, nine feet tall, swinging massive hammers and screaming curses that were lost on a party who didn’t speak Undercommon. They got the general idea though, and ran to the unfinished outer wall to hold off the attackers. The recruits were dispatched to the arrowslits, to provide supporting fire while the more experienced Deepwardens plugged the gaps in the stone with their bodies. Barazun called on the power of his god and grew to match the Duergar in size, Jozen began to play his raging song on the bagpipes, and Sven opened the mind of one attacker to show him the true scale of the universe and his irrelevance therein, stopping him dead in his tracks. \n\nThe rest of the Duergar continued on, however. Their massive forms made for easy targets, but the recruits were practically pissing themselves with terror, and their shaking hands made lining up shots difficult. The monstrous dark dwarves met the frightened defenders at the wall, and those who could not press their enlarged bodies into the fight began to swing heavily at the unfinished walls, loosening masonry and cracking stone. \n\nAfter the initial shock, the recruits began to come into their own, firing point blank into the bodies of the duergar that pressed against the arrow slits. Barazun laid about himself with his intimidating headbutt, Sven yelled frantic but indecipherable orders in Aklo as his curse of tongues took hold, Glorin and Dravona delivered several killing shots with their crossbows, and Jozen abandoned his raging song after only a few piercing bars to enter the fight with his own bow. The Duergar, large and intimidating as they were, fell one after another - but not before one landed a crippling blow to Barazun’s knee. \n\nIt was Barazun who noticed the second wave first. While the huge bastards had them distracted, two more groups of duergar had taken up positions behind them, normally sized but wielding tower shields equipped with arrow slits through which they fired their own crossbows. They moved slowly, advancing cautiously as the last of their enlarged brethren fell, but by then they were barely forty feet from the wall, and Barazun, with his increased stature, could see over the shields, and he saw that these duergar formed mobile defensive walls for some kind of giant beetles. \n\n These Beetle Squads made for the unfinished walls, one squad on each side of the defenders, and laid down suppressing fire. Several of the recruits, frustrated with their inability to pierce the tower shields with their bolts, threw down their crossbows and charged in with their axes. Most of the party focused fire on the first Beetle squad, while Sven took his recruits and made for the unfinished masonry that seemed to be the target of the second. He reached the wall just as he heard the weird chanting that they’d come to recognize as the Duergar’s divine casting prayers, and the wall cracked, hairline fractures splitting the mortar and loosening the stones. The beetle, now in range, unleashed a spray of acid on the weakened wall, and a five foot section collapsed completely. \n\nGlorin, Jozen, and Dravona poured round after round of crossbow fire into the oncoming duergar, while the recruits scored several blows with their axes. But now the battle was beginning to turn in the Duergar’s favor. The first of the recruits fell to duergar bolts, and Sven was caught in a blast of beetle acid while attempting to flank the beast with his recruits. \n\nFinally, after losing much blood and littering the ground with a thick carpet of crossbow bolts, the first beetle was brought down, but the second still raged and spat its acid, dropping one of Sven’s recruits. And that’s when the third wave arrived. \n\nTwo more columns of Duergar, these flanking a pair of obvious spellcasters. One wore the standard armor of the duergar troops, but carried a cruel-looking scythe, and the other was mostly naked, grinning with cracked teeth as his hair and beard whipped wildly as though tossed by a wind no one else could feel. \n\nLow on bolts, most of the party rushed in to fill the gaps in the line the last push had left. Dravona managed to drop the last beetle, giving Sven enough time to grab one of the surviving duergar shield bearers from the second wave, desperately whispering a prayer to his dark patrons before smashing his enemies head in with a rock. \n\nHis masters listened....though he may have wished they hadn’t. His sacrifice was accepted, and Sven doubled over in pain, vomiting up a black sludge full of small wormlike things that crawled and slithered away into the darkness. He could feel something from the Outside suffusing his form, granting him the vitality to survive - hopefully. \n\nEven the dark dwarves were taken aback at this development. His allies missed several shots they should have made, distracted by the gruesome spectacle. More recruits began to fall as the duergar charged, attacking everywhere, hammering the dwarven defenders where they were weakest. Barazun stepped forward to shield his recruits with his enlarged body, channeling positive energy while he still had it. Dravona was running from firing position to firing position, trying to get lines of sight on the spellcasters before they could do anything too terrible. Jozen’s crossbow was practically smoking from the sheer number of bolts he’d fired, and Glorin advanced to hold the line next to Barazun. But none of them were expecting what came next. \n\nThe half-naked duergar ran straight at Barazun, and his beard reached out like a living thing to bite and claw at his enemy’s face. Several duergar surrounded Glorin and Barazun, but they held their own while Sven ran inside and cast an Obscuring Mist over the battlefield. \n\nWith the mist impeding everyone’s view, it was Dravona who saw the scythe-wielding duergar reach a pile of his dead comrades...who proceeded to stand up, dead-eyed and moaning worldessly as they turned to join the assault on Barazun and Glorin. \n\nAs soon as he saw the first zombies, Barazun channeled energy again, blasting and weakening the rising horde. His last recruit fell back to the edge of the mist and began to hack at anything that moved, striking down several of the undead. Dravona circled around the mist and managed to stick an axe in the back of the necromancer, but his death did not stop the wave of zombies that poured into the keep as Glorin and Barazun continued to battle the beardmancer. \n\nFinally the defenders managed to take the beardmancer’s head off, and the recruits managed - just - to hold off the undead as the mist cleared. The last zombie to fall was recognized as one of the recruits that had fallen earlier, and his brother wept as he returned him to true death. \n\nExhausted, completely out of resources, the party realized they had, somehow, survived against all odds. Bodies, blood, and hundreds of crossbow bolts were strewn about the cavern, but in the end they only lost a single man. \n\nBody Count:\n\n* Duergar Grunts: 32\n* Duergar Adepts: 6\n* Higher-level Duergar Spellcasters: 2\n* Dark spitter beetles: 2\n* Dwarven defenders: 1\n\nConsecutive Rounds of Combat: 15",

        "text": "Freck was a gnome, but nobody here knew that.  He'd spent a long time crafting the illusion of an attractive human male that disguised his small - but still handsome - form.  The humans didn't believe in gnomes anymore, and he was fine with keeping it that way.  He had been sent by the leader of the gnomish spies to observe the humans, and tonight he was doing just that.\n\nThe bar wasn't crowded - it was too early for that - but that hadn't stopped Freck from getting a few pints in already.  He had tipped the waitress with a \"gold coin\" earlier, but the image of flickering light had disappeared the moment it landed in her bodice and had no weight, so he knew he was on borrowed time.  Not only did the humans not believe in gnomes, they weren't too keen on magic either.\n\nThe two who entered the bar were interesting.  The taller had an unremarkable look to his face, but his armor was of a higher grade than you saw...well, anywhere, really.  Gilded, too.  The shorter looked military, and stalked into the bar in a strangely predatory way.  They made note of the handsome man drinking in the corner, and his strange companion, before taking a seat at the opposite side of the room.  The troll had decided to follow Freck into the bar after taking a swipe at his head and watching its enormous paw pass right through.  She was a cheap date, and Freck did always like to make an impression.  He'd named her Brunhilda.\n\nThe next man to enter the bar had a sword that was nearly as tall as he was slung across his back, and probably had noble blood considering the way he carried himself with such self-importance.  He was followed by a sheep, but he didn't seem to notice this.  The man (Freck decided to call him Big Sword) immediately headed for the barkeep and ordered a large meal, the sheep following him all the way.  The man in the golden armor (Golden Boy?) and his companion (Wolfie) seemed to have a great interest in Big Sword.  The beckoned him over and had what seemed to be an important conversation.  This seemed like it would be of interest to gnomish intelligence, some noble conferring with two well-equipped military types.  Also, the sheep continued to follow Big Sword and Freck thought this was just the best thing ever, especially since it was trying to sneak off with his meal while he spoke.\n\nWolfie grabbed the sheep, and with a yelp of surprise it transformed into a rather skinny, mildly attractive, and very naked young man.  There was some confusion. The confusion got worse when Freck made pants appear on him.  The confusion got EVEN WORSE when two half-conscious town guards were hurled through the front doors of the bar.  A voice from outside demanded that Big Sword come out or they would burn the place down.  Golden Boy and Big Sword questioned the guards while Wolfie kept an eye on Naked Guy.  Freck made it look like one of the guard's heads fell off.  Illusions were so fun, and he was so drunk, and this was great.\n\nIt wasn't so great when the guards turned into awful long-toothed monsters and started trying to kill everyone.  Naked Guy turned into a wolf while the others drew their weapons.  A merchant or two were eaten.  Brunhilda the troll threw herself in front of Freck to defend him, but he still managed to render the busty barmaid invisible long enough for her to escape.  Then he accidentally shot Naked Guy in the ass.\n\nThe long-toothed things were tough, but the other guys managed to kill one, and the other fled to the stables.  Freck sent Brunhilda to take care of it.  She didn't make it, but neither did the monster.  The bar was surrounded by more of those long-toothed things, but they couldn't get in for some reason.  Freck made it look like the place was already on fire so they wouldn't try to torch it, but that didn't work.  Of course it didn't work.  He was so drunk.\n\nOkay, these things were vampires, right? They're scared of holy things and onions or something.  He cast an illusion to make Golden Boy look like an angel and sent him out to scare off the other vampires.  It worked with some of the mooks, but the guy who was in charge stayed.  Freck realized that he'd run out of juice for the day.  No more spells.  And he was shit aim with his pistols.  Damn.  Golden Boy, Wolfie, and Naked Guy (who had turned into a cow for some reason) all charged out of the bar to face the remaining vampires.  Freck decided to hold back and provide cover fire.  He missed most of his shots.  The others fared better, and even managed to save a couple of the other bar's customers.\n\nSo what were they to do now?  Word of more vampires in the north, apparently something of personal interest to Big Sword and Golden Boy.  Wolfie would go along because he was friends with Golden boy.  Naked Guy (who now had real pants) would go along because he didn't have any other friends.  Freck would go along because these guys were great fun to watch and harass.  And also vampires.  Vampires ate gnomes too, right?\n\nTo be continued...",

It really means that the character believes in being organized and having a sense of honor. By this definition, Al Capone was ‘Lawful’ even though he broke quite a few laws. This was the creed of my favorite Rogue (though this was back when the class was called Thief). His name was Vastris the Clever and he was Lawful Neutral with good-ish tendencies. He didn't advertise his choice of occupation and most PCs and NPCs believed he was some kind of swashbuckler, since he was very careful never to be caught using his Thief skills openly. He had even practiced the Half-Swallowing technique used by escapologists like Harry Houdini in order to conceal small items (like his lockpicks).\n\nOur adventuring party was going through the classic quest module that starts with Against the Giants and ends with Queen of the Demonweb Pits. We had finally made our way to the Drow city and were unfortunate enough to be captured by some net traps the Drow had set up. Our Dungeon Master often added a lot of details and extra NPCs to modules as it was likely that at least one player had read them. The Drow disarmed and secured our group. They made certain to restrain us as fit the classes they thought we were. My character was dressed more or less like a Druid. Though he couldn't get any AC bonus from it, he carried a wood shield around along with a Scimitar that he didn't use in serious fights. It was more or less there for show. The Drow clapped everyone they suspected of being a Spellcaster in some magic-cancelling manacles, took everyone's equipment, and tossed each of us in an individual oubliette to await our fate. I waited several hours for the guards to get settled in, then set to work. Earlier, while tangled in a net, my character had half-swallowed his lockpicks.\n\nSeveral Climb Walls, Pick Locks, Hide in Shadows, Move Silently, and Backstabs later the party was loose and mostly (except for the Half-Orc) dressed in Drow Guard uniforms.\n\nThe party Cleric was astounded since he had, at one point or another, cast Know Alignment on every other member of the party. He spent a good deal of time during the rest of that particular adventure trying to figure out how I'd somehow fooled the spell as he was absolutely certain that a Thief couldn't be Lawful. It wasn't until after we resupplied from our NPC hirelings and they had his original Holy Symbol and magic items, which they had \"liberated\" from the Drow while we were busy escaping from the prison, that I let him in on the joke. My character had organized a Thieves Guild. I mercilessly stole a line from Terry Pratchett's Havelock Vetinari:\n\n\"You can't eliminate crime. If you're going to HAVE crime, it might as well be Organized Crime.\"",

The events of our play session were SO hilarious that I had to share. I hope you folks enjoy!\n\n\n\n\nDad had been playing this game for a few days already, so he knew what was what better than me. He went about building and doing other engineering things that were over my head. I hopped in our basic mining ship and started to mine resources for him out of the nearby asteroid. Skip forward 5-6 hours, and Dad has finished building me a new mining rig.\n\n\nIt was a beast. It had a modular cockpit that could detach from the mining rig and potentially latch on to and power other tool rigs. This design is seriously great. This was attached to a massive drill array that was a real monster. It had 16 drills on it (up from 2 on the starter), 32 thrusters (up from 8), 6 reactors (up from 1, and our actual space station only had 3), and a cargo bay that was a 300% increase in size. I mined in the 15 minutes or so that I had it probably about 50% of the total stuff I had mined with my starter ship in the previous 5-6 hours.\n\nThen I crashed it into our loading dock's airlock while trying to offload my mining haul.\n\nThe crash was actually pretty minor, but we WAY overcompensated on trying to recover from the damage. Our loss WOULD HAVE been the drills on the rig (which floated off into space and actually wasn't much of an investment, since all the power and stuff was on the piece we still had), some armoring around the station-side docking tube, and the actual airlock that allowed docking with the tube.\n\nInstead, over the course of the next 15 minutes, Dad died in the middle of space after running out of power in his suit. He was trying to chase the runaway drill array through space without a ship. He was carrying a lot of valuable materials our fabricator had constructed, which were now lost forever into the void, floating with his lifeless space suit.\n\nI was in another starter ship (one that was designed for construction work) that we had and was trying to latch on to the drills using its landing gear. I ultimately gave up after suffering minor damage to the construction ship. While the damage my ship sustained was minor, the type of damage it sustained was important. What I lost was a welder (nbd) and my REVERSE thrusters from the front of my ship. Meaning the thrusters that are supposed to slow you down as you approach your destination.\n\nAs a result, I came flying in at our platform at top speed only to realize I had no brakes. So I careened into the platform, destroying my ship almost completely, killing me, and taking out a MASSIVE chunk of our platform, including one of our 3 reactors.\n\nNeedless to say, Dad and I learned some important lessons about being good Space Engineers.\n\nTL;DR Dad spent 6 hours building me a cool new mining drill, I proceeded to crash it within 15 minutes. Chaos/hilarity ensued, a bunch of shit blew up, and the consequences will never be the same.",

        "text": "To try and get the feel of GMing a fully fledged only war game (I've been a player in a few games just never run one), I decided it might be a good idea to run a small practice session with 2 of 5 of the people (all of which I consider friends) I would be running the game for. \n\n(Side note we rolled a random campaign with a little bit of creative license and they're a heretical separatist stealth regiment with a large organisation that isn't the imperial guard on a hive world that also has orks)\n\nAnd initially it was pretty standard, they'd been put on guard duty in a watchtower in the middle of nowhere and after a time-skip of nothing happening, orks show up, a PC stick his head out a window, and fighting ensues. PC's win, and decide to investigate what they were doing out here, which leads them to a forest. where long story short they find a Runtherds' Camp with 12 cages full of snotlings. One of the PC's decides a genocide of snotlings is in order which attracts a group of 4 Squigs who tear apart an unsuspecting Gretchin, then one gets shot with a flare by a PC which kills one outright and sets another on fire. This scares the shit out of the other 2 who try to run away but one is killed and the others leg is shot off (living with 1 hp) and helpless.\n\nThis is where things get interesting because one of the PC's decided it would be a great idea to put it in one of the cages and keep it as a pet. I allowed this because why not, and for the next 2 hours they go through trying to tame it by feeding it, giving it painkillers, building it its own fucking little bionic leg (test failed by 2 degrees of failure so I said they made an Extremely Bad Quality leg that requires a difficult agility test to move any significant distance) and trying their hand at trying to make the squig less terrified of it's kidnappers/leg destroyers. Through some miracle of good rolls they managed to do pretty well (although they bloated the squig by feeding it to much of its charred friends) and the squig eventually got to the point of not trying to attack them and being cautiously friendly (despite shocking it to make it pass out for the leg addition surgery, although they did test the shocking on themselves first to make sure it wouldn't kill the squig). To make it feel better about not having a good leg they even caught a rat and let it \"battle\" the squig for a confidence boost (It was pretty one-sided). They even tried walking it outside it's cage and every time it fell over (it never passed a single agility test) they would just put it back on its feet.\n\nIt was genuinely a lot of fun to do this practice session and apart from not checking on what certain NPC traits did (it was a pretty impromptu session), I think I did a decent job and they had a lot of fun.\n\nThe squig (they named it Peg) also has a character sheet now. If anyone has any squig related tips/trivia/information please share it, I feel like this is going to be an important part of future sessions (I've decided that although they probably won't be able to talk their way into keeping it on-base, they might be able to keep it outside or something).\n\nAlso here is they're picture of it (completely 110% accurate ms paint editing job btw) http://imgur.com/qMRVh0V",

        "text": "So where to start? I became the DM around the time Skyrim came out after our first DM moved away. My first homebrew game was pretty uch a copy-pase of Skyrim. You can look the details if you check out the Dragon cult post I made.\n\nAnyways. There was something from then that always made it into my games. We joke around about questboards in my games. There is one in every major town or city. On there are bounties, quests, tasks, requests... and a poster for the \"worlds deadliest temple\". Or Temple to Atlantis for short.\n\nAt the beginning it was just a joke. A small cameo. Now you should know that more or less every campaign we take on takes place in a different world. Our usual games take from 30 to 50 hours, and we complete them in a month or two. My players prefer doing things like this, and so do I. But in every world there was this \"Temple to Atlantis\" poster.\n\nAnd over the last 3 years a whole bunch of stories made it's way into how the temple works and what's inside. And boy is it something to watch. And I didn't come up with any of it! It was all the work of my players.\n\nSo what is cannon in the temple? We should probably start with the story. Atlantis was a continent in one of the worlds. It was an utopia... Except they were still under the control of the gods. It was a full democracy (meaning *everybody* of decides about everything concerning the country), so after a debate they went all: \"Let's overthrow the gods so we can be free of their rule.\" You can imagine how well that went. Atlantis sunk... Well not quite. As a last resort the Atlantean mages cast a spell removing them from the flow of space and time and into the sea of chaos (a sea between the worlds). Atlantis was put into a protective bubble and was in that sea for about 10 000 years.\n\nOf course some of the people stayed behind and wanted to return, and some were torn away by the spell and landed in different worlds. Some stayed behind of course and adapted to living in the sea and on the land. So they build these temples that lead to Atlantis. But they had to protect it (and Atlantis) from intruders, so they put in more traps than you'd want. You know Tomb of Horrors? Apparently it's a joke compared to this.\n\nSo what is the temple filled with? Ah you know, the usual. Monsters, behilders, tarrasques (from different worlds, so multiple of them), giant statues that want to destroy you, bottomless pits with spikes, elemental traps (there are 36 basic elements in our games, so good luck with overcoming that!), a room with a kraken, a room where you go insane over time, doors that open into different worlds (including, but not limited to, the elemental planes and pocket planes where monstrous gods exist), labyrinths filled with wraiths and shadows and skeletons and zombies and a glowing cube that creates dragons if you attack it. There's also something about it being in all worlds at the same time, so if you get dispelled (one way or another), you stop being attuned to the world you came from and if you exit (if you can even exit), you are flung into a random world. Good luck!\n\nSo after over 3 years of my players making things up for this temple, they finally pulled me over and said to me that they want to play trough it. It took me three weeks, more than 3 days wasted time, and over 30 empty papers (I write really small too) to come up with it. And now it exists. It's actually not as bad as Tomb of Horrors... yet. The thing with the temple is that it's always evolving. There's also a guy cursed to stay within it and expand it (also acts as the final boss, and is just ressurected if he's killed), so who the hell knows what else will be in it the next time you go in. Oh. There's also an empty room. No gelly cubes (yea, there's a room of that too), no traps, no going insane, no teleports to worlds filled with insane gods. An actual empty normal room.\n\n**TL;DR:** So yea. This is the story about how over 3 years a joke becomes the craziest dungeon I (and by \"I\", I mean my players) ever came up with.",

        "text": "So in my game we had two characters (at least that are important to the story). One was a dragonborn paladin (NG) that was all about the law of man. His thinking was all about the law of man (and other mortal creatures). The other was a human druid (TN) who was all about nature. Nature rules above all. Law of the fittest. The usual stuff.\n\nThe game started simple. Their task was to kill this warlord that was killing people. Simple. Yet the druid was all: \"Well, you see, he is the stronger man. Why should we kill him? Survival of the fittest.\" I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the gist. And the paladin was going: \"He is commiting things that the law forbids! He should be stopped!\" So they bickered back and forth, but they mostly went with the plot I set up with... Until the last session. One way or another it would be last. They were to either stop the warlord, or he was to kill them.\n\nSo the final night comes, and the druid and the paladin start fighting. They are about 1 km from the warlord's camp. The two were fighting about what they should do with the warlord. The druid was still saying they should let him live. He was the strongest man. He did kill only those that opposed him and nobody else. People were somewhat well off under his rule (as long as they didn't oppose him). It was kind of a nicer version of a dictatorship.\n\nThe paladin was saying they should kill him. None of his people are really free, not even his own army, that the rule of men forbid one from taking the life of another without a just cause. The rest of the party (a wood elf ranger, a thiefling warlock, and a halfling rogue) were sitting back (both in game and in real life) and drinking ale (just in game, in real life they were eating chips and drinking cola - DON'T TOUCH MY BOOKS WITH DIRTY HANDS!) and enjoying the fight. I asked them multiple times what they want to do. They always just said they sit back and watch the two fight. It was an amazing roleplay session to be honest.\n\nSo I was thinking what to do. I made a scout for the warlord come in and see the two fighting. He called over a platoon to eliminate them, but the players (the ones watching) convinced them to join in and watch them fight.\n\nOver the next hour (in game) the rest of the army, and the warlord himself, joined i drinking the ale and listening to the two guys fight.\n\nThe two did persuasions checks on the listeners, and... I don't know what to call this. They rolled nothing bellow 17. For 25 consecutive rolls. Nothing bellow 17. Their persuasions were high. By the end the warlord himself didn't know if what he did was right or not. They were *that* great.\n\nUntill the druid rolled a 1. Ouch. And then the paladin rolled a natural 20. Then a 7, and an 18. Morning came and the warlord recalled his troups to head back home. He changed his ways and the campaign was won... Kind of. The questgivers weren't that happy with them not killing the warlord, but they accepted the fact that the warlord wasn't invading anymore. The druid was happy as the warlord wasn't killed. The paladin was happy with the warlords changed ways. And the warlord *still* kept the land he had taken.",

        "text": "[Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2vyzy6/rogue_trader_back_in_green/)\n\nWe last left our intrepid explorers rocketing away from a completely rekt Holy Terra, on their quest to conquer the entire webway, because reasons. We refitted DA WAAAAAAGHON with an engine stolen from an Ultramarine battle barge, we replaced Da Kaptin's Chair with The Golden Throne of Terra, and grabbed as many boyz as we could. And so, part 2 begins!\n\n___\n\nGazbag punches da big red button and da enjins roar to life. Snagagrub glows green and closes his eyes up in his Weirdboy Towah. After a moment, he points at screams \"DAT WAY BOSS!\" Gazbag scratches his head with his power klaw \"Uhhh... wich way?\" \"DAT WAY!\" \"ZOG IT! WAAAAGH!\" None of us were smart enough to actually check which way Snagagrub was pointing. Oh well.\n\nDa Krew gets to their usual shipside muckin' about. Gazbag wanders the halls bossing around smaller orks. Skugtaga steals everything that isn't nailed down and attempts to sell it back to the previous owners for ridiculously inflated prices. \"Ahf course it's new! I just got it! Paint's still wet, see?\" But what really sets this trip apart is the enterprising actions of Zapstrak and Zagbar.\n\nZapstrak and Zagbar have always been good friends, collaborating on many a ~~completely idiotic~~ groundbreaking project, but this time they did something so ~~retarded~~ innovative that it ~~almost killed them all~~ changed war forever.\n\nZagbar wanders into Zapstrak's shop, when he spots a monstrosity of a weapon that Zapstrak is working on. \"Zapstrak... da zog is dat...\" 'Dat' was a 9 foot long, 6 foot tall, shoddily welded smooth bore cannon. Zapstrak turns to face Zagbar with a crazed look in his eyes. He is clearly hyped up on the 'Urty Juice. \"IT'S MAH SHOKK ATTAK KANNON! IT'S LIKE DAT GUN I BILT, BUT MOAR SHOOTY!\"\n\nZagbar looks the cannon up and down, and rolls Tech-Use to see whether he can assess whether it's structurally sound. He rolls a 95. \"IT LOOKS PERFECT! I'Z GOTZ AN IDEA!\"\n\nZagbar runs back to his lab, grabbing two squigs, a boy, and yelling at Grots until they follow him out of fear, and he starts ecksperimentin'.\n\nFirst, he creates a Shuriork. An ork with all their limbs replaced with Power Klaws. He succeeds on his Medicae check, and sends the Ork waddling back to Mekbay.\n\nNext, he hastily constructs a few shokk kollars (actually succeeding on his Tech-Use roll this time) and attaches them to the Grots, so it knocks them unconscious every time they wake up. He then force feeds them psyker sensitive materials (mostly stuff looted from Chaos Sorcerers and Daemons), to create Psygrots; batshit crazy incredibly powerful psyker grots.\n\nFinally, he force feeds the Squigs promethium and shrapnel, creating Bomm-Squigs. He takes all of this crap back to Zapstrak. \"I'Z GOTS SOME AMMO! Let's test it...\"\n\nThey attach a trakk to the bottom of the kannon, and haul it to cargo bay, where they attempt to test this potentially world destroying, space-time tearing, poorly built weapon... on a snotling. Zapstrak steadies the kannon (by hitting it with a power klaw), while Zagbar takes aim. When the all clear is given, they load a Bomm-Squig into the kannon, and fire, resulting in a catastrophic ~~failure~~ success. A massive hole in the warp tears open and a greater Daemon of Khorne (Bloodthirster) climbs out, and starts going ham with its greataxe. Needless to say, Zapstrak considered this a great success, as clearly this kannon turns Squigs into Daemons. Obviously.\n\nAfter watching on with pride for a while, they decide that they should PROBABLY call Da Krew down here to deal with Daemon before it rips a hole in the hull. The fight goes as one would expect. Da Krew tanks most of the hits like total champs, the Daemon tanks most of his hits like a total champ, Zagbar gets knocked down to criticals, and we win. But it gets worse.\n\nZagbar needed Surjery. The only person on the ship who can even attempt surjery is Zapstrak, who has no arms. He replaced both of them with power klaws. Taking a -40 on his medicae check, Zapstrak fails on his surjery, and succeeds in bisecting Zagbar.\n\n*Can I make this a Tech-Use test instead?* asks Zapstrak's player. *No... it's Medicae. You're gonna have to roll it again. GM's call.* replies the GM. *THEN I ROLL TO INTIMIDATE THE GM!* He rolled a 1. Zapstrak successfully intimidated the universe into allowing it to be a Tech-Use roll instead of a Medicae roll. Zapstrak used his successful Tech-Use roll to replace the lower half of Zagbar's body with an awesome cybork body that slowed him down considerably, but made him much 'arder.\n\n___\n\nThe rest of the trip goes uneventfully. Zagbar adjusts to his Cybork body, while Zapstrak builds Maggrim a new jetpack (one not fitted with explosives this time). Da Krew exits warp travel, and arrives in... dead space. There is nothing here. They can't see shit. Not only did they not listen to Snagagrub (who failed his navigation check anyway), they also got thrown of course in the warp.\n\n**\"ZOOOOOOOOOOOG!\"**\n\n___\n\nSo that's where we ended it. I realise it's pretty much all \"Zagbar and Zapstrak's stupid-ass adventures\", but that was really what the session was. They're really the only ones that do anything interesting on the ship. There was some ship combat once we exited warp travel, but it was very dull and not worth including. The GM leaked that next session promises glorious combat, so we'll probably see Skugtaga and Maggrim start to shine.",

        "text": "The game started with the fighter hitting the hinges until they broke. While he was doing this the cleric was screaming all kinds of things hoping some kind of guard would come. Instead he brought down more zombies. The fighter killed all 6 by himself by using the femur of a skeleton in a cage near his as a club. Thus they started calling him \"Mighty Oak\" instead of \"Little Acorn.\" The Sorcerer used her chains like a whip and they started calling her \"Two Chainz.\" Now the party makes their way upstairs. Finds 4 rooms. A bathroom (buckets lol), a pantry full of rotted food, a store room with all their gear, and room with empty beds and trunks at the end. They rolled on who would search which room. The cleric landed the room with beds and for some reason lit it on fire, burning all the beds and boxes. All loot was destroyed.\n\nThey go up the next set of stairs to find a courtyard with 8 zombies and 4 skeletons on the walls standing guard. The sorcerer uses prestidigitation to launch sparks and music so that she could get the attention of everyone outside. As they all start approaching the party steps back into the stairs to funnel them. The zombies kept rolling 1's so I'd have them fall down the stairs. I doubt rotting flesh is good on stairs. Of course the fighter was in front tanking. He made his dex check to avoid going down too but the other two failed. So zombie one is on top of them both. Zombie two rolled a 1 and went down too. We have a house rule that keeps the if you miss by 4 or more on a ranged attack that it hits a random square. So for some reason all the skeletons kept firing into the doorway and kept hitting zombies instead of party members. The cleric is on the bottom and tries to make a strength check to push everyone off of him. He rolls a 1. Basically he lifted them up a little bit then his arms gave out. They landed back on top of him. He takes 2 dmg. The fighter is killing zombies left and right. The skeletons keep rolling 1's and falling off of walls. The two zombies at the bottom pretty much start hardcore killing the cleric and sorcerer. The cleric goes down and the sorcerer runs and hides. He natural 20's his save. Back up he comes with 1 hp and kills the zombie in front of him. Zombie 2 misses him and one of the random arrows flies by him. He goes \"That almost hit me in the knee!\" and he kills the zombie next turn. Feeling triumphant he starts boasting. One of the random arrows then hits the square he's in. I decided it totally hit him right in the knee. He goes down again and the fighter yells \"Your such a glass canon\" Now his nickname is Glass Canon. The sorcerer stablizes him and he sees the fighter with the last two zombies. He goes \"I'm killin em' all\" He runs right past the fighter and the zombies, both opportunity attack's miss, he hits the top of the stairs and rolls a 20 to hit a skeleton. Disintegrates it. The fighter kills his and the sorcerer kills the one behind that one. The cleric goes down again due to arrow hits. Fighter uses his extra action to dash across the courtyard and up the stairs to the skeletons. He hits one. In following turns he kills them all and the sorcerer saves the cleric again.\n\nThey go back down to the prison and take staggered rests for 8 hours each. The fighter wakes up and goes to investigate. From the door he could see the lord's keep with his throne and such. He could also see another set of stairs going down. He hears screams coming from the throne room and goes down to get the others. They wake up the cleric after only 5 hours of sleep. They go in the throne room and keep searching around looking for a way to get down to the screams. They finally find a button under the chair's arm and it moves backwards. They climb down the stairs and see the girl from before chained to the wall all cut up. They look around the room and don't see anything but a couple bats and her.\n\nThey rush in to save her and the bats turn into imps. The girl disappears (never really there) The cleric still has little life and the imp catches him off guard and almost downs him with one hit. Initiative time. Fighter goes first and readies an attack. The sorcerer rolls a 1 to hit and tries to hits the one opposite side of the cleric and hits him. He's down. She rolls a 01 for her wild magic and it say's she has to roll at the end of every turn. First she summoned a unicorn. We rolled to see where it came up at and it was in front of the fighter. Since the imps went were invisible, the fighter's readied attack had a trigger that was anything appearing in front of him... so he swung at the unicorn. He missed and made his check to convince it that he wasn't attacking it but attacking his enemy. He then asks it for help and passes that too. The imps use their turn to go invisible and hide. The unicorn looks around and only see's the sorcerer. We rolled percentile to see if it thinks she's the enemy. It does. She's downed this turn but the wild magic effect doesn't say it ends on knocked out so we kept it going. The cleric rolls another 20 and comes back up again. Fighter kills imp one and two. She has the blinding flash come up next so the fighter is scared to wake her up. Then talking pink bubbles. Sorcerer casts fly on random character. Hits cleric. He flies up. She has at this point failed two checks and passed two. She makes her last check and fails. She'd die but her wild magic's effect is suck 1d10 health from everyone around her. She rolls all 10's. It was so good I let it keep her from dying. The cleric isn't as lucky. With only 1hp he falls from the sky and is out of hp. Fighter stabilizes him. They hear yells from behind the chained walls. It was a fake wall. Fighter breaks them down and finds the young girl on the other side. We'd said originally that she was really young. Our cleric makes persuasion to convince her that he saved her and deserves a kiss. So he kisses the 14yr old girl. Tries to seduce her too. They then rename him \"Glass Canon the Pedophile\" He keeps swearing that he didn't remember that she was young. The fighter goes \"Man, I'm a strong Mother Fxxker\" They didn't understand the reference. So they think he sleeps with mothers... they rename him \"Mighty Oak the Mother Fxxker\" and the final member is now \"Two Chainz the Coward\" due to the fact that she kept running away from fights. Day two was good as well. Players are now level 3.",

        "text": "After many terrible attempts at a campaign and many terrible newbies, we finally put together a good campaign. I had to set some rules this time but it fixed a lot. No more evil characters and no more sexual elements.\n\nEveryone decided to make humans. We also shortened the party. Our other campaign has 6 and this one has 3. Testicules the war cleric, Tobias the great weapon fighter, and Alice the crazy wild magic sorcerer. She's a little out there and wears chains at all times. Even used her starting money to buy manacles to wear and wears the key around her neck. They decided to be a group of strangers from the same town. One born there, one that wondered in there, and one who was at a temple there.\n\nOur campaign started with our group seeing a fire in the distance and hearing faint screams. Our party arrives on a hill overlooking a town. The town of course is overrun with zombies. A man comes screaming by them covered in blood. The fighter knocks him down and sits on him while they question him. After explaining that they aren't dying like normal people, the party lets him go and goes into the town. The war cleric for some reason decides to throw his javelin and rolls a 2... it hits the ground almost in front of him and then forgets about it... He finally decided to go get it on Sunday after we started on Friday. Anyway, after that failure, the party starts killing zombies. For some reason the cleric also decided not to prepare any healing spells. This made things fun.\n\nAfter both the cleric and fighter going down, they killed all 10 zombies and broke into a house. At this point the sorcerer started calling the fighter \"little acorn\" They closed the door and tried to sleep. A girl came screaming to the door and of course as a lawful good fighter, Tobias let her in. As she got in the zombies came banging on the door. At this point, she passes out and only the cleric is sleeping. I rolled percentiles to see when they broke down the door. After 3 hours they get in. During this time only the cleric was sleeping. There were 3 and they died pretty quick. The party decided to stay in here for another 9 hours for some reason. The party all goes to sleep and when they woke up they were all naked and in prison cells. Thus ends the first day. 24 zombies met their end and all players snagged 400 xp and got lvl 2.\n\nGame was short due to making characters, laying down rules, and not to mention meet and greet.

        "text": "Disclaimer: I'm not 'vote brigading' here, just saying that if you didn't already know about it, check out /r/storiesofwar, and if you like it, you could always subscribe or contribute, but I couldn't care less whether you do or not (does that cover me?)\n\n**Recent Counter-Strike story, by user ShouniAishaKuma**\n\n___\n\n\nThis is a story of me and my mates playing a 5-stack in CSGO.\n\nWe began the game with a very weak T-side, ending the first half with the scoreboard at 3-10 in their favor. However once we swapped over to CTs, we decided to pick positions and stick with them, and to rotate only if someone called a group of 3 or more Ts or if the bomb was spotted. I ended up with the job of covering cat, and I was able to keep the Ts from wanting to push up cat by constantly varying my angles and some very good smokes/molotovs.\n\nThe game had gotten to an incredibly close 14-12 in our favor. We were all relatively well funded, but then the T's took a round, throwing us off of our game. With the scoreboard at 14-13, we decided to go for a force buy in order to try and take the T's by surprise. Unfortunately, we ended up losing another round. This forced us to Eco, and through some black magic we actually managed to win the Eco (however it was at a heavy cost; we had lost all but one). The scoreboard was now 15-14, and we didn't have enough money for a full buy. I only had enough money for a Five Seven, a flashbang, and Kevlar+Helmet.\n\nIn my head I was thinking, *\"Fuck. This game is going to end up a tie.\"*\n\nI went to go cover cat from quad boxes. I heard calls from our watcher mid, *\"I see two going cat- FUCK. AWP mid. I think he's pushing up through mid.\"*\n\nI steeled myself for my inevitable death and watched in horror as a pop flash bounced into the air. With lightning speed, I turned around and managed to dodge the brunt of the flash. By the time I had turned back around, one T was already pushing up cat stairs. Time froze. My cursor was already lined up with his head. Two shots, and he went down. The next T rushed up after his teammate, thirsty for blood. I immediately opened fire, eventually catching him with yet another headshot.\n\nAt this point in time, I notice my teammates are frantically calling for help on B-site. *\"Bomb is upper tuns. Two in upper tuns! AWP is CT mid! Rotate, rotate!\"* Two more of my teammates went down - one to the AWP mid as he rotated from long, the other killed by a well placed shot on B-site. It's just me and another CT. He's posted on car, and is quickly killed by 2 T's rushing out from tuns.\n\nAt this point, I decided to try and kill the AWP mid. I jumped down to CT Spawn and saw him watching B doors. Down he went to two quick shots. 1v2. As I pushed up through CT Spawn, a T came out of B doors and hid behind B boxes. I managed to dink him as he came out of B doors. He peeked me and managed to bring me down to 28 health before my trusty Five Seven brought him down with another headshot. 1v1.\n\nI'd come this far already. Fuck it. I ran and threw a pop flash through window, running out with it. The flash went off and I managed to catch the last T, hiding behind headshot box. With another spray I managed to bring him down, grabbing the Ace and the 16-14 victory.\n\nI haven't had a game since with that much excitement/glory.\n",

This was classic mode, and someone else already claimed doctor, so he got on the stand. This was my new to the game friend, and he switched role claims, and got all the guilty votes. Got an achievement for doing it quick. But that doesn't even compare to the next one.\nI was Exe again. First night, I claim invest again and say he works with knives. He claims doctor, and I thank god that the people now trusted me. But I wasn't sure how to get him lynched. I played on the down low, and he died. But right before, someone said I was night immune. So this lead to everyone hating me, and I was at this point jester. I faux defended, and was pardoned by a tie vote. This game was  very close, and I was very disappointed. ",

        "text": "I was playing a one shot years ago.  It was pretty simple, stop the magical bomb from going off.  There was a cleric, a sorcerer, a fighter (me) and a halfling rogue.  We lost the cleric early to a pit trap that had a gelatinous cube in the bottom of it.  There goes our healing.  After a few fights, I have about half hp, the sorcerer is mostly full, but the rogue is down to a smidge of hp, I want to say single digits, but I could be wrong.  There is one final chamber, full of beasts and mercenaries.  We thought of clearing the room, the disabling the bomb, but one of them saw us and turned on the timer.  \n\n\"Plan\" B then took place, which consisted of me having the rogue, tossing him on my shoulder, and telling the sorcerer to distract as many of them as possible, and running to the bomb to drop the half dead guy on the bomb to make a disable device check, while I turn back to keep him safe.  I run, people shoot at me, I drop the rogue on the bomb only to see some arrows sticking out of the key point in our plan.\n\nThe sorcerer calls out that I have to do it, I have a -6 or so to my disable device.  I roll, I got a -2.  All the dice at the table are pooled, rolled 6 or so times, and add up to an enormous amount of damage.  All characters I have from then on now have at least a +2 in disable device.",

This story involves Cynic discovering the potency of Laspistols.\n\nThe Cast\n\nCynic the Gunslinger - My cynical friend playing a wannabe edgy Clint Eastwood-rip off.\n\nPsycho the Psychic - My terrifiying friend playing a borderline sociopathic psyker.\n\nSmiles the Investigator - 1920s/1930s Noir cop rip off. The talker of the group, good at getting info.\n\nThe group have finally dealt with the gangs, without any further ridiculousness (apart from the vehicle flipping, acrobatic incident, but that doesn't warrant its own post) and have discovered links between the two cults (Khorne and Slaanesh) and the local politics. They have been moved to a flashy hotel and are investigating.\n\nThey attend a party, which ends with Psycho shoulder-choking an influential politician, and they are told of speeches being made by the Planetary Governor candidates (there are currently elections taking place on the planet). The three attend, an during one of the speeches, there is an assassination attempt. The group spot the assassin and give chase.\n\nThe assassin runs down an alley, where his path is blocked by Psycho telekinetically moving large bins in the way. The assassin spins around and shoots at Psycho as Cynic and Smiles enter the alley.\n\nThe assassin draws two chainswords and charges the group. After a couple of rounds of combat, Cynic knocks the assassinto the floor, where the assassin manages to land a crit on Psycho and nearly disembowel him. The PDF arrive as Cynic draws his laspistol and says \"I want to shoot him in the leg to stop him from running away, so we can question him.\" He hits and rolls the damage. He takes him below 0 wounds. Cynic rolls n the critical effects table.\n\nAnd rolls 10.\n\nFor those unaware, a 10 on nearly any weapons critical effect table in DH, regardless of the body part hit, will kill. The group watch in horror and the leg combusts into flames from the energy shot, which quickly consume and kill the assassin.\n\nThe session after that, Psycho has managed to get out of hospital, and the group has found a lead that could incriminate a politician (the same one Psycho shoulder-choked) and wind up in a night club. Psycho waits outside in a vehicle as Cynic and Smiles enter. They spot a politicain being taken upstairs and follow. They see him being taken into a room and listen through the door, but get detected by a Pysker.\n\nA bodyguard is sent to investigate. Smiles draws his knife and tries to stab the bodyguard while draggin him back, and covering his mouth with his hand. He succeeds in stabbing him in the neck, however the guard is stronger and slams him against the wall. Cynic quickly takes out his silenced laspistol and puts it under the bodyguard's unarmoured chin. Hopefully the shot will be muffled by the silencer and the fact the barrel is against the chin.\n\nIts an instant hit and Cynic rolls for damage. He rolls high and he doesnt have to go through armour, so he does a lot of damage. He even takes the guard below 0 wounds. He rolls on the critical effects table…\n\n…and rolls 10.\n\nThe guard's head explodes, and the rest of his body is set on fire. The headless, flaming body goes charging into the room, terrifiyng and alerting all the cultists inside the room, setting two others on fire. One cultists with incriminating documents tries to jump through a window to escape, only to be ran over by Psycho. The enflamed guard sets a table on fire, which Smiles throws into the remaining three cultists, setting them and the entire room on fire.\n\nAnd so that was the second building they've burnt down.",

        "text": "So, I will use this preface to ask all of you to share whatever amazing adventures you've had--after all, I waste all my time reading DnD stories anyway.  \n\nWe were playing a bastardized 3.5 Homebrew that basically boiled down to 3.5 character sheets, with 4e healing surges, and we rolled when the time came.  We were a group of 3, myself being the DM, and tonight (and the weeks after) we would play Dungeons and Dragons for the first time.\n\nAesin Doveen was a paladin of Pelor, (With homebrew Pelor-flavored abilities) who had fled his home kingdom under the protection of his orc bodyguard/best friend: Gurrak Makheil.  Aesin's father, the king of Byanthia, had been killed in a coup.  The king's army had found Gurrak as an infant in a raid on an orc village, and chose to take him back to be raised alongside Aesin as the young prince's protector.  They had saved his life, and now he had saved Aesin's.  They didn't know how far they had run, or what befell the kingdom.  They heard there was a town ahead, and Aesin was seeking an army to help him reclaim his throne.\n\n(I had prepared maybe one page of what you are about to see, the rest was improv.  That night, I learned the struggles of DMing.)\n\nSo they begin by walking down a forest path, knowing a town is ahead.  Fog is thick, and its the middle of the night.  They toss a few perception checks, and hear some unintelligible shouting.  Very quickly, they find out he's yelling \n\"SO HUNGRY\" as the thin old man stabs feebly against Aesin's half-plate.  The 8'4\" orc was having none of it.  First combat roll of the night, first EVER.  Nat 20.  Guy's head rolls off clean.\n\nThey continue down the path, and eventually find it split by a thin chasm.  They toss some stones down it, and decide to take a side path.  It leads to a residential district just outside of the walled city, they peep in a few houses and find nothing useful.  Peeping into the last house, they catch the glimmer of a cloak, and the last second of a man with white hair and purple pants (Which I mentioned to indicate a noble status) disappear into the closet.  They barge in, ignoring the corpse on the floor, and check the closet.  Nada.\n\nThey turn attention to the thing now, an elf male surrounded by 2 circles and a fuck ton of runes.  There was a thin knife wound in his chest.  They scratch out the outside circle with a dagger, and the thing stands up.  They try to talk to it.\n\"What is your purpose here?\" \n\"Rise.\"\n\"Who just did this to you?\"\n\"Rise.\"\nThey try to say \"Rise\" back, and it just yells it louder.\nSo they burn the house down.  Go to sleep across the street to check it out in the morning.  Everything is gone except the circle of floor the thing is still standing in.\n\nThey try everything they can think of until Gurrak has had enough and announces that he pisses on the second circle. This breaks it, and the thing steps back and falls over.  There's another rune carved into the floor.   They pull up that floorboard and stick it in Gurrak's backpack.\n\nOn their way back to the fork in the road, they meet this blonde bombshell of a commoner woman limping down the street.  She's got a barrel lid in one hand and a metal fence post in the other.  Introduces herself as Anna, and joins the party.  They ask if she knows what \"This Thing\" (the rune) is, and she tells them that the Loremaster past the city should know.  The sun is setting, they wasted most of their day on the corpse.\n\nThey make it into town at night, much to Anna's dismay.  She tells them that the things have been coming at night.  They're ambushed by a group of tall, thin skeletons with black mummified flesh pulled tight to the bone.  They dub them \"Fiends.\"\n\nGurrak gets desperate, grabs Aesin, and tells him to get ready.\n\"I throw him.\"\nThey look at me, Aesin's player says,\n\"He can't!\"\nMe: \"I don't know, his strength is 20.  You can't really stop him.\"\n\nAesin soars through the air, spinning and bashing three of them down.  He lands in the middle of six of them, and Gurrak and Anna rush in to show their combat prowess.  They find refuge in a blacksmith shop, where Anna dons leather armor and ditches her makeshift gear for two rapiers that Gurrak found.  In the morning, they get through the town and find a man holed up in a guard tower.  Turns out, it was his first night on the job when the fiends attacked, so he just barred himself in.  Name's Donovan, nice to meet ya!\n\nHi, Don.\n\nParty leaves town and gets to walking, find out that Anna lost her husband and kid to the fiends.  Down the road, Don mentions he's hungry.  Gurrak nearly decapitates him, remembering the old man from earlier, but stays his hand.  He opens his pack to find some rations, and Don sees the board.  He accuses them of necromancy and witchcraft and attacks.\n\nThey beat him down, and decide to spare him, but Anna had other plans.  She crit her last attack and drove the rapier through his neck.\n\nBye, Don.\n\n(Will continue in comments.  Need more coffee.)",

        "text": "A SW:EotE adventure that went as bad as possible, through a series of poor decisions. Cast of characters:\n\nKara &amp; Hadrian: 2 Human Bounty Hunters who have been through thick and thin together  \nBisol: A Duros Pilot/Tech specialist  \nKadirra: A Zabrak force sensitive, who is trying to hide her nature from the rest of us out of fear of the Empire.\n\nBisol was a happy pilot, he got to fly his ship all around the galaxy exploring for his boss, finding new treasures and technology. One day he returns to one of his companies ports to find his boss and a small group of battered looking people, he is given orders to be their pilot while they function as sort of unofficial mercenaries for the company.\n\nHe then proceeds to spend more of the next month in hospital than he does anywhere else. He suggests we take an exploration contract to get away from death and destruction. On the flight to the abandoned mining colony his hyperspace drive is destroyed by a malevolent AI.\n\nWith our main hyperspace drive destroyed, we take a month to limp to Corellia. Our ship needs 100,000 credits to repair, and we have 60,000 between us. So we set up a detective agency to make some money, and take on a bounty for a serial killer.\n\nThrough detective work we find out that the subject of the bounty was elsewhere during the timeframe, so we go to his new location (a very small farming town) to confirm he was there. Hadrian and Kara start asking questions in a cantina and get into an argument with the barkeep because they won't tell him why they want to see the suspect.\n\nWe leave the cantina. Hadrian hides in a water barrel to observe the cantina, Kara goes to ask more questions at another store and gets nowhere again. Bisol heads to the local records office to try and find a place of residence for the suspect. He finds that the suspects parents live here, and own the cantina. His mother had died about the same time he left to come here.\n\nThe whole town has heard of us by now, and some very unfriendly police arrest us for ostensibly landing without authorization.\n\nHadrian has fallen asleep in the water barrel. He wakes up, can't contact us, and assumes the worst. He rigs a grenade in the barrel to use as a distraction while he breaks into the cantina. While inside he assaults the barkeep and then flees when the police show up. He then takes a policeman hostage inside our ship.\n\nThe police chief just wants us gone at this point. Bisol explains why we are here, and he gives us a notarized affidavit saying the guy was in the town when the murders happened, and tries to get us to leave. Kara refuses to leave while still in binders and is left in the cell.\n\nBisol and Kadirra are taken to the ship, Hadrian is not happy when Kara is not with us. He attempts to stop his hostage from fleeing, Bisol goes to punch Hadrian in the face, and in the confusion the hostage escapes. Hadrian chases after him, and stuns both his hostage and the police chief with his blaster, but not before the chief stuns Kadirra. He then runs off to the police station.\n\nBisol drags Kadirra back into the ship, and seals the doors. He then breaks into the police comms to keep a track of Hadrian.\n\nHadrian is blasting his way through the town to get to Kara. He makes it all the way to her cell door before his luck runs out and he is trapped, slumped against the door. He is captured, stripped naked and bound. The chief wants us all gone. He drags both of them to the ship, where they find the doors locked, and the engines starting up.\n\nKadirra has a vision of both of them being shot in a field, and pleads with Bisol to let them in. Eventually he concedes, and lets them in, but seals them in their rooms.\n\nWhen he lands back at their office he has all the locks keeping the others contained burn out, and he proceeds to take all of the companies money (He was the registered CEO, since Kara and Hadrian had some enemies on the planet, and Kadirra has no ID at all), and grabs the first flight off the planet.\n\nAs far as Bisol was concerned, the last two months of his life were the worst he had ever experienced, and he blames Hadrian for most of it.",

        "text": "**The Setting**\n\nGolarion. If you are familiar with the Shin Megami Tensei series, we did that sort of thing. If you aren't familiar with it, then long story short: we could recruit monsters that we defeated and summon them to help us.\n\nI should also mention that we were playing this campaign over roll20.\n\n**The Players**\n\n* [Eyef](http://i.imgur.com/aeAAvgP.png), played by me (a guy). A spunky anime girl who gradually got more and more tsundere a the campaign went on. An Aasimar summoner. Crafted magical items for the entire party.\n\n* [Vertian](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/magicaldiary/images/7/77/Damien.png/revision/latest?cb=20110808211453), some sort of 3rd party class which pulled all sorts of BS stuff. I'm still not exactly sure how he got his AC that high. Played by a dude named Chris.\n\nOur party size fluctuated between 4 and 8. We were the only two characters to make it through the entire campaign, as the other characters either died or retired.\n\n**The story**\n\nSo our party started with the little stuff of going to kill these monsters, prevent this evil cult from summoning unspeakable horrors, etc. At first, Eyef and Vertian didn't get along well, since Vertian was rather crude, talking about fondling breasts and such. \n\nThen when we were off saving the world again, the BBEG came into the house where we were spending the night. After making it very clear that we couldn't face him yet, he sent us to our rooms so that he could talk with one PC in particular. Vertian and Eyef ended up in the same room, terrified, and they ended up cuddled in each others' arms. Thus began their relationship.\n\nChris and I both decided that while we were ok with RPing a relationship, we'd rather not get... intimate. Our campaign had a distinct anime theme, so we went with that. Eyef would totally deny having a crush on Vertian, yet she would dream about him confessing his love for her. In this campaign, we did most of the party's RP and plot progression in voice chat, but the players would often do more in-depth interactions with each other in text, using the /em command, which states your character's actions in a bright orange textbox. We started this way, but we decided to spare our party the lovey-dovey details (best described as an innocent junior high first girlfriend/boyfriend). So we used /w to whisper our messages to each other, then sent the whole conversation to our GM when we were done.\n\nAfter time traveling back to save the material plane, we encountered another foe: a god who was killing all of the other core deities and taking their powers for himself. We couldn't fight him, so naturally, we decided to become deities ourselves. Our GM had us face our biggest fears. None of us clawed out our eyes or became quivering piles of jelly, so we all passed. Eyef and Vertian's fears involved abandonment and betrayal by the other (among other things).\n\nWhen we stepped out of the Starstone Cathedral, I sent a message to Chris, along the lines of, \"Vertian, I'm the goddess of love now. I want you to take me as soon as possible.\"\n\nEveryone started laughing, and I realized that instead of using the /w to whisper, I had used /em. So I blurted this out in front of my entire party. \n\nNeedless to say, I got plenty of ribbing for this. Not for the subject matter--we had one other guy whose female character basically said, \"Hey, it's a scary world. Wanna have sex?\"--but just for the fact that I messed up so hard, in such an embarrassing way.\n\nAnyway, we ended up polymorphing the BBEG into a worm (mini story of that in the comments), and Eyef and Vertian became divine lovers.

        "text": "As the title says, tonight my players took my planned session and tore it to shreds, and I loved it!\nI love my gaming group, this was perhaps one of the best sessions I've had with this campaign.\n\nTo make things easier, I'll refer to people by their character names.\nOur cast of Characters, all at 7th level:\n- Aeryon, an elven Duskblade/Swashbuckler/Champion of Corellon\n\n- 'Nia', a half-aquatic elf Necromancer (NG- aligned, 'practical' not 'cackling' necromancy, generally)\n\n- Bleddyn, a halfling Ranger (bow specialist) with a half-winter wolf animal companion\n\n- Padraig, a human Rogue/Paladin/Shadowbane Inquisitor (who works for the monolithic 'totally not Catholic' church)\n\n- Rania, a human Cleric of Olidammarra/Bard\n\n- Kendra, a human Rogue/Cleric/Shadowbane Stalker (part of a Church-sponsored assassin team). This player had played briefly with us about 6 months ago, and joined in tonight on a whim.\n\n*Previously, on Wednesday Night gaming:*\nTo set the tale, I've been running a modified version of The Speaker in Dreams, one of my favourite published adventures. The PCs had 'saved' the Free City (a huge metropolis) from an alienist cult based in a second-hand bookstore, and the humans were rewarded with medals by the mayor. The nonhumans were given medals at the side of the stage (I described it being a lot like the medal ceremony from A New Hope).\n\nThen, that night, they were attacked by a professional assassin team. They barely lived, and identified the team as one of the Inquisition's strike teams. Confused, as they were working for the Church, they returned to the cathedral and demanded answers.\n\n*This is where tonight's session picks up.*\n\nPadraig, the Inquisitor, decided he needed more information, from someone he had worked with once (I discussed this with him as a hook to bring in Kendra). They tried to avoid notice by the Church, and Padraig removed his robes, dressing in simple adventurer's gear over his armour.\nHe set off across the city to the East Docks, looking for a filthy dive known as the Twisted Nipple. There, they avoided a big bar fight, and persuade Kendra that they needed her help.\nOn the way out the door, Padraig noticed a familiar face- an informant for the Church called Barnie, who was studiously avoiding eye contact, and tried to make a quick exit.\n\nPadraig siezed him by the collar, and demanded that Barnie take them to whoever had hired him. He led them out the door, and- SNEAK ATTACK! \n\nThe assassin on the roof opposite took his shot, nailing Padraig in the neck with a poisoned crossbow bolt, hitting for over 20 points of damage and pumping purple worm venom into the wound. The party split, half (including Padraig) going after Barnie, who promptly bolted like a scared rabbit, and half trying to chase the assassin, who ran away over the rooftops.\n\nBarnie was siezed quickly by Bleddyn's companion, a sizeable wolf named Eirwen, and held in place. The poison quickly dropped Padraig's strength, knocking him to the floor, and Nia tried what healing knowledge she had to save him (elevate the feet, decrease circulation, assume the recovery position).\n\nIn the meantime, the rest of the party caught up with the assassin, revealed to be Diaz, a stone-cold killer of legendary proportions (based on the Sick Mob Man from Boondock Saints). As they prepared to duke it out on the rooftops (which was my plan all along), Rania used a Fly spell to flank him, and then paralyzed him with a Hold Person spell, long enough for the others to swiftly manacle him and tie him securely with as many ropes as they could pool together.\n\nAs they brought him back to the rest of the group, all eyes were on the paralyzed assassin (with a gaze that told them \"every one of you who has seen my shame tonight will die horribly\"), and no-one noticed as a passerby executed poor Barnie with a boot-blade, and kept walking.\n\nThe PCs scraped up Padraig, grabbed Barnie's body, and then broke into a nearby abandoned warehouse to work out what to do. Kendra was able to tell the others that Diaz never worked alone, only with a partner named Cortez, just as wicked and bad as he was. They holed up, fortified the place, and prepared themselves for Nia to call back Barnie's spirit to interrogate him.\nIn the meantime, Padraig hammered pitons into the stone floor, and tied Diaz down, spread-eagled. They questioned him in a Zone of Truth, but the ruthless killer just glared at them, speaking only to tell them that they would all regret this night for the rest of their short lives.\n\nBleddyn and Kendra hid in the rafters, terrified of Cortez making his way in through the skylight or something. What they didn't expect was for Aeryon, having a quiet drink outside, to spot him walking with purpose towards the warehouse. He was decribed as having a grizzled face like Clint Eastwood, and wearing a long, cloaklike poncho. He carried a brutal and well-worn bastard sword at his waist, and strode to the door, telling Aeryon \"You need to move aside, friend.\"\n\nAeryon wisely chose to bang on the door, and yell \"Inquisitor, we have company!\" The door clanked open, and he stood in the doorway, facing down the entire party with one hand on the hilt of his sword.\n\nThey tried to negotiate, but he was having none of it. He was there to free his partner, and no amount of bribes could persuade him to just go away. He said, ominously, \"Inquisitor, no matter what happens tonight, your sister will ay the price.\"\nIt was only when Aeryon proposed a duel to decide what would happen that attention changed. He accepted, setting the terms as \"You, with all you're carrying, and me, with... all I'm carrying\". Even suspicious of his pause, Aeryon accepted, and threw the first blow, getting past Cortez' defenses for a wicked slash, and delivering a Ray of Enfeeblement.\n\nCortez snarled, and returned with a full-round attack, throwing a variety of blows and nearly halving Aeryon's hit points in one flurry. He stepped back, and paused. Aeryon pressed in, throwing a flurry as Nia laid down a Magic Circle against Evil, and Rania began singing a song to lift his spirits. He landed two blows, one delivering a Burning Hands effect and jetting fire into the swordsman, but he returned the favour, cutting Aeryon down to only a fraction of his strength, and then stepping back again.\n\nHe called a hold, saying \"I could do with some healing. You're welcome to partake, yourself\", and downed a potion, restoring some of his lost Strength. Aeryon gratefully swallowed a Cure Moderate Wounds potion, and then launched another attack. This time, he pressed past the assassin's defenses, delivering another pair of strikes which reduced him to (low-teens) hit points. Cortez drove his attack on, dropping Aeryon to the ground with his poisoned blade, and then pulling his last blow, refusing to slay his opponent. He declared a win, and thanked Aeryon for the fine sport.\n\nThen it all went bad... Bleddyn launched a pair of arrows into his chest, critically wounding him but failing to slay him. With a curse, he swirled his cloak and vanished (a Cape of the Mountebank enables its wearer to Dimension Door to safety once per day). Aeryon finally succumbed to the fours wounds filled with Deathblade poison, and breathed his last (his Constitution score dropped to -9).\n\nBleddyn, furious, gave the order to his wolf to kill the prisoner, which it did, messily. Padraig, aghast at losing his friend and his major lead in the space of a round, became frustrated.\n\nThen it wall went bad, again...\nNia said she could return Diaz' spirit to his body, so that it could be questioned (the player was working from an old 2e spell which no-one had worked out was out-of-date, which allowed a wizard to speak with the slain spirit, with a chance of accidentally freeing the spirit as an undead). As an Inquisitor, Padraig was horrified... but he needed a result. And he needed it fast, before Cortez healed up and decided to take out his frustrations on the rest of the party, without a front-line fighter to help them. He reluctantly agreed.\n\nNia cast the spell, slaying a sheep and bathing the body in its blood (which was when we all said \"where did this spell come from?\", but decidd to run with it as written anyway). She rolled up her sleeves and trouser legs, and stepped into the pool, speaking the words of the spell. I rolled my percentile dice, covering the numbers, and asked what the success chance was.\n\nA few moments of conference later, and \"62%\" was the reply. I checked my dice surreptitiously, and it was really hard to keep my poker face when I saw \"63\".\n\nI described the effect of the spell, as Diaz' flesh and organs liquefied, leaving only the unravelling intestines coiled around his gleaming bones, as it sat up and addressed her.\n\"You called me back?\"\n\nThe party quickly conferred, finding out that they could only ask two questions, and decided to throw weeks of careful planning on my behalf out the window.\n\"Who hired you?\" (Here, I was in a bind. The evil plot has been set in motion by Pontifex [=Cardinal] Ghaereth Axiom, but he has been engineering it to be blamed on the High Pontifex [=Pope] Simyous. But the spell says the dead speak the truth, so...)\n\"The Pontifex\" (Well, that left me a little wiggle room..)\n\"Which Pontifex?\"\n(Sigh) \"Axiom\". A collective gasp went up from the group, as Axiom has been championing the cause of the PCs against the seemingly ineffective (or is he possible EVIL) High Pontifex. They immediately realized it must have been part of the plot, and they head off into a huddle as the body sinks back into the bloody pool, to discuss what to do next.\n\nSo, no-one notices when the newly-created Mohrg creeps out from the pool, notices the variety and quantity of holy symbols in abundance, and makes its way silently out the window.\n\nAfter the discussion, Nia turns to \"give the dead proper rites\"... and notices the bony footprints in fresh blood tracking across the warehouse and to the window. More horror!\n\nThe group realizes they need to flee, urgently, before Cortez returns to find his partner murdered, and then turned into an undead. They gather Aeryon's belongings and flee to the walled-off Elven Quarter, where they take refuge, asking for help in returning Aeryon to life.\n\nThey took notice of a long-ongoing part of my campaign, that one of the gemstones he was carrying is now pulsing with energy, and seems to have stored his soul. The Elven elders allow the PCs to take part in a solemn and secret ritual that restores Aeryon's life (but only barely, due to the lost Constitution), and the rest of the night is spent in a haze, taking part in a party that the Champion of Corellon has been returned to life, commiserating their failure, worrying about the inquisitor's sister, worrying about the Pontifex who seems to want them dead, and about the undead murderer they unleashed on the city.\n\nIt looks like they may be considering splitting the party to deal with the sister and the Mohrg before reuniting to take on the Pontifex.\n\nFor a session that planned to go another direction, this was enormous fun. It seems to have left us all a little emotionally drained, and suddenly a throwaway pair of assassins have made an enormous mark on the campaign, likely living (or unliving...) on to plague the PCs for much longer than they were ever intended...\n\nSo, here ends tonight's tale.

        "text": "Long, and hopefully you'll forgive and spelling or grammatical errors. \n\nSo I'm fairly new to the whole tabletop rping and some buddies and I decided that we wanted to try it out. A couple of our friends are pretty experienced with DnD and specifically Pathfinder. So we've started an adventuring group and gotten through a couple simple tasks without too much of a problem.\n\nTo set the scene we were on board a pirate ship hunting some orc pirates that had been harassing some merchant ships. We also have two alternating DMs and the one running this home-brewed  campaign wanted to get his PC involved.\n\nOur group consists of the following:\n\nMe- Rogue Tasslehoff Quickhands (Halfing)  CG\nThe Bard Hork Half-Halfhands  (Half-orc) CN\nThe Paladin Barzul Stormhammer (Dwarf) LG\nThe Ranger Ellessar (Half-Elf) NG I think\nThe Sorcerer Finifear (Half-Elf) Says he is CG but more of a CN also undead.\n\nSo clearly our group is lacking in a \"standard healer\", especially when one of the members of our group can't be healed by our Paladin.\n\nWell shit goes south quickly. As expected in a sea battle a massive storm is brewing. Now as we catch sight of the enemy ship we notice that they appear to be slowing down and turning to have us broadsided. Well shit. We man the ballista and prepare to ram them. We brace, and as we are less than 50 feet away our DM mentions, with a sinister smile, that the orc ships appears to be plated with metal. CRUNCH! The front of our ship crashes into theirs orcs spill unto the ship as battle ensues. \n\nNow this had to have been some of the most frustrating shit as every other round a wave would crash into our slowly sinking ship constantly causing us to fall over even with relatively high reflex saves. Orcs and pirates are constantly falling overboard and our sorcerer gets knocked unconscious and into the water. By a sheer miracle of fortitude save rolls he doesn't drown, and actually drowned an orc that was floating nearby (his only confirmed kill up to that point). Now the rest of us eventually fight our way to the rescue boat and managed pull him into our little skiff.\n\nWe tried to perform CPR to get the water out of his lungs so we could force feed him a health pot. But the dice rolls were non-existent. It's looking grim and our DM is starting to have him fade away when all of a sudden the dwarf pipes in: \n\n\"I pull down his pants\". Silence. \n\n\"What?!\"\n  \n\"Tas, give me a health potion I'm gonna make him buttchug it\"\n\nThe DM and Ranger just start laughing uncontrollably. DM says he doesn't know if it will work, but we convinced him it would be absorbed more immediately into his bloodstream since it didn't have to be filtered. \n\nSeeing no other options we poured the sweet nectar of life down our buddy's cornhole. I rolled a perfect 8 to restore him back to full health. He ended be useless the rest of the fight since he didn't have the strength to climb the ship, so he just summoned a dolphin to keep him company. We survived the fight, and now control a pirate ship, but the greater takeaway is that potion enemas might be the only way we'll heal our under companion for the rest of the game.\n\nTL;DR Made an unconscious undead sorcerer butt-chug to save his life, still remained useless.

        "text": "Breakfast was quiet this morning. As the sun crept higher over the horizon, dispelling the pre-dawn, Angelo and Jessica prepared breakfast. Nothing elaborate, some eggs seasoned with the last of the herbs Angelo had picked up in the last town, and bread with fresh jelly, courtesy of a berry bush Yangus had spotted. It was nowhere near the quality of the Prince's usual meals, a fact that he didn't let the party forget, nor did it stop him from eating his and Trode's share; he would've gone for Yangus' plate as well, had Yangus not finished it himself.\n\nAfter the dishes were done and camp broken (during both chores Prince Charmles was noticeably absent), the party made its way to the lair of the Great Argon, the reason they were escorting the young Prince to begin with. It wasn't very tall, but it was deep, and the floor was littered with the bones of various small creatures. Deep, reverberating growls echoed from deeper in the chamber.\n\nNo sooner had Eight lit his torch than Charmles snatched it right from him. \"Do you *want* me to trip and perhaps break my neck in this rotten cave?!\" he snapped. \"I swear, you're all as useless as that stupid horse!\" he spat as he walked off into the cave, shouting. \"ARGON, WHERE ARE YOU?! COME OUT WHEREVER YOU ARE, SO THAT I MAY CUT OUT YOUR HEART!!!\"\n\n\"Milord, I advise discretion,\" suggested Angelo; he'd been the only one who Charmles actually heeded, but whatever spell he had the Prince under had broken, for Charmles had run off ahead, his dagger gleaming in the torchlight.\n\n\"So wot're we to do now?\" asked Yangus. \"I say we leave the royal brat 'ere an' let 'im try to bully the Argon into not eatin' 'im.\"\n\n\"Yangus, how could you be so cruel?\" chided Jessica.\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Angelo, \"eating so unsavory a meal as *that* is a fate I'd not even wish on my dear brother.\"\n\n\"That isn't what I meant,\" growled Jessica, wringing her magic staff in her hands. \"His Majesty the King is a friend to Trode, is he not? As much as it irks me to have that loathsome little troll around, he *is* the King's son.\n\n\"Aye, and we *did* agree to keep an eye on 'im,\" conceded Yangus. \"Awright, le's go fetch the cocky li'l tosser.\"\n\nAnd so the four trekked further into the cave; Eight at the head, followed by Yangus, Jessica, and Angelo, off to find the hapless Prince Charmles. And find him they did, treed by the very beast he had sworn to slay. His beady eyes glinted with tears of joy at the sight of his saviors.\n\n\"Oh, thank heavens! You there, oaf!\" he shouted, pointing a sausage-like finger at Yangus, \"Protect your king!\"\n\n\"I'm from Pickham, mate,\" scoffed Yangus. \"Pickham ain't got no royalty. Protect y'self.\"\n\nBut Yangus' tune changed at the sight of Jessica's face, her eyes smouldering, her hands ablaze with fire, and he joined her, Angelo, and Eight in combat against the beast.\n\nThe Great Argon was huge, bigger than the rest of its ilk by a good ten feet. Its finlike ears spread out, casting an imperious shadow over the party, and it let loose a roar that knocked everyone on their feet in shock. It swung its tail in their direction, only for Yangus to bat it aside with his club. Angelo and Jessica set to work casting their spells, Angelo with his words and Jessica with her wand. Eight, meanwhile, focused his sight on the Argon, scanning it for any potential chinks in its carapace.\n\n\"Guv!\" shouted Yangus, \"Don't just stand there gobsmacked, *do something*!\"\n\nEight sprung into action then. His blade let out an almost-inaudible shriek as it whistled through the air and carved the Argon wide open, from shoulder to hip. The beast tottered for a moment, let out a weak little growl, then fell over, dead. Not saying a word, Eight walked over to it and reached into its wound, plucking out a large reddish jewel.\n\n\"Oh! The Argon Heart!\" cried Charmles, and he dropped from the tree he was in and ran over to Eight, grabbing the jewel and knocking Eight on his rear. \"It's mine, it's mine, all mine! With this, Father will *surely* recognize me as the rightful heir to the throne!\" he laughed.\n\n\"Heir to the throne, was it?\" scoffed Yangus. \"Lofty goals there, Prince Charmless.\"\n\n\"For the last time, you insufferable dullard, it's pronounced \"Sharm-*lay*!\"\n\n\"I know wot I said,\" growled Yangus, thumbing the clasp on his back where he kept his axe. Eight, Angelo, and Jessica all shrugged and shook their heads. Their job wasn't done yet...",

        "text": "*This is a continuation of my previous tale, which involved dropping turds upon doorsteps. Link in the comments, thanks to the mighty powers of /u/telltalebot*\n\nOur tale begins 8 days prior to where we last left off, which also happens to be 4 days after the party left the dungeon. Autono-Thomas boots back up, only to find the bodies of two giant creatures decomposing in front of him, and his newly acquainted allies nowhere to be found. After some wandering around, he finds a blood-covered sword stuck in the ground. Upon his touch, the sword activates, pointing itself towards him. After almost dying in an attempt to tame the blade, Thomas destroys it, keeping the still-intact hilt, in hopes that he will be able to forge a new blade and have a living sword as an ally. He makes his way to the nearest city in a mere 4 days of travel (compared to the party's 10 days of travel), and begins to study metalworking, as well as trying to find all of the information he can living swords. He does this for the next three days, plus a fourth (the day of the party's arrival, although neither notice each other.)\n\nBack to the rest of the party, they wake up to a knock at the door. A homonculus calls out for \"Master Alonzo and his esteemed guest\" to come to the urgent meeting. Kaizar and Rupert agree to go, with Kaziar telling his fellows to take everything valuable from the room while they are at the meeting. He leads them down the hall from their room, and pushes a loose brick in the wall, revealing a large circular ampitheater/stadium, with the seats set up into the four quadrants the rest of the city is split into; the Scholar's, Miner's, Hunter's, and Crafter's Guilds. (Kaizar and Rupert are involved with the scholar's guild.) They sit down in an empty space, and notice something about the nobility; they are a very diverse group. Elves, humans, dwarves, halflings, the whole lot, whereas the rest of the city is composed mainly of halflings, and a large albino-skinned people. The two are seated next to a very excited halfling, who is very eager to state his excitement about what goes on at meetings, although, much to his chagrin, he cannot see over everyone. It is then that Rupert lifts the small man into his lap, careful not to crush trusty Gustab, who is relaxing within the comfort of Rupert's beard.\n\nThe ceremony was anything other than civilized. One of the large white figures steps forward, Dressed very properly. \"My fellows,\" he proclaimed as he reached out with his arms, \"you may have noticed that, for the past two weeks, one of our Sages has been missing.\" He gestures behind him, to three men standing in a line, with a space inbetween them. One is a man Rupert and Kaizar had sold staves to; an elf man with a sapphire for an eye. Next to him, a halfling man covered in soot, who has an emerald for an eye. Lastly, a human with large, thick gloves, and goggles strapped to his forehead; his eye is one of pure diamond.\n\"It is time to coronate a new sage, a new Ruby of the South.\"\nA very familiar halfling steps forward from the Hunter's Guild seating; he is covered in tribal tattoos, and wearing a dragon-scale headdress. he steps before the speaker, and kneels down. The orator begins speaking in a mysterious, ancient tongue, as he takes an ornate dagger through the man's right eye. He twists and turns within the socket, letting blood flow down the man's face. He then pulls out his blade, and sticks it into the halfling's heart. He leaves it there, as he reaches into a small satchel, pulling out a small ruby. he holds it under the dripping blood, still chanting in his dead language, then sticks it into the hunter's eye.immediately, he stops speaking, and the man stops bleeding. He pulls out the dagger, the now open wound to the heart neither bleeding, nor closing. The man simply stands up, and assumes his position amongst the other three.\n\"Thank you, my fellows. You may return to your rooms.\"\n\nDuring this time, Dyraga, Remryn, and Carolus all gather armfuls of objects from the room, and take them outside, leaving unnoticed in the hubbub of the noblemen all coming out of the meeting. As they head out and into the marketplace, they notice nearly everyone is gone, the stalls empty. The only other people there are a large amount of miners, standing all around the large round entrance down to the mines, with ropes in hand. There is one man standing atop the building, clearly another miner. He is giving a speech, quite clearly to his fellows, as noone else is around. \"WE WILL NOT BE TREATED IN THIS WAY! NO LONGER WILL WE DIE IN THE MINES, FORGOTTEN AND ALONE! NO, NOW WE DIE HERE, THE BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS!\" The miners throw their ropes up, and tie them into nooses. They all jump off the small ledge they stand upon, and are left lifeless and limping, blood dripping from their mouths. It is at this time that they hear powerful gusts of wind, and feel the city soaring upwards. All of the men outside (the three who just left, but also including Autono-Thomas, and Ambros, the recently awakened drunkard) attempt to stand their ground, and all succeed . . . aside from Carolus, who falls over, rolling around the city, and loses all of his precious stolen goods.\n\nAnd that is where I will cut this tale. This is only half of our last session, but we are not playing next week, so I will post the rest of the Bathtub Saga then.\n\nEDIT 1: Forgot a minor detail about a suicide cult.\nEDIT 2: \"Relazing\" is not a word.",

        "text": "Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to recant the tale of my epic battle with the boss Cernunnos of .Hack G.U. VOl.1 Rebirth.\n\nFirst, the preparations. I had bought a buttload of attack items, debuff items, and healing items. Haseo was one of the two party members who knew healing magic (the other being Atoli, but I didn't use her for this fight). My party members were capped, except for Kuhn, who was level forty-something. I had bought the best weapons for each of my party members. So, I was confident that this wouldn't be longer than a couple of minutes.\n\nYeah. Sure.\n\nSo, we go into the fight. My usual tactics, I have Kuhn sit at the back and pepper Cerunnos with his attacks. I have Haseo spam Lei Zas, restoring his MP whenever I need to. I use my buffing items on Pi since she's my close-quarters fighter for the time being. Cerunnos' HP is mind-numbingly high, so it doesn't look like I'm doing much damage. When I finally run out of my weak MP potions, I decide to put Haseo on the front lines with Pi. That's when  Cerunnos used the attack where it creates a shadow pit that deals out some nasty status effect combos. Slow, Poison, Blind, you name it. And that's not counting its physical force. Five hits was enough to bring Pi down to half of her HP when she was buffed. Ouch. I finally get Cerunnos down to two thirds of health. I pause the game and go get some soda and two double-decker cheese sandwiches. I come back and continue the fight. Cerunnos manages to critical hit Pi before I can heal her, so I use a full revive item on her instead. He Critical Hits her again, one-shotting her. I have to use my last Revive and pray that no one else dies.\n\nThe fight progresses as I expected, until Cerunnos is down to his last 10% of health. At this point, I have Kuhn in the front as well, and the three of us are wailing on him. I've used up all of my attack items, all of my buff items, and all of my MP items. My team is at half health, give or take a couple points, and Cerunnos manages to land an AoE attack on all three of us at once, bringing us down to about 5% health. So, I use my last group heal item, and my last three hp items to bring the three of us back to full health. Somehow we manage to get Rengeki, and that's how we win the fight. Cue me whooping like a madman and laughing. The total fight took me about 70 minutes. Those were the best 70 minutes of my life.",

Well this gets me into arguements with the rouge/cleric (loust) in the group. Well it so happens as we are looting this mansion we come across a monocle,watch, and brass knuckles. The rogue immediately takes the watch and monocle after i said id like the watch. We get into an argument which ends with it in his pocket. \n    I pick up the knuckles as he makes a smart remark. Now everything weve found so far in this mansion is a magical item of some degree. Being a barbarian i cant discern magic and decide im going to punch him with this brass knuckle. I fail hit the wall, we hear gear noises, and my hand is stuck in the wall. My hand seems to be encased in a gauntlet of brass thats stuck in the wall.\n                              Loust decides to hold up a rubber knife to my throat and say \"Friends dont punch friends with magical items, do it again and ill cut your throat with a real knife.\" And that seems to be the end of me getting the watch.

He looked at the watch while open and saw an eye looking at him. This mansion was filled with many demon artifacts and the watch had the same symbol as my demon book had on it. After many questions to a baelor trapped in a harp and the friendly alchemist we find out that loust has been marked by a devil since he looked at the watch with the monocle. Anyone marked has a gruesome death and cant avoid it.  He alone finds out he can give the watch to someone, can have them look at it with the monocle, take the monocle back, and hes free. So he decides to ask Tannaruk to trade for it, not remembering he told us it was a horrible curses object, and thus i said no. \n          Long story short he now regrets not letting the barbarian have the damn watch.",

Or something similar. The party is accosted at their home base by an unfortunate dude who has been mind-controlled into delivering a message! The message is for Fishnaut, and the message is that his old masters (those wonderful creatures, [the aboleths](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/aberrations/aboleth)) are very aware of where he is and hate his various fishy internal organs. Fishnaut shares the sentiment.\n\nSo motivated, Fishnaut sweet-talks the party into going on PERSONAL BACKSTORY QUEST (the speech went a bit like \"I hate these guys, we're going to kill them\"). The party agreed to come on the basis that there would be violence, loot, and a fuzzy self-righteous feeling. The trifecta of adventuring! The party geared up for UNDERWATER VIOLENCE and set off.\n\nOn the way, Fishnaut got into a heated argument with some magical sprites that had taken to living in his head. You see, despite the fact that they were generally friendly and had saved Fishnaut's life, they were still dicking around in Fishnaut's brain and that shit just wouldn't fly- he kind of had a thing about mind control. The sprites were given the boot, into a magical staff that would house the little buggers until they were needed.\n\nJourneys happened! Tearful reunions with old friends, random encounters, MYSTERIOUS HAPPENINGS and EPIC FORESHADOWING all took place, but none of that was interesting so the party arrived safe and sound at Fishanut's home river. To put it mildly, the place had seen better days.\n\nUpon entering the water, Fishnaut immediately spotted another gillman, who screamed a warning before his eyes erupted with green flames. Roll for initiative!\n\nThus, Fishnaut and company were forced to assault the villagers in self-defense. Only three ever attacked at once, and whenever one would go down, another gillman's eyes burst into flame and the battle would begin anew. Thankfully, the gillmen were not particularly combat-savvy, and the most deadly weapons they brandished were an end table and a trowel. Fishnaut MAGIC'D some folks, Rose bonked some heads, Barrel encased several people's heads in alchemist's ice, Thoth ran interference, and Pratena SHORYUKEN'D a dude so hard he flew out of the river.\n\nTown pacified, they stepped over to the lip of a large chasm that went down several miles... apparently this river was connected to some DEEP waterways. Fishnaut heard a sinister voice in his head, which was... asking for help? What?\n\nAt about that point, the second aboleth, all three eyes gushing green flames, emerged in a flurry of pained sobs, enraged screams, and incoherent babbling. And magic missiles. Don't forget the magic missiles.\n\nThis was about seventeen different kinds of fucked. The magical sprites (the ones hiding in the staff) started panicking and screaming something about \"manaburned\"- one thing was clear, though, this aboleth had to *die*. The party set to it with great vigor. Rose was enchanted with some magic that kept her from sinking, Pratena moved to flank, and generally unpleasant things happened to the crazed fish.\n\nMore unpleasant things shortly after happened to the party. The aboleth went invisible and swam off, leaving an illusion that exploded immediately after it was attacked. BASTARD. The damn thing played a merry game of hit-and-run, firing off powerful spells and turning invisible every damn turn. It would have been brutal, if it weren't for the fact that it kept CRIT FAILING ITS GODDAMNED STEALTH ROLL. The thing was so impossibly unstealthy that it should have been wearing a neon sign proclaiming \"I am right here, please stab me a lot while I waste my spell slots\".\n\nIt wasn't a free lunch, though. The aboleth was still triple-wielding some charred staves and could hurl a mean lightning bolt, and naturally it called plenty of mind-controlled minions. Oh, and the aboleth dispelled Rose's non-sinking enchantments right above the miles-deep chasm. Fun times. (She was fine, Fishnaut conjured a ball of ice for her to ride on)\n\nAfter a few false starts, the party set about whaling on the crazy fish, disarming it of the three charred staves that were apparently the source of its power. Pratena punched one out of the aboleth's grasp, Barrel fielded it, aimed, and then shanked it with his kukri. The staff exploded with magical energy, blasting the screaming aboleth all the way out of the river. Barrel was luckier, but not by much.\n\nWith that, the party closed in on the beached aboleth before it could do anything nefarious, with Thoth doing magic-stabby things and Fishnaut speared it through the head with an ice spike. The green eye-flames died down and it stopped moving. Victory!\n\nThere was still one more issue, though. See, there were two aboleths- the one that had gone batshit insane, and the other one who had been hiding. It emerged to thank the party for its assistance and-\n\nFishnaut snared it with black tentacles and struck it with lightning so hard that it immediately became 4000 lbs of wonderful seafood dinner. Aboleths are mind-rapey bastards, and Pratena was going to eat well tonight!\n\nThat done, the magical sprites in Fishnaut's staff said some stuff about \"lingering contamination\" and \"it was infected anyway\". Nobody really felt sorry for the aboleth, as it was a massive dick. What was more worrying was that THE CRAZED ONE WAS STILL ALIVE WHOOPS. It grabbed at Fishnaut's staff, trying with all its strength to break it in half and kill the sprites inside of it. The party put the kibosh on that REAL quick, and took no chances on a repeat performance.\n\nWith that, exposition was in order. It turned out that the aboleths had magically stolen the staffs wielded by the dryads in a fight long ago, and that the magical sprites that had been helping out the party were in fact the same species as the things that had briefly made Fishnaut sick and the aboleth fucking insane. The benevolent sprites had conveniently prevented anyone in the party from getting infected, though, so that was nice, but the entire area was thick with the malevolent little bastards now and SOMEONE was going to have to clean it up before another spellcaster went off his nut.\n\nOn that note, Fishnaut removed his helmet and tearfully bade the party a fond farewell- he had liberated his people, and now he was going to stay behind and rebuild. Everyone agreed that this was an okay outcome, wished Fishnaut luck, and headed home... 8,000 pounds of freshly-cooked seafood in tow. It was a good day.\n\n[NEXT TIME ON \"Sweet 13\", PRATENA GROWS A SIZE CATEGORY AND TURN UP THE MUSIC!](http://redd.it/2y5vbe)",

        "text": "[A brief tale from my campaign!](http://redd.it/2vbty4) Now then, as many know, skellingtubs are the spoopiest. All dem bones. So spoopy, in fact, that Rose (the party tank) was absolutely terrified of them because of backstory reasons. Which is why it was a bit distressing when the group found what looked like a mummy in their basement elevator.\n\nThe party did a quick rendition of the scooby gang (complete with Rose, the fullplate dullahan, jumping into her twelve-year-old friend's freakishly strong arms), trembling in fear and apprehension as the mummy... fumbled with the elevator controls while cursing about \"all this goddamn new tech business\". Wait, what?\n\nYes, it turns out this mummy was indeed a person! Well, technically all mummies are people, but this one was the sort who says \"how do you do\" instead of \"MUUUUURGH\". And he was also the honest-to-gods sort of mummy, sealed in an ancient egyptish tomb that had recently been portal-cut by [the party's big relocation](http://redd.it/2ue20h). To put it simply, they were on his lawn. Thankfully, the mummy was not terribly interested in the whole haunting business, having a new lease on life and wondering just what he could do with it.\n\n[So enters Thoth, the shabti magus!](http://i.imgur.com/VVTk1Mf.png) A genuine pharaoh, if his garb was anything to go by. He apparently died long ago, but his soul was bound to an intricate flesh-golem that nearly perfectly replicated a human body. Basically, he was the rich man's dullahan. He also packed a dinky sword and some interesting arcane powers!\n\nThe group celebrated a new party member by going on a shopping spree, bringing some other friends from their organization along with them. What, did I not mention that? Because the party worked for a kind of pseudo-mercenary group, and there were quite a few other teams. Not all of them were particularly social, but one seemed to get along quite well- another group of four.\n\nThis group contained people like Sissy the half-elven barbarian, the murdermachine with self-confidence issues and a teddy bear, and his merry fellows- Corgi, Reginald, and Cap'n. Corgi was a paladin (with some homebrewed stuff), who also happened to be a Fey Corgi. She was an honest soul, devoted to protecting the weak and stealing the socks of the wicked. Reginald was a pinnacle of british manliness, and had joined the group for the joy of big game hunting and showing off his brilliant mustache. Cap'n was the oddball- a shapeshifting swashbuckler with a cruel streak and an affinity for sea life. That said, they all got along well enough.\n\nThe other group of four was, of course, a set of backup characters for the players. If anything happened to a party member, events would continue from the perspective of the backup characters. If anyone was seriously injured, or if they could sweet-talk the DM into allowing it, party members could be switched so that people with relevant skills could attend missions where they were needed. It was a bit like being in an actual mercenary group. In fact, the idea had even been tested- during the [Politicking mission](http://redd.it/2vbty4), Pratena (the punchiest twelve-year-old there ever was) have been swapped out for Corgi because of an injury that would take a few weeks to heal.\n\nIt's quite the positive work environment, especially with all the insults, violence, and occasional sexual harassment- and anyone who thinks otherwise is free to file a complaint with Partyboss's \"kindling\" department.",

        "text": "[When we last left our party they were tied to foul smelling chairs in a bright room and surrounded by angry people all pointing crossbows at them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2vxudx/dd_35ishthe_quest_for_the_emerald_lake_pt2/)\n\nThey struggle with their bonds but are unable to break them. “Stop your struggling or well shoot the lot of ya” a voice from the middle says as the crowd starts to part for said voice. “Now who are you and why you be asking about them vamps” The obvious leader asks. Seeing no other option the party explains the entire quest, the dead lady, the party leaving, the mirror, and just about anything else they can think of. With a laugh the leader replies” That old broad? I remember her I think that was one of my finest works yet!  Well seeing as you’re not vamps or you’d be dead by now I might as well ‘enlist’ your help. You see my clan has been around longer than most humans, we first banded together to hunt the ancient threat of vamps and to prevent others from even knowing they exist.” At this the party interrupts him and asks “why not just expose the threat and mount up a full offensive with an army?” The leader bursts out laughing, “You know what will happen if the world knows vamps exist? Some angsty youngins will go off to their nearest vamp lair and become one just to spite his parents. Or some lass will think a vampire would be a great lay and next thing you know she’s popping out little vamp babies.” The leader gets serious once more and continues, “No it is better if the world does not know that vamps exist, and that is where you lot come in. Now see our scouts have learned where the lair of the vamp lord lives, and you guys are going help us kill him. Now if you don’t want to I understand completely and it’s nothing personal but I’m going have to kill you if you decline. You know the deal with the whole secret clan of vamp fighters it only works if it is actually secret. So what will it be, kill some filthy vamps or die here?”\n\nNow not given much of a choice the party agrees to help the hunters. “Great, ill see you in the morning then.” The leader replies with a wave of his hand as he turns away. Immediately the party is seized and carried to the dungeons. They sit there really not doing anything they think of a few ways they could try to escape, test the bars, and call for the guards to check response time and positions. However they ultimately decide not to go ahead with the escape due to not knowing fully the numbers, layout, or arsenal their captors have and ultimately decide to go to sleep and help the hunters.\n\nThe next morning the party is woken up and given their gear back before they are blindfolded. They are then led to the lair. When the blindfold is taken off they seem to be at an entirely normal nondescript rock. With a smile the leader waves and from the back of the group of hunters gathered a vamp wrapped from head to toe in chains is brought forward. The vampire has obviously been starved and tortured and is soon forced next to the rock. The leader of the hunters takes his sword and slices it across the vampire’s neck beheading him and spraying his blood all over the rock in front of him. After a few seconds suddenly the rock reveals a wide stone staircase leading downward. “Well come on men! What are we waiting for let’s go!” The leader cries before leading a charge of all his men with the party being pressed by the large hoard of men behind them down the stairs.\n\n The party doesn’t even have time to admire the interior of the cave; it was like a castle if instead of being built upwards they were built downwards.  Almost instantly the vampires are on them and half their numbers are dead before everyone is even down the stairs and the alarm has been raised. The ensuing battle was way too tough for the party and if not for the vampire hunters they’d’ve been dead in an instant. As it was they were fighting for their lives and very slowly gaining ground fighting for every inch and every floor. As they were clearing out a set of 3 rooms on the 4th floor the rouge takes a nasty sword wound to his chest and when I say nasty I mean if it wasn’t for his ribcage his heart would be cut in half kind of nasty. The party decides to leave him with a healer and continue on clearing the rooms. It was in the third room when the wizard gets a brilliant idea, “Try to take one alive friends” he cries to the party. With a bit of a struggle they manage to knock the last one out with the help of a very nice china set and the cabinet it was stored in. At this point the rouge hobbles back in and is quickly told to hide the body and guard it till they get back. With a bit of complaining due to the fact that he was just nearly cut in half and now he has to go hide a body and guard it he eventually agrees and begins dragging it looking for a good place to lay low, grumbling about his wound the entire time. The rest of the party regroups with the vampire leader and six of his remaining warriors, the rest had been ordered to fall back, as they prepared to head down to the 5th and final floor. There they confront the evil vampire Lord Trienyfer.\n\nIt is an epic battle where no man escapes unscathed. With the last whisper of his guard protecting him the Lord Trienyfer nearly won that day. The party was on their last leg, half the hunters had been killed, and there were still two more guards and Trienyfer himself still do deal with. As it seemed all would be lost the ranger managed to get an amazing shot as he lay on the ground with a broken leg piercing one of the two guards in the heart with a stake he’d hastily tied to one of his arrows. With renewed moral and courage the mighty warrior with his good arm cut to the bone gave one more swing of his mighty axe and managed to mortally wound the last guard and put him out of the fight, before he collapsed to the ground from blood loss. With a cry of despair at seeing his men fall around him, with the party of adventurers he’d forced to be here, all wounded and dying. He charged towards Trienyfer and he had to have known it was a suicide charge when he did for before he could even reach the Vampire lord he was delt a fatal wound.  As the light was slowly fading from his eyes he mutters his last words “Stupid vamp, *cough cough* you think you have won well your wrong.  Sunlight never fades!” With these last words he lunges at the lord and stabs him in the stomach just as his sword begins to glow.  The sword began getting brighter and brighter till it soon matched the heat and intensity of the summer sun. The vampire Lord Trienyfer along with the sword was nothing but ash within a minute.\n\nThe remaining three hunters get to work healing up the party and with one final glance back they take their dead and are on their way.\nThe party goes to find the rouge and tell him the events that transpired.  They eventually locate him and the vampire inside a pantry and waste no time in filling him in. As for the vampire, they prop him up slap him around a bit till he wakes up. They decide to question him about the emerald lake and what he knows of it, and if he tells them they’ll let him go. Now seeing as they slaughtered his lord, his family, his friends, and just about everything else he cares about he’s having none of this. However after a little “persuasion” he eventually decides to talk. “The lake that glistens of emerald can be found in a cave at the far east of this ancient land. However this is no simple task the cave is guarded by unseen barriers that require the five great shards of olden onyx to bypass them. And if you get past a barrier it is said you will have to face a guardian far worse than anything you could possibly imagine.”\n\nI think I’ll end part 3 with those words.\n",

        "text": "Well dear friends and new readers it's time for part 8 in the Belin series. As with the previous posts I'll link the last one and you can follow them until you find the 4th. I believe links to the first 3 are there. Please enjoy and keep letting me know what you guys think. I love to read the comments and inbox messages. You guys have been great and really encouraged me to post more and more. I hope you guys know I keep you in mind while we play. I want to continue doing things that impress.\n\nPart 7:https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2vn080/dd_355e_mix_the_tale_of_belin_the_giant_slayer/\n\nI also want to say sorry for the long wait. Weather has been terrible in the US with all the snow and such. Internet has been off and on and such. Sadly as many of you know real life is always messing with things. I would also like to apologize if I don't have my usual chipper and happy writing style. I will make a serious attempt but today has been a very bittersweet day for me. I've never had much luck and today was the first time I've ever won a drawing/contest. I won a copy of Majora's Mask for the 3DS. I couldn't have been happier. Sadly I received a message informing me that because I didn't have 150 comment karma, my entry had been rejected. I somehow missed it in the sub rules. So a guy who gave the same answer 3 hours later won instead. Sad day indeed. All I could do was thank the OP for the kindness to do a giveaway and apologize for my mistake. Doubt I'll ever forget my first contest win.\n\nAnyway away from all that sadness and back to the good stuff lol.\n\nWhen we last left our hero he was in the woods using a large sized greatclub to knock down trees with ease. Deciding to take a break Belin headed back into town to see what the rest of the party was up to. However, upon arriving in town he found a familiar face. The priest who had sent the party to reclaim the fallen temple of Pelor was now laying on the ground bleeding out. Belin rushed to attend to the priest. Quickly he took him to the temple. There he found the cleric and they healed him as best they could. The priest explained that the temple was under attack again but he wasn't sure by what this time. He said they would come in the night and slaughter anyone that dared be around the temple. He said he was the only one of the priests to survive. He soon passed out and the party was now in discussion. Belin told the party that regardless of their feelings, we'd all be going. He made sure to tell the cleric to pray to Pelor and warn him. Saying \"If he brings that bright light bitch around here again, I'll put it's light out for good and his too if he isn't careful.\" While the rest of the party laughs at his hilarious threat the cleric doesn't. She's seen too much at this point to doubt him. (or so the player says lol)\n\nWhile the party is getting ready Belin takes the time to visit his bestest pal, his raptor mount, newly named Talon. Belin decides not to take him this time, but after some affectionate petting and feeding, the party is ready to go. We head out on our journey. Along the way the dragonborn seeks Belin's approval and say's he'll do the hunting this time and let the party rest. Tells the DM he's hunting bear. Sadly he found 2. After a serious whuppin he calls for help and Belin seems to be the only one to hear. Belin stands up and walks out of the camp, saying only \"Bathroom.\" Once free of the party's eyesight he takes off sprinting towards the cry. He arrives and the two kill both bears. Belin tells the dragonborn that no one else heard and that he'll not mention his hand in the kills. He tells the dragonborn that his price for silence is that the dragonborn has to wait for a while before bringing the bear bodies back to camp. Also that he must drag both back by himself. Belin makes his way to a stream and washes up. When he arrives back to camp the halfling looks at him wide eyed. \"You were gone forever. I thought you died.\" Belin shrugged \"I came close. Big Pooh. Two of them.\" At this point the players catch the pun and laugh but their characters all seem grossed out. After many failed strength checks to drag two huge dead bears, the dragonborn finally makes his way back into camp. \"Look! He got one more than Belin!\" Shouted the halfling. Belin just shrugged again and told the dragonborn good job. He skinned them and bagged the pelts. The party ate good and prepped what they could to take when they leave.\n\nAs morning came the party headed back out. Finally they arrived at the temple at about midday. It was covered in scratch marks and broken up on the outside. The party entered and set up post in preparation for the night. Belin sets up as guard at the door. He leaves it cracked so he can better hear any noises outside. As the night rolls in Belin begins to hear scratching noises on the roof and figures the enemy is approaching. Quickly but silently Belin wakes the party. He quietly sneaks outside to catch a peek. The figures appear to be humans with rat heads. Belin doesn't really know how to identify this creature. He goes inside and whispers to the party what he saw. Apparently the halfling is scared of rats and climbs in Belin's backpack with his crossbow ready. Like the first time that Red Foreman said \"dumb-ass\" you could hear a heavenly chorus. This would later become a all the time thing. Now the party is ready. Time for combat.\n\nBelin runs out and throws huge rocks at the figures until they come down to fight. These as it turns out are Wererats. The Drow identifies them. They all have bone daggers with strange shaped sheathes. As they pull out the blade blood drips from them. The Drow tells us that if we get infected with the blood that we could become one. (Chaotic good barbarian does not want to be lawful evil rat. especially cause our DM keeps the \"no chaotic, no barbarian levels\" rule.) I would later find out that this was the DM's goal to level the playing field cause he feared that Belin was too strong. It was a long encounter with a lot wererats... all rogues. Thankfully the halfling in the backpack kept Belin from being flanked. The rest weren't so lucky. Best part was the halfling popping out and shooting a wererat in the face. He got sneak attack and scared the rat at the same time. At the end of the combat all the rats were dead but Belin had been cut many times. So had the drow. Belin noticed that during the fight the little silver sword the halfling had got seemed to scare the rats. At this time he was informed that werebeasts are weak to silver by the drow. He noted this for later.\n\nThe party decides to sleep in the temple to see if more things show up in the next nights. Nothing does but they wait anyway. The first night Belin has nightmares and wakes up naked outside. The night after he wakes up naked outside of the closest town. He starts to freak out and it turns out both him and the drow were infected. They were both turning at night. We go to a healer and get a herb. Basically you take it and spend an hour resting. So Belin takes the herb and it doesn't work the first time and he changes that night too. Finally he takes it again and gets rid of the rat inside him. Thankfully he resisted all effects on his alignment. However, he was shaken from the events that had taken place. Never before had he been robbed of his willpower and self control. He vowed that it would never happen again. From that day forward he would have vengeance on all manner of werebeasts. He decided anytime he would hear of werebeasts hurting people or other evil deeds he would seek them out and destroy them with no second thoughts. He would use all of his skills to craft a weapon dangerous enough to kill them all. He would also continue to go into the woods and use the greatclub to get stronger. (I'm not sure what I hoped would come out of this for Belin but I was surpised.) Our DM granted Belin the ability to use large sized weapons with no penalty. A gift for surviving his trap and for rping.\n\nAs Belin felt his training begin to take effect he decided he was ready. With newly formed muscles he would wield a weapon befitting his purpose. Using much of his gold, he gather supplies and locked himself away in his forge. The party would not see him or hear of him for days. The cleric at one point worried about him and brought food. He answered the door with his hair in a mess and covered in a sweat/smoke mix. Goggles down on his face instead of on his head. She described him as crazed. He took the food and closed the door. Not a word was said. Now for a little side story. Our DM loves to throw in little magic items, that he thinks up, that don't do anything but can be sold. This way we get something nifty to sell instead of the same old same old. During our fight with the Giant we had found some loot and a item that seemed cursed. No one wanted it so Belin took it. It was a demonic looking skull with large rubies for eyes. They appeared to constantly bleed. However you could run your hand thru the blood and pull your hand back clean. It was like ghostly blood or an illusion. We later found out that the rubies were magic but it wasn't cursed. We were told it might fetch a good price to someone if we would go to the port town. Here it would just be avoided like a curse. Belin decided to keep it for his house cause it had character. The ruby eyes were similar to this one http://i.ebayimg.com/15/!BplEPIQBGk~$%28KGrHqUH-C0EuZZZiR8QBLr9r%283c,!~~_35.JPG\n\nAnyway when Belin finally came out he was wielding a weapon that put all that looked at it in awe. He had crafted a silver masterwork large size greatsword. He had also integrated the skull into the sword. It had a constant look of blood running down from the eyes and down the full length of the blade with never a drop falling on the ground. Truly a terrifying and powerful weapon. Belin named it Bloodletter because with it he would spill the blood of his enemies.(I had him name it because I read in one of the books that orcs are fond of their weapon and usually name it. Later on I would find out there was a demon with that name. Didn't know that before hand but it was too late to change.) Our DM was so impressed he gave me a intimidation bonus while it was on Belin's person. It's hard to describe but the closest picture I could find was in this picture. The one on the left. \n\nhttp://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2012/119/c/2/aqw___swords___good_vs_evil_by_varinaqw-d4xy672.jpg. \n\nImagine it the same black color with a silver edge on the blade. Pretty wicked if I do say so myself. Now Belin has a weapon worthy of a hero. \n\nEdit: My DM recently asked if I had any plans to do other stuff to the sword or enchant or whatever. Recalling memories of \"Rave Master\" I said that if we came upon any other cool stones I might add them in. He said he'd consider putting some in or at least letting me find one or two to buy. ",

        "text": "The Game Breakers Extraordinaire: SR4\nSo my friends and I had been playing a Scion campaign that had just concluded sooner than expected. As a result, our next GM (we occasionally rotate) had not finished planning his next game, a Deus Ex rpg that he had created. So I stepped up, having had the most experience GMing after our current guy I offered to run a 4th edition Shadowrun game with one caveat:\n\nI wanted them to try as hard as they could be break me.\n\nAt this point I had run two campaigns; one SR4 game with only three players and a Serenity game that had lasted all of four sessions before the world began to tear asunder. However, I felt like challenging myself, since I had never ran the game with the players actively trying to disrupt it, and I wanted to see how I handled the pressure.\n\nI should probably note that two of my players (one of which was our former GM) had years of Shadowrun experience under their belts. They could create game-breaking characters in their sleep. Little did I know that they had taken my little challenge as a personal insult, and they were going to go all-out to take me down.\nSo when I got home I did what most inexperienced GMs handling an entire group of pissed-off munchkins would do:\n\nI panicked.\n\nLuckily, I was able to get a hold of an ex-member of our group over email, and this guy knew Shadowrun like it was his lover. We exchanged a few emails and he gave me some great ideas, which I soon encorporated into the game.\n\nThe board was set, time to make the first move.\n\nWhen the group met up again two weeks later I asked to see everyone’s character sheet so I would know what I was up against. I was not disappointed. The game-breaker bunch included:\n•\tA superman knock-off with a Reaction attribute of 104 and no stat under 26 with the power to sly and shoot laser-beams from his eyes.\n\n•\tA bear shapeshifter adept with healing so fast he could tank 8 damage a round and be up to full health by the next.\n\n•\tA rigger in a mechsuit which could ‘transform’ into a motorbike and had control of a small army of drone carrying heavy ordinance.\n\n•\tAnd a dwarf with enough cyberware to rival The Terminator and a taste for gore that would make Tarantino blush.\n\nI should add that this was all done within the rules as written. 4th edition Shadowrun is goddamn easy to break if you know how.\n\nI started the campaign simply enough. The PCs had been hired by Mr Johnson to go sort out an issue in upstate New York. The local townsfolk had been terrorized for weeks by spirits taking the form of Native American mythological creatures, who had been kidnapping children with each attack. Mr Johnson wanted the group to find the issue and deal with it before skiing season began at the nearby country club, as they couldn't have evil spirits riling up the locals.\n\nThe group took the six hour drive down there where they were greeted by their guide; an impossibly old Native American shaman called Tommy, who briefed them on the situation and advised that they spend the night in the town to try and defend it against the creatures before finding out where these things were coming from.\nThe whole time I had them rolling Perception (which they nearly always succeeded), which allowed them to note that a number of cloaked drones were following them and the townsfolk were also monitoring them, which put them on edge. They destroyed some of the drones, but more always cropped up.\n\nThat night they prepped the town for defense, setting up a perimeter and ensconcing the remaining children inside the town hall under the watchful eye of the sentient bear PC.\n\nThat was when things leapt out of control somewhat.\n\nWithout breaking sweat the group repelled the spirits, the superman knock-off managing to possess one of the spirits in order to help him defend the children, in the process damaging the town quite-severely. By the end of it, I knew that there was no way I could even get near them, so I had the BBEG (a Native American shaman tired of the steady encroachment of the corporations the town primarily worked for into his tribe’s lands) astrally project himself into the town to steal away at least some of the kids.\n\nYou can picture how that went.\n\nOptimus Prime (the rigger PC) spotted the BBEG with his drones (which had the capacity to perceive astral beings) and through their shared mind connection, got the superman knock-off to fire a FORCE –GODDAMN- 33 stun bolt at the BBEG’s astral form.\nFor those of you that don’t play Shadowrun, when the amount of stun damage dealt is higher than the character’s stun health track, it overflows into the character’s physical damage track.\nThis guy had, in one hit, fried the brain of the BBEG with a spell designed to stun, killing him. To be frank, he could had gone up to force 66, but as he said, “that would be overdoing it a bit”.\n\nWhen dawn broke, Tommy the guide suggested they track the resonance that the spirits had left, which led them up to Mount Marcy, a place of spiritual significance to the local tribe. When they arrived at its peak they found one side of it had been shorn completely smooth, as if it were a doorway. However, instead of phasing through or trying to unlock it, the PCs decided to tear it open, blowing apart the entire peak of the mountain, with several-dozen surveillance drones watching.\nIt then that I unleashed a couple of truth-bombs:\n\n1.\tInside the mountain was the cave were the children the BBEG’s spirits had kidnapped, all killed by the explosion when the top of the mountain was torn to pieces.\n\n2.\tThe cameras were in fact from the corporation that had hired them. It had filmed their entire escapade for a reality-show based on the antics of Shadowrunners.\n\n3.\tThe drones had caught them murdering a man, blowing up half a town, and tearing apart the mountain, thereby killing the children inside.\nThe show was due to air at 7pm that evening.\n\nNeedless to say, the PCs weren't very happy. I explained to them that they had a few hours remaining until the information was sent from Ares Corporation’s HQ in Detroit, 600 miles away, to a trid station to be broadcast nationwide. So they did what any crew of munchkin PCs with nothing to lose would do.\n\nThey stole an aircraft from a smuggler passing over the border into UCAS territory with several ounces of nova-coke and piloted it straight into Detroit. Casting a trid simulation spell so that cameras and drones wouldn’t pick them up, whilst simultaneously sending their truck barrelling into Ares territory as a distraction, they flew the plane straight into the top floor of the executive building of Ares, where CEO Damien Knight was having a breakfast meeting.\n\nExplaining the situation calmly to Knight, who was quite shaken at the destruction of his private office, including the elevator, thus preventing security from immediately getting up; the PCs requested that the footage be deleted. Seeing no over course of action (except possible decapitation), Knight made a couple of calls. The footage of deleted just as security managed to get inside the office using helicopters and drones. However, the PCs (and Damien Knight) jumped out of the window (invisible once again) and stopped a few inches off the ground thanks to superman knockoff’s flying ability and inordinate strength.\nKnight, impressed by the display, hired them on the spot as his personal black-ops team.\n\nThey took him for coffee to celebrate.\n",

We had just received the mission from Ranger Lady and were leaving the castle.\n\n**The Actual Story:**\n\nThe party exits a castle and are immediately greeted by a jittery, energetic man who is challenging people to a fight, who we would later learn went by the name Lightning Larry. Our Samurai dwarf decided to give him this fight, but instead of asking or challenging him or just punching him, he devises a plan. \n\nSamurai Dwarf looks at Slippery John, then Fighter Elf, at once, they all nod and Slippery John and Fighter Elf kneel, preparing to launch Samurai Dwarf at Lightning Larry for some sort of flying roundhouse kick. DM says we need to get a collective on 35 adding up Slippery John and Fighter Elf's strength rolls, plus Samurai Dwarf's dexterity roll. We get a 26 total. Samurai Dwarf is launched over Lightning Larry. Slippery John decides to launch himself at Larry with a spinning kick, he misses and hits Samurai Dwarf in the side of the head just as he was recovering, knocking him back over. The melee fight continues for a moment, until Larry unleashes some serious kung-fu and brings Samurai Dwarf down to 2HP (We were all level 1, so not much HP) then, it all changes.\n\nSamurai Dwarf is launched into a violent rage, seeking to defend his honor, he draws his katana. Slippery John, not condoning the act of murdering an innocent, only knocking him unconscious, tries to stop the madness but it's far too late.  The Party Ranger had burst into laughter and the scene previously, and Halfling Sorcerer was disgusted, and left the scene of the altercation. Realizing that this battle is heading south, Slippery John flees towards Party Ranger. Samurai Dwarf takes out his \"Tablet of Never ending Methamphetamine\" and scrapes some onto the blade of his sword, before snorting it. He takes his sword and takes Lightning Larry's arm with a single mighty swing. Larry decides to run.\n\nThe DM makes Party Ranger roll to stop laughing. He rolls a 1. Party Ranger falls over, inhales a large amount of dirt and begins coughing. Seeing that interacting with Party Ranger is fruitless. Slippery John begins to cry. Guards approach from both sides, including royal guards and Ranger Lady. Samurai Dwarf decides to charge past the quickly closing guards and rolls a natural 20 he takes down a guard and closes in on Lightning Larry. Slippery John hides behind barrels but is spotted by a royal guard. He rolls a diplomacy check to convince the guard he wasn't involved. He rolls to put his spear away and rolls a 1. He drops it and cuts his little toe off, Slippery John sneaks away. Fighter Elf and Samurai Dwarf decide to coordinate once more. Fighter Elf grabs Samurai Dwarf and throws him at the running Lighting Larry. He falls about 5 feet short and lands on the ground, going down to 1HP. The next turn, Samurai Dwarf  leaps into action and kills Larry.\n\nThe guards swarm around them. Suddenly, Slippery John wipes the tears from his eyes and stands. He tells everyone to stop fighting, and says he will take the party and leave. He slings the still laughing Party Ranger over his shoulder and gathers the rest of his party to leave. Ranger Lady stops them and says she will let them get away with it, because Lightning Larry was wanted for being part of an underground fighting ring. Slippery John utters the final in character phrase of the session. \"Is there a bounty?\" everyone playing laughs, DM ends the session soon after. He never got the bounty.\n\nrip in peace Lightning Larry ",

That’s why I sit in Vanguard outpost waiting for them to show up.  Bastards...  The Jericho knew how to deal with them.  Capture, torture, bullet to the head.  I always loved that.  Can’t do that in police protected space.  So that’s why I sit here.  It may sound evil or psychotic to wait on pirates to fly by, capture him or her, torture him or her.  But trust me when I say.  They deserve it.  Read the news on multiple colony transports crossing through unprotected sectors being boarded, burned and its passengers be burned alive or shot in space while the rest steal the goods.  Read that all the time and see if that don’t make your blood boil.  So I went rogue.  Bought this Wolf MKll, outfitted it with kenetic rail guns, modified EM missiles to take out them shields.  And a cloaking device to confuse and sneak.  You might say I was a hunter.  Doesn’t matter I guess.  Vanguard outpost lost station protection decades ago.  Now it’s a hotspot for all kinds of space scum.  On my 29th birthday I left working for federation security and started my full time job of illegal torture of space pirate.  It’s a good gig.  Sometimes I get paid for it.  More to come on this later..  Got some of these bastards jumping in.  Time to have a little fun.\n\nMore to Come",

        "text": "I started my game on with harsh weather and medium resources on a large valley's map. I had a really cool start location enclosed by two high ridges to the east and west and river and lake to the north and south, respectively.I started right off with houses, two fields and two fisheries. Not much interesting started happening until after about the seventh year. I started with beans and pumpkins which grow fast which was nice. I had masses of iron and wood, but almost no stone. I wanted to save the land that was cut off for housing, so I put my quarry and gathering buildings accross the river. This isnt really important, it was just a great start. \n\nThen disaster kind of struck. I was around 30-36 adults, no (students), then 6 babies were born in late summer. Everyone was fucking. In mid-winter, we ran out of food. I built a third fishery as fast as i could, but it was too late. The starving started, slowly, 2, then in early spring jumped to 10, then mid-summer 26. i harvested early so i could save some. Then they started dying. And just kept dying, until I was down to six kids and thirteen adults. I thought this was kind of cool so I could keep building and repopulate with huge amounts of food. But, in retrospect, I should have built a chuch. \n\nThe next summer in the spring, the village was overcome with cholera. I'd never seen disease strike, but it killed until I was down to 3 people and one kid, all men. All hope was lost. No town hall so no nomads. I gave up at that point. ",

We came to a point when he all just decided to get as wasted as we can at a local pub. \n\n We woke up the next day, and basically everyone around us were dead. We got pretty freaked out by this, and we asked a local who wasn't dead what happened. He gave us a dirty look and told us how we should know, but we convinced him to tell us the story:\n\n  After we got hammered, we all drunkenly walked out of the pub. This lead us to someone looking for help. We took up the offer, and headed to his house. What he wanted from us was to kill something that wondered in his home. \n  \n  We found it and, somehow, killed it. We celebrated by dicking around in his house. This lead to us finding a huge rat collection of his. We thought it'd be funny to let them go. Once we did, it turned out more and more followed them. We followed them, only to blackout. \n\n Turns out, that wasn't a collection of his, but a horde of them that was what was the intended targets to kill. What we \"killed\" was an extra door he had in his storage. After realizing what happened, the villagers chased us out of there. \n \n We ended up trying to find a cure, only to be beheaded by someone because we told them how we started it. \n\n TL;DR We got drunk, did a quest to kill rats in a house but only killed an extra door the person was keeping. The rats got away and started infecting everyone. \nWe get beheaded after saying we did it. ",

This would keep going on and on, and the person that wore the belt started to get very, very upset. He would yell and yell at the other to stop but he would never quit it.\n \n He finally snapped one day while we were staying at a hotel. Like always, he went after him to mess with him again, but didn't get the belt on him. As he was putting it on, the other member slashed his knife out, and ended up slitting the other's neck. \n \n Someone ended up checking up on us, and saw the scene that was caused.

At this point the local police were looking for us because they knew what happened. We ran but were still being looked for.\n \n We didn't know what to do at this point, so after awhile we came up with the idea to kill a guard, dress like them, and try to leave the country. This ended up in more killings then what was planned. After awhile, the guy who killed everyone to start with got shot with an arrow, and bled out.\n\n In the end of it all, we had this huge fight leaving the area where we got our guard suits. But, the ended up killing us all. All because of this gender changing belt prank.\n\n TL;DR A prank with a belt that changed genders got out of hand, party member kills other member, NPC'S find out, kill them, try to leave the area all together, then everyone died.",

        "text": "So me and my friends are playing a game of DH2 with me running the game as DM\n\nThe characters:\n\nCadan: Our leader and inquisitor. Loves using dual short range weapons and carries a shield. The most \"grimmdark\" character in the game and an absolute whore of a man. His battle strategy comes down to \"valiant charge!\"\n\nAzuri: Recon/assassin specialist. Hated Cadan with a firey passion due to his lack of tactics because it tends to lead to his natural advantages (stealth and range) being nullified. Has a long term relationship with the teams medic. Not a great leader but took the time to make friends with his entire team.\n\nZaneak: Heavy weapons guy. Simple character with simple values, guns and boobs. Has a reoccurring affair with the teams other heavy gunner. As stereotypical as his character appears, his honest relationship with Catherine is actually rather interesting and leads to a nice RP chance when the team is sick of combat.\n\nArthur Douglas Reginald Mcalister (ADR): The first DMPC. Designed as a team bodyguard in order to give them some wriggle room while they learn the ropes. Stereotypical British man. Loves the frontal charge and uses melee weapons almost exclusively.\n\nZerg: The second DMPC. Techpriest with a lot of personality. Terrible combatant with no knowlage of the world outside machines. Does the boring stuff like operating vehicles and weapon maintenance. Loyal to a fault but has a withdrawn personality.\n\nThe story: ADR takes a mortal wound early on in the campaign and gets shuffled to the side as he receives medical attention.\nCadan seeks out a fight with some tyranids and finds one pretty quick.\nDuring one combat with some tyranids, Azuri finds a manhole cover and decides to use it to sneak around the enemy. Somehow a mere human manages to out initiative a lictor that was hiding in the sewer system and only suffers a paltry 5dmg hit before he makes good his escape, Azuri is now marked.\nNow here's the thing with lictors, they are designed hunters, they are the size of a car but can hide in long grass, they can track you for miles and have quicker reflexes then most humans, even the genetically enhanced ones that are sprinkled throughout the universe.\n\nThe gang escapes without death and I start rolling.\n\nThey dodge the lictor the first day.\n\nIt gets distracted the second.\n\nThey flew out of range the third.\n\nThey went back to their ship the fourth.\n\nNow here is where it gets dark....\nThe lictor tracks Azuri to the ship, finally the rolls fall in favour of the lictor the DAY they decide to head back to their ship, the lictors found his target, who is onboard a parked ship with all the support staff. Unbeknownst to me, my team decides to use a smaller aircraft to fly across the state to go visit a small imperial outpost, leaving their support staff on board the homeship... Still parked on the surface of the city of the tyranid.\n\nI didn't want to do it but I had to. The lictor and its coterie take the ship, on board are the medic, the heavy gunner, both fall to the hordes within minutes. The team had rescued some guardsman, who returned the favour 3 times over the course of that same session, they fought valiantly, they killed almost a dozen gaunts and one survived but needed medical attention desperately. ADR, the heroic DMPC, the Alfred to Cadan's batman, injured but recovering, killed himself a goddamn lictor, his explosive tip lance took its freaking head off, but the tyranids aren't a single monster, they're a horde, and even valor is no defense against the tyranids... There is nothing left but his corpse.\n\nThe team is still in the field, they don't know what's happened back at base and are continuing to fight as if they were invincible.\n\nI let the dice fall, I fought desperately as the support team but the tyranids won, and that's the way it is, now my team will glimpse for themselves the true meaning of grimmdark... And now my little gods will become mortals.",

        "text": "Well, our group just had our first session together. Things happened, in part due to the fact that I made my character just to fuck with the DM. \n\nWithout further ado: \n\nDM: A large-haired man. He wears fuckloads of pins, and is actually willing to put up with my shit. Overall a cool guy.\n \n\n  TRYHARD MCGEE: The tryhard of the group. Elven archer, 20 DEX, wrote 1200 word character background.TM  for short.\n\nSpecial ability: Can try really hard.\n\n\n  BEARDY DA MUSCLES-BEARD: Human warrior. Complete badass. Great guy. You’ll find out more later. BDMD for short.\n\nSpecial ability: Rolling 20s.\n \n  WEEDSACK: Halfling rogue. In it for the lols. She tried to make a joke character but got epic rolls for her stats and ended up with ALSO having 20 DEX. WS for short. \n\n RAVENKNIGHT: Neutral paladin, worships the raven queen. Has a raven, but the only thing it does is not shit itself. \n\nSpecial ability: Convincing DM to allow neutral paladin \n\n  GONAD (formerly Gonads): Last but by no means least. I’m really unlucky with the dice (known for it, in fact), so fuck it. He’s a dwarf rogue. I exchanged the ability to speak and read for bonus feats and training. However, I didn’t minmax in a remotely useful direction: I put my highest stats in charisma and wisdom, with 9 Int and Dex.\n\n However, due to the DM letting me train multiple times (with diminishing returns, mind you) I ended up with +16 Intimidate. \n\nAdmittedly, the upsides of this are completely mitigated by the general uselessness of every other aspect of Gonad. He fights with a piece of rope. Just hits them with the fucking thing. He also communicates entirely in meaningful glances.  \n\nSpecial ability: Inspiring existential dread for no good reason\n\n\n  Most of the players are new to the game, so our DM, being a sadistic asshole, set up a campaign where everyone is racist against fairy-folk since they committed war crimes of various and grievous nature. \n\nNot knowing this, three of our players created fairy characters (Elf, half-elf, gnome). After finding our way to an Inn the Stubborn Drunkard, my first action was to intimidate the barkeeper into giving me free drinks. However, since the DM is trying as hard as he can to prevent me from Hendersoning his campaign, he didn’t let me do this. No free drinks for Gonad. \n\n  While this diminutive larcenist is attempting to procure free alcohol, Tryhard’s investigations ensue and ultimately fail.\n \n After sleeping in the inn (or in a tree in Gonad’s case; Fuck paying for things), the tiefling and half-elf characters find themselves naked in the attic of the inn, clearly kidnapped for some nefarious reason. It soon becomes clear that they are in the attic with a sleeping ghoul. The now awakened heroes seek to investigate the source of the noise, and, unable to find a trapdoor, opt for chopping through the floor to reach the attic. \n\nThis proves unsuccessful, as BDMD discovers when he takes out his giant two-handed sword and plunges it into the ceiling of the hallway. After pulling the sword loose, a small hole is left behind, enough for a half-elf to shout through (and summarily ask for help).\n\nBecause thinking is hard, BDMD headbutts the wall of the room adjacent to the attic. Poor man, the DM allows this, whereupon BDMD rolls a natural 20. \n\nThe wall is no longer vertical. \n\nNow clearly this wasn’t supposed to happen so easily, but it does. After brute-forcing his way into the attic, BDMD accosts the ghoul, curbstomping the fucker into the attic floor, causing both the ghoul and the floor of the attic to cave in. Beardy, the ghoul, and two naked adventurers fall into the hallway.  Thoroughly flattened by this, the ghoul dies. Asking \"What do you mean I have to stop hitting things when they die?\", BDMD repeats his previous manoeuvre, crashing through the floor into the basement.  \n\nThe more perceptive of you may be wondering: “Where exactly was Gonad?”\n\n\n Thoroughly taken aback by the innkeeper’s refusal to provide victuals pro Gonad, he decided to have his revenge by seducing the innkeeper’s wife. Armed with 17 CHA (think mini-Rasputin. Filthy, rude, but with a strange magnetism.) and a lucky roll, I had managed to get her into the basement for a quick shiggity-diggy. However, in a completely unforeseen manoeuvre (THANKS DM) she attempted an impromptu castration. \n\nFailing in this, she only removed one of Gonad’s gonads, prompting him to, and I quote, “cuntpunch that bitch”. \n\nRoused by these numerous noisy altercations, the innkeeper comes to investigate, whereupon he is summarily killed by Gonad. NEVER refuse the angry kleptomanic dwarf free drinks. NEVER. At this very moment BDMD, a naked teifling and half-elf , and a thoroughly flattened ghoul crash through the floor. At this point, completely overcome ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), Gonad passes out. \n\nMeanwhile the rest of the party is  about to kill the innkeeper’s wife, and reconsiders at the prospect of being shown where they keep the gold. After leading us to a secret chamber, an explosive device is activated, prompting rapid absconsion by the party. The innkeeper’s wife is then revealed as EVIL, whereupon she escapes and the Inn explodes. \n\nThat's where our session ended. I'm aware the write-up isn't very good at the moment, and some of the players were absent for some of the session, so it may seem a little disjointed. I'll post further episodes if there's interest.

        "author": "Ansung",
        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2wgm8o/dd_35_why_you_should_never_anger_the_man/",
        "text": "Hello again! Same deal as my [last story](https://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2obtl5/dd_a_cautionary_tale_or_why_you_should_never_make/), only this one is new... ish. Happened two weeks ago.\n\nCharacters:  \n**Ansung** (me): a rather paranoid CN Warlock with a rather unhealthy interest in everything-magic.  \n**Megara** (Codename_witch): a professional bounty-hunting Fire Elf Ranger and Greyhound, perhaps a bit greedy, certainly not lawful, and definitely in it for the fame and glory.  \n**Felix** (new player): a bit overweight (IIRC) Human Beguiler and a former merchant.  \n**Leon** (Nameless' new character): a perpetually tired Human (not sure), also a Dragonfire Adept.\n\n---------------------------\n\nSo, what changed with the PCs from my previous story:\n\nGhaz (Codename_cats) left the group immediately after we finished our previous quest. Luckily for him, as it turned out. Nameless played for quite a while as an intelligent item (Dave) - that now means his backup character also left the group, as Ghaz was using him/it.\n\nFiora (kid DMPC from previous story) was kidnapped by vampires during the previous quest. We're now looking for her, in addition to saving the realm in three different ways simultaneously.\n\n-----------------------------\n\n**INTRO**: So, we turned in the reports from our previous quest (clear out a vampire den). As a result, the Church of Pelor, who hired us, was grateful and wanted to designate us all as Wrath of Pelor - vampire hunters, basically, with access to holy and magical items useful in combating vampires (and possibly undead in general). Ansung wasn't too thrilled with it - he worships Boccob the Uncaring and isn't happy his family name might get attached to Pelor. He doesn't mind working with them, though. That led the Church's spokeperson to appoint one of us as leader, granting him/her and all companions access to the previously mentioned items. Megara didn't want to be appointed (something about having her face known, while she's hunting). It was finally decided that Leon will be appointed as the leader.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\n**Story time**: The thing is, we were supposed to travel quite a bit to the main cathedral and Megara wanted to attend a royal wedding. Only way to reach both of those places in time was with teleportation magic (airline distances involved were 1300 miles and 1300 miles). So, Felix went to the Church's spokeperson and got some advance payment on our future vampire-slaying gig. The rest of the party contacted Brittleshins - immensely powerful arcanist residing in a pocket universe. We woke him him and he wasn't in a good mood... however, promising a mountain of gold was enough to pique his interest and allow us entry to his realm.\n\nAfter a loooooong negotiation the deal was that Brittleshins casts an experimental Gate spell on us. The problem was that the spell, on destination, destroys an area of several hundred feet in radius. Brittleshins' solution was that the final destination is in air. *Our* solution was Featherfall. One scroll was supposed to be enough - because Megara had an artifact-ring that could cast it every once in a while.\n\nThen the fun started.\n\nBrittleshins cast his spell. Everyone was pulled into it. Felix managed to give the Scroll of Featherfall to Ansung. Ansung's magical protections stopped working.\n\nAnsung, Felix, Leon, Megara, her horse and Ghaz' cat (on said horse) appeared 600 feet in the air, with the ground rapidly approaching. Felix, Leon and the two animals were knocked out by the spell.\n\n*Tee minus 20 seconds to splat*: Ansung investigated the scroll, trying to figure out how to cast it. Megara grabs Felix and Leon and activates the Featherfall ability of her ring. \n\n*Tee minus 15 seconds to splat*: Felix and Leon regain consciousness. No panic because they're slowly descending.\n\n*Tee minus 12 seconds to splat*: Ansung flew to the horse and the cat. Horse regains consciousness, starts to panic. Megara's Featherfall gives out, Felix and Leon start to panic. They try several things, none of which work.\n\n*Tee minus 6 seconds to splat*: Ansung cast Featherfall and gently landed. Megara casts Gust of Wind on Felix (who was grasping her leg), so she could be free and able to cast Levitate on herself. While the spell didn't slow down their fall, it did surprise Felix enough for him to let go.\n\n*Tee minus 3 seconds to splat* (DM's grace): Megara casts Levitate. Felix casts Invisibility on himself, so that noone sees his face when he dies. Leon ponders the cruelty of universe.\n\n*Post-splat*: Horse goes completely wild. Cat, also bewildered, holds fast on the horse. Ansung looks up, sees the disappearance of Felix, Leon quietly falling to his death and Megara slowly descending.\n\nMegara remarked: \"What? He touched my ass.\"\n\n---------------\n\nI should note that he could've just slowly descend down - his magical protections (i.e. Fell Flight) returned the moment he appeared in the air. He just wanted to save his/Megara's means of transport.\n\n---------------\n\nI had a ton of fun during that session. DM decided to first do Ansung's fall, then the others'. That left me with roughly an hour of amazing fun, listening to ideas such as \"I'll grab my blanket and improvise a parachute\", and counters such as \"Would your character really know that much about aerodynamics?\".\n\nI didn't find funny at all was DM's later remark about how he doesn't need to bother anymore with giving us loot - characters tend to die quickly and leave us with their valuables. \n\n----------------\n\nEDIT 1: Felix lived for 8 sessions. Leon lived for 4 sessions. Ansung and Megara are the only original members of the party. Leon_player got tired of his original character and has since downgraded him to an NPC. [Here's a list of all PCs that were in the party.](http://prntscr.com/678jny) (player names are color-coded). All those are from July 27th of 2014. :)",

        "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/gametales/comments/2wcqe5/timetravel_berserking_unicorns_and_the_time_we/",
        "text": "Gather 'round, friends, and let me tell you the take of how a hapless group of time-and-multiverse travelers learned a very valuable lesson.\n\nOur rotating cast of persona dramatae include:\nShanghai, an explorer and historian from the 23rd, and our time travelling taxi. He has a bad tendency to take pictures at inopportune times, and a futuristic iPad-like datapad loaded with histories and knowledge.\n\nPriest (can't remember his in-game name), from a zombie apocalypse world, a survivor who has the virus, is often our face and voice of reason, and occasionally pulls out a can of righteous whoopass.\n\nGomorra; Alien(?), True invisibility which only allows him to appear when he holds his breath (don't ask), and 360 vision. He's our scout, and often is comically inept at combat, but is amusing.\n\nNate, our Mage.. whose ability to take on various talents and magical spells has saved us more times than we can count. The magical backbone of the group.\n\nPrincess (another one I forgot the name of).. 12 year old, virginal telekinetic that packs an immense force at ridiculous distances - the raw force this one brings to bear is scary, and the player plays true chaotic neutral.  We strive to keep Princess amused, less she wanders off into shenanigans.  Last time we laxed in this, she was involved with bringing back dinosaurs eggs.. for battle mounts.\n\nSeductress (another in-game char whom plays somewhat regularly, but I don't remember the in-game name). All out dazzling shapeshifter, who thoroughly enjoys her powers of seduction and mind reading, along with some shapeshifter ability. Princess' partner in crime for shenanigans, though her seductions are all her own.\n\nAnd finally, Lily, a biological android from a solar system travelling future; she is an agile bruiser, magically enhanced to survive quantums with no electricity and other random survival hazards, and software that allows her Trained by a Master and all of its implicit cinematic fighting fun.  This is my character.\n\n---\n\nIn our world, the home reality is Mageline, where a powerful spell caster gained the ability to access the magery college involving time and space. (I have no idea, honestly. My character just exploits the magic and hits things.)  The mage, Miguel, is interested in maintaining timelines while allowing our unique temporal natures to effectively re-wind time if we screw up, with some interesting consequences. It's all very Doctor-Who-esque in setting, in that Time is mostly flexible, especially in the relative Now of a world.\n\nMiguel wanted the party to meet with the Oracle of Delphi, on a world where this position was one of power. A mysterious organization has been galavanting across time and space, and we have only begun to see its shape. Ultimately, Miguel wanted answers divined, so to the Oracle we were sent.\n\nThe Oracle, in turn, demanded a proper tribune, fit for the prophet of a god.  Okay. Miguel suggested we find a real Unicorn, and acquire some of the magic of its horn.  There were rules though. The horn and unicorn must remain relatively unmolested, certainly alive. The horn couldn't be removed, but after questioning we discovered some shavings would suffice.\n\nA few divinations later, and we locked down a reality with a real unicorn. Two, in fact. Disco. Magic-hand-wavey, and we bamf out to a wild forest.\n\nAt this point, we are informed via Shanghai's datapad, there were two known varieties of unicorn floating around. The classical, virginal sort with frippery and flowers and very hippy-like.. and the shit-bag type of unicorns that are really just vicious, magical animals with horns.\n\nWe dubbed those the \"fuck-u-nicorn's. My group has a sense of humor.\n\nSo a little more magic, on which this group depends, and we have a direction. Too much magical interference otherwise.\n\nLily, recent upgrades making her a damn fine scout, heard the rustle of a predator behind. She dropped back out of the group, keeping in touch on sub-voc. She hides in some bushes near the trail, and sees a panther prowling along behind the crew, obviously hunting.\n\nLily has two major disadvantages here that come into play; in fact most of the group is pretty heavily flawed. She is both impulsive, which is played to the nine's, and she is frightening to animals. Tail-shitting fear.  Panther books it out of dodge, leaving a disappointed android looking for a fight. All of this comes into play later, as the entire group seemed to be on edge from being hunted.\n\nFurther down the path, we see it. Not knowing what type of unicorn this bastard was, we decided that sending in the virgin was probably the best best. Even the fuck-u-nicorns liked virgins. So Princess is nominated, and pushed forward, crying out \"I'll strip the flesh from your bones if you hurt that pretty unicorn\".\n\nGomorra, our scout, decides to place himself half way between us and the animal, after heavy debate on just how invisible he really was.  Everyone else spreads out, expecting the worst.  Our luck is not good, at best, and often quite downright hilariously bad. Our first mission was to stop yet another 'timetraveller-tries-to-kill-hitler' mission, which ended up being successful by way of spilled soup and a wobbly table.\n\nSo spread out, we waited on Princess to approach.  Princess, like Lily, is rather impulsive. Princess, also like Lily, likes to show off her skills every chance she gets. Not for attention. Just for amusement.\n\nWith as gentle a telekenetic force as she can, Princess strokes the neck of the unicorn, trying to comfort it.\n\nThis was the moment we discovered exactly what kind of unicorn this thing was.\n\nHead down, hoofs beating against the ground, the bastard charged us. Gomorra nearly gets run over, and pushes Nate out of the way (as Nate was taking aim to cast a devastating spell), interrupting his cast. He stood, a quick arm wave, and the fuck-u-nicorn crashed to the ground mid-stride.  It quickly found its feet, glaring hatred and rage as only an equine can manage, and proceeds to try to gore, and stomp, whatever member it can. The frighten animals aura only served to enrage it further.\n\nLily landed a titanic punch or two, Shanghai used a special electric discharge ability (his only innate defense), Preacher pummeled this creature, and Nate cast fatigue-draining spells.  All intending to knock this thing out, but it would *not* go down. We remembered our instructions. We tried.\n\nBut, we found out later, the particularly interesting characteristic of this particular breed of unicorn was a berserker bloodrage. One that ignored fatigue. Until dead.\n\n[[I don't know if the rules worked that way, in the books, but for the game, none of us argued this..]]\n\nSo with one massive fatigue drainging blow by our mage, and the fuck-u-nicorn went down. Whew, finally. Okay, heal it up a little, since we beat on it so much, and take the shavings. We're home free!\n\n\"Hey guys?\" Shanghai frowned, poking at the bastard. \"Guys, I think we killed it.\"\n\nThe GM dies laughing. Princess' character screams, and it takes the full group to restrain her from taking our mage's block off with a telekenetic blast that would've knocked his head to the moon if it landed. \n\n\"Okay, okay, let's take the unicorn back to Miguel. Surely he can fix this. He's a powerful mage!\"\n\nOne bamf-with-a-body later, we arrive to a red-faced, ranting leader.\n\n\"What in the ever-loving-hells was that?!\" he raged.\n\n\"I know, right? I told them! I'm gonna kill him!\" Princess raged.\n\n\"It charged us.\" Lily said.\n\n\"But you killed it?! I said not to kill it!\" Miguel gestured at the body.\n\n\"But it was trying to gore us, and wasn't playing very nice.\" Shanghai muttered.\n\nMiguel growls something, and stomps off. The time travellers look at each other uncertainly. He returns carrying a large 2x4, which he began to beat Shanghai with, screaming in rage.\n\nSee, here's the other part of working for a powerful mage. Good equipment.\n\nMiguel punctuated each word with another smack of the wood. \"It. was. a. fucking. animal. You. were. not. in. danger!!!\"\n\nThe 2x4 shattered against Shanghai's nano-weave armor, one end sailing off into the huge room, leaving him unbruised and bemused.\n\n\"Idiots.\" Miguel muttered, dropping the broken half of the 2x4.  With a negligent wave and a powerful flaring of magic, the fuck-u-nicorn began to stir.\n\n\"Put it back. You've damaged the timeline, it has lost its magic. You cannot use this one. When you are done, we will plan how to fix this.\"\n\n... And that, my friends, is how we learned the joys of having good armor as time travelers.",

My nephews are 9 and 13, and the other brother is 15. This is their first real campaign. I have quite a bit of experience and that's why I'm the DM. It's fair to say everyone else is  still learning.\n\nWe're running Hoard of the Dragon Queen, and they're clearing out the dragon hatchery.\n\nThey clear out the barracks and get to the room with Mondath first. Nice fight, but they get through it without too much difficulty. It was easier than I thought it would be. They also rolled a lot of crits in that fight. Next comes the room with Cyanwrath, a half-dragon. and his two beserker bodyguards.\n\nBrother one, the older one, a half-orc barbarian lands the killing blow against Cyanwrath. I ask him to describe the death. He indicates that he takes his head clean off with a swipe of his axe. Ouch, a little more brutal than I thought he might go for with the young ones present, but it's good role-playing.\n\nLater on, it's getting late in the session, and there's basically one room FULL of kobolds left in the dungeon. Everyone is getting tired and decide they don't want to get dragged into a fight. I support this, like any good DM, because I want them to learn to creatively deal with situations. The 13 year old nephew, who's a ranger, asks what he would know about kobolds. A successful nature check reveals that they respect power, worship dragons, and are not that bright.\n\nThe party begins to hatch a plan to clear out the room without going into combat. The little nephew, the 8 year old dragonborn gladiator/bard, has an idea to use the severed head of Cyanwrath to frighten the kobolds and make them give up. They backtrack to retrieve the head. They also have Mondath's robes. My wife, another bard, decides to cast unseen servant and to have the servant dress up in Mondath's robes and carry the severed head into the room of kobolds.\n\nThe plan works. The kobolds were so frightened at seeing some ghost like creature parading around in one boss's robes while carrying the head of the half-dragon boss that they flee at the sight.\n\nI've been so proud of my family this week.",

My favorite allowed me to summon demons and bind them to objects, basically creating magic items with a good chance to murder you.\n\nSo I usually made and sold them. Became very rich.\n\nNow, because my warlock familiar was enchanted as good, any detect evil spells would ping back good. So even OOC for four months of sessions only the DM and our rogue knew I was evil.\n\nThe rogue was a theif with few morals. I would pay him to \"acquire\" things I needed for my research.\n\nSo when out party's gnome bard had started to catch on to my true nature, I had to deal with him.\n\nSo one night I had the rogue sneak into the gnomes room and steal his journal. Several hours and dozens of human and elf sacrifices later I had successfully bound an archdemon of blood into his journal.\n\nFast forward several weeks and the journal was slowly driving the gnome insane. Out parties LG (lawful idiot) paladin decides to inspect it. They cast a detect evil spell on the journal.\n\nBoom. I had the book set to release the demon whenever a detect spell was cast on it.\n\nSuddenly a giant claw shoots out of the book, instantly knocking the gnome Into negatives and half healthing the paladin.\n\nNow there's a fuckhuge archdemon of blood and slaughter, about 43ft tall and all spikes and blood and demonic nonsense.\n\nI planned ahead for this and made the rogue and myself invisible to the sight of demonic creatures.\n\nThe gnome gets unceremoniously stepped on and dies instantly.

They manage to all break out of their chains either through dexterity or strength, most notably Remryn, who rolled a nat 20 and backflipped out of his cuffs by kicking off of the wall. Carolus and Ambros rip the hinges off of the door which encloses them to the room, and the group find themselves in a large room, which is filled with a bunch of inbred dwarf-like creatures shambling around. Being a rather non-heroic and violent bunch, they decide to punch the things. This causes the large amount of the things which reside there to attack them all, and the party finds themselves in a rather tight spot by the end of the fight, with no door in sight. They decide to take a rest, even though they have no food or water.\n\nAfter they awaken, they inspect a riddle scrawled into the east wall of the room, which Kaizar blurts out an answer to. As he does so, a tally mark scratches into the wall, accompanied by an ooze leaking out, which proceeds to envelop Auto-Thomas. The party attempts in vain to save him, but it is not until Remryn picks him up and throws him that the creature falls off. Kaizar and Dyraga debate the answer more, this time yelling out yet another wrong answer. Another tally scrawls into the wall, two blobs ooze out of the wall. As the party tries to escape and trap the oozes, Dyraga realizes something; the oozes *are* the answer. As he yells it out, they dissipate into the floor, and the door opens.\n\nThey go down a small hallway, and find a room with a large pillar, some kind of magical-conduit-contraption-thing. The almost dead Autono-Thomas decides to investigate it, dodging the lightning which arcs from the device. It reads,\n&gt; T H E A T R I C A L\n&gt; M A G I C A L\n&gt; D I S A B L E M E N T\n(the party had no use of their magical abilities up to this point). After many members attempted to figure out how to turn off the device, The surprisingly intelligent Ambros discerns how to restore the powers of his new 'allies.'\n\nHowever, all was not well, for as they turned off the device, the party heard many doors opening. As they turned around, they were faced with two gigantic, and very engraged, brutes. After much struggle in the fight, the party is saved by a mysterious spellcaster, using a ruby as a casting focus. Only thing is, the ruby is set into his eye socket. So he's pretty much Cyclops from the X-Men, but fantasy.\n\nThe party questions the man on many things, but he simply beckons them to move on with him so they may escape. At this time, Autono-Thomas is in sleep mode (the player couldn't make it to the session, he was alright with this). They move on through another door which opened up back through the large room, when a sword flies through the mysterious man AND Chardlos (the player couldn't make it to any sessions, delayed us on multiple occasions, ultimately cancelling the sessions. He was removed from the group), killing both. Carolus and Remryn work together to piece the two bodies into a fleshy riot shield of sorts, while Kaizar and Dyraga go up ahead to investigate what is happening. They get into a firefight with a Deurgar who simply cackles and commands swords through the whole ordeal, until he decides to triple in size, and wield the two sentient swords which he commanded. The rest of the party comes around the corner, to see first terrified comrades, and then a hulking monstrosity. Remryn trips the 'man' with thorn whip (nat 20 on yanking its leg), and this is quickly followed by Ambros running up to it and shoving it off the ledge of the cavern they had just entered. (This was much to the dismay of Carolus, who wanted to strip him of everything and anything valuable. A true plunderer.)\n\nThe escape out into harsh wintry mountains, to run into a dwarf accompanied by a monkey (Rupert's player could not play the first session). They quickly allow him in, needing all the help they can get in their quest to, well... survive. Rupert and Kaizar quickly hit it off, because of their ties in being escaped slaves. They cook the meat from a mammoth carcass, Carolus takes its tusks, various members of the party attempt to craft things out of its bones, they drink its blood, and then camp out within the warmth of its corpse.\n\nAfter trekking for 50 miles, and growing a stronger bond between themselves, (at this point, from what I have seen, mainly Rupert and Kaizar have become friends, and Dyraga and Remryn assist each other, perhaps because both are so malicious. Carolus and Ambros both tend to be loners.) they arrive at a small city, split into four factions; scholars, hunters, miners, and smithees. Remryn makes himself a huge enemy to the hunters, and literally takes a dump on their doorstep. When taken away by a guard, he was saved by Dyraga, whose masterful dice rolls and charisma convinced the guard that \"this is not the man who shit on the doorstep.\" Meanwhile, Kaizar and Rupert (and of course Gustab, who is practically Rupert's son) convince the entirety of the city that Kaizar is a noble and Rupert is his esteemed guest. They are given a room to stay in at the Town Hall, and are waited on hand and foot by a homonculus.\n\n\nThat is where their tale ends... for now. I am rather proud of this group's ingenuity and RP'ing, considering only Carolus' player (who plays WH40K) and Autono's player (who plays 3.5e and Pathfinder) have any experience in tabletops. (Except myself, but the DM doesn't really count too much in these stories, its the time for the PCs to shine.) More to come!",

        "text": "A quick disclaimer, reiterated: I run my campaign fast and loose when it comes to the rules, usually erring on the side of leniency toward my players. My setting and most of my items are homebrew as shit. With that in mind, here's the story.\n\nAfter the insane bullshit with the Wabbajack was resolved, the cleric, newly minted champion of order, took the staff and resolved to store it where the rest of the party couldn't use it. Then they started up the mountain to confront Father Llymic, an Elder Evil ranking highly in the Bad Fucking News category. The snow and ice made for treacherous footing, and I warned the players that they would need to make frequent Balance checks or risk falling down the mountain. So of course the fuckers use the rope from their climbing kits to tie themselves to each other, so that whenever anyone failed a check the rest would roll Strength checks to catch them and pull them back up. Needless to say, no one ever fell off the damn mountain. They made short work of most of the enemy encounters with many lucky rolls and clever applications of magic, but close to the summit they made a crucial mistake: they passed a cave and used a spell to peek inside without entering, showing them a sleeping Brood Spawn White Dragon. Their error was to assume that they could escape the fight by simply sneaking on by; in doing so, they assured that Llymic could call the dragon to his side during the battle. My error was in assuming that they wouldn't find a way to cheese it around to their advantage. Once they reached Llymic's prison and buffed themselves into infinity, the mighty creature emerged. The battle started out well for him, as he used his Discord and Woe power to drive the paladin, heaviest hitter in the party, into a rage which caused him to attack the nearest creature, then summoned the dragon to his side. The players' first action was to have the barbarian throw the paladin toward Llymic to make him the nearest creature, passing the grapple and throw checks with flying colors. So there went that, but they still couldn't fight the dragon and Llymic together, right? So I thought, until the sorcerer busts out Dominate Monster. As an Elder Evil, Llymic was immune, but the dragon? I couldn't find anything saying it couldn't be affected. My only hope lay in the dragon passing the Wisdom check to resist the spell. Sorcerer rolls, it comes up a four. With his Wisdom modifier, the DC for the dragon was seven. The players are pissed, I grin in triumph. Until the dragon rolls a fucking five. Its modifier was one. My face when. Panicking, I declare that since Llymic is in direct psychic control of the dragon, the sorcerer must roll against him as well. Sorcerer does well, I look to my die. Crunch time, now or never. I roll, Llymic fails the check. My fucking face when. The dragon is dominated, turning my trump card against me. I activate the fail-safes and send a swarm of flying Brood Spawn to harass the dragon and prevent it from taking part in the fight, but the scales have still been tipped back in the party's favor. The fight commences in earnest, and the players start getting some tremendous fucking rolls: the cleric successfully summons an aspect of his god to aid him, curing the paladin of his madness and damaging Llymic, several crits are scored, and Llymic can barely hit. In the end, even when more Brood Spawn showed up to help, the party managed to burn Father Llymic down without losing a single member and without the sorcerer needing to break concentration, thus preventing the dragon from ever entering the fight. GG no re. Now we're starting a new campaign arc, meaning there will be more tales to come in the future.",

[WAAAAAAAAAAAGH!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAgnJDJN4VA)\"\n\n___\n\nI showed my group the responses from the stories I posted here, and I mentioned that the finale was the next one. We joked about how we \"couldn't let down our audience\" and \"there are still so many places to royally screw over for no apparent reason\". Our GM wasn't joking. We're back. And Kaptin Gazbag Wurldstompa has set his eyes on a greater prize than even the great Holy Terra. Our story takes place after a decade of fighting the infinite daemon hordes on Terra, after Gazbag killed The Emperor of Mankind.\n\nUnlike my previous stories which took place months before and relied on my shoddy notekeeping and memory, these are coming only days after the game. Enjoy.\n___\n\n**Da Krew**\n\n**Kaptin Gazbag Wurldstompa:** The self styled \"King of Dakka\". Armed with more looted weapons and technology than a normal man could carry. He only retains the title of \"Kaptin\" because he's the only one that actually knows how to pilot the ship.\n\n**Mad Dok Zagbar Boneshredder:** An outlawed Mad Dok. Greedy, and obsessed with unnecessary surjery, particularly cybernetic modifkashuns. He's given himself an adamantium skull, a laser eye, a power klaw, and cybernetic legs.\n\n**Big Mek Zapstrak 'Urtybitz:** A cybork mek and fanatic from da Kult of Speed. He has an unparalleled (by Orky standards) knowledge of machinery, and is single handedly responsible for keeping DA WAAAAAAGHON running. Rider of the mighty bike, Da Wheel of Fortoon.\n\n**Snagagrub Warp'ead Da Grim**: Cheef Libruain aboard DA WAAAAAGHON. Extraordinarily powerful,  he has lost the ability to contain his powers. Every time he shifts even slightly he crackles with energy, and during combat he must use a psychic power or he will explode. Has an unhealthy obsession with The Imperium of Man, which is awkward because we kinda destroyed it.\n\n**Skugtaga BadBad da Git:** A Blood Axe Kommando. Greedy, even by Ork standards. Responsible for all the looting operations for Da Krew. He wears bright pink armour. \"Pink is roight sneaky. Has you evah seen a pink tank? I hasn't!\" Waagor's new character.\n\n**Maggrim Maggrimsson, Son of Maggrim da Maggrim of Klan Maggrim:** Thanks in no small part to Gazbag talking up the battle between Maggrim and Marneus Calgar, a small cult has formed around Maggrim, worshiping him as a prophet of Gork (or possibly Mork). The spore that Snagagrub recovered from Maggrim's body matured into a healthy Stormboy. He is kunnin' and strong, but a little uptight. He fights using Da Klaws of Da Blue Git. (The Fists of Ultramar)\n\n___\n\nDa Krew gathers in Gazbag's throne room. \"Roight! I'z bored. We'z gonna leave Terrer and find a noo purpose!\" yells Gazbag, standing on The Golden Throne of Terra.\n\n\"But Boss, DA WAAAAAAGHON is zogged. Da Enjins isn't working.\" sighs Zapstrak.\n\n\"Den makes us annuver!\" \"No prome... promo... prometh... BURNY STUFF boss!\"\n\nGazbag looks around the room and shrugs. \"Ah, zog it den. More spiky gits!\"\n\nSkugtaga speaks up from the back of the room. \"Just loot da Enjins offa da Blue Gitz ship!\"\n\n\"Dats roight kunnin'! Where is it?\" applauds Zagbar.\n\n\"Da Spiky Gits built a fort around it.\"\n\nDa Krew needs new pants. Not only do they get to fight their way through a Chaos Marine fortress, they also get to leave Terra. Snagagrub screams in excitement, exploding a nearby Boy'z head in the process.\n\n___\n\nDa Krew hops aboard Da Orktress of Arrigence, Gazbag's personal looted Baneblade. \"DRIVE ME KLOSA! I WANNA CHOP DEM WITH MA CHOPPAH! WAAAAAAAAAAGH!\" screams Maggrim from the top of the tank. Zagbar and Zapstrak sit on the side with [Shokk Attak Guns](http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Shokk_Attack_Gun), Gazbag drives, Skugtaga mans da megakannon, and Snagagrub is tied up in the back so he doesn't accidentally kill us all.\n\nThe drive to the fortress is relatively uneventful. Zagbar and Zapstrak amuse themselves by firing off dimension tearing shots at nearby grots, while Skugtaga learns how to use the kannon.\n\nDa Orktress arrives in front of the the fortress. \"FIYAH DA MEGAKANNON!\" Skugtaga rolls, and fucks it up. Point blank range, shooting an inanimate object, and he rolls... 98. Da Kannon jams. \"Dammit Zapstrak!\" shouts Skugtaga. \"You zogg'd da Kannon!\" Zapstrak shouts something unintelligible back and starts hammering at da Kannon with his power klaw (Tech Use -20, which he succeeds at). \"Dere! I fixed it!\"\n\nSkugtaga's second attack is much better. The gate blows open and Da Orktress rolls in and starts going ham, blowing up Chaos Marines and Daemons aplenty. Maggrim jetpacks out the top of the tank and starts punching holes in marines. Skugtaga lets Snagagrub out of his bindings, who then immediately tries to teleport outside, but only succeeds in setting his head on fire. Zapstrak and Zagbar start firing their Shokk Attak Guns, and manage to almost die once each thanks to misfiring.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the fortress is completely cleared out. They stomp over to the fallen Ultramarine Battlebarge, and clumsily rip out the engines using their power klaws. \"Power Klaws solve everythin'!\" calls Zapstrak, before accidentally puncturing one of the fuel canisters, spraying promethium in his face and catching fire, much to everyone else's amusement.\n\nThey load the engine onto the Orktress and drive back to the palace. They spend their trip back mostly laughing at Zapstrak. Zapstrak spent it eating the remaining \"ammo\" from his Shokk Attak Gun.\n\nWith the engines properly integrated into DA WAAAAAAGHON, a small (by Ork standards) krew gathered, and enough grog to improvise an exterminatus loaded onto the ship, da krew rockets off.\n\n___\n\nDa Krew gathers on the bridge.\n\n\"Roight boyz. Gork and Mork spoke ta me, and I'z got a vision.\" brags Gazbag. The rest of Da Krew rolls their eyes, but accepts this. They need Gazbag. \"We'z gonna conkah [DA WEBWAY!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKggnBh2Mdw)\"\n\n___\n\nThis game happened yesterday. The GM wrote the scenario shortly after I posted part 1 of the finale. Our GM has promised more opportunities for on-ship shenanigans, and much harder warp travel, thanks to our destruction of The Astronomicon and murdering the Emperor. Join us next week for our first target on our quest to conquer the entire freakin' Webway: We need information, so we'z gonna krump da Eldar Weirdboy, Eldrad Ulthran!",

They find nothing in any of the drawers or cupboards just some food and a few pieces of gold. The mirror seemed to be the most exquisite thing in the otherwise dull room but there was still nothing special or magical to it. That just left the matter of the strange floating things that on closer inspection turned out to be dust. Now something was off about this dust it wasn’t just floating there it was constantly shifting changing form. With a little bit of magic the wizard managed to get the dust to steady itself and lo and behold a message appeared. “*To whoever may find this, there is more to this murder then meets the eye, search with the object we have left behind.*” Now the only thing that really stood out in the room was the mirror so the party now starts searching the room with the mirror trying to discern anything that might help. As they are searching a corner of the room the ranger notices something odd, it turns out the old lady has no reflection! So of course that gets the party intrigued and they reinspect the body, revealing that all the stab wounds are to cover up just one made to the heart. So now the party flipping out because wtf why is there a dead vampire here. After a quick in party discussion they begin to question the townsfolk. Strangely though they didn’t know anything about the murder or that the old lady was a vampire or even most strangely that vampires even existed.  As they were finishing up asking around the rogue comes back and says that he couldn’t catch the other party but he did find where they were headed. So the rest of the party quickly fills him in on what’s going on and they head off in the direction the other party went thinking they must know something.   \n\nThey soon arrive at the next town with a couple of bear skins to sell. They use said bearskins as a talking point with the merchant who says that the group of 8 was here paid for some whetstones and an axe then headed off to the inn. So they head for the inn next with a little bit of convincing the innkeeper remembers them and also remembers them asking the same thing about where to find vampires however after a brief discussion in the morning they went off in the opposite direction of where the vampires could be found, and instead headed towards Mefre. When questioned where it is that the vampires may be found they were pointed towards a cave where some animals and villagers had been going missing.  \n\nWell after hearing this, the party stays the night at the inn and begins the trek out to the cave the next morning. They soon arrive at the cave and enter it. They get about 40 feet in before they hit just a solid wall of uninteresting stone. Before they have time to process what this means they are hit from behind and all knocked out.  \n\nThey come to in a brightly lit room tied to a foul smelling chair surrounded by a bunch of the townfolks surrounding them.\n",

A familiar old man stops them at the gates and turns to Loch, \"This place is more dangerous than you could possibly imagine, turn back now and you may live.\" Loch simply sighed and whispered to the man. The wizened man closed his eyes and nodded, and opened the gates for the party. The path leading to the mansion was overgrown and mossy. Nobody had seemed to stop foot here for several years. Rizzax gripped Uunkalo's leg as various small animals burst from the shrubs. The druid simply laughed and patted the kobold on the head. \"Nothing to fear yet, my friend.\" \n        \nThe door to the mansion looked rotted, but still held firm, and Evard knocked on the door to see if the simplest option would work. Surprisingly, the door creaked open to reveal a small, lit foyer. As the four settled in, the door swung closed and begun to glow red. As soon as he saw it, Evard knew that they were trapped inside.\n       \nTo most, all hope would be lost, but Uunkalo took charge and began to look around the foyer for some way to escape. The only notable features were four painting on each side of the room, and a door opposite to the entrance. The paintings were covered in a thick layer of grime, and Evard had begun to dust them off, until one began to shake. Inside the painting, Tattered Pages danced around trying to get the group's attention. Luckily, Evard had noticed and brought the painting to the others as they were walking through the door.\n     \nThe next room was dimly lit by a chandelier with broken lamps. There lied a  door to the left as well as a set of destroyed staircases to the right, they would need to return with proper equipment to traverse upwards, so they needed to head to the west for now. Through that door, an ornate carpet led to the end of a hall, with a large, strange symbol, similar to a lightning bolt. Loch reached out and traced the symbol with his middle finger. As soon as the outline was traced, it begun to glow red. As the red glow began to illuminate the room, it became apparent that thousands of these symbols littered the walls. The light faded and Rizzax lit one of his candles.\n       \nThe image that befell them was gruesome, and even the mighty Uunkalo had trouble keeping his breakfast down. Loch's hand, while being made purely of earth, began to blacken and warp, and maggots appeared and writhed out of sores. Something had cursed his hand, and it was growing worse by the second. A door to the south swung open and the four groups hustled through to try and find a way to open the front door.\n          \nAnother dark room was quickly lit up by the candle, and a larger symbol was seen on the floor. Surrounding it were runes in blood as well as piles of bone. At this point, Loch decided his hand was lost so he would try again. The symbol pulsed and hummed, and the bones began to rattle. The blood boiled and began to fill in the symbol on the ground. Loch screamed in agony as his entire left arm became consumed by the blackness. Edvard took action and swiped his foot across the symbol, disrupting the ritual and releasing Loch from his agony. At this point, Loch had lost all control in his arm and could no longer hold his sword. He sheathed it and followed the group from the back. Continuing through the room, three figures were detected in the corner, shambling about, moaning the entire time. \"Zombies...\" whispered Evard, \"Such disgusting creatures.\" Rizzax and Uunkalo decided that that would be the perfect opportunity to test their might, and began to rush at the abominations.\n          \nThe moans grew louder and the three ghouls slashed and bit at the massive man, but ignored the kobold as he smashed their skulls in from behind. The two psychopaths laughed and began to loot the bodies, but before they could retrieve anything, the corpses faded into ash. A door to the west and to the south were available, and it was decided to go to the south. A small corridor stained in blood and claw marks led to another room, just like the previous, except a few desecrated holy symbols as well as burnt holy texts were found with the bones. Rizzax noticed this and took a vial of holy water out of his holy symbol and blessed the bones, as he knew the creatures he just killed were former clergymen. Uunkalo picked up the kobold again and told him that they needed to move on, as Loch was getting worse. The curse spread throughout his torso and he was staggering with every step.\n        \nThe only way to go now was back through the door with the ruined ritual. A sharp howling came from the room, and cages littered the entire area. It smelled of urine, blood, and feces. That, combined with the rotting smell of Loch's curse made it difficult to concentrate. Rizzax and Uunkalo powered through the smell and found there was a small bookshelf with dozens of musty books, and decided to take some, as to figure out more of this strange place. Razz picked up several holy scrolls and Uunkalo grabbed as many of the nameless books as he could carry, and they scurried out of the room as quickly as they came. Loch, however, stayed behind. He hobbled over to one of the cages. Inside, he swore he saw the old man yet again. \"You again,\" croaked the elemental, \"What are you doing here?\" The old man bared his teeth and began to scream at Loch until he broke down and started sobbing. Edvard walked up to the cage and looked inside. All he could see was another wolf. He helped Loch up and the blackened barbarian continued crying.\n     \nThere was no longer anywhere the party could go. They had a broken warrior, and a weird inside of a painting that couldn't speak. In his anger, Loch picked up the painting with his right hand and threw it at the wall. The frame shattered and the painting tore in half. Tattered Pages appeared shortly after the destruction of the art piece and stretched his appendages. \"Thank you, friends, I though I would be trapped there. Visor and I ventured here to attempt to find any clues to 1000 faces. A group of cultists had captured him, and entrapped me into that painting. Follow me.\"\n     \nThe flaming elemental little path to a secret passage, and as they entered, there laid Vasari, being repeatedly stabbed and healed by five cultists, all while chanting a hymn. A new, sinister voice boomed through the antechamber, and it told the cultists to please him or to fear his wrath. Loch had nearly been consumed by the curse and fell to the ground. They needed to end this or Loch and Vasari would die. Rizzax, Uunkalo, and Tattered all took to rushing the demonologists, while evade tended to Loch. Tattered was quite upset with these ritualists, and they were evil, even by his standards. He began to channel elemental energy and released a wave of flame, engulfing all of the cultists, turning them all to ash, except for one.\n           \nUunkalo took to reviving the cultist while Rizzax stabilized the wizard. As soon as the cultist awoke, the only thing that was asked of him was why. As expected, his only response was \"Power...\" before he succumbed to the burns. Uncle sighed and picked up the unconscious wizard. There was a knife in his back that slid out, and it fell into Lochs' hand.\n     \nAt this point, nothing was left of Loch but a mass of rotting flesh and maggots, but as the knife fell into his hand, it all drained into the knife. He awoke with a  jolt and screamed. Something had happened, the booming voice was reduced to a whisper, and it told him that he was chosen to return Withengar to Innistrad. Loch took to naming the blade Prost, and he knew not what to do yet, but they knew that they had to get the Wizard to safety and they owed the innkeeper a dinner. Loch and Uunkalo carried Vasari out of the mansion as Rizzax began sprinkling holy water throughout each room. It was a small step, but everything counted.\n      \nThey all returned to the inn, and laid Vasari in their room. Razz and Uunkalo began to cook dinner for the barkeep, and the other three began to wander throughout the town, asking about the bone blade that they had found in the mansion.\n\n\nThe session ended there, and will be back next week, we shall attempt to learn more about 1000 faces then, but as of right now, we're stuck clearing the mansion in the name of Avacyn.",

        "text": "A quick disclaimer: As a DM, I play it fast and loose with the rules. My setting is homebrew as fuck, as are nearly all the items my players have. Nothing so OP as to remove the challenge of the game, mostly just stuff based on my personal lore. In addition, I often set rolls, DCs, and the results of certain actions arbitrarily based on what I think would be the most fun for the players. That being said, here is my story.\n\nIt was the finale of the campaign, final boss battle with Father Llymic, of the 3.5 Elder Evils supplement, his stats edited for 5e. One of the first things the players do in the session is to fire the Wabbajack (similar, but not identical, to the Skyrim item of the same name) at the mountain on which Llymic lives in hopes of a landslide or some such. The way the Wabbajack works is that when fired, two D10s are rolled as a percentile. The result, between one and one hundred, determines the staff's effect. On a 1 or 100, a D6 is rolled, and if that roll is even, the wielder gets 1D8 wishes, whereas on an odd the mad god who created the staff possesses the wielder's body and makes the world his own insane realm. The barbarian fires the staff, rolls a fucking 100. Table looses its shit, I roll D6. A six is rolled, the D8 comes up seven. Motherfucking seven wishes. There are five players and two NPC allies, so the player chooses to give one to everyone, allowed within the parameters of the special, nigh-unlimited wishes bestowed by the Wabbajack. NPC #1, an unwilling vampire searching for a cure, wishes for said cure and gets it. The sorcerer wishes to become a weretiger with full control over his transformations. Everyone else saves their wishes. The barbarian, high on victory, fires the Wabbajack again. I shit thee not, it is another fucking 100. One in ten thousand chance. Our fucking faces when. The D6 was rolled, and it is a fucking five. The barbarian dies instantly, and a deity of utter insanity claims his body. Right off the bat, he turns the snow into cheese, clouds into rocks that fall to earth and kill millions only to revive those millions in different bodies, turns all birds into goats, removes the cleric's mouth, and then turns the druid into a newt. Druid uses his wish to change back and teleport to the Feywild. NPC #2, resident badass, uses his wish to drive the mad god out of the barbarian's body. It succeeds, Cleric brings him back to life. Barbarian then uses his wish to restore his blade, Moonslicer, the vessel of an ancient paladin's soul (his name is Garg, blatant ripoff from previous Gametale), which had shattered when the god possessed his body. The mad god, however, returns in a new body and resumes wrecking shit. Cleric then uses his wish to summon the god of order to banish the mad god from this world, which he does in addition to reversing all of the mad god's bullshit. So, after the druid plane shifted back from the Feywild, the party came out of the adventure with the cleric as a champion of the god of order, the sorcerer being a fucking weretiger, and the paladin still having a wish saved. Ultimately, they came out ahead, and this was before they even went to fight Llymic. That is another batshit crazy story entirely.",

        "text": "My first game as a bard, I start to feel pretty useless compared to my compatriots, and they themselves call me useless. Until I use the stupid amount of skill points, and 5 languages I have to use. Me and my group are in a tunnel system, where the BBEG is using goblins to do menials labor like collect fungi and ores. My group notices a large amount of goblins in the next room collecting fungi and we all successfully manage to sneak through. Once through however I change my mind, decide to turn back into the room, convince the goblins that I was the new guy with a successful roll, and begin to collecting fungi.\n\nWe share some good moments, as my old group continues on without me. Me and the goblins begin singing as if we are on an American plantation in the deep south. Eventually an idea springs into my head, and I give a speech to my goblin friends that no longer should we toil under the boot of the bourgeoisie, and start quoting Karl Marx. Natural 20.\n\nMe and my horde of 10 goblins continue on and notice a bunch of dead goblins along out paths to the BBEG, I get down on my knees, eyes full of tears, and holding a dead goblin in my arms, and convince them it was their overlord who did this. Natural 20.\n\nThe goblins take me into more work tunnels to recruit even more goblins on the way to the BBEG, until I finally arrive. My old partners are struggling to fight, and are on the losing side of the battle, as the BBEG has 2 accomplices and a horde of smaller minions. I play on my saxophone triumphantly, and yell \"CHARGE!\" and all of the sudden 25 goblins are wailing on the fucking overlord, my teammates looking at their 'useless' member with gratitude and amazement as I single highhandedly bring the campaign to a close.\n\nOnce the BBEG is dead, my goblins look at my teammates and ask who they are. I tell them I have no idea, and that they must be with the BBEG. Roll for goblin stupidity in not understanding that they were just fighting the BBEG, success. The goblins pile up on my teammates and kill them.\n\nCasino Black, the saxophonist, begins carving out his communist goblin kingdom.\n",

One of the hobgoblins got an AOO against our alchemist that critically hit and he died.\n\nBetween myself and the party rogue consulting with an engineer we managed to bring down the tower and retreat. One of the remaining hobgoblins began searching the alchemist's body. The character kept his body booby trapped. The DM had the alchemist roll an intelligence check to see if he remember to booby trap his body. The alchemist made the check and as the hobgoblin began to search our fallen comrade's body every bomb on his body detonated, obliterating every remaining hobgoblin in the area.",

        "text": "Contains a few spoilers for the Rise of the Runelords FYI...\n\nSo I'm relatively new to pathfinder. Played one small campaign before, and before that several of D&amp;D 3.5. I love the group I currently play with. We tend to be a little loose on the rules if something fits the moment just right. So when we decided we'd start RotRL I decided to try making a barbarian with a unique twist. It was an idea that I saw online somewhere but I couldn't find the source.\n\nWhen people think barbarian the first thing that comes to mind is a heavily muscled warrior charging into the fray with a wild battle cry. This idea, in contrast was to play a barbarian who has harsh phobias of just about everything you could possibly imagine. Instead of channeling his deep wells of fury to enter a rage, this barbarian quivers and quakes with fear until his terrors reach a crescendo and his “fight” response paints his vision red. The group was quick to nickname this character Jitters.\n\nJeremy “Jitters” Mcmuffin was an unfortunate child. Something happened when he was young. One day he came, screaming and running from the wood surrounding Sandpoint. Everyone knew there were goblins in the area, however few dared venture this close. He eventually started speaking again, though with a stammered, stuttering, uncertainty. There was no sign of what horror the child met with that day, but no one could deny the indisputable presence of sheer terror that Jeremy held in his now wide, unblinking eyes from that day on.\n\nYears later the group happened to meet at a festival that was going on in Sandpoint. There was the paladin Mark, AKA Coach. Fenrir the rogue, the party stealth expert , and womanizer.  Maxwell the ~~drunken idiot~~ sorcerer. And of course Jitters the “barbarian”. It was during the Sandpoint raid that we all met and decided to go on an idiotic enterprise to fight hordes of goblins and or get killed (as Jitters would put it). However Coach would have none of this negativity and apparently standing on a table, playing bop the goblin with a woodcutting axe, while screaming at the top of your lungs is enough to volunteer yourself for more righteous crusading. And thus Jitters gets looped into getting into more danger.\n\nNot that Jitters didn't have some benefits to this. After the “fantastic job” clearing out the goblins and restoring the peace at the festival Jitters was offered free food at one of the local inns. Now I designed this character as a combination between Shaggy from Scooby-Doo and Morty from Rick and Morty. One of his simple joys in life was food, the boy was scrawny and scraggly, but MAN could he put food away. Besides, nothing keeps the night terrors away like falling asleep with a bulging stomach. This on top of being considered a “hero” did wonders for his pitiful self-esteem. And despite the dangers, he quickly formed a student-coach (hence the nickname) with Coach who was all too happy to show off what it means to be a HOLY WARRIOR!!! Plus Jitters in general felt a little bit safer being near Coach (aura of courage FTW).\n\nAnd so it was that jitters slunk through caverns and dungeons with the rest of the group. It was a running joke that every time we ran into something new I would roll a d20 to determine how terrified Jitters was of it, resulting in some hilarious scenarios. Some of the best moments were when the group was in a pinch and pressure was building I would roleplay Jitters uses of rage as...\n\nJitters screams of terror begin to rise beyond levels of masculine pitch.\n\nJitters' noodle arms stops shaking and he begins to bash things much MUCH harder,\n\nand if anyone rolls high enough perception they see Jitters eyes go slightly crossed.\n\nMy DM loved it so much he mad a house rule that should Jitters ever be feared (as in drop your weapon, start running) I could instead immediately expend a use of rage for the day and start raging.\nHowever things got much farther out of hand when we assaulted a goblin fortress. Now, our group is not necessarily the quietest group. Sure we have a stealth expert, but he gets little mileage beyond scouting out enemies before Coach and Jitters run in, quite literally screaming. So as we broke through the halls of this fortress the goblins had much time to become aware and prepare for our arrival.\n\nWe approached a set of double doors, Coach gave me a reassuring nod, I gulped, and we flung the doors open. Now, we already knew Jitters doesn't handle goblins that well, we naturally assumed that Jitters definitely doesn't handle a HORDE of goblins that well, and after making Jitters fear-o-meter roll...\n\n**DM:** “does Jitters panic?”\n\n*roll*\n\n**Me:** “Nat 1. Yup, Jitters panics”\n\n...we discovered that Jitters REALLY can't handle goblins riding on GIANT LIZARDS. Let the screaming commence.\n\nThe fight actually went well though. Figures that goblin archers aren't the best archers around, but we actually got through that fight mostly unscathed. However as we started pushing the goblins back a spellcasting goblin showed up and started channeling a spell.\n\n**DM:** “Jitters, make a will save.”\n\n*mehroll* \n\n**Me:** “does X make it?”\n\n**DM:** “...yes, actually. By one. He wouldn't have made it if not for rage.”\n\n**Me:** “hmm...”\n\n*badreroll* \n\n**Me:** “so Y doesn't make it?”\n\n**DM:** “no...?”\n\n**Me:**“something strange happens. Jitters screams begin to warble his face pales to a deathly white and his eyes go crossed.”\n\nI pull up [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLpRVZkiuAc) and begin playing it. Everyone begins to bust out laughing.\n\n**DM:** *after regaining composure* “roll intimidate”\n\n*prettygoodroll* \n\n**DM:** That image is horrifying, the goblins are completely demoralized and confused.\n\nFrom then on whenever Jitters enters a rage he laughs a horrible terrified laughter with a pale face, crossed eyes, and the entire table has to take a moment to hold back a massive giggle-fit. I love this character and my group.",
