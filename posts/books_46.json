        "text": "I've been reading Morgante alongside the Divine Comedy (currently in Purgatory) and I find the presentations of Love in Morgante to be gradually differing from Dante's vision. \n\nThe primary examples I'm thinking about are those surrounding Forisena's suicide. \n\nFirstly Canto IV, 84, 1-4  says, \"My cruel fate, heaven itself, a very ruthless star or some inexplicable will of God had doomed me to the most horrendous death. But you O famous knight, came east in time, surely sent by the Eternal Court\"\n\nMy initial impression here was Forisena was explaining God didn't truly doom her but instead sent Oliver. But that makes little sense given the \"Pagan\" (Islamic) faith she held. At least in the context of Luigi Pulci's understanding. \n\nFurther Canto IV, 85, 3  Oliver \"Thanked Love\" this seems to imply a Charitas sort of Love which inspired the formerly mentioned actions of Oliver to save Forisena, in direct opposition to the Will of God.\n\nThis all comes to a climax in Canto V, 17, 5-8 when it is said \"Love himself brought her to a high window whence she viewed Oliver farther, even farther go, until she threw herself below.\"\n\nContinuing in Canto V, 18, 5  \"it had been Love to make all this occur.\" (referring to the suicide) \n\nThis all seems contrary to the sort of Primary Love Dante has been speaking about, my initial response to this was to label Forisena's actions as a Passion ruled Secondary Love, however, Pulci seems to directly deny this in Canto V, 17, 2  Which says that Forisena had \"firmness in her heart,\" seemingly claiming a rule of Will or Rational but not Passion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan I say that this sort of Love is referring to the same Love as Dante?\n\nIf so how do I justify a correlation between the selfless charitable Love from Dante and This Dido-adjacent, selfish Love from Pulci?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*My apologies if this does not fit the purpose of this sub.*",

Most books + shipping on ebay float around $ 80, which is weird because it's around the same whether it weighs 250g or 1500g. There aren't that many textbooks there either. For large books like S.

They were allowed to write whatever they wanted as long as it didn't effect his main works and only built upon the world. I feel like it'd be an interesting concept and could possibly drive more fan engagement, so I was just wondering if it's ever been done and if so how it turned out.\n\nThanks in advance for any who answer and please let me know if this is the right subreddit for a question like this.

        "text": "So, I’m on a Chicago novel bender and everyone and their mother told me I had to read Crossing California by Adam Langer. The Goodreads is mostly 4-5 stars. Just as an example, BookBrowse gave it unanimous praise:\n\n&gt; Whether viewed as an American Graffiti for the seventies, The (Jewish) Corrections, a Chicagoan Manhattan, or early Philip Roth for a later generation, Crossing California is an unforgettable, and thoroughly enjoyable, contribution to contemporary fiction.\n\nBut as I’m reading … there’s almost nothing redeeming about this novel. There’s way too many storylines and they’re all only vaguely connected, none of them in an interesting way. It feels like a disjointed precursor to Egan’s A Visit from the Goon Squad (one of my favorites) but has none of the charm. It certainly doesn’t have the “last day of high school gotta-get-outta-my-hometown” feel of American Graffiti. The only comparison I’d maybe agree with is to Roth (especially earlier Roth - Letting Go was similarly disappointing, and that’s not necessarily a compliment. \n\nSomebody please tell me what I’m missing. Many of the 4/5 stars on Goodreads say something along the lines of “I grew up in this neighborhood in the 70s and that’s exactly what it was like!” That’s cool and all but … certainly there’s gotta be something else to grab onto … right?",

I speak French, and I read the book in French and I don’t know if it was translated from English or the book was written in French, that’s why I’m coming here for help.\n If I remember correctly, the plot was that there was a teenage writer (she was young at least) writing books and then she sort of gets kidnapped by a random lady when she gets in a car crash. We later find out that the girls book was originally the kidnappers book idea that she apparently stole when she overheard the woman’s conversation on the plane or something. (It might have been from a notebook too..) \nThe teenager had a broken wrist, and they said in the beginning of the book that she was always a loner at school and that she was bullied. Her book was one of the firsts in NYC or something and I think she was driving to go to a meet and greet before she was in the car crash. She was locked in a room in the basement, and I think a boy helped her escape, he was the neighbour of the kidnapper. The kidnapper also had a daughter. And at the end of the book, the writer is sharing her story in an interview on live TV or something. \nIve been thinking about this book for so long and I want to read it again, but I cannot remember the name or anything important about the book to be able to research it. Please help me if you have any idea about what it could be!",

        "text": "I’m about six weeks late on this but wanted to post anyway. Format is a quick description of the book followed by my thoughts. If you’ve read any of these, I’d love to discuss them with you!\n\nI had a really great reading year in 2022. [Per Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2022/27844285), my average rating was 4.0, I read 61 books (17,743 pages), and the average length was 290 pages. My main goals were to do more rereading and read more nonfiction and poetry, all being basically nonexistent in my reading lists of years past. I met those goals with varying levels of success: I reread 16 books, read 5 nonfiction books, and only read 3 poetry collections. I plan to continue all of this in 2023.\n\nItalicized titles are in the public domain—I highly recommend [Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/) as the best source for public domain works, though [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) has a better selection.\n\nWithout further ado, in order read:\n\n**Ella Enchanted** by Gail Carson Levine: Middle Grade Cinderella retelling with a twist. Reread of a childhood favorite, delightfully nostalgic but admittedly a bit thin for an adult audience. ★★★★★\n\n**I Capture the Castle** by Dodie Smith: Coming-of-age story of an impoverished 17-year-old who falls in love with the son of the wealthy family who moves nextdoor to the dilapidated English castle in which she and her bohemian family live. Charming, cozy, with a precocious narrator who is somehow the most well-adjusted of the entire cast. Well-written if a bit twee and kooky. ★★★★☆\n\n***The Blue Castle*** by LM Montgomery: Valancy is a 29-year-old “spinster” who is given a shocking medical diagnosis and finally decides to get out from under her overbearing family and take control of her life. In spite of soap-opera-esque coincidences and plot contrivances, this swoonworthy romance is a new all-time favorite with some of the most beautiful nature writing I’ve ever read. ★★★★★\n\n***Frankenstein*** (the 1818 text) by Mary Shelley: Victor Frankenstein, driven by unchecked ambition, constructs a monstrous creature who sets out to take revenge on his creator. Another new all-time favorite and undeniably brilliant: a riveting and fast-paced storyline, interesting narrative structure, unique and evocative settings, eloquent prose, and timeless, thought-provoking themes. Feels much more mythic and philosophic than science fiction or horror. ★★★★★\n\n**An Experiment in Criticism** by CS Lewis: Essay collection on literary criticism: a contemplation of why people read, what it means to read well, what literature has to offer as art, and what makes a good book. Yet another new all-time favorite; prose is succinct and immensely readable. Lewis puts words to feelings that I hadn’t been able to articulate (and also presents some more challenging ideas that I continue to think about). ★★★★★\n\n**Anna Karenina** by Leo Tolstoy (trans. Pevear &amp; Volokhonsky): Anna Karenina, a Russian aristocrat, begins an extramarital affair with a handsome cavalry officer, Count Vronksy; meanwhile, a young landowner, Levin, contemplates whether life is worth living while managing his farmland and pining after Anna’s sister-in-law, Kitty, who expects to receive a proposal from Vronsky. One of the most subtle, psychologically real novels I’ve ever read. Almost everyone is awful (except for Kitty and Tolstoy’s self-insert, Levin) yet impossible not to empathize with. ★★★★★\n\n**The Luzhin Defense** by Vladmir Nabokov (trans. Michael Scammell): Follows the career of (fictional) chess genius Grandmaster Luzhin. Structurally a mess. The main character feels like a mean-spirited caricature of mental illness and is uninteresting, unsympathetic, and incomprehensible, with the physical, emotional, and psychological appeal of a slug. I enjoyed the opening chapters and some of the prose, but that’s it. ★★☆☆☆\n\n**Vita Nostra** by Marina and Sergey Dyachenko (trans. Julia Meitov Hersey): Sasha is unwillingly recruited for the mysterious and supernatural Institute of Special Technologies. Unputdownable and surreal but turned me into a ball of anxiety. Prose is excellent, genre is undefinable. Kudos to the translator, it must have been almost impossible. ★★★★★\n\n**84, Charing Cross Road** by Helene Hanff: Nonfiction collection of letters between a New York writer and a London antiquarian bookstore. Read in one sitting to recover from *Vita Nostra* and it’s an instant all-time favorite. I laughed, I cried, I wished it was longer. Anyone who loves books will probably love this. ★★★★★\n\n**The Night Circus** by Erin Morgenstern: Two magicians are locked in a secret competition, the venue being the titular circus. Reread. Atmospheric, beautifully written, with some of the most magical imagery I’ve ever encountered, but the characters feel two-dimensional and lack emotional resonance. ★★★★☆\n\n**All Quiet on the Western Front** by Erich Maria Remarque (trans. A. W. Wheen): The story of a German soldier who is part of the invasion of France in WWI. Brutal, unflinching, powerful depiction of war. One of the most impactful books I read (technically a reread as it was assigned in high school), it challenges black-and-white thinking about the people who make up armies. ★★★★★\n\n**The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street** by Helene Hanff: Nonfiction account of Helene’s visit to England after the success of *84, Charing Cross Road*; more of a travel diary than a love letter to books (which *84* was). Mildly interesting because of how much I love Helene, but a bit dull—travel diaries aren’t so much my thing. ★★☆☆☆\n\n**The Abolition of Man** by CS Lewis: Nonfiction essay collection arguing for the inclusion of virtue in education…I think? A bit disjointed and hard to follow, most of it went over my head but some of the ideas were intriguing. Lewis is a compelling stylist. ★★★☆☆\n\n***Middlemarch*** by George Eliot: Widely considered to be the greatest English novel ever written (and deservedly so, in my opinion), it recounts the intertwined lives and romances of several families in fictional Middlemarch. It took me about 250 pages to really fall in with Eliot’s writing style, but once I did I found the novel both beautiful and readable. Just as psychologically real and compelling as Anna Karenina, if a bit more sensational and also more hopeful. ★★★★★\n\n**Perelandra** by CS Lewis: What if JRR Tolkein was sent to Venus as an Adam figure in an Edenic paradise where Satan himself has just recently arrived? Book 2 in the Space Trilogy but a perfectly solid standalone; reread. The best part is the nature writing delving into landscapes that are completely fantastic and (quite literally) out of this world; the worst part is the plot, which revolves around extended discussions of fictionalized theology and is just so so boring. ★★★★☆\n\n**The Drowned World** by JG Ballard: A biologist and friends set up camp in a version of London that is almost entirely submerged in a tropical swamp and Triassic-era jungles that have overtaken most of the globe. Atmosphere and prose are truly fantastic, plot is off-the-wall bonkers and nonsensical and things get real Freudian real fast. Lots of sexism (and kind of racist?). Should have been a short story. ★★★☆☆\n\n***The Yellow Wallpaper*** by Charlotte Perkins Gilman: Victorian short story about a married woman prescribed the cure of laying in bed all day in the upstairs nursery. Great idea, boring and repetitive execution, even though it was short. Shirley Jackson tackled similar themes much much better with *The Good Wife*. ★★☆☆☆\n\n**The Sundial** by Shirley Jackson: Aunt Fanny has a vision that the world will soon end, and her dysfunctional extended family begins the requisite preparations. Extremely bizarre and a bit all over the place, but strangely compelling. Not the place I’d recommend starting with Jackson, though. ★★★★☆\n\n**A Grief Observed** by CS Lewis: Nonfiction diary entries, originally published under a pseudonym, of Lewis struggling with his faith in the aftermath of the death of his wife. Moving and vulnerable, if very short. ★★★★★\n\n**Dark Tales** by Shirley Jackson: Short story collection mainly centered around characters (usually women) experiencing some sort of mental instability and/or living in a version of midcentury American that’s just a bit “off.” Someone else said these stories have a kind of “nightmare dream logic” to them, and I wholeheartedly agree. Very compelling, but the endings are usually unsatisfying. ★★★★☆\n\n**Rebecca** by Daphne du Maurier: An insecure, lonely young woman marries a wealthy older man and is whisked off to his ancestral estate, where she is unable to escape the lingering presence of his beautiful (and dead) first wife, Rebecca. Reread of my favorite novel. The prose is gorgeous, the narrator/heroine is drawn with startling complexity and realism, the plot is heavily psychological and totally engrossing, I could talk about the subtext and symbolism for eons. ★★★★★\n\n**Excellent Woman** by Barbara Pym: Mildred is an unmarried 30-something whose life revolves around her church and jumble sales when a chaotic younger couple with marital problems move in as neighbors. Another new favorite, with Pym a new favorite author. A bit Austen-esque in terms of the dry wit and emphasis on manners and society, it’s equal parts very funny and deeply melancholic, if a bit plotless. ★★★★★\n\n**Titus Groan** by Mervyn Peake: An heir to Castle Gormenghast, Titus Groan, has just been born, and…there isn’t really that much of a plot, just increasingly bizarre vignettes of grotesque characters doing their own thing. Peake was obviously a master of prose and accomplished exactly what he set out to, but the novel was just too weird and the style too (intentionally) repulsive. ★★☆☆☆\n\n**And Then There Were None** by Agatha Christie: A group of strangers are invited to a secluded island, where they start being murdered one-by-one: who’s the killer? Very fun murder mystery that’s hard to put down. Her style isn’t the most flashy, but it’s effective. ★★★★★\n\n**No Fond Return of Love** by Barbara Pym: Hard to describe, but basically a social comedy about the romantic entanglements of midcentury English academics. Feels like people-watching: ordinary people (often embarrassing, pathetic, and too caught up in themselves) do ordinary things, tied together only loosely by the barest semblance of a plot. Cozy, humorous, and a delight, if not quite as much so as *Excellent Women*. ★★★★★\n\n**Journey to the Centre of the Earth** by Jules Verne (trans. Frank Wynne): A young man travels with his eccentric professor uncle on a quest to visit the theoretically hollow center of the Earth by way of an Icelandic volcano. Another new favorite, probably because I love rocks and geology and spelunking and dinosaurs and old-timey inventions and the sense of wonder and excitement with which Verne’s characters view the natural world and the fantastic things they discover. The characters are a bit flat and the plot structure is a mess, but it’s just so fun that I didn’t care. Translation is fantastic (and, more importantly when it comes to Verne, reputable). ★★★★★\n\n**On Chesil Beach** by Ian McEwan: Young newlyweds have a disastrous honeymoon; the history of their relationship is examined. A pointless exercise in misery with characters who are completely unbelievable. Some of the prose was nice, though. ★★☆☆☆\n\n**Chess Story** by Stefan Zweig (trans. Joel Rotenberg): A traveler aboard a passenger ship challenges the world chess champion. Short and moderately entertaining, but fairly predictable, unextraordinary, and laughably unbelievable for anyone who follows competitive chess. ★★★☆☆\n\n**Annihilation** by Jeff VanderMeer: A biologist is one of a team of women sent to explore Area X, a section of the coast undergoing strange and inexplicable changes, where she is forced to confront her professional and personal failures, including the dissolution of her marriage. Reread of my favorite work of science fiction: I adore the atmosphere, the tension, the sense of *wrongness*, the nature writing, the narrative structure, and the character study that is the heart of the novel. ★★★★★\n\n**Authority** by VanderMeer: The sequel to *Annihilation* follows a man nicknamed “Control” who is newly appointed as head of the Southern Reach, the governmental organization tasked with investigating Area X. Another reread, and oh no, it’s kind of bad. I think it’s trying to be a noir espionage thriller about bureaucracy, but it ends up being bland in terms of character and atmosphere with the thematic subtlety of being hit over the head. ★★☆☆☆\n\n**Acceptance** by VanderMeer: The sequel to *Authority* follows the next expedition into Area X. At least we’re back in Area X with its beautiful, eerie setting; unfortunately, things get real weird and feel kind of pointless. ★★★☆☆☆\n\n***Northanger Abbey*** by Jane Austen: Catherine Morland, young, naive, and an avid reader of novels, builds new friendships and falls in love in a lighthearted comic satire of Gothic romances. My favorite Austen novel so far, in part because Catherine herself is delightful and in part because of the unexpected metacommentary on novels and reading. ★★★★★\n\n***Moby-Dick: or, the Whale*** by Herman Melville: Ishmael signs on to a whaling ship and Melville spends the next 500 pages talking about whales and the whaling industry. I loved the opening chapters, but once Ishmael sets out to sea the plot disappears and the book becomes a collection of essays and short character vignettes, deeply metaphoric and beautifully written. Undeniably a brilliant piece of writing, but not really a *novel*. Very postmodern feeling and one of the most unique things I’ve read, I just didn’t really care for it. ★★★☆☆\n\n**The Lottery and Other Stories** by Shirley Jackson: A collection of short stories that are mainly “slice of life” vignettes centered around a theme or character study. Many lack a discernible story structure, or really any kind of narrative movement. There are some great ones, but many of them fell flat for me. ★★★☆☆\n\n***The Complete Poems*** by Emily Brontë (ed. Janet Gezari): Emily Brontë complete body of poetry. My first foray into poetry, and a “complete works” was probably not a great place to start. I don’t know much about the form, but I liked it overall, I guess? ★★★☆☆\n\n**Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea** by Jules Verne (trans. David Coward): A professor and friends on board a giant submarine travel beneath the seas, where they experience many manmade and natural wonders. Properly translated, the title should be “...under the Sea**s**”, and I can’t tell if I didn’t care for this translation specifically or the novel  itself. The plot is extremely thin (as are the characters, though I think that’s expected in a Verne novel), and I’m just not that interested in lists of fish. ★★★☆☆\n\n**My Friend Flicka** by Mary O’Hara: Growing up on a ranch in Wyoming, all Ken—a daydreamer who never seems able to do anything right—wants is a horse of his own. Reread of a childhood favorite, and even though the main character is a child I don’t really think this is intended to be a children’s book at all, tackling themes of responsibility, facing reality, parenthood, and marriage. The nature writing is gorgeous and the characterization subtle; the plot is at times brutal with some real tear-jerking moments. Definitely a favorite. Surprisingly not available as an ebook, though. ★★★★★\n\n***Far From the Madding Crowd*** by Thomas Hardy: Bathesheba Everdene inherits a farm and is courted by three very different men. Supposedly Hardy’s “happiest” novel, it’s still brutally sad. It’s also a total soap opera and quite the page-turner. The nature writing is beautiful as one would expect, but the characterization feels a bit hollow. ★★★★☆\n\n**100 Best-Loved Poems** edited by Philip Smith: Slim collection of poetry from the Middle Ages through the 20th century. A better starting place. ★★★★☆\n\n***Pride and Prejudice*** by Jane Austen: Elizabeth Bennet’s mother is obsessed with marrying her daughters off, and a wealthy family has just moved into the neighborhood. Might actually be a perfect novel: the characterization is superb, the plot has zero fat, the chemistry between the romantic leads is electric, and Austen is so *so* funny (though she definitely plays favorites). Technically a reread because I read it in high school, but I appreciated it much more this time around. Feels very modern. A favorite. ★★★★★\n\n**Quartet in Autumn** by Barbara Pym: Follows four coworkers—two women, two men—in the autumn of their lives as two of them face retirement. Brutally bleak and an almost relentlessly depressing look at loneliness and aging; I cried my way through it. Not much plot and the opening chapters are a bit rough, but I find myself thinking about this all the time. ★★★★☆\n\n**Black Wings Has My Angel** by Elliott Chaze: Noir novel about a convict who teams up with a prostitute for one more heist. Dark and violent, I don’t think the grittiness was quite my cup of tea but it was impossible to put down. The writing is superb and it would have been five stars, but Chaze fumbled the ending. ★★★★☆\n\n**Piranesi** by Susanna Clarke: Piranesi lives in a House filled with thousands of statues, tides that thunder up staircases, clouds that move in slow procession through the upper halls, and a single other living person…until it seems that someone new has come to the House. Reread of my favorite fantasy novel and it was just as magical as the first time around. Surreal, beautiful, and utterly unique. ★★★★★\n\n**The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe** by CS Lewis: Four siblings travel through the back of a wardrobe into Narnia, a fantasy world ruled by the wicked White Witch. Reread of a childhood favorite, and unfortunately this really doesn’t hold up for an adult audience: it’s heavily didactic and the writing is a bit bland (I mean, I think that was intentional as it’s written to be a sort of modern fairytale, but I didn’t really care for it). Five stars only because I loved it back when I was the target audience. ★★★★★\n\n***Lady Audley’s Secret*** by Mary Elizabeth Braddon: Robert Audley is visiting his wealthy uncle, who has recently married the mysterious (and much younger) Lady Audley, when his good friend goes missing. The Victorian equivalent of a domestic thriller: some mysteries go unanswered until the end of the novel, but it is very much a game of cat-and-mouse between Robert and “my lady.” Some character choices feel a bit unbelievable, but very fun overall. The writing style may be a bit overblown, but I like flowery prose so it worked for me. ★★★★☆\n\n***The Castle of Otranto*** by Horace Walpole: When a giant helmet falls from the sky and kills the heir of the Castle of Otranto, his father decides to have his marriage annulled and instead marry the young woman who would have been his daughter-in-law, very much against her will; hijinks and supernatural phenomena ensue. Often cited as the first Gothic novel, it purports to be a translation of a medieval manuscript discovered by Walpole. Hilariously bad on every level, and just short enough that it’s entertaining for that very reason. ★★★☆☆\n\n**The Screaming Staircase** by Jonathan Stroud: The first in a Middle Grade series about Lucy Carlyle, a teen who joins a small Psychic Investigations Agency—one of many that have recently sprung up to rid houses of the dangerous ghosts that have infested the greater London area. No, I have not seen the Netflix show. The books are delightful: funny, thrilling, atmospheric, and just a bit spooky. Better-written than most adult genre fiction. Reread. ★★★★★\n\n***The Picture of Dorian Gray*** by Oscar Wilde: Dorian Gray, a beautiful young man who falls under the influence of the perverse Lord Henry Wotton, wishes that a perfect portrait of himself would bear the signs of aging in his place. An instant favorite: some of the most beautiful prose I’ve ever read, and extended meditations on the nature of art, humanity, and sin. ★★★★★\n\n**The Haunting of Hill House** by Shirley Jackson: Eleanor Vance—lonely and desperate to get out of the house of her overbearing sister—accepts an invitation to spend the summer at a supposedly haunted house as part of an academic investigation, but the inexplicable phenomena the group experience seem to single her out in unsettling ways. Reread of a favorite. Not as spooky this time around, but just as enjoyable. A brilliant character study and piece of psychological horror with prose that is equal parts gripping and beautiful. ★★★★★\n\n**Pocket Book of Poetry** published by Barnes and Noble: A collection of English poetry spanning four centuries. The selection itself was very good, but there is a complete lack of any commentary—not even dates are given. (Unsurprising, it seems like B&amp;N always phone it in.) ★★★★☆\n\n***Mehalah*** by Sabine Baring-Gould: Forgotten Victorian novel about a young woman living in poverty on the isolated salt marshes of Essex who is relentlessly pursued/stalked by the sadistic and passionate Elijah Rebow. Bizarre, unsettling, and violent, centered around a toxic relationship, I understand the *Wuthering Heights* comparison, except nobody could mistake this for a romance and Mehalah herself is no Catherine Linton. A compelling read, if disturbing. ★★★★☆\n\n***Three Men in a Boat*** by Jerome K. Jerome: Three bumbling Victorian gentlemen decide to take a vacation by boating up the Thames; hilarity ensues. It’s primarily a series of humorous vignettes and anecdotes strung together, and I found it very funny and charming, largely thanks to our narrator’s personality. I rarely laugh out loud when reading but this did it for me. ★★★★★\n\n**The Borrowers** by Mary Norton: Arriety and her family are “borrowers,” tiny people who live under the floorboards and “borrow” what they need from the humans who live upstairs, with the fear of being “seen” constantly hanging over them. Reread of a childhood favorite, and it is just so whimsical and cozy! I’ve always loved small things, so I was delighted to read about dressers made from matchboxes and end tables made from pill boxes. The characters are exceptionally well-developed for a children’s book, and the illustrations are enchanting. ★★★★★\n\n**The Borrowers Afield** by Mary Norton: In the sequel to *The Borrowers*, the little family now must try to survive outdoors, where they take refuge in an old leather boot. This was another reread, and while I didn’t love it as much as the first book due to the extended framing device, the description of the outdoors as seen through the eyes of tiny people was lovely and there’s a bit more adventure. ★★★★☆\n\n***Villette*** by Charlotte Brontë: An English teacher in Belgium deals with depression and unrequited love. Reread of one of my favorite novels: beautifully written, psychologically profound, and quite moving. ★★★★★\n\n**I Am Legend** by Richard Matheson: Robert Neville may be the last human alive, and he spends his days fighting vampires and drinking. Fun premise (sci-fi approach to zombies) and a quick read, but the characterization was atrocious (Robert is a walking cliche) and the sexism is gross. ★★★★☆\n\n**In the Woods** by Tana French: An Irish detective investigates the murder of a young girl whose body is found in the same woods where he himself was discovered as a child, covered in blood and with no memory of what happened to his missing friends. I was expecting French to be the next Gillian Flynn: beautiful prose, incredible atmosphere, pointed commentary, crazy twists. Instead this felt like a kind of generic police procedural that was perfectly readable but unremarkable and too long. I think it’s intended to be a study of the relationship between Rob and his partner Cassie, but I just didn’t care about either of them. Oh, and one of the central questions of the book (specifically, &gt;!what happened to Rob as a child!&lt;) is left unanswered, which is infuriating. ★★★☆☆\n\n**Roadside Picnic** by Arkady and Boris Sturgatsky (trans. Olena Bormashenko): Follows Red as he navigates the black market and bureaucracy that has sprung up around the strange and dangerous Zone, which he occasionally enters in search of valuable and mysterious alien artifacts. I enjoyed the roughly half of the novel that is set in the Zone; the other half was dull. Generally disjointed and too disturbing for me. Very little atmosphere. Comparisons to *Annihilation* don’t hold up beyond the surface-level similarities. ★★☆☆☆\n\n**Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont** by Elizabeth Taylor: Elderly Mrs. Palfrey is the newest arrival at the Claremont, a hotel-turned-quasi-retirement-home, and convinces a young writer to pretend to be her grandson so she isn’t embarrassed by her lack of visitors. I laughed, I cried, I sometimes was a bit bored. There’s just not quite enough voice in Taylor’s writing, and the characters felt a bit too distant. It didn’t help that I kept thinking how much more I’d have enjoyed the novel if it was written by Barbara Pym. ★★★☆☆\n\n**Nutcracker and Mouse King** by ETA Hoffmann (trans. Joachim Neugroschel): Christmas fairytale that explains the origin of nutcrackers and the phrase “That was a hard nut to crack.” It’s just really weird, really hard to follow, and really boring. ★★☆☆☆",

In both  Novels Sience went to far in proving that something that is  theoretically possible should not be put into practice. Humanity is  playing god just for the sake of doing so. In Moreau you have a  character you have a man who is driven not from knowledge or a result  that can lead to a benefit for humanity but just personal glory and the  knowledge that he was right all along. Instead of theorizing his idea  and concluding that it is in fact possible he conduct these cruel  experiments just to prove a point and not because it would have a  meaningful result. Jurassic Park is about applying questionable science  without thinking through the possible risks. The Park exists for profit  but the consequences arent thought through enough to justify it. What  could happen is being put in the background. When an accident happened  they didnt shut it down in order to make it as safe as absolutely  possible but seen it as a normal work accident. They havent perfected  the formula but still strive for even more progress despite having proof  that the basis of it is lacking or if it was even a good idea in the  first place.

        "text": "It’s the use of the word “heard” instead of “listen.”\n\nSo basically, someone who thinks audiobooks don’t count will say something like this. “With an audiobook, you can’t say you ~read~ a book. You just ~heard~ it, and that’s not the same thing.”\n\nI’ve seen this argument a million times and it’s always weird to me. Why would you use the word “heard” to describe the audiobook experience, when “listen” is right there? “Hear” is a passive verb, one that has no relation to whether or not you’re paying attention to what you’re hearing. Meanwhile, “listen” is active; it implies that you’re actively concentrating and that you care about what's being said.\n\nIt's just a weird argument I keep seeing that makes no sense to me. Most audiobook listeners will tell you that the word “listen” is a much more accurate term for how they take in the book, but audiobook-haters keep on insisting on using the word “heard” instead. I see what you’re trying to do here, guys! You can’t fool me.\n\nThe reverse would be like if I said to an anti-audiobook person, “You aren’t really reading this book; you’re just seeing the words on the page.” A ridiculous statement, of course, which is why we don’t use it.",

        "text": "The Sun Is Also a Star by Nicola Yoon is a book that has garnered a great deal of attention and critical acclaim, including being a National Book Award finalist. However, despite the book's popularity, its story and themes fall short in a number of ways. The book's flaws include its unrealistic plot, its lack of depth and nuance in its exploration of its themes, and its over-reliance on cliches and coincidences to drive the story forward.\n\nOne of the main issues with the book is the implausibility of the story. The book follows the story of two teenagers, Natasha and Daniel, who fall in love within a single day. While this type of whirlwind romance may be popular in movies and novels, in reality, it is unlikely that such a relationship would develop as quickly as it does in The Sun Is Also a Star. Both characters are facing significant obstacles in their lives. Natasha, an undocumented immigrant, is facing the threat of deportation, while Daniel is struggling to balance his own dreams with the expectations of his parents. Despite these difficulties, the two characters seem to fall in love almost immediately after meeting. This type of love story is not only unrealistic but also lacks the depth and nuance necessary to make it meaningful.\nAnother issue with the book is its shallow exploration of its themes. While the book touches on important topics such as immigration, identity, and race, it fails to do so in a meaningful way. The book portrays Natasha as a sympathetic character who is unfairly targeted by the American legal system. While this is undoubtedly true for many immigrants, the book does not delve into the deeper complexities of the issue. For example, the book fails to explore the reasons behind why certain immigrants may be targeted more than others, or how economic factors play a role in immigration patterns. Similarly, the book explores Daniel's struggles with his Korean-American identity, but it does so in a superficial manner. The book does not address the cultural nuances and complexities of this struggle, nor does it delve into the history of Asian-American identity in the United States.\n\nMoreover, the book relies heavily on cliches and platitudes to convey its messages. Many of the conversations between Natasha and Daniel feel forced and unconvincing, with characters saying things that feel more like declarations of love than genuine dialogue. For example, Daniel tells Natasha, \"I don't believe in love at first sight, but I do believe in seeing someone and knowing instantly that you're meant to spend the rest of your life with them.\" Such statements may be effective in romantic comedies, but in a book that purports to tackle serious issues, such platitudes fall short.\n\nAdditionally, the book's use of coincidences to drive the plot forward undermines the realism of the story. For example, Natasha happens to bump into a lawyer who is willing to take on her case pro bono. This type of coincidence is not only unlikely but also detracts from the realism of the story. The reliance on such coincidences also makes the book feel predictable and formulaic, detracting from its overall impact.\nAnother issue with the book is the limited perspective it offers. The book is primarily told from the perspectives of Natasha and Daniel, with occasional interludes from other characters. However, the book does not offer a broader view of the issues it purports to address. For example, the book fails to explore the perspectives of other immigrants or the reasons why some Americans may be hostile to immigrants. Similarly, the book does not delve into the experiences of other Asian Americans or the broader history of Asian American identity in the United States. The limited perspective of the book ultimately detracts from its ability to deliver a nuanced and meaningful message.\n\nIn conclusion, while The Sun Is Also a Star may be a popular and critically acclaimed book, it falls short in a number of ways. The book's unrealistic plot, lack of depth and nuance in exploring its themes, reliance on cliches and coincidences, and limited perspective all detract from its overall impact. The book fails to delve into the deeper complexities of the issues it purports to address, and instead relies on superficial and formulaic storytelling to convey its messages. While the book may be a quick and easy read, it ultimately leaves readers with a shallow and unsatisfying experience. For those looking for a more nuanced and meaningful exploration of issues such as immigration, identity, and race, there are better options available.\n\nThis was written by a human.",

        "text": "Full title is Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End. This book is written by Dr. Atul Gawande who is a surgeon and public health researcher. He has written a couple of books on his experience as a surgeon, and I’ve read most of them, but Being Mortal has haunted me every day since I first listened to the audiobook. It’s an overarching look at  elderly people and geriatric care. It covers everything from nursing homes, long term care facilities, assisted living, and the decisions we make regarding healthcare of those who are old or close to the death. It may sound dry, but Gawande is an incredible writer with an honest outlook and personal accounts that make the work flow. \n\nI work in a hospital laboratory and recently started doing microbiology work after having been a phlebotomist for a couple of years. Leaving direct patient care has been vital for me because I couldn’t emotionally handle the things I was party to. I’m not talking about gory traumas or stinky C. diff patients, but elderly people who are utterly miserable and being subjected to more testing and surgeries just to prolong their suffering. Reading this book has opened my eyes to how and why this happens to a very vulnerable population that almost all of us will become part of one day. \n\nI recommend this book to everyone I work with. To anyone who has an elderly relative. To anyone who is going be elderly eventually. So, everyone. This book addresses how medial advancements have allowed people to live much, much longer, but at what cost? \n\nI’ve always been interested in mortality and how different cultures view it and this book is the most comprehensive overview of American and modern healthcare and how we, as a society, treat our elderly. This book alone inspired me to go back to school and become a palliative care doctor. \n\nSo, yeah, you should read this!",

He describes his horrible states of mind and mentions cursing, being defaulted from tournaments, and not being liked by fellow players. However, he doesn’t really go into his asshole-ish years other than to describe his (bad) coping mechanisms. \n\nI wish he would have been more reflective on that aspect and how he treated fellow players, umpires, ballkids, fans, etc. \n\nAlso - another case of “please just go to therapy!”",

In regards to non fiction, there are plenty of interesting facts or quotes I've come across and wished that I had documented or written down while reading.\n\nTo remedy this, I decided to start keeping a reading journal where I can write my feelings about a book, write out any interesting facts or quotes, and for fiction, I'll usually write a short plot summary (especially books that are part of a long series). I've found doing this has done wonders for helping me remember more of what I read, and if I forget something, just glancing at my journal entry for that book helps refresh my memory.\n\nI'm currently doing all of this digitally using Notion. While the app has worked well, I've noticed that sometimes the app gets laggy and I also dislike the fact of an offline option. Therefore, I've been thinking about moving to another app. \n\nFor those of you that keep digital reading journals, what app or apps do you use? Hopefully any suggestions here can give me some options to look into as an alternative for Notion. Thanks so much!",
