        "text": "Hi,\n\nI currently have a bit of a dilemma. I am set to start studying Political science (with a focus on International Relations) in September. I am interested in most of the courses offered, and before choosing that, I was also interested in studying Sociology. My main interests are: Population, migration, and human development. I am not good at math. In high school, I took AP human geography (which has been my favourite class I've ever taken) as well as IB geography. I recently stumbled upon this course:  https://www.rug.nl/bachelors/human-geography-urban-and-regional-planning/ which has caught my interest. \n\nAnyways, I'm wondering if any of you could give me some advice regarding this as a career path. I currently live abroad, and have two other \"home\" countries, so I don't really have a home base...meaning I would like a career that can be useful/ in demand in various parts of the world.\n\nTo give an idea, this would probably be something I could see myself doing in the future: https://unjobs.org/vacancies/1516216812691 \n\n\nI am a bit stuck because I don't want to put myself into a \"box.\" Some of the courses from the political science degree and the human geography one overlap, but I feel like the former is broader and would give me more flexibility than the latter. I plan to go to grad school regardless of what I choose. \n\nAny advice is appreciated, thanks :)",

More recently I have been able to put to words that I have a high interest in urban planning and want to pursue a career in it (in hindsight, I have had an interest in it for awhile). My undergrad degree is in bio and chem.\n\nI have no experience in urban planning what-so-ever. I really thought about the career change in the end of December/beginning of January and I thought a good way to get into the field would to get a masters; then join the workforce. With deadlines approaching quickly, I decided to apply and have been accepted into University of Illinois - Chicago and Ball State.\n\nAbout a  month ago I spoke with a friend and he has instilled some doubt into me as to whether this direction into urban planning is really the best one. He basically asked, how could I be so sure without any experience in the field? (Basically not the direction he would take) I hold his opinions in high regard.\n\nI am curious what your thoughts are on the worth of getting a masters, how it plays into getting a job, and thoughts on my current situation.\n\n***I have been debating accepting, and then deferring admission a year to try and get some experience, to \"make sure\" it's what I want (the doubt that was instilled in me)\n\nThank you\n",

        "text": "After graduating from college with a civil engineering degree, I found myself working in my home town for a local engineering firm doing mostly municipal engineering (roads, sewer pipe, water pipe, stormwater). A fair percentage of my time was spent convincing people that, when it came to their road, I knew more than they did. \n\nAnd of course I should know more. First, I had a technical degree from a top university. Second, I was in a path towards getting a state license … which required me to pass a pretty tough test just to get started and another, more difficult, exam to conclude. Third, I was in a profession that is one of the oldest and most respected in human history, responsible for some of the greatest achievements of mankind. Fourth—and most important—I had books and books of standards to follow. \n\nWhen people would tell me that they did not want a wider street, I would tell them that they had to have it for safety reasons. \n\nWhen they answered that a wider street would make people drive faster and that would seem to be less safe, especially in front of their house where their kids were playing, I would confidently tell them that the wider road was more safe, especially when combined with the other safety enhancements the standards called for. \n\nWhen people objected to those other “enhancements,” like removing all of the trees near the road, I told them that for safety reasons we needed to improve the sight distances and ensure that the recovery zone was free of obstacles. When they pointed out that the “recovery zone” was also their “yard” and that their kids played kickball and hopscotch there, I recommended that they put up a fence, so long as the fence was outside of the right-of-way. \n\nWhen they objected to the cost of the wider, faster, treeless road that would turn their peaceful front yard into the viewing area for a drag strip unless they built a concrete barricade along their front property line, I informed them that progress was sometimes expensive, but these  standards have been shown to work across the state, the country, and the world, and I could not compromise with their safety. \n\nIn retrospect I understand that this was utter insanity. Wider, faster, treeless roads not only ruin our public places, they kill people. Taking highway standards and applying them to urban and suburban streets, and even county roads, costs us thousands of lives every year. There is no earthly reason why an engineer would ever design a 14-foot lane for a city block, yet we do it continually. \n\nWhy? The answer is utterly shameful: Because that is the standard.\n",

Holy smokes!\n\nThe breakdown is:\nAPA:$375\nAICP: $175\nChapter: $150\nDivision: $25\n\nI mean this is just absolutely ridiculous! I'm between jobs, so I'm paying out of pocket. I can't ask my current employer to pay in good faith, and I don't want to be coming into my new position with a $725 bill in hand, requesting reimbursement.\n\nI understand they want to make the dues \"progressive\", so they scale based on pay. But that's B.S. I have kids. I have a mortgage. I have two car payments. I have a lot of expenses, including insane California &amp; Federal taxes. Putting nearly 2% of my salary into APA's coffers each year (including conferences, renewal, etc.) is infuriating. \n\nEveryone has different costs of living - from a renter with no kids to a single parent with major bills. APA needs to stop this. \n\nThey brought in $22.5M in 2016. What a business empire they've developed! Nice salaries too, and pensions! It's an exploitative pyramid scheme. Of course, if you pass their inconceivably broad (and likely irrelevant to your practice) AICP examination, you basically HAVE to attend the conferences to collect your CM credits to keep your AICP active. Plan on spending $1000s if you're out-of-state, folks! \n\nI DO want to support the local chapter, they help prepare folks for the AICP test, and provide mentorship programs. I DO want to support APA and AICP, because I want to see the profession grow. But WHERE is my money going? Their Annual Report is conveniently inaccessible - just some pretty bar charts on their fancy new website. All their \"costs\" appear self-funded!\n\nThe AICP test is self-funded - I paid $425 to take it. Books are self funded - they all cost hundreds of dollars. Heck, even AICP study materials are HUNDREDS of dollars. \n\nThe overly-indulgent, week-long conferences are self funded, it cost me nearly $600 just to attend the CALIFORNIA conference this year (easily over $1,000 if you select add-on programs!). I don't even want to know what the Annual Conference costs to attend. No way I'll go unless its in my home town. Week-long conferences that cost thousands of dollars also have a benefit cost at WORK. But I guess academics and \"researchers\" don't care about that.\n\nWHAT, exactly, are the dues going towards?!? This place is due for a thorough audit.\n\nHow many people in this sub pay for AICP? Does anyone have a salient counterpoint to lower my blood pressure?",

I've sifted through and am looking for feedback on them \\(see below\\).\n\n**Proposed/Possible Changes:**\n\n* Weekly/monthly thread for school, career, professional, and sort of 'meta' profession questions.\n   * Should we automod things to direct to the weekly/monthly threads flair search?\n   * Or should we automod job/career/school threads to direct them to the wiki first?\n   * Keep in mind we can only have two post/thread stickies at a time; so we're going to have to have trade offs if we have too many of them :\\)\n* Monthly International Planning Thread/Discussion\n   * Should we feature a county/continent?\n\n**Some existential questions:**\n\n* What ought the tone of the sub?\n* Do we see this sub as:\n   * catering to the people who work in urban planning\n   * for urban planners to discuss while teaching the rest of us\n   * a casual enough format where, planner or not, everyone's voices have equal weight\n   * All the above?\n* Should non planners play more of a spectator role?\n* Are the professional decorum rules overbearing? Do you want more swearing and 'passionate' argument?\n* How do we feel about memes and stuff? \\(the rule was last examined three years ago\\)\n* CSS feedback, in general? /[u/MrAnonymous](/user/MrAnonymous) had some feedback.\n* Should we split r/urbanplanning into r/urbanplanning for news and r/urbanplanningmeta \\(or some other name\\) for career and school questions/advice? \\(this idea came from /[u/wimbs27](/user/wimbs27)\\)\n\n**Some ways you can help make the sub better:**\n\n* Link flair your posts\n* Report reposts, especially helpful if you can follow up with a modmail containing the other post \\(mods are volunteers and have jobs and families, so anything that streamlines helps\\)\n* Actually report anything that ought to be reviewed. Send a modmail if its urgent.\n* Submit more of what you want to see \\(especially international content!\\)\n* /[u/jayjaywalker3](/user/jayjaywalker3) would like everyone to note that r/transit exists :P\n\n# I welcome all your comments, questions, concerns, complaints, memes, jokes, etc. below!\n\nEdit \\(3/25/2018\\): per a comment below, I'll be hiding vote counts for an hour, to start, in order to combat pile on voting.",
