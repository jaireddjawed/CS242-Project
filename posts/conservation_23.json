CRP is only relevant if it's been farmland recently, and is out of acres this year anyway.\n\nAre there any other relevant programs through other groups (Pheasants Forever, Sierra Club, Nature Conservancy, etc.) that might help him offset the lost rent from those acres if he keeps the trees?

        "text": "I'm considering going back to school to get an undergraduate in wildlife management. I currently have a AA transfer degree from a community college. It's been about four years since I graduated from community college. \n\nI've been comparing various wildlife programs. I've noticed that some schools require much more in the way of general education requirements for science majors.\n\nSome of this doesn't make any sense to me. For example a bunch of programs require a full year of calculus plus a full year of chemistry, physics classes in addition to other broad biology courses. I've noticed some programs, like Humboldt State, don't require calculus and as many chemistry courses. I spoke to a friend that has a MS in ecology about this and he said that schools that tend to have weaker departments will require more nonspecific courses. He was also baffled why calculus would be required.\n\nIt's been so long that for me to even get into a calculus class I'd probably be looking at doing at least a full year,but probably two years, of math just to get to where I could be ready for the calculus classes. I find this extremely frustrating especially if calculus has no relevance to the field. \n\nAny thoughts or input on this?",
